Hello everyone. Welcome to Pod Chill.<br />
We're so happy to have you here with us today.<br />
If this is your first time listening to Pod Chill, think of it like we are sitting together in a small coffee shop.<br />
Yeah, a small corner, warm lights, and no need to be perfect here. It's just you, me, and Gwen. Everything is very relaxed.<br />
And today, we want to talk about something everyone has experienced.<br />
Something that can make your heart feel tired faster than running.<br />
Right — and that's when comparing yourself to others.<br />
Sound familiar?<br />
Definitely familiar.<br />
But today, we won't give a lecture.<br />
Not at all. We just want to share like friends, and we hope after this episode, you'll feel a little lighter.<br />
Okay, let's get into the topic.<br />
Well, Gwen, do you believe that a few minutes on your phone can change your mood?<br />
Huh? What are you talking about?<br />
I'm talking about how people compare themselves to others online. I mean how we sometimes start looking at other people's lives online and feel like our life is not enough.<br />
Oh, about that — I believe people often feel others' lives are better after seeing them on social media.<br />
Yes. Like someone online got a big achievement — maybe a promotion, a popular project, or even just what looks like a perfect life in their highlight reel, right?<br />
And that highlight reel shows only the shiny parts.<br />
That is the trick.<br />
You are comparing your normal life with the best moments they show. So you ask yourself, *“If I had that, would I really be happy?”*<br />
That is the hard question.<br />
Sometimes we do not want big success. We just see the shine from far away.<br />
Oh, it is like watching a movie trailer and thinking you want the whole life it shows, but you do not know the full story yet.<br />
That is why comparison comes quietly. It makes you forget that your life has important moments too. Even if they are quiet or slow, your life has its own bright moments, its own problems, its own wins.<br />
No video can show the full story of your life.<br />
So when you feel the need to compare, take a deep breath. See the trap, and remember your own journey is important.<br />
Yes, the best moments they show look shiny, but your real life is more important — with both good and hard times.<br />
But I feel that after dealing with many things in life, people forget what is behind a smile.<br />
Yes, I see that too. When we compare, we only see the bright part.<br />
Exactly. We do not see the hard work, the late nights, or the small steps someone took. That is why comparison can hurt. It does not see your heart or your effort.<br />
Right? It only shows the best moments. It makes you follow a shadow.<br />
And following a shadow is always tiring. It does not make you stronger. You do not see the hours they spent practicing or the times they wanted to stop.<br />
That is the point. Comparison does not see all the small hard times. It only shows the bright moments. Then we think we are not enough.<br />
Yes, like we must reach that bright thing to be happy.<br />
But happiness does not come from only bright moments. It comes from effort too.<br />
I'm pretty sure my mom would totally agree with that. Back then, my mom was compared to other kids a lot, but she didn't care.<br />
That already shows your mom has a strong personality.<br />
Yeah, something like that. But she really believed in herself and did her best at that time. She always told herself, *“Look at your own steps, your own work.”*<br />
Wow, your mom is amazing. That is a good idea.<br />
Ah, sometimes talking with a friend helps too.<br />
Yes, a friend can comfort you and make you feel really calm inside, because real love sees the heart, not only the shine.<br />
Comparison does the opposite. It makes your heart heavy.<br />
So when you see it, stop for a moment and breathe. Think about your own effort, your own wins.<br />
Those are real. Even if quiet, they are yours — not someone else's best moments. Only we can understand the moments inside ourselves.<br />
And here is the thing: every journey has its hidden chapters.<br />
Hidden chapters — that sounds magical. I like that. Tell me more.<br />
These are just the parts of life people do not show. The days they had problems, the nights they felt tired or unsure, the times they almost gave up.<br />
Oh, so while we see the best and shiny moments they show, we don't see all the steps, the mistakes, and the effort behind it.<br />
That makes a lot of sense.<br />
I remember my friend posting about their trip around the world, and it looked perfect on Instagram.<br />
Exactly. But I didn't know they had worked extra hours for months to save money, and they were probably very tired at times, right?<br />
Yes, completely. But on the outside, it looks like a perfect life.<br />
That's why comparison tricks us. We forget that every life has parts we cannot see.<br />
And honestly, we cannot understand all someone else's hidden chapters.<br />
So thinking too much about other people's lives just wastes our energy.<br />
Much better to focus on our own hidden chapters — the effort and challenges we face every day.<br />
Yes, even if nobody sees them, they shape us.<br />
And those hidden chapters are what make our story real and strong.<br />
So whenever you feel pulled into comparing, remember hidden chapters exist for everyone.<br />
Exactly. That's a good way to start appreciating your own journey more.<br />
And it gives us a natural step into the next thought: how we often measure ourselves unfairly.<br />
True.<br />
Wow, Gwen, I feel like our chat is making me think a lot.<br />
Me too. And maybe our friends need a small pause to breathe.<br />
That's a good idea. Let's take a little break.<br />
Yes. Stretch a bit. Relax your shoulders. Maybe get a drink.<br />
And don't forget — if you like this episode, hit like and subscribe.<br />
It really helps us keep making these chill talks.<br />
Also, check the PDF tab on the right.<br />
You can go there to get the transcript and follow along.<br />
Okay, deep breath. Feel a little lighter?<br />
I hope so. And now, let's get back to the conversation.<br />
Right. Before the break, we talked about hidden chapters.<br />
Yes, those unseen moments that make everyone's story real.<br />
But here is the hard part. After seeing other people's shiny moments, we often compare ourselves in the wrong way.<br />
That is true. We see our messy middle — the small problems we face every day — and compare them with someone else's success.<br />
But nobody sees the hard work, the mistakes, or the stress they had.<br />
And if we try to get the same results, we often feel unhappy.<br />
Meanwhile, they are enjoying their success, smiling, and living their life — and we are still trying to catch up.<br />
So what happens to us?<br />
Stress, tiredness, maybe even sadness.<br />
Yes, and it is not good for your heart.<br />
Your heart needs kindness, not pressure from wrong comparisons.<br />
That is why we need to stop and remember that we are on our own journey.<br />
Comparing yourself with someone else's highlight is never fair.<br />
When you understand this, it is easier to breathe and follow your own path.<br />
But some of us still cannot stop thinking, *“I'm behind in life,”* right?<br />
Yeah, that one never feels good.<br />
But here's the thing: different speed doesn't mean slow.<br />
People sometimes say others are “broken.”<br />
I hate that word. It feels like a lazy label people use when they don't understand someone's life.<br />
It's like they think everyone must live the same way.<br />
Me too. And it's wrong. You are not broken just because your life moves differently from others.<br />
Everyone has things others don't see — worries, family problems, healing, learning — and people forget that.<br />
Yeah. That's why comparing is not fair.<br />
So my speed is just my speed.<br />
Yes, it is your life. No need to compare.<br />
But life does not always go straight, right?<br />
Of course not. Some days we move forward, some days we move very little.<br />
Oh, and sometimes we are just trying to survive the day, not win anything.<br />
Yep. That's still part of the journey.<br />
So none of that means something's wrong with me.<br />
Not at all.<br />
People who call others broken often cannot accept their own good and bad days.<br />
Can you explain more?<br />
You know, it's easier for them to judge someone else than to face their own fears — fear of failing or going slowly.<br />
That actually makes a lot of sense.<br />
As long as you keep the desire to move forward, even slowly, you're not falling behind.<br />
So the important thing is the direction, not the pace.<br />
Exactly. You're not broken. You're growing.<br />
Agreed.<br />
Growth isn't always big or loud. It may be small, quiet, and slow — but it still matters.<br />
We move fast, we stop, or even restart from zero. That's the process of growing.<br />
Hm. If we're talking about growing, how do we measure it?<br />
Growth seems like it should always be moving, right?<br />
Well, yes, growth keeps going, but it doesn't mean you have to hurry all the time.<br />
Sometimes growing is quiet and hard to notice, like learning to be patient or being kinder to yourself.<br />
True. Those small things don't look big, but they change how we live every day.<br />
Sometimes that quiet change is even stronger than big steps.<br />
But sometimes I feel like if I'm not moving fast, I'm missing something.<br />
That's exactly why I like this idea: *your pace is your path.*<br />
Ah, the classic — but very real.<br />
It makes me feel lighter. It shows me I don't have to follow someone else's speed.<br />
Yeah. You can move slowly if you need to, and that's okay.<br />
Your pace is your path, and your path is special because it belongs to you.<br />
I like that. It's like saying no one else can walk your path for you.<br />
Even when people give advice or try to compare, they don't really know what we feel or what we're trying to learn inside.<br />
Well said. And growth doesn't follow a map.<br />
Sometimes you grow a lot in one week, sometimes in one month, sometimes it takes years — and that's fine.<br />
Success doesn't have only one meaning.<br />
Right? In this world, there are many jobs and many ways to live.<br />
So success can look very different for each person.<br />
One person's dream might be building a family.<br />
Another's might be traveling the world.<br />
And another might find it in quiet days reading books at home,<br />
or even just learning to take care of yourself every day.<br />
That is also a big success.<br />
And that reminds me — not all progress can be seen by others.<br />
Right. Your progress is still important even if others don't notice.<br />
The key is finding your own path, not someone else's path.<br />
And that path — however slow or winding — is special because it's yours.<br />
Gwen, I noticed one thing people don't see when they compare themselves.<br />
Do you know what that is?<br />
What's that?<br />
Well, when people compare themselves, they often miss what is happening in their own life.<br />
Even small things — a quiet morning, a walk outside, or a smile from a friend — can be very meaningful.<br />
Oh, right. Those small moments are actually special.<br />
They are experiences only you can have from your own view.<br />
Your view is unique because no one else lives your life like you do.<br />
No one else feels the sunlight through your window or tastes your morning coffee like you do.<br />
Comparison tricks the mind.<br />
It makes people chase moments that are not theirs and miss the moments that really belong to them.<br />
Normal days are important.<br />
Even if nothing special happens, they create the flow of life — little joys and small successes.<br />
Noticing these moments can make you happier than always chasing other people's success.<br />
Laughing at a small mistake, watching the sunset, or sitting quietly with a cup of tea —<br />
these moments are calm and very valuable, right?<br />
They show that your life is yours.<br />
Your story, your speed, your experiences. No one else can take that from you.<br />
When you feel like comparing yourself, pause and notice the normal moments around you.<br />
They are special.<br />
It helps you grow with more peace, without always measuring yourself against someone else.<br />
And when we notice our simple moments, it also makes us think about how we see ourselves.<br />
True. And I think that connects to confidence — not loud confidence, but something quiet and strong.<br />
Yes. Quiet confidence is different from showing off or trying to be better than others.<br />
It grows slowly inside you when you stop looking at others all the time.<br />
It's about trusting your own steps instead of trying to run faster than someone else.<br />
Exactly.<br />
For example, I have a friend who used to feel small every time she checked social media.<br />
She always compared her work with others and thought she was not good enough.<br />
That sounds stressful.<br />
Very stressful.<br />
But then she started paying attention to her own progress, even if it was small.<br />
She stopped copying anyone else's achievements.<br />
And what happened?<br />
She grew a lot. Her projects got better.<br />
She felt proud and even got noticed at work — all because she stopped measuring herself by someone else's life.<br />
Wow, that's great.<br />
Quiet confidence is calm and works well.<br />
Yes, and it lasts longer.<br />
It makes decisions easier because you trust yourself.<br />
It calms your mind because you don't need to compete with everyone else.<br />
I see. It's like having a compass inside you that shows your own way instead of following other people's maps.<br />
Exactly.<br />
And the good part is, it helps even when life gets messy.<br />
You can face hard days because you believe in yourself.<br />
That's better than chasing someone else's success and feeling tired all the time.<br />
Yes. Quiet confidence lets you move forward while keeping peace in your heart.<br />
It grows with you — even when life is slow, confusing, or full of mistakes.<br />
The more you practice this, the less you compare yourself to others.<br />
You feel stronger being yourself.<br />
That's right.<br />
And when you feel that, you start seeing progress you never noticed before —<br />
small wins, quiet successes, moments when you handled things well.<br />
All of these matter.<br />
So quiet confidence really gives you space to grow your life in your own way, without watching what others do.<br />
Exactly. That is why it is worth building little by little, day by day.<br />
So guys, comparison is never a good friend — especially when you compare yourself to others.<br />
The friend who is always with you is yourself, and the loved ones around you.<br />
So why give our peace to comparison, right?<br />
Loving yourself and your efforts matters more.<br />
Even small progress from yesterday counts.<br />
Yes. Growth takes time.<br />
Like a tree — little winds are important.<br />
Seeing your quiet strength helps a lot.<br />
And your journey is only yours. No one else can live it for you.<br />
Celebrate yourself a bit each day.<br />
Quiet confidence grows slowly, but it stays.<br />
Thanks for listening and letting us share.<br />
Take care of your heart and mind.<br />
See you next time on Pod Chill. This is Gwen.<br />
Bye. Keep noticing your little winds and growing your way.<br />
I'm Leo, your chill friend.<br />

Hi everyone. Welcome back to Podcast and Chill. I'm Leo.<br />
And I'm Gwen. I hope everyone is having a good day, because today we will—<br />
Uh, Gwen, do you think I'm good-looking?<br />
Leo, what? Where did that come from?<br />
It's just I've been thinking. Many people think you need a perfect face or expensive things to look good. But I don't have money for expensive things, and I can't change my face. So, does that mean I can never look good?<br />
Leo, first of all, you look fine. And surprise — that is our topic today.<br />
Really?<br />
Yeah. Everyone wants to look good every day, but most people don't know where to start. So today we're talking about eight things that make anyone look better with just small details.<br />
Anyone?<br />
Yep. Men, women, anyone. It's cheap, easy to do, and you don't need to wait to see a change.<br />
That sounds perfect for me.<br />
All right. Are you ready for the first one?<br />
Yes. Gwen, teach us the secret.<br />
Since you want to look better without changing your face or buying anything, let's begin with the simplest change, which is your posture.<br />
Posture? You mean how I stand and sit?<br />
Yes. So if anyone listening is sitting with a bent back right now, sit up straight, please.<br />
Okay, okay. I'm sitting straight. But Gwen, how does standing up straight make me look better?<br />
When someone always looks down, shoulders forward, back bent, what do you think?<br />
Hm, I guess they look tired or maybe sad.<br />
Exactly. Bad posture makes you look like you're very tired and have no confidence at all.<br />
And does good posture help?<br />
Uh-huh. Good posture makes you look confident, healthy, and even a little taller — about two or three centimeters.<br />
No way. So all I need to do is just stand up straight.<br />
Just keep your shoulders a little back, your chin up, and don't bend your back. It's simple.<br />
That's it?<br />
That's it. People will see you as more confident, and you don't even need to say anything.<br />
Oh, I will sit straight all day today. Maybe I can look taller than you on camera.<br />
Leo, you are already taller than me. Relax.<br />
Well, now I want to be even taller.<br />
Fine, whatever you like.<br />
To be honest, that sounds easy, but I always forget after two minutes, especially when I'm sitting. How can I remember?<br />
Put a small note on your computer that says, “Sit straight.” Or every time you look at the clock on the wall, fix your posture. Use things you always see as your reminder.<br />
Oh, okay. Just use things around me.<br />
I can help you remember too. I will just look at you straight in the eyes every time I see you sit wrong.<br />
Please don't. That would be so weird.<br />
Haha. All right. Once your posture looks good, there's something else people notice fast, and that's looking clean.<br />
Looking clean? I take a shower every day. I'm very clean.<br />
I know, I know. But it's the small things. Let's start with your hair and eyebrows.<br />
What's wrong with them?<br />
Oh, nothing. Just keep them clean and not crazy. A person with good hair tells people, “I know how to take care of myself.”<br />
Ooh. What about eyebrows? Please don't tell me I have to do something with these two.<br />
You don't need to change them. Just clean the extra hairs. Neat eyebrows actually help shape your face better.<br />
So, attack the lonely hairs.<br />
You can say that. And don't forget to wash your face. A clean face gives you a real glow-up.<br />
What does glow-up mean?<br />
It means looking much better, like your face is shining. Fresh skin makes you look awake and healthy.<br />
I do wash my face, though.<br />
Washing with water is good, but using a face wash is better. It takes away the bad oil.<br />
My face makes bad oil?<br />
Uh, no. Our skin has natural oil, but during the day that oil mixes with dirt and sweat from outside. So we call that mix bad oil. It can block your pores — you know, those tiny holes — and cause pimples.<br />
Ah, got it. But then why does my face get so oily in the first place?<br />
Well, your skin needs both oil and water to be happy. When you wash your face, you take away the bad oil, but you also take away some good water. This can make your skin dry.<br />
So if my skin is dry,<br />
it will try to protect itself by making more oil. That's why it gets oily again so fast.<br />
The face wash cleans, but it also makes my skin dry. Gwen, this is so confusing.<br />
I know. That's when you use face cream right after.<br />
What does the cream do?<br />
The cream puts the good water back. Then your skin will stay calm and won't need to make so much extra oil to protect itself. No more angry, oily skin.<br />
Oh, I never thought about that.<br />
Yeah, you probably should now. And one more thing — your nails.<br />
Not my nails. Nobody sees my nails.<br />
Everybody sees them, Leo. You must keep your nails clean and cut short. Dirty nails are one of the first things people notice.<br />
Wow. Hair, eyebrows, face, nails — so many rules just to be clean.<br />
But it works. And the good thing is, it's all easy and cheap. You like cheap, right, Leo?<br />
Okay, you got me there. My wallet is happy. So what's next?<br />
Next is actually a fun one — your smell.<br />
Yes, my favorite. I have a very good perfume.<br />
I know. Sometimes I can smell you before I see you.<br />
Really?<br />
That's not always a good thing, Leo.<br />
Oh… yeah.<br />
People can forget what clothes you wore, but they will always remember how you smell.<br />
That's a little scary.<br />
Don't worry, it's a good thing. It just means you need to know how to do it right. Always use a smell blocker first, because perfume cannot stop sweat.<br />
Ah, I usually just use perfume and I'm done.<br />
That's a mistake many people make. Perfume and sweat together — not good. No matter how strong your perfume is, sweat will make a bad smell. That's why smell blockers are so important.<br />
Right, so stop the sweat first, then perfume.<br />
Not yet. A little skin cream, then the perfume. If your skin is dry, the smell goes away fast. If you put body cream on, the smell stays much longer.<br />
So smell blocker, then body cream for happy skin, then my perfume.<br />
Perfect. And here's a tip to make perfume last longer: put a tiny bit of Vaseline on your wrists or neck before you use perfume. It helps the smell stay on your skin longer.<br />
That's a cool trick. I'm going to try that tomorrow.<br />
Great. And remember, the goal is for people to smell you only when they're close.<br />
What do you mean?<br />
Well, you don't want a repeat of “I can smell you before I see you,” do you?<br />
Oh right. That was a bad thing.<br />
Too much perfume can be too strong and give people a headache. You want a light, secret smell — just one or two sprays.<br />
Yes. You want people to remember you, not run away from you.<br />
Haha, got it. No more smelling me before seeing me.<br />
Good. My nose is safe now. But you know what I will see from far away?<br />
Um… face? No, it's clothes, right?<br />
Bingo. Clothes.<br />
Gwen, please remember that I don't have money to buy new clothes all the time.<br />
I'm not saying you need to buy new or fancy clothes. What's important is making sure your clothes are clean and fit your body well — not too big, not too small.<br />
But I like big shirts. They are comfortable.<br />
Comfortable is good, but a big shirt can make you look messy. Try clothes that are comfortable but fit your size. A shirt in the right size makes you look much better.<br />
Does it still work with a cheap T-shirt?<br />
Correct. I'm wearing a simple shirt right now. Do I look nice to you?<br />
Yeah, you do. But I always thought that's just because you're, you know… Gwen. You always look perfect.<br />
No, Leo. It's because I choose the right size. Also, fit doesn't mean tight. Clothes should look like they are made for your body. The shoulder part of the shirt should sit on your shoulder, not down your arm.<br />
Just buy the right size. Anything else about clothes?<br />
Yes. Choose colors that match your skin tone. They make your face look brighter.<br />
How do I know what colors match my skin?<br />
If you have warm skin, wear warm colors like orange, yellow, or brown. If you have cool skin, wear cool colors like blue, purple, or green.<br />
I have no idea if my skin is warm or cool.<br />
Don't worry too much about it. Just notice which colors make you look healthy and which ones make you look tired.<br />
Ah, that makes sense. Try different colors and see what works.<br />
Exactly.<br />
And you know what's interesting? When you feel good about how you look on the outside, it can change how you feel on the inside. And that feeling is what we call your energy.<br />
You are joking, right? Energy?<br />
No, I'm serious. I'm talking about your attitude — the feeling people get from you even before you speak.<br />
What kind of feeling?<br />
If you're always thinking, “Life is bad. This is bad. That is bad,” and you complain a lot, people feel that heavy energy. They won't find you good-looking at all, no matter how great you look.<br />
Oh, so if I complain a lot, people go away.<br />
Obviously. Nobody wants to be close to that kind of energy. It's tiring. But if you're positive and happy, people feel comfortable and safe. They want to be close to you.<br />
I can't believe my happy attitude is more beautiful than my cold, sad one.<br />
Well, a cold, sad face might look cool in photos — until you open your mouth and complain.<br />
Yikes. I understand now. My energy can affect other people's energy. But Gwen, what should I do when I want to complain? I can't just be happy all the time.<br />
Try saying one good thing first. For example, instead of “I'm tired and work is bad,” say, “I'm tired, but the coffee is good today.” It's a small change, but it helps your brain think better.<br />
So I'm not lying about being tired — I'm adding something positive.<br />
Yes. You're changing the energy from bad to good. And when people feel that good energy around you, they like you more.<br />
Wow, that's really interesting. I never thought about it this way.<br />
Most people don't. They think it's all about looks.<br />
Well, guess what? One of the easiest ways to show that energy is to walk like a boss.<br />
Haha, Gwen, what the—<br />
I mean walk with purpose, like you know where you're going. It's a way to show confidence.<br />
What if I'm nervous?<br />
Then don't show it.<br />
Isn't that like lying?<br />
No. It's about how you carry yourself. Walk like you have somewhere to be, even if you don't.<br />
Ah, fake it till you make it.<br />
Exactly. People only know what you show them. If you walk confidently, they'll think, “Wow.” And then you start to feel confident too.<br />
So my mind believes what my body is doing. That's smart.<br />
Yes. Fake confidence today, real confidence tomorrow.<br />
All right. Stand straight. Walk strong. Look ahead, not at the floor.<br />
Now you're getting it. Let's make sure your face matches that feeling. Smile and look people in the eyes.<br />
Oh, I'm actually good at that. I smile a lot.<br />
That's great, Leo. Smiling makes you look friendly, kind, and confident.<br />
Just smiling does all that?<br />
Yes. Science shows people like smiling faces more.<br />
That sounds like the happy energy again.<br />
Exactly. Your smile is how people see that energy.<br />
So my smile is like a signal.<br />
A signal without words.<br />
What about eye contact?<br />
It shows confidence and that you're listening.<br />
But if I look too long, it's weird, right?<br />
That's staring. Don't do that. Just look one second longer than feels normal, then look away.<br />
How do I know what's normal?<br />
Look at their eyes, count to three, then look away.<br />
Okay, I'm practicing this.<br />
I'm glad. And for our final one — the most powerful — listen and be kind.<br />
Wait, so the real secret is just being a good person?<br />
Yes. Your personality is the final key.<br />
How so?<br />
When you really listen, people feel important. They'll remember that feeling and connect it to you.<br />
So I make people feel good by listening.<br />
Exactly. Kindness stays longer in people's minds than any clothes.<br />
Can you give an example?<br />
When your friend talks, don't look at your phone. Look at them. Nod. Ask questions. Show you care.<br />
Wow. People remember how I make them feel.<br />
And if you make them feel heard and valued, they'll want to be around you. That can be more beautiful than a perfect face.<br />
I get it now, Gwen. Looking good isn't just about the outside.<br />
Almost. It's about both.<br />
Let's remind everyone: you don't need to change everything.<br />
Just a few small things can change how people see you.<br />
Being good-looking isn't about being rich or perfect. It's about being clean, having good energy, and making people feel good around you.<br />
So here's our challenge: choose one thing from these eight and try it today. Just one.<br />
Stand straight, smile more, or really listen. The effect will come faster than you think.<br />
You don't need to be rich or perfect. Just care about yourself and others.<br />
Try one today and see how people react.<br />
