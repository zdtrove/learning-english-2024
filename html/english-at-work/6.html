🎧 <span>Welcome</span> back to Tip Top <span>Trading</span> where everyone <span>seems</span> a bit <span>flustered</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>…and</span> we really need the best <span>biscuits</span> there are.<br/>
🎧 Yes, and <span>I've</span> made sure <span>there's</span> tea and <span>coffee<br/></span>...
🎧 <span>…and</span> the <span>carpets</span>?<br/>
🎧 Uh?<br/>
🎧 <span>…have</span> they been <span>cleaned</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Don't</span> <span>panic</span> Paul, all taken <span>care</span> of.<br/>
🎧 You see, the big <span>boss</span> from <span>America</span>, Mr <span>Socrates</span>, is in <span>town</span> and everything must be just right. <span>What's</span> he like Anna?<br/>
🎧 Well, so <span>far</span> he <span>seems</span> OK. A bit <span>bossy</span>, quite short <span>and</span>... a bit <span>smelly</span>!<br/>
🎧 Well, he did just fly in from the <span>States</span>. But you <span>booked</span> him into a good <span>hotel</span> so <span>hopefully</span> he's had a <span>chance</span> to <span>clean</span> up.<br/>
🎧 I hope so! Oh, I had better get that. Hello? Ah hello Mr <span>Socrates</span>, did you <span>sleep</span> well? Oh! I <span>see</span>... I <span>see</span>... <span>erm</span>... well... oh, I don't <span>know</span>... Tom said it was <span>five-star</span>... well... <span>OK</span>... <span>goodb-</span> Oh, he's <span>hung</span> up.<br/>
🎧 Everything OK Anna? You look a bit <span>pale</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was Mr <span>Socrates</span>. <span>He's</span> not happy.<br/>
🎧 <span>Golly</span> <span>gosh</span>, oh <span>dear</span>. <span>What's</span> the <span>matter</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>It's</span> his <span>hotel</span> room. He <span>doesn't</span> like it. The <span>bed's</span> too <span>soft</span>, too small and it's a <span>single</span> room not a <span>twin</span> room.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, he likes to have two <span>beds</span> in the room for some <span>reason</span>.<br/>
🎧 But Tom said he only likes a <span>single</span> bed in the room.<br/>
🎧 Really? Oh no, he <span>insists</span> on a <span>twin</span> <span>–</span> something to do with <span>business</span> <span>partners</span> he says. Anything else?<br/>
🎧 Yes. He says he wanted <span>freshly</span> <span>squeezed</span> <span>orange</span> <span>juice</span> for <span>breakfast</span>, not the <span>stuff</span> out of a <span>carton</span>.<br/>
🎧 Anything <span>else?</span>! A <span>view</span> of <span>Mount</span> <span>Everest</span> <span>perhaps</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, thank you Denise. Well, we really must <span>sort</span> this out. We <span>can't</span> <span>afford</span> to <span>upset</span> Mr <span>Socrates</span>. Now Anna, you <span>chose</span> this <span>hotel</span>, I really think you need to <span>sort</span> out this <span>mess</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>Tom's</span> <span>suggestion<br/></span>...
🎧 Just <span>sort</span> it, quickly. Oh <span>golly</span> <span>gosh</span>, <span>golly</span> <span>gosh</span>.<br/>
🎧 Uh oh Anna. Time to do some <span>complaining</span>. What are you going to say?<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh</span>... I don't know. I'm not very good at <span>complaining</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, Anna. Keep your <span>cool</span> and <span>politely</span> tell the <span>hotel</span> why you're not happy. You could <span>say:<br/></span>
🎧 I'm very <span>disappointed</span> with your <span>service</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>standard</span> of <span>service</span> is not good enough.<br/>
🎧 The room I <span>booked</span> did not meet my <span>expectations<br/></span>
🎧 Good <span>luck</span> Anna!<br/>
🎧 OK. Here <span>goes</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Receptionist<br/></span>
🎧 Hello. <span>Royal</span> <span>Imperial</span> <span>Hotel</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Erm</span>... hello... I want to... I want to <span>complain</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Receptionist<br/></span>
🎧 Really? About what exactly?<br/>
🎧 Your <span>hotel</span>... Well, I mean, a room I <span>booked</span> for my <span>boss</span>. <span>Room</span> <span>101</span>. I'm very <span>disappointed</span> with your <span>service</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Receptionist<br/></span>
🎧 And <span>why's</span> that then?<br/>
🎧 Well, the room <span>isn't</span> like the one I <span>booked</span>. <span>It's</span> just not good enough.<br/>
🎧 <span>Receptionist<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>. <span>Let's</span> have a look at the <span>booking</span>... well your <span>boss</span> got a <span>bed</span>... and <span>breakfast</span> too... a <span>continental</span> <span>breakfast</span> in <span>fact</span>.<br/>
🎧 But the room just <span>didn't</span> meet his <span>expectations</span>... hello?<br/>
🎧 Give me the phone Anna, I'll <span>deal</span> with this. Now hello <span>Miss</span>...?<br/>
🎧 <span>Receptionist<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Miss</span> Fit.<br/>
🎧 <span>Miss</span> Fit? This is the <span>office</span> <span>assis-</span> I mean <span>Manager</span> here. This <span>isn't</span> good enough. My <span>colleague</span> has made it quite <span>clear</span> that the room did not meet our <span>requirements</span> and I would like you to <span>resolve</span> this <span>matter</span> as quickly as <span>possible</span> or I will have to <span>cancel</span> our <span>reservation</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Receptionist<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Sadly</span>, we have no other <span>twin</span> <span>rooms</span> <span>available</span> and <span>anyway<br/></span>...
🎧 Alright, <span>I'd</span> like to speak to your <span>manager</span> please. Really!<br/>
🎧 Good old Denise. I can tell she's done this before but will talking to the <span>manager</span> really <span>sort</span> things out? <span>Let's</span> <span>remind</span> <span>ourselves</span> of some of the <span>phrases</span> you can use when you need to <span>complain:<br/></span>
🎧 I'm very <span>disappointed</span> with your <span>service</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>standard</span> of <span>service</span> is not good enough.<br/>
🎧 The room I <span>booked</span> did not meet my <span>expectations</span>.<br/>
🎧 And to get things <span>sorted</span> you could <span>say:<br/></span>
🎧 I would like this <span>matter</span> <span>resolved</span> as quickly as <span>possible</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Or:<br/></span>
🎧 I would like to <span>cancel</span> my <span>reservation</span> and get a full <span>refund</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Let's</span> see if Denise has <span>sorted</span> things out?<br/>
🎧 So have you <span>managed</span> to <span>sort</span> out Mr <span>Socrates</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, <span>Anna's</span> got him a new room.<br/>
🎧 Thanks Anna, I'll let him know. And what about the <span>orange</span> <span>juice</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Errr<br/></span>...
🎧 <span>Freshly</span> <span>squeezed</span>, every morning!<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>golly</span> <span>gosh</span>, that <span>reminds</span> me, we need some here in the <span>office</span>. <span>He's</span> going to be here any <span>minute</span> and he says he's got some important <span>news</span> for us.<br/>

🎧 Hello again. <span>It's</span> the big day and Mr <span>Socrates</span> is about to <span>arrive</span> at the <span>offices</span> of Tip Top <span>Trading</span> to talk <span>officially</span> to the <span>team</span>. What is he going to say? And more <span>importantly</span>, will he get his <span>freshly</span> <span>squeezed</span> <span>orange</span> <span>juice</span>?<br/>
🎧 Quickly <span>everybody</span>... he's <span>coming</span> out of the <span>lift</span> with Paul.<br/>
🎧 Anna quickly, get a <span>glass</span> of <span>orange</span> <span>juice</span> ready.<br/>
🎧 <span>…and</span> if we come through this <span>door</span> here we get to the <span>office</span> <span>and</span>... morning everyone. I'm sure <span>we've</span> all <span>met</span> Mr <span>Socrates</span> on the day of <span>the</span>... <span>fire</span>... but today everything is a bit <span>calmer</span> and well he's here to say hello.<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 Hi!<br/>
🎧 <span>Biscuit</span> Mr <span>Socrates</span>?<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Biscuit</span>? You mean a <span>goddamn</span> <span>cookie</span>. Thanks.<br/>
🎧 <span>Err</span>, Mr <span>Socrates</span>, I'm Anna. Would you like some <span>orange</span> <span>juice</span> <span>–</span> <span>freshly</span> <span>squeezed</span>?<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 You <span>betcha</span> as long as it's made from <span>Florida</span> <span>oranges</span>. <span>Hey</span>... Anna? <span>Ain't</span> you the girl who <span>booked</span> my <span>hotel</span> room?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, sorry about the bed <span>and<br/></span>...
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 Hey, you got me a new room, it was great. You did a good <span>job</span> there. Well done.<br/>
🎧 Oh thanks.<br/>
🎧 Hello. <span>It's</span> Tom. I <span>recommended</span> the <span>hotel</span>, it was <span>a<br/></span>...
🎧 Tom. Everyone, shall we <span>gather</span> <span>round</span> and hear what Mr <span>Socrates</span> has to say? Please.<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Hey</span>... <span>errr</span>, <span>what's</span> your <span>name<br/></span>...
🎧 Paul.<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 Yeah you. <span>Don't</span> you think I should be <span>sitting</span> in the big <span>chair</span>?<br/>
🎧 Sorry. Yes of course. <span>(Shuffling)</span> There you go.<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 Now. Tip Top <span>Trading</span>. I gotta give it to you <span>straight</span>. Things <span>ain't</span> looking good, in <span>fact</span> the <span>outlook</span> is <span>gloomy</span>. The <span>global</span> <span>recession</span> has <span>led</span> to a <span>meltdown</span> in the <span>plastic</span> <span>fruits</span> <span>sector</span>. And <span>I've</span> got to <span>announce</span> a <span>profit</span> <span>warning</span>. We just <span>ain't</span> <span>selling</span> enough of these <span>bananas</span>, <span>oranges</span> and <span>lemons</span> to make any money.<br/>
🎧 <span>There's</span> a bit of an <span>economic</span> <span>squeeze</span> on <span>lemons</span>!<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 <span>What?</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>(To</span> <span>herself)</span> Oh <span>dear</span>. I'm not sure what he's talking about but it sounds bad.<br/>
🎧 It is Anna. <span>He's</span> <span>delivering</span> some bad <span>news</span> without <span>hiding</span> the <span>truth</span>. <span>That's</span> why he said <span>“I've</span> got to give it to you <span>straight”</span>. He said <span>“the</span> <span>outlook</span> is <span>gloomy”</span> which it <span>means</span> the future <span>doesn't</span> look good. And he <span>mentioned</span> a <span>“profit</span> <span>warning”</span>, which <span>means</span> company <span>profits</span> are probably going to go down.<br/>
🎧 <span>Crikey</span>! That is bad. What does it mean?<br/>
🎧 Just keep <span>listening</span> for now.<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 <span>…so</span>, this <span>calls</span> for <span>action</span>. I'm going to have <span>to<br/></span>...
🎧 <span>(interrupts)</span> Oh no, not me Mr <span>Socrates</span>, <span>I've</span> been a <span>loyal</span> <span>employee</span>, I <span>couldn't</span> <span>face</span> being <span>unemployed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Tom, <span>calm</span> down.<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 I'm not talking about <span>redundancies</span> yet.<br/>
🎧 <span>Gosh</span>, well that <span>calls</span> for another <span>biscuit</span>.<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 My plan <span>is</span>... we're going into <span>Europe</span>.<br/>
🎧 You mean we're <span>moving</span> to <span>Europe</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, no Anna. I think he <span>means</span> we're going to sell <span>plastic</span> <span>fruit</span> to the <span>European</span> <span>market</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh right! Great. Mr <span>Socrates</span>, <span>I've</span> lots of <span>experience</span> with <span>Europe</span>. I had a <span>holiday</span> in <span>Spain</span> <span>once</span>... <span>twice</span> actually.<br/>
🎧 Well we'll have to make sure our <span>phones</span> can make <span>international</span> <span>calls</span>.<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>. I think you're gonna need some help with this, so I'm <span>bringing</span> in my best <span>marketing</span> <span>executive</span>, <span>Rachel</span>. What she <span>doesn't</span> know about <span>selling</span> to <span>Europe</span>, you don't wanna know. <span>She'll</span> be here in a few <span>weeks'</span> time.<br/>
🎧 Do you know if she <span>prefers</span> tea or <span>coffee</span>... or <span>orange</span> <span>juice</span> <span>perhaps</span>?<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 Look <span>Diana<br/></span>...
🎧 <span>Denise<br/></span>...
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 Denise. Like <span>Dennis</span> right? <span>She'll</span> want the best <span>–</span> the best tea, <span>coffee</span>, the best <span>team</span>. I'll <span>expect</span> <span>improved</span> <span>results</span> and <span>profits</span>. If not your <span>necks</span> will be on the <span>line</span> <span>–</span> <span>especially</span> <span>yours</span> Paul.<br/>
🎧 <span>(nervously)</span> Oh, <span>chop</span> <span>chop</span>. <span>We'd</span> better get to work.<br/>
🎧 <span>scary</span>! <span>“Your</span> <span>necks</span> will be on the <span>line”</span> <span>–</span> he <span>means</span> their <span>jobs</span> will be at <span>risk</span> if things don't <span>improve</span>. <span>It's</span> a <span>worrying</span> time for Tip Top <span>Trading</span>. <span>Let's</span> <span>remind</span> <span>ourselves</span> of the <span>phrases</span> Mr <span>Socrates</span> used to <span>deliver</span> bad <span>news:<br/></span>
🎧 <span>I've</span> got to give it to you <span>straight<br/></span>
🎧 The <span>outlook</span> is <span>gloomy<br/></span>
🎧 <span>I've</span> got to <span>announce</span> a <span>profit</span> <span>warning<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Let's</span> hope this new <span>marketing</span> <span>strategy</span> for <span>Europe</span> is going to work. How are you feeling Anna?<br/>
🎧 A little <span>nervous</span>. But I'm going to try my best to make sure this new <span>strategy</span> <span>works</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>That's</span> the <span>spirit</span> Anna!<br/>
🎧 Right everyone. I think we need to take Mr <span>Socrates</span> down to the <span>Rose</span> and <span>Crown</span> after work for a <span>pint</span> or two and show him some <span>true</span> English <span>hospitality</span>. How about it?<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 I don't drink.<br/>
🎧 Ah well, <span>perhaps</span> some <span>lemonade</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>dear</span>. This should be <span>interesting</span>. Until next time, bye!<br/>
<span><br/></span>

🎧 Hello again. Tip Top <span>Trading's</span> big <span>boss</span>, Mr <span>Socrates</span> has <span>announced</span> a new <span>strategy</span> to sell <span>plastic</span> <span>fruit</span> to <span>Europe</span> and <span>hopefully</span> keep the company <span>afloat</span>. But before the <span>real</span> work <span>begins</span> it's time for him to enjoy some good English <span>hospitality</span> at the pub, <span>courtesy</span> of the <span>team</span> from the <span>London</span> <span>office</span>. <span>Let's</span> join them <span>now<br/></span>...
🎧 <span>…Well</span> <span>welcome</span> to the <span>Rose</span> and <span>Crown</span>, it is small, not like one of those <span>bars</span> you get in your <span>country</span>. Can I get you a <span>pint</span> Mr <span>Socrates</span>?<br/>
🎧 A what?<br/>
🎧 A <span>pint</span>. A <span>pint</span> of <span>beer</span>, it's really nice here if you like <span>it<br/></span>...
🎧 I don't drink. Just an <span>orange</span> <span>juice</span>, <span>freshly</span> <span>squeezed</span>.<br/>
🎧 On go on Mr <span>Socrates</span>, one <span>pint</span> <span>won't</span> <span>hurt</span>. <span>You've</span> got to have a <span>pint</span> of <span>beer</span> when you come to a pub.<br/>
🎧 Oh very well. I'll try one. It had better be good.<br/>
🎧 <span>You'll</span> love it. I'll get it. <span>Three</span> <span>pints</span> of your best <span>beer</span> please Mr <span>Landlord</span>. Denise, are you OK getting your own? I'm a bit short of <span>cash</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh</span>... right. Mr <span>Socrates</span>, Anna said she would be along soon. She had some work to <span>finish</span>. <span>She's</span> such a <span>hard</span> <span>worker</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good to hear. She <span>seems</span> like a <span>smart</span> <span>cookie</span>. Now let's try this <span>beer</span> <span>…mmm</span>, not bad, a little <span>warm</span> <span>but</span>... <span>tasty</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, you <span>drank</span> that <span>quickly</span>... would you like another one?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 Hi everyone. Sorry I'm <span>late</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hi Anna. Look Mr <span>Socrates</span> is <span>enjoying</span> our English <span>beer</span>. I think it's going to his <span>head</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>(Loudly)</span> Anna! Our best <span>worker</span>. Get Anna a drink.<br/>
🎧 Yes Mr <span>Socrates</span>. Of course Mr <span>Socrates</span>.<br/>
🎧 Anna, come over here, let's talk.<br/>
🎧 Oh right. What <span>about<br/></span>...
🎧 There you go Anna. I got you some <span>crisps</span> too. So what are we talking about?<br/>
🎧 <span>Nothing</span>. Thank <span>you</span>... bye bye.<br/>
🎧 Oh right. Bye bye. Yes, I'll go and talk to Paul and Denise. I'll just be over here.<br/>
🎧 What a <span>loser</span>. I can tell he's all talk and no <span>action</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>Tom's</span> a good <span>worker</span> really <span>and<br/></span>...
🎧 <span>…and</span> as for Paul. <span>God</span>, what a <span>manager</span>. Always <span>eating</span> <span>cookies</span>. You know he was <span>fired</span> from his last <span>job</span> <span>because<br/></span>...
🎧 Anna, I think he's getting a bit too personal. That <span>beer</span> is <span>making</span> him say things he <span>shouldn't</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know. What should I say?<br/>
🎧 Try saying <span>“it's</span> not <span>appropriate</span> to talk like <span>that”</span> or <span>“could</span> we change the <span>subject</span> <span>please.”<br/></span>
🎧 OK thanks. <span>Erm</span>, Mr <span>Socrates</span> I don't think it's <span>appropriate</span> to talk like that, could we change the <span>subject</span> please?<br/>
🎧 Oh, sorry have I said too much? Maybe we should talk about you. I like you Anna. <span>You're</span> <span>keen</span> but <span>you've</span> got a lot to learn and I think you should <span>wear</span> more <span>black</span> <span>–</span> it makes you <span>look</span>... <span>thinner<br/></span>...
🎧 <span>He's</span> out of order. I think he's saying too much. Ask him to keep the <span>conversation</span> <span>professional</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, good idea. <span>(To</span> Mr <span>Socrates)</span> <span>Erm</span>, Mr <span>Socrates</span>, thank you but can we keep our <span>conversation</span> <span>professional</span>. <span>There's</span> a lot to <span>discuss</span> about our <span>European</span> <span>market</span> <span>strategy</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, right, absolutely right. <span>Anyway</span>, you're gonna have to <span>lead</span> this one not that Tom guy. I'm thinking of <span>firing</span> him, his <span>results</span> ain't that great <span>and<br/></span>...
🎧 <span>…sorry</span> to <span>interrupt</span>, just <span>wondered</span> if you'd like some <span>nuts</span>?<br/>
🎧 Hey Tom, I was just saying to Anna your <span>results</span> <span>haven't</span> been good and I'm thinking <span>of<br/></span>...
🎧 <span>(flustered)</span>... of having another drink... thinking of having another drink. Mr <span>Socrates</span>, did you know Tom actually has a great idea for <span>selling</span> <span>laser-curved</span> <span>oranges</span> to <span>Spain</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>(puzzled)</span> Do I?<br/>
🎧 <span>That's</span> good to hear Tom. <span>Email</span> them to me and I'll check them over <span>tomorrow</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course he will, Mr <span>Socrates</span>. Now how would you like to drink something, <span>errr</span>, less <span>strong</span>? <span>Orange</span> <span>juice</span> <span>perhaps</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Na</span>, I think I'll try some more of the English <span>beer</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think Anna has just done Tom a big <span>favour</span> <span>–</span> she's <span>stopped</span> him getting <span>fired</span> <span>-</span> for now. Sometimes <span>conversations</span> with your <span>boss</span> can get too personal but I think <span>Anna's</span> got the <span>hang</span> of <span>keeping</span> things <span>professional</span>. <span>Here's</span> a <span>reminder</span> of what she <span>said:<br/></span>
🎧 <span>It's</span> not <span>appropriate</span> to talk like that.<br/>
🎧 Could we change the <span>subject</span> please?<br/>
🎧 Can we keep our <span>conversation</span> <span>professional</span> please?<br/>
🎧 So Anna <span>seems</span> to be Mr <span>Socrates's</span> <span>favourite</span> <span>team</span> <span>member</span> but now she's got some <span>explaining</span> to do to Tom.<br/>
🎧 Anna, what were you talking about to Mr <span>Socrates</span>? <span>“Ideas</span> for <span>selling</span> <span>laser-curved</span> <span>oranges</span> to <span>Spain”</span>?<br/>
🎧 He was going to <span>fire</span> you <span>–</span> so I was trying to tell him you had great <span>ideas</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>What?</span>! You <span>helped</span> me? Anna, I don't know what to say. <span>I</span>... <span>I</span>... <span>I<br/></span>...
🎧 Yes?<br/>
🎧 <span>I</span>... need to go back to the <span>office</span> to work on some <span>ideas</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good idea. Keep it <span>professional</span>, <span>eh</span> Tom? Until next time. Bye!<br/>

🎧 Bye bye Mr <span>Socrates</span>. <span>He's</span> <span>flying</span> back to <span>America</span> <span>leaving</span> Tip Top <span>Trading's</span> <span>London</span> <span>team</span> trying to work out how best to focus their <span>business</span> on the <span>European</span> <span>market</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sorry to keep you <span>waiting</span>. I had to go to the <span>airport</span> with Mr <span>Socrates</span> to see him off. We had a good <span>chat</span> in the <span>taxi</span> and he said some very <span>positive</span> things.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes. Like what?<br/>
🎧 <span>Err</span>, well... well, how nice English <span>beer</span> is.<br/>
🎧 Yeah but what about the <span>European</span> <span>marketing</span> <span>strategy</span> <span>–</span> what are we going to do about that?<br/>
🎧 Well, Anna is <span>supposed</span> to <span>lead</span> on that, I'm taking a more <span>biscuitorial</span> <span>control</span> over it.<br/>
🎧 A what?<br/>
🎧 It <span>means</span> you do all the work while he <span>eats</span> all the <span>biscuits</span>!<br/>
🎧 Do you <span>mind</span> Tom. Now, what I'm thinking is we put the <span>feelers</span> out <span>–</span> do some <span>cold</span> <span>calling</span>, see what people are <span>buying</span> at the <span>moment</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Cold</span> <span>calling</span>? But I like to be <span>warm</span> when I'm on the phone.<br/>
🎧 No Anna. <span>Cold</span> <span>calling</span> is when you call <span>prospective</span> <span>clients</span> when <span>they're</span> not <span>expecting</span> you to, to ask them something or to sell them something. I'm very good at <span>calling</span> people.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, usually the <span>hair</span> <span>dresser</span>! So Paul, where do we <span>begin</span>, who do we call first?<br/>
🎧 <span>Track</span> down some <span>potential</span> <span>clients</span> in <span>Europe</span>, see what <span>they're</span> <span>buying</span> now, see what they want in the future. Make them think it's our <span>laser-curved</span> <span>fruit</span> they want!<br/>
🎧 But keep your <span>calls</span> <span>brief</span>, <span>international</span> <span>calls</span> are very <span>expensive</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK Anna, it's time to <span>cold</span> call. What are you going to say?<br/>
🎧 I don't know.<br/>
🎧 Find <span>someone</span> to call, then be <span>pleasant</span> and <span>polite</span>. When you call, ask to speak to the person who <span>deals</span> with <span>buying</span> or <span>purchasing</span>. And then ask that person if they could <span>spare</span> a few <span>minutes</span> of their time.<br/>
🎧 OK. Here <span>goes</span>. <span>(Looking</span> through a <span>telephone</span> <span>directory)</span> <span>Let's</span> have a <span>look</span>... <span>fruit</span> <span>growers</span>, <span>fruit</span> <span>pickers</span>, <span>fruit</span> <span>traders</span>... <span>Fruit</span> <span>Traders</span> <span>International</span>... <span>(Dials</span> <span>number)</span> <span>0-0-4-3-9-8-4-5-5-4-4</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trader<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Bonjour</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>(surprised)</span> Ah, <span>erm</span>, <span>oh</span>....<br/>
🎧 <span>Don't</span> be <span>surprised</span>! <span>You've</span> called a company in <span>France</span>, they speak <span>French</span>. Just ask if it's OK to speak English.<br/>
🎧 Oh hello. Is it <span>possible</span> to speak to you in English?<br/>
🎧 <span>Trader<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Oui</span>... yes.<br/>
🎧 Great. Are you the person who <span>purchases</span> <span>plastic</span> <span>fruit</span> for your company?<br/>
🎧 <span>Trader<br/></span>
🎧 I am. How can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Yes, can you <span>spare</span> a few <span>minutes</span> of your time? I want to sell you some <span>laser-curved</span> <span>fruit</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trader<br/></span>
🎧 <span>What?</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>That's</span> a bit <span>direct</span> Anna. <span>Slow</span> down and tell them your name and why you're <span>calling</span>. Find out something about them. Maybe say <span>“I'd</span> like to tell you about our great new <span>laser-curved</span> <span>fruit”</span>. Ask them <span>“How</span> much <span>plastic</span> <span>fruit</span> do you <span>buy?”</span> and at the end of the call say <span>“thank</span> you for your time. We hope to hear from you <span>soon.”</span> Give it a go Anna.<br/>
🎧 OK. <span>Erm</span>... hello my name is Anna. How are you today?<br/>
🎧 <span>Trader<br/></span>
🎧 Good thank you.<br/>
🎧 <span>That's</span> good. <span>I'd</span> like to tell you about our great new <span>laser-curved</span> <span>fruit</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trader<br/></span>
🎧 Oh yes.<br/>
🎧 Our company is called Tip Top <span>Trading</span> and we are the <span>UK's</span> number <span>1</span> <span>plastic</span> <span>fruit</span> <span>manufacturer</span> <span>–</span> and well, we're so <span>proud</span> of our <span>fruit</span> that <span>we've</span> <span>decided</span> to let the <span>rest</span> of <span>Europe</span> enjoy it too.<br/>
🎧 Very good Anna!<br/>
🎧 We make our <span>fruit</span> <span>using</span> <span>laser-curved</span> <span>technology</span>. In <span>fact</span> <span>we've</span> just <span>launched</span> our best product ever, the <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemon</span> <span>–</span> it looks so <span>real</span> you want to <span>squeeze</span> it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trader<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, <span>lemons</span>, <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna's</span> got the <span>hang</span> of this <span>–</span> she's on <span>fire</span> <span>–</span> I mean, she's doing really well. Her <span>cold</span> <span>calling</span> <span>technique</span> has really <span>warmed</span> up. <span>She's</span> <span>pitched</span> the <span>products</span> now she needs to sell.<br/>
🎧 <span>…so</span> thank you for your time. I hope you may <span>consider</span> us when you next <span>purchase</span> some <span>plastic</span> <span>fruit</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trader<br/></span>
🎧 We will <span>certainly</span> <span>consider</span> your company.<br/>
🎧 Well we hope to hear from you soon. <span>Goodbye</span> <span>(puts</span> phone <span>down)</span>. Tom, Tom, how are you getting on?<br/>
🎧 <span>(On</span> <span>phone/angry)</span> <span>…well</span> if <span>that's</span> what you think then you can <span>shove</span> your <span>kumquats</span>... hello? Hello? <span>(Slams</span> phone <span>down)<br/></span>
🎧 <span>What's</span> wrong?<br/>
🎧 <span>They've</span> <span>hung</span> up on me. Really! He said the <span>plastic</span> <span>fruit</span> <span>industry</span> is in <span>meltdown</span>. But Anna, if I don't get any <span>contracts</span> soon I'll be <span>fired</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, this <span>calls</span> for <span>teamwork</span> Tom <span>–</span> <span>tomorrow</span>, <span>Tuesday</span>, we're going to <span>tackle</span> this <span>task</span> <span>–</span> together!<br/>
🎧 <span>Hooray</span> for Anna. Now she's <span>sounding</span> like a <span>leader</span>. And she's <span>mastered</span> <span>cold</span> <span>calling</span> by <span>using</span> some simple <span>phrases</span>, like <span>these:<br/></span>
🎧 My name is Anna. Can you <span>spare</span> a few <span>minutes</span> of your time?<br/>
🎧 <span>I'd</span> like to tell you about our great new <span>laser-curved</span> <span>fruit<br/></span>
🎧 How much <span>plastic</span> <span>fruit</span> do you buy?<br/>
🎧 Thank you for your time. We hope to hear from you soon.<br/>
🎧 Phone <span>rings<br/></span>
🎧 Anna. <span>There's</span> a call for you, from <span>someone</span> in <span>France</span>, they want to talk to you about <span>lemons</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sounds <span>promising</span>. Find out what <span>happens</span> next time on English at Work. Bye.<br/>
<span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>(On</span> the <span>phone)</span> Yes, we have <span>plenty</span> in <span>stock</span>. They're <span>£4</span> <span>per</span> <span>unit</span>... They are good <span>quality</span> <span>ones<br/></span>...
🎧 The company in <span>France</span> that Anna called <span>earlier</span> has called her back. Let's hope they're <span>making</span> an order.<br/>
🎧 <span>…laser</span> <span>technology</span> isn't <span>cheap</span>... <span>hmm</span>, I <span>see</span>... Well, thanks for <span>calling</span> back. Bye.<br/>
🎧 Everything OK Anna?<br/>
🎧 Not really. One of the <span>companies</span> I <span>cold</span> called has <span>rung</span> <span>back<br/></span>...
🎧 Good, <span>good<br/></span>...
🎧 <span>…but</span> they don't want to place an order. They say we're too <span>expensive</span>.<br/>
🎧 So you let them go? Didn't you <span>negotiate</span> with them?<br/>
🎧 Oh, was I <span>meant</span> to? I wasn't sure what to say.<br/>
🎧 Having <span>trouble</span> Anna? Don't <span>worry</span>, I'm sure that I can help. <span>Negotiating</span> is my thing!<br/>
🎧 <span>"Negotiating</span> is my <span>thing"</span>! What is he like? <span>Mind</span> you, he has <span>won</span> a <span>Pear</span> <span>Salesman</span> of the Year <span>award</span> so he must be doing something right.<br/>
🎧 Are you sure Tom? Don't you want to <span>negotiate</span> your own <span>deals</span>?<br/>
🎧 I <span>owe</span> you one Anna after you <span>saved</span> my <span>bacon</span> with Mr <span>Socrates</span> the other <span>night</span>. And <span>besides</span> you and <span>me<br/></span>...
🎧 Come on you two. Get a move on. <span>Europe</span> is <span>waiting</span> for us! <span>Custard</span> <span>cream</span> <span>anyone</span>?<br/>
🎧 No thanks. Right. Now you need to call that <span>French</span> company back and ask them what kind of <span>price</span> they are <span>willing</span> to pay.<br/>
🎧 And then say that's fine?<br/>
🎧 No! <span>Negotiate</span>. Say <span>"I</span> don't think we can go that <span>low"</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>"I</span> don't think we can go that <span>low"</span>.<br/>
🎧 If they want a <span>bigger</span> <span>discount</span>, tell them they will have to buy more <span>stock</span>.<br/>
🎧 More <span>stock</span>, <span>bigger</span> <span>discount</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. And if you still can't agree a <span>price</span>, tell them <span>"I'll</span> meet you <span>halfway"</span>.<br/>
🎧 Meet <span>halfway?</span>! That <span>means</span> going to <span>Paris</span>!<br/>
🎧 No. <span>Halfway</span> on the <span>price</span>. That <span>line</span> always <span>works</span> for me. I <span>sold</span> a <span>load</span> of <span>plastic</span> <span>pears</span> that way once.<br/>
🎧 So that's <span>"I'll</span> meet you <span>halfway"</span>. Thanks Tom. I'm really <span>impressed</span>. <span>You</span>... <span>you<br/></span>...
🎧 Am I, <span>really?</span>!<br/>
🎧 What? I was going to say, you really do know your <span>stuff</span> <span>–</span> <span>despite</span> what other people say.<br/>
🎧 What? Uh?<br/>
🎧 Right, I'm off to make that call right now.<br/>
🎧 Good <span>luck</span> Anna and well done Tom! Nice to hear him give some <span>useful</span> advice but will it work? Let's <span>remind</span> <span>ourselves</span> of the <span>phrases</span> he <span>suggested</span> Anna <span>uses</span> when <span>negotiating</span> a <span>sale:<br/></span>
🎧 What kind of <span>price</span> are you <span>willing</span> to pay?<br/>
🎧 I don't think we can go that low.<br/>
🎧 If you buy more <span>stock</span>, I can <span>offer</span> you a <span>bigger</span> <span>discount</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll meet you <span>halfway</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's see how Anna has got on.<br/>
🎧 <span>Success</span>! <span>They've</span> agreed to buy <span>5,000</span> <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemons</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Brilliant</span>. I <span>knew</span> you would be great. Did those <span>killer</span> <span>lines</span> of <span>mine</span> work?<br/>
🎧 <span>Sort</span> of <span>–</span> but when I said what <span>price</span> were they looking to pay, they said the full <span>price</span>! As long as I <span>send</span> them the <span>contract</span> today so I'd better go and get an <span>envelope</span> and <span>post</span> it as soon as I can.<br/>
🎧 Oh great.<br/>
🎧 <span>Tom</span>... <span>Tom</span>... can you come over here to the <span>stationery</span> <span>cupboard</span> and get an <span>envelope</span> from the top <span>shelf</span> for me?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, <span>suppose</span> <span>so</span>... I'm <span>coming</span>... <span>(Door</span> <span>slams</span> <span>shut)</span> <span>…oh</span>!<br/>
🎧 Oh Tom, why did you do that? It won't <span>open</span>... it's <span>locked</span>... help, help!<br/>
🎧 Help!<br/>
🎧 Uh oh. This should be <span>interesting</span>. How are they going to <span>explain</span> being <span>locked</span> in the <span>stationery</span> <span>cupboard</span>? Until next time. Bye!<br/>
🎧 Let us out! We're <span>stuck</span>!<br/>
