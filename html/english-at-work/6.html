🎧 <span>Welcome</span> back to Tip Top <span>Trading</span> where everyone <span>seems</span> a bit <span>flustered</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>…and</span> we really need the best <span>biscuits</span> there are.<br/>
🎧 Yes, and <span>I’ve</span> made sure <span>there’s</span> tea and <span>coffee…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>…and</span> the <span>carpets</span>?<br/>
🎧 Uh?<br/>
🎧 <span>…have</span> they been <span>cleaned</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Don’t</span> <span>panic</span> <span>Paul</span>, all taken <span>care</span> of.<br/>
🎧 You see, the big <span>boss</span> from <span>America</span>, Mr <span>Socrates</span>, is in <span>town</span> and everything must be just right. <span>What’s</span> he like <span>Anna</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, so <span>far</span> he <span>seems</span> OK. A bit <span>bossy</span>, quite short <span>and…</span> a bit <span>smelly</span>!<br/>
🎧 Well, he did just fly in from the <span>States</span>. But you <span>booked</span> him into a good <span>hotel</span> so <span>hopefully</span> <span>he’s</span> had a <span>chance</span> to <span>clean</span> up.<br/>
🎧 I hope so! Oh, I had better get that. <span>Hello</span>? <span>Ah</span> <span>hello</span> Mr <span>Socrates</span>, did you <span>sleep</span> well? Oh! I <span>see…</span> I <span>see…</span> <span>erm…</span> <span>well…</span> oh, I <span>don’t</span> <span>know…</span> <span>Tom</span> said it was <span>five-star…</span> <span>well…</span> <span>OK…</span> <span>goodb-</span> Oh, <span>he’s</span> <span>hung</span> up.<br/>
🎧 Everything OK <span>Anna</span>? You look a bit <span>pale</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was Mr <span>Socrates</span>. <span>He’s</span> not happy.<br/>
🎧 <span>Golly</span> <span>gosh</span>, oh <span>dear</span>. <span>What’s</span> the <span>matter</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>It’s</span> his <span>hotel</span> <span>room</span>. He <span>doesn’t</span> like it. The <span>bed’s</span> too <span>soft</span>, too small and <span>it’s</span> a <span>single</span> <span>room</span> not a <span>twin</span> <span>room</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, he <span>likes</span> to have two <span>beds</span> in the <span>room</span> for some <span>reason</span>.<br/>
🎧 But <span>Tom</span> said he only <span>likes</span> a <span>single</span> bed in the <span>room</span>.<br/>
🎧 Really? Oh no, he <span>insists</span> on a <span>twin</span> <span>–</span> something to do with <span>business</span> <span>partners</span> he <span>says</span>. Anything else?<br/>
🎧 Yes. He <span>says</span> he <span>wanted</span> <span>freshly</span> <span>squeezed</span> <span>orange</span> <span>juice</span> for <span>breakfast</span>, not the <span>stuff</span> out of a <span>carton</span>.<br/>
🎧 Anything <span>else?</span>! A <span>view</span> of <span>Mount</span> <span>Everest</span> <span>perhaps</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, thank you <span>Denise</span>. Well, we really must <span>sort</span> this out. We <span>can’t</span> <span>afford</span> to <span>upset</span> Mr <span>Socrates</span>. Now <span>Anna</span>, you <span>chose</span> this <span>hotel</span>, I really think you need to <span>sort</span> out this <span>mess</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>Tom’s</span> <span>suggestion…<br/></span>
🎧 Just <span>sort</span> it, quickly. Oh <span>golly</span> <span>gosh</span>, <span>golly</span> <span>gosh</span>.<br/>
🎧 Uh oh <span>Anna</span>. Time to do some <span>complaining</span>. What are you going to say?<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh..</span>. I <span>don’t</span> know. <span>I’m</span> not very good at <span>complaining</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>Anna</span>. Keep your <span>cool</span> and <span>politely</span> tell the <span>hotel</span> why <span>you’re</span> not happy. You could <span>say:<br/></span>
🎧 <span>I’m</span> very <span>disappointed</span> with your <span>service</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>standard</span> of <span>service</span> is not good enough.<br/>
🎧 The <span>room</span> I <span>booked</span> did not meet my <span>expectations<br/></span>
🎧 Good <span>luck</span> <span>Anna</span>!<br/>
🎧 OK. Here <span>goes</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Receptionist<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Hello</span>. <span>Royal</span> <span>Imperial</span> <span>Hotel</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Erm..</span>. <span>hello…</span> I want <span>to…</span> I want to <span>complain</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Receptionist<br/></span>
🎧 Really? About what exactly?<br/>
🎧 Your <span>hotel…</span> Well, I mean, a <span>room</span> I <span>booked</span> for my <span>boss</span>. <span>Room</span> <span>101</span>. <span>I’m</span> very <span>disappointed</span> with your <span>service</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Receptionist<br/></span>
🎧 And <span>why’s</span> that then?<br/>
🎧 Well, the <span>room</span> <span>isn’t</span> like the one I <span>booked</span>. <span>It’s</span> just not good enough.<br/>
🎧 <span>Receptionist<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>. <span>Let’s</span> have a look at the <span>booking…</span> well your <span>boss</span> got a <span>bed…</span> and <span>breakfast</span> <span>too…</span> a <span>continental</span> <span>breakfast</span> in <span>fact</span>.<br/>
🎧 But the <span>room</span> just <span>didn’t</span> meet his <span>expectations…</span> <span>hello</span>?<br/>
🎧 Give me the phone <span>Anna</span>, <span>I’ll</span> <span>deal</span> with this. Now <span>hello</span> <span>Miss…</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Receptionist<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Miss</span> Fit.<br/>
🎧 <span>Miss</span> Fit? This is the <span>office</span> <span>assis-</span> I mean <span>Manager</span> here. This <span>isn’t</span> good enough. My <span>colleague</span> has made it quite <span>clear</span> that the <span>room</span> did not meet our <span>requirements</span> and I would like you to <span>resolve</span> this <span>matter</span> as quickly as <span>possible</span> or I will have to <span>cancel</span> our <span>reservation</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Receptionist<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Sadly</span>, we have no other <span>twin</span> <span>rooms</span> <span>available</span> and <span>anyway…<br/></span>
🎧 Alright, <span>I’d</span> like to <span>speak</span> to your <span>manager</span> please. Really!<br/>
🎧 Good old <span>Denise</span>. I can tell <span>she’s</span> done this before but will talking to the <span>manager</span> really <span>sort</span> things out? <span>Let’s</span> <span>remind</span> <span>ourselves</span> of some of the <span>phrases</span> you can use when you need to <span>complain:<br/></span>
🎧 <span>I’m</span> very <span>disappointed</span> with your <span>service</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>standard</span> of <span>service</span> is not good enough.<br/>
🎧 The <span>room</span> I <span>booked</span> did not meet my <span>expectations</span>.<br/>
🎧 And to get things <span>sorted</span> you could <span>say:<br/></span>
🎧 I would like this <span>matter</span> <span>resolved</span> as quickly as <span>possible</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Or:<br/></span>
🎧 I would like to <span>cancel</span> my <span>reservation</span> and get a full <span>refund</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Let’s</span> see if <span>Denise</span> has <span>sorted</span> things out?<br/>
🎧 So have you <span>managed</span> to <span>sort</span> out Mr <span>Socrates</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, <span>Anna’s</span> got him a new <span>room</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks <span>Anna</span>, <span>I’ll</span> let him know. And what about the <span>orange</span> <span>juice</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Errr…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Freshly</span> <span>squeezed</span>, every morning!<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>golly</span> <span>gosh</span>, that <span>reminds</span> me, we need some here in the <span>office</span>. <span>He’s</span> going to be here any <span>minute</span> and he <span>says</span> <span>he’s</span> got some <span>important</span> <span>news</span> for us.<br/>

🎧 <span>Hello</span> again. <span>It’s</span> the big day and Mr <span>Socrates</span> is about to <span>arrive</span> at the <span>offices</span> of Tip Top <span>Trading</span> to talk <span>officially</span> to the <span>team</span>. What is he going to say? And more <span>importantly</span>, will he get his <span>freshly</span> <span>squeezed</span> <span>orange</span> <span>juice</span>?<br/>
🎧 Quickly <span>everybody…</span> <span>he’s</span> <span>coming</span> out of the <span>lift</span> with <span>Paul</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna</span> quickly, get a <span>glass</span> of <span>orange</span> <span>juice</span> ready.<br/>
🎧 <span>…and</span> if we come through this <span>door</span> here we get to the <span>office</span> <span>and…</span> morning everyone. <span>I’m</span> sure <span>we’ve</span> all <span>met</span> Mr <span>Socrates</span> on the day of <span>the…</span> <span>fire…</span> but today everything is a bit <span>calmer</span> and well <span>he’s</span> here to say <span>hello</span>.<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 Hi!<br/>
🎧 <span>Biscuit</span> Mr <span>Socrates</span>?<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Biscuit</span>? You mean a <span>goddamn</span> <span>cookie</span>. Thanks.<br/>
🎧 <span>Err</span>, Mr <span>Socrates</span>, <span>I’m</span> <span>Anna</span>. Would you like some <span>orange</span> <span>juice</span> <span>–</span> <span>freshly</span> <span>squeezed</span>?<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 You <span>betcha</span> as long as <span>it’s</span> made from <span>Florida</span> <span>oranges</span>. <span>Hey…</span> <span>Anna</span>? <span>Ain’t</span> you the girl who <span>booked</span> my <span>hotel</span> <span>room</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, <span>sorry</span> about the bed <span>and…<br/></span>
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 Hey, you got me a new <span>room</span>, it was great. You did a good <span>job</span> there. Well done.<br/>
🎧 Oh thanks.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hello</span>. <span>It’s</span> <span>Tom</span>. I <span>recommended</span> the <span>hotel</span>, it was <span>a…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Tom</span>. Everyone, <span>shall</span> we <span>gather</span> <span>round</span> and hear what Mr <span>Socrates</span> has to say? Please.<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Hey…</span> <span>errr</span>, <span>what’s</span> your <span>name…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Paul</span>.<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 Yeah you. <span>Don’t</span> you think I should be <span>sitting</span> in the big <span>chair</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Sorry</span>. Yes of course. <span>(Shuffling)</span> There you go.<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 Now. Tip Top <span>Trading</span>. I gotta give it to you <span>straight</span>. Things <span>ain’t</span> <span>looking</span> good, in <span>fact</span> the <span>outlook</span> is <span>gloomy</span>. The <span>global</span> <span>recession</span> has <span>led</span> to a <span>meltdown</span> in the <span>plastic</span> <span>fruits</span> <span>sector</span>. And <span>I’ve</span> got to <span>announce</span> a <span>profit</span> <span>warning</span>. We just <span>ain’t</span> <span>selling</span> enough of these <span>bananas</span>, <span>oranges</span> and <span>lemons</span> to make any money.<br/>
🎧 <span>There’s</span> a bit of an <span>economic</span> <span>squeeze</span> on <span>lemons</span>!<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 <span>What?</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>(To</span> <span>herself)</span> Oh <span>dear</span>. <span>I’m</span> not sure what <span>he’s</span> talking about but it sounds bad.<br/>
🎧 It is <span>Anna</span>. <span>He’s</span> <span>delivering</span> some bad <span>news</span> without <span>hiding</span> the <span>truth</span>. <span>That’s</span> why he said <span>“I’ve</span> got to give it to you <span>straight”</span>. He said <span>“the</span> <span>outlook</span> is <span>gloomy”</span> which it <span>means</span> the future <span>doesn’t</span> look good. And he <span>mentioned</span> a <span>“profit</span> <span>warning”</span>, which <span>means</span> <span>company</span> <span>profits</span> are probably going to go down.<br/>
🎧 <span>Crikey</span>! That is bad. What does it mean?<br/>
🎧 Just keep <span>listening</span> for now.<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 <span>…so</span>, this <span>calls</span> for <span>action</span>. <span>I’m</span> going to have <span>to…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>(interrupts)</span> Oh no, not me Mr <span>Socrates</span>, <span>I’ve</span> been a <span>loyal</span> <span>employee</span>, I <span>couldn’t</span> <span>face</span> being <span>unemployed</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Tom</span>, <span>calm</span> down.<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 <span>I’m</span> not talking about <span>redundancies</span> yet.<br/>
🎧 <span>Gosh</span>, well that <span>calls</span> for another <span>biscuit</span>.<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 My plan <span>is…</span> <span>we’re</span> going into <span>Europe</span>.<br/>
🎧 You mean <span>we’re</span> <span>moving</span> to <span>Europe</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, no <span>Anna</span>. I think he <span>means</span> <span>we’re</span> going to sell <span>plastic</span> <span>fruit</span> to the <span>European</span> <span>market</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh right! Great. Mr <span>Socrates</span>, <span>I’ve</span> <span>lots</span> of <span>experience</span> with <span>Europe</span>. I had a <span>holiday</span> in <span>Spain</span> <span>once…</span> <span>twice</span> <span>actually</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well <span>we’ll</span> have to make sure our <span>phones</span> can make <span>international</span> <span>calls</span>.<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>. I think <span>you’re</span> gonna need some help with this, so <span>I’m</span> <span>bringing</span> in my best <span>marketing</span> <span>executive</span>, <span>Rachel</span>. What she <span>doesn’t</span> know about <span>selling</span> to <span>Europe</span>, you <span>don’t</span> wanna know. <span>She’ll</span> be here in a few <span>weeks’</span> time.<br/>
🎧 Do you know if she <span>prefers</span> tea or <span>coffee…</span> or <span>orange</span> <span>juice</span> <span>perhaps</span>?<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 Look <span>Diana…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Denise…<br/></span>
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Denise</span>. Like <span>Dennis</span> right? <span>She’ll</span> want the best <span>–</span> the best tea, <span>coffee</span>, the best <span>team</span>. <span>I’ll</span> <span>expect</span> <span>improved</span> <span>results</span> and <span>profits</span>. If not your <span>necks</span> will be on the <span>line</span> <span>–</span> <span>especially</span> <span>yours</span> <span>Paul</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>(nervously)</span> Oh, <span>chop</span> <span>chop</span>. <span>We’d</span> better get to work.<br/>
🎧 <span>scary</span>! <span>“Your</span> <span>necks</span> will be on the <span>line”</span> <span>–</span> he <span>means</span> their <span>jobs</span> will be at <span>risk</span> if things <span>don’t</span> <span>improve</span>. <span>It’s</span> a <span>worrying</span> time for Tip Top <span>Trading</span>. <span>Let’s</span> <span>remind</span> <span>ourselves</span> of the <span>phrases</span> Mr <span>Socrates</span> used to <span>deliver</span> bad <span>news:<br/></span>
🎧 <span>I’ve</span> got to give it to you <span>straight<br/></span>
🎧 The <span>outlook</span> is <span>gloomy<br/></span>
🎧 <span>I’ve</span> got to <span>announce</span> a <span>profit</span> <span>warning<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Let’s</span> hope this new <span>marketing</span> <span>strategy</span> for <span>Europe</span> is going to work. How are you feeling <span>Anna</span>?<br/>
🎧 A little <span>nervous</span>. But <span>I’m</span> going to try my best to make sure this new <span>strategy</span> <span>works</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>That’s</span> the <span>spirit</span> <span>Anna</span>!<br/>
🎧 Right everyone. I think we need to take Mr <span>Socrates</span> down to the <span>Rose</span> and <span>Crown</span> after work for a <span>pint</span> or two and <span>show</span> him some <span>true</span> English <span>hospitality</span>. How about it?<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 I <span>don’t</span> <span>drink</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ah</span> well, <span>perhaps</span> some <span>lemonade</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>dear</span>. This should be <span>interesting</span>. <span>Until</span> next time, <span>bye</span>!<br/>
<span><br/></span>

Tip Top <span>Trading’s</span> big <span>boss</span>, Mr <span>Socrates</span> has <span>announced</span> a new <span>strategy</span> to sell <span>plastic</span> <span>fruit</span> to <span>Europe</span> and <span>hopefully</span> keep the <span>company</span> <span>afloat</span>. But before the <span>real</span> work <span>begins</span> <span>it’s</span> time for him to enjoy some good English <span>hospitality</span> at the pub, <span>courtesy</span> of the <span>team</span> from the <span>London</span> <span>office</span>. <span>Let’s</span> join them <span>now…<br/></span>

🎧 <span>You’ll</span> love it. <span>I’ll</span> get it. <span>Three</span> <span>pints</span> of your best <span>beer</span> please Mr <span>Landlord</span>. <span>Denise</span>, are you OK getting your own? <span>I’m</span> a bit short of <span>cash</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh…</span> right. Mr <span>Socrates</span>, <span>Anna</span> said she would be along soon. She had some work to <span>finish</span>. <span>She’s</span> such a <span>hard</span> <span>worker</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good to hear. She <span>seems</span> like a <span>smart</span> <span>cookie</span>. Now <span>let’s</span> try this <span>beer</span> <span>…mmm</span>, not bad, a little <span>warm</span> <span>but…</span> <span>tasty</span>.<br/>

🎧 Oh right. <span>Bye</span> <span>bye</span>. Yes, <span>I’ll</span> go and talk to <span>Paul</span> and <span>Denise</span>. <span>I’ll</span> just be over here.<br/>
🎧 What a <span>loser</span>. I can tell <span>he’s</span> all talk and no <span>action</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>Tom’s</span> a good <span>worker</span> really <span>and…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>…and</span> as for <span>Paul</span>. <span>God</span>, what a <span>manager</span>. Always <span>eating</span> <span>cookies</span>. You know he was <span>fired</span> from his last <span>job</span> <span>because…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Anna</span>, I think <span>he’s</span> getting a bit too <span>personal</span>. That <span>beer</span> is <span>making</span> him say things he <span>shouldn’t</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know. What should I say?<br/>
🎧 Try saying <span>“it’s</span> not <span>appropriate</span> to talk like <span>that”</span> or <span>“could</span> we change the <span>subject</span> <span>please.”<br/></span>
🎧 OK thanks. <span>Erm</span>, Mr <span>Socrates</span> I <span>don’t</span> think <span>it’s</span> <span>appropriate</span> to talk like that, could we change the <span>subject</span> please?<br/>
🎧 Oh, <span>sorry</span> have I said too much? Maybe we should talk about you. I like you <span>Anna</span>. <span>You’re</span> <span>keen</span> but <span>you’ve</span> got a lot to learn and I think you should <span>wear</span> more <span>black</span> <span>–</span> it makes you <span>look…</span> <span>thinner…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>He’s</span> out of <span>order</span>. I think <span>he’s</span> saying too much. Ask him to keep the <span>conversation</span> <span>professional</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, good idea. <span>(To</span> Mr <span>Socrates)</span> <span>Erm</span>, Mr <span>Socrates</span>, thank you but can we keep our <span>conversation</span> <span>professional</span>. <span>There’s</span> a lot to <span>discuss</span> about our <span>European</span> <span>market</span> <span>strategy</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, right, absolutely right. <span>Anyway</span>, <span>you’re</span> gonna have to <span>lead</span> this one not that <span>Tom</span> guy. <span>I’m</span> thinking of <span>firing</span> him, his <span>results</span> ain't that great <span>and…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>…sorry</span> to <span>interrupt</span>, just <span>wondered</span> if <span>you’d</span> like some <span>nuts</span>?<br/>
🎧 Hey <span>Tom</span>, I was just saying to <span>Anna</span> your <span>results</span> <span>haven’t</span> been good and <span>I’m</span> thinking <span>of…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>(flustered)…</span> of having another <span>drink…</span> thinking of having another <span>drink</span>. Mr <span>Socrates</span>, did you know <span>Tom</span> <span>actually</span> has a great idea for <span>selling</span> <span>laser-curved</span> <span>oranges</span> to <span>Spain</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>(puzzled)</span> Do I?<br/>
🎧 <span>That’s</span> good to hear <span>Tom</span>. <span>Email</span> them to me and <span>I’ll</span> check them over <span>tomorrow</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course he will, Mr <span>Socrates</span>. Now how would you like to <span>drink</span> something, <span>errr</span>, less <span>strong</span>? <span>Orange</span> <span>juice</span> <span>perhaps</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Na</span>, I think <span>I’ll</span> try some more of the English <span>beer</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think <span>Anna</span> has just done <span>Tom</span> a big <span>favour</span> <span>–</span> <span>she’s</span> <span>stopped</span> him getting <span>fired</span> <span>-</span> for now. Sometimes <span>conversations</span> with your <span>boss</span> can get too <span>personal</span> but I think <span>Anna’s</span> got the <span>hang</span> of <span>keeping</span> things <span>professional</span>. <span>Here’s</span> a <span>reminder</span> of what she <span>said:<br/></span>
🎧 <span>It’s</span> not <span>appropriate</span> to talk like that.<br/>
🎧 Could we change the <span>subject</span> please?<br/>
🎧 Can we keep our <span>conversation</span> <span>professional</span> please?<br/>
🎧 So <span>Anna</span> <span>seems</span> to be Mr <span>Socrates’s</span> <span>favourite</span> <span>team</span> <span>member</span> but now <span>she’s</span> got some <span>explaining</span> to do to <span>Tom</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna</span>, what were you talking about to Mr <span>Socrates</span>? <span>“Ideas</span> for <span>selling</span> <span>laser-curved</span> <span>oranges</span> to <span>Spain”</span>?<br/>
🎧 He was going to <span>fire</span> you <span>–</span> so I was trying to tell him you had great <span>ideas</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>What?</span>! You <span>helped</span> me? <span>Anna</span>, I <span>don’t</span> know what to say. <span>I…</span> <span>I…</span> <span>I…<br/></span>
🎧 Yes?<br/>
🎧 <span>I…</span> need to go back to the <span>office</span> to work on some <span>ideas</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good idea. Keep it <span>professional</span>, <span>eh</span> <span>Tom</span>? <span>Until</span> next time. <span>Bye</span>!<br/>
<span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>Bye</span> <span>bye</span> Mr <span>Socrates</span>. <span>He’s</span> <span>flying</span> back to <span>America</span> <span>leaving</span> Tip Top <span>Trading’s</span> <span>London</span> <span>team</span> trying to work out how best to focus their <span>business</span> on the <span>European</span> <span>market</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sorry</span> to keep you <span>waiting</span>. I had to go to the <span>airport</span> with Mr <span>Socrates</span> to see him off. We had a good <span>chat</span> in the <span>taxi</span> and he said some very <span>positive</span> things.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes. Like what?<br/>
🎧 <span>Err</span>, <span>well…</span> well, how nice English <span>beer</span> is.<br/>
🎧 Yeah but what about the <span>European</span> <span>marketing</span> <span>strategy</span> <span>–</span> what are we going to do about that?<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>Anna</span> is <span>supposed</span> to <span>lead</span> on that, <span>I’m</span> taking a more <span>biscuitorial</span> <span>control</span> over it.<br/>
🎧 A what?<br/>
🎧 It <span>means</span> you do all the work while he <span>eats</span> all the <span>biscuits</span>!<br/>
🎧 Do you <span>mind</span> <span>Tom</span>. Now, what <span>I’m</span> thinking is we put the <span>feelers</span> out <span>–</span> do some <span>cold</span> <span>calling</span>, see what people are <span>buying</span> at the <span>moment</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Cold</span> <span>calling</span>? But I like to be <span>warm</span> when <span>I’m</span> on the phone.<br/>
🎧 No <span>Anna</span>. <span>Cold</span> <span>calling</span> is when you <span>call</span> <span>prospective</span> <span>clients</span> when <span>they’re</span> not <span>expecting</span> you to, to ask them something or to sell them something. <span>I’m</span> very good at <span>calling</span> people.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, usually the <span>hair</span> <span>dresser</span>! So <span>Paul</span>, where do we <span>begin</span>, who do we <span>call</span> first?<br/>
🎧 <span>Track</span> down some <span>potential</span> <span>clients</span> in <span>Europe</span>, see what <span>they’re</span> <span>buying</span> now, see what they want in the future. Make them think <span>it’s</span> our <span>laser-curved</span> <span>fruit</span> they want!<br/>
🎧 But keep your <span>calls</span> <span>brief</span>, <span>international</span> <span>calls</span> are very <span>expensive</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK <span>Anna</span>, <span>it’s</span> time to <span>cold</span> <span>call</span>. What are you going to say?<br/>
🎧 I <span>don’t</span> know.<br/>
🎧 Find <span>someone</span> to <span>call</span>, then be <span>pleasant</span> and <span>polite</span>. When you <span>call</span>, ask to <span>speak</span> to the person who <span>deals</span> with <span>buying</span> or <span>purchasing</span>. And then ask that person if they could <span>spare</span> a few <span>minutes</span> of their time.<br/>
🎧 OK. Here <span>goes</span>. <span>(Looking</span> through a <span>telephone</span> <span>directory)</span> <span>Let’s</span> have a <span>look…</span> <span>fruit</span> <span>growers</span>, <span>fruit</span> <span>pickers</span>, <span>fruit</span> <span>traders…</span> <span>Fruit</span> <span>Traders</span> <span>International…</span> <span>(Dials</span> <span>number)</span> <span>0-0-4-3-9-8-4-5-5-4-4</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trader<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Bonjour</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>(surprised)</span> <span>Ah</span>, <span>erm</span>, <span>oh…</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Don’t</span> be <span>surprised</span>! <span>You’ve</span> <span>called</span> a <span>company</span> in <span>France</span>, they <span>speak</span> <span>French</span>. Just ask if <span>it’s</span> OK to <span>speak</span> English.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>hello</span>. Is it <span>possible</span> to <span>speak</span> to you in English?<br/>
🎧 <span>Trader<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Oui…</span> yes.<br/>
🎧 Great. Are you the person who <span>purchases</span> <span>plastic</span> <span>fruit</span> for your <span>company</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Trader<br/></span>
🎧 I am. How can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Yes, can you <span>spare</span> a few <span>minutes</span> of your time? I want to sell you some <span>laser-curved</span> <span>fruit</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trader<br/></span>
🎧 <span>What?</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>That’s</span> a bit <span>direct</span> <span>Anna</span>. <span>Slow</span> down and tell them your name and why <span>you’re</span> <span>calling</span>. Find out something about them. Maybe say <span>“I’d</span> like to tell you about our great new <span>laser-curved</span> <span>fruit”</span>. Ask them <span>“How</span> much <span>plastic</span> <span>fruit</span> do you <span>buy?”</span> and at the end of the <span>call</span> say <span>“thank</span> you for your time. We hope to hear from you <span>soon.”</span> Give it a go <span>Anna</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK. <span>Erm…</span> <span>hello</span> my name is <span>Anna</span>. How are you today?<br/>
🎧 <span>Trader<br/></span>
🎧 Good thank you.<br/>
🎧 <span>That’s</span> good. <span>I’d</span> like to tell you about our great new <span>laser-curved</span> <span>fruit</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trader<br/></span>
🎧 Oh yes.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>company</span> is <span>called</span> Tip Top <span>Trading</span> and we are the <span>UK’s</span> <span>number</span> <span>1</span> <span>plastic</span> <span>fruit</span> <span>manufacturer</span> <span>–</span> and well, <span>we’re</span> so <span>proud</span> of our <span>fruit</span> that <span>we’ve</span> <span>decided</span> to let the <span>rest</span> of <span>Europe</span> enjoy it too.<br/>
🎧 Very good <span>Anna</span>!<br/>
🎧 We make our <span>fruit</span> <span>using</span> <span>laser-curved</span> <span>technology</span>. In <span>fact</span> <span>we’ve</span> just <span>launched</span> our best <span>product</span> ever, the <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemon</span> <span>–</span> it looks so <span>real</span> you want to <span>squeeze</span> it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trader<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, <span>lemons</span>, <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna’s</span> got the <span>hang</span> of this <span>–</span> <span>she’s</span> on <span>fire</span> <span>–</span> I mean, <span>she’s</span> doing really well. Her <span>cold</span> <span>calling</span> <span>technique</span> has really <span>warmed</span> up. <span>She’s</span> <span>pitched</span> the <span>products</span> now she needs to sell.<br/>
🎧 <span>…so</span> thank you for your time. I hope you may <span>consider</span> us when you next <span>purchase</span> some <span>plastic</span> <span>fruit</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trader<br/></span>
🎧 We will <span>certainly</span> <span>consider</span> your <span>company</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well we hope to hear from you soon. <span>Goodbye</span> <span>(puts</span> phone <span>down)</span>. <span>Tom</span>, <span>Tom</span>, how are you getting on?<br/>
🎧 <span>(On</span> <span>phone/angry)</span> <span>…well</span> if <span>that’s</span> what you think then you can <span>shove</span> your <span>kumquats…</span> <span>hello</span>? <span>Hello</span>? <span>(Slams</span> phone <span>down)<br/></span>
🎧 <span>What’s</span> wrong?<br/>
🎧 <span>They’ve</span> <span>hung</span> up on me. Really! He said the <span>plastic</span> <span>fruit</span> <span>industry</span> is in <span>meltdown</span>. But <span>Anna</span>, if I <span>don’t</span> get any <span>contracts</span> soon <span>I’ll</span> be <span>fired</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, this <span>calls</span> for <span>teamwork</span> <span>Tom</span> <span>–</span> <span>tomorrow</span>, <span>Tuesday</span>, <span>we’re</span> going to <span>tackle</span> this <span>task</span> <span>–</span> together!<br/>
🎧 <span>Hooray</span> for <span>Anna</span>. Now <span>she’s</span> <span>sounding</span> like a <span>leader</span>. And <span>she’s</span> <span>mastered</span> <span>cold</span> <span>calling</span> by <span>using</span> some simple <span>phrases</span>, like <span>these:<br/></span>
🎧 My name is <span>Anna</span>. Can you <span>spare</span> a few <span>minutes</span> of your time?<br/>
🎧 <span>I’d</span> like to tell you about our great new <span>laser-curved</span> <span>fruit<br/></span>
🎧 How much <span>plastic</span> <span>fruit</span> do you buy?<br/>
🎧 Thank you for your time. We hope to hear from you soon.<br/>

🎧 <span>(On</span> the <span>phone)</span> Yes, we have <span>plenty</span> in <span>stock</span>. They're <span>£4</span> <span>per</span> <span>unit…</span> They are good <span>quality</span> <span>ones…<br/></span>
🎧 The <span>company</span> in <span>France</span> that <span>Anna</span> <span>called</span> <span>earlier</span> has <span>called</span> her back. Let's hope they're <span>making</span> an <span>order</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>…laser</span> <span>technology</span> isn't <span>cheap…</span> <span>hmm</span>, I <span>see…</span> Well, thanks for <span>calling</span> back. <span>Bye</span>.<br/>
🎧 Everything OK <span>Anna</span>?<br/>
🎧 Not really. One of the <span>companies</span> I <span>cold</span> <span>called</span> has <span>rung</span> <span>back…<br/></span>
🎧 Good, <span>good…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>…but</span> they don't want to place an <span>order</span>. They say we're too <span>expensive</span>.<br/>
🎧 So you let them go? Didn't you <span>negotiate</span> with them?<br/>
🎧 Oh, was I <span>meant</span> to? I wasn't sure what to say.<br/>
🎧 Having <span>trouble</span> <span>Anna</span>? Don't <span>worry</span>, I'm sure that I can help. <span>Negotiating</span> is my thing!<br/>
🎧 <span>"Negotiating</span> is my <span>thing"</span>! What is he like? <span>Mind</span> you, he has <span>won</span> a <span>Pear</span> <span>Salesman</span> of the Year <span>award</span> so he must be doing something right.<br/>
🎧 Are you sure <span>Tom</span>? Don't you want to <span>negotiate</span> your own <span>deals</span>?<br/>
🎧 I <span>owe</span> you one <span>Anna</span> after you <span>saved</span> my <span>bacon</span> with Mr <span>Socrates</span> the other <span>night</span>. And <span>besides</span> you and <span>me…<br/></span>
🎧 Come on you two. Get a move on. <span>Europe</span> is <span>waiting</span> for us! <span>Custard</span> <span>cream</span> <span>anyone</span>?<br/>
🎧 No thanks. Right. Now you need to <span>call</span> that <span>French</span> <span>company</span> back and ask them what kind of <span>price</span> they are <span>willing</span> to pay.<br/>
🎧 And then say that's fine?<br/>
🎧 No! <span>Negotiate</span>. Say <span>"I</span> don't think we can go that <span>low"</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>"I</span> don't think we can go that <span>low"</span>.<br/>
🎧 If they want a <span>bigger</span> <span>discount</span>, tell them they will have to buy more <span>stock</span>.<br/>
🎧 More <span>stock</span>, <span>bigger</span> <span>discount</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. And if you still can't agree a <span>price</span>, tell them <span>"I'll</span> meet you <span>halfway"</span>.<br/>
🎧 Meet <span>halfway?</span>! That <span>means</span> going to <span>Paris</span>!<br/>
🎧 No. <span>Halfway</span> on the <span>price</span>. That <span>line</span> always <span>works</span> for me. I <span>sold</span> a <span>load</span> of <span>plastic</span> <span>pears</span> that way once.<br/>
🎧 So that's <span>"I'll</span> meet you <span>halfway"</span>. Thanks <span>Tom</span>. I'm really <span>impressed</span>. <span>You…</span> <span>you…<br/></span>
🎧 Am I, <span>really?</span>!<br/>
🎧 What? I was going to say, you really do know your <span>stuff</span> <span>–</span> <span>despite</span> what other people say.<br/>
🎧 What? Uh?<br/>
🎧 Right, I'm off to make that <span>call</span> right now.<br/>
🎧 Good <span>luck</span> <span>Anna</span> and well done <span>Tom</span>! Nice to hear him give some <span>useful</span> advice but will it work? Let's <span>remind</span> <span>ourselves</span> of the <span>phrases</span> he <span>suggested</span> <span>Anna</span> <span>uses</span> when <span>negotiating</span> a <span>sale:<br/></span>
🎧 What kind of <span>price</span> are you <span>willing</span> to pay?<br/>
🎧 I don't think we can go that low.<br/>
🎧 If you buy more <span>stock</span>, I can <span>offer</span> you a <span>bigger</span> <span>discount</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll meet you <span>halfway</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's see how <span>Anna</span> has got on.<br/>
🎧 <span>Success</span>! <span>They've</span> agreed to buy <span>5,000</span> <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemons</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Brilliant</span>. I <span>knew</span> you would be great. Did those <span>killer</span> <span>lines</span> of <span>mine</span> work?<br/>
🎧 <span>Sort</span> of <span>–</span> but when I said what <span>price</span> were they <span>looking</span> to pay, they said the full <span>price</span>! As long as I <span>send</span> them the <span>contract</span> today so I'd better go and get an <span>envelope</span> and <span>post</span> it as soon as I can.<br/>
🎧 Oh great.<br/>
🎧 <span>Tom…</span> <span>Tom…</span> can you come over here to the <span>stationery</span> <span>cupboard</span> and get an <span>envelope</span> from the top <span>shelf</span> for me?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, <span>suppose</span> <span>so…</span> I'm <span>coming..</span>. <span>(Door</span> <span>slams</span> <span>shut)</span> <span>…oh</span>!<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>Tom</span>, why did you do that? It won't <span>open…</span> it's <span>locked…</span> help, help!<br/>
🎧 Help!<br/>
🎧 Uh oh. This should be <span>interesting</span>. How are they going to <span>explain</span> being <span>locked</span> in the <span>stationery</span> <span>cupboard</span>? <span>Until</span> next time. <span>Bye</span>!<br/>
🎧 Let us out! We're <span>stuck</span>!<br/>
<span><br/></span>
