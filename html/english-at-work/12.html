🎧 <span>Welcome</span> back to English at Work. At the <span>offices</span> of Tip Top <span>Trading</span>, things are a <span>bit</span>... <span>tricky</span>. Denise has been <span>reinstated</span> at the <span>company</span> but now <span>wants</span> to do more than just <span>ordering</span> <span>pens</span>. Tom has other <span>ideas</span> and Anna is just <span>caught</span> in the <span>middle</span>. Who can she <span>turn</span> to? Paul <span>maybe</span>... or maybe not? <span><br/></span>
🎧 So Denise, let's get this <span>straight</span>. You don't want to <span>order</span> the <span>pens</span> <span>anymore</span>, right? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Well, I did say if I came back, I wanted to have a go at doing <span>sales</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Err</span>, yes, you did. That's right.<br/>
🎧 Yeah but we got Denise back because we didn't have <span>anyone</span> to <span>order</span> our <span>pens</span> and <span>stuff</span>. That's her <span>main</span> <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Err</span> yes, absolutely. I see your <span>point</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Excuse</span> me Paul, could I <span>suggest</span> we all take it in <span>turns</span> to <span>order</span> things like <span>pens</span> and <span>paper</span>... share the <span>responsibility</span>? <span><br/></span>
🎧 That's a good idea Anna.<br/>
🎧 Yeah <span>but<br/></span>...
🎧 No <span>buts</span> Tom, that's a good <span>solution</span>. Well done <span>Anna</span>... could you <span>draw</span> up a <span>rota</span> so we know who's going to be <span>ordering</span> the <span>pens</span> and when? And don't <span>forget</span> to <span>order</span> <span>biscuits</span> too! <span>Phew</span>, I'm glad I got that <span>sorted</span> out. Right, back to work everyone.<br/>
🎧 I can't <span>believe</span> I've got to <span>order</span> <span>pens</span>, it's <span>Denise's</span> <span>responsibility</span>... <span>err</span>, are you OK Anna?<br/>
🎧 No I'm not. I can't <span>draw</span> up a <span>rota</span>, not now. I've got too much to do.<br/>
🎧 Alright don't <span>panic</span> Anna. Just do what I do.<br/>
🎧 What's that?<br/>
🎧 <span>Nothing</span>! Just do what you can do and then <span>pretend</span> you've <span>forgotten</span> about the other <span>stuff</span>. Easy!<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>dear</span>, <span>Tom's</span> not that <span>professional</span> is he? Not like you Anna. You just need to get <span>organised</span> and <span>prioritise</span>.<br/>
🎧 I need to <span>prioritise</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes. Decide what <span>tasks</span> need doing first and maybe <span>delegate</span> some <span>tasks</span> to <span>others</span>. You could say to people <span>"I've</span> got to <span>prioritise</span>. This is the most <span>important</span> so I'm going to <span>concentrate</span> on this <span>first."</span>, then you could say to <span>someone</span> <span>"It</span> would be a great help if you could take on this other <span>task"</span>. You could also say <span>"I'll</span> have to put off some <span>tasks</span> until <span>tomorrow"</span>. And if you still feel under <span>pressure</span>, say to your <span>boss</span> <span>"I</span> need help, I have too much to <span>do"</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Thanks, good advice. I'm just <span>writing</span> a <span>list</span> of all the things I need to do on my new <span>mini</span> <span>me-pad</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Writing</span> a <span>list</span> is a good place to start. Good <span>luck</span>!<br/>
🎧 There, that's my <span>list</span> <span>finished</span>. Ah, Denise, sorry to <span>bother</span> you, but you know that <span>rota</span> I was talking about?<br/>
🎧 The one for <span>ordering</span> <span>pens</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's it. Well, I'm so <span>busy</span>, I was <span>wondering</span>... it would be a great <span>help</span>... if you could make a start on this? Please?<br/>
🎧 Of course Anna. As it's you. If it was Tom <span>asking</span>, I would have said no!<br/>
🎧 What's that Denise? Hey Anna, what are we going to do about the <span>designs</span> for that <span>plastic</span> <span>aubergine</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Gosh</span>, our new <span>aubergine</span>. <span>Hmm</span>, I'm going to have to put that off until <span>tomorrow</span> I'm <span>afraid</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh right. Why, have you got something more <span>important</span> for us to do together, <span>eh</span>?<br/>
🎧 No Tom. I've just got to <span>prioritise</span>. This new <span>order</span> from <span>Nice'n'Cheesy</span> is the most <span>important</span>, so I'm going to <span>concentrate</span> on that first. OK?<br/>
🎧 Oh right, yeah sure. Me and you will have to wait until <span>tomorrow</span>! <span>So</span>... <span>so</span>... how's it going with <span>Dave</span> from <span>Computer</span> <span>Support</span>?<br/>
🎧 Very well thanks Tom. Last <span>night</span> he took me somewhere I've never been to before.<br/>
🎧 Really. Nice.<br/>
🎧 Yes, a <span>discount</span> <span>computer</span> <span>shop</span> <span>–</span> he <span>bought</span> me a <span>mini</span> <span>me-pad</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh. Just a <span>'mini'</span> one hey.<br/>
🎧 Now, if you could take more <span>interest</span> in our <span>Nice'n'Cheesy</span> <span>contract</span> than you do in <span>Dave</span>, it would be a great help.<br/>
🎧 Oh yeah, sure, of <span>course</span>... <span>nice'n'sleazy</span>, that's a good name for <span>Dave</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Idiot</span>! Getting <span>organised</span> is <span>important</span> when you have a lot to do. Tell people what you're doing and don't <span>forget</span> to ask for help. Here's a <span>reminder</span> of what Anna <span>said:<br/></span>
🎧 I've got to <span>prioritise</span>. This <span>task</span> is the most <span>important</span> so I'm going to <span>concentrate</span> on this first.<br/>
🎧 It would be a great help if you could do this for me please.<br/>
🎧 I'm going to have to put that off until <span>tomorrow</span> I'm <span>afraid</span>.<br/>
🎧 And don't <span>forget</span>, when you <span>simply</span> have too much to do, tell your <span>boss</span>!<br/>
🎧 Hello Paul, sorry to <span>bother</span> you. I'm a bit <span>worried</span>... I just have too much to do and need some help.<br/>
🎧 Yes of course. I don't want you feeling <span>stressed</span>. Let me <span>think</span>... <span>erm</span>... I know, why don't I do the pen <span>rota</span>?<br/>
🎧 It's OK, Denise has <span>offered</span> to do that.<br/>
🎧 <span>Phew</span>, I mean <span>super</span>! <span>Erm</span>... <span>hmm</span>... well, maybe Tom could help you with the <span>launch</span> <span>party</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Launch</span> <span>party</span>? What <span>launch</span> <span>party</span>?<br/>
🎧 Didn't Tom tell you?<br/>
🎧 No, he didn't.<br/>
🎧 We're <span>launching</span> the <span>plastic</span> <span>aubergine</span> on <span>Friday</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh no!<br/>
🎧 Keep <span>calm</span> Anna! We're here to help <span>–</span> although <span>organising</span> a <span>launch</span> <span>party</span> in a week is quite a <span>challenge</span>. Find out how it <span>goes</span> on the next English at Work. Bye!<br/>

🎧 Hello again and <span>welcome</span> to English at Work. The <span>team</span> at Tip Top <span>Trading</span> has lots to do, but now Anna has <span>discovered</span> she has to <span>organise</span> a <span>launch</span> <span>party</span> for the new <span>plastic</span> <span>aubergine</span>. <span>It's</span> taking place at the end of the week and <span>nobody</span> has <span>organised</span> a <span>venue</span> yet! I think Anna is going to need some help. <span><br/></span>
🎧 So Anna, I'm sorry Tom didn't tell you but do you think you can <span>turn</span> something <span>round</span> by <span>Friday</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'll try, but what do I need to do?<br/>
🎧 Oh not much, book a room somewhere, <span>send</span> out some <span>invites</span>... <span>arrange</span> some <span>food</span>... and drink... that <span>sort</span> of thing.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>all?</span>!<br/>
🎧 You can do it <span>-</span> you're great at this kind of thing. And get the <span>team</span> to help.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'll give it a go. See you later.<br/>
🎧 Thanks Anna. And don't <span>forget</span> to <span>order</span> some of those <span>posh</span> <span>Belgian</span> <span>chocolate</span> <span>biscuits</span>, they always go down well with the <span>clients</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>dear</span> Anna. It looks like you have your work cut out.<br/>
🎧 Cut out?<br/>
🎧 I mean, you have a <span>difficult</span> <span>job</span> to do <span>-</span> but as Paul says, you can do it.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Are you OK Anna? You look a bit <span>worried</span>.<br/>
🎧 I am. You <span>forgot</span> to tell me about the <span>product</span> <span>launch</span> on <span>Friday</span> and now Paul <span>wants</span> me to <span>organise</span> it.<br/>
🎧 Did I? Oh sorry. Look, if I can help in any way, just let me know.<br/>
🎧 Well, you could book a <span>venue</span> for the <span>launch</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ahh</span> <span>yeah</span>... just <span>remembered</span>, I've got some <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemons</span> I need to <span>send</span> out. Maybe later, yeah?<br/>
🎧 How am I going to find a <span>venue</span> for the <span>launch</span> at such short <span>notice</span>?<br/>
🎧 You need to ask for <span>recommendations</span>, <span>search</span> on the <span>internet</span>, or look in the phone <span>directory</span>, and then make a call. You need to say <span>"Could</span> I check <span>availability</span> for your <span>venue</span> <span>please?"</span>, then ask <span>"What</span> <span>business</span> <span>facilities</span> do you <span>have?"</span> and <span>"How</span> many people can the room or <span>venue</span> <span>hold?"</span> You could ask <span>"Can</span> you <span>provide</span> <span>hospitality?"</span> <span>–</span> <span>that's</span> things like food and drink. <span>Finally</span>, don't <span>forget</span> to ask <span>"How</span> much does it <span>cost?"<br/></span>
🎧 Thanks, there's a lot to ask. Hi Denise, I've got to book a <span>venue</span> for our <span>plastic</span> <span>aubergine</span> <span>launch</span>. Have you any <span>ideas</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, my friend <span>Marge</span> <span>works</span> for a <span>hotel</span> <span>company</span> that has <span>conference</span> <span>facilities</span>. You could give her a call. Look, here's her <span>number</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, thanks Denise. Let's give it a <span>try</span>... <span>0–2–0–7–5–6–9–2</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Marge<br/></span>
🎧 Hello, the <span>Pitz</span> <span>Hotel</span>. <span>Margery</span> <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh hi, this is Anna from Tip Top <span>Trading</span>, I'm a friend of <span>Denise's</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Marge<br/></span>
🎧 Oh hi Anna. I've <span>heard</span> all about you. What are you <span>ringing</span> for?<br/>
🎧 I need to check <span>availability</span> for your <span>venue</span> for a <span>product</span> <span>launch</span> we're doing.<br/>
🎧 <span>Marge<br/></span>
🎧 Right! Well, I'm sure I can help. We do have a <span>conference</span> room. When is it for?<br/>
🎧 This <span>Friday</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Marge<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Friday</span>! This <span>Friday</span>? <span>Well</span>... that's a bit <span>tricky:</span> the room is being <span>decorated</span> at the <span>moment</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh.<br/>
🎧 <span>Marge<br/></span>
🎧 But we do have a <span>smaller</span> room that you could use <span>–</span> it's got a <span>lovely</span> <span>view</span> of the car <span>park</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>see</span>... and how many people does it <span>hold</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Marge<br/></span>
🎧 You could <span>easily</span> <span>squeeze</span> in about <span>20</span> people.<br/>
🎧 <span>20</span> people. I <span>guess</span> it will have to do. Do you have any <span>business</span> <span>facilities</span> <span>–</span> somewhere to <span>plug</span> in the <span>laptop</span>, <span>projector</span>, <span>wi-fi</span>, that <span>sort</span> of thing?<br/>
🎧 <span>Marge<br/></span>
🎧 Oh yes, yes, we're very <span>hi-tech</span>. We even have a fax <span>machine</span>!<br/>
🎧 And can you <span>provide</span> <span>hospitality</span> too?<br/>
🎧 <span>Marge<br/></span>
🎧 Of course! We do a <span>'business</span> <span>platter'</span> <span>consisting</span> of <span>orange</span> <span>juice</span>, <span>sandwiches</span>, <span>canapés</span> <span>–</span> that really <span>means</span> <span>cheese</span> and <span>pineapple</span> on <span>sticks</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>wonder</span>, can you also <span>provide</span> <span>Belgian</span> <span>chocolate</span> <span>biscuits</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Marge<br/></span>
🎧 I'm sure we can.<br/>
🎧 That's great! <span>OK</span>... and most <span>importantly</span>, how much does it <span>cost</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Marge<br/></span>
🎧 Well, to book the room for <span>2</span> hours usually <span>costs</span> <span>£1,000</span>. The <span>hospitality</span> is <span>extra</span> but as you're a friend of Denise, I'll <span>throw</span> it in for <span>nothing</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll <span>throw</span> the food and drink <span>in?</span>! Won't that get <span>messy</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Marge<br/></span>
🎧 No <span>-</span> I mean we'll <span>provide</span> it for free. Just don't tell <span>anyone</span>, <span>otherwise</span> everyone will <span>expect</span> it!<br/>
🎧 Well, that's <span>fantastic</span> <span>Marge</span>. Thanks. If you can <span>send</span> us an <span>invoice</span>, we'll <span>sort</span> <span>payment</span> out as soon as <span>possible</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Marge<br/></span>
🎧 Bye Anna, and tell Denise I'll see her for our <span>Zumba</span> class <span>tomorrow</span>.<br/>
🎧 Anna has <span>saved</span> the day again. The <span>launch</span> <span>party</span> for the <span>plastic</span> <span>aubergine</span> can now go <span>ahead</span>. If you're trying to book a <span>venue</span> for a <span>business</span> <span>meeting</span> or <span>product</span> <span>launch</span>, here are some of the <span>phrases</span> you could <span>use:<br/></span>
🎧 Could I check <span>availability</span> for your <span>venue</span> please?<br/>
🎧 What <span>business</span> <span>facilities</span> do you have?<br/>
🎧 How many people can the room or <span>venue</span> <span>hold</span>?<br/>
🎧 Can you <span>provide</span> <span>hospitality</span>?<br/>
🎧 How much does it <span>cost</span>? <span><br/></span>
🎧 So Anna, was <span>Marge</span> any help?<br/>
🎧 Yes. She <span>found</span> me a room and gave me a good <span>deal</span>. We just need to <span>invite</span> our <span>clients</span> now.<br/>
🎧 I can do that. I think it's best if I call them <span>-</span> there's no time to <span>post</span> out <span>invitations</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good idea.<br/>
🎧 But I just need to give <span>Marge</span> a call first, just to check a few things.<br/>
🎧 <span>Typical</span> Denise. <span>Nothing's</span> more <span>urgent</span> than talking to <span>Marge</span>!<br/>
🎧 He can talk! If you need something doing it <span>seems</span> like Anna is the <span>woman</span> you need. Find out what else she is <span>capable</span> of in the next <span>episode</span> of English at Work. Bye!<br/>

🎧 It's that time again for English at Work. Life in the <span>offices</span> of Tip Top <span>Trading</span> is still <span>hectic</span>. There's so much to do and <span>tomorrow</span> the <span>team</span> is <span>launching</span> its new <span>product</span> <span>–</span> the <span>plastic</span> <span>aubergine</span> <span>–</span> so everyone needs to <span>pull</span> their <span>weight</span> and get things done <span>–</span> quickly. The <span>problem</span> is, some people are a bit <span>slow</span> at being <span>quick</span>!<br/>
🎧 Could <span>someone</span> answer that please? I'm on the other <span>line</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well I can't, I'm already on the phone.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, talking to your friend <span>Marge</span>. And I'm <span>busy</span>... <span>errr</span>... <span>writing</span> a <span>business</span> <span>proposal</span>.<br/>
🎧 Could <span>someone</span> just answer that <span>phone</span>... oh, you're all <span>busy</span>. I <span>suppose</span> I'd better do it. Hello? Yes? Really! I'm sorry about that. We'll <span>send</span> <span>someone</span> <span>round</span> right away. Yes, this morning. Bye. Anna, are you free to talk in my <span>office</span> now?<br/>
🎧 Yes Paul. What's wrong?<br/>
🎧 <span>Hold</span> on <span>–</span> I just need a <span>quick</span> <span>bite</span> on a <span>biscuit</span> <span>–</span> that's better. Now, that was <span>Nice'n'Cheesy</span>. They're not happy about how <span>slowly</span> we are <span>processing</span> their <span>order</span>. They need our <span>plastic</span> <span>grapes</span> for an <span>exhibition</span> they're doing at the weekend.<br/>
🎧 But I thought Tom had <span>sorted</span> that out?<br/>
🎧 <span>Clearly</span> not. I need you to <span>pull</span> out all the <span>stops</span> and <span>sort</span> this out.<br/>
🎧 <span>Pull</span> out what <span>stops</span>?<br/>
🎧 I mean do all you can to get this <span>order</span> <span>completed</span>, please.<br/>
🎧 But we've got the <span>aubergine</span> <span>launch</span> <span>tomorrow</span>.<br/>
🎧 Leave that to me and Denise to <span>organise</span>. It'll be <span>in</span>... <span>safe</span> <span>hands</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, I'm not so sure about that. <span>Anyway</span> Anna, your <span>priority</span> now is the <span>order</span> for <span>Nice'n'Cheesy</span>. You're going to have to tell the <span>team</span> <span>"We</span> have an <span>order</span> we need to <span>process</span> <span>urgently"</span>, and <span>"We</span> need to <span>pull</span> out all the <span>stops</span> to get this <span>sorted"</span>. You could also say <span>"This</span> is our <span>number</span> one <span>priority"</span> and then <span>delegate</span> <span>tasks</span> to the <span>team</span> to help you get the <span>order</span> <span>sorted</span>. Good <span>luck</span>!<br/>
🎧 Oh thanks. Tom, I need your help. It's the <span>order</span> for <span>Nice'n'Cheesy</span>, we need to <span>process</span> it <span>urgently</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>order</span>? I <span>sent</span> that out <span>ages</span> ago, with the <span>paperwork</span>.<br/>
🎧 You mean this <span>paperwork</span> Tom, on your <span>desk</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh no! I must have <span>forgotten</span>. I've had so much to do.<br/>
🎧 Well, they're not happy, so we've got to <span>pull</span> out all the <span>stops</span> and get them their <span>grapes</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK but what about the <span>aubergines</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Forget</span> about the <span>aubergines</span>. We've got to get <span>onto</span> this now. It's our <span>number</span> one <span>priority</span>. You go and get the <span>plastic</span> <span>grapes</span> from the <span>warehouse</span>, I'll <span>sort</span> out this <span>paperwork</span>, and I'll meet you <span>downstairs</span> in <span>15</span> <span>minutes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why, where are we going?<br/>
🎧 We're getting a <span>taxi</span> to the <span>offices</span> of <span>Nice'n'Cheesy</span> so we can <span>hand</span> <span>deliver</span> the <span>grapes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh right, but isn't it <span>nearly</span> <span>lunchtime</span>?<br/>
🎧 There's no time for lunch, Tom. We need to do this now!<br/>
🎧 Oh Anna, you're <span>amazing</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>certainly</span> is! Anna has <span>wasted</span> no time in <span>sorting</span> out this <span>problem</span> and that's <span>important</span> if you want to keep your <span>business</span> going. Here's a <span>reminder</span> of some of the <span>phrases</span> Anna <span>used:<br/></span>
🎧 We've got to <span>pull</span> out all the <span>stops</span>.<br/>
🎧 We have an <span>order</span> we need to <span>process</span> <span>urgently</span>.<br/>
🎧 We need to <span>pull</span> out all the <span>stops</span> to get this <span>sorted</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is our <span>number</span> one <span>priority</span>.<br/>
🎧 Tom and Anna have made it to the <span>offices</span> of <span>Nice'n'Cheesy</span>. Let's find out how they're getting on.<br/>
🎧 <span>…so</span> we're really <span>sorry<br/></span>...
🎧 Yeah, really <span>sorry<br/></span>...
🎧 <span>…about</span> the <span>delay</span>, and it won't <span>happen</span> again. And we hope you're <span>pleased</span> with the <span>grapes<br/></span>...
🎧 <span>…and</span> the <span>price</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Jane<br/></span>
🎧 Yes, the <span>price</span> is very <span>competitive</span> and if you can <span>guarantee</span> a bit more <span>'customer</span> <span>care'</span>, then I'm sure we'll be <span>buying</span> from you again.<br/>
🎧 Yes, of course. Thanks very much and sorry again. We hope to see you again soon. Bye!<br/>
🎧 Yeah, yeah, see you.<br/>
🎧 <span>Phew</span>, well done Anna. I think you <span>saved</span> the day once again. Hey, <span>hold</span> on, isn't that your <span>boyfriend</span>, <span>Dave</span> from IT, over there?<br/>
🎧 It is. But who's he with?<br/>
🎧 You mean, who's he <span>holding</span> <span>hands</span> with? It's <span>Julie</span> from <span>accounts</span>!<br/>
🎧 No, it can't <span>be</span>... It is! What's <span>Dave</span> doing with another <span>woman</span>?<br/>
🎧 I <span>dunno</span> <span>–</span> but I never <span>trusted</span> him. Come on Anna, you need a drink <span>–</span> a big one.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>dear</span>. <span>Poor</span> Anna, it looks like <span>Dave's</span> been <span>cheating</span> on her, but she needs to keep a <span>clear</span> <span>head</span> for the big <span>launch</span> of the <span>plastic</span> <span>aubergine</span> <span>tomorrow</span>. Will she be <span>led</span> by her <span>head</span> <span>-</span> or her <span>heart</span>? Find out next time on English at Work. Bye!<br/>

🎧 <span>Welcome</span> back to English at Work. It's an <span>exciting</span> day for Tip Top <span>Trading</span>. It's <span>launching</span> its <span>latest</span> <span>product</span> <span>–</span> the <span>plastic</span> <span>aubergine</span>. The <span>launch</span> is taking place at a <span>swanky</span> <span>hotel;</span> lots of <span>clients</span> have <span>turned</span> up <span>-</span> but there's one <span>important</span> person <span>missing</span>.<br/>
🎧 Has <span>anyone</span> <span>seen</span> Anna?<br/>
🎧 I haven't <span>seen</span> her all morning. Tom, you were with her last.<br/>
🎧 That was last <span>night</span> at the pub. She was <span>drowning</span> her <span>sorrows</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Drowning</span> her <span>sorrows</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah. She saw <span>Dave</span> from IT with another <span>woman</span> <span>–</span> <span>Julie</span> from <span>accounts</span>, actually. She was very <span>upset</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>poor</span> Anna.<br/>
🎧 So you <span>left</span> her <span>drowning</span> in the pub? And who's got the <span>prototype</span> <span>aubergine</span> to show at the <span>launch</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh no! Anna has. It's in her bag. What are we going to do?<br/>
🎧 <span>Panic</span>!<br/>
🎧 No Denise. <span>Calm</span> down. I'll just have to make a start and I'm sure Anna will <span>turn</span> up. OK, here <span>goes</span>. <span>Excuse</span> me everyone, could you all <span>gather</span> <span>round</span>? Our <span>presentation</span> is about to <span>begin</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll change the <span>slides</span> for you on the <span>computer</span> Paul. I'm good with <span>technology</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Okey</span> <span>dokey</span>. <span>Ermm…ladies</span> and <span>gentlemen</span>, thank you for <span>coming</span> to our <span>presentation</span>. We have something very <span>exciting</span> <span>to…ermm…show</span> you and it's not a <span>fruit…ha</span> <span>ha<br/></span>...
🎧 <span>…and</span> here it is <span>–</span> <span>fresh</span> from the <span>factory</span> <span>–</span> our <span>plastic</span> <span>aubergine</span>!<br/>
🎧 Anna, you're just in time.<br/>
🎧 I know. I think I <span>drank</span> a bit too much last <span>night</span> and now I can't <span>remember</span> what to say.<br/>
🎧 Well, you need to <span>convince</span> everyone that this is best <span>product</span> on the <span>market</span> and that it's something they really want. You could say <span>"We</span> <span>believe</span> this high <span>quality</span> <span>product</span> is something your <span>business</span> <span>needs"</span> <span>–</span> and, <span>"Our</span> new <span>product</span> has been <span>designed</span> to the <span>highest</span> <span>specifications"</span> <span>–</span> and tell people that <span>"This</span> <span>product</span> is the perfect <span>decoration</span> on any <span>café</span> or <span>restaurant</span> <span>table"</span> <span>–</span> tell them that, and the <span>orders</span> will come <span>flying</span> in!<br/>
🎧 What? They'll <span>send</span> them by <span>aeroplane</span>?<br/>
🎧 No Anna! Just do your <span>presentation</span> and see what <span>happens</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK then. Yes everyone, this <span>aubergine</span> may look good enough to eat but it is made of the <span>highest</span> <span>quality</span> <span>plastic</span> and I'm <span>convinced</span> it's something your <span>business</span> needs.<br/>
🎧 <span>Err</span> yes, that's right. It may be <span>plastic</span> but it <span>is</span>... <span>fantastic</span>!<br/>
🎧 Thank you Paul. This <span>product</span> has been <span>designed</span> to the <span>highest</span> <span>specifications</span>. It's tough and <span>durable</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Client<br/></span>
🎧 Yeah but why would I want to buy it?<br/>
🎧 <span>'Cos</span> it's <span>cheap</span> <span>mate</span>!<br/>
🎧 No Tom. It's because it is the perfect <span>decoration</span> on any <span>café</span> or <span>restaurant</span> <span>table</span>. It <span>shows</span> you're <span>serious</span> about food.<br/>
🎧 And it doesn't go <span>mouldy</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes. We're taking <span>orders</span> today <span>and</span>... <span>and<br/></span>...
🎧 And? And what, Anna?<br/>
🎧 I don't know what to say next.<br/>
🎧 <span>Offer</span> them a <span>discount</span> and a <span>guarantee</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh right. If you place an <span>order</span> for more than <span>1,000</span>, we can <span>offer</span> you a <span>generous</span> <span>discount</span>. <span>Plus</span>, all our <span>products</span> come with a <span>money-back</span> <span>guarantee</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Client<br/></span>
🎧 I like it!<br/>
🎧 Well done Anna. She gave a <span>clear</span> <span>presentation</span>, and <span>sounded</span> <span>enthusiastic</span> about the <span>product</span>. Here's a <span>reminder</span> of some of the things she <span>said:<br/></span>
🎧 It is made of the <span>highest</span> <span>quality</span> <span>plastic</span> and I'm <span>convinced</span> it's something your <span>business</span> needs.<br/>
🎧 This <span>product</span> has been <span>designed</span> to the <span>highest</span> <span>specifications</span>. It's tough and <span>durable</span>.<br/>

🎧 Thanks for <span>listening</span>. Tom has a few <span>slides</span> to show, which <span>illustrate</span> how the <span>aubergine</span> has been <span>designed</span>. <span>Tom</span>... Tom?<br/>
🎧 Oh no, it's <span>frozen</span>, the <span>slides</span> won't change.<br/>
🎧 <span>Dave<br/></span>
🎧 It's OK, I can fix it, I am the IT guy after all.<br/>
🎧 <span>Dave</span>? What are you doing here? <span>Cheating</span> on Anna like that. Here Anna, give me that <span>aubergine</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Tom, no!<br/>
🎧 There, that's for <span>upsetting</span> Anna.<br/>
🎧 <span>Dave<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Ha</span> <span>ha</span> <span>-</span> <span>missed</span> me!<br/>
🎧 <span>Ha</span>! Well the <span>aubergine's</span> <span>certainly</span> tough and <span>durable</span>.<br/>
🎧 Tom, Anna, I think we'd better talk about this back in my <span>office</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Crikey</span>! That was <span>certainly</span> a <span>spectacular</span> <span>presentation</span>. Let's hope <span>Tom's</span> <span>outburst</span> doesn't <span>stop</span> the <span>orders</span> <span>flying</span> in <span>–</span> but not <span>via</span> the <span>window</span>!

🎧 Hello again and <span>welcome</span> back to English at Work. Last time we <span>heard</span> the <span>team</span> from Tip Top <span>Trading</span> having a <span>smashing</span> time at the <span>launch</span> of its <span>plastic</span> <span>aubergine</span>. Tom <span>threw</span> one at <span>Dave</span> from the IT <span>department</span>, but it <span>missed</span> him and went through a <span>window</span>! It's time for Paul to <span>hand</span> out some <span>harsh</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 That <span>behaviour</span> just isn't on.<br/>
🎧 Sorry <span>Paul</span>... but it was quite funny wasn't it?<br/>
🎧 No it wasn't.<br/>
🎧 Sorry Paul, Tom was just <span>angry</span> with <span>Dave</span>. I thought he <span>liked</span> me but we saw him with <span>Julie</span> from <span>accounts</span>.<br/>
🎧 Really? He <span>seemed</span> such a <span>decent</span> <span>chap</span>... <span>anyway</span>, don't do it again. OK? In the <span>meantime</span>, you're going to have to pay for that <span>broken</span> <span>window</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>What</span>... hey? <span>Bbbut<br/></span>...
🎧 Now, <span>excuse</span> me, I need to take this. Hello, Paul Smith <span>speaking</span>. Ah, Mr <span>Socrates</span>... <span>yes</span>... ah, you've <span>heard<br/></span>...
🎧 <span>Crikey</span>, come on we'd better go.<br/>
🎧 That was a good <span>shot</span> Tom! Looks like it's made an <span>impact</span> on <span>Dave</span>. Look, he's <span>sent</span> Anna some <span>flowers</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh there's a <span>note</span> on it. It says <span>"You</span> can <span>count</span> on <span>me"</span> but no name.<br/>
🎧 That is a <span>strange</span> thing for him to <span>write</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, it is and it's not his <span>handwriting</span>.<br/>
🎧 Maybe a <span>secret</span> <span>admirer</span> <span>eh</span>? I <span>wonder</span> who it could be?<br/>
🎧 Are you OK Paul? You look as <span>white</span> as a <span>sheet</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm not actually. Mr <span>Socrates</span> says he's having a <span>strategic</span> <span>review</span>.<br/>
🎧 A what?<br/>
🎧 He <span>means</span> he's been looking at how the <span>business</span> is <span>operating</span> and how it should <span>operate</span> in the future.<br/>
🎧 That sounds <span>serious</span>.<br/>
🎧 And as <span>part</span> of his <span>review</span>, he says he <span>wants</span> to <span>downsize</span> and he's <span>asked</span> me to... <span>step</span> <span>aside</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why? What are you in the way of?<br/>
🎧 No Anna. To <span>step</span> <span>aside</span> is a <span>polite</span> way of saying to leave your <span>position</span> in the <span>company</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh. I don't <span>understand</span> Paul. Why?<br/>
🎧 He says the <span>company</span> needs new <span>direction</span> and more <span>dynamic</span> <span>leadership</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Crumbs</span> Paul, you can't get more <span>dynamic</span> than you!<br/>
🎧 Tom! But Paul, you've been a great <span>boss</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks Anna. I <span>guess</span> it's the <span>economic</span> <span>climate</span>, we're not <span>making</span> enough money so <span>cutting</span> <span>staff</span> is <span>inevitable</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah but you cut <span>Denise's</span> <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes but we had to get her back because she was <span>necessary</span> for the <span>smooth</span> <span>running</span> of the <span>department</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 But Mr <span>Socrates</span> says I'm <span>'surplus</span> to <span>requirement'</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that doesn't sound <span>good</span>... does it?<br/>
🎧 If <span>Paul's</span> <span>job</span> is <span>'surplus</span> to <span>requirement'</span>, it <span>means</span> his <span>input</span> to the <span>business</span> is no <span>longer</span> <span>needed</span>. So it's not good <span>news</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span> Anna, Mr <span>Socrates</span> <span>wants</span> to know if you got his special <span>message</span>?<br/>
🎧 Special <span>message</span>? The <span>flowers!</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's <span>strange</span>. Why is Mr <span>Socrates</span> <span>sending</span> you <span>flowers</span>?<br/>
🎧 It is a bit <span>strange</span>. <span>Anyway</span>, <span>Paul's</span> <span>news</span> has come as a <span>shock</span> for everyone. Here are some of the <span>phrases</span> Mr <span>Socrates</span> used to <span>break</span> the bad <span>news:<br/></span>
🎧 I've been doing a <span>strategic</span> <span>review</span> of the <span>company</span>.<br/>
🎧 I need to <span>downsize</span>.<br/>
🎧 I need you to <span>step</span> <span>aside</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>company</span> needs a new <span>direction</span> and more <span>dynamic</span> <span>leadership</span>.<br/>
🎧 You are <span>surplus</span> to <span>requirement</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, I'm going to have to call Mr <span>Socrates</span> and find out why he's <span>sent</span> me <span>flowers</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Socrates</span>... who <span>wants</span> me?<br/>
🎧 <span>Erm</span>... hello Mr <span>Socrates</span>... it's Anna here.<br/>
🎧 Anna! My <span>favourite</span> girl. Please call me <span>Brad</span>. So glad you called.<br/>
🎧 I <span>needed</span> to speak to you about the <span>flowers</span> you <span>sent</span> me. I'm very <span>flattered</span> but I don't <span>think<br/></span>...
🎧 The <span>flowers?</span>! Sorry <span>honey</span>, I haven't <span>sent</span> you any <span>flowers</span> but I have <span>sent</span> you an <span>email</span> <span>–</span> have you read it yet?<br/>
🎧 No. What did it say?<br/>
🎧 I was saying that as I'm <span>giving</span> Paul the <span>chop</span>, would you like a <span>promotion</span>?<br/>
🎧 A <span>promotion</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes. You have been an <span>outstanding</span> <span>member</span> of the <span>team</span> so how would you like to be the new <span>manager</span> of Tip Top <span>Trading's</span> <span>London</span> <span>office</span>?<br/>
🎧 What a <span>fantastic</span> <span>opportunity</span> and one that Anna <span>surely</span> can't <span>refuse</span> <span>–</span> or can she? And who did <span>send</span> Anna those <span>flowers</span> with a <span>message</span> saying <span>"You</span> can <span>count</span> on <span>me"</span>? Find out what her answer is in the next English at Work. Bye.<br/>
