🎧 Welcome back to English at Work. At the offices of Tip Top Trading, things are a bit... tricky. Denise has been reinstated at the company but now wants to do more than just ordering pens. Tom has other ideas and Anna is just caught in the middle. Who can she turn to? Paul maybe... or maybe not? <br/>
🎧 So Denise, let's get this straight. You don't want to order the pens anymore, right? <br/>
🎧 Well, I did say if I came back, I wanted to have a go at doing sales.<br/>
🎧 Err, yes, you did. That's right.<br/>
🎧 Yeah but we got Denise back because we didn't have anyone to order our pens and stuff. That's her main job.<br/>
🎧 Err yes, absolutely. I see your point.<br/>
🎧 Excuse me Paul, could I suggest we all take it in turns to order things like pens and paper... share the responsibility? <br/>
🎧 That's a good idea Anna.<br/>
🎧 Yeah but<br/>...
🎧 No buts Tom, that's a good solution. Well done Anna... could you draw up a rota so we know who's going to be ordering the pens and when? And don't forget to order biscuits too! Phew, I'm glad I got that sorted out. Right, back to work everyone.<br/>
🎧 I can't believe I've got to order pens, it's Denise's responsibility... err, are you OK Anna?<br/>
🎧 No I'm not. I can't draw up a rota, not now. I've got too much to do.<br/>
🎧 Alright don't panic Anna. Just do what I do.<br/>
🎧 What's that?<br/>
🎧 Nothing! Just do what you can do and then pretend you've forgotten about the other stuff. Easy!<br/>
🎧 Oh dear, Tom's not that professional is he? Not like you Anna. You just need to get organised and prioritise.<br/>
🎧 I need to prioritise?<br/>
🎧 Yes. Decide what tasks need doing first and maybe delegate some tasks to others. You could say to people "I've got to prioritise. This is the most important so I'm going to concentrate on this first.", then you could say to someone "It would be a great help if you could take on this other task". You could also say "I'll have to put off some tasks until tomorrow". And if you still feel under pressure, say to your boss "I need help, I have too much to do". <br/>
🎧 Thanks, good advice. I'm just writing a list of all the things I need to do on my new mini me-pad.<br/>
🎧 Writing a list is a good place to start. Good luck!<br/>
🎧 There, that's my list finished. Ah, Denise, sorry to bother you, but you know that rota I was talking about?<br/>
🎧 The one for ordering pens?<br/>
🎧 That's it. Well, I'm so busy, I was wondering... it would be a great help... if you could make a start on this? Please?<br/>
🎧 Of course Anna. As it's you. If it was Tom asking, I would have said no!<br/>
🎧 What's that Denise? Hey Anna, what are we going to do about the designs for that plastic aubergine?<br/>
🎧 Gosh, our new aubergine. Hmm, I'm going to have to put that off until tomorrow I'm afraid.<br/>
🎧 Oh right. Why, have you got something more important for us to do together, eh?<br/>
🎧 No Tom. I've just got to prioritise. This new order from Nice'n'Cheesy is the most important, so I'm going to concentrate on that first. OK?<br/>
🎧 Oh right, yeah sure. Me and you will have to wait until tomorrow! So... so... how's it going with Dave from Computer Support?<br/>
🎧 Very well thanks Tom. Last night he took me somewhere I've never been to before.<br/>
🎧 Really. Nice.<br/>
🎧 Yes, a discount computer shop – he bought me a mini me-pad.<br/>
🎧 Oh. Just a 'mini' one hey.<br/>
🎧 Now, if you could take more interest in our Nice'n'Cheesy contract than you do in Dave, it would be a great help.<br/>
🎧 Oh yeah, sure, of course... nice'n'sleazy, that's a good name for Dave!<br/>
🎧 Idiot! Getting organised is important when you have a lot to do. Tell people what you're doing and don't forget to ask for help. Here's a reminder of what Anna said:<br/>
🎧 I've got to prioritise. This task is the most important so I'm going to concentrate on this first.<br/>
🎧 It would be a great help if you could do this for me please.<br/>
🎧 I'm going to have to put that off until tomorrow I'm afraid.<br/>
🎧 And don't forget, when you simply have too much to do, tell your boss!<br/>
🎧 Hello Paul, sorry to bother you. I'm a bit worried... I just have too much to do and need some help.<br/>
🎧 Yes of course. I don't want you feeling stressed. Let me think... erm... I know, why don't I do the pen rota?<br/>
🎧 It's OK, Denise has offered to do that.<br/>
🎧 Phew, I mean super! Erm... hmm... well, maybe Tom could help you with the launch party?<br/>
🎧 Launch party? What launch party?<br/>
🎧 Didn't Tom tell you?<br/>
🎧 No, he didn't.<br/>
🎧 We're launching the plastic aubergine on Friday.<br/>
🎧 Oh no!<br/>
🎧 Keep calm Anna! We're here to help – although organising a launch party in a week is quite a challenge. Find out how it goes on the next English at Work. Bye!<br/>

🎧 Hello again and welcome to English at Work. The team at Tip Top Trading has lots to do, but now Anna has discovered she has to organise a launch party for the new plastic aubergine. It's taking place at the end of the week and nobody has organised a venue yet! I think Anna is going to need some help. <br/>
🎧 So Anna, I'm sorry Tom didn't tell you but do you think you can turn something round by Friday?<br/>
🎧 I'll try, but what do I need to do?<br/>
🎧 Oh not much, book a room somewhere, send out some invites... arrange some food... and drink... that sort of thing.<br/>
🎧 That's all?!<br/>
🎧 You can do it - you're great at this kind of thing. And get the team to help.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'll give it a go. See you later.<br/>
🎧 Thanks Anna. And don't forget to order some of those posh Belgian chocolate biscuits, they always go down well with the clients.<br/>
🎧 Oh dear Anna. It looks like you have your work cut out.<br/>
🎧 Cut out?<br/>
🎧 I mean, you have a difficult job to do - but as Paul says, you can do it.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Are you OK Anna? You look a bit worried.<br/>
🎧 I am. You forgot to tell me about the product launch on Friday and now Paul wants me to organise it.<br/>
🎧 Did I? Oh sorry. Look, if I can help in any way, just let me know.<br/>
🎧 Well, you could book a venue for the launch.<br/>
🎧 Ahh yeah... just remembered, I've got some Imperial Lemons I need to send out. Maybe later, yeah?<br/>
🎧 How am I going to find a venue for the launch at such short notice?<br/>
🎧 You need to ask for recommendations, search on the internet, or look in the phone directory, and then make a call. You need to say "Could I check availability for your venue please?", then ask "What business facilities do you have?" and "How many people can the room or venue hold?" You could ask "Can you provide hospitality?" – that's things like food and drink. Finally, don't forget to ask "How much does it cost?"<br/>
🎧 Thanks, there's a lot to ask. Hi Denise, I've got to book a venue for our plastic aubergine launch. Have you any ideas?<br/>
🎧 Well, my friend Marge works for a hotel company that has conference facilities. You could give her a call. Look, here's her number.<br/>
🎧 Oh, thanks Denise. Let's give it a try... 0–2–0–7–5–6–9–2.<br/>
🎧 Marge<br/>
🎧 Hello, the Pitz Hotel. Margery speaking.<br/>
🎧 Oh hi, this is Anna from Tip Top Trading, I'm a friend of Denise's.<br/>
🎧 Marge<br/>
🎧 Oh hi Anna. I've heard all about you. What are you ringing for?<br/>
🎧 I need to check availability for your venue for a product launch we're doing.<br/>
🎧 Marge<br/>
🎧 Right! Well, I'm sure I can help. We do have a conference room. When is it for?<br/>
🎧 This Friday.<br/>
🎧 Marge<br/>
🎧 Friday! This Friday? Well... that's a bit tricky: the room is being decorated at the moment.<br/>
🎧 Oh.<br/>
🎧 Marge<br/>
🎧 But we do have a smaller room that you could use – it's got a lovely view of the car park.<br/>
🎧 I see... and how many people does it hold?<br/>
🎧 Marge<br/>
🎧 You could easily squeeze in about 20 people.<br/>
🎧 20 people. I guess it will have to do. Do you have any business facilities – somewhere to plug in the laptop, projector, wi-fi, that sort of thing?<br/>
🎧 Marge<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, yes, we're very hi-tech. We even have a fax machine!<br/>
🎧 And can you provide hospitality too?<br/>
🎧 Marge<br/>
🎧 Of course! We do a 'business platter' consisting of orange juice, sandwiches, canapés – that really means cheese and pineapple on sticks.<br/>
🎧 I wonder, can you also provide Belgian chocolate biscuits?<br/>
🎧 Marge<br/>
🎧 I'm sure we can.<br/>
🎧 That's great! OK... and most importantly, how much does it cost?<br/>
🎧 Marge<br/>
🎧 Well, to book the room for 2 hours usually costs £1,000. The hospitality is extra but as you're a friend of Denise, I'll throw it in for nothing.<br/>
🎧 You'll throw the food and drink in?! Won't that get messy?<br/>
🎧 Marge<br/>
🎧 No - I mean we'll provide it for free. Just don't tell anyone, otherwise everyone will expect it!<br/>
🎧 Well, that's fantastic Marge. Thanks. If you can send us an invoice, we'll sort payment out as soon as possible.<br/>
🎧 Marge<br/>
🎧 Bye Anna, and tell Denise I'll see her for our Zumba class tomorrow.<br/>
🎧 Anna has saved the day again. The launch party for the plastic aubergine can now go ahead. If you're trying to book a venue for a business meeting or product launch, here are some of the phrases you could use:<br/>
🎧 Could I check availability for your venue please?<br/>
🎧 What business facilities do you have?<br/>
🎧 How many people can the room or venue hold?<br/>
🎧 Can you provide hospitality?<br/>
🎧 How much does it cost? <br/>
🎧 So Anna, was Marge any help?<br/>
🎧 Yes. She found me a room and gave me a good deal. We just need to invite our clients now.<br/>
🎧 I can do that. I think it's best if I call them - there's no time to post out invitations.<br/>
🎧 Good idea.<br/>
🎧 But I just need to give Marge a call first, just to check a few things.<br/>
🎧 Typical Denise. Nothing's more urgent than talking to Marge!<br/>
🎧 He can talk! If you need something doing it seems like Anna is the woman you need. Find out what else she is capable of in the next episode of English at Work. Bye!<br/>

🎧 It's that time again for English at Work. Life in the offices of Tip Top Trading is still hectic. There's so much to do and tomorrow the team is launching its new product – the plastic aubergine – so everyone needs to pull their weight and get things done – quickly. The problem is, some people are a bit slow at being quick!<br/>
🎧 Could someone answer that please? I'm on the other line.<br/>
🎧 Well I can't, I'm already on the phone.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, talking to your friend Marge. And I'm busy... errr... writing a business proposal.<br/>
🎧 Could someone just answer that phone... oh, you're all busy. I suppose I'd better do it. Hello? Yes? Really! I'm sorry about that. We'll send someone round right away. Yes, this morning. Bye. Anna, are you free to talk in my office now?<br/>
🎧 Yes Paul. What's wrong?<br/>
🎧 Hold on – I just need a quick bite on a biscuit – that's better. Now, that was Nice'n'Cheesy. They're not happy about how slowly we are processing their order. They need our plastic grapes for an exhibition they're doing at the weekend.<br/>
🎧 But I thought Tom had sorted that out?<br/>
🎧 Clearly not. I need you to pull out all the stops and sort this out.<br/>
🎧 Pull out what stops?<br/>
🎧 I mean do all you can to get this order completed, please.<br/>
🎧 But we've got the aubergine launch tomorrow.<br/>
🎧 Leave that to me and Denise to organise. It'll be in... safe hands.<br/>
🎧 Hmm, I'm not so sure about that. Anyway Anna, your priority now is the order for Nice'n'Cheesy. You're going to have to tell the team "We have an order we need to process urgently", and "We need to pull out all the stops to get this sorted". You could also say "This is our number one priority" and then delegate tasks to the team to help you get the order sorted. Good luck!<br/>
🎧 Oh thanks. Tom, I need your help. It's the order for Nice'n'Cheesy, we need to process it urgently.<br/>
🎧 The order? I sent that out ages ago, with the paperwork.<br/>
🎧 You mean this paperwork Tom, on your desk?<br/>
🎧 Oh no! I must have forgotten. I've had so much to do.<br/>
🎧 Well, they're not happy, so we've got to pull out all the stops and get them their grapes.<br/>
🎧 OK but what about the aubergines?<br/>
🎧 Forget about the aubergines. We've got to get onto this now. It's our number one priority. You go and get the plastic grapes from the warehouse, I'll sort out this paperwork, and I'll meet you downstairs in 15 minutes.<br/>
🎧 Why, where are we going?<br/>
🎧 We're getting a taxi to the offices of Nice'n'Cheesy so we can hand deliver the grapes.<br/>
🎧 Oh right, but isn't it nearly lunchtime?<br/>
🎧 There's no time for lunch, Tom. We need to do this now!<br/>
🎧 Oh Anna, you're amazing.<br/>
🎧 She certainly is! Anna has wasted no time in sorting out this problem and that's important if you want to keep your business going. Here's a reminder of some of the phrases Anna used:<br/>
🎧 We've got to pull out all the stops.<br/>
🎧 We have an order we need to process urgently.<br/>
🎧 We need to pull out all the stops to get this sorted.<br/>
🎧 This is our number one priority.<br/>
🎧 Tom and Anna have made it to the offices of Nice'n'Cheesy. Let's find out how they're getting on.<br/>
🎧 …so we're really sorry<br/>...
🎧 Yeah, really sorry<br/>...
🎧 …about the delay, and it won't happen again. And we hope you're pleased with the grapes<br/>...
🎧 …and the price!<br/>
🎧 Jane<br/>
🎧 Yes, the price is very competitive and if you can guarantee a bit more 'customer care', then I'm sure we'll be buying from you again.<br/>
🎧 Yes, of course. Thanks very much and sorry again. We hope to see you again soon. Bye!<br/>
🎧 Yeah, yeah, see you.<br/>
🎧 Phew, well done Anna. I think you saved the day once again. Hey, hold on, isn't that your boyfriend, Dave from IT, over there?<br/>
🎧 It is. But who's he with?<br/>
🎧 You mean, who's he holding hands with? It's Julie from accounts!<br/>
🎧 No, it can't be... It is! What's Dave doing with another woman?<br/>
🎧 I dunno – but I never trusted him. Come on Anna, you need a drink – a big one.<br/>
🎧 Oh dear. Poor Anna, it looks like Dave's been cheating on her, but she needs to keep a clear head for the big launch of the plastic aubergine tomorrow. Will she be led by her head - or her heart? Find out next time on English at Work. Bye!<br/>

🎧 Welcome back to English at Work. It's an exciting day for Tip Top Trading. It's launching its latest product – the plastic aubergine. The launch is taking place at a swanky hotel; lots of clients have turned up - but there's one important person missing.<br/>
🎧 Has anyone seen Anna?<br/>
🎧 I haven't seen her all morning. Tom, you were with her last.<br/>
🎧 That was last night at the pub. She was drowning her sorrows.<br/>
🎧 Drowning her sorrows?<br/>
🎧 Yeah. She saw Dave from IT with another woman – Julie from accounts, actually. She was very upset.<br/>
🎧 Oh poor Anna.<br/>
🎧 So you left her drowning in the pub? And who's got the prototype aubergine to show at the launch?<br/>
🎧 Oh no! Anna has. It's in her bag. What are we going to do?<br/>
🎧 Panic!<br/>
🎧 No Denise. Calm down. I'll just have to make a start and I'm sure Anna will turn up. OK, here goes. Excuse me everyone, could you all gather round? Our presentation is about to begin.<br/>
🎧 I'll change the slides for you on the computer Paul. I'm good with technology.<br/>
🎧 Okey dokey. Ermm…ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming to our presentation. We have something very exciting to…ermm…show you and it's not a fruit…ha ha<br/>...
🎧 …and here it is – fresh from the factory – our plastic aubergine!<br/>
🎧 Anna, you're just in time.<br/>
🎧 I know. I think I drank a bit too much last night and now I can't remember what to say.<br/>
🎧 Well, you need to convince everyone that this is best product on the market and that it's something they really want. You could say "We believe this high quality product is something your business needs" – and, "Our new product has been designed to the highest specifications" – and tell people that "This product is the perfect decoration on any café or restaurant table" – tell them that, and the orders will come flying in!<br/>
🎧 What? They'll send them by aeroplane?<br/>
🎧 No Anna! Just do your presentation and see what happens.<br/>
🎧 OK then. Yes everyone, this aubergine may look good enough to eat but it is made of the highest quality plastic and I'm convinced it's something your business needs.<br/>
🎧 Err yes, that's right. It may be plastic but it is... fantastic!<br/>
🎧 Thank you Paul. This product has been designed to the highest specifications. It's tough and durable.<br/>
🎧 Client<br/>
🎧 Yeah but why would I want to buy it?<br/>
🎧 'Cos it's cheap mate!<br/>
🎧 No Tom. It's because it is the perfect decoration on any café or restaurant table. It shows you're serious about food.<br/>
🎧 And it doesn't go mouldy.<br/>
🎧 Yes. We're taking orders today and... and<br/>...
🎧 And? And what, Anna?<br/>
🎧 I don't know what to say next.<br/>
🎧 Offer them a discount and a guarantee.<br/>
🎧 Oh right. If you place an order for more than 1,000, we can offer you a generous discount. Plus, all our products come with a money-back guarantee.<br/>
🎧 Client<br/>
🎧 I like it!<br/>
🎧 Well done Anna. She gave a clear presentation, and sounded enthusiastic about the product. Here's a reminder of some of the things she said:<br/>
🎧 It is made of the highest quality plastic and I'm convinced it's something your business needs.<br/>
🎧 This product has been designed to the highest specifications. It's tough and durable.<br/>
🎧 It is the perfect decoration on any café or restaurant table.<br/>
🎧 We can offer you a generous discount. Plus, all our products come with a money-back guarantee.<br/>
🎧 Thanks for listening. Tom has a few slides to show, which illustrate how the aubergine has been designed. Tom... Tom?<br/>
🎧 Oh no, it's frozen, the slides won't change.<br/>
🎧 Dave<br/>
🎧 It's OK, I can fix it, I am the IT guy after all.<br/>
🎧 Dave? What are you doing here? Cheating on Anna like that. Here Anna, give me that aubergine. <br/>
🎧 Tom, no!<br/>
🎧 There, that's for upsetting Anna.<br/>
🎧 Dave<br/>
🎧 Ha ha - missed me!<br/>
🎧 Ha! Well the aubergine's certainly tough and durable.<br/>
🎧 Tom, Anna, I think we'd better talk about this back in my office.<br/>
🎧 Crikey! That was certainly a spectacular presentation. Let's hope Tom's outburst doesn't stop the orders flying in – but not via the window! Find out next time on English at Work. Bye! <br/>

🎧 Hello again and welcome back to English at Work. Last time we heard the team from Tip Top Trading having a smashing time at the launch of its plastic aubergine. Tom threw one at Dave from the IT department, but it missed him and went through a window! It's time for Paul to hand out some harsh words.<br/>
🎧 That behaviour just isn't on.<br/>
🎧 Sorry Paul... but it was quite funny wasn't it?<br/>
🎧 No it wasn't.<br/>
🎧 Sorry Paul, Tom was just angry with Dave. I thought he liked me but we saw him with Julie from accounts.<br/>
🎧 Really? He seemed such a decent chap... anyway, don't do it again. OK? In the meantime, you're going to have to pay for that broken window.<br/>
🎧 What... hey? Bbbut<br/>...
🎧 Now, excuse me, I need to take this. Hello, Paul Smith speaking. Ah, Mr Socrates... yes... ah, you've heard<br/>...
🎧 Crikey, come on we'd better go.<br/>
🎧 That was a good shot Tom! Looks like it's made an impact on Dave. Look, he's sent Anna some flowers.<br/>
🎧 Oh there's a note on it. It says "You can count on me" but no name.<br/>
🎧 That is a strange thing for him to write.<br/>
🎧 Hmm, it is and it's not his handwriting.<br/>
🎧 Maybe a secret admirer eh? I wonder who it could be?<br/>
🎧 Are you OK Paul? You look as white as a sheet.<br/>
🎧 I'm not actually. Mr Socrates says he's having a strategic review.<br/>
🎧 A what?<br/>
🎧 He means he's been looking at how the business is operating and how it should operate in the future.<br/>
🎧 That sounds serious.<br/>
🎧 And as part of his review, he says he wants to downsize and he's asked me to... step aside.<br/>
🎧 Why? What are you in the way of?<br/>
🎧 No Anna. To step aside is a polite way of saying to leave your position in the company.<br/>
🎧 Oh. I don't understand Paul. Why?<br/>
🎧 He says the company needs new direction and more dynamic leadership.<br/>
🎧 Crumbs Paul, you can't get more dynamic than you!<br/>
🎧 Tom! But Paul, you've been a great boss.<br/>
🎧 Thanks Anna. I guess it's the economic climate, we're not making enough money so cutting staff is inevitable.<br/>
🎧 Yeah but you cut Denise's job.<br/>
🎧 Yes but we had to get her back because she was necessary for the smooth running of the department.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 But Mr Socrates says I'm 'surplus to requirement'.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that doesn't sound good... does it?<br/>
🎧 If Paul's job is 'surplus to requirement', it means his input to the business is no longer needed. So it's not good news.<br/>
🎧 Anyway Anna, Mr Socrates wants to know if you got his special message?<br/>
🎧 Special message? The flowers!?<br/>
🎧 That's strange. Why is Mr Socrates sending you flowers?<br/>
🎧 It is a bit strange. Anyway, Paul's news has come as a shock for everyone. Here are some of the phrases Mr Socrates used to break the bad news:<br/>
🎧 I've been doing a strategic review of the company.<br/>
🎧 I need to downsize.<br/>
🎧 I need you to step aside.<br/>
🎧 The company needs a new direction and more dynamic leadership.<br/>
🎧 You are surplus to requirement.<br/>
🎧 Right, I'm going to have to call Mr Socrates and find out why he's sent me flowers.<br/>
🎧 Socrates... who wants me?<br/>
🎧 Erm... hello Mr Socrates... it's Anna here.<br/>
🎧 Anna! My favourite girl. Please call me Brad. So glad you called.<br/>
🎧 I needed to speak to you about the flowers you sent me. I'm very flattered but I don't think<br/>...
🎧 The flowers?! Sorry honey, I haven't sent you any flowers but I have sent you an email – have you read it yet?<br/>
🎧 No. What did it say?<br/>
🎧 I was saying that as I'm giving Paul the chop, would you like a promotion?<br/>
🎧 A promotion?<br/>
🎧 Yes. You have been an outstanding member of the team so how would you like to be the new manager of Tip Top Trading's London office?<br/>
🎧 What a fantastic opportunity and one that Anna surely can't refuse – or can she? And who did send Anna those flowers with a message saying "You can count on me"? Find out what her answer is in the next English at Work. Bye.<br/>
