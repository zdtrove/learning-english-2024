🎧 Hello, welcome back to Tip Top Trading where everyone is gossiping about Paul's announcement. Anna is to lead the company's new stock management system for the new laser-curved fruit.<br/>
🎧 (Denise on phone)<br/>
🎧 Yes Anna…the new girl…she's done really well although I don't know what experience she's got….anyway, about the hairdresser you mentioned, oh I loved his aftershave<br/>...
🎧 I can't understand it. I've got all the experience and all the ideas…she's just such a<br/>...
🎧 Tom. Sorry to interrupt, I just wanted to check you're ok with me leading this strategy for stock management.<br/>
🎧 Oh of course. Yeah, you deserve it.<br/>
🎧 That was a nice touch Anna.<br/>
🎧 But Tom, now you must help me.<br/>
🎧 Eh?!<br/>
🎧 Anna! That's not the best way to ask for help. Remember what I've always told you about politeness?<br/>
🎧 Be polite – yes you keep telling me that.<br/>
🎧 And if you want someone to help you, ask them, don't tell them – even if it is Tom!<br/>
🎧 Oh right. I'm in a bit of a panic. I've never done this before. I don't know where to begin.<br/>
🎧 Well start by asking your colleagues for help like this:<br/>
🎧 I would be most grateful if you could give me some help<br/>
🎧 Please could I ask you for some advice?<br/>
🎧 I know you're busy but could you spare me a few minutes of your time please?<br/>
🎧 Go on, give it a try!<br/>
🎧 Right, thanks. I'll try. Erm, excuse me Tom. Sorry about earlier. I'm a little nervous about leading this strategy thing and I would be most grateful if you could give me some help... please?<br/>
🎧 Of course Anna. Why didn't you say, I'd be delighted. I've lost count of the number of projects I've lead over the years.<br/>
🎧 Great, thanks. So... where do you think I should begin?<br/>
🎧 Well, give me a few minutes and I'll just find some of the excellent work I did last year. Basically, you'll just need to copy it. Hold on<br/>...
🎧 Ah Anna... just popping out for some biscuits... err, how's the stock management strategy coming along?<br/>
🎧 Oh very good Paul... actually, please could I ask you for some advice, please?<br/>
🎧 Yes of course... although I don't know if I'll be much use!<br/>
🎧 ... now where did I save those damn documents?<br/>...
🎧 I'm very grateful for this opportunity but I'm a little unsure of where to start. Tom is looking for some his old work but<br/>...
🎧 Really?! To be honest, this isn't Tom's speciality. At a time like this I would ask Denise.<br/>
🎧 Denise!?<br/>
🎧 Yes... she may only be the office assistant but she always has words of wisdom. Right... custard creams or chocolate digestives?<br/>
🎧 What?<br/>
🎧 Biscuits?<br/>
🎧 Oh... custard creams please. Err, Denise, I know you're busy but could you spare a few minutes of your time please?<br/>
🎧 Of course Anna, always happy to help you.<br/>
🎧 Well you know the stock management control system?<br/>
🎧 The one you've now got to work out... well done for getting that!<br/>
🎧 Thanks. I really don't know where to begin. It was OK writing it down for Paul but how do I put it in to practice? There's just too much to do!<br/>
🎧 Calm down Anna. You'll be fine. The first thing you need to do is to look at our current system.<br/>
🎧 Look at our current system. How do I do that?<br/>
🎧 Easy! Just take the lift down to the warehouse and speak to Mr Ingle and then write down what you find – and draw up an action plan of tasks you need to do – like a shopping list – I'm very good at those.<br/>
🎧 Go and see Mr Ingle? Oh do I have to.<br/>
🎧 He's ok really Anna. If you approach him in the right way he won't bite your head off!<br/>
🎧 What? Bite my head off! Oh... well, if he won't bite me... then I suppose I should go and see him. Thanks for your advice Denise, I could kiss you. Right, I'm going to go and see him right now.<br/>
🎧 Make an action plan! A good idea. Well done Denise, you're smarter than you look! And well done Anna, you eventually got the help you needed by using these phrases:<br/>
🎧 I would be most grateful if you could give me some help<br/>
🎧 Please could I ask you for some advice?<br/>
🎧 I know you're busy but could you spare me a few minutes of your time please?<br/>
🎧 Remember, if you're stuck for ideas just ask for help…but maybe not Tom, I wonder how he's getting on?<br/>
🎧 (shouting across room) Here Anna, I've got them. Look, all my ideas from my last stock control project…pages and pages of them. Just copy these, they're brilliant. Anna? Anna!<br/>
🎧 …too late, I've just seen her in the lift. Fancy a custard cream Tom?<br/>
🎧 So Anna is off to speak to the prickly Mr Ingle. Let's hope she uses those phrases to ask for help, otherwise she might get her head bitten off – and it could get very messy! See you next time.<br/>

🎧 Hello, welcome back to Tip Top Trading where Anna is going downstairs to speak to warehouse manager, Mr Ingle. You're looking a bit nervous<br/>...
🎧 I am. Denise says if I speak to him in the wrong way, he might bite my head off!<br/>
🎧 Relax Anna. It's just an expression to mean he might be a bit aggressive.<br/>
🎧 Oh!<br/>
🎧 You'll be fine, just use the right polite phrases... oh, and smile!<br/>
🎧 OK, I will. Oh look here I am<br/>...
🎧 (Warehouse door opens)<br/>
🎧 Mr Ingle, are you there? I'd be most grateful if you could give me some... oh, what's that smell... and smoke... Mr Ingle!<br/>
🎧 Oh, oh (coughs)<br/>
🎧 Mr Ingle. You're smoking!<br/>
🎧 Well... it's my lunch break... so I'm allowed to smoke a cigarette, aren't I?<br/>
🎧 Really? Are you sure?<br/>
🎧 No, he's not Anna! Smoking inside a public building is illegal – it's against the law. It's dangerous too - you've got to do something about this.<br/>
🎧 Oh right. Mmm, er, Mr Ingle, you mustn't smoke... it's wrong.<br/>
🎧 Says who?<br/>
🎧 Err, Me?<br/>
🎧 Anna. You'll have to do better than that. Be polite, but be firm too. Try saying, ‘would you mind not doing that please?'<br/>
🎧 I'll try. Mr Ingle, would you mind not doing that please?<br/>
🎧 Why's that then?<br/>
🎧 He's not being very nice is he? You need to give your reasons. Say, ‘I'm afraid it's against company policy'. Go on you can do it.<br/>
🎧 Mr Ingle... I'm afraid it's against company policy. And... it is actually against the law to smoke here... and... it's not a nice smell, is it?<br/>
🎧 Well, smells OK to me.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm sorry to have to ask you this but you need to put it out.<br/>
🎧 Put what out – the cat?!<br/>
🎧 No. You need to extinguish your cigarette... please.<br/>
🎧 Says who?<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm sure your team wouldn't like to see you breaking the law and besides, it could cause a fire. That would be awful.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I suppose it would.<br/>
🎧 I could get you some nicotine gum if you like?<br/>
🎧 No, it's OK. I'll stub it out... as you asked so nicely.<br/>
🎧 Thank you Mr Ingle. We'll keep it a secret this time, but please don't do it again. I'm afraid it's just not permitted on company premises.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, whatever!<br/>
🎧 Oh and Mr Ingle, I still really like your overalls. Bye!<br/>
🎧 Nice one Anna. You dealt with Mr Ingle really well. You kept your cool and explained the reasons why he shouldn't smoke. Let's hope he doesn't do it again Anna.<br/>
🎧 I hope not. I hate the smell of cigarette smoke. But I never got to ask him about stock management.<br/>
🎧 Well, maybe it's best to leave it for another time?<br/>
🎧 Anna's had a tricky day so far dealing with Mr Ingle but she was firm and fair in the language she used. Here's a reminder of the phrases she used:<br/>
🎧 Would you mind not doing that please?<br/>
🎧 I'm afraid it's against company policy.<br/>
🎧 I'm afraid it's not permitted.<br/>
🎧 Sorry to have to ask you this but<br/>...
🎧 Ah Anna, there you are.... (sniffing) Have you been smoking?<br/>
🎧 No!<br/>
🎧 You smell of cigarette smoke. Look, I know you're under pressure – but smoking in the building is not permitted.<br/>
🎧 Bbbut<br/>...
🎧 We take this very seriously. You had better step in to my office and we'll talk about this.<br/>
🎧 Oh dear! Anna's in trouble for no reason. Let's hope she explains the mix-up, but that means telling Paul about Mr Ingle smoking. This is going to be difficult. Until next time, bye!<br/>

🎧 Welcome back. Things are quite tense at Tip Top Trading today. Paul, the boss, mistakenly thinks Anna's been smoking on company premises and she's trying to explain herself.<br/>
🎧 But, but<br/>...
🎧 Frankly, I'm disappointed with you Anna. You're a hard worker but it doesn't mean you can go against company policy.<br/>
🎧 Anna, remember the phrases we've learnt about a misunderstanding!<br/>
🎧 Oh yes. Paul, I think there's been a misunderstanding.<br/>
🎧 A misunderstanding? How can you explain the smell of cigarette smoke? This is a 'no smoking' building.<br/>
🎧 Let me explain. I went down to the warehouse to speak to Mr Ingle and... well... someone else was smoking.<br/>
🎧 What!? Someone was smoking in the warehouse? Golly gosh, that's highly dangerous. Who was it Anna?<br/>
🎧 Err... well... I can't really say. But I dealt with it and it won't happen again.<br/>
🎧 Yes, you dealt with it very well Anna but can you keep your secret about Mr Ingle safe?<br/>
🎧 Thank you Anna and sorry about the misunderstanding. Would you like a biscuit? Now I really think it's time we had a review of our health and safety procedures.<br/>
🎧 Denise, could you gather everyone round in the meeting room please.<br/>
🎧 (On phone) I'll have to call you back Marge. (Hangs up) Could you all gather in the meeting room please, Paul has something important to say.<br/>
🎧 What is it Denise? Is it about my fantastic sales figures again, huh?<br/>
🎧 I doubt it Tom. It sounded urgent. I'd better bring some tea.<br/>
🎧 Thank you for joining me. Unfortunately, there has been an incident in the warehouse. Someone has been smoking and I'm not happy, so I thought I would remind you of our health and safety procedures.<br/>
🎧 Not this again!<br/>
🎧 Your safety is our responsibility. But to keep safe we must follow some simple rules. Denise, what's the first one?<br/>
🎧 (Slurps tea) If you see a fire, raise the alarm – oh and call the fire service.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, you love seeing those firemen, don't you, Denise!<br/>
🎧 Shhh Tom. Maybe you could tell us the other rule?<br/>
🎧 Oh yeah right. If you hear the fire alarm, get out quick.<br/>
🎧 Not exactly Tom. I think we should walk calmly to our nearest fire exit, following the green signs, go outside and meet at the fire assembly point.<br/>
🎧 Yes, and I will take a register of who is here, using my red pen (slurps tea).<br/>
🎧 Do you mind not slurping Denise?<br/>
🎧 This is thirsty work.<br/>
🎧 Hmm. Now is everyone clear about what to do if there is a fire alarm?<br/>
🎧 It's usually a false alarm anyway.<br/>
🎧 That's not the point. Now Anna, what about smoking?<br/>
🎧 No smoking on company premises. But it wasn't me, it was Mr Ingle.<br/>
🎧 All<br/>
🎧 Mr Ingle!<br/>
🎧 I see, so it was Mr Ingle smoking in the warehouse. You should have told me Anna.<br/>
🎧 Sorry!<br/>
🎧 Right, I'm going to have to look into this. Back to work everyone... oh and take a biscuit with you.<br/>
🎧 So Anna's let the cat out of the bag – Mr Ingle won't be pleased – but at least she now knows what do if a fire breaks out. Here are some of the phrases we've heard today, that can be used in an emergency:<br/>
🎧 If you see a fire, raise the alarm.<br/>
🎧 Walk calmly to your nearest fire exit.<br/>
🎧 Meet at the fire assembly point.<br/>
🎧 No smoking on company premises.<br/>
🎧 Sorry to interrupt Paul... but the fire alarm's going off!<br/>
🎧 Don't panic anyone. Everything will be OK. (On phone) Jane, I'll have to call you back... yes, a bit of a panic. Bye. Quick, where's my red pen?<br/>
🎧 Uh-oh. Those emergency phrases might come in useful sooner than you think. Is this going to be the end of Tip Top Trading, will it really go up in smoke? Find out next time. Bye.<br/>
<br/>

🎧 Tom?<br/>
🎧 Here.<br/>
🎧 Anna? <br/>
🎧 Here Denise.<br/>
🎧 And Paul?<br/>
🎧 Yes, yes I'm here and there's no need to panic. That was just a fire drill – a practice.<br/>
🎧 Phew, Tip Top Trading is safe – for now. It was just a fire drill. What a busy day this is turning out to be. Hey Anna, remember next time it could be for real so are you happy about what to say if you have to take charge?<br/>
🎧 Oh, not really.<br/>
🎧 Just keep calm and say things like:<br/>
🎧 There's no need to panic.<br/>
🎧 Please leave the building and meet outside.<br/>
🎧 Use the stairs not the lift.<br/>
🎧 And when you're outside, you could say: Is anybody missing?<br/>
🎧 OK, thanks, but I hope I'll never need to use them.<br/>
🎧 Well done everyone. Hopefully you all know what to do in the unlikely event of a real fire. Now, to celebrate, I'm off to buy some really nice biscuits for all of us – you know, those special double-choc ones with the little orange bits. Back to work everyone.<br/>
🎧 Honestly! I was in the middle of an important call.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, and you never got see those firemen in action, did you Denise?<br/>
🎧 Look at the time. I really need to get on with my work.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, and I've got to check up on the latest football... I mean share prices. Hold on, can anyone smell smoke?<br/>
🎧 I don't believe it! The fire alarm's gone off again. I'll call you back Marge. Oh, where's Paul when you need him? Anna, you're going to have to take charge.<br/>
🎧 Me? What about Tom?<br/>
🎧 It looks like Tom has gone already.<br/>
🎧 Remember Anna, use those phrases to keep everyone calm and informed about what to do.<br/>
🎧 OK. Err... there's no need to panic. Please leave the building and meet outside.<br/>
🎧 Hold on, I just need to grab my elephant dung notepad and red pen. Come on then Anna, into the lift.<br/>
🎧 No Denise. We must use the stairs not the lift.<br/>
🎧 Oh, with my knees!<br/>
🎧 Jump up Denise, I'll carry you.<br/>
🎧 Could I have your attention please.<br/>
🎧 Louder Anna. This is urgent!<br/>
🎧 Could I have your attention please! I need your full attention. Please stay calm. I'm sure there's not a fire, just a bit of smoke. Is there anybody missing?<br/>
🎧 Well, there's no smoke without fire, hey Tom! Tom? Tom? Has anyone seen Tom? That's Tom coming out of the building and he's carrying someone on his shoulder!<br/>
🎧 It's Mr Ingle from the warehouse!<br/>
🎧 It's OK everyone... I've put the fire out... it was in the warehouse. Mr Ingle had been smoking.<br/>
🎧 Mr Ingle!<br/>

🎧 Err... yeah... sorry.<br/>
🎧 Sorry indeed! Mr Ingle's in serious trouble now. But well done Anna for dealing with that emergency and getting everyone out of the building. Here are some of the phrases she used:<br/>
🎧 There's no need to panic.<br/>
🎧 Please leave the building and meet outside.<br/>
🎧 Use the stairs not the lift.<br/>
🎧 And when you're outside, you could say:<br/>
🎧 Is anybody missing?<br/>
🎧 Seems like Tom is a bit of a hero. He has his uses! But hold on, who's this?<br/>
🎧 Say Honey, looks like I've come at a good time. Have you seen a guy called Paul round here?<br/>
🎧 He's not here, he's gone to buy some... err... biscuits. Can I help?<br/>
🎧 Yeah sugar. I'm Mr Socrates, Paul's boss and I've come to sort this business out.<br/>
🎧 Tom & Denise<br/>
🎧 Mr Socrates!<br/>
🎧 Oh no! The head of the company's in town. This means trouble. See you next time.<br/>

🎧 Hello again. Things haven't been going well at Tip Top Trading. There was a fire in the warehouse, caused by Mr Ingle's cigarette and now Mr Socrates – the big boss from America – has turned up unexpectedly.<br/>
🎧 Mr S<br/>
🎧 So honey, are you...?<br/>
🎧 Anna. I'm Anna, I work here as a sales executive. We haven't met before.<br/>
🎧 Mr S<br/>
🎧 We sure ain't. Looks like I've arrived just in the nick of time.<br/>
🎧 (Out of breath)... what's going on... oh, Mr Socrates! Golly gosh, what an unexpected...<br/>
🎧 Mr S<br/>
🎧 Unexpected alright. Looks like this company is in a mess.<br/>
🎧 Err yes. It was OK when I popped out for some biscuits... erm, would you like one?<br/>
🎧 Mr S<br/>
🎧 Biscuits?! They're cookies man. Look, now what do I have to do to get a triple-shot, organic, skinny cappuccino round here?<br/>
🎧 I'll get you one Mr Socrates.<br/>
🎧 Mr S<br/>
🎧 It's OK honey. I need you to book me a hotel room. You... what's your name again…Paul... can you fetch me one?<br/>
🎧 Right Anna. Booking a room for Mr Socrates. This is something you can't get wrong.<br/>
🎧 Well I've never done it before.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you'll be OK. When you book a room, here's what you could say:<br/>
🎧 Hello, I'd like to check availability and prices for a room please.<br/>
🎧 Does the price include breakfast?<br/>
🎧 Are there any business facilities such as internet and wi-fi?<br/>
🎧 I'd like to go ahead and make the reservation please.<br/>
🎧 OK I'll give it a try. But where shall I look?<br/>
🎧 Try searching on the internet. Look for a five-star hotel. He is a five-star guest after all. Good luck.<br/>
🎧 Thanks. I better get back to the office and get started.<br/>
🎧 Hi Anna.<br/>
🎧 Oh hi Tom. Well done for saving Mr Ingle in that fire. You were very brave.<br/>
🎧 It was nothing really. So... err... what are you doing?<br/>
🎧 I've got to book a hotel for Mr Socrates.<br/>
🎧 No! You know, we must be in trouble. He never visits.<br/>
🎧 Really? So where shall I book him in to?<br/>
🎧 Well my friend runs a fantastic hotel – it's five star! It's called the Royal Imperial. Look, I've got his number. Give him a call, mention my name. You're bound to get a special rate.<br/>
🎧 Thanks Tom.<br/>
🎧 No problem. Oh but don't forget, I've heard Mr S only likes a room with a single bed in it. He gets spooked out if there's another empty bed.<br/>
🎧 Oh right. OK, I might as well give it a try.<br/>
🎧 Receptionist<br/>
🎧 Hello. Royal Imperial Hotel.<br/>
🎧 Oh, hello. I'd like to check availability and rates for a room.<br/>
🎧 Receptionist<br/>
🎧 When for?<br/>
🎧 For three nights from tonight. Your best room please!<br/>
🎧 Receptionist<br/>
🎧 All our rooms are the best! But... yes, we have one. It's £100 a night.<br/>
🎧 Right. I work with Tom…Tom Darcy... his friend runs the hotel. I wondered if you could offer me a special rate?<br/>
🎧 Receptionist<br/>
🎧 Tom Darcy? No I've never heard of him. Sorry, it's still £100.<br/>
🎧 Does the price include breakfast?<br/>
🎧 Receptionist<br/>
🎧 Yes. We offer a full continental breakfast of toast, or bread, oh, and tea…or coffee….and cereal.<br/>
🎧 Oh. And do you have any business facilities?<br/>
🎧 Receptionist<br/>
🎧 Well, we've got paper and pens.<br/>
🎧 I was thinking, internet, wi-fi... shoe-shine?<br/>
🎧 Receptionist<br/>
🎧 Yes. We've got that.<br/>
🎧 Good. And most importantly, is this a single room?<br/>
🎧 Receptionist<br/>
🎧 We've only got twin rooms.<br/>
🎧 Twins? You've only got room for twins?<br/>
🎧 Receptionist<br/>
🎧 No. We could take a bed out and just leave one in, if you want?<br/>
🎧 Oh that would be perfect. In that case, I'd like to go ahead and make a reservation please.<br/>
🎧 Receptionist<br/>
🎧 Good. How would you like to pay?<br/>
🎧 Well done Anna for booking the hotel but I have a feeling Tom's recommendation may not be as luxurious as he says. Let's hear the phrases Anna used when booking a hotel:<br/>
🎧 Hello, I'd like to check availability and prices for a room please.<br/>
🎧 Does the price include breakfast?<br/>
🎧 Are there any business facilities such as internet and wi-fi?<br/>
🎧 I'd like to go ahead and make the reservation please.<br/>
🎧 So the room is booked. I wonder what Mr Socrates will think of it? He's a particularly fussy man as we'll find out next time. Bye!<br/>
<br/>
