🎧 Hello, <span>welcome</span> back to Tip Top <span>Trading</span> where everyone is <span>gossiping</span> about <span>Paul's</span> <span>announcement</span>. Anna is to <span>lead</span> the <span>company's</span> new <span>stock</span> <span>management</span> <span>system</span> for the new <span>laser-curved</span> <span>fruit</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>(Denise</span> on <span>phone)<br/></span>
🎧 Yes <span>Anna…the</span> new <span>girl…she's</span> done really well although I don't know what <span>experience</span> she's <span>got….anyway</span>, about the <span>hairdresser</span> you <span>mentioned</span>, oh I loved his <span>aftershave<br/></span>...
🎧 I <span>can't</span> <span>understand</span> it. <span>I've</span> got all the <span>experience</span> and all the <span>ideas…she's</span> just such <span>a<br/></span>...
🎧 Tom. Sorry to <span>interrupt</span>, I just wanted to check you're ok with me <span>leading</span> this <span>strategy</span> for <span>stock</span> <span>management</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh of course. Yeah, you <span>deserve</span> it.<br/>
🎧 That was a nice touch Anna.<br/>
🎧 But Tom, now you must help me.<br/>
🎧 <span>Eh?</span>!<br/>
🎧 Anna! <span>That's</span> not the best way to ask for help. <span>Remember</span> what <span>I've</span> always told you about <span>politeness</span>?<br/>
🎧 Be <span>polite</span> <span>–</span> yes you keep <span>telling</span> me that.<br/>
🎧 And if you want <span>someone</span> to help you, ask them, don't tell them <span>–</span> even if it is Tom!<br/>
🎧 Oh right. I'm in a bit of a <span>panic</span>. <span>I've</span> never done this before. I don't know where to <span>begin</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well start by <span>asking</span> your <span>colleagues</span> for help like <span>this:<br/></span>
🎧 I would be most <span>grateful</span> if you could give me some <span>help<br/></span>
🎧 Please could I ask you for some advice?<br/>
🎧 I know you're <span>busy</span> but could you <span>spare</span> me a few <span>minutes</span> of your time please?<br/>
🎧 Go on, give it a try!<br/>
🎧 Right, thanks. I'll try. <span>Erm</span>, <span>excuse</span> me Tom. Sorry about <span>earlier</span>. I'm a little <span>nervous</span> about <span>leading</span> this <span>strategy</span> thing and I would be most <span>grateful</span> if you could give me some <span>help</span>... please?<br/>
🎧 Of course Anna. Why <span>didn't</span> you say, <span>I'd</span> be <span>delighted</span>. <span>I've</span> <span>lost</span> <span>count</span> of the number of <span>projects</span> <span>I've</span> <span>lead</span> over the years.<br/>
🎧 Great, thanks. <span>So</span>... where do you think I should <span>begin</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, give me a few <span>minutes</span> and I'll just find some of the <span>excellent</span> work I did last year. <span>Basically</span>, <span>you'll</span> just need to <span>copy</span> it. <span>Hold</span> <span>on<br/></span>...
🎧 Ah <span>Anna</span>... just <span>popping</span> out for some <span>biscuits</span>... <span>err</span>, <span>how's</span> the <span>stock</span> <span>management</span> <span>strategy</span> <span>coming</span> along?<br/>
🎧 Oh very good <span>Paul</span>... actually, please could I ask you for some advice, please?<br/>
🎧 Yes of <span>course</span>... although I don't know if I'll be much use!<br/>
🎧 <span></span>... now where did I <span>save</span> those <span>damn</span> <span>documents?<br/></span>...
🎧 I'm very <span>grateful</span> for this <span>opportunity</span> but I'm a little <span>unsure</span> of where to start. Tom is looking for some his old work <span>but<br/></span>...
🎧 <span>Really?</span>! To be <span>honest</span>, this <span>isn't</span> <span>Tom's</span> <span>speciality</span>. At a time like this I would ask Denise.<br/>
🎧 <span>Denise!</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Yes</span>... she may only be the <span>office</span> <span>assistant</span> but she always has <span>words</span> of <span>wisdom</span>. <span>Right</span>... <span>custard</span> <span>creams</span> or <span>chocolate</span> <span>digestives</span>?<br/>
🎧 What?<br/>
🎧 <span>Biscuits</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh</span>... <span>custard</span> <span>creams</span> please. <span>Err</span>, Denise, I know you're <span>busy</span> but could you <span>spare</span> a few <span>minutes</span> of your time please?<br/>
🎧 Of course Anna, always happy to help you.<br/>
🎧 Well you know the <span>stock</span> <span>management</span> <span>control</span> <span>system</span>?<br/>
🎧 The one <span>you've</span> now got to work <span>out</span>... well done for getting that!<br/>
🎧 Thanks. I really don't know where to <span>begin</span>. It was OK <span>writing</span> it down for Paul but how do I put it in to practice? <span>There's</span> just too much to do!<br/>
🎧 <span>Calm</span> down Anna. <span>You'll</span> be fine. The first thing you need to do is to look at our <span>current</span> <span>system</span>.<br/>
🎧 Look at our <span>current</span> <span>system</span>. How do I do that?<br/>
🎧 Easy! Just take the <span>lift</span> down to the <span>warehouse</span> and speak to Mr <span>Ingle</span> and then <span>write</span> down what you find <span>–</span> and <span>draw</span> up an <span>action</span> plan of <span>tasks</span> you need to do <span>–</span> like a <span>shopping</span> <span>list</span> <span>–</span> I'm very good at those.<br/>
🎧 Go and see Mr <span>Ingle</span>? Oh do I have to.<br/>
🎧 <span>He's</span> ok really Anna. If you <span>approach</span> him in the right way he <span>won't</span> <span>bite</span> your <span>head</span> off!<br/>
🎧 What? <span>Bite</span> my <span>head</span> off! <span>Oh</span>... well, if he <span>won't</span> <span>bite</span> <span>me</span>... then I <span>suppose</span> I should go and see him. Thanks for your advice Denise, I could <span>kiss</span> you. Right, I'm going to go and see him right now.<br/>
🎧 Make an <span>action</span> plan! A good idea. Well done Denise, you're <span>smarter</span> than you look! And well done Anna, you <span>eventually</span> got the help you <span>needed</span> by <span>using</span> these <span>phrases:<br/></span>
🎧 I would be most <span>grateful</span> if you could give me some <span>help<br/></span>
🎧 Please could I ask you for some advice?<br/>
🎧 I know you're <span>busy</span> but could you <span>spare</span> me a few <span>minutes</span> of your time please?<br/>
🎧 <span>Remember</span>, if you're <span>stuck</span> for <span>ideas</span> just ask for <span>help…but</span> maybe not Tom, I <span>wonder</span> how he's getting on?<br/>
🎧 <span>(shouting</span> across <span>room)</span> Here Anna, <span>I've</span> got them. Look, all my <span>ideas</span> from my last <span>stock</span> <span>control</span> <span>project…pages</span> and <span>pages</span> of them. Just <span>copy</span> these, <span>they're</span> <span>brilliant</span>. Anna? Anna!<br/>
🎧 <span>…too</span> <span>late</span>, <span>I've</span> just <span>seen</span> her in the <span>lift</span>. <span>Fancy</span> a <span>custard</span> <span>cream</span> Tom?<br/>
🎧 So Anna is off to speak to the <span>prickly</span> Mr <span>Ingle</span>. <span>Let's</span> hope she <span>uses</span> those <span>phrases</span> to ask for help, <span>otherwise</span> she might get her <span>head</span> <span>bitten</span> off <span>–</span> and it could get very <span>messy</span>! See you next time.<br/>

🎧 Hello, <span>welcome</span> back to Tip Top <span>Trading</span> where Anna is going <span>downstairs</span> to speak to <span>warehouse</span> <span>manager</span>, Mr <span>Ingle</span>. <span>You're</span> looking a bit <span>nervous<br/></span>...
🎧 I am. Denise says if I speak to him in the wrong way, he might <span>bite</span> my <span>head</span> off!<br/>
🎧 <span>Relax</span> Anna. <span>It's</span> just an <span>expression</span> to mean he might be a bit <span>aggressive</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh!<br/>
🎧 <span>You'll</span> be fine, just use the right <span>polite</span> <span>phrases</span>... oh, and <span>smile</span>!<br/>
🎧 OK, I will. Oh look here I <span>am<br/></span>...
🎧 <span>(Warehouse</span> <span>door</span> <span>opens)<br/></span>
🎧 Mr <span>Ingle</span>, are you there? <span>I'd</span> be most <span>grateful</span> if you could give me <span>some</span>... oh, <span>what's</span> that <span>smell</span>... and <span>smoke</span>... Mr <span>Ingle</span>!<br/>
🎧 Oh, oh <span>(coughs)<br/></span>
🎧 Mr <span>Ingle</span>. <span>You're</span> <span>smoking</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Well</span>... it's my lunch <span>break</span>... so I'm <span>allowed</span> to <span>smoke</span> a <span>cigarette</span>, <span>aren't</span> I?<br/>
🎧 Really? Are you sure?<br/>
🎧 No, he's not Anna! <span>Smoking</span> inside a <span>public</span> <span>building</span> is <span>illegal</span> <span>–</span> it's <span>against</span> the law. <span>It's</span> <span>dangerous</span> too <span>-</span> <span>you've</span> got to do something about this.<br/>
🎧 Oh right. <span>Mmm</span>, <span>er</span>, Mr <span>Ingle</span>, you <span>mustn't</span> <span>smoke</span>... it's wrong.<br/>
🎧 <span>Says</span> who?<br/>
🎧 <span>Err</span>, Me?<br/>
🎧 Anna. <span>You'll</span> have to do better than that. Be <span>polite</span>, but be <span>firm</span> too. Try saying, <span>‘would</span> you <span>mind</span> not doing that <span>please?'<br/></span>
🎧 I'll try. Mr <span>Ingle</span>, would you <span>mind</span> not doing that please?<br/>
🎧 <span>Why's</span> that then?<br/>
🎧 <span>He's</span> not being very nice is he? You need to give your <span>reasons</span>. Say, <span>‘I'm</span> <span>afraid</span> it's <span>against</span> company <span>policy'</span>. Go on you can do it.<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>Ingle</span>... I'm <span>afraid</span> it's <span>against</span> company <span>policy</span>. <span>And</span>... it is actually <span>against</span> the law to <span>smoke</span> <span>here</span>... <span>and</span>... it's not a nice <span>smell</span>, is it?<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>smells</span> OK to me.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm sorry to have to ask you this but you need to put it out.<br/>
🎧 Put what out <span>–</span> the <span>cat?</span>!<br/>
🎧 No. You need to <span>extinguish</span> your <span>cigarette</span>... please.<br/>
🎧 <span>Says</span> who?<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm sure your <span>team</span> <span>wouldn't</span> like to see you <span>breaking</span> the law and <span>besides</span>, it could <span>cause</span> a <span>fire</span>. That would be <span>awful</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I <span>suppose</span> it would.<br/>
🎧 I could get you some <span>nicotine</span> gum if you like?<br/>
🎧 No, it's OK. I'll <span>stub</span> it <span>out</span>... as you <span>asked</span> so <span>nicely</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you Mr <span>Ingle</span>. <span>We'll</span> keep it a <span>secret</span> this time, but please don't do it again. I'm <span>afraid</span> it's just not <span>permitted</span> on company <span>premises</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, whatever!<br/>
🎧 Oh and Mr <span>Ingle</span>, I still really like your <span>overalls</span>. Bye!<br/>
🎧 Nice one Anna. You <span>dealt</span> with Mr <span>Ingle</span> really well. You <span>kept</span> your <span>cool</span> and <span>explained</span> the <span>reasons</span> why he <span>shouldn't</span> <span>smoke</span>. <span>Let's</span> hope he <span>doesn't</span> do it again Anna.<br/>
🎧 I hope not. I <span>hate</span> the <span>smell</span> of <span>cigarette</span> <span>smoke</span>. But I never got to ask him about <span>stock</span> <span>management</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, maybe it's best to leave it for another time?<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna's</span> had a <span>tricky</span> day so <span>far</span> <span>dealing</span> with Mr <span>Ingle</span> but she was <span>firm</span> and <span>fair</span> in the <span>language</span> she used. <span>Here's</span> a <span>reminder</span> of the <span>phrases</span> she <span>used:<br/></span>
🎧 Would you <span>mind</span> not doing that please?<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>afraid</span> it's <span>against</span> company <span>policy</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>afraid</span> it's not <span>permitted</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sorry to have to ask you this <span>but<br/></span>...
🎧 Ah Anna, there you <span>are</span>.... <span>(sniffing)</span> Have you been <span>smoking</span>?<br/>
🎧 No!<br/>
🎧 You <span>smell</span> of <span>cigarette</span> <span>smoke</span>. Look, I know you're under <span>pressure</span> <span>–</span> but <span>smoking</span> in the <span>building</span> is not <span>permitted</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Bbbut<br/></span>...
🎧 We take this very <span>seriously</span>. You had better <span>step</span> in to my <span>office</span> and we'll talk about this.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>dear</span>! <span>Anna's</span> in <span>trouble</span> for no <span>reason</span>. <span>Let's</span> hope she <span>explains</span> the <span>mix-up</span>, but that <span>means</span> <span>telling</span> Paul about Mr <span>Ingle</span> <span>smoking</span>. This is going to be <span>difficult</span>. Until next time, bye!<br/>

🎧 <span>Welcome</span> back. Things are quite <span>tense</span> at Tip Top <span>Trading</span> today. Paul, the <span>boss</span>, <span>mistakenly</span> <span>thinks</span> <span>Anna's</span> been <span>smoking</span> on company <span>premises</span> and she's trying to <span>explain</span> <span>herself</span>.<br/>
🎧 But, <span>but<br/></span>...
🎧 <span>Frankly</span>, I'm <span>disappointed</span> with you Anna. You're a <span>hard</span> <span>worker</span> but it doesn't mean you can go <span>against</span> company <span>policy</span>.<br/>
🎧 Anna, remember the <span>phrases</span> we've <span>learnt</span> about a <span>misunderstanding</span>!<br/>
🎧 Oh yes. Paul, I think there's been a <span>misunderstanding</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>misunderstanding</span>? How can you <span>explain</span> the <span>smell</span> of <span>cigarette</span> <span>smoke</span>? This is a <span>'no</span> <span>smoking'</span> <span>building</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let me <span>explain</span>. I went down to the <span>warehouse</span> to speak to Mr <span>Ingle</span> <span>and</span>... well... <span>someone</span> else was <span>smoking</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>What!</span>? <span>Someone</span> was <span>smoking</span> in the <span>warehouse</span>? <span>Golly</span> <span>gosh</span>, that's <span>highly</span> <span>dangerous</span>. Who was it Anna?<br/>
🎧 <span>Err</span>... well... I can't really say. But I <span>dealt</span> with it and it won't <span>happen</span> again.<br/>
🎧 Yes, you <span>dealt</span> with it very well Anna but can you keep your <span>secret</span> about Mr <span>Ingle</span> <span>safe</span>?<br/>
🎧 Thank you Anna and sorry about the <span>misunderstanding</span>. Would you like a <span>biscuit</span>? Now I really think it's time we had a <span>review</span> of our <span>health</span> and <span>safety</span> <span>procedures</span>.<br/>
🎧 Denise, could you <span>gather</span> everyone <span>round</span> in the <span>meeting</span> room please.<br/>
🎧 <span>(On</span> <span>phone)</span> I'll have to call you back <span>Marge</span>. <span>(Hangs</span> <span>up)</span> Could you all <span>gather</span> in the <span>meeting</span> room please, Paul has something important to say.<br/>
🎧 What is it Denise? Is it about my <span>fantastic</span> <span>sales</span> <span>figures</span> again, <span>huh</span>?<br/>
🎧 I <span>doubt</span> it Tom. It <span>sounded</span> <span>urgent</span>. I'd better <span>bring</span> some tea.<br/>
🎧 Thank you for <span>joining</span> me. <span>Unfortunately</span>, there has been an <span>incident</span> in the <span>warehouse</span>. <span>Someone</span> has been <span>smoking</span> and I'm not happy, so I thought I would <span>remind</span> you of our <span>health</span> and <span>safety</span> <span>procedures</span>.<br/>
🎧 Not this again!<br/>
🎧 Your <span>safety</span> is our <span>responsibility</span>. But to keep <span>safe</span> we must <span>follow</span> some simple <span>rules</span>. Denise, what's the first one?<br/>
🎧 <span>(Slurps</span> <span>tea)</span> If you see a <span>fire</span>, <span>raise</span> the <span>alarm</span> <span>–</span> oh and call the <span>fire</span> <span>service</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, you love <span>seeing</span> those <span>firemen</span>, don't you, Denise!<br/>
🎧 <span>Shhh</span> Tom. Maybe you could tell us the other <span>rule</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh yeah right. If you hear the <span>fire</span> <span>alarm</span>, get out <span>quick</span>.<br/>
🎧 Not exactly Tom. I think we should <span>walk</span> <span>calmly</span> to our <span>nearest</span> <span>fire</span> <span>exit</span>, <span>following</span> the <span>green</span> <span>signs</span>, go outside and meet at the <span>fire</span> <span>assembly</span> <span>point</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, and I will take a <span>register</span> of who is here, <span>using</span> my red pen <span>(slurps</span> <span>tea)</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you <span>mind</span> not <span>slurping</span> Denise?<br/>
🎧 This is <span>thirsty</span> work.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>. Now is everyone <span>clear</span> about what to do if there is a <span>fire</span> <span>alarm</span>?<br/>
🎧 It's usually a <span>false</span> <span>alarm</span> <span>anyway</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's not the <span>point</span>. Now Anna, what about <span>smoking</span>?<br/>
🎧 No <span>smoking</span> on company <span>premises</span>. But it wasn't me, it was Mr <span>Ingle</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>All<br/></span>
🎧 Mr <span>Ingle</span>!<br/>
🎧 I see, so it was Mr <span>Ingle</span> <span>smoking</span> in the <span>warehouse</span>. You should have told me Anna.<br/>
🎧 Sorry!<br/>
🎧 Right, I'm going to have to look into this. Back to work <span>everyone</span>... oh and take a <span>biscuit</span> with you.<br/>
🎧 So <span>Anna's</span> let the cat out of the bag <span>–</span> Mr <span>Ingle</span> won't be <span>pleased</span> <span>–</span> but at <span>least</span> she now <span>knows</span> what do if a <span>fire</span> <span>breaks</span> out. Here are some of the <span>phrases</span> we've heard today, that can be used in an <span>emergency:<br/></span>
🎧 If you see a <span>fire</span>, <span>raise</span> the <span>alarm</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Walk</span> <span>calmly</span> to your <span>nearest</span> <span>fire</span> <span>exit</span>.<br/>
🎧 Meet at the <span>fire</span> <span>assembly</span> <span>point</span>.<br/>
🎧 No <span>smoking</span> on company <span>premises</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sorry to <span>interrupt</span> <span>Paul</span>... but the <span>fire</span> <span>alarm's</span> going off!<br/>
🎧 Don't <span>panic</span> <span>anyone</span>. Everything will be OK. <span>(On</span> <span>phone)</span> Jane, I'll have to call you <span>back</span>... yes, a bit of a <span>panic</span>. Bye. <span>Quick</span>, where's my red pen?<br/>
🎧 <span>Uh-oh</span>. Those <span>emergency</span> <span>phrases</span> might come in useful <span>sooner</span> than you think. Is this going to be the end of Tip Top <span>Trading</span>, will it really go up in <span>smoke</span>? Find out next time. Bye.<br/>

🎧 Tom?<br/>
🎧 Here.<br/>
🎧 Anna? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Here Denise.<br/>
🎧 And Paul?<br/>
🎧 Yes, yes I'm here and there's no need to <span>panic</span>. That was just a <span>fire</span> <span>drill</span> <span>–</span> a practice.<br/>
🎧 <span>Phew</span>, Tip Top <span>Trading</span> is <span>safe</span> <span>–</span> for now. It was just a <span>fire</span> <span>drill</span>. What a <span>busy</span> day this is <span>turning</span> out to be.

🎧 Oh, not really.<br/>
🎧 Just keep <span>calm</span> and say things <span>like:<br/></span>
🎧 There's no need to <span>panic</span>.<br/>
🎧 Please leave the <span>building</span> and meet outside.<br/>
🎧 Use the <span>stairs</span> not the <span>lift</span>.<br/>
🎧 And when you're outside, you could <span>say:</span> Is <span>anybody</span> <span>missing</span>?<br/>
🎧 OK, thanks, but I hope I'll never need to use them.<br/>
🎧 Well done everyone. <span>Hopefully</span> you all know what to do in the <span>unlikely</span> <span>event</span> of a <span>real</span> <span>fire</span>. Now, to <span>celebrate</span>, I'm off to buy some really nice <span>biscuits</span> for all of us <span>–</span> you know, those special <span>double-choc</span> <span>ones</span> with the little <span>orange</span> <span>bits</span>. Back to work everyone.<br/>
🎧 <span>Honestly</span>! I was in the <span>middle</span> of an important call.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, and you never got see those <span>firemen</span> in <span>action</span>, did you Denise?<br/>
🎧 Look at the time. I really need to get on with my work.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, and I've got to check up on the <span>latest</span> <span>football</span>... I mean share <span>prices</span>. <span>Hold</span> on, can <span>anyone</span> <span>smell</span> <span>smoke</span>?<br/>
🎧 I don't <span>believe</span> it! The <span>fire</span> <span>alarm's</span> <span>gone</span> off again. I'll call you back <span>Marge</span>. Oh, where's Paul when you need him? Anna, you're going to have to take <span>charge</span>.<br/>
🎧 Me? What about Tom?<br/>
🎧 It looks like Tom has <span>gone</span> already.<br/>
🎧 <span>Remember</span> Anna, use those <span>phrases</span> to keep everyone <span>calm</span> and <span>informed</span> about what to do.<br/>
🎧 OK. <span>Err</span>... there's no need to <span>panic</span>. Please leave the <span>building</span> and meet outside.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hold</span> on, I just need to <span>grab</span> my <span>elephant</span> <span>dung</span> <span>notepad</span> and red pen. Come on then Anna, into the <span>lift</span>.<br/>
🎧 No Denise. We must use the <span>stairs</span> not the <span>lift</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, with my <span>knees</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Jump</span> up Denise, I'll <span>carry</span> you.<br/>
🎧 Could I have your <span>attention</span> please.<br/>
🎧 <span>Louder</span> Anna. This is <span>urgent</span>!<br/>
🎧 Could I have your <span>attention</span> please! I need your full <span>attention</span>. Please <span>stay</span> <span>calm</span>. I'm sure there's not a <span>fire</span>, just a bit of <span>smoke</span>. Is there <span>anybody</span> <span>missing</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, there's no <span>smoke</span> without <span>fire</span>, hey Tom! Tom? Tom? Has <span>anyone</span> <span>seen</span> Tom? That's Tom <span>coming</span> out of the <span>building</span> and he's <span>carrying</span> <span>someone</span> on his <span>shoulder</span>!<br/>
🎧 It's Mr <span>Ingle</span> from the <span>warehouse</span>!<br/>
🎧 It's OK <span>everyone</span>... I've put the <span>fire</span> <span>out</span>... it was in the <span>warehouse</span>. Mr <span>Ingle</span> had been <span>smoking</span>.<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>Ingle</span>!<br/>

🎧 <span>Err</span>... <span>yeah</span>... sorry.<br/>
🎧 Sorry <span>indeed</span>! Mr <span>Ingle's</span> in serious <span>trouble</span> now. But well done Anna for <span>dealing</span> with that <span>emergency</span> and getting everyone out of the <span>building</span>. Here are some of the <span>phrases</span> she <span>used:<br/></span>
🎧 There's no need to <span>panic</span>.<br/>
🎧 Please leave the <span>building</span> and meet outside.<br/>
🎧 Use the <span>stairs</span> not the <span>lift</span>.<br/>
🎧 And when you're outside, you could <span>say:<br/></span>
🎧 Is <span>anybody</span> <span>missing</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Seems</span> like Tom is a bit of a <span>hero</span>. He has his <span>uses</span>! But <span>hold</span> on, who's this?<br/>
🎧 Say <span>Honey</span>, looks like I've come at a good time. Have you <span>seen</span> a guy called Paul <span>round</span> here?<br/>
🎧 He's not here, he's <span>gone</span> to buy <span>some</span>... <span>err</span>... <span>biscuits</span>. Can I help?<br/>
🎧 Yeah <span>sugar</span>. I'm Mr <span>Socrates</span>, <span>Paul's</span> <span>boss</span> and I've come to <span>sort</span> this <span>business</span> out.<br/>
🎧 Tom <span>&</span> <span>Denise<br/></span>
🎧 Mr <span>Socrates</span>!<br/>
🎧 Oh no! The <span>head</span> of the <span>company's</span> in <span>town</span>. This <span>means</span> <span>trouble</span>. See you next time.<br/>

🎧 Hello again. Things haven't been going well at Tip Top <span>Trading</span>. There was a <span>fire</span> in the <span>warehouse</span>, <span>caused</span> by Mr <span>Ingle's</span> <span>cigarette</span> and now Mr <span>Socrates</span> <span>–</span> the big <span>boss</span> from <span>America</span> <span>–</span> has <span>turned</span> up <span>unexpectedly</span>.<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 So <span>honey</span>, are <span>you</span>...?<br/>
🎧 Anna. I'm Anna, I work here as a <span>sales</span> <span>executive</span>. We haven't <span>met</span> before.<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 We sure ain't. Looks like I've <span>arrived</span> just in the <span>nick</span> of time.<br/>
🎧 <span>(Out</span> of <span>breath)</span>... what's going <span>on</span>... oh, Mr <span>Socrates</span>! <span>Golly</span> <span>gosh</span>, what an <span>unexpected</span>...<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Unexpected</span> alright. Looks like this company is in a <span>mess</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Err</span> yes. It was OK when I <span>popped</span> out for some <span>biscuits</span>... <span>erm</span>, would you like one?<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Biscuits?</span>! They're <span>cookies</span> man. Look, now what do I have to do to get a <span>triple-shot</span>, <span>organic</span>, <span>skinny</span> <span>cappuccino</span> <span>round</span> here?<br/>
🎧 I'll get you one Mr <span>Socrates</span>.<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>S<br/></span>
🎧 It's OK <span>honey</span>. I need you to book me a <span>hotel</span> room. <span>You</span>... what's your name <span>again…Paul</span>... can you <span>fetch</span> me one?<br/>
🎧 Right Anna. <span>Booking</span> a room for Mr <span>Socrates</span>. This is something you can't get wrong.<br/>
🎧 Well I've never done it before.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you'll be OK. When you book a room, here's what you could <span>say:<br/></span>
🎧 Hello, I'd like to check <span>availability</span> and <span>prices</span> for a room please.<br/>
🎧 Does the <span>price</span> <span>include</span> <span>breakfast</span>?<br/>
🎧 Are there any <span>business</span> <span>facilities</span> such as <span>internet</span> and <span>wi-fi</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'd like to go ahead and make the <span>reservation</span> please.<br/>
🎧 OK I'll give it a try. But where shall I look?<br/>
🎧 Try <span>searching</span> on the <span>internet</span>. Look for a <span>five-star</span> <span>hotel</span>. He is a <span>five-star</span> <span>guest</span> after all. Good <span>luck</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks. I better get back to the <span>office</span> and get <span>started</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hi Anna.<br/>
🎧 Oh hi Tom. Well done for <span>saving</span> Mr <span>Ingle</span> in that <span>fire</span>. You were very <span>brave</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>nothing</span> really. <span>So</span>... <span>err</span>... what are you doing?<br/>
🎧 I've got to book a <span>hotel</span> for Mr <span>Socrates</span>.<br/>
🎧 No! You know, we must be in <span>trouble</span>. He never <span>visits</span>.<br/>
🎧 Really? So where shall I book him in to?<br/>
🎧 Well my friend <span>runs</span> a <span>fantastic</span> <span>hotel</span> <span>–</span> it's <span>five</span> <span>star</span>! It's called the <span>Royal</span> <span>Imperial</span>. Look, I've got his number. Give him a call, <span>mention</span> my name. You're <span>bound</span> to get a special <span>rate</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks Tom.<br/>
🎧 No <span>problem</span>. Oh but don't <span>forget</span>, I've heard Mr <span>S</span> only likes a room with a <span>single</span> bed in it. He <span>gets</span> <span>spooked</span> out if there's another empty bed.<br/>
🎧 Oh right. OK, I might as well give it a try.<br/>
🎧 <span>Receptionist<br/></span>
🎧 Hello. <span>Royal</span> <span>Imperial</span> <span>Hotel</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, hello. I'd like to check <span>availability</span> and <span>rates</span> for a room.<br/>
🎧 <span>Receptionist<br/></span>
🎧 When for?<br/>
🎧 For <span>three</span> <span>nights</span> from <span>tonight</span>. Your best room please!<br/>
🎧 <span>Receptionist<br/></span>
🎧 All our <span>rooms</span> are the best! <span>But</span>... yes, we have one. It's <span>£100</span> a <span>night</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right. I work with <span>Tom…Tom</span> <span>Darcy</span>... his friend <span>runs</span> the <span>hotel</span>. I <span>wondered</span> if you could <span>offer</span> me a special <span>rate</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Receptionist<br/></span>
🎧 Tom <span>Darcy</span>? No I've never heard of him. Sorry, it's still <span>£100</span>.<br/>
🎧 Does the <span>price</span> <span>include</span> <span>breakfast</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Receptionist<br/></span>
🎧 Yes. We <span>offer</span> a full <span>continental</span> <span>breakfast</span> of <span>toast</span>, or <span>bread</span>, oh, and <span>tea…or</span> <span>coffee….and</span> <span>cereal</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh. And do you have any <span>business</span> <span>facilities</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Receptionist<br/></span>
🎧 Well, we've got <span>paper</span> and <span>pens</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was thinking, <span>internet</span>, <span>wi-fi</span>... <span>shoe-shine</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Receptionist<br/></span>
🎧 Yes. We've got that.<br/>
🎧 Good. And most <span>importantly</span>, is this a <span>single</span> room?<br/>
🎧 <span>Receptionist<br/></span>
🎧 We've only got <span>twin</span> <span>rooms</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Twins</span>? You've only got room for <span>twins</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Receptionist<br/></span>
🎧 No. We could take a bed out and just leave one in, if you want?<br/>
🎧 Oh that would be perfect. In that case, I'd like to go ahead and make a <span>reservation</span> please.<br/>
🎧 <span>Receptionist<br/></span>
🎧 Good. How would you like to pay?<br/>
🎧 Well done Anna for <span>booking</span> the <span>hotel</span> but I have a feeling <span>Tom's</span> <span>recommendation</span> may not be as <span>luxurious</span> as he says. Let's hear the <span>phrases</span> Anna used when <span>booking</span> a <span>hotel:<br/></span>
🎧 Hello, I'd like to check <span>availability</span> and <span>prices</span> for a room please.<br/>
🎧 Does the <span>price</span> <span>include</span> <span>breakfast</span>?<br/>
🎧 Are there any <span>business</span> <span>facilities</span> such as <span>internet</span> and <span>wi-fi</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'd like to go ahead and make the <span>reservation</span> please.<br/>
🎧 So the room is <span>booked</span>. I <span>wonder</span> what Mr <span>Socrates</span> will think of it? He's a <span>particularly</span> <span>fussy</span> man as we'll find out next time. Bye!<br/>
<span><br/></span>
