🎧 It's late at the offices of Tip Top Trading. Anna is alone, working. Again. She's been doing this all week, she wants her presentation to Mr Lime to be perfect so she's been spending hours and hours on it. Anna?<br/>
🎧 Don't interrupt! I'm busy.<br/>
🎧 Woah!<br/>
🎧 Sorry.<br/>
🎧 Anna, you're really burning the candle at both ends.<br/>
🎧 What?<br/>
🎧 Burning the candle at both ends – it means working very hard – working late and getting up early to work all the time.<br/>
🎧 Oh. I didn't know that expression.<br/>
🎧 Well here are some more:<br/>
🎧 You're doing overtime; which means you're working longer than office hours.<br/>
🎧 You're putting in the hours; which means you are spending all the time needed to achieve something.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I'm putting in the hours to make sure my presentation is perfect.<br/>
🎧 And if you don't mind me saying so, you might burn out; which means you are working so hard that you might get very tired and run out of energy.<br/>
🎧 I'm not burning out. I'm full of energy. I just need to finish this bit...<br/>
🎧 My goodness, nothing's locked. Do you think we've been burgled?<br/>
🎧 Oh no! I left my lap-book and my me-pad on the desk... and my i-top – they're worth thousands! They're all the latest versions!<br/>
🎧 I left out my elephant mug and my lady-curve nail file. They better not have stolen them!<br/>
🎧 (Talking in her sleep) but it's premium, premium, faux-orange premium!<br/>
🎧 Anna?<br/>
🎧 It's Anna, she's asleep. Anna!<br/>
🎧 (waking up with a jump) Oh! Lemons! Denise? Tom?<br/>
🎧 Have you spent the night asleep at your desk Anna?<br/>
🎧 Is it morning? Oh dear, yes I think so.<br/>
🎧 Well, at least we haven't been burgled then.<br/>
🎧 Tom, you've really been burning the candle at both ends lately.<br/>
🎧 Yes, you've been doing hours and hours of overtime. Most people get their work done within office hours and anyway, we don't pay overtime here. You'll never find me working late!<br/>
🎧 Yes, I'd noticed that Denise.<br/>
🎧 But this presentation must be perfect.<br/>
🎧 If you're not careful, you'll burn out! Then you'll really be of no use to anyone. You'll be as useful as a chocolate teapot.<br/>
🎧 It's good that you're putting in the hours Anna, but you should calm down. Look at me, I do very successful presentations without spending hours preparing.<br/>
🎧 Ha!<br/>
🎧 In my presentation to Every Apple I just swooshed in with no preparation after a night on the town. I charmed them. They loved me!<br/>
🎧 Idiot. I bet he actually spent hours preparing he just can't admit it.<br/>
🎧 Well, maybe you're right. I can't think clearly anymore, I'm so tired. I need to sleep properly otherwise I'll end up trying to sell bananas instead of lemons.<br/>
🎧 Anna has finally got the message: she's realised she's been working too much. She needs to be realistic. Here's a reminder of some of the phrases we heard to talk about how much Anna had been working:<br/>
🎧 Burning the candle at both ends.<br/>
🎧 Doing overtime.<br/>
🎧 Putting in the hours.<br/>
🎧 Burning out.<br/>
🎧 Let's hope she's thinking clearly by the time she has to do her presentation. Join us next time to find out! Bye.<br/>

🎧 Hello, welcome to the offices of Citrus Ventures! It's a big day for Anna, she's about to present Tip Top Trading's new Imperial Lemon to Mr Lime and his colleagues. This must not go wrong.<br/>
🎧 …revoltionary laser-curve.... revolUtionary laser-curve... revol-<br/>
🎧 How are you feeling today Anna?<br/>
🎧 Scared! I want to do really well. If I mess up and Citrus Ventures doesn't place an order, I'll be so upset.<br/>
🎧 You're well prepared, that's the main thing. Explain clearly how your presentation will be organised.<br/>
🎧 OK. Oh dear, I didn't think of the very beginning. Can you give me examples of what I should say?<br/>
🎧 After you've introduced yourself, you could say:<br/>
🎧 Today I'm going to... and explain. Then say:<br/>
🎧 I'll start by...<br/>
🎧 And then I'm going to move on to discuss<br/>...
🎧 And finally...<br/>
🎧 OK, like this:<br/>
🎧 Today I'm going to...<br/>
🎧 I'll start by...<br/>
🎧 And then I'm going to move on to discuss<br/>...
🎧 And finally...<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 Right, thanks, I'll try. Everything will be fine. I feel relaxed now.<br/>
🎧 Anna!<br/>
🎧 Mr Lime!<br/>
🎧 How lovely to see you. You look absolutely... I've been looking forward to this for days! Everyone is waiting in the meeting room. Come this way....<br/>
🎧 Oh gosh.<br/>
🎧 Everyone in Citrus Ventures is very excited about this new Imperial Lemon, so I allowed a few extras to come and watch, I hope you don't mind. All your equipment has been set up so you can begin!<br/>
🎧 Hello, I'm Anna of Top Tip Trading... I mean, Tip Top Trading, sorry! I'm very unhappy to be here.<br/>
🎧 Anna- focus!<br/>
🎧 I mean, I'm very happy to be here.<br/>
🎧 Anna, breathe deeply, then say:<br/>
🎧 Today I'm going to...<br/>
🎧 Today I'm going to... Today I'm going to present our revolutionary, new Imperial Lemon. I'll start by telling you a bit about Tip Top Trading and some of the exciting new developments at our company. And then…I'm going to move on to explain how the Imperial Lemon is designed and what makes it so revolutionary. And finally, you will all have a chance to see it close up for yourselves and ask questions. So, let's begin. This picture shows...<br/>
🎧 Well, as usual, Anna seems to be turning a difficult situation into a success. She used the phrases we discussed, which made her opening clear and well-structured. She said:<br/>
🎧 Today I'm going to...<br/>
🎧 I'll start by...<br/>
🎧 And then I'm going to move on to discuss<br/>...
🎧 And finally...<br/>
🎧 But that's just the beginning, now she's got to get through the rest of the pitch – how will that go?<br/>
🎧 …this picture shows….oh no, why isn't it working…I should just click on this….oh, what's wrong with this stupid computer!<br/>
🎧 Uh oh! It was all going so well but now Anna's got computer problems. What is she going to do? We'll find out next time. Bye!<br/>
<br/><br/>

🎧 Hello, welcome back to the offices of Citrus Ventures! Anna's presentation to Mr Lime and his colleagues continues... Well, almost! Her computer has jammed and the presentation, along with her notes, are frozen.<br/>
🎧 Oh no, this is terrible!<br/>
🎧 Anna, you're going to have to manage without the slideshow or notes. Just talk!<br/>
🎧 Just talk! Just talk! You just talk! What on earth am I going to say? My mind is blank.<br/>
🎧 Try to remember the key points you wanted to share, and give them one by one. If you can, give some facts that support each point. For example:<br/>
🎧 Tip Top Trading is growing fast – our number of clients doubled last year.<br/>
🎧 Use phrases like this:<br/>
🎧 The company has a strong track record of...<br/>
🎧 Let me share with you...<br/>
🎧 The Imperial Lemon's key strengths are...<br/>
🎧 OK. Ahem! Sorry about that, I'll just have to continue talking without the slideshow. So, ahem.... Tip Top Trading is growing fast – our number of clients doubled last year. This is because our company-<br/>
🎧 Yes, but try not to bark out information like a robot.<br/>
🎧 Look people in the eye, slow down and try to be more conversational….oh, and smile!<br/>
🎧 Tip Top Trading is growing fast – our number of clients doubled last year. This is because our company has a strong track record of reliability and because, thanks to new technology, our fruits are more and more convincing. Our bananas have won awards for being the most authentic-looking fruits in Europe. We are very happy that Citrus Ventures is already among our clients and we hope to build on that by offering you more exciting new fruits. Let me share with you our latest product: the Imperial Lemon.<br/>
🎧 The Imperial Lemon's key strengths are its design and flexibility. It is made with revolutionary faux-orange-premium, laser-curve-definition technology... <br/>
🎧 What an excellent performance from Anna. She focussed on some key points, supported them with facts and structured her answer clearly. She also managed to relax and sound more natural. She used these phrases:<br/>
🎧 The company has a strong track record of...<br/>
🎧 Let me share with you..<br/>
🎧 The Imperial Lemon's key strengths are...<br/>
🎧 Let's fast-forward to after the meeting to see if she gets an order.<br/>
🎧 …so thank you for your time, I hope you're impressed with our Imperial Lemon.<br/>
🎧 Fantastic Anna, fantastic!<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Those... lemons – wow. I'd like to put in an order for three hundred thousand right away.<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 Now, what's your direct phone number?<br/>
🎧 Good work. Although, I must say, Mr Lime seems just as excited about Anna as he is about the lemons. Hmm....watch out Anna! Until next time!<br/>

🎧 Hello. We're back at Tip Top Trading. Anna is very busy dealing with Mr Lime's big order for Imperial Lemons.<br/>
🎧 Yes?... Who?... I can't hear you. Mr what? What? Mr Who? I don't know, you tell me. Oh, you are Mr Hu... H-U: Hu. Er... No, Tom's busy. Call back later. Bye. Tom, Mr Hu called you.<br/>
🎧 Mr Hu-<br/>
🎧 Mr Hu: H-U<br/>
🎧 Tom, Mr Hu is a very important-<br/>
🎧 Oh! What now?! Yes?<br/>
🎧 I'm going to have to talk to the boss about this.<br/>
🎧 No. I'm busy, give me your number, I'll call you later. Yep, yep, 6... 8... thanks. Bye! Right, now where was I?<br/>
🎧 Anna, could I have a word?<br/>
🎧 Yes. Ohhh, he must want to tell me how pleased he is with the Citrus Ventures deal.<br/>
🎧 Now, Anna... biscuit?<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 I'm a little bit concerned about something.<br/>
🎧 "I'm a little bit concerned..." Doesn't that mean something bad?<br/>
🎧 Yes, Anna, Paul is using a polite turn of phrase to say he is unhappy about something. Let's see what he's got to say....<br/>
🎧 I think you need to work on your telephone manner.<br/>
🎧 Work on my telephone manner?<br/>
🎧 It means the way you talk on the phone is not good enough and you have to improve it – to work on it to make it better.<br/>
🎧 Perhaps you should think about <br/>...
🎧 Perhaps you should think about – that's a polite way of telling you to do something!<br/>
🎧 Anna, are you listening to me?<br/>
🎧 Yes, sorry, I was just sort of, err, talking to myself. Could you repeat what you said please?<br/>
🎧 Right, I'll start again. I said: I'm a little bit concerned about your telephone manner. You need to work on the way you speak to clients. Perhaps you should think about being a bit more polite to clients; it's important for the image of the company.<br/>
🎧 Oh okay.<br/>
🎧 You can go now – take another biscuit with you – that's my last chocolate wafer, you lucky thing!<br/>
🎧 Anna? Is everything all right?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 What's the matter? says I need to w-w-w-work on my telephone manner.<br/>
🎧 Well I was a bit concerned about it myself. And I think Tom actually mentioned it to Paul.<br/>
🎧 But, look, I'll help you if you like. I'm a bit of an expert on the phone. I'll give you some lessons.<br/>
🎧 Oh thank you.<br/>
🎧 Come in early tomorrow morning, before the others get here and we'll practise.<br/>
🎧 Thank you Denise, that's very kind.<br/>
🎧 Wow! Denise is actually being nice to Anna. Amazing! Although from what I've heard of Denise on the phone, she's only ever gossiping with friends. Paul was very gentle and polite in the way he explained to Anna there was a problem and that she needed to improve some things. He used these phrases:<br/>
🎧 I'm a little bit concerned about...<br/>
🎧 You need to work on...<br/>
🎧 Perhaps you should think about...<br/>
🎧 Let's see if Denise manages to teach Anna anything useful next time. Until then!<br/>

🎧 (answering the phone) Yes?<br/>
🎧 Stop! That's all wrong. I'm going to call you again. This time<br/>...
🎧 Hello. Here we are in the middle of a telephone training session with Denise and Anna. What fun!<br/>
🎧 …this time, you don't say 'yes' when you answer, it's rude. Call me and I'll show you how it's done.<br/>
🎧 (sound of 4-digit dialling, then phone rings)<br/>
🎧 Hello? Tip Top Trading.<br/>
🎧 Wow, that's good.<br/>
🎧 And, you can say your name. Hello? Tip Top Trading. Denise speaking. Try it.<br/>
🎧 (dialling, then ring)<br/>
🎧 Hello? Tip Top Trading. Denise speaking.<br/>
🎧 No!<br/>
🎧 What?<br/>
🎧 Say: "Anna speaking!"<br/>
🎧 Oh, sorry, I'm so stressed by all this. Hello Anna speaking.<br/>
🎧 You sound like you're sitting on a pineapple. Listen to my voice: Hello? Denise speaking.<br/>
🎧 Hello? Anna speaking.<br/>
🎧 Good. Now, when the person has introduced themself – this is Mrs Smith or whatever, say: Hello Mrs Smith, how can I help you? Or, if you know them already, you might say: Hello Mrs Smith, how are you?<br/>
🎧 Okay, what if Mrs Smith wants to speak to Tom but he's not there?<br/>
🎧 You say: "I'm really sorry, he's not available at the moment. Can I take a message?" Or: "I'm afraid he's busy, shall I ask him to call you back?"<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 And, to end a conversation, you can say: "Thank you for calling, goodbye." Let's do another practice!<br/>
🎧 (phone rings)<br/>
🎧 Hello? Tip Top Trading.<br/>
🎧 Hello, this is Mrs Smith.<br/>
🎧 Hello Mrs Smith, how can I help you?<br/>
🎧 I'd like to speak to Tom please.<br/>
🎧 I'm really sorry, he's not available at the moment. Can I take a message?<br/>

🎧 Okay. Thank you for calling, goodbye.<br/>
🎧 Excellent!<br/>
🎧 (phone rings)<br/>
🎧 Oh!<br/>
🎧 How did you call me without dialling?<br/>
🎧 I didn't, that's a real call!<br/>
🎧 Oh no, I'm all nervous now. Hello? Tip Top Trading. This is Anna speaking.<br/>
🎧 Hello Anna, this is Seb Lime.<br/>
🎧 Sublime?<br/>
🎧 Mr Lime from Citrus Ventures. But I think we should be on first name terms now, so call me Seb.<br/>
🎧 Okay, er, Seb. How can I help you?<br/>
🎧 I just wanted to say again that your Imperial Lemon is fantastic... and I was wondering if you'd like to do lunch with me sometime?<br/>
🎧 Lunch? Er...<br/>
🎧 I knew it! Mr Lime is interested in more than just your lemons!<br/>
🎧 Would you like to discuss the Imperial Lemon?<br/>
🎧 Forget the lemons Anna! The reason I want to see you is more of a personal nature.<br/>
🎧 Personnel? Er... Can I call you back? I'm afraid I'm a bit busy at the moment...<br/>
🎧 …bbbut<br/>...
🎧 Well Anna! Mr Lime eh?<br/>
🎧 Oh dear Denise, I think I need a bit more help from you. He wants to talk about personnel…people, staffing<br/>...
🎧 Are you sure? I think he means a personal nature, not personnel! That Mr Lime!<br/>
🎧 Oh!<br/>
🎧 Mr Lime indeed. Anyway, Anna had an excellent phone manner. Let's hear those phrases again:<br/>
🎧 Hello? Tip Top Trading. This is Anna speaking.<br/>
🎧 Hello? Anna speaking.<br/>
🎧 Hello Mrs Smith, how can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Hello Mrs Smith, how are you?<br/>
🎧 I'm really sorry, he's not available at the moment. Can I take a message?<br/>
🎧 I'm afraid he's busy – shall I ask him to call you back?<br/>
🎧 Thank you for calling, goodbye.<br/>
🎧 But how is Anna going to handle Mr Lime's request? I can't wait till next time! Bye!<br/>
<br/><br/>
