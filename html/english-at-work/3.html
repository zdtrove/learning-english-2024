🎧 It's <span>late</span> at the <span>offices</span> of Tip Top <span>Trading</span>. Anna is <span>alone</span>, working. Again. She's been doing this all week, she <span>wants</span> her <span>presentation</span> to Mr Lime to be <span>perfect</span> so she's been spending hours and hours on it. Anna?<br/>
🎧 Don't <span>interrupt</span>! I'm <span>busy</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Woah</span>!<br/>
🎧 Sorry.<br/>
🎧 Anna, you're really <span>burning</span> the <span>candle</span> at both <span>ends</span>.<br/>
🎧 What?<br/>
🎧 <span>Burning</span> the <span>candle</span> at both <span>ends</span> <span>–</span> it <span>means</span> working very <span>hard</span> <span>–</span> working <span>late</span> and getting up <span>early</span> to work all the time.<br/>
🎧 Oh. I didn't know that <span>expression</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well here are some <span>more:<br/></span>
🎧 You're doing <span>overtime;</span> which <span>means</span> you're working <span>longer</span> than <span>office</span> hours.<br/>
🎧 You're <span>putting</span> in the <span>hours;</span> which <span>means</span> you are spending all the time <span>needed</span> to <span>achieve</span> something.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I'm <span>putting</span> in the hours to make sure my <span>presentation</span> is <span>perfect</span>.<br/>
🎧 And if you don't <span>mind</span> me saying so, you might <span>burn</span> <span>out;</span> which <span>means</span> you are working so <span>hard</span> that you might get very <span>tired</span> and run out of <span>energy</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm not <span>burning</span> out. I'm full of <span>energy</span>. I just need to <span>finish</span> this <span>bit</span>...<br/>
🎧 My <span>goodness</span>, <span>nothing's</span> <span>locked</span>. Do you think we've been <span>burgled</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh no! I <span>left</span> my <span>lap-book</span> and my <span>me-pad</span> on the <span>desk</span>... and my <span>i-top</span> <span>–</span> they're <span>worth</span> <span>thousands</span>! They're all the <span>latest</span> <span>versions</span>!<br/>
🎧 I <span>left</span> out my <span>elephant</span> <span>mug</span> and my <span>lady-curve</span> <span>nail</span> <span>file</span>. They better not have <span>stolen</span> them!<br/>
🎧 <span>(Talking</span> in her <span>sleep)</span> but it's <span>premium</span>, <span>premium</span>, <span>faux-orange</span> <span>premium</span>!<br/>
🎧 Anna?<br/>
🎧 It's Anna, she's <span>asleep</span>. Anna!<br/>
🎧 <span>(waking</span> up with a <span>jump)</span> Oh! <span>Lemons</span>! Denise? Tom?<br/>
🎧 Have you <span>spent</span> the <span>night</span> <span>asleep</span> at your <span>desk</span> Anna?<br/>
🎧 Is it morning? Oh <span>dear</span>, yes I think so.<br/>
🎧 Well, at <span>least</span> we haven't been <span>burgled</span> then.<br/>
🎧 Tom, you've really been <span>burning</span> the <span>candle</span> at both <span>ends</span> lately.<br/>
🎧 Yes, you've been doing hours and hours of <span>overtime</span>. Most people get their work done <span>within</span> <span>office</span> hours and <span>anyway</span>, we don't pay <span>overtime</span> here. <span>You'll</span> never find me working <span>late</span>!<br/>
🎧 Yes, I'd <span>noticed</span> that Denise.<br/>
🎧 But this <span>presentation</span> must be <span>perfect</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you're not <span>careful</span>, you'll <span>burn</span> out! Then you'll really be of no use to <span>anyone</span>. You'll be as <span>useful</span> as a <span>chocolate</span> <span>teapot</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's good that you're <span>putting</span> in the hours Anna, but you should <span>calm</span> down. Look at me, I do very <span>successful</span> <span>presentations</span> without spending hours <span>preparing</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ha</span>!<br/>
🎧 In my <span>presentation</span> to Every <span>Apple</span> I just <span>swooshed</span> in with no <span>preparation</span> after a <span>night</span> on the <span>town</span>. I <span>charmed</span> them. They loved me!<br/>
🎧 <span>Idiot</span>. I bet he actually <span>spent</span> hours <span>preparing</span> he just can't <span>admit</span> it.<br/>
🎧 Well, maybe you're right. I can't think <span>clearly</span> <span>anymore</span>, I'm so <span>tired</span>. I need to <span>sleep</span> <span>properly</span> <span>otherwise</span> I'll end up trying to sell <span>bananas</span> <span>instead</span> of <span>lemons</span>.<br/>
🎧 Anna has <span>finally</span> got the <span>message:</span> she's <span>realised</span> she's been working too much. She needs to be <span>realistic</span>. Here's a <span>reminder</span> of some of the <span>phrases</span> we <span>heard</span> to talk about how much Anna had been <span>working:<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Burning</span> the <span>candle</span> at both <span>ends</span>.<br/>
🎧 Doing <span>overtime</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Putting</span> in the hours.<br/>
🎧 <span>Burning</span> out.<br/>
🎧 Let's hope she's thinking <span>clearly</span> by the time she has to do her <span>presentation</span>. Join us next time to find out! Bye.<br/>

🎧 Hello, <span>welcome</span> to the <span>offices</span> of <span>Citrus</span> <span>Ventures</span>! It's a big day for Anna, she's about to <span>present</span> Tip Top <span>Trading's</span> new <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemon</span> to Mr Lime and his <span>colleagues</span>. This must not go wrong.<br/>
🎧 <span>…revoltionary</span> <span>laser-curve</span>.... <span>revolUtionary</span> <span>laser-curve</span>... <span>revol-<br/></span>
🎧 How are you feeling today Anna?<br/>
🎧 <span>Scared</span>! I want to do really well. If I <span>mess</span> up and <span>Citrus</span> <span>Ventures</span> doesn't place an <span>order</span>, I'll be so <span>upset</span>.<br/>
🎧 You're well <span>prepared</span>, that's the <span>main</span> thing. <span>Explain</span> <span>clearly</span> how your <span>presentation</span> will be <span>organised</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK. Oh <span>dear</span>, I didn't think of the very <span>beginning</span>. Can you give me <span>examples</span> of what I should say?<br/>
🎧 After you've <span>introduced</span> <span>yourself</span>, you could <span>say:<br/></span>
🎧 Today I'm going to... and <span>explain</span>. Then <span>say:<br/></span>
🎧 I'll start <span>by</span>...<br/>
🎧 And then I'm going to move on to <span>discuss<br/></span>...
🎧 And <span>finally</span>...<br/>
🎧 OK, like <span>this:<br/></span>
🎧 Today I'm going to...<br/>
🎧 I'll start <span>by</span>...<br/>
🎧 And then I'm going to move on to <span>discuss<br/></span>...
🎧 And <span>finally</span>...<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 Right, thanks, I'll try. Everything will be fine. I feel <span>relaxed</span> now.<br/>
🎧 Anna!<br/>
🎧 Mr Lime!<br/>
🎧 How <span>lovely</span> to see you. You look <span>absolutely</span>... I've been <span>looking</span> forward to this for <span>days</span>! Everyone is <span>waiting</span> in the <span>meeting</span> room. Come this <span>way</span>....<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>gosh</span>.<br/>
🎧 Everyone in <span>Citrus</span> <span>Ventures</span> is very <span>excited</span> about this new <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemon</span>, so I <span>allowed</span> a few <span>extras</span> to come and <span>watch</span>, I hope you don't <span>mind</span>. All your <span>equipment</span> has been set up so you can <span>begin</span>!<br/>
🎧 Hello, I'm Anna of Top Tip <span>Trading</span>... I mean, Tip Top <span>Trading</span>, sorry! I'm very <span>unhappy</span> to be here.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna-</span> focus!<br/>
🎧 I mean, I'm very happy to be here.<br/>
🎧 Anna, <span>breathe</span> <span>deeply</span>, then <span>say:<br/></span>
🎧 Today I'm going to...<br/>
🎧 Today I'm going to... Today I'm going to <span>present</span> our <span>revolutionary</span>, new <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemon</span>. I'll start by <span>telling</span> you a bit about Tip Top <span>Trading</span> and some of the <span>exciting</span> new <span>developments</span> at our <span>company</span>. And <span>then…I'm</span> going to move on to <span>explain</span> how the <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemon</span> is <span>designed</span> and what makes it so <span>revolutionary</span>. And <span>finally</span>, you will all have a <span>chance</span> to see it <span>close</span> up for <span>yourselves</span> and ask <span>questions</span>. So, let's <span>begin</span>. This <span>picture</span> <span>shows</span>...<br/>
🎧 Well, as <span>usual</span>, Anna <span>seems</span> to be <span>turning</span> a <span>difficult</span> <span>situation</span> into a <span>success</span>. She used the <span>phrases</span> we <span>discussed</span>, which made her <span>opening</span> <span>clear</span> and <span>well-structured</span>. She <span>said:<br/></span>
🎧 Today I'm going to...<br/>
🎧 I'll start <span>by</span>...<br/>
🎧 And then I'm going to move on to <span>discuss<br/></span>...
🎧 And <span>finally</span>...<br/>
🎧 But that's just the <span>beginning</span>, now she's got to get through the <span>rest</span> of the <span>pitch</span> <span>–</span> how will that go?<br/>
🎧 <span>…this</span> <span>picture</span> <span>shows….oh</span> no, why <span>isn't</span> it <span>working…I</span> should just <span>click</span> on <span>this….oh</span>, <span>what's</span> wrong with this <span>stupid</span> <span>computer</span>!<br/>
🎧 Uh oh! It was all going so well but now <span>Anna's</span> got <span>computer</span> <span>problems</span>. What is she going to do? We'll find out next time. Bye!<br/>
<span><br/></span><br/>

🎧 Hello, <span>welcome</span> back to the <span>offices</span> of <span>Citrus</span> <span>Ventures</span>! <span>Anna's</span> <span>presentation</span> to Mr Lime and his <span>colleagues</span> <span>continues</span>... Well, almost! Her <span>computer</span> has <span>jammed</span> and the <span>presentation</span>, along with her <span>notes</span>, are <span>frozen</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh no, this is <span>terrible</span>!<br/>
🎧 Anna, you're going to have to <span>manage</span> without the <span>slideshow</span> or <span>notes</span>. Just talk!<br/>
🎧 Just talk! Just talk! You just talk! What on <span>earth</span> am I going to say? My <span>mind</span> is <span>blank</span>.<br/>
🎧 Try to <span>remember</span> the key <span>points</span> you wanted to share, and give them one by one. If you can, give some <span>facts</span> that <span>support</span> each <span>point</span>. For <span>example:<br/></span>

This is because our <span>company-<br/></span>
🎧 Yes, but try not to <span>bark</span> out <span>information</span> like a <span>robot</span>.<br/>
🎧 Look people in the eye, <span>slow</span> down and try to be more <span>conversational….oh</span>, and <span>smile</span>!<br/>
🎧 Tip Top <span>Trading</span> is <span>growing</span> <span>fast</span> <span>–</span> our <span>number</span> of <span>clients</span> <span>doubled</span> last year. This is because our <span>company</span> has a <span>strong</span> <span>track</span> <span>record</span> of <span>reliability</span> and because, thanks to new <span>technology</span>, our <span>fruits</span> are more and more <span>convincing</span>. Our <span>bananas</span> have <span>won</span> <span>awards</span> for being the most <span>authentic-looking</span> <span>fruits</span> in <span>Europe</span>. We are very happy that <span>Citrus</span> <span>Ventures</span> is already <span>among</span> our <span>clients</span> and we hope to <span>build</span> on that by <span>offering</span> you more <span>exciting</span> new <span>fruits</span>. Let me share with you our <span>latest</span> <span>product:</span> the <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemon</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemon's</span> key <span>strengths</span> are its <span>design</span> and <span>flexibility</span>. It is made with <span>revolutionary</span> <span>faux-orange-premium</span>, <span>laser-curve-definition</span> <span>technology</span>... <span><br/></span>
🎧 What an <span>excellent</span> <span>performance</span> from Anna. She <span>focussed</span> on some key <span>points</span>, <span>supported</span> them with <span>facts</span> and <span>structured</span> her answer <span>clearly</span>. She also <span>managed</span> to <span>relax</span> and sound more <span>natural</span>. She used these <span>phrases:<br/></span>

🎧 Let's <span>fast-forward</span> to after the <span>meeting</span> to see if she <span>gets</span> an <span>order</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>…so</span> thank you for your time, I hope you're <span>impressed</span> with our <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemon</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Fantastic</span> Anna, <span>fantastic</span>!<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 <span>Those</span>... <span>lemons</span> <span>–</span> wow. I'd like to put in an <span>order</span> for <span>three</span> <span>hundred</span> <span>thousand</span> right away.<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 Now, what's your <span>direct</span> phone <span>number</span>?<br/>
🎧 Good work. Although, I must say, Mr Lime <span>seems</span> just as <span>excited</span> about Anna as he is about the <span>lemons</span>. <span>Hmm....watch</span> out Anna! Until next time!<br/>

🎧 Hello. We're back at Tip Top <span>Trading</span>. Anna is very <span>busy</span> <span>dealing</span> with Mr <span>Lime's</span> big <span>order</span> for <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemons</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yes?</span>... <span>Who?</span>... I can't hear you. Mr what? What? Mr Who? I don't know, you tell me. Oh, you are Mr <span>Hu</span>... <span>H-U:</span> <span>Hu</span>. <span>Er</span>... No, <span>Tom's</span> <span>busy</span>. <span>Call</span> back later. Bye. Tom, Mr <span>Hu</span> called you.<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>Hu-<br/></span>
🎧 Mr <span>Hu:</span> <span>H-U<br/></span>
🎧 Tom, Mr <span>Hu</span> is a very <span>important-<br/></span>
🎧 Oh! What <span>now?</span>! Yes?<br/>
🎧 I'm going to have to talk to the <span>boss</span> about this.<br/>
🎧 No. I'm <span>busy</span>, give me your <span>number</span>, I'll call you later. <span>Yep</span>, <span>yep</span>, <span>6</span>... <span>8</span>... thanks. Bye! Right, now where was I?<br/>
🎧 Anna, could I have a <span>word</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes. <span>Ohhh</span>, he must want to tell me how <span>pleased</span> he is with the <span>Citrus</span> <span>Ventures</span> <span>deal</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, <span>Anna</span>... <span>biscuit</span>?<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 I'm a little bit <span>concerned</span> about something.<br/>
🎧 <span>"I'm</span> a little bit <span>concerned..."</span> Doesn't that mean something bad?<br/>
🎧 Yes, Anna, Paul is <span>using</span> a <span>polite</span> <span>turn</span> of <span>phrase</span> to say he is <span>unhappy</span> about something. Let's see what he's got to <span>say</span>....<br/>
🎧 I think you need to work on your <span>telephone</span> <span>manner</span>.<br/>
🎧 Work on my <span>telephone</span> <span>manner</span>?<br/>
🎧 It <span>means</span> the way you talk on the phone is not good enough and you have to <span>improve</span> it <span>–</span> to work on it to make it better.<br/>
🎧 <span>Perhaps</span> you should think about <span><br/></span>...
🎧 <span>Perhaps</span> you should think about <span>–</span> that's a <span>polite</span> way of <span>telling</span> you to do something!<br/>
🎧 Anna, are you <span>listening</span> to me?<br/>
🎧 Yes, sorry, I was just <span>sort</span> of, <span>err</span>, talking to myself. Could you <span>repeat</span> what you said please?<br/>
🎧 Right, I'll start again. I <span>said:</span> I'm a little bit <span>concerned</span> about your <span>telephone</span> <span>manner</span>. You need to work on the way you speak to <span>clients</span>. <span>Perhaps</span> you should think about being a bit more <span>polite</span> to <span>clients;</span> it's <span>important</span> for the <span>image</span> of the <span>company</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh okay.<br/>
🎧 You can go now <span>–</span> take another <span>biscuit</span> with you <span>–</span> that's my last <span>chocolate</span> <span>wafer</span>, you <span>lucky</span> thing!<br/>
🎧 Anna? Is everything all right?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 What's the <span>matter</span>? <span>says</span> I need to <span>w-w-w-work</span> on my <span>telephone</span> <span>manner</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well I was a bit <span>concerned</span> about it myself. And I think Tom actually <span>mentioned</span> it to Paul.<br/>
🎧 But, look, I'll help you if you like. I'm a bit of an <span>expert</span> on the phone. I'll give you some <span>lessons</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh thank you.<br/>
🎧 Come in <span>early</span> <span>tomorrow</span> morning, before the <span>others</span> get here and we'll <span>practise</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you Denise, that's very kind.<br/>
🎧 Wow! Denise is actually being nice to Anna. <span>Amazing</span>! Although from what I've <span>heard</span> of Denise on the phone, she's only ever <span>gossiping</span> with friends. Paul was very <span>gentle</span> and <span>polite</span> in the way he <span>explained</span> to Anna there was a <span>problem</span> and that she <span>needed</span> to <span>improve</span> some things. He used these <span>phrases:<br/></span>
🎧 I'm a little bit <span>concerned</span> <span>about</span>...<br/>
🎧 You need to work <span>on</span>...<br/>
🎧 <span>Perhaps</span> you should think <span>about</span>...<br/>
🎧 Let's see if Denise <span>manages</span> to <span>teach</span> Anna anything <span>useful</span> next time. Until then!<br/>
<span><br/></span><br/>

🎧 <span>(sound</span> of <span>4-digit</span> <span>dialling</span>, then phone <span>rings)<br/></span>
🎧 Hello? Tip Top <span>Trading</span>.<br/>
🎧 Wow, <span>that's</span> good.<br/>
🎧 And, you can say your name. Hello? Tip Top <span>Trading</span>. Denise <span>speaking</span>. Try it.<br/>
🎧 <span>(dialling</span>, then <span>ring)<br/></span>
🎧 Hello? Tip Top <span>Trading</span>. Denise <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 No!<br/>
🎧 What?<br/>
🎧 <span>Say:</span> <span>"Anna</span> <span>speaking!"<br/></span>
🎧 Oh, sorry, I'm so <span>stressed</span> by all this. Hello Anna <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 You sound like you're <span>sitting</span> on a <span>pineapple</span>. Listen to my <span>voice:</span> Hello? Denise <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hello? Anna <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good. Now, when the person has <span>introduced</span> <span>themself</span> <span>–</span> this is Mrs Smith or whatever, <span>say:</span> Hello Mrs Smith, how can I help you? Or, if you know them already, you might <span>say:</span> Hello Mrs Smith, how are you?<br/>
🎧 Okay, what if Mrs Smith <span>wants</span> to speak to Tom but he's not there?<br/>
🎧 You <span>say:</span> <span>"I'm</span> really sorry, he's not <span>available</span> at the <span>moment</span>. Can I take a <span>message?"</span> <span>Or:</span> <span>"I'm</span> <span>afraid</span> he's <span>busy</span>, shall I ask him to call you <span>back?"<br/></span>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 And, to end a <span>conversation</span>, you can <span>say:</span> <span>"Thank</span> you for <span>calling</span>, <span>goodbye."</span> Let's do another <span>practice</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>(phone</span> <span>rings)<br/></span>
🎧 Hello? Tip Top <span>Trading</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hello, this is Mrs Smith.<br/>
🎧 Hello Mrs Smith, how can I help you?<br/>
🎧 I'd like to speak to Tom please.<br/>
🎧 I'm really sorry, he's not <span>available</span> at the <span>moment</span>. Can I take a <span>message</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's okay, I'll try again later.<br/>
🎧 Okay. Thank you for <span>calling</span>, <span>goodbye</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Excellent</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>(phone</span> <span>rings)<br/></span>
🎧 Oh!<br/>
🎧 How did you call me without <span>dialling</span>?<br/>
🎧 I didn't, that's a <span>real</span> call!<br/>
🎧 Oh no, I'm all <span>nervous</span> now. Hello? Tip Top <span>Trading</span>. This is Anna <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hello Anna, this is <span>Seb</span> Lime.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sublime</span>?<br/>
🎧 Mr Lime from <span>Citrus</span> <span>Ventures</span>. But I think we should be on first name <span>terms</span> now, so call me <span>Seb</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, <span>er</span>, <span>Seb</span>. How can I help you?<br/>
🎧 I just wanted to say again that your <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemon</span> is <span>fantastic</span>... and I was <span>wondering</span> if you'd like to do lunch with me sometime?<br/>
🎧 Lunch? <span>Er</span>...<br/>
🎧 I <span>knew</span> it! Mr Lime is interested in more than just your <span>lemons</span>!<br/>
🎧 Would you like to <span>discuss</span> the <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemon</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Forget</span> the <span>lemons</span> Anna! The <span>reason</span> I want to see you is more of a <span>personal</span> <span>nature</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Personnel</span>? <span>Er</span>... Can I call you back? I'm <span>afraid</span> I'm a bit <span>busy</span> at the <span>moment</span>...<br/>
🎧 <span>…bbbut<br/></span>...
🎧 Well Anna! Mr Lime <span>eh</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>dear</span> Denise, I think I need a bit more help from you. He <span>wants</span> to talk about <span>personnel…people</span>, <span>staffing<br/></span>...
🎧 Are you sure? I think he <span>means</span> a <span>personal</span> <span>nature</span>, not <span>personnel</span>! That Mr Lime!<br/>
🎧 Oh!<br/>
🎧 Mr Lime <span>indeed</span>. <span>Anyway</span>, Anna had an <span>excellent</span> phone <span>manner</span>. Let's hear those <span>phrases</span> <span>again:<br/></span>
🎧 Hello? Tip Top <span>Trading</span>. This is Anna <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hello? Anna <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hello Mrs Smith, how can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Hello Mrs Smith, how are you?<br/>
🎧 I'm really sorry, he's not <span>available</span> at the <span>moment</span>. Can I take a <span>message</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>afraid</span> he's <span>busy</span> <span>–</span> shall I ask him to call you back?<br/>
🎧 Thank you for <span>calling</span>, <span>goodbye</span>.<br/>
🎧 But how is Anna going to <span>handle</span> Mr <span>Lime's</span> <span>request</span>? I can't wait <span>till</span> next time! Bye!<br/>
