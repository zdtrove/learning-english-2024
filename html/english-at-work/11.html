🎧 Hello again and welcome to English at Work. It's another day at Tip Top Trading and hopefully a happier one, following Denise's bad news about her job. I wonder if Tom and Anna are about to get the same bad news?<br/>
🎧 It's really awful having to let a member of your staff go but that's the situation we're in, I'm afraid.<br/>
🎧 And now you're going to let us go aren't you? Honestly Paul, I've given my life to this company and, quite frankly, I'm disappointed... no, I'm angry at your decision. See your biscuits? Well<br/>...
🎧 Tom!<br/>
🎧 That's what I think of Tip Top Trading<br/>...
🎧 What?! Hold on Tom. I think you're a bit confused. I'm not sacking you too. I need to talk to you about plastic vegetables... you know, the aubergine idea?<br/>
🎧 Oh... I see. You're not sacking us? Sorry Paul... I'll buy you some more biscuits. So what was it that you had to say?<br/>
🎧 Plastic vegetables. Yours and Anna's idea for a plastic aubergine. I like it. It's good. So, I need you to develop a prototype we can use to show our potential clients.<br/>
🎧 Well that's great. So where do we get the prototype made?<br/>
🎧 Upstairs, on the 4th floor. We have a great development team who can magic up some amazing designs.<br/>
🎧 They're magicians?<br/>
🎧 No Anna. They're just developers who make things out of plastic.<br/>
🎧 Thank you Tom. Look, why not go and have a chat to them now and get the ball rolling.<br/>
🎧 But we're not making balls.<br/>
🎧 Come on Anna... I'll explain. See you Paul.<br/>
🎧 'To get the ball rolling' – he means to get the project moving along. Developers can design and make models of your products which you can show and develop. But you need to give them clear and specific instructions. Let's see how Anna gets on.<br/>
🎧 So this is the development team. Oh hi George, you up for footie on Sunday? Great. Have you met Anna before?<br/>
🎧 Hello.<br/>
🎧 We've come to talk vegetables.<br/>
🎧 George<br/>
🎧 Try the greengrocers!<br/>
🎧 Ha ha, very funny! No, we need a plastic aubergine making, mate. It's our new big idea.<br/>
🎧 George<br/>
🎧 Easy. We can just remould the design for the Imperial Lemon.<br/>
🎧 Can they Anna? Is that what you wanted? To get what you want, you need to explain exactly your requirements.<br/>
🎧 But what shall I say?<br/>
🎧 Tell them exactly what you were thinking by saying 'I have a specific idea in mind' and 'I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on how to improve my ideas' and, 'I'd like to use your design skills to produce a fantastic product'.<br/>
🎧 I see. OK, time for me to take control. George... this is quite a special project for us... isn't it Tom?<br/>
🎧 Oh yeah, right, absolutely.<br/>
🎧 So we want to get it right and I already have a specific idea in mind.<br/>
🎧 George<br/>
🎧 Great, sure, tell me more.<br/>
🎧 Well, based on a real aubergine, I was hoping it could be 20 centimetres in length, using grade 1 plastic resin, with a black-purple colour and a 30 degree curve on that side. Does that make sense?<br/>
🎧 George<br/>
🎧 Erm yeah. Quite clear.<br/>
🎧 Obviously you are a designer, so I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on how to improve our idea.<br/>
🎧 George<br/>
🎧 Well, it looks very impressive already. Gosh, Tom, where did you get her from?<br/>
🎧 He didn't get me from anywhere. Now, I'd like to use your design skills to develop a fantastic product that I can show everyone. OK?<br/>
🎧 George<br/>
🎧 Err... yes. I'll get onto it straight away.<br/>
🎧 Excellent Anna. Sometimes it's important to take control and say what you really want but in a positive and encouraging way. These are the phrases that Anna used:<br/>
🎧 I have a specific idea in mind.<br/>
🎧 I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on how to improve my ideas.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to use your design skills to produce a fantastic product.<br/>
🎧 There's one more phrase to use to make sure things go to plan if someone is making something for you. That is 'I need to sign off your designs before they go into production', that means approve the plans before anything I made. Off you go Anna<br/>...
🎧 …so when will you have the designs ready then?<br/>
🎧 George<br/>
🎧 Hopefully by tomorrow morning. Is that OK?<br/>
🎧 That will be great but I will need to sign off your designs before they go into production – that way, there won't be any mistakes – will there?<br/>
🎧 George<br/>
🎧 Crikey Tom, she's a bit bossy.<br/>
🎧 No! She's a pussy cat really... a bit of a softy.<br/>
🎧 Now come on Tom. Fetch my things, we need to go and sort out a leaving present for Denise.<br/>
🎧 Oh yeah right, of course, see you George.<br/>
🎧 Hmm, I think Tom's the pussy cat! Let's hope the designs come out well. But even more important is Denise's last day at work tomorrow – how is everyone going to cope? Find out next time on English at Work. Bye.<br/>

🎧 Hello again. It's a difficult day at the offices of Tip Top Trading. The office assistant Denise is losing her job, and today is her last day. Anna is busy with her work and trying to get everyone to sign Denise's leaving card.<br/>
🎧 Paul, have you signed Denise's leaving card yet?<br/>
🎧 No, not yet. Have you got a pen? "Sorry to see you go. Best foot forward. Paul." There. I feel a bit guilty, it was me who got rid of her.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. Well, you should feel really bad. I can't believe you're getting rid of her.<br/>
🎧 Tom, do you want to sign the card?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, of course. "You are…were…the best employee we ever had. So sad to see you go. Kiss, kiss, kiss. Tom."<br/>
🎧 Gosh. Three kisses! Erm, you haven't given me any money for her leaving present yet, have you?<br/>
🎧 Oh sorry, a bit of a cash flow problem... Here, have a pound.<br/>
🎧 That's generous!<br/>
🎧 Oh crumbs, she's crying again. Anna, could you deal with her? I've got something important to do.<br/>
🎧 Oh yeah. Me too.<br/>
🎧 Denise, are you OK? Are you upset about leaving?<br/>
🎧 Yes. I've loved working here. I've made some good friends... like you Anna... Oh, and being able to make free phone calls has been good. What am I going to do now?<br/>
🎧 Oh dear Anna. It sounds like Denise needs some career advice.<br/>
🎧 Career advice?<br/>
🎧 She needs some guidance on what to do next and where to find another job. What would you do in her situation?<br/>
🎧 Look in the newspaper, ring my contacts, register with a job agency?<br/>
🎧 Exactly! I'm sure you can give her some good advice. Go on, give it a go!<br/>
🎧 OK, I'll try. Cheer up Denise, you need to think positively.<br/>
🎧 Do I? I'm unemployed from tomorrow, how am I ever going to find another job?<br/>
🎧 Well, have you tried looking in the job section of the newspaper?<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 It's a good place to start. And there are loads of job-finding websites you could sign up for.<br/>
🎧 I don't have a computer.<br/>
🎧 Well what about ringing some of the people you know; contacts who may know about a job.<br/>
🎧 Hmm, I hadn't thought about that.<br/>
🎧 And of course, you could register with a recruitment agency. They're good at finding jobs for you.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's a good idea. Anna, you're brilliant! What great ideas... you're so kind and... thoughtful.<br/>
🎧 Anna could you... Oh no, she's crying again.<br/>
🎧 Oh no, shall we go back into your office Paul?<br/>
🎧 No, no. It's OK, Denise is crying with happiness. She's feeling better now.<br/>
🎧 Oh well, in that case... shall we all gather round and officially say goodbye to Denise.<br/>
🎧 It's an emotional day for Denise, but Anna has been really useful with her career advice. If a professional career advisor is not available, giving some of your own advice can sometimes be useful. Let's hear again what Anna suggested<br/>...
🎧 You need to think positively.<br/>
🎧 Try looking in the job section of the newspaper.<br/>
🎧 There are loads of job-finding websites you could sign up for.<br/>
🎧 What about ringing some of the people you know?<br/>
🎧 You could register with a recruitment agency.<br/>
🎧 OK everyone, the time has come to say farewell to Denise. It's with regret we've had to let her go.<br/>
🎧 We? You, Paul.<br/>
🎧 Pau<br/>
🎧 Thank you for all your hard work and we wish you very well in the future.<br/>
🎧 Anna, I think we have a gift for Denise?<br/>
🎧 There you go Denise. Careful, it's quite heavy.<br/>
🎧 Oh, what a beautiful fruit bowl... and full of plastic fruit!<br/>
🎧 I'll get it. Sorry about that everyone. That was a company called Nice'n'Cheesy, they remember you Anna. They liked your sales pitch and want to order a hundred thousand plastic grapes to go with their cheeses!<br/>
🎧 What?! Brilliant! Ooops. <br/>
🎧 My new fruit bowl! <br/>
🎧 Oh dear. Poor Denise! It looks like she might be leaving the company at just the wrong time. I wonder if she'll be back? You'll have to join us again for the next episode of English at Work. Bye!<br/>

🎧 Has anyone seen the stapler?<br/>
🎧 I can't find any pens.<br/>
🎧 Oh, here it is.<br/>
🎧 Will someone answer that phone?<br/>
🎧 Hello again and welcome back to English at Work. The offices of Tip Top Trading have become chaotic since Denise left and just at a time when things are getting busy. How is everyone going to cope? Let's find out.<br/>
🎧 Hello. Yes? It is. We're very busy at the moment so call back later. Bye.<br/>
🎧 That was a bit rude Tom.<br/>
🎧 Well we're too busy to be nice.<br/>
🎧 Hmm. Not a good attitude Tom. Even when you are busy at work it's important to be polite on the phone. It could be a potential customer. Anna, I think you're going to have to remind Tom about this.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I think so.<br/>
🎧 If things are busy in the office you could say to someone on the phone 'we're a bit busy at the moment, could I take your name and number and we'll call you back'? And, 'when would be a convenient time to call you?' or if the caller wants to speak to someone specific you could say 'could I take a message please and I'll make sure he or she calls you back?'<br/>
🎧 That's useful. Oh there goes the phone again.<br/>
🎧 Anna, could you get that please? I've got a mouthful of biscuit. Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Sure Paul. Hello? Tip Top Trading... yes, that's right... but things are a bit busy at the moment. Could I take your name and number and I'll call you back as soon as I can... oh hold on, has anyone got a pen?<br/>
🎧 I think we've run out. Denise usually orders them. Here, use my souvenir pen I bought in Italy, you see it changes colour if you hold it up to the light.<br/>
🎧 Thanks. Oh no! There's no paper to write it on.<br/>
🎧 Here, write it on my hand.<br/>
🎧 OK. Hold still. 7-4-9-0-5-6-8. Thanks for your patience, when is a good time to call you back? ... OK... 3 o'clock... I'll call you then. Goodbye.<br/>
🎧 Sounds important.<br/>
🎧 Possibly. Oh not again! Hello, Tip Top Trading, Anna speaking... I see... Well he doesn't seem to be here at the moment... can I take a message and I'll get him to call you back? Tom, I need your other hand to write on... keep still. OK, what's the message? ... Yes, call Bob about the lemons on 8-0-9-5-2-4. OK, I'll pass that on. Thanks. Bye.<br/>
🎧 Goodness. It's been crazy here since Denise left. Look we've even run out of teabags. I'll go and get some, shall I?<br/>
🎧 Hold on Tom. Has that invoice for Tutti Fruity been sent out yet?<br/>
🎧 I dunno. Denise usually sends out the paperwork.<br/>
🎧 I wish Denise was here!<br/>
🎧 So do we all! It sounds like chaos in the office but however hectic things can get, remember to remain professional when answering the phone. Here's a reminder of some of the phrases you could use<br/>...
🎧 We're a bit busy at the moment; could I take your name and number and we'll call you back?<br/>
🎧 When would be a convenient time to call you?<br/>
🎧 Could I take a message please and I'll make sure he or she calls you back?<br/>
🎧 Ah there you are, Tom, you've been a long time. I need to give Paul that important message I wrote on your hand.<br/>
🎧 Ah... yes... it's a bit tricky. You see, I went to the toilet and then I... washed my hands.<br/>
🎧 Oh no, you've washed the messages off! What are we going to do now?<br/>
🎧 Erm... I'll get that, shall I?<br/>
🎧 We can't carry on like this.<br/>
🎧 No you can't! Has Anna lost the numbers of two potential clients? Can the company carry on like this? It certainly looks like it could do with another pair of hands. What will happen next? Join us again next time for English at Work. Bye!<br/>

🎧 Welcome back to the chaotic offices of Tip Top Trading. Now Denise has left the company, the place is a mess and important phone messages are being lost. What can be done to make things better? I think we know the answer!<br/>
🎧 Hi. Did anyone take a message for me while I was out? I'm expecting an important call.<br/>
🎧 Err... no!<br/>
🎧 Actually yes Paul. I wrote it on Tom's hand but he washed it off.<br/>
🎧 Look, good hygiene's very important to me.<br/>
🎧 Hmm. That's not very good is it? What's wrong with writing on a piece of paper?<br/>
🎧 We've run out of paper... and pens.<br/>
🎧 Everything really. Nobody's ordered any stationery or tidied up the office.<br/>
🎧 It's since Denise left.<br/>
🎧 Yes, maybe I was a bit hasty getting rid of her. It was really just to save money.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, but look, if we can't take messages from possible clients we're going to lose even more money.<br/>
🎧 Yes... I suppose you have a point. Maybe I will to have reinstate her.<br/>
🎧 You mean, get her back?<br/>
🎧 Yes Anna, he does. Another way of saying reinstate is he's got to 'reverse his decision'. It means Paul has got to make an awkward call to Denise.<br/>
🎧 Look Paul, you're going to have to call her and tell her you've made an error... a huge one actually.<br/>
🎧 It wasn't that huge? Actually... Anna, you're her good friend, would you like to call her?<br/>
🎧 Me?! B-b-but I can't.<br/>
🎧 What a coward! I think it's time to stand your ground Anna. Tell him "You're the boss, I think it's better coming from you", and remind him "it was your decision so you need to explain the situation", and remind him "this is your responsibility". You could suggest he says "I'm sorry, I made a mistake and we would love to have you back."<br/>
🎧 OK. Do you know what Paul, I think the news is better coming from you... just to make it official.<br/>
🎧 Yeah Paul, you are the boss after all.<br/>
🎧 And it was your decision in the first place so you need to explain that the situation has changed.<br/>
🎧 Well, maybe you're right but I can't tell her I'm wrong can I?<br/>
🎧 Look, just say you're sorry. Tell her you made a mistake and I would love to have you back... we all would.<br/>
🎧 PaulYes, you're right. I should do it. I'll just have a quick biscuit. Here goes.<br/>
🎧 Hello?<br/>
🎧 Ah... h-h-h-ello Denise. It's me... Paul…your boss... your ex-boss from Tip Top Trading.<br/>
🎧 Oh.<br/>
🎧 How are you... getting on?<br/>
🎧 Well<br/>...
🎧 Good, good. Actually, I've been rethinking our staffing situation in the office<br/>...
🎧 Yes?<br/>
🎧 And…well... I'm sorry Denise... I... miscalculated my staffing numbers.<br/>
🎧 You mean you made a mistake?<br/>
🎧 Well, I suppose so. So... I would love to have you back in the office as soon as possible. What do you say?<br/>
🎧 Hmm, let me think about it... hmmm... errr... well... hmmm<br/>...
🎧 What will Denise decide? It was a hard phone call for Paul to make, but not one Anna should have made as it wasn't her mistake. She stood her ground with Paul and used the following phrases:<br/>
🎧 You're the boss and I think the news is better coming from you.<br/>
🎧 It was your decision in the first place so you need to explain that the situation has changed.<br/>
🎧 This is your responsibility.<br/>
🎧 And here is a reminder of the phrases Paul used to try and apologise:<br/>
🎧 I've been rethinking our staffing situation in the office.<br/>
🎧 Sorry, I made a mistake. I miscalculated my staffing numbers.<br/>
🎧 I would love to have you back in the office.<br/>
🎧 Hmmm... well... OK then. I'll start back tomorrow.<br/>
🎧 Oh wonderful. I'm so pleased. We'll get your old chair back in position.<br/>
🎧 Actually Paul, if you want me back I'll need a new chair... and a new phone<br/>...
🎧 OK Denise! See you tomorrow.<br/>
🎧 And a pay rise!<br/>
🎧 So, is she coming back then?<br/>
🎧 Yes, first thing tomorrow.<br/>
🎧 That's good because we've just had a call from Nice'n'Cheesy – they said nobody returned their call yesterday and that if we don't contact them by the end of tomorrow they will go elsewhere for their plastic grapes.<br/>
🎧 Right, we must act... and act fast.<br/>
🎧 Let's hope they don't lose that contract. At least with Denise returning to work, things will be a little more organised but for how long? Join us again next time on English at Work. Bye!<br/>

🎧 Quick, gather round, here she comes.<br/>
🎧 Welcome back Denise, we just couldn't survive without you.<br/>
🎧 Oh bless you.<br/>
🎧 Yes welcome back to Tip Top Trading Denise. Paul, the boss, was a little hasty in getting rid of her so now he's asked her back but negotiated some new conditions which include learning how to be a Sales Executive, like Anna. But who's going to show her what to do?<br/>
🎧 Oh, hello Denise. Nice to have you back. I suppose I had to eat my words didn't I?<br/>
🎧 Yes, well it makes a change from biscuits! Now, where have you put my stapler and my red pens?<br/>
🎧 Don't worry about that, I've got you a new stapler and a new desk, right here next to Anna.<br/>
🎧 Oh lovely.<br/>
🎧 Well you wanted some experience in sales, so I thought Anna could show you the ropes.<br/>
🎧 Ropes? I don't have any ropes!<br/>
🎧 Anna, if you 'show someone the ropes' it means you explain to someone how to do the job. You'll be great at that.<br/>
🎧 Oh I see. Well I might know what to do but I'm no good at explaining it to someone else.<br/>
🎧 Well the best way is to start at the beginning. Why not suggest to her to 'watch what I do', or give her some of your tasks and say 'please could you make a start on these?' and then reassure her by saying 'I'm here to help so please ask me if you need to know what to do.' Good luck.<br/>
🎧 Thanks! So Denise, it's nice to have you back, how's your new desk?<br/>
🎧 Much bigger than my old one – and look, it goes up….and down.<br/>
🎧 Yes it does. OK, shall we make a start then and I'll show you the ropes.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes Anna, of course Anna. Do I need to use the phone?<br/>
🎧 I reckon you're quite experienced with the phone already Denise!<br/>
🎧 Thank you Tom. We won't make any calls yet, just watch what I do for a while. Look, I'm just checking our database so see who we haven't called for a while.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes.<br/>
🎧 I'm just checking the dates here…in fact Denise, why don't you make a start on this.<br/>
🎧 Of course…oh look, my phone's ringing.<br/>
🎧 Are you going to answer it then?<br/>
🎧 Oh right. Hello, Tip Top Trading, Denise speaking…oh hello Marge! (To Anna) It's Marge, Anna!<br/>
🎧 Oh right. I'll leave you to it – I'm here to help, so please ask me if you need to know what to do.<br/>
🎧 OK Anna, I won't be long. So Marge, how did it go the other night? Really? Really! Well, I'm sitting at my new desk<br/>...
🎧 Nice to have her back hey?! Some Sales Exec she's going to be!<br/>
🎧 Everyone has to start somewhere Tom! Now Anna is helping – or coaching - Denise I'm sure she'll become an excellent worker. Here are some of the phrases Anna used to help her:<br/>
🎧 Let me show you the ropes.<br/>
🎧 Watch what I do for a while.<br/>
🎧 Why don't you make a start on this?<br/>
🎧 I'm here to help, so please ask me if you need to know what to do.<br/>
🎧 Let's find out how Denise is getting on.<br/>
🎧 So I said to him, it's just not my colour…yes exactly…hold on Marge, everyone's looking at me. I'd better call you back. Yes, tonight. Bye!<br/>
🎧 Hmm, you've certainly got a good phone manner. Do you think you could order some pens now, we've run out.<br/>
🎧 That's not my responsibility anymore.<br/>
🎧 Err, I think it is.<br/>
🎧 Isn't!<br/>
🎧 Is.<br/>
🎧 Isn't!<br/>
🎧 You two, please!<br/>
🎧 Well, she's got time for personal calls but not to order pens. Oh hold on….Oh Hi Jim, how's things? Yeah! Did you catch the match last night? What a goal!<br/>
🎧 Really!<br/>
🎧 Oh dear Anna. Things aren't going well. It's time to sort things out again but what are you going to do? Join us again next time to find out. Bye!<br/>
