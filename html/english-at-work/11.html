🎧 Hello again and <span>welcome</span> to English at Work. It's another day at Tip Top <span>Trading</span> and <span>hopefully</span> a <span>happier</span> one, <span>following</span> <span>Denise's</span> bad <span>news</span> about her <span>job</span>. I <span>wonder</span> if Tom and Anna are about to get the same bad <span>news</span>?<br/>
🎧 It's really <span>awful</span> having to let a <span>member</span> of your <span>staff</span> go but that's the <span>situation</span> we're in, I'm <span>afraid</span>.<br/>
🎧 And now you're going to let us go aren't you? <span>Honestly</span> Paul, I've <span>given</span> my life to this <span>company</span> and, quite <span>frankly</span>, I'm <span>disappointed</span>... no, I'm <span>angry</span> at your <span>decision</span>. See your <span>biscuits</span>? <span>Well<br/></span>...
🎧 Tom!<br/>
🎧 That's what I think of Tip Top <span>Trading<br/></span>...
🎧 <span>What?</span>! <span>Hold</span> on Tom. I think you're a bit <span>confused</span>. I'm not <span>sacking</span> you too. I need to talk to you about <span>plastic</span> <span>vegetables</span>... you know, the <span>aubergine</span> idea?<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh</span>... I see. You're not <span>sacking</span> us? Sorry <span>Paul</span>... I'll buy you some more <span>biscuits</span>. So what was it that you had to say?<br/>
🎧 <span>Plastic</span> <span>vegetables</span>. <span>Yours</span> and <span>Anna's</span> idea for a <span>plastic</span> <span>aubergine</span>. I like it. It's good. So, I need you to <span>develop</span> a <span>prototype</span> we can use to <span>show</span> our <span>potential</span> <span>clients</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well that's great. So where do we get the <span>prototype</span> made?<br/>
🎧 <span>Upstairs</span>, on the <span>4th</span> <span>floor</span>. We have a great <span>development</span> <span>team</span> who can <span>magic</span> up some <span>amazing</span> <span>designs</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're <span>magicians</span>?<br/>
🎧 No Anna. They're just <span>developers</span> who make things out of <span>plastic</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you Tom. Look, why not go and have a <span>chat</span> to them now and get the <span>ball</span> <span>rolling</span>.<br/>
🎧 But we're not <span>making</span> <span>balls</span>.<br/>
🎧 Come on <span>Anna</span>... I'll <span>explain</span>. See you Paul.<br/>
🎧 <span>'To</span> get the <span>ball</span> <span>rolling'</span> <span>–</span> he <span>means</span> to get the <span>project</span> <span>moving</span> along. <span>Developers</span> can <span>design</span> and make <span>models</span> of your <span>products</span> which you can <span>show</span> and <span>develop</span>. But you need to give them <span>clear</span> and <span>specific</span> <span>instructions</span>. Let's see how Anna <span>gets</span> on.<br/>
🎧 So this is the <span>development</span> <span>team</span>. Oh hi <span>George</span>, you up for <span>footie</span> on <span>Sunday</span>? Great. Have you <span>met</span> Anna before?<br/>
🎧 Hello.<br/>
🎧 We've come to talk <span>vegetables</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>George<br/></span>
🎧 Try the <span>greengrocers</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Ha</span> <span>ha</span>, very funny! No, we need a <span>plastic</span> <span>aubergine</span> <span>making</span>, <span>mate</span>. It's our new big idea.<br/>
🎧 <span>George<br/></span>
🎧 Easy. We can just <span>remould</span> the <span>design</span> for the <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemon</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can they Anna? Is that what you wanted? To get what you want, you need to <span>explain</span> exactly your <span>requirements</span>.<br/>
🎧 But what shall I say?<br/>
🎧 Tell them exactly what you were thinking by saying <span>'I</span> have a <span>specific</span> idea in <span>mind'</span> and <span>'I'm</span> interested in <span>hearing</span> your <span>thoughts</span> on how to <span>improve</span> my <span>ideas'</span> and, <span>'I'd</span> like to use your <span>design</span> <span>skills</span> to <span>produce</span> a <span>fantastic</span> <span>product'</span>.<br/>
🎧 I see. OK, time for me to take <span>control</span>. <span>George</span>... this is quite a special <span>project</span> for <span>us</span>... isn't it Tom?<br/>
🎧 Oh yeah, right, absolutely.<br/>
🎧 So we want to get it right and I already have a <span>specific</span> idea in <span>mind</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>George<br/></span>
🎧 Great, sure, tell me more.<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>based</span> on a <span>real</span> <span>aubergine</span>, I was <span>hoping</span> it could be <span>20</span> <span>centimetres</span> in <span>length</span>, <span>using</span> <span>grade</span> <span>1</span> <span>plastic</span> <span>resin</span>, with a <span>black-purple</span> <span>colour</span> and a <span>30</span> <span>degree</span> <span>curve</span> on that side. Does that make <span>sense</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>George<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Erm</span> yeah. Quite <span>clear</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Obviously</span> you are a <span>designer</span>, so I'm interested in <span>hearing</span> your <span>thoughts</span> on how to <span>improve</span> our idea.<br/>
🎧 <span>George<br/></span>
🎧 Well, it looks very <span>impressive</span> already. <span>Gosh</span>, Tom, where did you get her from?<br/>
🎧 He didn't get me from <span>anywhere</span>. Now, I'd like to use your <span>design</span> <span>skills</span> to <span>develop</span> a <span>fantastic</span> <span>product</span> that I can <span>show</span> everyone. OK?<br/>
🎧 <span>George<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Err</span>... yes. I'll get <span>onto</span> it <span>straight</span> away.<br/>
🎧 <span>Excellent</span> Anna. Sometimes it's <span>important</span> to take <span>control</span> and say what you really want but in a <span>positive</span> and <span>encouraging</span> way. These are the <span>phrases</span> that Anna <span>used:<br/></span>
🎧 I have a <span>specific</span> idea in <span>mind</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm interested in <span>hearing</span> your <span>thoughts</span> on how to <span>improve</span> my <span>ideas</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to use your <span>design</span> <span>skills</span> to <span>produce</span> a <span>fantastic</span> <span>product</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's one more <span>phrase</span> to use to make sure things go to plan if <span>someone</span> is <span>making</span> something for you. That is <span>'I</span> need to <span>sign</span> off your <span>designs</span> before they go into <span>production'</span>, that <span>means</span> <span>approve</span> the <span>plans</span> before anything I made. Off you go <span>Anna<br/></span>...
🎧 <span>…so</span> when will you have the <span>designs</span> ready then?<br/>
🎧 <span>George<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Hopefully</span> by <span>tomorrow</span> morning. Is that OK?<br/>
🎧 That will be great but I will need to <span>sign</span> off your <span>designs</span> before they go into <span>production</span> <span>–</span> that way, there won't be any <span>mistakes</span> <span>–</span> will there?<br/>
🎧 <span>George<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Crikey</span> Tom, she's a bit <span>bossy</span>.<br/>
🎧 No! She's a <span>pussy</span> cat <span>really</span>... a bit of a <span>softy</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now come on Tom. <span>Fetch</span> my things, we need to go and <span>sort</span> out a <span>leaving</span> <span>present</span> for Denise.<br/>
🎧 Oh yeah right, of course, see you <span>George</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, I think <span>Tom's</span> the <span>pussy</span> cat! Let's hope the <span>designs</span> come out well. But even more <span>important</span> is <span>Denise's</span> last day at work <span>tomorrow</span> <span>–</span> how is everyone going to <span>cope</span>? Find out next time on English at Work. Bye.<br/>
<span><br/></span>

🎧 Hello again. It's a <span>difficult</span> day at the <span>offices</span> of Tip Top <span>Trading</span>. The <span>office</span> <span>assistant</span> Denise is <span>losing</span> her <span>job</span>, and today is her last day. Anna is <span>busy</span> with her work and trying to get everyone to <span>sign</span> <span>Denise's</span> <span>leaving</span> <span>card</span>.<br/>
🎧 Paul, have you <span>signed</span> <span>Denise's</span> <span>leaving</span> <span>card</span> yet?<br/>
🎧 No, not yet. Have you got a pen? <span>"Sorry</span> to see you go. Best <span>foot</span> forward. <span>Paul."</span> There. I feel a bit <span>guilty</span>, it was me who got rid of her.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. Well, you should feel really bad. I can't <span>believe</span> you're getting rid of her.<br/>
🎧 Tom, do you want to <span>sign</span> the <span>card</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, of course. <span>"You</span> <span>are…were…the</span> best <span>employee</span> we ever had. So sad to see you go. <span>Kiss</span>, <span>kiss</span>, <span>kiss</span>. <span>Tom."<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Gosh</span>. <span>Three</span> <span>kisses</span>! <span>Erm</span>, you haven't <span>given</span> me any money for her <span>leaving</span> <span>present</span> yet, have you?<br/>
🎧 Oh sorry, a bit of a <span>cash</span> <span>flow</span> <span>problem</span>... Here, have a <span>pound</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>generous</span>!<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>crumbs</span>, she's <span>crying</span> again. Anna, could you <span>deal</span> with her? I've got something <span>important</span> to do.<br/>
🎧 Oh yeah. Me too.<br/>
🎧 Denise, are you OK? Are you <span>upset</span> about <span>leaving</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes. I've loved working here. I've made some good <span>friends</span>... like you <span>Anna</span>... Oh, and being able to make free phone <span>calls</span> has been good. What am I going to do now?<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>dear</span> Anna. It sounds like Denise needs some <span>career</span> advice.<br/>
🎧 <span>Career</span> advice?<br/>
🎧 She needs some <span>guidance</span> on what to do next and where to find another <span>job</span>. What would you do in her <span>situation</span>?<br/>
🎧 Look in the <span>newspaper</span>, <span>ring</span> my <span>contacts</span>, <span>register</span> with a <span>job</span> <span>agency</span>?<br/>
🎧 Exactly! I'm sure you can give her some good advice. Go on, give it a go!<br/>
🎧 OK, I'll try. <span>Cheer</span> up Denise, you need to think <span>positively</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do I? I'm <span>unemployed</span> from <span>tomorrow</span>, how am I ever going to find another <span>job</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, have you <span>tried</span> <span>looking</span> in the <span>job</span> <span>section</span> of the <span>newspaper</span>?<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 It's a good place to start. And there are <span>loads</span> of <span>job-finding</span> <span>websites</span> you could <span>sign</span> up for.<br/>
🎧 I don't have a <span>computer</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well what about <span>ringing</span> some of the people you <span>know;</span> <span>contacts</span> who may know about a <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, I hadn't thought about that.<br/>
🎧 And of course, you could <span>register</span> with a <span>recruitment</span> <span>agency</span>. They're good at <span>finding</span> <span>jobs</span> for you.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's a good idea. Anna, you're <span>brilliant</span>! What great <span>ideas</span>... you're so kind <span>and</span>... <span>thoughtful</span>.<br/>
🎧 Anna could <span>you</span>... Oh no, she's <span>crying</span> again.<br/>
🎧 Oh no, shall we go back into your <span>office</span> Paul?<br/>
🎧 No, no. It's OK, Denise is <span>crying</span> with <span>happiness</span>. She's feeling better now.<br/>
🎧 Oh well, in that <span>case</span>... shall we all <span>gather</span> <span>round</span> and <span>officially</span> say <span>goodbye</span> to Denise.<br/>
🎧 It's an <span>emotional</span> day for Denise, but Anna has been really <span>useful</span> with her <span>career</span> advice. If a <span>professional</span> <span>career</span> <span>advisor</span> is not <span>available</span>, <span>giving</span> some of your own advice can sometimes be <span>useful</span>. Let's hear again what Anna <span>suggested<br/></span>...
🎧 You need to think <span>positively</span>.<br/>
🎧 Try <span>looking</span> in the <span>job</span> <span>section</span> of the <span>newspaper</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>loads</span> of <span>job-finding</span> <span>websites</span> you could <span>sign</span> up for.<br/>
🎧 What about <span>ringing</span> some of the people you know?<br/>
🎧 You could <span>register</span> with a <span>recruitment</span> <span>agency</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK everyone, the time has come to say <span>farewell</span> to Denise. It's with <span>regret</span> we've had to let her go.<br/>
🎧 We? You, Paul.<br/>
🎧 <span>Pau<br/></span>
🎧 Thank you for all your <span>hard</span> work and we wish you very well in the future.<br/>
🎧 Anna, I think we have a <span>gift</span> for Denise?<br/>
🎧 There you go Denise. <span>Careful</span>, it's quite <span>heavy</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, what a <span>beautiful</span> <span>fruit</span> <span>bowl</span>... and full of <span>plastic</span> <span>fruit</span>!<br/>
🎧 I'll get it. Sorry about that everyone. That was a <span>company</span> called <span>Nice'n'Cheesy</span>, they <span>remember</span> you Anna. They <span>liked</span> your <span>sales</span> <span>pitch</span> and want to <span>order</span> a <span>hundred</span> <span>thousand</span> <span>plastic</span> <span>grapes</span> to go with their <span>cheeses</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>What?</span>! <span>Brilliant</span>! <span>Ooops</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 My new <span>fruit</span> <span>bowl</span>! <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh <span>dear</span>. <span>Poor</span> Denise! It looks like she might be <span>leaving</span> the <span>company</span> at just the wrong time. I <span>wonder</span> if she'll be back? You'll have to join us again for the next <span>episode</span> of English at Work. Bye!<br/>
<span><br/></span>

🎧 I can't find any <span>pens</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, here it is.<br/>
🎧 Will <span>someone</span> answer that phone?<br/>
🎧 Hello again and <span>welcome</span> back to English at Work. The <span>offices</span> of Tip Top <span>Trading</span> have become <span>chaotic</span> since Denise <span>left</span> and just at a time when things are getting <span>busy</span>. How is everyone going to <span>cope</span>? Let's find out.<br/>
🎧 Hello. Yes? It is. We're very <span>busy</span> at the <span>moment</span> so call back later. Bye.<br/>
🎧 That was a bit <span>rude</span> Tom.<br/>
🎧 Well we're too <span>busy</span> to be nice.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>. Not a good <span>attitude</span> Tom. Even when you are <span>busy</span> at work it's <span>important</span> to be <span>polite</span> on the phone. It could be a <span>potential</span> <span>customer</span>. Anna, I think you're going to have to <span>remind</span> Tom about this.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I think so.<br/>
🎧 If things are <span>busy</span> in the <span>office</span> you could say to <span>someone</span> on the phone <span>'we're</span> a bit <span>busy</span> at the <span>moment</span>, could I take your name and <span>number</span> and we'll call you <span>back'</span>? And, <span>'when</span> would be a <span>convenient</span> time to call <span>you?'</span> or if the <span>caller</span> <span>wants</span> to speak to <span>someone</span> <span>specific</span> you could say <span>'could</span> I take a <span>message</span> please and I'll make sure he or she <span>calls</span> you <span>back?'<br/></span>
🎧 That's <span>useful</span>. Oh there <span>goes</span> the phone again.<br/>
🎧 Anna, could you get that please? I've got a <span>mouthful</span> of <span>biscuit</span>. Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Sure Paul. Hello? Tip Top <span>Trading</span>... yes, that's <span>right</span>... but things are a bit <span>busy</span> at the <span>moment</span>. Could I take your name and <span>number</span> and I'll call you back as soon as I <span>can</span>... oh <span>hold</span> on, has <span>anyone</span> got a pen?<br/>
🎧 I think we've run out. Denise usually <span>orders</span> them. Here, use my <span>souvenir</span> pen I <span>bought</span> in <span>Italy</span>, you see it changes <span>colour</span> if you <span>hold</span> it up to the <span>light</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks. Oh no! There's no <span>paper</span> to <span>write</span> it on.<br/>
🎧 Here, <span>write</span> it on my <span>hand</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK. <span>Hold</span> still. <span>7-4-9-0-5-6-8</span>. Thanks for your <span>patience</span>, when is a good time to call you back? <span></span>... <span>OK</span>... <span>3</span> <span>o'clock</span>... I'll call you then. <span>Goodbye</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sounds <span>important</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Possibly</span>. Oh not again! Hello, Tip Top <span>Trading</span>, Anna <span>speaking</span>... I <span>see</span>... Well he doesn't <span>seem</span> to be here at the <span>moment</span>... can I take a <span>message</span> and I'll get him to call you back? Tom, I need your other <span>hand</span> to <span>write</span> <span>on</span>... keep still. OK, what's the <span>message</span>? <span></span>... Yes, call <span>Bob</span> about the <span>lemons</span> on <span>8-0-9-5-2-4</span>. OK, I'll <span>pass</span> that on. Thanks. Bye.<br/>
🎧 <span>Goodness</span>. It's been <span>crazy</span> here since Denise <span>left</span>. Look we've even run out of <span>teabags</span>. I'll go and get some, shall I?<br/>
🎧 <span>Hold</span> on Tom. Has that <span>invoice</span> for <span>Tutti</span> <span>Fruity</span> been <span>sent</span> out yet?<br/>
🎧 I <span>dunno</span>. Denise usually <span>sends</span> out the <span>paperwork</span>.<br/>
🎧 I wish Denise was here!<br/>
🎧 So do we all! It sounds like <span>chaos</span> in the <span>office</span> but <span>however</span> <span>hectic</span> things can get, <span>remember</span> to <span>remain</span> <span>professional</span> when <span>answering</span> the phone. Here's a <span>reminder</span> of some of the <span>phrases</span> you could <span>use<br/></span>...
🎧 We're a bit <span>busy</span> at the <span>moment;</span> could I take your name and <span>number</span> and we'll call you back?<br/>
🎧 When would be a <span>convenient</span> time to call you?<br/>
🎧 Could I take a <span>message</span> please and I'll make sure he or she <span>calls</span> you back?<br/>
🎧 Ah there you are, Tom, you've been a long time. I need to give Paul that <span>important</span> <span>message</span> I <span>wrote</span> on your <span>hand</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ah... <span>yes</span>... it's a bit <span>tricky</span>. You see, I went to the <span>toilet</span> and then <span>I</span>... <span>washed</span> my <span>hands</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh no, you've <span>washed</span> the <span>messages</span> off! What are we going to do now?<br/>
🎧 <span>Erm</span>... I'll get that, shall I?<br/>
🎧 We can't <span>carry</span> on like this.<br/>
🎧 No you can't! Has Anna <span>lost</span> the <span>numbers</span> of two <span>potential</span> <span>clients</span>? Can the <span>company</span> <span>carry</span> on like this? It <span>certainly</span> looks like it could do with another <span>pair</span> of <span>hands</span>. What will <span>happen</span> next? Join us again next time for English at Work. Bye!<br/>
<span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>Welcome</span> back to the <span>chaotic</span> <span>offices</span> of Tip Top <span>Trading</span>. Now Denise has <span>left</span> the <span>company</span>, the place is a <span>mess</span> and <span>important</span> phone <span>messages</span> are being <span>lost</span>. What can be done to make things better? I think we know the answer!<br/>
🎧 Hi. Did <span>anyone</span> take a <span>message</span> for me while I was out? I'm <span>expecting</span> an <span>important</span> call.<br/>
🎧 <span>Err</span>... no!<br/>
🎧 Actually yes Paul. I <span>wrote</span> it on <span>Tom's</span> <span>hand</span> but he <span>washed</span> it off.<br/>
🎧 Look, good <span>hygiene's</span> very <span>important</span> to me.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>. That's not very good is it? What's wrong with <span>writing</span> on a <span>piece</span> of <span>paper</span>?<br/>
🎧 We've run out of <span>paper</span>... and <span>pens</span>.<br/>
🎧 Everything really. <span>Nobody's</span> <span>ordered</span> any <span>stationery</span> or <span>tidied</span> up the <span>office</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's since Denise <span>left</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, maybe I was a bit <span>hasty</span> getting rid of her. It was really just to <span>save</span> money.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, but look, if we can't take <span>messages</span> from <span>possible</span> <span>clients</span> we're going to <span>lose</span> even more money.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yes</span>... I <span>suppose</span> you have a <span>point</span>. Maybe I will to have <span>reinstate</span> her.<br/>
🎧 You mean, get her back?<br/>
🎧 Yes Anna, he does. Another way of saying <span>reinstate</span> is he's got to <span>'reverse</span> his <span>decision'</span>. It <span>means</span> Paul has got to make an <span>awkward</span> call to Denise.<br/>
🎧 Look Paul, you're going to have to call her and tell her you've made an <span>error</span>... a <span>huge</span> one actually.<br/>
🎧 It wasn't that <span>huge</span>? <span>Actually</span>... Anna, you're her good friend, would you like to call her?<br/>
🎧 <span>Me?</span>! <span>B-b-but</span> I can't.<br/>
🎧 What a <span>coward</span>! I think it's time to <span>stand</span> your <span>ground</span> Anna. Tell him <span>"You're</span> the <span>boss</span>, I think it's better <span>coming</span> from <span>you"</span>, and <span>remind</span> him <span>"it</span> was your <span>decision</span> so you need to <span>explain</span> the <span>situation"</span>, and <span>remind</span> him <span>"this</span> is your <span>responsibility"</span>. You could <span>suggest</span> he <span>says</span> <span>"I'm</span> sorry, I made a <span>mistake</span> and we would love to have you <span>back."<br/></span>
🎧 OK. Do you know what Paul, I think the <span>news</span> is better <span>coming</span> from <span>you</span>... just to make it <span>official</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah Paul, you are the <span>boss</span> after all.<br/>
🎧 And it was your <span>decision</span> in the first place so you need to <span>explain</span> that the <span>situation</span> has <span>changed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, maybe you're right but I can't tell her I'm wrong can I?<br/>
🎧 Look, just say you're sorry. Tell her you made a <span>mistake</span> and I would love to have you <span>back</span>... we all would.<br/>
🎧 <span>PaulYes</span>, you're right. I should do it. I'll just have a <span>quick</span> <span>biscuit</span>. Here <span>goes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hello?<br/>
🎧 Ah... <span>h-h-h-ello</span> Denise. It's <span>me</span>... <span>Paul…your</span> <span>boss</span>... your <span>ex-boss</span> from Tip Top <span>Trading</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh.<br/>
🎧 How are <span>you</span>... getting on?<br/>
🎧 <span>Well<br/></span>...
🎧 Good, good. Actually, I've been <span>rethinking</span> our <span>staffing</span> <span>situation</span> in the <span>office<br/></span>...
🎧 Yes?<br/>
🎧 <span>And…well</span>... I'm sorry <span>Denise</span>... <span>I</span>... <span>miscalculated</span> my <span>staffing</span> <span>numbers</span>.<br/>
🎧 You mean you made a <span>mistake</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I <span>suppose</span> so. <span>So</span>... I would love to have you back in the <span>office</span> as soon as <span>possible</span>. What do you say?<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, let me think about <span>it</span>... <span>hmmm</span>... <span>errr</span>... well... <span>hmmm<br/></span>...
🎧 What will Denise decide? It was a <span>hard</span> phone call for Paul to make, but not one Anna should have made as it wasn't her <span>mistake</span>. She <span>stood</span> her <span>ground</span> with Paul and used the <span>following</span> <span>phrases:<br/></span>
🎧 You're the <span>boss</span> and I think the <span>news</span> is better <span>coming</span> from you.<br/>
🎧 It was your <span>decision</span> in the first place so you need to <span>explain</span> that the <span>situation</span> has <span>changed</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is your <span>responsibility</span>.<br/>
🎧 And here is a <span>reminder</span> of the <span>phrases</span> Paul used to try and <span>apologise:<br/></span>
🎧 I've been <span>rethinking</span> our <span>staffing</span> <span>situation</span> in the <span>office</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sorry, I made a <span>mistake</span>. I <span>miscalculated</span> my <span>staffing</span> <span>numbers</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would love to have you back in the <span>office</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmmm</span>... well... OK then. I'll start back <span>tomorrow</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>wonderful</span>. I'm so <span>pleased</span>. We'll get your old <span>chair</span> back in <span>position</span>.<br/>
🎧 Actually Paul, if you want me back I'll need a new <span>chair</span>... and a new <span>phone<br/></span>...
🎧 OK Denise! See you <span>tomorrow</span>.<br/>
🎧 And a pay <span>rise</span>!<br/>
🎧 So, is she <span>coming</span> back then?<br/>
🎧 Yes, first thing <span>tomorrow</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's good because we've just had a call from <span>Nice'n'Cheesy</span> <span>–</span> they said <span>nobody</span> <span>returned</span> their call <span>yesterday</span> and that if we don't <span>contact</span> them by the end of <span>tomorrow</span> they will go <span>elsewhere</span> for their <span>plastic</span> <span>grapes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, we must <span>act</span>... and act <span>fast</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's hope they don't <span>lose</span> that <span>contract</span>. At <span>least</span> with Denise <span>returning</span> to work, things will be a little more <span>organised</span> but for how long? Join us again next time on English at Work. Bye!<br/>

🎧 <span>Quick</span>, <span>gather</span> <span>round</span>, here she comes.<br/>
🎧 <span>Welcome</span> back Denise, we just couldn't <span>survive</span> without you.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>bless</span> you.<br/>
🎧 Yes <span>welcome</span> back to Tip Top <span>Trading</span> Denise. Paul, the <span>boss</span>, was a little <span>hasty</span> in getting rid of her so now he's <span>asked</span> her back but <span>negotiated</span> some new <span>conditions</span> which <span>include</span> <span>learning</span> how to be a <span>Sales</span> <span>Executive</span>, like Anna. But who's going to <span>show</span> her what to do?<br/>
🎧 Oh, hello Denise. Nice to have you back. I <span>suppose</span> I had to eat my <span>words</span> didn't I?<br/>
🎧 Yes, well it makes a change from <span>biscuits</span>! Now, where have you put my <span>stapler</span> and my red <span>pens</span>?<br/>
🎧 Don't <span>worry</span> about that, I've got you a new <span>stapler</span> and a new <span>desk</span>, right here next to Anna.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>lovely</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well you wanted some <span>experience</span> in <span>sales</span>, so I thought Anna could <span>show</span> you the <span>ropes</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ropes</span>? I don't have any <span>ropes</span>!<br/>
🎧 Anna, if you <span>'show</span> <span>someone</span> the <span>ropes'</span> it <span>means</span> you <span>explain</span> to <span>someone</span> how to do the <span>job</span>. You'll be great at that.<br/>
🎧 Oh I see. Well I might know what to do but I'm no good at <span>explaining</span> it to <span>someone</span> else.<br/>
🎧 Well the best way is to start at the <span>beginning</span>. Why not <span>suggest</span> to her to <span>'watch</span> what I <span>do'</span>, or give her some of your <span>tasks</span> and say <span>'please</span> could you make a start on <span>these?'</span> and then <span>reassure</span> her by saying <span>'I'm</span> here to help so please ask me if you need to know what to <span>do.'</span> Good <span>luck</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks! So Denise, it's nice to have you back, how's your new <span>desk</span>?<br/>
🎧 Much <span>bigger</span> than my old one <span>–</span> and look, it <span>goes</span> <span>up….and</span> down.<br/>
🎧 Yes it does. OK, shall we make a start then and I'll <span>show</span> you the <span>ropes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes Anna, of course Anna. Do I need to use the phone?<br/>
🎧 I <span>reckon</span> you're quite <span>experienced</span> with the phone already Denise!<br/>
🎧 Thank you Tom. We won't make any <span>calls</span> yet, just <span>watch</span> what I do for a while. Look, I'm just <span>checking</span> our <span>database</span> so see who we haven't called for a while.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes.<br/>
🎧 I'm just <span>checking</span> the <span>dates</span> <span>here…in</span> <span>fact</span> Denise, why don't you make a start on this.<br/>
🎧 Of <span>course…oh</span> look, my <span>phone's</span> <span>ringing</span>.<br/>
🎧 Are you going to answer it then?<br/>
🎧 Oh right. Hello, Tip Top <span>Trading</span>, Denise <span>speaking…oh</span> hello <span>Marge</span>! <span>(To</span> <span>Anna)</span> It's <span>Marge</span>, Anna!<br/>
🎧 Oh right. I'll leave you to it <span>–</span> I'm here to help, so please ask me if you need to know what to do.<br/>
🎧 OK Anna, I won't be long. So <span>Marge</span>, how did it go the other <span>night</span>? Really? Really! Well, I'm <span>sitting</span> at my new <span>desk<br/></span>...
🎧 Nice to have her back <span>hey?</span>! Some <span>Sales</span> <span>Exec</span> she's going to be!<br/>
🎧 Everyone has to start somewhere Tom! Now Anna is <span>helping</span> <span>–</span> or <span>coaching</span> <span>-</span> Denise I'm sure she'll become an <span>excellent</span> <span>worker</span>. Here are some of the <span>phrases</span> Anna used to help <span>her:<br/></span>
🎧 Let me <span>show</span> you the <span>ropes</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Watch</span> what I do for a while.<br/>
🎧 Why don't you make a start on this?<br/>
🎧 I'm here to help, so please ask me if you need to know what to do.<br/>
🎧 Let's find out how Denise is getting on.<br/>
🎧 So I said to him, it's just not my <span>colour…yes</span> <span>exactly…hold</span> on <span>Marge</span>, <span>everyone's</span> <span>looking</span> at me. I'd better call you back. Yes, <span>tonight</span>. Bye!<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, you've <span>certainly</span> got a good phone <span>manner</span>. Do you think you could <span>order</span> some <span>pens</span> now, we've run out.<br/>
🎧 That's not my <span>responsibility</span> <span>anymore</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Err</span>, I think it is.<br/>
🎧 Isn't!<br/>
🎧 Is.<br/>
🎧 Isn't!<br/>
🎧 You two, please!<br/>
🎧 Well, she's got time for <span>personal</span> <span>calls</span> but not to <span>order</span> <span>pens</span>. Oh <span>hold</span> <span>on….Oh</span> Hi <span>Jim</span>, how's things? Yeah! Did you catch the <span>match</span> last <span>night</span>? What a <span>goal</span>!<br/>

🎧 Oh <span>dear</span> Anna. Things aren't going well. It's time to <span>sort</span> things out again but what are you going to do? Join us again next time to find out. Bye!<br/>
