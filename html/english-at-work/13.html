🎧 <span>Hello</span> again and <span>welcome</span> back to the <span>final</span> English at Work. Mr <span>Socrates</span> has <span>sacked</span> <span>Paul</span> from his <span>position</span> as <span>manager</span> of Tip Top <span>Trading</span> and he's <span>offered</span> <span>Anna</span> a <span>promotion</span> <span>–</span> to be the new <span>boss</span>. But will she <span>accept</span>? What's wrong <span>Anna</span>?<br/>
🎧 I feel bad about <span>replacing</span> <span>Paul</span>. He's been good to me.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>business</span> <span>Anna</span>. He's just not up to the <span>job</span> <span>–</span> but you are.<br/>
🎧 Thanks. But why me? Can I do the <span>job</span>? I'm not as <span>experienced</span> as <span>Tom</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think we have <span>seen</span> over the year that you definitely have more <span>experience</span> than <span>Tom</span>! Go on <span>Anna</span>, you can do it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmmm</span>.<br/>
🎧 So <span>Anna…</span> what do you say? Will you <span>replace</span> <span>Paul</span> as the new <span>boss</span> of Tip Top <span>Trading</span>? Come on <span>Anna</span>. This <span>promotion</span> <span>recognises</span> your <span>achievements</span> at the <span>company</span>. It's an <span>opportunity</span> of a <span>lifetime</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 You'll be my <span>right-hand</span> man.<br/>
🎧 I think he <span>means</span> <span>right-hand</span> <span>woman</span>! It <span>means</span> you'd be his most <span>trusted</span> and <span>invaluable</span> <span>assistant</span>.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna</span>, if you need time to think you could say <span>"thank</span> you for your kind <span>words"</span> and, <span>"could</span> I have time to <span>consider</span> your <span>offer?"<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Erm</span>, Mr <span>Socrates</span>. This <span>news</span> has come as a bit of a <span>shock</span>. Thank you for your kind <span>words</span> but please could I have some time to <span>consider</span> your <span>offer</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh…</span> OK <span>Anna</span>. But don't leave it too long. I have a <span>habit</span> of <span>changing</span> my <span>mind</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, Mr <span>Socrates…</span> I mean <span>Brad…</span> I'll <span>call</span> you back soon. <span>Bye</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh…</span> has Mr <span>S</span> <span>offered</span> you <span>Paul's</span> <span>job</span> by any <span>chance</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes!<br/>
🎧 And you said you'd think about it?<br/>
🎧 Yes. I'm not sure if I can take on that much <span>responsibility</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's easy <span>peasy</span>. I could do it <span>standing</span> on my <span>head</span>.<br/>
🎧 But he's not <span>offering­</span> you the <span>job</span> <span>Tom</span>.<br/>
🎧 Please don't <span>mention</span> this to <span>Paul…</span> not <span>yet…</span> he's very <span>upset</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know <span>nothing</span>!<br/>
🎧 You know <span>nothing</span>? About what?<br/>
🎧 I mean, I'll <span>remain</span> <span>tight</span> <span>lipped…</span> I won't say a <span>word…</span> <span>until</span> it's all <span>official</span> like. You can <span>count</span> on me.<br/>
🎧 <span>"You</span> can <span>count</span> on <span>me"!</span>?<br/>
🎧 Uh?<br/>
🎧 <span>"You</span> can <span>count</span> on <span>me"</span>. That was the <span>message</span> with that that <span>bunch</span> of <span>flowers</span> <span>someone</span> <span>sent</span> me. It was you wasn't <span>it?</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Well…</span> <span>err…</span> I <span>suppose…</span> <span>yes…</span> it was me <span>Anna</span>. I couldn't help it. <span>I…</span> <span>I…</span> love you <span>Anna</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you know what <span>Tom…</span> I quite like you <span>too…</span> I think <span>you're…</span> <span>sweet</span>. Now come on and give me a <span>kiss</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>crumbs</span>, <span>shall</span> I come back <span>later?</span>!<br/>
🎧 No it's ok <span>Paul</span>. <span>We’re</span> <span>just…</span> getting to know each other a bit better. In <span>fact</span>, <span>Anna…</span> I'd like to ask you something. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh, why is <span>Tom</span> getting down on one <span>knee</span>?<br/>
🎧 I <span>expect</span> he's <span>dropped</span> one of his <span>contact</span> <span>lenses</span>.<br/>
🎧 No it's not that. <span>Anna</span>, I'd like to ask you <span>something…</span> <span>err…</span> will <span>you…</span> will you <span>marry</span> me?<br/>
🎧 <span>What?</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Crikey</span>, what a <span>dilemma</span>. Now <span>Anna's</span> got two <span>important</span> <span>questions</span> to <span>answer</span>. Will she take the <span>job</span> as Tip Top <span>Trading's</span> <span>newest</span> and <span>youngest</span> <span>manager</span>? And will she <span>marry</span> <span>Tom</span>? Here's a <span>reminder</span> of what Mr <span>Socrates</span> had to say about <span>her:<br/></span>
🎧 This <span>promotion</span> <span>recognises</span> your <span>achievements</span> at the <span>company</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 It's an <span>opportunity</span> of a <span>lifetime</span>.<br/>
🎧 You would be my <span>right-hand</span> man.<br/>
🎧 And if <span>Anna</span> <span>accepts</span> the <span>job</span>, here's what she could <span>say:<br/></span>
🎧 I'd be <span>delighted</span> to <span>accept</span>. Thank you.<br/>
🎧 When would I start?<br/>
🎧 Could we <span>discuss</span> the <span>terms</span> and <span>conditions</span> of the new <span>job</span>?<br/>
🎧 Let's find out what <span>Anna</span> has to say.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>Tom</span>, I don't know what to say. It's come as a bit of a <span>shock</span>. Can I have some time to think about it?<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, while you think about that, I've got some good <span>news</span>. I've been <span>offered</span> a new <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>fantastic</span> <span>news</span> <span>Paul</span>. What is it?<br/>
🎧 It's to be <span>Head</span> <span>Taster</span> at a <span>company</span> <span>called</span> Better <span>Biscuits</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>fantastic</span> <span>news</span> <span>Paul</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, well done <span>Paul</span>. That's right up your <span>street</span>.<br/>
🎧 So <span>Anna</span>, does that mean you'll do <span>Paul’s</span> <span>job</span> now?<br/>
🎧 Don't <span>answer</span> that. <span>Answer</span> my <span>proposal</span> first.<br/>
🎧 No, I think she should <span>sort</span> out her work first.<br/>
🎧 But I've been <span>waiting</span> to ask her for <span>months</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think it's up to <span>Anna</span> to say what she <span>wants</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Quiet</span>! Look everyone, I can't decide what to say to you <span>Tom</span>, or Mr <span>Socrates</span>. So I've <span>decided</span> I'm going to take a short <span>holiday</span> to have some time to think.<br/>
🎧 Good idea. Where <span>shall</span> we go?<br/>
🎧 On my own <span>Tom</span>. When I <span>return</span> I will give you my <span>answers</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Crumbs</span>. I think I'd better get a <span>biscuit</span>.<br/>
🎧 A good idea <span>Anna</span>. But <span>we’re</span> going to have to wait a while to find out what she <span>decides</span>. She needs a <span>rest</span> after <span>learning</span> so much during her year at Tip Top <span>Trading</span>. We hope you've <span>enjoyed</span> <span>learning</span> with her and now feel more <span>confident</span> in <span>using</span> English at work! <span>That’s</span> all from me and the <span>team</span> at Tip Top <span>Trading</span> for now. <span>Until</span> we meet again, <span>bye</span>!<br/>
<span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>Hello</span> again and <span>welcome</span> back to English at Work <span>–</span> the <span>drama</span> about life at the <span>plastic</span> <span>fruit</span> <span>production</span> <span>company</span> <span>called</span> Tip Top <span>Trading</span>. You may <span>remember</span> <span>Anna</span>, the <span>company's</span> <span>newest</span> and <span>brightest</span> <span>sales</span> <span>executive</span>, was <span>offered</span> a <span>promotion</span> and a <span>marriage</span> <span>proposal</span> at the same time. She's taken time out to think about her <span>reply</span> but everyone in the <span>office</span> really <span>misses</span> her.<br/>
🎧 I <span>dunno</span> <span>Denise</span>, I'd be good for <span>Anna</span>, I think we would be been a <span>perfect</span> <span>pair</span>. Mr and <span>Mrs</span> <span>Darcy…</span> it sounds <span>good…<br/></span>
🎧 I'm back!<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna</span>! <span>I…we</span> weren't <span>expecting</span> you.<br/>
🎧 Yes I can see <span>–</span> <span>perhaps</span> you could <span>tidy</span> up your <span>desk</span> <span>Tom</span>.<br/>
🎧 Very funny <span>Anna</span> <span>–</span> still trying to be the <span>boss</span>! So did you have a good <span>trip</span>? Did you get some <span>'head</span> <span>space'</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Eh</span>?<br/>
🎧 He <span>means</span> time <span>alone</span> to think about the things you want to think about. Tell him you've been <span>chewing</span> things over <span>–</span> it <span>means</span> you've been thinking about your <span>proposals</span> and say I have come to a <span>final</span> <span>decision</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, well it's <span>true;</span> I have done a lot of thinking. <span>Tom</span>, I did have some <span>head</span> <span>space</span> and a <span>chance</span> <span>to…</span> <span>chew</span> things <span>over…<br/></span>
🎧 Yes! Yes! And?<br/>
🎧 And I've come to a <span>final</span> <span>decision</span>. The <span>answer</span> is <span>'yes'</span>. I <span>accept</span>. There's no <span>doubt</span> <span>really…</span> I should give it a <span>go…</span> I need the <span>experience…</span> and <span>besides</span>, what's the <span>worst</span> thing that can <span>happen</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>Anna</span>. I'm so happy. You won't <span>regret</span> your <span>decision</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span> <span>–</span> is <span>Anna</span> really saying <span>'yes'</span> to <span>Tom's</span> <span>marriage</span> <span>proposal</span> or has there been a <span>misunderstanding</span>?<br/>
🎧 Here are some of the <span>phrases</span> we've <span>heard</span> <span>today:<br/></span>
🎧 I've had a <span>chance</span> to <span>chew</span> things <span>over<br/></span>
🎧 I've come to a <span>final</span> <span>decision<br/></span>
🎧 I'll give it a <span>go<br/></span>
🎧 You won't <span>regret</span> your <span>decision</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 Find out if we can look forward to <span>Anna</span> and <span>Tom's</span> <span>wedding</span> in the next <span>episode</span> of English at Work. <span>Bye</span>!<br/>

🎧 <span>Welcome</span> back to the <span>offices</span> of Tip Top <span>Trading</span> where there's a bit of <span>confusion</span>. <span>Anna…<br/></span>
🎧 Yes?<br/>
🎧 I think <span>Tom's</span> got the wrong end of the <span>stick</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I didn't give him a <span>stick</span>.<br/>
🎧 No, no. I think there's been a <span>misunderstanding</span>. When you said your <span>answer</span> was <span>'yes'</span> he thought you <span>meant</span> <span>'yes</span>, I'll <span>marry</span> <span>you'</span>!<br/>
🎧 Oh no! I <span>meant</span> yes to the <span>promotion</span>. <span>Gosh</span> I've got to <span>sort</span> this out. <span>Tom</span>, <span>Tom</span>, <span>hold</span> on please.<br/>
🎧 We can't <span>hang</span> about <span>Anna</span>. Let's fix a <span>date</span>, <span>invite</span> everyone <span>–</span> even <span>Paul</span>.<br/>
🎧 No, no, we can't.<br/>
🎧 You're right, not <span>Paul</span> <span>–</span> he just <span>talks</span> about <span>biscuits</span>.<br/>
🎧 No. I mean <span>'no'</span>, we can't get <span>married</span>. I <span>meant</span> yes to the <span>promotion</span>. I can't <span>marry</span> you.<br/>
🎧 What? So when you said <span>'yes'</span> you <span>meant</span> <span>'no'</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 I see. Right, that's it. <span>Anna</span>, I've made it very <span>clear</span> what I think about you and <span>you…</span> <span>you…</span> just <span>throw</span> it back in my <span>face</span>. I've had <span>enough…</span> enough of <span>you…</span> enough of this <span>company</span>. I <span>quit</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna</span>. I think he's <span>upset</span>. He's having a <span>tantrum</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>tantrum</span> <span>–</span> is that <span>serious</span>?<br/>
🎧 Not really. Maybe you need to <span>calm</span> him down and make him change his <span>mind</span>. Tell him <span>'not</span> to be too <span>hasty'</span>, <span>'don't</span> <span>rush</span> into a <span>decision'</span> and say <span>'we</span> can work this <span>out'</span> <span>–</span> you can can't you?<br/>
🎧 I think I can. <span>Tom</span>, please, don't be too <span>hasty</span>. Let's talk about this. We can work something out, just don't <span>rush</span> into <span>making</span> a <span>decision</span> <span>–</span> please. You're my best <span>–</span> my only <span>–</span> <span>sales</span> <span>executive</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sorry</span> <span>Anna</span> <span>–</span> I'm a free <span>spirit</span>. I must go where the <span>wind</span> takes me. You've had your <span>chance</span>, now <span>it’s</span> <span>mine</span>. <span>I’m</span> off.<br/>
🎧 Wow, I've never <span>seen</span> <span>Tom</span> be such <span>a…</span> man. Will this be the last time we ever see him?<br/>
🎧 Here are some of the <span>phrases</span> <span>Anna</span> used to try and get <span>Tom</span> not to <span>leave:<br/></span>
🎧 Don't be too <span>hasty<br/></span>
🎧 Don't <span>rush</span> into <span>making</span> a <span>decision<br/></span>
🎧 We can work this <span>out<br/></span>
🎧 <span>…erm</span>, <span>sorry</span>, I just <span>forgot</span> to take my special <span>mug</span>. <span>Bye</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>Hello</span> again. At the <span>offices</span> of Tip Top <span>Trading</span> things are a bit <span>strange</span> after <span>Tom</span> <span>walked…</span> <span>stormed</span> out in a <span>huff</span> after <span>realising</span> that <span>Anna</span> was never going to <span>marry</span> him. So <span>Anna</span>, I <span>suppose</span> you can get on with being the <span>manager</span> now?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I <span>suppose</span> so. But <span>something's</span> not right.<br/>
🎧 Well, you've <span>lost</span> a <span>valuable</span> <span>member</span> of your <span>team</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know, and a good friend too.<br/>
🎧 Well, you're the <span>boss</span> now <span>–</span> it's time to <span>deal</span> with the <span>situation</span> and get down to <span>business</span>. Tell the <span>team</span> you'll be <span>finding</span> a <span>replacement</span> for <span>Tom</span> and you're going to make some changes in the <span>office</span>. You could also say you want to <span>turn</span> the <span>business</span> <span>round</span> and make it really <span>successful</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, thanks. <span>Excuse</span> me everyone, could we <span>gather</span> <span>round</span> for a <span>quick</span> <span>meeting</span> please. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Anna</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh, it's just you now <span>Denise</span>. Right, well, I need to get down to <span>business</span> so I'll be <span>advertising</span> for a <span>replacement</span> for <span>Tom</span> today <span>–</span> in <span>fact</span> <span>Denise</span>, you might be <span>interested</span> in that? And I want to make some changes in the <span>office</span>. I need to <span>turn</span> this <span>business</span> <span>round</span> and <span>…</span> make it the <span>world's</span> <span>leading</span> <span>plastic</span> <span>fruit</span> <span>production</span> <span>company</span> <span>and…</span> <span>I'm…</span> <span>keen</span> to <span>hear…</span> your <span>ideas</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is everything alright?<br/>
🎧 <span>Err…</span> I can't <span>stop</span> thinking about <span>Tom</span>. He <span>seemed</span> so <span>upset</span> when he <span>left</span> <span>and…</span> it's not the same without him around. He made me <span>laugh</span> <span>and…</span> I <span>miss</span> his <span>floppy</span> <span>hair</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna</span>, it's time to <span>swallow</span> your <span>pride</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Swallow</span> what?<br/>
🎧 <span>Admit</span> you are wrong <span>–</span> be <span>honest</span> with <span>yourself</span> and <span>follow</span> your <span>heart</span> <span>–</span> go and <span>marry</span> <span>Tom</span>! <span>Although</span> <span>personally</span>, I don't know what you see in him. <span><br/></span>
🎧 You're right! Why didn't I see it? <span>Tom</span> is the man for me <span>–</span> I must <span>call</span> him and find out where he is <span>…</span> oh no, his <span>phone's</span> <span>switched</span> off. Where can I find him? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Hey <span>Anna</span>. You <span>looking</span> for <span>Tom</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes Mr <span>Ingle</span>, I am.<br/>
🎧 I saw him a while ago, in a <span>real</span> <span>rage</span>, getting into a <span>taxi</span>. He told me he'd <span>booked</span> a <span>flight</span> to <span>Australia</span> and was <span>heading</span> for the <span>airport</span>. He said something about being a <span>'free</span> <span>spirit'</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Struth</span>! <span>Tom</span> really is going too <span>far</span> <span>–</span> to the other end of the <span>world</span> in <span>fact</span>. Does this mean we'll never hear from <span>Tom</span> again? For now, let's <span>remind</span> <span>ourselves</span> of some of the <span>phrases</span> <span>Anna</span> used to <span>deal</span> with a <span>difficult</span> <span>situation:<br/></span>
🎧 I'll be <span>advertising</span> for a <span>replacement</span> for <span>Tom</span> <span>today<br/></span>
🎧 I want to make some changes in the <span>office<br/></span>
🎧 I need to <span>turn</span> this <span>business</span> <span>round<br/></span>
🎧 I'm <span>keen</span> to hear your <span>ideas<br/></span>
🎧 <span>…but</span> work can wait. I've got to get to the <span>airport</span> quickly before <span>Tom</span> <span>gets</span> on that <span>flight</span>. <span>Taxi</span>! <span>Taxi</span>!<br/>
🎧 This is going to be <span>interesting</span>!<br/>
<span><br/></span>

All their friends, work <span>colleagues</span> and <span>business</span> <span>acquaintances</span> are <span>there…</span> such as Mr <span>Lime…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Fantastic</span> <span>Anna</span>, <span>fantastic</span>!<br/>

🎧 I think the <span>office</span> at Tip Top <span>Trading</span> is an <span>ideal</span> place for a <span>wedding</span> and <span>besides</span> <span>the…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Anna</span>! My <span>favourite</span> girl. I got here as <span>fast</span> I could. I thought I was the only man for you but I <span>guess</span> <span>Tom</span> has <span>stolen</span> that <span>title</span>! Your <span>choice</span> <span>Anna</span>, your <span>choice</span>!<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>hello</span> Mr <span>Socrates</span>, this is a nice <span>surprise</span>. Come over here and say <span>hello</span> to <span>Tom</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hey <span>Tom</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>hello</span> Mr <span>S</span>. Nice to see you. You're not doing any <span>firing</span> today are you? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Of course not <span>Tom</span>. In <span>fact</span>, as a kind of <span>wedding</span> <span>present</span>, I <span>wondered</span> if you <span>wanted</span> a new <span>job</span>? I'm <span>offering</span> you a <span>chance</span> to <span>manage</span> my new <span>office</span> in <span>Paris</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Me?</span>! <span>Manager…</span> in <span>Paris</span>! Well Mr <span>S…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Tom…</span> aren't we about to get <span>married…</span> start a life together?<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>yes.</span>. <span>erm</span>, thanks Mr <span>S</span> for you kind <span>offer</span> but I will have to <span>decline</span>. I'm about to <span>spend</span> the <span>rest</span> of my life with this <span>wonderful</span> <span>woman</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Registrar<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Ladies</span> and <span>gentlemen</span>, please could you take your <span>seats</span>. The <span>marriage</span> <span>ceremony</span> is about to <span>begin</span>. Do you <span>Anna</span> <span>Jane</span> <span>Wijaya..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>…out</span> the way, give me that <span>paper</span>. Do you <span>Anna</span> <span>Jane</span> <span>Wijaya</span> take <span>Tom</span> <span>Brian</span> <span>Farquhar</span> <span>Darcy</span> <span>…</span> to be your <span>lawfully</span> <span>wedded</span> <span>husband</span>? To have and to <span>hold</span> from this day forward?<br/>
🎧 <span>Ermm</span>, <span>errr…<br/></span>
🎧 Come on <span>Anna</span>. This is the most <span>important</span> <span>phrase</span> in the whole <span>series</span>! It's <span>'I</span> <span>do'</span>! <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh yes, of <span>course…</span> I do.<br/>
🎧 And do you, <span>Tom</span> <span>Brian</span> <span>Farquhar</span> <span>Darcy…<br/></span>

🎧 Oh <span>Denise</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Ahh</span>. It looks like <span>Tom</span> has <span>signed</span> the best <span>contract</span> of his <span>career</span> but not without these <span>phrases:<br/></span>
🎧 Thank you for your kind <span>offer</span> but I will have to <span>decline<br/></span>
🎧 It's a <span>deal<br/></span>
🎧 I do!<br/>
🎧 Thanks to everyone for <span>making</span> this a special day. If it wasn't for Tip Top <span>Trading</span> I wouldn't be <span>starting</span> a new life as <span>Mrs</span> <span>Wijaya-Darcy</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Wijaya-Darcy</span>? Shouldn't it just be <span>Mrs</span> <span>Darcy</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm the <span>boss</span> now <span>Tom</span> at <span>work…</span> and at home!<br/>
🎧 <span>Congratulations</span> to <span>Anna</span> and <span>Tom</span>. We have a happy <span>ending</span> <span>–</span> let's hope <span>Anna's</span> <span>journey</span> has <span>inspired</span> you to learn English at work.<br/>
