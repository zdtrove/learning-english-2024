🎧 Hello again and welcome back to the final English at Work. Mr Socrates has sacked Paul from his position as manager of Tip Top Trading and he's offered Anna a promotion – to be the new boss. But will she accept? What's wrong Anna?<br/>
🎧 I feel bad about replacing Paul. He's been good to me.<br/>
🎧 It's business Anna. He's just not up to the job – but you are.<br/>
🎧 Thanks. But why me? Can I do the job? I'm not as experienced as Tom.<br/>
🎧 I think we have seen over the year that you definitely have more experience than Tom! Go on Anna, you can do it.<br/>
🎧 Hmmm.<br/>
🎧 So Anna... what do you say? Will you replace Paul as the new boss of Tip Top Trading? Come on Anna. This promotion recognises your achievements at the company. It's an opportunity of a lifetime.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 You'll be my right-hand man.<br/>
🎧 I think he means right-hand woman! It means you'd be his most trusted and invaluable assistant.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 Anna, if you need time to think you could say "thank you for your kind words" and, "could I have time to consider your offer?"<br/>
🎧 Erm, Mr Socrates. This news has come as a bit of a shock. Thank you for your kind words but please could I have some time to consider your offer?<br/>
🎧 Oh... OK Anna. But don't leave it too long. I have a habit of changing my mind.<br/>
🎧 OK, Mr Socrates... I mean Brad... I'll call you back soon. Bye.<br/>
🎧 Oh... has Mr S offered you Paul's job by any chance?<br/>
🎧 Yes!<br/>
🎧 And you said you'd think about it?<br/>
🎧 Yes. I'm not sure if I can take on that much responsibility.<br/>
🎧 It's easy peasy. I could do it standing on my head.<br/>
🎧 But he's not offering­ you the job Tom.<br/>
🎧 Please don't mention this to Paul... not yet... he's very upset.<br/>
🎧 I know nothing!<br/>
🎧 You know nothing? About what?<br/>
🎧 I mean, I'll remain tight lipped... I won't say a word... until it's all official like. You can count on me.<br/>
🎧 "You can count on me"!?<br/>
🎧 Uh?<br/>
🎧 "You can count on me". That was the message with that that bunch of flowers someone sent me. It was you wasn't it?!<br/>
🎧 Well... err... I suppose... yes... it was me Anna. I couldn't help it. I... I... love you Anna.<br/>
🎧 Do you know what Tom... I quite like you too... I think you're... sweet. Now come on and give me a kiss.<br/>
🎧 Oh crumbs, shall I come back later?!<br/>
🎧 No it's ok Paul. We're just... getting to know each other a bit better. In fact, Anna... I'd like to ask you something. <br/>
🎧 Oh, why is Tom getting down on one knee?<br/>
🎧 I expect he's dropped one of his contact lenses.<br/>
🎧 No it's not that. Anna, I'd like to ask you something... err... will you... will you marry me?<br/>
🎧 What?!<br/>
🎧 Crikey, what a dilemma. Now Anna's got two important questions to answer. Will she take the job as Tip Top Trading's newest and youngest manager? And will she marry Tom? Here's a reminder of what Mr Socrates had to say about her:<br/>
🎧 This promotion recognises your achievements at the company. <br/>
🎧 It's an opportunity of a lifetime.<br/>
🎧 You would be my right-hand man.<br/>
🎧 And if Anna accepts the job, here's what she could say:<br/>
🎧 I'd be delighted to accept. Thank you.<br/>
🎧 When would I start?<br/>
🎧 Could we discuss the terms and conditions of the new job?<br/>
🎧 Let's find out what Anna has to say.<br/>
🎧 Oh Tom, I don't know what to say. It's come as a bit of a shock. Can I have some time to think about it?<br/>
🎧 I suppose.<br/>
🎧 Well, while you think about that, I've got some good news. I've been offered a new job.<br/>
🎧 That's fantastic news Paul. What is it?<br/>
🎧 It's to be Head Taster at a company called Better Biscuits.<br/>
🎧 That's fantastic news Paul.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, well done Paul. That's right up your street.<br/>
🎧 So Anna, does that mean you'll do Paul's job now?<br/>
🎧 Don't answer that. Answer my proposal first.<br/>
🎧 No, I think she should sort out her work first.<br/>
🎧 But I've been waiting to ask her for months.<br/>
🎧 I think it's up to Anna to say what she wants.<br/>
🎧 Quiet! Look everyone, I can't decide what to say to you Tom, or Mr Socrates. So I've decided I'm going to take a short holiday to have some time to think.<br/>
🎧 Good idea. Where shall we go?<br/>
🎧 On my own Tom. When I return I will give you my answers.<br/>
🎧 Crumbs. I think I'd better get a biscuit.<br/>
🎧 A good idea Anna. But we're going to have to wait a while to find out what she decides. She needs a rest after learning so much during her year at Tip Top Trading. We hope you've enjoyed learning with her and now feel more confident in using English at work! That's all from me and the team at Tip Top Trading for now. Until we meet again, bye!<br/>

🎧 Hello again and welcome back to English at Work – the drama about life at the plastic fruit production company called Tip Top Trading. You may remember Anna, the company's newest and brightest sales executive, was offered a promotion and a marriage proposal at the same time. She's taken time out to think about her reply but everyone in the office really misses her.<br/>
🎧 I dunno Denise, I'd be good for Anna, I think we would be been a perfect pair. Mr and Mrs Darcy... it sounds good<br/>...
🎧 I'm back!<br/>
🎧 Anna! I…we weren't expecting you.<br/>
🎧 Yes I can see – perhaps you could tidy up your desk Tom.<br/>
🎧 Very funny Anna – still trying to be the boss! So did you have a good trip? Did you get some 'head space'?<br/>
🎧 Eh?<br/>
🎧 He means time alone to think about the things you want to think about. Tell him you've been chewing things over – it means you've been thinking about your proposals and say I have come to a final decision.<br/>
🎧 OK, well it's true; I have done a lot of thinking. Tom, I did have some head space and a chance to... chew things over<br/>...
🎧 Yes! Yes! And?<br/>
🎧 And I've come to a final decision. The answer is 'yes'. I accept. There's no doubt really... I should give it a go... I need the experience... and besides, what's the worst thing that can happen?<br/>
🎧 Oh Anna. I'm so happy. You won't regret your decision.<br/>
🎧 Hmm – is Anna really saying 'yes' to Tom's marriage proposal or has there been a misunderstanding?<br/>
🎧 Here are some of the phrases we've heard today:<br/>
🎧 I've had a chance to chew things over<br/>
🎧 I've come to a final decision<br/>
🎧 I'll give it a go<br/>
🎧 You won't regret your decision <br/>
🎧 Find out if we can look forward to Anna and Tom's wedding in the next episode of English at Work. Bye!<br/>

🎧 Welcome back to the offices of Tip Top Trading where there's a bit of confusion. Anna<br/>...
🎧 Yes?<br/>
🎧 I think Tom's got the wrong end of the stick.<br/>
🎧 But I didn't give him a stick.<br/>
🎧 No, no. I think there's been a misunderstanding. When you said your answer was 'yes' he thought you meant 'yes, I'll marry you'!<br/>
🎧 Oh no! I meant yes to the promotion. Gosh I've got to sort this out. Tom, Tom, hold on please.<br/>
🎧 We can't hang about Anna. Let's fix a date, invite everyone – even Paul.<br/>
🎧 No, no, we can't.<br/>
🎧 You're right, not Paul – he just talks about biscuits.<br/>
🎧 No. I mean 'no', we can't get married. I meant yes to the promotion. I can't marry you.<br/>
🎧 What? So when you said 'yes' you meant 'no'?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 I see. Right, that's it. Anna, I've made it very clear what I think about you and you... you... just throw it back in my face. I've had enough... enough of you... enough of this company. I quit!<br/>
🎧 Anna. I think he's upset. He's having a tantrum.<br/>
🎧 A tantrum – is that serious?<br/>
🎧 Not really. Maybe you need to calm him down and make him change his mind. Tell him 'not to be too hasty', 'don't rush into a decision' and say 'we can work this out' – you can can't you?<br/>
🎧 I think I can. Tom, please, don't be too hasty. Let's talk about this. We can work something out, just don't rush into making a decision – please. You're my best – my only – sales executive.<br/>
🎧 Sorry Anna – I'm a free spirit. I must go where the wind takes me. You've had your chance, now it's mine. I'm off.<br/>
🎧 Wow, I've never seen Tom be such a... man. Will this be the last time we ever see him?<br/>
🎧 Here are some of the phrases Anna used to try and get Tom not to leave:<br/>
🎧 Don't be too hasty<br/>
🎧 Don't rush into making a decision<br/>
🎧 We can work this out<br/>
🎧 …erm, sorry, I just forgot to take my special mug. Bye.<br/>

🎧 Hello again. At the offices of Tip Top Trading things are a bit strange after Tom walked... stormed out in a huff after realising that Anna was never going to marry him. So Anna, I suppose you can get on with being the manager now?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I suppose so. But something's not right.<br/>
🎧 Well, you've lost a valuable member of your team.<br/>
🎧 I know, and a good friend too.<br/>
🎧 Well, you're the boss now – it's time to deal with the situation and get down to business. Tell the team you'll be finding a replacement for Tom and you're going to make some changes in the office. You could also say you want to turn the business round and make it really successful.<br/>
🎧 OK, thanks. Excuse me everyone, could we gather round for a quick meeting please. <br/>
🎧 Anna?<br/>
🎧 Oh, it's just you now Denise. Right, well, I need to get down to business so I'll be advertising for a replacement for Tom today – in fact Denise, you might be interested in that? And I want to make some changes in the office. I need to turn this business round and ... make it the world's leading plastic fruit production company and... I'm... keen to hear... your ideas.<br/>
🎧 Is everything alright?<br/>
🎧 Err... I can't stop thinking about Tom. He seemed so upset when he left and... it's not the same without him around. He made me laugh and... I miss his floppy hair.<br/>
🎧 Anna, it's time to swallow your pride!<br/>
🎧 Swallow what?<br/>
🎧 Admit you are wrong – be honest with yourself and follow your heart – go and marry Tom! Although personally, I don't know what you see in him. <br/>
🎧 You're right! Why didn't I see it? Tom is the man for me – I must call him and find out where he is ... oh no, his phone's switched off. Where can I find him? <br/>
🎧 Hey Anna. You looking for Tom?<br/>
🎧 Yes Mr Ingle, I am.<br/>
🎧 I saw him a while ago, in a real rage, getting into a taxi. He told me he'd booked a flight to Australia and was heading for the airport. He said something about being a 'free spirit'.<br/>
🎧 Struth! Tom really is going too far – to the other end of the world in fact. Does this mean we'll never hear from Tom again? For now, let's remind ourselves of some of the phrases Anna used to deal with a difficult situation:<br/>
🎧 I'll be advertising for a replacement for Tom today<br/>
🎧 I want to make some changes in the office<br/>
🎧 I need to turn this business round<br/>
🎧 I'm keen to hear your ideas<br/>
🎧 …but work can wait. I've got to get to the airport quickly before Tom gets on that flight. Taxi! Taxi!<br/>
🎧 This is going to be interesting!<br/>

🎧 Hello and welcome to English at Work where things have got rather dramatic. Anna is on her way to the airport to try and catch Tom before he boards his flight to Australia and his new life on the other side of the world. But will she get there in time?<br/>
🎧 Thanks. Excuse me, do you know where the check in desks for flights to Sydney are?<br/>
🎧 Man<br/>
🎧 Yeah, over there luv – desk number 47.<br/>
🎧 OK, thanks.<br/>
🎧 ... yeah, I always fly business class, it's the kind of guy I am... shame you're not available to fly with me but you know<br/>...
🎧 Tom, Tom!<br/>
🎧 Anna? How... what... what are you doing here?<br/>
🎧 Don't go... we need you... I need you.<br/>
🎧 But I don't understand... you rejected me.<br/>
🎧 Yes but... but<br/>...
🎧 But what Anna? What are you going to say? How can you tell him you were wrong and you've changed your mind?<br/>
🎧 Hmm, I don't know.<br/>
🎧 Passenger 1<br/>
🎧 Tell him 'I've been doing a lot of thinking'.<br/>
🎧 Passenger 2<br/>
🎧 Say, 'I didn't realise how much I missed you until you had gone'.<br/>
🎧 Passenger 3<br/>
🎧 And tell him, 'I've changed my mind, I will marry you!'<br/>
🎧 Yeah, yeah, I heard all that and that other man who you're always talking to.<br/>
🎧 Oh right!<br/>
🎧 I see. Well Tom, will you marry me?<br/>
🎧 Why should I after all you've put me through?<br/>
🎧 Yeah why should he? <br/>
🎧 Because Tom... you're a funny guy and... I love you and... I can't live without you.<br/>
🎧 Passengers<br/>
🎧 Ahhh! <br/>
🎧 Let me think about this ... oh if you put it like that then yes, I will marry you!<br/>
🎧 Oh Tom!<br/>
🎧 Hooray. At last! We got there in the end but not without using these phrases:<br/>
🎧 I've been doing a lot of thinking.<br/>
🎧 I didn't realise how much I missed you until you had gone.<br/>
🎧 I've changed my mind, I will marry you!<br/>
🎧 And<br/>...
🎧 I love you and I can't live without you!<br/>
🎧 I won't be needing these anymore.<br/>
🎧 Join us very soon for the English at Work wedding of the year. Bye!<br/>

🎧 Hello and welcome to English at Work where the day has finally come – it's Anna and Tom's wedding. All their friends, work colleagues and business acquaintances are there... such as Mr Lime<br/>...
🎧 Fantastic Anna, fantastic!<br/>
🎧 Yuk, Slimey Limey, I never liked him. Sorry about the venue Anna – but it's all we could get at short notice.<br/>
🎧 I think the office at Tip Top Trading is an ideal place for a wedding and besides the<br/>...
🎧 Anna! My favourite girl. I got here as fast I could. I thought I was the only man for you but I guess Tom has stolen that title! Your choice Anna, your choice!<br/>
🎧 Oh hello Mr Socrates, this is a nice surprise. Come over here and say hello to Tom.<br/>
🎧 Hey Tom.<br/>
🎧 Oh hello Mr S. Nice to see you. You're not doing any firing today are you? <br/>
🎧 Of course not Tom. In fact, as a kind of wedding present, I wondered if you wanted a new job? I'm offering you a chance to manage my new office in Paris.<br/>
🎧 Me?! Manager... in Paris! Well Mr S<br/>...
🎧 Tom... aren't we about to get married... start a life together?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes.. erm, thanks Mr S for you kind offer but I will have to decline. I'm about to spend the rest of my life with this wonderful woman.<br/>
🎧 Registrar<br/>
🎧 Ladies and gentlemen, please could you take your seats. The marriage ceremony is about to begin. Do you Anna Jane Wijaya...<br/>
🎧 …out the way, give me that paper. Do you Anna Jane Wijaya take Tom Brian Farquhar Darcy ... to be your lawfully wedded husband? To have and to hold from this day forward?<br/>
🎧 Ermm, errr<br/>...
🎧 Come on Anna. This is the most important phrase in the whole series! It's 'I do'! <br/>
🎧 Oh yes, of course... I do.<br/>
🎧 And do you, Tom Brian Farquhar Darcy<br/>...
🎧 …it's a deal... I do. Come on Anna, give us a kiss.<br/>
🎧 Oh Denise!<br/>
🎧 Ahh. It looks like Tom has signed the best contract of his career but not without these phrases:<br/>
🎧 Thank you for your kind offer but I will have to decline<br/>
🎧 It's a deal<br/>
🎧 I do!<br/>
🎧 Thanks to everyone for making this a special day. If it wasn't for Tip Top Trading I wouldn't be starting a new life as Mrs Wijaya-Darcy.<br/>
🎧 Wijaya-Darcy? Shouldn't it just be Mrs Darcy?<br/>
🎧 I'm the boss now Tom at work... and at home!<br/>
🎧 Congratulations to Anna and Tom. We have a happy ending – let's hope Anna's journey has inspired you to learn English at work.<br/>
🎧 Everyone<br/>
🎧 Bye! <br/>
