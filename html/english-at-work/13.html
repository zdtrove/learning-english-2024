🎧 Hello again and <span>welcome</span> back to the <span>final</span> English at Work. Mr <span>Socrates</span> has <span>sacked</span> Paul from his <span>position</span> as <span>manager</span> of Tip Top <span>Trading</span> and he's <span>offered</span> Anna a <span>promotion</span> <span>–</span> to be the new <span>boss</span>. But will she <span>accept</span>? What's wrong Anna?<br/>
🎧 I feel bad about <span>replacing</span> Paul. He's been good to me.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>business</span> Anna. He's just not up to the <span>job</span> <span>–</span> but you are.<br/>
🎧 Thanks. But why me? Can I do the <span>job</span>? I'm not as <span>experienced</span> as Tom.<br/>
🎧 I think we have <span>seen</span> over the year that you definitely have more <span>experience</span> than Tom! Go on Anna, you can do it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmmm</span>.<br/>
🎧 So <span>Anna</span>... what do you say? Will you <span>replace</span> Paul as the new <span>boss</span> of Tip Top <span>Trading</span>? Come on Anna. This <span>promotion</span> <span>recognises</span> your <span>achievements</span> at the company. It's an <span>opportunity</span> of a <span>lifetime</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 You'll be my <span>right-hand</span> man.<br/>
🎧 I think he <span>means</span> <span>right-hand</span> <span>woman</span>! It <span>means</span> you'd be his most <span>trusted</span> and <span>invaluable</span> <span>assistant</span>.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 Anna, if you need time to think you could say <span>"thank</span> you for your kind <span>words"</span> and, <span>"could</span> I have time to <span>consider</span> your <span>offer?"<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Erm</span>, Mr <span>Socrates</span>. This <span>news</span> has come as a bit of a <span>shock</span>. Thank you for your kind <span>words</span> but please could I have some time to <span>consider</span> your <span>offer</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh</span>... OK Anna. But don't leave it too long. I have a <span>habit</span> of <span>changing</span> my <span>mind</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, Mr <span>Socrates</span>... I mean <span>Brad</span>... I'll call you back soon. Bye.<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh</span>... has Mr <span>S</span> <span>offered</span> you <span>Paul's</span> <span>job</span> by any <span>chance</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes!<br/>
🎧 And you said you'd think about it?<br/>
🎧 Yes. I'm not sure if I can take on that much <span>responsibility</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's easy <span>peasy</span>. I could do it <span>standing</span> on my <span>head</span>.<br/>
🎧 But he's not <span>offering­</span> you the <span>job</span> Tom.<br/>
🎧 Please don't <span>mention</span> this to <span>Paul</span>... not <span>yet</span>... he's very <span>upset</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know <span>nothing</span>!<br/>
🎧 You know <span>nothing</span>? About what?<br/>
🎧 I mean, I'll <span>remain</span> <span>tight</span> <span>lipped</span>... I won't say a <span>word</span>... until it's all <span>official</span> like. You can <span>count</span> on me.<br/>
🎧 <span>"You</span> can <span>count</span> on <span>me"!</span>?<br/>
🎧 Uh?<br/>
🎧 <span>"You</span> can <span>count</span> on <span>me"</span>. That was the <span>message</span> with that that <span>bunch</span> of <span>flowers</span> <span>someone</span> <span>sent</span> me. It was you wasn't <span>it</span>?!<br/>
🎧 <span>Well</span>... <span>err</span>... I <span>suppose</span>... <span>yes</span>... it was me Anna. I couldn't help it. <span>I</span>... <span>I</span>... love you Anna.<br/>
🎧 Do you know what <span>Tom</span>... I quite like you too... I think you're... <span>sweet</span>. Now come on and give me a <span>kiss</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>crumbs</span>, shall I come back <span>later</span>?!<br/>
🎧 No it's ok Paul. <span>We're</span> <span>just</span>... getting to know each other a bit better. In <span>fact</span>, <span>Anna</span>... I'd like to ask you something. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh, why is Tom getting down on one <span>knee</span>?<br/>
🎧 I <span>expect</span> he's <span>dropped</span> one of his <span>contact</span> <span>lenses</span>.<br/>
🎧 No it's not that. Anna, I'd like to ask you <span>something</span>... <span>err</span>... will <span>you</span>... will you <span>marry</span> me?<br/>
🎧 <span>What</span>?!<br/>
🎧 <span>Crikey</span>, what a <span>dilemma</span>. Now <span>Anna's</span> got two important <span>questions</span> to answer. Will she take the <span>job</span> as Tip Top <span>Trading's</span> <span>newest</span> and <span>youngest</span> <span>manager</span>? And will she <span>marry</span> Tom? Here's a <span>reminder</span> of what Mr <span>Socrates</span> had to say about <span>her:<br/></span>
🎧 This <span>promotion</span> <span>recognises</span> your <span>achievements</span> at the company. <span><br/></span>
🎧 It's an <span>opportunity</span> of a <span>lifetime</span>.<br/>
🎧 You would be my <span>right-hand</span> man.<br/>
🎧 And if Anna <span>accepts</span> the <span>job</span>, here's what she could <span>say:<br/></span>
🎧 I'd be <span>delighted</span> to <span>accept</span>. Thank you.<br/>
🎧 When would I start?<br/>
🎧 Could we <span>discuss</span> the <span>terms</span> and <span>conditions</span> of the new <span>job</span>?<br/>
🎧 Let's find out what Anna has to say.<br/>
🎧 Oh Tom, I don't know what to say. It's come as a bit of a <span>shock</span>. Can I have some time to think about it?<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, while you think about that, I've got some good <span>news</span>. I've been <span>offered</span> a new <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>fantastic</span> <span>news</span> Paul. What is it?<br/>
🎧 It's to be <span>Head</span> <span>Taster</span> at a company called Better <span>Biscuits</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>fantastic</span> <span>news</span> Paul.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, well done Paul. That's right up your <span>street</span>.<br/>
🎧 So Anna, does that mean you'll do <span>Paul's</span> <span>job</span> now?<br/>
🎧 Don't answer that. <span>Answer</span> my <span>proposal</span> first.<br/>
🎧 No, I think she should <span>sort</span> out her work first.<br/>
🎧 But I've been <span>waiting</span> to ask her for <span>months</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think it's up to Anna to say what she <span>wants</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Quiet</span>! Look everyone, I can't decide what to say to you Tom, or Mr <span>Socrates</span>. So I've <span>decided</span> I'm going to take a short <span>holiday</span> to have some time to think.<br/>
🎧 Good idea. Where shall we go?<br/>
🎧 On my own Tom. When I <span>return</span> I will give you my <span>answers</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Crumbs</span>. I think I'd better get a <span>biscuit</span>.<br/>
🎧 A good idea Anna. But we're going to have to wait a while to find out what she <span>decides</span>. She needs a <span>rest</span> after <span>learning</span> so much during her year at Tip Top <span>Trading</span>. We hope you've <span>enjoyed</span> <span>learning</span> with her and now feel more <span>confident</span> in <span>using</span> English at work! <span>That's</span> all from me and the <span>team</span> at Tip Top <span>Trading</span> for now. Until we meet again, bye!<br/>

🎧 Hello again and <span>welcome</span> back to English at Work <span>–</span> the <span>drama</span> about life at the <span>plastic</span> <span>fruit</span> <span>production</span> company called Tip Top <span>Trading</span>. You may remember Anna, the <span>company's</span> <span>newest</span> and <span>brightest</span> <span>sales</span> <span>executive</span>, was <span>offered</span> a <span>promotion</span> and a <span>marriage</span> <span>proposal</span> at the same time. She's taken time out to think about her <span>reply</span> but everyone in the <span>office</span> really <span>misses</span> her.<br/>
🎧 I <span>dunno</span> Denise, I'd be good for Anna, I think we would be been a perfect <span>pair</span>. Mr and Mrs <span>Darcy</span>... it sounds <span>good<br/></span>...
🎧 I'm back!<br/>
🎧 Anna! <span>I…we</span> weren't <span>expecting</span> you.<br/>
🎧 Yes I can see <span>–</span> <span>perhaps</span> you could <span>tidy</span> up your <span>desk</span> Tom.<br/>
🎧 Very funny Anna <span>–</span> still trying to be the <span>boss</span>! So did you have a good <span>trip</span>? Did you get some <span>'head</span> <span>space'</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Eh</span>?<br/>
🎧 He <span>means</span> time <span>alone</span> to think about the things you want to think about. Tell him you've been <span>chewing</span> things over <span>–</span> it <span>means</span> you've been thinking about your <span>proposals</span> and say I have come to a <span>final</span> <span>decision</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, well it's <span>true;</span> I have done a lot of thinking. Tom, I did have some <span>head</span> <span>space</span> and a <span>chance</span> to... <span>chew</span> things <span>over<br/></span>...
🎧 Yes! Yes! And?<br/>
🎧 And I've come to a <span>final</span> <span>decision</span>. The answer is <span>'yes'</span>. I <span>accept</span>. There's no <span>doubt</span> <span>really</span>... I should give it a <span>go</span>... I need the <span>experience</span>... and <span>besides</span>, what's the <span>worst</span> thing that can <span>happen</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh Anna. I'm so happy. You won't <span>regret</span> your <span>decision</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span> <span>–</span> is Anna really saying <span>'yes'</span> to <span>Tom's</span> <span>marriage</span> <span>proposal</span> or has there been a <span>misunderstanding</span>?<br/>
🎧 Here are some of the <span>phrases</span> we've heard <span>today:<br/></span>
🎧 I've had a <span>chance</span> to <span>chew</span> things <span>over<br/></span>
🎧 I've come to a <span>final</span> <span>decision<br/></span>
🎧 I'll give it a <span>go<br/></span>
🎧 You won't <span>regret</span> your <span>decision</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 Find out if we can look forward to Anna and <span>Tom's</span> <span>wedding</span> in the next <span>episode</span> of English at Work. Bye!<br/>

🎧 <span>Welcome</span> back to the <span>offices</span> of Tip Top <span>Trading</span> where there's a bit of <span>confusion</span>. <span>Anna<br/></span>...
🎧 Yes?<br/>
🎧 I think <span>Tom's</span> got the wrong end of the <span>stick</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I didn't give him a <span>stick</span>.<br/>
🎧 No, no. I think there's been a <span>misunderstanding</span>. When you said your answer was <span>'yes'</span> he thought you <span>meant</span> <span>'yes</span>, I'll <span>marry</span> <span>you'</span>!<br/>
🎧 Oh no! I <span>meant</span> yes to the <span>promotion</span>. <span>Gosh</span> I've got to <span>sort</span> this out. Tom, Tom, <span>hold</span> on please.<br/>
🎧 We can't <span>hang</span> about Anna. Let's fix a date, <span>invite</span> everyone <span>–</span> even Paul.<br/>
🎧 No, no, we can't.<br/>
🎧 You're right, not Paul <span>–</span> he just <span>talks</span> about <span>biscuits</span>.<br/>
🎧 No. I mean <span>'no'</span>, we can't get <span>married</span>. I <span>meant</span> yes to the <span>promotion</span>. I can't <span>marry</span> you.<br/>
🎧 What? So when you said <span>'yes'</span> you <span>meant</span> <span>'no'</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 I see. Right, that's it. Anna, I've made it very <span>clear</span> what I think about you and <span>you</span>... <span>you</span>... just <span>throw</span> it back in my <span>face</span>. I've had <span>enough</span>... enough of <span>you</span>... enough of this company. I <span>quit</span>!<br/>
🎧 Anna. I think he's <span>upset</span>. He's having a <span>tantrum</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>tantrum</span> <span>–</span> is that serious?<br/>
🎧 Not really. Maybe you need to <span>calm</span> him down and make him change his <span>mind</span>. Tell him <span>'not</span> to be too <span>hasty'</span>, <span>'don't</span> <span>rush</span> into a <span>decision'</span> and say <span>'we</span> can work this <span>out'</span> <span>–</span> you can can't you?<br/>
🎧 I think I can. Tom, please, don't be too <span>hasty</span>. Let's talk about this. We can work something out, just don't <span>rush</span> into <span>making</span> a <span>decision</span> <span>–</span> please. You're my best <span>–</span> my only <span>–</span> <span>sales</span> <span>executive</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sorry Anna <span>–</span> I'm a free <span>spirit</span>. I must go where the <span>wind</span> takes me. You've had your <span>chance</span>, now it's <span>mine</span>. I'm off.<br/>
🎧 Wow, I've never <span>seen</span> Tom be such <span>a</span>... man. Will this be the last time we ever see him?<br/>
🎧 Here are some of the <span>phrases</span> Anna used to try and get Tom not to <span>leave:<br/></span>
🎧 Don't be too <span>hasty<br/></span>
🎧 Don't <span>rush</span> into <span>making</span> a <span>decision<br/></span>
🎧 We can work this <span>out<br/></span>

🎧 Hello again. At the <span>offices</span> of Tip Top <span>Trading</span> things are a bit <span>strange</span> after Tom <span>walked</span>... <span>stormed</span> out in a <span>huff</span> after <span>realising</span> that Anna was never going to <span>marry</span> him. So Anna, I <span>suppose</span> you can get on with being the <span>manager</span> now?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I <span>suppose</span> so. But <span>something's</span> not right.<br/>
🎧 Well, you've <span>lost</span> a <span>valuable</span> <span>member</span> of your <span>team</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know, and a good friend too.<br/>
🎧 Well, you're the <span>boss</span> now <span>–</span> it's time to <span>deal</span> with the <span>situation</span> and get down to <span>business</span>. Tell the <span>team</span> you'll be <span>finding</span> a <span>replacement</span> for Tom and you're going to make some changes in the <span>office</span>. You could also say you want to <span>turn</span> the <span>business</span> <span>round</span> and make it really <span>successful</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, thanks. <span>Excuse</span> me everyone, could we <span>gather</span> <span>round</span> for a <span>quick</span> <span>meeting</span> please. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Anna?<br/>
🎧 Oh, it's just you now Denise. Right, well, I need to get down to <span>business</span> so I'll be <span>advertising</span> for a <span>replacement</span> for Tom today <span>–</span> in <span>fact</span> Denise, you might be interested in that? And I want to make some changes in the <span>office</span>. I need to <span>turn</span> this <span>business</span> <span>round</span> and <span></span>... make it the <span>world's</span> <span>leading</span> <span>plastic</span> <span>fruit</span> <span>production</span> company <span>and</span>... I'm... <span>keen</span> to <span>hear</span>... your <span>ideas</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is everything alright?<br/>
🎧 <span>Err</span>... I can't <span>stop</span> thinking about Tom. He <span>seemed</span> so <span>upset</span> when he <span>left</span> <span>and</span>... it's not the same without him around. He made me <span>laugh</span> <span>and</span>... I <span>miss</span> his <span>floppy</span> <span>hair</span>.<br/>
🎧 Anna, it's time to <span>swallow</span> your <span>pride</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Swallow</span> what?<br/>
🎧 <span>Admit</span> you are wrong <span>–</span> be <span>honest</span> with yourself and <span>follow</span> your <span>heart</span> <span>–</span> go and <span>marry</span> Tom! Although <span>personally</span>, I don't know what you see in him. <span><br/></span>
🎧 You're right! Why didn't I see it? Tom is the man for me <span>–</span> I must call him and find out where he is <span></span>... oh no, his <span>phone's</span> <span>switched</span> off. Where can I find him? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Hey Anna. You looking for Tom?<br/>
🎧 Yes Mr <span>Ingle</span>, I am.<br/>
🎧 I saw him a while ago, in a <span>real</span> <span>rage</span>, getting into a <span>taxi</span>. He told me he'd <span>booked</span> a <span>flight</span> to <span>Australia</span> and was <span>heading</span> for the <span>airport</span>. He said something about being a <span>'free</span> <span>spirit'</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Struth</span>! Tom really is going too <span>far</span> <span>–</span> to the other end of the <span>world</span> in <span>fact</span>. Does this mean we'll never hear from Tom again? For now, let's <span>remind</span> <span>ourselves</span> of some of the <span>phrases</span> Anna used to <span>deal</span> with a <span>difficult</span> <span>situation:<br/></span>
🎧 I'll be <span>advertising</span> for a <span>replacement</span> for Tom <span>today<br/></span>
🎧 I want to make some changes in the <span>office<br/></span>
🎧 I need to <span>turn</span> this <span>business</span> <span>round<br/></span>
🎧 I'm <span>keen</span> to hear your <span>ideas<br/></span>
🎧 <span>…but</span> work can wait. I've got to get to the <span>airport</span> quickly before Tom <span>gets</span> on that <span>flight</span>. <span>Taxi</span>! <span>Taxi</span>!<br/>
🎧 This is going to be <span>interesting</span>!<br/>

🎧 Hello and <span>welcome</span> to English at Work where things have got rather <span>dramatic</span>. Anna is on her way to the <span>airport</span> to try and catch Tom before he <span>boards</span> his <span>flight</span> to <span>Australia</span> and his new life on the other side of the <span>world</span>.

🎧 Thanks. <span>Excuse</span> me, do you know where the check in <span>desks</span> for <span>flights</span> to <span>Sydney</span> are?<br/>

🎧 Don't <span>go</span>... we need <span>you</span>... I need you.<br/>
🎧 But I don't <span>understand</span>... you <span>rejected</span> me.<br/>
🎧 Yes <span>but</span>... <span>but<br/></span>...
🎧 But what Anna? What are you going to say? How can you tell him you were wrong and you've <span>changed</span> your <span>mind</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, I don't know.<br/>
🎧 <span>Passenger</span> <span>1<br/></span>
🎧 Tell him <span>'I've</span> been doing a lot of <span>thinking'</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Passenger</span> <span>2<br/></span>

🎧 I see. Well Tom, will you <span>marry</span> me?<br/>
🎧 Why should I after all you've put me through?<br/>
🎧 Yeah why should he? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Because <span>Tom</span>... you're a funny guy <span>and</span>... I love you <span>and</span>... I can't live without you.<br/>
🎧 <span>Passengers<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Ahhh</span>! <span><br/></span>
🎧 Let me think about this <span></span>... oh if you put it like that then yes, I will <span>marry</span> you!<br/>
🎧 Oh Tom!<br/>
🎧 <span>Hooray</span>. At last! We got there in the end but not without <span>using</span> these <span>phrases:<br/></span>
🎧 I've been doing a lot of thinking.<br/>
🎧 I didn't <span>realise</span> how much I <span>missed</span> you until you had <span>gone</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've <span>changed</span> my <span>mind</span>, I will <span>marry</span> you!<br/>
🎧 <span>And<br/></span>...
🎧 I love you and I can't live without you!<br/>
🎧 I won't be <span>needing</span> these <span>anymore</span>.<br/>
🎧 Join us very soon for the English at Work <span>wedding</span> of the year. Bye!<br/>

🎧 Hello and <span>welcome</span> to English at Work where the day has finally come <span>–</span> it's Anna and <span>Tom's</span> <span>wedding</span>. All their friends, work <span>colleagues</span> and <span>business</span> <span>acquaintances</span> are <span>there</span>... such as Mr <span>Lime<br/></span>...
🎧 <span>Fantastic</span> Anna, <span>fantastic</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Yuk</span>, <span>Slimey</span> <span>Limey</span>, I never <span>liked</span> him. Sorry about the <span>venue</span> Anna <span>–</span> but it's all we could get at short <span>notice</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think the <span>office</span> at Tip Top <span>Trading</span> is an <span>ideal</span> place for a <span>wedding</span> and <span>besides</span> <span>the<br/></span>...
🎧 Anna! My <span>favourite</span> girl. I got here as <span>fast</span> I could. I thought I was the only man for you but I <span>guess</span> Tom has <span>stolen</span> that <span>title</span>! Your <span>choice</span> Anna, your <span>choice</span>!<br/>
🎧 Oh hello Mr <span>Socrates</span>, this is a nice <span>surprise</span>. Come over here and say hello to Tom.<br/>
🎧 Hey Tom.<br/>
🎧 Oh hello Mr <span>S</span>. Nice to see you. You're not doing any <span>firing</span> today are you? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Of course not Tom. In <span>fact</span>, as a kind of <span>wedding</span> <span>present</span>, I <span>wondered</span> if you wanted a new <span>job</span>? I'm <span>offering</span> you a <span>chance</span> to <span>manage</span> my new <span>office</span> in <span>Paris</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Me</span>?! <span>Manager</span>... in <span>Paris</span>! Well Mr <span>S<br/></span>...
🎧 <span>Tom</span>... aren't we about to get <span>married</span>... start a life together?<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>yes.</span>. <span>erm</span>, thanks Mr <span>S</span> for you kind <span>offer</span> but I will have to <span>decline</span>. I'm about to <span>spend</span> the <span>rest</span> of my life with this wonderful <span>woman</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Registrar<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Ladies</span> and <span>gentlemen</span>, please could you take your <span>seats</span>. The <span>marriage</span> <span>ceremony</span> is about to <span>begin</span>. Do you Anna Jane <span>Wijaya</span>...<br/>
🎧 <span>…out</span> the way, give me that <span>paper</span>. Do you Anna Jane <span>Wijaya</span> take Tom <span>Brian</span> <span>Farquhar</span> <span>Darcy</span> <span></span>... to be your <span>lawfully</span> <span>wedded</span> <span>husband</span>? To have and to <span>hold</span> from this day forward?<br/>
🎧 <span>Ermm</span>, <span>errr<br/></span>...
🎧 Come on Anna. This is the most important <span>phrase</span> in the whole <span>series</span>! It's <span>'I</span> <span>do'</span>! <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh yes, of <span>course</span>... I do.<br/>
🎧 And do you, Tom <span>Brian</span> <span>Farquhar</span> <span>Darcy<br/></span>...
🎧 <span>…it's</span> a <span>deal</span>... I do. Come on Anna, give us a <span>kiss</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh Denise!<br/>
🎧 <span>Ahh</span>. It looks like Tom has <span>signed</span> the best <span>contract</span> of his <span>career</span> but not without these <span>phrases:<br/></span>
🎧 Thank you for your kind <span>offer</span> but I will have to <span>decline<br/></span>
🎧 It's a <span>deal<br/></span>
🎧 I do!<br/>
🎧 Thanks to everyone for <span>making</span> this a special day. If it wasn't for Tip Top <span>Trading</span> I wouldn't be <span>starting</span> a new life as Mrs <span>Wijaya-Darcy</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Wijaya-Darcy</span>? Shouldn't it just be Mrs <span>Darcy</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm the <span>boss</span> now Tom at <span>work</span>... and at home!<br/>
🎧 <span>Congratulations</span> to Anna and Tom. We have a happy <span>ending</span> <span>–</span> let's hope <span>Anna's</span> <span>journey</span> has <span>inspired</span> you to learn English at work.<br/>
🎧 <span>Everyone<br/></span>
🎧 Bye! <span><br/>
</span><br/><br/>
