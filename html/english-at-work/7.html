🎧 Help, help!<br/>
🎧 Help us! We're <span>locked</span> in. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh <span>dear</span>. Do you <span>remember</span> that <span>Tom</span> and <span>Anna</span> are <span>locked</span> in the <span>stationery</span> <span>cupboard</span>? What are they going to do? And what will people say when they are <span>discovered</span> in there? I have a feeling we're about to find <span>out…</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Goodness</span>, what's that? <span>Anna</span> is that you? And is that you <span>Tom</span>? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Yes, help! We're <span>locked</span> in. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Don't <span>panic</span>, I've got the key. There. How on <span>earth…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>…it's</span> not how it looks <span>Denise</span>. We were <span>just…</span> <span>erm…</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>…just</span> <span>looking</span> for <span>envelopes</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Really?</span>! <span><br/></span>
🎧 Yes, yes, really. The <span>door</span> <span>slammed</span> <span>shut</span> and <span>locked</span> from the inside when <span>Tom</span> <span>walked</span> in.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, she's right. Just <span>walked</span> in, and <span>shut</span> the <span>door</span> and <span>bang</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>. Let's just keep it our little <span>secret</span> <span>shall</span> we. <span>(Aside</span> to <span>Anna)</span> I thought you had better <span>taste</span> <span>Anna</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Ah</span> there you are <span>Anna</span>, I need a <span>word</span> with <span>you…</span> Oh, you look like you've been <span>caught</span> doing something you shouldn't! <span>Ha</span> <span>ha</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>…but</span> I haven't.<br/>
🎧 Just <span>joking</span> <span>Anna</span>. Now could you <span>step</span> in to my <span>office</span>, we need to touch <span>base</span> about the <span>European</span> <span>marketing</span> <span>strategy</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Are we playing <span>baseball?</span>! <span><br/></span>
🎧 No <span>Anna</span>! Touch <span>base</span>. He <span>wants</span> to catch up with you, probably to see how you're getting on. Go on <span>Anna</span>, let's see what he has to say. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh I see. That <span>door</span> doesn't <span>lock</span> does it?<br/>
🎧 No, I don't think so. Right <span>Anna</span>. <span>Biscuit</span>? These new <span>peanut</span> <span>ones</span> are quite nice. So how are things with the <span>project</span>? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Well, I've done some <span>cold</span> <span>calling</span> and have an <span>order</span> from a <span>company</span> in <span>France</span>.<br/>
🎧 I see. Very <span>impressive</span> but have they <span>signed</span> on the <span>dotted</span> <span>line</span> yet? <span><br/></span>
🎧 The <span>dotted</span> <span>line</span>?<br/>
🎧 Have they <span>actually</span> <span>signed</span> the <span>contract</span> yet? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Well, no, <span>but…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>…that's</span> the <span>problem</span>. There's a <span>rival</span> <span>company</span> who's also <span>targeting</span> the <span>European</span> <span>market</span> <span>called</span> <span>Tutti</span> <span>Fruity</span> <span>-</span> and they'll do anything to <span>steal</span> our <span>customers</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh I see.<br/>
🎧 So, to keep our <span>head</span> <span>above</span> water, we need a <span>clear</span> <span>strategy…</span> and that's why I've put you in <span>charge</span>. So what <span>shall</span> we do? <span><br/></span>
🎧 I've a feeling <span>Paul</span> hasn't a <span>clue</span> <span>–</span> that's why he <span>wants</span> you to come up with the <span>ideas</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 I think you're right <span>–</span> but I don't know what to say. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Tell him we need to <span>price</span> the <span>rivals</span> out of the <span>market</span>, that <span>means</span> <span>offer</span> the <span>lowest</span> <span>prices</span> so <span>nobody</span> <span>wants</span> to buy <span>plastic</span> <span>fruit</span> from our <span>rivals</span>. You could say that we need to <span>corner</span> the <span>market</span>, that <span>means</span> Tip Top <span>Trading</span> <span>dominates</span> the <span>plastic</span> <span>fruit</span> <span>market</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh, thanks. That's very <span>useful</span>.<br/>
🎧 So <span>Anna</span>, any <span>thoughts</span>? <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Lots</span> <span>Paul</span>. I think we've got to <span>compete</span> on <span>price</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes? <span><br/></span>
🎧 We need to <span>price</span> <span>Tutti</span> <span>Fruity</span> out of the <span>market</span>. We need to <span>corner</span> the <span>market</span> so that everyone <span>knows</span> we are the best <span>choice</span> for good <span>quality</span>, good <span>value</span> <span>plastic</span> <span>fruit</span>.<br/>
🎧 I like it! <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>And…</span> <span>and…</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 Tell him we need to <span>build</span> good <span>relationships</span> with our <span>customers</span> <span>–</span> that <span>means</span> we give them good <span>service</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>…we</span> need to <span>build</span> good <span>relationships</span> with our <span>customers</span>. Talk to them <span>regularly</span>, <span>send</span> them <span>gifts…</span> go and meet them <span>face</span> to <span>face</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Face</span> to <span>face</span>? Yes, great idea <span>–</span> just what I was thinking. If we <span>follow</span> this <span>strategy</span> I <span>reckon</span> there could be a <span>bonus</span> for us all by <span>Christmas</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Well done <span>Anna</span>. Very <span>convincing</span>. If you can put your <span>ideas</span> into <span>practice</span> you'll <span>save</span> the <span>company</span>. Let's <span>remind</span> <span>ourselves</span> of the <span>words</span> you used to <span>create</span> the <span>European</span> <span>marketing</span> <span>strategy…<br/></span>
🎧 We've got to <span>compete</span> on <span>price</span>.<br/>
🎧 We need to <span>price</span> the <span>rivals</span> out of the <span>market</span>.<br/>
🎧 We need to <span>corner</span> the <span>market</span>.<br/>
🎧 We need to <span>build</span> good <span>relationships</span> with our <span>customers</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Well, things <span>seem</span> to be going well for <span>Anna…</span> or are they? <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Anna</span>! <span>Anna</span>! That man from <span>France</span> has <span>called</span> again and <span>left</span> a <span>message</span>. He's not happy this time. Something about us trying to rip them off! <span><br/></span>
🎧 What? Rip them off? <span><br/></span>
🎧 It <span>means</span> over <span>charging</span> them or <span>giving</span> them <span>poor</span> <span>quality</span> <span>goods</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 That's not <span>fair</span>. I'm going to have to <span>sort</span> this out. <span><br/></span>
🎧 That's it <span>Anna</span> <span>–</span> go and <span>build</span> a good <span>relationship</span> with your <span>customer</span>! <span>Bye</span> for now.<br/>
<span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>Welcome</span> back to Tip Top <span>Trading</span> where things aren't going too well. <span>Anna</span> <span>negotiated</span> a <span>deal</span> with a <span>client</span> in <span>France</span> but now they <span>claim</span> <span>they've</span> been <span>ripped</span> off! This has got to get <span>sorted</span> <span>–</span> quickly. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh <span>Denise</span>, what exactly did they say? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Something about them <span>agreeing</span> a <span>price</span> for <span>5,000</span> <span>lemons</span> and then being <span>offered</span> a better <span>price</span> by another <span>company</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>That'll</span> be <span>Tutti</span> <span>Fruity</span> <span>–</span> they want our <span>business</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Sounds like they're going to get it, <span>unless</span> you <span>sort</span> it out. Maybe you should work out some new <span>figures</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Figures</span>? Is there something wrong with my <span>figure</span> <span>–</span> am I too fat? <span><br/></span>
🎧 No <span>Anna</span>! Your <span>numbers</span> <span>–</span> work out a new <span>price</span>, see if you can <span>squeeze</span> the <span>price</span> of <span>lemons</span> <span>–</span> maybe you can <span>price</span> <span>Tutti</span> <span>Fruity</span> out of the <span>market</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, <span>somebody</span> else has said that. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Yes it was me <span>Anna</span>! Do your <span>calculations</span>, see if you can <span>offer</span> a better <span>deal</span> and <span>price</span> <span>Tutti</span> <span>Fruity</span> out of the <span>market</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 OK. I could sell them <span>cheaper</span> but there would be less <span>profit</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Well, less <span>profit</span> is better than no <span>profit</span>. And who <span>knows</span>, if this <span>goes</span> well, it might <span>lead</span> to more <span>contracts</span>. But it's down to you now to make that <span>call</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 But what am I going to say? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Be <span>friendly</span> and <span>say…</span> I'm <span>sorry</span> to hear you're not happy with our <span>price</span>. Tell them Tip Top <span>Trading</span> <span>prides</span> <span>itself</span> on <span>quality</span> <span>products</span> and good <span>value</span> for money. And <span>flatter</span> them and say they are a <span>valued</span> <span>customer</span> and their <span>business</span> is very <span>important</span> to us. <span><br/></span>
🎧 And what <span>shall</span> I say about the <span>price</span>? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Tell them you can <span>match</span> the <span>price</span> of our <span>competitors</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Match</span> the <span>price</span>. Right. Thanks. OK, I had better <span>call</span> them.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trader</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Bonjour</span>. <span>Fruit</span> <span>Traders</span> <span>International</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh, <span>erm</span>, <span>hello</span>, is that <span>Monsieur</span> <span>Brown</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Trader</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Oui</span>. Yes. <span><br/></span>
🎧 This is <span>Anna…</span> from Tip Top <span>Trading</span>. I was <span>sorry</span> to <span>receive</span> your <span>message</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trader</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 Yes, well. I thought we were doing good <span>business</span> and then another <span>company</span> <span>called</span> me and <span>offered</span> me a much better <span>deal</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Yes, I <span>understand</span>. <span>I’m</span> <span>sorry</span> to hear you're not happy with our <span>price…</span> but <span>hopefully</span> we can <span>sort</span> something out?<br/>
🎧 <span>Trader</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh yes? <span><br/></span>
🎧 You are a <span>valued</span> <span>customer</span> and your <span>business</span> is very <span>important</span> to <span>us…</span> and we would love to see our <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemons</span> on <span>display</span> in the <span>restaurants</span> and <span>shops</span> of <span>France</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 That's a nice touch <span>Anna</span>, well done!<br/>
🎧 <span>Trader</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 So? <span><br/></span>
🎧 So, I've done some <span>calculations</span> and we can <span>offer</span> you a better <span>price</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trader</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 But <span>Tutti</span> <span>Fruity</span> can <span>offer</span> us a good <span>price</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 I'm sure they can <span>but…</span> <span>we…</span> <span>we…</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 Yes <span>Anna</span>? <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>…at</span> Tip Top <span>Trading</span> we <span>pride</span> <span>ourselves</span> on <span>quality</span> <span>products</span> and good <span>value</span> and I think we can <span>match</span> <span>Tutti</span> <span>Fruity's</span> <span>price…</span> in <span>fact</span> I know we can <span>beat</span> it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trader</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 I see. That's good to hear <span>but…</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 We'll give you an <span>extra</span> <span>10%</span> <span>discount</span> <span>–</span> but <span>obviously</span> we would like you to make a <span>bigger</span> <span>order</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trader</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh, a <span>bigger</span> <span>order</span>. I will have to have a think about this. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Yes, of course, but please let me know as soon as you can before <span>someone</span> else <span>snaps</span> up this <span>offer</span>. <span>Merci</span>. <span>Au</span> <span>revoir</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trader</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Ah</span>, <span>merci</span>, <span>au</span> <span>revoir</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Excellent</span> work <span>Anna</span>! I can see why she's got the <span>job</span> now. But will her <span>sales</span> <span>tactics</span> pay off? Let's <span>remind</span> <span>ourselves</span> of some of the great <span>lines</span> that <span>Anna</span> used in trying to <span>resolve</span> a <span>tricky</span> <span>sales</span> <span>deal…<br/></span>
🎧 I'm <span>sorry</span> to hear you're not happy with our <span>price</span>.<br/>
🎧 Tip Top <span>Trading</span> <span>prides</span> <span>itself</span> on <span>quality</span> <span>products</span> and good <span>value</span> for money. You are a <span>valued</span> <span>customer</span> and your <span>business</span> is very <span>important</span> to us.<br/>
🎧 We can <span>match</span> the <span>price</span> of our <span>competitors</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Well done <span>Anna</span>. It looks like you may have <span>saved</span> that <span>deal</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Saved</span> the <span>deal</span>? Is there a <span>problem</span>? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Well, <span>Tutti</span> <span>Fruity</span> has <span>tried</span> to <span>undercut</span> our <span>price</span> but I think I may have <span>saved</span> the <span>deal</span> we had with <span>International</span> <span>Fruit</span> <span>Traders</span> in <span>France</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Yes, <span>Anna</span> <span>offered</span> a <span>lower</span> <span>price</span> for a <span>bigger</span> <span>order</span> and they're having a think about it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Crumbs</span>. If the <span>deal's</span> not <span>complete</span> I think you need to get out to <span>France</span> and <span>seal</span> the <span>deal</span>. I want you and <span>Tom</span> to fly out there as soon as <span>possible</span> and do some <span>schmoozing</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh! You and <span>Tom</span> hey? <span><br/></span>
🎧 That's enough <span>Denise</span>! This should be fun. Find out what <span>happens</span> next time on English at Work. <span>Bye</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>Hello</span> again. Well, this is very <span>exciting</span>! <span>Paul</span>, the <span>boss</span>, is <span>sending</span> <span>Anna</span> and <span>Tom</span> on a <span>business</span> <span>trip</span> to <span>France</span>. He <span>wants</span> them to <span>clinch</span> the <span>deal</span> with a <span>company</span> <span>interested</span> in <span>buying</span> their <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemons</span>. But has <span>Tom</span> got more than <span>business</span> on his <span>mind</span>?<br/>
🎧 Really? <span>What…</span> me and <span>Anna…</span> to <span>France</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes but make sure you get that <span>contract</span> <span>signed</span>. We need the <span>business</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, yeah, of course. Are we <span>staying</span> <span>overnight</span>?<br/>
🎧 There's no money for that <span>–</span> just get there and come <span>straight</span> back. Oh and could you <span>bring</span> back those nice <span>French</span> <span>biscuits</span> that have in the <span>duty-free</span> <span>shop</span>?<br/>
🎧 Sure. So, <span>Anna</span>, we're off on <span>holiday</span> together are <span>we?</span>! <span><br/></span>
🎧 No! But I've got to book the <span>flights</span> online, can you help me please?<br/>
🎧 It's not my thing. I'm sure <span>Denise</span> will help. I need to go and <span>pack</span> for this <span>trip</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Yes <span>Marge…</span> in the <span>cupboard…</span> <span>envelopes</span> <span>apparently…</span> <span>Tom</span> and <span>Anna…</span> oh here she <span>is…</span> got to go <span>Marge…</span> <span>bye</span>. <span>Hello</span> <span>Anna</span>, everything OK? <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Sort</span> of. I've got to go to <span>France</span> with <span>Tom</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Yes, I know. I thought you'd be <span>pleased</span> to go with <span>Tom</span>, after your time in the <span>stationery</span> <span>cupboard</span> with him! <span><br/></span>
🎧 I was just <span>finding</span> an <span>envelope</span> <span>Denise</span>. <span>Anyway</span>, I'm <span>worried</span> about <span>booking</span> the <span>flights</span> online. I usually book <span>flights</span> at a travel <span>agent's</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 It's <span>company</span> <span>policy</span> now, we have to do everything online <span>–</span> even my food <span>shopping</span> <span>–</span> but <span>don’t</span> tell <span>Paul</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh right. So where <span>shall</span> I <span>begin</span>? <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Pull</span> up a <span>chair</span> <span>Anna</span> and we'll <span>log</span> on. Right let's start with the <span>British</span> <span>Airlines</span> <span>website</span>. There. <span>London</span> to <span>Marseille</span>. What is the <span>outbound</span> <span>date</span>? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Going out <span>tomorrow</span>, back <span>tomorrow</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Business</span> class or <span>Economy</span> class? I think we'll say <span>Economy</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 That's <span>cheaper</span> I <span>guess</span>. What's this mean? <span>Flexible</span> or <span>fixed</span>? <span><br/></span>
🎧 A <span>flexible</span> <span>ticket</span> <span>means</span> you can change your <span>flight</span> but a <span>fixed</span> one <span>means</span> you can't <span>–</span> and that's <span>cheaper</span> so we'll choose that one. I'll book you on the <span>8am</span> <span>flight</span> from <span>Heathrow</span> and <span>flying</span> home at <span>6pm</span>. I just need to <span>type</span> in your full <span>names</span> now and <span>select</span> your <span>seats</span>. <span>Window</span> or <span>aisle</span>? <span><br/></span>
🎧 I'll what? <span><br/></span>
🎧 No <span>Anna</span>. A <span>seat</span> by the <span>aisle</span> or by the <span>window</span>? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh, an <span>aisle</span> <span>seat</span> please, <span>Denise</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Good. What's your <span>frequent</span> <span>flyer</span> <span>number</span>? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh I don't have one of those.<br/>
🎧 What's that? <span>Frequent</span> <span>flyer</span> <span>number</span>? Here I've got a <span>gold</span> <span>status</span> <span>card</span>, can you <span>stick</span> my <span>number</span> in? <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Gold</span> <span>status</span>! Where did you get that?<br/>
🎧 Oh, I've <span>flown</span> <span>loads</span> of <span>times</span> for <span>business</span>. I've done <span>deals</span> all around the <span>world</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 He <span>means</span> he's been on <span>lots</span> of <span>jollies</span> <span>–</span> free <span>trips</span> <span>paid</span> for by the <span>company</span> <span>–</span> and all he's come home with is a sun <span>tan</span>! <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, really. Right I just need to pay <span>now…</span> <span>using</span> the <span>company</span> <span>account</span> of course.<br/>
🎧 <span>Cool</span>. Now, what do you think of my <span>sunglasses</span>? <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Lovely</span> <span>Tom</span>. <span>Denise</span> has <span>booked</span> you a <span>window</span> <span>seat</span> OK?<br/>
🎧 No! <span>Sorry</span> I can't sit by the <span>window…</span> <span>I’m…</span> <span>errr…</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 Yes <span>Tom</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I mean, it's only <span>polite</span> that the <span>lady</span> <span>sits</span> by the <span>window</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Really?</span>! <span><br/></span>
🎧 What's <span>Tom</span> <span>like?</span>! <span>Hopefully</span> he'll <span>prove</span> a <span>useful</span> <span>business</span> <span>partner</span> for <span>Anna</span> on the <span>trip</span> to <span>France</span>. Here's a <span>reminder</span> of some of the <span>questions</span> you may be <span>asked</span> when <span>booking</span> a <span>flight…<br/></span>
🎧 What's the <span>outbound</span> and <span>return</span> <span>date</span>?<br/>

🎧 Do you want a <span>fixed</span> or <span>flexible</span> <span>ticket</span>?<br/>

🎧 Thanks <span>Denise</span>. Hey <span>Anna</span>, I'm so <span>pleased</span> that we're on this <span>trip</span> together. It'll be nice to <span>spend</span> some time with you. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Yes and to do some <span>business</span> and really <span>show</span> <span>Paul</span> we are his best <span>employees</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>Tom</span>, could you let go of my <span>hand</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Sorry</span>, it's just I get <span>nervous</span> <span>flying</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Well, we've <span>landed</span> in <span>Marseille</span> now so you're <span>safe…</span> oh, I like your <span>passport</span> <span>photo</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh do you? <span><br/></span>
🎧 I didn't know your <span>middle</span> name was <span>Stanley</span>.<br/>

🎧 Really? Come on we need to get a <span>taxi</span>. <span>Taxi</span>! <span>Taxi</span>! <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Hello</span> again. <span>Anna</span> and <span>Tom</span> are on a very <span>important</span> <span>business</span> <span>trip</span> to try and <span>sign</span> a <span>deal</span> to sell their <span>plastic</span> <span>fruit</span> to a <span>company</span> in <span>France</span>. The <span>company</span> has <span>received</span> a better <span>offer</span> so <span>Anna</span> needs to <span>convince</span> them that Tip Top <span>Trading's</span> <span>lemons</span> are best. Are you feeling <span>confident</span> <span>Anna</span>? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Not really. It was OK <span>speaking</span> to them on the phone but <span>seeing</span> them <span>face-to-face</span> is quite <span>scary</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 You'll be fine. <span>Stay</span> <span>calm</span>. They'll be <span>pleased</span> you've taken the time to fly out and see them <span>–</span> but tell them you're <span>grateful</span> for their time and <span>recap</span> what you told them on the phone. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh yes <span>–</span> <span>beat</span> the <span>price</span> of the <span>competitor</span> but get them to make a <span>bigger</span> <span>order</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Yes. If they <span>order</span> more you can <span>offer</span> a <span>bigger</span> <span>discount</span>. Good <span>luck</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh look, we're here now. Now <span>Anna</span>, I hope you don't <span>mind</span> me saying, but just leave the talking to me. Right? <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Err</span>, <span>well…<br/></span>
🎧 Oh, <span>Madame</span> <span>Brown</span>, <span>ciao</span>, great to see <span>you<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Trader</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 What? <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Monsieur</span> <span>Brown</span>. <span>Bonjour</span>. I'm <span>Anna</span> from Tip Top <span>Trading</span>. This is my <span>colleague</span> <span>Tom</span>. Thank you for <span>sparing</span> the time to see us.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trader</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 No <span>problem</span>. Did you have a good <span>flight</span>?<br/>
🎧 It was great. I love those little <span>bottles</span> of <span>wine</span> they give <span>out…</span> I <span>kept</span> a few with me if you <span>fancy</span> a <span>glass</span> of <span>vin</span> <span>rouge</span>? <span><br/></span>
🎧 I think we should sit down and <span>discuss</span> <span>business</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trader</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, yeah, good idea. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Now, I <span>believe</span> <span>Tutti</span> <span>Fruity</span> has <span>offered</span> you a good <span>price</span> but as I said on the phone, we can <span>beat</span> that.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trader</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 Yes you did.<br/>
🎧 Did you <span>Anna?</span>! <span><br/></span>
🎧 But to get this <span>price</span> you've got to buy <span>lots</span> more. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Anna</span>! That's not very <span>subtle</span>. You need to <span>convince</span> them they need to buy more without <span>telling</span> them they have to.<br/>
🎧 What she <span>means</span> is our <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemons</span> are made with our <span>unique</span> <span>laser</span> <span>curve</span> <span>technology</span>. They are <span>hard</span> <span>wearing</span> and a <span>joy</span> to have on <span>display</span> in any <span>shop</span> <span>window</span> or <span>restaurant</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Tom</span>, that's <span>amazing</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Tom:</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 I read it on the back of the box! <span><br/></span>
🎧 So, we really feel that we have a <span>product</span> that you'll be <span>proud</span> to <span>display</span>. And to get this <span>fantastic</span> <span>price</span> you just need to place an <span>order</span> of <span>10,000</span>.<br/>
🎧 And we can even <span>throw</span> in a free <span>sample</span> of our new <span>Perfect</span> <span>Peach</span> <span>range</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Each <span>lemon</span> comes with a <span>satisfaction</span> <span>guarantee</span>. I know you won't be <span>disappointed</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trader</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>. It sounds good. OK, I think you have a <span>deal</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Good work <span>Anna</span>. Don't <span>forget</span> to ask him to <span>sign</span> the <span>contract</span> and tell him when he can <span>expect</span> the <span>order</span> to be <span>delivered</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 OK. I would be <span>grateful</span> if you could just <span>sign</span> the <span>contract</span>. We'll get the <span>lemons</span> to you as quickly as we can. <span>Tom</span>, do you have a pen?<br/>
🎧 <span>Erm</span>, no <span>actually</span>. It was in my bag <span>yesterday</span> but it's <span>gone…</span> it was a nice, a good one too.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trader</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 No <span>problem</span>. I have a pen. There you go. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Thank you. It was a <span>pleasure</span> doing <span>business</span> with you. We'll get those <span>lemons</span> to you in two <span>weeks'</span> time.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trader</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Perfect</span>! <span><br/></span>
🎧 Good work <span>Anna…oh</span> and <span>Tom</span> too. The <span>contract</span> is <span>signed</span> but now you have to <span>deliver</span> what you've <span>promised</span>. There are many <span>ways</span> to <span>clinch</span> a <span>deal;</span> here are some of the <span>phrases</span> <span>Anna</span> <span>used…<br/></span>
🎧 Thank you for <span>sparing</span> the time to see us.<br/>
🎧 Each <span>lemon</span> comes with a <span>satisfaction</span> <span>guarantee</span> <span>-</span> I know you won't be <span>disappointed</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would be <span>grateful</span> if you could just <span>sign</span> the <span>contract</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you. It was a <span>pleasure</span> doing <span>business</span> with you. <span><br/></span>
🎧 So it's been a <span>successful</span> day. It's time for <span>Tom</span> and <span>Anna</span> to fly back to <span>London</span> and tell <span>Paul</span> the good <span>news…</span> or is it? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh no look, our <span>flight</span> to <span>London</span> is <span>cancelled</span>! It's the last one today. What are we going to do?<br/>
🎧 Well, I <span>guess</span> we're just going to have to <span>stay</span> here for the <span>night</span>. I'll <span>sort</span> out a <span>hotel</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Until</span> next time. <span>Bye</span>!<br/>

🎧 <span>Welcome</span> back to English at Work, where <span>Anna</span> and <span>Tom</span> are in a bit of a <span>predicament</span>. <span>Following</span> a <span>successful</span> <span>business</span> <span>meeting</span>, <span>they've</span> <span>returned</span> to the <span>airport</span> to <span>discover</span> their <span>flight</span> has been <span>cancelled</span>. What are they going to do next?<br/>
🎧 Right, <span>they've</span> <span>rebooked</span> us on to the next <span>flight</span>, which is at <span>7</span> <span>o'clock</span> <span>tomorrow</span> morning. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Tomorrow</span> <span>morning?</span>! What are we going to do <span>until</span> then?<br/>
🎧 It's OK <span>Anna</span>, <span>calm</span> down. I've <span>sorted</span> out a <span>hotel…</span> quite a nice one <span>actually</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 But what about our new <span>contract</span>? I've got to <span>sort</span> it out!<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna</span>, take a <span>deep</span> <span>breath…</span> it'll be ok. Let's go and get a <span>drink</span> and we'll work things out. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Anna</span>, maybe <span>Tom's</span> right for once. Go and enjoy some <span>French</span> <span>hospitality</span>. You've done really well today but <span>perhaps</span> you should keep your <span>boss</span> <span>Paul</span> in the <span>picture</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>picture</span>? I didn't take any <span>photos</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 No <span>Anna</span>! I mean keep him <span>informed</span>. It's always a good idea to keep the <span>boss</span> <span>updated</span> on what's going on <span>–</span> he is the <span>boss</span> after all. <span><br/></span>
🎧 OK. I will.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, this one looks quite <span>cosy</span>. I'll <span>order</span> us a <span>beer</span> <span>shall</span> I? <span><br/></span>
🎧 I'd <span>prefer</span> an <span>orange</span> <span>juice</span> please.<br/>
🎧 Oh really? OK then. <span>Err</span>, <span>Garcon</span>. <span>Je</span> <span>m'appelle</span> <span>un</span> <span>beer</span> <span>et</span> <span>citron</span> <span>juice</span> thing. <span>Au</span> <span>revoir</span>! <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>What?</span>! No <span>Tom</span>! <span>Pardon</span>, <span>Je</span> <span>voudrais</span> <span>une</span> <span>grande</span> <span>biere</span> <span>et</span> <span>du</span> <span>juice</span> <span>d'orange</span> <span>s'il</span> <span>vous</span> <span>plait</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Waiter</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Oui</span> <span>Madame</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think she <span>likes</span> you! Well, everyone <span>likes</span> you <span>Anna</span>. I like you <span>because…</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 I like you too <span>Tom</span> but don't you think I should <span>call</span> <span>Paul</span> and <span>update</span> him on what's going <span>on…</span> keep him in the <span>picture</span>?<br/>
🎧 I <span>dunno</span>. Let's just enjoy this <span>moment</span> <span>shall</span> we? And <span>besides</span>, he'll be at his <span>biscuit</span> <span>appreciation</span> class by now.<br/>
🎧 No. I would be <span>happier</span> just to <span>call</span> him. Could I <span>borrow</span> your <span>mobile</span> phone please? My <span>battery</span> has run out.<br/>
🎧 Yeah sure. You'll find his <span>number</span> under <span>Attila</span> the <span>Hun</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Attila</span> the <span>Hun</span>?<br/>
🎧 Just my little <span>joke</span>! <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Cheeky</span>! But <span>hold</span> <span>on…</span> what am I going to say to him? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Well, don't <span>call</span> him <span>Attila</span> the <span>Hun</span>! Think before you <span>call</span> <span>him:</span> It's good <span>news</span> <span>–</span> you've <span>closed</span> the <span>deal</span> and the <span>contract</span> is <span>signed</span>. We need to <span>proceed</span> with the <span>order</span> as quickly as <span>possible</span>. And say, I'm <span>committed</span> to getting the <span>order</span> <span>delivered</span> on time. But if you need help, ask for it. <span><br/></span>
🎧 OK I will. It's <span>ringing…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Hello</span>? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Hi <span>Paul</span>. It's <span>Anna</span>. I've got some good <span>news</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Hold</span> on. <span>Sorry</span>, I'm just <span>munching</span> some new <span>crumbly</span> <span>cream</span> <span>biscuits</span>. Now, what's the good <span>news</span>? Is it about the <span>contract</span>? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Yes! I've <span>closed</span> the <span>deal</span> with <span>Fruit</span> <span>Traders</span> <span>International</span> and the <span>contract</span> is <span>signed</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Excellent</span> <span>news</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 To keep them happy, we need to <span>proceed</span> with the <span>order</span> as quickly as <span>possible</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course, of course. So what are you planning to do? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Well, <span>obviously</span>, I'm <span>committed</span> to getting the <span>order</span> <span>delivered</span> on time but I might need some help. I <span>wonder</span> if <span>Tom</span> <span>could…<br/></span>
🎧 Yes, <span>Tom</span> can help you. <span>Denise</span> tells me you have <span>a…</span> special <span>chemistry</span>! <span>Actually</span>, where is <span>Tom</span> now? Is he home yet? <span><br/></span>
🎧 He's not. <span>Actually</span> <span>Paul</span>, <span>Tom</span> and I are going to <span>stay</span> in a <span>hotel</span> <span>tonight…</span> <span>Hello</span>? <span>Hello</span>? Oh, I've <span>lost</span> the <span>signal</span>, he's <span>gone</span>.<br/>
🎧 Never <span>mind</span> <span>Anna</span>. I think he got the <span>message</span>. Another <span>drink</span>? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Let's hope <span>Paul</span> has got the right <span>message</span> about <span>Anna</span> and <span>Tom</span>! <span>Anyway</span>, she's <span>briefed</span> the <span>boss</span> and <span>kept</span> him in the <span>picture</span>. Here's a <span>reminder</span> of some of the <span>phrases</span> she <span>used:<br/></span>
🎧 It's good <span>news</span> <span>–</span> I've <span>closed</span> the <span>deal</span> and the <span>contract</span> is <span>signed</span>.<br/>
🎧 We need to <span>proceed</span> with the <span>order</span> as quickly as <span>possible</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>committed</span> to getting the <span>order</span> <span>delivered</span> on <span>time…</span> but I will need some help. <span><br/></span>
🎧 A good <span>day's</span> work for <span>Anna</span> but now it's time for bed.<br/>
🎧 Right, well, it's time for bed. We've got an <span>early</span> start <span>tomorrow</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 So, where are we <span>staying</span>?<br/>
🎧 A <span>lovely</span> little <span>boutique</span> <span>hotel</span>, just <span>round</span> the <span>corner</span>. I've <span>booked</span> a <span>room</span> with a <span>view</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 A <span>room</span>? One <span>room?</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Err</span> yeah. That's all they had, <span>actually…</span> <span>honest</span>! <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>. This could be <span>interesting</span>. Let's hope things <span>remain</span> <span>professional</span>. <span>Until</span> next time. <span>Bye</span>!<br/>
<span><br/></span>
