🎧 <span>Welcome</span> back to English at Work where Anna is <span>very</span>... well, very happy! You're in a good <span>mood</span> Anna.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna<br/></span>
🎧 Well, I'm just back from <span>France</span>, where everything went really well. It was quite an <span>experience</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good. You got the <span>contract</span> for that big <span>order</span>. All you need to do now is to <span>deliver</span> what <span>you've</span> <span>promised</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna<br/></span>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 Hello Anna. Is Tom OK? He <span>seems</span> really <span>grumpy</span> since he got back from <span>France</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna<br/></span>
🎧 He's fine. He just had to <span>sleep</span> on the <span>sofa</span> last <span>night</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Really?</span>! I'm sure that's not what he was planning. Now, did Paul <span>mention</span> he's got a new <span>member</span> of <span>staff</span> for you to meet this morning?<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna<br/></span>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 <span>Typical</span>! Well, she's <span>coming</span> up in the <span>lift</span> with Paul now.<br/>
🎧 Anna <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh, so who is she? <span><br/></span>
🎧 It's <span>Rachel</span>. Do you <span>remember</span>? <span>She's</span> the <span>woman</span> who Mr <span>Socrates</span> <span>recommended</span>. He <span>says</span> she's <span>brilliant</span> and <span>allegedly</span> one of his best <span>employees</span>... oh, here she comes now.<br/>
🎧 <span>…and</span> this is our <span>office</span>. Ah, Anna, there you are. Did I <span>mention</span> before you went to <span>France</span>, that <span>Rachel</span> is <span>joining</span> us for a while?<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 Ah... well... here she is. This is <span>Rachel</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Rachel</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 Hi!<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna<br/></span>
🎧 Hi. I'm Anna. I work here as a <span>sales</span> <span>executive</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Rachel<br/></span>
🎧 I know. You're quite new aren't you, <span>ya</span>?<br/>
🎧 Not that new. She's just <span>won</span> a great <span>contract</span> for us. <span>Anyway</span>, looks like you two are going to get on like a house on <span>fire</span>. Anna, I'd like you to, <span>sort</span> of, work <span>alongside</span> <span>Rachel</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Rachel<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Alongside</span>? Shouldn't I be in <span>charge</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Yes</span>... it's just, you know, you're not <span>familiar</span> with our <span>office</span> and Anna is, <span>sort</span> of, across this new <span>contract</span>... <span>so</span>... if you don't <span>mind</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Rachel</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 OK. Just for now, but don't think I'm going to be told what to do. <span><br/></span>
🎧 I'm sure you won't be <span>Rachel</span> but maybe we could help each other?<br/>
🎧 <span>Rachel</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 I'll try. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Good! Oh <span>dear</span>. This is <span>awkward</span>. I've never <span>worked</span> with <span>anyone</span> like this before. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Well, <span>now's</span> your <span>chance</span> Anna. <span>Rachel</span> may be <span>awkward</span> to <span>manage</span> but try these <span>phrases</span> which may help things go more <span>smoothly</span>. Say, <span>"I</span> <span>understand</span> you have lots of <span>experience</span> so I would like to use your <span>skills</span> to help with the <span>task."</span> And, <span>"Together</span> we can do this <span>job</span> really <span>well."</span> But why not just start by <span>making</span> her a cup of tea. Good <span>luck</span>! <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh thanks. <span>Rachel</span>, would you like a cup of tea? And then we could talk about this <span>contract</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Rachel</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 I don't drink tea. Let's just get down to <span>business</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh, right.<br/>
🎧 <span>Rachel</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 Now, I think you need to check your <span>stock</span> and make sure you've got your <span>oranges</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Err</span>... It's <span>lemons</span> actually.<br/>
🎧 <span>Rachel<br/></span>
🎧 Whatever. Just get them <span>and</span>... you <span>know</span>... put them in <span>a</span>... <span>thingy</span>... a box. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Well, <span>actually</span>... I <span>understand</span> you have lots of <span>experience</span> so maybe we could you use your <span>skills</span> for this <span>task</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Rachel</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 Well, it's <span>true</span>, I do have lots of <span>experience</span>. Thanks for <span>recognising</span> that. <span><br/></span>
🎧 So <span>maybe</span>... we could work on this <span>job</span>... together?<br/>
🎧 <span>Rachel</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh <span>ya</span>, sure. Great. Of course. I can get <span>hold</span> of these <span>oranges</span>... <span>err</span>... <span>lemons</span>, <span>pronto</span>. I know a man who can get some <span>second-hand</span> <span>ones</span>, it'll <span>save</span> us <span>loads</span> of money. <span><br/></span>
🎧 But what about the <span>quality</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Rachel<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Quality?</span>! It's the <span>cost</span> we've got to <span>worry</span> about. Keep up <span>Hannah</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Anna.<br/>
🎧 Come on Anna. Don't let her <span>boss</span> you around. It's time to <span>stand</span> your <span>ground</span>. If she <span>causes</span> <span>trouble</span> say <span>"let's</span> <span>discuss</span> this so we can agree on a plan of <span>action"</span> or <span>"please</span> <span>respect</span> my <span>decision</span> and <span>let's</span> move <span>on."<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, OK, I'll give it a try. <span>Rachel</span>, I like your <span>enthusiasm</span> <span>but</span>... can we <span>discuss</span> this so we can agree on a plan of <span>action</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Rachel<br/></span>
🎧 Of course. Why didn't you say? Come on <span>discuss</span>... <span>discuss</span>... talk!<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna<br/></span>
🎧 Well, we <span>pride</span> <span>ourselves</span> on <span>quality</span> <span>products</span> and our <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemon</span> is <span>particularly</span> <span>good</span>... and I think our <span>client</span> is <span>expecting</span> that. So I would like to <span>send</span> them what I had <span>promised</span> in the <span>contract</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Rachel<br/></span>
🎧 Oh <span>ya</span>, I see. But I'm not really sure you're right.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna<br/></span>
🎧 Well, if you could just <span>respect</span> my <span>decision</span> this time and we can move on?<br/>
🎧 <span>Rachel<br/></span>
🎧 Well, just this once <span>Hannah</span>. But I think I'm going to have to talk to Mr <span>Socrates</span> about you.<br/>
🎧 Well done Anna for <span>standing</span> your <span>ground</span>. It can sometimes be <span>tricky</span> working with a new <span>member</span> of <span>staff</span>, but it's <span>important</span> to try and <span>develop</span> a good working <span>relationship</span> <span>–</span> <span>remember</span> <span>business</span> comes first! Let's hear those <span>phrases</span> <span>again:<br/></span>
🎧 I <span>understand</span> you have lots of <span>experience</span>, so I would like to use your <span>skills</span> to help with the <span>task</span>.<br/>
🎧 Together we can do this <span>job</span> really well.<br/>
🎧 Let's <span>discuss</span> this so we can agree on a plan of <span>action</span>.<br/>
🎧 Please <span>respect</span> my <span>decision</span> and let's move on.<br/>
🎧 Hi Anna. Can't <span>believe</span> we were in <span>France</span> this time <span>yesterday</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Rachel<br/></span>
🎧 Oh hello, <span>Tommy</span> boy. Long time no see! This is a nice <span>surprise</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Err</span>... <span>mmmm</span>... <span><br/></span>
🎧 Have you two <span>met</span> before?<br/>
🎧 <span>Rachel</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 We <span>certainly</span> have. Hey <span>Tommy</span> boy?<br/>
🎧 Oh no! <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Ha</span> <span>ha</span>. Looks like Tom is <span>lost</span> for <span>words</span> <span>–</span> let's hope he <span>finds</span> them in time for the next <span>episode</span> of English at Work. Bye!<br/>
<span><br/></span>

🎧 Hello. It's another <span>busy</span> day at the <span>offices</span> of Tip Top <span>Trading</span>... <span><br/></span>
🎧 And I said no <span>John</span>, not at my age, I'd rather take the <span>bus<br/></span>...
🎧 <span>…yeah</span> <span>Pete</span>, that's great, so we'll <span>deliver</span> <span>2,000</span> <span>bananas</span> by <span>Friday</span>. Let's have a <span>beer</span> <span>soon</span>... <span>yeah</span>... <span>cheers</span> <span>mate</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 But there are two people who are <span>busy</span> <span>annoying</span> each <span>other</span>... <span><br/></span>
🎧 So you did what? You <span>ordered</span> the <span>second-hand</span> <span>ones?</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Rachel</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Chillax</span> <span>Hannah</span>... <span><br/></span>
🎧 Anna!<br/>
🎧 <span>Rachel</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>…they're</span> just <span>oranges</span>... <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>…plastic</span> <span>lemons</span> actually. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Anna is <span>struggling</span> to work with <span>Rachel</span>, Mr <span>Socrates'</span> <span>favourite</span> <span>Sales</span> <span>Executive</span>, who he's <span>sent</span> in to help <span>out</span>... or <span>hinder</span> more like!<br/>
🎧 <span>Rachel</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 Look, I'm off for a <span>cappuccino</span>, everything will be just fine. <span>Ciao</span>.<br/>
🎧 Anna, has <span>Rachel</span> <span>gone</span> out? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 She's a bit of a <span>man-eater</span>. She almost <span>ate</span> me once. <span><br/></span>
🎧 She <span>eats</span> men?<br/>
🎧 Well, not exactly. I <span>worked</span> with her in my last <span>job</span>. She was always <span>listening</span> in to other <span>people's</span> <span>conversations</span> and she's always <span>changing</span> <span>jobs</span>. That's why they call her <span>Rachel</span> <span>Rabbit</span> <span>–</span> you know, big <span>ears</span>, always <span>jumping</span> from one <span>job</span> to another. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Rachel</span> <span>Rabbit</span>! That's funny. So she isn't that good then?<br/>
🎧 Oh, <span>useless</span>! She only <span>worked</span> for Mr <span>Socrates</span> because her <span>father</span> <span>threatened</span> to <span>sue</span> the <span>company</span>, after one of our <span>plastic</span> <span>pineapples</span> <span>fell</span> off a <span>shelf</span> and <span>broke</span> his <span>toe</span>. But, better keep that under your hat. <span><br/></span>
🎧 My hat?<br/>
🎧 I mean, keep it <span>secret</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh right, I see. Well, now she's <span>ordered</span> <span>loads</span> of <span>second-hand</span> <span>oranges</span> to <span>send</span> to our new <span>customer</span> in <span>France</span>.<br/>
🎧 But they wanted <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemons</span>? <span><br/></span>
🎧 I know. I'm not sure what to do, so I'm going to have to speak to Paul about this. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Yes it's a good idea to <span>refer</span> up sometimes <span>–</span> ask the <span>boss</span> for advice. Say to him <span>"I'm</span> <span>concerned</span> that <span>Rachel</span> has made a <span>mistake</span> that might <span>affect</span> the <span>business"</span>. You might also say <span>"she's</span> not <span>pulling</span> her <span>weight"</span>, <span>meaning</span> she's not doing the work she is <span>supposed</span> to do. And you could say <span>"I'm</span> <span>finding</span> it very <span>difficult</span> to work with this <span>person."</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 Right. I'll try. There's Paul <span>now</span>... Paul, could I have a <span>word</span> please?<br/>
🎧 Of course, Anna. Let's go in my <span>office</span>. Now, how can I help? <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Err</span>, well, it's <span>Rachel</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, <span>amazing</span> <span>woman</span>. Mr <span>Socrates'</span> <span>favourite</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 I <span>know</span>... but I'm <span>finding</span> it <span>difficult</span> to work with her.<br/>
🎧 Oh why's that? <span><br/></span>
🎧 I'm a bit <span>concerned</span> that she's made a <span>mistake</span> and it might <span>affect</span> our <span>business</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Golly</span> <span>gosh</span>. <span>Really?</span>! Why's that? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Well, she's <span>ordered</span> <span>second-hand</span> <span>oranges</span> for our new <span>client</span> in <span>France</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>marvellous</span>... isn't it? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Well, I <span>asked</span> her not to. They wanted <span>lemons</span>... new <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemons</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ah... not so <span>marvellous</span>. Anything else? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Well, <span>speaking</span> <span>personally</span>, I don't think she's <span>pulling</span> her <span>weight</span>. She doesn't <span>seem</span> to do any work and just <span>keeps</span> going out to buy <span>cappuccinos</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's just not on. Look Anna, I will look into this <span>straight</span> away and see if I can <span>sort</span> this out. Thank you for <span>bringing</span> it to my <span>attention</span>. Now, I think you've <span>earned</span> a <span>custard</span> <span>cream</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 So Anna has <span>expressed</span> her <span>concerns</span> to Paul, the <span>boss</span>. It's up to him to <span>investigate</span>. As long as you have a <span>fair</span> <span>reason</span> to <span>complain</span> about a <span>difficult</span> <span>member</span> of <span>staff</span>, these are some of the <span>phrases</span> you could <span>use:</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 I'm <span>concerned</span> that she's made a <span>mistake</span> that might <span>affect</span> the <span>business</span>.<br/>
🎧 She's not <span>pulling</span> her <span>weight</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>finding</span> it very <span>difficult</span> to work with her.<br/>
🎧 I <span>wonder</span> how Paul is going to <span>handle</span> the <span>situation</span>?<br/>
🎧 Ah, there you are <span>Rachel</span>. Nice <span>cappuccino</span>? Could you <span>step</span> in to my <span>office</span> for a <span>moment</span>... I'd like a <span>word</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Rachel</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Ya</span>, sure. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Ooh</span>, I <span>wonder</span> what that's all about. Do you know Anna?<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, no idea.<br/>
🎧 She's probably going to get a <span>promotion</span> and a pay <span>rise</span>... and a <span>custard</span> <span>cream</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Rachel</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 Thanks Paul, <span>ciao</span>. What a great guy he is. Such a great <span>sense</span> of <span>humour</span>! Looks like we're doing some good work Anna! <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Wwwhat?</span>! <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh Anna. I'm not sure Paul has really <span>sorted</span> out your <span>concerns</span>. But don't <span>worry</span>, we're here to help you out. See you next time on English at Work. Bye!<br/>
<span><br/></span>

🎧 Hello and <span>welcome</span> again to English at Work, where things are a little <span>tense</span>. Anna is <span>finding</span> it <span>hard</span> to work with new <span>employee</span>, <span>Rachel</span>. She's told Paul, the <span>boss</span>, about <span>Rachel's</span> <span>incompetence</span> but he's done <span>nothing</span> about it. <span><br/></span>
🎧 So Anna, how are you feeling today? <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Frustrated</span>. All that work I put in, getting the <span>contract</span> for <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemons</span> and <span>Rachel</span> has <span>sent</span> out a <span>load</span> of <span>second-hand</span> <span>plastic</span> <span>oranges</span>! <span><br/></span>
🎧 I <span>guess</span> you're going to have to call your <span>client</span> and <span>sort</span> out the <span>mess</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 I <span>guess</span> so. Oh hi Tom.<br/>
🎧 Is she about? The <span>man-eater</span>? <span><br/></span>
🎧 No it's all <span>clear</span>, she's <span>gone</span> out for a <span>cappuccino</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good good. Look I <span>managed</span> to call the guy she <span>bought</span> the <span>second-hand</span> <span>oranges</span> from, and I <span>cancelled</span> the <span>order</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Phew</span>, great!<br/>
🎧 Yeah, <span>yeah</span>... and last <span>night</span> I <span>managed</span> to <span>order</span> some <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemons</span> and <span>sent</span> them to that <span>company</span> in <span>France</span> <span>–</span> <span>Fruit</span> <span>Traders</span> <span>International</span>. <span>Here's</span> the <span>paperwork</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Tom, that's <span>brilliant</span>! Here, let me give you a big hug <span>–</span> you <span>saved</span> the day!<br/>
🎧 <span>Ooh</span>, that's a bit <span>tight</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh not again! You two just can't leave each other <span>alone<br/></span>...
🎧 <span>Bbbut</span> it was <span>just</span>... <span><br/></span>
🎧 Say no more Anna. Now, I was <span>looking</span> for my special red pen, have you <span>seen</span> it <span>anywhere</span>?<br/>
🎧 No. Funny that, my <span>pens</span> have <span>gone</span> <span>missing</span> too. <span><br/></span>
🎧 I'll go and get some more.<br/>
🎧 Now Anna, I don't want to <span>interfere</span> but have you called that <span>company</span> in <span>France</span> to see how they are? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Well, they're fine <span>aren't</span> they? <span><br/></span>
🎧 It's good <span>customer</span> <span>service</span> to call them and see how they are.<br/>
🎧 But what do I say?<br/>
🎧 Tell you what. I'll go over there and you can call me and <span>practise</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Right. OK Tom, I'm <span>calling</span> your <span>number</span> now.<br/>
🎧 Hello <span>–</span> <span>Fruit</span> <span>Traders</span> <span>International</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Yes, <span>hello<br/></span>...
🎧 <span>…introduce</span> <span>yourself</span> and ask me how I am. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh right. Hello I'm Anna from Tip Top <span>Trading</span>. How are you today?<br/>
🎧 I'm very well. Now ask me about the <span>order</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 I hope you have <span>received</span> our <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemons</span> and that you are happy with the <span>order</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, very very happy. The <span>lemons</span> <span>are</span>... <span>fantastique</span>! <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh that's good. <span>Erm</span>... we do hope you are <span>pleased</span> with our <span>service</span> and that you may use us again.<br/>
🎧 We <span>certainly</span> will. Thank you. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Do you have any <span>questions</span> you may want to ask?<br/>
🎧 <span>No</span>... actually <span>yes</span>.... <span>err</span>, can <span>I</span>... <span>err</span>... buy you dinner sometime? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Very funny Tom. They won't ask that!<br/>
🎧 No. I'm <span>asking</span> you. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh <span>right</span>... <span>erm</span>... OK <span>then</span>... yes! <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Hooray</span>! Or should I say oh <span>dear</span>? <span>Silly</span> Anna has agreed to go on a dinner <span>date</span> with Tom <span>–</span> but there is still some <span>business</span> to <span>attend</span> to. Don't <span>forget</span> to make that call to your <span>client</span> Anna. <span><br/></span>
🎧 No I won't <span>–</span> in <span>fact</span> I'll do it right now. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Good! While she makes that call, here is a <span>reminder</span> of some of the <span>phrases</span> she could <span>use<br/></span>...
🎧 Hello I'm Anna from Tip Top <span>Trading</span>. How are you today?<br/>
🎧 I hope you have <span>received</span> our <span>order</span> and are happy with it.<br/>
🎧 We do hope you are <span>pleased</span> with our <span>service</span> and that you may use us again.<br/>
🎧 Do you have any <span>questions</span> you may want to ask? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Are you OK Anna? You look a bit <span>annoyed</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 I am <span>–</span> I just called our <span>client</span> in <span>France</span> to check everything was OK and they said <span>Rachel</span> had already called them and told them our <span>lemons</span> were so last <span>season</span> and they would be <span>stupid</span> not to choose <span>oranges</span>! <span><br/></span>
🎧 That's <span>terrible</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>…hey</span> Anna, how about this <span>restaurant</span> for our <span>date</span>... I mean our <span>business</span> <span>meeting</span>. Look at this <span>menu</span>... <span><br/></span>
🎧 Not now Tom. <span>Rachel</span> has <span>messed</span> things up again. She's <span>causing</span> so much <span>trouble</span>. She's got to go.<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh</span>... yeah right. This <span>calls</span> for <span>action</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 It <span>certainly</span> does. It sounds like <span>Rachel</span> has <span>gone</span> too <span>far</span> this time and it's up to Anna to <span>sort</span> things out. But what can she do? Join us again next time on English at Work to find out. Bye!<br/>

🎧 Hello and <span>welcome</span> back to Tip Top <span>Trading</span>. New <span>recruit</span> <span>Rachel</span> has been <span>making</span> life <span>difficult</span> for <span>Anna;</span> she's been <span>making</span> some bad <span>business</span> <span>decisions</span>. Let's find out how Anna can <span>save</span> the day.<br/>
🎧 Right, we've definitely got to do something about <span>Rachel</span>... <span>definitely</span>... only, I'm a bit <span>busy</span> at the <span>moment</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Sorting</span> out your dinner <span>date</span> are you <span>Tom?</span>! So Anna, have you <span>spoken</span> to Paul about this? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Yes I have, but he didn't do anything. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, well he is your <span>boss</span> so I think you've got to speak to him again. Take him some <span>biscuits</span>, that might get his <span>attention</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Well, I'll try <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh and keep <span>notes</span> so you have a <span>record</span> of your <span>conversation</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Denise, you're <span>amazing</span>. But where have the <span>pens</span> <span>gone</span> to? <span><br/></span>
🎧 That is <span>strange</span> <span>–</span> we all <span>seem</span> to be <span>losing</span> our <span>pens</span>. Here, use this old <span>pencil</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Thanks. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Anna. Are you happy <span>complaining</span> <span>officially</span> about <span>Rachel</span>? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Not really but what else can I do? She's been <span>spoiling</span> all the work I've been doing. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Yes she has. OK, well tell Paul the <span>facts</span> and tell him you want <span>action</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 OK. Right, here <span>goes</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Come in. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Hi Paul. I really need to speak to you about <span>Rachel</span>. She really is <span>messing</span> things <span>up…Paul</span>?<br/>
🎧 Sorry, just <span>counting</span> my <span>biscuits</span>. What were you saying? <span>Rachel</span>? Great girl, isn't she? <span><br/></span>
🎧 No she's not.<br/>
🎧 Oh. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Paul, she's already <span>sent</span> out the wrong <span>order</span> and now she's <span>upset</span> our new <span>client</span>. <span>Plus</span>, have you <span>seen</span> the way she <span>dresses</span>? I'm not happy and I think you've got to take some <span>action</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Anna, you're on <span>fire</span>! But <span>stick</span> to the <span>facts</span>, don't get <span>personal</span> about <span>Rachel</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well I'm sure Mr <span>Socrates</span> would <span>disagree</span> with you. Look, if she is as bad as you say then I'll give you my <span>permission</span> to <span>discipline</span> her <span>–</span> give her a <span>warning</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 What! Me?<br/>
🎧 You know what's she done wrong so tell her not to do it <span>again…and</span> <span>besides</span>, I've got an <span>important</span> <span>meeting</span> to go to... and they usually have those <span>delicious</span> <span>shortbread</span> <span>biscuits</span>. So <span>…I'll</span> leave it with you then? <span><br/></span>
🎧 What a <span>useless</span> <span>boss</span>! Anna are you happy about what to do next? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Not really. What am I going to say? <span><br/></span>
🎧 It's not easy but keep <span>calm</span> and <span>professional</span> and say to <span>Rachel</span>, <span>"you've</span> made some <span>serious</span> <span>mistakes"</span> and <span>"you</span> need to <span>consult</span> me before you <span>contact</span> any of our <span>clients."</span> Give her a <span>verbal</span> <span>warning</span> saying <span>"These</span> <span>mistakes</span> <span>cannot</span> <span>happen</span> again, <span>otherwise</span> I will have to <span>refer</span> the <span>matter</span> to <span>someone</span> <span>higher."</span> This may <span>lead</span> to <span>disciplinary</span> <span>action</span> but it may be for the best. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh it's all very <span>serious</span> but I <span>suppose</span> I've got to do it. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Good <span>luck</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Rachel</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 Anna! <span>Darling</span>! What's wrong? I saw Paul and he said you're in a bit of a <span>mood</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 It's not a <span>mood</span> <span>Rachel</span>. Can we talk <span>please…now</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Rachel</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 Yeah sure. Let's sit here, shall we <span>–</span> not in that <span>chair</span> <span>–</span> that's my <span>favourite</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Rachel</span>, I wanted to let you know that you've made some <span>serious</span> <span>mistakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Rachel</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh! <span><br/></span>
🎧 You have really <span>upset</span> our new <span>client</span> <span>–</span> and you think it's ok to sell <span>second</span> <span>hand</span> <span>plastic</span> <span>oranges</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Rachel</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Calm</span> down. It's <span>business</span>, <span>darling</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 It's not good <span>business</span> <span>Rachel</span>. These <span>mistakes</span> <span>cannot</span> <span>happen</span> again. If they do I will have to take <span>matters</span> <span>higher</span> and it could <span>result</span> in <span>disciplinary</span> <span>action</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Rachel</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh! You're quite <span>scary</span> for a short girl. <span><br/></span>
🎧 That was <span>unnecessary</span>! But well done Anna for <span>keeping</span> <span>cool</span> and <span>calm</span> in a <span>difficult</span> <span>situation</span>. Let's hope <span>Rachel</span> has got the <span>message</span>. Here is a <span>reminder</span> of the <span>phrases</span> you could use when <span>giving</span> <span>someone</span> a <span>verbal</span> <span>warning<br/></span>...
🎧 You've made some <span>serious</span> <span>mistakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 You need to <span>consult</span> me before you <span>contact</span> any of our <span>clients</span>.<br/>
🎧 These <span>mistakes</span> <span>cannot</span> <span>happen</span> again <span>otherwise</span> I will have to <span>refer</span> the <span>matter</span> to <span>someone</span> <span>higher</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Let's find out how <span>Rachel</span> is <span>behaving</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ah hello, <span>Rachel</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Rachel</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Tommy</span> boy. Come and give me a hug. <span>Opps</span>!<br/>
🎧 Our <span>pens</span>! All our <span>pens</span>! You've been <span>stealing</span> them! <span>Rachel</span>!<br/>
🎧 What's going on? I say, what are all those <span>pens</span> doing on the <span>floor</span>? <span><br/></span>
🎧 They're from <span>Rachel's</span> <span>handbag</span>. She's been <span>stealing</span> them!<br/>
🎧 What? The <span>company's</span> <span>pens?Right</span>, well, I need to see you in my <span>office</span> please <span>Rachel</span>, <span>now…if</span> you don't <span>mind</span>.<br/>

🎧 Could I have a <span>word</span> Anna, in my <span>office</span>? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Hello again. I <span>wonder</span> what Paul <span>wants</span> to say to Anna? Could it have something to do with <span>Rachel</span>, the pen <span>thief</span> <span>-</span> or is it just to do with <span>biscuits?</span>! Let's find out. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Have a <span>seat</span>... so well done for <span>speaking</span> to her. <span>Stealing</span> all those <span>pens</span> from the <span>office</span> was the <span>final</span> <span>straw</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 She was <span>stealing</span> <span>straws</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, no. It was the <span>final</span> thing that she did wrong <span>–</span> and it <span>meant</span> <span>disciplinary</span> <span>action</span>. I've had to <span>'let</span> her <span>go'</span> <span>–</span> in other <span>words</span>, <span>sack</span> her. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh, so she's <span>gone</span>. But what is Mr <span>Socrates</span> going to say? She was his best <span>employee</span>.<br/>
🎧 Leave it with me. I'm sure he'll <span>understand…I</span> hope. Now, I wanted to speak to you about your <span>appraisal</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna<br/></span>
🎧 My <span>appraisal</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, we do it every year. It's a <span>chance</span> to talk about you, talk about the <span>highs</span> and <span>lows</span> of the <span>past</span> year and look forward. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Highs</span> and <span>lows</span>? But I haven't been <span>walking</span> up any <span>hills</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 No Anna! He <span>means</span> your <span>appraisal</span> is about <span>reviewing</span> your <span>performance</span> and <span>setting</span> <span>objectives</span> for the year <span>ahead</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 I see. But what are <span>objectives</span>? <span><br/></span>
🎧 These are <span>tasks</span> for you to do, to try and <span>improve</span> your <span>performance</span> and <span>skills</span> and help the <span>business</span>. Here are the <span>questions</span> you're <span>likely</span> to hear in an <span>appraisal:<br/></span>
🎧 What's <span>gone</span> well for you this year?<br/>
🎧 What didn't go so well?<br/>
🎧 What should you do more of?<br/>
🎧 Let's look <span>ahead</span> and set some <span>objectives</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Right. Thanks. So Paul, when shall we have this, <span>err</span>, <span>appraisal</span>?<br/>
🎧 If you've time, we could make a start now? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh OK. So I need to think about my <span>performance</span> first?<br/>
🎧 Exactly. What has <span>gone</span> well for you this year? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Well I <span>guess</span> I've just done my <span>job</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Anna! This is your <span>chance</span> to sell <span>yourself</span>. Think about the <span>deals</span> you've made, the people you've <span>managed</span>, that <span>sort</span> of thing. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Right. Well, I did <span>complete</span> two big <span>contracts</span> for the <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemon<br/></span>...
🎧 You've had <span>plenty</span> of <span>compliments</span> for that. You <span>seem</span> to have a <span>zest</span> for <span>selling</span>! <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Err</span>, <span>right</span>... and then there was <span>dealing</span> with Mr <span>Ingle</span> in the <span>warehouse</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's a good example of <span>dealing</span> with <span>difficult</span> <span>staff</span>. And what didn't go so well? <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Well</span>... <span>erm</span>... working with <span>Rachel</span>... and <span>cold</span> <span>calling</span> I <span>suppose</span>. That <span>wasn't</span> easy.<br/>
🎧 Ah yes. But you soon <span>warmed</span> up! And what should you do more of? <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Err</span>, <span>erm</span>... <span><br/></span>
🎧 It's a <span>tricky</span> <span>question</span> Anna <span>–</span> but don't be <span>ashamed</span> about <span>admitting</span> things that you feel you could <span>improve</span> on. <span>Nobody's</span> <span>perfect</span>! Think about <span>skills</span> you'd like to <span>improve</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh OK. Well Paul, I <span>guess</span> I <span>could</span>... <span>develop</span> some <span>ideas</span> for new <span>products</span>? <span>Continue</span> to work on the <span>European</span> <span>marketing</span> <span>strategy</span>... sell more <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemons</span>... <span>err<br/></span>...
🎧 That's enough Anna! If you do all that, you'll put me out of a <span>job</span>! <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh, I don't want to do that!<br/>
🎧 Now let's look <span>ahead</span> and set some <span>objectives</span>. <span>Biscuit</span>? <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Biscuits</span> as an <span>objective</span>? Oh I <span>see…no</span> thanks.<br/>
🎧 We've all got to <span>improve</span> our <span>sales</span> <span>targets</span> so I'm <span>asking</span> all the <span>team</span> to make an <span>extra</span> ten <span>sales</span> <span>deals</span> this year. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh, ten, <span>that's</span> a lot.<br/>
🎧 It is <span>-</span> but I know you can do it. And you <span>mentioned</span> <span>developing</span> new <span>products</span>, well I'd like you to do just that <span>–</span> but not <span>plastic</span> <span>fruit</span>, I'd like you to <span>develop</span> a <span>plastic</span> <span>vegetable</span>. <span>Potato</span>, <span>carrot</span>, that <span>sort</span> of thing. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Gosh</span>. Well, OK.<br/>
🎧 Oh and one more thing. Could you help Denise <span>sort</span> out the <span>stationery</span> <span>cupboard</span>? It's a right <span>mess</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Err</span>... <span><br/></span>
🎧 That's a lot of <span>objectives</span> for Anna. She's got her work cut out for the next year. <span>Appraisals</span> are a good time to <span>review</span> your work and plan what you are going to do next. Here's a <span>reminder</span> of the kind of <span>questions</span> your <span>manager</span> may ask <span>you:<br/></span>
🎧 What has <span>gone</span> well for you this year? Give me some <span>examples</span>.<br/>
🎧 What didn't go so well?<br/>
🎧 What should you do more of?<br/>
🎧 Let's look <span>ahead</span> and set some <span>objectives</span>.<br/>
🎧 So if you could <span>write</span> up your <span>appraisal</span> and have it back to me by <span>Friday</span>? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Of course Paul. Thanks. See you later.<br/>
🎧 Oh hi Anna. Are you still on for dinner on <span>Friday</span>? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Yes Tom! <span><br/></span>
🎧 What's going <span>on?</span>! <span><br/></span>
🎧 A <span>mouse</span>... a <span>mouse</span>! I've just <span>seen</span> a <span>mouse</span> <span>running</span> out of the <span>stationery</span> <span>office</span>.<br/>
🎧 Was he <span>stealing</span> the <span>pens?</span>! <span><br/></span>
🎧 It's no <span>joke</span>. <span>Quick…there</span> he <span>goes</span>!<br/>
🎧 Leave him to me! <span>Oh</span>... <span>oww</span>! <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Tom</span>... Tom? Are you ok? <span><br/></span>
🎧 Uh oh! <span>What's</span> <span>happened</span> to Tom? Has he <span>broken</span> something? Join us next time to find out. Bye!<br/>
<span><br/></span>
