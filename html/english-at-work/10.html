🎧 <span>Welcome</span> back to English at Work. Last time we <span>heard</span> Anna <span>pitching</span> her new <span>plastic</span> <span>aubergine</span> idea to Paul, in a <span>lift</span>. He was on his way to a <span>biscuit-lovers'</span> <span>convention</span> and didn't have much time. She gave the <span>perfect</span> <span>elevator</span> <span>pitch</span> but it's down to Paul to give her idea the go <span>ahead</span> <span>–</span> the <span>problem</span> is, he <span>seems</span> to have <span>gone</span> <span>missing</span>.<br/>
🎧 Denise, isn't Paul <span>supposed</span> to be here today?<br/>
🎧 Yes. He went to that <span>biscuit-lovers'</span> <span>convention</span> <span>yesterday</span> but he said he'd be back today.<br/>
🎧 Maybe he's <span>eloped</span> with a <span>pack</span> of <span>custard</span> <span>creams</span>, <span>eh?</span>!<br/>
🎧 Very funny Tom. I'll give him a call now <span>…oh</span>, that might be him now. Hello, Tip Top <span>Trading</span>... oh hello Paul, everything OK? <span>...oh</span> no! <span>...oh</span> no!<br/>
🎧 What Denise?<br/>
🎧 He <span>choked</span> on a <span>biscuit</span> at the <span>convention</span> and he's in <span>hospital</span>. <span>(To</span> <span>Paul)</span> Yes Paul, that was <span>Tom</span>... you want to speak to Anna? I'll just get <span>her</span>... get better soon Paul. <span>(To</span> <span>Anna)</span> Anna, Anna, it's Paul on the phone, he <span>wants</span> to speak to you <span>–</span> sounds <span>important</span>.<br/>
🎧 Me? Oh right, can you <span>transfer</span> the call please? Hello Paul, are you OK?<br/>
🎧 Not really. <span>Damn</span> <span>Garibaldi</span> <span>biscuit</span> got <span>wedged</span> in my <span>throat</span>, <span>ended</span> up <span>banging</span> my <span>head</span> on a <span>table</span> trying to get it out.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>dear</span>, so you're not <span>coming</span> to work today?<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>afraid</span> not, I need to <span>rest</span> for a few <span>days</span> so I was <span>wondering</span>, in <span>fact</span> I'm <span>asking</span> you, could you act up?<br/>
🎧 I've told you before Paul, I can't <span>act</span>... or even <span>sing</span>.<br/>
🎧 No, no Anna. Act up, I mean do my <span>job</span> for a bit <span>–</span> be the <span>boss</span> <span>–</span> just for a day or two.<br/>
🎧 <span>Me?</span>! Be the <span>boss?</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Tom/Denise<br/></span>
🎧 <span>What?</span>!<br/>
🎧 It's quite easy really. Just check my <span>diary</span> and you'll see what needs doing. And if you have any <span>problems</span> <span>just</span>... <span>erm</span>... just ask Denise. Thanks Anna.<br/>
🎧 That's great Anna. You've got all the <span>skills</span> to do <span>Paul's</span> <span>job</span> <span>–</span> maybe even more! But you need to take <span>charge</span> and <span>show</span> who's <span>boss</span>!<br/>
🎧 Oh right. But what should I say?<br/>
🎧 Well, don't be too <span>bossy</span>, but you could <span>say:</span> <span>"If</span> <span>anyone</span> has any issues about their work please come and speak to <span>me"</span>, or, <span>"I</span> would like to have a <span>meeting</span> to <span>discuss</span> our <span>work"</span>, or, <span>"If</span> there's anything you want to ask, my <span>door</span> is always <span>open"</span>. That makes you sound like a very <span>approachable</span> <span>boss</span>! Good <span>luck</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Right everyone, as you know Paul has put me in <span>charge</span> for a while.<br/>
🎧 I'm not being funny Anna, but why you? I mean, I've been here the <span>longest</span>.<br/>
🎧 Tom, if you have any issues about your work, please come and speak to me.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>right</span>... I will then.<br/>
🎧 <span>Erm</span>... <span>Anna</span>... <span>congratulations</span> on your <span>promotion</span>. I just <span>wondered</span>, now you're in <span>charge</span>, could I do a little less <span>admin</span> and a bit more <span>selling</span>?<br/>
🎧 Let's see Denise. I'd like to have a <span>meeting</span> soon to <span>discuss</span> all our work, so we can talk about it then. OK?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, thanks Anna.<br/>
🎧 Right then. It's <span>business</span> as <span>usual</span> and if there's anything you want to ask, my <span>door</span> is always open. Right, back to <span>work</span>... and Tom, could I have a <span>word</span> in my <span>office</span> now please?<br/>
🎧 <span>Excellent</span> work Anna. You're <span>sounding</span> like the <span>boss</span> already <span>–</span> just don't start <span>eating</span> <span>biscuits</span>! Being in <span>charge</span> <span>means</span> being <span>firm</span> but <span>fair</span> and <span>keeping</span> your <span>cool</span>. Here's a <span>reminder</span> of some of the <span>phrases</span> Anna <span>used:<br/></span>
🎧 If <span>anyone</span> has any issues about their work please come and speak to me.<br/>
🎧 I would like to have a <span>meeting</span> to <span>discuss</span> our work.<br/>
🎧 If there is anything you want to ask, my <span>door</span> is always open.<br/>
🎧 Take a <span>seat</span> Tom. Could you please <span>close</span> the <span>door</span>?<br/>
🎧 I thought <span>"your</span> <span>door</span> was always <span>open"</span>?<br/>
🎧 Not this time. I need to speak to you about this <span>message</span> in <span>Paul's</span> <span>diary</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh, right, I see. You need my help? What does it say?<br/>
🎧 It's for two <span>days'</span> time and it <span>says</span>, <span>Socrates</span>, <span>IPC</span>, <span>final</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh no, that doesn't sound good.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>dear</span>, what could that mean? Could there be <span>trouble</span> <span>ahead</span>? Join us again soon to find out. Bye.<br/>
<span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>Welcome</span> back to English at Work. Anna is <span>acting</span> up as <span>boss</span> because Paul had an <span>accident</span> with a <span>biscuit</span>! But her and Tom are in a <span>panic</span> after <span>finding</span> a <span>note</span> in <span>Paul's</span> <span>diary</span> that said <span>'Socrates</span>, <span>IPC</span>, <span>final'</span>. Could it mean bad <span>news</span> for Tip Top <span>Trading</span>? <span>Let's</span> find out.<br/>
🎧 It's very <span>odd</span> and it can't be good. But <span>Socrates</span> must mean Mr <span>Socrates</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes <span>–</span> but <span>IPC</span>? What's that mean?<br/>
🎧 Yeah and <span>final</span> sounds <span>very</span>... <span>final</span>. <span>Hmm</span>... I've got it! <span>IPC</span> <span>–</span> it must be <span>code</span> for <span>imminent</span> <span>post</span> <span>closures</span> <span>–</span> they're going to <span>sack</span> us all!<br/>
🎧 <span>Sshh</span>. Keep your <span>voice</span> down. Don't tell everyone. Let's check things out first, don't say anything yet. OK?<br/>
🎧 OK. <span>Mum's</span> the <span>word</span>.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>mum</span> <span>knows?</span>!<br/>
🎧 No, no, no, it's our little <span>secret</span>. See you later.<br/>
🎧 Everything OK Tom?<br/>
🎧 Oh yeah, <span>everything's</span> <span>cool</span>. Actually Denise, it's not. I think we're all going to be <span>sacked</span> <span>tomorrow</span> by Mr <span>Socrates</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>What?</span>! No! I've got a <span>hairdresser's</span> <span>appointment</span> on <span>Saturday</span>, how am I going to pay for it now? What am I going to do? I know, I'll call <span>Marge</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Hey <span>Brian</span>, <span>Pete</span>... we're all going to be <span>sacked</span> <span>tomorrow</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Erm</span>... Anna, you've got a <span>problem</span> <span>brewing</span>.<br/>
🎧 What?<br/>
🎧 <span>Tom's</span> <span>spreading</span> <span>rumours</span> about <span>job</span> <span>cuts</span>. <span>Everyone's</span> <span>starting</span> to <span>panic</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh no! I'd better do something but what shall I say?<br/>
🎧 <span>Call</span> a <span>meeting</span> quickly. Tell the <span>team</span> <span>'there</span> are some <span>rumours</span> going around that are not <span>true'</span>. Say, <span>'I</span> am trying to <span>establish</span> the <span>facts</span> and I will let you know as soon as I have some <span>information'</span>. You could say <span>'I</span> would be <span>grateful</span> if you hear any <span>rumours</span>, not to <span>pass</span> them <span>on'</span>. This can be a <span>tricky</span> <span>situation</span> and you need to <span>handle</span> it well. Good <span>luck</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Gosh</span>. This is <span>hard</span> but here <span>goes</span>. <span>Excuse</span> me, could everyone <span>gather</span> <span>round</span> please.<br/>
🎧 Is this about the <span>sackings</span>?<br/>
🎧 No Denise. Any <span>rumours</span> about <span>sackings</span> are not <span>true</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah that's right. Who told you that Denise?<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmmm<br/></span>...
🎧 Please don't listen to <span>rumours</span>. I am trying to <span>establish</span> the <span>facts</span> and if I get any <span>information</span> I will let you know <span>straight</span> away.<br/>
🎧 But I <span>heard</span> Mr <span>Socrates</span> is <span>coming</span> <span>tomorrow</span>, <span>surely</span> he's going to <span>sack</span> us.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ignore</span> the <span>rumours</span> and please don't <span>pass</span> them on.<br/>
🎧 Anna. Tell them to <span>carry</span> on with their work as <span>normal</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, yes. Could you please just <span>carry</span> on with your work as <span>normal</span>. Thank you.<br/>
🎧 So Anna, how are you going to find out the <span>facts</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm going to have to call Paul <span>–</span> in <span>private</span> Tom <span>–</span> I don't want any more <span>rumours</span> getting out.<br/>
🎧 Oh yeah, absolutely. You need to <span>establish</span> the <span>facts</span> right?<br/>
🎧 Hello, Paul <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh hi Paul. It's Anna. Sorry to <span>bother</span> you. Are you feeling better?<br/>
🎧 Much better thanks but <span>keeping</span> <span>clear</span> of <span>biscuits</span> for a while! <span>Anyway</span>, is everything OK?<br/>
🎧 Not exactly. There are <span>rumours</span> <span>spreading</span> about <span>job</span> <span>cuts</span>. Tom saw a <span>note</span> in your <span>diary</span> for <span>tomorrow</span> that said <span>'Socrates</span>, <span>IPC'</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>. Really? Oh yes. I mean, oh no! It's not <span>job</span> <span>cuts</span> <span>–</span> it's <span>IPC</span> <span>-</span> the <span>International</span> <span>Plastics</span> <span>Conference</span> <span>tomorrow</span>! And Mr <span>Socrates</span> is <span>flying</span> in for it. Oh <span>golly</span> <span>gosh</span>, I'd <span>forgotten</span> about that.<br/>
🎧 I see. And why did you right <span>final</span>?<br/>
🎧 Because there's an <span>award</span> being <span>given</span> for the Best <span>Plastic</span> <span>Innovation</span> <span>–</span> and we're in the <span>final</span> with our <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemon</span>. It was a <span>reminder</span> to me to <span>write</span> an <span>acceptance</span> <span>speech</span>. Oh <span>golly</span> <span>gosh</span>, I haven't <span>written</span> a thing.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>dear</span>. What are we going to do?<br/>
🎧 What are you going to do <span>indeed</span>? But thank <span>goodness</span> those <span>rumours</span> of <span>job</span> <span>cuts</span> are not <span>true</span>. <span>Tomorrow</span> could actually be a good day for Tip Top <span>Trading</span>. Here's a <span>reminder</span> of the <span>phrases</span> Anna used to try and <span>control</span> the <span>spread</span> of some <span>office</span> <span>rumours:<br/></span>
🎧 There are some <span>rumours</span> going around that are not <span>true</span>.<br/>
🎧 Please don't listen to <span>rumours</span>.<br/>
🎧 I am trying to <span>establish</span> the <span>facts</span> and if I get any <span>information</span> I will let you know <span>straight</span> away.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ignore</span> the <span>rumours</span> and please don't <span>pass</span> them on.<br/>
🎧 Please just <span>carry</span> on with your work as <span>normal</span>. Thank you.<br/>
🎧 <span>Tomorrow</span> is going to be an <span>important</span> day at the <span>International</span> <span>Plastics</span> <span>Conference</span>. Mr <span>Socrates</span> will be there and Tip Top <span>Trading</span> could <span>pick</span> up a <span>prestigious</span> <span>prize</span> but <span>who's</span> going to <span>write</span> the <span>acceptance</span> <span>speech</span>?<br/>
🎧 OK Anna, this <span>calls</span> for some <span>urgent</span> <span>action</span>. I want you and Tom to meet me at the <span>Princess</span> <span>Diana</span> <span>Conference</span> <span>Centre</span> <span>tomorrow</span> at <span>9.00</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right. And what about the <span>speech</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I've got quite a lot on my <span>plate</span> so I was <span>wondering</span> if you could give it a <span>go</span>... please?<br/>
🎧 <span>Me?</span>! I've never done it before. What am I going to <span>say?</span>!<br/>
🎧 Don't <span>worry</span> Anna. <span>We're</span> here to help. Join us again soon for some more English at Work. Bye!<br/>

🎧 <span>Welcome</span> back to English at Work. It's the big day of the <span>International</span> <span>Plastics</span> <span>Conference</span> and a good <span>opportunity</span> for the <span>staff</span> at Tip Top <span>Trading</span> to <span>promote</span> its <span>business</span>. But <span>hold</span> on, who's this? It's Mr <span>Socrates</span>, the big <span>boss</span> from <span>America</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hey, you <span>guys</span>, where have you been?<br/>
🎧 Ah, Mr <span>Socrates</span>... nice to see you again. I'd <span>heard</span> you were in <span>town</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hello Mr <span>Socrates</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've been <span>looking</span> for you <span>everywhere</span>. I need to catch up with you and see how <span>business</span> is going.<br/>
🎧 Oh very, very well. We're <span>selling</span> <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemons</span> to <span>France</span> and Anna is <span>developing</span> <span>plastic</span> <span>vegetables</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ah Anna! My <span>favourite</span> girl. Still doing a good <span>job</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm doing my best.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span> she's been doing my <span>job</span> for a few <span>days</span>... had a bit of a <span>biscuit</span> <span>accident<br/></span>...
🎧 Yeah, well that's not <span>hard</span> for you, Paul. Listen, listen I need to talk you <span>-</span> shouldn't the <span>others</span> be doing some <span>networking</span> now?<br/>
🎧 Of course, that's why we're here. Right, Tom, I need you to catch up with some of our <span>existing</span> <span>customers</span> <span>–</span> do some <span>schmoozing</span> <span>–</span> and Anna, could you talk to some <span>potential</span> new <span>customers</span>? I need to speak to Mr <span>Socrates</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right. <span>Erm</span>, <span>networking</span>... what exactly am I <span>supposed</span> to do?<br/>
🎧 <span>Networking</span> is about <span>helping</span> your <span>business</span> through <span>connecting</span> with other people in the <span>industry</span>. It <span>involves</span> <span>meeting</span> people and talking to them, <span>sharing</span> <span>information</span>, <span>hopefully</span> <span>helping</span> each other and <span>ultimately</span>, getting new <span>business</span>.<br/>
🎧 So I have to talk to <span>strangers</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, yes. <span>Introduce</span> <span>yourself</span>, say who you work for. Ask them about their <span>business</span> and what they do. Then <span>explain</span> a bit about what you do and who <span>uses</span> your <span>products</span>. If it's <span>appropriate</span>, say that you may be able to help them. Then see if they would <span>consider</span> <span>buying</span> from you. Just be <span>chatty</span> and <span>friendly</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks. I'll give it a try. <span>Excuse</span> me, hello, I'm Anna. I work as a <span>Sales</span> <span>Executive</span> at Tip Top <span>Trading</span>... and you are?<br/>
🎧 <span>Woman<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Jane</span>. <span>Jane</span> from <span>Nice'n'Cheesy</span>. It's very <span>busy</span> here today isn't it?<br/>
🎧 It is. It's my first time here but it's very <span>exciting</span>. I really didn't know what to <span>wear</span>.<br/>
🎧 Anna! That's <span>chatty</span> and <span>friendly</span>, but let's get down to <span>business</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, of course. So can you tell me about your <span>company</span>, <span>Nice'n'Cheesy</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Woman<br/></span>
🎧 Well, we sell <span>cheese</span> to <span>London's</span> top <span>cheese</span> <span>shops</span> <span>-</span> we like to say we're a <span>wedge</span> <span>above</span> the <span>rest</span> <span>–</span> a <span>wedge</span> of <span>cheese</span>, get <span>it?</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Err</span>, right. Well, can I <span>briefly</span> tell you about what our <span>company</span> does? Our <span>company</span> <span>–</span> Tip Top <span>Trading</span> <span>–</span> makes <span>plastic</span> <span>fruit</span> <span>mainly</span> for the <span>catering</span> and food <span>industry</span>. We're up for an <span>award</span> today for one of our <span>designs</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Woman<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Smashing</span>. That's quite <span>interesting</span> actually. We have an issue with the <span>fresh</span> <span>grapes</span> we <span>provide</span> with our <span>cheeses</span> <span>–</span> they keep going <span>mouldy</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>dear</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Woman<br/></span>
🎧 Yes <span>–</span> <span>sour</span> <span>grapes</span> you could say! A good <span>quality</span> <span>plastic</span> <span>grape</span> would be <span>useful</span> to put with our <span>cheese</span> <span>displays</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, I think we might be able to help you.<br/>
🎧 Yes you can! This is the time to <span>exchange</span> <span>contact</span> <span>details</span> <span>–</span> give her your <span>business</span> <span>card</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, if I could have your <span>contact</span> <span>details</span> I'll <span>send</span> you one of our <span>brochures</span> and then give you a call about <span>prices</span>. And here's my <span>business</span> <span>card</span> should you want to call me.<br/>
🎧 <span>Woman<br/></span>
🎧 That's <span>fantastic</span>. So nice to have <span>met</span> you <span>–</span> and I think what you're <span>wearing</span> for the <span>conference</span> is <span>perfect</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks!<br/>
🎧 <span>Bingo</span>! Looks like Anna has a <span>potential</span> new <span>customer</span>. She was <span>friendly</span> and <span>chatty</span> but <span>kept</span> her <span>mind</span> on <span>business</span>. She used <span>phrases</span> like <span>these:<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Excuse</span> me, hello, I'm Anna. I work as a <span>Sales</span> <span>Executive</span> at Tip Top <span>Trading</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can you tell me about your <span>company</span>?<br/>
🎧 Can I <span>briefly</span> tell you about what our <span>company</span> does?<br/>
🎧 I think we might be able to help you.<br/>
🎧 Here's my <span>business</span> <span>card</span> should you want to call.<br/>
🎧 So, some good work by Anna but there's more <span>networking</span> to be done. A <span>conference</span> is a good place for <span>networking</span> and for <span>catching</span> up with your <span>boss</span>, too. Let's find out how Paul is getting on with Mr <span>Socrates</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a tough <span>economic</span> <span>climate</span> Paul. We're already <span>cutting</span> out <span>cookies</span> in <span>management</span> <span>meetings</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, <span>gosh</span>.<br/>
🎧 And now we're <span>cutting</span> <span>staff</span>. We've already <span>lost</span> <span>Rachel</span> <span>–</span> my <span>favourite</span> <span>Sales</span> <span>Executive</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ah yes, well, she was <span>stealing</span> the <span>pens</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Pens</span> can be <span>replaced</span> but not people like her.<br/>
🎧 <span>Well<br/></span>...
🎧 But now it's time to <span>reduce</span> your <span>team</span> Paul <span>–</span> share the <span>pain</span>.<br/>
🎧 Are you sure?<br/>
🎧 Absolutely. By my <span>calculations</span> you need to be rid of one <span>member</span> of <span>staff</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh</span>... well let's not tell the <span>team</span> until we've had the <span>awards</span> <span>ceremony</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK Paul. But it's in your <span>hands</span> to <span>sort</span> this out.<br/>
🎧 <span>Crumbs</span>!<br/>
🎧 Ah yes, Tip Top <span>Trading</span> could be about to win a <span>prestigious</span> <span>award</span> but how will this bad <span>news</span> go down with the <span>team</span>? And what is Paul going to do? Find out next time on English at Work.<br/>

🎧 <span>Welcome</span> back to English at Work. Paul, Anna and Tom are at an <span>important</span> <span>International</span> <span>Plastics</span> <span>Conference</span>. <span>It's</span> been a <span>busy</span> day of <span>networking</span> but the big <span>boss</span> from <span>America</span>, Mr <span>Socrates</span>, has told Paul some bad <span>news</span>. Before he tells the <span>team</span>, there is an <span>important</span> <span>award</span> to be <span>won</span> <span>–</span> the <span>Plastic</span> <span>Innovation</span> of the Year <span>award</span>. Will Tip Top <span>Trading</span> win it?<br/>
🎧 I hope you've <span>written</span> your <span>acceptance</span> <span>speech</span> Anna.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I'm just doing it now.<br/>
🎧 You've <span>left</span> it a bit <span>late</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've been so <span>busy</span> and now I'm really <span>struggling</span>. I don't know what to <span>write</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, don't <span>forget</span> to say <span>"On</span> <span>behalf</span> of everyone at Tip Top <span>Trading</span>, thank you for our <span>award"</span>. Or, you could say <span>"our</span> <span>company</span> is at the <span>forefront</span> of <span>plastic</span> <span>innovation"</span>. Tell the <span>audience</span> <span>"this</span> <span>award</span> is a <span>real</span> <span>boost</span> for everyone working at the <span>company"</span>. Say that and you'll be fine.<br/>
🎧 <span>…working</span> at the <span>company</span>. Good, got it. Thanks. Oh hi Tom, how have you got on?<br/>
🎧 Great great. I've been <span>hanging</span> out with some of our <span>clients</span> <span>–</span> <span>keeping</span> them <span>sweet</span>, you know what I mean?<br/>
🎧 <span>Err</span>, I don't actually know. But I've had some <span>success</span>. Oh, here comes Paul. Hi Paul.<br/>
🎧 Oh hello. Having a good day?<br/>
🎧 Yes, we're just talking about our <span>success</span> <span>–</span> let's hope we win that <span>Plastic</span> <span>Innovation</span> of the Year <span>award</span>, <span>eh</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>yes</span>... let's hope so. Although that <span>means</span> I've got to read out that <span>speech</span> you <span>wrote</span> for me. <span>Public</span> <span>speaking</span> is not really one of my things.<br/>

🎧 Morning everyone. How did you get on at the <span>conference</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh hi Denise. Yeah it <span>was</span>... it was OK.<br/>
🎧 What do you mean <span>'OK'</span>? It was great. We made some new <span>contacts</span> and we <span>won</span> an <span>award</span> <span>–</span> Best <span>Plastic</span> <span>Innovation</span> of the Year, for our <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemon</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh that's <span>wonderful</span>. Wish I'd been there.<br/>
🎧 Maybe next year <span>eh</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Maybe?Welcome</span> back to the <span>offices</span> of Tip Top <span>Trading</span> where everyone is <span>catching</span> up on <span>yesterday's</span> good <span>news</span>. But today it's bad <span>news</span> that everyone is going to hear <span>following</span> <span>Paul's</span> <span>chat</span> with the big <span>boss</span>, Mr <span>Socrates</span>. But how bad is it? Let's find out. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Morning everyone.<br/>
🎧 Hi Paul. Everything OK?<br/>
🎧 Yes, fine. Well done for <span>winning</span> <span>Employee</span> of the Year <span>–</span> I hope you can <span>continue</span> to be a great <span>employee</span>. <span>Excuse</span> me.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, he <span>sounded</span> <span>odd</span>. What did he mean?<br/>
🎧 Probably run out of <span>biscuits</span>!<br/>
🎧 He's <span>obviously</span> got something on his <span>mind</span>.<br/>
🎧 Denise, could I have a <span>word</span> with you in my <span>office</span> please?<br/>
🎧 Of course. I'll <span>bring</span> my <span>notepad</span> and pen shall I?<br/>
🎧 What's that all about? <span>Anyway</span>, now we're <span>alone</span>, I wanted to see what you're doing <span>tonight</span>... are you free?<br/>
🎧 Sorry Tom, I'm <span>seeing</span> <span>Dave</span> <span>tonight</span>. He's <span>offered</span> to fix something on my <span>computer</span> at home.<br/>
🎧 Oh, has he now?<br/>
🎧 All the years I've <span>worked</span> here <span>–</span> why me? Why now?<br/>
🎧 Denise, what's up?<br/>
🎧 Paul <span>says</span> he needs to move the <span>furniture</span> around and he has to let me go. He <span>says</span> he can't <span>afford</span> me <span>anymore</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>terrible</span>... but where's he <span>letting</span> you go to? And what <span>furniture</span> is he <span>moving</span>?<br/>
🎧 No Anna! If <span>someone</span> <span>says</span> they are <span>'moving</span> the <span>furniture'</span> they really mean they are <span>restructuring</span> or <span>changing</span> the <span>business</span>. And if they say <span>'they</span> have to let you <span>go'</span>, it <span>means</span> they are <span>sacking</span> you or in other <span>words</span>, <span>ending</span> your <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sacking</span> you? Oh, that is <span>serious</span>. Denise, I'm really sorry to hear this. But why does Paul want to <span>'move</span> the <span>furniture'</span> around?<br/>
🎧 He <span>says</span> it's because of the tough <span>economic</span> <span>situation</span>. My <span>role</span> is no <span>longer</span> <span>needed<br/></span>
🎧 Hey, that's not <span>true</span>. You make a great cup of tea Denise. I've got a good <span>mind</span> to <span>smash</span> <span>Paul's</span> <span>bourbons</span> into <span>tiny</span> <span>crumbs</span>. <span>Grrr</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Calm</span> down Tom. Now Denise, when did Paul say you had to go?<br/>
🎧 He's <span>given</span> me <span>seven</span> <span>days'</span> <span>notice</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>'notice</span> <span>period'</span> is an <span>amount</span> of time an <span>employer</span> must give an <span>employee</span> if they plan to <span>terminate</span> their <span>employment</span>.<br/>
🎧 I never thought I would be <span>facing</span> <span>redundancy</span>... not <span>now</span>... not at my age.<br/>
🎧 <span>Redundancy</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, if <span>someone</span> <span>says</span> <span>'they</span> are <span>facing</span> <span>redundancy'</span>, it's another way of saying they are <span>losing</span> their <span>job</span>. <span>Hmm</span>, I think Denise needs a <span>shoulder</span> to cry on.<br/>
🎧 Yes. Denise, do you want my <span>shoulder</span> to cry on?<br/>
🎧 Oh thanks.<br/>
🎧 <span>Urgh</span>! <span>Erm</span>... Denise, I've just made some tea would you like a cup?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes please.<br/>
🎧 Here you go. You know Denise, you've got to think <span>positively</span>. You'll get another <span>job</span>... and let's <span>face</span> it you didn't like working here <span>anyway</span>... you always <span>looked</span> so <span>miserable</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't think <span>Tom's</span> <span>attempts</span> to <span>cheer</span> Denise up are going to work! <span>Losing</span> your <span>job</span> can be a <span>traumatic</span> <span>experience</span>. It can come as a <span>surprise</span> and a <span>shock</span>. Let's hear the <span>phrases</span> Paul used to <span>break</span> the <span>news</span> to <span>Denise:<br/></span>
🎧 We've got to move the <span>furniture</span> around.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>afraid</span> I've got to let you go.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>giving</span> you <span>seven</span> <span>days'</span> <span>notice</span>.<br/>
🎧 And here are some other <span>expressions</span> you may hear in <span>connection</span> with <span>losing</span> your <span>job:<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Facing</span> <span>redundancy<br/></span>
🎧 Getting the <span>sack<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Terminating</span> your <span>employment<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Leaving</span> the <span>company<br/></span>
🎧 Right, well, I might as well start <span>clearing</span> out my <span>desk</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah it's a <span>real</span> <span>shame</span>. Any <span>chance</span> I could have your <span>stapler</span>?<br/>
🎧 Tom, you could be a bit more <span>sympathetic</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh right.<br/>
🎧 Tom, Anna. Could I have a <span>word</span> in my <span>office</span> please?<br/>
🎧 Oh no. This is it. It's my <span>turn</span> to get the <span>chop</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Ha</span>, You might not need my <span>stapler</span> after all!<br/>
🎧 <span>Crikey</span>! Things aren't <span>looking</span> good at Tip Top <span>Trading</span>. Are Tom and Anna getting the <span>chop</span>... I mean, the <span>sack</span>? Join us again next time on English at Work.<br/>
