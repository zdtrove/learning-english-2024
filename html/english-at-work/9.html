🎧 <span>Welcome</span> back to the <span>offices</span> of Tip Top <span>Trading</span> where <span>Tom</span> has taken a <span>tumble</span>. He was trying to catch a <span>mouse</span> but <span>tripped</span> over. Can <span>Anna</span> help <span>soothe</span> the <span>pain</span>? Let's find out. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Ooh…</span> <span>oww…</span> <span>ouch</span>. My <span>arm</span> really <span>hurts</span>.<br/>
🎧 What's all this <span>noise</span> about?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>Tom</span>. He's had an <span>accident</span> <span>–</span> <span>tripped</span> over a <span>mouse</span> <span>–</span> I mean <span>tripped</span> over trying to catch a <span>mouse</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Golly</span> <span>gosh</span>. Are you OK <span>Tom</span>?<br/>
🎧 I <span>dunno</span>. I think I've <span>broken</span> something.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>pencil</span> I think! Just sit there at my <span>desk</span> and I'll go and <span>call</span> a <span>first-aider</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna,you're</span> going to have to <span>fill</span> in one of those <span>Health</span> and <span>Safety</span> <span>reports</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh really? Do we have to?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>procedure</span> and it's the law <span>–</span> it's got to be done. Now <span>Tom</span>, would a <span>biscuit</span> make you feel better?<br/>
🎧 <span>Health</span> and <span>Safety</span> is <span>important</span> in the <span>workplace</span>. The <span>office</span> needs to be a <span>safe</span> place to work in, but <span>accidents</span> do <span>happen</span> and that's when you have to <span>report</span> it. <span>Anna</span>, do you know where to find the <span>form</span> you need to <span>fill</span> in?<br/>
🎧 I think so. It's here on the <span>company</span> <span>intranet…</span> here it is, <span>'accident</span> <span>report</span> <span>form'</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's sometimes <span>called</span> an <span>'incident</span> or <span>accident</span> <span>report</span> <span>form'</span>. It will ask <span>you:</span> How did the <span>accident</span> <span>happen</span>? What was the <span>cause</span> of the <span>accident</span>? Were there any <span>injuries</span>? And how could the <span>accident</span> have been <span>avoided</span>?<br/>
🎧 OK, I had better get <span>started</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, I've <span>call</span> the <span>first-aider</span>. She'll be here in ten <span>minutes</span>. Now, do you need a <span>hand</span> with this <span>form</span>, <span>Anna</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes please <span>Denise</span>. It <span>wants</span> to know how the <span>accident</span> <span>happened</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Just say there was a <span>mouse…</span> no, a <span>large</span> <span>rat…</span> <span>running</span> about that <span>needed</span> <span>catching</span>. And <span>Tom</span>, very <span>bravely</span>, <span>tried</span> to catch <span>it<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Yes…</span> and then he <span>tripped</span> over something.<br/>
🎧 Was it your <span>ego</span> <span>Tom</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Err</span>? <span>Ha</span> <span>ha</span>. <span>Ouch</span>! No, it was a <span>sample</span> box of <span>Perfect</span> <span>Peaches</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, the <span>cause</span> of the <span>accident</span> was a box of <span>Perfect</span> <span>Peaches</span> <span>left</span> on the <span>floor</span>. Who <span>left</span> them there <span>anyway</span>?<br/>
🎧 That might have been me <span>Denise</span>.<br/>
🎧 What do I always say about <span>putting</span> things away? Now <span>Anna</span>, it <span>says</span> here <span>'Were</span> there any <span>injuries?'<br/></span>
🎧 So I'll <span>write</span>, <span>'Yes</span>, a <span>member</span> of <span>staff</span> <span>broke</span> his <span>arm.'<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Sprainedhis</span> <span>arm</span>. I think he'd be in a lot more <span>pain</span> if it was <span>broken</span>, hey <span>Tom</span>?<br/>
🎧 What? <span>Err</span>, yeah. It still <span>hurts</span> though.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>! Now <span>finally</span> it <span>says</span> <span>'What</span> can be done to <span>avoid</span> this <span>accident</span> <span>again?'<br/></span>
🎧 Get rid of the <span>mice…</span> I mean <span>rats</span>?<br/>
🎧 No. <span>Store</span> things away <span>properly</span> and keep the <span>office</span> <span>tidy</span>, <span>eh</span> <span>Tom</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I <span>suppose</span> <span>so…</span> but I was only trying to catch that <span>mouse</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know, very <span>heroic</span>. I'm <span>starting</span> to see what <span>Anna</span> <span>sees</span> in you, you know.<br/>
🎧 Oh no, <span>Anna</span>, our dinner <span>date</span>!<br/>
🎧 So, it's been an <span>eventful</span> day in the <span>office</span>. <span>Anna</span> has done the <span>proper</span> thing by <span>completing</span> an <span>accident</span> <span>report</span> <span>form</span>. If you have to <span>report</span> an <span>accident</span> at work, here are some of the <span>questions</span> you might be <span>asked:<br/></span>
🎧 How did the <span>accident</span> <span>happen</span>?<br/>
🎧 What was the <span>cause</span> of the <span>accident</span>?<br/>
🎧 Were there any <span>injuries</span>? <span>And:<br/></span>
🎧 How could the <span>accident</span> have been <span>avoided</span>?<br/>
🎧 So <span>luckily</span> for <span>Anna</span> she might get out of that <span>date</span> with <span>Tom</span>!<br/>
🎧 Hey <span>Tom</span>, don't look so <span>glum</span>. I'm up for dinner if you still are?<br/>
🎧 <span>Ouch…</span> really?<br/>
🎧 Sure <span>Tom</span>, and as you've only got one <span>arm</span> now, you won't be <span>hugging</span> me all the time.<br/>
🎧 You'll have to <span>spoon</span> <span>feed</span> him his food too!<br/>
🎧 <span>Denise</span>, could you go and <span>call</span> <span>pest</span> <span>control</span> please?<br/>
🎧 <span>Careful</span> what you say <span>Denise</span>, or you may get <span>injured</span> too! So it looks <span>Anna</span> and <span>Tom's</span> dinner <span>date</span> is on <span>–</span> I can't wait to be a <span>fly-on-the-wall</span>! See you again soon. <span>Bye</span>!<br/>
<span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>Waiter<br/></span>
🎧 Would you like to see the <span>menu</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes please.<br/>
🎧 <span>Waiter<br/></span>
🎧 I was <span>asking</span> the <span>lady</span> <span>actually</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, right. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Hello</span> again. <span>Anna</span> and <span>Tom</span> are <span>finally</span> on their dinner <span>date</span> at a <span>pizza</span> <span>restaurant</span>. <span>Eating</span> could be <span>difficult</span> for <span>Tom</span> because he's <span>sprained</span> his <span>arm</span> after that <span>accident</span> in the <span>office</span>. He might still have <span>romance</span> on his <span>mind</span> but <span>Anna</span> is thinking about something else. Are you feeling <span>nervous</span> <span>Anna</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Nervous</span>? Why?<br/>
🎧 Being out on your own with <span>Tom</span>. What are you going to talk about?<br/>
🎧 Don't <span>worry</span>. I can <span>handle</span> this, <span>besides</span> I want <span>Tom's</span> <span>ideas</span> about <span>developing</span> a new <span>plastic</span> <span>vegetable</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>plastic</span> <span>vegetable</span>! Oh right. Well, good <span>luck</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, this is nice. <span>Finally</span>, us together, on our own, me and you, <span>pizza</span>, red <span>wine…</span> <span>expensive</span> red <span>wine</span>, <span>actually</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Lovely</span>, <span>Tom</span>. You know <span>Tom</span>, <span>Paul</span> <span>wants</span> me to <span>develop</span> a new idea <span>–</span> <span>plastic</span> <span>vegetables</span> <span>–</span> I thought, maybe, you might like to help me?<br/>
🎧 Come on <span>Anna</span>, we're not here to talk <span>business</span>. Tell me about you <span>–</span> the <span>real</span> <span>Anna</span>. Have you had <span>many…</span> <span>err</span>, many <span>boyfriends</span> before?<br/>
🎧 That's a bit <span>personal</span>. What do you think about <span>plastic</span> <span>peas</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Err</span>? Can you not <span>switch</span> off from work for one <span>minute</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Tom</span>. I think you and me are very <span>similar</span> <span>–</span> we're a good <span>team</span>. If we could come up with a great idea for <span>Paul</span> then who <span>knows…</span> we may get to travel the <span>world</span> <span>selling</span> it together?<br/>
🎧 Oh, I see. I hadn't thought of it like that. Right <span>well…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Waiter<br/></span>
🎧 Your <span>pizzas…</span> <span>madam…</span> sir.<br/>
🎧 Thanks. <span>Tom</span>, I think you'll need some help <span>cutting</span> that.<br/>
🎧 Thanks. <span>Mmm</span>, you <span>smell</span> <span>nice…</span> or is that the <span>pizza</span>?<br/>
🎧 I've got it!<br/>
🎧 What?<br/>
🎧 <span>Plastic</span> <span>aubergines</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Plastic</span> <span>aubergines</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes. <span>Plastic</span> <span>aubergines</span>. They would look great on this <span>table</span> <span>–</span> a <span>sort</span> of <span>decoration</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah! And you could put <span>sauces</span> <span>inside…</span> or <span>salt</span> and <span>pepper</span>. You could be on to something here.<br/>
🎧 We need to put a <span>proposal</span> together, to give it to <span>Paul</span>. But what should we say?<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna</span>, your <span>proposal</span> needs to be <span>brief</span> but <span>clear</span>. Use <span>positive</span> <span>language</span> to <span>propose</span> your idea to <span>Paul</span>. Use <span>words</span> like <span>'exceptional'</span>, <span>'fantastic'</span>, <span>'quality'</span>, and talk about how it would <span>benefit</span> the <span>business</span> by <span>using</span> <span>words</span> like <span>'profit'</span>, <span>'efficiency'</span>, and <span>'value</span> for <span>money'</span>. Good <span>luck</span>!<br/>
🎧 Are you OK <span>Anna</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes. Just <span>writing</span> some things down.<br/>
🎧 OK, well <span>write</span> down how we could <span>target</span> <span>restaurants</span> and <span>cafes</span>. They'll be <span>begging</span> for our <span>vegetables</span>. Oh this is so <span>exciting…</span> let's <span>drink</span> to <span>our…</span> <span>succ…</span> Oh!<br/>
🎧 <span>Tom</span>! What have you done? You've <span>knocked</span> red <span>wine</span> all over <span>me…</span> and my <span>notebook</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ermm</span>, <span>sorry</span>. We had better get you out of that <span>dress</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, what a <span>mess</span> and what a <span>date</span>! But what may be <span>lacking</span> in <span>romance</span> is made up for in a <span>potentially</span> <span>successful</span> <span>business</span> <span>deal</span>. Let's find out how it's going much much later at <span>Tom's</span> <span>flat…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>…this</span> <span>exceptional</span> <span>product</span> has <span>fantastic</span> <span>potential…<br/></span>
🎧 Say <span>'demand</span> for this <span>plastic</span> <span>aubergine</span> will <span>reach</span> <span>melting</span> <span>point!'</span> My little <span>joke</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>…by</span> <span>making</span> the <span>production</span> more <span>efficient</span>, our <span>customers</span> will get <span>value</span> for money and our <span>profits</span> will <span>increase</span>. There, done.<br/>
🎧 Great. We can <span>pitch</span> this to <span>Paul</span> first thing on <span>Monday</span> morning. So now, maybe we can get back to our <span>date</span>? Look I <span>saved</span> some of that <span>pizza</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's all <span>cold</span>! <span>Anyway</span>, I had better go. It's <span>late</span> and I want to <span>tidy</span> up this <span>proposal</span>. But it's been great. I can't wait <span>till</span> next time.<br/>
🎧 <span>Bbbut…Next</span> time?<br/>
🎧 Well, that went well! The <span>pizza</span> may be <span>cold</span> but <span>Anna</span> and <span>Tom</span> have <span>developed</span> a red hot <span>proposal</span>. Here's a <span>reminder</span> of some of the <span>words</span> you might want to use to make your <span>business</span> <span>proposal</span> <span>stand</span> <span>out…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Exceptional</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Fantastic</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Quality</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Profit</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Efficiency</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Value</span> for money.<br/>
🎧 So with the <span>proposal</span> <span>written</span>, <span>Tom</span> and <span>Anna</span> just need to <span>convince</span> <span>Paul</span> <span>–</span> and that <span>means</span> <span>pitching</span> their idea. Find out how they get on next time. <span>Bye</span> for now.<br/>

🎧 <span>Hello</span> again. Last time on English at Work, we <span>heard</span> <span>Anna</span> <span>leaving</span> <span>Tom</span> <span>crying</span> into his <span>cold</span> <span>pizza</span>. He may not have had the <span>evening</span> he was <span>expecting</span>, but for <span>Anna</span> it was a <span>huge</span> <span>success</span>. She came up with an idea for a new <span>plastic</span> <span>vegetable</span> and now she needs to <span>pitch</span> it to <span>Paul</span>, the <span>boss</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>…</span> so I think I'll go for the <span>blue</span>, <span>Marge</span>, it <span>matches</span> my <span>eyes…</span> well <span>almost…<br/></span>
🎧 Morning <span>Denise</span>!<br/>
🎧 Oh, <span>hello</span> <span>Anna</span> <span>…yes</span>, <span>Anna</span>, <span>bright</span> girl, what she <span>sees</span> in <span>Tom</span> I'll never <span>know…</span> <span>what?!..</span>. <span>ha</span>, <span>ha</span>, I'm sure you <span>would…<br/></span>
🎧 Oh hi <span>Tom</span>. You're in <span>early</span>.<br/>
🎧 Uh? Oh yeah, couldn't <span>sleep</span> after you'd <span>left</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Tom</span>, it was a <span>fantastic</span> <span>night</span> <span>–</span> <span>unforgettable</span> in <span>fact</span>. Thanks so much.<br/>
🎧 Did you hear that <span>Marge</span>? She said it was <span>'unforgettable'</span>! Looks like they're getting very <span>serious…<br/></span>
🎧 You're such a <span>gossip</span>, <span>Denise</span>. The only thing <span>Anna</span> is <span>serious</span> about is her new idea. How's it going <span>Anna</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm really <span>excited</span> about <span>launching</span> a new <span>product</span>, <span>although</span> <span>Tom</span> doesn't <span>seem</span> so <span>keen</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Don't <span>worry</span> about him. You need to <span>concentrate</span> on <span>convincing</span> <span>Paul</span> that your new idea will <span>bring</span> in the <span>business</span>.<br/>
🎧 But how?<br/>
🎧 You need to <span>pitch</span> the idea to him but before that, you need to do some <span>research</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, of course <span>–</span> <span>research</span> <span>–</span> but how do I do that?<br/>
🎧 Check out the <span>competition</span>, work out some <span>costs</span> and find out what new <span>product</span> people would really like to see. Why not do a <span>customer</span> <span>survey?</span>!<br/>
🎧 A <span>customer</span> <span>survey</span>. Right. But what should I ask?<br/>
🎧 <span>Say:</span> <span>'Could</span> I ask for your <span>opinion</span> on a new <span>product</span> we are <span>hoping</span> to <span>develop?'</span> <span>'What</span> <span>plastic</span> <span>products</span> do you <span>currently</span> <span>use?'</span>, <span>'What</span> <span>products</span> would you like us to make in the <span>future?'</span>, <span>'How</span> do you feel about the idea of <span>selling</span> <span>plastic</span> <span>vegetables?'</span>, <span>'Any</span> <span>particular</span> <span>vegetable</span> you would like to <span>see?'<br/></span>
🎧 OK, so it's like a <span>questionnaire</span>. I need to do some <span>cold</span> <span>calling</span> again!<br/>
🎧 Good <span>luck</span>!<br/>
🎧 I think I'm going to need some help with this. <span>Tom</span>, <span>Denise</span>, have you got time to help <span>me…</span> please?<br/>
🎧 Of course <span>Anna</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, well it's a bit <span>tricky</span> with <span>my…</span> <span>ouch…</span> <span>sprained</span> <span>arm</span>. But go on. As it's you.<br/>
🎧 Thanks. We need to <span>call</span> up some <span>companies</span> and find out how <span>interested</span> they would be in <span>buying</span> <span>plastic</span> <span>vegetables</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>lovely</span>. I love talking to people on the phone.<br/>
🎧 You <span>certainly</span> do <span>Denise</span>!<br/>
🎧 Good <span>Denise</span>. If you work your way through our <span>business</span> <span>directory</span>, <span>call</span> our <span>existing</span> <span>customers</span> and ask these <span>questions</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll get <span>onto</span> it <span>straight</span> away.<br/>
🎧 Great, and <span>Tom</span>, could you help me by <span>cold</span> <span>calling</span> some new <span>businesses</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh yeah sure. I've got <span>loads</span> of <span>contacts</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> I had better make some <span>calls</span> too. <span>Hmm</span>, let's try this one. <span>7-4-3-9-1-0-0<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Man<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Hello</span>. <span>Plastic</span> <span>Purr-fection</span>. Can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Oh hi. I'm <span>Anna</span> from Tip Top <span>Trading</span>, we make and sell <span>plastic</span> <span>fruits</span>. I'm trying some to get some <span>opinions</span> on a new <span>product</span> we're trying to <span>develop</span>. Can you <span>spare</span> a few <span>minutes</span> to help me?<br/>
🎧 <span>Man<br/></span>
🎧 Well I'm quite <span>busy</span> at the <span>moment</span> but I'll try and help.<br/>
🎧 Thank you. I'll be as <span>quick</span> as I can. <span>Firstly</span>, what <span>plastic</span> <span>products</span> do you use at the <span>moment</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Man<br/></span>
🎧 All <span>sorts</span> <span>–</span> <span>plastic</span> <span>balls</span>, <span>plastic</span> <span>fish</span>, <span>plastic</span> <span>mice…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Plastic</span> <span>mice?</span>! Oh, I see. <span>And…</span> <span>errr…</span> what <span>sort</span> of things would you like us to <span>sell…</span> in the future?<br/>
🎧 <span>Man<br/></span>
🎧 Let's <span>think…</span> <span>erm</span> <span>…</span> more <span>squeaky</span> <span>toys</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Squeaky</span> <span>toys?</span>! What about <span>plastic</span> <span>vegetables</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Man<br/></span>
🎧 Do they <span>squeak</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Err</span>, not really. I think there might be some <span>confusion</span> here. Do you use <span>plastic</span> <span>fruits</span> in <span>restaurants</span> and <span>shops</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Man<br/></span>
🎧 No. We just sell <span>plastic</span> <span>toys…</span> for <span>cats</span>, <span>hence</span> the name <span>'plastic</span> <span>purr-fection'</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh I see, <span>ha</span>, <span>ha</span>. A good name, but, I'm <span>sorry</span> you're not really the <span>business</span> I was <span>looking</span> for. Thanks for your time <span>anyway</span>. <span>Bye</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Man<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Bye</span>. Get down <span>Tiddles</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Uh-oh</span> <span>Anna</span>. It's a good idea to check exactly what <span>type</span> of <span>business</span> you are <span>calling</span> before <span>carrying</span> out your <span>survey</span>. Better <span>luck</span> next time! If you're doing some <span>research</span> and want to get the <span>opinions</span> of your <span>customers</span>, here's a <span>reminder</span> of the <span>questions</span> you could <span>ask:<br/></span>
🎧 Could I ask for your <span>opinion</span> on a new <span>product</span> we are <span>hoping</span> to <span>develop</span>?<br/>
🎧 What <span>plastic</span> <span>products</span> do you <span>currently</span> use?<br/>
🎧 What <span>products</span> would you like to see us sell in the future?<br/>
🎧 How do you feel about the idea of <span>selling</span> <span>plastic</span> <span>vegetables</span>?<br/>
🎧 Any <span>particular</span> <span>vegetable</span> you would like to see?<br/>
🎧 Let's find out how the <span>team</span> is getting on.<br/>

I <span>called</span> <span>10</span> <span>companies</span>, <span>asked</span> them your <span>questions</span> <span>–</span> one man <span>asked</span> me out for dinner <span>–</span> <span>anyway</span>, I've <span>created</span> a <span>database</span> and put all the <span>information</span> there.<br/>
🎧 Well I've <span>called</span> <span>20</span> <span>companies</span> and they all say <span>plastic</span> <span>vegetables</span> would be a great <span>addition</span> to their <span>range…</span> <span>especially</span> <span>aubergines</span>!<br/>
🎧 Great. Well, I had some <span>success</span> too so I'll put all the <span>results</span> in that <span>database</span>. Thanks everyone. Oh <span>no…</span> what's <span>happened</span>? <span>Denise</span>! <span>Denise</span>! <span>Everything's</span> <span>disappeared</span> off the <span>computer</span>!<br/>
🎧 Hey, my <span>computer's</span> <span>gone</span> <span>blank</span>. We've <span>lost</span> all our <span>documents</span>!<br/>

🎧 It's <span>frozen</span>. <span>Nothing</span> will <span>work…<br/></span>
🎧 Yeah and all my <span>football</span> <span>scores…</span> I mean <span>company</span> <span>accounts…</span> have <span>disappeared</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can <span>anyone</span> get their <span>computers</span> to work? Or is just me?<br/>
🎧 <span>Welcome</span> back to the <span>offices</span> of Tip Top <span>Trading</span> where, as you can hear, there <span>appears</span> to be a bit of <span>computer</span> <span>trouble</span>. <span>Everyone's</span> work <span>seems</span> to have <span>disappeared</span>. This is <span>serious</span> so who can <span>sort</span> it out?<br/>
🎧 Leave it to me. I'll <span>sort</span> it out. You just need to <span>switch</span> it <span>off…</span> and on again <span>…</span> like that.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hold</span> on, let's <span>check…</span> <span>Denise</span>! All my <span>documents</span> have <span>gone</span> now!<br/>
🎧 Oh, <span>sorry</span>, I was just trying to help. You'll just have to <span>call</span> <span>I.T</span>. <span>Support</span>, look, <span>here’s</span> their <span>number</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>'It'</span> <span>Support</span>?<br/>
🎧 No <span>Anna</span> not <span>'it'</span> but <span>I.T</span>. <span>Support</span> <span>–</span> <span>information</span> <span>technology</span> <span>–</span> sometimes <span>called</span> <span>Computer</span> <span>Support</span>. Most big <span>companies</span> have them. These are the people who <span>sort</span> out your <span>computer</span> <span>problems</span> and get everything working again. But be <span>careful</span>, they might ask some <span>tricky</span> <span>questions</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, thanks. But what should I say to them?<br/>
🎧 Tell <span>them:</span> <span>"I</span> am having <span>problems</span> with my <span>computer"</span>, then say <span>"the</span> <span>screen</span> <span>keeps</span> <span>freezing"</span> and <span>"I</span> <span>seem</span> to have <span>lost</span> some <span>documents"</span>. Tell them <span>"I</span> have <span>turned</span> the <span>computer</span> off and on but that hasn't <span>fixed</span> <span>it"</span>. <span>Finally</span>, ask if they can help <span>–</span> please!<br/>
🎧 Well, I'll give it a try. Here <span>goes</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>I.T</span>. <span>Man<br/></span>
🎧 <span>I.T.</span>, <span>Dave</span> <span>speaking</span>, how can I help?<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>hello</span> <span>Dave</span> <span>–</span> I'm having some <span>computer</span> <span>problems</span> <span>–</span> in <span>fact</span> everyone is here.<br/>
🎧 <span>I.T</span>. <span>Man<br/></span>
🎧 Right. What <span>system</span> are you <span>using</span>?<br/>
🎧 What <span>system</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>I.T</span>. <span>Man<br/></span>
🎧 Yeah, what are you <span>using</span>? <span>PC</span>, <span>laptop</span>, <span>Windows</span> <span>XP</span>?<br/>
🎧 Tell him it's <span>Windows</span> <span>7</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Erm…</span> it's <span>Windows</span> <span>7</span> on a <span>PC</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>I.T</span>. <span>Man<br/></span>
🎧 Good, good, this should be easy. Were you <span>using</span> many <span>applications</span> when it <span>crashed</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Applications</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>I.T</span>. <span>Man<br/></span>
🎧 Did you have <span>lots</span> of things open <span>–</span> <span>documents</span>, <span>spreadsheets</span>, <span>videos</span>, other <span>software</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I <span>suppose</span> I did.<br/>
🎧 <span>I.T</span>. <span>Man<br/></span>
🎧 Right, <span>well…</span> <span>Anna</span> isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 <span>I.T</span>. <span>Man<br/></span>
🎧 Right, well <span>Anna</span>, try <span>pressing</span> <span>control</span>, <span>alt</span>, <span>delete</span>, at the same time <span>–</span> after that try <span>opening</span> <span>Windows</span> again.<br/>
🎧 OK. <span>Tom</span>, could you open the <span>windows</span> please.<br/>
🎧 What <span>eh</span>? The <span>windows?</span>!<br/>
🎧 Yes. <span>Dave</span> <span>says</span> so.<br/>
🎧 <span>I.T</span>. <span>Man<br/></span>
🎧 No, no, no. Open <span>Windows</span> <span>7</span> on your <span>computer</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, <span>silly</span> me! No, the <span>screen</span> just <span>freezes</span>. I'm a bit <span>worried</span> because I think I've <span>lost</span> some <span>documents</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>I.T</span>. <span>Man<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Hmmm</span>. In that case the only thing to do is <span>reboot</span> it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Reboot</span> <span>it?You</span> mean <span>kick</span> <span>it?</span>!<br/>
🎧 No! <span>Reboot</span> <span>means</span> <span>turn</span> it on and off again.<br/>
🎧 Oh I see. No <span>Dave</span>, I have already <span>tried</span> <span>turning</span> it off and on again but that hasn't <span>fixed</span> it. What am I going to do?<br/>
🎧 <span>I.T</span>. <span>Man<br/></span>
🎧 Don't <span>panic</span>! I'll come and have a look. You're on the <span>2nd</span> <span>floor</span> right?<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>dear</span>. This is a bit <span>worrying</span> but I'm sure <span>Dave</span>, the IT man, will get things <span>sorted</span>. <span>Remember</span> if you have <span>important</span> <span>documents</span>, it's best to back them up on a <span>memory</span> <span>stick</span> just in case you have a <span>problem</span> like this. Let's <span>remind</span> <span>ourselves</span> of the <span>phrases</span> we might use if we have to <span>call</span> <span>computer</span> <span>support:</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 I am having <span>problems</span> with my <span>computer<br/></span>
🎧 The <span>screen</span> <span>keeps</span> <span>freezing<br/></span>
🎧 I <span>seem</span> to have <span>lost</span> some <span>documents<br/></span>
🎧 I have <span>turned</span> the <span>computer</span> off and on but that hasn't <span>fixed</span> <span>it<br/></span>
🎧 Can you help, please?<br/>
🎧 <span>I.T</span>. <span>Man<br/></span>
🎧 Oh hi. Is <span>Anna</span> here? <span><br/></span>
🎧 She's over there.<br/>
🎧 So <span>Anna</span>, I'm just going to <span>unplug</span> the <span>screen</span> and put the <span>wire</span> back in <span>here…<br/></span>
🎧 OK <span>Tom</span> but are you OK down there? <span>Mind</span> your <span>head</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>I.T</span>. <span>Man<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Excuse</span> me, are you <span>Anna</span>? I've come to fix your <span>computer</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, <span>hello…</span> you must <span>be…</span> <span>Dave</span>. I really like your <span>hair</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ow</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>I.T</span>. <span>Man<br/></span>
🎧 Thanks. You look rather <span>lovely</span>. I'd better take a look at your <span>computer</span>.<br/>
🎧 Don't <span>worry</span> <span>guys</span>, <span>it’s</span> OK, I think I've <span>fixed</span> it!<br/>
🎧 Looks like <span>Tom</span> has a <span>rival</span>. Is <span>Anna</span> going to <span>fall</span> for the <span>charms</span> of <span>Dave</span>, the <span>I.T</span>. man, or is he just going to <span>upgrade</span> her <span>software</span>? This could get very <span>interesting</span> <span>–</span> but there's still work to be done <span>–</span> so join us again soon for English at Work. <span>Bye</span>. <span><br/>

🎧 <span>Hello</span> and <span>welcome</span> to English at Work. The <span>company's</span> <span>computer</span> <span>system</span> has been <span>fixed</span> and <span>Anna</span> <span>seems</span> to have <span>found</span> a new friend in <span>Dave</span>, the IT <span>support</span> man. But her <span>main</span> <span>concern</span> now is <span>pitching</span> her new idea for a <span>plastic</span> <span>aubergine</span>, to <span>Paul</span> the <span>boss</span>.<br/>
🎧 So <span>Anna</span>, that guy didn't really know what he was doing did he?<br/>
🎧 You mean <span>Dave</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Dave</span> <span>–</span> was that his name? He had a really bad <span>smell</span>.<br/>
🎧 No he didn't. He's done a great <span>job</span>. Look everything is working so, if you don't <span>mind</span>, I think we should get this <span>pitch</span> for <span>Paul</span> <span>finished</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'd better <span>hurry</span> up. <span>Paul's</span> taking the <span>afternoon</span> off to go to his <span>biscuit</span> <span>lovers’</span> <span>convention</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh right. Well, we might as well leave it <span>until</span> <span>tomorrow</span> then <span>Anna</span>.<br/>
🎧 No <span>Tom</span>. <span>There’s</span> no time like the <span>present</span> <span>–</span> I <span>heard</span> <span>someone</span> say that once <span>–</span> we've got to get our idea to <span>Paul</span> as soon as <span>possible</span>. Then we might have time for a <span>drink</span>, or <span>shall</span> I ask <span>Dave?</span>!<br/>
🎧 No, no, you're right. Look, I'll <span>design</span> some <span>pictures</span> of the <span>aubergine</span> and you get the <span>results</span> of our <span>survey</span> together, yeah?<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 Well done <span>Anna</span>. <span>Remember</span> to make your <span>pitch</span> <span>clear</span> and <span>exciting</span>. Really sell it with <span>words</span> like <span>'exceptional!'</span>, <span>'fantastic!'</span>, <span>'quality'</span>, <span>'profit'</span>, <span>'efficiency'</span>, and <span>'value</span> for <span>money'</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, I've got all that. I'm just <span>adding</span> some of the <span>facts</span> and <span>figures</span> from our <span>customer</span> <span>survey</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna</span>, I've got the <span>designs</span>, they're <span>coming</span> off the <span>printer</span> now.<br/>
🎧 <span>Denise</span>, <span>I’m</span> off now. <span>Can’t</span> wait any <span>longer</span> for my <span>garibaldis</span>!<br/>
🎧 Wait <span>Paul</span>! I need to tell you about our new <span>product</span> idea.<br/>
🎧 Well, I, I, have to go. Can you tell me about it in the <span>lift</span>?<br/>
🎧 In the <span>lift</span>? Do I have to?<br/>
🎧 <span>Sorry</span> <span>Anna</span>, but that's the only time <span>I’ve</span> got.<br/>
🎧 Right <span>Anna</span>. It's time for your <span>'elevator</span> <span>pitch'</span> <span>–</span> an <span>elevator</span> is an <span>American</span> <span>word</span> for <span>lift</span>. <span>You’ll</span> need to <span>pitch</span> your idea quickly and <span>concisely</span>. You need to tell <span>Paul</span> what the <span>product</span> is and who your <span>market</span> is. Then talk about how you hope it will make money for the <span>company</span>. Talk about the <span>evidence</span> you have that it will be <span>successful</span> and <span>convince</span> him it will really <span>benefit</span> the <span>business</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Phew</span>, there's a lot to say in a short time but here <span>goes</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna</span>, could you just <span>press</span> the <span>0</span> <span>button</span> there, thanks.<br/>
🎧 Now <span>Paul</span>. <span>Tom</span> and I have come up with a new <span>exciting</span> <span>product</span> <span>–</span> the <span>plastic</span> <span>aubergine</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes?<br/>
🎧 Yes. This <span>fantastic</span> <span>product</span> will be a great <span>addition</span> to <span>table</span> <span>decorations</span> in the <span>café</span> and <span>restaurant</span> <span>market</span>.<br/>
🎧 Will it now? Do you really think it will be a <span>profitable</span> <span>addition</span> to our <span>plastic</span> <span>portfolio</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes. <span>Using</span> the same <span>plastics</span> as our <span>fruits</span>, we can <span>easily</span> <span>re-mould</span> our <span>bananas</span> and change the <span>colour</span>. We can <span>increase</span> <span>efficiency</span> but <span>maintain</span> <span>quality</span>.<br/>
🎧 And <span>profits</span>?<br/>
🎧 By my <span>calculations</span>, we can <span>increase</span> <span>profits</span> by <span>20%</span>. That's <span>based</span> on <span>selling</span> the same <span>quantity</span> that we now sell of <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemons</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, <span>20%</span>, really? But do you know <span>who’s</span> going to buy this <span>product</span>?<br/>
🎧 I do. We've <span>conducted</span> a <span>survey</span> and already <span>found</span> <span>10</span> new <span>companies</span> who would buy this and <span>27</span> <span>existing</span> <span>customers</span> who have <span>shown</span> an <span>interest</span> in <span>it…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>…and</span> I'm <span>confident</span> this new <span>product</span> will be a <span>huge</span> <span>success</span>.<br/>
🎧 Very <span>impressive</span>. You've <span>certainly</span> done your <span>homework</span>. Look, let me <span>chew</span> it over <span>–</span> probably on a <span>custard</span> <span>cream</span> <span>–</span> and I'll get back to you.<br/>
🎧 Thanks. <span>Paul</span>, <span>Paul…</span> you've <span>forgotten</span> your bag.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, I'll need that. Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Great work <span>Anna</span>! You <span>convinced</span> me but have you <span>convinced</span> <span>Paul</span>?<br/>
🎧 So <span>Anna's</span> done her first <span>'elevator</span> <span>pitch'</span> and <span>kept</span> to the <span>facts</span>. Here's a <span>reminder</span> of some of the things she <span>said:<br/></span>
🎧 We've come up with an <span>exciting</span> new <span>product</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>fantastic</span> <span>product</span> will be a great <span>addition</span> to <span>table</span> <span>decorations</span> in the <span>café</span> and <span>restaurant</span> <span>market</span>.<br/>
🎧 We can <span>increase</span> <span>efficiency</span> but <span>maintain</span> <span>quality</span>.<br/>
🎧 By my <span>calculations</span>, we can <span>increase</span> <span>profits</span> by <span>20%</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>confident</span> this new <span>product</span> will be a <span>huge</span> <span>success</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, how did it go <span>Anna</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm not sure. I told <span>Paul</span> as much as I could and I think he <span>listened</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good, good. So, what are you doing now?<br/>
🎧 I've got to meet <span>someone</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyone</span> I know?<br/>
🎧 No, not really.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>Dave</span> from IT isn't it? What does she see in him?<br/>
🎧 Do you want me to <span>answer</span> that <span>Tom?</span>! <span>Anna</span> may have <span>fallen</span> for the <span>charms</span> of <span>Dave</span> but let's hope she <span>keeps</span> her <span>mind</span> on her <span>plastic</span> <span>aubergines</span>. Join us again next time on English at Work. <span><br/>
