🎧 Hold tight please! This is Anna, on a bus going to an interview for a job as a sales executive at Tip Top Trading – one of London's fastest growing companies. How are you feeling Anna?<br/>
🎧 Oh, a little nervous but I really want this job.<br/>
🎧 Well don't worry Anna, as long as you say the right things, you'll be fine.<br/>
🎧 The right things!? Like what?<br/>
🎧 You need to sell yourself, be confident, not arrogant and give examples. Like: A good example that comes to mind. I'm particularly proud of. Timekeeping is important to me.<br/>
🎧 Oh right. Thanks. Perhaps you can come with me?<br/>
🎧 Sorry Anna, you're on your own now – but we'll be listening in. Look! You've just arrived. Good luck!<br/>
🎧 Come in. Hello, I'm Paul, the Manager of Tip Top Trading. And you must be….?<br/>
🎧 It's Anna.<br/>
🎧 Yes, very good. Thanks for coming. Now somewhere in this pile, I've got your CV<br/>...
🎧 Err, is that it there?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, thanks Hannah. Your qualifications look impressive but what sales experience can you bring to our company?<br/>
🎧 I worked in a shop once.<br/>
🎧 Ohhh Anna! Sell yourself. Give a good example!<br/>
🎧 Oh right…mmm….well a good example that comes to mind is when I was involved with a campaign to promote and sell a new range of clothes – I loved doing it and it was<br/>...
🎧 Oh sorry, excuse me, here's your tea Paul.: Thanks Denise. Now Anna, it looks like you've achieved a lot during your time at university. Could you give me an example of good team working during your time there?<br/>
🎧 Sorry! I forgot the sugar.<br/>
🎧 Thank you Denise.<br/>
🎧 Hmm, so you want an example? I was the treasurer of the debating society at university. That was OK I suppose.<br/>
🎧 Come on Anna. Be more enthusiastic – the debating society is exciting!<br/>
🎧 I mean... I'm particularly proud of how I organised the finances for the debating society. We had a very small budget and I had to make decisions on what to buy.<br/>
🎧 I like it! "I'm particularly proud of" - Positive but not boasting. You're doing well.<br/>
🎧 Very impressive – so you're a good planner Anna! We like organised people here... ooops, silly me. I seemed to have spilt tea over your CV.<br/>
🎧 Oh, do you need some help?<br/>
🎧 Oh no…I'm sure it'll dry out... carry on please<br/>...
🎧 Also... timekeeping is important to me<br/>...
🎧 "Timekeeping is important to me" – that's good!<br/>
🎧 I always try to complete my work on time. At university I never handed my assignments in late.<br/>
🎧 That's good to hear. We like punctuality here<br/>...
🎧 Excuse me Paul. Sorry it's a bit late – but I thought you might like a biscuit with your tea.<br/>
🎧 Hmm thanks….oh lovely, custard creams... mmm. Now Hannah, finally I wanted to ask you what exactly made you apply for this job at this company?<br/>
🎧 Errrr... ooo... well. The reason I applied is....<br/>
🎧 Yes, yes, yes Anna? Do you need a bit more time to think?<br/>
🎧 Errr…mmm<br/>...
🎧 What's she going to say? How would you answer that? Join us next time to find out. Before we go, here's a reminder of some of the great lines Anna's used today... A good example that comes to mind I'm particularly proud of. Timekeeping is important to me. Until next time, bye bye! ·<br/>

🎧 Hello! Welcome back to the offices of Tip Top Trading, where Anna's interview for a sales job continues. When we last said goodbye, Tip Top boss Paul had asked Anna why she wanted the job. First she said:<br/>🎧 Errr... mmmmm...<br/>
🎧 Since then, she's added:<br/>🎧 Mmmm... errr...<br/>
🎧 And as we join her again, Anna is saying:<br/>🎧 Well, errrr... I'm errr.<br/>
🎧 Come on, Anna! If you can't think of the word you need, find another way of saying it.<br/>
🎧 I am... Well, I really, really want this job and I am willing to work very hard if I get it.<br/>
🎧 So you're very motivated, then?<br/>
🎧 Motivated! Yes, that's it. I am really motivated.<br/>
🎧 Good! Why?<br/>
🎧 Now over to you Anna; structure your answer! Say, 'firstly', then give your first reason, 'secondly' and then a second reason. Then say, 'above all' and give a really, really good, enthusiastic final reason! Go for it: firstly!<br/>
🎧 Firstly!<br/>
🎧 Firstly...?<br/>
🎧 Firstly, this job is an ideal match for my skills and experience: I've spent several years working in sales and I get on with people easily. Well, I mean, apart from the ones I don't like, of course. Secondly, I know Tip Top Trading is one of the fastest-growing companies in London, and I want to be part of that.<br/>
🎧 That's absolutely right. Tip Top Trading is the fastest-growing company in the plastic fruit sector. But enough about the company; this is all about you, Annabel.<br/>
🎧 Anna.<br/>
🎧 Sorry, Anna. Where were we?<br/>
🎧 Well, I said that firstly, this job is an ideal match for my skills and experience, secondly, the company is growing fast... and... and... above all... the reason I want this job is<br/>...🎧 Yes? (knock on the door) Denise! Is everything alright?<br/>
🎧 No Paul, it's not. Everything is not OK!<br/>
🎧 You look pale. Here, sit down, drink what's left of my tea.<br/>
🎧 Oh, thank you! Oh... what are those bits floating in it?<br/>
🎧 Oh they're just lumps of soggy biscuit. In fact, if I can just... get that bit out... with my finger... for you... Mmm, delicious! Now, tell me what happened.<br/>
🎧 Well, it's terrible...<br/>
🎧 Oh dear! Just as Anna was doing really well, it looks like her interview has come to a sudden end. What's happened? Join us next time to find out. But before we go, here's a reminder of how Anna structured her response:<br/>🎧 Firstly, this job is an ideal match for my skills and experience<br/>🎧 Secondly, I know Tip Top Trading is one of the fastest-growing companiesin London and<br/>...🎧 above all... the reason I want this job is<br/>...🎧 Anna couldn't remember the word 'motivated', so she just found another way of saying what she meant.<br/>
🎧 I really, really want the job and I am willing to work very hard if I get it.<br/>
🎧 Nice work, Anna! Let's hope you get the chance to finish your interview next week!<br/>
<br />

🎧 Here we are again at Tip Top Trading, where Anna's interview for a sales job has been suddenly interrupted. Office assistant Denise has entered the room, looking very worried. What's wrong? And will Anna have any suggestions that might help?<br/>
🎧 I don't know what to do!<br/>
🎧 So what's the matter Denise?<br/>
🎧 You know the PowerPoint presentation?<br/>
🎧 The one we've been preparing for the last two months?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 The one that's very, very important and that we need this afternoon?<br/>
🎧 That one.<br/>
🎧 Aha.<br/>
🎧 We've lost everything!<br/>
🎧 No!<br/>
🎧 I had it on a USB stick, to transfer it, but the stick has vanished!<br/>
🎧 Right Anna, now is your chance to help them find solutions to the problem.<br/>
🎧 You'll need phrases like:<br/>🎧 Can I make a suggestion?<br/>
🎧 Why don't you...?<br/>
🎧 Have you tried...?<br/>
🎧 Maybe we could...?<br/>
🎧 How about...?<br/>
🎧 I have an idea!<br/>
🎧 But don't you have it saved on your computer?<br/>
🎧 No, it was taking up a lot of space, so I deleted it.<br/>
🎧 So you have lost the only copy we have.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 What idiots! I've never seen such a disorganised office. Go on, you'd better help them, Anna.<br/>
🎧 Can I make a suggestion?<br/>
🎧 Yes, please do!<br/>
🎧 Why don't you try looking in your recycle bin? It might still be there.<br/>
🎧 I did. It isn't.<br/>
🎧 Have you tried asking your colleagues if they've seen the memory stick?<br/>
🎧 I did. They haven't.<br/>
🎧 How about looking through your rubbish bin to see if you threw it away by mistake?<br/>
🎧 (getting shirty) I don't do silly things like that!<br/>
🎧 All very sensible suggestions Anna, thank you.<br/>
🎧 Maybe I could do a big office search for you...? I'm good at finding things.<br/>
🎧 There are confidential documents in this office – non-staff are not allowed to see them.<br/>
🎧 Now, now Denise. Why don't you drink up that nice tea?<br/>
🎧 I have an idea! Did you ever email the presentation to anyone?<br/>
🎧 Golly gosh, you did Denise! You emailed it to me to proof-read. It'll be in my inbox somewhere. Good thinking Anna!<br/>
🎧 I was just about to suggest that myself.<br/>
🎧 Problem solved. Thank you Anna!<br/>
🎧 Pleasure.<br/>
🎧 Well done Anna!<br/>
🎧 Right, now please leave us Denise. Anna and I will continue our interview. Would you like a biscuit Anna?<br/>
🎧 Thank you. Oh, what's that?<br/>
🎧 Oh golly gosh, the USB stick! It was mixed in with the plate of biscuits that Denise brought in.<br/>
🎧 It's wet<br/>🎧 Yes, I think maybe I stirred my tea with it at one point. Oh well. Now, where were we...? My goodness, it's 11 o'clock! I have a meeting right now! I'm afraid I'm going to have to go. But I've made my mind up about you anyway. I suppose you'd like to know if you've got the job?<br/>
🎧 Yes please!<br/>
🎧 Ah - Stop right there! I'm sure everybody would like to know if Anna's got the job – but everybody's going to have to wait until we've heard her helpful phrases once again:<br/>🎧 Can I make a suggestion?<br/>
🎧 Why don't you try looking in your recycle bin?<br/>
🎧 Have you tried asking your colleagues if they've seen the memory stick?<br/>
🎧 How about...?<br/>
🎧 Maybe I could do a big office search for you...?<br/>
🎧 How about looking through your rubbish bin...?<br/>
🎧 I have an idea!<br/>
🎧 Anna, we need someone who can think on her feet and who is a first-rate people person. Someone who sees solutions, not problems... someone like you! So if you want the job, it's yours!<br/>
🎧 Ah, now think carefully Anna – do you really want to work for these people? They seem a bit... disorganised.<br/>
🎧 I would definitely like the job! Thank you!<br/>
🎧 So be it. Join us again next week for Anna's first day as a sales executive at Tip Top Trading.<br/>

🎧 Last week, Anna got the job of sales executive at Tip Top Trading, thanks to her quick-thinking in an office crisis. Today it's her first day in the office. How are you feeling now, Anna?<br/>
🎧 Excited, but a bit worried. I really want to make a good first impression.<br/>
🎧 Well, you're going to need some phrases to introduce yourself politely, such as:<br/>🎧 Hello, I don't think we've met.<br/>
🎧 You must be – and say the person's name.<br/>
🎧 I've just joined the team.<br/>
🎧 Nice to meet you.<br/>
🎧 Have you worked here long?<br/>
🎧 Why don't you start by saying hello to Tom Darcy, the Senior Account Manager?<br/>
🎧 Yah, yah, no, yah, yah, OK, yah. I'll seal the deal, yah, no worries. OK, see ya mate, bye!<br/>
🎧 Hello, I don't think we've met.<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 You must be Tom. I'm Anna. I've just joined the team.<br/>
🎧 Uh huh.<br/>
🎧 Nice to meet you. Have you worked here long?<br/>
🎧 Sorry, I'm quite busy right now – I've got a big deal just coming through. But let's get together sometime. Um... can you do lunch tomorrow?<br/>
🎧 You want me to do lunch? Well, I'm not very -<br/>🎧 Sorry, important client. Lunch tomorrow at 12.30 then?<br/>
🎧 (On the phone) Tom speaking. Yah! Frankie! So what's the latest, are we on?<br/>
🎧 Well, OK then.<br/>
🎧 Great Anna! You used some nice phrases to introduce yourself. It's a shame Tom thinks he's too important to do the same.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure he's just busy. But I'm a bit worried about tomorrow!<br/>
🎧 (The next day…)<br/>🎧 Good morning Paul!<br/>
🎧 Good morning Anna, are you OK?<br/>
🎧 Fine, the kitchen's through there, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Er, yes.<br/>
🎧 Anna!<br/>
🎧 Oh hi, Denise!<br/>
🎧 What are you doing?<br/>
🎧 Cooking lunch for Tom.<br/>
🎧 You what?<br/>
🎧 Tom asked me to have lunch ready for 12.30.<br/>
🎧 Did he indeed?<br/>
🎧 Er, Anna.<br/>
🎧 Hi Tom!<br/>
🎧 What are you doing?<br/>
🎧 Spring rolls, followed by crispy duck in black bean sauce.<br/>
🎧 No, I mean, why are you cooking?<br/>
🎧 Well, if I don't start now, it won't be ready for you by 12.30.<br/>
🎧 Oh, you misunderstood me, Anna. When I said "Can you do lunch?" it didn't mean "Can you make lunch?" It meant "Are you available to come to lunch with me?" In a cafe or something.<br/>
🎧 Oh!<br/>
🎧 Mmm... something smells good, but what's going on here?<br/>
🎧 Anna thinks it's her job to cook for people!<br/>
🎧 No, no, I misunderstood!<br/>
🎧 Anna just got a bit confused.<br/>
🎧 Well, never mind, it looks tasty.<br/>
🎧 There's enough for everyone if you want some.<br/>
🎧 I think that's a splendid idea, we can have an office picnic!<br/>
🎧 Yes!<br/>
🎧 Mmm, that sauce looks delicious.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's my favourite.<br/>
🎧 Well, once again everything has worked out well for Anna! Before we go, a reminder of the phrases she used:<br/>🎧 Hello, I don't think we've met.<br/>
🎧 You must be Tom.<br/>
🎧 I've just joined the team.<br/>
🎧 Nice to meet you.<br/>
🎧 Have you worked here long?<br/>
🎧 Just remember - if somebody says "Would you like to do lunch?" they're not usually expecting you to cook for them! Goodbye.<br/>

🎧 Welcome back to English at Work. We're still in Anna's first week in the busy offices of Tip Top Trading. How's it going Anna?<br/>
🎧 Everything's still so new to me. I keep needing to ask people for help!<br/>
🎧 Well, that's only natural at the beginning. To ask people politely for help use the words would and could. You can also use the word please, but don't make the mistake of thinking's enough to make what you say polite.<br/>
🎧 Er, ok.<br/>
🎧 Hello Anna!<br/>
🎧 Oh hi, Paul!<br/>
🎧 I was wondering if you could do something for me?<br/>
🎧 Yes of course.<br/>
🎧 Would you be able to print out a file for me? It's a document on CBL – Convincing Bananas Limited – they're one of our suppliers. The file should<br/>🎧 be on the system and could I have it in the next ten minutes please, as they're on their way here for a meeting?<br/>
🎧 Yes. Oh no, I've no idea how to find it! Tom...?!<br/>
🎧 Er, ask Denise. She should know.<br/>
🎧 Ok, thanks Tom, I'll ask her.<br/>
🎧 (on the phone to Sharon) I'd warned her, you know, I said 'Victoria, if you don't change your hairdresser?<br/>
🎧 One day you'll... hold on a moment. Anna?<br/>
🎧 Please email me the background file on CBL.<br/>
🎧 Er!<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 (on the phone) Who does that girl think she is?... Anna... new girl... I told you about her... yes with the saucepans, that's the one. She's only been<br/>🎧 here five minutes and she's already acting like the Queen of Sheba... <br/>🎧 Oh and Denise, please send it to me within five minutes, Paul needs it soon. Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Really!<br/>
🎧 He he, good to see who's the boss, eh Denise?<br/>
🎧 Really!<br/>
🎧 Er, Anna, I think you've upset Denise...?<br/>
🎧 Upset Denise?<br/>
🎧 You were a bit rude when you asked her to help.<br/>
🎧 Was I?<br/>
🎧 Remember what I said Anna. Just using 'please' to ask someone to do something can sound a little rude.<br/>
🎧 Oh.<br/>
🎧 Instead of saying 'Please send me the file' you could say 'Could you possibly send me the file?' or 'Would you mind sending me the file?'<br/>🎧 Oh! English is so confusing! I'll try to remember that. Oh no, the printer isn't even set up! Tom?<br/>
🎧 Yeah?<br/>
🎧 Please help me with…I mean, could you possibly help me with the printer?<br/>
🎧 Er... I need to finish this email to a really important new client.<br/>
🎧 But it's really urgent. Would you mind writing your email later?<br/>
🎧 Okay, since you asked so nicely. Let's have a look...<br/>
🎧 Well, it's a good thing Anna has understood how to use 'could' and 'would' to ask for things, before she upsets anyone else. Let's hear those phrases<br/>🎧 again:<br/>🎧 I was wondering if you could do something for me?<br/>
🎧 Would you be able to print out a file for me?<br/>
🎧 Could I have it within ten minutes please?<br/>
🎧 Could you possibly help me with the printer?<br/>
🎧 Would you mind writing your email later?<br/>
🎧 The printer seems to be working well, but how well are Anna and Denise working together? Are these two going to be enemies?<br/>
🎧 Really! 'Denise do this! Denise do that!' I'm telling you Sharon, I've almost had enough! I get treated like I'm some kind of servant!<br/>
<br/><br/>
