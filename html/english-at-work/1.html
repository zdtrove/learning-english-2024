🎧 <span>Hold</span> <span>tight</span> please! This is Anna, on a bus going to an <span>interview</span> for a <span>job</span> as a <span>sales</span> <span>executive</span> at Tip Top <span>Trading</span> <span>–</span> one of <span>London's</span> <span>fastest</span> <span>growing</span> <span>companies</span>. How are you feeling Anna?<br/>
🎧 Oh, a little <span>nervous</span> but I really want this <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well don't <span>worry</span> Anna, as long as you say the right things, you'll be fine.<br/>
🎧 The right <span>things!</span>? Like what?<br/>
🎧 You need to sell <span>yourself</span>, be <span>confident</span>, not <span>arrogant</span> and give <span>examples</span>. <span>Like:</span> A good example that comes to <span>mind</span>. I'm <span>particularly</span> <span>proud</span> of. <span>Timekeeping</span> is <span>important</span> to me.<br/>
🎧 Oh right. Thanks. <span>Perhaps</span> you can come with me?<br/>
🎧 Sorry Anna, you're on your own now <span>–</span> but we'll be <span>listening</span> in. Look! You've just <span>arrived</span>. Good <span>luck</span>!<br/>
🎧 Come in. Hello, I'm Paul, the <span>Manager</span> of Tip Top <span>Trading</span>. And you must <span>be….</span>?<br/>
🎧 It's Anna.<br/>
🎧 Yes, very good. Thanks for <span>coming</span>. Now somewhere in this <span>pile</span>, I've got your <span>CV<br/></span>...
🎧 <span>Err</span>, is that it there?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, thanks <span>Hannah</span>. Your <span>qualifications</span> look <span>impressive</span> but what <span>sales</span> <span>experience</span> can you <span>bring</span> to our <span>company</span>?<br/>
🎧 I <span>worked</span> in a <span>shop</span> once.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ohhh</span> Anna! Sell <span>yourself</span>. Give a good example!<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>right…mmm….well</span> a good example that comes to <span>mind</span> is when I was <span>involved</span> with a <span>campaign</span> to <span>promote</span> and sell a new <span>range</span> of <span>clothes</span> <span>–</span> I loved doing it and it <span>was<br/></span>...
🎧 Oh sorry, <span>excuse</span> me, here's your tea <span>Paul.:</span> Thanks Denise. Now Anna, it looks like you've <span>achieved</span> a lot during your time at <span>university</span>. Could you give me an example of good <span>team</span> working during your time there?<br/>
🎧 Sorry! I <span>forgot</span> the <span>sugar</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you Denise.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, so you want an example? I was the <span>treasurer</span> of the <span>debating</span> <span>society</span> at <span>university</span>. That was OK I <span>suppose</span>.<br/>
🎧 Come on Anna. Be more <span>enthusiastic</span> <span>–</span> the <span>debating</span> <span>society</span> is <span>exciting</span>!<br/>
🎧 I <span>mean</span>... I'm <span>particularly</span> <span>proud</span> of how I <span>organised</span> the <span>finances</span> for the <span>debating</span> <span>society</span>. We had a very small <span>budget</span> and I had to make <span>decisions</span> on what to buy.<br/>
🎧 I like it! <span>"I'm</span> <span>particularly</span> <span>proud</span> <span>of"</span> <span>-</span> <span>Positive</span> but not <span>boasting</span>. You're doing well.<br/>
🎧 Very <span>impressive</span> <span>–</span> so you're a good <span>planner</span> Anna! We like <span>organised</span> people <span>here</span>... <span>ooops</span>, <span>silly</span> me. I <span>seemed</span> to have <span>spilt</span> tea over your <span>CV</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, do you need some help?<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>no…I'm</span> sure it'll dry <span>out</span>... <span>carry</span> on <span>please<br/></span>...
🎧 <span>Also</span>... <span>timekeeping</span> is <span>important</span> to <span>me<br/></span>...
🎧 <span>"Timekeeping</span> is <span>important</span> to <span>me"</span> <span>–</span> that's good!<br/>
🎧 I always try to <span>complete</span> my work on time. At <span>university</span> I never <span>handed</span> my <span>assignments</span> in <span>late</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's good to hear. We like <span>punctuality</span> <span>here<br/></span>...
🎧 <span>Excuse</span> me Paul. Sorry it's a bit <span>late</span> <span>–</span> but I thought you might like a <span>biscuit</span> with your tea.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span> <span>thanks….oh</span> <span>lovely</span>, <span>custard</span> <span>creams</span>... <span>mmm</span>. Now <span>Hannah</span>, <span>finally</span> I wanted to ask you what exactly made you <span>apply</span> for this <span>job</span> at this <span>company</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Errrr</span>... <span>ooo</span>... well. The <span>reason</span> I <span>applied</span> <span>is</span>....<br/>
🎧 Yes, yes, yes Anna? Do you need a bit more time to think?<br/>
🎧 <span>Errr…mmm<br/></span>...
🎧 What's she going to say? How would you answer that? Join us next time to find out. Before we go, here's a <span>reminder</span> of some of the great <span>lines</span> <span>Anna's</span> used <span>today</span>... A good example that comes to <span>mind</span> I'm <span>particularly</span> <span>proud</span> of. <span>Timekeeping</span> is <span>important</span> to me. Until next time, bye bye! <span>·<br/>

🎧 Hello! <span>Welcome</span> back to the <span>offices</span> of Tip Top <span>Trading</span>, where <span>Anna's</span> <span>interview</span> for a <span>sales</span> <span>job</span> <span>continues</span>. When we last said <span>goodbye</span>, Tip Top <span>boss</span> Paul had <span>asked</span> Anna why she wanted the <span>job</span>. First she <span>said:<br/></span>🎧 <span>Errr</span>... <span>mmmmm</span>...<br/>
🎧 Since then, she's <span>added:<br/></span>🎧 <span>Mmmm</span>... <span>errr</span>...<br/>
🎧 And as we join her again, Anna is <span>saying:<br/></span>🎧 Well, <span>errrr</span>... I'm <span>errr</span>.<br/>
🎧 Come on, Anna! If you can't think of the <span>word</span> you need, find another way of saying it.<br/>
🎧 I <span>am</span>... Well, I really, really want this <span>job</span> and I am <span>willing</span> to work very <span>hard</span> if I get it.<br/>
🎧 So you're very <span>motivated</span>, then?<br/>
🎧 <span>Motivated</span>! Yes, <span>that's</span> it. I am really <span>motivated</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good! Why?<br/>
🎧 Now over to you <span>Anna;</span> <span>structure</span> your answer! Say, <span>'firstly'</span>, then give your first <span>reason</span>, <span>'secondly'</span> and then a <span>second</span> <span>reason</span>. Then say, <span>'above</span> <span>all'</span> and give a really, really good, <span>enthusiastic</span> <span>final</span> <span>reason</span>! Go for <span>it:</span> <span>firstly</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Firstly</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Firstly</span>...?<br/>
🎧 <span>Firstly</span>, this <span>job</span> is an <span>ideal</span> <span>match</span> for my <span>skills</span> and <span>experience:</span> I've <span>spent</span> <span>several</span> years working in <span>sales</span> and I get on with people <span>easily</span>. Well, I mean, <span>apart</span> from the <span>ones</span> I don't like, of course. <span>Secondly</span>, I know Tip Top <span>Trading</span> is one of the <span>fastest-growing</span> <span>companies</span> in <span>London</span>, and I want to be <span>part</span> of that.<br/>
🎧 That's absolutely right. Tip Top <span>Trading</span> is the <span>fastest-growing</span> <span>company</span> in the <span>plastic</span> <span>fruit</span> <span>sector</span>. But enough about the <span>company;</span> this is all about you, <span>Annabel</span>.<br/>
🎧 Anna.<br/>
🎧 Sorry, Anna. Where were we?<br/>
🎧 Well, I said that <span>firstly</span>, this <span>job</span> is an <span>ideal</span> <span>match</span> for my <span>skills</span> and <span>experience</span>, <span>secondly</span>, the <span>company</span> is <span>growing</span> <span>fast</span>... <span>and</span>... <span>and</span>... <span>above</span> <span>all</span>... the <span>reason</span> I want this <span>job</span> <span>is<br/></span>...🎧 Yes? <span>(knock</span> on the <span>door)</span> Denise! Is everything alright?<br/>
🎧 No Paul, it's not. Everything is not OK!<br/>
🎧 You look <span>pale</span>. Here, sit down, drink what's <span>left</span> of my tea.<br/>
🎧 Oh, thank you! <span>Oh</span>... what are those <span>bits</span> <span>floating</span> in it?<br/>
🎧 Oh they're just <span>lumps</span> of <span>soggy</span> <span>biscuit</span>. In <span>fact</span>, if I can <span>just</span>... get that bit <span>out</span>... with my <span>finger</span>... for <span>you</span>... <span>Mmm</span>, <span>delicious</span>! Now, tell me what <span>happened</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, it's <span>terrible</span>...<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>dear</span>! Just as Anna was doing really well, it looks like her <span>interview</span> has come to a <span>sudden</span> end. <span>What's</span> <span>happened</span>? Join us next time to find out. But before we go, here's a <span>reminder</span> of how Anna <span>structured</span> her <span>response:<br/></span>🎧 <span>Firstly</span>, this <span>job</span> is an <span>ideal</span> <span>match</span> for my <span>skills</span> and <span>experience<br/></span>🎧 <span>Secondly</span>, I know Tip Top <span>Trading</span> is one of the <span>fastest-growing</span> <span>companiesin</span> <span>London</span> <span>and<br/></span>...🎧 <span>above</span> <span>all</span>... the <span>reason</span> I want this <span>job</span> <span>is<br/></span>...🎧 Anna <span>couldn't</span> <span>remember</span> the <span>word</span> <span>‘motivated'</span>, so she just <span>found</span> another way of saying what she <span>meant</span>.<br/>
🎧 I really, really want the <span>job</span> and I am <span>willing</span> to work very <span>hard</span> if I get it.<br/>
🎧 Nice work, Anna! Let's hope you get the <span>chance</span> to <span>finish</span> your <span>interview</span> next week!<br/>

🎧 Here we are again at Tip Top <span>Trading</span>, where <span>Anna's</span> <span>interview</span> for a <span>sales</span> <span>job</span> has been <span>suddenly</span> <span>interrupted</span>. <span>Office</span> <span>assistant</span> Denise has <span>entered</span> the room, <span>looking</span> very <span>worried</span>. What's wrong? And will Anna have any <span>suggestions</span> that might help?<br/>
🎧 I don't know what to do!<br/>
🎧 So what's the <span>matter</span> Denise?<br/>
🎧 You know the <span>PowerPoint</span> <span>presentation</span>?<br/>
🎧 The one we've been <span>preparing</span> for the last two <span>months</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 The one that's very, very <span>important</span> and that we need this <span>afternoon</span>?<br/>
🎧 That one.<br/>
🎧 <span>Aha</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've <span>lost</span> everything!<br/>
🎧 No!<br/>
🎧 I had it on a <span>USB</span> <span>stick</span>, to <span>transfer</span> it, but the <span>stick</span> has <span>vanished</span>!<br/>
🎧 Right Anna, now is your <span>chance</span> to help them find <span>solutions</span> to the <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll need <span>phrases</span> <span>like:<br/></span>🎧 Can I make a <span>suggestion</span>?<br/>
🎧 Why don't <span>you</span>...?<br/>
🎧 Have you <span>tried</span>...?<br/>
🎧 Maybe we <span>could</span>...?<br/>
🎧 How <span>about</span>...?<br/>
🎧 I have an idea!<br/>
🎧 But don't you have it <span>saved</span> on your <span>computer</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, it was taking up a lot of <span>space</span>, so I <span>deleted</span> it.<br/>
🎧 So you have <span>lost</span> the only <span>copy</span> we have.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 What <span>idiots</span>! I've never <span>seen</span> such a <span>disorganised</span> <span>office</span>. Go on, you'd better help them, Anna.<br/>
🎧 Can I make a <span>suggestion</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, please do!<br/>
🎧 Why don't you try <span>looking</span> in your <span>recycle</span> <span>bin</span>? It might still be there.<br/>
🎧 I did. It isn't.<br/>
🎧 Have you <span>tried</span> <span>asking</span> your <span>colleagues</span> if <span>they've</span> <span>seen</span> the <span>memory</span> <span>stick</span>?<br/>
🎧 I did. They haven't.<br/>
🎧 How about <span>looking</span> through your <span>rubbish</span> <span>bin</span> to see if you <span>threw</span> it away by <span>mistake</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>(getting</span> <span>shirty)</span> I don't do <span>silly</span> things like that!<br/>
🎧 All very <span>sensible</span> <span>suggestions</span> Anna, thank you.<br/>
🎧 Maybe I could do a big <span>office</span> <span>search</span> for <span>you</span>...? I'm good at <span>finding</span> things.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>confidential</span> <span>documents</span> in this <span>office</span> <span>–</span> <span>non-staff</span> are not <span>allowed</span> to see them.<br/>
🎧 Now, now Denise. Why don't you drink up that nice tea?<br/>
🎧 I have an idea! Did you ever <span>email</span> the <span>presentation</span> to <span>anyone</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Golly</span> <span>gosh</span>, you did Denise! You <span>emailed</span> it to me to <span>proof-read</span>. It'll be in my <span>inbox</span> somewhere. Good thinking Anna!<br/>
🎧 I was just about to <span>suggest</span> that myself.<br/>
🎧 <span>Problem</span> <span>solved</span>. Thank you Anna!<br/>
🎧 <span>Pleasure</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well done Anna!<br/>
🎧 Right, now please leave us Denise. Anna and I will <span>continue</span> our <span>interview</span>. Would you like a <span>biscuit</span> Anna?<br/>
🎧 Thank you. Oh, what's that?<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>golly</span> <span>gosh</span>, the <span>USB</span> <span>stick</span>! It was <span>mixed</span> in with the <span>plate</span> of <span>biscuits</span> that Denise <span>brought</span> in.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>wet<br/></span>🎧 Yes, I think maybe I <span>stirred</span> my tea with it at one <span>point</span>. Oh well. Now, where were <span>we</span>...? My <span>goodness</span>, it's <span>11</span> <span>o'clock</span>! I have a <span>meeting</span> right now! I'm <span>afraid</span> I'm going to have to go. But I've made my <span>mind</span> up about you <span>anyway</span>. I <span>suppose</span> you'd like to know if you've got the <span>job</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes please!<br/>
🎧 Ah <span>-</span> <span>Stop</span> right there! I'm sure <span>everybody</span> would like to know if <span>Anna's</span> got the <span>job</span> <span>–</span> but <span>everybody's</span> going to have to wait until we've <span>heard</span> her <span>helpful</span> <span>phrases</span> once <span>again:<br/></span>🎧 Can I make a <span>suggestion</span>?<br/>
🎧 Why don't you try <span>looking</span> in your <span>recycle</span> <span>bin</span>?<br/>
🎧 Have you <span>tried</span> <span>asking</span> your <span>colleagues</span> if <span>they've</span> <span>seen</span> the <span>memory</span> <span>stick</span>?<br/>
🎧 How <span>about</span>...?<br/>
🎧 Maybe I could do a big <span>office</span> <span>search</span> for <span>you</span>...?<br/>
🎧 How about <span>looking</span> through your <span>rubbish</span> <span>bin</span>...?<br/>
🎧 I have an idea!<br/>
🎧 Anna, we need <span>someone</span> who can think on her <span>feet</span> and who is a <span>first-rate</span> people person. <span>Someone</span> who <span>sees</span> <span>solutions</span>, not <span>problems</span>... <span>someone</span> like you! So if you want the <span>job</span>, it's <span>yours</span>!<br/>
🎧 Ah, now think <span>carefully</span> Anna <span>–</span> do you really want to work for these people? They <span>seem</span> a <span>bit</span>... <span>disorganised</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would definitely like the <span>job</span>! Thank you!<br/>
🎧 So be it. Join us again next week for <span>Anna's</span> first day as a <span>sales</span> <span>executive</span> at Tip Top <span>Trading</span>.<br/>

🎧 Last week, Anna got the <span>job</span> of <span>sales</span> <span>executive</span> at Tip Top <span>Trading</span>, thanks to her <span>quick-thinking</span> in an <span>office</span> <span>crisis</span>. Today it's her first day in the <span>office</span>. How are you feeling now, Anna?<br/>
🎧 <span>Excited</span>, but a bit <span>worried</span>. I really want to make a good first <span>impression</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, you're going to need some <span>phrases</span> to <span>introduce</span> <span>yourself</span> <span>politely</span>, such <span>as:<br/></span>🎧 Hello, I don't think we've <span>met</span>.<br/>
🎧 You must be <span>–</span> and say the <span>person's</span> name.<br/>
🎧 I've just <span>joined</span> the <span>team</span>.<br/>
🎧 Nice to meet you.<br/>
🎧 Have you <span>worked</span> here long?<br/>
🎧 Why don't you start by saying hello to Tom <span>Darcy</span>, the <span>Senior</span> <span>Account</span> <span>Manager</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Yah</span>, <span>yah</span>, no, <span>yah</span>, <span>yah</span>, OK, <span>yah</span>. I'll <span>seal</span> the <span>deal</span>, <span>yah</span>, no <span>worries</span>. OK, see <span>ya</span> <span>mate</span>, bye!<br/>
🎧 Hello, I don't think we've <span>met</span>.<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 You must be Tom. I'm Anna. I've just <span>joined</span> the <span>team</span>.<br/>
🎧 Uh <span>huh</span>.<br/>
🎧 Nice to meet you. Have you <span>worked</span> here long?<br/>
🎧 Sorry, I'm quite <span>busy</span> right now <span>–</span> I've got a big <span>deal</span> just <span>coming</span> through. But let's get together sometime. <span>Um</span>... can you do lunch <span>tomorrow</span>?<br/>
🎧 You want me to do lunch? Well, I'm not very <span>-<br/></span>🎧 Sorry, <span>important</span> <span>client</span>. Lunch <span>tomorrow</span> at <span>12.30</span> then?<br/>
🎧 <span>(On</span> the <span>phone)</span> Tom <span>speaking</span>. <span>Yah</span>! <span>Frankie</span>! So what's the <span>latest</span>, are we on?<br/>
🎧 Well, OK then.<br/>
🎧 Great Anna! You used some nice <span>phrases</span> to <span>introduce</span> <span>yourself</span>. It's a <span>shame</span> Tom <span>thinks</span> he's too <span>important</span> to do the same.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure he's just <span>busy</span>. But I'm a bit <span>worried</span> about <span>tomorrow</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>(The</span> next <span>day…)<br/></span>🎧 Good morning Paul!<br/>
🎧 Good morning Anna, are you OK?<br/>
🎧 Fine, the <span>kitchen's</span> through there, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 <span>Er</span>, yes.<br/>
🎧 Anna!<br/>
🎧 Oh hi, Denise!<br/>
🎧 What are you doing?<br/>
🎧 Cooking lunch for Tom.<br/>
🎧 You what?<br/>
🎧 Tom <span>asked</span> me to have lunch ready for <span>12.30</span>.<br/>
🎧 Did he <span>indeed</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Er</span>, Anna.<br/>
🎧 Hi Tom!<br/>
🎧 What are you doing?<br/>
🎧 <span>Spring</span> <span>rolls</span>, <span>followed</span> by <span>crispy</span> <span>duck</span> in <span>black</span> <span>bean</span> <span>sauce</span>.<br/>
🎧 No, I mean, why are you cooking?<br/>
🎧 Well, if I don't start now, it won't be ready for you by <span>12.30</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, you <span>misunderstood</span> me, Anna. When I said <span>"Can</span> you do <span>lunch?"</span> it didn't mean <span>"Can</span> you make <span>lunch?"</span> It <span>meant</span> <span>"Are</span> you <span>available</span> to come to lunch with <span>me?"</span> In a <span>cafe</span> or something.<br/>
🎧 Oh!<br/>
🎧 <span>Mmm</span>... something <span>smells</span> good, but what's going on here?<br/>
🎧 Anna <span>thinks</span> it's her <span>job</span> to <span>cook</span> for people!<br/>
🎧 No, no, I <span>misunderstood</span>!<br/>
🎧 Anna just got a bit <span>confused</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, never <span>mind</span>, it looks <span>tasty</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's enough for everyone if you want some.<br/>
🎧 I think that's a <span>splendid</span> idea, we can have an <span>office</span> <span>picnic</span>!<br/>
🎧 Yes!<br/>
🎧 <span>Mmm</span>, that <span>sauce</span> looks <span>delicious</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's my <span>favourite</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, once again everything has <span>worked</span> out well for Anna! Before we go, a <span>reminder</span> of the <span>phrases</span> she <span>used:<br/></span>🎧 Hello, I don't think we've <span>met</span>.<br/>
🎧 You must be Tom.<br/>
🎧 I've just <span>joined</span> the <span>team</span>.<br/>
🎧 Nice to meet you.<br/>
🎧 Have you <span>worked</span> here long?<br/>
🎧 Just <span>remember</span> <span>-</span> if <span>somebody</span> <span>says</span> <span>"Would</span> you like to do <span>lunch?"</span> they're not usually <span>expecting</span> you to <span>cook</span> for them! <span>Goodbye</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>Welcome</span> back to English at Work. We're still in <span>Anna's</span> first week in the <span>busy</span> <span>offices</span> of Tip Top <span>Trading</span>. How's it going Anna?<br/>
🎧 <span>Everything's</span> still so new to me. I keep <span>needing</span> to ask people for help!<br/>
🎧 Well, that's only <span>natural</span> at the <span>beginning</span>. To ask people <span>politely</span> for help use the <span>words</span> would and could. You can also use the <span>word</span> please, but don't make the <span>mistake</span> of <span>thinking's</span> enough to make what you say <span>polite</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Er</span>, ok.<br/>
🎧 Hello Anna!<br/>
🎧 Oh hi, Paul!<br/>
🎧 I was <span>wondering</span> if you could do something for me?<br/>
🎧 Yes of course.<br/>
🎧 Would you be able to <span>print</span> out a <span>file</span> for me? It's a <span>document</span> on <span>CBL</span> <span>–</span> <span>Convincing</span> <span>Bananas</span> <span>Limited</span> <span>–</span> they're one of our <span>suppliers</span>. The <span>file</span> <span>should<br/></span>🎧 be on the <span>system</span> and could I have it in the next ten <span>minutes</span> please, as they're on their way here for a <span>meeting</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes. Oh no, I've no idea how to find it! <span>Tom...?</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Er</span>, ask Denise. She should know.<br/>
🎧 Ok, thanks Tom, I'll ask her.<br/>
🎧 <span>(on</span> the phone to <span>Sharon)</span> I'd <span>warned</span> her, you know, I said <span>'Victoria</span>, if you don't change your <span>hairdresser</span>?<br/>
🎧 One day <span>you'll</span>... <span>hold</span> on a <span>moment</span>. Anna?<br/>
🎧 Please <span>email</span> me the <span>background</span> <span>file</span> on <span>CBL</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Er</span>!<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 <span>(on</span> the <span>phone)</span> Who does that girl think she <span>is?</span>... <span>Anna</span>... new <span>girl</span>... I told you about <span>her</span>... yes with the <span>saucepans</span>, that's the one. She's only <span>been<br/></span>🎧 here <span>five</span> <span>minutes</span> and she's already <span>acting</span> like the <span>Queen</span> of <span>Sheba</span>... <span><br/></span>🎧 Oh and Denise, please <span>send</span> it to me <span>within</span> <span>five</span> <span>minutes</span>, Paul needs it soon. Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Really!<br/>
🎧 He he, good to see who's the <span>boss</span>, <span>eh</span> Denise?<br/>
🎧 Really!<br/>
🎧 <span>Er</span>, Anna, I think you've <span>upset</span> <span>Denise</span>...?<br/>
🎧 <span>Upset</span> Denise?<br/>
🎧 You were a bit <span>rude</span> when you <span>asked</span> her to help.<br/>
🎧 Was I?<br/>
🎧 <span>Remember</span> what I said Anna. Just <span>using</span> <span>‘please'</span> to ask <span>someone</span> to do something can sound a little <span>rude</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh.<br/>
🎧 <span>Instead</span> of saying <span>'Please</span> <span>send</span> me the <span>file'</span> you could say <span>'Could</span> you <span>possibly</span> <span>send</span> me the <span>file?'</span> or <span>'Would</span> you <span>mind</span> <span>sending</span> me the <span>file?'<br/></span>🎧 Oh! English is so <span>confusing</span>! I'll try to <span>remember</span> that. Oh no, the <span>printer</span> isn't even set up! Tom?<br/>
🎧 Yeah?<br/>
🎧 Please help me <span>with…I</span> mean, could you <span>possibly</span> help me with the <span>printer</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Er</span>... I need to <span>finish</span> this <span>email</span> to a really <span>important</span> new <span>client</span>.<br/>
🎧 But it's really <span>urgent</span>. Would you <span>mind</span> <span>writing</span> your <span>email</span> later?<br/>
🎧 Okay, since you <span>asked</span> so <span>nicely</span>. Let's have a <span>look</span>...<br/>
🎧 Well, it's a good thing Anna has <span>understood</span> how to use <span>'could'</span> and <span>'would'</span> to ask for things, before she <span>upsets</span> <span>anyone</span> else. Let's hear those <span>phrases<br/></span>🎧 <span>again:<br/></span>🎧 I was <span>wondering</span> if you could do something for me?<br/>
🎧 Would you be able to <span>print</span> out a <span>file</span> for me?<br/>
🎧 Could I have it <span>within</span> ten <span>minutes</span> please?<br/>
🎧 Could you <span>possibly</span> help me with the <span>printer</span>?<br/>
🎧 Would you <span>mind</span> <span>writing</span> your <span>email</span> later?<br/>
🎧 The <span>printer</span> <span>seems</span> to be working well, but how well are Anna and Denise working together? Are these two going to be <span>enemies</span>?<br/>
🎧 Really! <span>'Denise</span> do this! Denise do <span>that!'</span> I'm <span>telling</span> you <span>Sharon</span>, I've almost had enough! I get <span>treated</span> like I'm some kind of <span>servant</span>!<br/>
<br/><br/>
