🎧 <span>'Look</span> forward to <span>hearing</span> from you soon. Kind <span>regards</span>, <span>Anna.'<br/></span>
🎧 <span>(on</span> the <span>phone)</span> <span></span>... And <span>Margery</span> <span>said:</span> <span>'I</span> don't think I've ever <span>seen</span> a <span>vegetable</span> quite that size <span>before...'<br/></span>
🎧 Where's that <span>hole-punch?</span>!<br/>
🎧 Ah, <span>business</span> as <span>usual</span> in the <span>offices</span> of Tip Top <span>Trading</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh for <span>goodness</span> <span>sake</span>! What a <span>disaster</span>! I can't <span>believe</span> it!<br/>
🎧 But one <span>member</span> of the <span>team</span> <span>seems</span> <span>bothered</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Arrgh</span>!<br/>
🎧 Anna, this is the <span>moment</span> to show you're <span>willing</span> to help.<br/>
🎧 Yes!<br/>
🎧 Use <span>phrases</span> like <span>'Is</span> there anything I can <span>do?'</span> <span>'Let</span> me <span>help!'</span> or, to be more <span>informal</span>, you can say, <span>'Can</span> I give you a <span>hand?'</span> or <span>'Give</span> me a <span>shout</span> if you need <span>anything!'<br/></span>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Go on!<br/>
🎧 Are you okay Tom?<br/>
🎧 <span>(grumpily)</span> No.<br/>
🎧 Is there anything I can do?<br/>
🎧 <span>(grumpily)</span> No.<br/>
🎧 Oh. What's wrong?<br/>
🎧 Everything.<br/>
🎧 I see. Can I give you a <span>hand</span>?<br/>
🎧 My <span>computer</span> has <span>crashed</span>. I've <span>lost</span> my phone. And there's a big, big <span>problem</span> with my <span>timetable</span>. <span>I've</span> got two <span>meetings</span> <span>scheduled</span> at the <span>same<br/></span>
🎧 time with two <span>extremely</span> <span>important</span> <span>clients</span>. I can't do them both at once!<br/>
🎧 Let me help.<br/>
🎧 Thanks Anna, but these are big, big <span>clients</span>. They need <span>someone</span> of <span>experience</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, give me a <span>shout</span> if you need anything!<br/>
🎧 I can <span>handle</span> this, alright?<br/>
🎧 <span>'I</span> can <span>handle</span> <span>this'</span>... <span>ungrateful</span> <span>idiot</span>. But you used all the right <span>phrases</span> Anna, well done. <span>Anyway</span>, I bet he'll change his <span>mind</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Oooh</span>, I know, and the <span>purple</span> <span>ones</span> are so much more <span>powerful</span>...<br/>
🎧 Anna? Could you help me?<br/>
🎧 <span>Ha</span>! I told you so!<br/>
🎧 <span>They've</span> both <span>arrived</span> at once! Oh <span>god</span>! I'll <span>deal</span> with Mrs <span>Kumquat</span>...<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 You talk to Mr Lime, he's from a <span>company</span> called <span>Citrus</span> <span>Ventures</span>. They own <span>hundreds</span> of <span>juice</span> <span>bars</span>.<br/>
🎧 Are you sure that's a good idea Tom?<br/>
🎧 I don't have much <span>choice</span>, do I?<br/>
🎧 Well I <span>could<br/></span>
🎧 Just keep him <span>occupied</span> Anna, tell him how great he <span>is</span>... no, no, tell him how great I am. Find out what he <span>wants</span>. If it's about the <span>-</span> well, <span>never<br/></span>
🎧 <span>mind</span>, just be nice. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Understood</span>.<br/>
🎧 Mr Lime! Are you well?<br/>
🎧 Yes, but I'm actually rather <span>angry</span> too.<br/>
🎧 Ah, well let me <span>introduce</span> you to Anna!<br/>
🎧 Mr Lime, it's a <span>pleasure</span> to meet you! Let me help with your <span>coat</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>er</span>... Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Can I give you a <span>hand</span> with your <span>scarf</span> too, Mr Lime?<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh</span>... Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Now, please come this way and you can tell me what's wrong.<br/>
🎧 Well done! Anna used some good <span>phrases</span> to <span>step</span> in and help with this <span>mess</span>. Let's hear them <span>again:<br/></span>
🎧 Is there anything I can do?<br/>
🎧 Let me help.<br/>
🎧 Can I give you a <span>hand</span>?<br/>
🎧 Give me a <span>shout</span> if you need anything.<br/>
🎧 But Mr Lime is <span>obviously</span> <span>upset</span> about something. What is it? And how will Anna <span>deal</span> with the <span>problem</span>? Let's hope it doesn't end in <span>disaster</span>!<br/>
<span><br/></span><br/>

🎧 Ah hello! <span>Welcome</span> back to Tip Top <span>Trading</span> <span>–</span> the <span>UK's</span> <span>leading</span> <span>wholesaler</span> of <span>imitation</span> <span>fruit</span>. Today you're <span>joining</span> us in the <span>middle</span> of the <span>action</span>! Anna is with an <span>important</span> <span>client</span> Mr Lime, from <span>Citrus</span> <span>Ventures</span>. He's <span>angry</span> and she'll have to <span>calm</span> him down. She could <span>cope</span> <span>brilliantly</span> here or this could be a <span>horrible</span> <span>mess</span>!<br/>
🎧 Well Mr Lime, how can I help you?<br/>
🎧 On <span>Monday</span> I was <span>meant</span> to <span>receive</span> <span>8,000</span> <span>plastic</span> <span>grapefruit</span> from Tip Top <span>Trading</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 The <span>delivery</span> was made on <span>Tuesday</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>dear</span>.<br/>
🎧 And <span>instead</span> of <span>8,000</span> <span>plastic</span> <span>grapefruit</span>, I got <span>800,000</span> <span>plastic</span> <span>pineapples</span>!<br/>
🎧 Right Anna, this is <span>serious</span>. You're going to have to <span>apologise</span> and show that you really mean it. <span>Say:</span> I'm really sorry to hear that.<br/>
🎧 I'm really sorry to hear that, Mr Lime.<br/>
🎧 What on <span>earth</span> am I going to do with <span>800,000</span> <span>plastic</span> <span>pineapples</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Show</span> Mr Lime that you <span>understand</span> the <span>problem</span>. These are <span>phrases</span> you can <span>use:</span> That's <span>totally</span> <span>unacceptable</span>. That must have been very <span>inconvenient</span> for you. And then <span>promise</span> to fix the <span>problem</span>. <span>Say:</span> You have my <span>word</span> that we will <span>sort</span> this out. We can do something to make up for the <span>inconvenience</span>. It won't <span>happen</span> again.<br/>
🎧 <span>800,000</span> <span>plastic</span> <span>pineapples</span>!<br/>
🎧 That's <span>totally</span> <span>unacceptable</span>.<br/>
🎧 I didn't even have <span>anywhere</span> to put them <span>-</span> and <span>pineapples</span> are so much <span>bigger</span> than <span>grapefruit</span>!<br/>
🎧 It must have been very <span>inconvenient</span> for you.<br/>
🎧 It <span>certainly</span> was! When he took my <span>order</span>, your <span>colleague</span> Tom told me that Tip Top <span>Trading</span> was the most <span>reliable</span> <span>firm</span> in the <span>industry</span>!<br/>
🎧 You have my <span>word</span> that we will <span>sort</span> this out. We'll <span>remove</span> the <span>pineapples</span> and have your <span>grapefruit</span> <span>sent</span> <span>via</span> <span>express</span> <span>delivery</span> this <span>afternoon</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good. Thank you.<br/>
🎧 And we could <span>include</span> some of our <span>latest-edition</span> <span>imitation</span> <span>oranges</span> to make up for the <span>inconvenience</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh! Well, that would be nice!<br/>
🎧 Tip top Anna! <span>Excellent</span> work and <span>excellent</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're made with <span>revolutionary</span> <span>premium</span> <span>faux-orange</span>, <span>laser-curve</span> <span>definition</span> <span>technology</span>... you will be the first to have them!<br/>
🎧 Wow, now that's good <span>customer</span> <span>service</span>! Tell me, do you have any other <span>artificial</span> <span>fruits</span> in this <span>range</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes. Well, it's a bit of a <span>secret</span>, but you're a <span>trusted</span> <span>client</span>, so I think I can tell <span>you</span>...<br/>
🎧 Go <span>on</span>...<br/>
🎧 We're about to <span>unveil</span> a new <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemon</span>.<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 I can't tell you any more for now. <span>But<br/></span>...
🎧 <span>Yes</span>...<br/>
🎧 Maybe we could <span>present</span> it to you more <span>formally</span> in a <span>couple</span> of <span>weeks</span>, when it's ready for <span>release</span>...?<br/>
🎧 Sounds perfect.<br/>
🎧 You would be the first to see it!<br/>
🎧 <span>Excellent</span>. Thank you, <span>er</span>... Anna, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 A very <span>pretty</span> name.<br/>
🎧 Thanks. It's <span>spelled</span> the same <span>forwards</span> and <span>backwards</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Is it really?<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, Mr Lime, we'll fix this <span>grapefruit</span> <span>problem</span> for you, and I <span>promise</span> you, it won't <span>happen</span> again.<br/>
🎧 Good, good. You're new here, aren't you Anna?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Well I look forward to working with you.<br/>
🎧 What a <span>success</span>! Mr Lime has come away a very happy <span>customer</span>! Here are the <span>phrases</span> Anna used while <span>apologising:<br/></span>
🎧 I'm really sorry to hear that, Mr Lime.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>totally</span> <span>unacceptable</span>.<br/>
🎧 It must have been very <span>inconvenient</span> for you.<br/>
🎧 You have my <span>word</span> that we will <span>sort</span> this out.<br/>
🎧 And we could <span>include</span> some of our <span>latest-edition</span> <span>imitation</span> <span>oranges</span> to make up for the <span>inconvenience</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>promise</span> you, it won't <span>happen</span> again.<br/>
🎧 What will <span>Anna's</span> <span>boss</span> Paul have to say about her work today? Join us next week to find out.<br/>

🎧 Good <span>afternoon</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hi, good <span>afternoon</span>.<br/>
🎧 Anna, Tom, room <span>301</span> please. Now.<br/>
🎧 <span>Welcome</span> back to Tip Top <span>Trading</span>, where things are a <span>teeny</span> bit <span>tense</span> today. Paul has called Tom and Anna into room <span>301</span>, the place where <span>difficult</span> <span>conversations</span> <span>happen</span>. <span>Perhaps</span> Paul has <span>found</span> out about <span>yesterday's</span> <span>unhappy</span> <span>clients</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>dear</span>.<br/>
🎧 You should be okay Anna. After the way you <span>coped</span> with Mr Lime, you should be <span>praised</span>.<br/>
🎧 Really? What do you think Paul will say?<br/>
🎧 Well, if he is <span>pleased</span>, he'll say things <span>like:<br/></span>
🎧 Well done.<br/>
🎧 You <span>handled</span> it well.<br/>
🎧 Great <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm really <span>impressed</span>.<br/>
🎧 And if he's not?<br/>
🎧 Well, I <span>suppose</span> <span>–</span> <span>oop</span>. <span>Here's</span> Paul now!<br/>
🎧 Well, Tom, <span>Anna</span>... <span>Yesterday</span> was not a great day. Two <span>clients</span> came in with <span>serious</span> <span>complaints</span>. Mrs <span>Kumquat</span> <span>received</span> a <span>delivery</span> of <span>imitation</span> <span>bananas</span> that were <span>purple</span>, not very <span>convincing</span>. And Mr Lime <span>ordered</span> <span>grapefruits</span>, but got <span>pineapples</span>. Tom.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Were you <span>responsible</span> for these <span>errors</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Well</span>... yes, <span>but<br/></span>...
🎧 Look, <span>mistakes</span> <span>happen</span>. But it <span>seems</span> that Mrs <span>Kumquat</span> <span>left</span> our <span>offices</span> even <span>angrier</span> than when she came in and she says she will never use Tip Top <span>Trading</span> again.<br/>
🎧 I <span>tried</span> my best.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmmm</span>. I <span>understand</span> you told her to <span>spray-paint</span> the <span>bananas</span> and to <span>'stop</span> being such a <span>miserable</span> old <span>witch'</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, well look, she'd been very <span>rude</span> to me.<br/>
🎧 If you weren't such a good <span>salesman</span> I would <span>fire</span> you for that. Anna.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Well done. Not only was Mr Lime <span>satisfied</span> that his <span>problem</span> would be <span>resolved</span>, but we might even get some <span>extra</span> <span>business</span> from him, thanks to your <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemon</span> <span>proposal</span>.<br/>
🎧 I hope so.<br/>
🎧 You were in a <span>difficult</span> <span>situation</span> and you <span>handled</span> it well. You <span>remained</span> <span>calm</span>, <span>friendly</span> and <span>professional</span>. So, great <span>job</span>. I'm really <span>impressed</span>. I'm going <span>to<br/></span>...
🎧 <span>(phone</span> <span>rings)<br/></span>
🎧 Who's that? Oh no. It's a call from the <span>USA</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>god</span>!<br/>
🎧 What?<br/>
🎧 It's the <span>boss</span>!<br/>
🎧 Whose <span>boss</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Ours</span>! The big, big <span>boss</span>, <span>based</span> in <span>America</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Shhhh</span>! <span>(on</span> the <span>phone)</span> <span>Hellooo</span>? Ah, good <span>afternoon</span> Mr <span>Socrates</span>, I mean, <span>er-</span> morning, <span>ha</span> <span>ha</span>, where you are it's <span></span>... yes, no, <span>n-yes</span> <span></span>.... I'm not sure. Mrs <span>Kumquat</span> <span></span>... did she? <span></span>... well, it was very <span>unfortunate</span> <span></span>.... <span>purple</span>, yes <span></span>.... <span>totally</span> <span>unacceptable</span> <span></span>.... I will. If you'd like I could <span></span>.... Mr <span>Socrates</span>? Hello? Mr <span>Socrates</span>? Oh, he's <span>gone</span>. Right where was I? Tom, great work. Anna, I'm <span>disappointed</span>. No, no, Anna, great work, I want you to take <span>charge</span> of the <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemon</span> <span>presentation</span>. Tom, if you speak to a <span>client</span> like that again there will be <span>disciplinary</span> <span>action</span>. Mrs <span>Kumquat</span> was so <span>angry</span> she even <span>emailed</span> Mr <span>Socrates</span>. Ok, <span>that's</span> it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Phew</span>! What a <span>relief</span> for Anna. Let's listen again to some of the <span>phrases</span> Paul used to <span>praise</span> <span>her:<br/></span>
🎧 Well done.<br/>
🎧 You were in a <span>difficult</span> <span>situation</span> and you <span>handled</span> it well.<br/>
🎧 So, great <span>job</span>. I'm really <span>impressed</span>.<br/>
🎧 He also <span>explained</span> why he thought Anna had done a good <span>job:<br/></span>
🎧 You <span>remained</span> <span>calm</span>, <span>friendly</span> and <span>professional</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Excellent</span> work Anna. But <span>Tom's</span> <span>mistakes</span> have <span>given</span> everyone a lot of work to do <span>tomorrow</span>.<br/>
🎧 First thing <span>tomorrow</span> we need to <span>sort</span> this <span>mess</span> out. Tom, I want you to phone every <span>single</span> <span>client</span> and check the <span>orders</span>. Anna, you can go to the <span>warehouse</span> and find out what's going on in there!<br/>
<span><br/></span><br/>

🎧 <span>Welcome</span> back! This is what's <span>happening</span> <span>today:</span> as a <span>result</span> of some <span>embarrassing</span> <span>mistakes</span> in <span>deliveries</span>, Tip Top <span>Trading's</span> big <span>boss</span> in <span>America</span> has <span>ordered</span> a <span>re-check</span> of every <span>order</span> this <span>month</span>. So, Paul is talking to key <span>customers</span> to see if <span>they've</span> got what they <span>needed:<br/></span>
🎧 I just want to check you're happy with the <span>grapes?</span>, whom we all know was <span>responsible</span> for the <span>disaster</span>, is <span>phoning</span> his <span>clients</span> to make sure he has the <span>correct</span> <span>information</span> about what they <span>want:<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Ya</span>, <span>yah</span>, I just want to make absolutely sure we get the <span>order</span> right for you and have the <span>correct</span> <span>number</span> of <span>fruit</span>...<br/>
🎧 Denise is, well, talking on the phone to a friend.<br/>
🎧 <span>Brown</span> <span>shoes</span> don't look right on him! He's not a <span>brown</span> <span>shoe</span> <span>sort</span> of <span>person</span>...<br/>
🎧 Anna has to go down to the <span>warehouse</span>, where the <span>products</span> are <span>prepared</span> for <span>delivery</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have to speak to Mr <span>Ingle</span>. <span>Apparently</span> he's not very <span>friendly</span>! He might not like me <span>asking</span> lots of <span>questions</span>!<br/>
🎧 Well, be <span>polite</span>, and start your <span>sentences</span> with things <span>like:<br/></span>
🎧 I just want to make sure <span>that</span>...<br/>
🎧 Could you <span>possibly</span> <span>clarify</span>...<br/>
🎧 I just want to <span>check</span>...<br/>
🎧 Just to be absolutely <span>clear</span>...<br/>
🎧 One thing I wasn't sure of <span>was</span>...<br/>
🎧 Good <span>luck</span>!<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>Ingle</span>, I don't think we've <span>met</span> yet, I'm Anna.<br/>
🎧 Hello. <span>Oi</span>! What are you doing with those <span>boxes</span>? I told you to put them in <span>storage</span>. Anna, is it?<br/>
🎧 Yes, sorry to <span>bother</span> you, I just want to check something. We've had a few <span>problems</span> with <span>orders</span>....<br/>
🎧 Well, that's not my <span>fault</span>. I do exactly what I'm <span>asked</span> to do. <span>(To</span> <span>workers)</span> No, not there, in <span>storage</span>!<br/>
🎧 Oh, well, I just want to make sure <span>that</span>....<br/>
🎧 <span>Thirty</span> years I've been doing this <span>job</span>, and I've never made a <span>mistake</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course, but because we've had <span>problems</span>, we need to make absolutely sure that all <span>deliveries</span> are <span>correct</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Humph</span>.<br/>
🎧 Could you <span>possibly</span> <span>clarify</span> what went out in <span>today's</span> <span>delivery</span> to Mr <span>Berry</span> of, <span>er</span>, <span>Bluetree</span> <span>Enterprises</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>500</span> <span>redcurrants</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right. That's fine.<br/>
🎧 Well done Anna, this is going very well. <span>Remember</span> that other <span>phrase</span> <span>–</span> <span>"I</span> just want to <span>check…"<br/></span>
🎧 OK. Now, I just want to check what was <span>sent</span> to <span>Cocoline</span> <span>Limited</span> <span>–</span> it should have been <span>fifteen</span> <span>mangos</span>...<br/>
🎧 Yeah. That's right.<br/>
🎧 Great, and just to be absolutely <span>clear</span>, you <span>sent</span> the <span>soft</span> <span>mangos</span>, not the <span>plastic</span> <span>ones</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, just like I was told to.<br/>
🎧 Good. One thing I wasn't sure of was <span>whether</span> we had enough <span>yellow</span> <span>bananas</span> in <span>stock</span> <span>–</span> I know there are some <span>purple</span> <span>ones</span>, <span>but</span>...<br/>
🎧 Yeah well, we do need more <span>yellow</span> <span>bananas</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, I'll just <span>write</span> that down. Thank you Mr <span>Ingle</span>. By the way, I like your <span>overalls</span>!<br/>
🎧 Oh thanks.<br/>
🎧 Well he was a bit <span>unfriendly</span>, but Anna got what she <span>needed</span>. Here are the <span>phrases</span> she <span>used:<br/></span>
🎧 I just want to make sure <span>that</span>...<br/>
🎧 Could you <span>possibly</span> <span>clarify</span>...<br/>
🎧 I just want to <span>check</span>...<br/>
🎧 Just to be absolutely <span>clear</span>...<br/>
🎧 One thing I wasn't sure of <span>was</span>... <span><br/></span>
🎧 Well, everything in the <span>warehouse</span> <span>seems</span> to be okay. Back in the <span>office</span>, Tom is having less <span>luck</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>(on</span> the <span>phone)</span> Really? Here it says <span>5,000</span> not <span>five</span>... <span>oh</span>...<br/>
🎧 It's going to be a long day for him! Until next time. Bye!<br/>

🎧 <span>Welcome</span>! The <span>team</span> at Tip Top <span>Trading</span> are <span>hard</span> at work, <span>making</span> <span>plans</span> for the <span>launch</span> and <span>presentation</span> of their <span>latest</span> <span>product:</span> the <span>revolutionary</span>, almost <span>real</span> <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemon</span>. They are <span>'brainstorming'</span>, <span>sharing</span> <span>ideas</span> on how to make their <span>lemon</span> a <span>success</span>.<br/>
🎧 But it needs to be <span>bright</span>!<br/>
🎧 This is much more <span>exciting</span>.<br/>
🎧 But having <span>three</span> <span>colours</span> would work better.<br/>
🎧 There is a lot of <span>disagreement</span> going on, which is <span>putting</span> <span>Anna's</span> <span>vocabulary</span> to the <span>test</span>!<br/>
🎧 Right, I'm taking the <span>final</span> <span>decision:</span> the <span>colour</span> <span>scheme</span> will be <span>green</span> and <span>yellow</span>, so that's that. Now, the first <span>presentation</span> will be to <span>er</span>, Mr, <span>er</span>, <span>Slime</span>.<br/>
🎧 Mr Lime.<br/>
🎧 Oh, <span>er</span>, Mr Lime <span>-</span> that bit of <span>biscuit</span> <span>looked</span> like an <span>'s'</span> <span>–</span> Mr Lime, thank you <span>Annabel</span>.<br/>
🎧 Anna.<br/>
🎧 Mr Lime and his <span>team</span> at <span>Citrus</span> <span>Ventures</span>. <span>Ideas</span> please!<br/>
🎧 Why don't we <span>offer</span> <span>Citrus</span> <span>Ventures</span> a special <span>opening</span> <span>offer:</span> <span>20%</span> off <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemon</span> <span>orders</span> made this <span>month</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>...<br/>
🎧 We could even do that for all our <span>regular</span> <span>clients</span>.<br/>
🎧 That would be a big <span>risk</span>.<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 If we do that once, all our <span>clients</span> will start <span>asking</span> for <span>20%</span> off everything.<br/>
🎧 No, I <span>disagree</span>.<br/>
🎧 We'll be <span>bankrupt</span>!<br/>
🎧 No, you're wrong.<br/>
🎧 <span>Er-</span> Anna, maybe you should find a better way of saying you <span>disagree</span> with Denise.<br/>
🎧 I'm so <span>frustrated</span>! I can't think of the right <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 It helps if you try <span>phrases</span> <span>like:<br/></span>
🎧 Well, I'm not so sure about <span>that</span>... then <span>explain</span> why.<br/>
🎧 Or start your <span>sentence</span> with <span>'but'</span> when you want to <span>disagree</span> with what has just been said.<br/>
🎧 Or, to <span>seem</span> more <span>polite</span>, you can <span>try:<br/></span>
🎧 I see your <span>point</span>, but actually I <span>think</span>...<br/>
🎧 I'll try.<br/>
🎧 And don't be <span>aggressive</span> Anna <span>-</span> and give your <span>reasons</span> too, or you'll <span>upset</span> Denise again!<br/>
🎧 OK. Well, I'm not so sure about that. I think it will <span>improve</span> our <span>sales</span> of <span>lemons</span> and make our <span>clients</span> happy. Happy <span>clients</span> will come back to buy more.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's a good <span>point</span> <span>Annabe</span> <span>-</span> Anna.<br/>
🎧 But <span>20%</span> is a lot <span>–</span> maybe <span>5%</span> would be better.<br/>
🎧 But if we're going to make a special <span>offer</span>, we should make it so good that everyone will say yes!<br/>
🎧 But people might think there's something wrong with our <span>lemons</span> and that we're <span>desperate</span> to get rid of them.<br/>
🎧 I see your <span>point</span>, but, if we <span>explain</span> this is just a special <span>offer</span> for special <span>clients</span>, they'll <span>understand</span>.<br/>
🎧 I like that idea. <span>Good:</span> <span>20%</span> off for all <span>regular</span> <span>clients</span> just for this <span>month</span>. Anna, you'll be <span>making</span> the <span>presentation</span> to <span>Citrus</span> <span>Ventures</span>, so make sure you <span>include</span> that <span>offer</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Uh-huh</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Right, next, what <span>photos</span> do we have of the <span>lemons</span>...?<br/>
🎧 <span>Finding</span> the right <span>words</span> to <span>disagree</span> in <span>meetings</span> isn't always easy, but Anna <span>managed</span> in the end. She <span>started</span> <span>sentences</span> with this short <span>word</span> to show that she was about to <span>disagree</span> with what had just been <span>said:<br/></span>
🎧 <span>But</span>...<br/>
🎧 And used these <span>phrases:<br/></span>
🎧 I'm not so sure about <span>that</span>......<br/>
🎧 I see your <span>point</span>, but actually I <span>think</span>...<br/>
🎧 The next big <span>challenge</span> for Anna will be her <span>presentation</span> to <span>Citrus</span> <span>Ventures</span>. Join us again soon to find out what <span>happens</span>!<br/>
🎧 I've got to do a good <span>job</span> but it's going to take me <span>ages</span>. Ah well, I had better get <span>started</span> <span>otherwise</span> I'm going to be here all <span>night</span>!<br/>
