🎧 'Look forward to hearing from you soon. Kind regards, Anna.'<br/>
🎧 (on the phone) ... And Margery said: 'I don't think I've ever seen a vegetable quite that size before...'<br/>
🎧 Where's that hole-punch?!<br/>
🎧 Ah, business as usual in the offices of Tip Top Trading.<br/>
🎧 Oh for goodness sake! What a disaster! I can't believe it!<br/>
🎧 But one member of the team seems bothered.<br/>
🎧 Arrgh!<br/>
🎧 Anna, this is the moment to show you're willing to help.<br/>
🎧 Yes!<br/>
🎧 Use phrases like 'Is there anything I can do?' 'Let me help!' or, to be more informal, you can say, 'Can I give you a hand?' or 'Give me a shout if you need anything!'<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Go on!<br/>
🎧 Are you okay Tom?<br/>
🎧 (grumpily) No.<br/>
🎧 Is there anything I can do?<br/>
🎧 (grumpily) No.<br/>
🎧 Oh. What's wrong?<br/>
🎧 Everything.<br/>
🎧 I see. Can I give you a hand?<br/>
🎧 My computer has crashed. I've lost my phone. And there's a big, big problem with my timetable. I've got two meetings scheduled at the same<br/>
🎧 time with two extremely important clients. I can't do them both at once!<br/>
🎧 Let me help.<br/>
🎧 Thanks Anna, but these are big, big clients. They need someone of experience.<br/>
🎧 Well, give me a shout if you need anything!<br/>
🎧 I can handle this, alright?<br/>
🎧 'I can handle this'... ungrateful idiot. But you used all the right phrases Anna, well done. Anyway, I bet he'll change his mind.<br/>
🎧 Oooh, I know, and the purple ones are so much more powerful...<br/>
🎧 Anna? Could you help me?<br/>
🎧 Ha! I told you so!<br/>
🎧 They've both arrived at once! Oh god! I'll deal with Mrs Kumquat...<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 You talk to Mr Lime, he's from a company called Citrus Ventures. They own hundreds of juice bars.<br/>
🎧 Are you sure that's a good idea Tom?<br/>
🎧 I don't have much choice, do I?<br/>
🎧 Well I could<br/>
🎧 Just keep him occupied Anna, tell him how great he is... no, no, tell him how great I am. Find out what he wants. If it's about the - well, never<br/>
🎧 mind, just be nice. <br/>
🎧 Understood.<br/>
🎧 Mr Lime! Are you well?<br/>
🎧 Yes, but I'm actually rather angry too.<br/>
🎧 Ah, well let me introduce you to Anna!<br/>
🎧 Mr Lime, it's a pleasure to meet you! Let me help with your coat.<br/>
🎧 Oh er... Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Can I give you a hand with your scarf too, Mr Lime?<br/>
🎧 Oh... Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Now, please come this way and you can tell me what's wrong.<br/>
🎧 Well done! Anna used some good phrases to step in and help with this mess. Let's hear them again:<br/>
🎧 Is there anything I can do?<br/>
🎧 Let me help.<br/>
🎧 Can I give you a hand?<br/>
🎧 Give me a shout if you need anything.<br/>
🎧 But Mr Lime is obviously upset about something. What is it? And how will Anna deal with the problem? Let's hope it doesn't end in disaster!<br/>
<br/><br/>

🎧 Ah hello! Welcome back to Tip Top Trading – the UK's leading wholesaler of imitation fruit. Today you're joining us in the middle of the action! Anna is with an important client Mr Lime, from Citrus Ventures. He's angry and she'll have to calm him down. She could cope brilliantly here or this could be a horrible mess!<br/>
🎧 Well Mr Lime, how can I help you?<br/>
🎧 On Monday I was meant to receive 8,000 plastic grapefruit from Tip Top Trading.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 The delivery was made on Tuesday.<br/>
🎧 Oh dear.<br/>
🎧 And instead of 8,000 plastic grapefruit, I got 800,000 plastic pineapples!<br/>
🎧 Right Anna, this is serious. You're going to have to apologise and show that you really mean it. Say: I'm really sorry to hear that.<br/>
🎧 I'm really sorry to hear that, Mr Lime.<br/>
🎧 What on earth am I going to do with 800,000 plastic pineapples?<br/>
🎧 Show Mr Lime that you understand the problem. These are phrases you can use: That's totally unacceptable. That must have been very inconvenient for you. And then promise to fix the problem. Say: You have my word that we will sort this out. We can do something to make up for the inconvenience. It won't happen again.<br/>
🎧 800,000 plastic pineapples!<br/>
🎧 That's totally unacceptable.<br/>
🎧 I didn't even have anywhere to put them - and pineapples are so much bigger than grapefruit!<br/>
🎧 It must have been very inconvenient for you.<br/>
🎧 It certainly was! When he took my order, your colleague Tom told me that Tip Top Trading was the most reliable firm in the industry!<br/>
🎧 You have my word that we will sort this out. We'll remove the pineapples and have your grapefruit sent via express delivery this afternoon.<br/>
🎧 Good. Thank you.<br/>
🎧 And we could include some of our latest-edition imitation oranges to make up for the inconvenience.<br/>
🎧 Oh! Well, that would be nice!<br/>
🎧 Tip top Anna! Excellent work and excellent words.<br/>
🎧 They're made with revolutionary premium faux-orange, laser-curve definition technology... you will be the first to have them!<br/>
🎧 Wow, now that's good customer service! Tell me, do you have any other artificial fruits in this range?<br/>
🎧 Yes. Well, it's a bit of a secret, but you're a trusted client, so I think I can tell you...<br/>
🎧 Go on...<br/>
🎧 We're about to unveil a new Imperial Lemon.<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 I can't tell you any more for now. But<br/>...
🎧 Yes...<br/>
🎧 Maybe we could present it to you more formally in a couple of weeks, when it's ready for release...?<br/>
🎧 Sounds perfect.<br/>
🎧 You would be the first to see it!<br/>
🎧 Excellent. Thank you, er... Anna, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 A very pretty name.<br/>
🎧 Thanks. It's spelled the same forwards and backwards. <br/>
🎧 Is it really?<br/>
🎧 Anyway, Mr Lime, we'll fix this grapefruit problem for you, and I promise you, it won't happen again.<br/>
🎧 Good, good. You're new here, aren't you Anna?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Well I look forward to working with you.<br/>
🎧 What a success! Mr Lime has come away a very happy customer! Here are the phrases Anna used while apologising:<br/>
🎧 I'm really sorry to hear that, Mr Lime.<br/>
🎧 That's totally unacceptable.<br/>
🎧 It must have been very inconvenient for you.<br/>
🎧 You have my word that we will sort this out.<br/>
🎧 And we could include some of our latest-edition imitation oranges to make up for the inconvenience.<br/>
🎧 I promise you, it won't happen again.<br/>
🎧 What will Anna's boss Paul have to say about her work today? Join us next week to find out.<br/>

🎧 Good afternoon.<br/>
🎧 Hi, good afternoon.<br/>
🎧 Anna, Tom, room 301 please. Now.<br/>
🎧 Welcome back to Tip Top Trading, where things are a teeny bit tense today. Paul has called Tom and Anna into room 301, the place where difficult conversations happen. Perhaps Paul has found out about yesterday's unhappy clients.<br/>
🎧 Oh dear.<br/>
🎧 You should be okay Anna. After the way you coped with Mr Lime, you should be praised.<br/>
🎧 Really? What do you think Paul will say?<br/>
🎧 Well, if he is pleased, he'll say things like:<br/>
🎧 Well done.<br/>
🎧 You handled it well.<br/>
🎧 Great job.<br/>
🎧 I'm really impressed.<br/>
🎧 And if he's not?<br/>
🎧 Well, I suppose – oop. Here's Paul now!<br/>
🎧 Well, Tom, Anna... Yesterday was not a great day. Two clients came in with serious complaints. Mrs Kumquat received a delivery of imitation bananas that were purple, not very convincing. And Mr Lime ordered grapefruits, but got pineapples. Tom.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Were you responsible for these errors?<br/>
🎧 Well... yes, but<br/>...
🎧 Look, mistakes happen. But it seems that Mrs Kumquat left our offices even angrier than when she came in and she says she will never use Tip Top Trading again.<br/>
🎧 I tried my best.<br/>
🎧 Hmmm. I understand you told her to spray-paint the bananas and to 'stop being such a miserable old witch'.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, well look, she'd been very rude to me.<br/>
🎧 If you weren't such a good salesman I would fire you for that. Anna.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Well done. Not only was Mr Lime satisfied that his problem would be resolved, but we might even get some extra business from him, thanks to your Imperial Lemon proposal.<br/>
🎧 I hope so.<br/>
🎧 You were in a difficult situation and you handled it well. You remained calm, friendly and professional. So, great job. I'm really impressed. I'm going to<br/>...
🎧 (phone rings)<br/>
🎧 Who's that? Oh no. It's a call from the USA.<br/>
🎧 Oh god!<br/>
🎧 What?<br/>
🎧 It's the boss!<br/>
🎧 Whose boss?<br/>
🎧 Ours! The big, big boss, based in America.<br/>
🎧 Shhhh! (on the phone) Hellooo? Ah, good afternoon Mr Socrates, I mean, er- morning, ha ha, where you are it's ... yes, no, n-yes .... I'm not sure. Mrs Kumquat ... did she? ... well, it was very unfortunate .... purple, yes .... totally unacceptable .... I will. If you'd like I could .... Mr Socrates? Hello? Mr Socrates? Oh, he's gone. Right where was I? Tom, great work. Anna, I'm disappointed. No, no, Anna, great work, I want you to take charge of the Imperial Lemon presentation. Tom, if you speak to a client like that again there will be disciplinary action. Mrs Kumquat was so angry she even emailed Mr Socrates. Ok, that's it.<br/>
🎧 Phew! What a relief for Anna. Let's listen again to some of the phrases Paul used to praise her:<br/>
🎧 Well done.<br/>
🎧 You were in a difficult situation and you handled it well.<br/>
🎧 So, great job. I'm really impressed.<br/>
🎧 He also explained why he thought Anna had done a good job:<br/>
🎧 You remained calm, friendly and professional.<br/>
🎧 Excellent work Anna. But Tom's mistakes have given everyone a lot of work to do tomorrow.<br/>
🎧 First thing tomorrow we need to sort this mess out. Tom, I want you to phone every single client and check the orders. Anna, you can go to the warehouse and find out what's going on in there!<br/>
<br/><br/>

🎧 Welcome back! This is what's happening today: as a result of some embarrassing mistakes in deliveries, Tip Top Trading's big boss in America has ordered a re-check of every order this month. So, Paul is talking to key customers to see if they've got what they needed:<br/>
🎧 I just want to check you're happy with the grapes?, whom we all know was responsible for the disaster, is phoning his clients to make sure he has the correct information about what they want:<br/>
🎧 Ya, yah, I just want to make absolutely sure we get the order right for you and have the correct number of fruit...<br/>
🎧 Denise is, well, talking on the phone to a friend.<br/>
🎧 Brown shoes don't look right on him! He's not a brown shoe sort of person...<br/>
🎧 Anna has to go down to the warehouse, where the products are prepared for delivery.<br/>
🎧 I have to speak to Mr Ingle. Apparently he's not very friendly! He might not like me asking lots of questions!<br/>
🎧 Well, be polite, and start your sentences with things like:<br/>
🎧 I just want to make sure that...<br/>
🎧 Could you possibly clarify...<br/>
🎧 I just want to check...<br/>
🎧 Just to be absolutely clear...<br/>
🎧 One thing I wasn't sure of was...<br/>
🎧 Good luck!<br/>
🎧 Mr Ingle, I don't think we've met yet, I'm Anna.<br/>
🎧 Hello. Oi! What are you doing with those boxes? I told you to put them in storage. Anna, is it?<br/>
🎧 Yes, sorry to bother you, I just want to check something. We've had a few problems with orders....<br/>
🎧 Well, that's not my fault. I do exactly what I'm asked to do. (To workers) No, not there, in storage!<br/>
🎧 Oh, well, I just want to make sure that....<br/>
🎧 Thirty years I've been doing this job, and I've never made a mistake.<br/>
🎧 Of course, but because we've had problems, we need to make absolutely sure that all deliveries are correct.<br/>
🎧 Humph.<br/>
🎧 Could you possibly clarify what went out in today's delivery to Mr Berry of, er, Bluetree Enterprises?<br/>
🎧 500 redcurrants.<br/>
🎧 Right. That's fine.<br/>
🎧 Well done Anna, this is going very well. Remember that other phrase – "I just want to check…"<br/>
🎧 OK. Now, I just want to check what was sent to Cocoline Limited – it should have been fifteen mangos...<br/>
🎧 Yeah. That's right.<br/>
🎧 Great, and just to be absolutely clear, you sent the soft mangos, not the plastic ones?<br/>
🎧 Yes, just like I was told to.<br/>
🎧 Good. One thing I wasn't sure of was whether we had enough yellow bananas in stock – I know there are some purple ones, but...<br/>
🎧 Yeah well, we do need more yellow bananas.<br/>
🎧 Okay, I'll just write that down. Thank you Mr Ingle. By the way, I like your overalls!<br/>
🎧 Oh thanks.<br/>
🎧 Well he was a bit unfriendly, but Anna got what she needed. Here are the phrases she used:<br/>
🎧 I just want to make sure that...<br/>
🎧 Could you possibly clarify...<br/>
🎧 I just want to check...<br/>
🎧 Just to be absolutely clear...<br/>
🎧 One thing I wasn't sure of was... <br/>
🎧 Well, everything in the warehouse seems to be okay. Back in the office, Tom is having less luck.<br/>
🎧 (on the phone) Really? Here it says 5,000 not five... oh...<br/>
🎧 It's going to be a long day for him! Until next time. Bye!<br/>

🎧 Welcome! The team at Tip Top Trading are hard at work, making plans for the launch and presentation of their latest product: the revolutionary, almost real Imperial Lemon. They are 'brainstorming', sharing ideas on how to make their lemon a success.<br/>
🎧 But it needs to be bright!<br/>
🎧 This is much more exciting.<br/>
🎧 But having three colours would work better.<br/>
🎧 There is a lot of disagreement going on, which is putting Anna's vocabulary to the test!<br/>
🎧 Right, I'm taking the final decision: the colour scheme will be green and yellow, so that's that. Now, the first presentation will be to er, Mr, er, Slime.<br/>
🎧 Mr Lime.<br/>
🎧 Oh, er, Mr Lime - that bit of biscuit looked like an 's' – Mr Lime, thank you Annabel.<br/>
🎧 Anna.<br/>
🎧 Mr Lime and his team at Citrus Ventures. Ideas please!<br/>
🎧 Why don't we offer Citrus Ventures a special opening offer: 20% off Imperial Lemon orders made this month.<br/>
🎧 Hmm...<br/>
🎧 We could even do that for all our regular clients.<br/>
🎧 That would be a big risk.<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 If we do that once, all our clients will start asking for 20% off everything.<br/>
🎧 No, I disagree.<br/>
🎧 We'll be bankrupt!<br/>
🎧 No, you're wrong.<br/>
🎧 Er- Anna, maybe you should find a better way of saying you disagree with Denise.<br/>
🎧 I'm so frustrated! I can't think of the right words.<br/>
🎧 It helps if you try phrases like:<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm not so sure about that... then explain why.<br/>
🎧 Or start your sentence with 'but' when you want to disagree with what has just been said.<br/>
🎧 Or, to seem more polite, you can try:<br/>
🎧 I see your point, but actually I think...<br/>
🎧 I'll try.<br/>
🎧 And don't be aggressive Anna - and give your reasons too, or you'll upset Denise again!<br/>
🎧 OK. Well, I'm not so sure about that. I think it will improve our sales of lemons and make our clients happy. Happy clients will come back to buy more.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's a good point Annabe - Anna.<br/>
🎧 But 20% is a lot – maybe 5% would be better.<br/>
🎧 But if we're going to make a special offer, we should make it so good that everyone will say yes!<br/>
🎧 But people might think there's something wrong with our lemons and that we're desperate to get rid of them.<br/>
🎧 I see your point, but, if we explain this is just a special offer for special clients, they'll understand.<br/>
🎧 I like that idea. Good: 20% off for all regular clients just for this month. Anna, you'll be making the presentation to Citrus Ventures, so make sure you include that offer.<br/>
🎧 Uh-huh.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Right, next, what photos do we have of the lemons...?<br/>
🎧 Finding the right words to disagree in meetings isn't always easy, but Anna managed in the end. She started sentences with this short word to show that she was about to disagree with what had just been said:<br/>
🎧 But...<br/>
🎧 And used these phrases:<br/>
🎧 I'm not so sure about that......<br/>
🎧 I see your point, but actually I think...<br/>
🎧 The next big challenge for Anna will be her presentation to Citrus Ventures. Join us again soon to find out what happens!<br/>
🎧 I've got to do a good job but it's going to take me ages. Ah well, I had better get started otherwise I'm going to be here all night!<br/>
<br/><br/>
