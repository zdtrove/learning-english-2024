🎧 Hello! You're <span>joining</span> us again after <span>Anna's</span> call from Mr Lime <span>–</span> he <span>asked</span> her to lunch, <span>remember</span>. Now Anna and Denise are <span>flapping</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>...and</span> before you know it, he'll be <span>asking</span> you to <span>marry</span> him! <span>Trust</span> me Anna, this has <span>happened</span> to me <span>dozens</span> of <span>times</span>!<br/>
🎧 But I thought he was only interested in the <span>lemons</span>! Please <span>promise</span> me you <span>won't</span> <span>mention</span> this to <span>anyone</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, I <span>promise</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, <span>shhhh</span>!<br/>
🎧 Good morning. What's going on?<br/>
🎧 Mr Lime has <span>asked</span> Anna to lunch!<br/>
🎧 <span>Please<br/></span>...
🎧 And?<br/>
🎧 And it's not to talk <span>business</span>! I saw him looking at her with big <span>eyes</span>, from the <span>moment</span> he first saw her!<br/>
🎧 Denise!<br/>
🎧 Old <span>Slimy</span> <span>Limey</span> <span>eh</span>? <span>Lucky</span> Anna!<br/>
🎧 He's not <span>slimy</span>, it's <span>just<br/></span>...
🎧 Don't tell me you said <span>yes?</span>!<br/>
🎧 Well I didn't know what to say.<br/>
🎧 You didn't?<br/>
🎧 No, no, I said I was <span>busy</span> and would call back. I wanted to just say no, but with everyone <span>complaining</span> that I'm not <span>polite</span> on the <span>phone</span>... I <span>just</span>... I didn't know how to say it <span>politely</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ha</span> <span>ha</span>, I'll tell you what to say.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hang</span> on, let me <span>write</span> it <span>down</span>... why do all the <span>pens</span> keep <span>disappearing</span>?<br/>
🎧 Here's one.<br/>
🎧 Thanks. Okay, I'm <span>listening</span> Tom.<br/>
🎧 <span>Say:</span> <span>go</span>...<br/>
🎧 <span>(writing)</span> <span>go</span>...<br/>
🎧 <span>...away</span>... <span>Slimy</span> <span>Limey</span>.<br/>
🎧 Go away <span>Slimy</span> <span>Limey</span>. Are you sure?<br/>
🎧 Of course!<br/>
🎧 Don't listen to him Anna. This is what you should <span>say:<br/></span>
🎧 Thank you for your <span>offer</span>. But I'm really sorry, I won't be able to.<br/>
🎧 Then <span>explain</span> why, say I'm <span>afraid</span>... <span>blah</span> <span>blah</span> <span>blah<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Blah</span> <span>blah</span> <span>blah</span>?<br/>
🎧 Say it's <span>against</span> <span>company</span> <span>policy</span> to have <span>non-business</span> <span>lunches</span> with <span>clients</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Meaning</span>?<br/>
🎧 You're not <span>allowed</span> to if it's not for <span>business</span>. Then <span>say:<br/></span>
🎧 It wouldn't be <span>appropriate</span>. So, with <span>regret</span>, I'm going to have to say no.<br/>
🎧 Okay, I think I've got that all down. Thanks. He'll be <span>waiting</span> for my call.<br/>
🎧 <span>(dials</span> <span>phone)<br/></span>
🎧 Hello, <span>Seb</span> Lime <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hello Mr Lime.<br/>
🎧 Anna! Please, call me <span>Seb</span>. So, when can I <span>invite</span> you to lunch?<br/>
🎧 <span>(whispering</span> <span>loudly)</span> Thank you for your <span>offer</span>...<br/>
🎧 Well, thank you for your <span>offer</span>. But I'm really sorry, I won't be able to.<br/>
🎧 Oh?<br/>
🎧 <span>(whispering</span> <span>loudly)</span> I'm <span>afraid</span>...<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>afraid</span> it's <span>against</span> <span>company</span> <span>policy</span> to have <span>non-business</span> <span>lunches</span> with people.<br/>
🎧 Really? Oh how <span>tedious</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>(whispering</span> <span>loudly)</span> It wouldn't <span>be-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Shhh</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Pardon</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, not <span>shhh</span> you Mr <span>Slimy</span> I <span>meant</span> <span>shhhh</span> Denise!<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>Slimy</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh no! I mean Mr <span>Limey</span> <span>–</span> Lime <span>–</span> <span>er</span> <span>Seb</span>! You see, it wouldn't be <span>appropriate</span>. So, with <span>regret</span>, I'm going to have to say no.<br/>
🎧 I think I've <span>understood</span>. <span>Goodbye</span> Anna.<br/>
🎧 <span>Goodbye</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>dear</span>, he didn't take that too well. But, <span>apart</span> from a little <span>mistake</span>, Anna did well there. Here are the <span>phrases</span> she used to <span>politely</span> <span>refuse</span> the <span>offer</span> of <span>lunch:<br/></span>
🎧 Thank you for your <span>offer</span>. But I'm really sorry, I won't be able to.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>afraid</span> it is <span>against</span> <span>company</span> <span>policy<br/></span>...
🎧 It wouldn't be <span>appropriate</span>.<br/>
🎧 With <span>regret</span>, I'm going to have to say no.<br/>
🎧 Good <span>job</span> Anna, bad <span>luck</span> Mr <span>Slimy</span>!<br/>
<span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>Welcome</span> to the <span>offices</span> of Tip Top <span>Trading</span>...<br/>
🎧 <span>(ongoing</span> sound of <span>annoying</span> <span>mobile</span> phone <span>ringtone)<br/></span>
🎧 Anna, are you going to answer that?<br/>
🎧 <span>Er</span>, well, no. It's <span>stopped</span> now <span>anyway</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>...where</span> Anna is <span>behaving</span> <span>strangely</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>(ringing</span> <span>starts</span> <span>again)<br/></span>
🎧 I gave you a long <span>lesson</span> on how to answer the phone and you're still too <span>scared</span>!<br/>
🎧 It's not that.<br/>
🎧 <span>(desk</span> phone <span>starts</span> <span>ringing)<br/></span>
🎧 For <span>goodness</span> <span>sake</span>!<br/>
🎧 Then what?<br/>
🎧 I <span>recognise</span> the <span>number</span> <span>-</span> it's Mr Lime!<br/>
🎧 <span>Ha</span>! Old <span>Slimy</span> <span>Limy</span>, he must be absolutely <span>desperate</span> to get you to have lunch with him <span>–</span> even after your <span>cruel</span> <span>rejection</span>. Here, I'll answer for you.<br/>
🎧 No!<br/>
🎧 I'll answer. Hello, Tip Top <span>Trading</span>, <span>Anna's</span> <span>phone</span>... no, this is Denise <span>speaking</span>, <span>Anna's</span> <span>busy</span> at the <span>moment</span>. Can I take a <span>message?</span>... <span>Yes</span>... <span>right</span>.... I'll <span>pass</span> that on to her <span>then</span>... thank you for <span>calling</span>. <span>Goodbye</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well.<br/>
🎧 <span>Nothing</span> about lunch. He <span>wants</span> each <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemon</span> you <span>deliver</span> to come in a <span>luxury</span> <span>green</span> box <span>–</span> like the one you had at the <span>presentation</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>goodness</span>, we don't have many in <span>stock</span>, I'll have to <span>order</span> some. <span>Erm...(dials</span> a <span>number)</span> Hello, this is Anna <span>speaking</span> from Tip Top <span>Trading</span>, I want some <span>imperial</span> <span>lemon-sized</span> <span>luxury</span> <span>boxes</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Woah</span>, <span>woah</span>, <span>woah</span>.<br/>
🎧 What?<br/>
🎧 Let's make this <span>order</span> a bit more <span>politely</span> okay?<br/>
🎧 Why are the English so <span>obsessed</span> with being <span>polite!</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Calm</span> down Anna and listen to me. To put in an <span>order</span> for something, you need <span>phrases</span> <span>like:<br/></span>
🎧 I'd like to place an <span>order</span> <span>for</span>...<br/>
🎧 We're going to <span>need</span>...<br/>
🎧 Could you <span>send</span>...<br/>
🎧 Could we also <span>have</span>...<br/>
🎧 When can we <span>expect</span> to <span>receive</span> them?<br/>
🎧 <span>Right</span>... Hello, sorry about <span>that</span>... I'd like to place an <span>order</span> for some <span>imperial</span> <span>lemon-sized</span> <span>luxury</span> <span>boxes</span>, <span>please</span>... we're going to need quite a <span>few</span>... could you <span>send</span> <span>300</span> <span>please</span>... <span>yes</span>... the <span>green</span> <span>ones</span>... could we also have the name of our <span>company</span> on the <span>sides</span>... when can we <span>expect</span> to <span>receive</span> <span>them...okay</span>, thank you, <span>goodbye</span>. There! How was that?<br/>
🎧 Good, well done!<br/>
🎧 You'd better phone back Mr Lime to <span>confirm</span> he can have his <span>boxes</span>!<br/>
🎧 Oh no!<br/>
🎧 He's your <span>client</span>!<br/>
🎧 Yes Anna, he's your <span>client</span>!<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>scared</span> he'll try and ask about lunch again.<br/>
🎧 Then <span>send</span> him an <span>email</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good idea!<br/>
🎧 <span>Copy</span> in me, Tom and Paul, so it's <span>clear</span> you only mean <span>business</span> only.<br/>
🎧 Yes. Thanks Denise! An <span>email</span> is much <span>safer</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is it, Anna, is it? <span>Hmmm</span>...<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, here are the <span>phrases</span> Anna used to place her <span>order:<br/></span>
🎧 I'd like to place an <span>order</span> <span>for</span>...<br/>
🎧 We're going to <span>need</span>...<br/>
🎧 Could you <span>send</span>...<br/>
🎧 Could we also <span>have</span>...<br/>
🎧 When can we <span>expect</span> to <span>receive</span> them?<br/>
🎧 Let's see if <span>Anna's</span> <span>email</span> is really such a good idea. I have a bad feeling about it. Until next time!<br/>

🎧 Hello, <span>Anna's</span> just <span>arrived</span> at her <span>desk</span> to start the day at Tip Top <span>Trading</span>. Paul is <span>walking</span> <span>towards</span> her, <span>eating</span> a <span>biscuit</span>, he looks a bit <span>bothered</span>.<br/>
🎧 Anna?<br/>
🎧 Yes, Paul.<br/>
🎧 Come and have a <span>biscuit</span> in my <span>office</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now Anna, about Mr Lime.<br/>
🎧 I didn't say yes!<br/>
🎧 <span>Pardon</span>? Yes to what?<br/>
🎧 Oh, <span>nothing</span>.<br/>
🎧 You <span>sent</span> him an <span>email</span> <span>yesterday</span> and <span>copied</span> me in.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>email</span> <span>reads:</span> <span>boxes</span> ok. <span>pls</span> <span>c-d-u</span> <span>cfirm</span> <span>wnt</span> <span>300</span> <span>ta</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yes:</span> please could you <span>confirm</span> you want <span>300</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right. Now that's not really the best way of <span>writing</span> an <span>email</span> to a <span>client</span>, is it?<br/>
🎧 Oh.<br/>
🎧 Please could you <span>re-send</span> your <span>message</span> to Mr Lime, <span>using</span> <span>actual</span> <span>words</span> that make <span>sense</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Thank you. Have a <span>chocolate</span> <span>crunchy</span>!<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Morning Anna.<br/>
🎧 Hello.<br/>
🎧 Let me <span>guess</span>, Paul just <span>spoke</span> to you about your <span>email</span>?<br/>
🎧 How do you know?<br/>
🎧 You <span>copied</span> me in <span>remember</span>, I just read it <span>–</span> or <span>tried</span> to.<br/>
🎧 But what's the <span>problem</span>? Other people <span>write</span> like that!<br/>
🎧 No, maybe some people <span>write</span> <span>text</span> <span>messages</span> like that in an <span>SMS</span> <span>message</span> on their <span>phones</span>, but that is <span>completely</span> the wrong <span>style</span> for an <span>email</span> to a <span>client</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay Anna, let's <span>stop</span> <span>listening</span> to Tom, he's a <span>waste</span> of <span>space</span>. These are the <span>kinds</span> of <span>phrases</span> you need in a <span>business-related</span> <span>email:<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Dear</span> Mr Lime...<br/>
🎧 I hope you are well.<br/>
🎧 I am <span>writing</span> <span>regarding</span>...<br/>
🎧 Please could you <span>confirm</span>...<br/>
🎧 <span>Yours</span> <span>sincerely</span>, <span>or<br/></span>
🎧 Best <span>wishes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you! I'll <span>rewrite</span> my <span>message</span>. There! I'd better get it <span>checked</span> before I <span>send</span>. Denise?<br/>
🎧 <span>(On</span> the <span>phone)</span> <span>yes</span>... the other <span>problem</span> with <span>Stephanie</span> is that her <span>legs</span> are just too <span>long</span>...<br/>
🎧 Oh, she's on the phone.<br/>
🎧 <span></span>... yes, like <span>trees</span>...<br/>
🎧 I'll have to ask Tom. Tom?<br/>
🎧 <span>Mm</span>?<br/>
🎧 Could you read this through before I <span>send</span> it?<br/>
🎧 <span>Hang</span> on, Anna, let me just <span>finish</span> this <span>sentence</span>. <span>It's</span> really important. I'm ready, let's have a look. Okay. <span>(reading)</span> <span>Dear</span> Mr Lime, I hope you are well. I am <span>writing</span> <span>regarding</span> your <span>request</span> for <span>luxury</span> <span>boxes</span> for the <span>Imperial</span> <span>Lemon</span> <span>Delivery</span>. We will <span>indeed</span> be able to <span>supply</span> them. Please could you <span>confirm</span> that you want <span>300</span>. Best <span>wishes</span>, Anna.<br/>
🎧 Well?<br/>
🎧 <span>It's</span> good, it's much better. <span>Send</span> it. <span>Hopefully</span> Mr Lime will think your last <span>message</span> was just <span>someone</span> <span>sitting</span> on your <span>keyboard</span> by <span>mistake</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 You're <span>not</span>...<br/>
🎧 What?<br/>
🎧 <span>Nothing</span>. It's <span>none</span> of my <span>business</span>.<br/>
🎧 What?<br/>
🎧 You're not ever going to go to lunch with Mr Lime are you? I mean, in a <span>non-business</span> <span>way</span>...<br/>
🎧 No of course not!<br/>
🎧 I mean I don't <span>care</span>... it's <span>just</span>... important to... <span>stay</span> <span>professional</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmmm</span>.... well, I had a feeling <span>Anna's</span> <span>email</span> was going to <span>cause</span> <span>problems</span>. But at <span>least</span> she won't make a <span>mistake</span> like that again. <span>Here's</span> a <span>reminder</span> of the <span>phrases</span> she used in her new, <span>improved</span> <span>email</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Dear</span> Mr Lime...<br/>
🎧 I hope you are well.<br/>
🎧 I am <span>writing</span> <span>regarding</span>...<br/>
🎧 Please could you <span>confirm</span>...<br/>
🎧 Best <span>wishes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Until next time, bye!<br/>

🎧 Hello, it's a <span>chilly</span> start to the day at Tip Top <span>Trading</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hi Denise!<br/>
🎧 Good morning Anna.<br/>
🎧 <span>Brrr</span>... it's so <span>cold</span> in here.<br/>
🎧 The <span>window</span> was <span>left</span> open <span>overnight</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>papers</span> have been <span>blown</span> <span>everywhere</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mine</span> too! Tom was the last one here last <span>night</span> <span>–</span> it must've been him who <span>left</span> the <span>window</span> open.<br/>
🎧 <span>Brrr</span>.... Right then, to work! Oh, there's a <span>note</span> from Paul, it must've <span>fallen</span> off my <span>desk:</span> <span>'I</span> would like your <span>ideas</span> on our <span>stock</span> <span>management</span> <span>system</span> for our new <span>laser-curve</span> <span>fruit</span> <span>range</span>, so we know we can keep up with <span>demand</span>. Please <span>write</span> me a <span>couple</span> of <span>pages</span> of <span>suggestions</span> and leave it on my <span>desk</span>. I'll be back this <span>afternoon.'</span> Wow!

🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 Morning!<br/>
🎧 Hey, my <span>certificate</span> for <span>Plastic</span> <span>Pear</span> <span>Salesman</span> of the Year is on the <span>floor</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Right</span>... <span>stock</span> <span>management</span> <span>systems</span>... <span>stock-up</span> on your <span>laser-curved</span> <span>lemons</span> <span></span>... My first idea is to <span>calculate</span> the <span>total</span>....<br/>
🎧 Well, Anna has <span>finished</span> her <span>report</span> and <span>left</span> it on <span>Paul's</span> <span>desk</span>, but things aren't that simple. <span>Er</span>, Anna, there's going to be a <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh? A <span>problem</span>, <span>bbbbut<br/></span>...
🎧 Let me <span>teach</span> you some <span>phrases</span> you might need to <span>explain</span> that there's been a <span>mistake:<br/></span>
🎧 I think there's been a <span>misunderstanding</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Or:<br/></span>
🎧 There's been a bit of a <span>mix-up</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna:</span> But what <span>misunderstanding</span>? What <span>mix-up</span>?<br/>
🎧 You could also <span>use:<br/></span>

🎧 <span>All<br/></span>
🎧 Hello.<br/>
🎧 Tom, this is an <span>excellent</span> <span>piece</span> of work!<br/>
🎧 Sorry?<br/>
🎧 These are by <span>far</span> the best <span>ideas</span> you've ever had.<br/>
🎧 I don't <span>understand</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>PaulOur</span> <span>stock</span> <span>management</span> <span>system</span>!<br/>
🎧 Can I see? <span></span>... Oh, that's not <span>mine</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Eh</span>?<br/>
🎧 I think there's been a <span>misunderstanding</span>. I did it.<br/>
🎧 Paul <span>&</span> <span>Tom<br/></span>
🎧 You?<br/>
🎧 I got your <span>note</span> Paul, here.<br/>
🎧 No, no, that <span>note</span> was for Tom.<br/>
🎧 Oh, then there's been a bit of a <span>mix-up</span>.<br/>
🎧 Did you take that <span>note</span> from my <span>desk</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, no!<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> you <span>threw</span> my <span>pear</span> <span>salesman</span> <span>certificate</span> on the <span>floor</span> at the same time too!<br/>
🎧 I <span>didn't</span>! Let me <span>explain</span>. The <span>wind</span> must have <span>blown</span> the <span>note</span> for Tom under my <span>desk</span>.<br/>
🎧 Tom <span>left</span> the <span>window</span> open <span>overnight</span>. Our <span>papers</span> were <span>blown</span> all over the place.<br/>
🎧 I see, well, <span>golly</span> <span>gosh</span>. In that case, well done, Anna! <span>Excellent</span> work, even though you weren't <span>meant</span> to do it. And Tom, your <span>ideas</span> are still <span>welcome</span> of course. Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Sorry Tom.<br/>
🎧 What? Oh, I'm not <span>bothered</span>. I've still got some great <span>ideas</span> in my <span>head</span> <span>anyway</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, right! Let's leave Tom to get on with his <span>'great</span> <span>ideas'</span> and listen again those <span>phrases</span> Anna used to <span>explain</span> the <span>misunderstanding:<br/></span>
🎧 I think there's been a <span>misunderstanding</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's been a bit of a <span>mix-up</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let me <span>explain</span> what <span>happened</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, the <span>mix-up</span> gave Anna a <span>chance</span> to <span>shine</span> <span>–</span> Paul <span>certainly</span> <span>seemed</span> <span>impressed</span> with her work. Maybe it will <span>bring</span> her new <span>opportunities</span>. Until next time, bye!<br/>

🎧 Hello, <span>welcome</span> back to Tip Top <span>Trading</span>. An <span>office</span> <span>meeting</span> has been <span>scheduled</span>, but Paul is <span>running</span> <span>late</span>. He's <span>asked</span> Anna to take <span>charge</span> and start the <span>meeting</span> without him.<br/>
🎧 Here you go Anna, it's a <span>print-out</span> of the <span>agenda</span> for the <span>meeting</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you. Oh <span>dear</span>, I'm not sure if I know the right <span>words</span> to start <span>meetings</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, you can say something <span>like:</span> Thank you for <span>coming</span>. There are <span>five</span> <span>items</span> on the <span>agenda</span> today.<br/>
🎧 <span>Items</span>?<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>fancy</span> way of saying <span>'things'</span>. Then you <span>list</span> <span>them:</span> <span>Firstly</span>, <span>secondly</span>, after that, and then, finally...<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's easy.<br/>
🎧 At the end there is often something called Any other <span>business</span>.<br/>
🎧 Any other <span>business</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's anything else that wasn't <span>listed</span> on the <span>agenda</span>, but that people want to talk about. I <span>expect</span> Tom will want to talk about how great he is and Denise will want to talk about her new <span>hairdresser</span> or something. Then when it's time for the <span>meeting</span> to end, you can <span>say:</span> Let's <span>wrap</span> up. It <span>means</span> <span>'Let's</span> <span>finish'</span>.<br/>
🎧 To <span>wrap</span> up. OK, I'll do my best. <span>Ooh</span>, it's time, everyone is <span>gathering</span>. Thank <span>you</span>... thank you for <span>coming</span>. Paul will be here soon, but he <span>asked</span> me to start the <span>meeting</span>. There <span>are</span>... one, two, <span>three</span>, <span>four</span> <span>items</span> on the <span>agenda</span> today. <span>Firstly</span>, the <span>stock</span> <span>management</span> <span>systems</span>. <span>Secondly</span>, <span>plans</span> for a <span>team-building</span> <span>activity</span>. After that, the <span>colour</span> of our new <span>apples</span> and finally any other <span>business</span>, before we can <span>wrap</span> up.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>golly</span> <span>gosh</span>, there you are, here I am, good. Hello everyone. Sorry I'm <span>late</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd just <span>opened</span> the <span>meeting</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great. <span>Remind</span> me what the first <span>item</span> on the <span>agenda</span> is?<br/>
🎧 <span>Stock</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Stock</span>? <span>Stock</span>, <span>stock</span>, <span>stock</span>. Ah yes, <span>stock</span> <span>management</span> <span>systems</span>, yes, right. Well, that's <span>mainly</span> to <span>announce</span> that we need to start <span>developing</span> a good <span>stock</span> <span>management</span> <span>system</span> so we can meet the <span>huge</span> <span>demand</span> I'm <span>expecting</span> for these <span>laser-curved</span> <span>fruits</span>. Anna, I'd like you to <span>lead</span> on that. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Me? You want me to be in <span>charge</span> of the <span>stock</span> <span>management</span> <span>systems</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna's</span> had some <span>excellent</span> <span>ideas</span> already and I think she'll do a great <span>job</span>. For these new <span>fruits</span>, <span>stock</span> <span>control</span> will be key to <span>supplying</span> our <span>customers</span> with <span>laser-curve</span> <span>oranges</span>, <span>laser-curve</span> <span>lemons</span>, <span>laser-curve</span> <span>pomegramates<br/></span>...
🎧 Well, that was good <span>news</span> for Anna <span>-</span> but not <span>surprising</span> after all her <span>hard</span> work. She <span>opened</span> the <span>meeting</span> well, too. Here's a <span>reminder</span> of the <span>phrases</span> she <span>used:<br/></span>
🎧 Thank you for <span>coming</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>four</span> <span>items</span> on the <span>agenda</span> today.<br/>
🎧 <span>Firstly</span>...<br/>
🎧 <span>Secondly</span>...<br/>
🎧 After <span>that</span>...<br/>
🎧 <span>Then</span>...<br/>
🎧 And finally...<br/>
🎧 Any other <span>business</span>.<br/>
🎧 And then we can <span>wrap</span> up.<br/>
🎧 There's only one <span>problem</span> for Anna now, <span>winning</span> over Mr <span>Ingle</span> the <span>warehouse</span> <span>manager</span> <span>–</span> that <span>won't</span> be easy. Well, time for me to <span>wrap</span> up now. See you soon! Bye!<br/>
<span><br/></span>
