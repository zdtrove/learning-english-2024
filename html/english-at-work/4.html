🎧 Hello! You're joining us again after Anna's call from Mr Lime – he asked her to lunch, remember. Now Anna and Denise are flapping.<br/>
🎧 ...and before you know it, he'll be asking you to marry him! Trust me Anna, this has happened to me dozens of times!<br/>
🎧 But I thought he was only interested in the lemons! Please promise me you won't mention this to anyone.<br/>
🎧 OK, I promise.<br/>
🎧 Oh, shhhh!<br/>
🎧 Good morning. What's going on?<br/>
🎧 Mr Lime has asked Anna to lunch!<br/>
🎧 Please<br/>...
🎧 And?<br/>
🎧 And it's not to talk business! I saw him looking at her with big eyes, from the moment he first saw her!<br/>
🎧 Denise!<br/>
🎧 Old Slimy Limey eh? Lucky Anna!<br/>
🎧 He's not slimy, it's just<br/>...
🎧 Don't tell me you said yes?!<br/>
🎧 Well I didn't know what to say.<br/>
🎧 You didn't?<br/>
🎧 No, no, I said I was busy and would call back. I wanted to just say no, but with everyone complaining that I'm not polite on the phone... I just... I didn't know how to say it politely.<br/>
🎧 Ha ha, I'll tell you what to say.<br/>
🎧 Hang on, let me write it down... why do all the pens keep disappearing?<br/>
🎧 Here's one.<br/>
🎧 Thanks. Okay, I'm listening Tom.<br/>
🎧 Say: go...<br/>
🎧 (writing) go...<br/>
🎧 ...away... Slimy Limey.<br/>
🎧 Go away Slimy Limey. Are you sure?<br/>
🎧 Of course!<br/>
🎧 Don't listen to him Anna. This is what you should say:<br/>
🎧 Thank you for your offer. But I'm really sorry, I won't be able to.<br/>
🎧 Then explain why, say I'm afraid... blah blah blah<br/>
🎧 Blah blah blah?<br/>
🎧 Say it's against company policy to have non-business lunches with clients.<br/>
🎧 Meaning?<br/>
🎧 You're not allowed to if it's not for business. Then say:<br/>
🎧 It wouldn't be appropriate. So, with regret, I'm going to have to say no.<br/>
🎧 Okay, I think I've got that all down. Thanks. He'll be waiting for my call.<br/>
🎧 (dials phone)<br/>
🎧 Hello, Seb Lime speaking.<br/>
🎧 Hello Mr Lime.<br/>
🎧 Anna! Please, call me Seb. So, when can I invite you to lunch?<br/>
🎧 (whispering loudly) Thank you for your offer...<br/>
🎧 Well, thank you for your offer. But I'm really sorry, I won't be able to.<br/>
🎧 Oh?<br/>
🎧 (whispering loudly) I'm afraid...<br/>
🎧 I'm afraid it's against company policy to have non-business lunches with people.<br/>
🎧 Really? Oh how tedious!<br/>
🎧 (whispering loudly) It wouldn't be-<br/>
🎧 Shhh!<br/>
🎧 Pardon?<br/>
🎧 No, not shhh you Mr Slimy I meant shhhh Denise!<br/>
🎧 Mr Slimy?<br/>
🎧 Oh no! I mean Mr Limey – Lime – er Seb! You see, it wouldn't be appropriate. So, with regret, I'm going to have to say no.<br/>
🎧 I think I've understood. Goodbye Anna.<br/>
🎧 Goodbye.<br/>
🎧 Oh dear, he didn't take that too well. But, apart from a little mistake, Anna did well there. Here are the phrases she used to politely refuse the offer of lunch:<br/>
🎧 Thank you for your offer. But I'm really sorry, I won't be able to.<br/>
🎧 I'm afraid it is against company policy<br/>...
🎧 It wouldn't be appropriate.<br/>
🎧 With regret, I'm going to have to say no.<br/>
🎧 Good job Anna, bad luck Mr Slimy!<br/>

🎧 Welcome to the offices of Tip Top Trading...<br/>
🎧 (ongoing sound of annoying mobile phone ringtone)<br/>
🎧 Anna, are you going to answer that?<br/>
🎧 Er, well, no. It's stopped now anyway.<br/>
🎧 ...where Anna is behaving strangely.<br/>
🎧 (ringing starts again)<br/>
🎧 I gave you a long lesson on how to answer the phone and you're still too scared!<br/>
🎧 It's not that.<br/>
🎧 (desk phone starts ringing)<br/>
🎧 For goodness sake!<br/>
🎧 Then what?<br/>
🎧 I recognise the number - it's Mr Lime!<br/>
🎧 Ha! Old Slimy Limy, he must be absolutely desperate to get you to have lunch with him – even after your cruel rejection. Here, I'll answer for you.<br/>
🎧 No!<br/>
🎧 I'll answer. Hello, Tip Top Trading, Anna's phone... no, this is Denise speaking, Anna's busy at the moment. Can I take a message?... Yes... right.... I'll pass that on to her then... thank you for calling. Goodbye.<br/>
🎧 Well.<br/>
🎧 Nothing about lunch. He wants each Imperial Lemon you deliver to come in a luxury green box – like the one you had at the presentation.<br/>
🎧 My goodness, we don't have many in stock, I'll have to order some. Erm...(dials a number) Hello, this is Anna speaking from Tip Top Trading, I want some imperial lemon-sized luxury boxes.<br/>
🎧 Woah, woah, woah.<br/>
🎧 What?<br/>
🎧 Let's make this order a bit more politely okay?<br/>
🎧 Why are the English so obsessed with being polite!?<br/>
🎧 Calm down Anna and listen to me. To put in an order for something, you need phrases like:<br/>
🎧 I'd like to place an order for...<br/>
🎧 We're going to need...<br/>
🎧 Could you send...<br/>
🎧 Could we also have...<br/>
🎧 When can we expect to receive them?<br/>
🎧 Right... Hello, sorry about that... I'd like to place an order for some imperial lemon-sized luxury boxes, please... we're going to need quite a few... could you send 300 please... yes... the green ones... could we also have the name of our company on the sides... when can we expect to receive them...okay, thank you, goodbye. There! How was that?<br/>
🎧 Good, well done!<br/>
🎧 You'd better phone back Mr Lime to confirm he can have his boxes!<br/>
🎧 Oh no!<br/>
🎧 He's your client!<br/>
🎧 Yes Anna, he's your client!<br/>
🎧 I'm scared he'll try and ask about lunch again.<br/>
🎧 Then send him an email.<br/>
🎧 Good idea!<br/>
🎧 Copy in me, Tom and Paul, so it's clear you only mean business only.<br/>
🎧 Yes. Thanks Denise! An email is much safer.<br/>
🎧 Is it, Anna, is it? Hmmm...<br/>
🎧 Anyway, here are the phrases Anna used to place her order:<br/>
🎧 I'd like to place an order for...<br/>
🎧 We're going to need...<br/>
🎧 Could you send...<br/>
🎧 Could we also have...<br/>
🎧 When can we expect to receive them?<br/>
🎧 Let's see if Anna's email is really such a good idea. I have a bad feeling about it. Until next time!<br/>
<br/>

🎧 Hello, Anna's just arrived at her desk to start the day at Tip Top Trading. Paul is walking towards her, eating a biscuit, he looks a bit bothered.<br/>
🎧 Anna?<br/>
🎧 Yes, Paul.<br/>
🎧 Come and have a biscuit in my office.<br/>
🎧 Now Anna, about Mr Lime.<br/>
🎧 I didn't say yes!<br/>
🎧 Pardon? Yes to what?<br/>
🎧 Oh, nothing.<br/>
🎧 You sent him an email yesterday and copied me in.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Your email reads: boxes ok. pls c-d-u cfirm wnt 300 ta.<br/>
🎧 Yes: please could you confirm you want 300.<br/>
🎧 Right. Now that's not really the best way of writing an email to a client, is it?<br/>
🎧 Oh.<br/>
🎧 Please could you re-send your message to Mr Lime, using actual words that make sense.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Thank you. Have a chocolate crunchy!<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Morning Anna.<br/>
🎧 Hello.<br/>
🎧 Let me guess, Paul just spoke to you about your email?<br/>
🎧 How do you know?<br/>
🎧 You copied me in remember, I just read it – or tried to.<br/>
🎧 But what's the problem? Other people write like that!<br/>
🎧 No, maybe some people write text messages like that in an SMS message on their phones, but that is completely the wrong style for an email to a client.<br/>
🎧 Okay Anna, let's stop listening to Tom, he's a waste of space. These are the kinds of phrases you need in a business-related email:<br/>
🎧 Dear Mr Lime...<br/>
🎧 I hope you are well.<br/>
🎧 I am writing regarding...<br/>
🎧 Please could you confirm...<br/>
🎧 Yours sincerely, or<br/>
🎧 Best wishes.<br/>
🎧 Thank you! I'll rewrite my message. There! I'd better get it checked before I send. Denise?<br/>
🎧 (On the phone) yes... the other problem with Stephanie is that her legs are just too long...<br/>
🎧 Oh, she's on the phone.<br/>
🎧 ... yes, like trees...<br/>
🎧 I'll have to ask Tom. Tom?<br/>
🎧 Mm?<br/>
🎧 Could you read this through before I send it?<br/>
🎧 Hang on, Anna, let me just finish this sentence. It's really important. I'm ready, let's have a look. Okay. (reading) Dear Mr Lime, I hope you are well. I am writing regarding your request for luxury boxes for the Imperial Lemon Delivery. We will indeed be able to supply them. Please could you confirm that you want 300. Best wishes, Anna.<br/>
🎧 Well?<br/>
🎧 It's good, it's much better. Send it. Hopefully Mr Lime will think your last message was just someone sitting on your keyboard by mistake.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 You're not...<br/>
🎧 What?<br/>
🎧 Nothing. It's none of my business.<br/>
🎧 What?<br/>
🎧 You're not ever going to go to lunch with Mr Lime are you? I mean, in a non-business way...<br/>
🎧 No of course not!<br/>
🎧 I mean I don't care... it's just... important to... stay professional.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Hmmm.... well, I had a feeling Anna's email was going to cause problems. But at least she won't make a mistake like that again. Here's a reminder of the phrases she used in her new, improved email.<br/>
🎧 Dear Mr Lime...<br/>
🎧 I hope you are well.<br/>
🎧 I am writing regarding...<br/>
🎧 Please could you confirm...<br/>
🎧 Best wishes.<br/>
🎧 Until next time, bye!<br/>

🎧 Hello, it's a chilly start to the day at Tip Top Trading.<br/>
🎧 Hi Denise!<br/>
🎧 Good morning Anna.<br/>
🎧 Brrr... it's so cold in here.<br/>
🎧 The window was left open overnight.<br/>
🎧 My papers have been blown everywhere.<br/>
🎧 Mine too! Tom was the last one here last night – it must've been him who left the window open.<br/>
🎧 Brrr.... Right then, to work! Oh, there's a note from Paul, it must've fallen off my desk: 'I would like your ideas on our stock management system for our new laser-curve fruit range, so we know we can keep up with demand. Please write me a couple of pages of suggestions and leave it on my desk. I'll be back this afternoon.' Wow! I have to come up with ideas for a stock management system! Gosh, where do I begin?!<br/>
🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 Morning!<br/>
🎧 Hey, my certificate for Plastic Pear Salesman of the Year is on the floor!<br/>
🎧 Right... stock management systems... stock-up on your laser-curved lemons ... My first idea is to calculate the total....<br/>
🎧 Well, Anna has finished her report and left it on Paul's desk, but things aren't that simple. Er, Anna, there's going to be a problem.<br/>
🎧 Oh? A problem, bbbbut<br/>...
🎧 Let me teach you some phrases you might need to explain that there's been a mistake:<br/>
🎧 I think there's been a misunderstanding.<br/>
🎧 Or:<br/>
🎧 There's been a bit of a mix-up.<br/>
🎧 Anna: But what misunderstanding? What mix-up?<br/>
🎧 You could also use:<br/>
🎧 Let me explain what happened...<br/>
🎧 But-<br/>
🎧 Ah, good afternoon everyone.<br/>
🎧 All<br/>
🎧 Hello.<br/>
🎧 Tom, this is an excellent piece of work!<br/>
🎧 Sorry?<br/>
🎧 These are by far the best ideas you've ever had.<br/>
🎧 I don't understand.<br/>
🎧 PaulOur stock management system!<br/>
🎧 Can I see? ... Oh, that's not mine.<br/>
🎧 Eh?<br/>
🎧 I think there's been a misunderstanding. I did it.<br/>
🎧 Paul & Tom<br/>
🎧 You?<br/>
🎧 I got your note Paul, here.<br/>
🎧 No, no, that note was for Tom.<br/>
🎧 Oh, then there's been a bit of a mix-up.<br/>
🎧 Did you take that note from my desk?<br/>
🎧 No, no!<br/>
🎧 I suppose you threw my pear salesman certificate on the floor at the same time too!<br/>
🎧 I didn't! Let me explain. The wind must have blown the note for Tom under my desk.<br/>
🎧 Tom left the window open overnight. Our papers were blown all over the place.<br/>
🎧 I see, well, golly gosh. In that case, well done, Anna! Excellent work, even though you weren't meant to do it. And Tom, your ideas are still welcome of course. Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Sorry Tom.<br/>
🎧 What? Oh, I'm not bothered. I've still got some great ideas in my head anyway.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, right! Let's leave Tom to get on with his 'great ideas' and listen again those phrases Anna used to explain the misunderstanding:<br/>
🎧 I think there's been a misunderstanding.<br/>
🎧 There's been a bit of a mix-up.<br/>
🎧 Let me explain what happened.<br/>
🎧 Well, the mix-up gave Anna a chance to shine – Paul certainly seemed impressed with her work. Maybe it will bring her new opportunities. Until next time, bye!<br/>

🎧 Hello, welcome back to Tip Top Trading. An office meeting has been scheduled, but Paul is running late. He's asked Anna to take charge and start the meeting without him.<br/>
🎧 Here you go Anna, it's a print-out of the agenda for the meeting.<br/>
🎧 Thank you. Oh dear, I'm not sure if I know the right words to start meetings.<br/>
🎧 Well, you can say something like: Thank you for coming. There are five items on the agenda today.<br/>
🎧 Items?<br/>
🎧 It's a fancy way of saying 'things'. Then you list them: Firstly, secondly, after that, and then, finally...<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's easy.<br/>
🎧 At the end there is often something called Any other business.<br/>
🎧 Any other business?<br/>
🎧 That's anything else that wasn't listed on the agenda, but that people want to talk about. I expect Tom will want to talk about how great he is and Denise will want to talk about her new hairdresser or something. Then when it's time for the meeting to end, you can say: Let's wrap up. It means 'Let's finish'.<br/>
🎧 To wrap up. OK, I'll do my best. Ooh, it's time, everyone is gathering. Thank you... thank you for coming. Paul will be here soon, but he asked me to start the meeting. There are... one, two, three, four items on the agenda today. Firstly, the stock management systems. Secondly, plans for a team-building activity. After that, the colour of our new apples and finally any other business, before we can wrap up.<br/>
🎧 Oh golly gosh, there you are, here I am, good. Hello everyone. Sorry I'm late.<br/>
🎧 I'd just opened the meeting.<br/>
🎧 Great. Remind me what the first item on the agenda is?<br/>
🎧 Stock.<br/>
🎧 Stock? Stock, stock, stock. Ah yes, stock management systems, yes, right. Well, that's mainly to announce that we need to start developing a good stock management system so we can meet the huge demand I'm expecting for these laser-curved fruits. Anna, I'd like you to lead on that. <br/>
🎧 Me? You want me to be in charge of the stock management systems?<br/>
🎧 Anna's had some excellent ideas already and I think she'll do a great job. For these new fruits, stock control will be key to supplying our customers with laser-curve oranges, laser-curve lemons, laser-curve pomegramates<br/>...
🎧 Well, that was good news for Anna - but not surprising after all her hard work. She opened the meeting well, too. Here's a reminder of the phrases she used:<br/>
🎧 Thank you for coming.<br/>
🎧 There are four items on the agenda today.<br/>
🎧 Firstly...<br/>
🎧 Secondly...<br/>
🎧 After that...<br/>
🎧 Then...<br/>
🎧 And finally...<br/>
🎧 Any other business.<br/>
🎧 And then we can wrap up.<br/>
🎧 There's only one problem for Anna now, winning over Mr Ingle the warehouse manager – that won't be easy. Well, time for me to wrap up now. See you soon! Bye!<br/>
<br/>
