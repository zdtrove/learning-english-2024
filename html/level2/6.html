🎧 Let's see. Today I might go fly a kite, or maybe go for a swim. <br/> 
🎧 It is hot outside, and I don't know what to do. <br/> 
🎧 My mom tells me that I should do something that I like doing on hot days. <br/> 
🎧 Since our house is nice and cool, I guess I'll stay inside and work on my hobby.<br/>
🎧 My hobby is something that not a lot of people do. <br/> 
🎧 I make and collect bookmarks.<br/>
🎧 To make my bookmarks, I use stickers, and special art pencils to draw. <br/> 
🎧 I buy the stickers at a mall, usually in a card store. <br/> 
🎧 The art pencils are bought in an art store. <br/> 
🎧 To make the bookmarks, I start with a piece of paper. <br/> 
🎧 I measure out how big I want the bookmark to be with a ruler. <br/> 
🎧 I once made a bookmark so big, that it couldn't even be used in a very big book! <br/> 
🎧 After I measure it, I draw lines so that I can cut it straight. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes, I use fancy scissors that cut zig-zags or frills. <br/> 
🎧 Then I start to decorate them.<br/>
🎧 I like to draw cartoons and flowers on my bookmarks. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes, I even put real flowers on them. <br/> 
🎧 A lot of the time I write little sayings on the bookmarks. <br/> 
🎧 I like to give my bookmarks to friends and family. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes, I even sell my bookmarks to people.<br/>
🎧 I like my hobby. I can draw whatever I want on the bookmarks. <br/> 
🎧 Maybe sometime in the future I will be a famous bookmark maker and even have my own store

🎧 If I had a million dollars, I'd travel the world. <br/> 
🎧 I would go to the highest mountain. <br/> 
🎧 I would swim the deepest sea. <br/> 
🎧 I would probably buy a lot of clothes because I love clothes! <br/> 
🎧 More than anything though, I would want to visit Ireland.<br/>
🎧 I want to see the rolling hills and the green, green grass that everyone talks about. <br/> 
🎧 When I think of Ireland, I think of where my family came from many years ago. <br/> 
🎧 I am almost all Irish and would love to see my family over in Ireland.<br/>
🎧 If I had a million dollars, I would buy a Mustang or a Pontiac Sunbird car. <br/> 
🎧 I would buy a nice house with a big backyard and an outdoor and indoor pool. <br/> 
🎧 I would love to take my family wherever they wanted to go. <br/> 
🎧 I would buy them wonderful presents, too.<br/>
🎧 However, I know that money does not buy happiness. <br/> 
🎧 It does not buy you friends or family. <br/> 
🎧 It may bring some happiness only for the moment, but in the long run your family is what will be there for you if you love them and are there for them.<br/>
🎧 If I had to pick between a million dollars and my family, I would pick my family. <br/> 
🎧 The million dollars is a nice dream. <br/> 
🎧 If that dream ever comes true and I do get a lot of money, I hope I would use it wisely

🎧 What a great day for a picnic! We're not only having a picnic; we're having a big bike ride, too. <br/> 
🎧 We did this last year with a lot of friends also. It was really fun.<br/>
🎧 We meet quite early in the morning in a pretty little town. <br/> 
🎧 The town is where the Niagara River flows into Lake Ontario in Canada. <br/> 
🎧 The town's name is Niagara-on-the-Lake. <br/> 
🎧 Then all of the people, fifty or more, get on their bikes or roller blades. <br/> 
🎧 We go on a bike path beside the river. <br/> 
🎧 The path we take is about 11 km or 6 miles long. <br/> 
🎧 There are a lot of other people using the path, too.<br/>
🎧 We usually stop for an ice cream treat near the end or where we turn around to go back to our cars. <br/> 
🎧 It is just before the park where we will have our picnic, and a steep hill. <br/> 
🎧 Many of the men and boys go up the hill. <br/> 
🎧 Most of the women and children go back to their cars.<br/>
🎧 The ride takes about two hours plus whatever time we take at the ice cream store.<br/>
🎧 After the ride is finished, we go the park. <br/> 
🎧 We have a delicious "pot-luck" lunch. <br/> 
🎧 Pot luck means everyone brings some food to share with the others. <br/> 
🎧 We eat, rest, talk and laugh.<br/>
🎧 After we've cleaned up, some of us climb the tower that is there remembering a war at that place and its general. <br/> 
🎧 It is a steep climb, over l00 steps. <br/> 
🎧 We usually end the day with a fun game of baseball or soccer.<br/>
🎧 Finally, we pack up our stuff. <br/> 
🎧 Tired and dirty, we head for home with good memories swimming in our heads

🎧 I live in a house that has a small yard around it. <br/> 
🎧 In my yard there is a lawn and a garden.<br/>
🎧 There is also a sidewalk that leads to my front door, and a driveway that leads to my garage. <br/> 
🎧 Throughout the year I work to maintain my yard.<br/>
🎧 During the summer, I cut the grass that grows in my yard, using a lawn-mower. <br/> 
🎧 I like the smell of the grass when it has just been cut. <br/> 
🎧 But it's better not to cut the grass too short. <br/> 
🎧 When the weather is dry, I also put water on the lawn and garden, so that the grass and flowers can grow.<br/>
🎧 During the autumn, many leaves fall from the trees in my yard. <br/> 
🎧 I use a rake to collect the leaves from the lawn. <br/> 
🎧 Then I can put the leaves into bags. <br/> 
🎧 I can use the leaves to make fertilizer. <br/> 
🎧 When I was a kid, I didn't like the job of raking leaves, but now I don't mind it.<br/>
🎧 Another job during the autumn is to remove flowers from the garden before the cold weather arrives.<br/>
🎧 During the winter, there is no work to do in the lawn or garden, because they are covered in snow. <br/> 
🎧 But I need to keep the snow off my sidewalk and driveway. <br/> 
🎧 Whenever it snows, I use a shovel to clear the snow from the sidewalk and the driveway. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes it snows a lot. <br/> 
🎧 If I didn't shovel the snow, it would soon be impossible to get into my house!<br/> 
🎧 During the spring, the snow melts. <br/> 
🎧 I clean up my yard by sweeping away dirt and by removing weeds from the lawn and garden. <br/> 
🎧 I also put flowers back into the garden. <br/> 
🎧 It's nice to see them again after the long, cold winter. <br/> 
🎧 When spring comes, the grass grows very quickly, so I need to cut the grass quite often.<br/>
🎧 Working in the yard can be very satisfying work. It's so nice when the lawn and garden are looking green and healthy

🎧 When I was a kid, I always enjoyed visiting the zoo. <br/> 
🎧 My family lived far away from the zoo, so we didn't go there very often. <br/> 
🎧 But whenever we went to the zoo, I always had a fun and interesting time. <br/> 
🎧 Some of the animals were very large. <br/> 
🎧 Of course, the elephants were huge, and they had such an unusual appearance, with their big ears and their long trunk and tusks. <br/> 
🎧 The giraffes were very tall, with long necks that reached high into the trees.<br/>
🎧 Some of my favorite animals were the big cats. <br/> 
🎧 The lions looked very powerful, with their big teeth and paws. <br/> 
🎧 The tigers were just as big and strong, with yellow and black stripes.<br/>
🎧 But the bears were even larger than these cats. <br/> 
🎧 The polar bears, with their bright white fur, liked to swim through the water. <br/> 
🎧 The grizzly bears had brown fur and liked to roam around on land.<br/>
🎧 The animals from Australia seemed very unusual. <br/> 
🎧 The kangaroos, with their strong legs and long tail, could jump great distances across the ground. <br/> 
🎧 The baby kangaroo could go inside its mother's pouch. <br/> 
🎧 Another Australian animal, the koala bear, crawled slowly in the trees, where it ate leaves.<br/>
🎧 The monkeys and apes were also very interesting. <br/> 
🎧 In many ways, they reminded me of people. <br/> 
🎧 Some of the monkeys were very small. <br/> 
🎧 They could use their arms, legs, and tail to swing through the trees. <br/> 
🎧 Some of the apes were very large. <br/> 
🎧 The gorilla was the largest of all. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes a big gorilla would stand up and pound his fists on his chest.<br/>
🎧 To see all the animals at the zoo took almost a whole day. <br/> 
🎧 By the end of the day, I was very tired from walking around. <br/> 
🎧 But I was also very happy to see all the amazing animals from places around the world

🎧 Little Annie was very bored one lazy afternoon. <br/> 
🎧 She had nothing to do! She had already played with her brothers in the sandbox and had tea with them and her dollies, too. <br/> 
🎧 She had baked chocolate chip cookies with her mom and even tasted one! <br/> 
🎧 They were very good, she thought. <br/> 
🎧 Now Annie was trying to figure out what else she could do to pass the day away.<br/>
🎧 Little Annie decided that she would go to her favourite spot in the world...the green, grassy field full of daisies, beneath the great oak tree. <br/> 
🎧 She took a red and white blanket with her. <br/> 
🎧 She laid it down on the ground, and then she lay down on it. <br/> 
🎧 She lay there looking at the clouds, fluffy and white. <br/> 
🎧 She saw bunnies, huge gray elephants and scarylooking crocodiles. <br/> 
🎧 Soon, Little Annie was drifting in and out of clouds and reality. <br/> 
🎧 The clouds started dancing with her, begging her to come and play. <br/> 
🎧 She got up from her blanket and joined the clouds. <br/> 
🎧 They flew over roof tops of all of the village people, swam with the fish in the lake and said hello to all of the birds that they passed by. <br/> 
🎧 Little Annie was having so much fun!<br/> 
🎧 The clouds had formed into a chariot so Little Annie could drive if she wanted to. <br/> 
🎧 She drove over a rainbow that was bright in the sky. <br/> 
🎧 Then, she shot through the branches of her friend's spruce tree!<br/> 
🎧 Annie suddenly came to a STOP! <br/> 
🎧 Hearing someone call her name, Annie looked around.<br/>
🎧 She blinked; once, twice, and finally everything came into focus. <br/> 
🎧 Her brother was tugging at her leg, wondering why she was staring into outer space with a big grin on her face!<br/> 
🎧 "Oh," Little Annie said, not really knowing that she had been sitting there all along
