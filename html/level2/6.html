🎧 Let's see. <span>Today</span> I <span>might</span> go fly a <span>kite</span>, or <span>maybe</span> go for a <span>swim</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It is hot <span>outside</span>, and I don't know what to do. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 My mom <span>tells</span> me that I should do <span>something</span> that I like doing on hot <span>days</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Since</span> our <span>house</span> is nice and <span>cool</span>, I <span>guess</span> I'll <span>stay</span> <span>inside</span> and work on my <span>hobby</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>hobby</span> is <span>something</span> that not a lot of people do. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I make and <span>collect</span> <span>bookmarks</span>.<br/>
🎧 To make my <span>bookmarks</span>, I use <span>stickers</span>, and special art <span>pencils</span> to <span>draw</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I buy the <span>stickers</span> at a <span>mall</span>, usually in a <span>card</span> <span>store</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The art <span>pencils</span> are <span>bought</span> in an art <span>store</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 To make the <span>bookmarks</span>, I <span>start</span> with a <span>piece</span> of <span>paper</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>measure</span> out how big I want the <span>bookmark</span> to be with a <span>ruler</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>once</span> made a <span>bookmark</span> so big, that it couldn't even be used in a very big book! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>After</span> I <span>measure</span> it, I <span>draw</span> <span>lines</span> so that I can cut it <span>straight</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span>, I use <span>fancy</span> <span>scissors</span> that cut <span>zig-zags</span> or <span>frills</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Then</span> I <span>start</span> to <span>decorate</span> them.<br/>
🎧 I like to <span>draw</span> <span>cartoons</span> and <span>flowers</span> on my <span>bookmarks</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span>, I even put <span>real</span> <span>flowers</span> on them. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 A lot of the time I <span>write</span> little <span>sayings</span> on the <span>bookmarks</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I like to give my <span>bookmarks</span> to <span>friends</span> and <span>family</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span>, I even <span>sell</span> my <span>bookmarks</span> to people.<br/>
🎧 I like my <span>hobby</span>. I can <span>draw</span> <span>whatever</span> I want on the <span>bookmarks</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Maybe</span> sometime in the <span>future</span> I will be a <span>famous</span> <span>bookmark</span> <span>maker</span> and even have my own <span>store!<br/>

🎧 <span>If</span> I had a <span>million</span> <span>dollars</span>, <span>I'd</span> <span>travel</span> the <span>world</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I would go to the <span>highest</span> <span>mountain</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I would <span>swim</span> the <span>deepest</span> sea. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I would <span>probably</span> buy a lot of <span>clothes</span> <span>because</span> I love <span>clothes</span>! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>More</span> than <span>anything</span> <span>though</span>, I would want to <span>visit</span> <span>Ireland</span>.<br/>
🎧 I want to see the <span>rolling</span> <span>hills</span> and the <span>green</span>, <span>green</span> <span>grass</span> that <span>everyone</span> <span>talks</span> about. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 When I think of <span>Ireland</span>, I think of where my <span>family</span> <span>came</span> from many <span>years</span> ago. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I am <span>almost</span> all <span>Irish</span> and would love to see my <span>family</span> over in <span>Ireland</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>If</span> I had a <span>million</span> <span>dollars</span>, I would buy a <span>Mustang</span> or a <span>Pontiac</span> <span>Sunbird</span> car. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I would buy a nice <span>house</span> with a big <span>backyard</span> and an <span>outdoor</span> and <span>indoor</span> <span>pool</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I would love to take my <span>family</span> <span>wherever</span> they <span>wanted</span> to go. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I would buy them <span>wonderful</span> <span>presents</span>, <span>too</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, I know that <span>money</span> <span>does</span> not buy <span>happiness</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It <span>does</span> not buy you <span>friends</span> or <span>family</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It may <span>bring</span> some <span>happiness</span> only for the <span>moment</span>, but in the long run your <span>family</span> is what will be there for you if you love them and are there for them.<br/>
🎧 <span>If</span> I had to <span>pick</span> <span>between</span> a <span>million</span> <span>dollars</span> and my <span>family</span>, I would <span>pick</span> my <span>family</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 What a <span>great</span> day for a <span>picnic</span>! We're not only <span>having</span> a <span>picnic;</span> we're <span>having</span> a big <span>bike</span> <span>ride</span>, too. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We did this last <span>year</span> with a lot of <span>friends</span> also. It was <span>really</span> <span>fun</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>meet</span> <span>quite</span> <span>early</span> in the <span>morning</span> in a <span>pretty</span> little <span>town</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>town</span> is where the <span>Niagara</span> <span>River</span> <span>flows</span> into <span>Lake</span> <span>Ontario</span> in <span>Canada</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>town's</span> <span>name</span> is <span>Niagara-on-the-Lake</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Then</span> all of the people, <span>fifty</span> or more, get on their <span>bikes</span> or <span>roller</span> <span>blades</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We go on a <span>bike</span> <span>path</span> <span>beside</span> the <span>river</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>path</span> we take is about <span>11</span> <span>km</span> or <span>6</span> <span>miles</span> long. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There are a lot of other people <span>using</span> the <span>path</span>, <span>too</span>.<br/>
🎧 We usually <span>stop</span> for an ice <span>cream</span> <span>treat</span> <span>near</span> the end or where we <span>turn</span> around to go back to our <span>cars</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It is just <span>before</span> the <span>park</span> where we will have our <span>picnic</span>, and a <span>steep</span> <span>hill</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 many of the men and <span>boys</span> go up the <span>hill</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Most</span> of the <span>women</span> and <span>children</span> go back to their <span>cars</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>ride</span> <span>takes</span> about two <span>hours</span> <span>plus</span> <span>whatever</span> time we take at the ice <span>cream</span> <span>store</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>After</span> the <span>ride</span> is <span>finished</span>, we go the <span>park</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We have a <span>delicious</span> <span>"pot-luck"</span> <span>lunch</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Pot <span>luck</span> <span>means</span> <span>everyone</span> <span>brings</span> some <span>food</span> to <span>share</span> with the <span>others</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We eat, <span>rest</span>, talk and <span>laugh</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>After</span> <span>we've</span> <span>cleaned</span> up, some of us <span>climb</span> the <span>tower</span> that is there <span>remembering</span> a war at that <span>place</span> and its <span>general</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It is a <span>steep</span> <span>climb</span>, over <span>l00</span> <span>steps</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We usually end the day with a fun <span>game</span> of <span>baseball</span> or <span>soccer</span>.<br/>

🎧 I live in a <span>house</span> that has a small <span>yard</span> around it. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>In</span> my <span>yard</span> there is a <span>lawn</span> and a <span>garden</span>.<br/>
🎧 There is also a <span>sidewalk</span> that <span>leads</span> to my <span>front</span> <span>door</span>, and a <span>driveway</span> that <span>leads</span> to my <span>garage</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Throughout</span> the <span>year</span> I work to <span>maintain</span> my <span>yard</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>During</span> the <span>summer</span>, I cut the <span>grass</span> that <span>grows</span> in my <span>yard</span>, <span>using</span> a <span>lawn-mower</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I like the <span>smell</span> of the <span>grass</span> when it has just <span>been</span> cut. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 But it's better not to cut the <span>grass</span> too <span>short</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 When the <span>weather</span> is dry, I also put <span>water</span> on the <span>lawn</span> and <span>garden</span>, so that the <span>grass</span> and <span>flowers</span> can <span>grow</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>During</span> the <span>autumn</span>, many <span>leaves</span> <span>fall</span> from the <span>trees</span> in my <span>yard</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I use a <span>rake</span> to <span>collect</span> the <span>leaves</span> from the <span>lawn</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Then</span> I can put the <span>leaves</span> into <span>bags</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I can use the <span>leaves</span> to make <span>fertilizer</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 When I was a kid, I didn't like the job of <span>raking</span> <span>leaves</span>, but now I don't <span>mind</span> it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Another</span> job during the <span>autumn</span> is to <span>remove</span> <span>flowers</span> from the <span>garden</span> <span>before</span> the <span>cold</span> <span>weather</span> <span>arrives</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>During</span> the <span>winter</span>, there is no work to do in the <span>lawn</span> or <span>garden</span>, <span>because</span> they are <span>covered</span> in <span>snow</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 But I need to keep the <span>snow</span> off my <span>sidewalk</span> and <span>driveway</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Whenever</span> it <span>snows</span>, I use a <span>shovel</span> to <span>clear</span> the <span>snow</span> from the <span>sidewalk</span> and the <span>driveway</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span> it <span>snows</span> a lot. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>If</span> I didn't <span>shovel</span> the <span>snow</span>, it would soon be <span>impossible</span> to get into my <span>house!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>During</span> the <span>spring</span>, the <span>snow</span> <span>melts</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>clean</span> up my <span>yard</span> by <span>sweeping</span> away <span>dirt</span> and by <span>removing</span> <span>weeds</span> from the <span>lawn</span> and <span>garden</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I also put <span>flowers</span> back into the <span>garden</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It's nice to see them <span>again</span> <span>after</span> the long, <span>cold</span> <span>winter</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 When <span>spring</span> <span>comes</span>, the <span>grass</span> <span>grows</span> very <span>quickly</span>, so I need to cut the <span>grass</span> <span>quite</span> <span>often</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Working</span> in the <span>yard</span> can be very <span>satisfying</span> work. It's so nice when the <span>lawn</span> and <span>garden</span> are <span>looking</span> <span>green</span> and <span>healthy.<br/>

🎧 When I was a kid, I always <span>enjoyed</span> <span>visiting</span> the zoo. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 My <span>family</span> <span>lived</span> far away from the zoo, so we didn't go there very <span>often</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 But <span>whenever</span> we <span>went</span> to the zoo, I always had a fun and <span>interesting</span> time. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Some of the <span>animals</span> were very <span>large</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Of</span> <span>course</span>, the <span>elephants</span> were <span>huge</span>, and they had such an <span>unusual</span> <span>appearance</span>, with their big <span>ears</span> and their long <span>trunk</span> and <span>tusks</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>giraffes</span> were very <span>tall</span>, with long <span>necks</span> that <span>reached</span> high into the <span>trees</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some of my <span>favorite</span> <span>animals</span> were the big <span>cats</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>lions</span> <span>looked</span> very <span>powerful</span>, with their big <span>teeth</span> and <span>paws</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>tigers</span> were just as big and <span>strong</span>, with <span>yellow</span> and <span>black</span> <span>stripes</span>.<br/>
🎧 But the <span>bears</span> were even <span>larger</span> than these <span>cats</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>polar</span> <span>bears</span>, with their <span>bright</span> <span>white</span> fur, <span>liked</span> to <span>swim</span> <span>through</span> the <span>water</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>grizzly</span> <span>bears</span> had <span>brown</span> fur and <span>liked</span> to <span>roam</span> around on <span>land</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>animals</span> from <span>Australia</span> <span>seemed</span> very <span>unusual</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>kangaroos</span>, with their <span>strong</span> <span>legs</span> and long <span>tail</span>, <span>could</span> <span>jump</span> <span>great</span> <span>distances</span> across the <span>ground</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>baby</span> <span>kangaroo</span> <span>could</span> go <span>inside</span> its <span>mother's</span> <span>pouch</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Another</span> <span>Australian</span> <span>animal</span>, the <span>koala</span> <span>bear</span>, <span>crawled</span> <span>slowly</span> in the <span>trees</span>, where it ate <span>leaves</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>monkeys</span> and <span>apes</span> were also very <span>interesting</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>In</span> many <span>ways</span>, they <span>reminded</span> me of people. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Some of the <span>monkeys</span> were very small. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They <span>could</span> use their <span>arms</span>, <span>legs</span>, and <span>tail</span> to <span>swing</span> <span>through</span> the <span>trees</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Some of the <span>apes</span> were very <span>large</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>gorilla</span> was the <span>largest</span> of all. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span> a big <span>gorilla</span> would <span>stand</span> up and <span>pound</span> his <span>fists</span> on his <span>chest</span>.<br/>
🎧 To see all the <span>animals</span> at the zoo took <span>almost</span> a <span>whole</span> day. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 By the end of the day, I was very <span>tired</span> from <span>walking</span> around. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 But I was also very happy to see all the <span>amazing</span> <span>animals</span> from <span>places</span> around the <span>world.<br/>
