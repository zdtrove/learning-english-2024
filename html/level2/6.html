🎧 Let's see. <span>Today</span> I <span>might</span> <span>go</span> fly a <span>kite</span>, <span>or</span> <span>maybe</span> <span>go</span> for a <span>swim</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>It</span> <span>is</span> hot <span>outside</span>, and I don't <span>know</span> what to do. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 My mom <span>tells</span> me <span>that</span> I <span>should</span> do <span>something</span> <span>that</span> I <span>like</span> <span>doing</span> <span>on</span> hot <span>days</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Since</span> our <span>house</span> <span>is</span> <span>nice</span> and <span>cool</span>, I <span>guess</span> <span>I'll</span> <span>stay</span> <span>inside</span> and <span>work</span> <span>on</span> my <span>hobby</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>hobby</span> <span>is</span> <span>something</span> <span>that</span> not a lot <span>of</span> <span>people</span> do. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>make</span> and <span>collect</span> <span>bookmarks</span>.<br/>
🎧 To <span>make</span> my <span>bookmarks</span>, I use <span>stickers</span>, and <span>special</span> art <span>pencils</span> to <span>draw</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I buy the <span>stickers</span> <span>at</span> a <span>mall</span>, <span>usually</span> <span>in</span> a <span>card</span> <span>store</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The art <span>pencils</span> are <span>bought</span> <span>in</span> an art <span>store</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 To <span>make</span> the <span>bookmarks</span>, I <span>start</span> <span>with</span> a <span>piece</span> <span>of</span> <span>paper</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>measure</span> out how big I <span>want</span> the <span>bookmark</span> to be <span>with</span> a <span>ruler</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>once</span> <span>made</span> a <span>bookmark</span> so big, <span>that</span> <span>it</span> couldn't <span>even</span> be <span>used</span> <span>in</span> a <span>very</span> big <span>book</span>! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>After</span> I <span>measure</span> <span>it</span>, I <span>draw</span> <span>lines</span> so <span>that</span> I can cut <span>it</span> <span>straight</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span>, I use <span>fancy</span> <span>scissors</span> <span>that</span> cut <span>zig-zags</span> <span>or</span> <span>frills</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Then</span> I <span>start</span> to <span>decorate</span> <span>them</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>like</span> to <span>draw</span> <span>cartoons</span> and <span>flowers</span> <span>on</span> my <span>bookmarks</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span>, I <span>even</span> put <span>real</span> <span>flowers</span> <span>on</span> <span>them</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 A lot <span>of</span> the <span>time</span> I <span>write</span> <span>little</span> <span>sayings</span> <span>on</span> the <span>bookmarks</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>like</span> to <span>give</span> my <span>bookmarks</span> to <span>friends</span> and <span>family</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span>, I <span>even</span> <span>sell</span> my <span>bookmarks</span> to <span>people</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>like</span> my <span>hobby</span>. I can <span>draw</span> <span>whatever</span> I <span>want</span> <span>on</span> the <span>bookmarks</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Maybe</span> <span>sometime</span> <span>in</span> the <span>future</span> I <span>will</span> be a <span>famous</span> <span>bookmark</span> <span>maker</span> and <span>even</span> have my <span>own</span> <span>store!<br/>

🎧 <span>If</span> I had a <span>million</span> <span>dollars</span>, <span>I'd</span> <span>travel</span> the <span>world</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>would</span> <span>go</span> to the <span>highest</span> <span>mountain</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>would</span> <span>swim</span> the <span>deepest</span> sea. <span><br/></span>

🎧 I <span>live</span> <span>in</span> a <span>house</span> <span>that</span> has a <span>small</span> <span>yard</span> <span>around</span> <span>it</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>In</span> my <span>yard</span> there <span>is</span> a <span>lawn</span> and a <span>garden</span>.<br/>
🎧 There <span>is</span> <span>also</span> a <span>sidewalk</span> <span>that</span> <span>leads</span> to my <span>front</span> <span>door</span>, and a <span>driveway</span> <span>that</span> <span>leads</span> to my <span>garage</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Throughout</span> the <span>year</span> I <span>work</span> to <span>maintain</span> my <span>yard</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>During</span> the <span>summer</span>, I cut the <span>grass</span> <span>that</span> <span>grows</span> <span>in</span> my <span>yard</span>, <span>using</span> a <span>lawn-mower</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>like</span> the <span>smell</span> <span>of</span> the <span>grass</span> when <span>it</span> has <span>just</span> <span>been</span> cut. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 But it's <span>better</span> not to cut the <span>grass</span> too <span>short</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 When the <span>weather</span> <span>is</span> dry, I <span>also</span> put <span>water</span> <span>on</span> the <span>lawn</span> and <span>garden</span>, so <span>that</span> the <span>grass</span> and <span>flowers</span> can <span>grow</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>During</span> the <span>autumn</span>, <span>many</span> <span>leaves</span> <span>fall</span> <span>from</span> the <span>trees</span> <span>in</span> my <span>yard</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I use a <span>rake</span> to <span>collect</span> the <span>leaves</span> <span>from</span> the <span>lawn</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Then</span> I can put the <span>leaves</span> <span>into</span> <span>bags</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I can use the <span>leaves</span> to <span>make</span> <span>fertilizer</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 When I was a kid, I didn't <span>like</span> the <span>job</span> <span>of</span> <span>raking</span> <span>leaves</span>, but now I don't <span>mind</span> <span>it</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Another</span> <span>job</span> <span>during</span> the <span>autumn</span> <span>is</span> to <span>remove</span> <span>flowers</span> <span>from</span> the <span>garden</span> <span>before</span> the <span>cold</span> <span>weather</span> <span>arrives</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>During</span> the <span>winter</span>, there <span>is</span> <span>no</span> <span>work</span> to do <span>in</span> the <span>lawn</span> <span>or</span> <span>garden</span>, <span>because</span> <span>they</span> are <span>covered</span> <span>in</span> <span>snow</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 But I <span>need</span> to <span>keep</span> the <span>snow</span> off my <span>sidewalk</span> and <span>driveway</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Whenever</span> <span>it</span> <span>snows</span>, I use a <span>shovel</span> to <span>clear</span> the <span>snow</span> <span>from</span> the <span>sidewalk</span> and the <span>driveway</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span> <span>it</span> <span>snows</span> a lot. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>If</span> I didn't <span>shovel</span> the <span>snow</span>, <span>it</span> <span>would</span> <span>soon</span> be <span>impossible</span> to get <span>into</span> my <span>house!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>During</span> the <span>spring</span>, the <span>snow</span> <span>melts</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>clean</span> <span>up</span> my <span>yard</span> by <span>sweeping</span> <span>away</span> <span>dirt</span> and by <span>removing</span> <span>weeds</span> <span>from</span> the <span>lawn</span> and <span>garden</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>also</span> put <span>flowers</span> <span>back</span> <span>into</span> the <span>garden</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It's <span>nice</span> to see <span>them</span> <span>again</span> <span>after</span> the <span>long</span>, <span>cold</span> <span>winter</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 When <span>spring</span> <span>comes</span>, the <span>grass</span> <span>grows</span> <span>very</span> <span>quickly</span>, so I <span>need</span> to cut the <span>grass</span> <span>quite</span> <span>often</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Working</span> <span>in</span> the <span>yard</span> can be <span>very</span> <span>satisfying</span> <span>work</span>. It's so <span>nice</span> when the <span>lawn</span> and <span>garden</span> are <span>looking</span> <span>green</span> and <span>healthy.<br/>

🎧 I had to <span>clamp</span> <span>down</span> <span>on</span> <span>something</span> <span>that</span> <span>felt</span> <span>like</span> <span>rubber</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She put a big <span>camera-type</span> <span>machine</span> <span>right</span> <span>next</span> to my <span>cheek</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She did <span>this</span> <span>on</span> the <span>other</span> <span>side</span> <span>of</span> my <span>face</span> <span>as</span> <span>well</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>They</span> <span>took</span> two <span>pictures</span> <span>of</span> my <span>teeth</span>. <span>It</span> was <span>really</span> <span>cool</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>dentist</span> <span>told</span> me my <span>teeth</span> <span>were</span> <span>perfect</span>! <span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>Little</span> <span>Annie</span> was <span>very</span> <span>bored</span> one <span>lazy</span> <span>afternoon</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She had <span>nothing</span> to do! She had <span>already</span> <span>played</span> <span>with</span> her <span>brothers</span> <span>in</span> the <span>sandbox</span> and had tea <span>with</span> <span>them</span> and her <span>dollies</span>, too. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She had <span>baked</span> <span>chocolate</span> <span>chip</span> <span>cookies</span> <span>with</span> her mom and <span>even</span> <span>tasted</span> one! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>They</span> <span>were</span> <span>very</span> <span>good</span>, she <span>thought</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Now <span>Annie</span> was <span>trying</span> to <span>figure</span> out what <span>else</span> she <span>could</span> do to <span>pass</span> the day <span>away</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Little</span> <span>Annie</span> <span>decided</span> <span>that</span> she <span>would</span> <span>go</span> to her <span>favourite</span> <span>spot</span> <span>in</span> the <span>world...the</span> <span>green</span>, <span>grassy</span> <span>field</span> <span>full</span> <span>of</span> <span>daisies</span>, <span>beneath</span> the <span>great</span> oak <span>tree</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She <span>took</span> a red and <span>white</span> <span>blanket</span> <span>with</span> her. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She <span>laid</span> <span>it</span> <span>down</span> <span>on</span> the <span>ground</span>, and <span>then</span> she lay <span>down</span> <span>on</span> <span>it</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She lay there <span>looking</span> <span>at</span> the <span>clouds</span>, <span>fluffy</span> and <span>white</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She saw <span>bunnies</span>, <span>huge</span> <span>gray</span> <span>elephants</span> and <span>scarylooking</span> <span>crocodiles</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Soon</span>, <span>Little</span> <span>Annie</span> was <span>drifting</span> <span>in</span> and out <span>of</span> <span>clouds</span> and <span>reality</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>clouds</span> <span>started</span> <span>dancing</span> <span>with</span> her, <span>begging</span> her to <span>come</span> and <span>play</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She got <span>up</span> <span>from</span> her <span>blanket</span> and <span>joined</span> the <span>clouds</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>They</span> <span>flew</span> <span>over</span> <span>roof</span> <span>tops</span> <span>of</span> all <span>of</span> the <span>village</span> <span>people</span>, <span>swam</span> <span>with</span> the <span>fish</span> <span>in</span> the <span>lake</span> and <span>said</span> <span>hello</span> to all <span>of</span> the <span>birds</span> <span>that</span> <span>they</span> <span>passed</span> by. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Little</span> <span>Annie</span> was <span>having</span> so <span>much</span> <span>fun!<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>clouds</span> had <span>formed</span> <span>into</span> a <span>chariot</span> so <span>Little</span> <span>Annie</span> <span>could</span> <span>drive</span> <span>if</span> she <span>wanted</span> to. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She <span>drove</span> <span>over</span> a <span>rainbow</span> <span>that</span> was <span>bright</span> <span>in</span> the sky. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Then</span>, she <span>shot</span> <span>through</span> the <span>branches</span> <span>of</span> her <span>friend's</span> <span>spruce</span> <span>tree!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Annie</span> <span>suddenly</span> <span>came</span> to a <span>STOP</span>! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hearing</span> <span>someone</span> <span>call</span> her <span>name</span>, <span>Annie</span> <span>looked</span> <span>around</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>blinked;</span> <span>once</span>, <span>twice</span>, and <span>finally</span> <span>everything</span> <span>came</span> <span>into</span> <span>focus</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Her <span>brother</span> was <span>tugging</span> <span>at</span> her leg, <span>wondering</span> why she was <span>staring</span> <span>into</span> <span>outer</span> <span>space</span> <span>with</span> a big <span>grin</span> <span>on</span> her <span>face!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>"Oh,"</span> <span>Little</span> <span>Annie</span> <span>said</span>, not <span>really</span> <span>knowing</span> <span>that</span> she had <span>been</span> <span>sitting</span> there all <span>along.<br/>
