🎧 Let's see. Today I might go fly a <span>kite</span>, or maybe go for a <span>swim</span>. <br/> 
🎧 It is hot outside, and I don't know what to do. <br/> 
🎧 My mom tells me that I should do something that I like doing on hot <span>days</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Since our house is nice and <span>cool</span>, I <span>guess</span> I'll <span>stay</span> inside and work on my hobby.<br/>
🎧 My hobby is something that not a lot of people do. <br/> 
🎧 I make and <span>collect</span> <span>bookmarks</span>.<br/>
🎧 To make my <span>bookmarks</span>, I use <span>stickers</span>, and special art <span>pencils</span> to <span>draw</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I buy the <span>stickers</span> at a <span>mall</span>, usually in a <span>card</span> <span>store</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The art <span>pencils</span> are <span>bought</span> in an art <span>store</span>. <br/> 
🎧 To make the <span>bookmarks</span>, I start with a <span>piece</span> of <span>paper</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I <span>measure</span> out how big I want the <span>bookmark</span> to be with a <span>ruler</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I once made a <span>bookmark</span> so big, that it couldn't even be used in a very big book! <br/> 
🎧 After I <span>measure</span> it, I <span>draw</span> <span>lines</span> so that I can cut it <span>straight</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes, I use <span>fancy</span> <span>scissors</span> that cut <span>zig-zags</span> or <span>frills</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Then</span> I start to <span>decorate</span> them.<br/>
🎧 I like to <span>draw</span> <span>cartoons</span> and <span>flowers</span> on my <span>bookmarks</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes, I even put <span>real</span> <span>flowers</span> on them. <br/> 
🎧 A lot of the time I <span>write</span> little <span>sayings</span> on the <span>bookmarks</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I like to give my <span>bookmarks</span> to friends and <span>family</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes, I even sell my <span>bookmarks</span> to people.<br/>
🎧 I like my hobby. I can <span>draw</span> whatever I want on the <span>bookmarks</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Maybe sometime in the future I will be a famous <span>bookmark</span> <span>maker</span> and even have my own <span>store

🎧 If I had a <span>million</span> <span>dollars</span>, I'd travel the <span>world</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I would go to the <span>highest</span> <span>mountain</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I would <span>swim</span> the <span>deepest</span> sea. <br/> 
🎧 I would probably buy a lot of <span>clothes</span> because I love <span>clothes</span>! <br/> 
🎧 <span>More</span> than anything though, I would want to visit <span>Ireland</span>.<br/>
🎧 I want to see the <span>rolling</span> <span>hills</span> and the <span>green</span>, <span>green</span> <span>grass</span> that everyone <span>talks</span> about. <br/> 
🎧 When I think of <span>Ireland</span>, I think of where my <span>family</span> came from many years ago. <br/> 
🎧 I am almost all <span>Irish</span> and would love to see my <span>family</span> over in <span>Ireland</span>.<br/>
🎧 If I had a <span>million</span> <span>dollars</span>, I would buy a <span>Mustang</span> or a <span>Pontiac</span> <span>Sunbird</span> car. <br/> 
🎧 I would buy a nice house with a big <span>backyard</span> and an <span>outdoor</span> and <span>indoor</span> <span>pool</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I would love to take my <span>family</span> <span>wherever</span> they wanted to go. <br/> 
🎧 I would buy them <span>wonderful</span> <span>presents</span>, too.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, I know that money does not buy <span>happiness</span>. <br/> 
🎧 It does not buy you friends or <span>family</span>. <br/> 
🎧 It may <span>bring</span> some <span>happiness</span> only for the <span>moment</span>, but in the long run your <span>family</span> is what will be there for you if you love them and are there for them.<br/>
🎧 If I had to <span>pick</span> between a <span>million</span> <span>dollars</span> and my <span>family</span>, I would <span>pick</span> my <span>family</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>million</span> <span>dollars</span> is a nice <span>dream</span>. <br/> 
🎧 If that <span>dream</span> ever comes <span>true</span> and I do get a lot of money, I hope I would use it <span>wisely

🎧 What a great day for a <span>picnic</span>! We're not only having a <span>picnic;</span> we're having a big <span>bike</span> <span>ride</span>, too. <br/> 
🎧 We did this last year with a lot of friends also. It was really fun.<br/>
🎧 We meet quite <span>early</span> in the morning in a <span>pretty</span> little <span>town</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>town</span> is where the <span>Niagara</span> <span>River</span> <span>flows</span> into <span>Lake</span> <span>Ontario</span> in <span>Canada</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>town's</span> name is <span>Niagara-on-the-Lake</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Then</span> all of the people, <span>fifty</span> or more, get on their <span>bikes</span> or <span>roller</span> <span>blades</span>. <br/> 
🎧 We go on a <span>bike</span> <span>path</span> <span>beside</span> the <span>river</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>path</span> we take is about <span>11</span> <span>km</span> or <span>6</span> <span>miles</span> long. <br/> 
🎧 There are a lot of other people <span>using</span> the <span>path</span>, too.<br/>
🎧 We usually <span>stop</span> for an ice <span>cream</span> <span>treat</span> near the end or where we <span>turn</span> around to go back to our <span>cars</span>. <br/> 
🎧 It is just before the <span>park</span> where we will have our <span>picnic</span>, and a <span>steep</span> <span>hill</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Many of the men and <span>boys</span> go up the <span>hill</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Most</span> of the <span>women</span> and <span>children</span> go back to their <span>cars</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>ride</span> takes about two hours <span>plus</span> whatever time we take at the ice <span>cream</span> <span>store</span>.<br/>
🎧 After the <span>ride</span> is <span>finished</span>, we go the <span>park</span>. <br/> 
🎧 We have a <span>delicious</span> <span>"pot-luck"</span> lunch. <br/> 
🎧 Pot <span>luck</span> <span>means</span> everyone <span>brings</span> some food to share with the <span>others</span>. <br/> 
🎧 We eat, <span>rest</span>, talk and <span>laugh</span>.<br/>
🎧 After we've <span>cleaned</span> up, some of us <span>climb</span> the <span>tower</span> that is there <span>remembering</span> a war at that place and its <span>general</span>. <br/> 
🎧 It is a <span>steep</span> <span>climb</span>, over <span>l00</span> <span>steps</span>. <br/> 
🎧 We usually end the day with a fun game of <span>baseball</span> or <span>soccer</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Finally</span>, we <span>pack</span> up our <span>stuff</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Tired</span> and <span>dirty</span>, we <span>head</span> for home with good <span>memories</span> <span>swimming</span> in our <span>heads

</div>
🎧 I live in a house that has a small <span>yard</span> around it. <br/> 
🎧 In my <span>yard</span> there is a <span>lawn</span> and a garden.<br/>
🎧 There is also a <span>sidewalk</span> that <span>leads</span> to my <span>front</span> <span>door</span>, and a <span>driveway</span> that <span>leads</span> to my <span>garage</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Throughout</span> the year I work to <span>maintain</span> my <span>yard</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>During</span> the <span>summer</span>, I cut the <span>grass</span> that <span>grows</span> in my <span>yard</span>, <span>using</span> a <span>lawn-mower</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I like the <span>smell</span> of the <span>grass</span> when it has just been cut. <br/> 
🎧 But it's better not to cut the <span>grass</span> too short. <br/> 
🎧 When the <span>weather</span> is dry, I also put water on the <span>lawn</span> and garden, so that the <span>grass</span> and <span>flowers</span> can <span>grow</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>During</span> the <span>autumn</span>, many leaves <span>fall</span> from the <span>trees</span> in my <span>yard</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I use a <span>rake</span> to <span>collect</span> the leaves from the <span>lawn</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Then</span> I can put the leaves into <span>bags</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I can use the leaves to make <span>fertilizer</span>. <br/> 
🎧 When I was a kid, I didn't like the job of <span>raking</span> leaves, but now I don't <span>mind</span> it.<br/>
🎧 Another job during the <span>autumn</span> is to <span>remove</span> <span>flowers</span> from the garden before the <span>cold</span> <span>weather</span> <span>arrives</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>During</span> the <span>winter</span>, there is no work to do in the <span>lawn</span> or garden, because they are <span>covered</span> in <span>snow</span>. <br/> 
🎧 But I need to keep the <span>snow</span> off my <span>sidewalk</span> and <span>driveway</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Whenever</span> it <span>snows</span>, I use a <span>shovel</span> to <span>clear</span> the <span>snow</span> from the <span>sidewalk</span> and the <span>driveway</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes it <span>snows</span> a lot. <br/> 
🎧 If I didn't <span>shovel</span> the <span>snow</span>, it would soon be <span>impossible</span> to get into my <span>house</span>!<br/> 
🎧 <span>During</span> the <span>spring</span>, the <span>snow</span> <span>melts</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I <span>clean</span> up my <span>yard</span> by <span>sweeping</span> away <span>dirt</span> and by <span>removing</span> <span>weeds</span> from the <span>lawn</span> and garden. <br/> 
🎧 I also put <span>flowers</span> back into the garden. <br/> 
🎧 It's nice to see them again after the long, <span>cold</span> <span>winter</span>. <br/> 
🎧 When <span>spring</span> comes, the <span>grass</span> <span>grows</span> very quickly, so I need to cut the <span>grass</span> quite often.<br/>
🎧 Working in the <span>yard</span> can be very <span>satisfying</span> work. It's so nice when the <span>lawn</span> and garden are <span>looking</span> <span>green</span> and <span>healthy
</span>.<br/><br/>

🎧 In this <span>perfect</span> place I have <span>learned</span> so much. <br/>

🎧 When I was a kid, I always <span>enjoyed</span> <span>visiting</span> the zoo. <br/> 
🎧 My <span>family</span> <span>lived</span> far away from the zoo, so we didn't go there very often. <br/> 
🎧 But <span>whenever</span> we went to the zoo, I always had a fun and <span>interesting</span> time. <br/> 
🎧 Some of the <span>animals</span> were very <span>large</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Of course, the <span>elephants</span> were <span>huge</span>, and they had such an <span>unusual</span> <span>appearance</span>, with their big <span>ears</span> and their long <span>trunk</span> and <span>tusks</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>giraffes</span> were very <span>tall</span>, with long <span>necks</span> that <span>reached</span> high into the <span>trees</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some of my <span>favorite</span> <span>animals</span> were the big <span>cats</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>lions</span> <span>looked</span> very <span>powerful</span>, with their big <span>teeth</span> and <span>paws</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>tigers</span> were just as big and <span>strong</span>, with <span>yellow</span> and <span>black</span> <span>stripes</span>.<br/>
🎧 But the <span>bears</span> were even <span>larger</span> than these <span>cats</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>polar</span> <span>bears</span>, with their <span>bright</span> <span>white</span> fur, <span>liked</span> to <span>swim</span> through the water. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>grizzly</span> <span>bears</span> had <span>brown</span> fur and <span>liked</span> to <span>roam</span> around on <span>land</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>animals</span> from <span>Australia</span> <span>seemed</span> very <span>unusual</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>kangaroos</span>, with their <span>strong</span> <span>legs</span> and long <span>tail</span>, could <span>jump</span> great <span>distances</span> across the <span>ground</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>baby</span> <span>kangaroo</span> could go inside its <span>mother's</span> <span>pouch</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Another <span>Australian</span> <span>animal</span>, the <span>koala</span> <span>bear</span>, <span>crawled</span> <span>slowly</span> in the <span>trees</span>, where it ate leaves.<br/>
🎧 The <span>monkeys</span> and <span>apes</span> were also very <span>interesting</span>. <br/> 
🎧 In many <span>ways</span>, they <span>reminded</span> me of people. <br/> 
🎧 Some of the <span>monkeys</span> were very small. <br/> 
🎧 They could use their <span>arms</span>, <span>legs</span>, and <span>tail</span> to <span>swing</span> through the <span>trees</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Some of the <span>apes</span> were very <span>large</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>gorilla</span> was the <span>largest</span> of all. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes a big <span>gorilla</span> would <span>stand</span> up and <span>pound</span> his <span>fists</span> on his <span>chest</span>.<br/>
🎧 To see all the <span>animals</span> at the zoo took almost a whole day. <br/> 
🎧 By the end of the day, I was very <span>tired</span> from <span>walking</span> around. <br/> 
🎧 But I was also very happy to see all the <span>amazing</span> <span>animals</span> from <span>places</span> around the <span>world

🎧 My <span>dentist</span> called my house the other day. <br/> 
🎧 He told me I <span>needed</span> my <span>teeth</span> <span>cleaned</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I set up an <span>appointment</span> to see him on <span>Saturday</span>, <span>June</span> <span>l0th</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I got to my <span>dentist's</span> <span>office</span>, I had to sit in the <span>waiting</span> room. <br/> 
🎧 There were other people <span>ahead</span> of me. <br/> 
🎧 They <span>finally</span> called my name.<br/>
🎧 I went into his room and <span>sat</span> down on a big <span>blue</span> <span>chair</span>. <br/> 
🎧 They <span>leaned</span> it back. <br/> 
🎧 A <span>bright</span> <span>light</span> was <span>turned</span> on. <br/> 
🎧 It <span>hurt</span> my <span>eyes</span>, so I <span>closed</span> them. <br/> 
🎧 My <span>dentist</span> <span>asked</span> me to open my <span>mouth</span>.<br/>
🎧 I did. I thought my <span>mouth</span> was very big, but he told me to open it even <span>wider</span>!<br/> 
🎧 <span>Soon</span> he <span>began</span> <span>poking</span> around to see if I had any <span>cavities</span>. <br/> 
🎧 He <span>flossed</span> my <span>teeth</span> and put <span>fluoride</span> around my <span>teeth</span> too. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>fluoride</span> <span>tasted</span> like <span>bubble</span> <span>gum</span>.<br/>
🎧 I had to <span>spit</span> into a <span>dish-like</span> <span>bowl</span>. <br/> 
🎧 It <span>squirted</span> out water. <br/> 
🎧 My <span>dentist</span> <span>kept</span> <span>asking</span> me <span>questions</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I couldn't answer because there were <span>weird</span> <span>tools</span> in my <span>mouth</span>! <br/> 
🎧 When I <span>tried</span> <span>answering</span> back, he <span>seemed</span> to <span>understand</span> though.<br/>
🎧 His <span>helper</span> came into the room. She <span>asked</span> me to open my <span>mouth</span> again. <br/> 
🎧 I had to <span>clamp</span> down on something that <span>felt</span> like <span>rubber</span>. <br/> 
🎧 She put a big <span>camera-type</span> <span>machine</span> right next to my <span>cheek</span>. <br/> 
🎧 She did this on the other side of my <span>face</span> as well. <br/> 
🎧 They took two <span>pictures</span> of my <span>teeth</span>. It was really <span>cool</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>dentist</span> told me my <span>teeth</span> were <span>perfect</span>! <br/> 
🎧 I didn't have any <span>problems</span>. I could go home.<br/>
🎧 <span>"See</span> you next <span>year,"</span> he <span>said

🎧 <span>Little</span> <span>Annie</span> was very <span>bored</span> one <span>lazy</span> <span>afternoon</span>. <br/> 
🎧 She had <span>nothing</span> to do! She had already <span>played</span> with her <span>brothers</span> in the <span>sandbox</span> and had tea with them and her <span>dollies</span>, too. <br/> 
🎧 She had <span>baked</span> <span>chocolate</span> <span>chip</span> <span>cookies</span> with her mom and even <span>tasted</span> one! <br/> 
🎧 They were very good, she thought. <br/> 
🎧 Now <span>Annie</span> was trying to <span>figure</span> out what else she could do to <span>pass</span> the day away.<br/>
🎧 <span>Little</span> <span>Annie</span> <span>decided</span> that she would go to her <span>favourite</span> <span>spot</span> in the <span>world...the</span> <span>green</span>, <span>grassy</span> <span>field</span> full of <span>daisies</span>, <span>beneath</span> the great oak <span>tree</span>. <br/> 
🎧 She took a red and <span>white</span> <span>blanket</span> with her. <br/> 
🎧 She <span>laid</span> it down on the <span>ground</span>, and then she lay down on it. <br/> 
🎧 She lay there <span>looking</span> at the <span>clouds</span>, <span>fluffy</span> and <span>white</span>. <br/> 
🎧 She saw <span>bunnies</span>, <span>huge</span> <span>gray</span> <span>elephants</span> and <span>scarylooking</span> <span>crocodiles</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Soon</span>, <span>Little</span> <span>Annie</span> was <span>drifting</span> in and out of <span>clouds</span> and <span>reality</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>clouds</span> <span>started</span> <span>dancing</span> with her, <span>begging</span> her to come and play. <br/> 
🎧 She got up from her <span>blanket</span> and <span>joined</span> the <span>clouds</span>. <br/> 
🎧 They <span>flew</span> over <span>roof</span> <span>tops</span> of all of the <span>village</span> people, <span>swam</span> with the <span>fish</span> in the <span>lake</span> and said hello to all of the <span>birds</span> that they <span>passed</span> by. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Little</span> <span>Annie</span> was having so much <span>fun</span>!<br/> 
🎧 The <span>clouds</span> had <span>formed</span> into a <span>chariot</span> so <span>Little</span> <span>Annie</span> could drive if she wanted to. <br/> 
🎧 She <span>drove</span> over a <span>rainbow</span> that was <span>bright</span> in the sky. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Then</span>, she <span>shot</span> through the <span>branches</span> of her <span>friend's</span> <span>spruce</span> <span>tree</span>!<br/> 
🎧 <span>Annie</span> <span>suddenly</span> came to a <span>STOP</span>! <br/> 
🎧 <span>Hearing</span> someone call her name, <span>Annie</span> <span>looked</span> around.<br/>
🎧 She <span>blinked;</span> once, <span>twice</span>, and <span>finally</span> everything came into focus. <br/> 
🎧 Her <span>brother</span> was <span>tugging</span> at her leg, <span>wondering</span> why she was <span>staring</span> into <span>outer</span> <span>space</span> with a big <span>grin</span> on her <span>face</span>!<br/> 
🎧 <span>"Oh,"</span> <span>Little</span> <span>Annie</span> said, not really <span>knowing</span> that she had been <span>sitting</span> there all <span>along
</span>.<br/><br/><br/>
