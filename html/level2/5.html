🎧 What <span>does</span> the <span>word</span> <span>"family"</span> <span>mean</span> to you? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>easiest</span> way to <span>define</span> <span>family</span> <span>is</span> to <span>talk</span> <span>about</span> who you are <span>related</span> to. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Usually</span>, there <span>is</span> a mom and a dad and <span>children</span> who are <span>brothers</span> and <span>sisters</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>This</span> <span>would</span> be the <span>"core"</span> <span>family</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Then</span> there <span>is</span> the <span>"extended"</span> <span>family</span> which <span>would</span> <span>include</span> <span>grandparents</span>, <span>aunts</span> and <span>uncles</span>, <span>cousins</span>, <span>nieces</span> and <span>nephews</span> and <span>in-laws</span> <span>(people</span> <span>married</span> to your <span>bothers</span> <span>or</span> <span>sisters</span>, <span>husband</span> <span>or</span> <span>wife).<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>However</span>, I <span>think</span> the <span>word</span> <span>"family"</span> has a <span>much</span> <span>deeper</span> <span>meaning</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>word</span> <span>"family"</span> <span>brings</span> <span>words</span> to my <span>mind</span> <span>like:</span> <span>love</span>, <span>support</span>, <span>help</span>, <span>kindness</span>, fun, <span>love</span>, <span>trips</span>, <span>closeness</span>, <span>love</span>, <span>forgiving</span>, <span>sharing</span>, <span>love</span>, <span>understanding</span>, <span>respect</span> and <span>love</span>! <span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>LOVE</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>believe</span> <span>if</span> a <span>family</span> has <span>real</span> <span>love</span> for one <span>another</span>, <span>they</span> <span>will</span> be <span>able</span> to <span>overcome</span> any <span>problems</span> <span>they</span> may have. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Actually</span>, <span>they</span> may not have too <span>many</span> <span>problems</span> <span>if</span> <span>they</span> all <span>love</span> and <span>respect</span> one <span>another</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>It</span> <span>is</span> <span>during</span> <span>those</span> <span>hard</span> <span>times</span> <span>that</span> a <span>family's</span> <span>love</span> <span>helps</span> <span>them</span> to <span>go</span> <span>through</span> <span>those</span> <span>experiences.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>We</span> had <span>quite</span> a few <span>children</span> <span>in</span> my <span>family</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There <span>were</span> <span>brothers</span> and <span>sisters</span> which <span>included</span> an <span>adopted</span> <span>brother</span> and a <span>number</span> <span>of</span> <span>foster</span> <span>children</span>, too. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I was <span>also</span> <span>very</span> <span>fortunate</span> <span>that</span> I had <span>both</span> my mom and dad to <span>live</span> <span>with</span> and do <span>things</span> <span>like</span> <span>vacations</span> <span>together</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>We</span> had a lot <span>of</span> fun and there <span>were</span> <span>some</span> <span>times</span> <span>of</span> <span>tears</span>, too. <span><br/></span>

🎧 I <span>work</span> <span>at</span> a <span>conservation</span> <span>park</span> <span>called</span> <span>Ball's</span> <span>Falls</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I've <span>only</span> <span>worked</span> there for <span>three</span> <span>weeks</span> now. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>am</span> a <span>Tour</span> <span>Guide</span>, and I <span>tell</span> <span>people</span> the <span>history</span> <span>of</span> all the old <span>buildings</span> <span>there.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Somebody</span> <span>told</span> me <span>that</span> one <span>of</span> the <span>houses</span> I <span>work</span> <span>in</span> <span>is</span> <span>haunted</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Now I get <span>chills</span> <span>every</span> <span>time</span> I <span>walk</span> <span>into</span> <span>that</span> <span>house</span>! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 My <span>boss</span> <span>told</span> me <span>that</span> the <span>stories</span> aren't <span>real</span>, but I have an <span>active</span> <span>imagination!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Ball's</span> <span>Falls</span> <span>is</span> <span>very</span> <span>beautiful</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>It</span> has two <span>different</span> <span>water</span> <span>falls</span>, the <span>Upper</span> <span>Falls</span> and the <span>Lower</span> <span>Falls</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There <span>used</span> to be <span>tons</span> <span>of</span> <span>water</span> <span>cascading</span> <span>over</span> <span>them</span>, which <span>turned</span> a big <span>water</span> <span>wheel</span> to <span>grind</span> <span>grain</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>However</span>, <span>through</span> the <span>years</span> the <span>amount</span> <span>of</span> <span>water</span> has <span>really</span> <span>lessened.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>love</span> <span>working</span> <span>at</span> <span>Ball's</span> <span>Falls</span> <span>because</span> I get to <span>work</span> <span>outside</span> a lot. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>am</span> <span>getting</span> a tan! <span>In</span> <span>July</span> and <span>August</span>, I <span>will</span> be <span>working</span> <span>with</span> <span>kids</span> there <span>at</span> a day <span>camp</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>am</span> <span>getting</span> <span>ready</span> now, <span>making</span> <span>different</span> <span>crafts</span> and <span>thinking</span> <span>up</span> fun new <span>games</span> to <span>play</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I can't <span>wait</span> to <span>start</span> <span>working</span> <span>with</span> <span>them</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>think</span> <span>that</span> <span>will</span> be the <span>best</span> <span>part</span> <span>of</span> the <span>summer.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>will</span> be <span>going</span> to <span>work</span> <span>again</span> <span>tomorrow</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>usually</span> have to <span>work</span> <span>from</span> <span>9</span> <span>a.m</span>. to <span>4:30</span> <span>p.m</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>also</span> <span>like</span> the <span>people</span> I <span>work</span> <span>with</span>. <span>They</span> are <span>very</span> <span>nice.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Come</span> to <span>Ball's</span> <span>Falls</span>, and <span>I'll</span> <span>give</span> you a <span>tour!<br/>
