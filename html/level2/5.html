🎧 I am <span>curious</span> about many <span>things</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would like to find the <span>answers</span> to a lot of <span>questions</span> that I have.<br/>
🎧 What <span>holds</span> the <span>stars</span> up in the <span>sky?<br/></span> 
🎧 Why <span>does</span> ice <span>form</span> on the top of the <span>lake</span> when it is <span>cold?<br/></span> 
🎧 Is there life on other <span>planets?<br/></span> 
🎧 Why do we not <span>fall</span> off the <span>face</span> of the <span>earth?<br/></span> 
🎧 How do <span>caterpillars</span> <span>turn</span> into <span>butterflies?<br/></span> 
🎧 All of these <span>things</span> are <span>mysteries</span> to me.<br/>
🎧 There are so many <span>questions</span> that are <span>unanswered</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think I should go to the <span>library</span> and get a book to find out why people <span>grow</span> <span>old</span>.<br/>
🎧 What <span>makes</span> a <span>television</span> <span>work?<br/></span> 
🎧 I also want to know where <span>electricity</span> <span>comes</span> from.<br/>
🎧 Who is the <span>strongest</span> person in the <span>world?<br/></span> 
🎧 Who is the <span>smartest</span> person in the <span>world?<br/></span> 
🎧 Why do some people have <span>blonde</span> <span>hair</span>, and some people have <span>black</span> <span>hair?<br/></span>

🎧 I <span>wonder</span> if I'll <span>ever</span> find out the <span>answers</span> to all my <span>questions</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think I'll have to <span>study</span> <span>hard</span> and <span>stay</span> in school to find out <span>everything</span> that I want to know.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>questions</span> <span>never</span> get <span>answered</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is good to be <span>curious</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>People</span> who are <span>curious</span> about <span>things</span> are the <span>ones</span> who learn a lot, and some <span>curious</span> people go on to <span>invent</span> <span>things</span> and make <span>important</span> <span>discoveries.<br/>

🎧 Some people are just <span>born</span> to <span>create</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's what I think.<br/>
🎧 Some people just have the need to <span>write</span> <span>stories</span>, <span>compose</span> <span>beautiful</span> music, or <span>paint</span> <span>pictures</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Creativity</span> <span>seems</span> to be inside them, and they need to let it out.<br/>
🎧 It's good that we have people like that.<br/>
🎧 <span>Composers</span> like <span>Mozart</span> and <span>Chopin</span> have <span>given</span> us music that is <span>incredibly</span> <span>beautiful</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's not just the <span>classical</span> <span>composers</span> who have <span>given</span> us <span>great</span> <span>pieces</span> of <span>music;</span> there are <span>modern</span> <span>composers</span> who have <span>written</span> <span>great</span> <span>songs</span> also.<br/>
🎧 <span>Elton</span> <span>John</span> is an example of <span>someone</span> who has <span>composed</span> many <span>wonderful</span> <span>songs</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Andrew</span> <span>Lloyd</span> <span>Webber</span> has <span>given</span> us some very <span>popular</span> <span>musicals</span> like <span>Cats</span> and The <span>Phantom</span> of the <span>Opera</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are so many <span>talented</span> and <span>creative</span> people in this <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you visit an art <span>gallery</span>, you <span>marvel</span> at how <span>artists</span> are <span>able</span> to <span>recreate</span> <span>realism</span> or make up <span>something</span> that <span>seems</span> <span>totally</span> <span>unreal</span> yet <span>beautiful</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>American</span> <span>artist</span> <span>Norman</span> <span>Rockwell</span> <span>painted</span> some <span>pictures</span> that <span>actually</span> <span>looked</span> like <span>photographs</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>tried</span> to <span>portray</span> life as it was in <span>America</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Through</span> his <span>paintings</span>, one can get a good <span>sense</span> of <span>American</span> life <span>through</span> the years.<br/>
🎧 <span>On</span> the other <span>hand</span>, <span>artists</span> like <span>Jackson</span> <span>Pollock</span> did not <span>portray</span> <span>realism</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Jackson</span> <span>Pollock</span> <span>painted</span> <span>abstract</span> <span>pictures</span>.<br/>
🎧 His <span>paintings</span> are just as good as <span>Norman</span> <span>Rockwell's</span>, but they are <span>entirely</span> different.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>books</span> that we read are <span>classics</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mark</span> <span>Twain</span> <span>portrayed</span> <span>American</span> life <span>through</span> his <span>characters</span> <span>Tom</span> <span>Sawyer</span> and <span>Huckleberry</span> <span>Finn</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Charles</span> <span>Dickens</span> <span>brought</span> <span>Victorian</span> <span>England</span> to life <span>through</span> his <span>books</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Most</span> people are <span>familiar</span> with his <span>Christmas</span> <span>Carol</span> where the mean and <span>miserable</span> <span>Scrooge</span> <span>learns</span> the <span>true</span> <span>meaning</span> of <span>Christmas</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>People</span> don't have to read the <span>classics</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>modern</span> <span>writers</span> who <span>entertain</span> <span>readers</span> <span>through</span> their <span>stories</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Stephen</span> <span>King</span> has <span>written</span> a <span>number</span> of <span>horror</span> <span>stories</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some of his <span>books</span> have even been made into <span>movies</span>.<br/>
🎧 We are <span>lucky</span> to have <span>creative</span> people who <span>share</span> their <span>gifts</span> with us.<br/>
🎧 <span>If</span> you are <span>lucky</span> enough to be <span>creative</span>, you should use your <span>talents</span> to <span>create</span> <span>works</span> of art that we all can <span>share.<br/>

🎧 I <span>felt</span> <span>silly</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>turned</span> on the <span>lights</span> and <span>sat</span> back <span>down</span> to read my book.<br/>
🎧 A few <span>minutes</span> <span>later</span>, I <span>heard</span> some <span>creaking</span> <span>noises</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>listened</span> <span>carefully</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Then</span>, I <span>heard</span> a <span>clunking</span> <span>noise</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think it <span>might</span> have been the <span>furnace</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Then</span> there was a <span>whirring</span> <span>noise</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>imagination</span> <span>began</span> to play <span>tricks</span> on me.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>imagining</span> that there were all <span>kinds</span> of <span>creatures</span> in the house.<br/>
🎧 I told <span>myself</span> to <span>grow</span> up.<br/>
🎧 I wouldn't let my <span>imagination</span> run away with me.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>glad</span> when my <span>parents</span> got home.<br/>
🎧 I told them about all the <span>noises</span> that I had <span>heard</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>parents</span> <span>laughed</span> and said that all <span>houses</span> make <span>noises</span>.<br/>
🎧 We're usually just so <span>busy</span> that we don't hear all the <span>noises</span> that go on.<br/>
🎧 I have <span>stayed</span> home <span>alone</span> many <span>times</span> <span>now</span>.<br/>
🎧 I just <span>ignore</span> all the little <span>creaks</span> and <span>noises</span> that I hear.<br/>
🎧 I am still <span>alert</span> and <span>listen</span> for <span>anything</span> <span>suspicious</span>, but I know that there are <span>lots</span> of <span>noises</span> that are <span>harmless</span>.<br/>
🎧 That <span>tree</span> that <span>taps</span> on my <span>window</span> still <span>frightens</span> me <span>sometimes</span>, but I'm a lot <span>braver</span> <span>now<br/></span> 
🎧 than I was the <span>first</span> time that I <span>stayed</span> home <span>alone.<br/>

🎧 What <span>does</span> the <span>word</span> <span>"family"</span> mean to you? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>easiest</span> way to <span>define</span> <span>family</span> is to talk about who you are <span>related</span> to. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Usually</span>, there is a mom and a dad and <span>children</span> who are <span>brothers</span> and <span>sisters</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 This would be the <span>"core"</span> <span>family</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Then</span> there is the <span>"extended"</span> <span>family</span> which would <span>include</span> <span>grandparents</span>, <span>aunts</span> and <span>uncles</span>, <span>cousins</span>, <span>nieces</span> and <span>nephews</span> and <span>in-laws</span> <span>(people</span> <span>married</span> to your <span>bothers</span> or <span>sisters</span>, <span>husband</span> or <span>wife)</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, I think the <span>word</span> <span>"family"</span> has a much <span>deeper</span> <span>meaning</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>word</span> <span>"family"</span> <span>brings</span> <span>words</span> to my <span>mind</span> <span>like:</span> love, <span>support</span>, help, <span>kindness</span>, fun, love, <span>trips</span>, <span>closeness</span>, love, <span>forgiving</span>, <span>sharing</span>, love, <span>understanding</span>, <span>respect</span> and love! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 You'll <span>notice</span> one <span>word</span> that is <span>repeated</span> over and over again. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>LOVE</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>believe</span> if a <span>family</span> has <span>real</span> love for one <span>another</span>, they will be <span>able</span> to <span>overcome</span> any <span>problems</span> they may have. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Actually</span>, they may not have too many <span>problems</span> if they all love and <span>respect</span> one <span>another</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>However</span>, there are <span>things</span> that <span>cannot</span> be <span>helped;</span> like <span>death</span>, <span>sickness</span> or <span>accidents</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It is during <span>those</span> <span>hard</span> <span>times</span> that a <span>family's</span> love <span>helps</span> them to go <span>through</span> <span>those</span> <span>experiences</span>.<br/>
🎧 We had <span>quite</span> a few <span>children</span> in my <span>family</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There were <span>brothers</span> and <span>sisters</span> which <span>included</span> an <span>adopted</span> <span>brother</span> and a <span>number</span> of <span>foster</span> <span>children</span>, too. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I was also very <span>fortunate</span> that I had both my mom and dad to live with and do <span>things</span> like <span>vacations</span> <span>together</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We had a lot of fun and there were some <span>times</span> of <span>tears</span>, too. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Above</span> all, we love one <span>another</span>! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Family</span> is a <span>wonderful</span> <span>thing</span>! I am so <span>lucky!<br/>

🎧 My <span>first</span> <span>"real"</span> job was during my last year of high school. I had <span>taken</span> <span>classes</span> in <span>various</span> <span>business</span> <span>subjects</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>In</span> that last year of high school, we <span>could</span> do a <span>"co-op"</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 That <span>meant</span> we <span>could</span> work <span>part</span> of the time <span>instead</span> of going to school. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It would <span>count</span> as a <span>credit</span> <span>towards</span> our <span>diploma</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>place</span> I got a job was at a <span>men's</span> <span>tailor</span> <span>shop</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>owners</span> were a very nice <span>older</span> <span>German</span> <span>couple</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They had two other men <span>working</span> for them, too. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 One of the men had had <span>brain</span> <span>surgery</span> for <span>cancer</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 He had a big, long <span>scar</span> all around the top of his <span>head</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 He told me all about it. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 He was always happy and full of fun. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>thought</span> he was very <span>brave!<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>tailor</span> <span>shop</span> made <span>suits</span> to <span>order</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 One of the <span>salesmen</span> would <span>measure</span> the man, and the <span>customer</span> would <span>choose</span> a <span>fabric</span> and <span>style</span> he <span>(or</span> his <span>wife!)</span> <span>liked</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The people in the back of the <span>shop</span> would then cut and sew the <span>suit</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>suits</span> <span>cost</span> a lot of money. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There were also <span>suits</span> <span>already</span> made that the <span>customer</span> <span>could</span> buy <span>instead</span> if they <span>wished</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They <span>could</span> also <span>rent</span> <span>suits</span> or <span>tuxedos</span> for <span>weddings</span> or <span>parties</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>worked</span> at a little <span>desk</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>answered</span> the <span>phone</span>, <span>wrote</span> <span>letters</span>, <span>filed</span> <span>papers</span> and did some <span>bookkeeping</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It was about a <span>mile</span> <span>walk</span> from my school to work. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>passed</span> many <span>clothing</span> <span>shops</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 That wasn't good <span>because</span> I <span>spent</span> a lot of the money that I <span>earned</span> in <span>those</span> <span>shops!<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>worked</span> at the <span>tailor</span> <span>shop</span> for almost a year. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It was a good <span>experience</span> and <span>helped</span> me get my next job with the <span>United</span> <span>States</span> <span>Navy</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 That was fun, <span>too!<br/>

🎧 <span>Today</span> I am going to my <span>friend's</span> house. Her <span>name</span> is <span>Valerie</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 This is going to be my <span>first</span> <span>trip</span> away from home, without my <span>parents</span>.<br/>
🎧 My dad is driving me to <span>Valerie's</span> house, and I'll be <span>staying</span> there for two <span>weeks</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Her mom will drive me back home. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It takes about <span>l</span> <span>l/2</span> <span>hours</span> to get there. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I have to <span>pack</span> enough <span>clothes</span> for play, work and <span>church</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I hope I'll <span>pack</span> the right <span>things</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Of</span> course, I have to <span>remember</span> my <span>toothbrush</span> and <span>hairbrush</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Valerie</span> <span>lives</span> on a <span>farm</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I'll be <span>helping</span> her dad with <span>milking</span> the <span>cows--I</span> think! We'll play up in the <span>hayloft</span> after we have <span>helped</span> put the <span>bales</span> into the <span>barn</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We'll be all <span>itchy</span> when that job is <span>done</span>! There are a lot of <span>things</span> to do on a <span>farm</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Her mom is a good <span>cook</span> and will <span>feed</span> us <span>well!<br/></span> 
🎧 There is a nice <span>pond</span> where we can go <span>swimming</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I mustn't <span>forget</span> my <span>bathing</span> <span>suit</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>wonder</span> if the <span>farm</span> dog <span>comes</span> into the <span>pond</span>, too. That would be <span>funny!<br/></span> 
🎧 My dad and mom are <span>giving</span> me money just in case we go <span>shopping</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I hope we do go <span>shopping</span> <span>because</span> I want to buy <span>lots</span> of <span>candy</span>. <span>(I</span> won't tell my mom <span>that!)<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span>, <span>dear</span>! I hear Dad <span>yelling</span>, <span>"Let's</span> <span>go!"</span> I haven't even <span>finished</span> <span>packing</span> my <span>things</span> yet. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>guess</span> I better <span>stop</span> <span>writing</span> this now and get <span>busy</span> <span>fast</span>! <span>Bye!<br/>

🎧 I work at a <span>conservation</span> <span>park</span> <span>called</span> <span>Ball's</span> <span>Falls</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I've only <span>worked</span> there for <span>three</span> <span>weeks</span> now. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I am a <span>Tour</span> <span>Guide</span>, and I tell people the <span>history</span> of all the old <span>buildings</span> there.<br/>
🎧 <span>Somebody</span> told me that one of the <span>houses</span> I work in is <span>haunted</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Now I get <span>chills</span> <span>every</span> time I <span>walk</span> into that house! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 My <span>boss</span> told me that the <span>stories</span> aren't <span>real</span>, but I have an <span>active</span> <span>imagination!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Ball's</span> <span>Falls</span> is very <span>beautiful</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It has two different water <span>falls</span>, the <span>Upper</span> <span>Falls</span> and the <span>Lower</span> <span>Falls</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There used to be <span>tons</span> of water <span>cascading</span> over them, which <span>turned</span> a big water <span>wheel</span> to <span>grind</span> <span>grain</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 I love <span>working</span> at <span>Ball's</span> <span>Falls</span> <span>because</span> I get to work <span>outside</span> a lot. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I am <span>getting</span> a tan! <span>In</span> <span>July</span> and <span>August</span>, I will be <span>working</span> with <span>kids</span> there at a day <span>camp</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I am <span>getting</span> <span>ready</span> now, <span>making</span> different <span>crafts</span> and <span>thinking</span> up fun new <span>games</span> to play. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I can't <span>wait</span> to <span>start</span> <span>working</span> with them. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I think that will be the best <span>part</span> of the <span>summer</span>.<br/>
🎧 I will be going to work again <span>tomorrow</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I usually have to work from <span>9</span> <span>a.m</span>. to <span>4:30</span> <span>p.m</span>. <span><br/></span>
