🎧 I am curious about many things.<br/>
🎧 I would like to find the answers to a lot of questions that I have.<br/>
🎧 What holds the stars up in the sky?<br/> 
🎧 Why does ice form on the top of the lake when it is cold?<br/> 
🎧 Is there life on other planets?<br/> 
🎧 Why do we not fall off the face of the earth?<br/> 
🎧 How do caterpillars turn into butterflies?<br/> 
🎧 All of these things are mysteries to me.<br/>
🎧 There are so many questions that are unanswered.<br/>
🎧 I think I should go to the library and get a book to find out why people grow old.<br/>
🎧 What makes a television work?<br/> 
🎧 I also want to know where electricity comes from.<br/>
🎧 Who is the strongest person in the world?<br/> 
🎧 Who is the smartest person in the world?<br/> 
🎧 Why do some people have blonde hair, and some people have black hair?<br/> 
🎧 Why do people in different countries speak different languages?<br/> 
🎧 Why do people have to die?<br/> 
🎧 Why are no two snowflakes alike?<br/> 
🎧 What makes people fall in love?<br/> 
🎧 What makes the rivers run?<br/> 
🎧 Why does the sun rise every morning?<br/> 
🎧 How did the oceans form?<br/> 
🎧 Why did the dinosaurs vanish from the earth?<br/> 
🎧 I wonder if I'll ever find out the answers to all my questions.<br/>
🎧 I think I'll have to study hard and stay in school to find out everything that I want to know.<br/>
🎧 Some questions never get answered.<br/>
🎧 It is good to be curious.<br/>
🎧 People who are curious about things are the ones who learn a lot, and some curious people go on to invent things and make important discoveries

🎧 Some people are just born to create.<br/>
🎧 That's what I think.<br/>
🎧 Some people just have the need to write stories, compose beautiful music, or paint pictures.<br/>
🎧 Creativity seems to be inside them, and they need to let it out.<br/>
🎧 It's good that we have people like that.<br/>
🎧 Composers like Mozart and Chopin have given us music that is incredibly beautiful.<br/>
🎧 It's not just the classical composers who have given us great pieces of music; there are modern composers who have written great songs also.<br/>
🎧 Elton John is an example of someone who has composed many wonderful songs.<br/>
🎧 Andrew Lloyd Webber has given us some very popular musicals like Cats and The Phantom of the Opera.<br/>
🎧 There are so many talented and creative people in this world.<br/>
🎧 When you visit an art gallery, you marvel at how artists are able to recreate realism or make up something that seems totally unreal yet beautiful.<br/>
🎧 The American artist Norman Rockwell painted some pictures that actually looked like photographs.<br/>
🎧 He tried to portray life as it was in America.<br/>
🎧 Through his paintings, one can get a good sense of American life through the years.<br/>
🎧 On the other hand, artists like Jackson Pollock did not portray realism.<br/>
🎧 Jackson Pollock painted abstract pictures.<br/>
🎧 His paintings are just as good as Norman Rockwell's, but they are entirely different.<br/>
🎧 Some books that we read are classics.<br/>
🎧 Mark Twain portrayed American life through his characters Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn.<br/>
🎧 Charles Dickens brought Victorian England to life through his books.<br/>
🎧 Most people are familiar with his Christmas Carol where the mean and miserable Scrooge learns the true meaning of Christmas.<br/>
🎧 People don't have to read the classics.<br/>
🎧 There are modern writers who entertain readers through their stories.<br/>
🎧 Stephen King has written a number of horror stories.<br/>
🎧 Some of his books have even been made into movies.<br/>
🎧 We are lucky to have creative people who share their gifts with us.<br/>
🎧 If you are lucky enough to be creative, you should use your talents to create works of art that we all can share

🎧 I have been having trouble seeing the blackboard.<br/>
🎧 Everything is blurry.<br/>
🎧 I keep getting headaches.<br/>
🎧 I told my mother about it, and she made an appointment with the optometrist.<br/>
🎧 I went to a place where they made me read words and letters on a chart.<br/>
🎧 Some of the words were big, and some were very small.<br/>
🎧 I tried to read everything, but sometimes I couldn't see some of the small letters.<br/>
🎧 The optometrist would cover one of my eyes while I read the chart.<br/>
🎧 Then, she would cover my other eye.<br/>
🎧 She even put some drops in my eyes.<br/>
🎧 I asked the optometrist if I had passed or failed the test.<br/>
🎧 She laughed, and said that it wasn't the kind of test that you passed or failed.<br/>
🎧 She was just trying to find out if I needed glasses.<br/>
🎧 I did need glasses.<br/>
🎧 My mother and I looked around.<br/>
🎧 There were many pairs of frames.<br/>
🎧 I wanted something that was in style.<br/>
🎧 I tried on many pairs of frames. <br/> 
🎧 Some of them looked good on me, and some of them looked really funny on me.<br/>
🎧 I finally chose a frame that was my favorite.<br/>
🎧 I gave them to a lady who did some measurements.<br/>
🎧 She told me to come back on Friday to get my glasses.<br/>
🎧 On Friday, I got my glasses.<br/>
🎧 My friends liked them.<br/>
🎧 They said I looked smart in my glasses.<br/>
🎧 I wore them to school on Monday, and I was able to see the blackboard clearly.<br/>
🎧 I didn't realize how much I hadn't been able to see.<br/>
🎧 Now I don't get headaches anymore.<br/>
🎧 I'm glad that I have my glasses.<br/>

🎧 What does the word "family" mean to you? <br/> 
🎧 The easiest way to define family is to talk about who you are related to. <br/> 
🎧 Usually, there is a mom and a dad and children who are brothers and sisters. <br/> 
🎧 This would be the "core" family. <br/> 
🎧 Then there is the "extended" family which would include grandparents, aunts and uncles, cousins, nieces and nephews and in-laws (people married to your bothers or sisters, husband or wife).<br/>
🎧 However, I think the word "family" has a much deeper meaning. <br/> 
🎧 The word "family" brings words to my mind like: love, support, help, kindness, fun, love, trips, closeness, love, forgiving, sharing, love, understanding, respect and love! <br/> 
🎧 You'll notice one word that is repeated over and over again. <br/> 
🎧 LOVE. <br/> 
🎧 I believe if a family has real love for one another, they will be able to overcome any problems they may have. <br/> 
🎧 Actually, they may not have too many problems if they all love and respect one another. <br/> 
🎧 However, there are things that cannot be helped; like death, sickness or accidents. <br/> 
🎧 It is during those hard times that a family's love helps them to go through those experiences.<br/>
🎧 We had quite a few children in my family. <br/> 
🎧 There were brothers and sisters which included an adopted brother and a number of foster children, too. <br/> 
🎧 I was also very fortunate that I had both my mom and dad to live with and do things like vacations together. <br/> 
🎧 We had a lot of fun and there were some times of tears, too. <br/> 
🎧 Above all, we love one another! <br/> 
🎧 Family is a wonderful thing! I am so lucky

🎧 My first "real" job was during my last year of high school. I had taken classes in various business subjects. <br/> 
🎧 In that last year of high school, we could do a "co-op". <br/> 
🎧 That meant we could work part of the time instead of going to school. <br/> 
🎧 It would count as a credit towards our diploma.<br/>
🎧 The place I got a job was at a men's tailor shop. <br/> 
🎧 The owners were a very nice older German couple. <br/> 
🎧 They had two other men working for them, too. <br/> 
🎧 One of the men had had brain surgery for cancer. <br/> 
🎧 He had a big, long scar all around the top of his head. <br/> 
🎧 He told me all about it. <br/> 
🎧 He was always happy and full of fun. <br/> 
🎧 I thought he was very brave!<br/> 
🎧 The tailor shop made suits to order. <br/> 
🎧 One of the salesmen would measure the man, and the customer would choose a fabric and style he (or his wife!) liked. <br/> 
🎧 The people in the back of the shop would then cut and sew the suit. <br/> 
🎧 The suits cost a lot of money. <br/> 
🎧 There were also suits already made that the customer could buy instead if they wished. <br/> 
🎧 They could also rent suits or tuxedos for weddings or parties.<br/>
🎧 I worked at a little desk. <br/> 
🎧 I answered the phone, wrote letters, filed papers and did some bookkeeping. <br/> 
🎧 It was about a mile walk from my school to work. <br/> 
🎧 I passed many clothing shops. <br/> 
🎧 That wasn't good because I spent a lot of the money that I earned in those shops!<br/> 
🎧 I worked at the tailor shop for almost a year. <br/> 
🎧 It was a good experience and helped me get my next job with the United States Navy. <br/> 
🎧 That was fun, too

🎧 I am getting ready now, making different crafts and thinking up fun new games to play. <br/> 
🎧 I can't wait to start working with them. <br/> 
🎧 I think that will be the best part of the summer.<br/>
🎧 I will be going to work again tomorrow. <br/> 
🎧 I usually have to work from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. <br/> 
🎧 I also like the people I work with. They are very nice.<br/>
🎧 Come to Ball's Falls, and I'll give you a tour
