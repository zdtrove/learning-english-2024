🎧 I am <span>curious</span> about many things.<br/>
🎧 I would like to find the <span>answers</span> to a lot of <span>questions</span> that I have.<br/>
🎧 What <span>holds</span> the <span>stars</span> up in the <span>sky</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Why does ice <span>form</span> on the top of the <span>lake</span> when it is <span>cold</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Is there life on other <span>planets</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Why do we not <span>fall</span> off the <span>face</span> of the <span>earth</span>?<br/> 
🎧 How do <span>caterpillars</span> <span>turn</span> into <span>butterflies</span>?<br/> 
🎧 All of these things are <span>mysteries</span> to me.<br/>
🎧 There are so many <span>questions</span> that are <span>unanswered</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think I should go to the <span>library</span> and get a book to find out why people <span>grow</span> <span>old</span>.<br/>
🎧 What makes a <span>television</span> work?<br/> 
🎧 I also want to know where <span>electricity</span> comes from.<br/>
🎧 Who is the <span>strongest</span> person in the <span>world</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Who is the <span>smartest</span> person in the <span>world</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Why do some people have <span>blonde</span> <span>hair</span>, and some people have <span>black</span> <span>hair</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Why do people in different <span>countries</span> speak different <span>languages</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Why do people have to <span>die</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Why are no two <span>snowflakes</span> <span>alike</span>?<br/>

🎧 How did the <span>oceans</span> <span>form</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Why did the <span>dinosaurs</span> <span>vanish</span> from the <span>earth</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I <span>wonder</span> if I'll ever find out the <span>answers</span> to all my <span>questions</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think I'll have to <span>study</span> <span>hard</span> and <span>stay</span> in school to find out everything that I want to know.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>questions</span> never get <span>answered</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is good to be <span>curious</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>People</span> who are <span>curious</span> about things are the <span>ones</span> who learn a lot, and some <span>curious</span> people go on to <span>invent</span> things and make important <span>discoveries

🎧 Some people are just <span>born</span> to <span>create</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's what I think.<br/>
🎧 Some people just have the need to <span>write</span> <span>stories</span>, <span>compose</span> <span>beautiful</span> music, or <span>paint</span> <span>pictures</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Creativity</span> <span>seems</span> to be inside them, and they need to let it out.<br/>
🎧 It's good that we have people like that.<br/>
🎧 <span>Composers</span> like <span>Mozart</span> and <span>Chopin</span> have <span>given</span> us music that is <span>incredibly</span> <span>beautiful</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's not just the <span>classical</span> <span>composers</span> who have <span>given</span> us great <span>pieces</span> of <span>music;</span> there are <span>modern</span> <span>composers</span> who have <span>written</span> great <span>songs</span> also.<br/>
🎧 <span>Elton</span> <span>John</span> is an example of someone who has <span>composed</span> many wonderful <span>songs</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Andrew</span> <span>Lloyd</span> <span>Webber</span> has <span>given</span> us some very <span>popular</span> <span>musicals</span> like <span>Cats</span> and The <span>Phantom</span> of the <span>Opera</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are so many <span>talented</span> and <span>creative</span> people in this <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you visit an art <span>gallery</span>, you <span>marvel</span> at how <span>artists</span> are able to <span>recreate</span> <span>realism</span> or make up something that <span>seems</span> <span>totally</span> <span>unreal</span> yet <span>beautiful</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>American</span> <span>artist</span> <span>Norman</span> <span>Rockwell</span> <span>painted</span> some <span>pictures</span> that actually <span>looked</span> like <span>photographs</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>tried</span> to <span>portray</span> life as it was in <span>America</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Through</span> his <span>paintings</span>, one can get a good <span>sense</span> of <span>American</span> life through the years.<br/>
🎧 On the other <span>hand</span>, <span>artists</span> like <span>Jackson</span> <span>Pollock</span> did not <span>portray</span> <span>realism</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Jackson</span> <span>Pollock</span> <span>painted</span> <span>abstract</span> <span>pictures</span>.<br/>
🎧 His <span>paintings</span> are just as good as <span>Norman</span> <span>Rockwell's</span>, but they are <span>entirely</span> different.<br/>
🎧 Some books that we read are <span>classics</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mark</span> <span>Twain</span> <span>portrayed</span> <span>American</span> life through his <span>characters</span> Tom <span>Sawyer</span> and <span>Huckleberry</span> <span>Finn</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Charles</span> <span>Dickens</span> <span>brought</span> <span>Victorian</span> <span>England</span> to life through his books.<br/>
🎧 <span>Most</span> people are <span>familiar</span> with his <span>Christmas</span> <span>Carol</span> where the mean and <span>miserable</span> <span>Scrooge</span> <span>learns</span> the <span>true</span> <span>meaning</span> of <span>Christmas</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>People</span> don't have to read the <span>classics</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>modern</span> <span>writers</span> who <span>entertain</span> <span>readers</span> through their <span>stories</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Stephen</span> <span>King</span> has <span>written</span> a number of <span>horror</span> <span>stories</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some of his books have even been made into <span>movies</span>.<br/>
🎧 We are <span>lucky</span> to have <span>creative</span> people who share their <span>gifts</span> with us.<br/>
🎧 If you are <span>lucky</span> enough to be <span>creative</span>, you should use your <span>talents</span> to <span>create</span> <span>works</span> of art that we all can <span>share

🎧 I was <span>imagining</span> that there were all <span>kinds</span> of <span>creatures</span> in the house.<br/>
🎧 I told myself to <span>grow</span> up.<br/>
🎧 I wouldn't let my <span>imagination</span> run away with me.<br/>
🎧 I was glad when my <span>parents</span> got home.<br/>
🎧 I told them about all the <span>noises</span> that I had heard.<br/>

🎧 <span>Usually</span>, there is a mom and a dad and children who are <span>brothers</span> and <span>sisters</span>. <br/> 
🎧 This would be the <span>"core"</span> <span>family</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Then</span> there is the <span>"extended"</span> <span>family</span> which would <span>include</span> <span>grandparents</span>, <span>aunts</span> and <span>uncles</span>, <span>cousins</span>, <span>nieces</span> and <span>nephews</span> and <span>in-laws</span> <span>(people</span> <span>married</span> to your <span>bothers</span> or <span>sisters</span>, <span>husband</span> or <span>wife)</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, I think the <span>word</span> <span>"family"</span> has a much <span>deeper</span> <span>meaning</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>word</span> <span>"family"</span> <span>brings</span> <span>words</span> to my <span>mind</span> <span>like:</span> love, <span>support</span>, help, <span>kindness</span>, fun, love, <span>trips</span>, <span>closeness</span>, love, <span>forgiving</span>, <span>sharing</span>, love, <span>understanding</span>, <span>respect</span> and love! <br/> 
🎧 You'll <span>notice</span> one <span>word</span> that is <span>repeated</span> over and over again. <br/> 
🎧 <span>LOVE</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I <span>believe</span> if a <span>family</span> has <span>real</span> love for one another, they will be able to <span>overcome</span> any <span>problems</span> they may have. <br/> 
🎧 Actually, they may not have too many <span>problems</span> if they all love and <span>respect</span> one another. <br/> 
🎧 <span>However</span>, there are things that <span>cannot</span> be <span>helped;</span> like <span>death</span>, <span>sickness</span> or <span>accidents</span>. <br/> 
🎧 It is during those <span>hard</span> <span>times</span> that a <span>family's</span> love helps them to go through those <span>experiences</span>.<br/>
🎧 We had quite a few children in my <span>family</span>. <br/> 
🎧 There were <span>brothers</span> and <span>sisters</span> which <span>included</span> an <span>adopted</span> <span>brother</span> and a number of <span>foster</span> children, too. <br/> 
🎧 I was also very <span>fortunate</span> that I had both my mom and dad to live with and do things like <span>vacations</span> together. <br/> 
🎧 We had a lot of fun and there were some <span>times</span> of <span>tears</span>, too. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Above</span> all, we love one another! <br/> 
🎧 <span>Family</span> is a wonderful thing! I am so <span>lucky
</span>!<br/><br/>

🎧 My first <span>"real"</span> job was during my last year of high school. I had taken <span>classes</span> in <span>various</span> <span>business</span> <span>subjects</span>. <br/> 
🎧 In that last year of high school, we could do a <span>"co-op"</span>. <br/> 
🎧 That <span>meant</span> we could work <span>part</span> of the time <span>instead</span> of going to school. <br/> 
🎧 It would <span>count</span> as a <span>credit</span> <span>towards</span> our <span>diploma</span>.<br/>
🎧 The place I got a job was at a <span>men's</span> <span>tailor</span> <span>shop</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>owners</span> were a very nice <span>older</span> <span>German</span> <span>couple</span>. <br/> 
🎧 They had two other men working for them, too. <br/> 
🎧 One of the men had had <span>brain</span> <span>surgery</span> for <span>cancer</span>. <br/> 
🎧 He had a big, long <span>scar</span> all around the top of his <span>head</span>. <br/> 
🎧 He told me all about it. <br/> 
🎧 He was always happy and full of fun. <br/> 
🎧 I thought he was very <span>brave</span>!<br/> 
🎧 The <span>tailor</span> <span>shop</span> made <span>suits</span> to order. <br/> 
🎧 One of the <span>salesmen</span> would <span>measure</span> the man, and the <span>customer</span> would choose a <span>fabric</span> and <span>style</span> he <span>(or</span> his <span>wife!)</span> <span>liked</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The people in the back of the <span>shop</span> would then cut and sew the <span>suit</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>suits</span> <span>cost</span> a lot of money. <br/> 
🎧 There were also <span>suits</span> already made that the <span>customer</span> could buy <span>instead</span> if they <span>wished</span>. <br/> 
🎧 They could also <span>rent</span> <span>suits</span> or <span>tuxedos</span> for <span>weddings</span> or <span>parties</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>worked</span> at a little <span>desk</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I <span>answered</span> the phone, <span>wrote</span> <span>letters</span>, <span>filed</span> <span>papers</span> and did some <span>bookkeeping</span>. <br/> 
🎧 It was about a <span>mile</span> <span>walk</span> from my school to work. <br/> 
🎧 I <span>passed</span> many <span>clothing</span> <span>shops</span>. <br/> 
🎧 That wasn't good because I <span>spent</span> a lot of the money that I <span>earned</span> in those <span>shops</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I <span>worked</span> at the <span>tailor</span> <span>shop</span> for almost a year. <br/> 
🎧 It was a good <span>experience</span> and <span>helped</span> me get my next job with the <span>United</span> <span>States</span> <span>Navy</span>. <br/> 
🎧 That was fun, <span>too
</span>!<br/><br/>

🎧 Today I am going to my <span>friend's</span> house. Her name is <span>Valerie</span>. <br/> 
🎧 This is going to be my first <span>trip</span> away from home, without my <span>parents</span>.<br/>
🎧 My dad is driving me to <span>Valerie's</span> house, and I'll be <span>staying</span> there for two <span>weeks</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Her mom will drive me back home. <br/> 
🎧 It takes about <span>l</span> <span>l/2</span> hours to get there. <br/> 
🎧 I have to <span>pack</span> enough <span>clothes</span> for play, work and <span>church</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I hope I'll <span>pack</span> the right things. <br/> 
🎧 Of course, I have to remember my <span>toothbrush</span> and <span>hairbrush</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Valerie</span> lives on a <span>farm</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I'll be <span>helping</span> her dad with <span>milking</span> the <span>cows--I</span> think! We'll play up in the <span>hayloft</span> after we have <span>helped</span> put the <span>bales</span> into the <span>barn</span>. <br/> 
🎧 We'll be all <span>itchy</span> when that job is done! There are a lot of things to do on a <span>farm</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Her mom is a good <span>cook</span> and will <span>feed</span> us well!<br/> 
🎧 There is a nice <span>pond</span> where we can go <span>swimming</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I mustn't <span>forget</span> my <span>bathing</span> <span>suit</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I <span>wonder</span> if the <span>farm</span> dog comes into the <span>pond</span>, too. That would be <span>funny</span>!<br/> 
🎧 My dad and mom are <span>giving</span> me money just in case we go <span>shopping</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I hope we do go <span>shopping</span> because I want to buy lots of <span>candy</span>. <span>(I</span> won't tell my mom <span>that!)</span><br/> 
🎧 Oh, <span>dear</span>! I hear Dad <span>yelling</span>, <span>"Let's</span> <span>go!"</span> I haven't even <span>finished</span> <span>packing</span> my things yet. <br/> 
🎧 I <span>guess</span> I better <span>stop</span> <span>writing</span> this now and get <span>busy</span> <span>fast</span>! <span>Bye

🎧 I work at a <span>conservation</span> <span>park</span> called <span>Ball's</span> <span>Falls</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I've only <span>worked</span> there for <span>three</span> <span>weeks</span> now. <br/> 
🎧 I am a <span>Tour</span> <span>Guide</span>, and I tell people the <span>history</span> of all the old <span>buildings</span> there.<br/>
🎧 <span>Somebody</span> told me that one of the <span>houses</span> I work in is <span>haunted</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Now I get <span>chills</span> every time I <span>walk</span> into that house! <br/> 
🎧 My <span>boss</span> told me that the <span>stories</span> aren't <span>real</span>, but I have an <span>active</span> <span>imagination</span>!<br/> 
🎧 <span>Ball's</span> <span>Falls</span> is very <span>beautiful</span>. <br/> 
🎧 It has two different water <span>falls</span>, the <span>Upper</span> <span>Falls</span> and the <span>Lower</span> <span>Falls</span>. <br/> 
🎧 There used to be <span>tons</span> of water <span>cascading</span> over them, which <span>turned</span> a big water <span>wheel</span> to <span>grind</span> <span>grain</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>However</span>, through the years the amount of water has really <span>lessened</span>.<br/>
🎧 I love working at <span>Ball's</span> <span>Falls</span> because I get to work outside a lot. <br/> 
🎧 I am getting a tan! In <span>July</span> and <span>August</span>, I will be working with <span>kids</span> there at a day <span>camp</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I am getting ready now, <span>making</span> different <span>crafts</span> and thinking up fun new <span>games</span> to play. <br/> 
🎧 I can't wait to start working with them. <br/> 
🎧 I think that will be the best <span>part</span> of the <span>summer</span>.<br/>
🎧 I will be going to work again <span>tomorrow</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I usually have to work from <span>9</span> <span>a.m</span>. to <span>4:30</span> <span>p.m</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I also like the people I work with. They are very nice.<br/>
🎧 Come to <span>Ball's</span> <span>Falls</span>, and I'll give you a <span>tour
