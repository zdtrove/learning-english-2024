🎧 What <span>does</span> the <span>word</span> <span>"family"</span> <span>mean</span> to you? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>easiest</span> way to <span>define</span> <span>family</span> <span>is</span> to <span>talk</span> <span>about</span> who you are <span>related</span> to. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Usually</span>, there <span>is</span> a mom and a dad and <span>children</span> who are <span>brothers</span> and <span>sisters</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>This</span> <span>would</span> be the <span>"core"</span> <span>family</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Then</span> there <span>is</span> the <span>"extended"</span> <span>family</span> which <span>would</span> <span>include</span> <span>grandparents</span>, <span>aunts</span> and <span>uncles</span>, <span>cousins</span>, <span>nieces</span> and <span>nephews</span> and <span>in-laws</span> <span>(people</span> <span>married</span> to your <span>bothers</span> <span>or</span> <span>sisters</span>, <span>husband</span> <span>or</span> <span>wife)</span> .<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, I <span>think</span> the <span>word</span> <span>"family"</span> has a <span>much</span> <span>deeper</span> <span>meaning</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>word</span> <span>"family"</span> <span>brings</span> <span>words</span> to my <span>mind</span> <span>like:</span> <span>love</span>, <span>support</span>, <span>help</span>, <span>kindness</span>, fun, <span>love</span>, <span>trips</span>, <span>closeness</span>, <span>love</span>, <span>forgiving</span>, <span>sharing</span>, <span>love</span>, <span>understanding</span>, <span>respect</span> and <span>love</span>! <span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>LOVE</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>believe</span> <span>if</span> a <span>family</span> has <span>real</span> <span>love</span> for one <span>another</span>, <span>they</span> <span>will</span> be <span>able</span> to <span>overcome</span> any <span>problems</span> <span>they</span> may have. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Actually</span>, <span>they</span> may not have too <span>many</span> <span>problems</span> <span>if</span> <span>they</span> all <span>love</span> and <span>respect</span> one <span>another</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>However</span>, there are <span>things</span> <span>that</span> <span>cannot</span> be <span>helped;</span> <span>like</span> <span>death</span>, <span>sickness</span> <span>or</span> <span>accidents</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>It</span> <span>is</span> <span>during</span> <span>those</span> <span>hard</span> <span>times</span> <span>that</span> a <span>family's</span> <span>love</span> <span>helps</span> <span>them</span> to <span>go</span> <span>through</span> <span>those</span> <span>experiences</span> .<br/>
🎧 <span>We</span> had <span>quite</span> a few <span>children</span> <span>in</span> my <span>family</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There <span>were</span> <span>brothers</span> and <span>sisters</span> which <span>included</span> an <span>adopted</span> <span>brother</span> and a <span>number</span> <span>of</span> <span>foster</span> <span>children</span>, too. <span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>We</span> had a lot <span>of</span> fun and there <span>were</span> <span>some</span> <span>times</span> <span>of</span> <span>tears</span>, too. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Above</span> all, <span>we</span> <span>love</span> one <span>another</span>! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Family</span> <span>is</span> a <span>wonderful</span> <span>thing</span>! I <span>am</span> so <span>lucky!<br/>

🎧 <span>Today</span> I <span>am</span> <span>going</span> to my <span>friend's</span> <span>house</span>. Her <span>name</span> <span>is</span> <span>Valerie</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>This</span> <span>is</span> <span>going</span> to be my <span>first</span> <span>trip</span> <span>away</span> <span>from</span> <span>home</span>, <span>without</span> my <span>parents</span> .<br/>

🎧 Her mom <span>will</span> <span>drive</span> me <span>back</span> <span>home</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>It</span> <span>takes</span> <span>about</span> <span>l</span> <span>l/2</span> <span>hours</span> to get there. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I have to <span>pack</span> <span>enough</span> <span>clothes</span> for <span>play</span>, <span>work</span> and <span>church</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>hope</span> <span>I'll</span> <span>pack</span> the <span>right</span> <span>things</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Of</span> <span>course</span>, I have to <span>remember</span> my <span>toothbrush</span> and <span>hairbrush</span> .<br/>
🎧 <span>Valerie</span> <span>lives</span> <span>on</span> a <span>farm</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>I'll</span> be <span>helping</span> her dad <span>with</span> <span>milking</span> the <span>cows--I</span> <span>think</span>! We'll <span>play</span> <span>up</span> <span>in</span> the <span>hayloft</span> <span>after</span> <span>we</span> have <span>helped</span> put the <span>bales</span> <span>into</span> the <span>barn</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We'll be all <span>itchy</span> when <span>that</span> <span>job</span> <span>is</span> <span>done</span>! There are a lot <span>of</span> <span>things</span> to do <span>on</span> a <span>farm</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Her mom <span>is</span> a <span>good</span> <span>cook</span> and <span>will</span> <span>feed</span> <span>us</span> <span>well!<br/></span> 
🎧 There <span>is</span> a <span>nice</span> <span>pond</span> where <span>we</span> can <span>go</span> <span>swimming</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I mustn't <span>forget</span> my <span>bathing</span> <span>suit</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>wonder</span> <span>if</span> the <span>farm</span> dog <span>comes</span> <span>into</span> the <span>pond</span>, too. <span>That</span> <span>would</span> be <span>funny!<br/></span> 
🎧 My dad and mom are <span>giving</span> me <span>money</span> <span>just</span> <span>in</span> <span>case</span> <span>we</span> <span>go</span> <span>shopping</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>hope</span> <span>we</span> do <span>go</span> <span>shopping</span> <span>because</span> I <span>want</span> to buy <span>lots</span> <span>of</span> <span>candy</span>. <span>(I</span> won't <span>tell</span> my mom <span>that!)<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span>, <span>dear</span>! I <span>hear</span> Dad <span>yelling</span>, <span>"Let's</span> <span>go!"</span> I haven't <span>even</span> <span>finished</span> <span>packing</span> my <span>things</span> <span>yet</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>guess</span> I <span>better</span> <span>stop</span> <span>writing</span> <span>this</span> now and get <span>busy</span> <span>fast</span>! <span>Bye!<br/>

🎧 I <span>work</span> <span>at</span> a <span>conservation</span> <span>park</span> <span>called</span> <span>Ball's</span> <span>Falls</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I've <span>only</span> <span>worked</span> there for <span>three</span> <span>weeks</span> now. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>am</span> a <span>Tour</span> <span>Guide</span>, and I <span>tell</span> <span>people</span> the <span>history</span> <span>of</span> all the old <span>buildings</span> <span>there</span> .<br/>
🎧 <span>Somebody</span> <span>told</span> me <span>that</span> one <span>of</span> the <span>houses</span> I <span>work</span> <span>in</span> <span>is</span> <span>haunted</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 My <span>boss</span> <span>told</span> me <span>that</span> the <span>stories</span> aren't <span>real</span>, but I have an <span>active</span> <span>imagination!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Ball's</span> <span>Falls</span> <span>is</span> <span>very</span> <span>beautiful</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>It</span> has two <span>different</span> <span>water</span> <span>falls</span>, the <span>Upper</span> <span>Falls</span> and the <span>Lower</span> <span>Falls</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There <span>used</span> to be <span>tons</span> <span>of</span> <span>water</span> <span>cascading</span> <span>over</span> <span>them</span>, which <span>turned</span> a big <span>water</span> <span>wheel</span> to <span>grind</span> <span>grain</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>However</span>, <span>through</span> the <span>years</span> the <span>amount</span> <span>of</span> <span>water</span> has <span>really</span> <span>lessened</span> .<br/>
🎧 I <span>love</span> <span>working</span> <span>at</span> <span>Ball's</span> <span>Falls</span> <span>because</span> I get to <span>work</span> <span>outside</span> a lot. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>am</span> <span>getting</span> a tan! <span>In</span> <span>July</span> and <span>August</span>, I <span>will</span> be <span>working</span> <span>with</span> <span>kids</span> there <span>at</span> a day <span>camp</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>am</span> <span>getting</span> <span>ready</span> now, <span>making</span> <span>different</span> <span>crafts</span> and <span>thinking</span> <span>up</span> fun new <span>games</span> to <span>play</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I can't <span>wait</span> to <span>start</span> <span>working</span> <span>with</span> <span>them</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>think</span> <span>that</span> <span>will</span> be the <span>best</span> <span>part</span> <span>of</span> the <span>summer</span> .<br/>
🎧 I <span>will</span> be <span>going</span> to <span>work</span> <span>again</span> <span>tomorrow</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>usually</span> have to <span>work</span> <span>from</span> <span>9</span> <span>a.m</span>. to <span>4:30</span> <span>p.m</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>also</span> <span>like</span> the <span>people</span> I <span>work</span> <span>with</span>. <span>They</span> are <span>very</span> <span>nice</span> .<br/>
