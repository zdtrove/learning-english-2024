🎧 <span>Imagine</span> what life would be like if you were two <span>inches</span> <span>tall</span>.<br/>
🎧 You would have to be <span>careful</span> that <span>nobody</span> <span>stepped</span> on you.<br/>
🎧 You would have to <span>watch</span> out for <span>cats</span>, <span>dogs</span> and <span>birds</span>.<br/>
🎧 It would be very <span>dangerous</span>, but just think of the <span>things</span> that you <span>could</span> do.<br/>
🎧 You <span>could</span> live in <span>dollhouse</span>, or even a <span>shoebox</span>.<br/>
🎧 You <span>could</span> use a <span>bottle</span> cap for a <span>plate</span>.<br/>
🎧 You would have to <span>wear</span> <span>dolls'</span> <span>clothes</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>stamp</span> would make a <span>lovely</span> <span>picture</span> to <span>hang</span> on your <span>wall</span>.<br/>
🎧 You <span>could</span> <span>hide</span> in a <span>mouse</span> <span>hole</span> or a <span>drawer</span>.<br/>
🎧 You wouldn't need much <span>food</span>.<br/>
🎧 You <span>could</span> <span>probably</span> live <span>comfortably</span> on the <span>crumbs</span> that <span>people</span> would <span>leave</span> on the <span>table</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>thimble</span> would make a <span>good</span> <span>cup</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>If</span> you <span>went</span> <span>outside</span>, the <span>grass</span> would <span>seem</span> like a <span>jungle</span>.<br/>
🎧 An <span>insect</span> would be <span>huge</span> and <span>frightening</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>puddle</span> would <span>seem</span> to be an <span>ocean</span>.<br/>
🎧 You <span>could</span> <span>cross</span> the <span>puddle</span> in a <span>paper</span> cup and use a <span>spoon</span> for an <span>oar</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>matchbox</span> would make a <span>good</span> bed with a <span>handkerchief</span> as a <span>bedspread</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'd <span>brush</span> your <span>hair</span> with a <span>toothbrush</span>, but you'd <span>never</span> find <span>anything</span> <span>small</span> <span>enough</span> to <span>brush</span> your <span>teeth</span> with.<br/>
🎧 You <span>could</span> take a <span>ride</span> on the back of a <span>mouse</span>.<br/>
🎧 You wouldn't find any <span>books</span> that were <span>small</span> <span>enough</span> to <span>read</span>, but you <span>might</span> <span>read</span> the back of a <span>pill</span> <span>bottle</span>.<br/>
🎧 You <span>could</span> <span>ride</span> in a toy car and have a <span>soup</span> <span>bowl</span> for a <span>swimming</span> <span>pool</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>leaf</span> <span>could</span> be your <span>umbrella</span>, and a <span>mitten</span> would make a <span>great</span> <span>sleeping</span> <span>bag</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>If</span> you used your <span>imagination</span>, you <span>could</span> think up <span>something</span> to use for <span>almost</span> all your <span>purposes</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Being</span> <span>small</span> <span>might</span> be fun, but <span>then</span> <span>again</span>, it would be <span>frightening</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>I'd</span> be <span>afraid</span> of my pet <span>cat</span>.<br/>
🎧 I wouldn't <span>want</span> a book to <span>fall</span> on me.<br/>
🎧 I would be <span>afraid</span> of being <span>swept</span> <span>away</span> by a big <span>gust</span> of <span>wind</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think <span>I'd</span> <span>rather</span> be my <span>size.<br/>

🎧 My <span>father</span> used to <span>smoke</span>.<br/>
🎧 He got very <span>ill</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>doctor</span> <span>told</span> him that he had to <span>quit</span> <span>smoking</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>father</span> <span>tried</span> for a long time to <span>quit</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was very <span>difficult</span> for him. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Smoking</span> is an <span>addiction</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>After</span> many <span>months</span>, my <span>father</span> <span>finally</span> gave up <span>smoking</span>, but he still <span>craved</span> a <span>cigarette</span> <span>once</span> in a <span>while</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>says</span> that <span>quitting</span> <span>smoking</span> is the <span>hardest</span> <span>thing</span> that he has <span>ever</span> <span>done</span>.<br/>
🎧 When my <span>father</span> did <span>smoke</span>, he <span>smoked</span> <span>everywhere</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>smoked</span> in <span>restaurants</span>, <span>stores</span> and many <span>public</span> <span>buildings</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, you are not <span>allowed</span> to <span>smoke</span> in a lot of <span>public</span> <span>places</span>.<br/>
🎧 When my <span>father</span> <span>smoked</span>, the <span>rules</span> were not so <span>strict</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>People</span> <span>could</span> <span>smoke</span> just about <span>anywhere</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>really</span> wasn't <span>fair</span> to the <span>people</span> who didn't <span>smoke</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Their</span> <span>clothes</span> always <span>smelled</span> like <span>smoke</span>, and they <span>breathed</span> in <span>second-hand</span> <span>smoke</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>people</span> think that <span>second-hand</span> <span>smoke</span> is <span>actually</span> <span>worse</span> for you than if you <span>smoke</span> <span>yourself</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>People</span> would <span>smoke</span> in <span>their</span> <span>houses</span>, and very <span>young</span> <span>children</span> would <span>inhale</span> the <span>smoke</span> that was in the <span>air</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>people</span> still <span>smoke</span> in <span>their</span> <span>houses</span>, and <span>their</span> <span>children</span> <span>breathe</span> in the <span>smoke</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>restaurants</span> have <span>areas</span> for <span>smokers</span> and <span>nonsmokers</span>, but usually the <span>smoke</span> <span>drifts</span> from one <span>area</span> to the other.<br/>
🎧 There are some <span>businesses</span> that have <span>banned</span> <span>smoking</span> <span>altogether</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Personally</span>, I think that <span>smoking</span> in <span>public</span> <span>places</span> should be <span>completely</span> <span>banned</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't think that I should have to <span>breathe</span> in <span>another</span> <span>person's</span> <span>smoke</span> if I <span>choose</span> not to <span>smoke</span> <span>myself</span>.<br/>
🎧 It wouldn't be <span>fair</span> for a <span>nonsmoker</span> to get <span>lung</span> <span>cancer</span> <span>because</span> they had to be in a <span>place</span> where <span>smokers</span> were <span>allowed</span> to <span>light</span> up.<br/>
🎧 I know that <span>smoking</span> is a <span>powerful</span> <span>addiction</span> and that it is very <span>difficult</span> to <span>quit</span>, but <span>smokers</span> should <span>restrict</span> <span>their</span> <span>smoking</span> to <span>places</span> where there is <span>nobody</span> <span>else</span> <span>around</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Lung</span> <span>cancer</span> is an <span>awful</span> <span>disease</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Nobody</span> should have to <span>suffer</span> with <span>lung</span> <span>cancer</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>People</span> should be <span>educated</span> about the <span>dangers</span> of <span>smoking</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Smoking</span> should be <span>banned</span> in <span>public</span> <span>places</span>, but <span>eventually</span> I would like to <span>believe</span> that <span>fewer</span> <span>people</span> will <span>smoke</span>.<br/>
🎧 It would be <span>nice</span> to live in a <span>smoke</span> <span>free</span> <span>environment.<br/>

🎧 My <span>favorite</span> <span>story</span> was <span>Tom's</span> <span>Midnight</span> <span>Garden</span>.<br/>
🎧 This was a <span>story</span> by <span>Philippa</span> <span>Pearce</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>In</span> <span>Tom's</span> <span>Midnight</span> <span>Garden</span> <span>Tom</span> <span>moves</span> to the <span>city</span> to <span>stay</span> with his <span>aunt</span> and <span>uncle</span>.<br/>
🎧 He is very <span>bored</span> at <span>their</span> <span>apartment</span>.<br/>
🎧 They have <span>no</span> <span>children</span>, so <span>Tom</span> has <span>nothing</span> to do.<br/>

🎧 <span>Hattie</span> and <span>Tom</span> <span>become</span> very <span>good</span> <span>friends</span> in this <span>garden</span>.<br/>

🎧 I think that it is just like any other <span>day</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>people</span> <span>believe</span> that if a <span>black</span> cat <span>crosses</span> your <span>path</span>, you will have bad <span>luck</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't <span>believe</span> that <span>either</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mother</span> always <span>gets</span> <span>upset</span> if I <span>open</span> an <span>umbrella</span> in the <span>house</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>says</span> that it is bad <span>luck</span>.<br/>
🎧 She is <span>probably</span> <span>right</span> about that one <span>because</span> an <span>open</span> <span>umbrella</span> would take up a lot <span>of<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>space</span>, and you <span>might</span> <span>knock</span> <span>things</span> over.<br/>
🎧 <span>If</span> your <span>left</span> <span>hand</span> is <span>itchy</span>, you are <span>supposed</span> to get <span>money</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have had an <span>itchy</span> <span>left</span> <span>hand</span> <span>before</span>, but I haven't <span>received</span> any <span>money</span> <span>because</span> of it.<br/>
🎧 It is bad <span>luck</span> to <span>walk</span> <span>under</span> a <span>ladder</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is <span>probably</span> <span>true</span> <span>because</span> you <span>might</span> <span>knock</span> <span>somebody</span> off the <span>ladder</span>, or have a can <span>of<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>paint</span> <span>fall</span> on top of you.<br/>
🎧 <span>If</span> you are <span>acting</span> in a play, it is bad <span>luck</span> if <span>someone</span> <span>says</span> <span>"good</span> <span>luck"</span> to you.<br/>
🎧 This is very <span>confusing</span>.<br/>
🎧 You are <span>supposed</span> to <span>tell</span> an <span>actor</span> to <span>"break</span> a <span>leg."<br/></span> 
🎧 It doesn't <span>mean</span> that you <span>want</span> the <span>actor</span> to <span>break</span> his <span>leg</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>means</span> <span>good</span> <span>luck</span> to the <span>actor</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Actors</span> have a lot of <span>superstitions</span> that are very <span>unusual</span>.<br/>
🎧 I am not <span>superstitious</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't <span>believe</span> in <span>superstitions</span> at all.<br/>
🎧 It is just fun to learn about <span>superstitions</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some of them are very old and have <span>been</span> <span>passed</span> <span>down</span> from <span>generation</span> to <span>generation</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>once</span> did a <span>project</span> at school on <span>superstitions</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was a very <span>interesting</span> <span>topic</span>, and I got a <span>good</span> <span>mark</span> for <span>it.<br/>

🎧 Did you <span>ever</span> have to <span>call</span> for <span>help?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Were</span> you <span>ever</span> in a <span>situation</span> that was an <span>emergency?<br/></span> 
🎧 It is <span>good</span> to know what to do in <span>case</span> of an <span>emergency</span>.<br/>
🎧 You should always know how to get in <span>touch</span> with the <span>police</span> and <span>fire</span> <span>departments</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have <span>read</span> <span>stories</span> where very <span>young</span> <span>boys</span> or <span>girls</span> have <span>called</span> the <span>police</span> and <span>saved</span> <span>their<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>friend's</span> or <span>family</span> <span>member's</span> <span>lives</span> <span>because</span> they <span>knew</span> just who to get <span>hold</span> of.<br/>
🎧 <span>If</span> you see a <span>fire</span>, you should <span>call</span> the <span>fire</span> <span>department</span>.<br/>
🎧 A lot of <span>tragedies</span> have <span>been</span> <span>prevented</span> <span>because</span> the <span>calls</span> have <span>been</span> made <span>quickly</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is <span>important</span> that <span>emergency</span> <span>vehicles</span> <span>arrive</span> very <span>quickly</span>.<br/>

🎧 When <span>their</span> <span>sirens</span> go, it <span>means</span> to get out of the <span>way</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Policemen</span>, <span>firemen</span> and <span>ambulance</span> <span>attendants</span> are <span>trained</span> to <span>handle</span> very <span>difficult</span> <span>situations</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>often</span> <span>save</span> <span>peoples'</span> <span>lives</span>.<br/>
🎧 They go <span>through</span> a lot of <span>training</span> to <span>become</span> <span>good</span> at what they do.<br/>
🎧 They <span>never</span> <span>panic</span> in <span>emergencies</span>.<br/>
🎧 For your <span>part</span>, you should <span>keep</span> <span>emergency</span> <span>numbers</span> <span>near</span> the <span>phone</span>, or know what the <span>emergency</span> <span>numbers</span> are.<br/>
🎧 Where I live, there is a <span>special</span> <span>number</span> that you <span>call</span> for any <span>emergency</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>teach</span> that <span>number</span> to <span>everyone</span>, even very <span>tiny</span> <span>children</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is <span>important</span> to <span>remain</span> <span>calm</span> if you need <span>help</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>If</span> you <span>call</span> an <span>emergency</span> <span>number</span>, you have to be <span>able</span> to <span>speak</span> <span>clearly</span>, and <span>tell</span> the <span>person<br/></span> 
🎧 you are <span>talking</span> to <span>exactly</span> what the <span>problem</span> is.<br/>
🎧 I <span>hope</span> you are <span>never</span> in an <span>emergency</span> <span>situation</span>, but it is a <span>good</span> <span>idea</span> to be <span>prepared.<br/>

🎧 When I was very <span>young</span>, I <span>lived</span> <span>near</span> a <span>peach</span> <span>orchard</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, there is a <span>park</span> where the <span>orchard</span> used to be.<br/>
🎧 I always <span>remember</span> the <span>peach</span> <span>orchard</span> <span>because</span> my <span>grandmother</span> and I used to go <span>there<br/></span> 
🎧 and <span>pick</span> <span>peaches</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>owner</span> of the <span>orchard</span> would let all the <span>neighbors</span> <span>pick</span> <span>peaches</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's not the <span>fact</span> that I used to get many <span>ripe</span>, <span>tasty</span> <span>peaches</span> that I <span>remember;</span> it's the <span>time<br/></span> 
🎧 that I used to <span>spend</span> with my <span>grandmother</span> that I <span>remember</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>grandmother</span> was very old, but she was very <span>healthy</span>.<br/>
🎧 She used to <span>walk</span> a lot.<br/>
🎧 I think that is what <span>kept</span> her <span>fit</span>.<br/>
🎧 She had a lot of <span>energy</span> so she <span>liked</span> to go to a lot of <span>places</span>.<br/>
🎧 She would get a <span>fruit</span> <span>basket</span>, and <span>then</span> she would ask me if I <span>wanted</span> to go to the <span>orchard</span>.<br/>
🎧 I always said <span>yes</span> <span>because</span> I <span>enjoyed</span> <span>walking</span> <span>through</span> the <span>orchard</span> on a <span>sunny</span> <span>day</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>never</span> <span>climbed</span> up on a <span>ladder</span> to <span>reach</span> the <span>peaches;</span> we just <span>reached</span> for the low <span>hanging</span> <span>fruit</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>grandmother</span> and I used to talk all the time that we were out there.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>nice</span> to <span>spend</span> time with her.<br/>
🎧 She <span>told</span> me many <span>stories</span> about when she was a <span>young</span> <span>girl</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>laughed</span> and got to know each other better.<br/>
🎧 My <span>grandmother</span> <span>only</span> <span>visited</span> us <span>during</span> the <span>summer</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>lived</span> in <span>California</span>, and I <span>lived</span> in <span>Niagara</span> <span>Falls</span>, so we didn't get to <span>spend</span> a lot of time with each other.<br/>
🎧 We <span>enjoyed</span> the hot <span>summer</span> <span>days</span> in the <span>orchard</span>.<br/>
🎧 You <span>could</span> <span>smell</span> the <span>peaches</span>, and the <span>bees</span> <span>buzzed</span> <span>lazily</span> by us.<br/>
🎧 My <span>grandmother</span> would <span>point</span> out <span>different</span> <span>insects</span> and <span>birds</span> to me.<br/>
🎧 I <span>learned</span> a lot about <span>nature</span> from her.<br/>
🎧 We would end up with a big <span>basket</span> of <span>peaches</span>.<br/>
🎧 When we got <span>home</span>, my <span>mother</span> would <span>wash</span> the <span>peaches</span>, and <span>often</span> she would <span>bake</span> a <span>peach</span> pie for us.<br/>
🎧 <span>Nobody</span> <span>bakes</span> a <span>peach</span> pie like my <span>mother</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It's <span>good</span> to have <span>memories</span> like that.<br/>
🎧 <span>Childhood</span> <span>memories</span> of time <span>spent</span> with my <span>grandmother</span> are very <span>precious</span> to me.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span>, it's just the <span>simple</span> <span>things</span> that you do in life that <span>leave</span> you with the <span>nicest</span> <span>memories.<br/>

🎧 We <span>went</span> to the <span>hotel</span> that she used to <span>sing</span> at.<br/>

🎧 Some of the <span>people</span> that she <span>knew</span> when she <span>sang</span> in the <span>band</span> were still there.<br/>
🎧 They <span>remembered</span> my <span>mother</span>, and they had a <span>good</span> time <span>talking</span> to her and <span>remembering</span> old <span>times</span>.<br/>
🎧 many <span>people</span> <span>told</span> me that I <span>looked</span> like my <span>mother</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>In</span> the <span>hotel</span>, they had a <span>fancy</span> <span>hall</span> where they had <span>ballroom</span> <span>dancing</span>.<br/>
🎧 I am not used to that <span>kind</span> of <span>dancing</span>.<br/>
🎧 I always <span>dance</span> to <span>rock</span> <span>music</span>.<br/>
🎧 A man <span>told</span> me that he would <span>teach</span> me how to <span>dance</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>looked</span> very <span>easy</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>held</span> one of his <span>hands</span>, and put my other <span>hand</span> on his <span>shoulder</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>told</span> me <span>exactly</span> how to <span>move</span> my <span>feet</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was very <span>clumsy</span>, and I <span>stepped</span> on his <span>toes</span>.<br/>
🎧 He was <span>patient</span> with me, and he <span>counted</span> <span>"one</span>, two, <span>three."<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>tried</span> to <span>waltz</span> with him.<br/>
🎧 I would <span>start</span> out <span>pretty</span> <span>well</span>, but <span>then</span> I would get <span>mixed</span> up and <span>stand</span> on his <span>toes</span> <span>again</span>.<br/>
🎧 The man <span>laughed</span> about it.<br/>
🎧 I <span>told</span> him that I wasn't a very <span>good</span> <span>dancer</span>, but he said that I was <span>good</span> for a <span>beginner</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think he was just being <span>polite</span>.<br/>
🎧 The man <span>asked</span> my <span>mother</span> to <span>dance</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mother</span> is a very <span>good</span> <span>dancer</span>.<br/>
🎧 I didn't know that about her.<br/>
🎧 She <span>never</span> <span>stepped</span> on the <span>man's</span> <span>toes</span> <span>once</span>.<br/>
🎧 The man <span>thanked</span> us for <span>dancing</span> with him, and I <span>thanked</span> him for <span>giving</span> me <span>dancing</span> <span>lessons</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't think <span>I'll</span> <span>ever</span> be very <span>good</span> at that <span>type</span> of <span>dancing</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Each</span> <span>generation</span> has a <span>specific</span> <span>type</span> of <span>dancing</span>.<br/>
🎧 The way that I <span>dance</span> is <span>different</span> from the way that my <span>mother</span> <span>dances</span>.<br/>

🎧 When my <span>brother</span> was very <span>young</span>, he <span>loved</span> <span>super</span> <span>heroes</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>collected</span> <span>plastic</span> <span>figures</span> of all the <span>super</span> <span>heroes</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think he had <span>every</span> <span>super</span> <span>hero</span> <span>figurine</span> that there was. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 He used to tie a <span>towel</span> over his <span>shoulders</span> and run <span>through</span> the back <span>yard</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>pretended</span> that he was <span>rescuing</span> <span>people</span>.<br/>
🎧 One time he <span>stood</span> on the <span>roof</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>really</span> <span>thought</span> that he <span>could</span> fly with his <span>super</span> <span>hero</span> <span>cape</span> on.<br/>
🎧 He would have <span>hurt</span> <span>himself</span> if he had <span>jumped</span>.<br/>
🎧 My dad saw him and <span>told</span> him to get <span>down</span>.<br/>
🎧 My dad <span>explained</span> to my <span>brother</span> that <span>super</span> <span>heroes</span> are not <span>real</span>.<br/>

🎧 My dad <span>explained</span> that <span>most</span> <span>super</span> <span>heroes</span> were <span>created</span> as <span>comic</span> book <span>characters</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Somebody</span> used <span>their</span> <span>imagination</span> to make them up, and <span>then</span> an <span>artist</span> <span>drew</span> them.<br/>
🎧 My <span>brother</span> was not <span>impressed</span>.<br/>
🎧 He said that he <span>wanted</span> to <span>meet</span> the <span>super</span> <span>heroes</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>father</span> <span>told</span> him that he <span>might</span> <span>meet</span> <span>someone</span> <span>dressed</span> up as a <span>super</span> <span>hero</span>, but it wouldn't <span>really</span> be a <span>super</span> <span>hero</span> in the <span>costume</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is <span>hard</span> to <span>explain</span> to <span>small</span> <span>children</span> that the <span>things</span> that they see in <span>comic</span> <span>books</span> and on <span>television</span> aren't <span>really</span> <span>real</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>brother</span> still <span>pretends</span> that he is a <span>super</span> <span>hero</span>.<br/>
🎧 He doesn't <span>jump</span> from <span>rooftops</span>, but he <span>runs</span> <span>around</span> and <span>makes</span> <span>noises</span> like he is <span>flying</span>.<br/>
🎧 I look at him and <span>remember</span> when I used to do <span>things</span> like that.<br/>
