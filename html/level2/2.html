🎧 You <span>would</span> have to <span>watch</span> out for <span>cats</span>, <span>dogs</span> and <span>birds</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>It</span> <span>would</span> be <span>very</span> <span>dangerous</span>, but <span>just</span> <span>think</span> <span>of</span> the <span>things</span> <span>that</span> you <span>could</span> <span>do</span>.<br/>
🎧 You <span>could</span> <span>live</span> <span>in</span> <span>dollhouse</span>, <span>or</span> <span>even</span> a <span>shoebox</span>.<br/>

🎧 My <span>father</span> <span>used</span> to <span>smoke</span>.<br/>

🎧 The <span>doctor</span> <span>told</span> him <span>that</span> <span>he</span> had to <span>quit</span> <span>smoking</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>father</span> <span>tried</span> for a <span>long</span> <span>time</span> to <span>quit</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>After</span> <span>many</span> <span>months</span>, my <span>father</span> <span>finally</span> <span>gave</span> <span>up</span> <span>smoking</span>, but <span>he</span> <span>still</span> <span>craved</span> a <span>cigarette</span> <span>once</span> <span>in</span> a <span>while</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>Some</span> <span>people</span> <span>still</span> <span>smoke</span> <span>in</span> <span>their</span> <span>houses</span>, and <span>their</span> <span>children</span> <span>breathe</span> <span>in</span> the <span>smoke</span>.<br/>

🎧 I <span>know</span> <span>that</span> <span>smoking</span> <span>is</span> a <span>powerful</span> <span>addiction</span> and <span>that</span> <span>it</span> <span>is</span> <span>very</span> <span>difficult</span> to <span>quit</span>, but <span>smokers</span> <span>should</span> <span>restrict</span> <span>their</span> <span>smoking</span> to <span>places</span> where there <span>is</span> <span>nobody</span> <span>else</span> <span>around</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Lung</span> <span>cancer</span> <span>is</span> an <span>awful</span> <span>disease</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Nobody</span> <span>should</span> have to <span>suffer</span> <span>with</span> <span>lung</span> <span>cancer</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>People</span> <span>should</span> be <span>educated</span> <span>about</span> the <span>dangers</span> <span>of</span> <span>smoking</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Smoking</span> <span>should</span> be <span>banned</span> <span>in</span> <span>public</span> <span>places</span>, but <span>eventually</span> I <span>would</span> <span>like</span> to <span>believe</span> <span>that</span> <span>fewer</span> <span>people</span> <span>will</span> <span>smoke</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>Many</span> <span>people</span> <span>told</span> me <span>that</span> I <span>looked</span> <span>like</span> my <span>mother</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>In</span> the <span>hotel</span>, <span>they</span> had a <span>fancy</span> <span>hall</span> where <span>they</span> had <span>ballroom</span> <span>dancing</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>am</span> not <span>used</span> to <span>that</span> <span>kind</span> <span>of</span> <span>dancing</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>always</span> <span>dance</span> to <span>rock</span> <span>music</span>.<br/>
🎧 A man <span>told</span> me <span>that</span> <span>he</span> <span>would</span> <span>teach</span> me how to <span>dance</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>It</span> <span>looked</span> <span>very</span> <span>easy</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>held</span> one <span>of</span> his <span>hands</span>, and put my <span>other</span> <span>hand</span> <span>on</span> his <span>shoulder</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>He</span> <span>told</span> me <span>exactly</span> how to <span>move</span> my <span>feet</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>very</span> <span>clumsy</span>, and I <span>stepped</span> <span>on</span> his <span>toes</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>He</span> was <span>patient</span> <span>with</span> me, and <span>he</span> <span>counted</span> <span>"one</span>, two, <span>three."<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>tried</span> to <span>waltz</span> <span>with</span> <span>him</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>would</span> <span>start</span> out <span>pretty</span> <span>well</span>, but <span>then</span> I <span>would</span> get <span>mixed</span> <span>up</span> and <span>stand</span> <span>on</span> his <span>toes</span> <span>again</span>.<br/>
🎧 The man <span>laughed</span> <span>about</span> <span>it</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>told</span> him <span>that</span> I wasn't a <span>very</span> <span>good</span> <span>dancer</span>, but <span>he</span> <span>said</span> <span>that</span> I was <span>good</span> for a <span>beginner</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>think</span> <span>he</span> was <span>just</span> <span>being</span> <span>polite</span>.<br/>
🎧 The man <span>asked</span> my <span>mother</span> to <span>dance</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mother</span> <span>is</span> a <span>very</span> <span>good</span> <span>dancer</span>.<br/>
🎧 I didn't <span>know</span> <span>that</span> <span>about</span> <span>her</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>never</span> <span>stepped</span> <span>on</span> the <span>man's</span> <span>toes</span> <span>once</span>.<br/>
🎧 The man <span>thanked</span> <span>us</span> for <span>dancing</span> <span>with</span> him, and I <span>thanked</span> him for <span>giving</span> me <span>dancing</span> <span>lessons</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't <span>think</span> <span>I'll</span> <span>ever</span> be <span>very</span> <span>good</span> <span>at</span> <span>that</span> <span>type</span> <span>of</span> <span>dancing</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Each</span> <span>generation</span> has a <span>specific</span> <span>type</span> <span>of</span> <span>dancing</span>.<br/>
🎧 The way <span>that</span> I <span>dance</span> <span>is</span> <span>different</span> <span>from</span> the way <span>that</span> my <span>mother</span> <span>dances</span>.<br/>
🎧 The way <span>that</span> I <span>dance</span> doesn't <span>involve</span> <span>moving</span> your <span>feet</span> too <span>much</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>I'm</span> not too <span>good</span> <span>at</span> <span>fancy</span> <span>steps.<br/>

🎧 When my <span>brother</span> was <span>very</span> <span>young</span>, <span>he</span> <span>loved</span> <span>super</span> <span>heroes</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>He</span> <span>collected</span> <span>plastic</span> <span>figures</span> <span>of</span> all the <span>super</span> <span>heroes</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>think</span> <span>he</span> had <span>every</span> <span>super</span> <span>hero</span> <span>figurine</span> <span>that</span> there was. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>He</span> <span>used</span> to tie a <span>towel</span> <span>over</span> his <span>shoulders</span> and run <span>through</span> the <span>back</span> <span>yard</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>He</span> <span>pretended</span> <span>that</span> <span>he</span> was <span>rescuing</span> <span>people</span>.<br/>
🎧 One <span>time</span> <span>he</span> <span>stood</span> <span>on</span> the <span>roof</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>He</span> <span>really</span> <span>thought</span> <span>that</span> <span>he</span> <span>could</span> fly <span>with</span> his <span>super</span> <span>hero</span> <span>cape</span> <span>on</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>He</span> <span>would</span> have <span>hurt</span> <span>himself</span> <span>if</span> <span>he</span> had <span>jumped</span>.<br/>
🎧 My dad saw him and <span>told</span> him to get <span>down</span>.<br/>
🎧 My dad <span>explained</span> to my <span>brother</span> <span>that</span> <span>super</span> <span>heroes</span> are not <span>real</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Real</span> <span>people</span> <span>cannot</span> fly <span>from</span> <span>rooftops</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>brother</span> was <span>disappointed</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>He</span> <span>thought</span> <span>that</span> the <span>super</span> <span>heroes</span> <span>really</span> <span>existed</span>.<br/>
🎧 My dad <span>explained</span> <span>that</span> <span>most</span> <span>super</span> <span>heroes</span> <span>were</span> <span>created</span> <span>as</span> <span>comic</span> <span>book</span> <span>characters</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Somebody</span> <span>used</span> <span>their</span> <span>imagination</span> to <span>make</span> <span>them</span> <span>up</span>, and <span>then</span> an <span>artist</span> <span>drew</span> <span>them</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>brother</span> was not <span>impressed</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>He</span> <span>said</span> <span>that</span> <span>he</span> <span>wanted</span> to <span>meet</span> the <span>super</span> <span>heroes</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>father</span> <span>told</span> him <span>that</span> <span>he</span> <span>might</span> <span>meet</span> <span>someone</span> <span>dressed</span> <span>up</span> <span>as</span> a <span>super</span> <span>hero</span>, but <span>it</span> wouldn't <span>really</span> be a <span>super</span> <span>hero</span> <span>in</span> the <span>costume</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>It</span> <span>is</span> <span>hard</span> to <span>explain</span> to <span>small</span> <span>children</span> <span>that</span> the <span>things</span> <span>that</span> <span>they</span> see <span>in</span> <span>comic</span> <span>books</span> and <span>on</span> <span>television</span> aren't <span>really</span> <span>real</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>He</span> doesn't <span>jump</span> <span>from</span> <span>rooftops</span>, but <span>he</span> <span>runs</span> <span>around</span> and <span>makes</span> <span>noises</span> <span>like</span> <span>he</span> <span>is</span> <span>flying</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>look</span> <span>at</span> him and <span>remember</span> when I <span>used</span> to do <span>things</span> <span>like</span> <span>that</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>I'm</span> <span>more</span> <span>mature</span> <span>than</span> my <span>brother</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>know</span> <span>that</span> <span>super</span> <span>heroes</span> aren't <span>real</span>, but I <span>know</span> <span>that</span> <span>he</span> <span>is</span> <span>having</span> fun and <span>using</span> his <span>imagination.<br/>
