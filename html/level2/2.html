🎧 Imagine what life would be like if you were two inches tall.<br/>
🎧 You would have to be careful that nobody stepped on you.<br/>
🎧 You would have to watch out for cats, dogs and birds.<br/>
🎧 It would be very dangerous, but just think of the things that you could do.<br/>
🎧 You could live in dollhouse, or even a shoebox.<br/>
🎧 You could use a bottle cap for a plate.<br/>
🎧 You would have to wear dolls' clothes.<br/>
🎧 A stamp would make a lovely picture to hang on your wall.<br/>
🎧 You could hide in a mouse hole or a drawer.<br/>
🎧 You wouldn't need much food.<br/>
🎧 You could probably live comfortably on the crumbs that people would leave on the table.<br/>
🎧 A thimble would make a good cup.<br/>
🎧 If you went outside, the grass would seem like a jungle.<br/>
🎧 An insect would be huge and frightening.<br/>
🎧 A puddle would seem to be an ocean.<br/>
🎧 You could cross the puddle in a paper cup and use a spoon for an oar.<br/>
🎧 A matchbox would make a good bed with a handkerchief as a bedspread.<br/>
🎧 You'd brush your hair with a toothbrush, but you'd never find anything small enough to brush your teeth with.<br/>
🎧 You could take a ride on the back of a mouse.<br/>
🎧 You wouldn't find any books that were small enough to read, but you might read the back of a pill bottle.<br/>
🎧 You could ride in a toy car and have a soup bowl for a swimming pool.<br/>
🎧 A leaf could be your umbrella, and a mitten would make a great sleeping bag.<br/>
🎧 If you used your imagination, you could think up something to use for almost all your purposes.<br/>
🎧 Being small might be fun, but then again, it would be frightening.<br/>
🎧 I'd be afraid of my pet cat.<br/>
🎧 I wouldn't want a book to fall on me.<br/>
🎧 I would be afraid of being swept away by a big gust of wind.<br/>
🎧 I think I'd rather be my size

🎧 If I were a giant, I wouldn't be able to fit in my house.<br/>
🎧 I'd have to live in a building that had a high ceiling, but I'd probably have a hard time getting through the door.<br/>
🎧 I'd have to make my own clothes, but where would I get a giant needle and thread to sew with?<br/>

🎧 I'm very happy the way I am

🎧 My father used to smoke.<br/>
🎧 He got very ill.<br/>
🎧 The doctor told him that he had to quit smoking.<br/>
🎧 My father tried for a long time to quit.<br/>
🎧 It was very difficult for him. <br/> 
🎧 Smoking is an addiction.<br/>
🎧 After many months, my father finally gave up smoking, but he still craved a cigarette once in a while.<br/>
🎧 He says that quitting smoking is the hardest thing that he has ever done.<br/>
🎧 When my father did smoke, he smoked everywhere.<br/>
🎧 He smoked in restaurants, stores and many public buildings.<br/>
🎧 Now, you are not allowed to smoke in a lot of public places.<br/>
🎧 When my father smoked, the rules were not so strict.<br/>
🎧 People could smoke just about anywhere.<br/>
🎧 It really wasn't fair to the people who didn't smoke.<br/>
🎧 Their clothes always smelled like smoke, and they breathed in second-hand smoke.<br/>
🎧 Some people think that second-hand smoke is actually worse for you than if you smoke yourself.<br/>
🎧 People would smoke in their houses, and very young children would inhale the smoke that was in the air.<br/>
🎧 Some people still smoke in their houses, and their children breathe in the smoke.<br/>
🎧 Some restaurants have areas for smokers and nonsmokers, but usually the smoke drifts from one area to the other.<br/>
🎧 There are some businesses that have banned smoking altogether.<br/>
🎧 Personally, I think that smoking in public places should be completely banned.<br/>
🎧 I don't think that I should have to breathe in another person's smoke if I choose not to smoke myself.<br/>
🎧 It wouldn't be fair for a nonsmoker to get lung cancer because they had to be in a place where smokers were allowed to light up.<br/>
🎧 I know that smoking is a powerful addiction and that it is very difficult to quit, but smokers should restrict their smoking to places where there is nobody else around.<br/>
🎧 Lung cancer is an awful disease.<br/>
🎧 Nobody should have to suffer with lung cancer.<br/>
🎧 People should be educated about the dangers of smoking.<br/>
🎧 Smoking should be banned in public places, but eventually I would like to believe that fewer people will smoke.<br/>
🎧 It would be nice to live in a smoke free environment

🎧 Every night when I was little, my mother would read me a bedtime story.<br/>
🎧 My favorite story was Tom's Midnight garden.<br/>
🎧 This was a story by Philippa Pearce.<br/>
🎧 It was quite a long book, and it took quite a few nights for my mother to read the entire book to me.<br/>
🎧 In Tom's Midnight garden Tom moves to the city to stay with his aunt and uncle.<br/>
🎧 He is very bored at their apartment.<br/>
🎧 They have no children, so Tom has nothing to do.<br/>
🎧 One night, the clock strikes thirteen times.<br/>
🎧 Tom knows that this is impossible.<br/>
🎧 A clock can only strike up to twelve times.<br/>
🎧 He sneaks downstairs and goes outside. <br/> 
🎧 When he gets outside, there is a wonderful garden that wasn't there the day before.<br/>
🎧 The next day, Tom goes outside and finds that there is no garden.<br/>
🎧 The garden only seems to appear at night.<br/>
🎧 Every night, Tom slips out to this wonderful garden, and he meets some people in the garden.<br/>
🎧 He meets a girl named Hattie.<br/>
🎧 Hattie and Tom become very good friends in this garden.<br/>
🎧 Some very strange things happen in this book.<br/>
🎧 There are some coincidences that keep you guessing about what is really going on.<br/>
🎧 The surprise ending is wonderful.<br/>
🎧 I really enjoyed Tom's Midnight garden and I was very sad when my mother and I came to the end of the book.<br/>
🎧 I felt that I had visited the magical garden with Tom.<br/>
🎧 It is a book that I will remember all of my life

🎧 If I was walking down the beach on day, and I happened to bump my toe on a magic lamp,<br/> 
🎧 I would pick it up and rub it.<br/>
🎧 If it was a real magic lamp (but I don't believe that there really is a magic lamp), a genie<br/> 
🎧 would pop out in a cloud of smoke, and he would call me master.<br/>
🎧 He would say that he would grant me three wishes.<br/>
🎧 I would have to think very hard about those wishes because I wouldn't want to waste them.<br/>
🎧 I don't think I'd want millions of dollars.<br/>
🎧 Money doesn't buy happiness, or so they say.<br/>
🎧 I might wish for good health, because if your health isn't good you won't be able to enjoy anything.<br/>
🎧 Some people might wish for beauty, but beauty is only skin deep.<br/>
🎧 Some people would wish for a mansion, or a beautiful car or a big boat.<br/>
🎧 I don't want any of those things.<br/>
🎧 Some people would want fame.<br/>
🎧 Some people would want talent.<br/>
🎧 Some people would wish for happiness.<br/>
🎧 That might be a good thing to wish for.<br/>
🎧 Yes, maybe I'd wish for health and happiness, but what would my third wish be?<br/> 
🎧 I could wish for something enormous, something global.<br/>
🎧 I could wish for world peace.<br/>
🎧 That would be a wonderful thing if somebody could grant me that.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that would probably be my third wish.<br/>
🎧 It's too bad there aren't any genies inside magic lamps.<br/>
🎧 I won't get my three wishes.<br/>
🎧 I can still work toward getting my wishes.<br/>
🎧 I can eat well and exercise to stay healthy.<br/>
🎧 I can be involved with a lot of things and be with my friends to stay happy.<br/>
🎧 I can volunteer my time to different organizations to help achieve world peace.<br/>
🎧 I can do my fair share in my community to help others. <br/> 
🎧 That's how I can get my three wishes, not through a magic lamp.<br/>
🎧 I can only get what I want through self-determination and hard work.<br/>
🎧 That is the key to getting your wishes fulfilled

🎧 I don't believe that either.<br/>
🎧 My mother always gets upset if I open an umbrella in the house.<br/>
🎧 She says that it is bad luck.<br/>
🎧 She is probably right about that one because an open umbrella would take up a lot of<br/> 
🎧 space, and you might knock things over.<br/>
🎧 If your left hand is itchy, you are supposed to get money.<br/>
🎧 I have had an itchy left hand before, but I haven't received any money because of it.<br/>
🎧 It is bad luck to walk under a ladder.<br/>
🎧 This is probably true because you might knock somebody off the ladder, or have a can of<br/> 
🎧 paint fall on top of you.<br/>
🎧 If you are acting in a play, it is bad luck if someone says "good luck" to you.<br/>
🎧 This is very confusing.<br/>
🎧 You are supposed to tell an actor to "break a leg."<br/> 
🎧 It doesn't mean that you want the actor to break his leg.<br/>
🎧 It means good luck to the actor.<br/>
🎧 Actors have a lot of superstitions that are very unusual.<br/>
🎧 I am not superstitious.<br/>
🎧 I don't believe in superstitions at all.<br/>
🎧 It is just fun to learn about superstitions.<br/>
🎧 Some of them are very old and have been passed down from generation to generation.<br/>
🎧 I once did a project at school on superstitions.<br/>
🎧 It was a very interesting topic, and I got a good mark for it

🎧 Did you ever have to call for help?<br/> 
🎧 Were you ever in a situation that was an emergency?<br/> 
🎧 It is good to know what to do in case of an emergency.<br/>
🎧 You should always know how to get in touch with the police and fire departments.<br/>
🎧 I have read stories where very young boys or girls have called the police and saved their<br/> 
🎧 friend's or family member's lives because they knew just who to get hold of.<br/>
🎧 If you see a fire, you should call the fire department.<br/>
🎧 A lot of tragedies have been prevented because the calls have been made quickly.<br/>
🎧 It is important that emergency vehicles arrive very quickly.<br/>
🎧 That is why those vehicles have sirens. <br/> 
🎧 When their sirens go, it means to get out of the way.<br/>
🎧 Policemen, firemen and ambulance attendants are trained to handle very difficult situations.<br/>
🎧 They often save peoples' lives.<br/>
🎧 They go through a lot of training to become good at what they do.<br/>
🎧 They never panic in emergencies.<br/>
🎧 For your part, you should keep emergency numbers near the phone, or know what the emergency numbers are.<br/>
🎧 Where I live, there is a special number that you call for any emergency.<br/>
🎧 We teach that number to everyone, even very tiny children.<br/>
🎧 It is important to remain calm if you need help.<br/>
🎧 If you call an emergency number, you have to be able to speak clearly, and tell the person<br/> 
🎧 you are talking to exactly what the problem is.<br/>
🎧 I hope you are never in an emergency situation, but it is a good idea to be prepared

🎧 When I was very young, I lived near a peach orchard.<br/>
🎧 Now, there is a park where the orchard used to be.<br/>
🎧 I always remember the peach orchard because my grandmother and I used to go there<br/> 
🎧 and pick peaches.<br/>
🎧 The owner of the orchard would let all the neighbors pick peaches.<br/>
🎧 It's not the fact that I used to get many ripe, tasty peaches that I remember; it's the time<br/> 
🎧 that I used to spend with my grandmother that I remember.<br/>
🎧 My grandmother was very old, but she was very healthy.<br/>
🎧 She used to walk a lot.<br/>
🎧 I think that is what kept her fit.<br/>
🎧 She had a lot of energy so she liked to go to a lot of places.<br/>
🎧 She would get a fruit basket, and then she would ask me if I wanted to go to the orchard.<br/>
🎧 I always said yes because I enjoyed walking through the orchard on a sunny day.<br/>
🎧 We never climbed up on a ladder to reach the peaches; we just reached for the low hanging fruit.<br/>
🎧 My grandmother and I used to talk all the time that we were out there.<br/>
🎧 It was nice to spend time with her.<br/>
🎧 She told me many stories about when she was a young girl.<br/>
🎧 We laughed and got to know each other better.<br/>
🎧 My grandmother only visited us during the summer.<br/>
🎧 She lived in California, and I lived in Niagara Falls, so we didn't get to spend a lot of time with each other.<br/>
🎧 We enjoyed the hot summer days in the orchard.<br/>
🎧 You could smell the peaches, and the bees buzzed lazily by us.<br/>
🎧 My grandmother would point out different insects and birds to me.<br/>
🎧 I learned a lot about nature from her.<br/>
🎧 We would end up with a big basket of peaches.<br/>
🎧 When we got home, my mother would wash the peaches, and often she would bake a peach pie for us.<br/>
🎧 Nobody bakes a peach pie like my mother. <br/> 
🎧 It's good to have memories like that.<br/>
🎧 Childhood memories of time spent with my grandmother are very precious to me.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes, it's just the simple things that you do in life that leave you with the nicest memories

🎧 My father told him that he might meet someone dressed up as a super hero, but it wouldn't really be a super hero in the costume.<br/>
🎧 It is hard to explain to small children that the things that they see in comic books and on television aren't really real.<br/>
🎧 My brother still pretends that he is a super hero.<br/>
🎧 He doesn't jump from rooftops, but he runs around and makes noises like he is flying.<br/>
🎧 I look at him and remember when I used to do things like that.<br/>
🎧 I'm more mature than my brother.<br/>
🎧 I know that super heroes aren't real, but I know that he is having fun and using his imagination
