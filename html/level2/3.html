🎧 <span>Sometimes</span>, I <span>think</span> <span>that</span> I <span>would</span> <span>like</span> to be a <span>princess.<br/></span> 
🎧 A <span>princess</span> <span>would</span> <span>live</span> <span>in</span> a <span>palace</span> and <span>wear</span> <span>beautiful</span> <span>clothes.<br/></span> 
🎧 She <span>would</span> have <span>servants</span> to do <span>chores</span> for her, and she <span>would</span> <span>probably</span> <span>marry</span> a <span>handsome</span> <span>prince.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>People</span> <span>would</span> <span>recognize</span> <span>her.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>They</span> <span>would</span> <span>wave</span> to her <span>as</span> she <span>drove</span> <span>by.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>It</span> <span>seems</span> <span>like</span> <span>it</span> <span>would</span> be a lot <span>of</span> fun to be a <span>princess.<br/></span> 
🎧 But <span>maybe</span> <span>it</span> wouldn't be so <span>nice.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Maybe</span> <span>it</span> <span>would</span> be <span>terrible</span> to be <span>recognized</span> by <span>everyone.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Maybe</span> a <span>princess</span> <span>would</span> <span>feel</span> <span>like</span> <span>everyone</span> was <span>watching</span> <span>her.<br/></span> 
🎧 She <span>would</span> have to <span>look</span> <span>nice</span> <span>every</span> <span>time</span> she <span>left</span> the <span>palace.<br/></span> 
🎧 There <span>would</span> <span>always</span> be <span>people</span> <span>with</span> <span>cameras</span> who <span>wanted</span> to <span>take</span> her <span>picture.<br/></span> 
🎧 A <span>princess</span> <span>would</span> have <span>no</span> <span>privacy.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Even</span> <span>in</span> her <span>own</span> <span>palace</span> there <span>would</span> be <span>servants</span> <span>around</span>, so she <span>would</span> <span>never</span> <span>really</span> be <span>alone.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>If</span> I <span>were</span> a <span>princess</span>, I <span>would</span> <span>worry</span> <span>about</span> <span>security</span> for my <span>family.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span>, <span>people</span> who are <span>in</span> <span>high</span> <span>positions</span> are <span>threatened</span> by <span>other</span> <span>people.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>That</span> <span>would</span> be a <span>worry.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>I'm</span> not so <span>sure</span> <span>that</span> <span>being</span> a <span>princess</span> <span>would</span> be all <span>that</span> <span>much</span> <span>fun.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>think</span> <span>it</span> <span>might</span> be <span>better</span> to be <span>just</span> a <span>normal</span> <span>person</span> <span>like</span> me. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I don't have to <span>worry</span> <span>about</span> <span>looking</span> <span>wonderful</span> all the <span>time.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>People</span> don't <span>follow</span> me <span>around</span> and <span>take</span> my <span>picture.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Whenever</span> you see a <span>picture</span> <span>of</span> a <span>princess</span>, she <span>is</span> <span>smiling.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>wonder</span> <span>if</span> she <span>is</span> <span>smiling</span> <span>on</span> the <span>inside</span>, <span>or</span> <span>just</span> <span>smiling</span> for the <span>camera.<br/>

🎧 For <span>example</span>, <span>if</span> <span>someone</span> was <span>running</span> <span>in</span> a <span>race</span>, and <span>they</span> did <span>very</span> <span>poorly</span> and <span>came</span> <span>in</span> <span>last</span> <span>it</span> wouldn't be <span>fair</span> to say, <span>"oh</span>, he's <span>just</span> a <span>terrible</span> <span>runner."<br/></span>

🎧 There are two <span>different</span> <span>types</span> <span>of</span> <span>drugs.<br/></span> 
🎧 There are <span>legal</span> <span>drugs</span> and <span>illegal</span> <span>drugs.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Legal</span> <span>drugs</span> are the <span>type</span> <span>of</span> <span>drugs</span> <span>that</span> the <span>doctor</span> <span>gives</span> you when you are <span>sick.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Illegal</span> <span>drugs</span> are the <span>drugs</span> <span>that</span> <span>people</span> <span>sell</span> <span>on</span> the <span>street.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Illegal</span> <span>drugs</span> are <span>very</span> <span>dangerous.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>If</span> <span>someone</span> <span>ever</span> <span>wants</span> you to try any <span>type</span> <span>of</span> <span>substance</span> <span>that</span> you are not <span>sure</span> <span>about</span>, you <span>should</span> <span>always</span> say <span>no.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>People</span> who <span>sell</span> <span>drugs</span> <span>on</span> the <span>street</span> are <span>criminals.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>If</span> <span>they</span> get <span>caught</span>, <span>they</span> <span>will</span> be <span>sent</span> to <span>jail.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>They</span> <span>sell</span> <span>drugs</span> to get <span>money.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>They</span> don't <span>care</span> <span>that</span> <span>people's</span> <span>lives</span> are <span>ruined</span> <span>from</span> <span>taking</span> <span>drugs.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>If</span> you <span>take</span> <span>illegal</span> <span>drugs</span>, you can <span>become</span> <span>addicted</span> to <span>them</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>That</span> <span>means</span> <span>that</span> you <span>just</span> have to have the <span>drug</span> <span>no</span> <span>matter</span> <span>what.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Some</span> <span>people</span> <span>steal</span> <span>from</span> <span>other</span> <span>people</span> to get <span>money</span> to buy <span>drugs.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Drugs</span> <span>affect</span> your <span>mind.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>If</span> you <span>take</span> <span>drugs</span>, you <span>will</span> not be <span>able</span> to <span>think</span> <span>clearly.<br/></span> 
🎧 Your <span>marks</span> <span>in</span> <span>school</span> <span>will</span> <span>drop.<br/></span> 
🎧 Your <span>memory</span> won't be <span>very</span> <span>good.<br/></span> 
🎧 Your <span>personality</span> won't be the <span>same.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>It</span> <span>is</span> <span>very</span> <span>unfortunate</span> <span>that</span> <span>some</span> <span>people</span> do try <span>drugs.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>They</span> <span>think</span> <span>that</span> <span>it</span> won't <span>hurt</span> <span>them.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>They</span> are <span>wrong.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>If</span> you are <span>smart</span>, you <span>will</span> <span>stay</span> <span>away</span> <span>from</span> all <span>drugs</span>, <span>except</span> for the <span>ones</span> <span>that</span> the <span>doctor</span> <span>gives</span> <span>you.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Drugs</span> are <span>just</span> bad <span>news.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>If</span> you <span>know</span> <span>someone</span> who <span>is</span> <span>thinking</span> <span>about</span> <span>trying</span> <span>drugs</span>, <span>tell</span> <span>them</span> <span>that</span> <span>their</span> <span>entire</span> <span>life</span> <span>could</span> be <span>ruined.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>In</span> <span>America</span>, <span>they</span> had a <span>saying.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>"Just</span> say <span>no</span> to <span>drugs."<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>It</span> <span>is</span> a <span>good</span> <span>saying</span>, but I <span>think</span> I <span>would</span> <span>rather</span> say, <span>"I'm</span> <span>just</span> too <span>smart</span> to <span>take</span> <span>drugs."<br/>
