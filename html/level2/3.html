🎧 Sometimes, I think that I would like to be a princess.<br/>
🎧 A princess would live in a palace and wear beautiful clothes.<br/>
🎧 She would have servants to do chores for her, and she would probably marry a handsome prince.<br/>
🎧 People would recognize her.<br/>
🎧 They would wave to her as she drove by.<br/>
🎧 It seems like it would be a lot of fun to be a princess.<br/>
🎧 But maybe it wouldn't be so nice.<br/>
🎧 Maybe it would be terrible to be recognized by everyone.<br/>
🎧 Maybe a princess would feel like everyone was watching her.<br/>
🎧 She would have to look nice every time she left the palace.<br/>
🎧 There would always be people with cameras who wanted to take her picture.<br/>
🎧 A princess would have no privacy.<br/>
🎧 Even in her own palace there would be servants around, so she would never really be alone.<br/>
🎧 If I were a princess, I would worry about security for my family.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes, people who are in high positions are threatened by other people.<br/>
🎧 That would be a worry.<br/>
🎧 I'm not so sure that being a princess would be all that much fun.<br/>
🎧 I think it might be better to be just a normal person like me. <br/> 
🎧 I don't have to worry about looking wonderful all the time.<br/>
🎧 People don't follow me around and take my picture.<br/>
🎧 Whenever you see a picture of a princess, she is smiling.<br/>
🎧 I wonder if she is smiling on the inside, or just smiling for the camera

🎧 I am afraid of water.<br/>
🎧 I don't know why I am afraid.<br/>
🎧 I have never had a bad experience in the water.<br/>
🎧 I just never learned to swim.<br/>
🎧 I should have done that when I was just little.<br/>
🎧 It would be easier for me to swim now if I had started when I was young.<br/>
🎧 I will go into the shallow water, but I start to panic when the water gets higher than my chest.<br/>
🎧 I don't like the feeling of not being able to put my feet on the bottom of the pool or the lake.<br/>
🎧 I don't like to get water up my nose.<br/>
🎧 I choke and cough when that happens.<br/>
🎧 My friends just tell me to relax and I will float, but I find it hard to relax in deep water.<br/>
🎧 They keep telling me that if I panic I will sink.<br/>
🎧 Most of my friends have had swimming lessons.<br/>
🎧 Some of them are even lifeguards.<br/>
🎧 They have tried to teach me to swim, but I think I need to go to a place where they actually teach swimming.<br/>
🎧 It would be so nice to jump into a pool of cold water on a hot summer day.<br/>
🎧 That would be so refreshing.<br/>
🎧 If I go out onto a boat, I always wear a life jacket.<br/>
🎧 I think it is wise to do that.<br/>
🎧 Everyone should wear a life jacket on a boat.<br/>
🎧 I would rather be safe than sorry.<br/>
🎧 I have decided that I will overcome my fear.<br/>
🎧 I will go and take swimming lessons.<br/>
🎧 I have a goal.<br/>
🎧 By this time next year, I would like to be able to swim the length of the pool without being afraid.<br/>
🎧 It is best to face your fears and deal with them.<br/>
🎧 I hope that I can overcome my fear of water

🎧 It is an entire century.<br/>
🎧 Imagine all the changes that you would see if you lived to be 100.<br/>
🎧 I had a neighbor who was 85.<br/>
🎧 She used to tell me what things were like when she was a little girl.<br/>
🎧 She told me what my town used to look like, what her clothes were like, and what her school was like.<br/>
🎧 I used to enjoy listening to her stories.<br/>
🎧 Everything was so different when she was young.<br/>
🎧 Listening to her was like having history come to life.<br/>
🎧 I used to try to imagine what life was like for her back then.<br/>
🎧 If I was 100, and I had grandchildren and great grandchildren, I would tell them stories about my childhood.<br/>
🎧 I would hope that I had a good memory so that I could remember everything.<br/>
🎧 If I do want to live to be 100, I'll have to live a healthy lifestyle.<br/>
🎧 Not too many people live to be that old.<br/>
🎧 If I do get to be that old, I hope I'll still be mentally alert and physically agile.<br/>
🎧 In my country, the Prime Minister sends a letter of congratulations to anyone who has their hundredth birthday.<br/>
🎧 People who live to be 100 are very special.<br/>
🎧 Maybe in the future with better medical care and healthier lifestyles, more people will live to be 100.<br/>
🎧 If I live to be 100, I'll have a birthday cake, but I won't put 100 candles on the cake.<br/>

🎧 I try to be good to my friends.<br/>
🎧 I don't often have arguments with people.<br/>

🎧 The worst thing about me is that I sometimes feel sad.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes I don't feel sad for any particular reason.<br/>
🎧 I just get into moods where I am depressed.<br/>

🎧 I was sad when my pet frog died.<br/>
🎧 I was sad when I lost my favorite baseball card.<br/>
🎧 On those days, I'm still nice to my friends, but inside I feel like there is a heavy weight in my chest.<br/>
🎧 I think that everyone feels sadness sometimes.<br/>
🎧 I try to do things that make me happy whenever I get into one of my sad moods.<br/>
🎧 Last Saturday, I felt a bit sad so I called up my friend John and asked him if he wanted to go to the movies.<br/>
🎧 We went to a comedy.<br/>
🎧 We laughed all the way through the movie, so that by the time the movie was over, I didn't feel sad anymore.<br/>

🎧 Have you ever heard the saying "walk a mile in my shoes?"<br/> 
🎧 I think it is a very good saying.<br/>
🎧 Do you know what it means?<br/> 
🎧 It means, that before you judge someone, you should put yourself in his or her position.<br/>
🎧 For example, if someone was running in a race, and they did very poorly and came in last it wouldn't be fair to say, "oh, he's just a terrible runner."<br/> 
🎧 You would have to look at all the circumstances that made the person lose the race.<br/>
🎧 Maybe they pulled a muscle in their leg the day before; maybe this is their very first race; maybe they are not in good form because something isn't right in their lives.<br/>
🎧 There can be so many things that affect a person's life, performance and moods.<br/>
🎧 If someone was very quiet at a party, you couldn't just assume that they weren't friendly.<br/>
🎧 You don't know what is happening in their lives.<br/>
🎧 They could be feeling ill, or they might have just had a bad experience.<br/>
🎧 Nobody can know exactly how another person feels.<br/>
🎧 Even if someone tells you what he or she is experiencing, you still won't fully understand what is going on inside the other person.<br/>
🎧 Everyone perceives and feels things differently.<br/>
🎧 To walk a mile in someone else's shoes is to try and understand things from that person's perspective.<br/>
🎧 We are all shaped by the events that have taken place in our lives.<br/>
🎧 No two people have gone through the exact same things. <br/> 
🎧 So, before you are quick to judge someone, stop and think about what it is that they might have gone through.<br/>
🎧 You won't always understand why people do what they do, but you can try to understand and put yourself in their position

🎧 Illegal drugs are very dangerous.<br/>
🎧 If someone ever wants you to try any type of substance that you are not sure about, you should always say no.<br/>
