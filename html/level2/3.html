🎧 Sometimes, I think that I would like to be a <span>princess</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>princess</span> would live in a <span>palace</span> and <span>wear</span> <span>beautiful</span> <span>clothes</span>.<br/>
🎧 She would have <span>servants</span> to do <span>chores</span> for her, and she would probably <span>marry</span> a <span>handsome</span> <span>prince</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>People</span> would <span>recognize</span> her.<br/>
🎧 They would <span>wave</span> to her as she <span>drove</span> <span>by</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>seems</span> like it would be a lot of fun to be a <span>princess</span>.<br/>
🎧 But maybe it wouldn't be so nice.<br/>
🎧 Maybe it would be <span>terrible</span> to be <span>recognized</span> by everyone.<br/>
🎧 Maybe a <span>princess</span> would feel like everyone was <span>watching</span> her.<br/>
🎧 She would have to look nice every time she <span>left</span> the <span>palace</span>.<br/>
🎧 There would always be people with <span>cameras</span> who <span>wanted</span> to take her <span>picture</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>princess</span> would have no <span>privacy</span>.<br/>
🎧 Even in her own <span>palace</span> there would be <span>servants</span> around, so she would never really be <span>alone</span>.<br/>
🎧 If I were a <span>princess</span>, I would <span>worry</span> about <span>security</span> for my <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes, people who are in high <span>positions</span> are <span>threatened</span> by other people.<br/>
🎧 That would be a <span>worry</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm not so sure that being a <span>princess</span> would be all that much fun.<br/>
🎧 I think it might be better to be just a <span>normal</span> person like me. <br/> 
🎧 I don't have to <span>worry</span> about <span>looking</span> <span>wonderful</span> all the time.<br/>
🎧 <span>People</span> don't <span>follow</span> me around and take my <span>picture</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Whenever</span> you see a <span>picture</span> of a <span>princess</span>, she is <span>smiling</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>wonder</span> if she is <span>smiling</span> on the inside, or just <span>smiling</span> for the <span>camera.<br/>

🎧 I am <span>afraid</span> of water.<br/>
🎧 I don't know why I am <span>afraid</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have never had a bad <span>experience</span> in the water.<br/>
🎧 I just never <span>learned</span> to <span>swim</span>.<br/>
🎧 I should have done that when I was just little.<br/>
🎧 It would be <span>easier</span> for me to <span>swim</span> now if I had <span>started</span> when I was young.<br/>
🎧 I will go into the <span>shallow</span> water, but I start to <span>panic</span> when the water <span>gets</span> <span>higher</span> than my <span>chest</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't like the feeling of not being able to put my <span>feet</span> on the <span>bottom</span> of the <span>pool</span> or the <span>lake</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't like to get water up my <span>nose</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>choke</span> and <span>cough</span> when that <span>happens</span>.<br/>
🎧 My friends just tell me to <span>relax</span> and I will <span>float</span>, but I find it <span>hard</span> to <span>relax</span> in <span>deep</span> water.<br/>
🎧 They keep <span>telling</span> me that if I <span>panic</span> I will <span>sink</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Most</span> of my friends have had <span>swimming</span> <span>lessons</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some of them are even <span>lifeguards</span>.<br/>
🎧 They have <span>tried</span> to <span>teach</span> me to <span>swim</span>, but I think I need to go to a place where they <span>actually</span> <span>teach</span> <span>swimming</span>.<br/>
🎧 It would be so nice to <span>jump</span> into a <span>pool</span> of <span>cold</span> water on a hot <span>summer</span> day.<br/>
🎧 That would be so <span>refreshing</span>.<br/>
🎧 If I go out <span>onto</span> a <span>boat</span>, I always <span>wear</span> a life <span>jacket</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think it is <span>wise</span> to do that.<br/>
🎧 Everyone should <span>wear</span> a life <span>jacket</span> on a <span>boat</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would rather be <span>safe</span> than <span>sorry</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have <span>decided</span> that I will <span>overcome</span> my <span>fear</span>.<br/>
🎧 I will go and take <span>swimming</span> <span>lessons</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have a <span>goal</span>.<br/>
🎧 By this time next year, I would like to be able to <span>swim</span> the <span>length</span> of the <span>pool</span> without being <span>afraid</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is best to <span>face</span> your <span>fears</span> and <span>deal</span> with them.<br/>
🎧 I hope that I can <span>overcome</span> my <span>fear</span> of <span>water.<br/>

🎧 It is an <span>entire</span> <span>century</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Imagine</span> all the changes that you would see if you <span>lived</span> to be <span>100</span>.<br/>
🎧 I had a <span>neighbor</span> who was <span>85</span>.<br/>
🎧 She used to tell me what things were like when she was a little <span>girl</span>.<br/>
🎧 She told me what my <span>town</span> used to look like, what her <span>clothes</span> were like, and what her school was like.<br/>
🎧 I used to enjoy <span>listening</span> to her <span>stories</span>.<br/>
🎧 Everything was so different when she was young.<br/>
🎧 <span>Listening</span> to her was like having <span>history</span> come to life.<br/>
🎧 I used to try to <span>imagine</span> what life was like for her back then.<br/>
🎧 If I was <span>100</span>, and I had <span>grandchildren</span> and great <span>grandchildren</span>, I would tell them <span>stories</span> about my <span>childhood</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would hope that I had a good <span>memory</span> so that I could <span>remember</span> everything.<br/>
🎧 If I do want to live to be <span>100</span>, I'll have to live a <span>healthy</span> <span>lifestyle</span>.<br/>
🎧 Not too many people live to be that <span>old</span>.<br/>
🎧 If I do get to be that old, I hope I'll still be <span>mentally</span> <span>alert</span> and <span>physically</span> <span>agile</span>.<br/>
🎧 In my <span>country</span>, the <span>Prime</span> <span>Minister</span> <span>sends</span> a <span>letter</span> of <span>congratulations</span> to <span>anyone</span> who has their <span>hundredth</span> <span>birthday</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>People</span> who live to be <span>100</span> are very special.<br/>
🎧 Maybe in the future with better <span>medical</span> <span>care</span> and <span>healthier</span> <span>lifestyles</span>, more people will live to be <span>100</span>.<br/>
🎧 If I live to be <span>100</span>, I'll have a <span>birthday</span> <span>cake</span>, but I won't put <span>100</span> <span>candles</span> on the <span>cake</span>.<br/>
🎧 I could never <span>blow</span> out <span>100</span> <span>candles.<br/>

🎧 I was trying to think up the best and the <span>worst</span> things about myself.<br/>
🎧 I think the best thing about me is that I am very <span>friendly</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have a lot of friends, and they all like me.<br/>
🎧 I try to be good to my friends.<br/>
🎧 I don't often have <span>arguments</span> with people.<br/>
🎧 I think that I am quite <span>easy</span> to get along with.<br/>
🎧 The <span>worst</span> thing about me is that I sometimes feel <span>sad</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes I don't feel sad for any <span>particular</span> <span>reason</span>.<br/>
🎧 I just get into <span>moods</span> where I am <span>depressed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes there is a <span>reason</span> to be <span>sad</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was sad when my pet <span>frog</span> <span>died</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was sad when I <span>lost</span> my <span>favorite</span> <span>baseball</span> <span>card</span>.<br/>
🎧 On <span>those</span> <span>days</span>, I'm still nice to my friends, but inside I feel like there is a <span>heavy</span> <span>weight</span> in my <span>chest</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think that everyone <span>feels</span> <span>sadness</span> sometimes.<br/>
🎧 I try to do things that make me happy <span>whenever</span> I get into one of my sad <span>moods</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Last</span> <span>Saturday</span>, I <span>felt</span> a bit sad so I <span>called</span> up my friend <span>John</span> and <span>asked</span> him if he <span>wanted</span> to go to the <span>movies</span>.<br/>
🎧 We went to a <span>comedy</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>laughed</span> all the way through the <span>movie</span>, so that by the time the <span>movie</span> was over, I didn't feel sad <span>anymore</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>friendliness</span> is my best <span>trait</span>, and my sad <span>moods</span> are my <span>worst</span> <span>traits</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have to work at getting over my sad <span>moods</span> more quickly.<br/>
🎧 <span>Being</span> sad doesn't do <span>anyone</span> any good.<br/>
🎧 There is no use in feeling <span>sorry</span> for <span>oneself.<br/>

🎧 I was happy that she <span>asked</span> me.<br/>
🎧 My <span>grandmother</span> <span>says</span> that her <span>attic</span> is full of <span>junk</span>.<br/>

🎧 Have you ever <span>heard</span> the saying <span>"walk</span> a <span>mile</span> in my <span>shoes?"<br/></span> 
🎧 I think it is a very good saying.<br/>
🎧 Do you know what it <span>means?<br/></span> 
🎧 It <span>means</span>, that before you <span>judge</span> <span>someone</span>, you should put <span>yourself</span> in his or her <span>position</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, if <span>someone</span> was <span>running</span> in a <span>race</span>, and they did very <span>poorly</span> and came in last it wouldn't be <span>fair</span> to say, <span>"oh</span>, he's just a <span>terrible</span> <span>runner."<br/></span> 
🎧 You would have to look at all the <span>circumstances</span> that made the person <span>lose</span> the <span>race</span>.<br/>
🎧 Maybe they <span>pulled</span> a <span>muscle</span> in their leg the day <span>before;</span> maybe this is their very first <span>race;</span> maybe they are not in good <span>form</span> because something isn't right in their lives.<br/>
🎧 There can be so many things that <span>affect</span> a <span>person's</span> life, <span>performance</span> and <span>moods</span>.<br/>
🎧 If <span>someone</span> was very <span>quiet</span> at a <span>party</span>, you couldn't just <span>assume</span> that they weren't <span>friendly</span>.<br/>
🎧 You don't know what is <span>happening</span> in their lives.<br/>
🎧 They could be feeling ill, or they might have just had a bad <span>experience</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Nobody</span> can know exactly how another person <span>feels</span>.<br/>
🎧 Even if <span>someone</span> tells you what he or she is <span>experiencing</span>, you still won't <span>fully</span> <span>understand</span> what is going on inside the other person.<br/>
🎧 Everyone <span>perceives</span> and <span>feels</span> things <span>differently</span>.<br/>
🎧 To <span>walk</span> a <span>mile</span> in <span>someone</span> <span>else's</span> <span>shoes</span> is to try and <span>understand</span> things from that <span>person's</span> <span>perspective</span>.<br/>
🎧 We are all <span>shaped</span> by the <span>events</span> that have taken place in our lives.<br/>
🎧 No two people have <span>gone</span> through the <span>exact</span> same things. <br/> 
🎧 So, before you are <span>quick</span> to <span>judge</span> <span>someone</span>, <span>stop</span> and think about what it is that they might have <span>gone</span> through.<br/>
🎧 You won't always <span>understand</span> why people do what they do, but you can try to <span>understand</span> and put <span>yourself</span> in their <span>position.<br/>

🎧 If I could go back in my life and do some things <span>differently</span>, this is what I would <span>do:<br/></span> 
🎧 I would not <span>waste</span> so many <span>hours</span> in <span>front</span> of the <span>television</span> <span>set</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would get out and enjoy my own life, rather than <span>watching</span> <span>actors</span> in <span>shows</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would be a little more <span>considerate</span> of other people.<br/>
🎧 I would <span>realize</span> that my <span>mother</span> has more to do than <span>pick</span> up after me.<br/>
🎧 I would pay more <span>attention</span> in school.<br/>
🎧 <span>Tests</span> are <span>easier</span> when you have <span>paid</span> <span>attention</span>, rather than <span>fooling</span> around in class.<br/>
🎧 I would <span>save</span> more money rather than <span>spend</span> it on <span>useless</span> things.<br/>
🎧 I would read more.<br/>
🎧 <span>Reading</span> is <span>enjoyable</span>, and it <span>opens</span> the <span>doors</span> into all <span>kinds</span> of <span>wonderful</span> <span>places</span> both <span>real</span> and <span>imagined</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would learn to play an <span>instrument</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Music</span> is always <span>appreciated</span> if it is <span>played</span> well.<br/>
🎧 I would eat better <span>foods</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would try to <span>stay</span> <span>healthy</span> through my <span>diet</span> and <span>exercise</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would take more <span>pictures</span>, and I would keep a <span>journal</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Memories</span> are very <span>precious</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would take the time to listen to what people have to say.<br/>
🎧 <span>People</span> <span>appreciate</span> a good <span>listener</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would take the time to enjoy each day as it comes.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes, I am so <span>busy</span> <span>looking</span> <span>forward</span> to what is <span>coming</span> up that I don't take the time to enjoy the day that I am living in.<br/>
🎧 That's what I would do if I could go back in my life.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, I think I'll just make a <span>habit</span> of doing all of <span>those</span> things all through my life.<br/>
🎧 I think I would like to live to be <span>100.<br/>

🎧 <span>Joking</span> is good.<br/>
🎧 <span>Jokes</span> can be very funny.<br/>
🎧 <span>Jokes</span> can also be <span>hurtful</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Jokes</span> can be <span>tasteless</span> too.<br/>
🎧 It is not an <span>easy</span> thing to find <span>jokes</span> that do not <span>offend</span> <span>anyone</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>jokes</span> make fun of different <span>races</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Those</span> <span>jokes</span> are not funny.<br/>
🎧 They are <span>hurtful</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is not right to tell <span>racist</span> <span>jokes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Many <span>jokes</span> use bad <span>language</span> or are about <span>questionable</span> <span>subject</span> <span>matter</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>These</span> <span>jokes</span> are also not <span>acceptable</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Many people are <span>highly</span> <span>offended</span> by <span>rude</span> <span>jokes</span>.<br/>
🎧 What some people find funny, <span>others</span> will not.<br/>
🎧 <span>Comedy</span> is a very <span>personal</span> thing.<br/>
🎧 Some people like <span>slapstick</span> <span>comedy</span>.<br/>
🎧 That is the kind of <span>comedy</span> that the <span>Three</span> <span>Stooges</span> <span>use</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some people like very <span>subtle</span> <span>humor</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some people will <span>laugh</span> at just about anything.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes, it is not <span>appropriate</span> to <span>laugh</span>, but you feel like <span>laughing</span> <span>anyway</span>.<br/>
🎧 Did you ever see <span>anyone</span> <span>fall</span> <span>down?<br/></span> 
🎧 Did you feel like <span>laughing</span> when they <span>fell</span> <span>down?<br/></span> 
🎧 You were probably <span>worried</span> that they had <span>hurt</span> <span>themselves</span>, yet the way that they <span>fell</span> was so funny that you <span>felt</span> like <span>laughing</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's not funny when <span>someone</span> <span>falls</span>, but you can't help but <span>laugh</span> even though you try to <span>hide</span> it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Jokes</span> and <span>comedy</span> <span>differ</span> from <span>culture</span> to <span>culture</span>.<br/>
🎧 Many people from other <span>countries</span> come here and don't <span>understand</span> our <span>comedy</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Jokes</span> and <span>comedies</span> are often <span>geared</span> <span>toward</span> our <span>environment</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes, <span>comedians</span> make fun of the things that we do in our <span>everyday</span> lives like going to the <span>bank</span>, or going <span>grocery</span> <span>shopping</span>.<br/>
🎧 We can all <span>relate</span> to that.<br/>
🎧 <span>Being</span> a <span>comedian</span> is not an <span>easy</span> job.<br/>
🎧 <span>Telling</span> <span>jokes</span> and <span>making</span> people <span>laugh</span> is <span>extremely</span> <span>difficult</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Jokes</span> are fun, and they are funny if they are good.<br/>
🎧 <span>Jokes</span> can get you into a lot of <span>trouble</span> if they are <span>inappropriate</span>, and sometimes <span>they're<br/></span> 
🎧 just not funny and <span>nobody</span> <span>laughs</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Here</span> is a <span>joke</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why does a cow <span>wear</span> a <span>bell?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>-</span> because its <span>horns</span> don't <span>work<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you get <span>it?<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you think it is <span>funny?<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, maybe it's not that funny.<br/>
🎧 I told you that it was <span>difficult</span> being a <span>comedian.<br/>

🎧 There are two different <span>types</span> of <span>drugs</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>legal</span> <span>drugs</span> and <span>illegal</span> <span>drugs</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Legal</span> <span>drugs</span> are the <span>type</span> of <span>drugs</span> that the <span>doctor</span> <span>gives</span> you when you are <span>sick</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Illegal</span> <span>drugs</span> are the <span>drugs</span> that people sell on the <span>street</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Illegal</span> <span>drugs</span> are very <span>dangerous</span>.<br/>
🎧 If <span>someone</span> ever <span>wants</span> you to try any <span>type</span> of <span>substance</span> that you are not sure about, you should always say no.<br/>
🎧 <span>People</span> who sell <span>drugs</span> on the <span>street</span> are <span>criminals</span>.<br/>
🎧 If they get <span>caught</span>, they will be <span>sent</span> to <span>jail</span>.<br/>
🎧 They sell <span>drugs</span> to get money.<br/>
🎧 They don't <span>care</span> that <span>people's</span> lives are <span>ruined</span> from taking <span>drugs</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you take <span>illegal</span> <span>drugs</span>, you can become <span>addicted</span> to them. <br/> 
🎧 That <span>means</span> that you just have to have the <span>drug</span> no <span>matter</span> what.<br/>
🎧 Some people <span>steal</span> from other people to get money to buy <span>drugs</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Drugs</span> <span>affect</span> your <span>mind</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you take <span>drugs</span>, you will not be able to think <span>clearly</span>.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>marks</span> in school will <span>drop</span>.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>memory</span> won't be very good.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>personality</span> won't be the same.<br/>
🎧 It is very <span>unfortunate</span> that some people do try <span>drugs</span>.<br/>
🎧 They think that it won't <span>hurt</span> them.<br/>
🎧 They are wrong.<br/>
🎧 If you are <span>smart</span>, you will <span>stay</span> away from all <span>drugs</span>, <span>except</span> for the <span>ones</span> that the <span>doctor</span> <span>gives</span> you.<br/>
🎧 <span>Drugs</span> are just bad <span>news</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you know <span>someone</span> who is thinking about trying <span>drugs</span>, tell them that their <span>entire</span> life could be <span>ruined</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>America</span>, they had a saying.<br/>
🎧 <span>"Just</span> say no to <span>drugs."<br/></span> 
🎧 It is a good saying, but I think I would rather say, <span>"I'm</span> just too <span>smart</span> to take <span>drugs."<br/>
