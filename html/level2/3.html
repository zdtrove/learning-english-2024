🎧 <span>Sometimes</span>, I think that I would like to be a <span>princess</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>princess</span> would live in a <span>palace</span> and <span>wear</span> <span>beautiful</span> <span>clothes</span>.<br/>
🎧 She would have <span>servants</span> to do <span>chores</span> for her, and she would <span>probably</span> <span>marry</span> a <span>handsome</span> <span>prince</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>People</span> would <span>recognize</span> her.<br/>
🎧 They would <span>wave</span> to her as she <span>drove</span> <span>by</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>seems</span> like it would be a lot of fun to be a <span>princess</span>.<br/>
🎧 But <span>maybe</span> it wouldn't be so <span>nice</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Maybe</span> it would be <span>terrible</span> to be <span>recognized</span> by <span>everyone</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Maybe</span> a <span>princess</span> would feel like <span>everyone</span> was <span>watching</span> her.<br/>
🎧 She would have to look <span>nice</span> <span>every</span> time she <span>left</span> the <span>palace</span>.<br/>
🎧 There would always be <span>people</span> with <span>cameras</span> who <span>wanted</span> to take her <span>picture</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>princess</span> would have <span>no</span> <span>privacy</span>.<br/>
🎧 Even in her own <span>palace</span> there would be <span>servants</span> <span>around</span>, so she would <span>never</span> <span>really</span> be <span>alone</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>If</span> I were a <span>princess</span>, I would <span>worry</span> about <span>security</span> for my <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span>, <span>people</span> who are in high <span>positions</span> are <span>threatened</span> by other <span>people</span>.<br/>
🎧 That would be a <span>worry</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>I'm</span> not so sure that being a <span>princess</span> would be all that much <span>fun</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think it <span>might</span> be better to be just a <span>normal</span> <span>person</span> like me. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I don't have to <span>worry</span> about <span>looking</span> <span>wonderful</span> all the time.<br/>
🎧 <span>People</span> don't <span>follow</span> me <span>around</span> and take my <span>picture</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Whenever</span> you see a <span>picture</span> of a <span>princess</span>, she is <span>smiling</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>wonder</span> if she is <span>smiling</span> on the <span>inside</span>, or just <span>smiling</span> for the <span>camera.<br/>

🎧 I am <span>afraid</span> of <span>water</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't know why I am <span>afraid</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have <span>never</span> had a bad <span>experience</span> in the <span>water</span>.<br/>
🎧 I just <span>never</span> <span>learned</span> to <span>swim</span>.<br/>
🎧 I should have <span>done</span> that when I was just little.<br/>
🎧 It would be <span>easier</span> for me to <span>swim</span> now if I had <span>started</span> when I was <span>young</span>.<br/>
🎧 I will go into the <span>shallow</span> <span>water</span>, but I <span>start</span> to <span>panic</span> when the <span>water</span> <span>gets</span> <span>higher</span> than my <span>chest</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't like the <span>feeling</span> of not being <span>able</span> to put my <span>feet</span> on the <span>bottom</span> of the <span>pool</span> or the <span>lake</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't like to get <span>water</span> up my <span>nose</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>choke</span> and <span>cough</span> when that <span>happens</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>friends</span> just <span>tell</span> me to <span>relax</span> and I will <span>float</span>, but I find it <span>hard</span> to <span>relax</span> in <span>deep</span> <span>water</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>keep</span> <span>telling</span> me that if I <span>panic</span> I will <span>sink</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Most</span> of my <span>friends</span> have had <span>swimming</span> <span>lessons</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some of them are even <span>lifeguards</span>.<br/>
🎧 They have <span>tried</span> to <span>teach</span> me to <span>swim</span>, but I think I need to go to a <span>place</span> where they <span>actually</span> <span>teach</span> <span>swimming</span>.<br/>
🎧 It would be so <span>nice</span> to <span>jump</span> into a <span>pool</span> of <span>cold</span> <span>water</span> on a hot <span>summer</span> <span>day</span>.<br/>
🎧 That would be so <span>refreshing</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>If</span> I go out <span>onto</span> a <span>boat</span>, I always <span>wear</span> a life <span>jacket</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think it is <span>wise</span> to do that.<br/>
🎧 <span>Everyone</span> should <span>wear</span> a life <span>jacket</span> on a <span>boat</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would <span>rather</span> be <span>safe</span> than <span>sorry</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have <span>decided</span> that I will <span>overcome</span> my <span>fear</span>.<br/>
🎧 I will go and take <span>swimming</span> <span>lessons</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have a <span>goal</span>.<br/>
🎧 By this time <span>next</span> <span>year</span>, I would like to be <span>able</span> to <span>swim</span> the <span>length</span> of the <span>pool</span> <span>without</span> being <span>afraid</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is <span>best</span> to <span>face</span> your <span>fears</span> and <span>deal</span> with them.<br/>
🎧 I <span>hope</span> that I can <span>overcome</span> my <span>fear</span> of <span>water.<br/>

🎧 <span>Imagine</span> all the <span>changes</span> that you would see if you <span>lived</span> to be <span>100</span>.<br/>
🎧 I had a <span>neighbor</span> who was <span>85</span>.<br/>
🎧 She used to <span>tell</span> me what <span>things</span> were like when she was a little <span>girl</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>told</span> me what my <span>town</span> used to look like, what her <span>clothes</span> were like, and what her school was like.<br/>
🎧 I used to enjoy <span>listening</span> to her <span>stories</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Everything</span> was so <span>different</span> when she was <span>young</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Listening</span> to her was like <span>having</span> <span>history</span> <span>come</span> to life.<br/>
🎧 I used to try to <span>imagine</span> what life was like for her back <span>then</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>If</span> I was <span>100</span>, and I had <span>grandchildren</span> and <span>great</span> <span>grandchildren</span>, I would <span>tell</span> them <span>stories</span> about my <span>childhood</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would <span>hope</span> that I had a <span>good</span> <span>memory</span> so that I <span>could</span> <span>remember</span> <span>everything</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>If</span> I do <span>want</span> to live to be <span>100</span>, <span>I'll</span> have to live a <span>healthy</span> <span>lifestyle</span>.<br/>
🎧 Not too many <span>people</span> live to be that <span>old</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>In</span> my <span>country</span>, the <span>Prime</span> <span>Minister</span> <span>sends</span> a <span>letter</span> of <span>congratulations</span> to <span>anyone</span> who has <span>their</span> <span>hundredth</span> <span>birthday</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>People</span> who live to be <span>100</span> are very <span>special</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Maybe</span> in the <span>future</span> with better <span>medical</span> <span>care</span> and <span>healthier</span> <span>lifestyles</span>, more <span>people</span> will live to be <span>100</span>.<br/>

🎧 I have a lot of <span>friends</span>, and they all like me.<br/>

🎧 I just get into <span>moods</span> where I am <span>depressed</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span> there is a <span>reason</span> to be <span>sad</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was sad when my pet <span>frog</span> <span>died</span>.<br/>

🎧 I think that <span>everyone</span> <span>feels</span> <span>sadness</span> <span>sometimes</span>.<br/>

🎧 We <span>went</span> to a <span>comedy</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>laughed</span> all the way <span>through</span> the <span>movie</span>, so that by the time the <span>movie</span> was over, I didn't feel sad <span>anymore</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>Last</span> <span>month</span> my <span>grandmother</span> <span>asked</span> me if I <span>could</span> <span>help</span> her to <span>clean</span> out her <span>attic</span>.<br/>

🎧 My <span>favorite</span> <span>thing</span> that I did was to <span>sort</span> <span>through</span> the old <span>trunk</span> that she had up there.<br/>
🎧 The <span>trunk</span> had a <span>rusty</span> <span>latch</span> on it.<br/>
🎧 It was a bit <span>difficult</span> to <span>open</span>, but my <span>grandmother</span> got a <span>knife</span> and <span>pried</span> the <span>latch</span> <span>open</span>.<br/>

🎧 It was a <span>beautiful</span> <span>dress</span>, but there were a few <span>moth</span> <span>holes</span> in it.<br/>
🎧 There were some of my <span>mother's</span> old <span>clothes</span>.<br/>

🎧 I couldn't <span>believe</span> that my <span>mother</span> had <span>ever</span> <span>worn</span> <span>something</span> like that.<br/>
🎧 There were some of my <span>mother's</span> old <span>report</span> <span>cards</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some of her <span>marks</span> weren't very <span>good</span>.<br/>
🎧 I had fun <span>reading</span> the <span>report</span> <span>cards</span>.<br/>

🎧 There was even one of my old <span>dolls</span> in there.<br/>
🎧 One of her <span>legs</span> was <span>missing</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>grandmother</span> said that I was <span>rough</span> with my <span>dolls</span> when I was little.<br/>
🎧 I should have <span>taken</span> better <span>care</span> of my <span>toys</span>.<br/>

🎧 Have you <span>ever</span> <span>heard</span> the <span>saying</span> <span>"walk</span> a <span>mile</span> in my <span>shoes?"<br/></span> 
🎧 I think it is a very <span>good</span> <span>saying</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you know what it <span>means?<br/></span> 
🎧 It <span>means</span>, that <span>before</span> you <span>judge</span> <span>someone</span>, you should put <span>yourself</span> in his or her <span>position</span>.<br/>
🎧 For <span>example</span>, if <span>someone</span> was <span>running</span> in a <span>race</span>, and they did very <span>poorly</span> and <span>came</span> in <span>last</span> it wouldn't be <span>fair</span> to say, <span>"oh</span>, he's just a <span>terrible</span> <span>runner."<br/></span> 
🎧 You would have to look at all the <span>circumstances</span> that made the <span>person</span> <span>lose</span> the <span>race</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Maybe</span> they <span>pulled</span> a <span>muscle</span> in <span>their</span> leg the day <span>before;</span> <span>maybe</span> this is <span>their</span> very <span>first</span> <span>race;</span> <span>maybe</span> they are not in <span>good</span> <span>form</span> <span>because</span> <span>something</span> isn't <span>right</span> in <span>their</span> <span>lives</span>.<br/>
🎧 There can be so many <span>things</span> that <span>affect</span> a <span>person's</span> life, <span>performance</span> and <span>moods</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>If</span> <span>someone</span> was very <span>quiet</span> at a <span>party</span>, you couldn't just <span>assume</span> that they weren't <span>friendly</span>.<br/>
🎧 You don't know what is <span>happening</span> in <span>their</span> <span>lives</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>could</span> be <span>feeling</span> ill, or they <span>might</span> have just had a bad <span>experience</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Nobody</span> can know <span>exactly</span> how <span>another</span> <span>person</span> <span>feels</span>.<br/>
🎧 Even if <span>someone</span> <span>tells</span> you what he or she is <span>experiencing</span>, you still won't <span>fully</span> <span>understand</span> what is <span>going</span> on <span>inside</span> the other <span>person</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Everyone</span> <span>perceives</span> and <span>feels</span> <span>things</span> <span>differently</span>.<br/>
🎧 To <span>walk</span> a <span>mile</span> in <span>someone</span> <span>else's</span> <span>shoes</span> is to try and <span>understand</span> <span>things</span> from that <span>person's</span> <span>perspective</span>.<br/>
🎧 We are all <span>shaped</span> by the <span>events</span> that have <span>taken</span> <span>place</span> in our <span>lives</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>No</span> two <span>people</span> have <span>gone</span> <span>through</span> the <span>exact</span> <span>same</span> <span>things</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 So, <span>before</span> you are <span>quick</span> to <span>judge</span> <span>someone</span>, <span>stop</span> and think about what it is that they <span>might</span> have <span>gone</span> <span>through</span>.<br/>
🎧 You won't always <span>understand</span> why <span>people</span> do what they do, but you can try to <span>understand</span> and put <span>yourself</span> in <span>their</span> <span>position.<br/>

🎧 <span>If</span> I <span>could</span> go back in my life and do some <span>things</span> <span>differently</span>, this is what I would <span>do:<br/></span> 
🎧 I would not <span>waste</span> so many <span>hours</span> in <span>front</span> of the <span>television</span> <span>set</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would get out and enjoy my own life, <span>rather</span> than <span>watching</span> <span>actors</span> in <span>shows</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would be a little more <span>considerate</span> of other <span>people</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would <span>realize</span> that my <span>mother</span> has more to do than <span>pick</span> up <span>after</span> me.<br/>
🎧 I would pay more <span>attention</span> in school.<br/>
🎧 <span>Tests</span> are <span>easier</span> when you have <span>paid</span> <span>attention</span>, <span>rather</span> than <span>fooling</span> <span>around</span> in <span>class</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would <span>save</span> more <span>money</span> <span>rather</span> than <span>spend</span> it on <span>useless</span> <span>things</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would <span>read</span> more.<br/>
🎧 <span>Reading</span> is <span>enjoyable</span>, and it <span>opens</span> the <span>doors</span> into all <span>kinds</span> of <span>wonderful</span> <span>places</span> <span>both</span> <span>real</span> and <span>imagined</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would learn to play an <span>instrument</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Music</span> is always <span>appreciated</span> if it is <span>played</span> <span>well</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would eat better <span>foods</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would try to <span>stay</span> <span>healthy</span> <span>through</span> my <span>diet</span> and <span>exercise</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would take more <span>pictures</span>, and I would <span>keep</span> a <span>journal</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Memories</span> are very <span>precious</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would take the time to <span>listen</span> to what <span>people</span> have to say.<br/>
🎧 <span>People</span> <span>appreciate</span> a <span>good</span> <span>listener</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would take the time to enjoy each day as it <span>comes</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span>, I am so <span>busy</span> <span>looking</span> <span>forward</span> to what is <span>coming</span> up that I don't take the time to enjoy the day that I am <span>living</span> in.<br/>
🎧 That's what I would do if I <span>could</span> go back in my life.<br/>
🎧 <span>In</span> <span>fact</span>, I think <span>I'll</span> just make a <span>habit</span> of <span>doing</span> all of <span>those</span> <span>things</span> all <span>through</span> my life.<br/>
🎧 I think I would like to live to be <span>100.<br/>

🎧 There are <span>legal</span> <span>drugs</span> and <span>illegal</span> <span>drugs</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Legal</span> <span>drugs</span> are the <span>type</span> of <span>drugs</span> that the <span>doctor</span> <span>gives</span> you when you are <span>sick</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Illegal</span> <span>drugs</span> are the <span>drugs</span> that <span>people</span> <span>sell</span> on the <span>street</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Illegal</span> <span>drugs</span> are very <span>dangerous</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>If</span> <span>someone</span> <span>ever</span> <span>wants</span> you to try any <span>type</span> of <span>substance</span> that you are not sure about, you should always say <span>no</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>People</span> who <span>sell</span> <span>drugs</span> on the <span>street</span> are <span>criminals</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>If</span> they get <span>caught</span>, they will be <span>sent</span> to <span>jail</span>.<br/>

🎧 Some <span>people</span> <span>steal</span> from other <span>people</span> to get <span>money</span> to buy <span>drugs</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Drugs</span> <span>affect</span> your <span>mind</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>If</span> you take <span>drugs</span>, you will not be <span>able</span> to think <span>clearly</span>.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>marks</span> in school will <span>drop</span>.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>memory</span> won't be very <span>good</span>.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>personality</span> won't be the <span>same</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is very <span>unfortunate</span> that some <span>people</span> do try <span>drugs</span>.<br/>
🎧 They think that it won't <span>hurt</span> them.<br/>
🎧 They are <span>wrong</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>If</span> you are <span>smart</span>, you will <span>stay</span> <span>away</span> from all <span>drugs</span>, <span>except</span> for the <span>ones</span> that the <span>doctor</span> <span>gives</span> you.<br/>
🎧 <span>Drugs</span> are just bad <span>news</span>.<br/>
