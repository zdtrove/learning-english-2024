🎧 Many of my friends have <span>dyed</span> their <span>hair</span> different <span>colors</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't mean <span>normal</span> <span>hair</span> <span>colors</span> like <span>brown</span> or <span>black</span>.<br/>
🎧 My friends have <span>dyed</span> their <span>hair</span> <span>orange</span>, <span>purple</span> and <span>blue</span>.<br/>
🎧 I told my <span>mother</span> that I would like to dye my <span>hair</span> <span>green</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>explained</span> to my <span>mother</span> that I would only use food <span>coloring</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>green</span> would not last <span>forever</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mother</span> said that <span>dyeing</span> your <span>hair</span> was a <span>silly</span> <span>fad</span>.<br/>
🎧 She said that I would not look good with <span>green</span> <span>hair</span>.<br/>
🎧 I said that if I couldn't dye my <span>hair</span> <span>green</span>, maybe I could get a <span>nose</span> <span>ring</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mother</span> said <span>"no."</span><br/> 
🎧 I said that maybe a <span>tattoo</span> on my arm would be nice.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mother</span> said <span>"no</span> <span>way."</span><br/> 
🎧 My <span>mother</span> said that she did some <span>crazy</span> things when she was a young girl.<br/>
🎧 She said that she used to <span>iron</span> her <span>hair</span> to make it <span>straight</span>.<br/>
🎧 That sounds quite <span>boring</span> to me.<br/>
🎧 My friend <span>Joan</span> came over.<br/>
🎧 Her <span>hair</span> is <span>dyed</span> <span>bright</span> <span>pink</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>father</span> said <span>"nice</span> <span>hair</span>, <span>Joan."</span><br/> 
🎧 I don't think that he really <span>meant</span> it.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mother</span> says that when I am an <span>adult</span> I can dye my <span>hair</span> whatever <span>crazy</span> color I like, but for now she would like me to leave my <span>hair</span> its <span>natural</span> color.<br/>
🎧 I <span>tried</span> to tell her that all my friends were doing it.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mother</span> <span>asked</span>, <span>"if</span> all your friends were <span>jumping</span> off a <span>cliff</span>, would you do it <span>too?"</span><br/> 
🎧 I said <span>"no."</span><br/> 
🎧 I think I'll have to wait to have <span>green</span> <span>hair</span>, but maybe by the time I'm old enough to dye my <span>hair</span> <span>green</span>, I won't want it that color.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mother</span> says that <span>fads</span> change all the time.<br/>
🎧 One day something might be <span>popular</span>, and the next day it's not in <span>style</span> at all. <br/> 
🎧 I'll just have to live without <span>green</span> <span>hair</span> for now.<br/>
🎧 I <span>wonder</span> what the fad will be next <span>month

🎧 Some people don't like other people just because they look different.<br/>
🎧 I think that is <span>silly</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't think that it is <span>fair</span> to <span>judge</span> someone by the way they look.<br/>
🎧 Some people look very nice, but they are mean or <span>cruel</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some people look very <span>ordinary</span>, but they are <span>incredibly</span> nice.<br/>
🎧 I <span>remember</span> when I was in <span>grade</span> <span>one;</span> I saw a girl across the room.<br/>
🎧 She had a mean look on her <span>face</span>.<br/>
🎧 I thought to myself that she was probably not a very nice person.<br/>
🎧 I <span>stayed</span> away from her, and <span>played</span> with the other <span>children</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Then</span>, we had to play a game, and the <span>teacher</span> said that she would <span>pick</span> <span>partners</span> for us.<br/>
🎧 The <span>teacher</span> <span>picked</span> the girl with the mean <span>face</span> as my <span>partner</span>.<br/>
🎧 I didn't think that the game would be much fun at all with a <span>partner</span> who <span>seemed</span> as mean as that girl.<br/>
🎧 I <span>walked</span> up to her and said hello.<br/>
🎧 The <span>girl's</span> <span>face</span> <span>changed</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>smiled</span> at me, and she <span>began</span> to talk to me.<br/>
🎧 Her mean <span>face</span> <span>disappeared</span>.<br/>
🎧 We had lots of fun playing the game.<br/>
🎧 We <span>laughed</span> a lot and <span>enjoyed</span> each <span>other's</span> <span>company</span>.<br/>
🎧 That girl <span>became</span> my best friend.<br/>
🎧 Now when I look at her I see what is inside her.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes she doesn't <span>smile</span>, but I know what she is like.<br/>
🎧 She is a kind and funny person.<br/>
🎧 I have <span>learned</span> that you can't <span>"judge</span> a book by its <span>cover."</span><br/> 
🎧 It is not <span>fair</span> to <span>dislike</span> someone just because they don't look like you want them to look.<br/>
🎧 You have to get to know a person.<br/>
🎧 It doesn't <span>matter</span> to me what color a <span>person's</span> <span>skin</span> is.<br/>
🎧 It doesn't <span>matter</span> to me if they are short or <span>tall</span>, <span>skinny</span> or fat or happy or sad looking.<br/>
🎧 I <span>judge</span> people by how they <span>treat</span> me, and I try to <span>treat</span> people like I would want to be <span>treated

🎧 What can I give <span>him</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I don't have much money.<br/>
🎧 I have <span>looked</span> all through the <span>stores</span>, and I have not <span>found</span> anything that I think he would like, or that I can <span>afford</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have thought very <span>hard</span> about what to buy for him.<br/>
🎧 I thought that he might like some <span>candy</span>, but my <span>father</span> really doesn't eat many <span>sweets</span>.<br/>

🎧 I can't <span>afford</span> a new car or <span>computer</span> for him.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>watching</span> him on the weekend.<br/>
🎧 He cut the <span>grass</span>, <span>washed</span> the car, took out the <span>garbage</span>, <span>weeded</span> the garden and <span>watered</span> the <span>plants</span>.<br/>
🎧 I got an idea.<br/>
🎧 I went to my room and took out some <span>paper</span>.<br/>
🎧 I cut out <span>pieces</span> of <span>paper</span>, and I <span>wrote</span> on them.<br/>
🎧 I <span>wrote</span> on one <span>piece</span> of <span>paper</span> that I would <span>wash</span> the car every weekend for the <span>summer</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>wrote</span> on another <span>piece</span> that I would take out the <span>garbage</span> every week for the <span>summer</span>.<br/>
🎧 I also <span>wrote</span> that I would cut the <span>grass</span>, <span>weed</span> the garden and water the <span>plants</span> every week for the <span>summer</span>.<br/>
🎧 I made a <span>birthday</span> <span>card</span> for my dad, and I put the <span>pieces</span> of <span>paper</span> inside it.<br/>
🎧 I went <span>downstairs</span> and gave my <span>gift</span> to my <span>dad</span>.<br/>
🎧 My dad thought that the <span>gift</span> was very <span>thoughtful</span>.<br/>
🎧 He said that it was a <span>gift</span> from the <span>heart</span>.<br/>
🎧 I did all those things for my dad all <span>summer</span>.<br/>
🎧 He said that he had a lot of free time because I <span>helped</span> him so much.<br/>
🎧 My dad and I are good friends.<br/>
🎧 I don't <span>mind</span> doing things for him because I know that he is always there to help me out.<br/>
🎧 A good <span>gift</span> doesn't have to be something that <span>costs</span> a lot.<br/>
🎧 My dad says that the best <span>gifts</span> are the <span>ones</span> that show how much you <span>care</span> for the other person.<br/>

🎧 On New <span>Year's</span> Day people start a new year.<br/>
🎧 Many people make <span>resolutions</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>resolve</span> to be better people.<br/>
🎧 Some people decide that they will <span>lose</span> <span>weight</span> so that they can be <span>healthier</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some people decide to give up <span>smoking</span>.<br/>
🎧 They also want to be <span>healthier</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are all <span>kinds</span> of <span>resolutions</span> that people make.<br/>
🎧 Some people try not to <span>lose</span> their <span>tempers</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some people say that they will work <span>harder</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are people who try to give up bad <span>habits</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Every</span> year, my <span>brother</span> says that he will <span>stop</span> <span>biting</span> his <span>nails</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>stops</span> <span>biting</span> his <span>nails</span> in <span>January</span>, but by <span>February</span> he always <span>starts</span> again.<br/>
🎧 That is the thing about New <span>Year's</span> <span>resolutions</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>People</span> <span>seldom</span> keep them.<br/>
🎧 <span>Everybody</span> <span>starts</span> out with good <span>intentions</span>, but it is very <span>hard</span> to <span>stick</span> with them.<br/>
🎧 I don't make New <span>Year's</span> <span>resolutions</span>.<br/>
🎧 I find that I just <span>break</span> them.<br/>
🎧 I just work day by day to <span>break</span> my bad <span>habits</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know that I eat too many <span>sweets</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Every</span> day, I just try to <span>resist</span> them.<br/>
🎧 I think that every day is a new day <span>regardless</span> of <span>whether</span> it is New <span>Year's</span> Day or not. <br/> 
🎧 Bad <span>habits</span> are <span>hard</span> to <span>break</span>.<br/>
🎧 The best thing is never to start any bad <span>habits</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't know if my <span>brother</span> will ever <span>stop</span> <span>biting</span> his <span>nails</span>, but I know that each <span>January</span> he <span>intends</span> to <span>stop</span>.<br/>
🎧 Maybe one of these New <span>Year's</span> <span>Days</span> he'll get over that <span>habit

🎧 I sometimes <span>imagine</span> what it would be like if I could fly like a <span>bird</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Just</span> <span>imagine</span> what it would be like to <span>soar</span> into the sky, <span>flying</span> high <span>above</span> the <span>trees</span>.<br/>
🎧 You could <span>stand</span> on high <span>rooftops</span> and never be <span>afraid</span> of <span>falling</span>.<br/>
🎧 You would see so many things as you <span>flew</span> over <span>rooftops</span> and <span>forests</span>.<br/>

🎧 If I could fly like a <span>bird</span>, I would start from my back <span>yard</span> and travel through <span>town</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would look down on the <span>houses</span> and <span>factories</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I got <span>tired</span>, I would <span>land</span> in a <span>field</span> and take a <span>nap</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would travel <span>above</span> <span>rivers</span>, and <span>follow</span> them as they <span>wound</span> along and <span>emptied</span> into <span>lakes</span> and <span>oceans</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would fly <span>above</span> <span>parks</span>, and I would call out to the <span>children</span> as I <span>flew</span> high <span>above</span> them.<br/>
🎧 I would dip and <span>dive</span> as I <span>flew</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would <span>soar</span> up high and <span>dive</span> down low so that I could almost touch the <span>treetops</span>.<br/>
🎧 Have you ever <span>flown</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I know that you can't fly like a <span>bird</span>, but you might have taken an <span>airplane</span> <span>ride</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you're in an <span>airplane</span>, you <span>pass</span> through <span>clouds</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is <span>exciting</span> to take an <span>airplane</span> <span>ride</span>.<br/>
🎧 I love taking <span>airplane</span> <span>flights</span>.<br/>
🎧 I like to look down at the <span>Earth</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you are up that high, everything <span>below</span> you looks <span>tiny</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's the <span>closest</span> I'll get to <span>flying</span> like a <span>bird</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I can still use my <span>imagination</span> and <span>spread</span> my <span>wings</span> and <span>soar</span> high <span>above</span> the <span>world</span> just like a <span>bird

🎧 Sometimes my <span>mother</span> <span>gives</span> me advice.<br/>
🎧 She tells me to <span>save</span> my money for a <span>rainy</span> day.<br/>
🎧 She says that I should eat my <span>vegetables</span> if I want to be <span>strong</span> when I <span>grow</span> up.<br/>
🎧 She says that you <span>reap</span> what you <span>sow</span>.<br/>
🎧 I didn't know what that one <span>meant</span>, so I <span>asked</span> her.<br/>
🎧 She said that if you are good to people, they will be good to you.<br/>
🎧 If you do bad things, then bad things will come back to you.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mother</span> is always <span>giving</span> me advice.<br/>
🎧 She says that a <span>penny</span> <span>saved</span> is a <span>penny</span> <span>earned</span>.<br/>
🎧 I am still thinking about that one.<br/>
🎧 Some of these things are <span>difficult</span> to <span>understand</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mother</span> is very <span>wise</span>.<br/>
🎧 She says that she has <span>learned</span> from her <span>mistakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 She tells me that she would like me not to make <span>mistakes</span>, but she says that everyone does make <span>mistakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>important</span> thing is that we learn from our <span>mistakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mother</span> says that <span>nobody</span> is perfect.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mother</span> tells my <span>sister</span> that time is <span>precious</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>sister</span> <span>wastes</span> time, and my <span>mother</span> doesn't like that.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mother</span> tells me to be <span>true</span> to myself.<br/>
🎧 She says that I should not <span>follow</span> the <span>crowd</span>.<br/>
🎧 I should listen to my own <span>conscience</span> and do what I think is right.<br/>
🎧 She says that it doesn't <span>matter</span> if you <span>fail</span> at something, the <span>important</span> thing is that you <span>try</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you've done your best, then that is all that <span>matters</span>.<br/>
🎧 I listen to my <span>mother</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think she <span>gives</span> very good advice.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mother</span> has a lot of <span>common</span> <span>sense</span>.<br/>
🎧 I hope I am as <span>wise</span> as she is when I have <span>children</span> of my own.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes I wish that she would not give me so much advice.<br/>
🎧 I think that I know what I'm doing.<br/>
🎧 But, in the end, I always <span>remember</span> what she has said, and I try to live by the <span>standards</span> that she has set for me.<br/>
🎧 <span>Take</span> the advice that your <span>parents</span> give you.<br/>
🎧 They only have your best <span>interests</span> at <span>heart
</span>.<br/><br/>

🎧 I have to get my <span>tonsils</span> out.<br/>
🎧 I'm not really happy about it, but I'm <span>tired</span> of being <span>sick</span> and having <span>sore</span> <span>throats</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have to go to the <span>hospital</span> two hours before my <span>surgery</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mother</span> will go with me.<br/>
🎧 The <span>nurses</span> will take my <span>temperature</span> and check my <span>blood</span> <span>pressure</span>.<br/>
🎧 They will make sure that I am ready for my <span>operation</span>.<br/>
🎧 I will be <span>dressed</span> in a <span>white</span> <span>gown</span>, and I will be <span>wheeled</span> down the <span>hall</span> to the <span>operating</span> room.<br/>
🎧 I can't have anything to eat or drink for a long time before my <span>surgery</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mother</span> will <span>walk</span> down the <span>hall</span> with <span>me;</span> then she will <span>wave</span> <span>goodbye</span> as they <span>wheel</span> me into the <span>operating</span> room.<br/>
🎧 The <span>doctor</span> and the <span>nurses</span> will be <span>busy</span> in the <span>operating</span> room.<br/>

🎧 The <span>doctor</span> will say hello to me and tell me that he is going to put me to <span>sleep</span>.<br/>
🎧 He will put something into my <span>arm</span>.<br/>
🎧 He will tell me to <span>count</span> <span>backwards</span> from <span>ten</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think that I will only say <span>"ten</span>, <span>nine,"</span> and then I will be <span>fast</span> <span>asleep</span>.<br/>
🎧 I won't be <span>awake</span> for the <span>surgery</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I <span>wake</span> up, I will be <span>surprised</span> that the <span>surgery</span> is over.<br/>
🎧 My <span>throat</span> will <span>hurt</span>, and I probably won't feel very good.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mother</span> will be there with me.<br/>
🎧 The <span>nurses</span> will give me a drink and try to make me <span>comfortable</span>.<br/>
🎧 I won't be in the <span>hospital</span> <span>overnight</span>.<br/>
🎧 I will go home later in the day.<br/>
🎧 My <span>parents</span> will have to make sure that I have a lot to drink.<br/>
🎧 I can't eat any <span>hard</span> <span>foods</span> or they will <span>hurt</span> my <span>throat</span>.<br/>
🎧 I will <span>sleep</span> a lot, because I will not feel very well for a <span>couple</span> of <span>days</span>.<br/>
🎧 It won't take long before I <span>recover</span> from my <span>surgery</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes, we need <span>surgery</span> to make us feel better.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hospitals</span> can be a bit <span>frightening</span>, but the <span>doctors</span> and <span>nurses</span> are very nice, and their job is to make you <span>better

🎧 One day I was <span>sitting</span> in a <span>chair</span> <span>drinking</span> a cup of <span>tea</span>.<br/>
🎧 My cat came into the room and <span>sat</span> on my <span>lap</span>.<br/>
🎧 She was quite <span>content</span>, and she <span>sat</span> there <span>purring</span>.<br/>
🎧 My cat likes to drink water, and sometimes she <span>drinks</span> <span>milk</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would never give her tea to drink.<br/>
🎧 <span>Cats</span> just don't drink <span>tea</span>.<br/>
🎧 We were <span>sitting</span> there <span>quietly</span> when <span>suddenly</span> my cat <span>stood</span> up.<br/>
🎧 She was looking at something on the <span>floor</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>crouched</span> down low and got ready to <span>pounce</span>.<br/>
🎧 I saw what she was looking at.<br/>
🎧 It was a <span>huge</span> <span>centipede</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think that <span>centipedes</span> are <span>ugly</span>.<br/>
🎧 They have many <span>legs</span>, and they move very <span>fast</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I would <span>hate</span> to have one <span>crawl</span> over me.<br/>
🎧 My cat <span>jumped</span> to the <span>floor</span> and she ran over to the <span>centipede</span>.<br/>
🎧 She was <span>incredibly</span> <span>fast</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>surprised</span> that she <span>caught</span> the <span>centipede</span>.<br/>
🎧 She put her paw on it, and then she <span>reached</span> down and ate the <span>centipede</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>centipede</span> must not have <span>tasted</span> very good.<br/>
🎧 My cat got a funny look on her <span>face</span>, and she <span>looked</span> like she was trying to get a bad <span>taste</span> out of her <span>mouth</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was thinking that I would be <span>sick</span> if I ate a <span>centipede</span>.<br/>
🎧 My cat <span>looked</span> at me and <span>jumped</span> back up in my <span>chair</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>stuck</span> her <span>face</span> in my <span>teacup</span> and took a big drink of <span>tea</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>shocked</span>.<br/>
🎧 I had never <span>seen</span> a cat drink tea before.<br/>
🎧 I think that the <span>centipede</span> must have <span>tasted</span> so bad that my cat just <span>needed</span> something to <span>wash</span> the <span>taste</span> out of her <span>mouth</span><br/> 
🎧 <span>Guess</span> what?<br/> 
🎧 I didn't <span>finish</span> my <span>tea</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>threw</span> it out and <span>washed</span> out the <span>cup</span>.<br/>
🎧 My cat has never had a drink of tea since that day.<br/>
🎧 She has also never <span>eaten</span> another <span>centipede</span>.<br/>
🎧 If a <span>centipede</span> <span>walks</span> by, she just <span>pretends</span> that she doesn't see <span>it
</span>.<br/><br/><br/>
