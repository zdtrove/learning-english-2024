🎧 Many of my friends have dyed their hair different colors.<br/>
🎧 I don't mean normal hair colors like brown or black.<br/>
🎧 My friends have dyed their hair orange, purple and blue.<br/>
🎧 I told my mother that I would like to dye my hair green.<br/>
🎧 I explained to my mother that I would only use food coloring.<br/>
🎧 The green would not last forever.<br/>
🎧 My mother said that dyeing your hair was a silly fad.<br/>
🎧 She said that I would not look good with green hair.<br/>
🎧 I said that if I couldn't dye my hair green, maybe I could get a nose ring.<br/>
🎧 My mother said "no."<br/> 
🎧 I said that maybe a tattoo on my arm would be nice.<br/>
🎧 My mother said "no way."<br/> 
🎧 My mother said that she did some crazy things when she was a young girl.<br/>
🎧 She said that she used to iron her hair to make it straight.<br/>
🎧 That sounds quite boring to me.<br/>
🎧 My friend Joan came over.<br/>
🎧 Her hair is dyed bright pink.<br/>
🎧 My father said "nice hair, Joan."<br/> 
🎧 I don't think that he really meant it.<br/>
🎧 My mother says that when I am an adult I can dye my hair whatever crazy color I like, but for now she would like me to leave my hair its natural color.<br/>
🎧 I tried to tell her that all my friends were doing it.<br/>
🎧 My mother asked, "if all your friends were jumping off a cliff, would you do it too?"<br/> 
🎧 I said "no."<br/> 
🎧 I think I'll have to wait to have green hair, but maybe by the time I'm old enough to dye my hair green, I won't want it that color.<br/>
🎧 My mother says that fads change all the time.<br/>
🎧 One day something might be popular, and the next day it's not in style at all. <br/> 
🎧 I'll just have to live without green hair for now.<br/>
🎧 I wonder what the fad will be next month

🎧 Some people don't like other people just because they look different.<br/>
🎧 I think that is silly.<br/>
🎧 I don't think that it is fair to judge someone by the way they look.<br/>
🎧 Some people look very nice, but they are mean or cruel.<br/>
🎧 Some people look very ordinary, but they are incredibly nice.<br/>
🎧 I remember when I was in grade one; I saw a girl across the room.<br/>
🎧 She had a mean look on her face.<br/>
🎧 I thought to myself that she was probably not a very nice person.<br/>
🎧 I stayed away from her, and played with the other children.<br/>
🎧 Then, we had to play a game, and the teacher said that she would pick partners for us.<br/>
🎧 The teacher picked the girl with the mean face as my partner.<br/>
🎧 I didn't think that the game would be much fun at all with a partner who seemed as mean as that girl.<br/>
🎧 I walked up to her and said hello.<br/>
🎧 The girl's face changed.<br/>
🎧 She smiled at me, and she began to talk to me.<br/>
🎧 Her mean face disappeared.<br/>
🎧 We had lots of fun playing the game.<br/>
🎧 We laughed a lot and enjoyed each other's company.<br/>
🎧 That girl became my best friend.<br/>
🎧 Now when I look at her I see what is inside her.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes she doesn't smile, but I know what she is like.<br/>
🎧 She is a kind and funny person.<br/>
🎧 I have learned that you can't "judge a book by its cover."<br/> 
🎧 It is not fair to dislike someone just because they don't look like you want them to look.<br/>
🎧 You have to get to know a person.<br/>
🎧 It doesn't matter to me what color a person's skin is.<br/>
🎧 It doesn't matter to me if they are short or tall, skinny or fat or happy or sad looking.<br/>
🎧 I judge people by how they treat me, and I try to treat people like I would want to be treated

🎧 What can I give him?<br/> 
🎧 I don't have much money.<br/>
🎧 I have looked all through the stores, and I have not found anything that I think he would like, or that I can afford.<br/>
🎧 I have thought very hard about what to buy for him.<br/>

🎧 I thought that he might like a new shirt, but he has lots of clothes. <br/> 
🎧 I can't afford a new car or computer for him.<br/>
🎧 I was watching him on the weekend.<br/>
🎧 He cut the grass, washed the car, took out the garbage, weeded the garden and watered the plants.<br/>
🎧 I got an idea.<br/>
🎧 I went to my room and took out some paper.<br/>
🎧 I cut out pieces of paper, and I wrote on them.<br/>
🎧 I wrote on one piece of paper that I would wash the car every weekend for the summer.<br/>
🎧 I wrote on another piece that I would take out the garbage every week for the summer.<br/>
🎧 I also wrote that I would cut the grass, weed the garden and water the plants every week for the summer.<br/>
🎧 I made a birthday card for my dad, and I put the pieces of paper inside it.<br/>

🎧 On New Year's Day people start a new year.<br/>
🎧 Many people make resolutions.<br/>
🎧 They resolve to be better people.<br/>
🎧 Some people decide that they will lose weight so that they can be healthier.<br/>
🎧 Some people decide to give up smoking.<br/>
🎧 They also want to be healthier.<br/>
🎧 There are all kinds of resolutions that people make.<br/>
🎧 Some people try not to lose their tempers.<br/>
🎧 Some people say that they will work harder.<br/>
🎧 There are people who try to give up bad habits.<br/>
🎧 Every year, my brother says that he will stop biting his nails.<br/>
🎧 He stops biting his nails in January, but by February he always starts again.<br/>
🎧 That is the thing about New Year's resolutions.<br/>
🎧 People seldom keep them.<br/>
🎧 Everybody starts out with good intentions, but it is very hard to stick with them.<br/>
🎧 I don't make New Year's resolutions.<br/>
🎧 I find that I just break them.<br/>
🎧 I just work day by day to break my bad habits.<br/>
🎧 I know that I eat too many sweets.<br/>
🎧 Every day, I just try to resist them.<br/>
🎧 I think that every day is a new day regardless of whether it is New Year's Day or not. <br/> 
🎧 Bad habits are hard to break.<br/>
🎧 The best thing is never to start any bad habits.<br/>
🎧 I don't know if my brother will ever stop biting his nails, but I know that each January he intends to stop.<br/>
🎧 Maybe one of these New Year's Days he'll get over that habit

🎧 I sometimes imagine what it would be like if I could fly like a bird.<br/>
🎧 Just imagine what it would be like to soar into the sky, flying high above the trees.<br/>
🎧 You could stand on high rooftops and never be afraid of falling.<br/>
🎧 You would see so many things as you flew over rooftops and forests.<br/>
🎧 You would feel incredibly free as you traveled from place to place, not bothered by road signs or traffic jams.<br/>
🎧 If I could fly like a bird, I would start from my back yard and travel through town.<br/>
🎧 I would look down on the houses and factories.<br/>
🎧 When I got tired, I would land in a field and take a nap.<br/>
🎧 I would travel above rivers, and follow them as they wound along and emptied into lakes and oceans.<br/>
🎧 I would fly above parks, and I would call out to the children as I flew high above them.<br/>
🎧 I would dip and dive as I flew.<br/>
🎧 I would soar up high and dive down low so that I could almost touch the treetops.<br/>
🎧 Have you ever flown?<br/> 
🎧 I know that you can't fly like a bird, but you might have taken an airplane ride.<br/>
🎧 When you're in an airplane, you pass through clouds.<br/>
🎧 It is exciting to take an airplane ride.<br/>
🎧 I love taking airplane flights.<br/>
🎧 I like to look down at the Earth.<br/>
🎧 When you are up that high, everything below you looks tiny.<br/>

🎧 We were having a difficult time walking against the wind.<br/>
🎧 The wind was pushing against us, and we felt the force of it pressing against us.<br/>
🎧 We even had a hard time breathing.<br/>
🎧 We were walking slowly.<br/>
🎧 We watched the leaves as they danced and twirled in the wind.<br/>
🎧 We watched a plastic bag as it flew by us.<br/>
🎧 We saw a little boy whose baseball cap flew right off his head.<br/>
🎧 His cap flew along the sidewalk, and he had to chase it.<br/>
🎧 He finally caught it, and he held it in his hands tightly after he got it back.<br/>

🎧 I was surprised that she caught the centipede.<br/>
🎧 She put her paw on it, and then she reached down and ate the centipede.<br/>
🎧 The centipede must not have tasted very good.<br/>
🎧 My cat got a funny look on her face, and she looked like she was trying to get a bad taste out of her mouth.<br/>
🎧 I was thinking that I would be sick if I ate a centipede.<br/>
🎧 My cat looked at me and jumped back up in my chair.<br/>
🎧 She stuck her face in my teacup and took a big drink of tea.<br/>
🎧 I was shocked.<br/>
🎧 I had never seen a cat drink tea before.<br/>
🎧 I think that the centipede must have tasted so bad that my cat just needed something to wash the taste out of her mouth<br/> 
🎧 Guess what?<br/> 
🎧 I didn't finish my tea.<br/>
🎧 I threw it out and washed out the cup.<br/>
🎧 My cat has never had a drink of tea since that day.<br/>
🎧 She has also never eaten another centipede.<br/>
🎧 If a centipede walks by, she just pretends that she doesn't see it
