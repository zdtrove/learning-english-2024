🎧 many of my <span>friends</span> have <span>dyed</span> <span>their</span> <span>hair</span> <span>different</span> <span>colors</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't <span>mean</span> <span>normal</span> <span>hair</span> <span>colors</span> like <span>brown</span> or <span>black</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>friends</span> have <span>dyed</span> <span>their</span> <span>hair</span> <span>orange</span>, <span>purple</span> and <span>blue</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>told</span> my <span>mother</span> that I would like to dye my <span>hair</span> <span>green</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>explained</span> to my <span>mother</span> that I would <span>only</span> use <span>food</span> <span>coloring</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>green</span> would not <span>last</span> <span>forever</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mother</span> said that <span>dyeing</span> your <span>hair</span> was a <span>silly</span> <span>fad</span>.<br/>
🎧 She said that I would not look <span>good</span> with <span>green</span> <span>hair</span>.<br/>
🎧 I said that if I couldn't dye my <span>hair</span> <span>green</span>, <span>maybe</span> I <span>could</span> get a <span>nose</span> <span>ring</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mother</span> said <span>"no."<br/></span> 
🎧 I said that <span>maybe</span> a <span>tattoo</span> on my arm would be <span>nice</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mother</span> said <span>"no</span> <span>way."<br/></span> 
🎧 My <span>mother</span> said that she did some <span>crazy</span> <span>things</span> when she was a <span>young</span> <span>girl</span>.<br/>
🎧 She said that she used to <span>iron</span> her <span>hair</span> to make it <span>straight</span>.<br/>
🎧 That <span>sounds</span> <span>quite</span> <span>boring</span> to me.<br/>
🎧 My <span>friend</span> <span>Joan</span> <span>came</span> over.<br/>
🎧 Her <span>hair</span> is <span>dyed</span> <span>bright</span> <span>pink</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>father</span> said <span>"nice</span> <span>hair</span>, <span>Joan."<br/></span> 
🎧 I don't think that he <span>really</span> <span>meant</span> it.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mother</span> <span>says</span> that when I am an <span>adult</span> I can dye my <span>hair</span> <span>whatever</span> <span>crazy</span> <span>color</span> I like, but for now she would like me to <span>leave</span> my <span>hair</span> its <span>natural</span> <span>color</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>tried</span> to <span>tell</span> her that all my <span>friends</span> were <span>doing</span> it.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mother</span> <span>asked</span>, <span>"if</span> all your <span>friends</span> were <span>jumping</span> off a <span>cliff</span>, would you do it <span>too?"<br/></span> 
🎧 I said <span>"no."<br/></span> 
🎧 I think <span>I'll</span> have to <span>wait</span> to have <span>green</span> <span>hair</span>, but <span>maybe</span> by the time <span>I'm</span> old <span>enough</span> to dye my <span>hair</span> <span>green</span>, I won't <span>want</span> it that <span>color</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mother</span> <span>says</span> that <span>fads</span> <span>change</span> all the time.<br/>
🎧 One day <span>something</span> <span>might</span> be <span>popular</span>, and the <span>next</span> day it's not in <span>style</span> at all. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>I'll</span> just have to live <span>without</span> <span>green</span> <span>hair</span> for <span>now</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>wonder</span> what the fad will be <span>next</span> <span>month.<br/>

🎧 Some <span>people</span> don't like other <span>people</span> just <span>because</span> they look <span>different</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think that is <span>silly</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't think that it is <span>fair</span> to <span>judge</span> <span>someone</span> by the way they look.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>people</span> look very <span>nice</span>, but they are <span>mean</span> or <span>cruel</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>people</span> look very <span>ordinary</span>, but they are <span>incredibly</span> <span>nice</span>.<br/>

🎧 She had a <span>mean</span> look on her <span>face</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>thought</span> to <span>myself</span> that she was <span>probably</span> not a very <span>nice</span> <span>person</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>stayed</span> <span>away</span> from her, and <span>played</span> with the other <span>children</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Then</span>, we had to play a <span>game</span>, and the <span>teacher</span> said that she would <span>pick</span> <span>partners</span> for us.<br/>

🎧 I didn't think that the <span>game</span> would be much fun at all with a <span>partner</span> who <span>seemed</span> as <span>mean</span> as that <span>girl</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>walked</span> up to her and said <span>hello</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>girl's</span> <span>face</span> <span>changed</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>smiled</span> at me, and she <span>began</span> to talk to me.<br/>
🎧 Her <span>mean</span> <span>face</span> <span>disappeared</span>.<br/>
🎧 We had <span>lots</span> of fun <span>playing</span> the <span>game</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>laughed</span> a lot and <span>enjoyed</span> each <span>other's</span> <span>company</span>.<br/>
🎧 That <span>girl</span> <span>became</span> my <span>best</span> <span>friend</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now when I look at her I see what is <span>inside</span> her.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span> she doesn't <span>smile</span>, but I know what she is like.<br/>
🎧 She is a <span>kind</span> and <span>funny</span> <span>person</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have <span>learned</span> that you can't <span>"judge</span> a book by its <span>cover."<br/></span> 
🎧 It is not <span>fair</span> to <span>dislike</span> <span>someone</span> just <span>because</span> they don't look like you <span>want</span> them to look.<br/>
🎧 You have to get to know a <span>person</span>.<br/>
🎧 It doesn't <span>matter</span> to me what <span>color</span> a <span>person's</span> <span>skin</span> is.<br/>
🎧 It doesn't <span>matter</span> to me if they are <span>short</span> or <span>tall</span>, <span>skinny</span> or fat or <span>happy</span> or sad <span>looking</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>judge</span> <span>people</span> by how they <span>treat</span> me, and I try to <span>treat</span> <span>people</span> like I would <span>want</span> to be <span>treated.<br/>

🎧 I don't know if my <span>brother</span> will <span>ever</span> <span>stop</span> <span>biting</span> his <span>nails</span>, but I know that each <span>January</span> he <span>intends</span> to <span>stop</span>.<br/>

🎧 Have you <span>ever</span> <span>flown?<br/></span> 
🎧 I know that you can't fly like a <span>bird</span>, but you <span>might</span> have <span>taken</span> an <span>airplane</span> <span>ride</span>.<br/>

🎧 One day I was <span>sitting</span> in a <span>chair</span> <span>drinking</span> a cup of <span>tea</span>.<br/>
🎧 My cat <span>came</span> into the <span>room</span> and <span>sat</span> on my <span>lap</span>.<br/>
🎧 She was <span>quite</span> <span>content</span>, and she <span>sat</span> there <span>purring</span>.<br/>
🎧 My cat <span>likes</span> to <span>drink</span> <span>water</span>, and <span>sometimes</span> she <span>drinks</span> <span>milk</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would <span>never</span> give her tea to <span>drink</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Cats</span> just don't <span>drink</span> <span>tea</span>.<br/>
🎧 We were <span>sitting</span> there <span>quietly</span> when <span>suddenly</span> my cat <span>stood</span> up.<br/>
🎧 She was <span>looking</span> at <span>something</span> on the <span>floor</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>crouched</span> <span>down</span> low and got <span>ready</span> to <span>pounce</span>.<br/>
🎧 I saw what she was <span>looking</span> at.<br/>
🎧 It was a <span>huge</span> <span>centipede</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think that <span>centipedes</span> are <span>ugly</span>.<br/>
🎧 They have many <span>legs</span>, and they <span>move</span> very <span>fast</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I would <span>hate</span> to have one <span>crawl</span> over me.<br/>
🎧 My cat <span>jumped</span> to the <span>floor</span> and she ran over to the <span>centipede</span>.<br/>
🎧 She was <span>incredibly</span> <span>fast</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>surprised</span> that she <span>caught</span> the <span>centipede</span>.<br/>
🎧 She put her paw on it, and <span>then</span> she <span>reached</span> <span>down</span> and ate the <span>centipede</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>centipede</span> <span>must</span> not have <span>tasted</span> very <span>good</span>.<br/>
🎧 My cat got a <span>funny</span> look on her <span>face</span>, and she <span>looked</span> like she was <span>trying</span> to get a bad <span>taste</span> out of her <span>mouth</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>thinking</span> that I would be <span>sick</span> if I ate a <span>centipede</span>.<br/>
🎧 My cat <span>looked</span> at me and <span>jumped</span> back up in my <span>chair</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>stuck</span> her <span>face</span> in my <span>teacup</span> and took a big <span>drink</span> of <span>tea</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>shocked</span>.<br/>
🎧 I had <span>never</span> <span>seen</span> a cat <span>drink</span> tea <span>before</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think that the <span>centipede</span> <span>must</span> have <span>tasted</span> so bad that my cat just <span>needed</span> <span>something</span> to <span>wash</span> the <span>taste</span> out of her <span>mouth<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Guess</span> <span>what?<br/></span> 
🎧 I didn't <span>finish</span> my <span>tea</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>threw</span> it out and <span>washed</span> out the <span>cup</span>.<br/>
🎧 My cat has <span>never</span> had a <span>drink</span> of tea <span>since</span> that <span>day</span>.<br/>
