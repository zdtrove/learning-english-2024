🎧 One day I was <span>sitting</span> <span>in</span> a <span>chair</span> <span>drinking</span> a cup <span>of</span> <span>tea</span> .<br/>
🎧 My cat <span>came</span> <span>into</span> the <span>room</span> and <span>sat</span> <span>on</span> my <span>lap</span> .<br/>
🎧 She was <span>quite</span> <span>content</span>, and she <span>sat</span> there <span>purring</span> .<br/>
🎧 My cat <span>likes</span> to <span>drink</span> <span>water</span>, and <span>sometimes</span> she <span>drinks</span> <span>milk</span> .<br/>
🎧 I <span>would</span> <span>never</span> <span>give</span> her tea to <span>drink</span> .<br/>
🎧 <span>Cats</span> <span>just</span> don't <span>drink</span> <span>tea</span> .<br/>
🎧 <span>We</span> <span>were</span> <span>sitting</span> there <span>quietly</span> when <span>suddenly</span> my cat <span>stood</span> <span>up</span> .<br/>
🎧 She was <span>looking</span> <span>at</span> <span>something</span> <span>on</span> the <span>floor</span> .<br/>
🎧 She <span>crouched</span> <span>down</span> low and got <span>ready</span> to <span>pounce</span> .<br/>
🎧 I saw what she was <span>looking</span> <span>at</span> .<br/>
🎧 <span>It</span> was a <span>huge</span> <span>centipede</span> .<br/>
🎧 I <span>think</span> <span>that</span> <span>centipedes</span> are <span>ugly</span> .<br/>
🎧 <span>They</span> have <span>many</span> <span>legs</span>, and <span>they</span> <span>move</span> <span>very</span> <span>fast</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>would</span> <span>hate</span> to have one <span>crawl</span> <span>over</span> <span>me</span> .<br/>
🎧 My cat <span>jumped</span> to the <span>floor</span> and she ran <span>over</span> to the <span>centipede</span> .<br/>
🎧 She was <span>incredibly</span> <span>fast</span> .<br/>
🎧 I was <span>surprised</span> <span>that</span> she <span>caught</span> the <span>centipede</span> .<br/>
🎧 She put her paw <span>on</span> <span>it</span>, and <span>then</span> she <span>reached</span> <span>down</span> and ate the <span>centipede</span> .<br/>
🎧 The <span>centipede</span> <span>must</span> not have <span>tasted</span> <span>very</span> <span>good</span> .<br/>
🎧 My cat got a <span>funny</span> <span>look</span> <span>on</span> her <span>face</span>, and she <span>looked</span> <span>like</span> she was <span>trying</span> to get a bad <span>taste</span> out <span>of</span> her <span>mouth</span> .<br/>
🎧 I was <span>thinking</span> <span>that</span> I <span>would</span> be <span>sick</span> <span>if</span> I ate a <span>centipede</span> .<br/>
🎧 My cat <span>looked</span> <span>at</span> me and <span>jumped</span> <span>back</span> <span>up</span> <span>in</span> my <span>chair</span> .<br/>
🎧 She <span>stuck</span> her <span>face</span> <span>in</span> my <span>teacup</span> and <span>took</span> a big <span>drink</span> <span>of</span> <span>tea</span> .<br/>
🎧 I was <span>shocked</span> .<br/>
🎧 I had <span>never</span> <span>seen</span> a cat <span>drink</span> tea <span>before</span> .<br/>
🎧 I <span>think</span> <span>that</span> the <span>centipede</span> <span>must</span> have <span>tasted</span> so bad <span>that</span> my cat <span>just</span> <span>needed</span> <span>something</span> to <span>wash</span> the <span>taste</span> out <span>of</span> her <span>mouth<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Guess</span> <span>what?<br/></span> 
🎧 I didn't <span>finish</span> my <span>tea</span> .<br/>
🎧 I <span>threw</span> <span>it</span> out and <span>washed</span> out the <span>cup</span> .<br/>
🎧 My cat has <span>never</span> had a <span>drink</span> <span>of</span> tea <span>since</span> <span>that</span> <span>day</span> .<br/>
🎧 She has <span>also</span> <span>never</span> <span>eaten</span> <span>another</span> <span>centipede</span> .<br/>
🎧 <span>If</span> a <span>centipede</span> <span>walks</span> by, she <span>just</span> <span>pretends</span> <span>that</span> she doesn't see <span>it.<br/>
