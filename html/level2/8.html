🎧 It is the <span>first</span> school <span>dance</span> that I have <span>ever</span> <span>been</span> to. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 All of the <span>boys</span> are <span>standing</span> on one <span>side</span> of the <span>gymnasium</span>, and all of the <span>girls</span> are on the other <span>side</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There is <span>loud</span> <span>music</span> <span>playing</span>, and I can <span>hardly</span> <span>hear</span> my <span>friends</span> <span>talking</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>music</span> is <span>going</span> <span>fast</span>, and some <span>people</span> are <span>starting</span> to <span>move</span> to the <span>beat</span> of the <span>song</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Soon</span> all the <span>girls</span> are <span>dancing</span>, but the <span>boys</span> are still <span>standing</span> <span>against</span> the <span>wall</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Then</span> the <span>song</span> <span>ends</span>, and <span>slow</span> <span>music</span> <span>comes</span> on. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I don't know what to do, so I just go and <span>stand</span> <span>against</span> the <span>wall</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Then</span> one of the <span>boys</span> in my <span>class</span> <span>comes</span> over and <span>asks</span> me if I would like to <span>dance</span> to the <span>slow</span> <span>song</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>really</span> feel <span>awkward</span> and <span>nervous</span>, but say <span>yes</span>.<br/>
🎧 We go out into the <span>middle</span> of the gym, and he <span>puts</span> his <span>hands</span> on my <span>waist</span>, and I put my <span>hands</span> on his <span>shoulders</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We <span>start</span> to <span>move</span> to the <span>music</span>, and we <span>step</span> on each <span>other's</span> <span>feet!<br/></span> 
🎧 He is <span>bigger</span> than me, so my toe <span>starts</span> to <span>hurt</span> a little bit! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>As</span> we <span>continue</span> to <span>"slow</span> <span>dance,"</span> more <span>boys</span> and <span>girls</span> <span>come</span> to the <span>middle</span> of the gym to <span>dance</span> <span>together</span>.<br/>
🎧 It sure is <span>funny</span> to <span>watch</span> <span>people</span> <span>dance</span> <span>because</span> they are <span>stepping</span> on each <span>other's</span> <span>toes</span> and <span>bumping</span> into each other and <span>turning</span> in <span>opposite</span> <span>directions</span>! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Soon</span> the <span>song</span> <span>ends</span>, and the <span>boys</span> go to one <span>side</span> of the gym <span>again</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>girls</span> <span>decide</span> that they <span>want</span> to <span>dance</span> to a <span>fast</span> <span>song</span>, so they <span>stay</span> in the <span>middle</span> of the gym and <span>dance</span> with one <span>another</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teachers</span> are <span>making</span> sure that we are <span>behaving</span> <span>because</span> they are <span>watching</span> us. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>wonder</span> if they <span>want</span> to <span>dance</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They <span>probably</span> are <span>remembering</span> <span>their</span> <span>first</span> school <span>dance</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>wonder</span> if <span>someday</span> <span>I'll</span> be <span>grown</span> up just like the <span>teachers</span> and <span>laughing</span> at the <span>memories</span> of my <span>first</span> school <span>dance</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I sure <span>hope</span> <span>so!<br/>

🎧 Our <span>health</span> is very <span>important</span> to us. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>People</span> can have <span>good</span> <span>jobs</span>, <span>money</span> or <span>good</span> looks.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, if they <span>become</span> <span>sick</span>, <span>those</span> <span>things</span> don't <span>mean</span> a <span>thing</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It is <span>wonderful</span> to feel <span>good</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Feeling</span> <span>good</span> isn't just about our <span>body</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It is <span>also</span> about our <span>mind</span> and <span>spirit</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We need to feel <span>good</span> in <span>every</span> <span>area</span> of our life.<br/>
🎧 One of the <span>things</span> we can do to be <span>healthy</span> is to get <span>enough</span> <span>sleep</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>If</span> we don't <span>sleep</span> <span>well</span>, or <span>enough</span>, it <span>hurts</span> our <span>body</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It is <span>during</span> <span>sleep</span> that our <span>body</span> <span>restores</span> <span>itself</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Everybody</span> <span>knows</span> we should <span>also</span> eat <span>good</span> <span>foods</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We need <span>milk</span> <span>products</span>, <span>meats</span>, <span>fruits</span> and <span>vegetables</span> and <span>breads</span> and <span>cereals</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We shouldn't eat too much fat or <span>sugar</span> <span>things</span> <span>either</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Of</span> <span>course</span>, we just shouldn't eat too much at all! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Another</span> <span>thing</span> that is very <span>important</span> is <span>water</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Most</span> <span>people</span> know our <span>bodies</span> are <span>mainly</span> <span>water</span>, and we need to <span>keep</span> that <span>replaced</span> with <span>good</span> <span>water--often!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Exercise</span> is very <span>good</span> for <span>both</span> our <span>body</span> and <span>mind</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It is <span>good</span> for our <span>heart</span>, <span>lungs</span>, <span>muscles</span> and <span>bones</span>. It <span>gets</span> <span>oxygen</span> to our <span>brain</span> to <span>help</span> us think better. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It can <span>help</span> us be <span>smarter!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Doing</span> <span>things</span> that we <span>believe</span> are <span>right</span> and <span>good</span> <span>gives</span> us <span>peace</span> <span>inside</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It <span>makes</span> us be <span>nicer</span> <span>people</span> and is <span>good</span> for our <span>spirit</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 When we do what we know is <span>right</span>, it <span>helps</span> to <span>reduce</span> <span>stress</span>, which isn't <span>good</span> for any <span>part</span> of us.<br/>
🎧 When we take <span>care</span> of our <span>body</span>, <span>mind</span>, and <span>spirit</span>, we feel <span>good</span> all over and <span>inside</span>, <span>too!<br/></span> 
🎧 What a <span>beautiful</span> <span>world</span> this would be if we <span>could</span> all work at <span>doing</span> <span>these</span> <span>things</span> for <span>ourselves</span> and <span>also</span> <span>trying</span> to be a <span>help</span> to <span>others!<br/>

🎧 There <span>standing</span> on my <span>front</span> <span>porch</span>, is a little <span>ghost</span> and a <span>cute</span> little <span>witch</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>Every</span> <span>October</span> <span>31</span> is <span>Halloween</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 That is when <span>children</span> <span>dress</span> up as <span>different</span> <span>things</span> <span>(not</span> just <span>funny</span> <span>people</span>, but <span>things</span> like <span>animals</span> or <span>fruits</span> or <span>vegetables</span>, <span>etc)</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They go from <span>door</span> to <span>door</span> and get <span>different</span> <span>candies</span> or little <span>toys</span> from the <span>people</span> in the <span>houses</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Some <span>children</span>, who are not very <span>nice</span>, will do <span>naughty</span> <span>things</span> to <span>houses</span> where <span>people</span> are not <span>home</span>, like <span>throwing</span> <span>eggs</span> at <span>their</span> <span>windows</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I think that is <span>bad</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span> <span>people</span> <span>decorate</span> <span>their</span> <span>houses</span> for this day. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Some of the <span>houses</span> can be <span>pretty</span> <span>scary</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They'll have <span>scary</span> <span>noises</span> <span>coming</span> from a <span>tape</span> <span>recorder</span>, too. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>However</span>, it's <span>only</span> for a few <span>days</span> out of the <span>year</span>, so we may as <span>well</span> have fun with it.<br/>
🎧 This <span>year</span> my <span>brother</span> is <span>dressing</span> up as a <span>skeleton</span>, and <span>I'm</span> <span>dressing</span> up as a <span>bride</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I am <span>wearing</span> my <span>mom's</span> <span>wedding</span> <span>dress</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It is fun <span>dressing</span> up in <span>costumes</span> and <span>putting</span> on <span>lots</span> of <span>makeup</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span> our <span>friends</span> don't even know who we <span>really</span> <span>are!<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>best</span> <span>part</span> of <span>Halloween</span> is the <span>candy</span>, of <span>course</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>once</span> got an <span>entire</span> <span>garbage</span> bag <span>full</span> of <span>candy</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Mom and Dad took it <span>away</span> <span>because</span> I was <span>eating</span> too much. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Mom gave me a <span>piece</span> of <span>candy</span> <span>every</span> day, <span>though</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>If</span> you eat too much <span>candy</span>, you can get a <span>stomach</span> <span>ache</span>.<br/>
🎧 You need to <span>remember</span> to <span>brush</span> your <span>teeth</span> <span>often</span>, too, so you don't get <span>cavities</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Still</span>, that <span>candy</span> sure <span>does</span> <span>taste</span> <span>good!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Well</span>, it's time to go <span>"trick</span> or <span>treating."</span> <span><br/></span> 
🎧 So off I go, <span>door</span> to <span>door</span>, <span>getting</span> <span>yummy</span> <span>candy</span> and <span>hearing</span> <span>people</span> say, <span>"Oh</span>, aren't you <span>pretty!"<br/>

🎧 What is New <span>Year's</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Well</span>, to me a New <span>Year</span> is when the <span>date</span> of the <span>year</span> <span>changes</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 This <span>year</span> it is <span>2001</span>, and on <span>December</span> <span>31</span> at <span>midnight</span> it will <span>change</span> to <span>2002</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>wonder</span> who <span>invented</span> the <span>changing</span> of <span>years</span> and how it was made the way it is. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It <span>must</span> have <span>been</span> <span>someone</span> a long time ago, <span>since</span> it's <span>already</span> <span>2001</span>.<br/>
🎧 When New <span>Year's</span> <span>comes</span> <span>closer</span>, a lot of <span>people</span> talk about New <span>Year's</span> <span>resolutions</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I don't <span>bother</span> <span>making</span> <span>"resolutions"</span> <span>because</span> I <span>never</span> do them <span>anyway</span>! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 And the <span>ones</span> that I do make are usually <span>ones</span> that will <span>happen</span> <span>anyway</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>guess</span> it's just <span>common</span> <span>sense</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>biggest</span> <span>reason</span> why I like New <span>Year's</span> is <span>because</span> of the <span>fireworks</span> that we have here <span>in<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Canada</span> and many other <span>countries</span>, too. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 You should see some of the <span>fireworks</span> that go off.<br/>
🎧 There are many <span>different</span> <span>colours</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There's <span>pink</span>, <span>blue</span>, <span>purple</span>, <span>yellow</span>, <span>green</span>, red, <span>even<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>white</span>, <span>silver</span> and <span>gold</span>. <span>Fireworks</span> make <span>loud</span> <span>bangs</span>, <span>squeals</span>, <span>siren</span> <span>sounds</span>, and <span>sometimes</span> all at <span>once</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There are <span>lots</span> of <span>different</span> <span>sounds</span>, but I can't even <span>explain</span> what they are all like.<br/>
🎧 <span>Fireworks</span> are <span>best</span> when it's very <span>dark</span> <span>outside</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They <span>light</span> up the <span>whole</span> sky! <span>Sometimes</span>, they look as <span>though</span> they are <span>going</span> to <span>fall</span> on you.<br/>
🎧 I like New <span>Year's</span> <span>because</span> it's fun in other <span>ways</span>, but the <span>fireworks</span> are the <span>best</span> <span>part</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 You can buy <span>fireworks</span> to use for your own <span>fireworks</span> <span>show</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>However</span>, you have to be <span>careful</span> that <span>no</span> one <span>gets</span> <span>burned</span> or <span>hurt</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Usually</span>, there are <span>parties</span> at New <span>Year's</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Some <span>people</span> <span>really</span> <span>dress</span> up <span>fancy</span> and even <span>wear</span> <span>masks</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They don't know who one <span>another</span> is <span>until</span> <span>midnight</span> when they take <span>their</span> <span>masks</span> off. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>As</span> <span>midnight</span> <span>comes</span> very <span>close</span>, <span>everybody</span> <span>begins</span> to <span>count</span> <span>down</span>, and <span>then</span> <span>everyone</span> <span>yells</span> out <span>"Happy</span> New <span>Year's"</span> and <span>bang</span> <span>pots</span> and <span>pans</span> or <span>ring</span> <span>bells</span> or <span>honk</span> <span>horns</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Join</span> me in the <span>count</span> <span>down</span> on New <span>Year's</span> <span>Eve</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>"Ten</span>, <span>nine</span>, <span>eight</span>, <span>seven</span>, six, <span>five</span>, <span>four</span>, <span>three</span>, two, one <span>-</span> <span>HAPPY</span> NEW <span>YEAR!"<br/>

🎧 I like <span>music</span>. I have always <span>liked</span> <span>music</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Even when I was very <span>young</span>, I <span>liked</span> <span>music</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I like to <span>listen</span> to it, and to make it. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 When I was a little <span>girl</span>, <span>listening</span> to <span>nice</span> <span>music</span> would <span>sometimes</span> make me cry! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 That may <span>seem</span> <span>silly</span>, but the <span>music</span> was so <span>pretty</span> that I <span>cried!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>As</span> I <span>grew</span> <span>older</span>, I <span>started</span> to take <span>piano</span> <span>lessons</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I was not very <span>good</span> at <span>first</span>, but <span>after</span> a <span>while</span> I got better. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Also</span>, as I <span>grew</span> <span>older</span>, I <span>started</span> to take <span>violin</span> <span>lessons</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I did not <span>sound</span> very <span>good</span> at all at <span>first</span>, but I <span>improved</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I was a <span>teenager</span> in high school, I made sure I had <span>music</span> <span>classes</span> <span>every</span> <span>year</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Those</span> were the <span>classes</span> I <span>enjoyed</span> <span>most</span> of all. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Everyone</span> <span>loved</span> <span>music</span>, and we had a lot of fun. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>started</span> to take <span>private</span> <span>singing</span> <span>lessons</span> <span>while</span> I was in high school, too. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>also</span> <span>sang</span> in the <span>choir</span>, <span>played</span> in a <span>band</span> and <span>acted</span> in <span>plays</span> in high school. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>plays</span> were all <span>musicals</span>, so I got to <span>sing</span> and <span>dance</span> and enjoy <span>music</span> that way <span>also</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It was so much fun <span>pretending</span> to be other <span>people!<br/></span> 
🎧 When I <span>finished</span> high school, I <span>went</span> to <span>university</span> to learn how to be a <span>music</span> <span>teacher</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 That was a lot of fun <span>because</span> <span>every</span> day I was with other <span>people</span> who <span>loved</span> <span>music</span> as much as I do. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Mostly</span> I <span>played</span> the <span>piano</span>, but I <span>also</span> <span>learned</span> how to play the <span>drums</span>, a <span>saxophone</span>, a <span>trombone</span>, a <span>French</span> <span>horn</span>, a <span>clarinet</span>, a <span>flute</span>, which I <span>REALLY</span> was not very <span>good</span> at, and a <span>viola</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I took more <span>singing</span> <span>lessons</span>, too. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We did not have <span>plays</span> to <span>sing</span> and act in, but I <span>sang</span> in the <span>university</span> <span>choir</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Some <span>years</span>, I <span>played</span> the <span>piano</span> for other <span>students</span> who were <span>learning</span> other <span>instruments</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 One <span>year</span>, I <span>played</span> <span>duets</span> with <span>another</span> <span>girl</span> who was <span>also</span> there to play <span>piano</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She and I made sure we <span>played</span> <span>fast</span>, <span>funny</span> <span>songs</span>, so we <span>really</span> <span>enjoyed</span> <span>ourselves</span> <span>doing</span> it.<br/>
🎧 Now, I am a <span>music</span> <span>teacher</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I do not have a lot of <span>students</span>, not as many as I used to have <span>anyway</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I still find it very <span>rewarding</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I like to see <span>people</span> who <span>start</span> off not <span>knowing</span> very much, if <span>anything</span>, and go on to be very <span>good</span> at <span>creating</span> <span>music</span>.<br/>
🎧 I still love <span>listening</span> to <span>music</span> <span>also</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Music</span> <span>makes</span> me <span>happy</span> when I am sad. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It <span>makes</span> me <span>want</span> to <span>dance</span> or <span>sing</span> when I am <span>already</span> <span>happy</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Mostly</span>, <span>music</span> just <span>makes</span> me <span>glad</span> that I am me and that <span>music</span> is <span>alive</span> in <span>me.<br/>

🎧 The one I am <span>holding</span> now is my <span>last</span> one. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 My other <span>babies</span> are <span>grown</span> up more and now at school. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I love <span>their</span> <span>childish</span> play and <span>laughter</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>miss</span> <span>their</span> <span>baby</span> <span>dimples</span> and <span>their</span> <span>baby</span> <span>sounds</span> and <span>smells</span>.<br/>
🎧 There is such joy in the <span>birth</span> of a new <span>baby</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We <span>hear</span> <span>their</span> <span>first</span> little cry, <span>telling</span> us all is <span>well</span> with <span>their</span> <span>small</span> <span>world</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We feel <span>their</span> <span>newborn</span> <span>skin</span>, <span>wrinkled</span>, <span>soft</span> and <span>slightly</span> <span>damp</span>.<br/>
🎧 We feel each little <span>limb</span> and are <span>filled</span> with <span>wonder</span> and <span>humility</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Life</span> is <span>good</span> as <span>baby</span> <span>takes</span> its <span>first</span> <span>food</span> from its <span>mother</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Family</span> <span>gathers</span> <span>around</span>, each <span>waiting</span> to <span>hold</span> and love this <span>newest</span> <span>member</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Each</span> time the <span>baby</span> <span>cries</span>, its mom <span>worries</span>, and <span>their</span> <span>bond</span> <span>becomes</span> <span>stronger</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Babies</span> have <span>their</span> own <span>special</span> <span>smell</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Some have <span>described</span> it as <span>"milk</span> and <span>innocence."</span> <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It is the <span>sweetest</span> <span>smell</span> on <span>earth</span>, I think. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It <span>cannot</span> be <span>copied</span>. <span>Somehow</span>, it <span>disappears</span> as <span>baby</span> <span>grows</span>.<br/>
🎧 I love to <span>hear</span> my <span>baby</span> talk. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Once</span> in a <span>while</span> I can even <span>understand</span> a little bit! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She is so <span>serious</span> in her <span>baby</span> talk that I just have to <span>pick</span> her up and hug her. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I love to <span>hear</span> her say <span>"Mommy."<br/></span> 
🎧 When my <span>baby</span> is <span>tickled</span>, or when the dog or her big <span>brothers</span> do <span>something</span> <span>funny</span>, it is so <span>sweet</span> to <span>hear</span> her <span>baby</span> <span>laugh</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It's such a <span>cute</span> little <span>giggle</span>! <span>Sometimes</span> she <span>laughs</span> <span>so<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>hard</span>, her <span>face</span> <span>turns</span> red, <span>tears</span> <span>come</span> to her <span>eyes</span>, and she <span>falls</span> <span>down</span> <span>weak</span> with the <span>laughter</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Those</span> who <span>watch</span> her can't <span>help</span> but <span>laugh</span>, too. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>hope</span> she always <span>laughs</span> so <span>easily</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>parents</span> <span>watch</span> with <span>pride</span> and joy as <span>baby</span> <span>grows</span> and has many <span>"firsts."</span> <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There is the <span>first</span> time <span>baby</span> <span>sleeps</span> <span>through</span> the <span>night</span>, <span>rolls</span> over, <span>smiles</span>, <span>laughs</span>, <span>hugs</span> and <span>kisses</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Then</span> there is the <span>first</span> <span>tooth</span>, <span>crawling</span>, <span>first</span> <span>step</span> and <span>first</span> <span>word</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 With each new <span>first</span>, the <span>baby</span> <span>becomes</span> <span>less</span> a <span>baby!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>These</span> <span>steps</span> are a little sad to <span>parents</span>, too, <span>because</span> they know they're <span>"losing</span> <span>their</span> <span>baby."</span> <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>However</span>, to a <span>mother</span>, even an <span>adult</span> <span>child</span> is still her <span>baby</span>! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 My <span>baby</span> is not <span>perfect</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span> she <span>gets</span> mad or <span>whines</span> for <span>no</span> <span>reason</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 But, to me, she is still <span>beautiful</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Her <span>smiles</span> more than make up for her <span>tears</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Her <span>hugs</span> <span>wipe</span> <span>away</span> when she's <span>been</span> bad. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>intend</span> to <span>cherish</span> each <span>moment</span> with my <span>baby</span> <span>while</span> I <span>can!<br/>

🎧 I am <span>almost</span> <span>nine</span> <span>years</span> old and my bed time is <span>8:30</span> <span>p.m</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I think that is so <span>unfair</span>! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I think I am old <span>enough</span> to <span>stay</span> up <span>until</span> at <span>least</span> <span>9:00</span> <span>p.m</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 My <span>parents</span> say that I have to go to bed <span>early</span> <span>because</span> I have school the <span>next</span> day. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I can't <span>wait</span> <span>until</span> I am <span>grown</span> up and can <span>stay</span> <span>awake</span> as long as I <span>want</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Even <span>though</span> I think I should be <span>able</span> to go to bed <span>later</span>, I do like our <span>night</span> time <span>routine</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>At</span> about <span>8:l5</span> <span>p.m.</span>, my Mom <span>sends</span> us up to put on our <span>pajamas</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 When we <span>come</span> back <span>downstairs</span>, we <span>read</span> <span>together</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>If</span> Dad is not <span>working</span>, he will <span>sometimes</span> <span>read</span>, too. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Mostly</span> it is Mom we <span>read</span> with <span>though</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 When we <span>read</span>, Mom <span>helps</span> us with <span>words</span> we <span>cannot</span> <span>read</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We have to try and <span>sound</span> the <span>word</span> out, but if we are <span>really</span> <span>stuck</span>, she will <span>help</span> us. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>If</span> we <span>come</span> to a <span>place<br/></span> 
🎧 in our <span>reading</span> where we do not <span>understand</span> the <span>meaning</span> of what was <span>written</span>, we <span>stop</span> <span>reading</span> and look at Mom. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She will <span>tell</span> us what it <span>means</span> or <span>help</span> us <span>figure</span> it out on our own.<br/>
🎧 <span>After</span> we are <span>finished</span> <span>reading</span>, we say <span>goodnight</span> to <span>everyone</span> in our <span>house</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>Afterwards</span>, we go <span>upstairs</span> and <span>brush</span> our <span>teeth</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have to do <span>special</span> <span>stretching</span> <span>exercises</span> for the <span>muscles</span> in my <span>chest</span> and <span>legs</span>, or I get <span>pains</span> when I run and play. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I do my <span>stretching</span> <span>before</span> I get into bed. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>After</span> my <span>exercises</span>, <span>either</span> my <span>brother</span> or I <span>turn</span> off the <span>lights</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 We <span>tell</span> each other about our day, about what we <span>hope</span> will <span>happen</span> in the <span>future</span>, about our <span>friends</span> and all <span>sorts</span> of other <span>important</span> <span>things</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>Sometimes</span> there is a <span>problem</span> in life that has <span>no</span> <span>answer</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>Perhaps</span> <span>someone</span> <span>becomes</span> ill. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Perhaps</span> there was love, but now there is <span>conflict</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>These</span> <span>problems</span> are <span>hard</span> to <span>solve</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There is <span>no</span> <span>single</span> <span>answer</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 many <span>people</span> have <span>opinions</span> on what is the <span>best</span> <span>answer</span>.<br/>
🎧 But in <span>mathematics</span> there is an <span>answer:</span> a <span>single</span> <span>answer</span> that is <span>right</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There is <span>no</span> <span>doubt;</span> there is <span>no</span> <span>argument;</span> this <span>answer</span> is <span>right</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>If</span> we ask, <span>"What</span> is <span>five</span> <span>plus</span> <span>seven?"</span> <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>answer</span> is <span>twelve</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>If</span> we ask, <span>"How</span> do you <span>raise</span> a <span>child?"</span> <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>answer</span> would <span>depend</span> on the <span>child</span> and the <span>parents</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span> there is more than one way to <span>reach</span> an <span>answer</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Imagine</span> we <span>want</span> to find the <span>area</span> of a <span>triangle</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>triangle</span> has a <span>right</span> <span>angle;</span> the two <span>sides</span> <span>surrounding</span> the <span>right</span> <span>angle</span> are <span>20mm</span> and <span>30mm</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>formula</span> for the <span>area</span> of a <span>triangle</span> is one <span>half</span> of <span>(base)(height)</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We <span>could</span> <span>consider</span> the <span>20mm</span> <span>side</span> as the <span>base</span> and <span>30</span> <span>mm</span> as the <span>height</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>could</span> <span>consider</span> the <span>30mm</span> <span>side</span> as the <span>base</span> and the <span>20mm</span> <span>side</span> as the <span>height</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Both</span> <span>ways</span> would <span>produce</span> the <span>same</span> <span>answer</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>area</span> is <span>300</span> <span>square</span> <span>mm</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Alternatively</span>, we <span>could</span> <span>consider</span> the <span>base</span> as the <span>third</span> <span>side</span> of the <span>triangle</span> and <span>then</span> we would have to <span>draw</span> a <span>height</span> and <span>measure</span> it. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>height</span> would be <span>neither</span> <span>20</span> <span>nor</span> <span>30</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 But still we would end with the <span>same</span> <span>answer</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>In</span> <span>math</span>, the <span>answer</span> <span>does</span> not <span>change</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Another</span> <span>reason</span> I like <span>math</span> is the way it <span>brings</span> <span>order</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There can be a <span>whole</span> set of <span>numbers</span> or a <span>whole</span> set of <span>measurements</span> that <span>mean</span> <span>nothing</span> <span>until</span> <span>mathematics</span> <span>organizes</span> them into a <span>pattern</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 An <span>average</span> <span>number</span> can be <span>found;</span> <span>graphs</span> can be <span>drawn;</span> the <span>spread</span> of the <span>numbers</span> and <span>probabilities</span> of a <span>certain</span> <span>number</span> <span>happening</span> can be <span>calculated</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 This is like <span>having</span> a <span>whole</span> lot of <span>dirty</span> <span>dishes</span> <span>after</span> <span>supper</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Applying</span> <span>math</span> is like <span>washing</span> and <span>sorting</span> the <span>dishes</span> and <span>putting</span> them back into the <span>cupboard</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Math</span> is a <span>powerful</span> <span>tool</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Math</span> should be our <span>friend</span>, and we will find more <span>ways</span> to use it to better our <span>lives.<br/>

🎧 <span>Because</span> it was <span>April</span> there was still ice <span>beside</span> the <span>water</span>, <span>huge</span> <span>chunks</span> of ice that <span>looked</span> like <span>white</span> <span>rocks</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>In</span> the <span>river</span> there were <span>floating</span> <span>pieces</span> of ice <span>moving</span> <span>downstream</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>next</span> day we <span>went</span> to the <span>town</span> where the <span>Niagara</span> <span>River</span> <span>joins</span> <span>Lake</span> <span>Ontario</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>weather</span> was <span>warm</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We <span>walked</span> a long way and our <span>feet</span> were hot, so we <span>went</span> <span>down</span> to the <span>edge</span> of the <span>water</span> to put our <span>feet</span> in. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 One toe in was <span>enough</span>! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>water</span> was so <span>cold</span> it made our <span>feet</span> <span>ache</span>! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 A <span>piece</span> of ice <span>drifted</span> <span>beside</span> our <span>feet</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I put one <span>foot</span> in for a <span>second</span> <span>then</span> out, as the <span>pain</span> of the <span>cold</span> <span>went</span> <span>right</span> <span>through</span> me! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 My <span>sister</span> <span>could</span> not <span>understand</span> how it <span>could</span> be so <span>warm</span>, but there was still <span>ice</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Another</span> day we <span>went</span> to see my <span>daughter;</span> she is <span>living</span> on a <span>farm</span> an <span>hour's</span> <span>drive</span> <span>away</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>walked</span> <span>through</span> her <span>trees;</span> the <span>buds</span> were <span>starting</span> to <span>turn</span> into <span>leaves</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We <span>stopped</span> and <span>looked</span> at the <span>spring</span> <span>wildflowers</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We <span>climbed</span> <span>across</span> a <span>creek</span> by <span>walking</span> over a <span>fallen</span> <span>tree</span>.<br/>
🎧 We saw the <span>footprints</span> of <span>raccoons</span> by the <span>water</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There was <span>fresh</span> air and <span>sunshine</span> and <span>blue</span> <span>sky</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>On</span> the way <span>home</span> we <span>stopped</span> for <span>hamburgers</span> and <span>fries</span> at a <span>drive-through</span> <span>restaurant</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She had <span>never</span> <span>been</span> to a <span>drive-through</span> <span>restaurant</span> <span>before</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Then</span> we <span>went</span> to a <span>donut</span> <span>shop</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>no</span> <span>donut</span> <span>shops</span> where she <span>lives</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There was a <span>choice</span> of <span>20</span> <span>different</span> <span>types</span> of <span>donut:</span> some <span>round</span>, some with <span>holes</span>, some with <span>frosting</span>, some with jam <span>inside--each</span> was <span>different</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>days</span> <span>passed</span> <span>quickly</span>, and <span>soon</span> it was time to take her back to the <span>airport</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Some of the <span>trees</span> now had <span>leaves;</span> some of the <span>tulips</span> were now <span>blooming</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It was <span>hard</span> to say <span>goodbye</span> to my <span>sister</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>hope</span> we can <span>visit</span> <span>again</span> <span>soon.<br/>

🎧 <span>Today</span> the sun was <span>warm;</span> the sky was <span>blue</span> with a few <span>white</span> <span>clouds</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It was a <span>good</span> day to <span>pick</span> <span>strawberries;</span> it was a <span>good</span> day to go to the <span>beach</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>drove</span> to a <span>pick-your-own</span> <span>farm</span> where <span>people</span> can <span>pick</span> <span>their</span> own <span>fruit</span> and buy it. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There the <span>fruit</span> is very <span>fresh</span> and <span>delicious</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>owner</span> of the <span>farm</span> gave <span>everyone</span> a row to <span>pick</span> <span>their</span> <span>strawberries</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Everyone</span> was <span>wearing</span> sun <span>hats</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>knelt</span> <span>down</span> on the <span>straw</span> <span>between</span> the <span>rows</span> and <span>picked</span> the big <span>juicy</span> red <span>berries</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>tasted</span> <span>one;</span> it was <span>warm</span> from the <span>sun</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I bit into it the <span>juice</span> was <span>sweet</span> and <span>strong</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 When <span>three</span> big <span>pails</span> were <span>full</span>, I <span>went</span> to pay for them and <span>picked</span> up some <span>recipes</span> for some <span>strawberry</span> <span>desserts</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>packed</span> two of the <span>pails</span> in a <span>cooler</span> with some ice, and the other one we would eat at the <span>beach</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>met</span> my <span>daughter</span> at the <span>beach</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She had a <span>soft</span> <span>pink</span> <span>blanket</span> on the <span>sand</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 This <span>beach</span> is <span>beside</span> a <span>lake</span>, and <span>across</span> the <span>lake</span> about <span>50</span> <span>km</span> <span>away</span> the <span>large</span> <span>city</span> can <span>sometimes</span> be <span>seen</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Today</span> the <span>wind</span> <span>blew</span> <span>cooler</span> air <span>across</span> the <span>lake</span> over the <span>people</span> on the <span>beach</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There were <span>children</span> <span>playing</span> in the <span>water</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 One man <span>helped</span> his son dig <span>holes</span> in the <span>sand</span>, and the <span>water</span> ran into the <span>holes</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 One <span>lady</span> <span>held</span> her <span>children's</span> <span>hands</span> and <span>walked</span> <span>down</span> into the <span>water</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Families</span> <span>climbed</span> over the <span>rocks</span> and <span>sat</span> on the <span>last</span> <span>rock</span> where the <span>water</span> was <span>deep</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Teenagers</span> <span>rode</span> <span>bicycles</span> and <span>roller</span> <span>blades</span> <span>along</span> the <span>path</span> <span>beside</span> the <span>beach</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Adults</span> <span>walked</span> and ran <span>along</span> this <span>path</span>, <span>carrying</span> <span>water</span> <span>bottles</span> <span>around</span> <span>their</span> <span>waists<br/></span> 
🎧 We <span>sat</span> on the <span>blanket</span> and ate <span>sandwiches</span> of <span>meat</span> and <span>lettuce</span> and <span>strawberries</span> from the <span>pail</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We <span>talked</span> and <span>read</span> <span>books</span> and lay in the sun, <span>relaxing</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We <span>wore</span> <span>sunscreen</span>, but our <span>skin</span> was <span>getting</span> hot. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 How <span>cold</span> was the <span>water</span>? We <span>walked</span> <span>across</span> the <span>sand</span> that <span>almost</span> <span>burned</span> our <span>feet</span>, to the <span>edge</span> of the <span>water</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She <span>went</span> <span>right</span> in and lay <span>down</span> <span>floating</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I put my <span>toes</span> in and <span>felt</span> the <span>chill</span> <span>through</span> my <span>body</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>went</span> up to my <span>knees</span>, <span>then</span> my <span>thighs</span>, but that was far <span>enough</span>! My <span>whole</span> <span>body</span> was <span>cooled</span> <span>down;</span> I <span>headed</span> back to the <span>blanket</span> to lay in the sun <span>again</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Soon</span> it was time to go <span>home</span>, she was <span>coming</span> to my <span>house</span> for <span>supper</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We <span>drove</span> <span>down</span> the <span>highway</span> with the <span>windows</span> <span>open</span> and our <span>hair</span> <span>blowing</span> in the <span>warm</span> <span>breeze</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We cut the <span>strawberries</span> up and made a <span>strawberry</span> <span>dessert</span> with <span>cake</span> and ice <span>cream</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We <span>sat</span> <span>outside</span> in the <span>backyard</span> <span>under</span> the <span>maple</span> <span>trees</span> with the <span>birds</span> <span>singing</span> <span>around</span> us and ate our <span>supper</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It was a <span>perfect</span> <span>ending</span> to a <span>relaxing</span> <span>summer</span> <span>day.<br/>
