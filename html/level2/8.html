🎧 It is the first school dance that I have ever been to. <br/> 
🎧 All of the boys are standing on one side of the gymnasium, and all of the girls are on the other side. <br/> 
🎧 There is loud music playing, and I can hardly hear my friends talking.<br/>
🎧 The music is going fast, and some people are starting to move to the beat of the song.<br/>
🎧 Soon all the girls are dancing, but the boys are still standing against the wall. <br/> 
🎧 Then the song ends, and slow music comes on. <br/> 
🎧 I don't know what to do, so I just go and stand against the wall. <br/> 
🎧 Then one of the boys in my class comes over and asks me if I would like to dance to the slow song. <br/> 
🎧 I really feel awkward and nervous, but say yes.<br/>
🎧 We go out into the middle of the gym, and he puts his hands on my waist, and I put my hands on his shoulders. <br/> 
🎧 We start to move to the music, and we step on each other's feet!<br/> 
🎧 He is bigger than me, so my toe starts to hurt a little bit! <br/> 
🎧 As we continue to "slow dance," more boys and girls come to the middle of the gym to dance together.<br/>
🎧 It sure is funny to watch people dance because they are stepping on each other's toes and bumping into each other and turning in opposite directions! <br/> 
🎧 Soon the song ends, and the boys go to one side of the gym again. <br/> 
🎧 The girls decide that they want to dance to a fast song, so they stay in the middle of the gym and dance with one another.<br/>
🎧 Our teachers are making sure that we are behaving because they are watching us. <br/> 
🎧 I wonder if they want to dance. <br/> 
🎧 They probably are remembering their first school dance. <br/> 
🎧 I wonder if someday I'll be grown up just like the teachers and laughing at the memories of my first school dance? <br/> 
🎧 I sure hope so

🎧 Our health is very important to us. <br/> 
🎧 People can have good jobs, money or good looks.<br/>
🎧 However, if they become sick, those things don't mean a thing. <br/> 
🎧 It is wonderful to feel good.<br/>
🎧 Feeling good isn't just about our body. <br/> 
🎧 It is also about our mind and spirit. <br/> 
🎧 We need to feel good in every area of our life.<br/>
🎧 One of the things we can do to be healthy is to get enough sleep. <br/> 
🎧 If we don't sleep well, or enough, it hurts our body. <br/> 
🎧 It is during sleep that our body restores itself.<br/>
🎧 Everybody knows we should also eat good foods. <br/> 
🎧 We need milk products, meats, fruits and vegetables and breads and cereals. <br/> 
🎧 We shouldn't eat too much fat or sugar things either. <br/> 
🎧 Of course, we just shouldn't eat too much at all! <br/> 
🎧 Another thing that is very important is water. <br/> 
🎧 Most people know our bodies are mainly water, and we need to keep that replaced with good water--often!<br/> 
🎧 Exercise is very good for both our body and mind. <br/> 
🎧 It is good for our heart, lungs, muscles and bones. It gets oxygen to our brain to help us think better. <br/> 
🎧 It can help us be smarter!<br/> 
🎧 Doing things that we believe are right and good gives us peace inside. <br/> 
🎧 It makes us be nicer people and is good for our spirit. <br/> 
🎧 When we do what we know is right, it helps to reduce stress, which isn't good for any part of us.<br/>
🎧 When we take care of our body, mind, and spirit, we feel good all over and inside, too!<br/> 
🎧 What a beautiful world this would be if we could all work at doing these things for ourselves and also trying to be a help to others

🎧 Ghosts, goblins, witches, princes and princesses, kings, queens, skeletons! <br/> 
🎧 So may of these "things" are walking down my street. <br/> 
🎧 "Oh, no! They are coming to my door!" <br/> 
🎧 The doorbell chimes, and I slowly open the door. <br/> 
🎧 There standing on my front porch, is a little ghost and a cute little witch. <br/> 
🎧 They hold up a bag and say, "trick or treat." <br/> 
🎧 I put candy into their bags and they smile and say, "Thank you."<br/> 
🎧 Every October 31 is Halloween. <br/> 
🎧 That is when children dress up as different things (not just funny people, but things like animals or fruits or vegetables, etc). <br/> 
🎧 They go from door to door and get different candies or little toys from the people in the houses. <br/> 
🎧 Some children, who are not very nice, will do naughty things to houses where people are not home, like throwing eggs at their windows. <br/> 
🎧 I think that is bad.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes people decorate their houses for this day. <br/> 
🎧 Some of the houses can be pretty scary. <br/> 
🎧 They'll have scary noises coming from a tape recorder, too. <br/> 
🎧 However, it's only for a few days out of the year, so we may as well have fun with it.<br/>
🎧 This year my brother is dressing up as a skeleton, and I'm dressing up as a bride. <br/> 
🎧 I am wearing my mom's wedding dress. <br/> 
🎧 It is fun dressing up in costumes and putting on lots of makeup. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes our friends don't even know who we really are!<br/> 
🎧 The best part of Halloween is the candy, of course. <br/> 
🎧 I once got an entire garbage bag full of candy. <br/> 
🎧 Mom and Dad took it away because I was eating too much. <br/> 
🎧 Mom gave me a piece of candy every day, though. <br/> 
🎧 If you eat too much candy, you can get a stomach ache.<br/>
🎧 You need to remember to brush your teeth often, too, so you don't get cavities. <br/> 
🎧 Still, that candy sure does taste good!<br/> 
🎧 Well, it's time to go "trick or treating." <br/> 
🎧 So off I go, door to door, getting yummy candy and hearing people say, "Oh, aren't you pretty!"<br/>

🎧 "Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! HAPPY NEW YEAR!".<br/>
🎧 What is New Year's? <br/> 
🎧 Well, to me a New Year is when the date of the year changes. <br/> 
🎧 This year it is 2001, and on December 31 at midnight it will change to 2002. <br/> 
🎧 I wonder who invented the changing of years and how it was made the way it is. <br/> 
🎧 It must have been someone a long time ago, since it's already 2001.<br/>
🎧 When New Year's comes closer, a lot of people talk about New Year's resolutions. <br/> 
🎧 I don't bother making "resolutions" because I never do them anyway! <br/> 
🎧 And the ones that I do make are usually ones that will happen anyway. <br/> 
🎧 I guess it's just common sense.<br/>
🎧 The biggest reason why I like New Year's is because of the fireworks that we have here in<br/> 
🎧 Canada and many other countries, too. <br/> 
🎧 You should see some of the fireworks that go off.<br/>
🎧 There are many different colours. <br/> 
🎧 There's pink, blue, purple, yellow, green, red, even<br/> 
🎧 white, silver and gold. Fireworks make loud bangs, squeals, siren sounds, and sometimes all at once. <br/> 
🎧 There are lots of different sounds, but I can't even explain what they are all like.<br/>
🎧 Fireworks are best when it's very dark outside. <br/> 
🎧 They light up the whole sky! Sometimes, they look as though they are going to fall on you.<br/>
🎧 I like New Year's because it's fun in other ways, but the fireworks are the best part. <br/> 
🎧 You can buy fireworks to use for your own fireworks show. <br/> 
🎧 However, you have to be careful that no one gets burned or hurt.<br/>
🎧 Usually, there are parties at New Year's. <br/> 
🎧 Some people really dress up fancy and even wear masks. <br/> 
🎧 They don't know who one another is until midnight when they take their masks off. <br/> 
🎧 As midnight comes very close, everybody begins to count down, and then everyone yells out "Happy New Year's" and bang pots and pans or ring bells or honk horns. <br/> 
🎧 Join me in the count down on New Year's Eve. <br/> 
🎧 "Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one - HAPPY NEW YEAR!"<br/>

🎧 I like music. I have always liked music. <br/> 
🎧 Even when I was very young, I liked music. <br/> 
🎧 I like to listen to it, and to make it. <br/> 
🎧 When I was a little girl, listening to nice music would sometimes make me cry! <br/> 
🎧 That may seem silly, but the music was so pretty that I cried!<br/> 
🎧 As I grew older, I started to take piano lessons. <br/> 
🎧 I was not very good at first, but after a while I got better. <br/> 
🎧 Also, as I grew older, I started to take violin lessons. <br/> 
🎧 I did not sound very good at all at first, but I improved.<br/>
🎧 When I was a teenager in high school, I made sure I had music classes every year. <br/> 
🎧 those were the classes I enjoyed most of all. <br/> 
🎧 Everyone loved music, and we had a lot of fun. <br/> 
🎧 I started to take private singing lessons while I was in high school, too. <br/> 
🎧 I also sang in the choir, played in a band and acted in plays in high school. <br/> 
🎧 The plays were all musicals, so I got to sing and dance and enjoy music that way also. <br/> 
🎧 It was so much fun pretending to be other people!<br/> 
🎧 When I finished high school, I went to university to learn how to be a music teacher. <br/> 
🎧 That was a lot of fun because every day I was with other people who loved music as much as I do. <br/> 
🎧 Mostly I played the piano, but I also learned how to play the drums, a saxophone, a trombone, a French horn, a clarinet, a flute, which I REALLY was not very good at, and a viola. <br/> 
🎧 I took more singing lessons, too. <br/> 
🎧 We did not have plays to sing and act in, but I sang in the university choir. <br/> 
🎧 Some years, I played the piano for other students who were learning other instruments. <br/> 
🎧 One year, I played duets with another girl who was also there to play piano. <br/> 
🎧 She and I made sure we played fast, funny songs, so we really enjoyed ourselves doing it.<br/>
🎧 Now, I am a music teacher. <br/> 
🎧 I do not have a lot of students, not as many as I used to have anyway. <br/> 
🎧 I still find it very rewarding. <br/> 
🎧 I like to see people who start off not knowing very much, if anything, and go on to be very good at creating music.<br/>
🎧 I still love listening to music also. <br/> 
🎧 Music makes me happy when I am sad. <br/> 
🎧 It makes me want to dance or sing when I am already happy. <br/> 
🎧 Mostly, music just makes me glad that I am me and that music is alive in me

🎧 My baby is asleep in my arms. <br/> 
🎧 Her soft cheek rests against my chest, while her sweet breath puffs gently on my skin. <br/> 
🎧 Her tiny lips are puckered a bit. <br/> 
🎧 Her little eyelids flutter.<br/>
🎧 I wonder what she dreams about as she sleeps. <br/> 
🎧 Does she dream? <br/> 
🎧 I have heard her whimper in her sleep. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes she awakens with a scream. <br/> 
🎧 What is so scary in her little baby dreams? <br/> 
🎧 Once I heard her giggle as she slept. <br/> 
🎧 Her dreams must have been sweet that day.<br/>
🎧 I have had three babies. <br/> 
🎧 The one I am holding now is my last one. <br/> 
🎧 My other babies are grown up more and now at school. <br/> 
🎧 I love their childish play and laughter. <br/> 
🎧 I miss their baby dimples and their baby sounds and smells.<br/>
🎧 There is such joy in the birth of a new baby. <br/> 
🎧 We hear their first little cry, telling us all is well with their small world. <br/> 
🎧 We feel their newborn skin, wrinkled, soft and slightly damp.<br/>
🎧 We feel each little limb and are filled with wonder and humility. <br/> 
🎧 Life is good as baby takes its first food from its mother. <br/> 
🎧 Family gathers around, each waiting to hold and love this newest member. <br/> 
🎧 Each time the baby cries, its mom worries, and their bond becomes stronger.<br/>
🎧 Babies have their own special smell. <br/> 
🎧 Some have described it as "milk and innocence." <br/> 
🎧 It is the sweetest smell on earth, I think. <br/> 
🎧 It cannot be copied. Somehow, it disappears as baby grows.<br/>
🎧 I love to hear my baby talk. <br/> 
🎧 Once in a while I can even understand a little bit! <br/> 
🎧 She is so serious in her baby talk that I just have to pick her up and hug her. <br/> 
🎧 I love to hear her say "Mommy."<br/> 
🎧 When my baby is tickled, or when the dog or her big brothers do something funny, it is so sweet to hear her baby laugh. <br/> 
🎧 It's such a cute little giggle! Sometimes she laughs so<br/> 
🎧 hard, her face turns red, tears come to her eyes, and she falls down weak with the laughter. <br/> 
🎧 those who watch her can't help but laugh, too. <br/> 
🎧 I hope she always laughs so easily.<br/>
🎧 The parents watch with pride and joy as baby grows and has many "firsts." <br/> 
🎧 There is the first time baby sleeps through the night, rolls over, smiles, laughs, hugs and kisses. <br/> 
🎧 Then there is the first tooth, crawling, first step and first word. <br/> 
🎧 With each new first, the baby becomes less a baby!<br/> 
🎧 These steps are a little sad to parents, too, because they know they're "losing their baby." <br/> 
🎧 However, to a mother, even an adult child is still her baby! <br/> 
🎧 My baby is not perfect. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes she gets mad or whines for no reason. <br/> 
🎧 But, to me, she is still beautiful. <br/> 
🎧 Her smiles more than make up for her tears. <br/> 
🎧 Her hugs wipe away when she's been bad. <br/> 
🎧 I intend to cherish each moment with my baby while I can

🎧 I am almost nine years old and my bed time is 8:30 p.m. <br/> 
🎧 I think that is so unfair! <br/> 
🎧 I think I am old enough to stay up until at least 9:00 p.m. <br/> 
🎧 My parents say that I have to go to bed early because I have school the next day. <br/> 
🎧 I can't wait until I am grown up and can stay awake as long as I want. <br/> 
🎧 Even though I think I should be able to go to bed later, I do like our night time routine.<br/>
🎧 At about 8:l5 p.m., my Mom sends us up to put on our pajamas. <br/> 
🎧 When we come back downstairs, we read together. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes Mom will read to us, and sometimes we will read to her. <br/> 
🎧 If Dad is not working, he will sometimes read, too. <br/> 
🎧 Mostly it is Mom we read with though. <br/> 
🎧 When we read, Mom helps us with words we cannot read. <br/> 
🎧 We have to try and sound the word out, but if we are really stuck, she will help us. <br/> 
🎧 If we come to a place<br/> 
🎧 in our reading where we do not understand the meaning of what was written, we stop reading and look at Mom. <br/> 
🎧 She will tell us what it means or help us figure it out on our own.<br/>
🎧 After we are finished reading, we say goodnight to everyone in our house. <br/> 
🎧 First we say goodnight to Mom and give her a hug and a kiss. <br/> 
🎧 Then we do the same for Dad, then our little sister, and then our dog! <br/> 
🎧 Afterwards, we go upstairs and brush our teeth.<br/>
🎧 I have to do special stretching exercises for the muscles in my chest and legs, or I get pains when I run and play. <br/> 
🎧 I do my stretching before I get into bed. <br/> 
🎧 After my exercises, either my brother or I turn off the lights. <br/> 
🎧 We share a bedroom, so we take turns turning the light off.<br/>
🎧 Before we get into bed, we say our prayers. <br/> 
🎧 After we get into our beds, my brother and I talk to each other for a long time. <br/> 
🎧 We tell each other about our day, about what we hope will happen in the future, about our friends and all sorts of other important things. <br/> 
🎧 After awhile, we get so tired, we just fall asleep in the middle of talking!<br/> 
🎧 Even though we go to bed at 8:30 p.m., we talk so long we don't go to sleep until about l0:00 p.m. <br/> 
🎧 I still do not know why I have to go to bed so early when I am not even tired

🎧 Sometimes there is a problem in life that has no answer. <br/> 
🎧 Perhaps a child has trouble learning. <br/> 
🎧 Perhaps someone becomes ill. <br/> 
🎧 Perhaps there was love, but now there is conflict.<br/>
🎧 These problems are hard to solve. <br/> 
🎧 There is no single answer. <br/> 
🎧 Many people have opinions on what is the best answer.<br/>
🎧 But in mathematics there is an answer: a single answer that is right. <br/> 
🎧 There is no doubt; there is no argument; this answer is right. <br/> 
🎧 If we ask, "What is five plus seven?" <br/> 
🎧 The answer is twelve. <br/> 
🎧 If we ask, "How do you raise a child?" <br/> 
🎧 The answer would depend on the child and the parents.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes there is more than one way to reach an answer. <br/> 
🎧 Imagine we want to find the area of a triangle. <br/> 
🎧 The triangle has a right angle; the two sides surrounding the right angle are 20mm and 30mm. <br/> 
🎧 The formula for the area of a triangle is one half of (base)(height). <br/> 
🎧 We could consider the 20mm side as the base and 30 mm as the height.<br/>
🎧 We could consider the 30mm side as the base and the 20mm side as the height. <br/> 
🎧 Both ways would produce the same answer. <br/> 
🎧 The area is 300 square mm. <br/> 
🎧 Alternatively, we could consider the base as the third side of the triangle and then we would have to draw a height and measure it. <br/> 
🎧 The height would be neither 20 nor 30. <br/> 
🎧 But still we would end with the same answer. <br/> 
🎧 In math, the answer does not change.<br/>
🎧 Another reason I like math is the way it brings order. <br/> 
🎧 There can be a whole set of numbers or a whole set of measurements that mean nothing until mathematics organizes them into a pattern. <br/> 
🎧 An average number can be found; graphs can be drawn; the spread of the numbers and probabilities of a certain number happening can be calculated. <br/> 
🎧 This is like having a whole lot of dirty dishes after supper. <br/> 
🎧 Applying math is like washing and sorting the dishes and putting them back into the cupboard.<br/>
🎧 Math is a powerful tool. <br/> 
🎧 Math should be our friend, and we will find more ways to use it to better our lives

🎧 My sister had never been to Canada but came for a visit last April. <br/> 
🎧 I picked her up at the<br/> 
🎧 airport in Toronto and drove her through the traffic and multilane highways, past the grape vines and peach trees to Niagara Falls, where I live. <br/> 
🎧 She was very tired from the flight and soon slept.<br/>
🎧 The first day we walked to see the Falls. <br/> 
🎧 The spray from the Falls drifts high into the air and across the people standing to watch. <br/> 
🎧 There are people from all over the world watching the water and using their cameras. <br/> 
🎧 Because it was April there was still ice beside the water, huge chunks of ice that looked like white rocks. <br/> 
🎧 In the river there were floating pieces of ice moving downstream.<br/>
🎧 The next day we went to the town where the Niagara River joins Lake Ontario. <br/> 
🎧 The weather was warm. <br/> 
🎧 We walked a long way and our feet were hot, so we went down to the edge of the water to put our feet in. <br/> 
🎧 One toe in was enough! <br/> 
🎧 The water was so cold it made our feet ache! <br/> 
🎧 A piece of ice drifted beside our feet. <br/> 
🎧 I put one foot in for a second then out, as the pain of the cold went right through me! <br/> 
🎧 My sister could not understand how it could be so warm, but there was still ice.<br/>
🎧 Another day we went to see my daughter; she is living on a farm an hour's drive away.<br/>
🎧 We walked through her trees; the buds were starting to turn into leaves. <br/> 
🎧 We stopped and looked at the spring wildflowers. <br/> 
🎧 We climbed across a creek by walking over a fallen tree.<br/>
🎧 We saw the footprints of raccoons by the water. <br/> 
🎧 There was fresh air and sunshine and blue sky.<br/>
🎧 On the way home we stopped for hamburgers and fries at a drive-through restaurant. <br/> 
🎧 She had never been to a drive-through restaurant before. <br/> 
🎧 Then we went to a donut shop.<br/>
🎧 There are no donut shops where she lives. <br/> 
🎧 There was a choice of 20 different types of donut: some round, some with holes, some with frosting, some with jam inside--each was different.<br/>
🎧 The days passed quickly, and soon it was time to take her back to the airport. <br/> 
🎧 Some of the trees now had leaves; some of the tulips were now blooming. <br/> 
🎧 It was hard to say goodbye to my sister. <br/> 
🎧 I hope we can visit again soon

🎧 Today the sun was warm; the sky was blue with a few white clouds. <br/> 
🎧 It was a good day to pick strawberries; it was a good day to go to the beach.<br/>
🎧 I drove to a pick-your-own farm where people can pick their own fruit and buy it. <br/> 
🎧 There the fruit is very fresh and delicious. <br/> 
🎧 The owner of the farm gave everyone a row to pick their strawberries. <br/> 
🎧 Everyone was wearing sun hats. <br/> 
🎧 I knelt down on the straw between the rows and picked the big juicy red berries. <br/> 
🎧 I tasted one; it was warm from the sun.<br/>
🎧 When I bit into it the juice was sweet and strong. <br/> 
🎧 When three big pails were full, I went to pay for them and picked up some recipes for some strawberry desserts. <br/> 
🎧 I packed two of the pails in a cooler with some ice, and the other one we would eat at the beach.<br/>
🎧 I met my daughter at the beach. <br/> 
🎧 She had a soft pink blanket on the sand. <br/> 
🎧 This beach is beside a lake, and across the lake about 50 km away the large city can sometimes be seen. <br/> 
🎧 Today the wind blew cooler air across the lake over the people on the beach. <br/> 
🎧 There were children playing in the water. <br/> 
🎧 One man helped his son dig holes in the sand, and the water ran into the holes. <br/> 
🎧 One lady held her children's hands and walked down into the water. <br/> 
🎧 Families climbed over the rocks and sat on the last rock where the water was deep.<br/>
🎧 Teenagers rode bicycles and roller blades along the path beside the beach. <br/> 
🎧 Adults walked and ran along this path, carrying water bottles around their waists<br/> 
🎧 We sat on the blanket and ate sandwiches of meat and lettuce and strawberries from the pail. <br/> 
🎧 We talked and read books and lay in the sun, relaxing. <br/> 
🎧 We wore sunscreen, but our skin was getting hot. <br/> 
🎧 How cold was the water? We walked across the sand that almost burned our feet, to the edge of the water. <br/> 
🎧 She went right in and lay down floating. <br/> 
🎧 I put my toes in and felt the chill through my body. <br/> 
🎧 I went up to my knees, then my thighs, but that was far enough! My whole body was cooled down; I headed back to the blanket to lay in the sun again.<br/>
🎧 Soon it was time to go home, she was coming to my house for supper. <br/> 
🎧 We drove down the highway with the windows open and our hair blowing in the warm breeze. <br/> 
🎧 We cut the strawberries up and made a strawberry dessert with cake and ice cream. <br/> 
🎧 We sat outside in the backyard under the maple trees with the birds singing around us and ate our supper. <br/> 
🎧 It was a perfect ending to a relaxing summer day
