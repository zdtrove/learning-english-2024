🎧 It is the first school <span>dance</span> that I have ever been to. <br/> 
🎧 All of the <span>boys</span> are <span>standing</span> on one side of the <span>gymnasium</span>, and all of the <span>girls</span> are on the other side. <br/> 
🎧 There is <span>loud</span> music playing, and I can <span>hardly</span> hear my friends talking.<br/>
🎧 The music is going <span>fast</span>, and some people are <span>starting</span> to move to the <span>beat</span> of the <span>song</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Soon</span> all the <span>girls</span> are <span>dancing</span>, but the <span>boys</span> are still <span>standing</span> <span>against</span> the <span>wall</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Then</span> the <span>song</span> <span>ends</span>, and <span>slow</span> music comes on. <br/> 
🎧 I don't know what to do, so I just go and <span>stand</span> <span>against</span> the <span>wall</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Then</span> one of the <span>boys</span> in my class comes over and <span>asks</span> me if I would like to <span>dance</span> to the <span>slow</span> <span>song</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I really feel <span>awkward</span> and <span>nervous</span>, but say yes.<br/>
🎧 We go out into the <span>middle</span> of the gym, and he <span>puts</span> his <span>hands</span> on my <span>waist</span>, and I put my <span>hands</span> on his <span>shoulders</span>. <br/> 
🎧 We start to move to the music, and we <span>step</span> on each <span>other's</span> <span>feet!<br/></span> 
🎧 He is <span>bigger</span> than me, so my toe <span>starts</span> to <span>hurt</span> a little bit! <br/> 
🎧 <span>As</span> we <span>continue</span> to <span>"slow</span> <span>dance,"</span> more <span>boys</span> and <span>girls</span> come to the <span>middle</span> of the gym to <span>dance</span> together.<br/>
🎧 It sure is funny to <span>watch</span> people <span>dance</span> because they are <span>stepping</span> on each <span>other's</span> <span>toes</span> and <span>bumping</span> into each other and <span>turning</span> in <span>opposite</span> <span>directions</span>! <br/> 
🎧 <span>Soon</span> the <span>song</span> <span>ends</span>, and the <span>boys</span> go to one side of the gym again. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>girls</span> decide that they want to <span>dance</span> to a <span>fast</span> <span>song</span>, so they <span>stay</span> in the <span>middle</span> of the gym and <span>dance</span> with one another.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teachers</span> are <span>making</span> sure that we are <span>behaving</span> because they are <span>watching</span> us. <br/> 
🎧 I <span>wonder</span> if they want to <span>dance</span>. <br/> 
🎧 They probably are <span>remembering</span> their first school <span>dance</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I <span>wonder</span> if <span>someday</span> I'll be <span>grown</span> up just like the <span>teachers</span> and <span>laughing</span> at the <span>memories</span> of my first school <span>dance</span>? <br/> 
🎧 I sure hope <span>so!<br/>

🎧 Our <span>health</span> is very <span>important</span> to us. <br/> 
🎧 <span>People</span> can have good <span>jobs</span>, money or good looks.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, if they become <span>sick</span>, <span>those</span> things don't mean a thing. <br/> 
🎧 It is <span>wonderful</span> to feel good.<br/>
🎧 <span>Feeling</span> good isn't just about our <span>body</span>. <br/> 
🎧 It is also about our <span>mind</span> and <span>spirit</span>. <br/> 
🎧 We need to feel good in every <span>area</span> of our life.<br/>
🎧 One of the things we can do to be <span>healthy</span> is to get enough <span>sleep</span>. <br/> 
🎧 If we don't <span>sleep</span> well, or enough, it <span>hurts</span> our <span>body</span>. <br/> 
🎧 It is during <span>sleep</span> that our <span>body</span> <span>restores</span> <span>itself</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Everybody</span> <span>knows</span> we should also eat good <span>foods</span>. <br/> 
🎧 We need <span>milk</span> <span>products</span>, <span>meats</span>, <span>fruits</span> and <span>vegetables</span> and <span>breads</span> and <span>cereals</span>. <br/> 
🎧 We shouldn't eat too much fat or <span>sugar</span> things either. <br/> 
🎧 Of course, we just shouldn't eat too much at all! <br/> 
🎧 Another thing that is very <span>important</span> is water. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Most</span> people know our <span>bodies</span> are <span>mainly</span> water, and we need to keep that <span>replaced</span> with good <span>water--often!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Exercise</span> is very good for both our <span>body</span> and <span>mind</span>. <br/> 
🎧 It is good for our <span>heart</span>, <span>lungs</span>, <span>muscles</span> and <span>bones</span>. It <span>gets</span> <span>oxygen</span> to our <span>brain</span> to help us think better. <br/> 
🎧 It can help us be <span>smarter!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Doing</span> things that we <span>believe</span> are right and good <span>gives</span> us <span>peace</span> inside. <br/> 
🎧 It makes us be <span>nicer</span> people and is good for our <span>spirit</span>. <br/> 
🎧 When we do what we know is right, it helps to <span>reduce</span> <span>stress</span>, which isn't good for any <span>part</span> of us.<br/>
🎧 When we take <span>care</span> of our <span>body</span>, <span>mind</span>, and <span>spirit</span>, we feel good all over and inside, <span>too!<br/></span> 
🎧 What a <span>beautiful</span> <span>world</span> this would be if we could all work at doing these things for <span>ourselves</span> and also trying to be a help to <span>others!<br/>

🎧 <span>Ghosts</span>, <span>goblins</span>, <span>witches</span>, <span>princes</span> and <span>princesses</span>, <span>kings</span>, <span>queens</span>, <span>skeletons</span>! <br/> 
🎧 So may of these <span>"things"</span> are <span>walking</span> down my <span>street</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>"Oh</span>, no! They are <span>coming</span> to my <span>door!"</span> <br/> 
🎧 The <span>doorbell</span> <span>chimes</span>, and I <span>slowly</span> <span>open</span> the <span>door</span>. <br/> 
🎧 There <span>standing</span> on my <span>front</span> <span>porch</span>, is a little <span>ghost</span> and a <span>cute</span> little <span>witch</span>. <br/> 
🎧 They <span>hold</span> up a bag and say, <span>"trick</span> or <span>treat."</span> <br/> 
🎧 I put <span>candy</span> into their <span>bags</span> and they <span>smile</span> and say, <span>"Thank</span> <span>you."<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Every</span> <span>October</span> <span>31</span> is <span>Halloween</span>. <br/> 
🎧 That is when <span>children</span> <span>dress</span> up as different things <span>(not</span> just funny people, but things like <span>animals</span> or <span>fruits</span> or <span>vegetables</span>, <span>etc)</span>. <br/> 
🎧 They go from <span>door</span> to <span>door</span> and get different <span>candies</span> or little <span>toys</span> from the people in the <span>houses</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Some <span>children</span>, who are not very nice, will do <span>naughty</span> things to <span>houses</span> where people are not home, like <span>throwing</span> <span>eggs</span> at their <span>windows</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I think that is <span>bad</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes people <span>decorate</span> their <span>houses</span> for this day. <br/> 
🎧 Some of the <span>houses</span> can be <span>pretty</span> <span>scary</span>. <br/> 
🎧 They'll have <span>scary</span> <span>noises</span> <span>coming</span> from a <span>tape</span> <span>recorder</span>, too. <br/> 
🎧 <span>However</span>, it's only for a few <span>days</span> out of the year, so we may as well have fun with it.<br/>
🎧 This year my <span>brother</span> is <span>dressing</span> up as a <span>skeleton</span>, and I'm <span>dressing</span> up as a <span>bride</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I am <span>wearing</span> my <span>mom's</span> <span>wedding</span> <span>dress</span>. <br/> 
🎧 It is fun <span>dressing</span> up in <span>costumes</span> and <span>putting</span> on <span>lots</span> of <span>makeup</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes our friends don't even know who we really <span>are!<br/></span> 
🎧 The best <span>part</span> of <span>Halloween</span> is the <span>candy</span>, of course. <br/> 
🎧 I once got an <span>entire</span> <span>garbage</span> bag full of <span>candy</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Mom and Dad took it away because I was <span>eating</span> too much. <br/> 
🎧 Mom gave me a <span>piece</span> of <span>candy</span> every day, though. <br/> 
🎧 If you eat too much <span>candy</span>, you can get a <span>stomach</span> <span>ache</span>.<br/>
🎧 You need to <span>remember</span> to <span>brush</span> your <span>teeth</span> often, too, so you don't get <span>cavities</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Still</span>, that <span>candy</span> sure does <span>taste</span> <span>good!<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, it's time to go <span>"trick</span> or <span>treating."</span> <br/> 
🎧 So off I go, <span>door</span> to <span>door</span>, getting <span>yummy</span> <span>candy</span> and <span>hearing</span> people say, <span>"Oh</span>, aren't you <span>pretty!"<br/>

🎧 What is New <span>Year's</span>? <br/> 
🎧 Well, to me a New <span>Year</span> is when the <span>date</span> of the year changes. <br/> 
🎧 This year it is <span>2001</span>, and on <span>December</span> <span>31</span> at <span>midnight</span> it will change to <span>2002</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I <span>wonder</span> who <span>invented</span> the <span>changing</span> of years and how it was made the way it is. <br/> 
🎧 It <span>must</span> have been <span>someone</span> a long time ago, since it's <span>already</span> <span>2001</span>.<br/>
🎧 When New <span>Year's</span> comes <span>closer</span>, a lot of people talk about New <span>Year's</span> <span>resolutions</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I don't <span>bother</span> <span>making</span> <span>"resolutions"</span> because I never do them <span>anyway</span>! <br/> 
🎧 And the <span>ones</span> that I do make are usually <span>ones</span> that will <span>happen</span> <span>anyway</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I <span>guess</span> it's just <span>common</span> <span>sense</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>biggest</span> <span>reason</span> why I like New <span>Year's</span> is because of the <span>fireworks</span> that we have here <span>in<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Canada</span> and many other <span>countries</span>, too. <br/> 
🎧 You should see some of the <span>fireworks</span> that go off.<br/>
🎧 There are many different <span>colours</span>. <br/> 
🎧 There's <span>pink</span>, <span>blue</span>, <span>purple</span>, <span>yellow</span>, <span>green</span>, red, <span>even<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>white</span>, <span>silver</span> and <span>gold</span>. <span>Fireworks</span> make <span>loud</span> <span>bangs</span>, <span>squeals</span>, <span>siren</span> sounds, and sometimes all at once. <br/> 
🎧 There are <span>lots</span> of different sounds, but I can't even <span>explain</span> what they are all like.<br/>
🎧 <span>Fireworks</span> are best when it's very <span>dark</span> outside. <br/> 
🎧 They <span>light</span> up the <span>whole</span> sky! Sometimes, they look as though they are going to <span>fall</span> on you.<br/>
🎧 I like New <span>Year's</span> because it's fun in other <span>ways</span>, but the <span>fireworks</span> are the best <span>part</span>. <br/> 
🎧 You can buy <span>fireworks</span> to use for your own <span>fireworks</span> <span>show</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>However</span>, you have to be <span>careful</span> that no one <span>gets</span> <span>burned</span> or <span>hurt</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Usually</span>, there are <span>parties</span> at New <span>Year's</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Some people really <span>dress</span> up <span>fancy</span> and even <span>wear</span> <span>masks</span>. <br/> 
🎧 They don't know who one another is <span>until</span> <span>midnight</span> when they take their <span>masks</span> off. <br/> 
🎧 <span>As</span> <span>midnight</span> comes very <span>close</span>, <span>everybody</span> <span>begins</span> to <span>count</span> down, and then everyone <span>yells</span> out <span>"Happy</span> New <span>Year's"</span> and <span>bang</span> <span>pots</span> and <span>pans</span> or <span>ring</span> <span>bells</span> or <span>honk</span> <span>horns</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Join</span> me in the <span>count</span> down on New <span>Year's</span> <span>Eve</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>"Ten</span>, <span>nine</span>, <span>eight</span>, <span>seven</span>, six, <span>five</span>, <span>four</span>, <span>three</span>, two, one <span>-</span> <span>HAPPY</span> NEW <span>YEAR!"<br/>

🎧 I like music. I have always <span>liked</span> music. <br/> 
🎧 Even when I was very young, I <span>liked</span> music. <br/> 
🎧 I like to listen to it, and to make it. <br/> 
🎧 When I was a little <span>girl</span>, <span>listening</span> to nice music would sometimes make me cry! <br/> 
🎧 That may <span>seem</span> <span>silly</span>, but the music was so <span>pretty</span> that I <span>cried!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>As</span> I <span>grew</span> <span>older</span>, I <span>started</span> to take <span>piano</span> <span>lessons</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I was not very good at first, but after a <span>while</span> I got better. <br/> 
🎧 Also, as I <span>grew</span> <span>older</span>, I <span>started</span> to take <span>violin</span> <span>lessons</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I did not sound very good at all at first, but I <span>improved</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I was a <span>teenager</span> in high school, I made sure I had music <span>classes</span> every year. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Those</span> were the <span>classes</span> I <span>enjoyed</span> most of all. <br/> 
🎧 Everyone loved music, and we had a lot of fun. <br/> 
🎧 I <span>started</span> to take <span>private</span> <span>singing</span> <span>lessons</span> <span>while</span> I was in high school, too. <br/> 
🎧 I also <span>sang</span> in the <span>choir</span>, <span>played</span> in a <span>band</span> and <span>acted</span> in <span>plays</span> in high school. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>plays</span> were all <span>musicals</span>, so I got to <span>sing</span> and <span>dance</span> and enjoy music that way also. <br/> 
🎧 It was so much fun <span>pretending</span> to be other <span>people!<br/></span> 
🎧 When I <span>finished</span> high school, I went to <span>university</span> to learn how to be a music <span>teacher</span>. <br/> 
🎧 That was a lot of fun because every day I was with other people who loved music as much as I do. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Mostly</span> I <span>played</span> the <span>piano</span>, but I also <span>learned</span> how to play the <span>drums</span>, a <span>saxophone</span>, a <span>trombone</span>, a <span>French</span> <span>horn</span>, a <span>clarinet</span>, a <span>flute</span>, which I <span>REALLY</span> was not very good at, and a <span>viola</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I took more <span>singing</span> <span>lessons</span>, too. <br/> 
🎧 We did not have <span>plays</span> to <span>sing</span> and act in, but I <span>sang</span> in the <span>university</span> <span>choir</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Some years, I <span>played</span> the <span>piano</span> for other <span>students</span> who were <span>learning</span> other <span>instruments</span>. <br/> 
🎧 One year, I <span>played</span> <span>duets</span> with another <span>girl</span> who was also there to play <span>piano</span>. <br/> 
🎧 She and I made sure we <span>played</span> <span>fast</span>, funny <span>songs</span>, so we really <span>enjoyed</span> <span>ourselves</span> doing it.<br/>
🎧 Now, I am a music <span>teacher</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I do not have a lot of <span>students</span>, not as many as I used to have <span>anyway</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I still find it very <span>rewarding</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I like to see people who start off not <span>knowing</span> very much, if anything, and go on to be very good at <span>creating</span> music.<br/>
🎧 I still love <span>listening</span> to music also. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Music</span> makes me happy when I am sad. <br/> 
🎧 It makes me want to <span>dance</span> or <span>sing</span> when I am <span>already</span> happy. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Mostly</span>, music just makes me glad that I am me and that music is <span>alive</span> in <span>me.<br/>

🎧 <span>Life</span> is good as <span>baby</span> takes its first food from its <span>mother</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Family</span> <span>gathers</span> around, each <span>waiting</span> to <span>hold</span> and love this <span>newest</span> <span>member</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Each</span> time the <span>baby</span> <span>cries</span>, its mom <span>worries</span>, and their <span>bond</span> <span>becomes</span> <span>stronger</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Babies</span> have their own special <span>smell</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Some have <span>described</span> it as <span>"milk</span> and <span>innocence."</span> <br/> 
🎧 It is the <span>sweetest</span> <span>smell</span> on <span>earth</span>, I think. <br/> 
🎧 It <span>cannot</span> be <span>copied</span>. <span>Somehow</span>, it <span>disappears</span> as <span>baby</span> <span>grows</span>.<br/>
🎧 I love to hear my <span>baby</span> talk. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Once</span> in a <span>while</span> I can even <span>understand</span> a little bit! <br/> 
🎧 She is so <span>serious</span> in her <span>baby</span> talk that I just have to <span>pick</span> her up and hug her. <br/> 
🎧 I love to hear her say <span>"Mommy."<br/></span> 
🎧 When my <span>baby</span> is <span>tickled</span>, or when the dog or her big <span>brothers</span> do something funny, it is so <span>sweet</span> to hear her <span>baby</span> <span>laugh</span>. <br/> 
🎧 It's such a <span>cute</span> little <span>giggle</span>! Sometimes she <span>laughs</span> <span>so<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>hard</span>, her <span>face</span> <span>turns</span> red, <span>tears</span> come to her <span>eyes</span>, and she <span>falls</span> down <span>weak</span> with the <span>laughter</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Those</span> who <span>watch</span> her can't help but <span>laugh</span>, too. <br/> 
🎧 I hope she always <span>laughs</span> so <span>easily</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>parents</span> <span>watch</span> with <span>pride</span> and joy as <span>baby</span> <span>grows</span> and has many <span>"firsts."</span> <br/> 
🎧 There is the first time <span>baby</span> <span>sleeps</span> through the <span>night</span>, <span>rolls</span> over, <span>smiles</span>, <span>laughs</span>, <span>hugs</span> and <span>kisses</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Then</span> there is the first <span>tooth</span>, <span>crawling</span>, first <span>step</span> and first <span>word</span>. <br/> 
🎧 With each new first, the <span>baby</span> <span>becomes</span> less a <span>baby!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>These</span> <span>steps</span> are a little sad to <span>parents</span>, too, because they know they're <span>"losing</span> their <span>baby."</span> <br/> 
🎧 <span>However</span>, to a <span>mother</span>, even an <span>adult</span> <span>child</span> is still her <span>baby</span>! <br/> 
🎧 My <span>baby</span> is not <span>perfect</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes she <span>gets</span> mad or <span>whines</span> for no <span>reason</span>. <br/> 
🎧 But, to me, she is still <span>beautiful</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Her <span>smiles</span> more than make up for her <span>tears</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Her <span>hugs</span> <span>wipe</span> away when she's been bad. <br/> 
🎧 I <span>intend</span> to <span>cherish</span> each <span>moment</span> with my <span>baby</span> <span>while</span> I <span>can!<br/>

🎧 I am almost <span>nine</span> years old and my bed time is <span>8:30</span> <span>p.m</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I think that is so <span>unfair</span>! <br/> 
🎧 I think I am old enough to <span>stay</span> up <span>until</span> at <span>least</span> <span>9:00</span> <span>p.m</span>. <br/> 
🎧 My <span>parents</span> say that I have to go to bed <span>early</span> because I have school the next day. <br/> 
🎧 I can't wait <span>until</span> I am <span>grown</span> up and can <span>stay</span> <span>awake</span> as long as I want. <br/> 
🎧 Even though I think I should be able to go to bed later, I do like our <span>night</span> time <span>routine</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>At</span> about <span>8:l5</span> <span>p.m</span>., my Mom <span>sends</span> us up to put on our <span>pajamas</span>. <br/> 
🎧 When we come back <span>downstairs</span>, we read together. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes Mom will read to us, and sometimes we will read to her. <br/> 
🎧 If Dad is not working, he will sometimes read, too. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Mostly</span> it is Mom we read with though. <br/> 
🎧 When we read, Mom helps us with <span>words</span> we <span>cannot</span> read. <br/> 
🎧 We have to try and sound the <span>word</span> out, but if we are really <span>stuck</span>, she will help us. <br/> 
🎧 If we come to a <span>place<br/></span> 
🎧 in our <span>reading</span> where we do not <span>understand</span> the <span>meaning</span> of what was <span>written</span>, we <span>stop</span> <span>reading</span> and look at Mom. <br/> 
🎧 She will tell us what it <span>means</span> or help us <span>figure</span> it out on our own.<br/>
🎧 After we are <span>finished</span> <span>reading</span>, we say <span>goodnight</span> to everyone in our house. <br/> 
🎧 First we say <span>goodnight</span> to Mom and give her a hug and a <span>kiss</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Then</span> we do the same for Dad, then our little <span>sister</span>, and then our dog! <br/> 
🎧 <span>Afterwards</span>, we go <span>upstairs</span> and <span>brush</span> our <span>teeth</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have to do special <span>stretching</span> <span>exercises</span> for the <span>muscles</span> in my <span>chest</span> and <span>legs</span>, or I get <span>pains</span> when I run and play. <br/> 
🎧 I do my <span>stretching</span> before I get into bed. <br/> 
🎧 After my <span>exercises</span>, either my <span>brother</span> or I <span>turn</span> off the <span>lights</span>. <br/> 
🎧 We share a <span>bedroom</span>, so we take <span>turns</span> <span>turning</span> the <span>light</span> off.<br/>
🎧 <span>Before</span> we get into bed, we say our <span>prayers</span>. <br/> 
🎧 After we get into our <span>beds</span>, my <span>brother</span> and I talk to each other for a long time. <br/> 
🎧 We tell each other about our day, about what we hope will <span>happen</span> in the future, about our friends and all <span>sorts</span> of other <span>important</span> things. <br/> 
🎧 After <span>awhile</span>, we get so <span>tired</span>, we just <span>fall</span> <span>asleep</span> in the <span>middle</span> of <span>talking!<br/></span> 
🎧 Even though we go to bed at <span>8:30</span> <span>p.m</span>., we talk so long we don't go to <span>sleep</span> <span>until</span> about <span>l0:00</span> <span>p.m</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I still do not know why I have to go to bed so <span>early</span> when I am not even <span>tired!<br/>

🎧 Sometimes there is a <span>problem</span> in life that has no <span>answer</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Perhaps</span> a <span>child</span> has <span>trouble</span> <span>learning</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Perhaps</span> <span>someone</span> <span>becomes</span> ill. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Perhaps</span> there was love, but now there is <span>conflict</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>These</span> <span>problems</span> are <span>hard</span> to <span>solve</span>. <br/> 
🎧 There is no <span>single</span> <span>answer</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Many people have <span>opinions</span> on what is the best <span>answer</span>.<br/>
🎧 But in <span>mathematics</span> there is an <span>answer:</span> a <span>single</span> <span>answer</span> that is right. <br/> 
🎧 There is no <span>doubt;</span> there is no <span>argument;</span> this <span>answer</span> is right. <br/> 
🎧 If we ask, <span>"What</span> is <span>five</span> <span>plus</span> <span>seven?"</span> <br/> 
🎧 The <span>answer</span> is <span>twelve</span>. <br/> 
🎧 If we ask, <span>"How</span> do you <span>raise</span> a <span>child?"</span> <br/> 
🎧 The <span>answer</span> would <span>depend</span> on the <span>child</span> and the <span>parents</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes there is more than one way to <span>reach</span> an <span>answer</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Imagine</span> we want to find the <span>area</span> of a <span>triangle</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>triangle</span> has a right <span>angle;</span> the two <span>sides</span> <span>surrounding</span> the right <span>angle</span> are <span>20mm</span> and <span>30mm</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>formula</span> for the <span>area</span> of a <span>triangle</span> is one <span>half</span> of <span>(base)(height)</span>. <br/> 
🎧 We could <span>consider</span> the <span>20mm</span> side as the <span>base</span> and <span>30</span> <span>mm</span> as the <span>height</span>.<br/>
🎧 We could <span>consider</span> the <span>30mm</span> side as the <span>base</span> and the <span>20mm</span> side as the <span>height</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Both <span>ways</span> would <span>produce</span> the same <span>answer</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>area</span> is <span>300</span> <span>square</span> <span>mm</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Alternatively</span>, we could <span>consider</span> the <span>base</span> as the <span>third</span> side of the <span>triangle</span> and then we would have to <span>draw</span> a <span>height</span> and <span>measure</span> it. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>height</span> would be <span>neither</span> <span>20</span> <span>nor</span> <span>30</span>. <br/> 
🎧 But still we would end with the same <span>answer</span>. <br/> 
🎧 In <span>math</span>, the <span>answer</span> does not change.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>reason</span> I like <span>math</span> is the way it <span>brings</span> <span>order</span>. <br/> 
🎧 There can be a <span>whole</span> set of <span>numbers</span> or a <span>whole</span> set of <span>measurements</span> that mean <span>nothing</span> <span>until</span> <span>mathematics</span> <span>organizes</span> them into a <span>pattern</span>. <br/> 
🎧 An <span>average</span> <span>number</span> can be <span>found;</span> <span>graphs</span> can be <span>drawn;</span> the <span>spread</span> of the <span>numbers</span> and <span>probabilities</span> of a <span>certain</span> <span>number</span> <span>happening</span> can be <span>calculated</span>. <br/> 
🎧 This is like having a <span>whole</span> lot of <span>dirty</span> <span>dishes</span> after <span>supper</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Applying</span> <span>math</span> is like <span>washing</span> and <span>sorting</span> the <span>dishes</span> and <span>putting</span> them back into the <span>cupboard</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Math</span> is a <span>powerful</span> <span>tool</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Math</span> should be our friend, and we will find more <span>ways</span> to use it to better our <span>lives.<br/>

🎧 My <span>sister</span> had never been to <span>Canada</span> but came for a visit last <span>April</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I <span>picked</span> her up at <span>the<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>airport</span> in <span>Toronto</span> and <span>drove</span> her through the <span>traffic</span> and <span>multilane</span> <span>highways</span>, <span>past</span> the <span>grape</span> <span>vines</span> and <span>peach</span> <span>trees</span> to <span>Niagara</span> <span>Falls</span>, where I live. <br/> 
🎧 She was very <span>tired</span> from the <span>flight</span> and soon <span>slept</span>.<br/>
🎧 The first day we <span>walked</span> to see the <span>Falls</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>spray</span> from the <span>Falls</span> <span>drifts</span> high into the air and across the people <span>standing</span> to <span>watch</span>. <br/> 
🎧 There are people from all over the <span>world</span> <span>watching</span> the water and <span>using</span> their <span>cameras</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Because it was <span>April</span> there was still ice <span>beside</span> the water, <span>huge</span> <span>chunks</span> of ice that <span>looked</span> like <span>white</span> <span>rocks</span>. <br/> 
🎧 In the <span>river</span> there were <span>floating</span> <span>pieces</span> of ice <span>moving</span> <span>downstream</span>.<br/>
🎧 The next day we went to the <span>town</span> where the <span>Niagara</span> <span>River</span> <span>joins</span> <span>Lake</span> <span>Ontario</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>weather</span> was <span>warm</span>. <br/> 
🎧 We <span>walked</span> a long way and our <span>feet</span> were hot, so we went down to the <span>edge</span> of the water to put our <span>feet</span> in. <br/> 
🎧 One toe in was enough! <br/> 
🎧 The water was so <span>cold</span> it made our <span>feet</span> <span>ache</span>! <br/> 
🎧 A <span>piece</span> of ice <span>drifted</span> <span>beside</span> our <span>feet</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I put one <span>foot</span> in for a <span>second</span> then out, as the <span>pain</span> of the <span>cold</span> went right through me! <br/> 
🎧 My <span>sister</span> could not <span>understand</span> how it could be so <span>warm</span>, but there was still <span>ice</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another day we went to see my <span>daughter;</span> she is living on a <span>farm</span> an <span>hour's</span> drive away.<br/>
🎧 We <span>walked</span> through her <span>trees;</span> the <span>buds</span> were <span>starting</span> to <span>turn</span> into <span>leaves</span>. <br/> 
🎧 We <span>stopped</span> and <span>looked</span> at the <span>spring</span> <span>wildflowers</span>. <br/> 
🎧 We <span>climbed</span> across a <span>creek</span> by <span>walking</span> over a <span>fallen</span> <span>tree</span>.<br/>
🎧 We saw the <span>footprints</span> of <span>raccoons</span> by the water. <br/> 
🎧 There was <span>fresh</span> air and <span>sunshine</span> and <span>blue</span> <span>sky</span>.<br/>
🎧 On the way home we <span>stopped</span> for <span>hamburgers</span> and <span>fries</span> at a <span>drive-through</span> <span>restaurant</span>. <br/> 
🎧 She had never been to a <span>drive-through</span> <span>restaurant</span> before. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Then</span> we went to a <span>donut</span> <span>shop</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are no <span>donut</span> <span>shops</span> where she lives. <br/> 
🎧 There was a <span>choice</span> of <span>20</span> different <span>types</span> of <span>donut:</span> some <span>round</span>, some with <span>holes</span>, some with <span>frosting</span>, some with jam <span>inside--each</span> was different.<br/>

🎧 Today the sun was <span>warm;</span> the sky was <span>blue</span> with a few <span>white</span> <span>clouds</span>. <br/> 
🎧 It was a good day to <span>pick</span> <span>strawberries;</span> it was a good day to go to the <span>beach</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>drove</span> to a <span>pick-your-own</span> <span>farm</span> where people can <span>pick</span> their own <span>fruit</span> and buy it. <br/> 
🎧 There the <span>fruit</span> is very <span>fresh</span> and <span>delicious</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>owner</span> of the <span>farm</span> gave everyone a row to <span>pick</span> their <span>strawberries</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Everyone was <span>wearing</span> sun <span>hats</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I <span>knelt</span> down on the <span>straw</span> between the <span>rows</span> and <span>picked</span> the big <span>juicy</span> red <span>berries</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I <span>tasted</span> <span>one;</span> it was <span>warm</span> from the <span>sun</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I bit into it the <span>juice</span> was <span>sweet</span> and <span>strong</span>. <br/> 
🎧 When <span>three</span> big <span>pails</span> were full, I went to pay for them and <span>picked</span> up some <span>recipes</span> for some <span>strawberry</span> <span>desserts</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I <span>packed</span> two of the <span>pails</span> in a <span>cooler</span> with some ice, and the other one we would eat at the <span>beach</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>met</span> my <span>daughter</span> at the <span>beach</span>. <br/> 
🎧 She had a <span>soft</span> <span>pink</span> <span>blanket</span> on the <span>sand</span>. <br/> 
🎧 This <span>beach</span> is <span>beside</span> a <span>lake</span>, and across the <span>lake</span> about <span>50</span> <span>km</span> away the <span>large</span> <span>city</span> can sometimes be <span>seen</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Today the <span>wind</span> <span>blew</span> <span>cooler</span> air across the <span>lake</span> over the people on the <span>beach</span>. <br/> 
🎧 There were <span>children</span> playing in the water. <br/> 
🎧 One man <span>helped</span> his son dig <span>holes</span> in the <span>sand</span>, and the water ran into the <span>holes</span>. <br/> 
🎧 One <span>lady</span> <span>held</span> her <span>children's</span> <span>hands</span> and <span>walked</span> down into the water. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Families</span> <span>climbed</span> over the <span>rocks</span> and <span>sat</span> on the last <span>rock</span> where the water was <span>deep</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Teenagers</span> <span>rode</span> <span>bicycles</span> and <span>roller</span> <span>blades</span> along the <span>path</span> <span>beside</span> the <span>beach</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Adults</span> <span>walked</span> and ran along this <span>path</span>, <span>carrying</span> water <span>bottles</span> around their <span>waists<br/></span> 
🎧 We <span>sat</span> on the <span>blanket</span> and ate <span>sandwiches</span> of <span>meat</span> and <span>lettuce</span> and <span>strawberries</span> from the <span>pail</span>. <br/> 
🎧 We <span>talked</span> and read <span>books</span> and lay in the sun, <span>relaxing</span>. <br/> 
🎧 We <span>wore</span> <span>sunscreen</span>, but our <span>skin</span> was getting hot. <br/> 
🎧 How <span>cold</span> was the water? We <span>walked</span> across the <span>sand</span> that almost <span>burned</span> our <span>feet</span>, to the <span>edge</span> of the water. <br/> 
🎧 She went right in and lay down <span>floating</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I put my <span>toes</span> in and <span>felt</span> the <span>chill</span> through my <span>body</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I went up to my <span>knees</span>, then my <span>thighs</span>, but that was far enough! My <span>whole</span> <span>body</span> was <span>cooled</span> <span>down;</span> I <span>headed</span> back to the <span>blanket</span> to lay in the sun again.<br/>
🎧 <span>Soon</span> it was time to go home, she was <span>coming</span> to my house for <span>supper</span>. <br/> 
🎧 We <span>drove</span> down the <span>highway</span> with the <span>windows</span> <span>open</span> and our <span>hair</span> <span>blowing</span> in the <span>warm</span> <span>breeze</span>. <br/> 
🎧 We cut the <span>strawberries</span> up and made a <span>strawberry</span> <span>dessert</span> with <span>cake</span> and ice <span>cream</span>. <br/> 
🎧 We <span>sat</span> outside in the <span>backyard</span> under the <span>maple</span> <span>trees</span> with the <span>birds</span> <span>singing</span> around us and ate our <span>supper</span>. <br/> 
🎧 It was a <span>perfect</span> <span>ending</span> to a <span>relaxing</span> <span>summer</span> <span>day.<br/>
