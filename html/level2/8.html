🎧 <span>It</span> <span>is</span> the <span>first</span> <span>school</span> <span>dance</span> <span>that</span> I have <span>ever</span> <span>been</span> to. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 All <span>of</span> the <span>boys</span> are <span>standing</span> <span>on</span> one <span>side</span> <span>of</span> the <span>gymnasium</span>, and all <span>of</span> the <span>girls</span> are <span>on</span> the <span>other</span> <span>side</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There <span>is</span> <span>loud</span> <span>music</span> <span>playing</span>, and I can <span>hardly</span> <span>hear</span> my <span>friends</span> <span>talking.<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>music</span> <span>is</span> <span>going</span> <span>fast</span>, and <span>some</span> <span>people</span> are <span>starting</span> to <span>move</span> to the <span>beat</span> <span>of</span> the <span>song.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Soon</span> all the <span>girls</span> are <span>dancing</span>, but the <span>boys</span> are <span>still</span> <span>standing</span> <span>against</span> the <span>wall</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Then</span> the <span>song</span> <span>ends</span>, and <span>slow</span> <span>music</span> <span>comes</span> <span>on</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I don't <span>know</span> what to do, so I <span>just</span> <span>go</span> and <span>stand</span> <span>against</span> the <span>wall</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Then</span> one <span>of</span> the <span>boys</span> <span>in</span> my <span>class</span> <span>comes</span> <span>over</span> and <span>asks</span> me <span>if</span> I <span>would</span> <span>like</span> to <span>dance</span> to the <span>slow</span> <span>song</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>really</span> <span>feel</span> <span>awkward</span> and <span>nervous</span>, but say <span>yes.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>We</span> <span>go</span> out <span>into</span> the <span>middle</span> <span>of</span> the gym, and <span>he</span> <span>puts</span> his <span>hands</span> <span>on</span> my <span>waist</span>, and I put my <span>hands</span> <span>on</span> his <span>shoulders</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>We</span> <span>start</span> to <span>move</span> to the <span>music</span>, and <span>we</span> <span>step</span> <span>on</span> <span>each</span> <span>other's</span> <span>feet!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>He</span> <span>is</span> <span>bigger</span> <span>than</span> me, so my toe <span>starts</span> to <span>hurt</span> a <span>little</span> bit! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>As</span> <span>we</span> <span>continue</span> to <span>"slow</span> <span>dance,"</span> <span>more</span> <span>boys</span> and <span>girls</span> <span>come</span> to the <span>middle</span> <span>of</span> the gym to <span>dance</span> <span>together.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>It</span> <span>sure</span> <span>is</span> <span>funny</span> to <span>watch</span> <span>people</span> <span>dance</span> <span>because</span> <span>they</span> are <span>stepping</span> <span>on</span> <span>each</span> <span>other's</span> <span>toes</span> and <span>bumping</span> <span>into</span> <span>each</span> <span>other</span> and <span>turning</span> <span>in</span> <span>opposite</span> <span>directions</span>! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Soon</span> the <span>song</span> <span>ends</span>, and the <span>boys</span> <span>go</span> to one <span>side</span> <span>of</span> the gym <span>again</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>girls</span> <span>decide</span> <span>that</span> <span>they</span> <span>want</span> to <span>dance</span> to a <span>fast</span> <span>song</span>, so <span>they</span> <span>stay</span> <span>in</span> the <span>middle</span> <span>of</span> the gym and <span>dance</span> <span>with</span> one <span>another.<br/></span> 
🎧 Our <span>teachers</span> are <span>making</span> <span>sure</span> <span>that</span> <span>we</span> are <span>behaving</span> <span>because</span> <span>they</span> are <span>watching</span> <span>us</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>wonder</span> <span>if</span> <span>they</span> <span>want</span> to <span>dance</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>They</span> <span>probably</span> are <span>remembering</span> <span>their</span> <span>first</span> <span>school</span> <span>dance</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>wonder</span> <span>if</span> <span>someday</span> <span>I'll</span> be <span>grown</span> <span>up</span> <span>just</span> <span>like</span> the <span>teachers</span> and <span>laughing</span> <span>at</span> the <span>memories</span> <span>of</span> my <span>first</span> <span>school</span> <span>dance</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>sure</span> <span>hope</span> <span>so!<br/>

🎧 What <span>is</span> New <span>Year's</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Well</span>, to me a New <span>Year</span> <span>is</span> when the <span>date</span> <span>of</span> the <span>year</span> <span>changes</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>This</span> <span>year</span> <span>it</span> <span>is</span> <span>2001</span>, and <span>on</span> <span>December</span> <span>31</span> <span>at</span> <span>midnight</span> <span>it</span> <span>will</span> <span>change</span> to <span>2002</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>wonder</span> who <span>invented</span> the <span>changing</span> <span>of</span> <span>years</span> and how <span>it</span> was <span>made</span> the way <span>it</span> <span>is</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>It</span> <span>must</span> have <span>been</span> <span>someone</span> a <span>long</span> <span>time</span> ago, <span>since</span> it's <span>already</span> <span>2001.<br/></span> 
🎧 When New <span>Year's</span> <span>comes</span> <span>closer</span>, a lot <span>of</span> <span>people</span> <span>talk</span> <span>about</span> New <span>Year's</span> <span>resolutions</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I don't <span>bother</span> <span>making</span> <span>"resolutions"</span> <span>because</span> I <span>never</span> do <span>them</span> <span>anyway</span>! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 And the <span>ones</span> <span>that</span> I do <span>make</span> are <span>usually</span> <span>ones</span> <span>that</span> <span>will</span> <span>happen</span> <span>anyway</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>guess</span> it's <span>just</span> <span>common</span> <span>sense.<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>biggest</span> <span>reason</span> why I <span>like</span> New <span>Year's</span> <span>is</span> <span>because</span> <span>of</span> the <span>fireworks</span> <span>that</span> <span>we</span> have <span>here</span> <span>in<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Canada</span> and <span>many</span> <span>other</span> <span>countries</span>, too. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 You <span>should</span> see <span>some</span> <span>of</span> the <span>fireworks</span> <span>that</span> <span>go</span> <span>off.<br/></span> 
🎧 There are <span>many</span> <span>different</span> <span>colours</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There's <span>pink</span>, <span>blue</span>, <span>purple</span>, <span>yellow</span>, <span>green</span>, red, <span>even<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>white</span>, <span>silver</span> and <span>gold</span>. <span>Fireworks</span> <span>make</span> <span>loud</span> <span>bangs</span>, <span>squeals</span>, <span>siren</span> <span>sounds</span>, and <span>sometimes</span> all <span>at</span> <span>once</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There are <span>lots</span> <span>of</span> <span>different</span> <span>sounds</span>, but I can't <span>even</span> <span>explain</span> what <span>they</span> are all <span>like.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Fireworks</span> are <span>best</span> when it's <span>very</span> <span>dark</span> <span>outside</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 She and I <span>made</span> <span>sure</span> <span>we</span> <span>played</span> <span>fast</span>, <span>funny</span> <span>songs</span>, so <span>we</span> <span>really</span> <span>enjoyed</span> <span>ourselves</span> <span>doing</span> <span>it.<br/></span>

🎧 <span>Music</span> <span>makes</span> me <span>happy</span> when I <span>am</span> sad. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>It</span> <span>makes</span> me <span>want</span> to <span>dance</span> <span>or</span> <span>sing</span> when I <span>am</span> <span>already</span> <span>happy</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>Sometimes</span> there <span>is</span> a <span>problem</span> <span>in</span> <span>life</span> <span>that</span> has <span>no</span> <span>answer</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>Perhaps</span> <span>someone</span> <span>becomes</span> ill. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Perhaps</span> there was <span>love</span>, but now there <span>is</span> <span>conflict.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>These</span> <span>problems</span> are <span>hard</span> to <span>solve</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There <span>is</span> <span>no</span> <span>single</span> <span>answer</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Many</span> <span>people</span> have <span>opinions</span> <span>on</span> what <span>is</span> the <span>best</span> <span>answer.<br/></span> 
🎧 But <span>in</span> <span>mathematics</span> there <span>is</span> an <span>answer:</span> a <span>single</span> <span>answer</span> <span>that</span> <span>is</span> <span>right</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There <span>is</span> <span>no</span> <span>doubt;</span> there <span>is</span> <span>no</span> <span>argument;</span> <span>this</span> <span>answer</span> <span>is</span> <span>right</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>If</span> <span>we</span> ask, <span>"What</span> <span>is</span> <span>five</span> <span>plus</span> <span>seven?"</span> <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>answer</span> <span>is</span> <span>twelve</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>If</span> <span>we</span> ask, <span>"How</span> do you <span>raise</span> a <span>child?"</span> <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>answer</span> <span>would</span> <span>depend</span> <span>on</span> the <span>child</span> and the <span>parents.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span> there <span>is</span> <span>more</span> <span>than</span> one way to <span>reach</span> an <span>answer</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Imagine</span> <span>we</span> <span>want</span> to <span>find</span> the <span>area</span> <span>of</span> a <span>triangle</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>triangle</span> has a <span>right</span> <span>angle;</span> the two <span>sides</span> <span>surrounding</span> the <span>right</span> <span>angle</span> are <span>20mm</span> and <span>30mm</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>formula</span> for the <span>area</span> <span>of</span> a <span>triangle</span> <span>is</span> one <span>half</span> <span>of</span> <span>(base)(height)</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>We</span> <span>could</span> <span>consider</span> the <span>20mm</span> <span>side</span> <span>as</span> the <span>base</span> and <span>30</span> <span>mm</span> <span>as</span> the <span>height.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>We</span> <span>could</span> <span>consider</span> the <span>30mm</span> <span>side</span> <span>as</span> the <span>base</span> and the <span>20mm</span> <span>side</span> <span>as</span> the <span>height</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Both</span> <span>ways</span> <span>would</span> <span>produce</span> the <span>same</span> <span>answer</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>area</span> <span>is</span> <span>300</span> <span>square</span> <span>mm</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 The <span>height</span> <span>would</span> be <span>neither</span> <span>20</span> <span>nor</span> <span>30</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 But <span>still</span> <span>we</span> <span>would</span> end <span>with</span> the <span>same</span> <span>answer</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>In</span> <span>math</span>, the <span>answer</span> <span>does</span> not <span>change.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Another</span> <span>reason</span> I <span>like</span> <span>math</span> <span>is</span> the way <span>it</span> <span>brings</span> <span>order</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There can be a <span>whole</span> set <span>of</span> <span>numbers</span> <span>or</span> a <span>whole</span> set <span>of</span> <span>measurements</span> <span>that</span> <span>mean</span> <span>nothing</span> <span>until</span> <span>mathematics</span> <span>organizes</span> <span>them</span> <span>into</span> a <span>pattern</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 An <span>average</span> <span>number</span> can be <span>found;</span> <span>graphs</span> can be <span>drawn;</span> the <span>spread</span> <span>of</span> the <span>numbers</span> and <span>probabilities</span> <span>of</span> a <span>certain</span> <span>number</span> <span>happening</span> can be <span>calculated</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>This</span> <span>is</span> <span>like</span> <span>having</span> a <span>whole</span> lot <span>of</span> <span>dirty</span> <span>dishes</span> <span>after</span> <span>supper</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Applying</span> <span>math</span> <span>is</span> <span>like</span> <span>washing</span> and <span>sorting</span> the <span>dishes</span> and <span>putting</span> <span>them</span> <span>back</span> <span>into</span> the <span>cupboard.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Math</span> <span>is</span> a <span>powerful</span> <span>tool</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Math</span> <span>should</span> be our <span>friend</span>, and <span>we</span> <span>will</span> <span>find</span> <span>more</span> <span>ways</span> to use <span>it</span> to <span>better</span> our <span>lives.<br/>

🎧 My <span>sister</span> had <span>never</span> <span>been</span> to <span>Canada</span> but <span>came</span> for a <span>visit</span> <span>last</span> <span>April</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>picked</span> her <span>up</span> <span>at</span> <span>the<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>airport</span> <span>in</span> <span>Toronto</span> and <span>drove</span> her <span>through</span> the <span>traffic</span> and <span>multilane</span> <span>highways</span>, <span>past</span> the <span>grape</span> <span>vines</span> and <span>peach</span> <span>trees</span> to <span>Niagara</span> <span>Falls</span>, where I <span>live</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She was <span>very</span> <span>tired</span> <span>from</span> the <span>flight</span> and <span>soon</span> <span>slept.<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>first</span> day <span>we</span> <span>walked</span> to see the <span>Falls</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>spray</span> <span>from</span> the <span>Falls</span> <span>drifts</span> <span>high</span> <span>into</span> the air and <span>across</span> the <span>people</span> <span>standing</span> to <span>watch</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 The <span>next</span> day <span>we</span> <span>went</span> to the <span>town</span> where the <span>Niagara</span> <span>River</span> <span>joins</span> <span>Lake</span> <span>Ontario</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>weather</span> was <span>warm</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>We</span> <span>walked</span> a <span>long</span> way and our <span>feet</span> <span>were</span> hot, so <span>we</span> <span>went</span> <span>down</span> to the <span>edge</span> <span>of</span> the <span>water</span> to put our <span>feet</span> <span>in</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 One toe <span>in</span> was <span>enough</span>! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>water</span> was so <span>cold</span> <span>it</span> <span>made</span> our <span>feet</span> <span>ache</span>! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 A <span>piece</span> <span>of</span> ice <span>drifted</span> <span>beside</span> our <span>feet</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 There are <span>no</span> <span>donut</span> <span>shops</span> where she <span>lives</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There was a <span>choice</span> <span>of</span> <span>20</span> <span>different</span> <span>types</span> <span>of</span> <span>donut:</span> <span>some</span> <span>round</span>, <span>some</span> <span>with</span> <span>holes</span>, <span>some</span> <span>with</span> <span>frosting</span>, <span>some</span> <span>with</span> jam <span>inside--each</span> was <span>different.<br/></span>
