🎧 My parents live in England, and I live in Canada. <br/> 
🎧 I don't see them often. <br/> 
🎧 They used to come and visit on a plane, and we would pick them up at Toronto airport. <br/> 
🎧 But now they are older and say the flight is too long for them.<br/>
🎧 I went to visit them last year, with my son, their grandson. <br/> 
🎧 They live by the ocean, and we could hear the sound of the waves through the bedroom window and see the blue water of the English channel. <br/> 
🎧 There is an island with a castle on top in the bay. <br/> 
🎧 We walked many times on the beach and picked up pebbles and feathers. <br/> 
🎧 We visited the island and walked up the steep hill to the castle.<br/>
🎧 My mother likes to cook. <br/> 
🎧 She makes delicious cakes and pies. <br/> 
🎧 We went for a hike and picked wild blackberries. <br/> 
🎧 She made them into a pie that smelled so good coming out of the oven and tasted so good on our plates. <br/> 
🎧 She has many cook books with recipes from all over the world and likes to try new things. <br/> 
🎧 She can make pastry very easily and rolls it with a rolling pin quickly. <br/> 
🎧 When I tried to make pastry, it sticks to the rolling pin, it has holes at the bottom of the pie, and it tastes like a rock! Her pastry is crisp and tender.<br/>
🎧 My father likes to garden. <br/> 
🎧 He grows lettuce, carrots, potatoes, tomatoes, cucumbers and many flowers. <br/> 
🎧 When my mother was very ill last year, she had to stay in bed. <br/> 
🎧 He planted roses outside her bedroom window, so she could open the curtains and see them. <br/> 
🎧 Their house has small room with windows all around, and they plant seeds there in winter in small pots. <br/> 
🎧 The warmth from the sun makes the seeds grow, and in spring they are a good size to be planted outside.<br/>
🎧 In the house beside them and in the house in front of them, there are older ladies whose husbands have died. <br/> 
🎧 These ladies do not drive, so my father takes my mother and the two ladies to the town for shopping every week. <br/> 
🎧 He helps one find her groceries because she cannot see well. <br/> 
🎧 He helps her take tapes of books from the library so she can listen to books instead of reading them because of her eyes. <br/> 
🎧 He helps them cut their grass and fix anything that is broken in the house.<br/>
🎧 I am very proud of my parents; they are over eighty years old and often hurt when they move around. <br/> 
🎧 But still they help other people, and they help each other. <br/> 
🎧 They have been married for over fifty years, but still my father loves my mother enough to plant roses for her to cheer her up when she was ill

🎧 The planet on which we live is called the Earth. <br/> 
🎧 Our planet is constantly moving around the sun, and each year, the Earth travels all the way around the sun. <br/> 
🎧 But there are many other planets that also travel around the sun. <br/> 
🎧 Together with the sun, the planets, and various other bodies, the Earth is part of our "solar system."<br/> 
🎧 The planet that is closest to the sun is Mercury. <br/> 
🎧 Mercury is extremely hot, and it is much smaller than the Earth. <br/> 
🎧 The second planet from the sun is Venus. <br/> 
🎧 Venus is about the same size as the Earth. <br/> 
🎧 Venus is also very hot.<br/>
🎧 The Earth is the third planet from the sun. <br/> 
🎧 The Earth is unusual among the planets, because it has such a large moon. <br/> 
🎧 The Earth is bigger than the moon, but the moon is still quite large. <br/> 
🎧 It takes about one month for the moon to travel around the Earth.<br/>
🎧 The fourth planet from the sun is Mars. <br/> 
🎧 Mars is known for its red colour. <br/> 
🎧 Mars is smaller and colder than the Earth. <br/> 
🎧 Mars has two very small moons. <br/> 
🎧 After the planet Mars, there are many small bodies called the asteroids. <br/> 
🎧 These rocky objects are much smaller than planets.<br/>
🎧 The first four planets are all made of rock and metal. <br/> 
🎧 The remaining planets, however, are mostly made of frozen gases.<br/>
🎧 The fifth planet is called Jupiter. <br/> 
🎧 Jupiter is the largest planet. <br/> 
🎧 It has many moons that travel around it, and it also has a large red spot. <br/> 
🎧 The sixth planet is called Saturn. <br/> 
🎧 Saturn is the second-largest planet, and it is famous for the wide "rings" that surround it. <br/> 
🎧 These rings are made up of many smaller objects that are found in the same area.<br/>
🎧 The seventh planet is called Uranus. <br/> 
🎧 The eighth planet is called Neptune. <br/> 
🎧 These planets are also gas giants, but they are smaller than Jupiter and Saturn. <br/> 
🎧 Both Uranus and Neptune are so far from the sun that scientists only discovered these planets during the past few hundred years, using telescopes. <br/> 
🎧 The other planets had all been visible to curious people for many thousands of years. <br/> 
🎧 The ninth planet is called Pluto. <br/> 
🎧 Pluto is very small, and it is much more rocky than the gas giants. <br/> 
🎧 Some scientists believe that Pluto is not really a planet at all. <br/> 
🎧 They suggest that Pluto is the largest of many asteroids that are found at the edge of the solar system.<br/>
🎧 The solar system is a vast place. <br/> 
🎧 So far, people have not travelled beyond the moon. <br/> 
🎧 But perhaps someday, human astronauts will visit the other planets of our solar system

🎧 Each year, many young people learn to drive a car. <br/> 
🎧 For many people, learning to drive is important because the car is an important method of transportation in many places.<br/>
🎧 Before learning to drive a car, it is important to understand the rules of the road. <br/> 
🎧 A beginning driver should already understand the many signs that are found along the roads. <br/> 
🎧 Also, the student driver should know the many rules about changing lanes, turning, stopping, and many other aspects of driving. <br/> 
🎧 In addition, the driver should be familiar with the way the car is operated; it is important to know how to use the lights, signals, brakes, accelerator, and steering wheel.<br/>
🎧 When a person starts learning to drive, it may take some time to become skilful. <br/> 
🎧 It takes some practice to become an expert in driving a car. <br/> 
🎧 One must become familiar with steering, speeding up, and slowing down. <br/> 
🎧 At first, it is good to practice driving in a large open space, such as an empty parking lot. <br/> 
🎧 Here, one can practice without being a danger to anyone.<br/>
🎧 When a person gains some skill in driving, it is then safe enough to practice driving on a road. <br/> 
🎧 Of course, a student driver must still be very careful. <br/> 
🎧 He or she should always have an expert driver in the car with him or her. <br/> 
🎧 Many beginning drivers take driving lessons from professional instructors, who can teach safe driving techniques.<br/>
🎧 Eventually, the young driver is ready for a driving test, which is needed to obtain a regular driver's licence. <br/> 
🎧 This test is supervised by a government official. <br/> 
🎧 In the driving test, the driver must show that he or she can control the car with great skill by being able to make turns and to park the car in small spaces. <br/> 
🎧 But he or she must also show respect for the rules of the road by driving at a proper speed, and obeying all traffic signs and signals.<br/>
🎧 Of course, even when one has obtained a driver's licence, it is always important to drive carefully and responsibly

🎧 Snow is the white substance that falls to the ground during cold weather conditions.<br/>
🎧 Each tiny piece of snow, called a snowflake, is a very small amount of water that has frozen into an unusual shape. <br/> 
🎧 During the winter months, huge numbers of snowflakes fall to the ground, covering the land in a white blanket of snow.<br/>
🎧 In many parts of the world, people never see any snow. <br/> 
🎧 Snow only falls when there is moisture in the air, and when the temperature falls below the freezing point of water, which is zero degrees Celsius. <br/> 
🎧 During the winter, snow falls instead of rain.<br/>
🎧 One advantage of snow is that it allows many fun outdoor activities. <br/> 
🎧 Children like to play in the snow. <br/> 
🎧 For example, they may make a "snowman" by rolling snow into a large ball, and then placing these balls of snow on top of each other, in the shape of a person. <br/> 
🎧 Another fun activity in the snow is skiing. <br/> 
🎧 Skis are very long, thin, flat pieces of hard material that one wears on one's feet. <br/> 
🎧 Wearing skis allows a person to slide along the surface of the snow. <br/> 
🎧 People can ski down the side of a hill, travelling at great speeds.<br/>
🎧 Many people find the sport of downhill skiing to be very exciting. <br/> 
🎧 Some people like to ski along flat ground, often travelling great distances. <br/> 
🎧 This sport, called cross-country skiing, is an excellent way to develop physical fitness.<br/>
🎧 Of course, snow also causes some problems. <br/> 
🎧 Snow can make driving dangerous because falling snow makes roads slippery, and on a windy day, blowing snow can make it difficult to see very far. <br/> 
🎧 It can also be a lot of work to remove snow from the roads and sidewalks. <br/> 
🎧 Snow is a heavy substance, and it must be cleared away using a shovel or a large machine.<br/>
🎧 Many people love the beauty of the land when it is covered by snow. <br/> 
🎧 The white covering of snow over the fields and trees can give a feeling of peace and calm. <br/> 
🎧 If you have never seen snow before, you should someday experience this strange and wonderful substance

🎧 In most Western countries, Christmas is the biggest holiday of the year. <br/> 
🎧 People gather with their families to celebrate this day, which occurs on December 25th each year.<br/>
🎧 The holiday of Christmas celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ. <br/> 
🎧 In the Christian religion, Jesus Christ is recognized as the Son of God. <br/> 
🎧 During the Christmas season, many people celebrate the events of the birth of Jesus Christ. <br/> 
🎧 For example, they recall the three wise men who visited Jesus Christ shortly after his birth. <br/> 
🎧 Also, they recall that Jesus Christ was born in a manger (a place where horses are kept), because his parents could not find a place to stay.<br/>
🎧 In Western countries, Christmas is also celebrated by many people who are not religious.<br/>
🎧 People view Christmas as a time for being together with one's relatives. <br/> 
🎧 Children, parents, and grandparents gather to exchange presents and to eat special foods.<br/>
🎧 The tradition of giving gifts at Christmas is unusual in one way. <br/> 
🎧 When children go to bed on the evening before Christmas, they hang large socks (called stockings) in their house.<br/>
🎧 When they wake up on Christmas morning, the stockings have been filled with toys and candy.<br/>
🎧 According to tradition, the presents have been given by a fat man who wears a white beard and a red suit. <br/> 
🎧 This man, called Santa Claus, flies around the world in a sled that is pulled by reindeer. <br/> 
🎧 He stops at each house and flies down the chimney to deliver his presents. <br/> 
🎧 In the weeks before Christmas, children are usually very well behaved. <br/> 
🎧 Their parents tell them that Santa Claus will only give presents to children who are good!<br/> 
🎧 Another Christmas tradition is the Christmas tree. <br/> 
🎧 People put a small tree inside their house and decorate it with various pretty objects. <br/> 
🎧 Nowadays, most people use an artificial tree instead of a real tree. <br/> 
🎧 The tradition of the Christmas tree is actually older than Christmas itself-the people of Europe celebrated the beginning of the winter season in this way even before Christianity reached Europe.<br/>
🎧 Christmas is certainly one of the most important and most enjoyed holidays in Western countries

🎧 An important holiday in North America is held during the fall, or autumn, season of the year. <br/> 
🎧 This holiday is called Thanksgiving. <br/> 
🎧 At this time of year, people join with their relatives to reflect upon their good fortune.<br/>
🎧 Thanksgiving is a holiday that has a long history in North America. <br/> 
🎧 It was first celebrated when English settlers arrived in the eastern part of what is now the United States, during the seventeenth century. <br/> 
🎧 When they survived the first hard year, they celebrated and gave thanks to God. <br/> 
🎧 They invited some of the Native people to their Thanksgiving celebration, because the Native people had helped them to survive during the hard winter.<br/>
🎧 The tradition of celebrating Thanksgiving continued and spread throughout North America. <br/> 
🎧 Each fall, during the time of the autumn harvest, people celebrated Thanksgiving. <br/> 
🎧 They gave thanks for the food of the harvest, and for all the good things in their lives.<br/>
🎧 Today, the tradition of Thanksgiving celebration continues. <br/> 
🎧 Families gather to eat a large bird called a turkey. <br/> 
🎧 They also eat pumpkin pie. <br/> 
🎧 This is a sweet dessert that is made from a large orange vegetable that grows on the ground.<br/>
🎧 In the United States, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. <br/> 
🎧 But the following day, Friday, is also a holiday, and then comes the weekend. <br/> 
🎧 In Canada, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the second Monday of October. <br/> 
🎧 The reason for the earlier celebration in Canada is that the weather is colder than in the United States. <br/> 
🎧 This means that the harvest happens earlier in Canada, so Thanksgiving is held at an earlier date. <br/> 
🎧 But in both countries, Thanksgiving is a very pleasant time of year

🎧 The holiday called Halloween is celebrated on October 31st of each year. <br/> 
🎧 Halloween is not an official holiday. <br/> 
🎧 Everyone goes to work or to school on Halloween, just as on any other day. <br/> 
🎧 But Halloween is still one of the holidays that children like the most.<br/>
🎧 Why do children like Halloween so much? There are two reasons: costumes and candy.<br/>
🎧 On the evening of October 31st, children dress up in strange and unusual costumes.<br/>
🎧 They wear costumes that may look like a witch, a monster, or many other weird things.<br/>
🎧 Putting on these scary costumes is a lot of fun for children.<br/>
🎧 After the children put on their costumes, they walk from house to house during the evening. <br/> 
🎧 The children carry large bags with them. <br/> 
🎧 At each house, they stop and knock at the door. <br/> 
🎧 When an adult opens the door, the children shout "trick or treat." The adult who opens the door pretends to be frightened, and then puts pieces of candy into each child's open bag.<br/>
🎧 At the end of the evening, the children have visited many houses and have collected much candy. <br/> 
🎧 During the next several days, they can feast upon the sweet candies that they have received.<br/>
🎧 Another Halloween tradition is very unusual. <br/> 
🎧 In each house, a family gets a very large, round orange vegetable called a pumpkin. <br/> 
🎧 They cut a hole in the top of the pumpkin, and empty out the flesh and seeds of the vegetable. <br/> 
🎧 Then, they cut holes in the side of the pumpkin, so that it appears to have eyes, a nose, and a mouth. <br/> 
🎧 When the carving is finished, the pumpkin looks almost like a person's face!<br/> 
🎧 When the pumpkin has been carved to look like a face, people place a light inside the pumpkin, so that the vegetable seems to glow in the dark. <br/> 
🎧 This strange-looking face is called a "jack-o-lantern." On Halloween evening, one can see many of these jack-olanterns, some of which are very beautifully carved.<br/>
🎧 Halloween is truly a fun and interesting holiday, especially for children

🎧 Traditionally, Easter has been one of the most important holidays of the Christian religion.<br/>
🎧 For Christians, the Easter holiday celebrates the death of Jesus Christ, who died for the benefit of all people. <br/> 
🎧 The exact date when Easter is celebrated is different each year, but it is always held in early spring, during March or April.<br/>
🎧 There are two very important days that make up the Easter holiday, which occurs during the spring season. <br/> 
🎧 The first of these days is called Good Friday. <br/> 
🎧 Christians recognize Good Friday as the day when Jesus suffered and died on behalf of humanity.<br/>
🎧 The second of these days is called Easter Sunday. <br/> 
🎧 Easter Sunday occurs two days after Good Friday. <br/> 
🎧 Christians celebrate Easter Sunday as the day when Jesus rose from the dead and went to Heaven. <br/> 
🎧 For Christians, Easter is the most solemn holiday of the year.<br/>
🎧 Many people attend church services on Good Friday and on Easter Sunday.<br/>
🎧 Easter is also a time for celebration. <br/> 
🎧 Some Easter traditions come from old springtime festivals that existed even before Christianity. <br/> 
🎧 One of the traditions associated with Easter is the painting of Easter eggs. <br/> 
🎧 People take chickens' eggs, make them hollow, and then paint them with beautiful colours. <br/> 
🎧 Some people paint very beautiful and complex designs on the Easter eggs.<br/>
🎧 Another Easter tradition is the Easter Bunny. <br/> 
🎧 According to tradition, the Easter Bunny is a magical rabbit that visits the homes of children on the night before Easter Sunday. <br/> 
🎧 The Easter Bunny hides chocolate candies, shaped like eggs, throughout the child's house.<br/>
🎧 On the morning of Easter Sunday, the children must search throughout the house, to find these many hidden treats!<br/> 
🎧 The Easter holiday is an important time, both as a religious holiday and as a celebration of springtime

🎧 Two of my best friends are named John and Jane. <br/> 
🎧 John and Jane are related to each other. <br/> 
🎧 In fact, they are brother and sister. <br/> 
🎧 Not only are they brother and sister, but they are also twins. <br/> 
🎧 Their mother gave birth to them only a few minutes apart.<br/>
🎧 I first met John and Jane when we were only five years old. <br/> 
🎧 We went to kindergarten classes at the same school. <br/> 
🎧 Because the house where John and Jane lived was close to my family's house, I often walked to school with John and Jane.<br/>
🎧 When we weren't at school, John and Jane and I often played together. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes, we would play sports and games. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes, we would play in the forest, looking for birds and animals. <br/> 
🎧 On rainy days, we would stay inside, and play with toys and dolls. <br/> 
🎧 On warm summer days, we would go swimming in the lake that was near the place where we lived.<br/>
🎧 I often visited John and Jane at their house. <br/> 
🎧 On many occasions, I had lunch at their place. <br/> 
🎧 John and Jane's parents were very nice to me. <br/> 
🎧 Of course, John and Jane often visited my house too. <br/> 
🎧 My parents enjoyed it when John and Jane came over for lunch. <br/> 
🎧 When I became older, I remained friends with John and Jane. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes, we would study or do our school homework together. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes, we worked at the same part-time jobs, to make extra money. <br/> 
🎧 We often helped each other in various ways. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes, I did a favour to help John or Jane, and sometimes they did favours to help me.<br/>
🎧 Eventually, when we grew up, I moved to a different town. <br/> 
🎧 Both John and Jane also moved to different places. <br/> 
🎧 But I am still good friends with John and Jane. <br/> 
🎧 Two years ago, I went to Jane's wedding, and last year, I went to John's wedding. <br/> 
🎧 I think I will probably always be friends with John and Jane.<br/>
🎧 Having friends is very nice. <br/>

🎧 Hobbies are activities that people do in their spare time, for the sake of enjoyment. <br/> 
🎧 A hobby usually involves work of some kind, but the work is fun for the person who does it.<br/>
🎧 Some people enjoy their hobbies very much and like to spend much time on those hobbies.<br/>
🎧 There are many different hobbies that people enjoy. <br/> 
🎧 One of the most popular hobbies is gardening. <br/> 
🎧 Many people enjoy growing beautiful flowers or tasty vegetables in a garden near their house or apartment. <br/> 
🎧 People who have a garden enjoy seeing the results of their work, when flowers show their bright, beautiful colours. <br/> 
🎧 But gardeners also enjoy the tasks of gardening itself. <br/> 
🎧 They like to work in the soil, planting and watering their flowers.<br/>
🎧 Another popular hobby is photography. <br/> 
🎧 Some people enjoy taking pictures of the people and places around them. <br/> 
🎧 People who enjoy photography may sometimes buy expensive cameras that allow interesting photographs to be taken. <br/> 
🎧 But even people who have only a basic camera can still take beautiful pictures.<br/>
🎧 For many people, car repair is a favourite hobby. <br/> 
🎧 Some people enjoy looking at the engine and other parts of their cars. <br/> 
🎧 those people make repairs or improvements to their cars. <br/> 
🎧 Of course, this is a useful hobby, but many people enjoy "fixing up" a car simply because they enjoy working with cars.<br/>
🎧 Some people collect objects as a hobby. <br/> 
🎧 For example, some people collect postage stamps, and some people collect coins. <br/> 
🎧 It can be very satisfying to find the missing parts of one's collection, especially when the stamps or coins are very rare.<br/>
🎧 Of course, these are just a few of the many hobbies that people enjoy. <br/>
