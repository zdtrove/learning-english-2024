🎧 But now <span>they</span> are <span>older</span> and say the <span>flight</span> <span>is</span> too <span>long</span> for <span>them</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>went</span> to <span>visit</span> <span>them</span> <span>last</span> <span>year</span>, <span>with</span> my son, <span>their</span> <span>grandson</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>They</span> <span>live</span> by the <span>ocean</span>, and <span>we</span> <span>could</span> <span>hear</span> the <span>sound</span> <span>of</span> the <span>waves</span> <span>through</span> the <span>bedroom</span> <span>window</span> and see the <span>blue</span> <span>water</span> <span>of</span> the <span>English</span> <span>channel</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There <span>is</span> an <span>island</span> <span>with</span> a <span>castle</span> <span>on</span> top <span>in</span> the bay. <span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>We</span> <span>visited</span> the <span>island</span> and <span>walked</span> <span>up</span> the <span>steep</span> <span>hill</span> to the <span>castle</span>.<br/>

🎧 She has <span>many</span> <span>cook</span> <span>books</span> <span>with</span> <span>recipes</span> <span>from</span> all <span>over</span> the <span>world</span> and <span>likes</span> to try new <span>things</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She can <span>make</span> <span>pastry</span> <span>very</span> <span>easily</span> and <span>rolls</span> <span>it</span> <span>with</span> a <span>rolling</span> pin <span>quickly</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 When I <span>tried</span> to <span>make</span> <span>pastry</span>, <span>it</span> <span>sticks</span> to the <span>rolling</span> pin, <span>it</span> has <span>holes</span> <span>at</span> the <span>bottom</span> <span>of</span> the pie, and <span>it</span> <span>tastes</span> <span>like</span> a <span>rock</span>!

🎧 The <span>warmth</span> <span>from</span> the sun <span>makes</span> the <span>seeds</span> <span>grow</span>, and <span>in</span> <span>spring</span> <span>they</span> are a <span>good</span> <span>size</span> to be <span>planted</span> <span>outside</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>In</span> the <span>house</span> <span>beside</span> <span>them</span> and <span>in</span> the <span>house</span> <span>in</span> <span>front</span> <span>of</span> <span>them</span>, there are <span>older</span> <span>ladies</span> whose <span>husbands</span> have <span>died</span>. <span><br/></span>
