🎧 My <span>parents</span> live in <span>England</span>, and I live in <span>Canada</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I don't see them often. <br/> 
🎧 They used to come and visit on a <span>plane</span>, and we would <span>pick</span> them up at <span>Toronto</span> <span>airport</span>. <br/> 
🎧 But now they are <span>older</span> and say the <span>flight</span> is too long for them.<br/>
🎧 I went to visit them last year, with my son, their <span>grandson</span>. <br/> 
🎧 They live by the <span>ocean</span>, and we could hear the sound of the <span>waves</span> through the <span>bedroom</span> <span>window</span> and see the <span>blue</span> water of the English <span>channel</span>. <br/> 
🎧 There is an <span>island</span> with a <span>castle</span> on top in the bay. <br/> 
🎧 We <span>walked</span> many <span>times</span> on the <span>beach</span> and <span>picked</span> up <span>pebbles</span> and <span>feathers</span>. <br/> 
🎧 We <span>visited</span> the <span>island</span> and <span>walked</span> up the <span>steep</span> <span>hill</span> to the <span>castle</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mother</span> <span>likes</span> to <span>cook</span>. <br/> 
🎧 She makes <span>delicious</span> <span>cakes</span> and <span>pies</span>. <br/> 
🎧 We went for a <span>hike</span> and <span>picked</span> <span>wild</span> <span>blackberries</span>. <br/> 
🎧 She made them into a pie that <span>smelled</span> so good <span>coming</span> out of the <span>oven</span> and <span>tasted</span> so good on our <span>plates</span>. <br/> 
🎧 She has many <span>cook</span> <span>books</span> with <span>recipes</span> from all over the <span>world</span> and <span>likes</span> to try new things. <br/> 
🎧 She can make <span>pastry</span> very <span>easily</span> and <span>rolls</span> it with a <span>rolling</span> pin quickly. <br/> 
🎧 When I <span>tried</span> to make <span>pastry</span>, it <span>sticks</span> to the <span>rolling</span> pin, it has <span>holes</span> at the <span>bottom</span> of the pie, and it <span>tastes</span> like a <span>rock</span>! Her <span>pastry</span> is <span>crisp</span> and <span>tender</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>father</span> <span>likes</span> to <span>garden</span>. <br/> 
🎧 He <span>grows</span> <span>lettuce</span>, <span>carrots</span>, <span>potatoes</span>, <span>tomatoes</span>, <span>cucumbers</span> and many <span>flowers</span>. <br/> 
🎧 When my <span>mother</span> was very ill last year, she had to <span>stay</span> in bed. <br/> 
🎧 He <span>planted</span> <span>roses</span> outside her <span>bedroom</span> <span>window</span>, so she could <span>open</span> the <span>curtains</span> and see them. <br/> 
🎧 Their house has small <span>room</span> with <span>windows</span> all around, and they <span>plant</span> <span>seeds</span> there in <span>winter</span> in small <span>pots</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>warmth</span> from the sun makes the <span>seeds</span> <span>grow</span>, and in <span>spring</span> they are a good size to be <span>planted</span> outside.<br/>
🎧 In the house <span>beside</span> them and in the house in <span>front</span> of them, there are <span>older</span> <span>ladies</span> whose <span>husbands</span> have <span>died</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>These</span> <span>ladies</span> do not drive, so my <span>father</span> takes my <span>mother</span> and the two <span>ladies</span> to the <span>town</span> for <span>shopping</span> every week. <br/> 
🎧 He helps one find her <span>groceries</span> because she <span>cannot</span> see well. <br/> 
🎧 He helps her take <span>tapes</span> of <span>books</span> from the <span>library</span> so she can listen to <span>books</span> <span>instead</span> of <span>reading</span> them because of her <span>eyes</span>. <br/> 
🎧 He helps them cut their <span>grass</span> and fix anything that is <span>broken</span> in the house.<br/>
🎧 I am very <span>proud</span> of my <span>parents;</span> they are over <span>eighty</span> years old and often <span>hurt</span> when they move around. <br/> 
🎧 But still they help other people, and they help each other. <br/> 
🎧 They have been <span>married</span> for over <span>fifty</span> years, but still my <span>father</span> <span>loves</span> my <span>mother</span> enough to <span>plant</span> <span>roses</span> for her to <span>cheer</span> her up when she was <span>ill.<br/>

🎧 The <span>planet</span> on which we live is <span>called</span> the <span>Earth</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Our <span>planet</span> is <span>constantly</span> <span>moving</span> around the sun, and each year, the <span>Earth</span> <span>travels</span> all the way around the sun. <br/> 
🎧 But there are many other <span>planets</span> that also travel around the sun. <br/> 
🎧 Together with the sun, the <span>planets</span>, and <span>various</span> other <span>bodies</span>, the <span>Earth</span> is <span>part</span> of our <span>"solar</span> <span>system."<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>planet</span> that is <span>closest</span> to the sun is <span>Mercury</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Mercury</span> is <span>extremely</span> hot, and it is much <span>smaller</span> than the <span>Earth</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>second</span> <span>planet</span> from the sun is <span>Venus</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Venus</span> is about the same size as the <span>Earth</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Venus</span> is also very <span>hot</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Earth</span> is the <span>third</span> <span>planet</span> from the sun. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>Earth</span> is <span>unusual</span> <span>among</span> the <span>planets</span>, because it has such a <span>large</span> <span>moon</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>Earth</span> is <span>bigger</span> than the <span>moon</span>, but the <span>moon</span> is still quite <span>large</span>. <br/> 
🎧 It takes about one <span>month</span> for the <span>moon</span> to travel around the <span>Earth</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>fourth</span> <span>planet</span> from the sun is <span>Mars</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Mars</span> is <span>known</span> for its red <span>colour</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Mars</span> is <span>smaller</span> and <span>colder</span> than the <span>Earth</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Mars</span> has two very small <span>moons</span>. <br/> 
🎧 After the <span>planet</span> <span>Mars</span>, there are many small <span>bodies</span> <span>called</span> the <span>asteroids</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>These</span> <span>rocky</span> <span>objects</span> are much <span>smaller</span> than <span>planets</span>.<br/>
🎧 The first <span>four</span> <span>planets</span> are all made of <span>rock</span> and <span>metal</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>remaining</span> <span>planets</span>, <span>however</span>, are <span>mostly</span> made of <span>frozen</span> <span>gases</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>fifth</span> <span>planet</span> is <span>called</span> <span>Jupiter</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Jupiter</span> is the <span>largest</span> <span>planet</span>. <br/> 
🎧 It has many <span>moons</span> that travel around it, and it also has a <span>large</span> red <span>spot</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>sixth</span> <span>planet</span> is <span>called</span> <span>Saturn</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Saturn</span> is the <span>second-largest</span> <span>planet</span>, and it is famous for the <span>wide</span> <span>"rings"</span> that <span>surround</span> it. <br/> 
🎧 <span>These</span> <span>rings</span> are made up of many <span>smaller</span> <span>objects</span> that are <span>found</span> in the same <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>seventh</span> <span>planet</span> is <span>called</span> <span>Uranus</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>eighth</span> <span>planet</span> is <span>called</span> <span>Neptune</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>These</span> <span>planets</span> are also gas <span>giants</span>, but they are <span>smaller</span> than <span>Jupiter</span> and <span>Saturn</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Both <span>Uranus</span> and <span>Neptune</span> are so far from the sun that <span>scientists</span> only <span>discovered</span> these <span>planets</span> during the <span>past</span> few <span>hundred</span> years, <span>using</span> <span>telescopes</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The other <span>planets</span> had all been <span>visible</span> to <span>curious</span> people for many <span>thousands</span> of years. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>ninth</span> <span>planet</span> is <span>called</span> <span>Pluto</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Pluto</span> is very small, and it is much more <span>rocky</span> than the gas <span>giants</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Some <span>scientists</span> <span>believe</span> that <span>Pluto</span> is not really a <span>planet</span> at all. <br/> 
🎧 They <span>suggest</span> that <span>Pluto</span> is the <span>largest</span> of many <span>asteroids</span> that are <span>found</span> at the <span>edge</span> of the <span>solar</span> <span>system</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>solar</span> <span>system</span> is a <span>vast</span> place. <br/> 
🎧 So far, people have not <span>travelled</span> <span>beyond</span> the <span>moon</span>. <br/> 
🎧 But <span>perhaps</span> <span>someday</span>, <span>human</span> <span>astronauts</span> will visit the other <span>planets</span> of our <span>solar</span> <span>system!<br/>

🎧 <span>Each</span> year, many young people learn to drive a car. <br/> 
🎧 For many people, <span>learning</span> to drive is <span>important</span> because the car is an <span>important</span> <span>method</span> of <span>transportation</span> in many <span>places</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Before</span> <span>learning</span> to drive a car, it is <span>important</span> to <span>understand</span> the <span>rules</span> of the <span>road</span>. <br/> 
🎧 A <span>beginning</span> <span>driver</span> should <span>already</span> <span>understand</span> the many <span>signs</span> that are <span>found</span> along the <span>roads</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Also, the <span>student</span> <span>driver</span> should know the many <span>rules</span> about <span>changing</span> <span>lanes</span>, <span>turning</span>, <span>stopping</span>, and many other <span>aspects</span> of driving. <br/> 
🎧 In <span>addition</span>, the <span>driver</span> should be <span>familiar</span> with the way the car is <span>operated;</span> it is <span>important</span> to know how to use the <span>lights</span>, <span>signals</span>, <span>brakes</span>, <span>accelerator</span>, and <span>steering</span> <span>wheel</span>.<br/>
🎧 When a person <span>starts</span> <span>learning</span> to drive, it may take some time to become <span>skilful</span>. <br/> 
🎧 It takes some <span>practice</span> to become an <span>expert</span> in driving a car. <br/> 
🎧 One <span>must</span> become <span>familiar</span> with <span>steering</span>, <span>speeding</span> up, and <span>slowing</span> down. <br/> 
🎧 <span>At</span> first, it is good to <span>practice</span> driving in a <span>large</span> <span>open</span> <span>space</span>, such as an <span>empty</span> <span>parking</span> lot. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Here</span>, one can <span>practice</span> without being a <span>danger</span> to <span>anyone</span>.<br/>
🎧 When a person <span>gains</span> some <span>skill</span> in driving, it is then <span>safe</span> enough to <span>practice</span> driving on a <span>road</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Of course, a <span>student</span> <span>driver</span> <span>must</span> still be very <span>careful</span>. <br/> 
🎧 He or she should always have an <span>expert</span> <span>driver</span> in the car with him or her. <br/> 
🎧 Many <span>beginning</span> <span>drivers</span> take driving <span>lessons</span> from <span>professional</span> <span>instructors</span>, who can <span>teach</span> <span>safe</span> driving <span>techniques</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Eventually</span>, the young <span>driver</span> is <span>ready</span> for a driving <span>test</span>, which is <span>needed</span> to <span>obtain</span> a <span>regular</span> <span>driver's</span> <span>licence</span>. <br/> 
🎧 This <span>test</span> is <span>supervised</span> by a <span>government</span> <span>official</span>. <br/> 
🎧 In the driving <span>test</span>, the <span>driver</span> <span>must</span> <span>show</span> that he or she can <span>control</span> the car with great <span>skill</span> by being able to make <span>turns</span> and to <span>park</span> the car in small <span>spaces</span>. <br/> 
🎧 But he or she <span>must</span> also <span>show</span> <span>respect</span> for the <span>rules</span> of the <span>road</span> by driving at a <span>proper</span> <span>speed</span>, and <span>obeying</span> all <span>traffic</span> <span>signs</span> and <span>signals</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course, even when one has <span>obtained</span> a <span>driver's</span> <span>licence</span>, it is always <span>important</span> to drive <span>carefully</span> and <span>responsibly!<br/>

🎧 <span>Snow</span> is the <span>white</span> <span>substance</span> that <span>falls</span> to the <span>ground</span> during <span>cold</span> <span>weather</span> <span>conditions</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Each</span> <span>tiny</span> <span>piece</span> of <span>snow</span>, <span>called</span> a <span>snowflake</span>, is a very small <span>amount</span> of water that has <span>frozen</span> into an <span>unusual</span> <span>shape</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>During</span> the <span>winter</span> <span>months</span>, <span>huge</span> <span>numbers</span> of <span>snowflakes</span> <span>fall</span> to the <span>ground</span>, <span>covering</span> the <span>land</span> in a <span>white</span> <span>blanket</span> of <span>snow</span>.<br/>
🎧 In many <span>parts</span> of the <span>world</span>, people never see any <span>snow</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Snow</span> only <span>falls</span> when there is <span>moisture</span> in the air, and when the <span>temperature</span> <span>falls</span> <span>below</span> the <span>freezing</span> <span>point</span> of water, which is <span>zero</span> <span>degrees</span> <span>Celsius</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>During</span> the <span>winter</span>, <span>snow</span> <span>falls</span> <span>instead</span> of <span>rain</span>.<br/>
🎧 One <span>advantage</span> of <span>snow</span> is that it <span>allows</span> many fun <span>outdoor</span> <span>activities</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Children</span> like to play in the <span>snow</span>. <br/> 
🎧 For example, they may make a <span>"snowman"</span> by <span>rolling</span> <span>snow</span> into a <span>large</span> <span>ball</span>, and then <span>placing</span> these <span>balls</span> of <span>snow</span> on top of each other, in the <span>shape</span> of a person. <br/> 
🎧 Another fun <span>activity</span> in the <span>snow</span> is <span>skiing</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Skis</span> are very long, <span>thin</span>, <span>flat</span> <span>pieces</span> of <span>hard</span> <span>material</span> that one <span>wears</span> on <span>one's</span> <span>feet</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Wearing</span> <span>skis</span> <span>allows</span> a person to <span>slide</span> along the <span>surface</span> of the <span>snow</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>People</span> can ski down the side of a <span>hill</span>, <span>travelling</span> at great <span>speeds</span>.<br/>
🎧 Many people find the <span>sport</span> of <span>downhill</span> <span>skiing</span> to be very <span>exciting</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Some people like to ski along <span>flat</span> <span>ground</span>, often <span>travelling</span> great <span>distances</span>. <br/> 
🎧 This <span>sport</span>, <span>called</span> <span>cross-country</span> <span>skiing</span>, is an <span>excellent</span> way to <span>develop</span> <span>physical</span> <span>fitness</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course, <span>snow</span> also <span>causes</span> some <span>problems</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Snow</span> can make driving <span>dangerous</span> because <span>falling</span> <span>snow</span> makes <span>roads</span> <span>slippery</span>, and on a <span>windy</span> day, <span>blowing</span> <span>snow</span> can make it <span>difficult</span> to see very far. <br/> 
🎧 It can also be a lot of work to <span>remove</span> <span>snow</span> from the <span>roads</span> and <span>sidewalks</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Snow</span> is a <span>heavy</span> <span>substance</span>, and it <span>must</span> be <span>cleared</span> away <span>using</span> a <span>shovel</span> or a <span>large</span> <span>machine</span>.<br/>
🎧 Many people love the <span>beauty</span> of the <span>land</span> when it is <span>covered</span> by <span>snow</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>white</span> <span>covering</span> of <span>snow</span> over the <span>fields</span> and <span>trees</span> can give a feeling of <span>peace</span> and <span>calm</span>. <br/> 
🎧 If you have never <span>seen</span> <span>snow</span> before, you should <span>someday</span> <span>experience</span> this <span>strange</span> and <span>wonderful</span> <span>substance!<br/>

🎧 In most <span>Western</span> <span>countries</span>, <span>Christmas</span> is the <span>biggest</span> <span>holiday</span> of the year. <br/> 
🎧 <span>People</span> <span>gather</span> with their <span>families</span> to <span>celebrate</span> this day, which <span>occurs</span> on <span>December</span> <span>25th</span> each year.<br/>
🎧 The <span>holiday</span> of <span>Christmas</span> <span>celebrates</span> the <span>birth</span> of <span>Jesus</span> <span>Christ</span>. <br/> 
🎧 In the <span>Christian</span> <span>religion</span>, <span>Jesus</span> <span>Christ</span> is <span>recognized</span> as the Son of <span>God</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>During</span> the <span>Christmas</span> <span>season</span>, many people <span>celebrate</span> the <span>events</span> of the <span>birth</span> of <span>Jesus</span> <span>Christ</span>. <br/> 
🎧 For example, they <span>recall</span> the <span>three</span> <span>wise</span> men who <span>visited</span> <span>Jesus</span> <span>Christ</span> <span>shortly</span> after his <span>birth</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Also, they <span>recall</span> that <span>Jesus</span> <span>Christ</span> was <span>born</span> in a <span>manger</span> <span>(a</span> place where <span>horses</span> are <span>kept)</span>, because his <span>parents</span> could not find a place to <span>stay</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>Western</span> <span>countries</span>, <span>Christmas</span> is also <span>celebrated</span> by many people who are not <span>religious</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>People</span> <span>view</span> <span>Christmas</span> as a time for being together with <span>one's</span> <span>relatives</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Children</span>, <span>parents</span>, and <span>grandparents</span> <span>gather</span> to <span>exchange</span> <span>presents</span> and to eat special <span>foods</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>tradition</span> of <span>giving</span> <span>gifts</span> at <span>Christmas</span> is <span>unusual</span> in one way. <br/> 
🎧 When <span>children</span> go to bed on the <span>evening</span> before <span>Christmas</span>, they <span>hang</span> <span>large</span> <span>socks</span> <span>(called</span> <span>stockings)</span> in their house.<br/>
🎧 When they <span>wake</span> up on <span>Christmas</span> morning, the <span>stockings</span> have been <span>filled</span> with <span>toys</span> and <span>candy</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>According</span> to <span>tradition</span>, the <span>presents</span> have been <span>given</span> by a fat man who <span>wears</span> a <span>white</span> <span>beard</span> and a red <span>suit</span>. <br/> 
🎧 This man, <span>called</span> <span>Santa</span> <span>Claus</span>, <span>flies</span> around the <span>world</span> in a <span>sled</span> that is <span>pulled</span> by <span>reindeer</span>. <br/> 
🎧 He <span>stops</span> at each house and <span>flies</span> down the <span>chimney</span> to <span>deliver</span> his <span>presents</span>. <br/> 
🎧 In the <span>weeks</span> before <span>Christmas</span>, <span>children</span> are usually very well <span>behaved</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Their <span>parents</span> tell them that <span>Santa</span> <span>Claus</span> will only give <span>presents</span> to <span>children</span> who are <span>good!<br/></span> 
🎧 Another <span>Christmas</span> <span>tradition</span> is the <span>Christmas</span> <span>tree</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>People</span> put a small <span>tree</span> inside their house and <span>decorate</span> it with <span>various</span> <span>pretty</span> <span>objects</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Nowadays</span>, most people use an <span>artificial</span> <span>tree</span> <span>instead</span> of a <span>real</span> <span>tree</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>tradition</span> of the <span>Christmas</span> <span>tree</span> is <span>actually</span> <span>older</span> than <span>Christmas</span> <span>itself-the</span> people of <span>Europe</span> <span>celebrated</span> the <span>beginning</span> of the <span>winter</span> <span>season</span> in this way even before <span>Christianity</span> <span>reached</span> <span>Europe</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Christmas</span> is <span>certainly</span> one of the most <span>important</span> and most <span>enjoyed</span> <span>holidays</span> in <span>Western</span> <span>countries.<br/>

🎧 An <span>important</span> <span>holiday</span> in <span>North</span> <span>America</span> is <span>held</span> during the <span>fall</span>, or <span>autumn</span>, <span>season</span> of the year. <br/> 
🎧 This <span>holiday</span> is <span>called</span> <span>Thanksgiving</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>At</span> this time of year, people join with their <span>relatives</span> to <span>reflect</span> <span>upon</span> their good <span>fortune</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Thanksgiving</span> is a <span>holiday</span> that has a long <span>history</span> in <span>North</span> <span>America</span>. <br/> 
🎧 It was first <span>celebrated</span> when English <span>settlers</span> <span>arrived</span> in the <span>eastern</span> <span>part</span> of what is now the <span>United</span> <span>States</span>, during the <span>seventeenth</span> <span>century</span>. <br/> 
🎧 When they <span>survived</span> the first <span>hard</span> year, they <span>celebrated</span> and gave thanks to <span>God</span>. <br/> 
🎧 They <span>invited</span> some of the <span>Native</span> people to their <span>Thanksgiving</span> <span>celebration</span>, because the <span>Native</span> people had <span>helped</span> them to <span>survive</span> during the <span>hard</span> <span>winter</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>tradition</span> of <span>celebrating</span> <span>Thanksgiving</span> <span>continued</span> and <span>spread</span> <span>throughout</span> <span>North</span> <span>America</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Each</span> <span>fall</span>, during the time of the <span>autumn</span> <span>harvest</span>, people <span>celebrated</span> <span>Thanksgiving</span>. <br/> 
🎧 They gave thanks for the food of the <span>harvest</span>, and for all the good things in their lives.<br/>
🎧 Today, the <span>tradition</span> of <span>Thanksgiving</span> <span>celebration</span> <span>continues</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Families</span> <span>gather</span> to eat a <span>large</span> <span>bird</span> <span>called</span> a <span>turkey</span>. <br/> 
🎧 They also eat <span>pumpkin</span> pie. <br/> 
🎧 This is a <span>sweet</span> <span>dessert</span> that is made from a <span>large</span> <span>orange</span> <span>vegetable</span> that <span>grows</span> on the <span>ground</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>United</span> <span>States</span>, <span>Thanksgiving</span> is <span>celebrated</span> on the <span>fourth</span> <span>Thursday</span> of <span>November</span>. <br/> 
🎧 But the <span>following</span> day, <span>Friday</span>, is also a <span>holiday</span>, and then comes the weekend. <br/> 
🎧 In <span>Canada</span>, <span>Thanksgiving</span> is <span>celebrated</span> on the <span>second</span> <span>Monday</span> of <span>October</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>reason</span> for the <span>earlier</span> <span>celebration</span> in <span>Canada</span> is that the <span>weather</span> is <span>colder</span> than in the <span>United</span> <span>States</span>. <br/> 
🎧 This <span>means</span> that the <span>harvest</span> <span>happens</span> <span>earlier</span> in <span>Canada</span>, so <span>Thanksgiving</span> is <span>held</span> at an <span>earlier</span> <span>date</span>. <br/> 
🎧 But in both <span>countries</span>, <span>Thanksgiving</span> is a very <span>pleasant</span> time of <span>year.<br/>

🎧 The <span>holiday</span> <span>called</span> <span>Halloween</span> is <span>celebrated</span> on <span>October</span> <span>31st</span> of each year. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Halloween</span> is not an <span>official</span> <span>holiday</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Everyone <span>goes</span> to work or to school on <span>Halloween</span>, just as on any other day. <br/> 
🎧 But <span>Halloween</span> is still one of the <span>holidays</span> that <span>children</span> like the most.<br/>
🎧 Why do <span>children</span> like <span>Halloween</span> so much? There are two <span>reasons:</span> <span>costumes</span> and <span>candy</span>.<br/>
🎧 On the <span>evening</span> of <span>October</span> <span>31st</span>, <span>children</span> <span>dress</span> up in <span>strange</span> and <span>unusual</span> <span>costumes</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>wear</span> <span>costumes</span> that may look like a <span>witch</span>, a <span>monster</span>, or many other <span>weird</span> things.<br/>
🎧 <span>Putting</span> on these <span>scary</span> <span>costumes</span> is a lot of fun for <span>children</span>.<br/>
🎧 After the <span>children</span> put on their <span>costumes</span>, they <span>walk</span> from house to house during the <span>evening</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>children</span> <span>carry</span> <span>large</span> <span>bags</span> with them. <br/> 
🎧 <span>At</span> each house, they <span>stop</span> and <span>knock</span> at the <span>door</span>. <br/> 
🎧 When an <span>adult</span> <span>opens</span> the <span>door</span>, the <span>children</span> <span>shout</span> <span>"trick</span> or <span>treat."</span> The <span>adult</span> who <span>opens</span> the <span>door</span> <span>pretends</span> to be <span>frightened</span>, and then <span>puts</span> <span>pieces</span> of <span>candy</span> into each <span>child's</span> <span>open</span> <span>bag</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>At</span> the end of the <span>evening</span>, the <span>children</span> have <span>visited</span> many <span>houses</span> and have <span>collected</span> much <span>candy</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>During</span> the next <span>several</span> <span>days</span>, they can <span>feast</span> <span>upon</span> the <span>sweet</span> <span>candies</span> that they have <span>received</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>Halloween</span> <span>tradition</span> is very <span>unusual</span>. <br/> 
🎧 In each house, a <span>family</span> <span>gets</span> a very <span>large</span>, <span>round</span> <span>orange</span> <span>vegetable</span> <span>called</span> a <span>pumpkin</span>. <br/> 
🎧 They cut a <span>hole</span> in the top of the <span>pumpkin</span>, and <span>empty</span> out the <span>flesh</span> and <span>seeds</span> of the <span>vegetable</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Then</span>, they cut <span>holes</span> in the side of the <span>pumpkin</span>, so that it <span>appears</span> to have <span>eyes</span>, a <span>nose</span>, and a <span>mouth</span>. <br/> 
🎧 When the <span>carving</span> is <span>finished</span>, the <span>pumpkin</span> looks almost like a <span>person's</span> <span>face!<br/></span> 
🎧 When the <span>pumpkin</span> has been <span>carved</span> to look like a <span>face</span>, people place a <span>light</span> inside the <span>pumpkin</span>, so that the <span>vegetable</span> <span>seems</span> to <span>glow</span> in the <span>dark</span>. <br/> 
🎧 This <span>strange-looking</span> <span>face</span> is <span>called</span> a <span>"jack-o-lantern."</span> On <span>Halloween</span> <span>evening</span>, one can see many of these <span>jack-olanterns</span>, some of which are very <span>beautifully</span> <span>carved</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Halloween</span> is <span>truly</span> a fun and <span>interesting</span> <span>holiday</span>, <span>especially</span> for <span>children!<br/>

🎧 <span>Hobbies</span> are <span>activities</span> that people do in their <span>spare</span> time, for the <span>sake</span> of <span>enjoyment</span>. <br/> 
🎧 A hobby usually <span>involves</span> work of some kind, but the work is fun for the person who does it.<br/>
🎧 Some people enjoy their <span>hobbies</span> very much and like to <span>spend</span> much time on <span>those</span> <span>hobbies</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are many different <span>hobbies</span> that people enjoy. <br/> 
🎧 One of the most <span>popular</span> <span>hobbies</span> is <span>gardening</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Many people enjoy <span>growing</span> <span>beautiful</span> <span>flowers</span> or <span>tasty</span> <span>vegetables</span> in a <span>garden</span> near their house or <span>apartment</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>People</span> who have a <span>garden</span> enjoy <span>seeing</span> the <span>results</span> of their work, when <span>flowers</span> <span>show</span> their <span>bright</span>, <span>beautiful</span> <span>colours</span>. <br/> 
🎧 But <span>gardeners</span> also enjoy the <span>tasks</span> of <span>gardening</span> <span>itself</span>. <br/> 
🎧 They like to work in the <span>soil</span>, <span>planting</span> and <span>watering</span> their <span>flowers</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>popular</span> hobby is <span>photography</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Some people enjoy taking <span>pictures</span> of the people and <span>places</span> around them. <br/> 
🎧 <span>People</span> who enjoy <span>photography</span> may sometimes buy <span>expensive</span> <span>cameras</span> that <span>allow</span> <span>interesting</span> <span>photographs</span> to be taken. <br/> 
🎧 But even people who have only a <span>basic</span> <span>camera</span> can still take <span>beautiful</span> <span>pictures</span>.<br/>
🎧 For many people, car <span>repair</span> is a <span>favourite</span> hobby. <br/> 
🎧 Some people enjoy <span>looking</span> at the <span>engine</span> and other <span>parts</span> of their <span>cars</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Those</span> people make <span>repairs</span> or <span>improvements</span> to their <span>cars</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Of course, this is a <span>useful</span> hobby, but many people enjoy <span>"fixing</span> <span>up"</span> a car <span>simply</span> because they enjoy working with <span>cars</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some people <span>collect</span> <span>objects</span> as a hobby. <br/> 
🎧 For example, some people <span>collect</span> <span>postage</span> <span>stamps</span>, and some people <span>collect</span> <span>coins</span>. <br/> 
🎧 It can be very <span>satisfying</span> to find the <span>missing</span> <span>parts</span> of <span>one's</span> <span>collection</span>, <span>especially</span> when the <span>stamps</span> or <span>coins</span> are very <span>rare</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course, these are just a few of the many <span>hobbies</span> that people enjoy. <br/>
