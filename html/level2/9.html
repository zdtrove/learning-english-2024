🎧 My <span>parents</span> live in <span>England</span>, and I live in <span>Canada</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I don't see them <span>often</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They used to come and <span>visit</span> on a <span>plane</span>, and we would <span>pick</span> them up at <span>Toronto</span> <span>airport</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 But now they are <span>older</span> and say the <span>flight</span> is too long for them.<br/>
🎧 I <span>went</span> to <span>visit</span> them last <span>year</span>, with my son, their <span>grandson</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They live by the <span>ocean</span>, and we <span>could</span> <span>hear</span> the <span>sound</span> of the <span>waves</span> <span>through</span> the <span>bedroom</span> <span>window</span> and see the <span>blue</span> <span>water</span> of the <span>English</span> <span>channel</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There is an <span>island</span> with a <span>castle</span> on top in the bay. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We <span>walked</span> many <span>times</span> on the <span>beach</span> and <span>picked</span> up <span>pebbles</span> and <span>feathers</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We <span>visited</span> the <span>island</span> and <span>walked</span> up the <span>steep</span> <span>hill</span> to the <span>castle</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mother</span> <span>likes</span> to <span>cook</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She <span>makes</span> <span>delicious</span> <span>cakes</span> and <span>pies</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We <span>went</span> for a <span>hike</span> and <span>picked</span> <span>wild</span> <span>blackberries</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She made them into a pie that <span>smelled</span> so good <span>coming</span> out of the <span>oven</span> and <span>tasted</span> so good on our <span>plates</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She has many <span>cook</span> <span>books</span> with <span>recipes</span> from all over the <span>world</span> and <span>likes</span> to try new <span>things</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She can make <span>pastry</span> very <span>easily</span> and <span>rolls</span> it with a <span>rolling</span> pin <span>quickly</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 When I <span>tried</span> to make <span>pastry</span>, it <span>sticks</span> to the <span>rolling</span> pin, it has <span>holes</span> at the <span>bottom</span> of the pie, and it <span>tastes</span> like a <span>rock</span>! Her <span>pastry</span> is <span>crisp</span> and <span>tender</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>father</span> <span>likes</span> to <span>garden</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 He <span>grows</span> <span>lettuce</span>, <span>carrots</span>, <span>potatoes</span>, <span>tomatoes</span>, <span>cucumbers</span> and many <span>flowers</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 When my <span>mother</span> was very ill last <span>year</span>, she had to <span>stay</span> in bed. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 He <span>planted</span> <span>roses</span> <span>outside</span> her <span>bedroom</span> <span>window</span>, so she <span>could</span> <span>open</span> the <span>curtains</span> and see them. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Their <span>house</span> has small <span>room</span> with <span>windows</span> all around, and they <span>plant</span> <span>seeds</span> there in <span>winter</span> in small <span>pots</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>warmth</span> from the sun <span>makes</span> the <span>seeds</span> <span>grow</span>, and in <span>spring</span> they are a good <span>size</span> to be <span>planted</span> <span>outside</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>In</span> the <span>house</span> <span>beside</span> them and in the <span>house</span> in <span>front</span> of them, there are <span>older</span> <span>ladies</span> whose <span>husbands</span> have <span>died</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>These</span> <span>ladies</span> do not <span>drive</span>, so my <span>father</span> <span>takes</span> my <span>mother</span> and the two <span>ladies</span> to the <span>town</span> for <span>shopping</span> <span>every</span> <span>week</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 He <span>helps</span> one find her <span>groceries</span> <span>because</span> she <span>cannot</span> see well. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 He <span>helps</span> her take <span>tapes</span> of <span>books</span> from the <span>library</span> so she can <span>listen</span> to <span>books</span> <span>instead</span> of <span>reading</span> them <span>because</span> of her <span>eyes</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 He <span>helps</span> them cut their <span>grass</span> and fix <span>anything</span> that is <span>broken</span> in the <span>house</span>.<br/>
🎧 I am very <span>proud</span> of my <span>parents;</span> they are over <span>eighty</span> <span>years</span> old and <span>often</span> <span>hurt</span> when they move around. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 But still they <span>help</span> other people, and they <span>help</span> each other. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They have been <span>married</span> for over <span>fifty</span> <span>years</span>, but still my <span>father</span> <span>loves</span> my <span>mother</span> enough to <span>plant</span> <span>roses</span> for her to <span>cheer</span> her up when she was <span>ill.<br/>

🎧 The <span>planet</span> on which we live is <span>called</span> the <span>Earth</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Our <span>planet</span> is <span>constantly</span> <span>moving</span> around the sun, and each <span>year</span>, the <span>Earth</span> <span>travels</span> all the way around the sun. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 But there are many other <span>planets</span> that also <span>travel</span> around the sun. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Together</span> with the sun, the <span>planets</span>, and <span>various</span> other <span>bodies</span>, the <span>Earth</span> is <span>part</span> of our <span>"solar</span> <span>system."<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>planet</span> that is <span>closest</span> to the sun is <span>Mercury</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Mercury</span> is <span>extremely</span> hot, and it is much <span>smaller</span> than the <span>Earth</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>second</span> <span>planet</span> from the sun is <span>Venus</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Venus</span> is about the same <span>size</span> as the <span>Earth</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Venus</span> is also very <span>hot</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Earth</span> is the <span>third</span> <span>planet</span> from the sun. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>Earth</span> is <span>unusual</span> <span>among</span> the <span>planets</span>, <span>because</span> it has such a <span>large</span> <span>moon</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>Earth</span> is <span>bigger</span> than the <span>moon</span>, but the <span>moon</span> is still <span>quite</span> <span>large</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It <span>takes</span> about one <span>month</span> for the <span>moon</span> to <span>travel</span> around the <span>Earth</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>fourth</span> <span>planet</span> from the sun is <span>Mars</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Mars</span> is <span>known</span> for its red <span>colour</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Mars</span> is <span>smaller</span> and <span>colder</span> than the <span>Earth</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Mars</span> has two very small <span>moons</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>After</span> the <span>planet</span> <span>Mars</span>, there are many small <span>bodies</span> <span>called</span> the <span>asteroids</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>These</span> <span>rocky</span> <span>objects</span> are much <span>smaller</span> than <span>planets</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>first</span> <span>four</span> <span>planets</span> are all made of <span>rock</span> and <span>metal</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>remaining</span> <span>planets</span>, <span>however</span>, are <span>mostly</span> made of <span>frozen</span> <span>gases</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>fifth</span> <span>planet</span> is <span>called</span> <span>Jupiter</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Jupiter</span> is the <span>largest</span> <span>planet</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It has many <span>moons</span> that <span>travel</span> around it, and it also has a <span>large</span> red <span>spot</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>sixth</span> <span>planet</span> is <span>called</span> <span>Saturn</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Saturn</span> is the <span>second-largest</span> <span>planet</span>, and it is <span>famous</span> for the <span>wide</span> <span>"rings"</span> that <span>surround</span> it. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>These</span> <span>rings</span> are made up of many <span>smaller</span> <span>objects</span> that are <span>found</span> in the same <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>seventh</span> <span>planet</span> is <span>called</span> <span>Uranus</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>eighth</span> <span>planet</span> is <span>called</span> <span>Neptune</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>These</span> <span>planets</span> are also gas <span>giants</span>, but they are <span>smaller</span> than <span>Jupiter</span> and <span>Saturn</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Both <span>Uranus</span> and <span>Neptune</span> are so far from the sun that <span>scientists</span> only <span>discovered</span> these <span>planets</span> during the <span>past</span> few <span>hundred</span> <span>years</span>, <span>using</span> <span>telescopes</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The other <span>planets</span> had all been <span>visible</span> to <span>curious</span> people for many <span>thousands</span> of <span>years</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>ninth</span> <span>planet</span> is <span>called</span> <span>Pluto</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Pluto</span> is very small, and it is much more <span>rocky</span> than the gas <span>giants</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Some <span>scientists</span> <span>believe</span> that <span>Pluto</span> is not <span>really</span> a <span>planet</span> at all. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They <span>suggest</span> that <span>Pluto</span> is the <span>largest</span> of many <span>asteroids</span> that are <span>found</span> at the <span>edge</span> of the <span>solar</span> <span>system</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>solar</span> <span>system</span> is a <span>vast</span> <span>place</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 So far, people have not <span>travelled</span> <span>beyond</span> the <span>moon</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 But <span>perhaps</span> <span>someday</span>, <span>human</span> <span>astronauts</span> will <span>visit</span> the other <span>planets</span> of our <span>solar</span> <span>system!<br/>

🎧 <span>Each</span> <span>year</span>, many <span>young</span> people learn to <span>drive</span> a car. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 For many people, <span>learning</span> to <span>drive</span> is <span>important</span> <span>because</span> the car is an <span>important</span> <span>method</span> of <span>transportation</span> in many <span>places</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Before</span> <span>learning</span> to <span>drive</span> a car, it is <span>important</span> to <span>understand</span> the <span>rules</span> of the <span>road</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 A <span>beginning</span> <span>driver</span> should <span>already</span> <span>understand</span> the many <span>signs</span> that are <span>found</span> <span>along</span> the <span>roads</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Also, the <span>student</span> <span>driver</span> should know the many <span>rules</span> about <span>changing</span> <span>lanes</span>, <span>turning</span>, <span>stopping</span>, and many other <span>aspects</span> of <span>driving</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>In</span> <span>addition</span>, the <span>driver</span> should be <span>familiar</span> with the way the car is <span>operated;</span> it is <span>important</span> to know how to use the <span>lights</span>, <span>signals</span>, <span>brakes</span>, <span>accelerator</span>, and <span>steering</span> <span>wheel</span>.<br/>
🎧 When a person <span>starts</span> <span>learning</span> to <span>drive</span>, it may take some time to <span>become</span> <span>skilful</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It <span>takes</span> some <span>practice</span> to <span>become</span> an <span>expert</span> in <span>driving</span> a car. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 One <span>must</span> <span>become</span> <span>familiar</span> with <span>steering</span>, <span>speeding</span> up, and <span>slowing</span> <span>down</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>At</span> <span>first</span>, it is good to <span>practice</span> <span>driving</span> in a <span>large</span> <span>open</span> <span>space</span>, such as an <span>empty</span> <span>parking</span> lot. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Here</span>, one can <span>practice</span> <span>without</span> being a <span>danger</span> to <span>anyone</span>.<br/>
🎧 When a person <span>gains</span> some <span>skill</span> in <span>driving</span>, it is <span>then</span> <span>safe</span> enough to <span>practice</span> <span>driving</span> on a <span>road</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Of</span> <span>course</span>, a <span>student</span> <span>driver</span> <span>must</span> still be very <span>careful</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 He or she should always have an <span>expert</span> <span>driver</span> in the car with him or her. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 many <span>beginning</span> <span>drivers</span> take <span>driving</span> <span>lessons</span> from <span>professional</span> <span>instructors</span>, who can <span>teach</span> <span>safe</span> <span>driving</span> <span>techniques</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Eventually</span>, the <span>young</span> <span>driver</span> is <span>ready</span> for a <span>driving</span> <span>test</span>, which is <span>needed</span> to <span>obtain</span> a <span>regular</span> <span>driver's</span> <span>licence</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 This <span>test</span> is <span>supervised</span> by a <span>government</span> <span>official</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>In</span> the <span>driving</span> <span>test</span>, the <span>driver</span> <span>must</span> <span>show</span> that he or she can <span>control</span> the car with <span>great</span> <span>skill</span> by being <span>able</span> to make <span>turns</span> and to <span>park</span> the car in small <span>spaces</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 But he or she <span>must</span> also <span>show</span> <span>respect</span> for the <span>rules</span> of the <span>road</span> by <span>driving</span> at a <span>proper</span> <span>speed</span>, and <span>obeying</span> all <span>traffic</span> <span>signs</span> and <span>signals</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Of</span> <span>course</span>, even when one has <span>obtained</span> a <span>driver's</span> <span>licence</span>, it is always <span>important</span> to <span>drive</span> <span>carefully</span> and <span>responsibly!<br/>

🎧 <span>Snow</span> is the <span>white</span> <span>substance</span> that <span>falls</span> to the <span>ground</span> during <span>cold</span> <span>weather</span> <span>conditions</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Each</span> <span>tiny</span> <span>piece</span> of <span>snow</span>, <span>called</span> a <span>snowflake</span>, is a very small <span>amount</span> of <span>water</span> that has <span>frozen</span> into an <span>unusual</span> <span>shape</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>During</span> the <span>winter</span> <span>months</span>, <span>huge</span> <span>numbers</span> of <span>snowflakes</span> <span>fall</span> to the <span>ground</span>, <span>covering</span> the <span>land</span> in a <span>white</span> <span>blanket</span> of <span>snow</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>In</span> many <span>parts</span> of the <span>world</span>, people <span>never</span> see any <span>snow</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Snow</span> only <span>falls</span> when there is <span>moisture</span> in the air, and when the <span>temperature</span> <span>falls</span> <span>below</span> the <span>freezing</span> <span>point</span> of <span>water</span>, which is <span>zero</span> <span>degrees</span> <span>Celsius</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>During</span> the <span>winter</span>, <span>snow</span> <span>falls</span> <span>instead</span> of <span>rain</span>.<br/>
🎧 One <span>advantage</span> of <span>snow</span> is that it <span>allows</span> many fun <span>outdoor</span> <span>activities</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Children</span> like to play in the <span>snow</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 For example, they may make a <span>"snowman"</span> by <span>rolling</span> <span>snow</span> into a <span>large</span> <span>ball</span>, and <span>then</span> <span>placing</span> these <span>balls</span> of <span>snow</span> on top of each other, in the <span>shape</span> of a person. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Another</span> fun <span>activity</span> in the <span>snow</span> is <span>skiing</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Skis</span> are very long, <span>thin</span>, <span>flat</span> <span>pieces</span> of <span>hard</span> <span>material</span> that one <span>wears</span> on <span>one's</span> <span>feet</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Wearing</span> <span>skis</span> <span>allows</span> a person to <span>slide</span> <span>along</span> the <span>surface</span> of the <span>snow</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>People</span> can ski <span>down</span> the <span>side</span> of a <span>hill</span>, <span>travelling</span> at <span>great</span> <span>speeds</span>.<br/>
🎧 many people find the <span>sport</span> of <span>downhill</span> <span>skiing</span> to be very <span>exciting</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Some people like to ski <span>along</span> <span>flat</span> <span>ground</span>, <span>often</span> <span>travelling</span> <span>great</span> <span>distances</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 This <span>sport</span>, <span>called</span> <span>cross-country</span> <span>skiing</span>, is an <span>excellent</span> way to <span>develop</span> <span>physical</span> <span>fitness</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Of</span> <span>course</span>, <span>snow</span> also <span>causes</span> some <span>problems</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Snow</span> can make <span>driving</span> <span>dangerous</span> <span>because</span> <span>falling</span> <span>snow</span> <span>makes</span> <span>roads</span> <span>slippery</span>, and on a <span>windy</span> day, <span>blowing</span> <span>snow</span> can make it <span>difficult</span> to see very far. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It can also be a lot of work to <span>remove</span> <span>snow</span> from the <span>roads</span> and <span>sidewalks</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Snow</span> is a <span>heavy</span> <span>substance</span>, and it <span>must</span> be <span>cleared</span> away <span>using</span> a <span>shovel</span> or a <span>large</span> <span>machine</span>.<br/>
🎧 many people love the <span>beauty</span> of the <span>land</span> when it is <span>covered</span> by <span>snow</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>white</span> <span>covering</span> of <span>snow</span> over the <span>fields</span> and <span>trees</span> can give a <span>feeling</span> of <span>peace</span> and <span>calm</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>If</span> you have <span>never</span> <span>seen</span> <span>snow</span> <span>before</span>, you should <span>someday</span> <span>experience</span> this <span>strange</span> and <span>wonderful</span> <span>substance!<br/>

🎧 <span>In</span> most <span>Western</span> <span>countries</span>, <span>Christmas</span> is the <span>biggest</span> <span>holiday</span> of the <span>year</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>People</span> <span>gather</span> with their <span>families</span> to <span>celebrate</span> this day, which <span>occurs</span> on <span>December</span> <span>25th</span> each <span>year</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>holiday</span> of <span>Christmas</span> <span>celebrates</span> the <span>birth</span> of <span>Jesus</span> <span>Christ</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>In</span> the <span>Christian</span> <span>religion</span>, <span>Jesus</span> <span>Christ</span> is <span>recognized</span> as the Son of <span>God</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>During</span> the <span>Christmas</span> <span>season</span>, many people <span>celebrate</span> the <span>events</span> of the <span>birth</span> of <span>Jesus</span> <span>Christ</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 For example, they <span>recall</span> the <span>three</span> <span>wise</span> men who <span>visited</span> <span>Jesus</span> <span>Christ</span> <span>shortly</span> <span>after</span> his <span>birth</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Also, they <span>recall</span> that <span>Jesus</span> <span>Christ</span> was <span>born</span> in a <span>manger</span> <span>(a</span> <span>place</span> where <span>horses</span> are <span>kept)</span>, <span>because</span> his <span>parents</span> <span>could</span> not find a <span>place</span> to <span>stay</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>In</span> <span>Western</span> <span>countries</span>, <span>Christmas</span> is also <span>celebrated</span> by many people who are not <span>religious</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>People</span> <span>view</span> <span>Christmas</span> as a time for being <span>together</span> with <span>one's</span> <span>relatives</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Children</span>, <span>parents</span>, and <span>grandparents</span> <span>gather</span> to <span>exchange</span> <span>presents</span> and to eat special <span>foods</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>tradition</span> of <span>giving</span> <span>gifts</span> at <span>Christmas</span> is <span>unusual</span> in one way. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 When <span>children</span> go to bed on the <span>evening</span> <span>before</span> <span>Christmas</span>, they <span>hang</span> <span>large</span> <span>socks</span> <span>(called</span> <span>stockings)</span> in their <span>house</span>.<br/>
🎧 When they <span>wake</span> up on <span>Christmas</span> <span>morning</span>, the <span>stockings</span> have been <span>filled</span> with <span>toys</span> and <span>candy</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>According</span> to <span>tradition</span>, the <span>presents</span> have been <span>given</span> by a fat man who <span>wears</span> a <span>white</span> <span>beard</span> and a red <span>suit</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 This man, <span>called</span> <span>Santa</span> <span>Claus</span>, <span>flies</span> around the <span>world</span> in a <span>sled</span> that is <span>pulled</span> by <span>reindeer</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 He <span>stops</span> at each <span>house</span> and <span>flies</span> <span>down</span> the <span>chimney</span> to <span>deliver</span> his <span>presents</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>In</span> the <span>weeks</span> <span>before</span> <span>Christmas</span>, <span>children</span> are usually very well <span>behaved</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Their <span>parents</span> <span>tell</span> them that <span>Santa</span> <span>Claus</span> will only give <span>presents</span> to <span>children</span> who are <span>good!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Another</span> <span>Christmas</span> <span>tradition</span> is the <span>Christmas</span> <span>tree</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>People</span> put a small <span>tree</span> <span>inside</span> their <span>house</span> and <span>decorate</span> it with <span>various</span> <span>pretty</span> <span>objects</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Nowadays</span>, most people use an <span>artificial</span> <span>tree</span> <span>instead</span> of a <span>real</span> <span>tree</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>tradition</span> of the <span>Christmas</span> <span>tree</span> is <span>actually</span> <span>older</span> than <span>Christmas</span> <span>itself-the</span> people of <span>Europe</span> <span>celebrated</span> the <span>beginning</span> of the <span>winter</span> <span>season</span> in this way even <span>before</span> <span>Christianity</span> <span>reached</span> <span>Europe</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Christmas</span> is <span>certainly</span> one of the most <span>important</span> and most <span>enjoyed</span> <span>holidays</span> in <span>Western</span> <span>countries.<br/>

🎧 <span>Thanksgiving</span> is a <span>holiday</span> that has a long <span>history</span> in <span>North</span> <span>America</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It was <span>first</span> <span>celebrated</span> when <span>English</span> <span>settlers</span> <span>arrived</span> in the <span>eastern</span> <span>part</span> of what is now the <span>United</span> <span>States</span>, during the <span>seventeenth</span> <span>century</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 When they <span>survived</span> the <span>first</span> <span>hard</span> <span>year</span>, they <span>celebrated</span> and gave thanks to <span>God</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They <span>invited</span> some of the <span>Native</span> people to their <span>Thanksgiving</span> <span>celebration</span>, <span>because</span> the <span>Native</span> people had <span>helped</span> them to <span>survive</span> during the <span>hard</span> <span>winter</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>tradition</span> of <span>celebrating</span> <span>Thanksgiving</span> <span>continued</span> and <span>spread</span> <span>throughout</span> <span>North</span> <span>America</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Each</span> <span>fall</span>, during the time of the <span>autumn</span> <span>harvest</span>, people <span>celebrated</span> <span>Thanksgiving</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They gave thanks for the <span>food</span> of the <span>harvest</span>, and for all the good <span>things</span> in their <span>lives</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Today</span>, the <span>tradition</span> of <span>Thanksgiving</span> <span>celebration</span> <span>continues</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Families</span> <span>gather</span> to eat a <span>large</span> <span>bird</span> <span>called</span> a <span>turkey</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They also eat <span>pumpkin</span> pie. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 This is a <span>sweet</span> <span>dessert</span> that is made from a <span>large</span> <span>orange</span> <span>vegetable</span> that <span>grows</span> on the <span>ground</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>In</span> the <span>United</span> <span>States</span>, <span>Thanksgiving</span> is <span>celebrated</span> on the <span>fourth</span> <span>Thursday</span> of <span>November</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>In</span> <span>Canada</span>, <span>Thanksgiving</span> is <span>celebrated</span> on the <span>second</span> <span>Monday</span> of <span>October</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>reason</span> for the <span>earlier</span> <span>celebration</span> in <span>Canada</span> is that the <span>weather</span> is <span>colder</span> than in the <span>United</span> <span>States</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 This <span>means</span> that the <span>harvest</span> <span>happens</span> <span>earlier</span> in <span>Canada</span>, so <span>Thanksgiving</span> is <span>held</span> at an <span>earlier</span> <span>date</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>People</span> who have a <span>garden</span> enjoy <span>seeing</span> the <span>results</span> of their work, when <span>flowers</span> <span>show</span> their <span>bright</span>, <span>beautiful</span> <span>colours</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 But <span>gardeners</span> also enjoy the <span>tasks</span> of <span>gardening</span> <span>itself</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They like to work in the <span>soil</span>, <span>planting</span> and <span>watering</span> their <span>flowers</span>.<br/>
