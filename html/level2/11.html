🎧 My <span>friend</span> <span>Lani</span> and I <span>went</span> to <span>Burger</span> <span>King</span> <span>yesterday</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We <span>ordered</span> a big <span>order</span> of <span>french</span> <span>fries</span> and a <span>couple</span> of <span>drinks</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Lani</span> got a <span>strawberry</span> <span>milkshake</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>picked</span> out a <span>table</span> <span>near</span> the <span>window</span> so we <span>could</span> look at the <span>people</span> <span>passing</span> by. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>As</span> we were <span>sitting</span> there, we <span>heard</span> our <span>favourite</span> <span>song</span>, <span>"Butterfly"</span> by the <span>band</span> <span>Crazy</span> <span>Town</span> <span>come</span> on the <span>radio</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We <span>looked</span> at each other with big <span>grins</span> on our <span>faces</span> and <span>started</span> <span>singing</span> and <span>dancing!<br/></span> 
🎧 It was <span>great</span> fun. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 many <span>people</span> <span>began</span> <span>staring</span> at us, <span>wondering</span> why we were so <span>happy</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We didn't <span>care;</span> we just <span>kept</span> on <span>moving</span> and <span>enjoying</span> <span>ourselves</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>song</span> <span>ended</span>, and we were <span>almost</span> <span>finished</span> our <span>food</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We <span>sat</span> and <span>talked</span> about what was <span>happening</span> in our <span>lives</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She had just <span>bought</span> <span>four</span> new <span>t-shirts</span> for the <span>summer</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The new <span>sandals</span> she had <span>gotten</span> for her <span>birthday</span> had <span>given</span> her <span>really</span> bad <span>blisters</span> on the <span>sides</span> of her <span>feet</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 When she <span>wore</span> other <span>shoes</span>, she had to <span>wear</span> <span>bandaids</span> on the <span>blisters</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>told</span> her that I had <span>bought</span> <span>four</span> new <span>C.D.'s</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I love <span>music</span>! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>As</span> we <span>finished</span> our <span>conversation</span>, we <span>finished</span> off our <span>drinks</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I like <span>going</span> out with <span>Lani</span> and <span>talking</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Lani</span> is my <span>best</span> <span>friend</span> and I can talk to her about <span>anything</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I am <span>glad</span> I have her to <span>share</span> my life with, even if it is as <span>simple</span> as <span>going</span> to <span>Burger</span> <span>King</span> and <span>eating</span> <span>french</span> <span>fries!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Lani</span> and I are <span>planning</span> to <span>travel</span> <span>together</span> so we are <span>trying</span> to <span>save</span> our <span>money</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Our <span>french</span> <span>fries</span> and <span>drink</span> <span>only</span> <span>came</span> to about <span>$6</span>, so we didn't feel too bad about <span>spending</span> our <span>money!<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>wonder</span> <span>though</span>, if <span>McDonald's</span> would have <span>been</span> <span>cheaper?<br/>

🎧 <span>Tasha</span> <span>signed</span> a <span>piece</span> of <span>paper</span> which gave her a <span>chance</span> to win a <span>free</span> air <span>plane</span> <span>ride</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She put her <span>name</span>, <span>address</span> and <span>telephone</span> <span>number</span> on that <span>piece</span> of <span>paper</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 A few <span>days</span> <span>later</span> she got a <span>telephone</span> <span>call</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It was the man that was <span>holding</span> the <span>ticket</span> <span>draw</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Tasha</span> didn't think she would win, but the man on the <span>telephone</span> said she <span>did!<br/></span> 
🎧 She <span>listened</span> as the man <span>told</span> her where she would have to go to get her <span>free</span> air <span>plane</span> <span>ride</span>.<br/>
🎧 She had to go <span>near</span> the <span>town</span> of <span>Grimsby</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She was <span>allowed</span> to <span>pick</span> a <span>friend</span> to go with her on the air <span>plane</span> <span>ride</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Tasha</span> was so <span>happy</span>! She <span>asked</span> her <span>twin</span> <span>sister</span> <span>Tawnya</span> to go with her. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Tawnya</span> was very <span>excited</span>! <span>Neither</span> of them had <span>been</span> on an air <span>plane</span> <span>before</span>.<br/>
🎧 When they got to the air <span>plane</span> <span>centre</span>, <span>Tasha</span> and <span>Tawnya</span> were <span>nervous</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They <span>knew</span> the air <span>plane</span> was <span>small</span> so that <span>meant</span> <span>only</span> the <span>pilot</span> and them were <span>going</span> to be in the <span>plane</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Their</span> mom took a <span>picture</span> of them <span>beside</span> the <span>plane</span> <span>before</span> they <span>left</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Tasha</span> and <span>Tawnya</span> <span>hopped</span> into the <span>plane</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They put <span>their</span> <span>seatbelts</span> on and got <span>ready</span> for <span>take-off</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Tasha</span> got to sit in the very <span>front</span>, <span>right</span> <span>beside</span> the <span>pilot</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Tawnya</span> <span>sat</span> <span>behind</span> <span>Tasha</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>girls</span> <span>laughed</span> <span>nervously</span> as the <span>plane</span> <span>started</span> <span>rolling</span> <span>down</span> the <span>runway</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They <span>went</span> <span>faster</span> and <span>faster</span>, <span>trees</span> <span>passing</span> by <span>quickly</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There was a <span>powerful</span> <span>surge</span> <span>making</span> <span>everyone's</span> <span>head</span> <span>jerk</span> back. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>plane</span> <span>started</span> <span>lifting</span> off the <span>ground</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Up</span>, up, and <span>away!<br/></span> 
🎧 They were up off the <span>ground</span> and <span>flying</span> high in the sky! It <span>seemed</span> as <span>though</span> they <span>could</span> get <span>anywhere</span> <span>within</span> a <span>matter</span> of <span>seconds</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They <span>flew</span> from <span>Grimsby</span> to <span>Beamsville</span> where they saw <span>their</span> high school. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Then</span>, on to <span>St</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Catharines</span> and <span>then</span> <span>Niagara</span> <span>Falls</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They even <span>flew</span> over top of <span>their</span> <span>house</span>! They took <span>pictures</span> of <span>their</span> <span>house</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They <span>could</span> see <span>their</span> <span>pond</span> from way up there, <span>too</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>pilot</span> <span>asked</span> <span>Tasha</span> if she <span>wanted</span> to fly the <span>plane</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>"Sure!"</span> <span>Tasha</span> said. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 So, <span>Tasha</span> took the <span>steering</span> <span>handle</span> and <span>began</span> to fly the <span>plane</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She didn't <span>really</span> know how to fly it, so when she <span>pulled</span> the <span>handle</span> <span>down</span>, the <span>plane</span> <span>shot</span> <span>upward</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Both</span> of the <span>girls</span> <span>squealed</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Tasha</span> <span>levelled</span> the <span>plane</span> and <span>flew</span> <span>smoothly</span> from <span>then</span> on.<br/>
🎧 <span>Soon</span> it was time to go back to <span>Grimsby</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>pilot</span> took over <span>again</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We <span>braced</span> <span>ourselves</span> as the <span>landing</span> <span>strip</span> got <span>nearer</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>landing</span> <span>went</span> <span>smoothly</span> with <span>Tasha</span> and <span>Tawnya</span> <span>beaming</span> as they <span>looked</span> out at the <span>ground</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They <span>hopped</span> off of the <span>plane</span>, <span>thanked</span> the <span>pilot</span> and ran to <span>tell</span> <span>their</span> mom about <span>their</span> <span>wonderful</span> <span>experience.<br/>

🎧 My <span>younger</span> <span>brother</span> is the <span>baby</span> of the <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think that we all <span>spoil</span> him.<br/>
🎧 We let him get <span>away</span> with some <span>things</span> that he shouldn't get <span>away</span> with.<br/>
🎧 His <span>room</span> is always <span>messy</span>, and my <span>mother</span> <span>never</span> <span>gets</span> mad about that.<br/>
🎧 She <span>gets</span> <span>upset</span> with me if my <span>room</span> is <span>messy</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>tells</span> me that <span>I'm</span> old <span>enough</span> to <span>keep</span> a <span>nice</span> <span>clean</span> <span>room</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>no</span> <span>good</span> <span>thinking</span> about which <span>position</span> you would like to <span>hold</span> in the <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 You <span>really</span> don't have a <span>choice</span> about that.<br/>
🎧 I think I like being the <span>middle</span> <span>child</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can <span>relate</span> to my <span>older</span> <span>sister</span> and my <span>younger</span> <span>brother</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yes</span>, I think the <span>middle</span> is <span>probably</span> a <span>good</span> <span>place</span> to <span>be.<br/>

🎧 My <span>advice</span> to a <span>student</span> from a <span>foreign</span> <span>country</span> would be to talk, talk, talk.<br/>
🎧 <span>Talk</span> as much as you can to the <span>people</span> who live in the <span>place</span> that you are <span>visiting</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Talk</span> to them and <span>practice</span> your new <span>language</span> <span>skills</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Learn</span> all the <span>funny</span> <span>sayings</span> and <span>different</span> <span>words</span> that make up <span>their</span> <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Talking</span> is the <span>only</span> way to <span>really</span> learn a <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Listen</span> to <span>people</span> and talk to <span>people</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>If</span> you talk to <span>people</span>, you will <span>also</span> learn about <span>their</span> <span>culture</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have a <span>friend</span> from <span>Japan</span>.<br/>
🎧 His <span>name</span> is <span>Nori</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>often</span> <span>comes</span> to see me just so that he can <span>practice</span> his <span>English</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>gets</span> <span>confused</span> about <span>words</span> that <span>sound</span> the <span>same</span>, but <span>mean</span> <span>different</span> <span>things</span>.<br/>
🎧 He was <span>asking</span> me about the <span>words</span> <span>"see"</span> and <span>"sea."<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>explained</span> to him that they do <span>sound</span> the <span>same</span>, but they are <span>spelled</span> <span>differently</span>, and they <span>mean</span> <span>different</span> <span>things</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Nori</span> is <span>learning</span> some of our <span>funny</span> <span>sayings</span> from <span>different</span> <span>people</span>.<br/>
🎧 One <span>morning</span> I <span>asked</span> him how he was, and he said <span>"alive</span> and <span>kicking."<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Another</span> <span>morning</span> when I <span>asked</span> him how he was, he said <span>"so</span> <span>so."</span> <span><br/></span> 
🎧 He <span>laughs</span> about <span>these</span> <span>strange</span> <span>sayings</span> that we <span>use</span>.<br/>
🎧 He is <span>learning</span> <span>English</span> <span>quickly</span> <span>because</span> he <span>spends</span> a lot of time with <span>English-speaking</span> <span>people</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>likes</span> to have <span>lunch</span> with my <span>friends</span> and me <span>because</span> we ask him <span>questions</span> about his <span>homeland</span>, and he <span>answers</span> us in <span>English</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>If</span> he doesn't <span>understand</span> our <span>questions</span>, we <span>spend</span> time <span>explaining</span> what we <span>mean</span> to him.<br/>
🎧 He <span>says</span> that he <span>enjoys</span> being here.<br/>
🎧 He <span>thinks</span> that the <span>people</span> are very <span>friendly</span>.<br/>
🎧 We enjoy <span>speaking</span> to him and <span>helping</span> him to learn <span>English</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>also</span> enjoy <span>learning</span> about his <span>country</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is <span>enjoyable</span> for us to <span>meet</span> new <span>people</span> and learn about new <span>things.<br/>

🎧 One <span>dark</span> and <span>gloomy</span> <span>night</span>, I was <span>sitting</span> in my <span>bedroom</span> <span>reading</span> <span>ghost</span> <span>stories</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>stories</span> were very <span>scary</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>storm</span> was <span>brewing</span> <span>outside</span> my <span>window</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>wind</span> <span>began</span> to <span>howl</span>, and the <span>trees</span> <span>shook</span> and <span>bent</span> in the <span>wind</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Lightening</span> <span>started</span> to <span>flash</span> <span>across</span> the <span>sky</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>felt</span> <span>uneasy</span> as I <span>heard</span> the low <span>rumble</span> of <span>thunder</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>glanced</span> <span>around</span> my <span>room</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>shadows</span> were <span>deep</span> and <span>dark</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>ghost</span> <span>stories</span> were <span>making</span> my <span>imagination</span> play <span>tricks</span> on me.<br/>
🎧 I <span>thought</span> that the <span>shadows</span> were <span>moving</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>looked</span> <span>under</span> my bed to make sure that <span>nothing</span> was <span>under</span> there.<br/>
🎧 I hid <span>under</span> the <span>covers</span> and <span>peeked</span> out.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>starting</span> to <span>hear</span> <span>things</span>.<br/>
🎧 A big <span>streak</span> of <span>lightening</span> <span>flashed</span> <span>across</span> the sky, and a <span>loud</span> <span>clap</span> of <span>thunder</span> made me <span>jump</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was very <span>nervous</span>.<br/>
🎧 All of a <span>sudden</span>, I <span>heard</span> a <span>noise</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>coming</span> from my <span>closet</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>thought</span> that it <span>must</span> be a <span>ghost</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>looked</span> out from <span>under</span> my <span>covers</span> and <span>waited</span> for the <span>ghost</span> to <span>appear</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>face</span> was <span>white</span>, and I was very, very <span>scared</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Then</span>, I <span>heard</span> the <span>noise</span> <span>again</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yes</span>, there was <span>definitely</span> a <span>rustling</span> in my <span>closet</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>stayed</span> very still and did not make a <span>sound</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>watched</span> the <span>closet</span> and <span>hoped</span> that the <span>ghost</span> would not <span>come</span> <span>flying</span> out at me.<br/>
🎧 <span>Something</span> <span>started</span> to <span>come</span> out of the <span>closet</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>squeezed</span> my <span>eyes</span> <span>shut</span>.<br/>
🎧 I didn't <span>dare</span> to look at the <span>ghost</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>heard</span> it <span>come</span> out of the <span>closet</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>felt</span> it <span>jump</span> up on my <span>bed</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was still too <span>scared</span> to look.<br/>
🎧 <span>Then</span> the <span>ghost</span> made a <span>noise</span>.<br/>
🎧 It said, <span>"meow."</span> <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>opened</span> my <span>eyes</span> and saw my <span>kitten</span> <span>standing</span> there.<br/>
🎧 It was my <span>kitten</span> that had made the <span>rustling</span> <span>noises</span> in the <span>closet</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>laughed</span> and <span>felt</span> very <span>foolish</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have <span>decided</span> not to <span>read</span> <span>ghost</span> <span>stories</span> on <span>dark</span> <span>stormy</span> <span>nights</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think my <span>imagination</span> <span>plays</span> <span>tricks</span> on me when I <span>read</span> <span>ghost</span> <span>stories</span> on <span>nights</span> like <span>that.<br/>
