🎧 My friend Lani and I went to Burger King yesterday. <br/> 
🎧 We ordered a big order of french fries and a couple of drinks. <br/> 
🎧 Lani got a strawberry milkshake.<br/>
🎧 I picked out a table near the window so we could look at the people passing by. <br/> 
🎧 As we were sitting there, we heard our favourite song, "Butterfly" by the band Crazy Town come on the radio. <br/> 
🎧 We looked at each other with big grins on our faces and started singing and dancing!<br/> 
🎧 It was great fun. <br/> 
🎧 Many people began staring at us, wondering why we were so happy. <br/> 
🎧 We didn't care; we just kept on moving and enjoying ourselves.<br/>
🎧 The song ended, and we were almost finished our food. <br/> 
🎧 We sat and talked about what was happening in our lives. <br/> 
🎧 She had just bought four new t-shirts for the summer. <br/> 
🎧 The new sandals she had gotten for her birthday had given her really bad blisters on the sides of her feet. <br/> 
🎧 When she wore other shoes, she had to wear bandaids on the blisters. <br/> 
🎧 I told her that I had bought four new C.D.'s. <br/> 
🎧 I love music! <br/> 
🎧 As we finished our conversation, we finished off our drinks. <br/> 
🎧 I like going out with Lani and talking. <br/> 
🎧 Lani is my best friend and I can talk to her about anything. <br/> 
🎧 I am glad I have her to share my life with, even if it is as simple as going to Burger King and eating french fries!<br/> 
🎧 Lani and I are planning to travel together so we are trying to save our money. <br/> 
🎧 Our french fries and drink only came to about $6, so we didn't feel too bad about spending our money!<br/> 
🎧 I wonder though, if McDonald's would have been cheaper

🎧 Tasha signed a piece of paper which gave her a chance to win a free air plane ride. <br/> 
🎧 She put her name, address and telephone number on that piece of paper. <br/> 
🎧 A few days later she got a telephone call. <br/> 
🎧 It was the man that was holding the ticket draw. <br/> 
🎧 Tasha didn't think she would win, but the man on the telephone said she did!<br/> 
🎧 She listened as the man told her where she would have to go to get her free air plane ride.<br/>
🎧 She had to go near the town of Grimsby. <br/> 
🎧 She was allowed to pick a friend to go with her on the air plane ride. <br/> 
🎧 Tasha was so happy! She asked her twin sister Tawnya to go with her. <br/> 
🎧 Tawnya was very excited! Neither of them had been on an air plane before.<br/>
🎧 When they got to the air plane centre, Tasha and Tawnya were nervous. <br/> 
🎧 They knew the air plane was small so that meant only the pilot and them were going to be in the plane.<br/>
🎧 Their mom took a picture of them beside the plane before they left.<br/>
🎧 Tasha and Tawnya hopped into the plane. <br/> 
🎧 They put their seatbelts on and got ready for take-off. <br/> 
🎧 Tasha got to sit in the very front, right beside the pilot. <br/> 
🎧 Tawnya sat behind Tasha.<br/>
🎧 The girls laughed nervously as the plane started rolling down the runway. <br/> 
🎧 They went faster and faster, trees passing by quickly. <br/> 
🎧 There was a powerful surge making everyone's head jerk back. <br/> 
🎧 The plane started lifting off the ground. <br/> 
🎧 Up, up, and away!<br/> 
🎧 They were up off the ground and flying high in the sky! It seemed as though they could get anywhere within a matter of seconds. <br/> 
🎧 They flew from Grimsby to Beamsville where they saw their high school. <br/> 
🎧 Then, on to St. <br/> 
🎧 Catharines and then Niagara Falls. <br/> 
🎧 They even flew over top of their house! They took pictures of their house. <br/> 
🎧 They could see their pond from way up there, too.<br/>
🎧 The pilot asked Tasha if she wanted to fly the plane. <br/> 
🎧 "Sure!" Tasha said. <br/> 
🎧 So, Tasha took the steering handle and began to fly the plane. <br/> 
🎧 She didn't really know how to fly it, so when she pulled the handle down, the plane shot upward. <br/> 
🎧 Both of the girls squealed.<br/>
🎧 Tasha levelled the plane and flew smoothly from then on.<br/>
🎧 Soon it was time to go back to Grimsby. <br/> 
🎧 The pilot took over again. <br/> 
🎧 We braced ourselves as the landing strip got nearer. <br/> 
🎧 The landing went smoothly with Tasha and Tawnya beaming as they looked out at the ground. <br/> 
🎧 They hopped off of the plane, thanked the pilot and ran to tell their mom about their wonderful experience

🎧 The clouds were very gray. <br/> 
🎧 There was a loud boom that came from the sky. <br/> 
🎧 A bolt of lightning struck down a tree. <br/> 
🎧 All of a sudden buckets of rain came pouring down!<br/> 
🎧 Jane and Bill were walking in a park when the rain started. <br/> 
🎧 Jane wanted to take pictures of the flowers, but the rain got her camera wet. <br/> 
🎧 She had to put it away so that it wouldn't get ruined.<br/>
🎧 Jane was going to hide under a big tree to stay dry, but Bill told her that was not a safe idea. <br/> 
🎧 He said that she could get hurt if the lightning hit the tree. <br/> 
🎧 The tree could break and fall on her, or the lightning could even hit her!<br/> 
🎧 The air was very chilly. <br/> 
🎧 Jane and Bill put on their sweaters and raincoats to keep warm.<br/>
🎧 Jane took her umbrella out and put it up. <br/> 
🎧 They both walked under it to stay dry.<br/>
🎧 The ground was really wet and muddy. <br/> 
🎧 Bill and Jane were very glad that they remembered to wear their boots. <br/> 
🎧 They ran through the puddles, getting mud and water all over the back of their pants.<br/>
🎧 As they were running and having fun, they saw some ducks. <br/> 
🎧 There were five of them splashing around in a pond. <br/> 
🎧 The ducks were not afraid of water; they swim in the water all the time!<br/> 
🎧 Jane and Bill saw some big bull frogs near the pond. <br/> 
🎧 The frogs jumped into the pond when they heard Jane and Bill coming.<br/>
🎧 After a little while Jane and Bill decided to go home. <br/> 
🎧 They got into some dry clothes.<br/>
🎧 Jane started to sneeze. <br/> 
🎧 She had gotten a little bit too wet!<br/> 
🎧 Bill noticed that the rain had stopped. <br/> 
🎧 "Look outside Jane," he said. <br/> 
🎧 Jane wrapped a blanket around her shoulders and looked outside. <br/> 
🎧 There was a beautiful, bright rainbow across the sky Violet, blue, green, yellow, orange and red, the rainbow shone high in the sky. <br/> 
🎧 "I wonder if there's a pot of gold on the other side?" Jane asked. <br/> 
🎧 She had once been told that Leprechauns lived on the other side handing out money to those that made it to the rainbow's end.<br/>
🎧 Bill didn't believe there was a pot of gold. <br/> 
🎧 Jane ignored Bill though and started off across the field, to claim her big pot of money.<br/>
🎧 Let's hope Jane finds her way back home, safe and sound, with a big pot of gold

🎧 I go to Gainsborough Public Elementary School. <br/> 
🎧 I am in Grade 8. <br/> 
🎧 I am known as the<br/> "King/Queen" of the school this year. <br/> 
🎧 I feel very grown up. <br/> 
🎧 I love being the oldest kid in the school. <br/> 
🎧 My friends and I are told that we are examples to the younger kids in the school. <br/> 
🎧 That means we need to be good. <br/> 
🎧 I remember looking up to the grade eight kids when I was younger. <br/> 
🎧 I remember thinking how big and wise they seemed to be. <br/> 
🎧 Now that I'm in grade eight, I hope that the younger kids see me as wise.<br/>
🎧 I want to be a music teacher or maybe a nurse. <br/> 
🎧 My school counsellor helps me plan for high school. <br/> 
🎧 I am nervous because I know I will not feel like the "King" anymore. <br/> 
🎧 Things will be so different. <br/> 
🎧 I am excited because I will be meeting so many new people!<br/> 
🎧 I am looking forward to my graduation. <br/> 
🎧 I will wear a pink, silky dress. <br/> 
🎧 My shoes are a light pink, too. <br/> 
🎧 My date's name is Chad. <br/> 
🎧 He is very nice. <br/> 
🎧 He is a good friend. <br/> 
🎧 I have known Chad since I was a little girl.<br/>
🎧 I know that my future will be a bright one. <br/> 
🎧 I will miss all of my friends but I know we will see each other again someday

🎧 I am the middle child of the family. <br/> 
🎧 I think it is nice in some ways.<br/>
🎧 I have an older sister from whom I can borrow clothes from, if she lets me.<br/>
🎧 I get to meet my older sister's friends, although sometimes they think that I am too young to be with them.<br/>
🎧 I have a younger brother.<br/>
🎧 He is cute, but sometimes I have to baby-sit him.<br/>
🎧 There are good things and bad things about being the middle child.<br/>
🎧 My sister is the eldest child.<br/>
🎧 She was the first child, so she spent time alone with my parents.<br/>
🎧 She got lots of attention when she was first born.<br/>
🎧 They took lots and lots of pictures of her.<br/>
🎧 All her clothes and toys were brand new.<br/>
🎧 I got her hand-me-downs.<br/>
🎧 My parents were the strictest with her.<br/>
🎧 They had lots of rules for her to follow.<br/>
🎧 She is the first child, so they want her to be perfect.<br/>
🎧 My younger brother is the baby of the family.<br/>
🎧 I think that we all spoil him.<br/>
🎧 We let him get away with some things that he shouldn't get away with.<br/>
🎧 His room is always messy, and my mother never gets mad about that.<br/>
🎧 She gets upset with me if my room is messy.<br/>
🎧 She tells me that I'm old enough to keep a nice clean room.<br/>
🎧 It's no good thinking about which position you would like to hold in the family.<br/>
🎧 You really don't have a choice about that.<br/>
🎧 I think I like being the middle child.<br/>
🎧 I can relate to my older sister and my younger brother.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I think the middle is probably a good place to be

🎧 My advice to a student from a foreign country would be to talk, talk, talk.<br/>
🎧 Talk as much as you can to the people who live in the place that you are visiting.<br/>
🎧 Talk to them and practice your new language skills.<br/>
🎧 Learn all the funny sayings and different words that make up their language.<br/>
🎧 Talking is the only way to really learn a language.<br/>
🎧 Listen to people and talk to people.<br/>
🎧 If you talk to people, you will also learn about their culture.<br/>
🎧 I have a friend from Japan.<br/>
🎧 His name is Nori.<br/>
🎧 He often comes to see me just so that he can practice his English.<br/>
🎧 He gets confused about words that sound the same, but mean different things.<br/>
🎧 He was asking me about the words "see" and "sea."<br/> 
🎧 I explained to him that they do sound the same, but they are spelled differently, and they mean different things.<br/>
🎧 Nori is learning some of our funny sayings from different people.<br/>
🎧 One morning I asked him how he was, and he said "alive and kicking."<br/> 
🎧 Another morning when I asked him how he was, he said "so so." <br/> 
🎧 He laughs about these strange sayings that we use.<br/>
🎧 He is learning English quickly because he spends a lot of time with English-speaking people.<br/>
🎧 He likes to have lunch with my friends and me because we ask him questions about his homeland, and he answers us in English.<br/>
🎧 If he doesn't understand our questions, we spend time explaining what we mean to him.<br/>
🎧 He says that he enjoys being here.<br/>
🎧 He thinks that the people are very friendly.<br/>
🎧 We enjoy speaking to him and helping him to learn English.<br/>
🎧 We also enjoy learning about his country.<br/>
🎧 It is enjoyable for us to meet new people and learn about new things

🎧 One dark and gloomy night, I was sitting in my bedroom reading ghost stories.<br/>
🎧 The stories were very scary.<br/>
🎧 A storm was brewing outside my window.<br/>
🎧 The wind began to howl, and the trees shook and bent in the wind.<br/>
🎧 Lightening started to flash across the sky.<br/>
🎧 I felt uneasy as I heard the low rumble of thunder.<br/>
🎧 I glanced around my room.<br/>
🎧 The shadows were deep and dark.<br/>
🎧 The ghost stories were making my imagination play tricks on me.<br/>
🎧 I thought that the shadows were moving.<br/>
🎧 I looked under my bed to make sure that nothing was under there.<br/>
🎧 I hid under the covers and peeked out.<br/>
🎧 I was starting to hear things.<br/>
🎧 A big streak of lightening flashed across the sky, and a loud clap of thunder made me jump.<br/>
🎧 I was very nervous.<br/>
🎧 All of a sudden, I heard a noise.<br/>
🎧 It was coming from my closet.<br/>
🎧 I thought that it must be a ghost.<br/>
🎧 I looked out from under my covers and waited for the ghost to appear.<br/>
🎧 My face was white, and I was very, very scared.<br/>
🎧 Then, I heard the noise again.<br/>
🎧 Yes, there was definitely a rustling in my closet.<br/>
🎧 I stayed very still and did not make a sound.<br/>
🎧 I watched the closet and hoped that the ghost would not come flying out at me.<br/>
🎧 Something started to come out of the closet.<br/>
🎧 I squeezed my eyes shut.<br/>
🎧 I didn't dare to look at the ghost.<br/>
🎧 I heard it come out of the closet.<br/>
🎧 I felt it jump up on my bed.<br/>
🎧 I was still too scared to look.<br/>
🎧 Then the ghost made a noise.<br/>
🎧 It said, "meow." <br/> 
🎧 I opened my eyes and saw my kitten standing there.<br/>
🎧 It was my kitten that had made the rustling noises in the closet.<br/>
🎧 I laughed and felt very foolish.<br/>
🎧 I have decided not to read ghost stories on dark stormy nights.<br/>
