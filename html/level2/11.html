🎧 My <span>friend</span> <span>Lani</span> and I <span>went</span> to <span>Burger</span> <span>King</span> <span>yesterday</span>. <br/> 
🎧 We <span>ordered</span> a big <span>order</span> of <span>french</span> <span>fries</span> and a <span>couple</span> of <span>drinks</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Lani</span> got a <span>strawberry</span> <span>milkshake</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>picked</span> out a <span>table</span> <span>near</span> the <span>window</span> so we <span>could</span> look at the people <span>passing</span> by. <br/> 
🎧 <span>As</span> we were <span>sitting</span> there, we <span>heard</span> our <span>favourite</span> <span>song</span>, <span>"Butterfly"</span> by the <span>band</span> <span>Crazy</span> <span>Town</span> come on the <span>radio</span>. <br/> 
🎧 We <span>looked</span> at each other with big <span>grins</span> on our <span>faces</span> and <span>started</span> <span>singing</span> and <span>dancing!<br/></span> 
🎧 It was great fun. <br/> 
🎧 many people <span>began</span> <span>staring</span> at us, <span>wondering</span> why we were so happy. <br/> 
🎧 We didn't <span>care;</span> we just <span>kept</span> on <span>moving</span> and <span>enjoying</span> <span>ourselves</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>song</span> <span>ended</span>, and we were almost <span>finished</span> our food. <br/> 
🎧 We <span>sat</span> and <span>talked</span> about what was <span>happening</span> in our <span>lives</span>. <br/> 
🎧 She had just <span>bought</span> <span>four</span> new <span>t-shirts</span> for the <span>summer</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The new <span>sandals</span> she had <span>gotten</span> for her <span>birthday</span> had <span>given</span> her really bad <span>blisters</span> on the <span>sides</span> of her <span>feet</span>. <br/> 
🎧 When she <span>wore</span> other <span>shoes</span>, she had to <span>wear</span> <span>bandaids</span> on the <span>blisters</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I told her that I had <span>bought</span> <span>four</span> new <span>C.D.'s</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I love music! <br/> 
🎧 <span>As</span> we <span>finished</span> our <span>conversation</span>, we <span>finished</span> off our <span>drinks</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I like going out with <span>Lani</span> and talking. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Lani</span> is my best <span>friend</span> and I can talk to her about anything. <br/> 
🎧 I am <span>glad</span> I have her to share my life with, even if it is as <span>simple</span> as going to <span>Burger</span> <span>King</span> and <span>eating</span> <span>french</span> <span>fries!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Lani</span> and I are planning to <span>travel</span> <span>together</span> so we are <span>trying</span> to <span>save</span> our money. <br/> 
🎧 Our <span>french</span> <span>fries</span> and <span>drink</span> only came to about <span>$6</span>, so we didn't feel too bad about <span>spending</span> our <span>money!<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>wonder</span> <span>though</span>, if <span>McDonald's</span> would have been <span>cheaper?<br/>

🎧 <span>Tasha</span> <span>signed</span> a <span>piece</span> of <span>paper</span> which gave her a <span>chance</span> to win a <span>free</span> air <span>plane</span> <span>ride</span>. <br/> 
🎧 She put her <span>name</span>, <span>address</span> and <span>telephone</span> <span>number</span> on that <span>piece</span> of <span>paper</span>. <br/> 
🎧 A few <span>days</span> later she got a <span>telephone</span> <span>call</span>. <br/> 
🎧 It was the man that was <span>holding</span> the <span>ticket</span> <span>draw</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Tasha</span> didn't think she would win, but the man on the <span>telephone</span> said she <span>did!<br/></span> 
🎧 She <span>listened</span> as the man told her where she would have to go to get her <span>free</span> air <span>plane</span> <span>ride</span>.<br/>
🎧 She had to go <span>near</span> the <span>town</span> of <span>Grimsby</span>. <br/> 
🎧 She was <span>allowed</span> to <span>pick</span> a <span>friend</span> to go with her on the air <span>plane</span> <span>ride</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Tasha</span> was so happy! She <span>asked</span> her <span>twin</span> <span>sister</span> <span>Tawnya</span> to go with her. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Tawnya</span> was very <span>excited</span>! <span>Neither</span> of them had been on an air <span>plane</span> before.<br/>
🎧 When they got to the air <span>plane</span> <span>centre</span>, <span>Tasha</span> and <span>Tawnya</span> were <span>nervous</span>. <br/> 
🎧 They <span>knew</span> the air <span>plane</span> was small so that <span>meant</span> only the <span>pilot</span> and them were going to be in the <span>plane</span>.<br/>
🎧 Their mom took a <span>picture</span> of them <span>beside</span> the <span>plane</span> before they <span>left</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Tasha</span> and <span>Tawnya</span> <span>hopped</span> into the <span>plane</span>. <br/> 
🎧 They put their <span>seatbelts</span> on and got <span>ready</span> for <span>take-off</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Tasha</span> got to sit in the very <span>front</span>, right <span>beside</span> the <span>pilot</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Tawnya</span> <span>sat</span> <span>behind</span> <span>Tasha</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>girls</span> <span>laughed</span> <span>nervously</span> as the <span>plane</span> <span>started</span> <span>rolling</span> <span>down</span> the <span>runway</span>. <br/> 
🎧 They <span>went</span> <span>faster</span> and <span>faster</span>, <span>trees</span> <span>passing</span> by <span>quickly</span>. <br/> 
🎧 There was a <span>powerful</span> <span>surge</span> <span>making</span> <span>everyone's</span> <span>head</span> <span>jerk</span> back. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>plane</span> <span>started</span> <span>lifting</span> off the <span>ground</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Up</span>, up, and <span>away!<br/></span> 
🎧 They were up off the <span>ground</span> and <span>flying</span> high in the sky! It <span>seemed</span> as <span>though</span> they <span>could</span> get <span>anywhere</span> <span>within</span> a <span>matter</span> of <span>seconds</span>. <br/> 
🎧 They <span>flew</span> from <span>Grimsby</span> to <span>Beamsville</span> where they saw their high school. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Then</span>, on to <span>St</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Catharines</span> and then <span>Niagara</span> <span>Falls</span>. <br/> 
🎧 They even <span>flew</span> over top of their house! They took <span>pictures</span> of their house. <br/> 
🎧 They <span>could</span> see their <span>pond</span> from way up there, <span>too</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>pilot</span> <span>asked</span> <span>Tasha</span> if she <span>wanted</span> to fly the <span>plane</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>"Sure!"</span> <span>Tasha</span> said. <br/> 
🎧 So, <span>Tasha</span> took the <span>steering</span> <span>handle</span> and <span>began</span> to fly the <span>plane</span>. <br/> 
🎧 She didn't really know how to fly it, so when she <span>pulled</span> the <span>handle</span> <span>down</span>, the <span>plane</span> <span>shot</span> <span>upward</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Both of the <span>girls</span> <span>squealed</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Tasha</span> <span>levelled</span> the <span>plane</span> and <span>flew</span> <span>smoothly</span> from then on.<br/>
🎧 <span>Soon</span> it was time to go back to <span>Grimsby</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>pilot</span> took over again. <br/> 
🎧 We <span>braced</span> <span>ourselves</span> as the <span>landing</span> <span>strip</span> got <span>nearer</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>landing</span> <span>went</span> <span>smoothly</span> with <span>Tasha</span> and <span>Tawnya</span> <span>beaming</span> as they <span>looked</span> out at the <span>ground</span>. <br/> 
🎧 They <span>hopped</span> off of the <span>plane</span>, <span>thanked</span> the <span>pilot</span> and ran to tell their mom about their <span>wonderful</span> <span>experience.<br/>

🎧 The <span>clouds</span> were very <span>gray</span>. <br/> 
🎧 There was a <span>loud</span> <span>boom</span> that came from the sky. <br/> 
🎧 A <span>bolt</span> of <span>lightning</span> <span>struck</span> <span>down</span> a <span>tree</span>. <br/>

🎧 <span>Jane</span> and <span>Bill</span> were <span>walking</span> in a <span>park</span> when the <span>rain</span> <span>started</span>. <br/>

🎧 She had to put it away so that it wouldn't get <span>ruined</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Jane</span> was going to <span>hide</span> under a big <span>tree</span> to <span>stay</span> dry, but <span>Bill</span> told her that was not a <span>safe</span> <span>idea</span>. <br/> 
🎧 He said that she <span>could</span> get <span>hurt</span> if the <span>lightning</span> hit the <span>tree</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>tree</span> <span>could</span> <span>break</span> and <span>fall</span> on her, or the <span>lightning</span> <span>could</span> even hit <span>her!<br/></span>

🎧 They ran <span>through</span> the <span>puddles</span>, getting mud and water all over the back of their <span>pants</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>As</span> they were <span>running</span> and <span>having</span> fun, they saw some <span>ducks</span>. <br/> 
🎧 There were <span>five</span> of them <span>splashing</span> around in a <span>pond</span>. <br/>

🎧 My advice to a <span>student</span> from a <span>foreign</span> <span>country</span> would be to talk, talk, talk.<br/>
🎧 <span>Talk</span> as much as you can to the people who live in the place that you are <span>visiting</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Talk</span> to them and <span>practice</span> your new <span>language</span> <span>skills</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Learn</span> all the funny <span>sayings</span> and different <span>words</span> that make up their <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Talking</span> is the only way to really learn a <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Listen</span> to people and talk to people.<br/>
🎧 If you talk to people, you will also learn about their <span>culture</span>.<br/>

🎧 His <span>name</span> is <span>Nori</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>often</span> <span>comes</span> to see me just so that he can <span>practice</span> his <span>English</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>gets</span> <span>confused</span> about <span>words</span> that sound the same, but mean different things.<br/>
🎧 He was <span>asking</span> me about the <span>words</span> <span>"see"</span> and <span>"sea."<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>explained</span> to him that they do sound the same, but they are <span>spelled</span> <span>differently</span>, and they mean different things.<br/>
🎧 <span>Nori</span> is <span>learning</span> some of our funny <span>sayings</span> from different people.<br/>
🎧 One morning I <span>asked</span> him how he was, and he said <span>"alive</span> and <span>kicking."<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Another</span> morning when I <span>asked</span> him how he was, he said <span>"so</span> <span>so."</span> <br/> 
🎧 He <span>laughs</span> about these <span>strange</span> <span>sayings</span> that we <span>use</span>.<br/>
🎧 He is <span>learning</span> <span>English</span> <span>quickly</span> <span>because</span> he <span>spends</span> a lot of time with <span>English-speaking</span> people.<br/>
🎧 He <span>likes</span> to have lunch with my <span>friends</span> and me <span>because</span> we ask him <span>questions</span> about his <span>homeland</span>, and he <span>answers</span> us in <span>English</span>.<br/>
🎧 If he doesn't <span>understand</span> our <span>questions</span>, we <span>spend</span> time <span>explaining</span> what we mean to him.<br/>
🎧 He <span>says</span> that he <span>enjoys</span> being here.<br/>
🎧 He <span>thinks</span> that the people are very <span>friendly</span>.<br/>
🎧 We enjoy <span>speaking</span> to him and <span>helping</span> him to learn <span>English</span>.<br/>
🎧 We also enjoy <span>learning</span> about his <span>country</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is <span>enjoyable</span> for us to <span>meet</span> new people and learn about new <span>things.<br/>

🎧 One <span>dark</span> and <span>gloomy</span> <span>night</span>, I was <span>sitting</span> in my <span>bedroom</span> <span>reading</span> <span>ghost</span> <span>stories</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>stories</span> were very <span>scary</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>storm</span> was <span>brewing</span> <span>outside</span> my <span>window</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>wind</span> <span>began</span> to <span>howl</span>, and the <span>trees</span> <span>shook</span> and <span>bent</span> in the <span>wind</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Lightening</span> <span>started</span> to <span>flash</span> across the <span>sky</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>felt</span> <span>uneasy</span> as I <span>heard</span> the low <span>rumble</span> of <span>thunder</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>glanced</span> around my <span>room</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>shadows</span> were <span>deep</span> and <span>dark</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>ghost</span> <span>stories</span> were <span>making</span> my <span>imagination</span> play <span>tricks</span> on me.<br/>
🎧 I <span>thought</span> that the <span>shadows</span> were <span>moving</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>looked</span> under my bed to make sure that <span>nothing</span> was under there.<br/>
🎧 I hid under the <span>covers</span> and <span>peeked</span> out.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>starting</span> to hear things.<br/>
🎧 A big <span>streak</span> of <span>lightening</span> <span>flashed</span> across the sky, and a <span>loud</span> <span>clap</span> of <span>thunder</span> made me <span>jump</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was very <span>nervous</span>.<br/>
🎧 All of a <span>sudden</span>, I <span>heard</span> a <span>noise</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>coming</span> from my <span>closet</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>thought</span> that it <span>must</span> be a <span>ghost</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>looked</span> out from under my <span>covers</span> and <span>waited</span> for the <span>ghost</span> to <span>appear</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>face</span> was <span>white</span>, and I was very, very <span>scared</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Then</span>, I <span>heard</span> the <span>noise</span> again.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yes</span>, there was <span>definitely</span> a <span>rustling</span> in my <span>closet</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>stayed</span> very still and did not make a sound.<br/>
🎧 I <span>watched</span> the <span>closet</span> and <span>hoped</span> that the <span>ghost</span> would not come <span>flying</span> out at me.<br/>
🎧 Something <span>started</span> to come out of the <span>closet</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>squeezed</span> my <span>eyes</span> <span>shut</span>.<br/>
🎧 I didn't <span>dare</span> to look at the <span>ghost</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>heard</span> it come out of the <span>closet</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>felt</span> it <span>jump</span> up on my <span>bed</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was still too <span>scared</span> to look.<br/>
🎧 <span>Then</span> the <span>ghost</span> made a <span>noise</span>.<br/>
🎧 It said, <span>"meow."</span> <br/> 
🎧 I <span>opened</span> my <span>eyes</span> and saw my <span>kitten</span> <span>standing</span> there.<br/>
🎧 It was my <span>kitten</span> that had made the <span>rustling</span> <span>noises</span> in the <span>closet</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>laughed</span> and <span>felt</span> very <span>foolish</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have <span>decided</span> not to read <span>ghost</span> <span>stories</span> on <span>dark</span> <span>stormy</span> <span>nights</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think my <span>imagination</span> <span>plays</span> <span>tricks</span> on me when I read <span>ghost</span> <span>stories</span> on <span>nights</span> like <span>that.<br/>
