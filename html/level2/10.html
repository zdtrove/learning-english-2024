🎧 <span>People</span> have often <span>wondered</span> about <span>whether</span> or not there is life <span>beyond</span> the <span>planet</span> <span>Earth</span>.<br/>
🎧 For years, the idea of <span>intelligent</span> life on other <span>planets</span> has been very <span>popular</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Many books and <span>movies</span> tell <span>stories</span> of what those <span>forms</span> of life might be like.<br/>
🎧 Many <span>scientists</span> <span>believe</span> that very simple <span>forms</span> of life are <span>likely</span> to <span>exist</span> on many other <span>planets</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Under</span> the right <span>conditions</span>, simple life <span>forms</span> might <span>arise</span>. <br/> 
🎧 those <span>conditions</span>, which <span>include</span> <span>moisture</span> and <span>warmth</span>, might <span>occur</span> in many <span>parts</span> of the <span>universe</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Fewer</span> <span>scientists</span> <span>believe</span> that very <span>intelligent</span> <span>forms</span> of life are <span>likely</span> to <span>exist</span> on many other <span>planets</span>. <br/> 
🎧 For <span>intelligent</span> life to <span>evolve</span>, a very long <span>period</span> of time is <span>needed</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>During</span> that time, the <span>conditions</span> on a <span>planet</span> must not be too <span>harsh</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Otherwise</span>, the <span>evolving</span> life <span>forms</span> will <span>die</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The amount of water, <span>heat</span>, and <span>various</span> <span>chemicals</span> must be <span>"just</span> <span>right."</span> If not, then <span>complex</span> life might never <span>evolve</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>conditions</span> <span>needed</span> for <span>intelligent</span> life to <span>evolve</span> are very <span>unlikely</span> to <span>occur</span> on any one <span>planet</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>However</span>, some <span>scientists</span> <span>believe</span> that <span>intelligent</span> life might be <span>common</span> in the <span>universe</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Because there are so many <span>stars</span> and <span>planets</span> in the <span>universe</span>, there might be a few <span>places</span> that have <span>intelligent</span> life. <br/> 
🎧 <span>However</span>, those <span>places</span> are probably very, very far away.<br/>
🎧 <span>Other</span> <span>scientists</span> <span>disagree</span>. <br/> 
🎧 They think that the <span>conditions</span> <span>needed</span> for <span>intelligent</span> life are <span>extremely</span> <span>rare</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Because of this, our <span>planet</span> might be the only place that has <span>intelligent</span> <span>life</span>!<br/> 
🎧 So far, it is <span>impossible</span> to know <span>whether</span> or not there are <span>intelligent</span> <span>beings</span> on other <span>planets</span>. <br/> 
🎧 But even if those <span>beings</span> do <span>exist</span>, it <span>seems</span> very <span>unlikely</span> that we will ever meet <span>them

🎧 I often enjoy <span>reading</span> the <span>newspaper</span>. <br/> 
🎧 In my <span>city</span>, there are <span>three</span> different <span>newspapers</span>, <span>and</span> I look at different <span>newspapers</span> on different <span>days</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I find that each <span>section</span> of a <span>newspaper</span> has some <span>interesting</span> <span>information</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Most</span> <span>newspapers</span> <span>contain</span> <span>several</span> <span>sections</span> that can be <span>easily</span> <span>removed</span> from the <span>rest</span> of the <span>newspaper</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>main</span> <span>section</span> is <span>found</span> at the <span>front</span> of the <span>newspaper</span>. <br/> 
🎧 This <span>section</span> usually <span>contains</span> the most important <span>news</span> from around the <span>world</span>, from around the <span>nation</span>, and from the <span>local</span> <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes the <span>main</span> <span>section</span> also <span>includes</span> some <span>pages</span> that <span>contain</span> <span>opinions</span> about the <span>news</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>editors</span> of the <span>newspaper</span> <span>write</span> an <span>editorial</span> <span>opinion</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Other</span> <span>writers</span> <span>provide</span> many different <span>opinions</span> about <span>current</span> <span>events</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Also, some <span>readers</span> of the <span>newspaper</span> <span>write</span> <span>letters</span> to the <span>editor</span>, in which they <span>express</span> their <span>opinions</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>popular</span> <span>section</span> of the <span>newspaper</span> is the <span>sports</span> <span>section</span>. <br/> 
🎧 This <span>section</span> <span>contains</span> <span>information</span> about many different <span>sports</span> <span>events</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>sports</span> <span>section</span> <span>provides</span> <span>scores</span> and <span>results</span> from many <span>games</span> and <span>competitions</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>section</span> of the <span>newspaper</span> <span>contains</span> <span>information</span> about <span>entertainment</span> and the <span>arts</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>arts</span> and <span>entertainment</span> <span>section</span> tells <span>readers</span> about new <span>movies</span> and <span>plays</span>. <br/> 
🎧 It also <span>describes</span> new books, music <span>concerts</span>, and art <span>exhibits</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Most</span> <span>newspapers</span> also have a <span>business</span> <span>section</span>. <br/> 
🎧 This <span>section</span> <span>provides</span> <span>information</span> about new <span>business</span> <span>deals</span>, and about the <span>stock</span> <span>market</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Many people read the <span>business</span> <span>section</span> of the <span>newspaper</span> to <span>gain</span> <span>information</span> and advice about <span>investing</span> their money.<br/>
🎧 <span>Finally</span>, <span>newspapers</span> usually have a <span>section</span> for <span>classified</span> <span>advertisements</span>. <br/> 
🎧 This <span>section</span> <span>allows</span> people to <span>advertise</span> about things that they want to buy or sell. <br/>

🎧 In <span>North</span> <span>America</span>, many young people <span>attend</span> high school, <span>college</span>, or university. <br/> 
🎧 But during the <span>summer</span> <span>months</span>, most of those students work at a <span>summer</span> job.<br/>
🎧 For most students, there are no <span>classes</span> during the <span>months</span> of <span>July</span> and <span>August</span>, and sometimes <span>none</span> in May and <span>June</span> also. <br/> 
🎧 Having a <span>summer</span> job <span>allows</span> students to make money that they will need during the <span>rest</span> of the year. <br/> 
🎧 They need this money because it <span>costs</span> a lot of money to pay for university or <span>college</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Of course, students also want money to <span>spend</span> on things that are fun, also.<br/>
🎧 Many students have <span>summer</span> <span>jobs</span> that <span>involve</span> working with children. <br/> 
🎧 For example, some students work at <span>children's</span> <span>camps</span>, where they <span>teach</span> children <span>various</span> <span>skills</span> and <span>games</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some students work as <span>lifeguards</span>, at <span>swimming</span> <span>pools</span> and at <span>beaches</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some students do <span>heavy</span> work in their <span>summer</span> <span>jobs</span>. <br/> 
🎧 For example, some students find <span>jobs</span> as <span>construction</span> <span>workers</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Other</span> students work in <span>factories</span>, and some students work on <span>farms</span>. <br/> 
🎧 There are other students who find <span>jobs</span> <span>mowing</span> <span>lawns</span> or <span>collecting</span> <span>trash</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Quite</span> a few students work in <span>stores</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Some of these students have <span>jobs</span> as <span>cashiers</span>, and some have <span>jobs</span> <span>putting</span> <span>products</span> on <span>store</span> <span>shelves</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Other</span> students work in <span>restaurants</span>, as <span>waiters</span> or as <span>cooks</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Other</span> students work in <span>offices</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Some of them work as <span>assistants</span> for other <span>employees</span>.<br/>
🎧 Their <span>tasks</span> might <span>include</span> <span>typing</span> <span>letters</span>, <span>programming</span> <span>computers</span>, or <span>delivering</span> <span>mail</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some students enjoy their <span>summer</span> <span>jobs</span> very much, and they find those <span>jobs</span> to be a <span>pleasant</span> <span>break</span> from <span>studying</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Other</span> students do not really enjoy <span>summer</span> <span>jobs</span>, but find their <span>jobs</span> to be a nice way to make new friends. <br/> 
🎧 But <span>nearly</span> all students who have <span>summer</span> <span>jobs</span> are <span>pleased</span> to have the <span>chance</span> to <span>earn</span> some <span>extra</span> <span>money

🎧 Many people enjoy the <span>experience</span> of going out to eat at a <span>restaurant</span>. <br/> 
🎧 It is <span>enjoyable</span> to eat <span>one's</span> <span>favourite</span> <span>foods</span>, or to try some <span>entirely</span> new food. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Going</span> out to a <span>restaurant</span> is also fun because it <span>allows</span> a change from the <span>usual</span> <span>routine</span> of <span>eating</span> at home.<br/>
🎧 There are many different <span>kinds</span> of <span>restaurants</span>. <br/> 
🎧 One <span>popular</span> <span>type</span> of <span>restaurant</span> is the <span>fastfood</span> <span>restaurant</span>. <br/> 
🎧 When <span>ordering</span> <span>fast-food</span>, you must first wait in <span>line</span> at the <span>front</span> of the <span>restaurant</span>, and then order food from the <span>counter</span>. <br/> 
🎧 After <span>paying</span>, the food is quickly <span>delivered</span>, and you can then take the food to a <span>table</span>, where you can enjoy your <span>meal</span>.<br/>
🎧 In most <span>restaurants</span>, you don't have to go to a <span>counter</span> to order your food. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Instead</span>, you are taken to a <span>table</span> soon after <span>entering</span> the <span>restaurant</span>. <br/> 
🎧 There, a <span>waiter</span> comes to give you a <span>menu</span>. <br/> 
🎧 You can choose your <span>meal</span> from the <span>foods</span> that are <span>listed</span> on the <span>menu</span>. <br/> 
🎧 After <span>ordering</span>, it takes some time to <span>prepare</span> your food. <br/> 
🎧 After a while, the <span>waiter</span> <span>brings</span> your <span>meal</span> to the <span>table</span>. <br/> 
🎧 When you are <span>finished</span> <span>eating</span>, the <span>waiter</span> <span>brings</span> the <span>"bill"</span> or <span>"check"</span>.<br/>
🎧 You then pay for the <span>meal</span>, and leave some <span>extra</span> money as a <span>"tip"</span> for the <span>waiter</span>.<br/>
🎧 In some other <span>restaurants</span>, the <span>waiter</span> does not <span>bring</span> the <span>meal</span> to your <span>table</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Instead</span>, after you are taken to a <span>table</span>, you then go to a <span>counter</span> called a <span>"buffet."</span> There you can <span>select</span> different <span>types</span> of <span>foods</span>, such as <span>salads</span>, <span>soups</span>, <span>meats</span>, <span>breads</span>, <span>vegetables</span>, and <span>desserts</span>.<br/>
🎧 After <span>putting</span> the food on your <span>plate</span>, you <span>return</span> to your <span>table</span>. <br/> 
🎧 After <span>eating</span>, you can <span>return</span> to the <span>buffet</span> to get more food.<br/>
🎧 <span>Other</span> <span>restaurants</span> can be very <span>fancy</span>. <br/> 
🎧 They may have <span>beautiful</span> <span>decorations</span>, and they may have food that is <span>prepared</span> by <span>expert</span> <span>chefs</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>These</span> <span>restaurants</span> may also <span>serve</span> fine <span>wines</span> with the food. <br/> 
🎧 Of course, these <span>restaurants</span> are very <span>expensive</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>At</span> these <span>restaurants</span>, it is often <span>necessary</span> to <span>reserve</span> a <span>table</span> by <span>telephoning</span> the <span>restaurant</span> in <span>advance</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Different</span> <span>restaurants</span> <span>specialize</span> in different <span>kinds</span> of food. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Fast-food</span> <span>restaurants</span> may <span>specialize</span> in <span>hamburgers</span> or <span>chicken</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Some <span>restaurants</span> <span>specialize</span> in <span>steak</span> or <span>seafood</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Other</span> <span>restaurants</span> <span>specialize</span> in <span>foods</span> that <span>belong</span> to a <span>certain</span> <span>nationality</span>. <br/> 
🎧 For example, many <span>restaurants</span> <span>specialize</span> in <span>Italian</span>, <span>Mexican</span>, <span>Chinese</span>, <span>Indian</span>, or <span>Thai</span> food.<br/>
🎧 <span>Eating</span> out at a <span>restaurant</span> can be a fun and <span>tasty</span> <span>experience</span>. <br/> 
🎧 What is your <span>favourite</span> kind of <span>restaurant

🎧 When I drive in my car, I like to <span>turn</span> on the <span>radio</span>. <br/> 
🎧 By <span>listening</span> to the <span>radio</span>, I can enjoy music and learn the <span>latest</span> <span>news</span> while I am <span>travelling</span> from one place to another. <br/> 
🎧 Of course, you can also listen the <span>radio</span> at home, or even at work. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Listening</span> to the <span>radio</span> is a <span>popular</span> <span>activity</span> for many people, and each <span>city</span> has many different <span>radio</span> <span>stations</span>.<br/>

🎧 Although there are many <span>radio</span> <span>stations</span> that <span>provide</span> <span>news</span> and <span>opinions</span>, most <span>radio</span> <span>stations</span> are <span>mainly</span> <span>devoted</span> to playing music of some kind. <br/>

🎧 <span>Every</span> <span>society</span> has <span>laws</span> that <span>regulate</span> the way people <span>behave</span>. <br/> 
🎧 A good <span>citizen</span> should <span>obey</span> <span>laws</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>However</span>, there is more to being a good <span>citizen</span> than <span>merely</span> <span>obeying</span> <span>laws</span>. <br/> 
🎧 There are many other things that people can do to make their <span>society</span> a <span>pleasant</span> one for every person.<br/>
🎧 One way to be a good <span>citizen</span> is to be <span>polite</span> in everyday <span>activities</span>. <br/> 
🎧 For example, when <span>passing</span> through a <span>door</span>, a <span>considerate</span> person will <span>hold</span> the <span>door</span> open for a person who is <span>close</span> behind. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Holding</span> <span>doors</span> open is <span>especially</span> important when someone is <span>carrying</span> a <span>heavy</span> <span>load</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Being</span> a good <span>citizen</span> is very important when <span>travelling</span> on the <span>roads</span> and <span>streets</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Pedestrians</span>, <span>bicyclists</span>, and car <span>drivers</span> should all <span>follow</span> the <span>rules</span> of the <span>road</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Bicyclists</span> should <span>yield</span> to <span>pedestrians</span>, and car <span>drivers</span> should <span>yield</span> to both <span>bicyclists</span> and <span>pedestrians</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Drivers</span> should also <span>allow</span> other <span>drivers</span> to <span>merge</span> into their <span>lanes</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Also, <span>drivers</span> should <span>avoid</span> <span>honking</span> their <span>horns</span> <span>except</span> when this is <span>necessary</span>.<br/>
🎧 A good <span>citizen</span> will also <span>avoid</span> doing things that <span>interfere</span> with <span>others</span>. <br/> 
🎧 For example, a <span>considerate</span> person does not <span>smoke</span> <span>cigarettes</span> in <span>areas</span> where this might <span>irritate</span> <span>others</span>.<br/>
🎧 Also, a <span>polite</span> person <span>avoids</span> playing music so <span>loudly</span> that other people will be <span>annoyed</span>.<br/>
🎧 And of course, a good <span>citizen</span> <span>avoids</span> <span>littering</span> or <span>making</span> a <span>mess</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Other</span> <span>ways</span> of being a good <span>citizen</span> <span>involve</span> <span>greater</span> <span>effort</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Some people <span>serve</span> their <span>community</span> by doing <span>volunteer</span> work of some kind. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Other</span> people help by <span>donating</span> money to a <span>charity</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Another way to <span>serve</span> the <span>community</span> is to <span>donate</span> <span>blood</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Blood</span> <span>donors</span> are <span>needed</span> so that there will be enough <span>blood</span> <span>available</span> to help people who are <span>sick</span> or <span>injured</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Being</span> a good <span>citizen</span> is very <span>helpful</span> for the <span>community</span>, and it also <span>gives</span> a feeling of <span>satisfaction</span> and <span>pride

🎧 When people feel <span>sick</span>, they go to a <span>doctor</span>. <br/> 
🎧 But sometimes people visit the <span>doctor</span> even when they are not <span>sick</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Doctors</span> can <span>perform</span> a <span>medical</span> <span>"check-up"</span>, to find out if a person is <span>healthy</span>. <br/> 
🎧 By <span>performing</span> this <span>physical</span> <span>examination</span>, the <span>doctor</span> can <span>identify</span> any <span>health</span> <span>problems</span> that might be <span>developing</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>During</span> a <span>check-up</span>, the <span>doctor</span> <span>examines</span> your <span>eyes</span>, <span>ears</span>, and <span>throat</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>doctor</span> <span>uses</span> a small <span>flashlight</span> to <span>examine</span> the <span>eyes</span>, <span>ears</span>, and <span>throat</span>. <br/> 
🎧 It is important to make sure that the <span>eyes</span> <span>react</span> <span>normally</span> to changes in <span>light</span>. <br/> 
🎧 It is also important to make sure that the <span>ears</span> and <span>throat</span> have a <span>normal</span> <span>appearance</span>. <br/> 
🎧 When the <span>doctor</span> <span>examines</span> your <span>throat</span>, he or she will ask you open your <span>mouth</span> <span>wide</span> and say <span>"ah"</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>doctor</span> <span>uses</span> a <span>stethoscope</span> to <span>examine</span> the <span>patient's</span> <span>heartbeat</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>stethoscope</span> <span>hangs</span> around the <span>doctor's</span> <span>neck</span>. <br/> 
🎧 By <span>using</span> a <span>stethoscope</span>, a <span>doctor</span> can hear the <span>patient's</span> <span>heartbeat</span> very <span>clearly</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>While</span> <span>checking</span> the <span>patient's</span> <span>heart</span>, the <span>doctor</span> also <span>listens</span> <span>carefully</span> to make sure that the <span>patient's</span> <span>breathing</span> is <span>normal</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>doctor</span> also <span>checks</span> the <span>patient's</span> <span>blood</span> <span>pressure</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Blood</span> <span>pressure</span> is <span>measured</span> by <span>placing</span> a <span>cuff</span> around the arm. <br/> 
🎧 Air is then <span>pumped</span> into the <span>cuff</span>, and this <span>allows</span> <span>blood</span> <span>pressure</span> to be <span>measured</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Having very high <span>blood</span> <span>pressure</span>, or very low <span>blood</span> <span>pressure</span>, is not good for <span>one's</span> <span>health;</span> it is better to be <span>"in</span> <span>between"</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>part</span> of the <span>examination</span> is a <span>test</span> of the <span>reflexes</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>doctor</span> <span>tests</span> the <span>patient's</span> <span>reflexes</span> by <span>gently</span> <span>hitting</span> his of her <span>knee</span> with a small <span>hammer</span>. <br/> 
🎧 If a person has <span>normal</span> <span>reflexes</span>, the leg will <span>extend</span> <span>suddenly</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes a <span>doctor</span> may give <span>injections</span> <span>using</span> a <span>needle</span>, as an <span>extra</span> <span>part</span> of the <span>check-up</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>These</span> <span>injections</span>, called <span>vaccinations</span>, <span>prevent</span> the <span>patient</span> from <span>developing</span> <span>certain</span> <span>illnesses</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Medical</span> <span>check-ups</span> can help to <span>maintain</span> <span>health</span>, but people should also <span>maintain</span> their <span>health</span> by <span>leading</span> a <span>healthy</span> <span>lifestyle

🎧 I <span>grew</span> up in a small <span>town</span>. <br/> 
🎧 There were only about two <span>thousand</span> people who <span>lived</span> in the <span>town</span> where I <span>grew</span> up. <br/> 
🎧 When a <span>town</span> is very small, it is also called a <span>village</span>. <br/> 
🎧 My <span>village</span> was <span>surrounded</span> by many <span>farms</span> and many <span>lakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 The house where my <span>family</span> <span>lived</span> was near the <span>middle</span> of the <span>town</span>. <br/> 
🎧 On the <span>street</span> where we <span>lived</span>, most of the <span>houses</span> were <span>similar</span> in size, but many of them had different <span>shapes</span> and different <span>colors</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Each</span> house was <span>surrounded</span> by a <span>yard</span>, where people <span>grew</span> their <span>lawn</span> and their garden.<br/>
🎧 often, I would <span>walk</span> from my house to the <span>downtown</span> <span>part</span> of the <span>village</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>"Downtown"</span> is the <span>area</span> where the <span>stores</span> and <span>shops</span> of a <span>town</span> are <span>located</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Because I <span>lived</span> in a small <span>town</span>, it was a short <span>walk</span> to the <span>downtown</span> <span>area</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Along</span> the <span>main</span> <span>street</span>, there were <span>several</span> different <span>kinds</span> of <span>stores</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Some <span>stores</span> <span>sold</span> food, some <span>stores</span> <span>sold</span> <span>clothing</span>, and some <span>stores</span> <span>sold</span> <span>hardware</span> <span>(or</span> <span>building</span> <span>supplies)</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was also a short <span>walk</span> to the <span>schools</span> in my <span>town</span>. <br/> 
🎧 When I went to <span>elementary</span> school, it would take about ten <span>minutes</span> to <span>walk</span> to the school. <br/> 
🎧 Some of my friends <span>lived</span> on the same <span>street</span> where I <span>lived</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes, we <span>walked</span> to school together.<br/>
🎧 <span>During</span> the <span>summer</span> <span>months</span>, many people came from the big <span>city</span> to visit our <span>village</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The people <span>liked</span> to get away from the <span>busy</span> <span>streets</span> of the <span>city</span>. <br/> 
🎧 They <span>enjoyed</span> the <span>quietness</span> and the <span>slow</span> <span>pace</span> of <span>village</span> life. <br/> 
🎧 They also <span>liked</span> to <span>spend</span> their <span>vacations</span> near the <span>lakes</span> that were near the <span>village</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>People</span> from the <span>city</span> often said that people who live in <span>villages</span> <span>seemed</span> very <span>friendly</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I <span>grew</span> up, I <span>left</span> my <span>village</span>, and I went to work in a <span>larger</span> <span>town</span>. <br/> 
🎧 But sometimes I like to go back and visit the place where I <span>grew</span> <span>up

🎧 <span>During</span> the <span>1980s</span> and <span>1990s</span>, personal <span>computers</span> <span>became</span> very <span>widespread</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The use of the <span>computer</span> has <span>changed</span> <span>people's</span> <span>lifestyles</span> in <span>several</span> <span>ways</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Before</span> <span>1980</span>, <span>hardly</span> <span>anyone</span> <span>owned</span> a <span>computer</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Only</span> <span>governments</span> and large <span>companies</span> had <span>computers</span>. <br/> 
🎧 But <span>throughout</span> the <span>1980s</span> and <span>1990s</span>, <span>computers</span> <span>became</span> much <span>cheaper</span>, <span>faster</span>, and <span>smaller</span>, and they <span>held</span> much more <span>memory</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>More</span> and more people were able to <span>afford</span> to buy a <span>computer</span>. <br/> 
🎧 By the year <span>2000</span>, <span>computers</span> had become very <span>common</span>.<br/>
🎧 For many people, the personal <span>computer</span> is used <span>mainly</span> for <span>performing</span> <span>calculations</span> and for <span>word</span> <span>processing</span>. <br/> 
🎧 For example, people can <span>calculate</span> their <span>finances</span> on the <span>computer</span>.<br/>
🎧 They can also use the <span>computer</span> to <span>type</span> their <span>written</span> <span>documents</span>, such as <span>essays</span> or <span>letters</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>Other</span> people <span>prefer</span> <span>games</span> that <span>require</span> <span>fast</span> <span>reflexes</span> and fine <span>co-ordination</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Computer</span> <span>games</span> were very simple during the <span>early</span> <span>days</span> of the <span>1980s</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Today's</span> <span>computer</span> <span>games</span> show <span>detailed</span> <span>images</span> and sounds.<br/>
🎧 Another very <span>popular</span> use of <span>computers</span> <span>involves</span> <span>communication</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Many people keep in touch with their friends and <span>relatives</span> by <span>using</span> <span>electronic</span> <span>mail</span>, or <span>e-mail</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>E-mail</span> <span>allows</span> people to <span>send</span> <span>letters</span> <span>instantly</span> to people far away. <br/> 
🎧 It is even <span>possible</span> to <span>attach</span> <span>pictures</span> to <span>one's</span> <span>e-mail</span> <span>messages</span>.<br/>
🎧 Many people also like to use their <span>computer</span> to <span>gain</span> <span>information</span> on the <span>Internet</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>Internet</span> is a <span>vast</span> <span>network</span> of <span>electronic</span> <span>pages</span> where people can find <span>information</span> on many different <span>topics</span>. <br/>

🎧 In the <span>modern</span> age, people often travel long <span>distances</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes people travel for <span>reasons</span> <span>related</span> to their work. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes they travel as <span>tourists</span>. <br/> 
🎧 And sometimes people travel to visit <span>relatives</span> and friends.<br/>
🎧 There are many different <span>ways</span> that people can travel. <br/> 
🎧 Some <span>forms</span> of <span>transportation</span> move people along the <span>ground</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Other</span> <span>methods</span> of <span>transportation</span> move people across the water, or through the <span>air</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Airplanes</span> <span>provide</span> the <span>fastest</span> <span>method</span> of <span>travelling</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Modern</span> jet <span>airliners</span> travel at about <span>1000</span> <span>kilometres</span> <span>per</span> <span>hour</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>These</span> <span>airplanes</span> <span>cruise</span> through the <span>skies</span>, almost ten <span>kilometres</span> <span>above</span> the <span>level</span> of the sea. <br/> 
🎧 Jet <span>airplanes</span> <span>allow</span> people to travel great <span>distances</span> in a short time. <br/> 
🎧 For example, it is <span>possible</span> to fly across a great <span>ocean</span>, such as the <span>Pacific</span> or the <span>Atlantic</span>, in <span>several</span> hours.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ships</span> were once the only way to travel across the <span>oceans</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Before</span> <span>airplanes</span>, it took many <span>weeks</span> or <span>months</span> to travel around the <span>world</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Today, many people still travel by <span>ship</span> when <span>crossing</span> <span>smaller</span> <span>bodies</span> of water. <br/> 
🎧 Some <span>ships</span>, called <span>ferries</span>, <span>allow</span> people to <span>bring</span> their <span>cars</span> with them <span>onto</span> the <span>ship</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Some people also like to travel by <span>ship</span> as <span>part</span> of a <span>holiday</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>These</span> <span>holiday</span> <span>ships</span>, called <span>cruise</span> <span>ships</span>, <span>stop</span> in <span>several</span> <span>interesting</span> <span>ports</span> along the <span>voyage</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trains</span> are very <span>popular</span> in many <span>places</span>. <br/> 
🎧 In some <span>places</span>, such as <span>Japan</span> and <span>France</span>, <span>trains</span> travel at high <span>speeds</span> of about <span>300</span> <span>kilometres</span> <span>per</span> <span>hour</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>These</span> <span>trains</span> move people <span>throughout</span> the <span>country</span> very quickly and <span>efficiently</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Trains</span> are also used to move people over short <span>distances</span>, such as the <span>trip</span> from <span>one's</span> home to <span>one's</span> <span>workplace</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Buses</span> and <span>cars</span> are also <span>widely</span> used for <span>transportation</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Some people travel by bus or car for only short <span>trips</span>, but sometimes <span>buses</span> and <span>cars</span> are used for very long <span>journeys</span>. <br/> 
🎧 In <span>North</span> <span>America</span>, many people have <span>driven</span> across <span>Canada</span> or the <span>United</span> <span>States</span> in their <span>cars</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>wide</span>, <span>smooth</span> <span>roads</span> <span>allow</span> <span>cars</span> and <span>buses</span> to travel quickly from one place to another.<br/>
