🎧 <span>People</span> have <span>often</span> <span>wondered</span> about <span>whether</span> or not there is life <span>beyond</span> the <span>planet</span> <span>Earth</span>.<br/>
🎧 For years, the <span>idea</span> of <span>intelligent</span> life on other <span>planets</span> has been very <span>popular</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 many <span>books</span> and <span>movies</span> tell <span>stories</span> of what <span>those</span> <span>forms</span> of life <span>might</span> be like.<br/>
🎧 many <span>scientists</span> <span>believe</span> that very <span>simple</span> <span>forms</span> of life are <span>likely</span> to <span>exist</span> on many other <span>planets</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Under</span> the right <span>conditions</span>, <span>simple</span> life <span>forms</span> <span>might</span> <span>arise</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Those</span> <span>conditions</span>, which <span>include</span> <span>moisture</span> and <span>warmth</span>, <span>might</span> <span>occur</span> in many <span>parts</span> of the <span>universe</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Fewer</span> <span>scientists</span> <span>believe</span> that very <span>intelligent</span> <span>forms</span> of life are <span>likely</span> to <span>exist</span> on many other <span>planets</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 For <span>intelligent</span> life to <span>evolve</span>, a very long <span>period</span> of time is <span>needed</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>During</span> that time, the <span>conditions</span> on a <span>planet</span> <span>must</span> not be too <span>harsh</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Otherwise</span>, the <span>evolving</span> life <span>forms</span> will <span>die</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>amount</span> of water, <span>heat</span>, and <span>various</span> <span>chemicals</span> <span>must</span> be <span>"just</span> <span>right."</span> <span>If</span> not, then <span>complex</span> life <span>might</span> <span>never</span> <span>evolve</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>conditions</span> <span>needed</span> for <span>intelligent</span> life to <span>evolve</span> are very <span>unlikely</span> to <span>occur</span> on any one <span>planet</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>However</span>, some <span>scientists</span> <span>believe</span> that <span>intelligent</span> life <span>might</span> be <span>common</span> in the <span>universe</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Because</span> there are so many <span>stars</span> and <span>planets</span> in the <span>universe</span>, there <span>might</span> be a few <span>places</span> that have <span>intelligent</span> life. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>However</span>, <span>those</span> <span>places</span> are <span>probably</span> very, very far away.<br/>
🎧 <span>Other</span> <span>scientists</span> <span>disagree</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They think that the <span>conditions</span> <span>needed</span> for <span>intelligent</span> life are <span>extremely</span> <span>rare</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Because</span> of this, our <span>planet</span> <span>might</span> be the only <span>place</span> that has <span>intelligent</span> <span>life!<br/></span> 
🎧 So far, it is <span>impossible</span> to know <span>whether</span> or not there are <span>intelligent</span> <span>beings</span> on other <span>planets</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 But even if <span>those</span> <span>beings</span> do <span>exist</span>, it <span>seems</span> very <span>unlikely</span> that we will <span>ever</span> <span>meet</span> <span>them.<br/>

🎧 I <span>often</span> enjoy <span>reading</span> the <span>newspaper</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>In</span> my <span>city</span>, there are <span>three</span> different <span>newspapers</span>, <span>and<br/></span> I look at different <span>newspapers</span> on different <span>days</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I find that each <span>section</span> of a <span>newspaper</span> has some <span>interesting</span> <span>information</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Most</span> <span>newspapers</span> <span>contain</span> <span>several</span> <span>sections</span> that can be <span>easily</span> <span>removed</span> from the <span>rest</span> of the <span>newspaper</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>main</span> <span>section</span> is <span>found</span> at the <span>front</span> of the <span>newspaper</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 This <span>section</span> usually <span>contains</span> the most <span>important</span> <span>news</span> from around the <span>world</span>, from around the <span>nation</span>, and from the <span>local</span> <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span> the <span>main</span> <span>section</span> also <span>includes</span> some <span>pages</span> that <span>contain</span> <span>opinions</span> about the <span>news</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>editors</span> of the <span>newspaper</span> <span>write</span> an <span>editorial</span> <span>opinion</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Other</span> <span>writers</span> <span>provide</span> many different <span>opinions</span> about <span>current</span> <span>events</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Also, some <span>readers</span> of the <span>newspaper</span> <span>write</span> <span>letters</span> to the <span>editor</span>, in which they <span>express</span> their <span>opinions</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Another</span> <span>popular</span> <span>section</span> of the <span>newspaper</span> is the <span>sports</span> <span>section</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>Another</span> <span>section</span> of the <span>newspaper</span> <span>contains</span> <span>information</span> about <span>entertainment</span> and the <span>arts</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>arts</span> and <span>entertainment</span> <span>section</span> tells <span>readers</span> about new <span>movies</span> and <span>plays</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It also <span>describes</span> new <span>books</span>, music <span>concerts</span>, and art <span>exhibits</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>In</span> <span>North</span> <span>America</span>, many <span>young</span> people <span>attend</span> high school, <span>college</span>, or <span>university</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 But during the <span>summer</span> <span>months</span>, most of <span>those</span> <span>students</span> work at a <span>summer</span> job.<br/>
🎧 For most <span>students</span>, there are no <span>classes</span> during the <span>months</span> of <span>July</span> and <span>August</span>, and <span>sometimes</span> <span>none</span> in May and <span>June</span> also. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Having</span> a <span>summer</span> job <span>allows</span> <span>students</span> to make money that they will need during the <span>rest</span> of the year. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They need this money <span>because</span> it <span>costs</span> a lot of money to pay for <span>university</span> or <span>college</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Of</span> course, <span>students</span> also want money to <span>spend</span> on <span>things</span> that are fun, also.<br/>
🎧 many <span>students</span> have <span>summer</span> <span>jobs</span> that <span>involve</span> <span>working</span> with <span>children</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 For example, some <span>students</span> work at <span>children's</span> <span>camps</span>, where they <span>teach</span> <span>children</span> <span>various</span> <span>skills</span> and <span>games</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>students</span> work as <span>lifeguards</span>, at <span>swimming</span> <span>pools</span> and at <span>beaches</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>students</span> do <span>heavy</span> work in their <span>summer</span> <span>jobs</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 For example, some <span>students</span> find <span>jobs</span> as <span>construction</span> <span>workers</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Other</span> <span>students</span> work in <span>factories</span>, and some <span>students</span> work on <span>farms</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There are other <span>students</span> who find <span>jobs</span> <span>mowing</span> <span>lawns</span> or <span>collecting</span> <span>trash</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Quite</span> a few <span>students</span> work in <span>stores</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Some of these <span>students</span> have <span>jobs</span> as <span>cashiers</span>, and some have <span>jobs</span> <span>putting</span> <span>products</span> on <span>store</span> <span>shelves</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Other</span> <span>students</span> work in <span>restaurants</span>, as <span>waiters</span> or as <span>cooks</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Other</span> <span>students</span> work in <span>offices</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Some of them work as <span>assistants</span> for other <span>employees</span>.<br/>
🎧 Their <span>tasks</span> <span>might</span> <span>include</span> <span>typing</span> <span>letters</span>, <span>programming</span> <span>computers</span>, or <span>delivering</span> <span>mail</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>students</span> enjoy their <span>summer</span> <span>jobs</span> very much, and they find <span>those</span> <span>jobs</span> to be a <span>pleasant</span> <span>break</span> from <span>studying</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Other</span> <span>students</span> do not <span>really</span> enjoy <span>summer</span> <span>jobs</span>, but find their <span>jobs</span> to be a nice way to make new <span>friends</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 But <span>nearly</span> all <span>students</span> who have <span>summer</span> <span>jobs</span> are <span>pleased</span> to have the <span>chance</span> to <span>earn</span> some <span>extra</span> <span>money.<br/>

🎧 many people enjoy the <span>experience</span> of going out to eat at a <span>restaurant</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It is <span>enjoyable</span> to eat <span>one's</span> <span>favourite</span> <span>foods</span>, or to try some <span>entirely</span> new <span>food</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Going</span> out to a <span>restaurant</span> is also fun <span>because</span> it <span>allows</span> a <span>change</span> from the <span>usual</span> <span>routine</span> of <span>eating</span> at home.<br/>
🎧 There are many different <span>kinds</span> of <span>restaurants</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 One <span>popular</span> <span>type</span> of <span>restaurant</span> is the <span>fastfood</span> <span>restaurant</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 When <span>ordering</span> <span>fast-food</span>, you <span>must</span> <span>first</span> <span>wait</span> in <span>line</span> at the <span>front</span> of the <span>restaurant</span>, and then <span>order</span> <span>food</span> from the <span>counter</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>In</span> most <span>restaurants</span>, you don't have to go to a <span>counter</span> to <span>order</span> your <span>food</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Instead</span>, you are <span>taken</span> to a <span>table</span> soon after <span>entering</span> the <span>restaurant</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There, a <span>waiter</span> <span>comes</span> to give you a <span>menu</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 You can <span>choose</span> your <span>meal</span> from the <span>foods</span> that are <span>listed</span> on the <span>menu</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>After</span> <span>ordering</span>, it takes some time to <span>prepare</span> your <span>food</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>After</span> a <span>while</span>, the <span>waiter</span> <span>brings</span> your <span>meal</span> to the <span>table</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 When you are <span>finished</span> <span>eating</span>, the <span>waiter</span> <span>brings</span> the <span>"bill"</span> or <span>"check"</span>.<br/>
🎧 You then pay for the <span>meal</span>, and <span>leave</span> some <span>extra</span> money as a <span>"tip"</span> for the <span>waiter</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>In</span> some other <span>restaurants</span>, the <span>waiter</span> <span>does</span> not <span>bring</span> the <span>meal</span> to your <span>table</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Instead</span>, after you are <span>taken</span> to a <span>table</span>, you then go to a <span>counter</span> <span>called</span> a <span>"buffet."</span> There you can <span>select</span> different <span>types</span> of <span>foods</span>, such as <span>salads</span>, <span>soups</span>, <span>meats</span>, <span>breads</span>, <span>vegetables</span>, and <span>desserts</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>After</span> <span>putting</span> the <span>food</span> on your <span>plate</span>, you <span>return</span> to your <span>table</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>After</span> <span>eating</span>, you can <span>return</span> to the <span>buffet</span> to get more <span>food</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Other</span> <span>restaurants</span> can be very <span>fancy</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>These</span> <span>restaurants</span> may also <span>serve</span> <span>fine</span> <span>wines</span> with the <span>food</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Of</span> course, these <span>restaurants</span> are very <span>expensive</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>At</span> these <span>restaurants</span>, it is <span>often</span> <span>necessary</span> to <span>reserve</span> a <span>table</span> by <span>telephoning</span> the <span>restaurant</span> in <span>advance</span>.<br/>

🎧 Some <span>restaurants</span> <span>specialize</span> in <span>steak</span> or <span>seafood</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>Every</span> <span>society</span> has <span>laws</span> that <span>regulate</span> the way people <span>behave</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 A good <span>citizen</span> should <span>obey</span> <span>laws</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>However</span>, there is more to being a good <span>citizen</span> than <span>merely</span> <span>obeying</span> <span>laws</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There are many other <span>things</span> that people can do to make their <span>society</span> a <span>pleasant</span> one for <span>every</span> person.<br/>
🎧 One way to be a good <span>citizen</span> is to be <span>polite</span> in <span>everyday</span> <span>activities</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 For example, when <span>passing</span> <span>through</span> a <span>door</span>, a <span>considerate</span> person will <span>hold</span> the <span>door</span> <span>open</span> for a person who is <span>close</span> <span>behind</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Holding</span> <span>doors</span> <span>open</span> is <span>especially</span> <span>important</span> when <span>someone</span> is <span>carrying</span> a <span>heavy</span> <span>load</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Being</span> a good <span>citizen</span> is very <span>important</span> when <span>travelling</span> on the <span>roads</span> and <span>streets</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Pedestrians</span>, <span>bicyclists</span>, and car <span>drivers</span> should all <span>follow</span> the <span>rules</span> of the <span>road</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Bicyclists</span> should <span>yield</span> to <span>pedestrians</span>, and car <span>drivers</span> should <span>yield</span> to both <span>bicyclists</span> and <span>pedestrians</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Drivers</span> should also <span>allow</span> other <span>drivers</span> to <span>merge</span> into their <span>lanes</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Also, <span>drivers</span> should <span>avoid</span> <span>honking</span> their <span>horns</span> <span>except</span> when this is <span>necessary</span>.<br/>
🎧 A good <span>citizen</span> will also <span>avoid</span> doing <span>things</span> that <span>interfere</span> with <span>others</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 For example, a <span>considerate</span> person <span>does</span> not <span>smoke</span> <span>cigarettes</span> in <span>areas</span> where this <span>might</span> <span>irritate</span> <span>others</span>.<br/>
🎧 Also, a <span>polite</span> person <span>avoids</span> <span>playing</span> music so <span>loudly</span> that other people will be <span>annoyed</span>.<br/>
🎧 And of course, a good <span>citizen</span> <span>avoids</span> <span>littering</span> or <span>making</span> a <span>mess</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Other</span> <span>ways</span> of being a good <span>citizen</span> <span>involve</span> <span>greater</span> <span>effort</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Some people <span>serve</span> their <span>community</span> by doing <span>volunteer</span> work of some kind. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Other</span> people help by <span>donating</span> money to a <span>charity</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Another</span> way to <span>serve</span> the <span>community</span> is to <span>donate</span> <span>blood</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Blood</span> <span>donors</span> are <span>needed</span> so that there will be enough <span>blood</span> <span>available</span> to help people who are <span>sick</span> or <span>injured</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Being</span> a good <span>citizen</span> is very <span>helpful</span> for the <span>community</span>, and it also <span>gives</span> a <span>feeling</span> of <span>satisfaction</span> and <span>pride!<br/>

🎧 When people feel <span>sick</span>, they go to a <span>doctor</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 But <span>sometimes</span> people visit the <span>doctor</span> even when they are not <span>sick</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Doctors</span> can <span>perform</span> a <span>medical</span> <span>"check-up"</span>, to find out if a person is <span>healthy</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 By <span>performing</span> this <span>physical</span> <span>examination</span>, the <span>doctor</span> can <span>identify</span> any <span>health</span> <span>problems</span> that <span>might</span> be <span>developing</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>During</span> a <span>check-up</span>, the <span>doctor</span> <span>examines</span> your <span>eyes</span>, <span>ears</span>, and <span>throat</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>doctor</span> <span>uses</span> a small <span>flashlight</span> to <span>examine</span> the <span>eyes</span>, <span>ears</span>, and <span>throat</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It is <span>important</span> to make sure that the <span>eyes</span> <span>react</span> <span>normally</span> to <span>changes</span> in <span>light</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It is also <span>important</span> to make sure that the <span>ears</span> and <span>throat</span> have a <span>normal</span> <span>appearance</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 When the <span>doctor</span> <span>examines</span> your <span>throat</span>, he or she will ask you <span>open</span> your <span>mouth</span> <span>wide</span> and say <span>"ah"</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>doctor</span> <span>uses</span> a <span>stethoscope</span> to <span>examine</span> the <span>patient's</span> <span>heartbeat</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>stethoscope</span> <span>hangs</span> around the <span>doctor's</span> <span>neck</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 By <span>using</span> a <span>stethoscope</span>, a <span>doctor</span> can hear the <span>patient's</span> <span>heartbeat</span> very <span>clearly</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>While</span> <span>checking</span> the <span>patient's</span> <span>heart</span>, the <span>doctor</span> also <span>listens</span> <span>carefully</span> to make sure that the <span>patient's</span> <span>breathing</span> is <span>normal</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>doctor</span> also <span>checks</span> the <span>patient's</span> <span>blood</span> <span>pressure</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Blood</span> <span>pressure</span> is <span>measured</span> by <span>placing</span> a <span>cuff</span> around the arm. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Air is then <span>pumped</span> into the <span>cuff</span>, and this <span>allows</span> <span>blood</span> <span>pressure</span> to be <span>measured</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Having</span> very high <span>blood</span> <span>pressure</span>, or very low <span>blood</span> <span>pressure</span>, is not good for <span>one's</span> <span>health;</span> it is better to be <span>"in</span> <span>between"</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Another</span> <span>part</span> of the <span>examination</span> is a <span>test</span> of the <span>reflexes</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>doctor</span> <span>tests</span> the <span>patient's</span> <span>reflexes</span> by <span>gently</span> <span>hitting</span> his of her <span>knee</span> with a small <span>hammer</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>If</span> a person has <span>normal</span> <span>reflexes</span>, the leg will <span>extend</span> <span>suddenly</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span> a <span>doctor</span> may give <span>injections</span> <span>using</span> a <span>needle</span>, as an <span>extra</span> <span>part</span> of the <span>check-up</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>These</span> <span>injections</span>, <span>called</span> <span>vaccinations</span>, <span>prevent</span> the <span>patient</span> from <span>developing</span> <span>certain</span> <span>illnesses</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Medical</span> <span>check-ups</span> can help to <span>maintain</span> <span>health</span>, but people should also <span>maintain</span> their <span>health</span> by <span>leading</span> a <span>healthy</span> <span>lifestyle.<br/>

🎧 I <span>grew</span> up in a small <span>town</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There were only about two <span>thousand</span> people who <span>lived</span> in the <span>town</span> where I <span>grew</span> up. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 When a <span>town</span> is very small, it is also <span>called</span> a <span>village</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 My <span>village</span> was <span>surrounded</span> by many <span>farms</span> and many <span>lakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 The house where my <span>family</span> <span>lived</span> was <span>near</span> the <span>middle</span> of the <span>town</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>On</span> the <span>street</span> where we <span>lived</span>, most of the <span>houses</span> were <span>similar</span> in size, but many of them had different <span>shapes</span> and different <span>colors</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Each</span> house was <span>surrounded</span> by a <span>yard</span>, where people <span>grew</span> their <span>lawn</span> and their <span>garden</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Often</span>, I would <span>walk</span> from my house to the <span>downtown</span> <span>part</span> of the <span>village</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>"Downtown"</span> is the <span>area</span> where the <span>stores</span> and <span>shops</span> of a <span>town</span> are <span>located</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Because</span> I <span>lived</span> in a small <span>town</span>, it was a <span>short</span> <span>walk</span> to the <span>downtown</span> <span>area</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 Some <span>stores</span> <span>sold</span> <span>food</span>, some <span>stores</span> <span>sold</span> <span>clothing</span>, and some <span>stores</span> <span>sold</span> <span>hardware</span> <span>(or</span> <span>building</span> <span>supplies)</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was also a <span>short</span> <span>walk</span> to the <span>schools</span> in my <span>town</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 When I <span>went</span> to <span>elementary</span> school, it would take about ten <span>minutes</span> to <span>walk</span> to the school. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Some of my <span>friends</span> <span>lived</span> on the same <span>street</span> where I <span>lived</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span>, we <span>walked</span> to school <span>together</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>During</span> the <span>summer</span> <span>months</span>, many people <span>came</span> from the big <span>city</span> to visit our <span>village</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The people <span>liked</span> to get away from the <span>busy</span> <span>streets</span> of the <span>city</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They <span>enjoyed</span> the <span>quietness</span> and the <span>slow</span> <span>pace</span> of <span>village</span> life. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They also <span>liked</span> to <span>spend</span> their <span>vacations</span> <span>near</span> the <span>lakes</span> that were <span>near</span> the <span>village</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>During</span> the <span>1980s</span> and <span>1990s</span>, <span>personal</span> <span>computers</span> <span>became</span> very <span>widespread</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The use of the <span>computer</span> has <span>changed</span> <span>people's</span> <span>lifestyles</span> in <span>several</span> <span>ways</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Before</span> <span>1980</span>, <span>hardly</span> <span>anyone</span> <span>owned</span> a <span>computer</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Only</span> <span>governments</span> and <span>large</span> <span>companies</span> had <span>computers</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 But <span>throughout</span> the <span>1980s</span> and <span>1990s</span>, <span>computers</span> <span>became</span> much <span>cheaper</span>, <span>faster</span>, and <span>smaller</span>, and they <span>held</span> much more <span>memory</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>More</span> and more people were <span>able</span> to <span>afford</span> to buy a <span>computer</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 By the year <span>2000</span>, <span>computers</span> had become very <span>common</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>Computer</span> <span>games</span> were very <span>simple</span> during the <span>early</span> <span>days</span> of the <span>1980s</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>In</span> the <span>modern</span> age, people <span>often</span> <span>travel</span> long <span>distances</span>. <span><br/></span>
