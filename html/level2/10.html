🎧 People have often wondered about whether or not there is life beyond the planet Earth.<br/>
🎧 For years, the idea of intelligent life on other planets has been very popular. <br/> 
🎧 Many books and movies tell stories of what those forms of life might be like.<br/>
🎧 Many scientists believe that very simple forms of life are likely to exist on many other planets. <br/> 
🎧 Under the right conditions, simple life forms might arise. <br/> 
🎧 those conditions, which include moisture and warmth, might occur in many parts of the universe. <br/> 
🎧 Fewer scientists believe that very intelligent forms of life are likely to exist on many other planets. <br/> 
🎧 For intelligent life to evolve, a very long period of time is needed. <br/> 
🎧 During that time, the conditions on a planet must not be too harsh. <br/> 
🎧 Otherwise, the evolving life forms will die. <br/> 
🎧 The amount of water, heat, and various chemicals must be "just right." If not, then complex life might never evolve.<br/>
🎧 The conditions needed for intelligent life to evolve are very unlikely to occur on any one planet. <br/> 
🎧 However, some scientists believe that intelligent life might be common in the universe. <br/> 
🎧 Because there are so many stars and planets in the universe, there might be a few places that have intelligent life. <br/> 
🎧 However, those places are probably very, very far away.<br/>
🎧 Other scientists disagree. <br/> 
🎧 They think that the conditions needed for intelligent life are extremely rare. <br/> 
🎧 Because of this, our planet might be the only place that has intelligent life!<br/> 
🎧 So far, it is impossible to know whether or not there are intelligent beings on other planets. <br/> 
🎧 But even if those beings do exist, it seems very unlikely that we will ever meet them

🎧 I often enjoy reading the newspaper. <br/> 
🎧 In my city, there are three different newspapers, and I look at different newspapers on different days. <br/> 
🎧 I find that each section of a newspaper has some interesting information.<br/>
🎧 Most newspapers contain several sections that can be easily removed from the rest of the newspaper. <br/> 
🎧 The main section is found at the front of the newspaper. <br/> 
🎧 This section usually contains the most important news from around the world, from around the nation, and from the local area.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes the main section also includes some pages that contain opinions about the news. <br/> 
🎧 The editors of the newspaper write an editorial opinion. <br/> 
🎧 Other writers provide many different opinions about current events. <br/> 
🎧 Also, some readers of the newspaper write letters to the editor, in which they express their opinions.<br/>
🎧 Another popular section of the newspaper is the sports section. <br/> 
🎧 This section contains information about many different sports events. <br/> 
🎧 The sports section provides scores and results from many games and competitions.<br/>
🎧 Another section of the newspaper contains information about entertainment and the arts.<br/>
🎧 The arts and entertainment section tells readers about new movies and plays. <br/> 
🎧 It also describes new books, music concerts, and art exhibits.<br/>
🎧 Most newspapers also have a business section. <br/> 
🎧 This section provides information about new business deals, and about the stock market. <br/> 
🎧 Many people read the business section of the newspaper to gain information and advice about investing their money.<br/>
🎧 Finally, newspapers usually have a section for classified advertisements. <br/> 
🎧 This section allows people to advertise about things that they want to buy or sell. <br/> 
🎧 It also gives notices about job openings.<br/>
🎧 Reading the newspaper is surely a good way to keep informed about many different events in the world around us

🎧 In North America, many young people attend high school, college, or university. <br/> 
🎧 But during the summer months, most of those students work at a summer job.<br/>
🎧 For most students, there are no classes during the months of July and August, and sometimes none in May and June also. <br/> 
🎧 Having a summer job allows students to make money that they will need during the rest of the year. <br/> 
🎧 They need this money because it costs a lot of money to pay for university or college. <br/> 
🎧 Of course, students also want money to spend on things that are fun, also.<br/>
🎧 Many students have summer jobs that involve working with children. <br/> 
🎧 For example, some students work at children's camps, where they teach children various skills and games.<br/>
🎧 Some students work as lifeguards, at swimming pools and at beaches.<br/>
🎧 Some students do heavy work in their summer jobs. <br/> 
🎧 For example, some students find jobs as construction workers. <br/> 
🎧 Other students work in factories, and some students work on farms. <br/> 
🎧 There are other students who find jobs mowing lawns or collecting trash.<br/>
🎧 Quite a few students work in stores. <br/> 
🎧 Some of these students have jobs as cashiers, and some have jobs putting products on store shelves. <br/> 
🎧 Other students work in restaurants, as waiters or as cooks.<br/>
🎧 Other students work in offices. <br/> 
🎧 Some of them work as assistants for other employees.<br/>
🎧 Their tasks might include typing letters, programming computers, or delivering mail.<br/>
🎧 Some students enjoy their summer jobs very much, and they find those jobs to be a pleasant break from studying. <br/> 
🎧 Other students do not really enjoy summer jobs, but find their jobs to be a nice way to make new friends. <br/> 
🎧 But nearly all students who have summer jobs are pleased to have the chance to earn some extra money

🎧 Many people enjoy the experience of going out to eat at a restaurant. <br/> 
🎧 It is enjoyable to eat one's favourite foods, or to try some entirely new food. <br/> 
🎧 Going out to a restaurant is also fun because it allows a change from the usual routine of eating at home.<br/>
🎧 There are many different kinds of restaurants. <br/> 
🎧 One popular type of restaurant is the fastfood restaurant. <br/>

🎧 After paying, the food is quickly delivered, and you can then take the food to a table, where you can enjoy your meal.<br/>
🎧 In most restaurants, you don't have to go to a counter to order your food. <br/>

🎧 There, a waiter comes to give you a menu. <br/> 
🎧 You can choose your meal from the foods that are listed on the menu. <br/> 
🎧 After ordering, it takes some time to prepare your food. <br/> 
🎧 After a while, the waiter brings your meal to the table. <br/> 
🎧 When you are finished eating, the waiter brings the "bill" or "check".<br/>
🎧 You then pay for the meal, and leave some extra money as a "tip" for the waiter.<br/>
🎧 In some other restaurants, the waiter does not bring the meal to your table. <br/> 
🎧 Instead, after you are taken to a table, you then go to a counter called a "buffet." There you can select different types of foods, such as salads, soups, meats, breads, vegetables, and desserts.<br/>
🎧 After putting the food on your plate, you return to your table. <br/> 
🎧 After eating, you can return to the buffet to get more food.<br/>
🎧 Other restaurants can be very fancy. <br/> 
🎧 They may have beautiful decorations, and they may have food that is prepared by expert chefs. <br/> 
🎧 These restaurants may also serve fine wines with the food. <br/> 
🎧 Of course, these restaurants are very expensive. <br/> 
🎧 At these restaurants, it is often necessary to reserve a table by telephoning the restaurant in advance.<br/>
🎧 Different restaurants specialize in different kinds of food. <br/> 
🎧 Fast-food restaurants may specialize in hamburgers or chicken. <br/> 
🎧 Some restaurants specialize in steak or seafood.<br/>
🎧 Other restaurants specialize in foods that belong to a certain nationality. <br/> 
🎧 For example, many restaurants specialize in Italian, Mexican, Chinese, Indian, or Thai food.<br/>
🎧 Eating out at a restaurant can be a fun and tasty experience. <br/>

🎧 Every society has laws that regulate the way people behave. <br/> 
🎧 A good citizen should obey laws. <br/> 
🎧 However, there is more to being a good citizen than merely obeying laws. <br/> 
🎧 There are many other things that people can do to make their society a pleasant one for every person.<br/>
🎧 One way to be a good citizen is to be polite in everyday activities. <br/> 
🎧 For example, when passing through a door, a considerate person will hold the door open for a person who is close behind. <br/> 
🎧 Holding doors open is especially important when someone is carrying a heavy load.<br/>
🎧 Being a good citizen is very important when travelling on the roads and streets.<br/>
🎧 Pedestrians, bicyclists, and car drivers should all follow the rules of the road. <br/> 
🎧 Bicyclists should yield to pedestrians, and car drivers should yield to both bicyclists and pedestrians. <br/> 
🎧 Drivers should also allow other drivers to merge into their lanes. <br/> 
🎧 Also, drivers should avoid honking their horns except when this is necessary.<br/>
🎧 A good citizen will also avoid doing things that interfere with others. <br/> 
🎧 For example, a considerate person does not smoke cigarettes in areas where this might irritate others.<br/>
🎧 Also, a polite person avoids playing music so loudly that other people will be annoyed.<br/>
🎧 And of course, a good citizen avoids littering or making a mess.<br/>
🎧 Other ways of being a good citizen involve greater effort. <br/> 
🎧 Some people serve their community by doing volunteer work of some kind. <br/> 
🎧 Other people help by donating money to a charity. <br/> 
🎧 Another way to serve the community is to donate blood. <br/> 
🎧 Blood donors are needed so that there will be enough blood available to help people who are sick or injured.<br/>
🎧 Being a good citizen is very helpful for the community, and it also gives a feeling of satisfaction and pride

🎧 When people feel sick, they go to a doctor. <br/> 
🎧 But sometimes people visit the doctor even when they are not sick. <br/> 
🎧 Doctors can perform a medical "check-up", to find out if a person is healthy. <br/> 
🎧 By performing this physical examination, the doctor can identify any health problems that might be developing.<br/>
🎧 During a check-up, the doctor examines your eyes, ears, and throat. <br/> 
🎧 The doctor uses a small flashlight to examine the eyes, ears, and throat. <br/> 
🎧 It is important to make sure that the eyes react normally to changes in light. <br/> 
🎧 It is also important to make sure that the ears and throat have a normal appearance. <br/> 
🎧 When the doctor examines your throat, he or she will ask you open your mouth wide and say "ah".<br/>
🎧 The doctor uses a stethoscope to examine the patient's heartbeat. <br/> 
🎧 The stethoscope hangs around the doctor's neck. <br/> 
🎧 By using a stethoscope, a doctor can hear the patient's heartbeat very clearly. <br/> 
🎧 While checking the patient's heart, the doctor also listens carefully to make sure that the patient's breathing is normal.<br/>
🎧 The doctor also checks the patient's blood pressure. <br/> 
🎧 Blood pressure is measured by placing a cuff around the arm. <br/> 
🎧 Air is then pumped into the cuff, and this allows blood pressure to be measured. <br/> 
🎧 Having very high blood pressure, or very low blood pressure, is not good for one's health; it is better to be "in between".<br/>
🎧 Another part of the examination is a test of the reflexes. <br/> 
🎧 The doctor tests the patient's reflexes by gently hitting his of her knee with a small hammer. <br/> 
🎧 If a person has normal reflexes, the leg will extend suddenly.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes a doctor may give injections using a needle, as an extra part of the check-up.<br/>
🎧 These injections, called vaccinations, prevent the patient from developing certain illnesses.<br/>
🎧 Medical check-ups can help to maintain health, but people should also maintain their health by leading a healthy lifestyle

🎧 My village was surrounded by many farms and many lakes.<br/>
🎧 The house where my family lived was near the middle of the town. <br/> 
🎧 On the street where we lived, most of the houses were similar in size, but many of them had different shapes and different colors. <br/> 
🎧 Each house was surrounded by a yard, where people grew their lawn and their garden.<br/>
🎧 often, I would walk from my house to the downtown part of the village. <br/> 
🎧 "Downtown" is the area where the stores and shops of a town are located. <br/> 
🎧 Because I lived in a small town, it was a short walk to the downtown area. <br/> 
🎧 Along the main street, there were several different kinds of stores. <br/> 
🎧 Some stores sold food, some stores sold clothing, and some stores sold hardware (or building supplies).<br/>
🎧 It was also a short walk to the schools in my town. <br/> 
🎧 When I went to elementary school, it would take about ten minutes to walk to the school. <br/> 
🎧 Some of my friends lived on the same street where I lived. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes, we walked to school together.<br/>
🎧 During the summer months, many people came from the big city to visit our village. <br/> 
🎧 The people liked to get away from the busy streets of the city. <br/> 
🎧 They enjoyed the quietness and the slow pace of village life. <br/> 
🎧 They also liked to spend their vacations near the lakes that were near the village. <br/> 
🎧 People from the city often said that people who live in villages seemed very friendly.<br/>
🎧 When I grew up, I left my village, and I went to work in a larger town. <br/>

🎧 During the 1980s and 1990s, personal computers became very widespread. <br/> 
🎧 The use of the computer has changed people's lifestyles in several ways.<br/>
🎧 Before 1980, hardly anyone owned a computer. <br/> 
🎧 Only governments and large companies had computers. <br/> 
🎧 But throughout the 1980s and 1990s, computers became much cheaper, faster, and smaller, and they held much more memory. <br/> 
🎧 More and more people were able to afford to buy a computer. <br/> 
🎧 By the year 2000, computers had become very common.<br/>
🎧 For many people, the personal computer is used mainly for performing calculations and for word processing. <br/> 
🎧 For example, people can calculate their finances on the computer.<br/>
🎧 They can also use the computer to type their written documents, such as essays or letters.<br/>
🎧 Many people enjoy playing games on their computers. <br/> 
🎧 Some people like to play chess or checkers on their computer. <br/> 
🎧 Other people prefer games that require fast reflexes and fine co-ordination. <br/> 
🎧 Computer games were very simple during the early days of the 1980s.<br/>
🎧 Today's computer games show detailed images and sounds.<br/>
🎧 Another very popular use of computers involves communication. <br/> 
🎧 Many people keep in touch with their friends and relatives by using electronic mail, or e-mail. <br/> 
🎧 E-mail allows people to send letters instantly to people far away. <br/> 
🎧 It is even possible to attach pictures to one's e-mail messages.<br/>
🎧 Many people also like to use their computer to gain information on the Internet. <br/> 
🎧 The Internet is a vast network of electronic pages where people can find information on many different topics. <br/> 
🎧 For example, people can read newspapers and magazines on the Internet.<br/>
🎧 Personal computers have only existed for a short time. <br/>

🎧 In the modern age, people often travel long distances. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes people travel for reasons related to their work. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes they travel as tourists. <br/> 
🎧 And sometimes people travel to visit relatives and friends.<br/>
🎧 There are many different ways that people can travel. <br/> 
🎧 Some forms of transportation move people along the ground. <br/> 
🎧 Other methods of transportation move people across the water, or through the air.<br/>
🎧 Airplanes provide the fastest method of travelling. <br/> 
🎧 Modern jet airliners travel at about 1000 kilometres per hour. <br/> 
🎧 These airplanes cruise through the skies, almost ten kilometres above the level of the sea. <br/> 
🎧 Jet airplanes allow people to travel great distances in a short time. <br/> 
🎧 For example, it is possible to fly across a great ocean, such as the Pacific or the Atlantic, in several hours.<br/>
🎧 Ships were once the only way to travel across the oceans. <br/> 
🎧 Before airplanes, it took many weeks or months to travel around the world. <br/> 
🎧 Today, many people still travel by ship when crossing smaller bodies of water. <br/> 
🎧 Some ships, called ferries, allow people to bring their cars with them onto the ship. <br/>
