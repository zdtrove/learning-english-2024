🎧 Wow! A big <span>tent</span> was in the <span>middle</span> of the <span>town's</span> <span>parking</span> lot! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We were going to a <span>three-ring</span> <span>circus</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I couldn't <span>wait</span> for it to <span>begin</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Inside</span> and <span>outside</span> of the <span>tent</span>, <span>toys</span>, <span>balloons</span> and <span>food</span> were being <span>sold</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 All of the <span>children</span> were so very <span>excited</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Inside</span> the <span>tent</span>, we <span>found</span> good <span>seats</span> so we <span>could</span> see <span>everything</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>band</span> <span>started</span> to play <span>loud</span> <span>music</span>, and the <span>ringmaster</span> <span>came</span> out with a big <span>tall</span> hat on his <span>head</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>In</span> one <span>ring</span>, there were small <span>animals</span>, <span>dogs</span>, <span>monkeys</span> and <span>parrots</span> doing <span>tricks</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>dogs</span> were <span>dressed</span> in <span>funny</span> <span>clothes</span>, and so were the <span>monkeys</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They <span>rode</span> on <span>bicycles</span>, <span>danced</span> and <span>climbed</span> <span>ladders</span>.<br/>
🎧 There were <span>wild</span> <span>tigers</span> and <span>lions</span> in a big <span>round</span> <span>wire</span> <span>cage</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 A man with a <span>whip</span> was <span>inside</span> the <span>cage</span> with them. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 He had them <span>trained</span> to <span>jump</span> <span>through</span> a <span>hoop</span> of <span>fire</span> and to <span>roll</span> over.<br/>
🎧 He even <span>kissed</span> them! He was very <span>brave!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>During</span> the <span>break</span> in the <span>middle</span> of the <span>circus</span>, <span>funny</span> <span>clowns</span> <span>came</span> out and did <span>silly</span> <span>things</span>.<br/>
🎧 They had happy <span>faces</span> and sad <span>faces</span>. Some had big red <span>noses</span> that <span>honked</span> if you <span>squeezed</span> them. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There were <span>rides</span> on big <span>elephants</span> too. I didn't go on one <span>because</span> it <span>cost</span> too much <span>money</span>.<br/>
🎧 The last act took up the <span>whole</span> <span>tent</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It was <span>acrobats</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They <span>hung</span> from their <span>teeth</span>, their <span>feet</span> and their <span>necks</span> high up in the air! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They also <span>swung</span> high up in the air and <span>"flew"</span> to each other. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It's kind of <span>scary</span> to <span>watch</span> <span>because</span> I was <span>afraid</span> they <span>might</span> <span>fall</span>.<br/>
🎧 I had a very good time at the <span>circus</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 When the hot <span>summer</span> <span>weather</span> <span>arrives</span>, many people like to <span>cool</span> off by <span>visiting</span> the <span>beach</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Often</span>, there is a <span>cool</span> <span>breeze</span> that <span>comes</span> off the <span>water</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 And, of <span>course</span>, the <span>water</span> <span>itself</span> is <span>cool</span> and <span>refreshing</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>Building</span> <span>sandcastles</span> is a lot of fun, but you shouldn't <span>build</span> them too <span>close</span> to the <span>water:</span> a <span>wave</span> <span>might</span> come and <span>wash</span> your <span>sandcastle</span> <span>away!<br/></span>

🎧 I like to sit on the <span>beach</span> with an <span>ice-cream</span> <span>cone</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 But you have to eat it <span>quickly</span>, <span>before</span> it <span>melts</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Of</span> <span>course</span>, the <span>main</span> <span>attraction</span> of a <span>beach</span> is the <span>water</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 many <span>children</span> learn to <span>swim</span> at the <span>beach</span>, and enjoy <span>playing</span> in the <span>water</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Some people like to <span>swim</span> <span>vigorously</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Other</span> people like to <span>relax</span> in the <span>water</span> on an <span>inflatable</span>, <span>floating</span> <span>mattress</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Other</span> people just <span>wade</span> around in the <span>water</span>, as a way to keep <span>cool</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 When it is a <span>windy</span> day, some people try <span>sports</span> such as <span>surfing</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Going</span> to the <span>beach</span> is <span>surely</span> one of the <span>best</span> <span>ways</span> to <span>spend</span> a <span>summer</span> <span>day!<br/>

🎧 <span>First</span> mom <span>tells</span> me to get out the <span>cooking</span> <span>stuff;</span> so I get out the <span>mixer</span> and <span>bowl</span>, the <span>measuring</span> <span>cups</span> and <span>spoons</span> and the <span>cookie</span> <span>sheets</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 I <span>remind</span> her that the <span>recipe</span> is on the <span>chocolate</span> <span>chip</span> <span>package</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>"Right,"</span> she <span>says</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Then</span> she <span>asks</span> me to look at the <span>recipe</span> and get out the <span>things</span> we <span>need:</span> like <span>flour</span>, <span>sugar</span> and <span>butter</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>"Twinkle</span>, <span>twinkle</span>, little <span>star</span>, how I <span>wonder</span> what you <span>are;</span> up <span>above</span> the <span>world</span> so high, like a <span>diamond</span> in the sky, <span>twinkle</span>, <span>twinkle</span> little <span>star."</span> <span><br/></span> 
🎧 This is a little <span>poem/song</span> I always say when I am <span>outside</span>, and I see the <span>stars</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 When I see the <span>first</span> <span>star</span> of the <span>night</span>, I <span>sometimes</span> say this <span>one:</span> <span>"Star</span> <span>light</span>, <span>star</span> <span>bright</span>, <span>first</span> <span>star</span> I see <span>tonight;</span> I <span>wish</span> I <span>may;</span> I <span>wish</span> I <span>might</span>, have the <span>wish</span> I <span>wish</span> <span>tonight."</span> <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Do you have a special <span>thing</span> to say about the <span>stars?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Stars</span> are <span>beautiful</span> <span>bright</span> <span>spots</span> in the sky. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Stars</span> are usually <span>seen</span> at <span>night</span> when it is <span>dark</span>.<br/>
🎧 We can't see them in the day time <span>because</span> the sun is so <span>bright</span>, the <span>brightest</span> <span>star</span> of all. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I like <span>staying</span> up <span>late</span> just to look at the <span>stars</span>.<br/>
🎧 One time I was <span>outside</span> at <span>midnight</span>, and the <span>stars</span> <span>seemed</span> to <span>sparkle</span> and <span>dance</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They <span>really</span> did look like <span>diamonds</span> <span>dancing</span> in the <span>sky!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>If</span> you <span>watch</span> the <span>stars</span> long enough, you may see a <span>falling</span> <span>star</span> or a <span>shooting</span> <span>star</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I have <span>seen</span> both. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 A <span>falling</span> <span>star</span> is where the <span>star</span> just <span>seems</span> to <span>drop</span>, and it <span>leaves</span> a <span>trail</span> of what <span>appears</span> like <span>star</span> <span>dust</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 A <span>shooting</span> <span>star</span> is very <span>beautiful</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It <span>"shoots"</span> across the sky <span>leaving</span> a long <span>trail</span> of <span>colourful</span> <span>"star</span> <span>dust."</span> <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Shooting</span> <span>stars</span> <span>seem</span> to <span>brighten</span> up the <span>whole</span> sky. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They usually <span>seem</span> <span>quite</span> <span>close</span> to the <span>earth</span>.<br/>
🎧 Have you <span>ever</span> <span>watched</span> the <span>stars</span> and got the <span>urge</span> to <span>reach</span> out and <span>touch</span> them, or even to <span>join</span> them in their <span>secret</span> <span>dance</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>wonder</span> what it would be like to see a <span>star</span> up <span>close</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Would</span> it look like the <span>moon</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Maybe</span> one day when I am <span>older</span>, I will go up in a <span>rocket</span> <span>ship</span> and <span>visit</span> the <span>dancing</span> <span>stars</span> in the <span>midnight</span> <span>sky!<br/>
