🎧 Sometimes she <span>asks</span> my advice now about her work or about a <span>problem</span> and I ask her advice. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes she comes in to my <span>office</span> and says <span>"</span> I'm really <span>angry</span>, can I <span>whine</span> to <span>you?"</span> <br/> 
🎧 <span>Then</span> she <span>talks</span> about a <span>problem</span> and I listen, and then she <span>returns</span> <span>cheerfully</span> to her <span>office</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes I go into her <span>office</span> and say. <span>"I'm</span> <span>upset</span> about something that <span>happened;</span> can I come in for a <span>minute?"</span> <br/> 
🎧 <span>Then</span> I <span>grumble</span> to her and she <span>listens</span>, and then I go back <span>cheerfully</span> to my <span>office</span>. <br/>

🎧 My <span>Friend</span> In the <span>Next</span> <span>Office</span><br/> 
🎧 When I <span>started</span> my job a year ago at the university, I did not know my way around. <br/> 
🎧 I did not know where to find anything. <br/> 
🎧 I had a <span>million</span> <span>questions</span>. <br/> 
🎧 But <span>Dianne</span> in the next <span>office</span> took me on a <span>tour</span> <span>showing</span> me the <span>places</span> to eat, the <span>library</span>, the <span>lecture</span> <span>rooms</span>, where to get a <span>picture</span> <span>ID</span> <span>card</span>, how to get from one <span>building</span> to another. <br/> 
🎧 When I had a <span>question</span> I <span>asked</span> <span>Dianne:</span> how to use the <span>telephone</span>, where to make <span>copies</span>, where to <span>print</span> with my <span>computer</span>, the <span>location</span> of my <span>mailbox</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>teaches</span> as I do. <br/> 
🎧 We both <span>spend</span> a lot of time <span>helping</span> students and <span>answering</span> their <span>questions</span>. <br/> 
🎧 She <span>giggles</span> a <span>lot;</span> I hear her <span>laugh</span> with her students.<br/>
🎧 <span>Dianne</span> is shy in a group of people. <br/> 
🎧 She is <span>quiet</span> and does not start a <span>conversation</span>.<br/>
🎧 Everyone around her <span>talks</span> and she <span>listens</span>. <br/> 
🎧 On <span>Friday</span> <span>afternoons</span>, she makes <span>popcorn</span> for everyone. <br/> 
🎧 We all sit in the <span>staff</span> room and eat <span>microwaved</span> <span>popcorn</span> and drink tea and talk.<br/>
🎧 We start to <span>relax</span> for the weekend and talk about our <span>plans</span>.<br/>
🎧 She is a good <span>friend;</span> she helps my students when I am not <span>there;</span> she <span>wishes</span> me good <span>luck</span> when I go to a <span>lecture</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I am very glad that she can be my friend in the <span>office</span> <span>beside</span> <span>mine

🎧 She loved <span>performing</span> in <span>front</span> of people. She couldn't help but feel the <span>sense</span> of <span>power</span> she had when she was up on <span>stage</span>, and there was always <span>loud</span><br/> 
🎧 <span>clapping</span> when she <span>finished</span> a <span>song</span>.<br/>

🎧 Wow! A big <span>tent</span> was in the <span>middle</span> of the <span>town's</span> <span>parking</span> lot! <br/> 
🎧 We were going to a <span>three-ring</span> <span>circus</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I couldn't wait for it to <span>begin</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Inside</span> and outside of the <span>tent</span>, <span>toys</span>, <span>balloons</span> and food were being <span>sold</span>. <br/> 
🎧 All of the children were so very <span>excited</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Inside</span> the <span>tent</span>, we <span>found</span> good <span>seats</span> so we could see everything. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>band</span> <span>started</span> to play <span>loud</span> music, and the <span>ringmaster</span> came out with a big <span>tall</span> hat on his <span>head</span>.<br/>
🎧 In one <span>ring</span>, there were small <span>animals</span>, <span>dogs</span>, <span>monkeys</span> and <span>parrots</span> doing <span>tricks</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>dogs</span> were <span>dressed</span> in funny <span>clothes</span>, and so were the <span>monkeys</span>. <br/> 
🎧 They <span>rode</span> on <span>bicycles</span>, <span>danced</span> and <span>climbed</span> <span>ladders</span>.<br/>
🎧 There were <span>wild</span> <span>tigers</span> and <span>lions</span> in a big <span>round</span> <span>wire</span> <span>cage</span>. <br/> 
🎧 A man with a <span>whip</span> was inside the <span>cage</span> with them. <br/> 
🎧 He had them <span>trained</span> to <span>jump</span> through a <span>hoop</span> of <span>fire</span> and to <span>roll</span> over.<br/>
🎧 He even <span>kissed</span> them! He was very <span>brave</span>!<br/> 
🎧 <span>During</span> the <span>break</span> in the <span>middle</span> of the <span>circus</span>, funny <span>clowns</span> came out and did <span>silly</span> things.<br/>
🎧 They had happy <span>faces</span> and sad <span>faces</span>. Some had big red <span>noses</span> that <span>honked</span> if you <span>squeezed</span> them. <br/> 
🎧 There were <span>rides</span> on big <span>elephants</span> too. I didn't go on one because it <span>cost</span> too much money.<br/>
🎧 The last act took up the whole <span>tent</span>. <br/> 
🎧 It was <span>acrobats</span>. <br/> 
🎧 They <span>hung</span> from their <span>teeth</span>, their <span>feet</span> and their <span>necks</span> high up in the air! <br/> 
🎧 They also <span>swung</span> high up in the air and <span>"flew"</span> to each other. <br/> 
🎧 It's kind of <span>scary</span> to <span>watch</span> because I was <span>afraid</span> they might <span>fall</span>.<br/>
🎧 I had a very good time at the <span>circus</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>However</span>, my <span>tummy</span> <span>felt</span> kind of <span>sick</span> from all the <span>cotton</span> <span>candy</span> and <span>junk</span> food I <span>ate

🎧 <span>Each</span> week I go to the <span>grocery</span> <span>store</span> to buy food for my <span>family</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I get a <span>shopping</span> <span>cart</span> from the <span>front</span> of the <span>store</span>, and I <span>push</span> the <span>cart</span> all around the <span>store</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>cart</span> is large, but when I am <span>finished</span> <span>shopping</span>, the <span>cart</span> is <span>nearly</span> <span>full</span>!<br/> 
🎧 The <span>grocery</span> <span>store</span> is also called a <span>supermarket</span>. <br/> 
🎧 When I go <span>shopping</span>, I start out in the <span>produce</span> <span>section</span> of the <span>supermarket</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>produce</span> <span>section</span> is where the <span>fresh</span> <span>fruits</span> and <span>vegetables</span> are <span>kept</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I like to buy different <span>kinds</span> of <span>fruit</span>, such as <span>apples</span>, <span>oranges</span>, and <span>bananas</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>vegetables</span> that I often buy are <span>carrots</span>, <span>peas</span>, and <span>corn</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I also buy <span>tomatoes</span> when they are <span>bright</span> red in color. <br/> 
🎧 I often buy a bag of <span>potatoes</span> or a bag of <span>rice</span>.<br/>
🎧 After <span>visiting</span> the <span>produce</span> <span>section</span>, I go to the <span>meat</span> <span>section</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Here</span> I buy <span>poultry</span>, such as <span>chicken</span> and <span>turkey</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I often buy <span>seafood</span>, <span>especially</span> <span>fish</span>. I also buy <span>beef</span>, and sometimes <span>pork</span> or <span>lamb</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I also visit the <span>dairy</span> <span>section</span>, where I can buy <span>milk</span> and <span>cheese</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes I also buy ice <span>cream</span> or <span>yogurt</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I have <span>finished</span> in the <span>meat</span> and <span>dairy</span> <span>sections</span>, I then move to the <span>bakery</span> <span>section</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is where <span>loaves</span> of <span>bread</span> are <span>baked</span> and <span>sold</span>. <br/> 
🎧 There are many different <span>kinds</span> of <span>bread</span> in the <span>bakery</span> <span>section</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>bakery</span> <span>section</span> also <span>sells</span> <span>pasta</span>, such as <span>macaroni</span> and <span>spaghetti</span>. <br/> 
🎧 And, of course, you can buy <span>pies</span>, <span>cakes</span>, and <span>cookies</span> in the <span>bakery</span> <span>section</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>These</span> <span>foods</span> are very <span>sweet</span> and <span>tasty</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I also <span>pick</span> up a few other things at the <span>supermarket</span>, such as <span>soap</span>, <span>toothpaste</span>, and <span>cleaning</span> <span>supplies</span>. <br/> 
🎧 But sometimes I <span>forget</span> to buy something that I had <span>planned</span> to <span>get</span>.<br/>

🎧 When the hot <span>summer</span> <span>weather</span> <span>arrives</span>, many people like to <span>cool</span> off by <span>visiting</span> the <span>beach</span>.<br/>
🎧 often, there is a <span>cool</span> <span>breeze</span> that comes off the water. <br/> 
🎧 And, of course, the water <span>itself</span> is <span>cool</span> and <span>refreshing</span>.<br/>
🎧 One of the <span>favourite</span> <span>activities</span> at the <span>beach</span> is <span>building</span> <span>sandcastles</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Children</span> use small <span>shovels</span> and <span>pails</span> to move the <span>sand</span>. <br/> 
🎧 They can <span>build</span> small <span>forts</span> and <span>castles</span> by <span>carefully</span> <span>forming</span> and <span>shaping</span> the <span>sand</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Building</span> <span>sandcastles</span> is a lot of fun, but you shouldn't <span>build</span> them too <span>close</span> to the <span>water:</span> a <span>wave</span> might come and <span>wash</span> your <span>sandcastle</span> <span>away</span>!<br/> 
🎧 There are also many <span>games</span> that people like to play at the <span>beach</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Some people play catch with a small <span>plastic</span> <span>disc</span> called a <span>Frisbee</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>Frisbee</span> <span>glides</span> <span>smoothly</span> through the <span>air</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Other</span> people like to play <span>beach</span> <span>volleyball</span> in the <span>soft</span> <span>sand</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some people <span>prefer</span> just to <span>relax</span> on the <span>beach</span>. <br/> 
🎧 They like to lie down on a <span>blanket</span> and feel the <span>warm</span> <span>sunshine</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I like to sit on the <span>beach</span> with an <span>ice-cream</span> <span>cone</span>. <br/> 
🎧 But you have to eat it quickly, before it <span>melts</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course, the <span>main</span> <span>attraction</span> of a <span>beach</span> is the water. <br/> 
🎧 Many children learn to <span>swim</span> at the <span>beach</span>, and enjoy playing in the water. <br/> 
🎧 Some people like to <span>swim</span> <span>vigorously</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Other</span> people like to <span>relax</span> in the water on an <span>inflatable</span>, <span>floating</span> <span>mattress</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Other</span> people just <span>wade</span> around in the water, as a way to keep <span>cool</span>. <br/> 
🎧 When it is a <span>windy</span> day, some people try <span>sports</span> such as <span>surfing</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Going</span> to the <span>beach</span> is <span>surely</span> one of the best <span>ways</span> to <span>spend</span> a <span>summer</span> <span>day

🎧 We set the <span>oven</span> <span>temperature</span> to <span>350</span> <span>degrees</span> <span>F</span>. <br/>

🎧 I like <span>staying</span> up <span>late</span> just to look at the <span>stars</span>.<br/>
🎧 One time I was outside at <span>midnight</span>, and the <span>stars</span> <span>seemed</span> to <span>sparkle</span> and <span>dance</span>. <br/> 
🎧 They really did look like <span>diamonds</span> <span>dancing</span> in the <span>sky</span>!<br/> 
🎧 If you <span>watch</span> the <span>stars</span> long enough, you may see a <span>falling</span> <span>star</span> or a <span>shooting</span> <span>star</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I have <span>seen</span> both. <br/> 
🎧 A <span>falling</span> <span>star</span> is where the <span>star</span> just <span>seems</span> to <span>drop</span>, and it leaves a <span>trail</span> of what <span>appears</span> like <span>star</span> <span>dust</span>. <br/> 
🎧 A <span>shooting</span> <span>star</span> is very <span>beautiful</span>. <br/> 
🎧 It <span>"shoots"</span> across the sky <span>leaving</span> a long <span>trail</span> of <span>colourful</span> <span>"star</span> <span>dust."</span> <br/> 
🎧 <span>Shooting</span> <span>stars</span> <span>seem</span> to <span>brighten</span> up the whole sky. <br/> 
🎧 They usually <span>seem</span> quite <span>close</span> to the <span>earth</span>.<br/>
🎧 Have you ever <span>watched</span> the <span>stars</span> and got the <span>urge</span> to <span>reach</span> out and touch them, or even to join them in their <span>secret</span> <span>dance</span>? <br/> 
🎧 I <span>wonder</span> what it would be like to see a <span>star</span> up <span>close</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Would</span> it look like the <span>moon</span>? <br/> 
🎧 Maybe one day when I am <span>older</span>, I will go up in a <span>rocket</span> <span>ship</span> and visit the <span>dancing</span> <span>stars</span> in the <span>midnight</span> <span>sky

🎧 A <span>song</span> comes on the <span>radio</span>. <br/> 
🎧 My <span>lips</span> start to move, <span>singing</span> along. <br/> 
🎧 My <span>fingers</span> start to <span>snap;</span> my <span>feet</span> <span>begin</span> to tap. <br/> 
🎧 The music <span>sinks</span> <span>deep</span> into my <span>soul</span>. I listen to the music as it <span>fills</span> my <span>brain</span>, and I remember when I used to <span>sing</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I <span>sang</span> in <span>front</span> of <span>huge</span> <span>crowds</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I loved it when they <span>watched</span> me and <span>clapped</span> for me when I was <span>finished</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Letting</span> out my <span>feelings</span> when I was sad, mad, happy, or glad was when I would <span>sing</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I <span>sang</span> in the <span>shower;</span> I <span>sang</span> in the <span>rain;</span> I <span>sang</span> in <span>church;</span> I <span>sang</span> <span>walking</span> down the <span>street</span>!<br/> 
🎧 <span>Music</span> has always been a big <span>part</span> of my life. <br/> 
🎧 It <span>seems</span> like I was a <span>baby</span> when I <span>started</span> playing the <span>piano</span>! <br/> 
🎧 I would sit on my <span>sister's</span> lap while she <span>played</span> the <span>piano</span>, and I would <span>bang</span> on the <span>keys</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I remember <span>sitting</span> <span>beside</span> her and <span>learning</span> how to <span>sing</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I <span>sang</span> my little <span>lungs</span> out!<br/> 
🎧 <span>As</span> I <span>grew</span>, I <span>listened</span> to other <span>singers</span> on <span>tapes</span>, the <span>radio</span> and <span>C.D.s</span>. I took those things that I heard from different <span>singers</span> and made myself sound like them. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Soon</span>, I could take what I had heard all my life and make it into my own sound.<br/>
🎧 I have always <span>liked</span> <span>singing</span> <span>jazz</span> and <span>blues</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I don't listen to <span>jazz</span> and <span>blues</span> a lot, <span>however</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I listen to pop, <span>rock</span>, <span>classical</span> and some <span>country</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>As</span> you can see, I like many <span>types</span> of music. <br/> 
🎧 I have <span>seen</span> <span>musicals</span>, too, like <span>Phantom</span> of the <span>Opera</span> and <span>Les</span> <span>Miserables</span>. <br/> 
🎧 those <span>musicals</span> were amazing. <br/> 
🎧 There were such <span>bright</span> <span>costumes</span> and <span>stage</span> <span>sets</span>, not to <span>mention</span> the wonderful <span>songs</span> and <span>singing</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Music</span> has been on this <span>earth</span> since the <span>beginning</span> of time, and it <span>touches</span> every one in a different way. <br/> 
🎧 I know it has not only <span>touched</span> me, but is a big <span>part</span> of my very <span>being

🎧 <span>"Ring</span>, <span>ring."</span> The phone is <span>ringing</span>. <br/>

🎧 My date <span>pays</span> for the <span>meal</span>. <br/>

🎧 It's time to <span>sign</span> up for school. <br/> 
🎧 This year <span>Natalie</span> is going to <span>Brock</span> <span>University</span>. <br/>

🎧 books from the school <span>bookstore;</span> if she wanted to get a book from the <span>library;</span> or if she wanted to use the <span>pool</span>!<br/> 
🎧 After all of the <span>signing</span> up and money was <span>paid</span>, <span>Natalie</span> went out to lunch with her <span>mother</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>"Mom</span>, I'm kind of <span>scared</span> about going to school. <br/> 
🎧 I'm going to be the <span>youngest</span> kid there. <br/> 
🎧 I don't know how to take <span>notes</span>. <br/> 
🎧 The <span>teachers</span> might be <span>mean...."</span>, <span>Natalie</span> <span>rambled</span> on. <br/> 
🎧 Her mom just <span>calmed</span> her down and said, <span>"Take</span> one day at a time, <span>Natalie</span>. <br/>

🎧 She told her mom that <span>classes</span> weren't all that <span>scary;</span> the students and the <span>teachers</span> weren't <span>scary</span> either! <br/> 
🎧 <span>Natalie</span> <span>knew</span> that the school work would be <span>hard</span>, but she <span>felt</span> good about the people she had <span>met</span> that day. <br/> 
🎧 She <span>knew</span> she'd have a good <span>year
