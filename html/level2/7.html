🎧 Sometimes she asks my advice now about her work or about a problem and I ask her advice. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes she comes in to my office and says " I'm really angry, can I whine to you?" <br/> 
🎧 Then she talks about a problem and I listen, and then she returns cheerfully to her office. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes I go into her office and say. "I'm upset about something that happened; can I come in for a minute?" <br/> 
🎧 Then I grumble to her and she listens, and then I go back cheerfully to my office. <br/> 
🎧 Each of us feels better when we have shared our problems. <br/> 
🎧 Then they are no longer problems.<br/>
🎧 My Friend In the Next Office<br/> 
🎧 When I started my job a year ago at the university, I did not know my way around. <br/> 
🎧 I did not know where to find anything. <br/> 
🎧 I had a million questions. <br/> 
🎧 But Dianne in the next office took me on a tour showing me the places to eat, the library, the lecture rooms, where to get a picture ID card, how to get from one building to another. <br/> 
🎧 When I had a question I asked Dianne: how to use the telephone, where to make copies, where to print with my computer, the location of my mailbox.<br/>
🎧 She teaches as I do. <br/> 
🎧 We both spend a lot of time helping students and answering their questions. <br/> 
🎧 She giggles a lot; I hear her laugh with her students.<br/>
🎧 Dianne is shy in a group of people. <br/> 
🎧 She is quiet and does not start a conversation.<br/>
🎧 Everyone around her talks and she listens. <br/> 
🎧 On Friday afternoons, she makes popcorn for everyone. <br/> 
🎧 We all sit in the staff room and eat microwaved popcorn and drink tea and talk.<br/>
🎧 We start to relax for the weekend and talk about our plans.<br/>
🎧 She is a good friend; she helps my students when I am not there; she wishes me good luck when I go to a lecture. <br/> 
🎧 I am very glad that she can be my friend in the office beside mine

🎧 Wow! A big tent was in the middle of the town's parking lot! <br/> 
🎧 We were going to a three-ring circus. <br/> 
🎧 I couldn't wait for it to begin. <br/> 
🎧 Inside and outside of the tent, toys, balloons and food were being sold. <br/> 
🎧 All of the children were so very excited.<br/>
🎧 Inside the tent, we found good seats so we could see everything. <br/> 
🎧 The band started to play loud music, and the ringmaster came out with a big tall hat on his head.<br/>
🎧 In one ring, there were small animals, dogs, monkeys and parrots doing tricks. <br/> 
🎧 The dogs were dressed in funny clothes, and so were the monkeys. <br/> 
🎧 They rode on bicycles, danced and climbed ladders.<br/>
🎧 There were wild tigers and lions in a big round wire cage. <br/> 
🎧 A man with a whip was inside the cage with them. <br/> 
🎧 He had them trained to jump through a hoop of fire and to roll over.<br/>
🎧 He even kissed them! He was very brave!<br/> 
🎧 During the break in the middle of the circus, funny clowns came out and did silly things.<br/>
🎧 They had happy faces and sad faces. Some had big red noses that honked if you squeezed them. <br/> 
🎧 There were rides on big elephants too. I didn't go on one because it cost too much money.<br/>
🎧 The last act took up the whole tent. <br/> 
🎧 It was acrobats. <br/> 
🎧 They hung from their teeth, their feet and their necks high up in the air! <br/> 
🎧 They also swung high up in the air and "flew" to each other. <br/> 
🎧 It's kind of scary to watch because I was afraid they might fall.<br/>
🎧 I had a very good time at the circus. <br/> 
🎧 However, my tummy felt kind of sick from all the cotton candy and junk food I ate

🎧 Each week I go to the grocery store to buy food for my family. <br/> 
🎧 I get a shopping cart from the front of the store, and I push the cart all around the store. <br/> 
🎧 The cart is large, but when I am finished shopping, the cart is nearly full!<br/> 
🎧 The grocery store is also called a supermarket. <br/> 
🎧 When I go shopping, I start out in the produce section of the supermarket. <br/> 
🎧 The produce section is where the fresh fruits and vegetables are kept. <br/> 
🎧 I like to buy different kinds of fruit, such as apples, oranges, and bananas. <br/> 
🎧 The vegetables that I often buy are carrots, peas, and corn. <br/> 
🎧 I also buy tomatoes when they are bright red in color. <br/> 
🎧 I often buy a bag of potatoes or a bag of rice.<br/>
🎧 After visiting the produce section, I go to the meat section. <br/> 
🎧 Here I buy poultry, such as chicken and turkey. <br/> 
🎧 I often buy seafood, especially fish. I also buy beef, and sometimes pork or lamb. <br/> 
🎧 I also visit the dairy section, where I can buy milk and cheese. <br/> 
🎧 Sometimes I also buy ice cream or yogurt.<br/>
🎧 When I have finished in the meat and dairy sections, I then move to the bakery section.<br/>
🎧 This is where loaves of bread are baked and sold. <br/> 
🎧 There are many different kinds of bread in the bakery section. <br/> 
🎧 The bakery section also sells pasta, such as macaroni and spaghetti. <br/> 
🎧 And, of course, you can buy pies, cakes, and cookies in the bakery section.<br/>
🎧 These foods are very sweet and tasty!<br/> 
🎧 I also pick up a few other things at the supermarket, such as soap, toothpaste, and cleaning supplies. <br/> 
🎧 But sometimes I forget to buy something that I had planned to get.<br/>
🎧 Maybe I should make a list of the things I need to buy

🎧 When the hot summer weather arrives, many people like to cool off by visiting the beach.<br/>
🎧 often, there is a cool breeze that comes off the water. <br/> 
🎧 And, of course, the water itself is cool and refreshing.<br/>
🎧 One of the favourite activities at the beach is building sandcastles. <br/> 
🎧 Children use small shovels and pails to move the sand. <br/> 
🎧 They can build small forts and castles by carefully forming and shaping the sand. <br/> 
🎧 Building sandcastles is a lot of fun, but you shouldn't build them too close to the water: a wave might come and wash your sandcastle away!<br/> 
🎧 There are also many games that people like to play at the beach. <br/> 
🎧 Some people play catch with a small plastic disc called a Frisbee. <br/> 
🎧 The Frisbee glides smoothly through the air.<br/>
🎧 Other people like to play beach volleyball in the soft sand.<br/>
🎧 Some people prefer just to relax on the beach. <br/> 
🎧 They like to lie down on a blanket and feel the warm sunshine. <br/> 
🎧 I like to sit on the beach with an ice-cream cone. <br/> 
🎧 But you have to eat it quickly, before it melts.<br/>
🎧 Of course, the main attraction of a beach is the water. <br/> 
🎧 Many children learn to swim at the beach, and enjoy playing in the water. <br/> 
🎧 Some people like to swim vigorously. <br/> 
🎧 Other people like to relax in the water on an inflatable, floating mattress. <br/> 
🎧 Other people just wade around in the water, as a way to keep cool. <br/> 
🎧 When it is a windy day, some people try sports such as surfing.<br/>
🎧 Going to the beach is surely one of the best ways to spend a summer day

🎧 Ummmm. Something smells good! <br/> 
🎧 My friend's mom is making cookies. <br/> 
🎧 They are chocolate chip, my favourite! <br/> 
🎧 I think I'll go home and ask my mom if we can make cookies, too.<br/>

🎧 We set the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. <br/> 
🎧 Then, we mix all of the flour and other stuff (ingredients) together. <br/> 
🎧 Last, we add the chocolate chips. <br/> 
🎧 We drop the batter by big teaspoons full onto the cookie sheets. <br/> 
🎧 We set the timer for 12 minutes and just sit back and enjoy the good smell!<br/> 
🎧 The buzzer rings. <br/> 
🎧 We take the cookies out. <br/> 
🎧 Oh, do they look good! We don't even wait for them to cool down. <br/>

🎧 "Twinkle, twinkle, little star, how I wonder what you are; up above the world so high, like a diamond in the sky, twinkle, twinkle little star." <br/> 
🎧 This is a little poem/song I always say when I am outside, and I see the stars. <br/> 
🎧 When I see the first star of the night, I sometimes say this one: "Star light, star bright, first star I see tonight; I wish I may; I wish I might, have the wish I wish tonight." <br/> 
🎧 Do you have a special thing to say about the stars?<br/> 
🎧 Stars are beautiful bright spots in the sky. <br/> 
🎧 Stars are usually seen at night when it is dark.<br/>
🎧 We can't see them in the day time because the sun is so bright, the brightest star of all. <br/> 
🎧 I like staying up late just to look at the stars.<br/>
🎧 One time I was outside at midnight, and the stars seemed to sparkle and dance. <br/> 
🎧 They really did look like diamonds dancing in the sky!<br/> 
🎧 If you watch the stars long enough, you may see a falling star or a shooting star. <br/> 
🎧 I have seen both. <br/> 
🎧 A falling star is where the star just seems to drop, and it leaves a trail of what appears like star dust. <br/> 
🎧 A shooting star is very beautiful. <br/> 
🎧 It "shoots" across the sky leaving a long trail of colourful "star dust." <br/> 
🎧 Shooting stars seem to brighten up the whole sky. <br/> 
🎧 They usually seem quite close to the earth.<br/>
🎧 Have you ever watched the stars and got the urge to reach out and touch them, or even to join them in their secret dance? <br/> 
🎧 I wonder what it would be like to see a star up close.<br/>
🎧 Would it look like the moon? <br/> 
🎧 Maybe one day when I am older, I will go up in a rocket ship and visit the dancing stars in the midnight sky

🎧 A song comes on the radio. <br/> 
🎧 My lips start to move, singing along. <br/> 
🎧 My fingers start to snap; my feet begin to tap. <br/> 
🎧 The music sinks deep into my soul. I listen to the music as it fills my brain, and I remember when I used to sing. <br/> 
🎧 I sang in front of huge crowds. <br/> 
🎧 I loved it when they watched me and clapped for me when I was finished.<br/>
🎧 Letting out my feelings when I was sad, mad, happy, or glad was when I would sing. <br/> 
🎧 I sang in the shower; I sang in the rain; I sang in church; I sang walking down the street!<br/> 
🎧 Music has always been a big part of my life. <br/> 
🎧 It seems like I was a baby when I started playing the piano! <br/> 
🎧 I would sit on my sister's lap while she played the piano, and I would bang on the keys. <br/> 
🎧 I remember sitting beside her and learning how to sing. <br/> 
🎧 I sang my little lungs out!<br/> 
🎧 As I grew, I listened to other singers on tapes, the radio and C.D.s. I took those things that I heard from different singers and made myself sound like them. <br/> 
🎧 Soon, I could take what I had heard all my life and make it into my own sound.<br/>
🎧 I have always liked singing jazz and blues. <br/> 
🎧 I don't listen to jazz and blues a lot, however. <br/> 
🎧 I listen to pop, rock, classical and some country. <br/> 
🎧 As you can see, I like many types of music. <br/> 
🎧 I have seen musicals, too, like Phantom of the Opera and Les Miserables. <br/> 
🎧 those musicals were amazing. <br/> 
🎧 There were such bright costumes and stage sets, not to mention the wonderful songs and singing.<br/>
🎧 Music has been on this earth since the beginning of time, and it touches every one in a different way. <br/> 
🎧 I know it has not only touched me, but is a big part of my very being

🎧 Her mom just calmed her down and said, "Take one day at a time, Natalie. <br/> 
🎧 Worry only about today." <br/> 
🎧 "Hmmm. You're right, Mom. Thanks!"<br/> 
🎧 Natalie was very scared on the first day of school. <br/> 
🎧 She made sure she had all of the books she needed and lots of pens, pencils and erasers. <br/> 
🎧 She walked into the front of the building and went on her way to try and find her classroom.<br/>
🎧 Natalie got through her classes and met a lot of new people, nice people. <br/> 
🎧 Her classes seemed to go by really fast, and the day went by even faster.<br/>
🎧 When Natalie got home she was so excited. <br/> 
🎧 She told her mom that classes weren't all that scary; the students and the teachers weren't scary either! <br/> 
🎧 Natalie knew that the school work would be hard, but she felt good about the people she had met that day. <br/> 
🎧 She knew she'd have a good year
