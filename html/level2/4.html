🎧 Mary's parents just got a divorce.<br/>
🎧 Mary is very upset.<br/>
🎧 She thinks that her parents don't love her anymore.<br/>
🎧 She thinks that they got a divorce because of her.<br/>
🎧 She is wrong.<br/>
🎧 Her parents love her just as much as they always did.<br/>
🎧 They aren't getting divorced because of Mary.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes, marriages just don't work out.<br/>
🎧 It isn't really anyone's fault.<br/>
🎧 Marriage isn't easy.<br/>
🎧 It is hard for two people to stay together for a lifetime.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes, people change as they get older, and they move on.<br/>
🎧 Some people have perfectly good marriages, and they stay together for their entire lives.<br/>
🎧 Divorce doesn't happen because the parents don't love the children anymore.<br/>
🎧 A lot of children feel that it is their fault, but it isn't their fault at all.<br/>
🎧 Children neither cause the divorce, nor can they prevent it.<br/>
🎧 It is up to the parents.<br/>
🎧 Divorce isn't the end of the world.<br/>
🎧 Children can still see both parents and stay with them.<br/>
🎧 Life goes on.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes children can get new stepmothers or stepfathers.<br/>
🎧 That can be a good thing.<br/>
🎧 You just have to be understanding, and know that your parents still love you.<br/>
🎧 Life doesn't always go the way that we planned it, but it has its twists and turns.<br/>
🎧 Life is an adventure.<br/>
🎧 If your parents get a divorce, just be understanding. <br/> 
🎧 Know that they love you and that this is a hard time for them.<br/>
🎧 It is a hard time for you too, but these things have a way of working themselves out in the end

🎧 I have a goldfish.<br/>
🎧 He swims around in his bowl all day.<br/>
🎧 He looks bored.<br/>
🎧 I look inside the bowl and watch him.<br/>
🎧 His mouth always moves.<br/>
🎧 He looks like he is talking.<br/>
🎧 I imagine what my goldfish would say if he really could talk.<br/>
🎧 I think he would say:<br/> 
🎧 "Hey, I'm bored in this little bowl.<br/>
🎧 Why don't you get me a bigger tank with more fish in it?<br/> 
🎧 I would like to have some friends to swim around with."<br/> 
🎧 I went out and bought a bigger tank for my goldfish.<br/>
🎧 I put some plants at the bottom of the tank, and I got a miniature deep-sea diver to put at the bottom of the tank.<br/>
🎧 I looked into the tank and imagined what my goldfish was saying.<br/>
🎧 He seemed to be saying:<br/> 
🎧 "This is a nice tank.<br/>
🎧 It's roomy in here, and you decorated it well, but I still don't have any friends to swim with."<br/> 
🎧 I went to the pet store and bought three more goldfish.<br/>
🎧 I put them into the tank.<br/>
🎧 All of the goldfish seemed to look at each other.<br/>
🎧 They swam near each other and seemed to be playing games.<br/>
🎧 I knew which one was my goldfish because he has a black spot on his fin.<br/>
🎧 I looked at him, and imagined that he was talking again.<br/>
🎧 He said:<br/> 
🎧 "This is great!<br/> 
🎧 I have a big new home and friends to swim with.<br/>
🎧 These are nice goldfish that you brought home for me; thank you."<br/> 
🎧 Goldfish can't really talk.<br/>
🎧 I know that.<br/>
🎧 I just like to pretend that my goldfish talks.<br/>
🎧 He seems very happy now with his nice new home, and his new friends.<br/>
🎧 I don't think goldfish can smile either, but it looks like my goldfish has a smile on his face

🎧 I have had a lot of teachers.<br/>
🎧 Some of them were good, and some of them were boring.<br/>
🎧 There is one teacher whom I remember very well. <br/> 
🎧 He is the best teacher that I ever had.<br/>
🎧 His name was Mr. Alban.<br/>
🎧 He was a history teacher.<br/>
🎧 History is not my favorite subject.<br/>
🎧 I don't really enjoy history a lot.<br/>
🎧 When I was in Mr. Alban's class, he made history seem exciting.<br/>
🎧 He was more of an actor than a teacher.<br/>
🎧 If he was describing a war, he would make us feel all the emotions that the soldiers and their families would have felt.<br/>
🎧 We could almost hear the guns firing and the people shouting.<br/>
🎧 He would paint a picture in our minds that was very vivid.<br/>
🎧 When I had a history test in his class, I didn't have to study much.<br/>
🎧 I would remember every word that he had said.<br/>
🎧 I would see him doing the actions that went along with his stories.<br/>
🎧 He was very animated.<br/>
🎧 He would shout out orders as if he was a general, or he would speak softly and reverently when describing the death of a great hero.<br/>
🎧 The most important thing that I learned from Mr. Alban was that I did really like history.<br/>
🎧 I just thought that I didn't like it because most people had made it dull by just reading from the textbooks.<br/>
🎧 History is not just a series of dates and dull facts.<br/>
🎧 History is what really happened.<br/>
🎧 History is real life.<br/>
🎧 All the historical figures had real families and emotions.<br/>
🎧 They weren't just fictional people.<br/>
🎧 After I took history from Mr. Alban, I realized that I really did have an interest in it.<br/>
🎧 He was my favorite teacher, and I will always be grateful to him for making me aware of just how interesting history really is

🎧 Sometimes, I watch the weatherman on television.<br/>
🎧 It is fascinating to watch him point to different areas of the country on the map.<br/>
🎧 He tells us where the weather will be nice and where it will be bad.<br/>
🎧 The weatherman is not always right.<br/>
🎧 Weather reporting is not an exact science.<br/>
🎧 Nothing is very exact when it comes to the weather.<br/>
🎧 The weather department does a lot of research, but they can never be sure of exactly what will happen.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes, it looks like it will be clear, but the wind changes direction and clouds move in.<br/>
🎧 The weatherman can warn people if there is a chance of a hurricane or tornado.<br/>
🎧 The weatherman can also warn people of floods.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes, entire towns have to be evacuated because of bad weather.<br/>
🎧 It is important to be aware of the weather.<br/>
🎧 For example, it is not good to be caught in the middle of a field when there is going to be a thunderstorm. <br/> 
🎧 You might want to take extra precautions if there is going to be a heavy snowstorm.<br/>
🎧 You would need to be in a secure place if a hurricane or tornado was predicted.<br/>
🎧 You might want to cancel a picnic if you knew that it would rain that day.<br/>
🎧 The weather affects us in so many ways.<br/>
🎧 Some people are really affected by dull, cloudy days.<br/>
🎧 If there are no sunny days, they become very depressed.<br/>
🎧 Heavy air pressure can cause some people to have headaches.<br/>
🎧 Weather affects all of us in one way or another.<br/>
🎧 It is always a topic of conversation.<br/>
🎧 People often say things like "hello, it's a beautiful day today."<br/> 
🎧 often we plan our lives and activities around the weather.<br/>
🎧 So, if you are planning on walking home tonight, keep an eye on the sky.<br/>
🎧 Are those rain clouds up there?<br/> 
🎧 You might need an umbrella

🎧 How many colds do you catch in a year?<br/> 
🎧 Most of my friends catch quite a few colds.<br/>
🎧 They cough, sniffle and sneeze.<br/>
🎧 They carry around tissues and blow their noses all the time.<br/>
🎧 Their eyes water, and they have scratchy throats.<br/>
🎧 I don't get many colds.<br/>
🎧 In fact, I can go for a whole year and never catch a cold.<br/>
🎧 That is why I consider myself an expert on how not to catch a cold.<br/>
🎧 I'll tell you how to avoid catching a cold.<br/>
🎧 I think that you need to take a lot of vitamin C.<br/>
🎧 I eat a lot of fruits and vegetables.<br/>
🎧 I drink fruit juice too.<br/>
🎧 I also take vitamin C pills.<br/>
🎧 Whenever I begin to feel a cold coming on, I make sure that I have taken my vitamin C pill, and I drink a lot of orange juice.<br/>
🎧 That usually knocks the cold right out of my system.<br/>
🎧 I make sure that I get a lot of fresh air.<br/>
🎧 In the winter, a lot of buildings are shut up tight so that the air is stale, and people's germs circulate through the buildings.<br/>
🎧 I get outside and breathe in fresh clean air.<br/>
🎧 If somebody is rude enough to cough or sneeze right in front of me without covering his or her mouth, I just hold my breath for a second.<br/>
🎧 I'm not sure if this works or not, but I don't want to breathe in anybody's cold germs.<br/>
🎧 Many germs are passed through hands.<br/>
🎧 It is important to wash your hands thoroughly if you touch anything in a public place.<br/>
🎧 If I hold a banister while I am walking down the stairs, I think of all the people who have used that banister, and I make sure that I wash my hands before I eat.<br/>
🎧 Doorknobs also have a lot of germs on them.<br/>
🎧 Money is another thing that is passed from hand to hand and is covered with germs.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes, I see people stick money into their mouths. <br/> 
🎧 Just think of all the germs that you would be putting into your mouth if you did that.<br/>
🎧 If you just give it a little bit of thought, you can avoid a lot of the germs that cause colds.<br/>
🎧 If you eat good foods and stay fit, your body will be able to fight off the germs that cause colds and other diseases.<br/>
🎧 It is not always possible to avoid colds, but if you do catch a cold, drink plenty of fluids and get a lot of rest

🎧 I sometimes wonder what life will be like in the future.<br/>
🎧 Life has changed so much in just the past few years.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure that there are still big changes that are coming.<br/>
🎧 Do you think we'll still drive cars?<br/> 
🎧 Maybe we'll get into computerized vehicles that we won't have to drive.<br/>
🎧 We'll just push a few buttons, and the vehicles will take us to wherever we have to go.<br/>
🎧 Maybe there won't be roads.<br/>
🎧 We might just fly through space to get where we want to go.<br/>
🎧 Instead of telephones, we'll just use our computers.<br/>
🎧 We'll be able to see each other when we talk.<br/>
🎧 That type of thing is already happening.<br/>
🎧 Maybe we won't have to cook our meals.<br/>
🎧 We might be able to push buttons to order whatever we want.<br/>
🎧 A nice roast beef dinner, or an ice cream sundae, might just pop out of a machine.<br/>
🎧 It would be nice to have a robot to clean the house for you.<br/>
🎧 In the past few years, computers have been extremely important.<br/>
🎧 People used to write to each other through the mail.<br/>
🎧 Now, people communicate so much more frequently through E-mail.<br/>
🎧 Most of my friends own computers.<br/>
🎧 If we had all of these things to do the work for us, what would we do?<br/> 
🎧 We would still need people to program the computers.<br/>
🎧 We could spend more time being creative, rather than doing everyday chores.<br/>
🎧 The future holds many surprises.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure that technology will become even more and more amazing.<br/>
🎧 When my parents were young, they had never even seen a color television.<br/>
🎧 Nobody owned a computer.<br/>
🎧 It doesn't take long for things to change a lot.<br/>
🎧 Who knows what amazing things are in store for us

🎧 I gave a speech to three hundred people.<br/>
🎧 I had to speak in front of a group of students.<br/>
🎧 I had to tell them about a campaign that we were having to raise money for cancer research.<br/>
🎧 Giving a speech can be a difficult thing. <br/> 
🎧 When you stand in front of a big crowd, you can get very nervous.<br/>
🎧 Some people feel like they have weak knees.<br/>
🎧 Their legs feel as if they are made of rubber.<br/>
🎧 Their heart beats very hard inside of their chest.<br/>
🎧 Their palms get sweaty.<br/>
🎧 Some people even become short of breath.<br/>
🎧 For some people, giving a speech is their worst fear.<br/>
🎧 When you give a speech, everyone is looking at you.<br/>
🎧 They are waiting to hear what you have to say.<br/>
🎧 When you have three hundred people looking at you; you have six hundred eyes that are on you.<br/>
🎧 It is a little frightening when you think of it that way.<br/>
🎧 Before I give a speech, I take three big breaths.<br/>
🎧 I calm myself, and I remind myself that what I have to say is important.<br/>
🎧 I like to be sure of what I am going to say, so I practice my speech in front of a mirror at home.<br/>
🎧 I like to look like I am relaxed and friendly.<br/>
🎧 They say that practice makes perfect; so the more speeches that you give, the better you will become at it.<br/>
🎧 Whenever I have to give a speech, I imagine that the audience is just one big person.<br/>
🎧 I look out into the audience until I find a friendly, smiling face.<br/>
🎧 I focus on that person, and I pretend that I am just talking to them.<br/>
🎧 I have become used to giving speeches.<br/>
🎧 I am more relaxed now than I used to be.<br/>
🎧 People tell me that I do not look nervous at all.<br/>
🎧 I like to hear that.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes I do feel a little flutter of nervousness, but I just ignore it and do the best that I can.<br/>
🎧 Giving a speech is not as scary as it appears to be.<br/>
🎧 Anyone can do it with a little practice

🎧 My friend Steve moved to another country.<br/>
🎧 He had lived in Canada all his life, and he moved to Japan.<br/>
🎧 Life in Japan was very different for Steve than what he was used to.<br/>
🎧 At first, Steve suffered from culture shock.<br/>
🎧 His whole life seemed different.<br/>
🎧 He was not used to the way of life in Japan.<br/>
🎧 Steve was not used to the large crowds of people that walked up and down the streets in Japan.<br/>
🎧 In his hometown in Canada, the streets were fairly quiet.<br/>
🎧 Steve had to get used to the food.<br/>
🎧 In Japan, the people eat a lot of fish.<br/>
🎧 Steve had never eaten much fish before.<br/>
🎧 Steve wanted pizza, but it was expensive in Japan. <br/> 
🎧 Steve said that he had to adjust his eating habits.<br/>
🎧 The people in Japan have different customs than we do here in Canada.<br/>
🎧 Steve didn't want to offend anyone, so he had to learn the customs.<br/>
🎧 He had to learn about what Japanese people considered polite and rude.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes, in a foreign country you can do something to insult someone without even realizing that you are being rude.<br/>
🎧 At first, Steve had trouble with the language.<br/>
🎧 He said that the only way to really learn the language is to talk to people.<br/>
🎧 Steve talked to a lot of people.<br/>
🎧 He made a lot of mistakes, but people were patient with him, and they tried to help him with his Japanese.<br/>
🎧 It wasn't long before Steve felt more comfortable in his new surroundings.<br/>
🎧 You have to be willing to learn new customs and a new language if you move to another country.<br/>
🎧 Steve feels very comfortable in Japan, and in Canada now.<br/>
🎧 He is thinking about going to another country now.<br/>
🎧 He thinks that he might like to try and live in Italy.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure that he would get over his culture shock very fast if he moved there.<br/>
🎧 Moving to a new country can be difficult, but if you are willing to learn, it can be a very rewarding experience

🎧 I have learned that things don't always go the way that they were planned.<br/>
🎧 If something doesn't happen the way that I want it to, I try to make the best of the situation.<br/>
🎧 I always try to find something good in everything that happens.<br/>
🎧 Last year, I broke my ankle when I was walking on an icy sidewalk.<br/>
🎧 At first, I was very upset.<br/>
🎧 I was missing school, and there was a party that I wanted to go to.<br/>
🎧 I couldn't do very much of anything.<br/>
🎧 My ankle was very sore.<br/>
🎧 I stayed home, and I read a book.<br/>
🎧 It was an excellent book, and one that I probably would not have had time to read under normal circumstances.<br/>
🎧 My friends brought my homework to my house, and we had some really nice visits while they were here.<br/>
🎧 I had to accept the fact that I couldn't go anywhere on my broken ankle, so I made the best of a bad situation.<br/>
🎧 Once, I lost my way when I was out camping.<br/>
🎧 I ended up in a very large field.<br/>
🎧 I was afraid that nobody would find me, but I calmed myself down and took time to examine all the interesting wildflowers in the field.<br/>
🎧 My family did find me.<br/>
🎧 They were surprised at how calm I was.<br/>
🎧 I have learned that there is something valuable inside every adventure and something beautiful inside every person. <br/> 
🎧 We had a new boy who came into our class.<br/>
🎧 His clothes weren't in style, and he was not particularly handsome.<br/>
🎧 Some of the boys and girls made fun of him.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes, people can be really cruel.<br/>
🎧 He seemed to handle it all right, but inside, I knew that it must hurt.<br/>
🎧 Some of my friends and I invited him out with us.<br/>
🎧 We found out that he had a terrific sense of humor, and he is probably one of the nicest people that I have ever met.<br/>
🎧 He has since become one of my best friends.<br/>
🎧 It makes me ashamed when someone that I know judges someone by how they look.<br/>
🎧 It isn't fair to do that.<br/>
🎧 You'll find that something good comes out of almost every situation.<br/>
🎧 You'll find something good about almost everyone that you meet if you look hard enough.<br/>
🎧 If something doesn't work out the way you planned it, just make the best of the situation.<br/>

🎧 When I was an infant, I got a rag doll.<br/>
🎧 It was a very plain, little doll, and it wore a clown outfit and a clown's hat.<br/>
🎧 I used to take that doll to bed with me every night.<br/>
🎧 I couldn't go to bed without my doll.<br/>
🎧 My mother used to pretend that the doll was talking to me.<br/>
🎧 She would make the doll dance and sing songs.<br/>
🎧 I would talk to the doll.<br/>
🎧 My mother would answer for the doll, but I was a baby, and I thought that the doll was actually talking to me.<br/>
🎧 That doll was my best friend.<br/>
🎧 I took her everywhere.<br/>
🎧 One time I took her to a store with me, and I left her on a shelf in the store.<br/>
🎧 We were halfway home when I realized that I didn't have my doll with me.<br/>
🎧 I was very upset.<br/>
🎧 My mother and I rushed back to the store.<br/>
🎧 My doll was still there.<br/>
🎧 I was so relieved.<br/>
🎧 I hugged my doll, and I promised myself that I would never leave her anywhere again.<br/>
🎧 I couldn't imagine life without that doll.<br/>
🎧 Through the years, the doll became less important in my life.<br/>
🎧 I had other things to do, but the doll still sat on my bed during the day, and I still took it to bed at night.<br/>
🎧 I gave that doll a lot of love when I was little.<br/>
🎧 In fact, I loved the doll so much that she looks tattered and torn now.<br/>
🎧 There are parts of her face and hands that are almost worn away.<br/>
🎧 I had a lot of other toys when I was little, but none of them were ever so important as that doll.<br/>
🎧 I don't play with toys anymore, but that doll is still in my room.<br/>
🎧 She sits in a special chair in the corner. <br/> 
🎧 I'll always have that doll.<br/>
🎧 No matter how worn out she is, I'll always keep her and cherish her as a part of my early childhood
