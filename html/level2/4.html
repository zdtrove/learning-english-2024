🎧 <span>Sometimes</span>, <span>marriages</span> <span>just</span> don't <span>work</span> <span>out</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>It</span> isn't <span>really</span> <span>anyone's</span> <span>fault</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>Life</span> doesn't <span>always</span> <span>go</span> the way <span>that</span> <span>we</span> <span>planned</span> <span>it</span>, but <span>it</span> has its <span>twists</span> and <span>turns</span>.<br/>

🎧 I have a <span>goldfish</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>He</span> <span>swims</span> <span>around</span> <span>in</span> his <span>bowl</span> all <span>day</span>.<br/>

🎧 I <span>went</span> to the pet <span>store</span> and <span>bought</span> <span>three</span> <span>more</span> <span>goldfish</span>.<br/>
🎧 I put <span>them</span> <span>into</span> the <span>tank</span>.<br/>

🎧 I <span>knew</span> which one was my <span>goldfish</span> <span>because</span> <span>he</span> has a <span>black</span> <span>spot</span> <span>on</span> his <span>fin</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>looked</span> <span>at</span> him, and <span>imagined</span> <span>that</span> <span>he</span> was <span>talking</span> <span>again</span>.<br/>

🎧 I have had a lot <span>of</span> <span>teachers</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Some</span> <span>of</span> <span>them</span> <span>were</span> <span>good</span>, and <span>some</span> <span>of</span> <span>them</span> <span>were</span> <span>boring</span>.<br/>
🎧 There <span>is</span> one <span>teacher</span> whom I <span>remember</span> <span>very</span> <span>well</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>He</span> <span>is</span> the <span>best</span> <span>teacher</span> <span>that</span> I <span>ever</span> <span>had</span>.<br/>
🎧 His <span>name</span> was <span>Mr</span>. <span>Alban</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>He</span> was a <span>history</span> <span>teacher</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>History</span> <span>is</span> not my <span>favorite</span> <span>subject</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't <span>really</span> <span>enjoy</span> <span>history</span> a <span>lot</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I was <span>in</span> <span>Mr</span>. <span>Alban's</span> <span>class</span>, <span>he</span> <span>made</span> <span>history</span> <span>seem</span> <span>exciting</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>He</span> was <span>more</span> <span>of</span> an <span>actor</span> <span>than</span> a <span>teacher</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>If</span> <span>he</span> was <span>describing</span> a war, <span>he</span> <span>would</span> <span>make</span> <span>us</span> <span>feel</span> all the <span>emotions</span> <span>that</span> the <span>soldiers</span> and <span>their</span> <span>families</span> <span>would</span> have <span>felt</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>We</span> <span>could</span> <span>almost</span> <span>hear</span> the <span>guns</span> <span>firing</span> and the <span>people</span> <span>shouting</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>He</span> <span>would</span> <span>paint</span> a <span>picture</span> <span>in</span> our <span>minds</span> <span>that</span> was <span>very</span> <span>vivid</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I had a <span>history</span> <span>test</span> <span>in</span> his <span>class</span>, I didn't have to <span>study</span> <span>much</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>would</span> <span>remember</span> <span>every</span> <span>word</span> <span>that</span> <span>he</span> had <span>said</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>would</span> see him <span>doing</span> the <span>actions</span> <span>that</span> <span>went</span> <span>along</span> <span>with</span> his <span>stories</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>He</span> was <span>very</span> <span>animated</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>He</span> <span>would</span> <span>shout</span> out <span>orders</span> <span>as</span> <span>if</span> <span>he</span> was a <span>general</span>, <span>or</span> <span>he</span> <span>would</span> <span>speak</span> <span>softly</span> and <span>reverently</span> when <span>describing</span> the <span>death</span> <span>of</span> a <span>great</span> <span>hero</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>most</span> <span>important</span> <span>thing</span> <span>that</span> I <span>learned</span> <span>from</span> <span>Mr</span>. <span>Alban</span> was <span>that</span> I did <span>really</span> <span>like</span> <span>history</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>just</span> <span>thought</span> <span>that</span> I didn't <span>like</span> <span>it</span> <span>because</span> <span>most</span> <span>people</span> had <span>made</span> <span>it</span> <span>dull</span> by <span>just</span> <span>reading</span> <span>from</span> the <span>textbooks</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>History</span> <span>is</span> not <span>just</span> a <span>series</span> <span>of</span> <span>dates</span> and <span>dull</span> <span>facts</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>History</span> <span>is</span> what <span>really</span> <span>happened</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>History</span> <span>is</span> <span>real</span> <span>life</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>After</span> I <span>took</span> <span>history</span> <span>from</span> <span>Mr</span>. <span>Alban</span>, I <span>realized</span> <span>that</span> I <span>really</span> did have an <span>interest</span> <span>in</span> <span>it</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>He</span> was my <span>favorite</span> <span>teacher</span>, and I <span>will</span> <span>always</span> be <span>grateful</span> to him for <span>making</span> me <span>aware</span> <span>of</span> <span>just</span> how <span>interesting</span> <span>history</span> <span>really</span> <span>is.<br/>

🎧 <span>Sometimes</span>, I <span>watch</span> the <span>weatherman</span> <span>on</span> <span>television</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>It</span> <span>is</span> <span>fascinating</span> to <span>watch</span> him <span>point</span> to <span>different</span> <span>areas</span> <span>of</span> the <span>country</span> <span>on</span> the <span>map</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>Nothing</span> <span>is</span> <span>very</span> <span>exact</span> when <span>it</span> <span>comes</span> to the <span>weather</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>weather</span> <span>department</span> <span>does</span> a lot <span>of</span> <span>research</span>, but <span>they</span> can <span>never</span> be <span>sure</span> <span>of</span> <span>exactly</span> what <span>will</span> <span>happen</span>.<br/>

🎧 How <span>many</span> <span>colds</span> do you <span>catch</span> <span>in</span> a <span>year?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Most</span> <span>of</span> my <span>friends</span> <span>catch</span> <span>quite</span> a few <span>colds</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>They</span> <span>cough</span>, <span>sniffle</span> and <span>sneeze</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>Their</span> <span>eyes</span> <span>water</span>, and <span>they</span> have <span>scratchy</span> <span>throats</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't get <span>many</span> <span>colds</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>In</span> <span>fact</span>, I can <span>go</span> for a <span>whole</span> <span>year</span> and <span>never</span> <span>catch</span> a <span>cold</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>That</span> <span>is</span> why I <span>consider</span> <span>myself</span> an <span>expert</span> <span>on</span> how not to <span>catch</span> a <span>cold</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>I'll</span> <span>tell</span> you how to <span>avoid</span> <span>catching</span> a <span>cold</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>think</span> <span>that</span> you <span>need</span> to <span>take</span> a lot <span>of</span> <span>vitamin</span> <span>C</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>That</span> <span>usually</span> <span>knocks</span> the <span>cold</span> <span>right</span> out <span>of</span> my <span>system</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>In</span> the <span>winter</span>, a lot <span>of</span> <span>buildings</span> are <span>shut</span> <span>up</span> <span>tight</span> so <span>that</span> the air <span>is</span> <span>stale</span>, and <span>people's</span> <span>germs</span> <span>circulate</span> <span>through</span> the <span>buildings</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>If</span> <span>somebody</span> <span>is</span> <span>rude</span> <span>enough</span> to <span>cough</span> <span>or</span> <span>sneeze</span> <span>right</span> <span>in</span> <span>front</span> <span>of</span> me <span>without</span> <span>covering</span> his <span>or</span> her <span>mouth</span>, I <span>just</span> <span>hold</span> my <span>breath</span> for a <span>second</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>I'm</span> not <span>sure</span> <span>if</span> <span>this</span> <span>works</span> <span>or</span> not, but I don't <span>want</span> to <span>breathe</span> <span>in</span> <span>anybody's</span> <span>cold</span> <span>germs</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Many</span> <span>germs</span> are <span>passed</span> <span>through</span> <span>hands</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>It</span> <span>is</span> <span>important</span> to <span>wash</span> your <span>hands</span> <span>thoroughly</span> <span>if</span> you <span>touch</span> <span>anything</span> <span>in</span> a <span>public</span> <span>place</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>If</span> I <span>hold</span> a <span>banister</span> <span>while</span> I <span>am</span> <span>walking</span> <span>down</span> the <span>stairs</span>, I <span>think</span> <span>of</span> all the <span>people</span> who have <span>used</span> <span>that</span> <span>banister</span>, and I <span>make</span> <span>sure</span> <span>that</span> I <span>wash</span> my <span>hands</span> <span>before</span> I <span>eat</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Doorknobs</span> <span>also</span> have a lot <span>of</span> <span>germs</span> <span>on</span> <span>them</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Money</span> <span>is</span> <span>another</span> <span>thing</span> <span>that</span> <span>is</span> <span>passed</span> <span>from</span> <span>hand</span> to <span>hand</span> and <span>is</span> <span>covered</span> <span>with</span> <span>germs</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span>, I see <span>people</span> <span>stick</span> <span>money</span> <span>into</span> <span>their</span> <span>mouths</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Just</span> <span>think</span> <span>of</span> all the <span>germs</span> <span>that</span> you <span>would</span> be <span>putting</span> <span>into</span> your <span>mouth</span> <span>if</span> you did <span>that</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>If</span> you <span>just</span> <span>give</span> <span>it</span> a <span>little</span> bit <span>of</span> <span>thought</span>, you can <span>avoid</span> a lot <span>of</span> the <span>germs</span> <span>that</span> <span>cause</span> <span>colds</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>If</span> you eat <span>good</span> <span>foods</span> and <span>stay</span> fit, your <span>body</span> <span>will</span> be <span>able</span> to <span>fight</span> off the <span>germs</span> <span>that</span> <span>cause</span> <span>colds</span> and <span>other</span> <span>diseases</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>It</span> <span>is</span> not <span>always</span> <span>possible</span> to <span>avoid</span> <span>colds</span>, but <span>if</span> you do <span>catch</span> a <span>cold</span>, <span>drink</span> <span>plenty</span> <span>of</span> <span>fluids</span> and get a lot <span>of</span> <span>rest.<br/>

🎧 I had to <span>give</span> a <span>speech</span> <span>last</span> <span>week</span>.<br/>

🎧 I had to <span>tell</span> <span>them</span> <span>about</span> a <span>campaign</span> <span>that</span> <span>we</span> <span>were</span> <span>having</span> to <span>raise</span> <span>money</span> for <span>cancer</span> <span>research</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Giving</span> a <span>speech</span> can be a <span>difficult</span> <span>thing</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 When you <span>stand</span> <span>in</span> <span>front</span> <span>of</span> a big <span>crowd</span>, you can get <span>very</span> <span>nervous</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Some</span> <span>people</span> <span>feel</span> <span>like</span> <span>they</span> have <span>weak</span> <span>knees</span>.<br/>

🎧 For <span>some</span> <span>people</span>, <span>giving</span> a <span>speech</span> <span>is</span> <span>their</span> <span>worst</span> <span>fear</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you <span>give</span> a <span>speech</span>, <span>everyone</span> <span>is</span> <span>looking</span> <span>at</span> <span>you</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>Before</span> I <span>give</span> a <span>speech</span>, I <span>take</span> <span>three</span> big <span>breaths</span>.<br/>

🎧 I <span>like</span> to be <span>sure</span> <span>of</span> what I <span>am</span> <span>going</span> to say, so I <span>practice</span> my <span>speech</span> <span>in</span> <span>front</span> <span>of</span> a <span>mirror</span> <span>at</span> <span>home</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>like</span> to <span>look</span> <span>like</span> I <span>am</span> <span>relaxed</span> and <span>friendly</span>.<br/>

🎧 I <span>like</span> to <span>hear</span> <span>that</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span> I do <span>feel</span> a <span>little</span> <span>flutter</span> <span>of</span> <span>nervousness</span>, but I <span>just</span> <span>ignore</span> <span>it</span> and do the <span>best</span> <span>that</span> I <span>can</span>.<br/>

🎧 I <span>ended</span> <span>up</span> <span>in</span> a <span>very</span> <span>large</span> <span>field</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>afraid</span> <span>that</span> <span>nobody</span> <span>would</span> <span>find</span> me, but I <span>calmed</span> <span>myself</span> <span>down</span> and <span>took</span> <span>time</span> to <span>examine</span> all the <span>interesting</span> <span>wildflowers</span> <span>in</span> the <span>field</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>family</span> did <span>find</span> <span>me</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>They</span> <span>were</span> <span>surprised</span> <span>at</span> how <span>calm</span> I <span>was</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have <span>learned</span> <span>that</span> there <span>is</span> <span>something</span> <span>valuable</span> <span>inside</span> <span>every</span> <span>adventure</span> and <span>something</span> <span>beautiful</span> <span>inside</span> <span>every</span> <span>person</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>We</span> had a new boy who <span>came</span> <span>into</span> our <span>class</span>.<br/>
🎧 His <span>clothes</span> weren't <span>in</span> <span>style</span>, and <span>he</span> was not <span>particularly</span> <span>handsome</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Some</span> <span>of</span> the <span>boys</span> and <span>girls</span> <span>made</span> fun <span>of</span> <span>him</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span>, <span>people</span> can be <span>really</span> <span>cruel</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>He</span> <span>seemed</span> to <span>handle</span> <span>it</span> all <span>right</span>, but <span>inside</span>, I <span>knew</span> <span>that</span> <span>it</span> <span>must</span> <span>hurt</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Some</span> <span>of</span> my <span>friends</span> and I <span>invited</span> him out <span>with</span> <span>us</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>We</span> <span>found</span> out <span>that</span> <span>he</span> had a <span>terrific</span> <span>sense</span> <span>of</span> <span>humor</span>, and <span>he</span> <span>is</span> <span>probably</span> one <span>of</span> the <span>nicest</span> <span>people</span> <span>that</span> I have <span>ever</span> <span>met</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>He</span> has <span>since</span> <span>become</span> one <span>of</span> my <span>best</span> <span>friends</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>It</span> <span>makes</span> me <span>ashamed</span> when <span>someone</span> <span>that</span> I <span>know</span> <span>judges</span> <span>someone</span> by how <span>they</span> <span>look</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>It</span> isn't <span>fair</span> to do <span>that</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll <span>find</span> <span>that</span> <span>something</span> <span>good</span> <span>comes</span> out <span>of</span> <span>almost</span> <span>every</span> <span>situation</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll <span>find</span> <span>something</span> <span>good</span> <span>about</span> <span>almost</span> <span>everyone</span> <span>that</span> you <span>meet</span> <span>if</span> you <span>look</span> <span>hard</span> <span>enough</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>If</span> <span>something</span> doesn't <span>work</span> out the way you <span>planned</span> <span>it</span>, <span>just</span> <span>make</span> the <span>best</span> <span>of</span> the <span>situation</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Look</span> for the <span>beauty</span> <span>in</span> <span>everything.<br/>

🎧 When I was an <span>infant</span>, I got a rag <span>doll</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>It</span> was a <span>very</span> <span>plain</span>, <span>little</span> <span>doll</span>, and <span>it</span> <span>wore</span> a <span>clown</span> <span>outfit</span> and a <span>clown's</span> <span>hat</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>used</span> to <span>take</span> <span>that</span> <span>doll</span> to bed <span>with</span> me <span>every</span> <span>night</span>.<br/>
🎧 I couldn't <span>go</span> to bed <span>without</span> my <span>doll</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mother</span> <span>used</span> to <span>pretend</span> <span>that</span> the <span>doll</span> was <span>talking</span> to <span>me</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>would</span> <span>make</span> the <span>doll</span> <span>dance</span> and <span>sing</span> <span>songs</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>would</span> <span>talk</span> to the <span>doll</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mother</span> <span>would</span> <span>answer</span> for the <span>doll</span>, but I was a <span>baby</span>, and I <span>thought</span> <span>that</span> the <span>doll</span> was <span>actually</span> <span>talking</span> to <span>me</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>That</span> <span>doll</span> was my <span>best</span> <span>friend</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>took</span> her <span>everywhere</span>.<br/>
🎧 One <span>time</span> I <span>took</span> her to a <span>store</span> <span>with</span> me, and I <span>left</span> her <span>on</span> a <span>shelf</span> <span>in</span> the <span>store</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>We</span> <span>were</span> <span>halfway</span> <span>home</span> when I <span>realized</span> <span>that</span> I didn't have my <span>doll</span> <span>with</span> <span>me</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>very</span> <span>upset</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mother</span> and I <span>rushed</span> <span>back</span> to the <span>store</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>doll</span> was <span>still</span> <span>there</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was so <span>relieved</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>hugged</span> my <span>doll</span>, and I <span>promised</span> <span>myself</span> <span>that</span> I <span>would</span> <span>never</span> <span>leave</span> her <span>anywhere</span> <span>again</span>.<br/>
🎧 I couldn't <span>imagine</span> <span>life</span> <span>without</span> <span>that</span> <span>doll</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Through</span> the <span>years</span>, the <span>doll</span> <span>became</span> <span>less</span> <span>important</span> <span>in</span> my <span>life</span>.<br/>
🎧 I had <span>other</span> <span>things</span> to do, but the <span>doll</span> <span>still</span> <span>sat</span> <span>on</span> my bed <span>during</span> the day, and I <span>still</span> <span>took</span> <span>it</span> to bed <span>at</span> <span>night</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>gave</span> <span>that</span> <span>doll</span> a lot <span>of</span> <span>love</span> when I was <span>little</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>In</span> <span>fact</span>, I <span>loved</span> the <span>doll</span> so <span>much</span> <span>that</span> she <span>looks</span> <span>tattered</span> and <span>torn</span> <span>now</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>parts</span> <span>of</span> her <span>face</span> and <span>hands</span> <span>that</span> are <span>almost</span> <span>worn</span> <span>away</span>.<br/>
🎧 I had a lot <span>of</span> <span>other</span> <span>toys</span> when I was <span>little</span>, but <span>none</span> <span>of</span> <span>them</span> <span>were</span> <span>ever</span> so <span>important</span> <span>as</span> <span>that</span> <span>doll</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't <span>play</span> <span>with</span> <span>toys</span> <span>anymore</span>, but <span>that</span> <span>doll</span> <span>is</span> <span>still</span> <span>in</span> my <span>room</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>sits</span> <span>in</span> a <span>special</span> <span>chair</span> <span>in</span> the <span>corner</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>I'll</span> <span>always</span> have <span>that</span> <span>doll</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>No</span> <span>matter</span> how <span>worn</span> out she <span>is</span>, <span>I'll</span> <span>always</span> <span>keep</span> her and <span>cherish</span> her <span>as</span> a <span>part</span> <span>of</span> my <span>early</span> <span>childhood.<br/>
