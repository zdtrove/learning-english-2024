</div>
🎧 <span>Mary's</span> <span>parents</span> just got a <span>divorce</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mary</span> is very <span>upset</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>thinks</span> that her <span>parents</span> don't love her <span>anymore</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>thinks</span> that they got a <span>divorce</span> <span>because</span> of her.<br/>
🎧 She is <span>wrong</span>.<br/>
🎧 Her <span>parents</span> love her just as much as they always <span>did</span>.<br/>
🎧 They aren't getting <span>divorced</span> <span>because</span> of <span>Mary</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span>, <span>marriages</span> just don't work out.<br/>
🎧 It isn't really <span>anyone's</span> <span>fault</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Marriage</span> isn't <span>easy</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is <span>hard</span> for two people to <span>stay</span> <span>together</span> for a <span>lifetime</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span>, people <span>change</span> as they get <span>older</span>, and they move on.<br/>
🎧 Some people have <span>perfectly</span> good <span>marriages</span>, and they <span>stay</span> <span>together</span> for their <span>entire</span> <span>lives</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Divorce</span> doesn't <span>happen</span> <span>because</span> the <span>parents</span> don't love the <span>children</span> <span>anymore</span>.<br/>
🎧 A lot of <span>children</span> feel that it is their <span>fault</span>, but it isn't their <span>fault</span> at all.<br/>
🎧 <span>Children</span> <span>neither</span> <span>cause</span> the <span>divorce</span>, <span>nor</span> can they <span>prevent</span> it.<br/>
🎧 It is up to the <span>parents</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Divorce</span> isn't the end of the <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Children</span> can still see both <span>parents</span> and <span>stay</span> with them.<br/>
🎧 <span>Life</span> <span>goes</span> on.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span> <span>children</span> can get new <span>stepmothers</span> or <span>stepfathers</span>.<br/>
🎧 That can be a good thing.<br/>
🎧 You just have to be <span>understanding</span>, and know that your <span>parents</span> still love you.<br/>
🎧 <span>Life</span> doesn't always go the way that we <span>planned</span> it, but it has its <span>twists</span> and <span>turns</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Life</span> is an <span>adventure</span>.<br/>
🎧 If your <span>parents</span> get a <span>divorce</span>, just be <span>understanding</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Know</span> that they love you and that this is a <span>hard</span> time for them.<br/>
🎧 It is a <span>hard</span> time for you too, but these things have a way of <span>working</span> <span>themselves</span> out in the <span>end.<br/>

</div>
🎧 I have a <span>goldfish</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>swims</span> around in his <span>bowl</span> all day.<br/>
🎧 He looks <span>bored</span>.<br/>
🎧 I look inside the <span>bowl</span> and <span>watch</span> him.<br/>
🎧 His <span>mouth</span> always <span>moves</span>.<br/>
🎧 He looks like he is talking.<br/>
🎧 I <span>imagine</span> what my <span>goldfish</span> would say if he really <span>could</span> talk.<br/>
🎧 I think he would <span>say:<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>"Hey</span>, I'm <span>bored</span> in this little <span>bowl</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why don't you get me a <span>bigger</span> <span>tank</span> with more <span>fish</span> in <span>it?<br/></span> 
🎧 I would like to have some <span>friends</span> to <span>swim</span> around <span>with."<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>went</span> out and <span>bought</span> a <span>bigger</span> <span>tank</span> for my <span>goldfish</span>.<br/>
🎧 I put some <span>plants</span> at the <span>bottom</span> of the <span>tank</span>, and I got a <span>miniature</span> <span>deep-sea</span> <span>diver</span> to put at the <span>bottom</span> of the <span>tank</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>looked</span> into the <span>tank</span> and <span>imagined</span> what my <span>goldfish</span> was saying.<br/>
🎧 He <span>seemed</span> to be <span>saying:<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>"This</span> is a nice <span>tank</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>roomy</span> in here, and you <span>decorated</span> it well, but I still don't have any <span>friends</span> to <span>swim</span> <span>with."<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>went</span> to the pet <span>store</span> and <span>bought</span> <span>three</span> more <span>goldfish</span>.<br/>
🎧 I put them into the <span>tank</span>.<br/>
🎧 All of the <span>goldfish</span> <span>seemed</span> to look at each other.<br/>
🎧 They <span>swam</span> <span>near</span> each other and <span>seemed</span> to be <span>playing</span> <span>games</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>knew</span> which one was my <span>goldfish</span> <span>because</span> he has a <span>black</span> <span>spot</span> on his <span>fin</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>looked</span> at him, and <span>imagined</span> that he was talking again.<br/>
🎧 He <span>said:<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>"This</span> is <span>great!<br/></span> 
🎧 I have a big new home and <span>friends</span> to <span>swim</span> with.<br/>
🎧 <span>These</span> are nice <span>goldfish</span> that you <span>brought</span> home for <span>me;</span> thank <span>you."<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Goldfish</span> can't really talk.<br/>
🎧 I know that.<br/>
🎧 I just like to <span>pretend</span> that my <span>goldfish</span> <span>talks</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>seems</span> very happy now with his nice new home, and his new <span>friends</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't think <span>goldfish</span> can <span>smile</span> <span>either</span>, but it looks like my <span>goldfish</span> has a <span>smile</span> on his <span>face.<br/>

<h2>[033] The Best Teacher</h2>
<div class="audio-wrapper">
  <audio class="audio" controls></audio>
  <button onclick="loadAudio(level2Mp3['2033'], this)">Play</button>
</div>
🎧 I have had a lot of <span>teachers</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some of them were good, and some of them were <span>boring</span>.<br/>
🎧 There is one <span>teacher</span> whom I <span>remember</span> very well. <br/> 
🎧 He is the best <span>teacher</span> that I <span>ever</span> <span>had</span>.<br/>
🎧 His <span>name</span> was <span>Mr</span>. <span>Alban</span>.<br/>
🎧 He was a <span>history</span> <span>teacher</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>History</span> is not my <span>favorite</span> <span>subject</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't really enjoy <span>history</span> a lot.<br/>
🎧 When I was in <span>Mr</span>. <span>Alban's</span> <span>class</span>, he made <span>history</span> <span>seem</span> <span>exciting</span>.<br/>
🎧 He was more of an <span>actor</span> than a <span>teacher</span>.<br/>
🎧 If he was <span>describing</span> a war, he would make us feel all the <span>emotions</span> that the <span>soldiers</span> and their <span>families</span> would have <span>felt</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>could</span> almost hear the <span>guns</span> <span>firing</span> and the people <span>shouting</span>.<br/>
🎧 He would <span>paint</span> a <span>picture</span> in our <span>minds</span> that was very <span>vivid</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I had a <span>history</span> <span>test</span> in his <span>class</span>, I didn't have to <span>study</span> much.<br/>
🎧 I would <span>remember</span> every <span>word</span> that he had said.<br/>
🎧 I would see him doing the <span>actions</span> that <span>went</span> along with his <span>stories</span>.<br/>
🎧 He was very <span>animated</span>.<br/>
🎧 He would <span>shout</span> out <span>orders</span> as if he was a <span>general</span>, or he would <span>speak</span> <span>softly</span> and <span>reverently</span> when <span>describing</span> the <span>death</span> of a great <span>hero</span>.<br/>
🎧 The most <span>important</span> thing that I <span>learned</span> from <span>Mr</span>. <span>Alban</span> was that I did really like <span>history</span>.<br/>
🎧 I just <span>thought</span> that I didn't like it <span>because</span> most people had made it <span>dull</span> by just <span>reading</span> from the <span>textbooks</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>History</span> is not just a <span>series</span> of <span>dates</span> and <span>dull</span> <span>facts</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>History</span> is what really <span>happened</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>History</span> is <span>real</span> life.<br/>
🎧 All the <span>historical</span> <span>figures</span> had <span>real</span> <span>families</span> and <span>emotions</span>.<br/>
🎧 They weren't just <span>fictional</span> people.<br/>
🎧 <span>After</span> I took <span>history</span> from <span>Mr</span>. <span>Alban</span>, I <span>realized</span> that I really did have an <span>interest</span> in it.<br/>
🎧 He was my <span>favorite</span> <span>teacher</span>, and I will always be <span>grateful</span> to him for <span>making</span> me <span>aware</span> of just how <span>interesting</span> <span>history</span> really <span>is.<br/>

</div>
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span>, I <span>watch</span> the <span>weatherman</span> on <span>television</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is <span>fascinating</span> to <span>watch</span> him <span>point</span> to different <span>areas</span> of the <span>country</span> on the <span>map</span>.<br/>
🎧 He tells us where the <span>weather</span> will be nice and where it will be <span>bad</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>weatherman</span> is not always right.<br/>
🎧 <span>Weather</span> <span>reporting</span> is not an <span>exact</span> <span>science</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Nothing</span> is very <span>exact</span> when it <span>comes</span> to the <span>weather</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>weather</span> <span>department</span> <span>does</span> a lot of <span>research</span>, but they can <span>never</span> be sure of <span>exactly</span> what will <span>happen</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span>, it looks like it will be <span>clear</span>, but the <span>wind</span> <span>changes</span> <span>direction</span> and <span>clouds</span> move in.<br/>
🎧 The <span>weatherman</span> can <span>warn</span> people if there is a <span>chance</span> of a <span>hurricane</span> or <span>tornado</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>weatherman</span> can also <span>warn</span> people of <span>floods</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span>, <span>entire</span> <span>towns</span> have to be <span>evacuated</span> <span>because</span> of bad <span>weather</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is <span>important</span> to be <span>aware</span> of the <span>weather</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, it is not good to be <span>caught</span> in the <span>middle</span> of a <span>field</span> when there is going to be a <span>thunderstorm</span>. <br/> 
🎧 You might want to take <span>extra</span> <span>precautions</span> if there is going to be a <span>heavy</span> <span>snowstorm</span>.<br/>
🎧 You would need to be in a <span>secure</span> place if a <span>hurricane</span> or <span>tornado</span> was <span>predicted</span>.<br/>
🎧 You might want to <span>cancel</span> a <span>picnic</span> if you <span>knew</span> that it would <span>rain</span> that day.<br/>
🎧 The <span>weather</span> <span>affects</span> us in so many <span>ways</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some people are really <span>affected</span> by <span>dull</span>, <span>cloudy</span> <span>days</span>.<br/>
🎧 If there are no <span>sunny</span> <span>days</span>, they become very <span>depressed</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Heavy</span> air <span>pressure</span> can <span>cause</span> some people to have <span>headaches</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Weather</span> <span>affects</span> all of us in one way or <span>another</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is always a <span>topic</span> of <span>conversation</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>People</span> <span>often</span> say things like <span>"hello</span>, it's a <span>beautiful</span> day <span>today."<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Often</span> we <span>plan</span> our <span>lives</span> and <span>activities</span> around the <span>weather</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, if you are planning on <span>walking</span> home <span>tonight</span>, keep an eye on the <span>sky</span>.<br/>
🎧 Are <span>those</span> <span>rain</span> <span>clouds</span> up <span>there?<br/></span>

<h2>[035] How to Avoid Catching a Cold</h2>

  <button onclick="loadAudio(level2Mp3['2035'], this)">Play</button>
</div>
🎧 How many <span>colds</span> do you <span>catch</span> in a <span>year?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Most</span> of my <span>friends</span> <span>catch</span> quite a few <span>colds</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>cough</span>, <span>sniffle</span> and <span>sneeze</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>carry</span> around <span>tissues</span> and <span>blow</span> their <span>noses</span> all the time.<br/>
🎧 Their <span>eyes</span> water, and they have <span>scratchy</span> <span>throats</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't get many <span>colds</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, I can go for a <span>whole</span> year and <span>never</span> <span>catch</span> a <span>cold</span>.<br/>
🎧 That is why I <span>consider</span> <span>myself</span> an <span>expert</span> on how not to <span>catch</span> a <span>cold</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll tell you how to <span>avoid</span> <span>catching</span> a <span>cold</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think that you need to take a lot of <span>vitamin</span> <span>C</span>.<br/>
🎧 I eat a lot of <span>fruits</span> and <span>vegetables</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>drink</span> <span>fruit</span> <span>juice</span> <span>too</span>.<br/>
🎧 I also take <span>vitamin</span> <span>C</span> <span>pills</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Whenever</span> I <span>begin</span> to feel a <span>cold</span> <span>coming</span> on, I make sure that I have <span>taken</span> my <span>vitamin</span> <span>C</span> <span>pill</span>, and I <span>drink</span> a lot of <span>orange</span> <span>juice</span>.<br/>
🎧 That usually <span>knocks</span> the <span>cold</span> right out of my <span>system</span>.<br/>
🎧 I make sure that I get a lot of <span>fresh</span> <span>air</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>winter</span>, a lot of <span>buildings</span> are <span>shut</span> up <span>tight</span> so that the air is <span>stale</span>, and <span>people's</span> <span>germs</span> <span>circulate</span> <span>through</span> the <span>buildings</span>.<br/>
🎧 I get <span>outside</span> and <span>breathe</span> in <span>fresh</span> <span>clean</span> <span>air</span>.<br/>
🎧 If <span>somebody</span> is <span>rude</span> enough to <span>cough</span> or <span>sneeze</span> right in <span>front</span> of me without <span>covering</span> his or her <span>mouth</span>, I just <span>hold</span> my <span>breath</span> for a <span>second</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm not sure if this <span>works</span> or not, but I don't want to <span>breathe</span> in <span>anybody's</span> <span>cold</span> <span>germs</span>.<br/>
🎧 many <span>germs</span> are <span>passed</span> <span>through</span> <span>hands</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is <span>important</span> to <span>wash</span> your <span>hands</span> <span>thoroughly</span> if you <span>touch</span> anything in a <span>public</span> place.<br/>
🎧 If I <span>hold</span> a <span>banister</span> <span>while</span> I am <span>walking</span> <span>down</span> the <span>stairs</span>, I think of all the people who have used that <span>banister</span>, and I make sure that I <span>wash</span> my <span>hands</span> before I <span>eat</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Doorknobs</span> also have a lot of <span>germs</span> on them.<br/>
🎧 <span>Money</span> is <span>another</span> thing that is <span>passed</span> from <span>hand</span> to <span>hand</span> and is <span>covered</span> with <span>germs</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span>, I see people <span>stick</span> money into their <span>mouths</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Just</span> think of all the <span>germs</span> that you would be <span>putting</span> into your <span>mouth</span> if you did that.<br/>
🎧 If you just give it a little bit of <span>thought</span>, you can <span>avoid</span> a lot of the <span>germs</span> that <span>cause</span> <span>colds</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you eat good <span>foods</span> and <span>stay</span> fit, your <span>body</span> will be able to <span>fight</span> off the <span>germs</span> that <span>cause</span> <span>colds</span> and other <span>diseases</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is not always <span>possible</span> to <span>avoid</span> <span>colds</span>, but if you do <span>catch</span> a <span>cold</span>, <span>drink</span> <span>plenty</span> of <span>fluids</span> and get a lot of <span>rest.<br/>

🎧 I <span>sometimes</span> <span>wonder</span> what life will be like in the <span>future</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Life</span> has <span>changed</span> so much in just the <span>past</span> few years.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure that there are still big <span>changes</span> that are <span>coming</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you think we'll still drive <span>cars?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Maybe</span> we'll get into <span>computerized</span> <span>vehicles</span> that we won't have to drive.<br/>
🎧 We'll just <span>push</span> a few <span>buttons</span>, and the <span>vehicles</span> will take us to <span>wherever</span> we have to go.<br/>
🎧 <span>Maybe</span> there won't be <span>roads</span>.<br/>
🎧 We might just fly <span>through</span> <span>space</span> to get where we want to go.<br/>
🎧 <span>Instead</span> of <span>telephones</span>, we'll just use our <span>computers</span>.<br/>
🎧 We'll be able to see each other when we talk.<br/>
🎧 That <span>type</span> of thing is <span>already</span> <span>happening</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Maybe</span> we won't have to <span>cook</span> our <span>meals</span>.<br/>
🎧 We might be able to <span>push</span> <span>buttons</span> to <span>order</span> <span>whatever</span> we want.<br/>
🎧 A nice <span>roast</span> <span>beef</span> dinner, or an ice <span>cream</span> <span>sundae</span>, might just pop out of a <span>machine</span>.<br/>
🎧 It would be nice to have a <span>robot</span> to <span>clean</span> the house for you.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>past</span> few years, <span>computers</span> have been <span>extremely</span> <span>important</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>People</span> used to <span>write</span> to each other <span>through</span> the <span>mail</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, people <span>communicate</span> so much more <span>frequently</span> <span>through</span> <span>E-mail</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Most</span> of my <span>friends</span> own <span>computers</span>.<br/>
🎧 If we had all of these things to do the work for us, what would we <span>do?<br/></span> 
🎧 We would still need people to <span>program</span> the <span>computers</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>could</span> <span>spend</span> more time being <span>creative</span>, <span>rather</span> than doing <span>everyday</span> <span>chores</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>future</span> <span>holds</span> many <span>surprises</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure that <span>technology</span> will become even more and more <span>amazing</span>.<br/>
🎧 When my <span>parents</span> were <span>young</span>, they had <span>never</span> even <span>seen</span> a <span>color</span> <span>television</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Nobody</span> <span>owned</span> a <span>computer</span>.<br/>
🎧 It doesn't take long for things to <span>change</span> a lot.<br/>

  <button onclick="loadAudio(level2Mp3['2037'], this)">Play</button>
</div>
🎧 I had to give a <span>speech</span> last week.<br/>
🎧 I gave a <span>speech</span> to <span>three</span> <span>hundred</span> people.<br/>
🎧 I had to <span>speak</span> in <span>front</span> of a <span>group</span> of <span>students</span>.<br/>
🎧 I had to tell them about a <span>campaign</span> that we were <span>having</span> to <span>raise</span> money for <span>cancer</span> <span>research</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Giving</span> a <span>speech</span> can be a <span>difficult</span> thing. <br/> 
🎧 When you <span>stand</span> in <span>front</span> of a big <span>crowd</span>, you can get very <span>nervous</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some people feel like they have <span>weak</span> <span>knees</span>.<br/>
🎧 Their <span>legs</span> feel as if they are made of <span>rubber</span>.<br/>
🎧 Their <span>heart</span> <span>beats</span> very <span>hard</span> inside of their <span>chest</span>.<br/>
🎧 Their <span>palms</span> get <span>sweaty</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some people even become <span>short</span> of <span>breath</span>.<br/>
🎧 For some people, <span>giving</span> a <span>speech</span> is their <span>worst</span> <span>fear</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you give a <span>speech</span>, <span>everyone</span> is <span>looking</span> at you.<br/>
🎧 They are <span>waiting</span> to hear what you have to say.<br/>
🎧 When you have <span>three</span> <span>hundred</span> people <span>looking</span> at <span>you;</span> you have six <span>hundred</span> <span>eyes</span> that are on you.<br/>
🎧 It is a little <span>frightening</span> when you think of it that <span>way</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Before</span> I give a <span>speech</span>, I take <span>three</span> big <span>breaths</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>calm</span> <span>myself</span>, and I <span>remind</span> <span>myself</span> that what I have to say is <span>important</span>.<br/>
🎧 I like to be sure of what I am going to say, so I <span>practice</span> my <span>speech</span> in <span>front</span> of a <span>mirror</span> at home.<br/>
🎧 I like to look like I am <span>relaxed</span> and <span>friendly</span>.<br/>
🎧 They say that <span>practice</span> <span>makes</span> <span>perfect;</span> so the more <span>speeches</span> that you give, the better you will become at it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Whenever</span> I have to give a <span>speech</span>, I <span>imagine</span> that the <span>audience</span> is just one big person.<br/>
🎧 I look out into the <span>audience</span> <span>until</span> I find a <span>friendly</span>, <span>smiling</span> <span>face</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>focus</span> on that person, and I <span>pretend</span> that I am just talking to them.<br/>
🎧 I have become used to <span>giving</span> <span>speeches</span>.<br/>
🎧 I am more <span>relaxed</span> now than I used to be.<br/>
🎧 <span>People</span> tell me that I do not look <span>nervous</span> at all.<br/>
🎧 I like to hear that.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span> I do feel a little <span>flutter</span> of <span>nervousness</span>, but I just <span>ignore</span> it and do the best that I can.<br/>
🎧 <span>Giving</span> a <span>speech</span> is not as <span>scary</span> as it <span>appears</span> to be.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyone</span> can do it with a little <span>practice.<br/>

</div>
🎧 My <span>friend</span> <span>Steve</span> <span>moved</span> to <span>another</span> <span>country</span>.<br/>
🎧 He had <span>lived</span> in <span>Canada</span> all his life, and he <span>moved</span> to <span>Japan</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Life</span> in <span>Japan</span> was very different for <span>Steve</span> than what he was used to.<br/>
🎧 <span>At</span> <span>first</span>, <span>Steve</span> <span>suffered</span> from <span>culture</span> <span>shock</span>.<br/>
🎧 His <span>whole</span> life <span>seemed</span> different.<br/>
🎧 He was not used to the way of life in <span>Japan</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Steve</span> was not used to the <span>large</span> <span>crowds</span> of people that <span>walked</span> up and <span>down</span> the <span>streets</span> in <span>Japan</span>.<br/>
🎧 In his <span>hometown</span> in <span>Canada</span>, the <span>streets</span> were <span>fairly</span> <span>quiet</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Steve</span> had to get used to the food.<br/>
🎧 In <span>Japan</span>, the people eat a lot of <span>fish</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Steve</span> had <span>never</span> <span>eaten</span> much <span>fish</span> before.<br/>
🎧 <span>Steve</span> <span>wanted</span> <span>pizza</span>, but it was <span>expensive</span> in <span>Japan</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Steve</span> said that he had to <span>adjust</span> his <span>eating</span> <span>habits</span>.<br/>
🎧 The people in <span>Japan</span> have different <span>customs</span> than we do here in <span>Canada</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Steve</span> didn't want to <span>offend</span> <span>anyone</span>, so he had to learn the <span>customs</span>.<br/>
🎧 He had to learn about what <span>Japanese</span> people <span>considered</span> <span>polite</span> and <span>rude</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span>, in a <span>foreign</span> <span>country</span> you can do something to <span>insult</span> <span>someone</span> without even <span>realizing</span> that you are being <span>rude</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>At</span> <span>first</span>, <span>Steve</span> had <span>trouble</span> with the <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 He said that the only way to really learn the <span>language</span> is to talk to people.<br/>
🎧 <span>Steve</span> <span>talked</span> to a lot of people.<br/>
🎧 He made a lot of <span>mistakes</span>, but people were <span>patient</span> with him, and they <span>tried</span> to help him with his <span>Japanese</span>.<br/>
🎧 It wasn't long before <span>Steve</span> <span>felt</span> more <span>comfortable</span> in his new <span>surroundings</span>.<br/>
🎧 You have to be <span>willing</span> to learn new <span>customs</span> and a new <span>language</span> if you move to <span>another</span> <span>country</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Steve</span> <span>feels</span> very <span>comfortable</span> in <span>Japan</span>, and in <span>Canada</span> <span>now</span>.<br/>
🎧 He is thinking about going to <span>another</span> <span>country</span> <span>now</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>thinks</span> that he might like to try and live in <span>Italy</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure that he would get over his <span>culture</span> <span>shock</span> very <span>fast</span> if he <span>moved</span> there.<br/>
🎧 <span>Moving</span> to a new <span>country</span> can be <span>difficult</span>, but if you are <span>willing</span> to learn, it can be a very <span>rewarding</span> <span>experience.<br/>

</div>
🎧 I have <span>learned</span> that things don't always go the way that they were <span>planned</span>.<br/>
🎧 If something doesn't <span>happen</span> the way that I want it to, I try to make the best of the <span>situation</span>.<br/>
🎧 I always try to find something good in <span>everything</span> that <span>happens</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Last</span> year, I <span>broke</span> my <span>ankle</span> when I was <span>walking</span> on an icy <span>sidewalk</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>At</span> <span>first</span>, I was very <span>upset</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>missing</span> school, and there was a <span>party</span> that I <span>wanted</span> to go to.<br/>
🎧 I couldn't do very much of anything.<br/>
🎧 My <span>ankle</span> was very <span>sore</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>stayed</span> home, and I read a book.<br/>
🎧 It was an <span>excellent</span> book, and one that I probably would not have had time to read under <span>normal</span> <span>circumstances</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>friends</span> <span>brought</span> my <span>homework</span> to my house, and we had some really nice <span>visits</span> <span>while</span> they were here.<br/>
🎧 I had to <span>accept</span> the <span>fact</span> that I couldn't go <span>anywhere</span> on my <span>broken</span> <span>ankle</span>, so I made the best of a bad <span>situation</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Once</span>, I <span>lost</span> my way when I was out <span>camping</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>ended</span> up in a very <span>large</span> <span>field</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>afraid</span> that <span>nobody</span> would find me, but I <span>calmed</span> <span>myself</span> <span>down</span> and took time to <span>examine</span> all the <span>interesting</span> <span>wildflowers</span> in the <span>field</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>family</span> did find me.<br/>
🎧 They were <span>surprised</span> at how <span>calm</span> I <span>was</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have <span>learned</span> that there is something <span>valuable</span> inside every <span>adventure</span> and something <span>beautiful</span> inside every person. <br/> 
🎧 We had a new boy who came into our <span>class</span>.<br/>
🎧 His <span>clothes</span> weren't in <span>style</span>, and he was not <span>particularly</span> <span>handsome</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some of the <span>boys</span> and <span>girls</span> made fun of him.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sometimes</span>, people can be really <span>cruel</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>seemed</span> to <span>handle</span> it all right, but inside, I <span>knew</span> that it <span>must</span> <span>hurt</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some of my <span>friends</span> and I <span>invited</span> him out with us.<br/>
🎧 We <span>found</span> out that he had a <span>terrific</span> <span>sense</span> of <span>humor</span>, and he is probably one of the <span>nicest</span> people that I have <span>ever</span> <span>met</span>.<br/>
🎧 He has <span>since</span> become one of my best <span>friends</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>makes</span> me <span>ashamed</span> when <span>someone</span> that I know <span>judges</span> <span>someone</span> by how they look.<br/>
🎧 It isn't <span>fair</span> to do that.<br/>
🎧 You'll find that something good <span>comes</span> out of almost every <span>situation</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll find something good about almost <span>everyone</span> that you <span>meet</span> if you look <span>hard</span> enough.<br/>
🎧 If something doesn't work out the way you <span>planned</span> it, just make the best of the <span>situation</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Look</span> for the <span>beauty</span> in <span>everything.<br/>

🎧 When I was an <span>infant</span>, I got a rag <span>doll</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was a very <span>plain</span>, little <span>doll</span>, and it <span>wore</span> a <span>clown</span> <span>outfit</span> and a <span>clown's</span> <span>hat</span>.<br/>
🎧 I used to take that <span>doll</span> to bed with me every <span>night</span>.<br/>
🎧 I couldn't go to bed without my <span>doll</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mother</span> used to <span>pretend</span> that the <span>doll</span> was talking to me.<br/>
🎧 She would make the <span>doll</span> <span>dance</span> and <span>sing</span> <span>songs</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would talk to the <span>doll</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mother</span> would <span>answer</span> for the <span>doll</span>, but I was a <span>baby</span>, and I <span>thought</span> that the <span>doll</span> was <span>actually</span> talking to me.<br/>
🎧 That <span>doll</span> was my best <span>friend</span>.<br/>
🎧 I took her <span>everywhere</span>.<br/>
🎧 One time I took her to a <span>store</span> with me, and I <span>left</span> her on a <span>shelf</span> in the <span>store</span>.<br/>
🎧 We were <span>halfway</span> home when I <span>realized</span> that I didn't have my <span>doll</span> with me.<br/>
🎧 I was very <span>upset</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mother</span> and I <span>rushed</span> back to the <span>store</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>doll</span> was still there.<br/>
🎧 I was so <span>relieved</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>hugged</span> my <span>doll</span>, and I <span>promised</span> <span>myself</span> that I would <span>never</span> <span>leave</span> her <span>anywhere</span> again.<br/>
🎧 I couldn't <span>imagine</span> life without that <span>doll</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Through</span> the years, the <span>doll</span> <span>became</span> <span>less</span> <span>important</span> in my life.<br/>
🎧 I had other things to do, but the <span>doll</span> still <span>sat</span> on my bed during the day, and I still took it to bed at <span>night</span>.<br/>
🎧 I gave that <span>doll</span> a lot of love when I was little.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, I loved the <span>doll</span> so much that she looks <span>tattered</span> and <span>torn</span> <span>now</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>parts</span> of her <span>face</span> and <span>hands</span> that are almost <span>worn</span> away.<br/>
🎧 I had a lot of other <span>toys</span> when I was little, but <span>none</span> of them were <span>ever</span> so <span>important</span> as that <span>doll</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't play with <span>toys</span> <span>anymore</span>, but that <span>doll</span> is still in my <span>room</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>sits</span> in a special <span>chair</span> in the <span>corner</span>. <br/> 
🎧 I'll always have that <span>doll</span>.<br/>
🎧 No <span>matter</span> how <span>worn</span> out she is, I'll always keep her and <span>cherish</span> her as a <span>part</span> of my <span>early</span> <span>childhood.<br/>
