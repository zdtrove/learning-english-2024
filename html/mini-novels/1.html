🎧 At <span>precisely</span> <span>6</span> <span>a.m.</span>, the sound of the <span>alarm</span> <span>clock</span> <span>pierces</span> the air. <span><br /></span>
🎧 <span>Sandy</span> <span>drags</span> <span>herself</span> out of bed and <span>begins</span> her morning <span>routine</span> with a <span>quick</span> <span>shower</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 After her <span>shower</span>, she <span>prepares</span> a simple <span>breakfast</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Grabbing</span> a <span>clean</span> <span>bowl</span> from the <span>dishwasher</span>, she <span>empties</span> into it a <span>packet</span> of <span>instant</span> <span>oatmeal</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 She <span>pours</span> in a cup of <span>milk</span>, <span>stirs</span> and <span>heats</span> the <span>mixture</span> in the <span>microwave</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 While <span>waiting</span> for her <span>oatmeal</span> to <span>cook</span>, she <span>dresses</span> for the day, <span>mindful</span> of the <span>weather</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Fully</span> <span>dressed</span> now, she <span>removes</span> her <span>oatmeal</span> from the <span>microwave</span>, which has now <span>cooled</span> just enough to <span>suit</span> her <span>taste</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 It is her <span>favorite</span> <span>flavor</span>, <span>apple</span> <span>cinnamon</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 As she <span>savors</span> each <span>bite</span>, she is <span>reminded</span> of her <span>mother</span>, who always made sure <span>Sandy</span> <span>ate</span> a <span>warm</span> <span>breakfast</span> before <span>leaving</span> the house in the morning.<br/>
🎧 <span>Checking</span> the time on her phone, she <span>hurriedly</span> <span>swallows</span> the last few <span>mouthful</span> of <span>oatmeal</span> before <span>heading</span> out. <span><br/></span>
🎧 As she <span>steps</span> into the <span>street</span>, a <span>gust</span> of <span>wind</span> <span>blows</span> back her <span>hair</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 She <span>covers</span> her <span>head</span> with the <span>hood</span> of her <span>coat</span>, <span>tightens</span> the <span>scarf</span> around her <span>neck</span>, and <span>braces</span> for her <span>walk</span> to the <span>train</span> <span>station</span>.<br/>
🎧 After <span>settling</span> into her <span>seat</span> on the <span>train</span>, <span>memories</span> of her <span>mother</span> <span>stir</span> again. <span><br/></span>
🎧 She takes out her phone and <span>texts</span>: Hey mom, thanks for the <span>scarf</span> you <span>knit</span> me. It came in <span>real</span> <span>handy</span> this morning. Love always.<br/>

🎧 <span>Pulling</span> into the <span>parking</span> lot of the <span>largest</span> <span>supermarket</span> in <span>town</span>, <span>Joe</span> could already see it was going to be a <span>challenge</span> to find <span>parking</span> on this <span>Saturday</span> morning. <span><br/></span>
🎧 He <span>decides</span> to first <span>drop</span> off his <span>wife</span> <span>Melissa</span>, so she could get a <span>head</span> start on the <span>shopping</span> they need to do. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Meanwhile</span>, he <span>battles</span> to find a free <span>spot</span> <span>amongst</span> the <span>crowd</span> of other <span>waiting</span> <span>cars</span>.<br/>
🎧 Inside, <span>Joe</span> finally <span>finds</span> <span>Melissa</span>, whose <span>cart</span> already <span>loaded</span> with <span>packages</span> of <span>organic</span> <span>snacks</span> and <span>drinks</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 He <span>knows</span> <span>Melissa</span> is <span>easily</span> <span>tempted</span> by <span>fancy</span> <span>words</span> that <span>promise</span> <span>health</span> <span>benefits</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 It makes her feel good to know that she is <span>making</span> <span>healthy</span> <span>decisions</span>. In the <span>past</span>, <span>Joe</span> would try to <span>reason</span> with her, <span>explaining</span> that <span>health</span> is not about <span>consuming</span> <span>specific</span> <span>items</span>, and more about <span>general</span> <span>lifestyle</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Today, he <span>decides</span> to <span>simply</span> move on. As the <span>chef</span> in the <span>family</span>, <span>Joe</span> looks forward every week to the <span>process</span> of <span>selecting</span> <span>meats</span> and <span>vegetables</span>, <span>imagining</span> all the <span>ways</span> he can <span>flavor</span> and <span>cook</span> them. Free <span>samples</span> are being <span>offered</span> at the <span>familiar</span> <span>locations</span> <span>â€“</span> <span>Melissa</span> makes sure to hit up every <span>station</span>. They agree the <span>chicken</span> <span>sausage</span> is their <span>favorite</span> and buy two <span>packs</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 The <span>buy-one-get-one-free</span> <span>fresh</span> <span>pasta</span> <span>attracts</span> <span>Joe</span>, while the <span>sale</span> on <span>cheesecake</span> <span>draws</span> <span>Melissa</span>.<br/>
🎧 As they wait in <span>line</span> to check out, <span>Melissa</span> <span>examines</span> their <span>overflowing</span> <span>shopping</span> <span>cart</span> and <span>realizes</span> that they are over <span>budget</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 She <span>puts</span> back the <span>snacks</span> and <span>drinks</span> that were <span>clearly</span> <span>impulse</span> <span>buys</span>, and <span>happily</span> <span>claims</span> she is <span>learning</span> to be a great <span>shopper</span>! <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Joe</span> can only <span>smile</span> at the <span>expression</span> on her <span>face</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Five</span> <span>months</span> ago when they first got <span>married</span>, he never <span>imagined</span> he would enjoy these <span>Saturday</span> morning <span>grocery</span> <span>trips</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Now, he <span>finds</span> in them a <span>peaceful</span> <span>satisfaction</span>, a <span>welcome</span> change from his work all week.<br/>

🎧 All week, <span>Frank</span> and <span>Bob</span> have been looking forward to <span>Sunday</span> <span>afternoon</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 That is when their <span>favorite</span> <span>football</span> <span>team</span>, the <span>Philadelphia</span> <span>Eagles</span>, <span>plays</span> their first game of the <span>season</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 The <span>Eagles</span> have a new <span>coach</span>, and many new, young, and <span>talented</span> <span>players</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Football</span> can be a very <span>unpredictable</span> game, with <span>weather</span>, <span>injuries</span>, <span>referees</span>, and <span>luck</span> all <span>affecting</span> the <span>outcome</span> of the game. <span><br/></span>
🎧 On top of that, new <span>players</span> and <span>coaches</span> may need some time to learn to work as a <span>team</span>.<br/>
🎧 For almost a <span>decade</span> now, <span>Frank</span> and <span>Bob</span> have <span>watched</span> <span>Eagles</span> <span>games</span> together. <span><br/></span>
🎧 They <span>met</span> through work, but their <span>friendship</span> <span>continues</span> even though <span>Frank</span> <span>left</span> the company a few years back. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Their <span>wives</span> have become <span>close</span> and sometimes even join them for the <span>games</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 When their <span>sons</span> were still young, they used to be just as <span>excited</span> about these <span>Sunday</span> <span>afternoons</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Now in high school, they'd rather <span>hang</span> out with their friends than their <span>fathers</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Nonetheless</span>, <span>Frank</span> and <span>Bob</span> have <span>kept</span> up their <span>friendship</span> and this <span>tradition</span>, and couldn't think of a better way to <span>spend</span> <span>Sunday</span> <span>afternoons</span>.<br/>
🎧 This week, they will be watching the game at <span>Bob's</span> house, who is <span>anxious</span> to show off the new sound <span>system</span> he <span>installed</span> in his <span>basement</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 As <span>Frank</span> <span>walks</span> up the <span>driveway</span>, <span>carrying</span> a <span>pack</span> of their <span>favorite</span> <span>beer</span>, <span>Bob</span> <span>walks</span> out to meet him, already <span>dressed</span> in <span>Eagle's</span> <span>uniform</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 After some <span>playful</span> <span>punching</span>, they come together for a <span>quick</span> <span>embrace</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Once inside, they are <span>greeted</span> by the <span>familiar</span> sounds of the <span>pre-game</span> show. <span><br/></span>
🎧 It's going to be a great <span>season</span>!<br/>

🎧 <span>Julie</span> was <span>sitting</span> in bed <span>late</span> at <span>night</span> playing with her <span>brand-new</span> <span>smartphone</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Earlier</span> that week, she had been <span>visited</span> by her children and <span>grandchildren</span> to <span>celebrate</span> her <span>70th</span> <span>birthday</span>, and had <span>received</span> the phone as a <span>gift</span> from her <span>granddaughter</span> <span>Mary</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Julie</span> had been <span>widowed</span> for <span>five</span> years now. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Since she <span>lived</span> hours away from the <span>rest</span> of the <span>family</span>, <span>Mary</span> thought the phone would be a good way for them to keep in touch and take up some of her time.<br/>
🎧 Up until then, <span>Julie</span> had never really been interested in <span>catching</span> up with <span>modern</span> <span>technology</span>, but finally <span>owning</span> her own <span>smartphone</span> made her feel <span>youthful</span>, and she <span>decided</span> to join <span>Facebook</span> since that was what she had <span>noticed</span> all the <span>younger</span> people were doing. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>However</span>, when <span>making</span> her <span>profile</span> <span>page</span>, she was <span>embarrassed</span> to put up a <span>picture</span> of <span>herself</span> since she thought she <span>looked</span> much too <span>wrinkly</span> and <span>nobody</span> would want to talk to her. <span><br/></span>
🎧 To <span>remedy</span> this, she <span>downloaded</span> a <span>picture</span> of a <span>beautiful</span> <span>20-something</span> year old from <span>Google</span>, <span>posted</span> it under her name, and went to <span>sleep</span>.<br/>
🎧 The next morning, <span>Julie</span> <span>woke</span> up and <span>enthusiastically</span> <span>logged</span> into <span>Facebook</span> in <span>hopes</span> that she would have one or two new friends. <span><br/></span>
🎧 She could not <span>believe</span> her <span>eyes</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Her <span>inbox</span> was full of friend <span>requests</span> from <span>dozens</span> and <span>dozens</span> of young <span>handsome</span> men that were <span>complimenting</span> her <span>beauty</span> and wanted to know all about her.<br/>
🎧 <span>Julie</span> <span>decided</span> to <span>accept</span> only the <span>best-looking</span> <span>ones</span> and <span>began</span> <span>chatting</span> with them day and <span>night</span>, never <span>letting</span> them know that they were actually talking to a <span>grandma</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 The next time <span>Julie</span> <span>met</span> up with <span>Mary</span>, she <span>thanked</span> her so much for the phone and <span>remarked</span>, I haven't <span>felt</span> so young and <span>pretty</span> in years! <span>Mary</span> was <span>confused</span> and <span>asked</span>, Why? <span>Julie</span> just gave a <span>mischievous</span> <span>smile</span> and <span>changed</span> the <span>topic</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>Jennifer</span> loved going out to <span>bowl</span> every <span>Tuesday</span> <span>night</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 She always <span>liked</span> <span>bowling</span>, but had never <span>joined</span> a <span>bowling</span> <span>league</span> until her friend <span>Paul</span> told her about a new <span>league</span> one day. <span><br/></span>
🎧 The two friends <span>enjoyed</span> going to <span>Lucky</span> <span>Lanes</span> on <span>weekends</span>, but had to wait for the <span>league</span> <span>games</span> to <span>finish</span> before they could <span>bowl</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 It did not <span>bother</span> them since they <span>knew</span> what time the <span>league</span> <span>games</span> were over. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Paul</span> <span>talked</span> to the <span>manager</span> of <span>Lucky</span> <span>Lanes</span> one day and <span>discovered</span> that a new <span>league</span> was <span>forming</span> soon. <span><br/></span>
🎧 That's great, said <span>Paul</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 I'm going to ask <span>Jennifer</span> if she <span>wants</span> to join, too, <span>added</span> <span>Paul</span>.<br/>
🎧 When <span>Jennifer</span> heard the <span>news</span>, she wasn't as <span>excited</span> as <span>Paul</span> thought she would be. <span><br/></span>
🎧 What's wrong, <span>Jen</span>? <span>asked</span> <span>Paul</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 I just don't know if I'm good enough to play in a <span>league</span>, <span>answered</span> <span>Jennifer</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Don't you have to be a good <span>bowler</span> to <span>bowl</span> in a <span>league</span>? <span>Paul</span> thought about it for a while before going back to the <span>manager</span> to ask if the new <span>league</span> was for good <span>bowlers</span>, or <span>anyone</span> could join.<br/>
🎧 The <span>manager</span> told him that this new <span>league</span> was for <span>beginners</span>, and <span>added</span> that <span>Paul</span> and <span>Jennifer</span> would be some of the best <span>players</span> in the new <span>league</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Paul</span> was very <span>excited</span> once again. <span><br/></span>
🎧 When he told <span>Jennifer</span> what the <span>manager</span> had said, <span>Jennifer's</span> <span>response</span> was, Where do I <span>sign</span> up? This made <span>Paul</span> very happy.<br/>
🎧 Before long, the two friends were <span>bowling</span> away in their new <span>team</span> and <span>league</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 The <span>manager</span> was right. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Paul</span> and <span>Jennifer</span> were <span>among</span> the best <span>players</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 They both loved <span>bowling</span> in a <span>league</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 They got to <span>wear</span> <span>team</span> <span>bowling</span> <span>shirts</span> and <span>hats</span>, and all the <span>refreshments</span> were <span>included</span> in the <span>league</span> <span>fees</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Soon they were <span>knocking</span> down <span>pins</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 At the end of the <span>season</span>, their <span>team</span> <span>won</span> the <span>trophy</span> for <span>coming</span> in the first place!<br/>

🎧 When <span>William</span> <span>worked</span> in <span>Santa</span> <span>Fe</span> <span>Springs</span>, <span>California</span>, back in the <span>90s</span>, he told me he thought the <span>building</span> he <span>worked</span> at was <span>haunted</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 It really is, said <span>William</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 I have had more than a few <span>incidents</span> <span>happen</span> to me while I was working <span>alone</span>, <span>late</span> at <span>night</span>, he <span>continued</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>William</span> was working as a <span>manager</span> for a very <span>busy</span> <span>chemical</span> <span>distribution</span> company at the time. <span><br/></span>
🎧 In order to keep up with his work, he sometimes had to work at <span>night</span>, or go in on <span>weekends</span> to catch up with his <span>paperwork</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>William</span> was a <span>sensible</span> man. <span><br/></span>
🎧 He was not the <span>type</span> of person that would fly off the <span>handle</span> in <span>troubling</span> <span>situations</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 He was always very <span>calm</span>, and <span>composed</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 This is what made his <span>story</span> <span>believable</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 I <span>knew</span> he wasn't the <span>type</span> to make things up.<br/>
🎧 One <span>night</span>, <span>William</span> went to work after <span>dark</span> and thought <span>nothing</span> of it. <span><br/></span>
🎧 His <span>former</span> <span>manager</span> had told him that he might hear some <span>weird</span> <span>noises</span> <span>coming</span> from the <span>warehouse</span>, but it was only the <span>55-gallon</span> <span>drums</span> <span>expanding</span> and <span>contracting</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 During the <span>heat</span> of the day, the <span>drums</span> would <span>expand</span>, and at <span>night</span>, when it <span>cooled</span> off, the <span>drums</span> would <span>contract</span>, sometimes <span>making</span> a sound. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>William</span> was not <span>worried</span>.<br/>
🎧 That <span>night</span> he was <span>sitting</span> at his <span>desk</span> when he heard what <span>sounded</span> like <span>someone</span> <span>knocking</span> on the <span>door</span> <span>leading</span> to the <span>warehouse</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>William</span> <span>dismissed</span> it as a <span>drum</span> <span>popping</span>, and <span>ignored</span> it. <span><br/></span>
🎧 A few <span>moments</span> later, the sound was back, and this time it was <span>louder</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Since there was no one else in the <span>building</span>, he <span>became</span> a bit <span>nervous</span>, but <span>continued</span> working. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Soon the <span>noises</span> got <span>louder</span> and <span>louder</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 The <span>final</span> <span>straw</span> was when he heard <span>someone</span> <span>walking</span> <span>above</span> the <span>ceiling</span> of his <span>office</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 This <span>scared</span> him quite a bit, but again he <span>ignored</span> it. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Finally, it <span>happened</span> again, and this time <span>William</span> ran into the <span>warehouse</span> to look <span>above</span> his <span>office</span>, but no one was there. <span><br/></span>
🎧 After that, <span>William</span> never <span>worked</span> at <span>night</span> again.<br/>

🎧 <span>Jerry</span> was <span>seventeen</span> when his <span>family</span> <span>decided</span> to move out their <span>apartment</span> in the <span>city</span> of <span>Riverdale</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 They had <span>lived</span> there for <span>nearly</span> ten years. In those ten years, <span>Jerry</span> had made <span>dozens</span> of friends from around the <span>city</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 He didn't <span>understand</span> why they had to move. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Jerry</span> <span>wished</span> he could <span>stay</span> behind while his <span>family</span> <span>left</span> to <span>Arizona</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 He <span>knew</span> things weren't ever going to be the same if he <span>left</span> <span>Riverdale</span>, <span>California</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why do we have to move? <span>Jerry</span> would ask, <span>sounding</span> <span>depressed</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 His <span>parents</span> had <span>answered</span> that <span>question</span> <span>countless</span> <span>times</span> already. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Despite</span> <span>knowing</span> the answer, <span>Jerry</span> was <span>reluctant</span> to <span>believe</span> it, so he <span>kept</span> <span>asking</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Why do we have to move? <span>Jerry</span> <span>asked</span> time after time. <span><br/></span>
🎧 The simple <span>truth</span> was that <span>Jerry</span> and his <span>family</span> just could not <span>afford</span> to live in <span>Riverdale</span> any <span>longer</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 It was <span>hard</span> for <span>Jerry</span> to <span>accept</span> that <span>truth</span>.<br/>
🎧 On the day before the move, <span>Jerry</span> <span>walked</span> around the <span>familiar</span> <span>places</span> in <span>Riverdale</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 He <span>walked</span> <span>passing</span> the <span>oak</span> <span>tree</span> where he first <span>kissed</span> a girl. <span><br/></span>
🎧 He <span>walked</span> <span>past</span> the <span>corner</span> <span>mini-market</span> where he would <span>bring</span> back <span>milk</span> every <span>Sunday</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 He <span>passed</span> by his high school where he had <span>learned</span> and <span>discovered</span> his love of <span>math</span> and <span>science</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Jerry</span> <span>knocked</span> on the <span>doors</span> of <span>friends'</span> <span>houses</span> to say one <span>final</span> <span>goodbye</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Good bye, <span>Tom</span>, <span>Jerry</span> told his best friend. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Goodbye</span> <span>Jane</span>, <span>Jerry</span> told his <span>girlfriend</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 The <span>night</span> <span>fell</span> when <span>Jerry</span> finally <span>finished</span> <span>bidding</span> his <span>farewells</span> to <span>everybody</span> he <span>knew</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Goodbye</span>, <span>Riverdale</span>, <span>Jerry</span> said, looking out his <span>bedroom</span> <span>window</span> as he went to <span>sleep</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 That <span>night</span>, <span>Jerry</span> <span>dreamed</span> of <span>moving</span> to <span>Arizona</span> and <span>making</span> friends on the first day there. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Everything in <span>Arizona</span> <span>seemed</span> great in his <span>dream</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>Joel</span> had been working at a <span>bookstore</span> for <span>four</span> <span>months</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Although <span>four</span> <span>months</span> might <span>seem</span> like a long time, <span>Joel</span> <span>felt</span> like it had been only one month since he was <span>hired</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Working at a <span>bookstore</span> was a <span>dream</span> <span>job</span> for <span>Joel</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 He couldn't <span>believe</span> he got <span>hired</span> on the day of his <span>interview</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Joel</span> <span>felt</span> <span>grateful</span> to be working at where he was. <span><br/></span>
🎧 He loved to <span>brag</span> all about his <span>job</span> to his friends and <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Joel</span> loved <span>reading</span> books on his <span>spare</span> time. <span><br/></span>
🎧 His <span>favorite</span> <span>author</span> was <span>Mark</span> <span>Twain</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Joel's</span> most <span>beloved</span> book of his was The <span>Adventures</span> of <span>Huckleberry</span> <span>Finn</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Working at a <span>bookstore</span> not only gave <span>Joel</span> <span>access</span> to books, but <span>allowed</span> him to <span>interact</span> with other <span>fellow</span> book <span>worms</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 Every now and then, he would come across a <span>classic</span> book and take it for <span>himself</span> to read. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Joel's</span> <span>manager</span> <span>allowed</span> him one book for free once a week. <span><br/></span>
🎧 It was <span>difficult</span> to decide which book to take sometimes.<br/>
🎧 <span>Joel</span> was getting <span>paid</span> <span>three</span> <span>hundred</span> <span>dollars</span> every two <span>weeks</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Sometimes he would <span>surpass</span> this amount when he <span>worked</span> <span>overtime</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 After a <span>couple</span> of <span>months</span>, <span>Joel</span> had <span>saved</span> up enough money to finally <span>purchase</span> his first car. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Buying</span> a car was the <span>main</span> <span>reason</span> <span>Joel</span> wanted to start working. <span><br/></span>
🎧 He <span>began</span> <span>shopping</span> online for used <span>vehicles</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Joel</span> already <span>knew</span> what kind of car he wanted. <span><br/></span>
🎧 He had first <span>seen</span> a <span>picture</span> of it in a <span>magazine</span>, and since then, had <span>dreamed</span> of <span>owning</span> one of his very own. <span><br/></span>
🎧 His <span>dream</span> car was <span>1984</span> <span>BMW</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Joel</span> wanted a <span>black</span> one with two <span>doors</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 He would <span>search</span> on the <span>Internet</span> until he finally <span>found</span> it. <span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>Learning</span> to drive <span>seemed</span> <span>scary</span> for <span>Joel</span> at first. <span><br/></span>
🎧 He had <span>recently</span> <span>purchased</span> his first car, which was now <span>sitting</span> on his <span>driveway</span>, looking <span>clean</span> and <span>shiny</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 The <span>previous</span> <span>owner</span> had <span>maintained</span> it for years and had <span>spent</span> a lot of money <span>restoring</span> it to its <span>original</span> <span>condition</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 The car was a <span>BMW</span>, made in the year <span>1984</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 It was <span>black</span> and had only two <span>doors</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 The <span>interior</span> was also <span>black</span> and had <span>leather</span> <span>seating</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 The <span>vehicle</span> <span>looked</span> <span>practically</span> new to <span>Joel</span>, <span>despite</span> it being <span>older</span> than the new <span>owner</span> of it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Joel</span> was <span>eager</span> to start driving his new car. <span><br/></span>
🎧 At <span>21</span>, <span>Joel</span> had <span>felt</span> the need to be driving already. <span><br/></span>
🎧 He was <span>attending</span> <span>college</span> in the <span>city</span> of <span>Los</span> <span>Angeles</span>, working at a <span>bookstore</span> in the <span>city</span> of <span>Montebello</span>, and living in the <span>city</span> of <span>Bell</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Having a car would make <span>traveling</span> much more <span>convenient</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Joel</span> had been getting around by <span>means</span> of <span>public</span> <span>transportation</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 He was ready to <span>stop</span> taking the bus to school and work.<br/>
🎧 The first thing <span>Joel</span> had to do was to go to <span>DMV</span> to <span>register</span> the car under his name. <span><br/></span>
🎧 After that, he took a driving <span>manual</span> book from <span>DMV</span> to <span>study</span> for the <span>written</span> <span>test</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Passing</span> the <span>written</span> <span>test</span> was the only way to get a driving <span>permit</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Joel</span> <span>studied</span> for a few <span>days</span>, and <span>passed</span> his <span>test</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 With the <span>permit</span> in <span>hand</span>, <span>Joel</span> next had to find <span>someone</span> to <span>teach</span> him how to drive.<br/>
🎧 <span>Joel</span> already <span>knew</span> who to ask for driving <span>lessons</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 If I'm going to <span>teach</span> you how to drive, you're going to have to <span>commit</span> <span>100</span> <span>percent</span>. Do you <span>understand</span>? <span>Joel's</span> <span>uncle</span> <span>asked</span> him. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Yes, sir, <span>responded</span> <span>Joel</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 After a month full of <span>trial</span> and <span>error</span>, <span>Joel</span> finally <span>learned</span> how to drive his car. <span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>Fifteen</span> <span>minutes</span> had <span>passed</span> and the <span>creaking</span> hadn't <span>stopped</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Alvin</span> <span>slowly</span> <span>rose</span> from his bed. <span><br/></span>
