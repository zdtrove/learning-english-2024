🎧 At precisely 6 a.m., the sound of the alarm clock pierces the air. <br />
🎧 Sandy drags herself out of bed and begins her morning routine with a quick shower. <br/>
🎧 After her shower, she prepares a simple breakfast. <br/>
🎧 Grabbing a clean bowl from the dishwasher, she empties into it a packet of instant oatmeal. <br/>
🎧 She pours in a cup of milk, stirs and heats the mixture in the microwave. <br/>
🎧 While waiting for her oatmeal to cook, she dresses for the day, mindful of the weather.<br/>
🎧 Fully dressed now, she removes her oatmeal from the microwave, which has now cooled just enough to suit her taste. <br/>
🎧 It is her favorite flavor, apple cinnamon. <br/>
🎧 As she savors each bite, she is reminded of her mother, who always made sure Sandy ate a warm breakfast before leaving the house in the morning.<br/>
🎧 Checking the time on her phone, she hurriedly swallows the last few mouthful of oatmeal before heading out. <br/>
🎧 As she steps into the street, a gust of wind blows back her hair. <br/>
🎧 She covers her head with the hood of her coat, tightens the scarf around her neck, and braces for her walk to the train station.<br/>
🎧 After settling into her seat on the train, memories of her mother stir again. <br/>
🎧 She takes out her phone and texts: Hey mom, thanks for the scarf you knit me. It came in real handy this morning. Love always.<br/>

🎧 Pulling into the parking lot of the largest supermarket in town, Joe could already see it was going to be a challenge to find parking on this Saturday morning. <br/>
🎧 He decides to first drop off his wife Melissa, so she could get a head start on the shopping they need to do. <br/>
🎧 Meanwhile, he battles to find a free spot amongst the crowd of other waiting cars.<br/>
🎧 Inside, Joe finally finds Melissa, whose cart already loaded with packages of organic snacks and drinks. <br/>
🎧 He knows Melissa is easily tempted by fancy words that promise health benefits. <br/>
🎧 It makes her feel good to know that she is making healthy decisions. In the past, Joe would try to reason with her, explaining that health is not about consuming specific items, and more about general lifestyle. <br/>
🎧 Today, he decides to simply move on. As the chef in the family, Joe looks forward every week to the process of selecting meats and vegetables, imagining all the ways he can flavor and cook them. Free samples are being offered at the familiar locations â€“ Melissa makes sure to hit up every station. They agree the chicken sausage is their favorite and buy two packs. <br/>
🎧 The buy-one-get-one-free fresh pasta attracts Joe, while the sale on cheesecake draws Melissa.<br/>
🎧 As they wait in line to check out, Melissa examines their overflowing shopping cart and realizes that they are over budget. <br/>
🎧 She puts back the snacks and drinks that were clearly impulse buys, and happily claims she is learning to be a great shopper! <br/>
🎧 Joe can only smile at the expression on her face. <br/>
🎧 Five months ago when they first got married, he never imagined he would enjoy these Saturday morning grocery trips. <br/>
🎧 Now, he finds in them a peaceful satisfaction, a welcome change from his work all week.<br/>

🎧 All week, Frank and Bob have been looking forward to Sunday afternoon. <br/>
🎧 That is when their favorite football team, the Philadelphia Eagles, plays their first game of the season. <br/>
🎧 The Eagles have a new coach, and many new, young, and talented players. <br/>
🎧 Football can be a very unpredictable game, with weather, injuries, referees, and luck all affecting the outcome of the game. <br/>
🎧 On top of that, new players and coaches may need some time to learn to work as a team.<br/>
🎧 For almost a decade now, Frank and Bob have watched Eagles games together. <br/>
🎧 They met through work, but their friendship continues even though Frank left the company a few years back. <br/>
🎧 Their wives have become close and sometimes even join them for the games. <br/>
🎧 When their sons were still young, they used to be just as excited about these Sunday afternoons. <br/>
🎧 Now in high school, they'd rather hang out with their friends than their fathers. <br/>
🎧 Nonetheless, Frank and Bob have kept up their friendship and this tradition, and couldn't think of a better way to spend Sunday afternoons.<br/>
🎧 This week, they will be watching the game at Bob's house, who is anxious to show off the new sound system he installed in his basement. <br/>
🎧 As Frank walks up the driveway, carrying a pack of their favorite beer, Bob walks out to meet him, already dressed in Eagle's uniform. <br/>
🎧 After some playful punching, they come together for a quick embrace. <br/>
🎧 Once inside, they are greeted by the familiar sounds of the pre-game show. <br/>
🎧 It's going to be a great season!<br/>

🎧 Julie was sitting in bed late at night playing with her brand-new smartphone. <br/>
🎧 Earlier that week, she had been visited by her children and grandchildren to celebrate her 70th birthday, and had received the phone as a gift from her granddaughter Mary. <br/>
🎧 Julie had been widowed for five years now. <br/>
🎧 Since she lived hours away from the rest of the family, Mary thought the phone would be a good way for them to keep in touch and take up some of her time.<br/>
🎧 Up until then, Julie had never really been interested in catching up with modern technology, but finally owning her own smartphone made her feel youthful, and she decided to join Facebook since that was what she had noticed all the younger people were doing. <br/>
🎧 However, when making her profile page, she was embarrassed to put up a picture of herself since she thought she looked much too wrinkly and nobody would want to talk to her. <br/>
🎧 To remedy this, she downloaded a picture of a beautiful 20-something year old from Google, posted it under her name, and went to sleep.<br/>
🎧 The next morning, Julie woke up and enthusiastically logged into Facebook in hopes that she would have one or two new friends. <br/>
🎧 She could not believe her eyes. <br/>
🎧 Her inbox was full of friend requests from dozens and dozens of young handsome men that were complimenting her beauty and wanted to know all about her.<br/>
🎧 Julie decided to accept only the best-looking ones and began chatting with them day and night, never letting them know that they were actually talking to a grandma. <br/>
🎧 The next time Julie met up with Mary, she thanked her so much for the phone and remarked, I haven't felt so young and pretty in years! Mary was confused and asked, Why? Julie just gave a mischievous smile and changed the topic.<br/>

🎧 Jennifer loved going out to bowl every Tuesday night. <br/>
🎧 She always liked bowling, but had never joined a bowling league until her friend Paul told her about a new league one day. <br/>
🎧 The two friends enjoyed going to Lucky Lanes on weekends, but had to wait for the league games to finish before they could bowl. <br/>
🎧 It did not bother them since they knew what time the league games were over. <br/>
🎧 Paul talked to the manager of Lucky Lanes one day and discovered that a new league was forming soon. <br/>
🎧 That's great, said Paul. <br/>
🎧 I'm going to ask Jennifer if she wants to join, too, added Paul.<br/>
🎧 When Jennifer heard the news, she wasn't as excited as Paul thought she would be. <br/>
🎧 What's wrong, Jen? asked Paul. <br/>
🎧 I just don't know if I'm good enough to play in a league, answered Jennifer. <br/>
🎧 Don't you have to be a good bowler to bowl in a league? Paul thought about it for a while before going back to the manager to ask if the new league was for good bowlers, or anyone could join.<br/>
🎧 The manager told him that this new league was for beginners, and added that Paul and Jennifer would be some of the best players in the new league. <br/>
🎧 Paul was very excited once again. <br/>
🎧 When he told Jennifer what the manager had said, Jennifer's response was, Where do I sign up? This made Paul very happy.<br/>
🎧 Before long, the two friends were bowling away in their new team and league. <br/>
🎧 The manager was right. <br/>
🎧 Paul and Jennifer were among the best players. <br/>
🎧 They both loved bowling in a league. <br/>
🎧 They got to wear team bowling shirts and hats, and all the refreshments were included in the league fees. <br/>
🎧 Soon they were knocking down pins. <br/>
🎧 At the end of the season, their team won the trophy for coming in the first place!<br/>

🎧 When William worked in Santa Fe Springs, California, back in the 90s, he told me he thought the building he worked at was haunted. <br/>
🎧 It really is, said William. <br/>
🎧 I have had more than a few incidents happen to me while I was working alone, late at night, he continued.<br/>
🎧 William was working as a manager for a very busy chemical distribution company at the time. <br/>
🎧 In order to keep up with his work, he sometimes had to work at night, or go in on weekends to catch up with his paperwork.<br/>
🎧 William was a sensible man. <br/>
🎧 He was not the type of person that would fly off the handle in troubling situations. <br/>
🎧 He was always very calm, and composed. <br/>
🎧 This is what made his story believable. <br/>
🎧 I knew he wasn't the type to make things up.<br/>
🎧 One night, William went to work after dark and thought nothing of it. <br/>
🎧 His former manager had told him that he might hear some weird noises coming from the warehouse, but it was only the 55-gallon drums expanding and contracting. <br/>
🎧 During the heat of the day, the drums would expand, and at night, when it cooled off, the drums would contract, sometimes making a sound. <br/>
🎧 William was not worried.<br/>
🎧 That night he was sitting at his desk when he heard what sounded like someone knocking on the door leading to the warehouse. <br/>
🎧 William dismissed it as a drum popping, and ignored it. <br/>
🎧 A few moments later, the sound was back, and this time it was louder. <br/>
🎧 Since there was no one else in the building, he became a bit nervous, but continued working. <br/>
🎧 Soon the noises got louder and louder. <br/>
🎧 The final straw was when he heard someone walking above the ceiling of his office. <br/>
🎧 This scared him quite a bit, but again he ignored it. <br/>
🎧 Finally, it happened again, and this time William ran into the warehouse to look above his office, but no one was there. <br/>
🎧 After that, William never worked at night again.<br/>

🎧 Jerry was seventeen when his family decided to move out their apartment in the city of Riverdale. <br/>
🎧 They had lived there for nearly ten years. In those ten years, Jerry had made dozens of friends from around the city. <br/>
🎧 He didn't understand why they had to move. <br/>
🎧 Jerry wished he could stay behind while his family left to Arizona. <br/>
🎧 He knew things weren't ever going to be the same if he left Riverdale, California.<br/>
🎧 Why do we have to move? Jerry would ask, sounding depressed. <br/>
🎧 His parents had answered that question countless times already. <br/>
🎧 Despite knowing the answer, Jerry was reluctant to believe it, so he kept asking. <br/>
🎧 Why do we have to move? Jerry asked time after time. <br/>
🎧 The simple truth was that Jerry and his family just could not afford to live in Riverdale any longer. <br/>
🎧 It was hard for Jerry to accept that truth.<br/>
🎧 On the day before the move, Jerry walked around the familiar places in Riverdale. <br/>
🎧 He walked passing the oak tree where he first kissed a girl. <br/>
🎧 He walked past the corner mini-market where he would bring back milk every Sunday. <br/>
🎧 He passed by his high school where he had learned and discovered his love of math and science.<br/>
🎧 Jerry knocked on the doors of friends' houses to say one final goodbye. <br/>
🎧 Good bye, Tom, Jerry told his best friend. <br/>
🎧 Goodbye Jane, Jerry told his girlfriend. <br/>
🎧 The night fell when Jerry finally finished bidding his farewells to everybody he knew. <br/>
🎧 Goodbye, Riverdale, Jerry said, looking out his bedroom window as he went to sleep. <br/>
🎧 That night, Jerry dreamed of moving to Arizona and making friends on the first day there. <br/>
🎧 Everything in Arizona seemed great in his dream. <br/>
🎧 The following morning when he awoke, Jerry no longer felt so bad about moving. <br/>
🎧 Everything is going to be all right, Jerry said to himself as he stepped into the moving van on his way to Arizona.<br/>

🎧 Joel had been working at a bookstore for four months. <br/>
🎧 Although four months might seem like a long time, Joel felt like it had been only one month since he was hired. <br/>
🎧 Working at a bookstore was a dream job for Joel. <br/>
🎧 He couldn't believe he got hired on the day of his interview. <br/>
🎧 Joel felt grateful to be working at where he was. <br/>
🎧 He loved to brag all about his job to his friends and family.<br/>
🎧 Joel loved reading books on his spare time. <br/>
🎧 His favorite author was Mark Twain. <br/>
🎧 Joel's most beloved book of his was The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. <br/>
🎧 Working at a bookstore not only gave Joel access to books, but allowed him to interact with other fellow book worms. <br/>
🎧 Joel often would recommend books to customers, and customers would do the same for Joel. <br/>
🎧 Every now and then, he would come across a classic book and take it for himself to read. <br/>
🎧 Joel's manager allowed him one book for free once a week. <br/>
🎧 It was difficult to decide which book to take sometimes.<br/>
🎧 Joel was getting paid three hundred dollars every two weeks. <br/>
🎧 Sometimes he would surpass this amount when he worked overtime. <br/>
🎧 After a couple of months, Joel had saved up enough money to finally purchase his first car. <br/>
🎧 Buying a car was the main reason Joel wanted to start working. <br/>
🎧 He began shopping online for used vehicles.<br/>
🎧 Joel already knew what kind of car he wanted. <br/>
🎧 He had first seen a picture of it in a magazine, and since then, had dreamed of owning one of his very own. <br/>
🎧 His dream car was 1984 BMW. <br/>
🎧 Joel wanted a black one with two doors. <br/>
🎧 He would search on the Internet until he finally found it. <br/>
🎧 Joel could not believe when he discovered a seller with the car.<br/>

🎧 Learning to drive seemed scary for Joel at first. <br/>
🎧 He had recently purchased his first car, which was now sitting on his driveway, looking clean and shiny. <br/>
🎧 The previous owner had maintained it for years and had spent a lot of money restoring it to its original condition. <br/>
🎧 The car was a BMW, made in the year 1984. <br/>
🎧 It was black and had only two doors. <br/>
🎧 The interior was also black and had leather seating. <br/>
🎧 The vehicle looked practically new to Joel, despite it being older than the new owner of it.<br/>
🎧 Joel was eager to start driving his new car. <br/>
🎧 At 21, Joel had felt the need to be driving already. <br/>
🎧 He was attending college in the city of Los Angeles, working at a bookstore in the city of Montebello, and living in the city of Bell. <br/>
🎧 Having a car would make traveling much more convenient. <br/>
🎧 Joel had been getting around by means of public transportation. <br/>
🎧 He was ready to stop taking the bus to school and work.<br/>
🎧 The first thing Joel had to do was to go to DMV to register the car under his name. <br/>
🎧 After that, he took a driving manual book from DMV to study for the written test. <br/>
🎧 Passing the written test was the only way to get a driving permit. <br/>
🎧 Joel studied for a few days, and passed his test. <br/>
🎧 With the permit in hand, Joel next had to find someone to teach him how to drive.<br/>
🎧 Joel already knew who to ask for driving lessons. <br/>
🎧 If I'm going to teach you how to drive, you're going to have to commit 100 percent. Do you understand? Joel's uncle asked him. <br/>
🎧 Yes, sir, responded Joel. <br/>
🎧 After a month full of trial and error, Joel finally learned how to drive his car. <br/>
🎧 Although it was scary at first, driving eventually became easy enough for Joel.<br/>

🎧 Do you believe in ghost? Alvin asked his brother Levi one night, as they were lying down in bed around eleven at night. <br/>
🎧 I don't think so, Levi replied. <br/>
🎧 Alvin and Levi shared a room together. <br/>
🎧 Why not? asked Alvin. <br/>
🎧 I have never seen one, Levi said. <br/>
🎧 Alvin was twelve years old and Levi was eighteen. <br/>
