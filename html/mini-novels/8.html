🎧 Scott received a paintball gun and some paintballs from his mom for his 16th birthday. <br />
🎧 When his mom gave him the present, she told him that she would take him to a paintball range with some of his friends. <br />
🎧 The range was in an open field and the company that owned the range provided safety equipment like padding and facemasks. <br />
🎧 Getting hit by a paintball hurt and could cause serious injury. <br />
🎧 The paintball range was 20 miles away, and Scott had to wait till the weekend to try out his new equipment. <br />
🎧 He didn't want to wait that long. <br />
🎧 He wanted to play with his new toy now.<br />
🎧 When his mom was taking a nap, he texted a friend who lived down the block to meet him in front of his house. <br />
🎧 I want to show you what I got for my birthday, Scott told his friend. <br />
🎧 He loaded up the paintball gun with the colored balls filled with brightly colored paint. <br />
🎧 He started shooting it at the trashcans that were on the curb. <br />
🎧 Just then a police patrol car was driving down the street. <br />
🎧 Scott missed the trashcans and ended up shooting a paintball right at the police car. <br />
🎧 The police thought they were under attack. <br />
🎧 Scott knew he had done something wrong and ran inside the house with his friend. <br />
🎧 Soon a police helicopter was flying overhead, and Scott could hear police sirens approaching his house.<br />
🎧 The sounds of the helicopter and the sirens woke up Scott's mother. <br />
🎧 She looked out her window and saw a spotlight right on her house, and three police cars arrived. <br />
🎧 What is going on? she wondered aloud. <br />
🎧 She went to the living room and turned on the local news to see if there was any information about what was happening in her neighborhood.<br />

🎧 Bob knew that the house he just purchased was in a historically rough neighborhood. <br />
🎧 There was a history of gang violence, including shootings, in the neighborhood. <br />
🎧 That is probably why the house was so inexpensive. <br />
🎧 The previous owners of the house had it foreclosed. <br />
🎧 Then some house flippers bought the property for a very cheap price, renovated it, raised the sales price, and sold it. <br />
🎧 Bob thought the house was still a good bargain though.<br />
🎧 After he moved in, Bob began to see that many of the renovations to the home were merely cosmetic. <br />
🎧 While the house flippers put in new stainless steel appliances in the kitchen, they hadn't upgraded the electrical work. <br />
🎧 This meant that every time Bob ran the dishwasher and the coffee machine, all the power in the house went out. <br />
🎧 Bob spent over $1,000 dollars to have the house rewired. <br />
🎧 The new carpets that the house flippers installed was put over the original hardwood floors. <br />
🎧 Bob decided to rip out the ugly oatmeal colored carpets and refinish the old floors. <br />
🎧 That was another $3,000.<br />
🎧 The house was an old stucco house that got very hot in the summer and cold in the winter. <br />
🎧 The house flippers installed some cheap windows. <br />
🎧 Bob hired a contractor to put in new double pane storm windows and install ceiling fans. <br />
🎧 That was another few thousand dollars. <br />
🎧 Bob wanted to make the house energy efficient, so he leased solar panels that were installed on the roof. <br />
🎧 This not only lowered his monthly electric bill, but added value to the home.<br />
🎧 Within two years, all the changes Bob made to the house totaled more than $20,000. <br />
🎧 In that time the value of his home rose almost $100,000. <br />
🎧 Bob felt he made a good investment. <br />
🎧 He knew when he sold the home, he would get more money than he paid.<br />

🎧 When Johnny was a kid, all he talked about was becoming a baseball star. <br />
🎧 Of course he wasn't alone. <br />
🎧 Most young boys growing up in the United States want to become a major league baseball player at one time or another. <br />
🎧 He remembers watching his favorite players on TV when he was young, and how his father would take him to see the Giants play at Candlestick Park.<br />
🎧 Johnny recalls the old stadium, and how big it seemed to him as a child. <br />
🎧 His dad took him onto the field one day when the team was having a photo day. <br />
🎧 Johnny couldn't believe how big the field was. <br />
🎧 All his favorite Giants were there taking pictures with fans. <br />
🎧 Can I take a picture with Willie Mays' dad, Johnny asked gleefully. <br />
🎧 Of course, Johnny. Let's get in line, said his dad. <br />
🎧 Willie Mays was one of the greatest players to ever play the game, and he loved kids, too. <br />
🎧 That is why the line to take a picture with him was so long. <br />
🎧 Johnny didn't mind though. <br />
🎧 He was in baseball heaven.<br />
🎧 The Giants played their archrival, the Los Angeles Dodgers, that day. <br />
🎧 There had always been a bit of bad blood between the two teams over the years. <br />
🎧 It started when both teams were based in New York. <br />
🎧 They were cross-town rivals at that time. <br />
🎧 After the teams moved to California in the late 1950s, the rivalry continued.<br />
🎧 The Dodgers were always one of the better teams in the National League, and even though Johnny grew up a Giants fan, he really didn't hate the Dodgers. <br />
🎧 I think the rivalry was blown up, to tell the truth, Johnny said years later. <br />
🎧 Baseball fans are very fickle and stubborn though, and some play the rivalry up as much as they can. <br />
🎧 No true Dodger, or Giant fan would ever admit liking the other team in public, but Johnny suspects there is a mutual respect for each team in both cities.<br />

🎧 Last week Chris went on her first deep sea fishing trip off the coast of Catalina Island. <br />
🎧 She had always enjoyed fishing when she was a child, but had never gone fishing in the ocean. <br />
🎧 Her dad liked to fish very often. <br />
🎧 Her big brother Jack was never the outdoor type, so her dad took her out often. <br />
🎧 One of his favorite spots was Lake Isabella, which was about two hours from their home. <br />
🎧 She recalls how she and her dad would spend a long, leisurely day driving to the lake, and then taking his small boat out on the water. <br />
🎧 It was quiet and peaceful for the most part. <br />
🎧 Those memories remain some of her most cherished moments of her life.<br />
🎧 Chris has a friend called Robert. <br />
🎧 On this day, Robert invited Chris to join him on his company's fishing trip. <br />
🎧 Robert said it wouldn't cost much, but would be a lot of fun. <br />
🎧 He knew Chris enjoyed lake fishing and figured she would have a great time. <br />
🎧 Okay, said Chris, and to the ocean they went.<br />
🎧 The first thing Chris noticed, however, was the motion. <br />
🎧 Wow, this boat really rocks, Chris told Robert. <br />
🎧 Don't worry about it. You will get used to it, he said. <br />
🎧 The trip to the waters off Catalina Island took about an hour. <br />
🎧 Chris marveled at how quickly she lost sight of the mainland. <br />
🎧 It was a bit scary when she thought about how alone they were in this great ocean. <br />
🎧 As Soon, it was time to collect squid for bait. <br />
🎧 The small boat stopped in the water, and the crew turned the bright light into the ocean to attract the squid. <br />
🎧 Before long, thousands of squid rose to the surface and were collected for bait.<br />
🎧 After about an hour, Chris didn't feel the rocking motion anymore. <br />
🎧 They were ready to fish. <br />
🎧 Chris caught her first ocean trout. <br />
🎧 It was a beautiful day.<br />

🎧 The principal felt Tina was creating more work for her and her staff. <br />
🎧 She thought Tina was a troublemaker.<br />
🎧 The way Tina looked didn't help her. <br />

🎧 One evening, after Tina's daughter received an award for her good grades, Tina went up to greet the principal. <br />
🎧 The principal responded coldly: Congratulations. <br />

🎧 When you grow up, don't become like your mother, the principal told the young girl. <br />
🎧 The little girl was confused. <br />
🎧 Tina was furious. <br />
🎧 How dare the principal speak to her that way? <br />
🎧 Tina may not have looked like all the other parents, but what she looked like shouldn't matter. <br />
🎧 Tina's daughter hugged her mother. <br />
🎧 I don't care that you have green hair, mommy, she said, I care that you care about me and my school.<br />

🎧 Millie's sister Arlene had been battling breast cancer for five years. <br />
🎧 Then the doctor gave Arlene some bad news. <br />
🎧 The cancer had spread to her brain and there was no treatment that would cure her. <br />
🎧 I'll keep taking care of you, Millie told her sister. <br />

🎧 Donald Walker always looked forward to summer. <br />
🎧 As he sat down in class, he thought about all the things he was going to do during his summer break. <br />
🎧 He even made a list. <br />
🎧 On the top of his list was swimming. <br />
🎧 Donald loved to go swimming. <br />
🎧 Even though he was excited to get a break, there was something, or someone he was going to miss. <br />
🎧 Sarah Lee Parker was his classmate, but he rarely talked to her. <br />
🎧 Donald liked Sarah a lot. <br />
🎧 He knew he was going to miss her.<br />
🎧 The first day of summer had arrived. <br />
🎧 Donald woke up around noon. <br />
🎧 He hated waking up early for school, so he wanted to sleep late for the first day of summer. <br />
🎧 As soon as he woke up, he put on his swimming shorts, got a towel, kissed his mom goodbye, and ran to the park to go to the pool. <br />
🎧 As Donald jumped into the pool, his heart began to beat fast. <br />
🎧 The water was clear, but cold.<br />
🎧 One of Donald's favorite things to do at the pool was to go on the diving board. <br />
🎧 As Donald stood on the edge of the diving board, he started jumping in order to get high enough to do a flip. <br />
🎧 He jumped once, and then twice. <br />
🎧 When he was about to jump off again, he saw that Sarah was looking at him from the entrance of the pool. <br />
🎧 Donald got so nervous that he couldn't finish the flip, and he landed on his back. <br />
🎧 Everyone in the deep end of the pool started laughing. <br />
🎧 Donald felt embarrassed as he swam to the edge of the pool, but when he got there he saw Sarah waiting for him. <br />
🎧 Ouch, that had to hurt. You want to go swimming with me? Sarah asked Donald. <br />
🎧 Donald said sure nervously, and started swimming with Sarah. <br />
🎧 Donald had never been happier, and never been in that much pain.<br />

🎧 Paul hated that it was always hot. <br />
🎧 Mark hated that the park by his house was always crowded. <br />
🎧 I hate summer, Paul told Mark as they played video games in Mark's room.<br />
🎧 I know. Besides not going to school, there is nothing else that's good about summer, Mark said.<br />
🎧 As the two friends played their game, Mark's mom started getting upset with the boys. <br />

🎧 Mark's mom had enough; she unplugged the game and told Mark that they had to go outside and do something else. <br />

🎧 When they got there, they realized that two of their friends were at the arcade, too. <br />
🎧 It was Susan and Carol. <br />
🎧 Paul liked Susan; Mark didn't really like Carol that much, but he agreed to stay with Carol, so that Paul could hang out with Susan alone. <br />
