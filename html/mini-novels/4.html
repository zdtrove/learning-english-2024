🎧 Ever since Mary moved to the United States one year ago, she often heard the phrase no such thing as free lunch. <br />
🎧 While she understood this to mean that you can't get something for nothing, she heard other mothers at her child's school talking about the free lunch program.<br />
🎧 How much does it cost to enroll? Mary asked the secretary at her child's school. <br />
🎧 The secretary smiled and told Mary that it didn't cost anything except a little bit of time. <br />
🎧 In order to find out if Mary's child was qualified to get free lunch at school, she had to fill out a form. <br />
🎧 The form was available in many languages besides English. <br />
🎧 It asked Mary basic questions like where she lived, how many children she had, and what her annual income was.<br />
🎧 Filling out the form was easy, and Mary didn't have to include proof of her income. <br />
🎧 She was worried though if the information on the form would be shared with other agencies. <br />
🎧 The secretary told her that the information was not shared. <br />
🎧 If Mary made below a certain amount annually, her child could get free lunch not just during the school year, but also even during the summer, when there was no school.<br />
🎧 Mary knew this would help her family. <br />
🎧 While Mary did work, she only worked part-time. <br />
🎧 Giving her child money for lunch every day did add up and impact the family budget.<br />
🎧 After filling out and submitting the form back to the school secretary, Mary had to wait a month or two before finding out if she was qualified. <br />
🎧 A few weeks after she submitted the form, a letter arrived in the mail. <br />
🎧 The letter informed her that her child was qualified. <br />
🎧 The letter also told her that her child could also get free breakfast in school.<br />

🎧 Tom noticed that every morning when he went to school, his mother would give him a letter to drop in the mailbox on the corner. <br />
🎧 Who are you writing to so much? he asked. <br />
🎧 I'm just trying my luck, Tom's mother told him.<br />
🎧 A few weeks after Tom started mailing out the letters, he noticed that his mother was getting a lot more mail. <br />
🎧 Some of the mail advertised on the envelope that she might already be a winner. <br />
🎧 His mother was also getting many more magazines. <br />
🎧 Some of the magazines were about things his mother didn't eve care about, like cats.<br />
🎧 Mom, why are you getting so many magazines? Tom asked her. <br />
🎧 She told him that she had been entering contests and that part of the process included subscribing to magazines. <br />
🎧 It will increase my chances of winning the jackpot, she told him. <br />
🎧 Soon the family mailbox was filled with more contests announcements, magazines, and bills.<br />
🎧 Tom's mother was surprised. <br />
🎧 She didn't think that checking off the boxes of magazines that looked interesting and affixing stickers to the return forms would cost her. <br />
🎧 She was spending more and more money and hadn't won anything. <br />
🎧 She wanted to be like the people in the commercials she saw on television. <br />
🎧 People bringing balloons and oversized checks surprised those people who entered the contests. <br />
🎧 Tom read the fine print. <br />
🎧 The magazines weren't free and Tom's mother was not increasing her chances of winning anything by subscribing. <br />
🎧 Tom did some research and found out there had even been lawsuits against the companies running the contests and selling the magazine subscriptions.<br />
🎧 Tom's mother felt bad. <br />
🎧 It pays to win, mom, but you can't pay to win, Tom told her. <br />
🎧 Tom's mother wondered what she was going to do with all these magazines.<br />

🎧 His mother told James that it would be okay, and that he would make new friends.<br />

🎧 My best friend's name is Joseph Taylor, but he prefers to be called Joe. <br />
🎧 He does a lot of stupid stuff, and it usually gets him in trouble. <br />
🎧 The other day, while he was trying to impress some girls, he fell off his skateboard and broke his arm. <br />

🎧 We got two hamburgers and two sodas, and then we went walking around the mall. <br />
🎧 For some reason, Joe always liked stealing things from the stores at the mall. <br />
🎧 I never understood why he stole the things he did. <br />
🎧 For example, that day he stole three key chains, five pairs of socks, and a t-shirt of a television show that he had never heard of. <br />
🎧 Joe always said the same thing when he got out of the store, I love the rush of stealing! <br />
🎧 I always looked at him, shook my head, and called him an idiot.<br />
🎧 The worst was yet to come. <br />

🎧 The security guard took us to his office, and called our parents. <br />
🎧 I was worried because I knew my dad would yell at me. <br />
🎧 Joe, on the other hand, was laughing and was telling me jokes. <br />
🎧 When our parents showed up to pick us up, Joe looked at me, smiling, and said, See you in a couple of months. <br />
