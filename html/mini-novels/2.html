🎧 <span>Bobby</span> loved to eat. <span><br/></span>
🎧 He <span>ate</span> <span>hamburgers</span>, <span>French</span> <span>fries</span>, hot <span>dogs</span>, <span>pizza</span>, <span>donuts</span>, and <span>ice-cream</span>, just to name a few. <span><br/></span>
🎧 No <span>matter</span> how much <span>Bobby</span> <span>ate</span>, he never got a <span>stomachache</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 It is no <span>surprise</span> that <span>Bobby</span> <span>weighs</span> two <span>hundred</span> and <span>fifty</span> <span>pounds</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 It might be <span>surprising</span> to know that <span>Bobby</span> is only <span>fifteen</span> years old. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Bobby</span> didn't <span>care</span> that he was big. <span><br/></span>
🎧 He was <span>content</span> with how he <span>looked</span> and loved <span>eating</span> as much as he could.<br/>
🎧 <span>Bobby</span> <span>liked</span> to tell <span>jokes</span> to his friends. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Knock</span>, <span>knock</span>, <span>Bobby</span> would say. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Who's there? friends would ask. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Gorilla</span>, <span>Bobby</span> <span>replied</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Gorilla</span> who? they'd ask back. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Gorilla</span> me a <span>hamburger</span>! <span>Bobby</span> <span>replied</span>, <span>delivering</span> the <span>punch</span> <span>line</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 The <span>joke</span> was in how the <span>word</span> <span>gorilla</span> <span>sounded</span> like <span>grill</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Bobby's</span> <span>joke</span> always <span>left</span> people in <span>stitches</span>.<br/>
🎧 Even though <span>Bobby</span> was <span>popular</span> and <span>friendly</span>, he was still <span>teased</span> by some <span>kids</span> in school. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Fat boy <span>Bobby</span> was the <span>nick</span> name the mean <span>kids</span> gave to <span>Bobby</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Whenever</span> <span>Bobby</span> heard the <span>nick</span> name, he would <span>reply</span> with <span>gusto</span>, <span>sticks</span> and <span>stones</span> may <span>break</span> my <span>bones</span>, but <span>words</span> can never <span>hurt</span> me. <span><br/></span>
🎧 The <span>bullies</span> would <span>funnily</span> <span>reply</span>, I bet you would eat those <span>sticks</span> and <span>stones</span>, fat boy <span>Bobby</span>! and <span>scurry</span> off <span>running</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Bobby</span> did not let <span>idiotic</span> name <span>calling</span> <span>bother</span> him. <span><br/></span>
🎧 He had more important things to think about, like what he was going to eat for dinner. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Bobby</span> <span>knew</span> that one day he would have to <span>lose</span> <span>weight</span> if he <span>wished</span> to live a <span>longer</span> life. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Until that day came, <span>Bobby</span> would <span>continue</span> <span>eating</span> what he wanted and as much he wanted.<br/>

🎧 <span>Jenny</span> is a <span>fifth</span> <span>grader</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 She is <span>considered</span> one of the most <span>popular</span> girls in her class. <span><br/></span>
🎧 She is very <span>pretty</span>, but that is not why she is <span>considered</span> <span>popular</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 She is <span>popular</span> because she is <span>known</span> to be <span>among</span> the <span>brightest</span> in her class. <span><br/></span>
🎧 She can do the most <span>cartwheels</span> in a row, but <span>mostly</span>, she has the <span>talent</span> to <span>dance</span>.<br/>
🎧 Last year, she <span>entered</span> the <span>school's</span> <span>dance</span> <span>competition</span> and <span>won</span> the first place. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Her whole class was there to <span>support</span> her. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Since that day, she has been the class <span>attraction</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 This year, the school is <span>holding</span> another <span>dance</span> <span>competition</span>, but there has been a change in this <span>year's</span> <span>competition</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 The <span>competition</span> has to be done in <span>pairs</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Jenny's</span> class was looking up to her with high <span>expectations</span> of her <span>winning</span> again this year. <span><br/></span>
🎧 On the other <span>hand</span>, <span>Jenny</span> was <span>unsure</span> of this <span>year's</span> <span>outcome</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 She wanted to <span>enter</span> the <span>competition</span>, but she had never <span>danced</span> with a <span>partner</span> before. <span><br/></span>
🎧 She <span>decided</span> to ask some of the <span>boys</span> in her class to <span>enter</span> with her. <span><br/></span>
🎧 They all said no to her because they did not know how to <span>dance</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Jenny</span> was <span>becoming</span> <span>hesitant</span> about <span>joining</span>.<br/>
🎧 She finally <span>decided</span> to <span>turn</span> to one of her <span>closest</span> friends, <span>Carl</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Jenny</span> and <span>Carl</span> had <span>known</span> each other since the first <span>grade</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Carl</span> was <span>reluctant</span> to join at first because he also didn't know how to <span>dance</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Jenny</span> <span>insisted</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 He <span>eventually</span> agreed to join the <span>competition</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Jenny</span> was happy and <span>relieved</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, she was still <span>worried</span> because she <span>knew</span> her class was <span>counting</span> on her to win this <span>year's</span> <span>competition</span>.<br/>
🎧 All she <span>needed</span> was some time and practice in order to <span>increase</span> her <span>chances</span> of <span>winning</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 This time, it was going to be more of a <span>challenge</span> <span>considering</span> the <span>fact</span> that <span>Carl</span> was not a good <span>dancer</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 The <span>competition</span> was in two <span>months</span>, and only time could <span>predict</span> her <span>chances</span> of <span>winning</span>.<br/>

🎧 After <span>selecting</span> <span>Carl</span> as her <span>partner</span>, <span>Jenny</span> <span>needed</span> to start planning for the <span>dance</span> <span>competition</span> at her school. <span><br/></span>
🎧 The <span>competition</span> <span>started</span> in two <span>months</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Jenny</span> was <span>aware</span> that <span>Carl</span> was not a great <span>dancer</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 She had to <span>dedicate</span> some time in <span>helping</span> him <span>improve</span> his <span>skill</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 On the first few <span>days</span> of <span>preparation</span>, <span>Jenny</span> had <span>planned</span> out their <span>dance</span> <span>routine</span>, with the help of her <span>teacher</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 They were going to be <span>dancing</span> to <span>Jailhouse</span> <span>Rock</span> by <span>Elvis</span> <span>Presley</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Jenny</span> and <span>Carl</span> <span>spent</span> the first two <span>weeks</span> <span>memorizing</span> their <span>steps</span> and <span>cues</span> to their <span>dance</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Carl</span> was <span>pretty</span> <span>clumsy</span> at first. <span><br/></span>
🎧 He <span>eventually</span> got the <span>hang</span> of it. <span><br/></span>
🎧 They <span>spent</span> the <span>rest</span> of the time <span>perfecting</span> their <span>moves</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 The day of the <span>competition</span> was almost near. <span><br/></span>

🎧 They were going up <span>against</span> <span>nine</span> other <span>pairs</span> from the same school.<br/>
🎧 The day of the <span>competition</span> <span>arrived</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Carl</span> had not become a great <span>dancer</span>, but had definitely <span>improved</span> since he <span>began</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Since <span>Jenny</span> <span>won</span> last <span>year's</span> <span>competition</span>, she was to <span>perform</span> with <span>Carl</span> last. <span><br/></span>
🎧 The <span>pairs</span> that were <span>performing</span> this year were better <span>dancers</span> <span>compared</span> to last <span>year's</span> <span>competition</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 As each <span>pair</span> took the <span>stage</span> one by one, <span>Jenny</span> <span>grew</span> more <span>anxious</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Carl</span> <span>noticed</span> this from <span>Jenny</span> and told her, It'll be okay, <span>Jenny</span>. You are great, and I'm sure we'll win. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Jenny</span> <span>felt</span> better after <span>hearing</span> <span>Carl's</span> <span>words</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Soon, it was their <span>turn</span> to <span>perform</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 They <span>walked</span> on <span>stage</span> and <span>began</span> to <span>dance</span> as soon as their <span>song</span> <span>started</span> to play.<br/>
🎧 They were off to a great start. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Jenny's</span> class was there <span>cheering</span> them on. <span><br/></span>
🎧 The <span>crowd</span> <span>began</span> <span>cheering</span> them on as well. <span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>Jenny</span> and <span>Carl</span> were full of <span>cheer</span>.<br/>

🎧 Two years ago, <span>Amy</span> <span>left</span> her small <span>hometown</span> in <span>England</span> and <span>moved</span> to one of the <span>biggest</span> <span>cities</span> in the <span>United</span> <span>States</span> <span>--</span> New <span>York</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Amy</span> <span>knew</span> the <span>transition</span> would be <span>difficult</span> at first, but was <span>confident</span> that she would love her new life and <span>succeed</span> in <span>becoming</span> a <span>Broadway</span> <span>star</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 She had <span>envisioned</span> <span>herself</span> getting off the <span>airplane</span> and <span>immediately</span> <span>making</span> new friends with whom she would <span>spend</span> her <span>nights</span> <span>exploring</span> The <span>City</span> That Never <span>Sleeps</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Unfortunately</span>, the <span>reality</span> of <span>Amy's</span> <span>situation</span> was <span>far</span> from the perfect life she had <span>imagined</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Her <span>days</span> were <span>spent</span> <span>jumping</span> from <span>theatre</span> to <span>theatre</span> looking for <span>auditions</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Although she was very <span>pretty</span>, and great at <span>acting</span>, her <span>accent</span> made it <span>difficult</span> for her to get <span>hired</span> for any <span>roles</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Directors</span> <span>kept</span> <span>telling</span> her to work on her <span>American</span> <span>accent</span>, but the more she <span>practiced</span> it, the more she <span>sounded</span> like a <span>cowboy</span> rather than a New <span>Yorker</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Amy's</span> <span>nights</span> were <span>spent</span> working at a <span>diner</span> in order to pay for her <span>ridiculously</span> <span>expensive</span> <span>one-room</span> <span>apartment</span> where the <span>sinks</span> always <span>leaked</span> and the hot water never <span>worked</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 To top it all off, the <span>city</span> that she had <span>imagined</span> as being <span>filled</span> with <span>bright</span> <span>lights</span> and <span>friendly</span> <span>faces</span> like in the <span>movies</span> was made up <span>mostly</span> of <span>smelly</span> <span>alleys</span>, big <span>rats</span>, and <span>angry</span> <span>crowds</span> that were always in a <span>hurry</span> to get somewhere. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Still, <span>Amy</span> didn't let anything <span>crush</span> her <span>spirits</span>, and was <span>determined</span> to keep working <span>hard</span> until her <span>dreams</span> would come <span>true</span>.<br/>
🎧 Finally one day, <span>Amy</span> was <span>clearing</span> some <span>tables</span> in the <span>diner</span> while <span>singing</span> her <span>favorite</span> <span>song</span> as <span>usual</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Excuse</span> me, said a man in a <span>nearby</span> <span>booth</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 I couldn't help but <span>notice</span> that you have a <span>beautiful</span> <span>voice</span>. <span>Amy</span> <span>blushed</span> and <span>thanked</span> the man. <span><br/></span>
🎧 I'm actually <span>casting</span> for a <span>star</span> in my new <span>Broadway</span> <span>musical</span> of <span>Mary</span> <span>Poppins</span>, he <span>continued</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 How would you feel about <span>acting</span>? <span>Amy's</span> <span>heart</span> <span>raced</span> with <span>excitement</span> just as <span>Frank</span> <span>Sinatra's</span> New <span>York</span>, New <span>York</span> <span>began</span> playing on the <span>diner's</span> <span>jukebox</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 She was finally going to make it.<br/>

🎧 <span>John</span> is a <span>busy</span> <span>lawyer</span>, whose whole day <span>revolves</span> around two things: work and his two <span>daughters</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Balancing</span> the two things often <span>proves</span> to be very <span>difficult</span>, so <span>John</span> <span>spends</span> most of his day in a <span>rush</span> to do everything he needs to do, and get <span>everywhere</span> he needs to be. <span><br/></span>
🎧 With such a <span>hectic</span> <span>schedule</span>, it is <span>common</span> to find <span>John</span> and his children in <span>line</span> at a <span>McDonald's</span> <span>drive-thru</span>, <span>waiting</span> for some <span>burgers</span>, <span>fries</span>, and <span>shakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know <span>fast</span> food isn't the <span>healthiest</span> thing I could give my <span>daughters</span>, <span>admits</span> <span>John</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 But it's the most <span>convenient</span> thing around when we're in a <span>rush</span>. <span>Plus</span>, it makes them happy. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Unfortunately</span>, this <span>attitude</span> <span>towards</span> the <span>unhealthiness</span> of <span>fast</span> food is one that so many <span>parents</span> in the <span>U.S</span>. <span>hold</span>, and it is easy to <span>understand</span> why.<br/>
🎧 <span>Nowadays</span>, <span>nearly</span> every <span>single</span> <span>city</span> in <span>America</span> is <span>equipped</span> with its own <span>McDonald's</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 In <span>Los</span> <span>Angeles</span> <span>alone</span>, it can sometimes feel like there is one on every other <span>corner</span> when you're driving around. <span><br/></span>
🎧 As if this didn't already make it <span>hard</span> enough for <span>parents</span> to <span>avoid</span>, <span>McDonald's</span> <span>targets</span> their famous Happy <span>Meals</span> to children so that every time they drive by the <span>giant</span> <span>golden</span> <span>arches</span>, children <span>demand</span> to go inside to get a new toy with their <span>meal</span>.<br/>
🎧 Although it may be very <span>hard</span> for <span>parents</span> to have <span>healthier</span> <span>meal</span> options for their children, doing so is a <span>necessity</span> that this <span>country</span> can no <span>longer</span> <span>ignore</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Constantly</span> <span>consuming</span> <span>fast</span> food is <span>becoming</span> a <span>norm</span> in <span>American</span> <span>society</span> and is <span>resulting</span> in <span>millions</span> of people <span>suffering</span> from <span>obesity</span> and <span>diabetes</span> for the <span>rest</span> of their lives.<br/>
🎧 <span>Instead</span> of <span>teaching</span> children that it is okay to give in to the <span>temptation</span> of a <span>quick</span> <span>greasy</span> <span>meal</span>, <span>parents</span> should get their children into the <span>habit</span> of <span>healthy</span> <span>eating</span> <span>everywhere</span> they go. <span><br/></span>
🎧 In the end, children will be more <span>thankful</span> for living long, <span>healthy</span>, and happy lives, than for getting a <span>cheap</span> toy in a <span>cardboard</span> box.<br/>

🎧 <span>David</span> and <span>Melissa</span> had been a <span>happily</span> <span>married</span> <span>couple</span> for six years. <span><br/></span>
🎧 They <span>lived</span> a <span>comfortably</span> <span>modest</span> life in a small <span>apartment</span> and had been <span>saving</span> up for years in <span>preparation</span> for the next <span>giant</span> <span>step</span> in their life: a <span>baby</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, after <span>repeatedly</span> trying to get <span>pregnant</span> for a whole year, they <span>consulted</span> a <span>doctor</span> and <span>received</span> <span>devastating</span> <span>news</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Melissa</span> would be <span>unable</span> to <span>conceive</span> a <span>child</span> for the <span>rest</span> of her life.<br/>
🎧 The bad <span>news</span> <span>struck</span> <span>Melissa</span> <span>terribly</span> <span>hard</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Seeing</span> his <span>wife</span> in such a <span>distraught</span> and <span>depressed</span> <span>state</span> <span>broke</span> <span>David's</span> <span>heart</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Don't <span>worry</span>, he told her. <span><br/></span>
🎧 I'm going to make you the <span>happiest</span> <span>woman</span> in the <span>planet</span>, even if it's just the two of us. <span><br/></span>
🎧 He then went to the <span>bank</span>, took out all their <span>savings</span> that had been <span>held</span> for the <span>baby</span>, and set out to do whatever he could to <span>cheer</span> his <span>wife</span> up.<br/>
🎧 Since they no <span>longer</span> had to be <span>careful</span> with how much money they <span>spent</span>, <span>David</span> <span>began</span> <span>splurging</span> on everything he could think of. <span><br/></span>
🎧 First, he took <span>Melissa</span> <span>shopping</span> for the <span>finest</span> and most <span>beautiful</span> <span>clothes</span> she could <span>dream</span> of. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Then, they took an <span>exotic</span> <span>vacation</span> to the <span>Florida</span> <span>Keys</span>, where they <span>spent</span> a month <span>exploring</span> every <span>island</span> and spending <span>thousands</span> of <span>dollars</span> on the most <span>beautiful</span> <span>hotels</span>, and most <span>delicious</span> <span>foods</span> they could find.<br/>
🎧 When they finally <span>returned</span> home. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Melissa</span> said, Oh, <span>David</span>! Everything is perfect! I'm actually glad we don't have a <span>child</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>David</span> <span>smiled</span>, <span>content</span> with his <span>wife's</span> <span>happiness</span>, and <span>walked</span> over to check their <span>voicemails</span> from when they were away. <span><br/></span>
🎧 The <span>machine</span> <span>bleeped</span> and then their <span>doctor's</span> <span>voice</span> came on saying, Hi <span>guys</span>. Great <span>news</span>!

🎧 <span>Andrea's</span> big day was finally here. <span><br/></span>
🎧 She had been <span>accepted</span> into the <span>medical</span> school of her <span>dream</span> in <span>Boston</span>, and was about to fly there to <span>begin</span> her new life. <span><br/></span>
🎧 She had <span>gotten</span> the <span>news</span> of her <span>acceptance</span> two <span>months</span> ago, but had <span>spent</span> all that time so <span>busy</span> <span>preparing</span> for the move that she hadn't had time to <span>realize</span> how <span>nervous</span> she really was. <span><br/></span>
🎧 It wasn't until it was time for her to get up from the <span>plane</span> <span>seat</span> that she <span>realized</span> her <span>legs</span> were <span>shaking</span>, her <span>heart</span> was <span>racing</span>, and her <span>forehead</span> was <span>sweating</span>.<br/>
🎧 Keep <span>calm</span>! she <span>kept</span> <span>repeating</span> to <span>herself</span> the whole way to her new <span>apartment</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 She had <span>worked</span> so <span>hard</span> to get here, and she <span>knew</span> that she had <span>nothing</span> to be <span>afraid</span> of. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Still, as she <span>looked</span> out of her new <span>living-room</span> <span>window</span>, the <span>world</span> outside <span>looked</span> much too <span>scary</span> to <span>face</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Having <span>grown</span> up on the <span>West</span> <span>Coast</span> her whole life, she was not <span>prepared</span> for how everything <span>looked</span> here. <span><br/></span>
🎧 The <span>warm</span>, <span>bright</span> sun that she was so used to <span>seeing</span> out this time of year was <span>nowhere</span> to be <span>seen</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Everyone's</span> <span>accents</span> <span>seemed</span> <span>completely</span> <span>unfamiliar</span>, and the people even <span>seemed</span> <span>taller</span> than <span>normal</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>decided</span> to <span>stay</span> in the <span>safety</span> of her <span>apartment</span> that <span>night</span> and didn't go outside until it was time for her class the <span>following</span> <span>afternoon</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 As the <span>professor</span> <span>asked</span> some <span>basic</span> <span>questions</span> to see what <span>level</span> everyone was at, <span>Andrea's</span> <span>mind</span> went <span>completely</span> <span>blank</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Oh no! she thought to <span>herself</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 I'm not even <span>supposed</span> to be here! Everyone <span>knows</span> so much more than me. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Just then, the <span>professor</span> <span>pointed</span> at her and <span>asked</span> her a <span>question</span> about the <span>functions</span> of the <span>spinal</span> <span>cord</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 As <span>frightened</span> as she was, the answer was just <span>blurted</span> out of her <span>mouth</span> <span>instinctively</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>Impressive</span>! says the <span>teacher</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 You'll do just great here. she <span>assured</span> her. <span><br/></span>
🎧 As the <span>teacher</span> <span>walked</span> away, one of the <span>pesky</span> <span>giant</span> <span>ants</span> <span>crawled</span> across <span>Andrea's</span> <span>desk</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>Making</span> an <span>appointment</span> to see the <span>dentist</span> is usually one of the <span>smartest</span> <span>decisions</span> a person could make for his or her <span>health</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>However</span>, for <span>Marek</span>, <span>booking</span> his <span>dentist</span> <span>appointment</span> <span>ended</span> up being one of the <span>worst</span> <span>mistakes</span> in his life. <span><br/></span>
🎧 This was because of the <span>fact</span> that the <span>dentist</span> <span>Marek</span> <span>chose</span> to visit was his <span>ex-girlfriend</span> whom he had <span>recently</span> <span>broken</span> up with to be with another <span>woman</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 This <span>silly</span> <span>mistake</span> <span>resulted</span> in <span>Marek</span> <span>walking</span> out of the <span>dentist's</span> <span>office</span> with all the <span>32</span> <span>teeth</span> <span>missing</span>.<br/>
🎧 I didn't have any <span>reason</span> to <span>doubt</span> her, says <span>Marek</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 I mean I thought she was a <span>professional</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 Quite on the <span>contrary</span>, his <span>ex-girlfriend</span> <span>decided</span> that this was the perfect <span>chance</span> to get her <span>revenge</span> for having been <span>heart-broken</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 She gave him a <span>heavy</span> <span>dose</span> of <span>anesthesia</span>, <span>pulled</span> out all of his <span>teeth</span>, and <span>bandaged</span> his whole <span>face</span> up with <span>gauze</span> so that her work wouldn't be <span>noticed</span> until the <span>bandages</span> were all <span>pulled</span> off. <span><br/></span>
🎧 The <span>bandages</span> are to <span>protect</span> your <span>gums</span>, she told <span>Marek</span>, who then <span>left</span> the <span>office</span>, still <span>heavily</span> <span>numbed</span> by the <span>effects</span> of the <span>anesthesia</span>.<br/>
🎧 As the <span>anesthesia</span> <span>wore</span> off on his way home, he could tell something was <span>terribly</span> wrong because he couldn't feel any <span>teeth</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 One can only <span>imagine</span> the <span>panic</span> he must have <span>felt</span> after <span>uncovering</span> his <span>ex's</span> work under all the <span>gauze</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 After <span>reporting</span> the <span>event</span> to the <span>police</span>, his <span>ex</span> is now <span>facing</span> the <span>possibility</span> of <span>three</span> years in <span>prison</span> for a <span>doctor's</span> <span>malpractice</span> <span>suit</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 On the <span>bright</span> side for her, she might be spending those <span>three</span> years behind <span>bars</span> <span>pleased</span> at <span>knowing</span> that her <span>shocking</span> <span>stunt</span> was very <span>effective</span> in <span>terms</span> of getting even with <span>Marek</span>. <span><br/></span>
🎧 After <span>seeing</span> that he no <span>longer</span> had any <span>teeth</span>, his new <span>girlfriend</span> <span>broke</span> up with him.<br/>
