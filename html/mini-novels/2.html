🎧 Bobby loved to eat. <br/>
🎧 He ate hamburgers, French fries, hot dogs, pizza, donuts, and ice-cream, just to name a few. <br/>
🎧 No matter how much Bobby ate, he never got a stomachache. <br/>
🎧 It is no surprise that Bobby weighs two hundred and fifty pounds. <br/>
🎧 It might be surprising to know that Bobby is only fifteen years old. <br/>
🎧 Bobby didn't care that he was big. <br/>
🎧 He was content with how he looked and loved eating as much as he could.<br/>
🎧 Bobby liked to tell jokes to his friends. <br/>
🎧 Knock, knock, Bobby would say. <br/>
🎧 Who's there? friends would ask. <br/>
🎧 Gorilla, Bobby replied. <br/>
🎧 Gorilla who? they'd ask back. <br/>
🎧 Gorilla me a hamburger! Bobby replied, delivering the punch line. <br/>
🎧 The joke was in how the word gorilla sounded like grill. <br/>
🎧 Bobby's joke always left people in stitches.<br/>
🎧 Even though Bobby was popular and friendly, he was still teased by some kids in school. <br/>
🎧 Fat boy Bobby was the nick name the mean kids gave to Bobby. <br/>
🎧 Whenever Bobby heard the nick name, he would reply with gusto, sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me. <br/>
🎧 The bullies would funnily reply, I bet you would eat those sticks and stones, fat boy Bobby! and scurry off running.<br/>
🎧 Bobby did not let idiotic name calling bother him. <br/>
🎧 He had more important things to think about, like what he was going to eat for dinner. <br/>
🎧 Bobby knew that one day he would have to lose weight if he wished to live a longer life. <br/>
🎧 Until that day came, Bobby would continue eating what he wanted and as much he wanted.<br/>

🎧 Jenny is a fifth grader. <br/>
🎧 She is considered one of the most popular girls in her class. <br/>
🎧 She is very pretty, but that is not why she is considered popular. <br/>
🎧 She is popular because she is known to be among the brightest in her class. <br/>
🎧 She can do the most cartwheels in a row, but mostly, she has the talent to dance.<br/>
🎧 Last year, she entered the school's dance competition and won the first place. <br/>
🎧 Her whole class was there to support her. <br/>
🎧 Since that day, she has been the class attraction. <br/>
🎧 This year, the school is holding another dance competition, but there has been a change in this year's competition. <br/>
🎧 The competition has to be done in pairs.<br/>
🎧 Jenny's class was looking up to her with high expectations of her winning again this year. <br/>
🎧 On the other hand, Jenny was unsure of this year's outcome. <br/>
🎧 She wanted to enter the competition, but she had never danced with a partner before. <br/>
🎧 She decided to ask some of the boys in her class to enter with her. <br/>
🎧 They all said no to her because they did not know how to dance. <br/>
🎧 Jenny was becoming hesitant about joining.<br/>
🎧 She finally decided to turn to one of her closest friends, Carl. <br/>
🎧 Jenny and Carl had known each other since the first grade. <br/>
🎧 Carl was reluctant to join at first because he also didn't know how to dance. <br/>
🎧 Jenny insisted. <br/>
🎧 He eventually agreed to join the competition. <br/>
🎧 Jenny was happy and relieved.<br/>
🎧 However, she was still worried because she knew her class was counting on her to win this year's competition.<br/>
🎧 All she needed was some time and practice in order to increase her chances of winning. <br/>
🎧 This time, it was going to be more of a challenge considering the fact that Carl was not a good dancer. <br/>
🎧 The competition was in two months, and only time could predict her chances of winning.<br/>

🎧 After selecting Carl as her partner, Jenny needed to start planning for the dance competition at her school. <br/>
🎧 The competition started in two months. <br/>
🎧 Jenny was aware that Carl was not a great dancer. <br/>
🎧 She had to dedicate some time in helping him improve his skill. <br/>
🎧 On the first few days of preparation, Jenny had planned out their dance routine, with the help of her teacher. <br/>
🎧 They were going to be dancing to Jailhouse Rock by Elvis Presley.<br/>
🎧 Jenny and Carl spent the first two weeks memorizing their steps and cues to their dance. <br/>
🎧 Carl was pretty clumsy at first. <br/>
🎧 He eventually got the hang of it. <br/>
🎧 They spent the rest of the time perfecting their moves. <br/>
🎧 The day of the competition was almost near. <br/>
🎧 Jenny and Carl were beginning to get nervous. <br/>
🎧 They were going up against nine other pairs from the same school.<br/>
🎧 The day of the competition arrived. <br/>
🎧 Carl had not become a great dancer, but had definitely improved since he began. <br/>
🎧 Since Jenny won last year's competition, she was to perform with Carl last. <br/>
🎧 The pairs that were performing this year were better dancers compared to last year's competition. <br/>
🎧 As each pair took the stage one by one, Jenny grew more anxious. <br/>
🎧 Carl noticed this from Jenny and told her, It'll be okay, Jenny. You are great, and I'm sure we'll win. <br/>
🎧 Jenny felt better after hearing Carl's words. <br/>
🎧 Soon, it was their turn to perform. <br/>
🎧 They walked on stage and began to dance as soon as their song started to play.<br/>
🎧 They were off to a great start. <br/>
🎧 Jenny's class was there cheering them on. <br/>
🎧 The crowd began cheering them on as well. <br/>
🎧 Suddenly, Jenny tripped and fell. <br/>
🎧 The crowd was shocked. <br/>
🎧 Carl managed to get Jenny back up on time for their big finale. <br/>
🎧 Jenny was upset because of her fall. <br/>
🎧 After their performance, the judges tallied up the scores and were ready to announce the winner. <br/>
🎧 Jenny and Carl won, but it was a close call. <br/>
🎧 If it wasn't for Jenny's talent and Carl's quick thinking to keep the routine going, they wouldn't have won. <br/>
🎧 They were both awarded with a trophy and medals. <br/>
🎧 Jenny and Carl were full of cheer.<br/>

🎧 It is going to be the best camping trip, which will last three days. <br/>
🎧 While Carlos makes invitations for their friends, George is going to make a list of activities to do while they are there. <br/>
🎧 Last year, their camping trip was not entirely a success. <br/>
🎧 They got a flat tire on the way to their campsite. <br/>
🎧 They also had a bear take some of their food. <br/>
🎧 They don't want to encounter that again.<br/>
🎧 This year, they plan to go prepared. <br/>
🎧 George is going to take a spare tire and gas, just in case they run out. <br/>
🎧 Carlos is going to try and find a better method of storing food without attracting animals to their campsite. <br/>

🎧 On this trip, George and Carlos have invited ten of their friends. <br/>
🎧 Everyone is excited. <br/>
🎧 George has prepared his list of activities to do with his friends.<br/>
🎧 They plan to go mountain climbing, hiking, kayaking, fishing, and to play a few games of flag football. <br/>
🎧 For night activities, they plan to tell stories, sing songs along with George's guitar, and play some board games. <br/>
🎧 Carlos and his friends have pitched in some money for food. <br/>
🎧 With the list Carlos made, they are going to have food, vegetables, chicken, and fruit juice.<br/>
🎧 The day of the camping trip is getting near. <br/>
🎧 George and Carlos cannot wait. <br/>
🎧 When the day comes, George and Carlos double check to see if they have their things ready. <br/>
🎧 At the last minute, George suddenly remembers that it is important to bring matches, lanterns, and flashlights. <br/>
🎧 Carlos also suggests that they take binoculars for sightseeing. <br/>
🎧 They are ready to go. <br/>
🎧 It is going to be the best trip they have ever made.<br/>

🎧 Anna woke up late one morning. <br/>
🎧 She was supposed to meet up with a group of friends that morning at 8 o'clock. <br/>
🎧 She woke up at 8:15 instead. <br/>
🎧 Anna rushed to get ready. <br/>
🎧 She quickly showered, put on her clothes. <br/>
🎧 Then, she grabbed her tool box and headed out on her bike.<br/>
🎧 Anna and her friends were asked to paint two murals for the city's library. <br/>
🎧 One of the murals was to be located on the outside, and the other on the inside. <br/>
🎧 The owner of the library was the one who requested these murals. <br/>
🎧 The reason was because he was a fan of Anna's art, and was planning to remodel the library.<br/>
🎧 Both murals were going to be painted with a similar theme. <br/>
🎧 They were both going to be paintings aimed to inspire people to read. <br/>
🎧 Anna already had her ideas for both murals planned out. <br/>
🎧 It was going to be colorful. <br/>
🎧 Her friends were going be there to help paint the large areas of the mural.<br/>
🎧 Once Anna arrived, she noticed her friends waiting outside the library. <br/>
🎧 Anna apologized for being late. <br/>
🎧 She pulled out her ideas to show to her friends. <br/>
🎧 Her friends were impressed and excited to begin painting. <br/>
🎧 They first started by outlining the images of the ideas onto both walls. <br/>
🎧 Next, they mixed their colors and began to paint. <br/>
🎧 Painting the mural was a lot faster to do when you have the help of your friends. <br/>
🎧 They finished both murals within two days.<br/>
🎧 The new murals attracted the attention of local visitors to the library. <br/>
🎧 The owner of the library was impressed and happy with the new look of his library. <br/>
🎧 He awarded Anna and her friends with recognition and paid them for their labor. <br/>
🎧 Anna was pleased.<br/>

🎧 Two years ago, Amy left her small hometown in England and moved to one of the biggest cities in the United States -- New York. <br/>
🎧 Amy knew the transition would be difficult at first, but was confident that she would love her new life and succeed in becoming a Broadway star. <br/>
🎧 She had envisioned herself getting off the airplane and immediately making new friends with whom she would spend her nights exploring The City That Never Sleeps.<br/>
🎧 Unfortunately, the reality of Amy's situation was far from the perfect life she had imagined. <br/>
🎧 Her days were spent jumping from theatre to theatre looking for auditions. <br/>
🎧 Although she was very pretty, and great at acting, her accent made it difficult for her to get hired for any roles. <br/>
🎧 Directors kept telling her to work on her American accent, but the more she practiced it, the more she sounded like a cowboy rather than a New Yorker.<br/>
🎧 Amy's nights were spent working at a diner in order to pay for her ridiculously expensive one-room apartment where the sinks always leaked and the hot water never worked. <br/>
🎧 To top it all off, the city that she had imagined as being filled with bright lights and friendly faces like in the movies was made up mostly of smelly alleys, big rats, and angry crowds that were always in a hurry to get somewhere. <br/>
🎧 Still, Amy didn't let anything crush her spirits, and was determined to keep working hard until her dreams would come true.<br/>
🎧 Finally one day, Amy was clearing some tables in the diner while singing her favorite song as usual. <br/>
🎧 Excuse me, said a man in a nearby booth. <br/>
🎧 I couldn't help but notice that you have a beautiful voice. Amy blushed and thanked the man. <br/>
🎧 I'm actually casting for a star in my new Broadway musical of Mary Poppins, he continued. <br/>
🎧 How would you feel about acting? Amy's heart raced with excitement just as Frank Sinatra's New York, New York began playing on the diner's jukebox. <br/>
🎧 She was finally going to make it.<br/>

🎧 John is a busy lawyer, whose whole day revolves around two things: work and his two daughters. <br/>
🎧 Balancing the two things often proves to be very difficult, so John spends most of his day in a rush to do everything he needs to do, and get everywhere he needs to be. <br/>
🎧 With such a hectic schedule, it is common to find John and his children in line at a McDonald's drive-thru, waiting for some burgers, fries, and shakes.<br/>
🎧 I know fast food isn't the healthiest thing I could give my daughters, admits John. <br/>
🎧 But it's the most convenient thing around when we're in a rush. Plus, it makes them happy. <br/>
🎧 Unfortunately, this attitude towards the unhealthiness of fast food is one that so many parents in the U.S. hold, and it is easy to understand why.<br/>
🎧 Nowadays, nearly every single city in America is equipped with its own McDonald's. <br/>
🎧 In Los Angeles alone, it can sometimes feel like there is one on every other corner when you're driving around. <br/>
🎧 As if this didn't already make it hard enough for parents to avoid, McDonald's targets their famous Happy Meals to children so that every time they drive by the giant golden arches, children demand to go inside to get a new toy with their meal.<br/>
🎧 Although it may be very hard for parents to have healthier meal options for their children, doing so is a necessity that this country can no longer ignore.<br/>
🎧 Constantly consuming fast food is becoming a norm in American society and is resulting in millions of people suffering from obesity and diabetes for the rest of their lives.<br/>
🎧 Instead of teaching children that it is okay to give in to the temptation of a quick greasy meal, parents should get their children into the habit of healthy eating everywhere they go. <br/>
🎧 In the end, children will be more thankful for living long, healthy, and happy lives, than for getting a cheap toy in a cardboard box.<br/>

🎧 David and Melissa had been a happily married couple for six years. <br/>
🎧 They lived a comfortably modest life in a small apartment and had been saving up for years in preparation for the next giant step in their life: a baby.<br/>
🎧 However, after repeatedly trying to get pregnant for a whole year, they consulted a doctor and received devastating news. <br/>
🎧 Melissa would be unable to conceive a child for the rest of her life.<br/>
🎧 The bad news struck Melissa terribly hard. <br/>
🎧 Seeing his wife in such a distraught and depressed state broke David's heart. <br/>
🎧 Don't worry, he told her. <br/>
🎧 I'm going to make you the happiest woman in the planet, even if it's just the two of us. <br/>
🎧 He then went to the bank, took out all their savings that had been held for the baby, and set out to do whatever he could to cheer his wife up.<br/>
🎧 Since they no longer had to be careful with how much money they spent, David began splurging on everything he could think of. <br/>
🎧 First, he took Melissa shopping for the finest and most beautiful clothes she could dream of. <br/>
🎧 Then, they took an exotic vacation to the Florida Keys, where they spent a month exploring every island and spending thousands of dollars on the most beautiful hotels, and most delicious foods they could find.<br/>
🎧 When they finally returned home. <br/>
🎧 Melissa said, Oh, David! Everything is perfect! I'm actually glad we don't have a child. <br/>
🎧 David smiled, content with his wife's happiness, and walked over to check their voicemails from when they were away. <br/>
🎧 The machine bleeped and then their doctor's voice came on saying, Hi guys. Great news! There was a mistake in the test results. You are actually six weeks pregnant! It's Triplets.<br/>

🎧 Andrea's big day was finally here. <br/>
🎧 She had been accepted into the medical school of her dream in Boston, and was about to fly there to begin her new life. <br/>
🎧 She had gotten the news of her acceptance two months ago, but had spent all that time so busy preparing for the move that she hadn't had time to realize how nervous she really was. <br/>
🎧 It wasn't until it was time for her to get up from the plane seat that she realized her legs were shaking, her heart was racing, and her forehead was sweating.<br/>
🎧 Keep calm! she kept repeating to herself the whole way to her new apartment. <br/>
🎧 She had worked so hard to get here, and she knew that she had nothing to be afraid of. <br/>
🎧 Still, as she looked out of her new living-room window, the world outside looked much too scary to face. <br/>
🎧 Having grown up on the West Coast her whole life, she was not prepared for how everything looked here. <br/>
🎧 The warm, bright sun that she was so used to seeing out this time of year was nowhere to be seen. <br/>
🎧 Everyone's accents seemed completely unfamiliar, and the people even seemed taller than normal.<br/>
🎧 She decided to stay in the safety of her apartment that night and didn't go outside until it was time for her class the following afternoon. <br/>
🎧 As the professor asked some basic questions to see what level everyone was at, Andrea's mind went completely blank. <br/>
🎧 Oh no! she thought to herself. <br/>
🎧 I'm not even supposed to be here! Everyone knows so much more than me. <br/>
🎧 Just then, the professor pointed at her and asked her a question about the functions of the spinal cord. <br/>
🎧 As frightened as she was, the answer was just blurted out of her mouth instinctively. <br/>
🎧 Impressive! says the teacher. <br/>
🎧 You'll do just great here. she assured her. <br/>
🎧 As the teacher walked away, one of the pesky giant ants crawled across Andrea's desk. <br/>
🎧 She quickly flicked it off the edge, and then smiled confidently.<br/>

🎧 Making an appointment to see the dentist is usually one of the smartest decisions a person could make for his or her health. <br/>
🎧 However, for Marek, booking his dentist appointment ended up being one of the worst mistakes in his life. <br/>
🎧 This was because of the fact that the dentist Marek chose to visit was his ex-girlfriend whom he had recently broken up with to be with another woman. <br/>
🎧 This silly mistake resulted in Marek walking out of the dentist's office with all the 32 teeth missing.<br/>
🎧 I didn't have any reason to doubt her, says Marek. <br/>
🎧 I mean I thought she was a professional. <br/>
🎧 Quite on the contrary, his ex-girlfriend decided that this was the perfect chance to get her revenge for having been heart-broken. <br/>
🎧 She gave him a heavy dose of anesthesia, pulled out all of his teeth, and bandaged his whole face up with gauze so that her work wouldn't be noticed until the bandages were all pulled off. <br/>
🎧 The bandages are to protect your gums, she told Marek, who then left the office, still heavily numbed by the effects of the anesthesia.<br/>
🎧 As the anesthesia wore off on his way home, he could tell something was terribly wrong because he couldn't feel any teeth. <br/>
🎧 One can only imagine the panic he must have felt after uncovering his ex's work under all the gauze. <br/>
