🎧 Karen and Betty Robinson were out celebrating their birthdays. <br />
🎧 They were identical twins, and had just turned 30. <br />
🎧 They went out to a baseball game with a couple of friends. <br />
🎧 They all bought themselves beer, and each drank eight beers. <br />
🎧 Karen couldn't drink as much as Betty could, so she had gotten drunk by the fifth beer. <br />
🎧 Karen and Betty knew that they were going to be drinking, so they decided to take the bus to the game. <br />
🎧 Their friends all came on the bus as well.<br />
🎧 When it was time to go home, Karen and Betty got back on the bus with their friends. <br />
🎧 They got to Union Station, and got off to catch their train home. <br />
🎧 They said bye to their friends, and went to catch the train. <br />
🎧 People looked at them weird, because they could tell that they were drunk. <br />
🎧 When they were on the train, Karen began to feel sick. <br />
🎧 Betty looked at her, and started to laugh. <br />
🎧 Karen started to vomit, but she stopped herself. <br />
🎧 She got out of the train, and went running to the bathroom to finish vomiting.<br />
🎧 When they got home, Betty told Karen to drink another beer to calm her stomach. <br />
🎧 Karen agreed and drank it. <br />
🎧 It calmed her down, and then she fell asleep. <br />
🎧 The next day, Karen and Betty woke up sick. <br />
🎧 They couldn't believe how drunk they had gotten. <br />
🎧 They both felt terrible. <br />
🎧 Their stomachs hurt; their heads hurt; they both felt dizzy. <br />
🎧 When Betty got to work, she found a closet and fell asleep. <br />
🎧 When Karen got to work, she went to the restroom and threw up. <br />
🎧 When they both got out of work, they promised themselves that they wouldn't drink like that ever again.<br />

🎧 When Christopher Lee was a young man, he had a dream to become an English professor. <br />
🎧 He worked hard at this by first going to a community college after high school before transferring to the University of California, Los Angeles. <br />
🎧 At UCLA, Chris earned his bachelor's degree in English, but he still needed his Master's degree to teach at college. <br />
🎧 Chris met George while taking a class at his old community college. <br />
🎧 George was a news reporter, who told Chris how much he enjoyed his job. <br />
🎧 Chris became very interested in his story.<br />
🎧 It turned out George was also an English major, but he turned to journalism because he wanted to be published. <br />
🎧 George said to Chris one day, Chris, I've known lots of English majors who want to be published, but never got that chance. In journalism, you can get published, and get published often. <br />
🎧 Chris thought about his words and asked him how he became a journalist. <br />
🎧 George laughed and said, Start with Journalism 101.<br />
🎧 Chris took his advice, and soon he fell in love with writing in journalism style. <br />
🎧 Its short, precise method of writing appealed to Chris. <br />
🎧 Journalists deal only in facts. <br />
🎧 It is not like English writing. <br />
🎧 You don't paint pictures in journalism; you report facts. <br />
🎧 There is a measure of creativity involved with writing in a journalistic style, but it is unlike English.<br />
🎧 Soon, Chris earned his certificate, and went on to earn his Master's degree in journalism. <br />
🎧 He now works for a large, daily newspaper. <br />
🎧 He is very grateful to his old friend George, who introduced him to journalism. <br />
🎧 He has now been published more than 200 times. <br />
🎧 George changed the course of Christopher's life.<br />

🎧 Richard grew up in Los Angeles, California, and had a pretty good life. <br />
🎧 There was food on the table and he had plenty of clothes to wear. <br />
🎧 He didn't really have any needs. <br />
🎧 He went to a good school in a nice area of the city, and had many friends. <br />
🎧 Richard grew up with three older sisters, who also enjoyed their life in California, and had many friends. <br />
🎧 All this was possible because of their father Michael.<br />
🎧 Michael was born into poverty in a small town just outside of Mexico City. <br />
🎧 When Michael was a boy, he remembered times when there was not enough food to eat, or fresh water to drink. <br />
🎧 Whenever he was thirsty, he would go to the river to collect water. <br />
🎧 Michael lived in a hut that had no floor. <br />
🎧 Many times he slept on the dirt, with just a blanket between him and the ground.<br />
🎧 That all changed when, at the age of 17, Michael emigrated to the United States with his family. <br />
🎧 The first few years were almost as difficult as it was in Mexico, but gradually things began getting better for Michael and his family.<br />
🎧 When Michael turned 19, he decided to enroll into a community college. <br />
🎧 His father had always stressed the importance of learning English while they lived in Mexico. <br />
🎧 That talent was very useful to Michael now. <br />
🎧 Soon Michael was bringing home excellent report cards. <br />
🎧 Because of this, he was able to transfer to a university and earned his degree in engineering.<br />
🎧 Michael got a great job that paid well, which allowed him to move into a better part of town, and to help his parents, too. <br />
🎧 He soon had a family of his own. <br />
🎧 When Richard was born, it was the happiest day in Michael's life.<br />

🎧 As a bartender at one of Los Angeles's busiest clubs, Daniel King often saw a lot of weird stuff. <br />
🎧 During the last party he worked, he saw five people throwing up on the dance floor, two fights, and a girl losing her top in front of everyone. <br />
🎧 The weirdest thing that ever happened to Daniel was when a drunken girl asked him to dance. <br />
🎧 He denied at first, but when she came back for another drink, she dragged him to the dance floor.<br />
🎧 Girls had dragged Daniel to the dance floor before, but this time was different. <br />
🎧 The girls that dragged him out before actually knew how to dance, but this girl did not and was drunk. <br />
🎧 She kept jumping up and down. <br />
🎧 Shaking her body and looking at Daniel straight in the eyes. <br />
🎧 She was so drunk that she kept bumping into the other people that were dancing.<br />
🎧 As the music played, the girl kept jumping and dancing. <br />
🎧 She kept yelling to Daniel that she had to go to the restroom, but he couldn't hear her. <br />
🎧 She yelled at Daniel once more and that's when it happened. <br />
🎧 She had an accident on the dance floor. <br />
🎧 Some of her urine actually got on Daniel's shoes. <br />
🎧 After it happened, the girl was so embarrassed that she ran out of the club crying. <br />
🎧 Daniel couldn't believe what had happened. <br />
🎧 He told people to move out of the way, while his friend came over to clean up the dance floor.<br />
🎧 The weird thing about that incident was that the girl came back the next day looking for her cell phone, but she didn't remember Daniel. <br />
🎧 Daniel wanted to go hide, because he thought she would recognize him, but she didn't. <br />
🎧 Daniel decided that he would never go out to dance with another girl while he was working.<br />

🎧 You're a Winner! That's what Helen Green read as she opened an envelope she got in the mail. <br />
🎧 She couldn't believe it. <br />
🎧 She had won. <br />
🎧 Helen's husband Roger came over to see why Helen was screaming and jumping. <br />
🎧 Helen told Roger You're not going to believe it. Your sister entered us in a sweepstakes for a Hawaii vacation, and we won. We won, Roger! <br />
🎧 Roger didn't believe it at first, but then he researched it. <br />
🎧 Well, I guess we're going to Hawaii, honey, he told Helen. <br />
🎧 They both started jumping with joy.<br />
🎧 Helen and Roger arrived at Hawaii, and couldn't believe how beautiful everything looked. <br />
🎧 They had been married for 20 years, but had never had a vacation. <br />
🎧 After they had checked into their hotel room, they decided to go to the beach. <br />
🎧 They met a surfer named William, although he liked to be called Will, who was offering free lessons. <br />
🎧 Seeing that Roger had always wanted to learn how to surf, they decided to go. <br />
🎧 Will explained to Roger how to paddle the surf board, and he taught him how to stand up on it. <br />
🎧 After two hours of training in the sand, Will told Roger that they would go out to the water. <br />
🎧 Roger didn't like that.<br />
🎧 Where are we going? Roger nervously asked. <br />
🎧 Over there, said Will, as he pointed to the ocean. <br />
🎧 He started getting nervous, and started breathing heavy. <br />
🎧 Helen went over to Roger and calmed him down. <br />
🎧 They're probably in their honeymoon, people said as they passed Roger and Helen. <br />
🎧 Roger laughed. <br />
🎧 He finally calmed down. <br />
🎧 He went out to the ocean with Will, and tried to surf. <br />
🎧 Every time he tried to get on the surf board he ended up falling. <br />
🎧 When they got back to the land, Helen hugged Roger and kissed him. <br />
🎧 You did great, honey. I love you, Helen said. <br />
🎧 Roger knew she was lying, but he had never seen Helen smile so greatly. <br />
🎧 He let it go.<br />

🎧 Paul Martin didn't like going to his family reunion. <br />
🎧 He didn't know most of them, and he didn't even like the people he did know. <br />
🎧 Paul had always been a loner. <br />
🎧 He liked doing things alone; he went to the movies alone; he went to concerts alone; he liked to go eat alone. <br />
🎧 So, at the family reunion, it was no surprise to see that Paul was sitting alone at a table where no one was sitting at. <br />
🎧 Occasionally, an aunt or uncle of his would come up to say hello, but none of his cousins ever said hello to him. <br />
🎧 Paul was fine with it; he didn't care, because he didn't like talking to them, either.<br />
🎧 During his last family reunion, Paul decided to play a trick on his cousins. <br />
🎧 His cousins had been playing Nintendo in his uncle's room. <br />
🎧 Paul knew how to turn off all the power in the house. <br />
🎧 He locked the door to his uncle's room, and then went to turn off the power. <br />
🎧 When all the lights turned off, he could hear his cousins begin to yell. <br />
🎧 They were upset because the game was going really well.<br />
🎧 When his cousins tried to leave, they realized that the door was locked. <br />
🎧 They began to yell for help, and Paul started laughing. <br />
🎧 All of his aunts and uncles were outside enjoying the party, so no one could hear the yells. <br />
🎧 Paul went back outside and sat down at a table. <br />
🎧 He was still laughing. <br />
🎧 An hour passed, and his aunt started looking for her son. <br />
🎧 When Paul's cousins were finally set free from the room, they started looking for Paul, because they knew he had locked them in there. <br />
🎧 Paul wasn't worried; he knew they wouldn't do anything. <br />
🎧 He looked at them, laughed, and then went back to listen to music. <br />
🎧 The cousins sat down, and got something to eat. <br />
🎧 They were all mad at Paul.<br />

🎧 It was Sunday, the last time I saw my dog. <br />
🎧 His name is Spot, because his whole body is covered with spots. <br />
🎧 He is a good dog. <br />
🎧 He never bites, and almost never barks. <br />
🎧 I got Spot when I was around 9 years old. <br />
🎧 All of my friends knew that Spot was like my best friend. <br />
🎧 So, when I told everyone that Spot had gotten lost, they all came out trying to help out. <br />
🎧 We looked for hours.<br />
🎧 My dad told me that maybe Spot got picked up by a dog catcher. <br />
🎧 If that was true, then he would be at the dog pound, which is where they send all the dogs that get lost. <br />
🎧 My friend Mark told me that they put pictures of all the dogs they find in the street online, so I went online to try. <br />
🎧 I spent more than an hour checking the online pictures of the dogs, and finally found my Spot. <br />
🎧 I started jumping with joy.<br />
🎧 I went with my mom and dad to pick up Spot. <br />
🎧 When we got there, he started barking and running in circles all around his cage. <br />
🎧 I knew he was happy to see us. <br />
🎧 He had been lost for about two weeks. <br />
🎧 When we got him home, he ran around the backyard and ran directly into his little house my dad and I built for him. <br />
🎧 He started barking really loudly, which is weird for Spot. <br />
🎧 As soon as my sister heard Spot, she came running out to try and catch him. <br />
🎧 He ran around her and then let himself be captured. <br />
🎧 I think he just wanted to be petted. <br />
🎧 I knew he was happy to be back home and even happier when I brought out his food. <br />
🎧 I hope Spot never gets lost again.<br />

🎧 Edward Allen always hated living in Los Angeles. <br />
🎧 Everything was too expensive; traffic was always bad; people were not friendly; it was always crowded. <br />
🎧 Edward never wanted to live in a big city. <br />
🎧 He always wanted to live somewhere in the country, in a small town, where everyone knew everyone. <br />
🎧 It was a dream that he was dedicated to achieving.<br />
🎧 The day after his 26th birthday, he called his friend Lisa, who had moved to a small town in Iowa. <br />

🎧 They supported his decision and helped him pack his things. <br />
🎧 He would leave in a week.<br />
🎧 Lisa had helped Edward get a job where she worked, and she told Edward he could stay with her and her roommate until he got back on his feet. <br />
🎧 Edward was grateful. <br />
🎧 When he showed up, he immediately started working. <br />
🎧 He liked his job, but he found it a bit boring at times. <br />
🎧 He was a waiter at a cafe. <br />
🎧 He liked the pie at the restaurant, so it wasn't all bad.<br />
🎧 After he had been working for two months, he told Lisa that he couldn't handle it anymore. <br />
🎧 He wanted to go back to the city. <br />
🎧 Lisa laughed and said, You have always hated the city, but now you're running back to it? I don't get you, Edward. <br />
🎧 Edward didn't think living in a small town would be so boring. <br />
🎧 The boredom alone will drive me insane, Lisa, Edward said as he started packing his things.<br />

🎧 For the past month Mark King had been receiving flyers in the mail about a new superstore that was opening up in his neighborhood. <br />
🎧 The flyers confused him. <br />
🎧 He had never heard the term superstore before. <br />
🎧 Later on, he found out that a superstore is a large retail store that sells a variety of products, usually at discount prices. <br />
🎧 Sometimes superstores are also called big box stores. <br />
🎧 Many times they are chain stores owned by one company.<br />
🎧 The flyers all had different messages about the superstore opening. <br />
🎧 One set of flyers invited him and others to apply for jobs at the store. <br />
🎧 The jobs paid well and even offered some benefits. <br />
🎧 Mark thought this was a good thing since he knew many people were looking for work. <br />
🎧 Another set of flyers included coupons to be used on opening day. <br />
🎧 The store had many bargains for common items like paper towels, but also for big screen televisions. <br />
🎧 Mark thought this too was a good thing. <br />
🎧 It seemed like a good idea to be able to get a variety of things in one place instead of going from one store to another. <br />
🎧 It would save time and money. <br />
🎧 Superstores could sell groceries and clothes under one roof.<br />
🎧 Another set of flyers contradicted the positive messages about the superstore though. <br />
🎧 Some local residents were organizing a protest of the superstore. <br />
🎧 The flyers said that the superstore was bad for the community because it threatened the business of smaller stores in the area. <br />
🎧 Mark thought about Mr. Hernandez who owned a small grocery store down the block. <br />
🎧 That was where Mark bought staple food items like eggs and milk. <br />
