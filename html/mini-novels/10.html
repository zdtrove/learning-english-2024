🎧 William Moore didn't trust the idea of marriage. <br />
🎧 He came from a broken family. <br />
🎧 His mother and father divorced when he was only 10 years old. <br />
🎧 Both of his two brothers had been married twice; each marriage ended in divorce. <br />
🎧 Marriage is the end, William always said. <br />
🎧 His view on marriage always got in the way of his relationships. <br />
🎧 He would go out on dates with women who would always be looking for something serious. <br />
🎧 William wasn't looking for that. <br />
🎧 He wanted someone to have fun with and that was all.<br />
🎧 William hadn't found someone he felt strongly about in a long time. <br />
🎧 The last time he truly felt something for a girl was during his last year of college. <br />
🎧 Her name was Linda. <br />
🎧 Linda was in William's math class, and she always helped William with his homework. <br />
🎧 They started hanging out after school, and going on dates every week. <br />
🎧 When William told Linda about his views on marriage, she didn't get scared. <br />
🎧 In fact, she liked the idea. <br />
🎧 It's a lot of pressure. A lot of guys think that women just want marriage, you know, I don't. At least not right now, Linda said.<br />
🎧 William decided to give Linda a chance. <br />
🎧 He liked her. <br />
🎧 They had the same view on marriage. <br />
🎧 Yet, during the final month of school, Linda got an email that changed her life. <br />
🎧 She got a chance to go study in Europe. <br />
🎧 William didn't want Linda to go. <br />
🎧 Linda said that it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. <br />
🎧 William even thought about proposing to Linda to see if she would stay, but he knew that she would not change her mind. <br />
🎧 He let her go. <br />
🎧 It made William sad. <br />
🎧 He didn't know if he wanted marriage, but he really wanted to have someone there for him.<br />

🎧 My last class of the day was my physical education class. <br />
🎧 I always hated it. <br />
🎧 For the past three years, people had found ways to embarrass me. <br />
🎧 Things weren't so bad at first. <br />
🎧 A basketball hit me in the head when I was talking to a girl. <br />
🎧 I was trying to climb the big rope in the gym and fell down in front of everyone, who started laughing. <br />
🎧 However, the worst thing was yet to happen.<br />
🎧 At the end of a year, we always have a test to see how we have improved. <br />
🎧 We have to run a mile. <br />
🎧 The whole class does this at the same time. <br />
🎧 I wasn't the fastest runner, but I knew I could get a good score for this test. <br />
🎧 For this activity, we have to go into the locker room and change into our uniform. <br />
🎧 I left my uniform in my locker the other day since it was clean. <br />
🎧 When I opened my locker, I saw a note saying, Buy new uniform, loser. <br />
🎧 Someone had broken into my locker and took my clothes. <br />
🎧 I told the teacher, who went into his office and gave me an old uniform that had been left behind. <br />
🎧 Suit up and I'll see you out there, he said.<br />
🎧 I tried tying a rope around the shorts to make them fit, but they wouldn't. <br />
🎧 The bell rang, and I knew my teacher would be mad if I didn't get out there. <br />
🎧 I started running, and barely got there before he started calling names. <br />
🎧 After he finished with the roll call, we started the test. <br />
🎧 The whole class set off running. <br />
🎧 I was doing okay at the beginning. <br />
🎧 After a while, people started passing me. <br />
🎧 A lot of people laughed at my shorts. <br />
🎧 Then it happened. <br />
🎧 One guy pushed me out of his way, and I ended up falling. <br />
🎧 My shorts fell first, and then I fell to the ground. <br />
🎧 That was when all the girls started passing me. <br />
🎧 One of them shouted, Ew, he doesn't have clean underwear. <br />
🎧 I picked up my shorts, and walked the rest of the mile. <br />
🎧 It was the most embarrassing moment in my life.<br />

🎧 Robert Garcia always wanted to play baseball. <br />
🎧 He was small and weak, but he loved playing the game. <br />
🎧 Robert told his dad that he wanted to play baseball, but he felt that he was too weak to get into the school baseball team. <br />
🎧 Robert's dad looked at him and said, Son, strength doesn't come from muscles. You never know what you can do till you try. Go out there and try it. You have to take a chance.<br />
🎧 Robert was inspired. <br />
🎧 He went to the tryouts at school the next day. <br />
🎧 Even though Robert was the smallest person at the tryouts, he didn't give up. <br />

🎧 I'm here to tryout, coach, Robert said. <br />

🎧 Okay, let's see what you got, the coach said. <br />
🎧 He gave him a bat. <br />
🎧 Robert stepped up to bat. <br />
🎧 The pitcher threw the ball, and Robert swung as hard as he could. <br />
🎧 After he opened his eyes, Robert noticed that he had missed the ball. <br />

🎧 Robert couldn't take it anymore. <br />
🎧 He started running home. <br />
🎧 The coach saw Robert start running and couldn't believe how fast he was running. <br />
🎧 Robert was running faster than the team's fastest player. <br />
🎧 The coach told his assistant, Go to the office and get me the home number for that kid. <br />
🎧 Robert got home, and his dad told him the good news. <br />
🎧 He had gotten on the team. <br />
🎧 Robert couldn't believe it. <br />
🎧 He heard the coach's message, Sorry, for not believing in you, Speedy. Welcome to the team.<br />

🎧 Kevin Turner was a trusting guy, but his girlfriend Carol Adams wasn't so trusting. <br />
🎧 Whenever Kevin wanted to hang out with his friends, Carol would look at him and say, Who are you really seeing? <br />
🎧 At first Kevin took it as a joke, but soon Carol started getting carried away with it. <br />

🎧 One of the favorite American holidays is Christmas. <br />
🎧 The holiday has a special meaning to most Americans today. <br />
🎧 It is an official government holiday celebrated on December 25. <br />
🎧 Most Americans get both Christmas Day and Christmas Eve off from their jobs so that they can spend time with their families. <br />
🎧 Many people are busy buying gifts for their loved ones in preparation for the big day. <br />
🎧 Christmas day is the time when families open presents that they have given each other. <br />
🎧 The presents are wrapped in beautiful paper, and usually include a colorful bow and a tag with a person's name on it. <br />
🎧 These presents are placed under a tree that is brought into their home and decorated with bright ornaments by the entire family.<br />
🎧 When Michelle was a little girl, she loved helping her mom and dad decorate the Christmas tree. <br />

🎧 Families can walk through the lots to pick the tree that is right for them. <br />
🎧 Michelle loved going to shop for a tree because of the sweet aroma that would come from the trees. <br />
🎧 I like this one, daddy, Michelle said. <br />
🎧 It's perfect, her dad agreed and bought the tree. <br />
🎧 It was just the right size, with full, green branches.<br />
🎧 Once the tree was brought home, Michelle helped her mother place the tree in the right spot, and began decorating it. <br />
🎧 Her brothers and sister would help, too. <br />
🎧 This was always a great family tradition. <br />
🎧 They put a string of flickering lights around the tree, along with pretty ornaments of different kinds. <br />
🎧 Each family member got to place their own special ornament on the tree right where they wanted to. <br />
🎧 The colors blue, red, yellow, and red would blink on and off and would shine brightly, reflecting off the ornaments. <br />
🎧 As the family stood and viewed the decorated tree, all were smiling. <br />
🎧 Michelle turned to her father and said, Thank you, daddy.<br />

🎧 Steven Baker loves his car. He owns a beautiful 1977 Chevrolet Corvette that he bought many years ago. <br />
🎧 Steve, as he is known to his friends, got a great deal on the car. <br />
🎧 He bought it from a guy who was the original owner. <br />
🎧 This is the best possible situation a used car buyer can find. <br />
🎧 The car culture in California is unique. <br />
🎧 Detroit automakers look to California for trends to include into their car designs. <br />
🎧 Many people in California like lower cars, which make them look sleeker and more streamline. <br />
🎧 This comes from the practice of cruising the boulevard, an activity that is very popular among people of all ages, especially in Southern California.<br />
🎧 It was Saturday night in August. <br />
🎧 Steve gave me a call to see what I was doing that night. <br />
🎧 Hey, let's go cruising, brother, said Steve. <br />
🎧 And of course I said yes. <br />
🎧 I loved cruising in his car. <br />
🎧 The girls loved that car. <br />
🎧 It was a two-seater with a T-top roof that is removable. <br />
🎧 That night we cruised Van Nuys Blvd., a popular street where lots of young people like cruising. <br />
🎧 This is where guys can meet girls and vice versa. <br />
🎧 It wasn't long before we spotted a car load of girls in an old Ford Thunderbird. <br />
🎧 Hey! I shouted to the girls as we came up near them. <br />
🎧 Anyone want to cruise with us? I said, and to my surprise a couple of young blondes jumped in and we drove away. <br />
🎧 It was a tight fit, but the girls were small and thin. <br />
🎧 I was in heaven! <br />
🎧 Before long, I was dating one of them, and Steve dated the other.<br />
🎧 We went on a few double dates after that, but Steve and his folks moved away one year later and I never heard from him again. <br />
🎧 That was a sad day in my life, but at least I had a new girlfriend, thanks to him and his 1977 Corvette!<br />

🎧 Laura loved to go to the beach, so she said she would be happy to. <br />
🎧 Santa Monica beach is one of the most beautiful beaches in California. <br />
🎧 There are more scenic views on the coastline up and down the state, but many are inaccessible to beachgoers. <br />
🎧 Santa Monica has a very large beach area that features white sand and lots of room to play. <br />
🎧 Carol liked to toss a Frisbee around with her friends and to play volleyball.<br />
🎧 Do you want to play volleyball, Laura, Carol asked when they got there. <br />
🎧 Sure, said Laura, but who are we going to play with? It takes more than two people to play. <br />
🎧 Carol thought about it, and said that they should start playing and others will join in, so the two girls started playing alone. <br />
🎧 Just as Carol said, more kids came over and wanted to play with them. <br />
🎧 Soon they had more than enough people for a game, and they played for hours.<br />
🎧 After the game, the girls wanted to cool off, so they decided to jump into the ocean for a little relief. <br />
🎧 The water was crowded, but that just added to the fun. <br />
🎧 It was cool and wet, and the waves were just right. <br />
🎧 Some people were surfing both on surfboards and body boards, while others were swimming out to the buoys. <br />
🎧 On the coastline, two girls were digging for sea shells and one man was using his metal detector to find hidden treasure. <br />
🎧 Carol ran up to the man and asked him what he was looking for. <br />
🎧 He said: Anything I can find, young lady.' <br />
🎧 Carol laughed and asked him if she could try. <br />
🎧 Sure. Why not? said the man. <br />
🎧 So Carol started scanning the beach and soon found a necklace, whcih the man let her keep. <br />
🎧 Why not, said the man. <br />
🎧 You found it. Carol was very happy and ran to tell Laura.<br />
