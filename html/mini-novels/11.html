🎧 Little Tommy had been bugging his parents to teach him how to swim. <br />
🎧 He was only six years old, but he wanted to learn ever since watching the London Summer Olympics. <br />
🎧 He was only four years old at the time, but he remembers watching Michael Phelps win six gold medals, and wanted to be just like him. <br />
🎧 Tommy's parents thought he was too young at the time, but decided the time was right to give him lessons.<br />
🎧 Many homes in the United States have swimming pools, but Tommy's did not. <br />
🎧 His parents lived in a condominium, which is like an apartment complex. <br />
🎧 So Tommy's parents took him to the local YMCA to enroll him into swimming classes. <br />
🎧 This place is big, said Tommy. <br />
🎧 Everyone is so big and strong. <br />
🎧 Tommy was just a kid, but he was determined to learn how to swim.<br />
🎧 When the family reached the pool, Tommy's jaw almost dropped to the floor. <br />
🎧 He was amazed at the size of the pool. <br />
🎧 He had never seen anything so large in his life. <br />
🎧 It was an Olympic-sized pool and there were many swimmers doing laps while others were just playing around, or diving off the three diving boards. <br />
🎧 Tommy got even more excited.<br />
🎧 Off to the left, there were a group of kids about Tommy's age, who were already in a swimming class. <br />
🎧 Some of the younger kids were crying, but that was okay with Tommy. <br />
🎧 He was not afraid though. <br />
🎧 He was determined to learn how to swim.<br />

🎧 Mary always loved dancing. <br />
🎧 She especially loved dancing different styles from across Latin America. <br />
🎧 In college she took classes to learn mambo and cha-cha, both dances were originally from Cuba. <br />
🎧 Her friends from the Dominican Republic showed Mary how to dance merengue and bachata. <br />
🎧 A Puerto Rican friend held a salsa dancing party in her house. <br />
🎧 Before then Mary always just thought salsa was something you ate on tacos or with nachos. <br />
🎧 She had no idea it was also the name of a dance style. <br />
🎧 One dance style that Mary had yet to try was tango from Argentina.<br />
🎧 Tango seemed so complicated to Mary. <br />
🎧 The footwork was very intricate. <br />
🎧 She imagined she would end up stepping on her partner's feet. <br />
🎧 Mary hadn't had a tango partner yet. <br />
🎧 She didn't have a dance partner in general. <br />
🎧 In classes, instructors always paired her up with fellow classmates. <br />
🎧 At dance clubs it was easy to find a dance partner. <br />
🎧 Tango classes were expensive though. <br />
🎧 Mary didn't even think there were any tango clubs.<br />
🎧 One day Mary received an email from a friend with information about a tango night outside the city's music center. <br />
🎧 Musicians would be playing tango music and instructors would teach the basic steps. <br />
🎧 The best of all, the event was free and no partner was required.<br />
🎧 On the night of the tango event, Mary wore her high-heeled dancing shoes. <br />
🎧 There was a wooden dance floor in the middle of the music center plaza. <br />
🎧 A group of musicians played on a small stage in front of the dance floor. <br />
🎧 May I have this dance? a man asked Mary when she arrived. <br />
🎧 He wore a sticker with the words dance instructor on it. <br />
🎧 Mary accepted the invitation to dance. <br />
🎧 That night Mary learned that it did take two to tango.<br />

🎧 When James divorced his wife Patricia, he moved out of the house they bought together. <br />
🎧 James and Patricia shared custody of their teenager son Robert. <br />
🎧 Robert would stay with his father four days a week, from Thursday through Sunday. <br />
🎧 At first James didn't mind leaving behind the family dog Spot. <br />
🎧 James and Patricia bought the dog when Robert was just a three-year-old toddler. <br />
🎧 Not having to take care of Spot meant James didn't have to worry about cleaning up after the dog, and budgeting for dog food and treats. <br />
🎧 James also didn't have to worry about taking the dog to the vet and the expensive vet bills.<br />
🎧 Two years after James divorced Patricia, he remarried. <br />
🎧 His new wife Linda had two daughters. <br />
🎧 The two daughters got along well with James's son Robert. <br />
🎧 The two daughters had never had a pet though. <br />
🎧 One of them was very allergic to cats and Linda was not an animal person. <br />
🎧 She thought they were too much work and required too much attention. <br />
🎧 Her daughters really wanted a pet though.<br />
🎧 James had an idea. <br />
🎧 Just like he shared custody of Robert with his ex-wife, what if he shared custody of the dog Spot. <br />
🎧 James could bring the dog to the house when he picked up James every Thursday and bring the dog back to his ex-wife's house on Sunday. <br />
🎧 Linda thought it was an interesting idea and agreed to try it. <br />
🎧 James's ex-wife Patricia really liked the idea. <br />
🎧 It gave her a break from having to take care of Spot. <br />
🎧 Robert was really happy because he didn't have to leave his dog behind, and his best animal friend could be with him all the time. <br />
🎧 Linda's daughters were especially happy to have a part-time pet. <br />
🎧 Now we have a step brother and a step pet! they said.<br />

🎧 Nancy was ready to get a cell phone. <br />
🎧 She had never had one before. <br />
🎧 She thought that they were too expensive. <br />
🎧 She worried about the cost of the phone itself. <br />
🎧 She worried about the monthly bill she had to pay. <br />
🎧 Nancy's credit rating wasn't so good because she had a student loan she was paying off. <br />
🎧 Nancy heard that cell phone companies rejecting people because they had poor credit. <br />
🎧 However, she needed a phone. <br />
🎧 She wanted people to be able to get in touch with her no matter where she was; she wanted to have a cell phone in case of an emergency, so she decided to go to a local cell phone company store and see if they would work with her.<br />
🎧 The clerk at the cell phone store was very helpful. <br />
🎧 He was willing to work with Nancy to find a cell phone plan that worked with her budget. <br />
🎧 He checked Nancy's credit and found out that her credit rating was not very high. <br />
🎧 He told Nancy that this didn't mean she couldn't have a cell phone. <br />
🎧 Nancy could get a no-contract or pre-paid cell phone. <br />
🎧 The clerk explained to Nancy that her credit would not be checked, and she wouldn't have to sign a contract that tied her to a specific phone or service. <br />
🎧 With a pre-paid phone, she would pay the same amount of money every month. <br />
🎧 The cost depended on how many minutes she wanted to be able to talk, how much text messaging she planned on doing, and if she was going to use the phone to access the Internet. <br />
🎧 A pre-paid phone plan meant that Nancy would not get a special deal on a phone though. <br />
🎧 She would have to pay full price and no special discounts would apply. <br />
🎧 Nancy had some choices to make.<br />

🎧 It was a hot summer day in Los Angeles. <br />
🎧 The temperature for the day was about 95 degrees Fahrenheit. <br />

🎧 Today, her friends were riding their bikes up and down the street. <br />

🎧 Bobby was getting tired and Joey was able to pass him. <br />
🎧 Suzie was having fun watching them when her mother came outside and asked her what she was doing. <br />
🎧 I'm watching the boys ride their bicycles, Mommy, she said. <br />
🎧 Then Suzie asked her mom if she could teach her how to ride. <br />
🎧 Her mom thought about it for a while. <br />
🎧 She was thinking that Suzie might be too young to learn how to ride, but in the end, she thought it was time for her to learn.<br />
🎧 Suzie was only four years old at the time. <br />
🎧 She was a little scared at first, but she loved the bike her mother had bought her and was very excited. <br />
🎧 Her mom held onto the bike as Suzie slowly started to peddle. <br />
🎧 She gained speed and was having fun when she fell on the sidewalk scraping her knee. <br />
🎧 Suzie began to cry from the pain, but her mom told her she was okay. <br />
🎧 After a few minutes, Suzie stopped crying and got back on her bike and started peddling again. <br />
🎧 She fell a few more times, but didn't cry much after that. <br />
🎧 She just kept getting up and tried again and again. <br />
🎧 Suzie was learning how to keep her balance and was riding along when she noticed that her mother wasn't holding the bike anymore. <br />
🎧 She got scared, but soon realized she could ride a bike all by herself. <br />

🎧 Barbara dropped out of college 17 years ago when she had her first daughter. <br />
🎧 She always regretted dropping out. <br />
🎧 She had been a good student, and enjoyed going to classes in college. <br />
🎧 However, when she had her daughter, she didn't have time to continue with her studies. <br />
🎧 She needed to find a full-time job.<br />
🎧 Barbara also regretted dropping out of college because it was hard to find a good job without a college degree. <br />
🎧 While Barbara was lucky enough to always find work, some of the jobs she had didn't pay well. <br />
🎧 Most of them didn't offer benefits like vacation pay and health insurance. <br />
🎧 Barbara was sure that if she had a college degree, finding a better-paying job with benefits would be easier.<br />
🎧 Barbara's daughter was now a teenager. <br />
🎧 She was beginning to look at colleges. <br />
🎧 This inspired Barbara to go back to school herself. <br />
🎧 Barbara wanted to finally get her bachelor's degree. <br />
🎧 Since her daughter was in high school, Barbara had more time. <br />
🎧 She didn't have to constantly watch over her daughter. <br />
🎧 However, even as a teenager, Barbara's daughter still needed to eat and needed clothes, so going to college on a regular schedule was not an option for Barbara.<br />
🎧 Barbara went to the local community college to learn about her options. <br />
🎧 A college counselor told her that she could take online classes to finish her degree. <br />
🎧 Barbara was worried that these classes wouldn't give the same credit as a traditional college class would. <br />
🎧 The counselor told her the credits were the same, and online classes were good for non-traditional students like her. <br />
🎧 Barbara enrolled and became a student again.<br />
