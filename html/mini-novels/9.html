🎧 I was 10 years old when we first got a computer. <br />
🎧 I didn't know what to do with it, so I just played video games on it. <br />
🎧 My brother was six years older than me, so he would use the computer to go into chat rooms. <br />
🎧 After we had had the computer for around a year, I noticed my brother would always be in chat rooms. <br />
🎧 He would always have a private message open as well. <br />
🎧 It took me another year to realize that my brother was dating someone online.<br />
🎧 I always knew my brother's girlfriend as SnowBunny85, because he never told us officially that she was his girlfriend. <br />
🎧 I later found out her name was Lily. <br />
🎧 My brother always tried to be careful not to leave any pictures Lily sent him on the desktop of the computer, but sometimes he would. <br />
🎧 She looked pretty. <br />
🎧 I didn't understand why my brother wanted, or felt that he needed to keep his relationship secret.<br />
🎧 A few years later, my brother told me that he had broken up with a girlfriend he had. <br />
🎧 I asked why, but he didn't want to talk about it. <br />
🎧 I found out what really happened one day while I was using the computer. <br />
🎧 My brother had saved his last conversation with Lily. <br />
🎧 It seemed like Lily had lied to my brother. <br />
🎧 They had met a couple of times in real life, and they seemed to have had a real relationship. <br />
🎧 The only problem was that Lily already had a husband. <br />
🎧 My brother was crushed to find out that she was married. <br />
🎧 On that day I realized that an online relationship is risky. <br />
🎧 It's up to you to find someone that you can trust and hopefully isn't lying to you. <br />
🎧 I hope my brother realized that, too.<br />

🎧 Friends make life easier, or at least they should. <br />
🎧 My best friend's name is Susan. <br />
🎧 I call her Suzy. <br />
🎧 Suzy and I would always hang out together. <br />
🎧 Just to clarify, my name is Michael. <br />
🎧 Yes, I am a boy, and Susan is a girl. <br />
🎧 Everyone that knew us always thought we were in a relationship, but that wasn't the case. <br />
🎧 I loved Suzy like a sister, and she loved me like a brother. <br />
🎧 Well, I used to think she did.<br />
🎧 It all started when Suzy got a boyfriend. <br />
🎧 I was happy for her, because she was sad and lonely. <br />
🎧 Those were her words, not mine. <br />
🎧 When she introduced me to Richard, her boyfriend, I tried my best to get along with him. <br />
🎧 Although I tried my best, Richard didn't seem to like me. <br />
🎧 Maybe his friends told him that Suzy and I were always hanging around, and they thought we were secretly in love with each other.<br />
🎧 Richard became increasingly jealous whenever my name was mentioned. <br />
🎧 It started tearing up their relationship. <br />
🎧 Suzy began to stay away from me. <br />
🎧 I would call her, go over to her house, or wait for her outside of school, but she was always busy with Richard. <br />
🎧 She would say, Sorry, Mike. I'll call you when I get home, okay? I knew it was a lie. <br />
🎧 Suzy and I haven't spoken in a month. <br />
🎧 As I knew Suzy had always wanted to go to Las Vegas, so I was going to surprise Suzy by telling her that I was going to take her. <br />
🎧 However, it seemed that the ship had sailed. <br />
🎧 I heard Suzy and Richard were going to Las Vegas for her birthday.<br />
🎧 I'm moving on, and I'm hanging out with some other friends. <br />
🎧 It's not the same, but I guess anyone who chooses a relationship over a friendship was never a good friend to begin with. <br />
🎧 Yet, I find myself questioning What are Friends?<br />

🎧 It was a stupid mistake. <br />
🎧 Before I tell you about my mistake, I have to tell you about my father. <br />
🎧 My father Joseph Thomas was a big name in the music business. <br />
🎧 He managed a lot of different rock bands in the '60s. <br />
🎧 By the end of his career, he had saved up some money and decided to buy himself a cabin in a little town in Oregon. <br />
🎧 He didn't want to live in Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago, or any other big cities. <br />
🎧 He wanted to escape the big city life.<br />
🎧 It was a stupid mistake. <br />

🎧 He didn't want to live in Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago, or any other big cities. <br />
🎧 He wanted to escape the big city life.<br />
🎧 During his time in the music industry, my father had collected various objects. <br />
🎧 He had different items from different artists. <br />
🎧 He had one of Jimi Hendrix's guitars, and a medallion that Janis Joplin had given him. <br />
🎧 Did I know this? <br />
🎧 No, I didn't. <br />
🎧 My dad always kept to himself. <br />
🎧 He was out on the road a lot, and he never really cared about keeping in touch with his kids. <br />
🎧 So, when he died, I figured all of his stuff at the cabin would be garbage. <br />
🎧 I told the town's Sheriff to throw everything out. <br />
🎧 I also told him to send me the paperwork for the cabin. <br />
🎧 I read about the discovery they made in my father's cabin. <br />
🎧 I couldn't believe it! <br />
🎧 Hendrix's guitar sold for over a million dollars, and so did the medallion. <br />
🎧 As I had already asked the Shariff to throw out everything as garbage, I wasn't entitled to anything, which probably made my father happy.<br />

🎧 My first road trip was horrible. <br />
🎧 When I turned 24 years old, my father lent me his car to go from Los Angeles to Chicago. <br />
🎧 I told my dad that my friend George was going with me, and he was bringing his girlfriend Nancy. <br />
🎧 My dad liked that George was going, because he was a responsible young adult, which made me think that my dad doesn't think of me as an adult. <br />
🎧 When the day we were scheduled to leave arrived, George's girlfriend didn't arrive at my house until 5 p.m. when we agreed we would meet at 2 p.m.<br />
🎧 It wasn't bad. <br />
🎧 I had been waiting for this road trip for a year. <br />
🎧 I could wait a little longer. <br />
🎧 When Nancy arrived, we packed up her suitcase and hit the road. <br />
🎧 I was friends with both of them, but George was my friend first. <br />
🎧 I started getting annoyed with them right away. <br />
🎧 Even though I had my music playing in the car, I could still hear them in the back kissing and calling each other baby, sweetie, sweetheart, and other nauseating cute names. <br />
🎧 I didn't like it, but what was I going to do?<br />
🎧 George took over the wheel after we left California. <br />
🎧 He was talking to Nancy the whole time. <br />
🎧 When we got near the Grand Canyon, Nancy started talking about how she always wanted to go see it. <br />
🎧 That was when George said those seven words I hated the most, What my baby wants, my baby gets. <br />
🎧 He started going down a road that led to the Grand Canyon without even asking me. <br />
🎧 I started to get really annoyed, but decided not to say anything. <br />
🎧 It was really late, but they didn't care. <br />
🎧 It turned out the road that led to the Grand Canyon closed after a certain time. <br />
🎧 Nancy felt embarrassed, and George started apologizing to me. <br />
🎧 After we got back on the highway, I drove all the way to Chicago. <br />
🎧 George knew that I was bugged, so he tried to keep me company. <br />
🎧 He even told Nancy to sit in the back, which she did. <br />
🎧 It was a horrible drive. <br />
🎧 I couldn't believe I had to drive all the way back to Los Angeles with them.<br />

🎧 One of the most important lessons you should learn is when you drink, you shouldn't drive. <br />
🎧 I learned this the hard way. <br />
🎧 Last year, I got a DUI, which means Driving Under the Influence. <br />
🎧 If you get pulled over and you smell like alcohol, the police will ask you to take a breathalyzer test. <br />
🎧 When you do the test, you have to blow really hard into a machine, which will then tell you if you are over the limit to drive a vehicle. <br />
🎧 The limit is usually .08 blood alcohol volume. <br />
🎧 So, if you pass that, you are going to jail.<br />
🎧 Even though you won't go to jail for a long time, you will be suffering the consequences of your mistake for a long time. <br />
🎧 Here is a list of the things you will have to do if you get a DUI: go to court, go to alcohol education classes, go to Alcoholics Anonymous, pay a lot of money in fines. <br />
🎧 If you don't want to pay, you will have to do community service. <br />
🎧 I got my DUI almost two year ago, and I am still suffering the consequences. <br />
🎧 I still have 56 hours for community service.<br />
🎧 I have to update my insurance policy, and deal with the Department of Motor Vehicles. <br />
🎧 You waste a lot of time and money. <br />
🎧 It gets difficult to get a job, because you have to let your future employer know that you have been arrested. <br />
🎧 It's not worth it. <br />
🎧 If you are thinking about going out to celebrate and party with friends and family, do one of the following: get a designated driver, take the bus or train, or call a cab. <br />
🎧 It may cost you a little bit of money, but compared to how much money you will lose if you get a DUI, it's nothing. Don't drink and drive.<br />

🎧 When a movie is going to premiere, the theater will usually show the film during a midnight screening. <br />
🎧 Anthony Baker and his girlfriend Linda Moore love going to see new movies at midnight. <br />
🎧 A lot of people usually show up early to make line. <br />
🎧 Anthony likes going to stand in line and talk to different people that are in the line. <br />
🎧 Anthony told Linda about the new movie that was coming out. <br />
🎧 Linda went online to buy the tickets. <br />
🎧 She wanted to make sure that they would get tickets.<br />
🎧 Linda got an email from the theater. <br />
🎧 It said that she could pick up the tickets at the theater. <br />
🎧 Anthony took Linda out to eat before they went to the theater to wait in line. <br />
🎧 Anthony was excited because the movie they were going to see was the sequel to one of Anthony's favorite movies. <br />
🎧 When they got to the theater, Anthony and Linda went to the back of the line and started talking to the people in the back. <br />
🎧 They all seemed friendly, and some of them actually knew Anthony and Linda.<br />
🎧 After about an hour of waiting in line, the theater started letting people in. <br />
🎧 Anthony hugged Linda and started jumping up and down. <br />
🎧 Linda loved going to the theater with Anthony. <br />
🎧 He seemed like a little kid when he was there. <br />
🎧 It always put a smile on Linda's face. <br />
🎧 When they got inside, Anthony and Linda found their seats. <br />
🎧 They noticed everyone in the theater started singing a song that came out in the first movie, so Anthony got up and started clapping and singing along. <br />
🎧 Linda looked up at Anthony and thought to herself, It's a whole different experience seeing a midnight screening.<br />

🎧 Some of the most popular places to visit during summer are the beaches. <br />
🎧 Kenneth Green loved going to beaches. <br />
🎧 He lived close to Venice Beach, and could walk to the beach in 30 minutes. <br />
🎧 He could smell the ocean whenever he woke up. <br />
🎧 Kenneth and his friends decided to go to the beach the first day of the summer. <br />
🎧 When they got there, they found it was filled with tourists and people trying to escape the heat.<br />
🎧 Even though the beach was filled with people, Kenneth didn't care. <br />
🎧 He knew all the cool places to go. <br />
🎧 He was friends with some shop owners. <br />
🎧 He was also friends with the owners of a little Mexican restaurant. <br />
🎧 He had a little booth reserved for him during the summer so that whenever he got hungry he didn't have to wait for a table. <br />
🎧 The owners were family friends of Kenneth and they loved having him around. <br />
🎧 Kenneth didn't like to abuse their relationship, so he only went to the restaurant once or twice a week, and he always left good tips.<br />
🎧 There are a lot of activities to do at the beach. <br />
🎧 People can go swimming, rent a bike, play volleyball, or shop around. <br />
🎧 Kenneth is always careful when he is around volleyball nets and people bicycling. <br />
🎧 Last year, he was walking by the volleyball nets when a large man jumped up to hit the ball, which ended up hitting Kenneth right in the head. <br />
🎧 The man ran to Kenneth to make sure he was okay. <br />
🎧 He was okay, but a bit dizzy. <br />
🎧 As Kenneth was trying to get his balance back, he walked right into the path of a bicycle. <br />
🎧 He crashed into a woman riding a bicycle, and they both fell down. <br />
🎧 It wasn't Kenneth's favorite summer.<br />

🎧 I had the worst birthday of my life last year. <br />
🎧 It all started when my sister Donna invited my ex-girlfriend Jennifer. <br />
🎧 For some reason, Donna and Jennifer started getting along after we broke up. <br />
🎧 How convenient, I told Jennifer. <br />
🎧 Donna was always trying to make my life hell. <br />
🎧 I guess that's her job as the older sister. <br />
🎧 She was 20 years old, while I turned 17 years old last year.<br />
🎧 My mother had worked very hard to keep the party they were going to throw for me a secret. <br />
🎧 It didn't work, because Donna had a big mouth, but I was trying to keep up the secret for my mother's sake. <br />
🎧 My dad got home from work and told my mom to get the kids so that we could all go out for dinner.<br />
🎧 We showed up at my favorite restaurant, which has a private room in the back for parties. <br />
🎧 Everything went downhill as soon as I opened the door. <br />
🎧 My other ex-girlfriend Sarah was there, because she wanted to try and fix our relationship. <br />
🎧 I'll never forget the look on Donna's eyes. <br />
🎧 She looked like she saw a ghost. <br />
🎧 Donna grabbed Jennifer and told her to go outside. <br />
🎧 Jennifer and Sarah never got along. <br />
🎧 It might have something to do with me, but I'm not sure.<br />
🎧 Jennifer hadn't seen Sarah, because Donna took Jennifer outside before she had the chance. <br />
🎧 I took Sarah by the hand, and asked her who had invited her. <br />
🎧 She looked at me confused, because apparently I had invited her through a text message a week ago. <br />
🎧 It was true. <br />
🎧 I invited her, but I never thought she would show up. <br />
🎧 When Jennifer finally came into the room, she saw Sarah and became very angry. <br />
🎧 She looked at me and started yelling at me. <br />
🎧 Why is she here, Jason? asked Jennifer. <br />
🎧 I looked at her equally angry and said, What are you talking about? What are YOU doing here? Jennifer started yelling at Sarah, and Sarah started yelling at Jennifer. <br />
🎧 They got so angry that they started fighting, which eventually got us kicked out of the restaurant. <br />
🎧 My mother was crushed when she got there. <br />
🎧 Donna got grounded for a month. <br />
🎧 That was one horrible birthday.<br />

🎧 Let me tell you about my family. <br />
🎧 They are embarrassing to say the least. <br />
🎧 The first time I brought a boy home to meet my parents, they asked him countless questions that no parent should ask. <br />
🎧 When did you lose your virginity? Do you believe in Jesus Christ? How many sexual partners have you had? <br />
🎧 Safe to say, that boy I brought home stopped talking to me after he met my parents. <br />
🎧 I stayed single throughout my time at high school. <br />
🎧 It was not that I didn't like anyone or that no one liked me. <br />
🎧 It was that my parents had a rule. <br />
🎧 They had to approve of whoever I would be dating. <br />
🎧 Sometimes I thought they had that rule specifically to embarrass me.<br />
🎧 I hate that I can't have normal parents. <br />
🎧 They are weird. <br />
🎧 They like collecting old books, and watching old movies. <br />
🎧 They listen to old records on an old record player. <br />
🎧 They say that it's better than listening to an iPod. <br />
🎧 I always let them know that at least I can listen to my iPod when I go out. <br />
🎧 The last day of high school had passed, and I didn't know what I wanted to do. <br />
🎧 I decided to take a year off and work. <br />
🎧 My parents didn't like it, but it was my decision to make.<br />
🎧 I got a job at a little restaurant called Baker's Cabin. <br />
🎧 It was a nice restaurant where people could sit down and have a good steak dinner at a reasonable price. <br />
🎧 I liked working there. <br />
🎧 However, what I liked most was the bartender Paul. <br />
🎧 He had barely turned 21, and was already working behind the bar. <br />
🎧 We started talking. <br />
🎧 I think he really likes me, but I don't want things to get awkward when he meets my parents. <br />
🎧 One day, my friend Susan told Paul that the only way he could date me was to meet my parents. <br />
🎧 Paul went over that night with some records his dad had given him, and offered them to my parents. <br />
🎧 They went nuts, and invited him in. <br />
🎧 They started asking him questions, but not about his sex life or religious beliefs. <br />
🎧 The questions were all about music. <br />
🎧 They really liked him, and they were actually acting normal. <br />
🎧 I think Paul is the guy for me.<br />

🎧 My brother Jeff was sitting with his girlfriend Betty. <br />
🎧 I walked in slowly. <br />
🎧 I looked at my mom, who had tears in her eyes. <br />
🎧 It was very tense. <br />
🎧 I turned to Jeff. <br />
🎧 She's pregnant! Jeff said.<br />
🎧 Jeff and his girlfriend started laughing and said, Yes! I started jumping up and down with joy. <br />
🎧 I always wanted to be an uncle. <br />
🎧 My first reaction was to start screaming, It wasn't me! It wasn't me! <br />
🎧 I started screaming that because my parents always thought I was going to be the first one to give them a grandchild. <br />
🎧 They certainly didn't think Jeff was going to do it. <br />
🎧 I gave them each a hug, and I wished them luck.<br />
🎧 After eight and a half months had passed, Betty gave birth to a beautiful baby boy. <br />
🎧 My family and I were as happy as it could be. <br />
🎧 They named the baby Mark. <br />
🎧 Mark was the name of my father, who passed away a year ago. <br />
🎧 My brother said that he looked like my dad, so he decided to give him the name in honor of my dad. <br />
🎧 We all gathered at the hospital and started laughing, talking. <br />
🎧 We each took turns carrying the baby. <br />
🎧 It was the happiest moment in our family's history. <br />
🎧 We only wished that my father would have been a part of it. <br />
🎧 Jeff looked at baby Mark. <br />
🎧 He told me that my father's spirit was here. <br />
🎧 He would always be there to look over and take care of Mark. <br />
🎧 I smiled and gave him a hug.<br />
