🎧 Getting a driving license is very important for a 16-year-old. <br />
🎧 Today was my 16th birthday, and my dad promised to take me to the Department of Motor Vehicles to do my driving test. <br />
🎧 I passed my written test already, so it was for a road test today. <br />
🎧 When we got to DMV, I began to get really nervous. <br />
🎧 I was driving my dad's car, and I didn't want to mess up and crash. <br />
🎧 My dad looked at me and told me that everything would be fine.<br />
🎧 I had stayed up all night thinking about how it would go and if I would pass the test. <br />
🎧 When the driver instructor came out, he told me to get in the car and turn on the lights. <br />
🎧 I did as I was told. He then told me to turn on the left turn signal, and then the right turn signal. <br />
🎧 They both worked, so it was time to start driving. <br />
🎧 The instructor had dark sunglasses on, and he didn't say much when we got in the car.<br />
🎧 The instructor gave me directions to go straight and make a right turn at the next stop sign, which was a couple of blocks away. <br />
🎧 I did as I was told, and then kept going straight. <br />
🎧 Then the instructor told me to keep going straight until I reached a street called Marengo and then to turn left. <br />
🎧 As I drove, I kept looking for Marengo Street, and thought I might pass it and the instructor would deduct points from my test.<br />
🎧 When I finally found Marengo Street, I turned to tell the instructor. <br />
🎧 That was when I realized that he was asleep. <br />
🎧 I couldn't believe it. <br />
🎧 This was an important event in my life, an event that I had been worried about for months. <br />
🎧 When we finished, he woke up and told me I had done a good job, and that I would be getting my license in about a month. <br />
🎧 I laughed, and thanked him. <br />
🎧 I went to tell my dad the good news.<br />

🎧 Ruth Campbell had never gone to Disneyland as a child. <br />
🎧 She was now 40 years old with two children, a boy and girl. <br />
🎧 The boy's name was Jeff and the girl's name was Carol. <br />
🎧 When Jeff was 11 and Carol was 13, Ruth decided to take her kids to Disneyland, which would be the first time any of them ever went. <br />
🎧 When they arrived at Disneyland, Ruth explained to her children that if they got split up, they would meet at the front of the park.<br />
🎧 The first thing Ruth did when they got inside was looking for Mickey Mouse. <br />
🎧 She wanted to take pictures with all the characters at Disneyland. <br />
🎧 She even made a list of the characters she wanted to take pictures with. <br />
🎧 Her children looked at her and smiled. <br />
🎧 They saw that their mom was acting like a little girl again. <br />
🎧 She was giggling every time she took a picture with a character.<br />
🎧 Her favorite Disney character was Donald Duck, so she kept an eye open for him. <br />
🎧 When they were in line for a ride, she saw that Donald was taking pictures with people by a restaurant. <br />
🎧 She told her children: Look, guys, it's Donald! Hopefully, he is still there when we get out. <br />
🎧 When they got out of the ride, Donald wasn't there anymore. <br />
🎧 Ruth told her children that it was okay, and that they would bump into him later on.<br />
🎧 They enjoyed their day at Disneyland until it was time for the park to close. <br />
🎧 Ruth and her children were looking at the fireworks that they put on every night at Disneyland. <br />
🎧 She hugged her children and told them she loved them. <br />
🎧 They hugged her back and continued to watch the show. <br />
🎧 When they were leaving the park, her children noticed that Donald was taking photos with some other people, and their mom hadn't noticed him yet. <br />
🎧 Carol told her mom that she needed to go to the restroom, and asked her mom to wait for her for a moment. <br />
🎧 While she was waiting for Carol to come back from the restroom, Ruth felt someone poke her on her shoulder. <br />
🎧 It was Donald Duck with Carol! <br />
🎧 Ruth began tearing up a bit, and hugged both of them. <br />
🎧 They all took photos with Donald Duck, the last character on Ruth's list.<br />

🎧 Three men once lived in a small town in Texas. <br />
🎧 One was a musician, another was an artist, and the other was a poor homeless man. <br />
🎧 One day the artist was going to start working on a new sculpture, but didn't have the necessary tools to start. <br />
🎧 He went downtown and saw a poor homeless man. <br />
🎧 Because the artist was new in town and got lost, he asked the homeless man where the nearest art supply store was. <br />
🎧 The homeless man told him that it was the red and white building around the corner. <br />
🎧 The artist looked at him and said thank you. <br />
🎧 He gave the homeless man a ten-dollar bill with the words pass it forward written on the bill. <br />
🎧 The homeless man took the money and said: God bless you!<br />
🎧 A few hours had passed, and the homeless man started getting hungry. <br />
🎧 He walked around in town, and saw a young musician playing outside a cafe. <br />
🎧 The homeless man sat down and started listening to the music played by the musician. <br />
🎧 A waiter from the cafe came out and told the homeless man that he had to leave, because he wasn't buying anything, and other people wanted to sit down and enjoy the music. <br />
🎧 The musician saw this and told the waiter to leave him alone and that he would like to buy the homeless man something to eat. <br />
🎧 The waiter looked at the musician and said okay. <br />
🎧 The homeless man thanked the musician. <br />
🎧 After he finished eating, he took out the ten-dollar bill and gave it to the musician. <br />
🎧 The homeless man left.<br />
🎧 After the musician had finished playing at the cafe, he decided to go to a local art festival with his girlfriend. <br />
🎧 As they were walking around and looking at all the different paintings and sculptures, the musician's girlfriend saw a sculpture she liked. <br />
🎧 It was a young man helping out an older man who had fallen down. <br />
🎧 She wanted to buy it, but didn't have enough money. <br />
🎧 The musician told her not to worry. <br />
🎧 He pulled out ten dollars, and gave it to the artist. <br />
🎧 As the musician and his girlfriend walked away, the artist looked at the ten-dollar bill, and smiled. <br />
🎧 Well, look at that, you found your way back home, said the artist.<br />

🎧 Maria Gonzalez didn't like how technology was slowly taking over everyone's life. <br />
🎧 She always took the bus to school. <br />
🎧 Whenever she got on the bus, she would notice that more than half of the people were staring down at their phones. <br />
🎧 Fewer people were having actual conversations with each other. <br />
🎧 She felt bad. <br />
🎧 She thought that this was the reason why people had trouble relating to people in the real world. <br />
🎧 Everyone was living online now.<br />
🎧 Maria had trouble making new friends because she hated being on social media websites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. <br />
🎧 She rarely met new people. <br />
🎧 She tried going up to people on the bus and starting a conversation, but they always looked at her weirdly. <br />
🎧 She felt like she was an outsider, and the only one that was not caught in the Internet's web of lies.<br />
🎧 One day, while Maria was walking in the park, she saw a girl walking through the park. <br />
🎧 The girl wore a long, colorful dress, and was always smiling. <br />
🎧 Maria wanted to talk to this girl. <br />
🎧 She walked up to the girl and said hello. <br />
🎧 At first the girl was startled, because she didn't see Maria coming, but then she smiled and said, Hello. Do we know each other? <br />
🎧 Maria shook her head and said no. <br />
🎧 Maria asked her if she wanted to hang out and talk. <br />
🎧 The girl said sure. <br />
🎧 Maria and the girl talked for hours. <br />
🎧 They talked about everything: music, boys, family, food, and their shared distrust of technology. <br />
🎧 Maria had done something she hadn't done since she was a young girl: she made a new friend in the real world.<br />

🎧 Disneyland is also called Magic Kingdom. <br />
🎧 It is located in Anaheim, California. <br />
🎧 The park opened in 1955, and was an instant success. <br />
🎧 When Anthony Martinez was a little boy, his brothers and sisters told him about Disneyland. <br />
🎧 At first, Anthony didn't know what they meant. <br />
🎧 He was just too young, and would call it Dizzyland as he couldn't pronounce it properly. <br />
🎧 His father had taken his older siblings to the park many times, but that was years ago. <br />
🎧 Anthony was much younger than his brothers and sisters.<br />
🎧 For a long time, Anthony kept asking his parents to take him to Disneyland, but the feeling eventually wore off. <br />
🎧 He quit bugging his parents to take him.<br />
🎧 One day, when Anthony was about 8 years old, a classmate came to school bragging about his weekend at Disneyland. <br />
🎧 All of a sudden, Anthony wanted to go again. <br />
🎧 Please, mommy, take me to Disneyland, Anthony pleaded to his mom. <br />
🎧 His dad heard it, and immediately told him Okay, son, we're going this weekend for sure. <br />
🎧 Anthony's dad hadn't realized that his youngest child had never been there, and felt very bad about it.<br />
🎧 The weekend came, and Anthony was so excited. <br />
🎧 He couldn't keep still. <br />
🎧 When they got into Disneyland, Anthony marveled at the castles and other attractions. <br />
🎧 He especially liked the life-sized characters that roamed the park. <br />
🎧 He grew up watching Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. <br />
🎧 Now he was taking pictures with them. <br />
🎧 Anthony was in heaven.<br />
🎧 The best part of the theme park is the rides. <br />
🎧 Can we go on the Captain Nemo Ride? <br />
🎧 That question was soon followed by Can we go on the Matterhorn? <br />
🎧 Soon Anthony had gone on just about every ride. <br />
🎧 He was overwhelmed by the place. <br />
🎧 Soon the family was back in their SUV heading back home with Anthony fast asleep. <br />
🎧 It was the greatest day of his young life. <br />
🎧 A day he would later call the best day of my life.<br />

🎧 A loud boom woke her up. <br />
🎧 She looked at the clock next to her bed. <br />
🎧 It was midnight. <br />
🎧 What was that? she asked her husband, who hadn't been woken up by the sound, so Betty shook him. <br />
🎧 Another loud boom followed. <br />
🎧 Then there was a crackling sound. <br />
🎧 Oh, that's just fireworks, Betty's husband said. <br />
🎧 It wasn't the fourth of July, the most common day to hear fireworks. <br />
🎧 It was just a normal Thursday night in the middle of June. <br />
🎧 Why would there be fireworks now? Betty asked.<br />
🎧 Betty and her husband just moved into a new house after their wedding. <br />
🎧 This was the neighborhood her husband grew up in. <br />
🎧 He said it was common for people to start setting off fireworks in the summer, even before the Independence Day holiday. <br />
🎧 The whole summer is a reason for fireworks here, Betty's husband told her. <br />
🎧 He said that even when it wasn't summer, people set off fireworks for whatever they were celebrating.<br />
🎧 Maybe someone is having a graduation party or a birthday, Betty's husband told her. <br />
🎧 He said that sometimes people set off fireworks even when a local sports team won a game. <br />
🎧 Betty wondered how that was legal. <br />
🎧 She thought fireworks were illegal to buy and use. <br />
🎧 Betty's husband told her that it was easy enough for people to buy fireworks. <br />
🎧 He also told her that different counties in the state had different laws, so people could buy fireworks in one county and use them in a different county, like where they lived. <br />
🎧 Also people can legally set off fireworks for holidays besides the fourth of July, like for Lunar New Year, he added.<br />
🎧 Betty tried to go back to sleep, but the loud booms and crackles kept going. <br />
🎧 She decided to get a glass of water and go out into the yard to see the fireworks.<br />

🎧 Patricia was happy that she was finally making friends since moving to Los Angeles from New York. <br />
🎧 She had left everything behind to move to be closer to her boyfriend. <br />
🎧 The first friend she made was Helen. <br />
🎧 Helen worked with Patricia at a clothing store in the local shopping mall. <br />
🎧 Sometimes Patricia would even see Helen on the freeway when they were working the same shift. <br />
🎧 Patricia thought that they must not live too far from one another. <br />
🎧 Helen confirmed this.<br />
🎧 My neighborhood is right next to yours, Helen told Patricia while they were both checking out customers. <br />
🎧 Drop by anytime you want on a day when we're both not working, Helen said. <br />
🎧 Patricia took the invitation too literally. <br />
🎧 She was able to get Helen's address from their manager at work. <br />
🎧 I want to surprise my new friend, Patricia told the manager. <br />
🎧 The manager thought that was sweet and without thinking about Helen's privacy, he passed the address onto Patricia. <br />
🎧 On a day that Patricia and Helen both had the day off, Patricia looked up Helen's address on her map application on her cell phone. <br />
🎧 Helen's house was only 10 minutes away.<br />
🎧 Patricia followed the directions, and at 9:00 a.m., she rang the doorbell at 2374 Evergreen Avenue. <br />
🎧 It took Helen awhile to answer the door. <br />
🎧 She looked genuinely surprised, but also confused when she saw Patricia on her doorstep. <br />
🎧 What are you doing here? How did you get my address? Helen asked. <br />
🎧 She was still in her pajamas and her hair was a mess. <br />
🎧 You told me to drop by anytime we both had a day off, so I got your address from our manager. I want to give you a surprise! Patricia said. <br />
🎧 I was just being polite. You can't just show up at someone's house! Helen said before slamming the door on Patricia's face.<br />

🎧 Julie was tired of living with her parents. <br />
🎧 She was 22, and just finished college. <br />
🎧 She started a new job in an office, and didn't want her parents to tell her what to do anymore, so Julie decided to start looking for an apartment. <br />
🎧 She started by looking at classified ads in the newspaper and checking on websites like Craigslist.<br />
🎧 The first apartment she went to see sounded perfect on the newspaper. <br />
🎧 It was advertised as a cozy one-bedroom apartment with a view. <br />
🎧 She made an appointment to view the apartment. <br />
🎧 When the landlord opened the door, Julie was sorely disappointed. <br />
🎧 The cozy bedroom barely fit a twin mattress and a nightstand. <br />
🎧 The window actually offered a view of a brick wall.<br />
🎧 Julie didn't give up hope though. <br />
🎧 The next apartment she saw was advertised as having a renovated kitchen. <br />
🎧 Since Julie loved to cook, she imagined herself cooking gourmet meals on shiny new kitchen appliances. <br />
🎧 However, the broker showing Julie around explained that the only renovations were new knobs on old wooden cabinets. <br />
🎧 Julie was beginning to lose hope. <br />
🎧 She then saw a listing for a basement apartment with access to a low maintenance yard. <br />
🎧 Julie imagined herself hosting barbecues for her friends until she saw that the low maintenance yard was a tiny slab on concrete.<br />
🎧 Julie decided to stop looking for apartments that had features she liked. <br />
🎧 Instead she was going to look for an apartment close to her job. <br />
🎧 She read a listing for a studio that was close to a freeway. <br />
🎧 This meant a shorter commute. <br />
🎧 When she saw the place, she found that the studio actually overlooked the freeway, and traffic could be heard from the bedroom.<br />
🎧 Julie was discouraged. She decided not to move out yet.<br />

🎧 It was Laura's first Halloween in the United States. <br />
🎧 She had seen many portrayals of the late October holiday on television and in movies. <br />
🎧 She had to admit she was a little excited and nervous about the day. <br />
🎧 She was excited to see the costumes worn by kids ringing her doorbell; she was also worried about being scared by the costumes. <br />
🎧 She had watched too many horror movies.<br />
🎧 Laura was renting a room in a house. <br />
🎧 Her landlady asked her if she could help with the candy. <br />
🎧 Laura happily agreed. <br />
🎧 The sun was just starting to set when the first group of kids in costumes rang the doorbell. <br />
🎧 Trick or treat! they said enthusiastically when Laura opened the door. <br />
🎧 The kids all had open bags. <br />
🎧 I want a treat! Laura said and grabbed the candy from each of the bag. <br />
🎧 The landlady came running to the door. <br />
🎧 No, Laura. You give the kids candy, not taking from them, she explained gently. <br />
🎧 Thankfully, none of the kids were upset. <br />
🎧 They just looked confused. <br />
🎧 The landlady suggested that Laura should go out with some friends to a local community Halloween carnival. <br />
🎧 She would handle giving out the candy by herself.<br />
🎧 Laura went to her room to put on her witch costume. <br />
🎧 She walked to the local recreation center along with Joe and some other friends. <br />

🎧 She just thought it was another Halloween tradition.<br />
🎧 A few hours later, the landlady opened the door and found Laura accompanied by police. <br />
🎧 Trick or treat? Laura asked, looking embarrassed.<br />

🎧 Sharon and Ken just finished a wonderful meal at a fancy restaurant. <br />
🎧 The service and food were five-star quality. <br />
🎧 Ken asked for the check. <br />
🎧 How much is the tip? Sharon asked. <br />
🎧 Since she and Ken were just friends, she didn't want him to pay for the whole meal, but since Ken did invite her, she assumed he was paying. <br />
🎧 Sharon thought that offering to put in the tip was a nice gesture. <br />
🎧 The tip was not going to be cheap. <br />
🎧 The meal, complete with a bottle of wine, must have been at least $200. <br />
🎧 $30 would be 15 percent of a $200 bill, and $40 would be 20 percent of a $200 check. <br />
🎧 Since the service was good, Sharon had no problem giving a 20 percent tip.<br />
🎧 Ken told Sharon that there was no need to leave a tip. <br />
🎧 Sharon was shocked. <br />
🎧 Maybe Ken didn't think the food was good or maybe he wasn't happy with the service. <br />
🎧 This surprised Sharon because Ken seemed to enjoy the entire experience and didn't complain. <br />
🎧 Was something wrong? Sharon asked Ken. <br />
🎧 No, Ken answered. <br />
🎧 He explained that he felt tipping was just an American way of showing off extra wealth. <br />
🎧 I think it's vulgar and disrespectful, he continued.<br />
🎧 Sharon knew that Ken wasn't born in the United States and wondered if that had something to do with how Ken felt. <br />
🎧 Well, in the United States, tipping is kind of expected. Servers generally aren't paid that well and rely on tips to feed their families. The exception of course is if the service was really bad, but I had a lovely time. Didn't you? Sharon asked. <br />
🎧 Service was great, Ken agreed, but why don't they just pay the servers better so we don't have to pay more? Sharon agreed with Ken, but she still left a 20 percent tip.<br />
