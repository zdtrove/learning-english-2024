🎧 An 85-year-old woman in Tennessee named Astrid became a multimillionaire overnight after winning a $500 million lottery jackpot. <br />
🎧 However, her road to richness was not all completely smooth. <br />
🎧 Her story reminds us that in order to win the lottery, there are two crucial requirements. <br />
🎧 The first and most obvious necessity is a lot of luck. <br />
🎧 The second requirement is just as important, but much less often mentioned -- getting organized.<br />
🎧 Astrid's story began when getting in line for a lottery ticket at her local supermarket. <br />
🎧 The woman ahead of her decided to let her cut in front of her to pay. <br />
🎧 This woman was also planning on buying a lottery ticket. <br />
🎧 Had she not given Astrid her spot in the line, the lottery money would have been hers!<br />
🎧 On the day that the winners were announced, Astrid realized she had won, she could not contain her excitement. <br />
🎧 She danced with joy all around her house and jumped on the phone to tell her closest relatives what had just happened. <br />
🎧 The next morning Astrid woke up and prepared to go claim her prize money, but suddenly realized that she could not remember where she had placed her ticket. <br />
🎧 Given that her memory was no longer as sharp as it used to be, she searched and searched around her messy house for hours to no avail. <br />
🎧 She had absolutely no recollection of where she might have stored or dropped the ticket.<br />
🎧 Astrid had been given thirty days to claim her prize, or else it would be canceled. <br />
🎧 For 27 days, her schedule was dedicated to searching every surface and square foot of her house for the missing ticket. <br />
🎧 With only three days left, she decided to finally call her daughters for help. <br />
🎧 She had been too embarrassed to call them from the beginning because her house was so messy, but now had no other choice. <br />
🎧 Figuring that helping their mother find the ticket would probably secure at least an extra million dollars to them, all three of Astrid's daughters immediately sped over to her house.<br />
🎧 Within the first half hour of searching, the youngest of her daughters hollered, I found it! It turned out Astrid had left it in a dish cabinet. <br />
🎧 Oh, thank you, daughter! Astrid cried. <br />
🎧 I owe you so much! Her daughter's smile glistened with pride as her two sisters scowled at her from the next room.<br />

🎧 For most people, an ideal morning might consist of waking up to the warm sun creeping in through the bedroom window, along with the cheerful chirping of the birds from a nearby tree. <br />
🎧 Sadly, this is not the case for Michael, a part-time student that works late nights as a warehouse manager. <br />
🎧 Michael gets home around 2:00 a.m. every night, and heads straight to bed to get as much sleep as possible until his classes start at 10:00 a.m. <br />
🎧 However, for the past week, Michael has had a new alarm clock that he unfortunately has no control of. <br />
🎧 It is an energetic, loud, mockingbird that has decided to make the tree outside of Michael's window his new home.<br />
🎧 Each morning, the bird begins singing as loud as possible at exactly 5:55 a.m. and does not stop until late into the night. <br />
🎧 Most city birds begin the day with sweet, gentle chirps that can barely even be heard indoors, but the sounds of mockingbirds are very distinct and consist of various noises that the mockingbird hears and then imitates. <br />
🎧 This can include chirps from other birds, or even car alarms and school bells.<br />
🎧 After one week of losing sleep as a result of the bird noises, Michael decided to do something. <br />
🎧 Go away! he screamed out his window. <br />
🎧 When that didn't work, he started throwing things at the tree to try to scare the bird away. <br />
🎧 This only made the bird get even louder! <br />
🎧 As a final resort, Michael phoned his local Animal Control, and requested to get someone to remove the bird from the area. <br />
🎧 We can't do that, replied the Animal Control Specialist. <br />
🎧 Mockingbirds are a valued feature of North America's wildlife and are protected by many laws. <br />
🎧 You should consider yourself lucky to have one so close to home. <br />
🎧 Just enjoy the beautiful sounds of nature.<br />
🎧 Furious, Michael hung up the phone, and threw himself on the couch, dozing off into the deepest sleep he had ever experienced all week. <br />
🎧 Only five minutes later he awoke to a thunderous caw-caw! coming from outside.<br />

🎧 On December 26, 2004, a 10-minute long earthquake with a 9.3 magnitude occurred in the Indian Ocean. <br />
🎧 This massive earthquake, which is the third strongest ever recorded in history, triggered various powerful tsunamis that reached over a dozen countries' shores. <br />
🎧 Nearly 230,000 people were killed by the catastrophe, and hundreds of thousands of others ended up injured or missing. <br />
🎧 In the midst of all the devastation caused by this disaster, many amazing and inspiring survival stories have emerged. <br />
🎧 One of the most extraordinary of these is the story of a young girl named Wati.<br />
🎧 The tsunami struck her hometown of Aceh when she was only eight years old. <br />
🎧 Like so many others, the powerful waves separated her from her family, and she ended up being washed into an unknown town. <br />
🎧 After many years of searching for her, her family gave up and assumed she had died after being swept away. <br />
🎧 Miraculously, Wati was returned to her parents seven years later, at the age of 15!<br />
🎧 According to Wati, she had been adopted by a stranger who found her on the streets after the tsunami. <br />
🎧 Although the woman took her in to live with her, she forced Wati to beg on the streets and would often beat her if she did not make enough money. <br />
🎧 The girl had tried to find her family by asking for help from strangers, but did not remember the names of her parents and could only vaguely remember that she had a grandfather named Ibraham.<br />
🎧 Finally one day, a cab driver who heard Wati's story happened to know an old man with that name in a nearby town and decided to take her to him. <br />
🎧 Although the old man did not recognize her at first, he took Wati to see his daughter. <br />
🎧 When I saw my mother, I knew it was her, said the 15-year-old. <br />
🎧 I just knew. <br />
🎧 The parents were able to confirm that it really was their daughter based on a scar and birthmark on the girl's hip. <br />
🎧 This miraculous story is unfortunately one of the only confirmed reunions among families that were separated by the disaster.<br />

🎧 It was Saturday morning. <br />
🎧 Mary walked out of her house with twenty dollars in her pocket and a spirit full of optimism. <br />
🎧 She had spent the previous night in front of her television set watching a reality show that followed lucky people who had found amazing things at their local thrift shops. <br />
🎧 All of these people had bought seemingly ordinary items for extremely low prices, and ended up discovering that their items were actually very valuable treasures. <br />
🎧 After having spent five consecutive hours watching other people's experiences, Mary was determined to give bargain hunting a try in hopes of finding something that would make her rich.<br />
🎧 One of her favorite stories from the show was of a man who had purchased a copy of the Declaration of Independence thinking that it was a cheap replica, for only $2. <br />
🎧 He ended up discovering that the print was actually one of only 200 official copies of the Declaration of Independence commissioned by John Quincy Adams in 1820. <br />
🎧 The man ended up making $477,650 after selling it.<br />
🎧 As Mary walked into her local thrift shop, she tried recalling what all the people in the reality show had looked for. <br />
🎧 The most common items that people got rich from were paintings and so she headed straight to the Home Decorations aisle. <br />
🎧 Once there, she couldn't decide which looked most expensive. <br />
🎧 They actually all seemed pretty ugly to her. <br />
🎧 Excuse me, Mary said to an elderly woman walking by. <br />
🎧 Which painting do you think could make me richer? Confused, the old lady quickly pointed at one and walked away.<br />
🎧 The painting the old lady had pointed at was of a cat collage with almost 20 different cat faces jumbled atop of one another. <br />
🎧 Definitely not my first choice, thought Mary. <br />
🎧 However, she trusted destiny's decision and bought the painting for five dollars. <br />
🎧 After putting it up online, she began receiving dozens of emails asking if the picture frame displayed came with the painting. <br />
🎧 In order to see what all the buzz about the frame was about, she took it to an antique store and asked if there was anything special about the frame. <br />
🎧 Of course, it is special! remarked the clerk at the store. <br />
🎧 Its wood and age make it at least $25,000! Mary ended up selling the frame for $30,000. <br />
🎧 A few days later, the buyer returned the ugly painting to her through the mail.<br />

🎧 For the past week Elizabeth would come home from work and discover that her apartment smelled like cigarette smoke. <br />
🎧 She did not know where the smell was coming from. <br />
🎧 Elizabeth didn't smoke. <br />
🎧 No one else had the key to her apartment to smoke inside while she was at work. <br />
🎧 The smell of smoke especially bothered her because she had asthma.<br />
🎧 One day Elizabeth stayed home from work because she was expecting a package. <br />
🎧 When she woke up that morning, the apartment smelled fine. <br />
🎧 At one in the afternoon, Elizabeth went into the kitchen to make a sandwich for lunch. <br />
🎧 That was when she noticed the smell of cigarette smoke. <br />
🎧 She called the building's superintendent. <br />
🎧 By the time he arrived at Elizabeth's apartment, the whole place smelled like cigarette smoke. <br />
🎧 The super told Elizabeth he was pretty sure the smoke was coming up though the vents from her new downstairs neighbor. <br />
🎧 The new neighbor was a smoker. <br />
🎧 The super told Elizabeth there was nothing to be done. <br />
🎧 The building was really old and the vents couldn't be sealed. <br />
🎧 It was also perfectly legal for the downstairs neighbor to smoke in his apartment. <br />
🎧 He suggested that Elizabeth buy an air filter and see if that would help.<br />
🎧 Elizabeth bought an air filter but didn't find it to be enough. <br />
🎧 Her asthma was getting worse. <br />

🎧 Ron was excited to show his wife Debbie what he had bought at the home improvement store. <br />
🎧 Debbie, however, was not impressed when she saw the big, black plastic bin. <br />
🎧 She thought it was a garbage can. <br />
🎧 We have a garbage can already. Why did you get another one? Debbie asked. <br />
🎧 She seemed annoyed.<br />
🎧 Ron explained that it was not a garbage can. <br />
🎧 It was a compost bin. <br />
🎧 Ron explained that a compost bin was a place where they could put any organic waste, like fallen leaves, grass clippings, and fruit and vegetable peels. <br />
🎧 Why can't we just throw that in the trash? Debbie asked. <br />
🎧 She really didn't want extra work for herself. <br />
🎧 Ron explained that it was good for the environment. <br />
🎧 About 30% of all the garbage in the United States is made up of waste from food and yards. <br />
🎧 Not only would they produce less garbage, they would also make compost, which was rich soil. <br />
🎧 It would help Debbie's flowers. <br />
🎧 She could have the beautiful garden she always dreamed of. <br />
🎧 Ron explained that little by little inside the bin, the food scraps and green waste would create a pile. <br />
🎧 The pile would naturally break down.<br />
🎧 Where are we keeping this pile? Debbie asked. <br />
🎧 Ron said the bin would go in the back yard. <br />
🎧 Debbie wasn't convinced. <br />
🎧 She was worried about rats and roaches. <br />
🎧 Ron explained that as long as they didn't put any meat scraps or oily items in the compost bin, then rats wouldn't be a problem. <br />
🎧 Roaches, however, were a natural part of the materials breaking down.<br />
🎧 Ron was especially excited about what he bought to put in the compost bin. <br />
🎧 He pulled out a small box and gave it to Debbie. <br />
🎧 She opened it and screamed before dropping the box on the floor. <br />
🎧 The box was filled with worms.<br />

🎧 Jaime, a new immigrant, was attending his daughter's first performance in a school play. <br />
🎧 His daughter, Carol, was five years old. <br />
🎧 She was a kindergarten student at the local public school. <br />
🎧 Carol did not have a very big role in the school play. <br />
🎧 She was playing a rain cloud in a play about the drought in California. <br />
🎧 Carol had one line. <br />
🎧 Her line was,  I am sad enough to cry about how dry the state is.<br />
🎧 Jaime and his wife made sure to arrive early so that they could get a good seat in the auditorium. <br />
🎧 They secured seats in the front row. <br />
🎧 Before the show began, the school principal made an introductory speech. <br />
🎧 The speech was about how hard the students and teachers worked together to make the play possible. <br />
🎧 At the end of the speech, the principal said, Let's give the school staff a hand.<br />
🎧 Jaime, whose English was not very good, stood up when the principal said this. <br />
🎧 He knew that when people said to give someone a hand they meant they needed help. <br />
🎧 Jaime always wanted to help, especially at his daughter's school. <br />
🎧 Jaime thought maybe they needed help backstage.<br />
🎧 Jaime's wife put her arm in front of her husband. <br />
🎧 Where are you going? she whispered. <br />

🎧 They don't need help. They just want us to clap, Jaime's wife said. <br />
🎧 Jaime felt a little embarrassed. <br />
🎧 He sat back down and began clapping along with the rest of the audience.<br />
🎧 Jaime thought to himself that someone needed to give the English language a hand. <br />
🎧 How could one phrase mean two different things? <br />
🎧 He meant the English language needed help.<br />

🎧 Donald had a rough morning. <br />
🎧 He had an argument with his wife, so he thought it would be a good idea to finish a six-pack of beer and a handful of prescription pain pills. <br />
🎧 This would have been fine if he had stayed inside his house. <br />
🎧 Instead, drunk and high, Donald began to harass his next-door neighbor. <br />
🎧 First he banged on his neighbor's door. <br />

🎧 He was charged with attempted burglary. <br />
🎧 A judge set his bail at $10,000. <br />
🎧 He didn't have $10,000, so he is still in jail awaiting trial.<br />

🎧 Chaco was loved and grew fast. <br />
🎧 Rob began to notice, however, that Chaco was growing too fast and getting too big. <br />
🎧 When Chaco made his first sound, Rob couldn't believe his ears. <br />
🎧 Rob expected a quack, but Chaco honked. <br />
🎧 Chaco was no duck. Chaco was a goose.<br />
🎧 Rob didn't reject Chaco though. <br />
🎧 He kept him as long as he could. <br />
🎧 Chaco was not a quiet goose. <br />
🎧 He made a lot of noise, honking day and night. <br />
🎧 Rob's neighbors started to complain. <br />
🎧 Rob didn't want to give Chaco up, but he couldn't risk his neighbors calling the police on him either. <br />
🎧 Rob had to make a decision.<br />
🎧 Rob decided to take Chaco to a nearby park that had a lake with other geese. <br />
🎧 Rob felt sad leaving Chaco and he was pretty sure his feathered friend felt sad, too. <br />
🎧 Rob goes twice a week to the park to visit Chaco so that both the goose and the owner are less sad. <br />
🎧 When Rob goes to visit, Chaco swims across the lake right into Rob's arms. <br />
🎧 Sometimes, Chaco will even give Rob a little peck, a goose's way of giving a kiss.<br />
🎧 When Rob goes to visit, he always brings snacks for Chaco. <br />
🎧 The other geese seemed to be jealous of all the attention Chaco was getting, so now Rob brings enough bread for all the geese to share. <br />
🎧 Rob and Chaco also play. <br />
🎧 Rob throws his former pet into the lake. <br />
🎧 Chaco goes underwater, swims a little, and then returns to the shore so that Rob can throw him in again.<br />
