🎧 One of Barb's favorite activities since moving to the United States was watching television. <br />
🎧 She especially loved watching the commercials. <br />
🎧 You really can buy anything here in America! she told her friends. <br />
🎧 One afternoon she was watching television and saw a commercial that really grabbed her attention. <br />
🎧 It showed a cartoon woman tossing and turning. <br />
🎧 The woman in the commercial was unable to sleep because she was busy thinking about the day that had passed and worrying about the day ahead. <br />
🎧 Barb wasn't quite sure what the commercial was advertising. <br />
🎧 Was it a bed? <br />
🎧 Was it a pillow? <br />
🎧 Was it just a public service announcement urging people to sleep more? <br />
🎧 Suddenly a voice on the television began speaking very quickly, listing side effects of the sleeping pill the commercial was advertising. <br />
🎧 One of the side effects was insomnia. <br />
🎧 Barb thought that seemed like an odd side effect for a sleeping pill.<br />
🎧 The next day Barb happened to be in the local neighborhood pharmacy picking up a few things. <br />
🎧 She remembered the commercial she had seen the night before for the sleeping pills. <br />
🎧 She walked up and down the aisles looking for them. <br />
🎧 Since she saw it advertised on television, she thought she might try them. <br />
🎧 Sometimes she had a hard time sleeping. <br />
🎧 When she couldn't find the pills on her own, she walked over to the pharmacy counter and asked the pharmacist where she could find the pills.<br />
🎧 Do you have a prescription? the pharmacist asked. <br />
🎧 Barn explained that she didn't, but she saw the pills advertised on television and thought she would try them. <br />
🎧 Those are not available over the counter, the pharmacist explained. <br />
🎧 Barb thought it was dumb for there to be a commercial for something she couldn't just go get at the store. <br />
🎧 She walked out of the pharmacy without buying anything.<br />

🎧 One of the first things Gustav wanted to do when he got to the United States was to see as much of it as he could. <br />
🎧 He would be flying into New York City's John F. Kennedy airport. <br />
🎧 In New York he planned to see the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty. <br />
🎧 Then he wanted to go to Philadelphia to see the Liberty Bell. <br />
🎧 Then he wanted to go to the nation's capital, Washington D.C., where he hoped to see the White House, and maybe he would even see President. <br />
🎧 He knew that getting to the three east coast cities was pretty easy. <br />
🎧 He could take a train or bus.<br />
🎧 Gustav wasn't sure though about how he would get to the other parts of the United States he wanted to see. <br />
🎧 For example, Gustav really wanted to see the Grand Canyon in Arizona. <br />
🎧 He also really wanted to go to Los Angeles to see where some of his favorite movie stars lived.<br />
🎧 Once in New York City Gustav asked the hotel concierge if they could arrange some trips for him. <br />
🎧 The concierge was helpful and informed Gustav about the different Amtrak trains he could take to Philadelphia and Washington D.C. <br />
🎧 What about the Grand Canyon and Hollywood? Gustav asked. <br />
🎧 What about them? the concierge asked, looking confused. <br />
🎧 What about trips there? Gustav asked. <br />
🎧 The concierge pulled out a map and showed Gustav how far Arizona and California are from New York. <br />
🎧 A train there will take you about a week. A plane ride will take about six hours, the concierge explained. <br />
🎧 Gustav was disappointed. <br />
🎧 He had no idea that the United States was such a large country. <br />
🎧 He was determined to see as much as he could though. <br />
🎧 He wondered how much it would cost to rent a camper and drive it across the U.S.<br />

🎧 Kim was a housekeeper for a family in Beverly Hills. <br />
🎧 One morning when she went to work, she found a note from her boss. <br />
🎧 The note asked her to go to the supermarket and pick up a few things. <br />
🎧 There was a list of things Kim was supposed to buy. <br />
🎧 The note surprised Kim. <br />
🎧 She had only been a housekeeper for a week and had never been asked to go shopping before. <br />
🎧 Kim didn't even know where the nearest grocery store was. <br />
🎧 She also didn't know how to drive. <br />
🎧 Thankfully the note also told her that the boss's driver would take her to the market. <br />
🎧 There was also a $50 bill.<br />
🎧 Once at the market Kim walked through looking for the items on her list. <br />
🎧 She was confused though. <br />
🎧 The list read one pound of apples. <br />
🎧 Kim had purchased one kilogram of apples but never a pound. <br />
🎧 In her country, they used the metric system. <br />
🎧 She wasn't sure if a pound was more or less than a kilogram. <br />
🎧 Kim decided to ask one of the grocery workers. <br />
🎧 The grocery worker was kind and explained that a pound was about half a kilogram.<br />
🎧 I wouldn't worry about it though. Just use the scale, the grocery worker. <br />
🎧 Kim went to the scale and was happy to see that the scales didn't use the metric system she was used to. <br />
🎧 Kim weighed a pound of apples and put it in the shopping cart.<br />
🎧 The next item on the list was a gallon of milk. <br />
🎧 Kim wasn't sure how much a gallon was. <br />
🎧 She was used to buying a liter of milk. <br />
🎧 There was also no way to weigh a liter of milk. <br />
🎧 She was glad that the milk containers were labeled. <br />
🎧 She just wished the U.S. used the metric system.<br />

🎧 John had been saving his allowance for three weeks so that he could buy a telescope he had seen advertised in the newspaper. <br />
🎧 According to the advertisement, the telescope cost $94,99. <br />
🎧 John also did some odd jobs around the neighborhood where he lived. <br />
🎧 He mowed the neighbor's lawn and took another neighbor's dog for a walk. <br />
🎧 Finally he had 95 dollars.<br />
🎧 One Saturday John walked to the store. <br />
🎧 He had brought with him the advertisement, which he had cut out from the newspaper. <br />
🎧 He asked a salesperson in the store where he could find the telescope advertised. <br />
🎧 He pulled out the newspaper ad and showed it to the salesperson to make sure they took him to the right one. <br />
🎧 The salesperson showed John where the telescopes were and together they looked for the one he wanted. <br />
🎧 It was called the Vega 600.<br />
🎧 I found it! John told the salesperson. <br />
🎧 The salesperson confirmed that the Vega 600 cost $94.99 and brought the box to the cash register so that John could pay for it. <br />
🎧 John was so excited. <br />
🎧 He felt like jumping up and down. <br />
🎧 He had worked so hard to get this.<br />
🎧 That will be $104.01, the salesperson told John. <br />
🎧 Did you advertise it as $94.99? John asked angrily. <br />
🎧 He thought the salesperson was trying to take advantage of him. <br />
🎧 Yes, it is, but we have to add sales tax. It's the law. In California the sales tax is 9.5 percent the salesperson explained. <br />
🎧 Why don't you just put the final price on advertisements and price tags then? John asked. <br />
🎧 Then everything seems more expensive and people won't come into the store to buy the salesperson explained. <br />
🎧 Everything is more expensive! John said angrily, walking out of the store without the telescope.<br />

🎧 Maggie was meeting her friend Lisa at a French restaurant downtown for lunch. <br />
🎧 Lisa was visiting New York from Chile. <br />
🎧 They met in Chile over 10 years ago. <br />
🎧 That was the time when Maggie spent a semester abroad as part of her undergraduate studies. <br />
🎧 Lisa was a Chilean student who helped Maggie learn Spanish and how to play soccer. <br />
🎧 Even when Maggie came back to the United States, the two friends kept in touch with each other via Facebook and Skype.<br />
🎧 Maggie waved to Lisa from the table in the restaurant when she saw her Chilean friend walk in. <br />
🎧 Lisa looked the same, just a little older and a little fatter. <br />
🎧 Tell me what is new with you? Maggie asked Lisa. <br />
🎧 Lisa explained that she worked for an airline and was in town on business. <br />
🎧 I get to travel all the time now, Lisa told Maggie. <br />
🎧 Oh, really? Maggie replied. <br />
🎧 Yes really, and I can even sometimes get tickets for friends and family members at really low prices, Lisa continued. <br />
🎧 Oh, really? Maggie replied. <br />
🎧 Maggie was annoying Lisa. <br />
🎧 Lisa was beginning to feel like Maggie didn't believe what she was saying. <br />
🎧 I can show you the memo from my job that explains it all if you don't believe me, Lisa said angrily. <br />
🎧 Why wouldn't I believe you? Maggie asked and confused. <br />
🎧 She thought it was great that Lisa had a job that took her all over the world, and that even let her do it with friends and family.<br />
🎧 Well, you keep saying oh, really? Like you are challenging what I'm saying, Lisa said. <br />
🎧 Maggie explained that when she said oh really, it just meant she found what Lisa was saying interesting and wanted her to elaborate. <br />
🎧 Oh, really? Lisa said before the two friends both burst out laughing.<br />

🎧 When William was transferred to a job in Texas, he was really worried about making friends. <br />
🎧 On his first day in the factory though, everyone was really friendly. <br />
🎧 You should join our softball league, his co-worker Richard suggested. <br />
🎧 That's a great idea, thanks, but I don't have a bat or a glove, William said to Richard. <br />
🎧 Richard jotted down on a piece of paper the name and address of a local sports supply shop nearby. <br />
🎧 They will have everything you need, Richard said.<br />
🎧 On his day off, William went to the sports shop. <br />
🎧 Boy, Rich wasn't kidding, William said to himself. <br />
🎧 Not only did they have bats and gloves, but also equipment for all kinds of sports. <br />
🎧 The store also featured an extensive gun selection. <br />
🎧 Those are toy guns? William asked. <br />
🎧 The salesperson shook his head. <br />
🎧 No, sir. These are all working weapons. I have some machetes and knives too if you want something more traditional, the salesperson explained.<br />
🎧 No, I just came in for some softball equipment, William told the salesperson. <br />
🎧 Well, you can take home any of these lovely rifles or guns along with your softball equipment today, the salesperson continued. <br />
🎧 I don't need a license? William asked. <br />
🎧 The salesperson shook his head. <br />
🎧 There's no waiting period? William asked. <br />
🎧 The salesperson shook his head again. <br />
🎧 I don't have to take a safety course? William asked. <br />
🎧 He couldn't believe it was so easy to buy a gun.<br />
🎧 No, sir. It's cash and carry here, the salesperson said.<br />
🎧 So can I show you a fine firearm today? William shook his head. <br />
🎧 No, but can I take a picture? My friends back in New York won't believe it's this easy to buy a gun here. <br />
🎧 Sure, buddy, the salesperson said. <br />
🎧 I'll even take a picture of you with any weapons you want.<br />

🎧 Mildred went to pick up her son Bill from school one afternoon. <br />
🎧 When she got to the school, Mildred noticed that Bill looked upset. <br />
🎧 He was pouting and did not want to look at her. <br />
🎧 What's wrong? she asked him. <br />
🎧 I got in trouble, Bill said in a low voice. <br />
🎧 What happened? Mildred asked gently. <br />
🎧 I got put in time-out for grabbing a toy from Mary, Bill said.<br />
🎧 Mildred wasn't sure what a time-out was. <br />
🎧 She knew that time-outs were called in sports whenever a player was injured but she wasn't sure how that would be used in a kindergarten classroom. <br />
🎧 Mildred was sure though that her son grabbing a toy from a classmate was not correct. <br />
🎧 The next day when Mildred took Bill to school, she stopped the teacher. <br />
🎧 She asked the teacher to explain what a time-out was. <br />
🎧 Mildred told the teacher that Bill was very upset about the time-out he had the day before. <br />
🎧 The teacher explained that time-out was a discipline tool she used in the classroom. <br />
🎧 When she saw Bill grab the toy from Mary, she told him to go into time-out. <br />
🎧 Time-out is a chair next to the teacher's desk where a student has to sit quietly when they do something wrong.<br />
🎧 They aren't kicked out of the classroom, just taken out of the immediate situation so they can reflect on what they did wrong, the teacher explained. <br />
🎧 Mildred thought it was an interesting way to teach self-control to little kids. <br />
🎧 Can I use this at home? Mildred asked the teacher. <br />
🎧 Of course! the teacher said.<br />
🎧 Later that night, Mildred got into an argument with her husband for something. <br />
🎧 In the middle of the argument she slammed her hand on the kitchen counter. <br />
🎧 Mommy, you need a time-out, Bill said.<br />

🎧 When Julia left for school in the morning, she noticed a pigeon sitting very closely to the front door of her apartment building. <br />
🎧 Usually pigeons flew away whenever someone got too close to them, but this pigeon didn't seem to care. <br />
🎧 Julia didn't think too much of it though. <br />
🎧 When she got back home from school that afternoon, she noticed the pigeon was in the same exact place. <br />
🎧 It seemed the pigeon hadn't moved at all. <br />
🎧 Julia moved closer. <br />
🎧 She noticed the pigeon had a wound on its wing. <br />
🎧 She was worried that a dog or a cat would eat the injured animal. <br />
🎧 Julie ran upstairs to her apartment and told her mom about the pigeon.<br />
🎧 We have to help it! Julie insisted. <br />
🎧 Julie's mom made a disgusted face. <br />
🎧 I don't want to. Pigeons have diseases, she said. <br />
🎧 Julie began to cry. <br />
🎧 This made Julie's mom feel bad. <br />
🎧 She gave in, but she gave Julie some rules. <br />
🎧 The pigeon had to stay in the kitchen in a storage bin. <br />
🎧 Julie's mom didn't want to have to touch the dirty bird.<br />
🎧 Julie put one of her old baby blankets on the bottom of a deep storage bin. <br />
🎧 While Julie tried to feed the injured bird bits of moist bread, Julie's mom looked online for local animal rescue organizations. <br />
🎧 She felt silly trying to save a pigeon though. <br />
🎧 Finally she found an organization that would take the bird, but not until the next morning. <br />
🎧 Julie stayed up all night watching the bird.<br />
🎧 The next morning Julia and her mother took the subway to the bird rescue organization. <br />
🎧 Many people on the train gave Julie and her mother strange looks. <br />
🎧 Julie's mother just shrugged. <br />
🎧 When they got to the rescue organization, Julie told the worker, Please take good care of Sebastian.<br />

🎧 You want me to buy you what? Ken asked Elizabeth. <br />
🎧 He was sure he hadn't heard her correctly. <br />
🎧 Elizabeth had just moved in with Ken. <br />
🎧 She came to Los Angeles from New York City after a year of long distance dating. <br />
🎧 I want you to buy me a shopping cart, Elizabeth repeated. <br />
🎧 In Los Angeles there are two types of people who use shopping carts. The homeless are one. They use shopping carts to carry their possessions. Old ladies are the second. They use it to carry their laundry back and forth, their groceries, and maybe even to sell tamales, Ken explained.<br />
🎧 Elizabeth felt insulted. <br />
🎧 Are you saying I'm an old lady? she asked. <br />
🎧 She then continued to explain that she didn't want to rely on Ken to drive her to the supermarket or the laundromat. <br />
🎧 Elizabeth didn't know how to drive, but she wanted to be self-sufficient. <br />
🎧 Besides, she continued, in New York City everyone has a shopping cart, not just the homeless or old ladies.<br />
🎧 One afternoon when Elizabeth came home from work, there was a red shopping cart in the driveway. <br />
🎧 Ken had put a big red bow on it. <br />
🎧 Do you like your new wheels? Ken asked Elizabeth. <br />
🎧 She felt happy now that she could handle some chores on her own.<br />
🎧 The next day she loaded the shopping cart with dirty clothes and set off to walk the three blocks to the nearest laundromat. <br />
🎧 This was not as easy as she thought. <br />
🎧 The sidewalks were uneven and the cart often got stuck, causing dirty socks to leap out of the cart. <br />
🎧 Elizabeth had to stop several times to pick up stray clothes. <br />
🎧 Then nearly every house between her house and the laundromat had a big dog that barked at her. <br />
🎧 Elizabeth hated big scary dogs.<br />

🎧 Maria received a Facebook notification on her mobile phone, which says: You have a new message from Jimmy. <br />
🎧 Maria didn't know any Jimmy except an ex-boyfriend ten years ago. <br />
🎧 Maria opened the message and sure enough it was from the man she dated a long time ago.<br />
🎧 You should Google me and see what I've been up to, the message said. <br />
🎧 Maria thought the message was strange, but out of curiosity, she typed in Jimmy's full name in the Google search bar. <br />
🎧 She saw pictures of him and a number of articles. <br />
🎧 The articles were about him filing for divorce from his wife who was a high school teacher in New York City. <br />
🎧 She had been accused of having an affair with one of her students. <br />
🎧 She had been fired and was facing criminal charges. <br />
🎧 She had a daughter with Jimmy, a successful attorney.<br />
🎧 Is your mind blown? Jimmy wrote in a separate Facebook message after a while. <br />
🎧 Maria didn't know if she should respond. <br />
🎧 Why was he reaching out to her after so many years? <br />
🎧 Did he want her to know he was divorced so that they could date again? <br />
🎧 Maria decided to play along. <br />
🎧 Yes, my mind is blown, and I hope things have settled down for you and your daughter, Maria typed. <br />
🎧 Jimmy didn't respond that night. <br />
🎧 Maria thought it would be the last time she heard from Jimmy.<br />
🎧 A week later Maria received another Facebook notification. <br />
🎧 It was another message from Jimmy. <br />
🎧 I was hoping that you would have time in your busy schedule to see me, the message read. <br />
🎧 Maria hesitated. <br />
🎧 When they stopped dating years ago, it was because Jimmy had written a cruel message to her. <br />
🎧 Should she give him another chance?<br />
