<h2>At the Convenience Store</h2>

🎧 Hey there! Do you have any <span>gluten-free</span> <span>snacks</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, we do! Right over there in <span>aisle</span> <span>3</span>, <span>we've</span> got some <span>gluten-free</span> <span>chips</span> and <span>protein</span> <span>bars</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Awesome</span>! I'll check those out. <span>Oh</span>, I'll also <span>grab</span> a <span>bottle</span> of <span>sparkling</span> water. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Great <span>choice</span>! We have a few <span>flavors</span> in the <span>fridge</span> if you want to take a look. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I'll go with the <span>lemon-lime</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Perfect</span>! <span>That'll</span> be <span>$88.50</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Here you go. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks! Enjoy your <span>snacks</span>! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Hey, do you have any <span>energy</span> <span>drinks</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yep</span>! We have a <span>whole</span> <span>section</span> in the <span>cooler</span>. It's next to the <span>snacks</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Cool</span>! I'll check it out. <span>Oh</span>, and do you have any <span>sugar-free</span> <span>options</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, we do! Just look for the <span>labels;</span> they're <span>marked</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Got one. How much is it? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>That'll</span> be <span>$3.25</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks. By the way, do you sell phone <span>chargers</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Sure do! We have a few different <span>types</span>. Here they are. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 This one is <span>perfect</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Okay</span>. Is that everything? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yep</span>, that's it. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 All right, your <span>total</span> is <span>$10.50</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Hi there! Do you have any <span>fresh</span> <span>fruit</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, we do! <span>We've</span> got <span>apples</span>, <span>bananas</span>, and some <span>oranges</span> over by the <span>front</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Great! I'll take a <span>couple</span> of <span>bananas</span>. And I also need some <span>avocados</span>, too. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I'm <span>afraid</span> we ran out of <span>avocados</span>. We should have more in <span>tomorrow</span> if you want to check back. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 That sounds good. I'll just <span>grab</span> some <span>bananas</span> then. And do you have any <span>yogurt</span>? <span><br/></span>

<h2>A Visit to the Doctor</h2>

🎧 Good morning, <span>John</span>. How are you today? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Morning, <span>Doc</span>. I'm <span>okay</span>, I <span>guess</span>. Just here for my <span>regular</span> <span>checkup</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Great, let's get <span>started</span>. Any <span>concerns</span> or <span>symptoms</span> you want to <span>discuss</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Actually</span>, yeah. I've been having some <span>abdominal</span> <span>pain</span> and <span>cramping</span> <span>lately</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I see. How often does that <span>happen</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It <span>varies</span>, but I've <span>noticed</span> it <span>happens</span> more when I eat <span>certain</span> <span>foods</span>. <span>Plus</span>, I've been <span>bloated</span>, <span>gassy</span>, and sometimes I either have <span>diarrhea</span> or <span>constipation</span>. It's <span>frustrating</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 That does sound <span>uncomfortable</span>. Have you <span>noticed</span> any <span>patterns</span> with your <span>diet</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, I think <span>certain</span> things like <span>dairy</span> and <span>spicy</span> <span>foods</span> might <span>trigger</span> it, but I'm not sure. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It sounds like you might be <span>dealing</span> with <span>irritable</span> <span>bowel</span> <span>syndrome</span>, or <span>IBS</span>. Let's talk about some <span>dietary</span> changes that could help. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>IBS</span>? What does that mean for me? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It <span>means</span> we need to pay <span>attention</span> to what you're <span>eating</span>. <span>Reducing</span> <span>high-fat</span> <span>foods</span>, <span>increasing</span> <span>fiber</span> <span>gradually</span>, and <span>keeping</span> a food <span>diary</span> can help <span>identify</span> <span>triggers</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Sounds <span>manageable</span>. What about <span>medication</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I'm going to <span>prescribe</span> you a <span>medication</span> that can help with the <span>cramps</span> and <span>discomfort</span>. It should <span>ease</span> your <span>symptoms</span> a bit. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks, <span>Doc</span>. I <span>appreciate</span> it. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Of course! Let's <span>schedule</span> a <span>follow-up</span> in a <span>month</span> to see how you're doing with the changes. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Sounds good. I'll do my best. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 That's the <span>spirit</span>! Take <span>care</span>, <span>John</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 You too, <span>Doc</span>. Thanks <span>again.<br/>
</span> <span><br/></span> 

<h2>At the Dentist</h2>

🎧 Let's take a look at your <span>x-rays</span>. It looks like you have some <span>overcrowding</span> and a bit of <span>misalignment</span>. I <span>recommend</span> <span>braces</span> to help <span>straighten</span> everything out. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Braces</span>? Really? I thought I was too old for that. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Not at all! It's quite <span>common</span> for <span>adults</span> to get <span>braces</span>. We have <span>several</span> <span>options</span> you can choose from. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Like what? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We have <span>traditional</span> <span>metal</span> <span>braces</span>, <span>ceramic</span> <span>braces</span>, and even <span>clear</span> <span>aligners</span> like <span>Invisalign</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hm</span>, what's the <span>difference</span> in <span>terms</span> of <span>visibility</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Well, <span>metal</span> <span>braces</span> are the most <span>visible</span>, but they're very <span>effective</span>. <span>Ceramic</span> <span>braces</span> <span>blend</span> in more with your <span>teeth</span>, so they're less <span>noticeable</span>. <span>Invisalign</span> is <span>completely</span> <span>clear</span>, but it <span>requires</span> more <span>discipline</span> to <span>wear</span> them for the <span>recommended</span> <span>hours</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Gotcha</span>. What about the <span>price</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>metal</span> <span>braces</span> <span>cost</span> <span>$3,000</span>. The <span>ceramic</span> <span>braces</span> are a bit more, around <span>$4,000</span>. <span>Invisalign</span> is around <span>$4,500</span>, but it <span>varies</span> <span>based</span> on your <span>treatment</span> plan. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Okay</span>, I see. I think I <span>prefer</span> the <span>ceramic</span> <span>braces</span> since I want something less <span>noticeable</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Great <span>choice</span>! They'll work well for you. Let's get you <span>started</span> with the next <span>steps</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Awesome</span>! I'm <span>excited</span> to see the <span>results</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 You will be <span>amazed</span>! Let's <span>schedule</span> your <span>appointment</span> for the <span>fitting.<br/>
