<h2>At the Convenience Store</h2>

🎧 Hey there! Do you have any <span>gluten-free</span> <span>snacks</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, we do! Right over there in <span>aisle</span> <span>3</span>, <span>we've</span> got some <span>gluten-free</span> <span>chips</span> and <span>protein</span> <span>bars</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Awesome</span>! I'll check those out. Oh, I'll also <span>grab</span> a <span>bottle</span> of <span>sparkling</span> water. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Great <span>choice</span>! We have a few <span>flavors</span> in the <span>fridge</span> if you want to take a look. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I'll go with the <span>lemon-lime</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Perfect</span>! <span>That'll</span> be <span>$8.50</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Here you go. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks! Enjoy your <span>snacks</span>! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Hey, do you have any <span>energy</span> <span>drinks</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yep</span>! We have a <span>whole</span> <span>section</span> in the <span>cooler</span>. It's next to the <span>snacks</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Cool</span>! I'll check it out. Oh, and do you have any <span>sugar-free</span> <span>options</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, we do! Just look for the <span>labels;</span> they're <span>marked</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Got one. How much is it? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>That'll</span> be <span>$3.25</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks. By the way, do you sell phone <span>chargers</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Sure do! We have a few different <span>types</span>. Here they are. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 This one is <span>perfect</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Okay. Is that everything? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yep</span>, that's it. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 All right, your <span>total</span> is <span>$10.50</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Hi there! Do you have any <span>fresh</span> <span>fruit</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, we do! <span>We've</span> got <span>apples</span>, <span>bananas</span>, and some <span>oranges</span> over by the <span>front</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Great! I'll take a <span>couple</span> of <span>bananas</span>. And I also need some <span>avocados</span>, too. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I'm <span>afraid</span> we ran out of <span>avocados</span>. We should have more in <span>tomorrow</span> if you want to check back. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 That sounds good. I'll just <span>grab</span> some <span>bananas</span> then. And do you have any <span>yogurt</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We do! It's in the <span>dairy</span> <span>section</span> at the back. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 What <span>types</span> of <span>yogurt</span> do you have? <span><br/></span>

🎧 I'll pay by <span>card</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Thank you! Here you go. Have a great day! <span><br/>
</span> <span><br/></span> 

<h2>A Visit to the Doctor</h2>

🎧 Good morning, <span>John</span>. How are you today? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Morning, <span>Doc</span>. I'm okay, I <span>guess</span>. Just here for my <span>regular</span> <span>checkup</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Great, let's get <span>started</span>. Any <span>concerns</span> or <span>symptoms</span> you want to <span>discuss</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Actually</span>, yeah. I've been having some <span>abdominal</span> <span>pain</span> and <span>cramping</span> <span>lately</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I see. How often does that <span>happen</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It <span>varies</span>, but I've <span>noticed</span> it <span>happens</span> more when I eat <span>certain</span> <span>foods</span>. <span>Plus</span>, I've been <span>bloated</span>, <span>gassy</span>, and sometimes I either have <span>diarrhea</span> or <span>constipation</span>. It's <span>frustrating</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 That does sound <span>uncomfortable</span>. Have you <span>noticed</span> any <span>patterns</span> with your <span>diet</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, I think <span>certain</span> things like <span>dairy</span> and <span>spicy</span> <span>foods</span> might <span>trigger</span> it, but I'm not sure. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It sounds like you might be <span>dealing</span> with <span>irritable</span> <span>bowel</span> <span>syndrome</span>, or <span>IBS</span>. Let's talk about some <span>dietary</span> changes that could help. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>IBS</span>? What does that mean for me? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It <span>means</span> we need to pay <span>attention</span> to what you're <span>eating</span>. <span>Reducing</span> <span>high-fat</span> <span>foods</span>, <span>increasing</span> <span>fiber</span> <span>gradually</span>, and <span>keeping</span> a food <span>diary</span> can help <span>identify</span> <span>triggers</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Sounds <span>manageable</span>. What about <span>medication</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I'm going to <span>prescribe</span> you a <span>medication</span> that can help with the <span>cramps</span> and <span>discomfort</span>. It should <span>ease</span> your <span>symptoms</span> a bit. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks, <span>Doc</span>. I <span>appreciate</span> it. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Of course! Let's <span>schedule</span> a <span>follow-up</span> in a <span>month</span> to see how you're doing with the changes. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Sounds good. I'll do my best. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 That's the <span>spirit</span>! Take <span>care</span>, <span>John</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 You too, <span>Doc</span>. Thanks <span>again.<br/>
</span> <span><br/></span> 

<h2>At the Dentist</h2>

🎧 Let's take a look at your <span>x-rays</span>. It looks like you have some <span>overcrowding</span> and a bit of <span>misalignment</span>. I <span>recommend</span> <span>braces</span> to help <span>straighten</span> everything out. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Braces</span>? Really? I thought I was too old for that. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Not at all! It's quite <span>common</span> for <span>adults</span> to get <span>braces</span>. We have <span>several</span> <span>options</span> you can choose from. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Like what? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We have <span>traditional</span> <span>metal</span> <span>braces</span>, <span>ceramic</span> <span>braces</span>, and even <span>clear</span> <span>aligners</span> like <span>Invisalign</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hm</span>, what's the <span>difference</span> in <span>terms</span> of <span>visibility</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Well, <span>metal</span> <span>braces</span> are the most <span>visible</span>, but they're very <span>effective</span>. <span>Ceramic</span> <span>braces</span> <span>blend</span> in more with your <span>teeth</span>, so they're less <span>noticeable</span>. <span>Invisalign</span> is <span>completely</span> <span>clear</span>, but it <span>requires</span> more <span>discipline</span> to <span>wear</span> them for the <span>recommended</span> <span>hours</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Gotcha</span>. What about the <span>price</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>metal</span> <span>braces</span> <span>cost</span> <span>$3,000</span>. The <span>ceramic</span> <span>braces</span> are a bit more, around <span>$4,000</span>. <span>Invisalign</span> is around <span>$4,500</span>, but it <span>varies</span> <span>based</span> on your <span>treatment</span> plan. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Okay, I see. I think I <span>prefer</span> the <span>ceramic</span> <span>braces</span> since I want something less <span>noticeable</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Great <span>choice</span>! They'll work well for you. Let's get you <span>started</span> with the next <span>steps</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Awesome</span>! I'm <span>excited</span> to see the <span>results</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 You will be <span>amazed</span>! Let's <span>schedule</span> your <span>appointment</span> for the <span>fitting.<br/>
</span><br/>

<h2>At the Pizza Place</h2>

🎧 Hi, <span>welcome</span> to <span>Tony's</span> <span>Pizza</span> Place! Are you <span>ready</span> to <span>order</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Hi, yes, we're <span>ready</span>. I'll have the <span>barbecue</span> <span>chicken</span> <span>pizza</span>, please. Can I get <span>extra</span> <span>chicken</span> and red <span>onions</span> on that? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Of course! And what kind of <span>crust</span> would you like with that? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Thin</span> <span>crust</span>, please, and could it be a small size? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Got it! And for you, sir? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I'll have the <span>Caprese</span> <span>pizza</span>. Could I get <span>extra</span> <span>basil</span> and <span>cherry</span> <span>tomatoes</span>, but <span>hold</span> the <span>balsamic</span> <span>glaze</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Absolutely! What size and <span>crust</span> would you like? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Medium</span> size, and could I get a <span>stuffed</span> <span>crust</span>, please? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Stuffed</span> <span>crust</span> it is! Would you like any <span>drinks</span> to go with that? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 What do you <span>recommend</span> for a <span>refreshing</span> <span>drink</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Our <span>homemade</span> <span>lemonade</span> is quite <span>popular</span>. It's <span>sweet</span> and <span>tangy</span>, <span>perfect</span> for <span>pairing</span> with <span>pizza</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Sounds good! I'll add the <span>lemonade</span> then. Do you have any <span>specialty</span> <span>sodas</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, we have a <span>selection</span> of <span>craft</span> <span>sodas</span>. Do you have a <span>preference</span> for <span>flavor</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 What do you <span>recommend</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>Cherry</span> <span>Cola</span> is a <span>customer</span> <span>favorite</span>. It's <span>rich</span> and <span>bubbly</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I'll go with the <span>Cherry</span> <span>Cola</span> then, thank you! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Great <span>choices</span>! I'll be right back with your <span>drinks.<br/>
</span><br/>

<h2>Shopping for the Perfect Tracksuit</h2>

🎧 Hi, I'm <span>looking</span> for a <span>tracksuit</span> for my <span>sports</span> class. Do you have any in size <span>S</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Of course! We have a great <span>selection</span>. Let me <span>show</span> you a few <span>options</span>. Here's our first <span>option:</span> this <span>one's</span> a <span>navy</span> <span>blue</span> <span>tracksuit</span>. It's made from <span>breathable</span> <span>material</span> and has a nice <span>fitted</span> look. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, that looks nice! Is it <span>stretchy</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, it has a bit of <span>spandex</span>, so it's very <span>flexible</span>. It's <span>priced</span> at <span>$45</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Great! What about this one? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Good <span>choice</span>! This <span>black</span> one has a <span>slightly</span> <span>looser</span> fit, <span>perfect</span> for <span>comfort</span>. It's <span>$50</span>, but it's on <span>sale</span> for <span>$40</span> today. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 And how about this red one? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The red one is <span>super</span> <span>popular</span>. It's <span>lightweight</span> and <span>moisture-wicking</span>. It's <span>$35</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 That's the <span>cheapest</span> one! Is it <span>durable</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Absolutely! It's <span>designed</span> for <span>active</span> <span>wear</span>, so it <span>holds</span> up well in <span>sports</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I think I'll go with the red one. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Perfect</span> <span>choice</span>! Let's get you set up in the <span>fitting</span> <span>room</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It <span>fits</span> <span>perfectly</span>. I'll take it. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Great! Let's check you out at the <span>register</span>. <span><br/>
</span> <span><br/></span> 

<h2>At the Barbers</h2>

🎧 Hey there! What can I do for you today? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Hey, I need a <span>haircut</span> and a <span>shave</span>, but <span>honestly</span>, I'm not sure what <span>style</span> I should go for. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 No <span>worries</span>, man! Let's <span>figure</span> it out. What's your <span>usual</span> <span>style</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I usually just go with whatever. I was thinking maybe something different this time. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 All right, how about I <span>show</span> you a few <span>options</span>? You could go for a <span>classic</span> <span>crew</span> cut, a nice <span>fade</span>, or even something like a <span>buzz</span> cut, where the <span>length</span> of <span>hair</span> is the same on all <span>parts</span> of the <span>head</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I've never <span>tried</span> a <span>buzz</span> cut. What's a <span>crew</span> cut like? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 A <span>crew</span> cut is <span>short</span> on the <span>sides</span> and back, with a bit more <span>length</span> on top. It's <span>clean</span> and <span>easy</span> to <span>manage</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Sounds good! And what about the <span>fade</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 A <span>fade</span> <span>gradually</span> <span>shortens</span> the <span>hair</span> from top to <span>bottom</span>, <span>creating</span> a nice <span>blend</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I like the sound of that, but I think I want something really low <span>maintenance</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Then I'd <span>recommend</span> the <span>buzz</span> cut! <span>Super</span> low <span>maintenance</span>, and it looks <span>sharp</span>. <span>Plus</span>, it's a good look for a <span>fresh</span> start. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 You know what? Let's do the <span>buzz</span> cut, and I definitely need that <span>shave</span> too. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Got it! I'll make you look <span>sharp</span>. Let's get <span>started</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks, man! I've been <span>needing</span> this. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 No <span>problem</span>, you're in good <span>hands</span>. Let's make you look <span>fresh!<br/>
</span><br/>

<h2>At the Hospital</h2>

🎧 Hey there, what <span>brings</span> you in today? Are you okay? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Uh</span>, well, my <span>hand</span> <span>feels</span> like it's been through a <span>blender</span>, but other than that, I <span>guess</span> I'm okay. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Let's take a look at that <span>hand</span> of <span>yours</span>. What <span>happened</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 So I was trying to fix this <span>leaky</span> tap in my <span>kitchen</span> <span>—</span> you know, the <span>classic</span> <span>DIY</span> <span>project</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Ah</span>, the <span>infamous</span> <span>DIY</span> <span>project</span> <span>gone</span> wrong! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Exactly! I thought I could <span>save</span> a few <span>bucks</span>, but <span>apparently</span>, I'm no <span>plumber</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Well, let's see what we're working with. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It's not <span>pretty</span>. I cut my <span>hand</span> <span>badly</span> on the <span>pipe</span>. <span>Yikes</span>! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 That sounds <span>painful</span>. Did you at <span>least</span> <span>turn</span> off the water first? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Of course! I'm not <span>completely</span> <span>reckless</span>. I just didn't <span>expect</span> it to be so <span>sharp</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 All right, it's a bit <span>deep</span>. I'm going to <span>clean</span> it up, and we might need to <span>stitch</span> it. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Stitch</span> it? Like <span>actually</span> <span>sew</span> it up? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yep</span>, just a few <span>stitches</span>, but you'll be back to your <span>DIY</span> <span>adventures</span> in no time. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Great, just what I <span>needed</span> <span>—</span> an <span>excuse</span> to <span>avoid</span> <span>fixing</span> my <span>sink</span> <span>forever</span>! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Well, at <span>least</span> you have a good <span>story</span> now. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>True</span>! Next time, I'll <span>call</span> a <span>professional</span>. <span><br/>
</span> <span><br/></span>

<h2>Decorating the House</h2>

🎧 So, <span>Edward</span>, what do you <span>envision</span> for this <span>space</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Well, I want something <span>cozy</span>, where I can <span>relax</span> and <span>entertain</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 How about <span>starting</span> with a <span>large</span> <span>sectional</span> <span>sofa</span>? It'll be <span>perfect</span> for <span>lounging</span> and <span>hosting</span> friends. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, a <span>sectional</span> sounds great, maybe in a <span>light</span> <span>yellow</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Love that <span>choice</span>! We could <span>pair</span> it with some <span>white</span> and <span>green</span> <span>pillows</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 That sounds <span>perfect</span>. What about a <span>coffee</span> <span>table</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, a <span>round</span> one would be nice for <span>conversations</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 And maybe a few <span>plants</span> around? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Great idea! A <span>couple</span> of <span>tall</span> <span>potted</span> <span>plants</span> behind the <span>sofa</span> would really <span>liven</span> up the <span>space</span>. <span>Speaking</span> of which, how do you feel about <span>wall</span> <span>art</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, some <span>abstract</span> <span>pieces</span> would be great. They could go between the <span>plants</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Perfect</span>! <span>Abstract</span> <span>art</span> would really add some <span>character</span>. Do you have any <span>thoughts</span> on what kind of <span>rug</span> you might want? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I was thinking something <span>plush</span> and <span>neutral</span>, like a <span>cream</span> or <span>light</span> <span>gray</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 That's a great <span>choice</span>. And what about some <span>lighting</span>? A nice <span>floor</span> <span>lamp</span> next to the <span>sectional</span> could <span>create</span> a <span>warm</span> <span>glow</span> in the <span>evenings</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I love that idea! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Now, what about a <span>TV</span> set? Do you have a <span>specific</span> <span>spot</span> in <span>mind</span> for it? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I was thinking of <span>putting</span> it on that <span>wall</span> <span>opposite</span> the <span>sofa</span>. It would be <span>perfect</span> for <span>movie</span> <span>nights</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Perfect</span>! We could even add some <span>shelves</span> for <span>books</span> or <span>decor</span> <span>items</span> around it. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I can't wait to see it all come together! <span><br/>
</span> <span><br/></span>

<h2>Renting an Apartment</h2>

🎧 Wow, this place is <span>amazing</span>! It <span>feels</span> so <span>spacious</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Right? The high <span>ceilings</span> and those big <span>windows</span> really make a <span>difference</span>. You get a <span>ton</span> of <span>natural</span> <span>light</span> here. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I love that! How much is the <span>rent</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It's <span>listed</span> at <span>$1,200</span> a <span>month</span>. That <span>includes</span> water and <span>trash</span> <span>removal</span>, by the way. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Okay, that's <span>within</span> my <span>budget</span>. What about the <span>security</span> <span>deposit</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It's usually one <span>month's</span> <span>rent</span>, so <span>$1,200</span>. It's <span>standard</span> for most <span>places</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Got it. And how about the <span>neighborhood</span>? What's it like around here? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 You're going to love it! It's a <span>vibrant</span> <span>area</span> with <span>lots</span> of <span>cafes</span>, <span>parks</span>, and <span>shops</span>. The <span>local</span> <span>farmers'</span> <span>market</span> is just a <span>couple</span> of <span>blocks</span> away on <span>Sundays</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 That sounds <span>perfect</span>. I've been <span>looking</span> for something with a <span>community</span> <span>vibe</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Absolutely! <span>Plus</span>, there's a great gym just around the <span>corner</span> and a <span>couple</span> of <span>co-working</span> <span>spaces</span> if you ever need to work outside of home. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, that's really <span>convenient</span>. How's the <span>public</span> <span>transport</span> <span>situation</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>subway</span> <span>station</span> is a <span>5-minute</span> <span>walk</span>. You can get to <span>downtown</span> in less than <span>15</span> <span>minutes</span> <span>—</span> <span>super</span> <span>easy</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Nice! And how's the <span>noise</span> <span>level</span>? I've had some bad <span>experiences</span> with that. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 This <span>building</span> has <span>excellent</span> <span>soundproofing</span>. You'll <span>hardly</span> hear anything from the <span>street</span>, and the <span>neighbors</span> are <span>pretty</span> <span>quiet</span> too. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 That's a <span>relief</span>! I can't <span>deal</span> with <span>noisy</span> <span>neighbors</span>. <span>Ooh</span>, I love this <span>kitchen</span>! Are the <span>appliances</span> new? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, they were <span>installed</span> just last year <span>—</span> <span>stainless</span> <span>steel</span>, <span>energy-efficient</span>, <span>perfect</span> for cooking. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I can see myself <span>hosting</span> dinner <span>parties</span> here. This could really be my home. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I think it would be a <span>perfect</span> fit for you. Want to check out the <span>bedroom</span> next? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Absolutely! Let's go. <span><br/>

<h2>At the Bank</h2>

🎧 Hey there! I'm <span>looking</span> to take out a <span>personal</span> <span>loan</span> for some home <span>improvements</span> <span>—</span> <span>specifically</span>, a <span>kitchen</span> <span>remodel</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Sounds <span>exciting</span>! I'd love to help you with that. Have you ever taken out a <span>loan</span> with us before? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Nope</span>, this is my first time. What do I need to do to get <span>started</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 First, I'll need to <span>gather</span> some <span>information</span> from you. How much are you <span>looking</span> to <span>borrow</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I was thinking around <span>$15,000</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Okay, and do you have a <span>budget</span> for your <span>monthly</span> <span>payments</span> in <span>mind</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, I'd like to keep it under <span>$300</span> a <span>month</span> if <span>possible</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 That's a good plan. Next, I'll need to see some <span>documents</span> like <span>proof</span> of <span>income</span>, your <span>credit</span> <span>score</span>, and a <span>list</span> of your <span>current</span> <span>debts</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Okay, I can get that. Is there anything else? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Just a <span>valid</span> <span>ID</span>, and maybe some <span>details</span> about your home. Once I have everything, we can <span>process</span> your <span>application</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Sounds <span>easy</span> enough. How long does it usually take, <span>typically</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 You'll hear back <span>within</span> a few <span>days</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Awesome</span>! I'll get those <span>documents</span> together and come back soon. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Looking</span> forward to it! Have a good <span>day.<br/>
