🎧 I play <span>guitar</span> in a <span>band</span> with my friends. I love music and <span>performing</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Interesting</span>! What do you <span>value</span> most in a <span>career</span> <span>–</span> money, <span>creativity</span>, <span>helping</span> <span>others</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I want to do something <span>creative</span> but also make a <span>positive</span> <span>impact</span> on <span>people's</span> lives. Money is <span>important</span>, but it's not my <span>main</span> <span>focus</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 That's a good start, <span>Jake</span>. Have you thought about <span>professions</span> in the <span>arts</span> or <span>social</span> work? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Not really. Can you give me some <span>examples</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Sure! You could <span>consider</span> <span>becoming</span> a <span>teacher</span>, <span>journalist</span>, <span>musician</span>, or even a <span>therapist</span>. These <span>careers</span> <span>align</span> with your <span>interests</span> and <span>values</span>. How does that sound? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Wow, I never thought about those <span>options</span>. Thank you, <span>Mrs</span>. <span>Gomez</span>. I feel a lot better now. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I'm glad I could help, <span>Jake</span>. <span>Remember</span>, it's <span>okay</span> to <span>explore</span> different <span>paths</span> before <span>making</span> a <span>decision</span>. Just <span>follow</span> your <span>interests</span> and <span>passion.<br/>
