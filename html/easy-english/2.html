<h2>Having a Blood Test in the Lab</h2>

ðŸŽ§ <span>Hello</span> there, are you here for a <span>blood</span> <span>test</span> today? <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Yes, but <span>I'm</span> <span>scared</span>. <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>There's</span> <span>nothing</span> to <span>worry</span> about, <span>Claire</span>. My name is <span>Nurse</span> <span>Jess</span>, and <span>I'm</span> here to help you through it. <span>It's</span> really <span>quick</span> and <span>won't</span> <span>hurt</span> much, I <span>promise</span>. <span><br/></span>

ðŸŽ§ <span>Okay</span>, Mom. <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ First, <span>let's</span> sit down here. <span>I'll</span> tie this <span>band</span> around your <span>armâ€”it</span> might feel a bit <span>tight</span>, but <span>don't</span> <span>worry</span>, it helps me see your <span>vein</span> <span>clearly</span>. Now, <span>I'm</span> going to <span>clean</span> the <span>area</span> with a <span>cotton</span> <span>pad</span>, and then <span>I'll</span> use this small <span>needle</span> for the <span>blood</span> <span>test</span>. <span>You'll</span> feel a <span>tiny</span> <span>poke</span>, but <span>it'll</span> be over before you know it. <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Great <span>job</span>, <span>Claire</span>! You did so well. As a <span>reward</span> for being so <span>brave</span>, you get to choose a <span>sticker</span> and a <span>lollipop</span> from our special <span>collection</span>. Which <span>ones</span> do you like? <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>I'd</span> like this <span>sticker</span> and this <span>lollipop</span>. Thank you, <span>Nurse</span> <span>Jess</span>! <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>You're</span> so <span>welcome</span>, <span>Claire</span>! You were very <span>brave</span> today. <span><br/>

ðŸŽ§ Sounds like <span>we'll</span> never get <span>bored</span>. How about the <span>cost</span> of the <span>cruise</span>? <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ The <span>price</span> for the <span>11-day</span> <span>European</span> <span>cruise</span> for two is <span>$4,000</span>. This <span>includes</span> all <span>meals</span>, <span>activities</span>, most <span>onboard</span> <span>amenities</span>, and <span>port</span> <span>fees</span>. <span><br/></span>

ðŸŽ§ Got it! Anything else we should <span>consider</span>? <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Definitely <span>bring</span> a <span>flashlight</span>, <span>mosquito</span> <span>repellent</span> to keep those <span>bugs</span> away, and a first <span>aid</span> <span>kit</span> just in case. <span><br/></span>

ðŸŽ§ Hey, <span>Mrs</span>. <span>Gomez</span>. I'm really <span>lost</span> about what <span>career</span> <span>path</span> to choose. I have no <span>clue</span>. <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ That's <span>perfectly</span> <span>normal</span>, <span>Jake</span>. Let's <span>figure</span> this out together. Can you tell me what <span>subjects</span> you enjoy the most in school? <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I really like English and <span>history</span>. I like <span>writing</span> and <span>learning</span> about the <span>past</span>. <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Great! What about your <span>hobbies</span> or <span>extracurricular</span> <span>activities</span>? <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I play <span>guitar</span> in a <span>band</span> with my friends. I love music and <span>performing</span>. <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Interesting</span>! What do you <span>value</span> most in a <span>career</span> <span>â€“</span> money, <span>creativity</span>, <span>helping</span> <span>others</span>? <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I want to do something <span>creative</span> but also make a <span>positive</span> <span>impact</span> on <span>people's</span> lives. Money is <span>important</span>, but it's not my <span>main</span> <span>focus</span>. <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ That's a good start, <span>Jake</span>. Have you thought about <span>professions</span> in the <span>arts</span> or <span>social</span> work? <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Not really. Can you give me some <span>examples</span>? <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Sure! You could <span>consider</span> <span>becoming</span> a <span>teacher</span>, <span>journalist</span>, <span>musician</span>, or even a <span>therapist</span>. These <span>careers</span> <span>align</span> with your <span>interests</span> and <span>values</span>. How does that sound? <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Wow, I never thought about those <span>options</span>. Thank you, <span>Mrs</span>. <span>Gomez</span>. I feel a lot better now. <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I'm glad I could help, <span>Jake</span>. <span>Remember</span>, it's <span>okay</span> to <span>explore</span> different <span>paths</span> before <span>making</span> a <span>decision</span>. Just <span>follow</span> your <span>interests</span> and <span>passion.<br/>
