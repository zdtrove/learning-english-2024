ðŸŽ§ Hello there, are you here for a <span>blood</span> <span>test</span> today? <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Yes, but I'm <span>scared</span>. <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>There's</span> <span>nothing</span> to <span>worry</span> about, <span>Claire</span>. My name is <span>Nurse</span> <span>Jess</span>, and I'm here to help you through it. It's really <span>quick</span> and <span>won't</span> <span>hurt</span> much, I <span>promise</span>. <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ It's all right, <span>honey</span>. <span>Nurse</span> <span>Jess</span> is very good at her <span>job</span>, and <span>we'll</span> take <span>care</span> of you. <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Okay, Mom. <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ First, <span>let's</span> sit down here. I'll tie this <span>band</span> around your <span>armâ€”it</span> might feel a bit <span>tight</span>, but don't <span>worry</span>, it helps me see your <span>vein</span> <span>clearly</span>. Now, I'm going to <span>clean</span> the <span>area</span> with a <span>cotton</span> <span>pad</span>, and then I'll use this small <span>needle</span> for the <span>blood</span> <span>test</span>. <span>You'll</span> feel a <span>tiny</span> <span>poke</span>, but <span>it'll</span> be over before you know it. <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Great <span>job</span>, <span>Claire</span>! You did so well. As a <span>reward</span> for being so <span>brave</span>, you get to choose a <span>sticker</span> and a <span>lollipop</span> from our special <span>collection</span>. Which <span>ones</span> do you like? <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>I'd</span> like this <span>sticker</span> and this <span>lollipop</span>. Thank you, <span>Nurse</span> <span>Jess</span>! <span></span><br/>

ðŸŽ§ I'll need you to change into this <span>hospital</span> <span>gown</span> here to <span>ensure</span> we get a <span>clear</span> <span>image</span> of your <span>chest</span>. You can leave your <span>socks</span> on but please <span>remove</span> any <span>jewelry</span>, <span>eyeglasses</span>, or <span>metal</span> <span>objects</span>. <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Got it. Let me change <span>real</span> <span>quick</span>. <span></span><br/>

ðŸŽ§ Like this? <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Exactly! <span>Stay</span> still and don't move while the <span>X-ray</span> is being taken. Now, I'll need you to take a <span>deep</span> <span>breath</span> in, <span>hold</span> it for a few <span>seconds</span>, then <span>breathe</span> out. Great, we got the <span>images</span> we need! You did a great <span>job;</span> you can get <span>changed</span> back into your <span>clothes</span> now. <span>We'll</span> have your <span>results</span> ready <span>shortly</span>. <span></span><br/>

ðŸŽ§ Hi there, we're <span>looking</span> to book a <span>cruise</span> for our <span>honeymoon</span>. <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Congratulations</span> on your <span>wedding</span>! Where are you thinking of going? <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ We were thinking of <span>exploring</span> <span>Europe</span> for about <span>11</span> <span>days</span>. Can you tell us more about the <span>itinerary</span> for that? <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Of course! Our <span>Europe</span> <span>cruise</span> <span>typically</span> <span>includes</span> <span>stops</span> in <span>popular</span> <span>cities</span> like <span>Barcelona</span>, <span>Rome</span>, <span>Venice</span>, and more. <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ That sounds <span>amazing</span>. What about the <span>ship</span> <span>itself</span>? What kind of <span>amenities</span> does it <span>offer</span>? <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Our <span>ship</span> is <span>equipped</span> with <span>luxurious</span> <span>cabins</span>, fine <span>dining</span> <span>restaurants</span>, a <span>spa</span>, <span>pools</span>, <span>entertainment</span> <span>facilities</span>, and even a gym. <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ What <span>activities</span> are <span>available</span> on <span>board</span> during the <span>cruise</span>? <span></span><br/>

ðŸŽ§ Sounds like <span>we'll</span> never get <span>bored</span>. How about the <span>cost</span> of the <span>cruise</span>? <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ The <span>price</span> for the <span>11-day</span> <span>European</span> <span>cruise</span> for two is <span>$4,000</span>. This <span>includes</span> all <span>meals</span>, <span>activities</span>, most <span>onboard</span> <span>amenities</span>, and <span>port</span> <span>fees</span>. <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Great! That all sounds <span>perfect</span>. <span>We're</span> really <span>excited</span> to book this <span>cruise</span> for our <span>honeymoon</span>. <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I'm <span>thrilled</span> to help you both plan this special <span>trip</span>. <span>Let's</span> get you all set up for an <span>unforgettable</span> <span>honeymoon</span> <span>cruise</span> through <span>Europe</span>. <span><br/></span> <span></span><br/>

ðŸŽ§ Hi! We're planning a <span>hiking</span> <span>trip</span>, and we need some <span>gear</span>. Can you help us out? <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Of course! I'd be happy to help. What <span>items</span> are you <span>looking</span> for? <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, we already have a <span>tent</span> at home, but we'll need <span>pretty</span> much everything else. <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I <span>recommend</span> getting some good <span>quality</span> <span>sleeping</span> <span>bags</span>.

ðŸŽ§ Yeah, those would definitely come in <span>handy</span>. What else do you <span>recommend</span>? <span></span><br/>

ðŸŽ§ Got it! Anything else we should <span>consider</span>? <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Definitely <span>bring</span> a <span>flashlight</span>, <span>mosquito</span> <span>repellent</span> to keep those <span>bugs</span> away, and a first <span>aid</span> <span>kit</span> just in case. <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Thanks for the advice! We'll <span>grab</span> those <span>items</span> too. <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ All set! You <span>guys</span> are going to have a <span>fantastic</span> <span>hiking</span> <span>trip</span> with all these <span>essentials</span>. <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Thanks so much for your help! Now we can hit the <span>trails</span> with <span>confidence</span>.<br/> <span></span><br/>

ðŸŽ§ Sounds good to me! Do you have any <span>student</span> <span>discounts</span> or <span>promotions</span>? <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Sorry, no <span>student</span> <span>discounts</span> for this movie, but you can get a free small <span>popcorn</span> with a <span>combo</span> <span>purchase</span>. We have a <span>combo</span> <span>deal</span> where you can get a <span>popcorn</span>, drink, and <span>candy</span> for the <span>price</span> of two <span>items</span>. It's a great <span>deal</span>. <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Cool</span>! We'll take the <span>combo</span>. Thanks for all the <span>info</span>. <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ No <span>problem</span>! Enjoy the movie, <span>guys</span>.<br/> <span></span><br/>

ðŸŽ§ Hello, <span>Jake</span>. How can I help you today? <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Hey, Mrs. <span>Gomez</span>. I'm really <span>lost</span> about what <span>career</span> <span>path</span> to choose. I have no <span>clue</span>. <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ That's <span>perfectly</span> <span>normal</span>, <span>Jake</span>. Let's <span>figure</span> this out together. Can you tell me what <span>subjects</span> you enjoy the most in school? <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I really like English and <span>history</span>. I like <span>writing</span> and <span>learning</span> about the <span>past</span>. <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Great! What about your <span>hobbies</span> or <span>extracurricular</span> <span>activities</span>? <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I play <span>guitar</span> in a <span>band</span> with my friends. I love music and <span>performing</span>. <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Interesting</span>! What do you <span>value</span> most in a <span>career</span> <span>â€“</span> money, <span>creativity</span>, <span>helping</span> <span>others</span>? <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I want to do something <span>creative</span> but also make a <span>positive</span> <span>impact</span> on <span>people's</span> lives. Money is <span>important</span>, but it's not my <span>main</span> focus. <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ That's a good start, <span>Jake</span>. Have you thought about <span>professions</span> in the <span>arts</span> or <span>social</span> work? <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Not really. Can you give me some <span>examples</span>? <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Sure! You could <span>consider</span> <span>becoming</span> a <span>teacher</span>, <span>journalist</span>, <span>musician</span>, or even a <span>therapist</span>. These <span>careers</span> <span>align</span> with your <span>interests</span> and <span>values</span>. How does that sound? <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Wow, I never thought about those <span>options</span>. Thank you, Mrs. <span>Gomez</span>. I feel a lot better now. <span></span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I'm glad I could help, <span>Jake</span>. <span>Remember</span>, it's okay to <span>explore</span> different <span>paths</span> before <span>making</span> a <span>decision</span>. Just <span>follow</span> your <span>interests</span> and <span>passion</span>.<br/><br/><br/>
