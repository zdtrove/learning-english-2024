🎧 Hello there, are you here for a <span>blood</span> <span>test</span> today? <span></span><br/> 
🎧 Yes, but I'm <span>scared</span>. <span></span><br/> 
🎧 <span>There's</span> <span>nothing</span> to <span>worry</span> about, <span>Claire</span>. My name is <span>Nurse</span> <span>Jess</span>, and I'm here to help you through it. It's really <span>quick</span> and <span>won't</span> <span>hurt</span> much, I <span>promise</span>. <span></span><br/> 
🎧 It's all right, <span>honey</span>. <span>Nurse</span> <span>Jess</span> is very good at her <span>job</span>, and <span>we'll</span> take <span>care</span> of you. <span></span><br/> 
🎧 Okay, Mom. <span></span><br/> 
🎧 First, <span>let's</span> sit down here. I'll tie this <span>band</span> around your <span>arm—it</span> might feel a bit <span>tight</span>, but don't <span>worry</span>, it helps me see your <span>vein</span> <span>clearly</span>. Now, I'm going to <span>clean</span> the <span>area</span> with a <span>cotton</span> <span>pad</span>, and then I'll use this small <span>needle</span> for the <span>blood</span> <span>test</span>. <span>You'll</span> feel a <span>tiny</span> <span>poke</span>, but <span>it'll</span> be over before you know it. <span></span><br/> 
🎧 Great <span>job</span>, <span>Claire</span>! You did so well. As a <span>reward</span> for being so <span>brave</span>, you get to choose a <span>sticker</span> and a <span>lollipop</span> from our special <span>collection</span>. Which <span>ones</span> do you like? <span></span><br/> 
🎧 <span>I'd</span> like this <span>sticker</span> and this <span>lollipop</span>. Thank you, <span>Nurse</span> <span>Jess</span>! <span></span><br/>

Great, we got the <span>images</span> we need! You did a great <span>job;</span> you can get <span>changed</span> back into your <span>clothes</span> now. <span>We'll</span> have your <span>results</span> ready <span>shortly</span>. <span></span><br/>

🎧 Hello, <span>Jake</span>. How can I help you today? <span></span><br/> 
🎧 Hey, Mrs. <span>Gomez</span>. I'm really <span>lost</span> about what <span>career</span> <span>path</span> to choose. I have no <span>clue</span>. <span></span><br/> 
🎧 That's <span>perfectly</span> <span>normal</span>, <span>Jake</span>. Let's <span>figure</span> this out together. Can you tell me what <span>subjects</span> you enjoy the most in school? <span></span><br/> 
🎧 I really like English and <span>history</span>. I like <span>writing</span> and <span>learning</span> about the <span>past</span>. <span></span><br/> 
🎧 Great! What about your <span>hobbies</span> or <span>extracurricular</span> <span>activities</span>? <span></span><br/> 
🎧 I play <span>guitar</span> in a <span>band</span> with my friends. I love music and <span>performing</span>. <span></span><br/> 
🎧 <span>Interesting</span>! What do you <span>value</span> most in a <span>career</span> <span>–</span> money, <span>creativity</span>, <span>helping</span> <span>others</span>? <span></span><br/> 
🎧 I want to do something <span>creative</span> but also make a <span>positive</span> <span>impact</span> on <span>people's</span> lives. Money is <span>important</span>, but it's not my <span>main</span> focus. <span></span><br/> 
🎧 That's a good start, <span>Jake</span>. Have you thought about <span>professions</span> in the <span>arts</span> or <span>social</span> work? <span></span><br/> 
🎧 Not really. Can you give me some <span>examples</span>? <span></span><br/> 
🎧 Sure! You could <span>consider</span> <span>becoming</span> a <span>teacher</span>, <span>journalist</span>, <span>musician</span>, or even a <span>therapist</span>. These <span>careers</span> <span>align</span> with your <span>interests</span> and <span>values</span>. How does that sound? <span></span><br/> 
🎧 Wow, I never thought about those <span>options</span>. Thank you, Mrs. <span>Gomez</span>. I feel a lot better now. <span></span><br/> 
🎧 I'm glad I could help, <span>Jake</span>. <span>Remember</span>, it's okay to <span>explore</span> different <span>paths</span> before <span>making</span> a <span>decision</span>. Just <span>follow</span> your <span>interests</span> and <span>passion</span>.<br/><br/><br/>
