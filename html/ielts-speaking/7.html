<h2 id="ies-7-61">[061] Voice</h2>

<p>1. Do you like recording and hearing your (own) voice?</p>
<p>Not at all! To be honest, I don't like the sound of my voice, as I've always been told it's very deep for a woman. I've even been mistaken as a man on the phone before! Because of this, I've never liked my voice.</p>

<p>2. Do any members of your family have a similar voice (or, similar voices)?</p>
<p>Not really. Mine is very unique. My father has a southern accent, and my sister has more of a girly-girl (very feminine) accent. So, I'm the odd ball out (the strange one) with my deep voice.</p>

<p>3. Are there any situations when your voice changes?</p>
<p>Yes- for example when I talk on the phone to clients at work. I usually put on a more polite voice and always maintain a positive tone. On the other hand, I talk more freely with my friends and family on the phone, without concern of whether I sound polite or not.</p>

<p>4. Is your voice the same now as it was when you were younger?</p>
<p>Not really. It's always been deep, but it's definitely gotten deeper as I've aged. Furthermore, now that I'm an English teacher, I've begun to enunciate (pronounce clearly) my words better so that language learners can understand me. </p>

<h2 id="ies-7-62">[062] Jeans</h2>

<p>1. Do you like wearing jeans?</p>
<p>Not too much. For some reason, I don't feel attractive when I wear them. I much prefer a dress or romper instead. When I wear jeans, I feel too plain and not elegant enough. Furthermore, it's hot and humid where I live, so jeans tend to stick to me.</p>

<p>2. How often do you wear jeans?</p>
<p>Just from December to February, as my city is constantly hot. I wear them for casual outfits and sometimes even dress them up with a cute top and heels to go out at night. However, in the summer, as little clothes as possible is best in my city with its heat.</p>

<p>3. When did you start wearing jeans?</p>
<p>Ever since I can remember! Jeans are a stitch (centra)l in all of our wardrobes in my country. My parents dressed me in jeans ever since I was a small child, and I've carried this through to adulthood.</p>

<p>4. Did you wear jeans at school?</p>
<p>No, never. As I attended a Catholic school, I was always obligated to wear a uniform, which consisted of a button-up blouse, pleated skirt, knee high socks, and dress shoes. We occasionally had dress-down (casual) days where we could wear our own clothes, though. In that case, yes I wore jeans.</p>

<p>5. Would you say jeans are popular in your country?</p>
<p>Very much so! They are an essential. People wear them in all different shapes, sizes, and colors. Along with blue jeans, people also like to wear black, white, and bright colored jeans. Moreover, people tend to dress up black or white jeans for work quite often.</p>

<p>6. Would you buy an expensive pair of jeans?</p>
<p>Hmm, perhaps. I would much rather buy an expensive dress or high heels, but I can see how buying a pair of expensive jeans in worthwhile (meaningful). For example, you may buy a pair of Levi jeans that last you a lifetime!</p>

<h2 id="ies-7-63">[063] Concentration</h2>

<p>1. When do you need to stay (or, be) focused?</p>
<p>As I'm a freelancer (someone who does independent work online), I really need to hone in (focus in) on getting my work done. I tend to space out (become unfocused) when I have to sit down and finish a task, so I really need to work on that to be more efficient. Furthermore, I need to concentrate on finding a new house, as my lease will expire soon.</p>

<p>2. Do you ever find it difficult to stay focused (= hard to concentrate)?</p>
<p>Every day. I tend to have a lot running through my mind, so it's hard to focus in on just one thing. When I try to read or work on an independent project, my mind tends to wander (go without direction) and I usually turn to checking my phone and searching unrelated topics.</p>

<p>3. What distracts you when you're trying to stay focused?</p>
<p>Number one: my phone! I get distracted when I receive a text message or email, then lose my current thought and think about that. Furthermore, if I try not to respond, I will obsess over it until I finally put down my work to address it. Aside from this, I get distracted when I'm going through certain personal problems, such as a break-up or family dilemma (problem).</p>

<p>4. What d o you do to help you concentrate?</p>
<p>When I sit down to do work, I make a point of (try) putting my phone on silent and away from me. Furthermore, I do exercise before which often brings my mind back to focus. Lastly, I try to work in a quiet place, such as my bedroom, which doesn't have many distractions around.</p>
