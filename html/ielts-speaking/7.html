🎧 Alright, Now I'm going to ask you some detailed questions on the same subject. What kind of toys do you think are more suitable for kids?<br/> 
🎧 Well, I suppose, it depends on the age. If they are toddlers or kids probably something pretty safe, such as stuffed toys, dolls something without jagged edges or without sharp edges. Something really keep them away from dangers, but when they grow older, I think, when they go to 5 or 6 years, it's better to give them something more educational to keep their mind more active, give them some more challenging games such as board games, chess , etc.<br/>
🎧 Do you think parents should choose children's toys?<br/> 
🎧 Obviously, I suppose parents should supervise the kind of toys the children use because children are not mature enough to recognize the rights and wrongs that is sometimes, they go to types of toys that are not quite good for them, it's dangerous and it's not safe; some guns are made. So, I suppose it's better to have supervision over the type of toys basically they use. Especially these days, there are different types of computer games in the market; so definitely, in that sense it has to filtered and supervised.<br/>
🎧 How has the type of toys that the children play with change in recent years in your opinion?<br/> 
🎧 I can tell you it has dramatically changed since I was a child, I can tell you those days, I used to play safe toys such as stuffed dolls, teddy bears, balls, plastic balls and something really safe. However, these days I notice that younger generation, children and different ages tend to play with modern toys from gun shots to different toys and they also spend time playing different type of violent game which is not at all useful for them. So I suppose, unfortunately, there is a tendency towards more from violent games to dangerous games these days.<br/>
🎧 Thank you very much, Pooneh, your speaking test now is now over.<br/>
🎧 Thank you very much and have a nice day

🎧 Good Afternoon. Come in please.<br/>
🎧 Good Afternoon. Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Have a seat.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Well, can I have a look at your passport?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, of course.<br/>
🎧 Thanks. And may I have your full name please?<br/> 
🎧 My name is Naghmeh Sadeghian.<br/>
🎧 OK Naghmeh, it's a nice name.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 What is the meaning of your name?<br/> 
🎧 Well, my name means song or melody in the Persian language, in Farsi.<br/>
🎧 OK, thanks. Do you think your name has an impact on your character and personality?<br/> 
🎧 Well I haven't given this much thought, but I think maybe because it means melody and song, it affects people's perception of my character. Perhaps this sort of cheerful name makes them expect a cheerful character, which I try to be, but obviously am not all the time. But no, I don't think it affects my character as a person.<br/>
🎧 Alright Naghmeh. Let's move on to another question. Is your health important to you?<br/> 
🎧 I think everybody's health is important to them. l think we all try to do our best to lead a healthy life, but whether or not we succeed is a different question.<br/>
🎧 What do you do to improve your health?<br/> 
🎧 Not as much as I should, to be honest. I don't think I eat as healthily as I should, and I probably need to exercise a lot more, and possibly cut down on my caffeine intake.<br/>
🎧 What is the major health concern in your country at the moment?<br/> 
🎧 I think like many other countries globally, our main health concern must be the N1H1 virus, which is also known as swine flu. The reason being that apparently it is taking on the form of a pandemic, which is very worrying due to the large population in my country. I do believe that the government is trying to control this with the guidelines and help of the World Health Organisation, and hopefully this will be under control soon.<br/>
🎧 OK, thanks Naghmeh. Do you like cooking?<br/> 
🎧 I do. I do like cooking, but unfortunately due to my being a student I don't find enough time to cook as regularly as I should.<br/>
🎧 OK, thanks. What kind of food do you like?<br/> 
🎧 Well, I enjoy a vast majority of the foods that I've tasted and experienced. I'm very fond of my country's local cuisine, but I also really enjoy a nice Italian or Chinese meal.<br/>
🎧 OK, thanks. Naghmeh, what are the most famous dishes of your country?<br/> 
🎧 Well, it would be difficult to name a few famous dishes or specialties, because I think each area of the country has its own specialty which people enjoy. But I think on an international level, I could perhaps say Chelo Kebab which consists of grilled meat accompanied by rice. Chelo means rice, and kebab means grilled meat. This meat can be any form. It can be beef, or lamb, chicken, or even minced meat, normally with a combination of onion. Traditionally the meat is pulled onto skewers and cooked over a charcoal fire.<br/>
🎧 OK thanks. And tell me, in your country have people's eating habits changed?<br/> 
🎧 Well I honestly don't think that this is just limited to my country. I think over the ages, people's living habits have changed, and also life has taken on a much faster pace. So I think that has reflected, maybe not very positively, on people's eating habits. You tend to catch a meal on the run. A lot of times a lot of people are constantly in a hurry, so they can't sit down and enjoy a proper meal during the day. Of course it's good to take the time out and do this at least once a day in order to help your digestion and also focus on healthier foods.<br/>
🎧 OK, thank you very much Naghmeh. Now we move on to another topic. I would like you to describe an old person you've met. And in fact you have to talk about the topic for about two minutes. You have once minute to think about the topic. Here is a paper and a pencil. You can write down notes if you wish.<br/>
🎧 Thank you

🎧 Alright Naghmeh, now I would like to ask a few more detailed questions about the same topic. What are the problems of old people in your country?<br/> 
🎧 I think the problem of old people worldwide, irrespective of their country, is that perhaps, in some cases, they don't receive the attention and respect that they should after all the hard work that they've done. I think old people tend to suffer from loneliness. Obviously this is not very beneficial to them because it affects their health. Also, there are cases obviously, where old people are distant from their immediate family or they have none left, and therefore they are put into nursing homes. In some cases, this might even happen with immediate family available.<br/>
🎧 What do most old people do in your country?<br/> 
🎧 Old people in my country I think enjoy getting together with their family and exchanging stories, and advising the youngers in their family how to lead their lives properly. I think the old people in my country become very sociable. They going out a lot. If they're healthy enough, I think they all like to go to the park, meet new people. Basically, I think they enjoy any activity that involves interaction with other people.<br/>
🎧 Do you think old people should be kept in nursing homes?<br/> 
🎧 Well actually, I don't agree with nursing homes unless it's the last option. Old people should be taken care of by the people that they've taken care of before, such as their children and close relatives. But of course there are exceptions where people are too ill, or they need special care, in which case a well-equipped environment would be to their benefit.<br/>
🎧 And the last question: What can the government do to improve the life of senior citizens?<br/> 
🎧 I think governments can do a lot by allocating funds to develop social gathering places for the elderly where they can meet and convene with their peers. I also think that the elderly should have access to free medical treatment and medication, because at the end of the day this is the generation that raised all these doctors and people in the society. And I think also another point might be for the government to improve the conditions in nursing homes, so that they're all uniformly equipped to take care of those who need to be there.<br/>
🎧 Thank you very much Naghmeh. This is the end of the interview. Thank you very much and have a nice day.<br/>
🎧 Thank you very much. <br/>
