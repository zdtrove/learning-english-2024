ðŸŽ§ Alright, Now I'm going to ask you some <span>detailed</span> <span>questions</span> on the same <span>subject</span>. What kind of <span>toys</span> do you think are more <span>suitable</span> for <span>kids</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, I <span>suppose</span>, it <span>depends</span> on the age. If they are <span>toddlers</span> or <span>kids</span> probably something <span>pretty</span> <span>safe</span>, such as <span>stuffed</span> <span>toys</span>, <span>dolls</span> something without <span>jagged</span> <span>edges</span> or without <span>sharp</span> <span>edges</span>. Something really keep them away from <span>dangers</span>, but when they <span>grow</span> <span>older</span>, I think, when they go to <span>5</span> or <span>6</span> years, it's better to give them something more <span>educational</span> to keep their <span>mind</span> more <span>active</span>, give them some more <span>challenging</span> <span>games</span> such as <span>board</span> <span>games</span>, <span>chess</span> , <span>etc</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you think <span>parents</span> should choose <span>children's</span> <span>toys</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Obviously</span>, I <span>suppose</span> <span>parents</span> should <span>supervise</span> the kind of <span>toys</span> the children use because children are not <span>mature</span> enough to <span>recognize</span> the <span>rights</span> and <span>wrongs</span> that is sometimes, they go to <span>types</span> of <span>toys</span> that are not quite good for them, it's <span>dangerous</span> and it's not <span>safe;</span> some <span>guns</span> are made. So, I <span>suppose</span> it's better to have <span>supervision</span> over the <span>type</span> of <span>toys</span> <span>basically</span> they use. <span>Especially</span> these <span>days</span>, there are different <span>types</span> of <span>computer</span> <span>games</span> in the <span>market;</span> so definitely, in that <span>sense</span> it has to <span>filtered</span> and <span>supervised</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ How has the <span>type</span> of <span>toys</span> that the children play with change in <span>recent</span> years in your <span>opinion</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I can tell you it has <span>dramatically</span> <span>changed</span> since I was a <span>child</span>, I can tell you those <span>days</span>, I used to play <span>safe</span> <span>toys</span> such as <span>stuffed</span> <span>dolls</span>, <span>teddy</span> <span>bears</span>, <span>balls</span>, <span>plastic</span> <span>balls</span> and something really <span>safe</span>. <span>However</span>, these <span>days</span> I <span>notice</span> that <span>younger</span> <span>generation</span>, children and different <span>ages</span> <span>tend</span> to play with <span>modern</span> <span>toys</span> from gun <span>shots</span> to different <span>toys</span> and they also <span>spend</span> time playing different <span>type</span> of <span>violent</span> game which is not at all <span>useful</span> for them. So I <span>suppose</span>, <span>unfortunately</span>, there is a <span>tendency</span> <span>towards</span> more from <span>violent</span> <span>games</span> to <span>dangerous</span> <span>games</span> these <span>days</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Thank you very much, <span>Pooneh</span>, your <span>speaking</span> <span>test</span> now is now over.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Thank you very much and have a nice <span>day
</span>.<br/> <br/>

ðŸŽ§ Good <span>Afternoon</span>. Come in please.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Good <span>Afternoon</span>. Thank you.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Have a <span>seat</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Thank you.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Well, can I have a look at your <span>passport</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Yes, of course.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Thanks. And may I have your full name please?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ My name is <span>Naghmeh</span> <span>Sadeghian</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ OK <span>Naghmeh</span>, it's a nice name.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Thank you.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What is the <span>meaning</span> of your <span>name</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, my name <span>means</span> <span>song</span> or <span>melody</span> in the <span>Persian</span> <span>language</span>, in <span>Farsi</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ OK, thanks. Do you think your name has an <span>impact</span> on your <span>character</span> and <span>personality</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Well I haven't <span>given</span> this much thought, but I think maybe because it <span>means</span> <span>melody</span> and <span>song</span>, it <span>affects</span> <span>people's</span> <span>perception</span> of my <span>character</span>. <span>Perhaps</span> this <span>sort</span> of <span>cheerful</span> name makes them <span>expect</span> a <span>cheerful</span> <span>character</span>, which I try to be, but <span>obviously</span> am not all the time. But no, I don't think it <span>affects</span> my <span>character</span> as a person.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Alright <span>Naghmeh</span>. Let's move on to another <span>question</span>. Is your <span>health</span> important to you?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I think <span>everybody's</span> <span>health</span> is important to them. <span>l</span> think we all try to do our best to <span>lead</span> a <span>healthy</span> life, but <span>whether</span> or not we <span>succeed</span> is a different <span>question</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What do you do to <span>improve</span> your <span>health</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Not as much as I should, to be <span>honest</span>. I don't think I eat as <span>healthily</span> as I should, and I probably need to <span>exercise</span> a lot more, and <span>possibly</span> cut down on my <span>caffeine</span> <span>intake</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What is the <span>major</span> <span>health</span> <span>concern</span> in your <span>country</span> at the <span>moment</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I think like many other <span>countries</span> <span>globally</span>, our <span>main</span> <span>health</span> <span>concern</span> must be the <span>N1H1</span> <span>virus</span>, which is also <span>known</span> as <span>swine</span> flu. The <span>reason</span> being that <span>apparently</span> it is taking on the <span>form</span> of a <span>pandemic</span>, which is very <span>worrying</span> due to the <span>large</span> <span>population</span> in my <span>country</span>. I do <span>believe</span> that the <span>government</span> is trying to <span>control</span> this with the <span>guidelines</span> and help of the <span>World</span> <span>Health</span> <span>Organisation</span>, and <span>hopefully</span> this will be under <span>control</span> soon.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ OK, thanks <span>Naghmeh</span>. Do you like <span>cooking</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I do. I do like cooking, but <span>unfortunately</span> due to my being a student I don't find enough time to <span>cook</span> as <span>regularly</span> as I should.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ OK, thanks. What kind of food do you <span>like</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, I enjoy a <span>vast</span> <span>majority</span> of the <span>foods</span> that I've <span>tasted</span> and <span>experienced</span>. I'm very <span>fond</span> of my <span>country's</span> <span>local</span> <span>cuisine</span>, but I also really enjoy a nice <span>Italian</span> or <span>Chinese</span> <span>meal</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ OK, thanks. <span>Naghmeh</span>, what are the most famous <span>dishes</span> of your <span>country</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, it would be <span>difficult</span> to name a few famous <span>dishes</span> or <span>specialties</span>, because I think each <span>area</span> of the <span>country</span> has its own <span>specialty</span> which people enjoy. But I think on an <span>international</span> <span>level</span>, I could <span>perhaps</span> say <span>Chelo</span> <span>Kebab</span> which <span>consists</span> of <span>grilled</span> <span>meat</span> <span>accompanied</span> by <span>rice</span>. <span>Chelo</span> <span>means</span> <span>rice</span>, and <span>kebab</span> <span>means</span> <span>grilled</span> <span>meat</span>. This <span>meat</span> can be any <span>form</span>. It can be <span>beef</span>, or <span>lamb</span>, <span>chicken</span>, or even <span>minced</span> <span>meat</span>, <span>normally</span> with a <span>combination</span> of <span>onion</span>. <span>Traditionally</span> the <span>meat</span> is <span>pulled</span> <span>onto</span> <span>skewers</span> and <span>cooked</span> over a <span>charcoal</span> <span>fire</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ OK thanks. And tell me, in your <span>country</span> have <span>people's</span> <span>eating</span> <span>habits</span> <span>changed</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Well I <span>honestly</span> don't think that this is just <span>limited</span> to my <span>country</span>. I think over the <span>ages</span>, <span>people's</span> living <span>habits</span> have <span>changed</span>, and also life has taken on a much <span>faster</span> <span>pace</span>. So I think that has <span>reflected</span>, maybe not very <span>positively</span>, on <span>people's</span> <span>eating</span> <span>habits</span>. You <span>tend</span> to catch a <span>meal</span> on the run. A lot of <span>times</span> a lot of people are <span>constantly</span> in a <span>hurry</span>, so they can't sit down and enjoy a <span>proper</span> <span>meal</span> during the day. Of course it's good to take the time out and do this at <span>least</span> once a day in <span>order</span> to help your <span>digestion</span> and also focus on <span>healthier</span> <span>foods</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ OK, thank you very much <span>Naghmeh</span>. Now we move on to another <span>topic</span>. I would like you to <span>describe</span> an old person you've <span>met</span>. And in <span>fact</span> you have to talk about the <span>topic</span> for about two <span>minutes</span>. You have once <span>minute</span> to think about the <span>topic</span>. <span>Here</span> is a <span>paper</span> and a <span>pencil</span>. You can <span>write</span> down <span>notes</span> if you wish.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Thank <span>you
</span>.<br/> <br/>

ðŸŽ§ Alright <span>Naghmeh</span>, now I would like to ask a few more <span>detailed</span> <span>questions</span> about the same <span>topic</span>. What are the <span>problems</span> of old people in your <span>country</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I think the <span>problem</span> of old people <span>worldwide</span>, <span>irrespective</span> of their <span>country</span>, is that <span>perhaps</span>, in some <span>cases</span>, they don't <span>receive</span> the <span>attention</span> and <span>respect</span> that they should after all the <span>hard</span> work that <span>they've</span> done. I think old people <span>tend</span> to <span>suffer</span> from <span>loneliness</span>. <span>Obviously</span> this is not very <span>beneficial</span> to them because it <span>affects</span> their <span>health</span>. Also, there are <span>cases</span> <span>obviously</span>, where old people are <span>distant</span> from their <span>immediate</span> <span>family</span> or they have <span>none</span> <span>left</span>, and <span>therefore</span> they are put into <span>nursing</span> <span>homes</span>. In some <span>cases</span>, this might even <span>happen</span> with <span>immediate</span> <span>family</span> <span>available</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What do most old people do in your <span>country</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Old people in my <span>country</span> I think enjoy getting together with their <span>family</span> and <span>exchanging</span> <span>stories</span>, and <span>advising</span> the <span>youngers</span> in their <span>family</span> how to <span>lead</span> their lives <span>properly</span>. I think the old people in my <span>country</span> become very <span>sociable</span>. They going out a lot. If they're <span>healthy</span> enough, I think they all like to go to the <span>park</span>, meet new people. <span>Basically</span>, I think they enjoy any <span>activity</span> that <span>involves</span> <span>interaction</span> with other people.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you think old people should be <span>kept</span> in <span>nursing</span> <span>homes</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Well actually, I don't agree with <span>nursing</span> <span>homes</span> <span>unless</span> it's the last option. Old people should be taken <span>care</span> of by the people that <span>they've</span> taken <span>care</span> of before, such as their children and <span>close</span> <span>relatives</span>. But of course there are <span>exceptions</span> where people are too ill, or they need special <span>care</span>, in which case a <span>well-equipped</span> <span>environment</span> would be to their <span>benefit</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ And the last <span>question:</span> What can the <span>government</span> do to <span>improve</span> the life of <span>senior</span> <span>citizens</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I think <span>governments</span> can do a lot by <span>allocating</span> <span>funds</span> to <span>develop</span> <span>social</span> <span>gathering</span> <span>places</span> for the <span>elderly</span> where they can meet and <span>convene</span> with their <span>peers</span>. I also think that the <span>elderly</span> should have <span>access</span> to free <span>medical</span> <span>treatment</span> and <span>medication</span>, because at the end of the day this is the <span>generation</span> that <span>raised</span> all these <span>doctors</span> and people in the <span>society</span>. And I think also another <span>point</span> might be for the <span>government</span> to <span>improve</span> the <span>conditions</span> in <span>nursing</span> <span>homes</span>, so that they're all <span>uniformly</span> <span>equipped</span> to take <span>care</span> of those who need to be there.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Thank you very much <span>Naghmeh</span>. This is the end of the <span>interview</span>. Thank you very much and have a nice day.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Thank you very much. <br/>
