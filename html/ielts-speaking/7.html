ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span>, Now <span>I'm</span> <span>going</span> to ask you <span>some</span> <span>detailed</span> <span>questions</span> <span>on</span> the <span>same</span> <span>subject</span>. What <span>kind</span> <span>of</span> <span>toys</span> do you <span>think</span> are <span>more</span> <span>suitable</span> for <span>kids?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span>, I <span>suppose</span>, <span>it</span> <span>depends</span> <span>on</span> the age. <span>If</span> <span>they</span> are <span>toddlers</span> <span>or</span> <span>kids</span> <span>probably</span> <span>something</span> <span>pretty</span> <span>safe</span>, <span>such</span> <span>as</span> <span>stuffed</span> <span>toys</span>, <span>dolls</span> <span>something</span> <span>without</span> <span>jagged</span> <span>edges</span> <span>or</span> <span>without</span> <span>sharp</span> <span>edges</span>. <span>Something</span> <span>really</span> <span>keep</span> <span>them</span> <span>away</span> <span>from</span> <span>dangers</span>, but when <span>they</span> <span>grow</span> <span>older</span>, I <span>think</span>, when <span>they</span> <span>go</span> to <span>5</span> <span>or</span> <span>6</span> <span>years</span>, it's <span>better</span> to <span>give</span> <span>them</span> <span>something</span> <span>more</span> <span>educational</span> to <span>keep</span> <span>their</span> <span>mind</span> <span>more</span> <span>active</span>, <span>give</span> <span>them</span> <span>some</span> <span>more</span> <span>challenging</span> <span>games</span> <span>such</span> <span>as</span> <span>board</span> <span>games</span>, <span>chess</span> <span></span>, <span>etc</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>think</span> <span>parents</span> <span>should</span> <span>choose</span> <span>children's</span> <span>toys?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Obviously</span>, I <span>suppose</span> <span>parents</span> <span>should</span> <span>supervise</span> the <span>kind</span> <span>of</span> <span>toys</span> the <span>children</span> use <span>because</span> <span>children</span> are not <span>mature</span> <span>enough</span> to <span>recognize</span> the <span>rights</span> and <span>wrongs</span> <span>that</span> <span>is</span> <span>sometimes</span>, <span>they</span> <span>go</span> to <span>types</span> <span>of</span> <span>toys</span> <span>that</span> are not <span>quite</span> <span>good</span> for <span>them</span>, it's <span>dangerous</span> and it's not <span>safe;</span> <span>some</span> <span>guns</span> are <span>made</span>. So, I <span>suppose</span> it's <span>better</span> to have <span>supervision</span> <span>over</span> the <span>type</span> <span>of</span> <span>toys</span> <span>basically</span> <span>they</span> use. <span>Especially</span> <span>these</span> <span>days</span>, there are <span>different</span> <span>types</span> <span>of</span> <span>computer</span> <span>games</span> <span>in</span> the <span>market;</span> so <span>definitely</span>, <span>in</span> <span>that</span> <span>sense</span> <span>it</span> has to <span>filtered</span> and <span>supervised</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ How has the <span>type</span> <span>of</span> <span>toys</span> <span>that</span> the <span>children</span> <span>play</span> <span>with</span> <span>change</span> <span>in</span> <span>recent</span> <span>years</span> <span>in</span> your <span>opinion?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I can <span>tell</span> you <span>it</span> has <span>dramatically</span> <span>changed</span> <span>since</span> I was a <span>child</span>, I can <span>tell</span> you <span>those</span> <span>days</span>, I <span>used</span> to <span>play</span> <span>safe</span> <span>toys</span> <span>such</span> <span>as</span> <span>stuffed</span> <span>dolls</span>, <span>teddy</span> <span>bears</span>, <span>balls</span>, <span>plastic</span> <span>balls</span> and <span>something</span> <span>really</span> <span>safe</span>. <span>However</span>, <span>these</span> <span>days</span> I <span>notice</span> <span>that</span> <span>younger</span> <span>generation</span>, <span>children</span> and <span>different</span> <span>ages</span> <span>tend</span> to <span>play</span> <span>with</span> <span>modern</span> <span>toys</span> <span>from</span> gun <span>shots</span> to <span>different</span> <span>toys</span> and <span>they</span> <span>also</span> <span>spend</span> <span>time</span> <span>playing</span> <span>different</span> <span>type</span> <span>of</span> <span>violent</span> <span>game</span> which <span>is</span> not <span>at</span> all <span>useful</span> for <span>them</span>. So I <span>suppose</span>, <span>unfortunately</span>, there <span>is</span> a <span>tendency</span> <span>towards</span> <span>more</span> <span>from</span> <span>violent</span> <span>games</span> to <span>dangerous</span> <span>games</span> <span>these</span> <span>days</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you <span>very</span> <span>much</span>, <span>Pooneh</span>, your <span>speaking</span> <span>test</span> now <span>is</span> now <span>over</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you <span>very</span> <span>much</span> and have a <span>nice</span> <span>day.<br/>

ðŸŽ§ <span>Good</span> <span>Afternoon</span>. <span>Come</span> <span>in</span> <span>please</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Good</span> <span>Afternoon</span>. <span>Thank</span> <span>you</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Have a <span>seat</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> <span>you</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span>, can I have a <span>look</span> <span>at</span> your <span>passport?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Yes</span>, <span>of</span> <span>course</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thanks</span>. And may I have your <span>full</span> <span>name</span> <span>please?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ My <span>name</span> <span>is</span> <span>Naghmeh</span> <span>Sadeghian</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>OK</span> <span>Naghmeh</span>, it's a <span>nice</span> <span>name</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> <span>you</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What <span>is</span> the <span>meaning</span> <span>of</span> your <span>name?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span>, my <span>name</span> <span>means</span> <span>song</span> <span>or</span> <span>melody</span> <span>in</span> the <span>Persian</span> <span>language</span>, <span>in</span> <span>Farsi</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>OK</span>, <span>thanks</span>. Do you <span>think</span> your <span>name</span> has an <span>impact</span> <span>on</span> your <span>character</span> and <span>personality?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span> I haven't <span>given</span> <span>this</span> <span>much</span> <span>thought</span>, but I <span>think</span> <span>maybe</span> <span>because</span> <span>it</span> <span>means</span> <span>melody</span> and <span>song</span>, <span>it</span> <span>affects</span> <span>people's</span> <span>perception</span> <span>of</span> my <span>character</span>. <span>Perhaps</span> <span>this</span> <span>sort</span> <span>of</span> <span>cheerful</span> <span>name</span> <span>makes</span> <span>them</span> <span>expect</span> a <span>cheerful</span> <span>character</span>, which I try to be, but <span>obviously</span> <span>am</span> not all the <span>time</span>. But <span>no</span>, I don't <span>think</span> <span>it</span> <span>affects</span> my <span>character</span> <span>as</span> a <span>person</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span> <span>Naghmeh</span>. Let's <span>move</span> <span>on</span> to <span>another</span> <span>question</span>. <span>Is</span> your <span>health</span> <span>important</span> to <span>you?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I <span>think</span> <span>everybody's</span> <span>health</span> <span>is</span> <span>important</span> to <span>them</span>. <span>l</span> <span>think</span> <span>we</span> all try to do our <span>best</span> to <span>lead</span> a <span>healthy</span> <span>life</span>, but <span>whether</span> <span>or</span> not <span>we</span> <span>succeed</span> <span>is</span> a <span>different</span> <span>question</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What do you do to <span>improve</span> your <span>health?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Not <span>as</span> <span>much</span> <span>as</span> I <span>should</span>, to be <span>honest</span>. I don't <span>think</span> I eat <span>as</span> <span>healthily</span> <span>as</span> I <span>should</span>, and I <span>probably</span> <span>need</span> to <span>exercise</span> a lot <span>more</span>, and <span>possibly</span> cut <span>down</span> <span>on</span> my <span>caffeine</span> <span>intake</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What <span>is</span> the <span>major</span> <span>health</span> <span>concern</span> <span>in</span> your <span>country</span> <span>at</span> the <span>moment?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I <span>think</span> <span>like</span> <span>many</span> <span>other</span> <span>countries</span> <span>globally</span>, our <span>main</span> <span>health</span> <span>concern</span> <span>must</span> be the <span>N1H1</span> <span>virus</span>, which <span>is</span> <span>also</span> <span>known</span> <span>as</span> <span>swine</span> flu. The <span>reason</span> <span>being</span> <span>that</span> <span>apparently</span> <span>it</span> <span>is</span> <span>taking</span> <span>on</span> the <span>form</span> <span>of</span> a <span>pandemic</span>, which <span>is</span> <span>very</span> <span>worrying</span> due to the <span>large</span> <span>population</span> <span>in</span> my <span>country</span>. I do <span>believe</span> <span>that</span> the <span>government</span> <span>is</span> <span>trying</span> to <span>control</span> <span>this</span> <span>with</span> the <span>guidelines</span> and <span>help</span> <span>of</span> the <span>World</span> <span>Health</span> <span>Organisation</span>, and <span>hopefully</span> <span>this</span> <span>will</span> be <span>under</span> <span>control</span> <span>soon</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>OK</span>, <span>thanks</span> <span>Naghmeh</span>. Do you <span>like</span> <span>cooking?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I do. I do <span>like</span> <span>cooking</span>, but <span>unfortunately</span> due to my <span>being</span> a <span>student</span> I don't <span>find</span> <span>enough</span> <span>time</span> to <span>cook</span> <span>as</span> <span>regularly</span> <span>as</span> I <span>should</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>OK</span>, <span>thanks</span>. What <span>kind</span> <span>of</span> <span>food</span> do you <span>like?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span>, I <span>enjoy</span> a <span>vast</span> <span>majority</span> <span>of</span> the <span>foods</span> <span>that</span> I've <span>tasted</span> and <span>experienced</span>. <span>I'm</span> <span>very</span> <span>fond</span> <span>of</span> my <span>country's</span> <span>local</span> <span>cuisine</span>, but I <span>also</span> <span>really</span> <span>enjoy</span> a <span>nice</span> <span>Italian</span> <span>or</span> <span>Chinese</span> <span>meal</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>OK</span>, <span>thanks</span>. <span>Naghmeh</span>, what are the <span>most</span> <span>famous</span> <span>dishes</span> <span>of</span> your <span>country?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span>, <span>it</span> <span>would</span> be <span>difficult</span> to <span>name</span> a few <span>famous</span> <span>dishes</span> <span>or</span> <span>specialties</span>, <span>because</span> I <span>think</span> <span>each</span> <span>area</span> <span>of</span> the <span>country</span> has its <span>own</span> <span>specialty</span> which <span>people</span> <span>enjoy</span>. But I <span>think</span> <span>on</span> an <span>international</span> <span>level</span>, I <span>could</span> <span>perhaps</span> say <span>Chelo</span> <span>Kebab</span> which <span>consists</span> <span>of</span> <span>grilled</span> <span>meat</span> <span>accompanied</span> by <span>rice</span>. <span>Chelo</span> <span>means</span> <span>rice</span>, and <span>kebab</span> <span>means</span> <span>grilled</span> <span>meat</span>. <span>This</span> <span>meat</span> can be any <span>form</span>. <span>It</span> can be <span>beef</span>, <span>or</span> <span>lamb</span>, <span>chicken</span>, <span>or</span> <span>even</span> <span>minced</span> <span>meat</span>, <span>normally</span> <span>with</span> a <span>combination</span> <span>of</span> <span>onion</span>. <span>Traditionally</span> the <span>meat</span> <span>is</span> <span>pulled</span> <span>onto</span> <span>skewers</span> and <span>cooked</span> <span>over</span> a <span>charcoal</span> <span>fire</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>OK</span> <span>thanks</span>. And <span>tell</span> me, <span>in</span> your <span>country</span> have <span>people's</span> <span>eating</span> <span>habits</span> <span>changed?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span> I <span>honestly</span> don't <span>think</span> <span>that</span> <span>this</span> <span>is</span> <span>just</span> <span>limited</span> to my <span>country</span>. I <span>think</span> <span>over</span> the <span>ages</span>, <span>people's</span> <span>living</span> <span>habits</span> have <span>changed</span>, and <span>also</span> <span>life</span> has <span>taken</span> <span>on</span> a <span>much</span> <span>faster</span> <span>pace</span>. So I <span>think</span> <span>that</span> has <span>reflected</span>, <span>maybe</span> not <span>very</span> <span>positively</span>, <span>on</span> <span>people's</span> <span>eating</span> <span>habits</span>. You <span>tend</span> to <span>catch</span> a <span>meal</span> <span>on</span> the run. A lot <span>of</span> <span>times</span> a lot <span>of</span> <span>people</span> are <span>constantly</span> <span>in</span> a <span>hurry</span>, so <span>they</span> can't sit <span>down</span> and <span>enjoy</span> a <span>proper</span> <span>meal</span> <span>during</span> the day. <span>Of</span> <span>course</span> it's <span>good</span> to <span>take</span> the <span>time</span> out and do <span>this</span> <span>at</span> <span>least</span> <span>once</span> a day <span>in</span> <span>order</span> to <span>help</span> your <span>digestion</span> and <span>also</span> <span>focus</span> <span>on</span> <span>healthier</span> <span>foods</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>OK</span>, <span>thank</span> you <span>very</span> <span>much</span> <span>Naghmeh</span>. Now <span>we</span> <span>move</span> <span>on</span> to <span>another</span> <span>topic</span>. I <span>would</span> <span>like</span> you to <span>describe</span> an old <span>person</span> you've <span>met</span>. And <span>in</span> <span>fact</span> you have to <span>talk</span> <span>about</span> the <span>topic</span> for <span>about</span> two <span>minutes</span>. You have <span>once</span> <span>minute</span> to <span>think</span> <span>about</span> the <span>topic</span>. <span>Here</span> <span>is</span> a <span>paper</span> and a <span>pencil</span>. You can <span>write</span> <span>down</span> <span>notes</span> <span>if</span> you <span>wish</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> <span>you.<br/>

ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span> <span>Naghmeh</span>, now I <span>would</span> <span>like</span> to ask a few <span>more</span> <span>detailed</span> <span>questions</span> <span>about</span> the <span>same</span> <span>topic</span>. What are the <span>problems</span> <span>of</span> old <span>people</span> <span>in</span> your <span>country?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I <span>think</span> the <span>problem</span> <span>of</span> old <span>people</span> <span>worldwide</span>, <span>irrespective</span> <span>of</span> <span>their</span> <span>country</span>, <span>is</span> <span>that</span> <span>perhaps</span>, <span>in</span> <span>some</span> <span>cases</span>, <span>they</span> don't <span>receive</span> the <span>attention</span> and <span>respect</span> <span>that</span> <span>they</span> <span>should</span> <span>after</span> all the <span>hard</span> <span>work</span> <span>that</span> <span>they've</span> <span>done</span>. I <span>think</span> old <span>people</span> <span>tend</span> to <span>suffer</span> <span>from</span> <span>loneliness</span>. <span>Obviously</span> <span>this</span> <span>is</span> not <span>very</span> <span>beneficial</span> to <span>them</span> <span>because</span> <span>it</span> <span>affects</span> <span>their</span> <span>health</span>. <span>Also</span>, there are <span>cases</span> <span>obviously</span>, where old <span>people</span> are <span>distant</span> <span>from</span> <span>their</span> <span>immediate</span> <span>family</span> <span>or</span> <span>they</span> have <span>none</span> <span>left</span>, and <span>therefore</span> <span>they</span> are put <span>into</span> <span>nursing</span> <span>homes</span>. <span>In</span> <span>some</span> <span>cases</span>, <span>this</span> <span>might</span> <span>even</span> <span>happen</span> <span>with</span> <span>immediate</span> <span>family</span> <span>available</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What do <span>most</span> old <span>people</span> do <span>in</span> your <span>country?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Old <span>people</span> <span>in</span> my <span>country</span> I <span>think</span> <span>enjoy</span> <span>getting</span> <span>together</span> <span>with</span> <span>their</span> <span>family</span> and <span>exchanging</span> <span>stories</span>, and <span>advising</span> the <span>youngers</span> <span>in</span> <span>their</span> <span>family</span> how to <span>lead</span> <span>their</span> <span>lives</span> <span>properly</span>. I <span>think</span> the old <span>people</span> <span>in</span> my <span>country</span> <span>become</span> <span>very</span> <span>sociable</span>. <span>They</span> <span>going</span> out a lot. <span>If</span> they're <span>healthy</span> <span>enough</span>, I <span>think</span> <span>they</span> all <span>like</span> to <span>go</span> to the <span>park</span>, <span>meet</span> new <span>people</span>. <span>Basically</span>, I <span>think</span> <span>they</span> <span>enjoy</span> any <span>activity</span> <span>that</span> <span>involves</span> <span>interaction</span> <span>with</span> <span>other</span> <span>people</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>think</span> old <span>people</span> <span>should</span> be <span>kept</span> <span>in</span> <span>nursing</span> <span>homes?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span> <span>actually</span>, I don't <span>agree</span> <span>with</span> <span>nursing</span> <span>homes</span> <span>unless</span> it's the <span>last</span> <span>option</span>. Old <span>people</span> <span>should</span> be <span>taken</span> <span>care</span> <span>of</span> by the <span>people</span> <span>that</span> <span>they've</span> <span>taken</span> <span>care</span> <span>of</span> <span>before</span>, <span>such</span> <span>as</span> <span>their</span> <span>children</span> and <span>close</span> <span>relatives</span>. But <span>of</span> <span>course</span> there are <span>exceptions</span> where <span>people</span> are too ill, <span>or</span> <span>they</span> <span>need</span> <span>special</span> <span>care</span>, <span>in</span> which <span>case</span> a <span>well-equipped</span> <span>environment</span> <span>would</span> be to <span>their</span> <span>benefit</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ And the <span>last</span> <span>question:</span> What can the <span>government</span> do to <span>improve</span> the <span>life</span> <span>of</span> <span>senior</span> <span>citizens?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I <span>think</span> <span>governments</span> can do a lot by <span>allocating</span> <span>funds</span> to <span>develop</span> <span>social</span> <span>gathering</span> <span>places</span> for the <span>elderly</span> where <span>they</span> can <span>meet</span> and <span>convene</span> <span>with</span> <span>their</span> <span>peers</span>. I <span>also</span> <span>think</span> <span>that</span> the <span>elderly</span> <span>should</span> have <span>access</span> to <span>free</span> <span>medical</span> <span>treatment</span> and <span>medication</span>, <span>because</span> <span>at</span> the end <span>of</span> the day <span>this</span> <span>is</span> the <span>generation</span> <span>that</span> <span>raised</span> all <span>these</span> <span>doctors</span> and <span>people</span> <span>in</span> the <span>society</span>. And I <span>think</span> <span>also</span> <span>another</span> <span>point</span> <span>might</span> be for the <span>government</span> to <span>improve</span> the <span>conditions</span> <span>in</span> <span>nursing</span> <span>homes</span>, so <span>that</span> they're all <span>uniformly</span> <span>equipped</span> to <span>take</span> <span>care</span> <span>of</span> <span>those</span> who <span>need</span> to be <span>there</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you <span>very</span> <span>much</span> <span>Naghmeh</span>. <span>This</span> <span>is</span> the end <span>of</span> the <span>interview</span>. <span>Thank</span> you <span>very</span> <span>much</span> and have a <span>nice</span> <span>day</span>.<br/>
