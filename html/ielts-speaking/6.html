<h2 id="ies-6-51">[051] Playing</h2>

<p>1. Where did you play when you were a child?</p>
<p>As I grew up in an outdoorsy (someone who likes nature) family, I always used to play outside in my yard. Since we lived on a large piece of property that was partly wooded, I often used to play in there and find creatures such as snakes, turtles, salamanders (a lizard-like animal), frogs, or other critters. As a kid, I was never afraid of creepy crawlers (scary insects like spiders)! On rainy days, I would come inside and spend hours by my doll house or coloring.</p>

<p>2. Did you play at your friend's home?</p>
<p>Yes, I did! I had a few best friends, so we would often set up playdates (when parent arrange a time for their kids to play together). All of my friends also had big yards, so we would play tag, jump on the trampoline, play hide and seek, etc. One of my friends had a Nintendo Game Cube which I didn't have, so we would spend hours playing Mario Kart or Super Smash Bros.</p>

<p>3. Did you prefer to play outside or inside when you were young?</p>
<p>Definitely outside! I always had more fun in my sandbox or finding critters (small animals/insects) rather than sitting inside playing games or watching TV. I know that no matter how much I change, I'll always be an outdoorsy person.</p>

<p>4. Do you think it's important for children to play outside?</p>
<p>Very! Nowadays, I feel sad that children are glued to (always attached to) video games and TV rather than spending time taking in breaths of fresh air. Of course some video games and cartoons are okay, but I think children should spend more time outdoors to benefit their mental and physical health.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="ies-6-52">[052] Sports/ Physical Exercises</h2>

<p>1. Do you like to watch sports on TV?</p>
<p>Not at all! I despise (hate) it. I get extremely bored and disinterested. I usually try to avoid watching sports on TV at all costs unless it's an exciting event, like the World Cup or Super Bowl. In that case, I go for the social event rather than the game itself.</p>

<p>2. Do you play any sports?</p>
<p>Not anymore. I was an avid (enthusiastic) swimmer as a child, but I gave that up after high school, as it was quite time-consuming. Nowadays, I enjoy going to the gym, running around the lake by my house, and going on mountain treks. I'm not sure if these are considered sports, but I'm really into physical activity.</p>

<p>3. Which is the popular sports in your country?</p>
<p>Soccer of course! As soccer is the sport of the world, that would be number one. People go wild when our team wins a game- they even drive around waving flags, blocking off the streets! Apart from this, many people enjoy playing tennis and doing martial arts.
</p>

<p>4. Who is your favorite sports star?</p>
<p>As I'm not a big sports fan, I don't really have one. However, I think I may like Cristiano Ronaldo. Although I don't know anything about him or his athletic abilities, I think I've always been drawn to him (attracted to) because of his looks.</p>

<p>5. What kinds of sports would you like to try in the future?</p>
<p>I'm really intrigued by soccer. I think it's something that can really connect people, as well as is good cardiovascular and coordination activity. Actually, I wish I had gotten into it as a child. I think it would be interesting to join a league in my city.</p>

<p>6. Do you do any physical exercise?</p>
<p>You could call me a couch potato (a lazy person who sits on the sofa a lot. "Couch" is another word for sofa). I'm naturally thin without any exercise, so I'm quite lazy when it comes to exercise. I do go for mountain hikes, but I should definitely do more to gain muscle.</p>

<p>7. Do young people in your country like to do exercise?</p>
<p>Gyms are not very popular in my country because of the cost, but I would say that people get their fair share of exercise everyday because of the hills in the city. Many people climb a mountain to their home every single day! I used to live in a house that was unreachable by car and a total of 200 stairs to get there!</p>

<p>8. Do you think people are keen on doing physical activity? Why?</p>
<p>Well, I think they are quite accustomed to it. I don't think they would be too keen on going to the gym, but they really enjoy going on mountain hikes. Since our religion is based upon the Mother Earth and the Mountain Gods, these treks are a spiritual journey.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="ies-6-53">[053] Hometown</h2>

<p>1. Please describe your hometown a little</p>
<p>Where do I begin? My hometown is marvelous. It was the heart of (the center of) the Inca Empire, and is home many ancient Inca ruins, especially Machu Picchu. It lies at 3,100 meters up in the mountains. You can do a lot of trekking, site seeing, visit incredible natural landscapes, etc. It's a perfect mixture of the ancient and modern world.</p>

<p>2. How long have you been living there?</p>
<p>I was born and raised in Cusco. I've lived there for my entire life, except for when I went to Lima, the capital city, to study my Bachelor's Degree. After that, I needed to escape the hustle and bustle (noise from a big city) and come back to my lovely town.</p>

<p>3. What do you like (most) about your hometown?</p>
<p>I love that it's a mix between the ancient and modern world. Furthermore, I like the mix of the indigenous (native people) and Spanish influence. Sometimes it feels like I'm walking in the shoes of the Incas. Furthermore, there is definitely a warm, friendly feel to the town which makes it a pleasant place to live.</p>

<p>4. Would you like to live there in the future?</p>
<p>Although my city is magical, I would consider moving somewhere else in the world. I think sometimes people become too accustomed to (used to) their daily routine. So, perhaps when and if I have a family, I would consider moving to another country in South America or to Spain. It would be our adventure!</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="ies-6-54">[054] Walking</h2>

<p>1.Do you like to walk?</p>
<p>I love it! I'd say it's my preferred method of travel. For one, I feel relaxed when I walk, so I feel it improves my mental health. Furthermore, I like to lead a healthy lifestyle, so walking helps me achieve this.</p>

<p>2. Do you walk very much?</p>
<p>As often as possible. I have to drive to work, but I try to get my steps in by walking to places that are close enough from my house- such as the pharmacy, grocery store, and corner store. Moreover, the weather has been delightful, so I try to go on an evening stroll (walk) at least 3 times a week at sunset.</p>

<p>3. Do you like to walk on your own or with friends?</p>
<p>To be honest, I kind of prefer to walk alone. For one, I'm kind of a slow walker, so I don't like it when other people pressure (pressure somebody to do something to persuade somebody to do something) me to stay at their pace (speed). By the same token, I enjoy the self-reflection time I have when I walk.</p>

<p>4. Would you say your city is a good place for walking?</p>
<p>Not really. For one, it's extremely hot and humid, so that makes it difficult to walk. Furthermore, almost everyone owns a car, so walking isn't very common. However, there are sidewalks and beach promenades (a path for walking on), so walking is a possibility.</p>

<p>5. Do you spend enough time walking?</p>
<p>A fair amount, but I would like to do more. I walk at every opportunity I have, but I would like to integrate it into my daily routine more. For example, maybe I can map out (plan) a way to walk to a public transportation stop to get to work instead of simply jumping in (getting in) my car.</p>

<p>6. Do you walk more often now than (you did) in the past?</p>
<p>Yes, I do. As I've gotten heavier with age, I've started to make changes in my lifestyle, which includes more walking. I notice now that I walk more, I feel more limber (able to stretch).</p>

<p>7. Do you think people will be walking more in the future?</p>
<p>I doubt it. I imagine that as technology continues to advance, less and less people will want to rely on their own two feet. You can even see instances (examples) of this now, as renting bikes and scooters is now the norm (the usual) on every corner.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="ies-6-55">[055] Weather</h2>

<p>1. Do you like hot weather?</p>
<p>I'm used to it. My city is very hot and humid, so it's something I'm built for. I adapt by buying clothes that withstand sweat well, such as cotton or linen. On the other hand, I avoid materials like silk or wool that cause one to sweat more and/or feel sticky.</p>

<p>2. What kind of weather is typical in your hometown?</p>
<p>It's a jungle climate, so it's quite hot all year long. During wet season, it is extremely humid and sticky. For many, the climate is hard to take. For me, I'm used to it. I don't even sweat profusely (sweat a lot).</p>

<p>2. What do you do in hot weather?</p>
<p>Since I live close to the coast, I often go to the beach on hot days. I also have a pool in my apartment complex, so you can often find me there on hot days, as well. On days that are unbearable, I stay inside in the air conditioning and watch TV or go to the gym.</p>

<p>3. What is your favorite season?</p>
<p>I would say dry season. It's difficult to get around during wet season during a downpour since our culture is to go around by motorbike, not to mention that the streets flood easily. All in all, it's a hassle (annoying or difficult). So, I much prefer the dry season since it's a dry, more bearable heat.</p>

<p>3. Would you like to visit a hot country?</p>
<p>Sure! It's something I'm used to. I am interested in countries in Asia and the Middle East, such as India, Cambodia, and Saudi Arabia, and the heat wouldn't stop me from visiting there. I would simply wear breathable clothes and stay inside during the peak heat hours.</p>

<p>4. Do you like wet weather?</p>
<p>No! I don't know why, but I tend to feel a little down in the dumps (depressed) in the rain. I especially feel that way when I wake up in the morning and it's still dark. So, a sunny climate definitely suits me better!</p>

<p>5. How many seasons are there in your place?</p>
<p>Two seasons- wet and dry. They each last about half the year. In wet season, there are downpours (extreme, heavy rain) and it's generally humid and sticky. In dry season, it is a dry heat. I find dry season to be a lot more comfortable although the flora in wet season is more impressive.</p>

<p>7. What kind of weather do you like most?</p>
<p>If I could choose, I would say about 28 degrees, dry, with a cool breeze. This would be ideal whether to go for a motorbike ride around the countryside or lie out on the beach. Since I don't like extremes, this would be perfect for me. </p>

<hr />

<h2 id="ies-6-56">[056] City/ Countryside</h2>

<p>1. Do you like the city you are living in now?</p>
<p>Yes, I really enjoy ABC city. Although it's quite hectic, I love the liveliness of it. Apart from this, I think it's exciting since it is developing at a rapid pace (quickly) and I love the international environment. This city never sleeps!</p>

<p>2. Which city have you been to recently?</p>
<p>I recently visited Bangkok for a short holiday. I had about 3 days free, so I went there to visit the floating market, palaces, Buddhist temples, and vibrant city center.</p>

<p>3. Do you prefer the city or the countryside?</p>
<p>I would say I'm definitely a city person. I enjoy the hustle and bustle (craziness) of city life, along with the endless opportunities to meet new people from all over. I feel too limited in the countryside, not to mention I'm terrified of critters (small animals, like spiders, etc).</p>

<p>4. What kinds of city do you like?</p>
<p>A mix of modern and old. I like when there is an old historic quarter, but also a district with skyscrapers and a more futuristic look. Moreover, I require a city with friendly people and smiles- I couldn't live in fast-paced, robotic (people moving so fast that they don't have any expression) place like New York City for example.</p>

<p>5. Which city do you want to go to?</p>
<p>I've always dreamt of going to San Francisco. I've always seen the Golden Gate Bridge, charming doll-house like homes, and cable cars on TV and imagined myself there. Moreover, San Francisco seems to be a very liberal city which I would be into.</p>

<p>6. Have you ever lived in the countryside?</p>
<p>Yes, I was born there! I grew up in the countryside. Actually, my backyard was a cornfield and some people even used to drive to my high school in tractors! Running around barefoot (without shoes) in the mud and frolicking around (running) open fields has always been a part of my life.</p>

<p>7. What do you like to do in the countryside?</p>
<p>Firstly, I like the outdoor activities, such as playing outside, gardening, going for walks and hikes, and going swimming. Secondly, I love the time I have to selfreflect and find deep relaxation. Sometimes I even like to do meditation or yoga in a field.</p>

<p>8. What do people living in the countryside like to do?</p>
<p>I imagine they like the outdoor activities, such as farming, gardening, going for walks, swimming, hiking, etc. I guess that they also like to have gatherings, maybe even barbecues and bonfires (a large outdoor fire), too. Lastly, I would think they like to go on trips to cities on the weekends as a change of scenery.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="ies-6-57">[057] Patience</h2>

<p>1. Do you have patience?</p>
<p>Not at all! I'm quite an impatient person. I often feel on edge (stressed), especially when I'm behind the wheel or waiting in line. Moreover, I like immediate gratification, so I tend to lose my patience when I cannot obtain this. This is one my biggest downfalls (bad personality traits).</p>

<p>2. Do most people in your country have patience?</p>
<p>Not really. Since I come from a country of people who are used to having all conveniences at their fingertips (something easily accessible), they often become impatient when this doesn't happen. Furthermore, people spend a lot of time commuting (traveling from home to work) to their offices in the mornings, which tends to leave them feeling antsy (anxious) as well as angry at other drivers.</p>

<p>3. Have you ever lost patience?</p>
<p>Who hasn't? There have been several instances. I once became quite impatient while I was waiting in a convenience store, not to mention with people cutting the line repeatedly, and I just left my items there idly (not doing anything) and stormed out (left angrily) of the store.</p>

<p>4. When do you need patience the most?</p>
<p>That's a difficult question. I think having patience in general is quite a virtue (a good trait). I think it's good to have it with your life in general. When you have this, I imagine your life goes more at ease from step to step. Moreover, I think it's important to have it with your children so that they aren't raised in an angry environment, and furthermore so they can develop it later on in life. </p>

<hr />

<h2 id="ies-6-58">[058] Pets/ Wild Animals</h2>

<p>1. What's your favorite animal?</p>
<p>Hm.. I would have to say whales. I've been fascinated by them ever since I was a child. There's just something so majestic about them, maybe it has to do with (is related to) their size. Plus they are highly intelligent and family-oriented creatures. It's believed that they even speak their own languages!</p>

<p>2. Do you like to see animals in the zoo?</p>
<p>Not really. Sure, it's interesting to see them, but I also feel sad seeing them in cages. In my opinion, wild animals should not be in captivity (caged) unless they have some sort of injury. Actually, I think it's a shame that humans feel the need to see nature so badly that they cage them and charge people to enter.</p>

<p>3. Do you keep a pet?</p>
<p>Not currently. I would like to, but I'm actually not allowed to because of my apartment regulations. Additionally, I live in a small studio apartment so it wouldn't be the best environment for a pet, unless it were a cat or small animal. Moreover, I work full-time so I wouldn't have a lot of time to tend to the pet.</p>

<p>4. Did you have a pet when you were young?</p>
<p>Yes, I did. My parents were both animal lovers (people who love animals), so we always had a house full of pets. My first pet was a lizard named Charlie, then onto my very own black kitten named Pal. Although I played too hard with my pets and made them annoyed, I still got a lot of joy from them. Additionally, I also learned a sense of responsibility from a young age.</p>

<p>5.What pet will you have later?</p>
<p>Hmm. I think I want a dog and a cat. When I think about it more, I cannot imagine having a family without a dog for my children one day. I can envision them playing with a Golden Retriever or a Labrador retriever, as they have a friendly demeanor (way of being). On the other hand, I'm more of a cat person (a person who prefers cats to dogs), so I would like to have one as well.</p>

<p>6. If you raise children in the future, will you allow them to keep a pet?</p>
<p>Yes, for sure. I would like to make their dreams come true of having a pet, as many children want. Moreover, I feel a pet is a great addition to a family. Lastly, I think allowing them to have a pet is a good opportunity for them to begin to have a sense of responsibility when it comes to walking their pet, changing the litter box (the box where cats go to the bathroom), feeding them, cleaning the cage, etc.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="ies-6-59">[059] Dance</h2>

<p>1. Do you like to dance? (Why?/Why not?)</p>
<p>Yes, I do! Although I don't know how to formally dance very well, I enjoy letting loose (relaxing; not caring what others thing) and dancing with my friends. There is something about dancing that makes me feel incredibly carefree (fully relaxed). Furthermore, it's a good way to exercise.</p>

<p>2. Have you ever learned to dance?</p>
<p>Yes, I have! When I was about 4 years old, my parents signed me up for ballet. Actually, I hated it with a burning passion back then. I would often burst into tears (to cry hard) before recitals and try to play sick (pretend to be sick to avoid something). Furthermore, we learned swing dancing, square-dancing, and ballroom dancing in school, which were humiliating at the time!</p>

<p>3. When was the last time you danced?</p>
<p>It's been a while. Since my group of friends aren't into dancing, I haven't been out to a club for a while. However, I often dance around my apartment with music as a way to de-stress.</p>

<p>4. What kind of dancing do people in your country like?</p>
<p>It seems like many people are into salsa and bachata these days. I'm seeing more and more Facebook ads for these particular dances. Moreover, are into hip-hop dancing, as well as dancing along to EDM music.</p>

<p>5. Why do you think some (or, many) people like dancing?</p>
<p>I would say because it's a way to let loose. Moreover, it's a way of selfexpression for many, especially those who are more talented. When you hit (go to) the dance floor, it seems like all your worries go away and you simply focus on the movements of your body.</p>

<p>6. Do you think there are any benefits for young people to go dancing?</p>
<p>Without a doubt! It's important to know how to let loose and have fun, for one. Secondly, it builds confidence. I remember feeling really shy to dance in front of others as a child, but once I just did it, I stopped caring. Lastly, it's an enjoyable form of exercise and builds certain skills, like flexibility, posture, etc.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="ies-6-60">[060] Haircut</h2>

<p>1. Do you like your current hair style?</p>
<p>Not really. I feel that I'm well-due for a change. I think my hair looks fine, but it's missing some extra flare (details) to really stand out (be noticed). For example, it's just an average brown color with a straight, medium-length cut.</p>

<p>2. Have you had a haircut that you didn't like?</p>
<p>Countless times! I usually leave the hair salon almost in tears, even though I always fake a smile to them and leave a tip to not be rude. I can remember one time I asked for just a trim (cutting a small amount), and she cut several inches off!</p>

<p>3. How often do you have your hair cut?</p>
<p>Having split ends (when your hair breaks at the ends) is a pet peeve (something that annoys me) of mine, so I usually go about once every 2 months. I could go less, but looking at my ends makes me crazy, so I make an appointment whenever they show up (appear). Furthermore, your hair grows healthier if you trim it often.</p>

<p>4. When was the last time you had your hair cut?</p>
<p>About 3 weeks ago. I didn't really have the extra cash for it, but I decided to do it because I had a professional photoshoot coming up, so I wanted my hair to look its best.</p>

<p>5. How much do you usually spend on a haircut?</p>
<p>Usually about $40 after a 20% tip. Unfortunately, the beauty industry is very expensive in my country, so even this ridiculous price is the lowest I can find. Because of this, it takes a toll on me (costs me a lot of money) every time I get a haircut.</p>

<p>6. Do you often (or, ever) change your hairstyle?</p>
<p>I do every so often. I sometimes switch back from dark hair to blonde hair. Actually, I had blonde, short hair for 2 years back in 2016, but now I have a medium-length chestnut brown hair style. I'm going back and forth (trying to make a decision) with going back to blonde right now!</p>

<p>7. What's your favourite hairstyle?</p>
<p>Hmm. Well, for me, I think I look best with a medium or long hair length and a dark brown color. However, for other girls, I love a short bleach blonde hair style, maybe even mixed with some wild colors, such as pink or blue. I know I couldn't pull it off (look good), but I still adore that edgy (uncommon) style!</p>

<p>8. Would you like to change the colour of your hair?</p>
<p>Yes! Right now it's a chestnut brown color, but I would rather it be a deep, dark chocolate brown or maybe even a blonde color. I like it to be one extreme or the other- I don't like the in between stage it's in right now. The struggle is, the dark hair brings out (shows) my eyes more, but the blonde color is a change and makes me feel sassy (with attitude).</p>
