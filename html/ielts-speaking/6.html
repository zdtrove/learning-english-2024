ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span>, <span>Sogol</span> <span>.Do</span> <span>like</span> <span>shopping</span>, and <span>why?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I <span>think</span> I do <span>like</span> <span>shopping</span> <span>quite</span> a lot. <span>Some</span> <span>people</span> <span>might</span> <span>call</span> me <span>shopaholic</span>. I <span>think</span> <span>most</span> <span>women</span> are <span>like</span> me. <span>We</span> <span>tend</span> to buy <span>impulsively</span>. <span>We</span> are <span>impulsive</span> <span>buyers</span>, <span>this</span> <span>means</span> <span>we</span> <span>sometimes</span> <span>we</span> buy <span>things</span> <span>that</span> <span>we</span> don't <span>need</span>, but <span>we</span> <span>enjoy</span> <span>doing</span> <span>that</span> .<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Ok</span>, <span>thanks</span>. What <span>time</span> do you do the <span>shopping?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>As</span> I <span>work</span> <span>from</span> <span>8:00</span> to <span>5:00</span> <span>in</span> the <span>afternoon</span>, I <span>tend</span> to do my <span>shopping</span> <span>on</span> the way <span>back</span> <span>home</span> <span>or</span> <span>during</span> the <span>weekends</span> <span>.If</span> I <span>need</span> <span>something</span> <span>urgently</span>, I <span>might</span> <span>even</span> <span>take</span> my <span>lunch</span> <span>break</span> and <span>quickly</span> <span>go</span> to buy to the <span>place</span> I <span>need</span> and buy the <span>things</span> I <span>need</span> .<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Ok</span> <span>Sogol</span>, do you <span>ever</span> <span>shop</span> <span>on</span> the <span>Internet?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I don't <span>think</span> I <span>would</span> <span>like</span> to. I <span>never</span> have. For me <span>shopping</span> <span>is</span> a <span>personal</span> <span>experience</span>. I <span>like</span> to see what I <span>am</span> <span>choosing</span> and <span>about</span> to buy. <span>Seeing</span> the <span>photograph</span> I don't <span>think</span> <span>does</span> the <span>same</span> <span>thing</span>. It's not the <span>same</span> <span>experience</span> .<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thanks</span>. let's <span>move</span> <span>onto</span> the <span>topic</span> <span>of</span> <span>clothing</span>. What <span>type</span> <span>of</span> <span>clothes</span> do you <span>like</span> to <span>wear?<br/></span>

ðŸŽ§ <span>O.K</span>. What <span>kind</span> <span>of</span> <span>clothes</span> do <span>people</span> <span>in</span> your <span>country</span> <span>usually</span> <span>wears?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>It</span> <span>depends</span> <span>on</span> <span>their</span> age and <span>also</span> <span>it</span> <span>depends</span> <span>on</span> <span>their</span> <span>jobs</span> <span>sometimes</span> <span>even</span>, but I <span>think</span> you'll <span>find</span> <span>in</span> <span>Tehran</span>, <span>younger</span> <span>people</span> <span>like</span> to <span>wear</span> <span>trendy</span> <span>clothes</span>. <span>They</span> <span>like</span> to <span>wear</span> <span>jeans</span> and <span>colorful</span> <span>coats</span> and <span>t-shirts</span>. <span>Yes</span>, I <span>think</span> <span>younger</span> <span>people</span> <span>enjoy</span> <span>younger</span> <span>fashion</span> <span>like</span> <span>everyone</span> <span>in</span> the <span>world</span>. <span>They</span> <span>prefer</span> to <span>dress</span> <span>in</span> a <span>sporty</span> <span>manner</span> but <span>of</span> <span>course</span> for <span>formal</span> <span>occasions</span> the men <span>will</span> put <span>on</span> a <span>very</span> <span>nice</span> <span>suit</span> and <span>ladies</span> <span>will</span> <span>wear</span> an <span>evening</span> <span>dress</span> .<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>think</span> <span>people</span> <span>behave</span> <span>differently</span> <span>in</span> <span>different</span> <span>kinds</span> <span>of</span> <span>clothes?<br/></span>
ðŸŽ§ I <span>think</span> <span>they</span> <span>probably</span> do. <span>If</span> you <span>wear</span> <span>something</span> <span>smart</span> and <span>formal</span> I <span>think</span> you <span>subconsciously</span> <span>feel</span> <span>that</span> you're <span>supposed</span> to <span>behave</span> <span>dignified</span> may be and <span>then</span> you <span>might</span> <span>feel</span> <span>important</span>. <span>If</span> you are <span>wearing</span> <span>something</span> <span>comfortable</span> and <span>sporty</span> <span>every</span> day, you <span>probably</span> <span>behave</span> <span>more</span> <span>casual</span> <span>as</span> <span>well</span> and <span>then</span> you'll <span>probably</span> be <span>more</span> <span>approachable</span> <span>at</span> the <span>same</span> <span>time</span> .<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Now let's <span>move</span> <span>onto</span> the <span>topic</span> <span>card</span>. I <span>would</span> <span>like</span> you to <span>describe</span> one <span>of</span> the <span>shopping</span> <span>centers</span> you <span>often</span> <span>go</span> to. So you have to <span>talk</span> <span>about</span> the <span>topic</span> for <span>about</span> <span>2</span> <span>minutes</span> and you have <span>1</span> <span>minute</span> to <span>think</span> <span>about</span> the <span>topic</span> <span>here</span> <span>is</span> a <span>paper</span> and a <span>pencil</span> to <span>write</span> <span>down</span> <span>whatever</span> you <span>wish</span> and <span>then</span> you may <span>start</span> .<br/>

ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span> <span>Sogol</span>, now I <span>would</span> <span>like</span> to ask you a few <span>more</span> <span>detailed</span> <span>questions</span> <span>related</span> to the <span>same</span> <span>topic</span>. <span>Will</span> <span>smaller</span> <span>shops</span> <span>survive</span> <span>in</span> the <span>current</span> <span>business</span> <span>system?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Actually</span>, I have <span>actually</span> <span>never</span> <span>thought</span> <span>about</span> <span>it</span> <span>before</span>, but <span>I'd</span> <span>assume</span> <span>they</span> <span>would</span> <span>especially</span> <span>in</span> <span>rural</span> <span>areas</span> where <span>demand</span> for the <span>shopping</span> <span>centers</span> <span>is</span> <span>probably</span> <span>zero;</span> <span>however</span>, <span>population</span> <span>is</span> <span>growing</span> and there are new <span>products</span> <span>every</span> day, so I <span>think</span> <span>they</span> <span>will</span> <span>diminish</span> <span>in</span> <span>numbers</span> <span>in</span> <span>more</span> <span>urban</span> <span>areas</span>, but <span>however</span> not <span>completely</span> <span>disappear</span> <span>from</span> the <span>face</span> <span>of</span> the <span>earth</span>. A lot <span>of</span> <span>people</span> <span>still</span> <span>prefer</span> to <span>go</span> to the <span>local</span> <span>shop</span> to buy what <span>they</span> are <span>looking</span> for and <span>support</span> <span>their</span> <span>family</span> <span>businesses</span> .<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What are the <span>differences</span> <span>of</span> <span>modem</span> <span>shopping</span> <span>malls</span> and <span>smaller</span> <span>shops?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span>, <span>again</span>, I haven't <span>given</span> <span>this</span> <span>much</span> <span>thought</span> <span>before</span>, but I <span>suppose</span> <span>modem</span> <span>shopping</span> <span>mall</span> <span>is</span> <span>quite</span> <span>inviting</span> <span>with</span> its <span>huge</span> <span>structure</span>, its <span>modem</span> <span>architecture</span> and there <span>is</span> so <span>much</span> to <span>choose</span> <span>from</span> <span>as</span> <span>oppose</span> <span>smaller</span> <span>local</span> <span>shops</span>. I <span>think</span> <span>this</span> <span>abundance</span> <span>of</span> <span>choice</span> <span>might</span> be a bit <span>confusing</span> <span>at</span> <span>times</span>, <span>smaller</span> <span>shops</span> <span>tend</span> to <span>store</span> <span>less</span> <span>items</span> when you <span>go</span> <span>in</span> and you don't have a <span>huge</span> <span>variety</span> to <span>confuse</span> you and <span>of</span> <span>course</span> the <span>appearance</span> <span>is</span> <span>much</span> <span>more</span> <span>traditional</span> .<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Ok</span>, <span>thanks</span> and the <span>last</span> <span>question</span>. What <span>is</span> the <span>trend</span> <span>of</span> <span>future</span> <span>shopping</span> <span>centers?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span>, <span>in</span> my <span>opinion</span>, I <span>think</span> the <span>future</span> <span>of</span> <span>shopping</span> <span>centers;</span> <span>they</span> <span>will</span> be <span>fewer</span> <span>in</span> <span>numbers</span>, but <span>probably</span> a lot <span>bigger</span>. I <span>think</span> <span>this</span> <span>would</span> <span>because</span> <span>people</span> <span>want</span> to <span>go</span> to one <span>place</span> and buy <span>whatever</span> <span>they</span> <span>need</span>. There's <span>also</span> <span>this</span> <span>growing</span> <span>trend</span> <span>of</span> <span>intemet</span> <span>shopping</span> but I don't <span>think</span> <span>interne</span> <span>shopping</span> <span>will</span> <span>take</span> <span>over</span> <span>completely</span> <span>because</span> I <span>think</span> <span>people</span> <span>generally</span> <span>prefer</span> to see and see <span>whatever</span> <span>about</span> the <span>purchases</span> <span>before</span> <span>making</span> a <span>decision<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you <span>very</span> <span>much</span> <span>Sogol</span>. <span>This</span> <span>is</span> the end <span>of</span> your <span>interview</span> <span>.Have</span> a <span>nice</span> <span>day<br/></span>
