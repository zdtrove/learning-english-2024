ðŸŽ§ <span>Hello</span>, come in <span>please<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you very <span>much<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span>. May I have your full <span>name?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ My <span>name</span> is <span>Sogol</span> <span>Bakhtiari</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span>, thanks <span>Sogol</span>. Can I take a look at your <span>passport?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Of course, here you are.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span>, <span>Sogol</span> <span>.Do</span> like <span>shopping</span>, and <span>why?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I think I do like <span>shopping</span> quite a lot. Some people might <span>call</span> me <span>shopaholic</span>. I think most <span>women</span> are like me. We <span>tend</span> to buy <span>impulsively</span>. We are <span>impulsive</span> <span>buyers</span>, this <span>means</span> we sometimes we buy things that we don't need, but we enjoy doing that.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Ok, thanks. What time do you do the <span>shopping?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>As</span> I work from <span>8:00</span> to <span>5:00</span> in the <span>afternoon</span>, I <span>tend</span> to do my <span>shopping</span> on the way back home or during the <span>weekends</span> <span>.If</span> I need something <span>urgently</span>, I might even take my lunch <span>break</span> and quickly go to buy to the place I need and buy the things I need.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Ok <span>Sogol</span>, do you ever <span>shop</span> on the <span>Internet?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I don't think I would like to. I never have. For me <span>shopping</span> is a <span>personal</span> <span>experience</span>. I like to see what I am <span>choosing</span> and about to buy. <span>Seeing</span> the <span>photograph</span> I don't think does the same thing. It's not the same <span>experience</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Thanks. let's move <span>onto</span> the <span>topic</span> of <span>clothing</span>. What <span>type</span> of <span>clothes</span> do you like to <span>wear?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I like <span>comfortable</span> <span>clothes</span> something <span>easy</span> to be in for the <span>whole</span> day.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>O.K</span>. What kind of <span>clothes</span> do people in your <span>country</span> usually <span>wears?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ It <span>depends</span> on their age and also it <span>depends</span> on their <span>jobs</span> sometimes even, but I think you'll find in <span>Tehran</span>, <span>younger</span> people like to <span>wear</span> <span>trendy</span> <span>clothes</span>. They like to <span>wear</span> <span>jeans</span> and <span>colorful</span> <span>coats</span> and <span>t-shirts</span>. Yes, I think <span>younger</span> people enjoy <span>younger</span> <span>fashion</span> like everyone in the <span>world</span>. They <span>prefer</span> to <span>dress</span> in a <span>sporty</span> <span>manner</span> but of course for <span>formal</span> <span>occasions</span> the men will put on a very nice <span>suit</span> and <span>ladies</span> will <span>wear</span> an <span>evening</span> <span>dress</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you think people <span>behave</span> <span>differently</span> in different <span>kinds</span> of <span>clothes?<br/></span>
ðŸŽ§ I think they probably do. If you <span>wear</span> something <span>smart</span> and <span>formal</span> I think you <span>subconsciously</span> feel that you're <span>supposed</span> to <span>behave</span> <span>dignified</span> may be and then you might feel <span>important</span>. If you are <span>wearing</span> something <span>comfortable</span> and <span>sporty</span> every day, you probably <span>behave</span> more <span>casual</span> as well and then you'll probably be more <span>approachable</span> at the same time.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Now let's move <span>onto</span> the <span>topic</span> <span>card</span>. I would like you to <span>describe</span> one of the <span>shopping</span> <span>centers</span> you <span>often</span> go to. So you have to talk about the <span>topic</span> for about <span>2</span> <span>minutes</span> and you have <span>1</span> <span>minute</span> to think about the <span>topic</span> here is a <span>paper</span> and a <span>pencil</span> to <span>write</span> <span>down</span> whatever you <span>wish</span> and then you may start.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you. <br/>

ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span> <span>Sogol</span>, now I would like to ask you a few more <span>detailed</span> <span>questions</span> <span>related</span> to the same <span>topic</span>. <span>Will</span> <span>smaller</span> <span>shops</span> <span>survive</span> in the <span>current</span> <span>business</span> <span>system?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Actually</span>, I have <span>actually</span> never thought about it before, but I'd <span>assume</span> they would <span>especially</span> in <span>rural</span> <span>areas</span> where <span>demand</span> for the <span>shopping</span> <span>centers</span> is probably <span>zero;</span> <span>however</span>, <span>population</span> is <span>growing</span> and there are new <span>products</span> every day, so I think they will <span>diminish</span> in <span>numbers</span> in more <span>urban</span> <span>areas</span>, but <span>however</span> not <span>completely</span> <span>disappear</span> from the <span>face</span> of the <span>earth</span>. A lot of people still <span>prefer</span> to go to the <span>local</span> <span>shop</span> to buy what they are <span>looking</span> for and <span>support</span> their <span>family</span> <span>businesses</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What are the <span>differences</span> of <span>modem</span> <span>shopping</span> <span>malls</span> and <span>smaller</span> <span>shops?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, again, I haven't <span>given</span> this much thought before, but I <span>suppose</span> <span>modem</span> <span>shopping</span> <span>mall</span> is quite <span>inviting</span> with its <span>huge</span> <span>structure</span>, its <span>modem</span> <span>architecture</span> and there is so much to choose from as <span>oppose</span> <span>smaller</span> <span>local</span> <span>shops</span>. I think this <span>abundance</span> of <span>choice</span> might be a bit <span>confusing</span> at <span>times</span>, <span>smaller</span> <span>shops</span> <span>tend</span> to <span>store</span> <span>less</span> <span>items</span> when you go in and you don't have a <span>huge</span> <span>variety</span> to <span>confuse</span> you and of course the <span>appearance</span> is much more <span>traditional</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Ok, thanks and the last <span>question</span>. What is the <span>trend</span> of future <span>shopping</span> <span>centers?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, in my <span>opinion</span>, I think the future of <span>shopping</span> <span>centers;</span> they will be <span>fewer</span> in <span>numbers</span>, but probably a lot <span>bigger</span>. I think this would <span>because</span> people want to go to one place and buy whatever they need. There's also this <span>growing</span> <span>trend</span> of <span>intemet</span> <span>shopping</span> but I don't think <span>interne</span> <span>shopping</span> will take over <span>completely</span> <span>because</span> I think people <span>generally</span> <span>prefer</span> to see and see whatever about the <span>purchases</span> before <span>making</span> a <span>decision<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you very much <span>Sogol</span>. This is the end of your <span>interview</span> <span>.Have</span> a nice <span>day<br/></span>

ðŸŽ§ Good morning.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Good morning, <span>ma'am</span>. Please come in and have a <span>seat</span>, May I have your full <span>name?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Well my <span>name</span> is <span>Taraneh</span> <span>Sadeghian</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you <span>Tranah</span>. May I have a look at your <span>passport?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Sure, here you are.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you, ok <span>Taraneh</span>. I'm going to ask you a few <span>questions</span>, do you like to <span>travel?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ In <span>fact</span> I can tell you I love <span>traveling</span>, I'm <span>keen</span> on <span>traveling</span> <span>because</span> it <span>gives</span> me the <span>opportunity</span> to visit different <span>places</span>, <span>meet</span> new people and in <span>general</span> get new <span>experience</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Do you like to travel <span>alone</span> or with your <span>friends?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, it <span>depends</span>, I can say most of the <span>tome</span> I really like to travel with my friends <span>because</span> I think there is more fun to it, <span>however</span> I think there are some <span>times</span> when! think I'd better be <span>myself</span> to be <span>relaxed</span> and <span>fresh</span>, be away from the <span>busy</span> life, so sometimes I do <span>prefer</span> to be <span>alone</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Right</span> and what do you usually do when you first <span>arrive</span> at a new <span>place?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, it's not an <span>easy</span> <span>question</span> that I have never thought about it before, the first thing I do when I first <span>arrive</span> at a new place is probably taking a <span>shower</span> and have a cup of <span>coffee</span> and <span>relax</span> and of course it <span>depends</span> on the <span>distance</span> if it is a <span>short</span> <span>distance</span> <span>trip</span>, I probably might not be that much <span>tired</span> to <span>sleep</span> or take much time to <span>relax</span>, but in a <span>longer</span> <span>trip</span> I <span>suppose</span> I will have a long <span>sleep</span>, take <span>shower</span>, and have a cup of <span>coffee<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I see, what's the best place you have ever <span>visited?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I have <span>visited</span> so many <span>places</span>, but the best one that I have ever <span>visited</span> probably is <span>'Opera</span> <span>House'</span> in <span>Sydney</span>. I can tell it was almost the last <span>November</span>, I had a <span>trip</span> with my <span>family</span> to <span>Sydney</span> and I <span>visited</span> <span>Opera</span> <span>House</span>. I had always <span>wanted</span> to visit that place since I was a <span>child</span> and I was really happy to visit that place <span>because</span> it's one of the <span>world</span> famous place, so it was a <span>large</span>, I can say <span>huge</span> <span>building</span>. In <span>fact</span> it was a <span>huge</span> <span>hall</span> made for <span>performing</span> different <span>sorts</span> of art and <span>artistic</span> <span>works</span>. It had a big <span>auditorium</span>, <span>several</span> <span>steps</span> <span>because</span> of <span>performing</span> many <span>arts</span>, so I really like it.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Ok, <span>Taraneh</span>, now we are going to move <span>onto</span> a new <span>subject</span>, can you tell something about <span>transportation</span> in your home <span>town?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I can tell you in my home <span>town</span>, there are probably <span>several</span> different <span>types</span> of <span>transportation</span> <span>systems</span>, well I can tell you that most of the people use their own <span>cars</span>, they <span>tend</span> to use their <span>private</span> <span>cars</span>, <span>however</span> many people use <span>taxis</span> and <span>buses</span> to <span>commute</span> to work. And I can tell you <span>recently</span>, they have also <span>developed</span> the <span>subway</span> <span>system</span> which quite <span>makes</span> <span>transportation</span> <span>smooth</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Is there much <span>traffic</span> in your <span>city</span> and if so how can this <span>problem</span> be <span>solved?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, of course, a <span>huge</span> <span>population</span> live in my <span>hometown</span>, <span>Tehran</span>, is the <span>capital</span> of <span>Iran</span>, I can tell you we do have a lot of <span>traffic</span>. <span>Traffic</span> is <span>congested</span>, that are too many <span>cars</span> in the <span>roads</span>, and in the <span>streets</span> and I can tell you that most of the people use their own <span>private</span> <span>cars</span> that is another <span>reason</span> that <span>adds</span> to it, and also there are too many <span>single</span> <span>passenger</span> <span>cars</span>, so I do think that we will have a lot <span>problems</span> probably some of them can't be done to <span>solve</span> this <span>problem</span> is to <span>construct</span> more <span>roads</span> and <span>highways</span> and I <span>suppose</span> that <span>government</span> is <span>required</span> to <span>encourage</span> people to <span>carpool</span> or use more <span>public</span> <span>transportation</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ All right thank you. Now, we are going to move <span>onto</span> the <span>second</span> <span>part</span> of the <span>test</span>. I'm going to give you a <span>topic</span> <span>card</span>, you can take I <span>minute</span> to have a look and then also take <span>down</span> some <span>notes</span>, here is a pen and <span>paper</span> and then we will start.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you. <span><br/>

ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span>, thank you, <span>Taraneh</span>. Now I'm going to ask you some <span>detailed</span> <span>questions</span> on the same <span>topic</span>. What <span>musical</span> <span>instruments</span> are <span>popular</span> in your <span>country?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, in my <span>country</span>, I <span>suppose</span> the <span>piano</span>, the <span>guitar;</span> <span>perhaps</span> the <span>drum</span> is the most <span>popular</span> <span>among</span> the <span>younger</span> people. <span>However</span>, many <span>older</span> people <span>tend</span> to play <span>eastern</span> <span>musical</span> <span>instruments</span> such as the <span>Sitar</span> which is a <span>string</span> <span>instrument</span> and <span>DAFF</span> which is <span>percussion</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Do you think people have <span>tendency</span> to <span>Western</span> music and if so <span>why?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Well I'm not <span>expert</span> but I can say, I do think still people have more <span>tendency</span> <span>toward</span> <span>western</span> music <span>especially</span> the <span>younger</span> <span>generation</span>, in <span>spite</span> of the <span>fact</span> that <span>Iranian</span> Pop and music <span>styles</span> have <span>developed</span> and <span>improved</span> a lot, still I <span>suppose</span> <span>because</span> of so much <span>variety</span> in <span>western</span> music, people <span>tend</span> to listen to <span>western</span> music.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span> and do you think <span>children</span> should be <span>encouraged</span> to play music from the <span>early</span> <span>childhood?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Like any other <span>activities</span>, I <span>suppose</span> <span>playing</span> music is better to be <span>encouraged</span> from <span>early</span> <span>childhood-from</span> <span>early</span> age <span>because</span> <span>children</span> are <span>capable</span> of <span>absorbing</span> things very quickly and <span>easily</span> and they can <span>develop</span> it <span>further</span> with their <span>practice</span>, with their <span>talent</span> more <span>quicker</span> than <span>adults</span> and probably the later <span>ages</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What is the best way to learn to play an <span>instrument?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Probably</span> the best way to play music is <span>registering</span> in a <span>prominent</span> and <span>leading</span> <span>institute</span> and with the help of a <span>skilled</span>, <span>experienced</span> <span>,I</span> can say, <span>professional</span> music <span>instructor</span> probably that would be the best way <span>because</span> I've <span>heard</span> around it from some people they go back to their <span>talent</span> , they are <span>self-tutored</span>, I <span>believe</span>, they don't <span>develop</span> <span>further</span> , and I have also <span>seen</span> the people who are <span>talented</span> and <span>started</span> <span>learning</span> <span>musical</span> <span>instrument</span> with the help of a <span>capable</span> music <span>instructor</span> and I can say they have <span>improve</span> much <span>further</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Ok, <span>Tareneh</span>. What do you think about the <span>role</span> of music in <span>people's</span> <span>lives?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Well it is <span>multifaceted;</span> music <span>plays</span> a great <span>role</span> in <span>people's</span> lives <span>basically</span>. It <span>depends</span> on the <span>situation</span> and the <span>occasion;</span> in sad <span>situation</span>, it can <span>calm</span> them <span>down</span> in time <span>listening</span> to <span>light</span> music is very <span>soothing</span> and <span>relaxing</span>. On the other <span>hand</span>, on happy <span>occasions</span>, it <span>lifts</span> their <span>spirits</span>, it really helps them to <span>rev-</span> up and it is very <span>relaxing</span>, but I <span>suppose</span> it can have <span>destructive</span> <span>effect</span> on the <span>younger</span> <span>generation</span> and <span>children</span>, it may <span>encourage</span> them to <span>drug</span> <span>abuse</span> or some <span>violence</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span>, <span>Taraneh</span>, thank you very much. Your <span>speaking</span> <span>test</span> is now over.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you, have a nice day. <span><br/>

ðŸŽ§ Good <span>afternoon<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Good <span>afternoon</span> <span>ma'am</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Please come in and a have a <span>seat</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ May! have your full <span>name?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Sure, my <span>name</span> is <span>Pooneh</span> <span>Saadatmand</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Can I have a look at your <span>passport?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Sure there you go, thank you.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span> <span>Pooneh</span>, I'm going to ask you a few <span>questions</span>. Do you read <span>books</span> and if you do what kind of <span>books</span> do you <span>read?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, I read <span>books</span> but I'm not really a big fan of <span>reading</span> <span>books</span>. I read <span>books</span> <span>whenever</span> I have time, <span>basically</span> my <span>favorite</span> <span>types</span> of <span>books</span> are <span>fictions</span> and sometimes <span>novels</span> and sometimes I do like to read <span>historical</span> <span>books<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, did you read <span>books</span> when you were a <span>child?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I can say absolutely yes <span>because</span> my <span>parents</span> , in <span>fact</span>, <span>develop</span> the <span>habit</span> of <span>reading</span> <span>books</span> in me since I was a <span>child</span>, I <span>remember</span> at that time I wasn't a <span>literate</span> person, my dad used to read some <span>folk</span> <span>stories</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I see, do <span>children</span> like <span>reading</span> <span>nowadays?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Well I'm not so sure, but from what I see around me, I can tell you that <span>children</span> are not <span>basically</span> that <span>interested</span> in <span>reading</span> <span>books</span> as <span>opposed</span> to my time. <span>Probably</span> <span>because</span> there are so many <span>games</span> to play, <span>computer</span> <span>games</span> to play, <span>internet</span> <span>games</span> to play and that is why probably that they are not that <span>interested</span> in <span>reading</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Pooneh</span>, would you give you a book as a <span>gift?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, <span>certainly</span>. <span>Book</span> is a <span>treasure</span>, I can say, it is a <span>valuable</span> <span>gift</span> I can give to people I like <span>especially</span> my friends <span>because</span> I <span>suppose</span> a <span>gift</span> <span>enhances</span> my <span>friends'</span> <span>information</span> and it is something they can really keep it <span>forever</span> and in <span>fact</span>, I <span>believe</span>, it is a good, I will <span>leave</span> a good <span>memory</span> of <span>myself</span> with my friends.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you <span>Pooneh</span>. Now we are going to move on another <span>subject</span>, do you like music? <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I can tell you that <span>honestly</span>, I'm a big fan of music I have <span>spent</span> much of my time <span>listening</span> to different <span>kinds</span> of <span>music;</span> <span>western</span> music, <span>Iranian</span>, pop <span>songs</span>. Yes <span>totally</span> I can tell, I really am <span>interested</span> in <span>listening</span> to music.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What kind of music do you <span>like?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ There is a <span>variety</span> of music I really like. I can tell you from <span>folk</span> music, <span>western</span> music, pop music which these <span>days</span> is very <span>popular</span>, so, I'm a big fan of almost all <span>types</span> of <span>music<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Can you tell me what kind of music is <span>popular</span> in your <span>country?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Well in <span>recent</span> years I can tell you, pop music is probably very <span>popular</span> <span>among</span> the people <span>especially</span> the <span>younger</span> <span>generation</span>, but <span>those</span> <span>days</span>, I <span>remember</span>, in the <span>past</span>, people had more <span>tendencies</span> <span>towards</span> <span>western</span> music.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span>, Now I'm going to give you a <span>topic</span> <span>card</span> which you have to talk about in <span>2</span> <span>minutes</span>, please take <span>1</span> <span>minute</span> to <span>study</span> it and here's a <span>piece</span> of <span>paper</span> and pen if you need to take some <span>notes</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Thanks. <br/>
