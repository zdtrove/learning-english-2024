ðŸŽ§ Good <span>Afternoon</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Good <span>afternoon</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Come in please and have a <span>seat</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you very much.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span>. Can I take a look at your <span>passport</span>, <span>please?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Yes. <span>Here</span> you go.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Thanks, and what is your full <span>name?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ My <span>name</span> is <span>Sara</span> <span>Akbari</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span> <span>Sara</span>. What is the <span>meaning</span> of your <span>name?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I think <span>Sara</span> <span>means</span> <span>pure</span> and <span>innocent</span>. <span>However</span>, this is an <span>international</span> <span>name</span>, as I have <span>heard</span> it in many other <span>languages</span> as well.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ All right <span>Sara</span>. Do you think your <span>name</span> is <span>important</span> to you? Do you like it or you would like to change your <span>name?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, I've never <span>given</span> it much thought. I think that <span>must</span> mean that I'm quite <span>content</span> with the <span>name</span> I have. And <span>although</span> I think it's quite a <span>common</span> <span>name</span>, I am <span>nonetheless</span> happy with it.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span> <span>Sara</span>. Please <span>describe</span> your <span>daily</span> <span>routine</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Well, I'm a <span>university</span> <span>student</span> in my <span>second</span> year. My <span>daily</span> <span>routine</span> during the week would <span>consist</span> of me <span>waking</span> up quite <span>early</span> in the morning <span>â€”</span> I'd say about <span>6</span> <span>o'clock</span>. <span>From</span> about six <span>till</span> <span>eight</span> I'll get <span>ready</span>, I'll have my <span>breakfast</span>. If there's any work that needs to be done before <span>attending</span> class, I'll try and fit it in there. I take the bus to <span>university</span>, after which, of course, I <span>attend</span> the <span>classes</span>. <span>Lunchtimes</span>, we <span>normally</span> go off <span>campus</span> with my friends for a <span>sandwich</span> or a <span>quick</span> <span>bite</span> to eat. If we have more time, we might sit in the <span>park</span> and <span>discuss</span> <span>sonic</span> of the <span>subjects</span> we're doing. If I have <span>classes</span> in the <span>afternoon</span>, I'll <span>return</span> to <span>campus</span> and <span>attend</span> <span>those</span>. On a <span>normal</span> day, I'd say I'm <span>finished</span> at <span>university</span> by about <span>5</span> <span>o'clock</span>. And by the time I get home, it should be <span>close</span> to <span>seven</span>. After this, well it <span>depends</span> on how much work I have to do for the next day. <span>Or</span>, <span>whether</span> or not I have enough free time, in which case I will sit down and <span>watch</span> some <span>television</span> or <span>spend</span> some time with my <span>mother</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span> <span>Sara</span>. What do you do on <span>weekends?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, <span>preferably</span>, I'd like to <span>spend</span> <span>weekends</span> <span>relaxing</span> and <span>refreshing</span> myself for the <span>coming</span> week. But, there will be <span>times</span> when I'll need to sit down and do some <span>studying</span>. Maybe I've <span>fallen</span> behind on a <span>certain</span> <span>subject</span>, or maybe! need to do some <span>research</span>. But! do <span>prefer</span> to <span>relax</span>, <span>spend</span> some time with my <span>family</span>, maybe go out with my friends, and <span>generally</span> feel <span>rested</span> for the <span>following</span> week.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>OK</span>, thanks <span>Sara</span>. What are some of your <span>hobbies?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, if! have the time, I do enjoy going for a <span>swim</span> every once in a <span>while</span>. I also enjoy going <span>window</span> <span>shopping</span> with my friends, and <span>reading</span>. But during <span>university</span>, you have so much to read that I sometimes don't feel like <span>reading</span> <span>fiction</span> during my <span>spare</span> time.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>OK</span> <span>Sara</span>. How much time do you <span>spend</span> with your friends in your <span>spare</span> <span>time?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, I like to <span>divide</span> that <span>spare</span> time between my <span>family</span> and my friends. <span>Obviously</span>, I see my <span>family</span> every day, <span>mostly</span> over a <span>meal</span> in the <span>evening</span>. <span>Friends</span>, it's not so. Of course, my <span>university</span> friends I'll see during the day, if we have <span>classes</span> together. But other friends, it's <span>difficult</span> to catch up on a <span>regular</span> <span>basis</span>. I'd say I wouldn't <span>mind</span> spending one day a week <span>catching</span> up with my friends and <span>seeing</span> what they're up to, and <span>exchanging</span> our <span>weekly</span> <span>stories</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span> <span>Sara</span>, now we move <span>onto</span> another <span>topic</span>. I will <span>show</span> you a <span>topic</span> <span>card</span> and I would like you to talk about the <span>topic</span> for about two <span>minutes</span>. You have once <span>minute</span> to <span>organise</span> your <span>mind</span> and think about the <span>topic</span>. <span>Here</span> is a <span>paper</span> and a <span>pencil</span> and you can <span>write</span> down <span>notes</span> if you <span>wish</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you very <span>much.<br/>
</span> <br/>

ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you <span>Sara</span>. Now I would like to ask a few more <span>detailed</span> <span>questions</span>. How can <span>someone</span> take a good <span>photograph</span>? <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, I do enjoy <span>photography</span>, but I'm in no way a <span>professional</span> <span>photographer</span>. I'd have to say a good <span>angle</span>, the right <span>subject</span>. I think <span>light</span> is very <span>important</span>, <span>obviously</span>, well, it would <span>depend</span> on the <span>subject</span> as well and <span>location</span>, but I think there are many different <span>aspects</span> <span>involved</span> in taking a good <span>photo</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>prefer</span> to keep a <span>film</span> or a <span>photograph?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, you have to <span>consider</span> them both really. <span>Photographs</span> are <span>obviously</span> <span>moments</span> in time that have been <span>captured</span> and you can take them out at any <span>given</span> time and have a look at them and feel <span>those</span> <span>emotions</span> again, and see the <span>happiness</span> or whatever the <span>occasion</span> was and what <span>feelings</span> it <span>induced</span> in the people in the <span>photograph</span> or the <span>subject</span> of the <span>photograph</span>. <span>Film</span> has its <span>advantages</span> of being more <span>real</span>, <span>having</span> <span>motion</span> and <span>movement</span> and also sound. But on a <span>personal</span> <span>level</span>, I think there's something <span>magical</span> about a <span>photograph</span> that will never be about a <span>film</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>prefer</span> a <span>black</span> and <span>white</span> <span>photo</span> or a <span>colourful</span> <span>one?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Again</span>, that <span>depends</span> on the <span>subject</span> <span>matter</span>. I think <span>portraits</span> are more <span>beautiful</span> when they're <span>black</span> and <span>white</span>. But some <span>landscape</span> and <span>sceneries</span> are <span>obviously</span> all the more <span>breathtaking</span> <span>because</span> of the <span>colour</span>. So it would be a <span>shame</span> to take the <span>photograph</span> in <span>black</span> and <span>white</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ How do you feel when you look at your <span>family</span> <span>album?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ A great <span>sense</span> of <span>nostalgia</span>. I absolutely enjoy going <span>through</span> my <span>family</span> <span>albums</span> and <span>looking</span> at my <span>parents</span> and <span>relatives</span> from even before I <span>existed</span>. I like to think what they were thinking then and how they <span>felt</span>, and the funny <span>part</span>, I think, is the way they used to <span>dress</span>. It's just such a <span>beautiful</span> <span>experience</span>, to be able to go back and see what your loved <span>ones</span> <span>looked</span> like, or try to <span>imagine</span> what <span>must</span> have been going on <span>through</span> their <span>minds</span> at the time when this <span>photograph</span> was <span>taken</span>. It's a <span>lovely</span> <span>experience</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you very much <span>Sara</span>. That is the end of your <span>speaking</span> <span>test</span>. Have a nice day.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you very much. <span><br/>

ðŸŽ§ Good <span>Morning</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Good <span>Morning</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Come in and have a <span>seat</span> please.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you very much.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ May I have a look at your <span>passport?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Yes, here you are.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>OK</span> thanks, and may I have your full <span>name</span> <span>please?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ My <span>name</span> is <span>Nazli</span> <span>Parvizi</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span>, thanks <span>Nazli</span>. Who put this <span>name</span> on <span>you?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Nazli</span>, is <span>actually</span> my <span>paternal</span> <span>grandmother</span>, and my <span>parents</span> <span>decided</span> to <span>name</span> me after her.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What <span>kinds</span> of <span>names</span> are <span>popular</span> in your <span>country?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, I'll have to say that there's a <span>variety</span> of <span>names</span>. For <span>girls</span> it's <span>mostly</span> <span>flowers</span>, or <span>ancient</span> <span>Persian</span> <span>names</span>, and <span>obviously</span> <span>religious</span> <span>names</span>. But for <span>boys</span>, it <span>tends</span> to be, I think, <span>mostly</span> <span>religious</span> <span>names</span> and also <span>ancient</span> <span>Persian</span> <span>names</span>. You will come across quite a few people who have been <span>named</span> after a <span>prominent</span> <span>religious</span> <span>figure</span>, a <span>historical</span> <span>religious</span> <span>figure</span>. So they would use that for <span>official</span> <span>purposes</span>, but they might be <span>called</span> something <span>totally</span> different at home. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span> <span>Nazli</span>. Tell me, what is your <span>major?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I have a <span>degree</span> in <span>Teaching</span> English as a <span>Foreign</span> <span>Language</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you like your <span>major</span>, and <span>why</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Yes I do <span>indeed</span>. I <span>wanted</span> to learn English <span>fluently</span> ever since I was a <span>child</span>. So, being <span>lucky</span> enough to get <span>accepted</span> on this course was a <span>dream</span> come <span>true</span> for me. And I <span>enjoyed</span> the course <span>thoroughly</span>. And of course, I've <span>reached</span> my <span>childhood</span> <span>dream</span> now.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ And what do you do at the <span>moment</span>, <span>Nazli?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>At</span> the <span>moment</span> I'm <span>teaching</span> English, both at an <span>institute</span> and also <span>privately</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Ok thanks. And tell me, what do you like about your <span>job?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, what I enjoy the most about my job, as I think most <span>teachers</span> would agree, is the <span>sense</span> of <span>satisfaction</span>, and <span>gratification</span> you get when your <span>students</span> learn what you're <span>actually</span> <span>trying</span> so <span>hard</span>, and they're <span>trying</span> so <span>hard</span> to. <span>Nothing</span> <span>replaces</span> that, I think, as a <span>teacher</span>. It's the most <span>wonderful</span> feeling.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Is there anything you <span>dislike</span> about your <span>job?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Well I wouldn't go as far to say <span>dislike</span>. But I find it quite <span>frustrating</span> sometimes if a <span>student</span> is <span>lacking</span> in <span>concentration</span>, or is not even <span>interested</span> in <span>learning</span> this <span>language</span>. You do come across people who are <span>forced</span> by <span>parents</span>, or think it's absolutely <span>necessary</span> to learn English, but don't really <span>commit</span> to it much as they could. <span>Trying</span> to <span>encourage</span> these <span>students</span>, it is quite an <span>ordeal</span>. But it's not something I would <span>hate</span> my job for. It's something that's just an <span>obstacle</span> that I have to <span>overcome</span> as a <span>teacher</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span> <span>Nazli</span>. <span>Would</span> you like to have your own <span>business</span> one <span>day?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Yes, <span>actually</span>. My <span>ultimate</span> <span>dream</span> would be to <span>open</span> an English <span>Language</span> <span>institute</span>, which would of course be for all <span>ages</span> and <span>levels</span>. This would probably not <span>materialise</span> for quite some time yet. But I am working my way <span>towards</span> <span>reaching</span> this <span>goal</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you <span>Nazli</span>. Now we move on to a <span>topic</span>. I would like to <span>show</span> you a <span>topic</span> <span>card</span>. You have to talk about the <span>topic</span> for about two <span>minutes</span>. You have one <span>minute</span> to think about the <span>topic</span>. <span>Here</span> is a <span>paper</span> and <span>pencil</span>, you can <span>write</span> down <span>notes</span> if you <span>wish</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you very much. <span><br/>

ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span>, thanks <span>Nazli</span>. Now I would like to ask a few more <span>questions</span>. What is the <span>difference</span> between a <span>letter</span> and an <span>email?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, we can say the <span>main</span> <span>difference</span> is I <span>suppose</span> the <span>speed</span> in which we <span>receive</span> a <span>letter</span> as <span>opposed</span> to an <span>email</span>. <span>Modern</span> life probably <span>necessitates</span> <span>speedier</span> <span>access</span> to <span>communication</span>. So <span>therefore</span>, an <span>email</span> is much more <span>convenient</span> and <span>less</span> <span>time-consuming</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ How do you think <span>internet</span> has <span>changed</span> <span>traditional</span> <span>letter</span> <span>writing?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Do you mean in the <span>aspect</span> of <span>whether</span> it's a good change or a <span>negative</span> <span>change?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ That's right.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Well, I think that it has a little bit of both. The <span>internet</span> <span>facilitates</span> the <span>speed</span> in which you can <span>communicate</span> <span>important</span> <span>matters</span> and <span>personal</span> <span>matters</span> with <span>others</span>. And also, it doesn't <span>necessitate</span> a person <span>sitting</span> down and <span>writing</span> a <span>letter</span>, and <span>having</span> to <span>post</span> it, and <span>waiting</span> for the time that it would take to <span>deliver</span> in <span>order</span> to get a <span>reply</span>. With the <span>internet</span> you can <span>write</span> a <span>message</span> and <span>convey</span> a <span>certain</span> thing <span>within</span> <span>minutes</span>, and <span>receive</span> a <span>reply</span> <span>within</span> <span>minutes</span>. On the <span>downside</span>, I would have to say that an <span>email</span> <span>lacks</span> the <span>emotion</span> that maybe the <span>sender</span> is <span>trying</span> to <span>convey</span>. With <span>letters</span> you can <span>perhaps</span> tell a lot about its <span>context</span> <span>because</span> of the <span>person's</span> <span>handwriting</span>. It has a <span>generally</span> more <span>personal</span> <span>touch</span> to it, which I think is quite special. So, maybe <span>emails</span> are a good thing, but on special <span>occasions</span> for the people who <span>matter</span> to you, <span>sending</span> the <span>occasional</span> <span>letter</span> I think is a nice <span>gesture</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ And the last <span>question</span> <span>Nazli</span>. <span>Would</span> <span>post</span> <span>offices</span> <span>disappear</span> in the next <span>fifty</span> <span>years?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, I wouldn't be <span>surprised</span> if they did, or at <span>least</span> they were <span>diminished</span> in <span>numbers</span> <span>greatly</span>. The <span>reason</span> is that <span>obviously</span> people are <span>relying</span> more and more on the <span>internet</span> to <span>communicate</span>. But on the other <span>hand</span>, as is the case now, a lot of people around the <span>world</span> still don't have <span>access</span> to the <span>internet</span>, so I think it wouldn't <span>altogether</span> <span>disappear</span>. <span>At</span> the end of the day you can't <span>send</span> a <span>parcel</span>, or a small <span>package</span> via the <span>internet</span>. So <span>perhaps</span> not <span>entirely</span>, but maybe you'd come across them a lot <span>less</span> <span>often</span> than you do now.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you very much, <span>Nazli</span>. This is the end of the <span>speaking</span> <span>test</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> <span>you.<br/>

ðŸŽ§ Good <span>Afternoon</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Good <span>Afternoon</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Come in please and have a <span>seat</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ May I have a look at your <span>passport</span> <span>please?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Yes. <span>Here</span> you are.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Fine</span>, thanks. And may I have your full <span>name?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ My <span>name</span> is <span>Maryam</span> <span>Bahri</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span> <span>Maryam</span>, <span>describe</span> your <span>family</span> please.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Well there's <span>five</span> people in my <span>family:</span> my <span>parents</span>, and my two <span>siblings</span> and I. I'm the <span>youngest</span> <span>child</span>. I have an <span>older</span> <span>sister</span> which is the <span>oldest</span> <span>child</span>, and of course my <span>brother</span>, who's the <span>middle</span> <span>child</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Thanks. Do you get along well with your <span>family</span> <span>members?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Well we try to get on as well as we can, but <span>obviously</span> each of us has a very different <span>character</span> to the other. So yes, <span>because</span> we're not a small <span>family</span> we try to learn, or we were <span>taught</span> <span>early</span> on to <span>appreciate</span> our <span>differences</span> and try and get along as best as we can.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Thanks <span>Maryam</span>. What do you like to do to together as a <span>family?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ If we haven't <span>seen</span> each other for a long <span>stretch</span> of time, what we most like to do is get together for a <span>family</span> <span>meal</span>, and <span>discuss</span> the things that are going on in our lives. We <span>tend</span> to do that at <span>least</span> once a week with all the <span>family</span> <span>gathered</span> at my <span>parent's</span> house. It's a very <span>enjoyable</span> time, <span>because</span> you get to catch up and learn what your <span>family</span> are doing. And also, give each other advice on different <span>subjects</span> or <span>difficulties</span> we might be <span>having</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Are people in your <span>country</span> <span>generally</span> <span>close</span> to their <span>families?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I would say yes, very much so. In our <span>culture</span> it's very <span>important</span>. It's a very <span>family-oriented</span> <span>culture</span>. <span>Families</span> <span>tend</span> to <span>stay</span> in <span>touch</span> a lot. And even if there's <span>distance</span>, for whatever <span>reason</span>, they always <span>tend</span> to keep in <span>touch</span> and <span>inform</span> each other of their <span>well-being</span>. I think the <span>culture</span> <span>encourages</span> this. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span> <span>Maryam</span>. What kind of <span>building</span> do you live <span>in?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I live on the <span>fifth</span> <span>floor</span> of a <span>twelve-storey</span> <span>apartment</span> <span>building</span>. My <span>apartment</span> is not very <span>large</span>, but it has a nice living <span>area</span> and two <span>smallish</span> <span>bedrooms</span>. What I like most about my <span>building</span> is my <span>neighbours</span>, who are very kind, and they keep to <span>themselves</span>, but you can <span>rely</span> on their help if you need <span>it<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span> thanks <span>Maryam</span>. Do you like your <span>neighbourhood?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I have to say yes, <span>because</span> it's quite <span>central</span> and <span>therefore</span> everything is <span>easily</span> <span>within</span> <span>access</span>. The <span>downside</span> to my <span>neighbourhood</span> is maybe the <span>traffic</span> and the <span>noise</span>. But all in all, I like it. I do. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Have you ever thought about <span>changing</span> your <span>apartment?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Not for the <span>moment</span>, no. But if our <span>family</span> <span>grows</span>, then <span>obviously</span> we will have to move into a <span>bigger</span> <span>apartment<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span>, thanks <span>Maryam</span>. Now let's move <span>onto</span> the <span>topic</span> of <span>libraries</span>. <span>1</span> would like you to <span>describe</span> a <span>library</span> you have been to. You have to talk about this <span>topic</span> for two <span>minutes</span>, and you have one <span>minute</span> to think about the <span>topic</span>. <span>Here</span> is a <span>paper</span> and <span>pencil</span>. You can think about the <span>topic</span>, and <span>write</span> down your <span>notes</span> if you <span>wish</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you very <span>much.<br/></span>
