1. Do you know your neighbors?<br />
Yes, I do. My family has been living on the same block since I was born, so we've gotten to know each other quite well. We are close to my next door neighbor in particular, Ms. Elizabeth. As she's a widowed (husband died) 80 year old woman in poor health, we keep a close eye on her to make sure she's managing on her own. The other neighbors have come and gone (many new ones have moved here, many have moved away) so we aren't as close with them.<br />

2. Do you like your neighbors?<br />
Some of them! We are all quite fond of Miss Elizabeth; she has always been like a grandmother to me. She has always been there during our important milestones (important life stages) in life. I'm always thrilled when she turns up at our door with freshly baked banana bread. On the other hand, some of our other neighbors are quite stand-offish (unfriendly) so we tend to keep our distance. However, Miss Elizabeth is family.<br /> 

3. What do you think of your neighbors?<br />
I think they are just so-so people. It seems as though they lead stressful daily lives and cannot be bothered (making the effort would bother them) to talk to their neighbors. They are caught up in (lost in) their own family dramas. We used to be friends with another neighbor, but then she ended up being too nosey (too interested in the lives of others), so now we just smile at her but don't share our business.<br />

4. How often do you see (or talk to) your neighbors?<br />
Other than Ms. Elizabeth, I just see them in passing (see briefly). So, I see them everyday but really only talk to them once or twice a week when we are forced to be in the same vicinity. For example, when I take the garbage out, we usually make small talk (talk about unimportant things, like the weather etc.) <br />

1. Have you ever been to any island?<br />
Yes, I have! Actually, I lived on an island for 3 months back in 2016. My mother was offered to work at a resort for 2 years, so I joined them there for 3 months. Island life was quite an interesting experience!<br />

2. Are there any islands in your country?<br />
Yes, there are. There is one famous island called X, famed for its crystal clear water and white sands. I've heard the pagodas are very interesting to visit there, as well. I haven't been yet, but I dream of going there for a girls getaway (when women go on a trip together) sometime in the future.<br />

3. Do you want to live on an island if you have a chance?<br />
Not really. Islands are beautiful, but I felt really isolated (separated from others) when I lived on one before. As I'm an active person, I felt there wasn't much to do. Sure, the beach is great, but it gets boring day after day.<br />

4. What do you like to do when you are on an island?<br />
Beach of course! Behind that, I like getting to know the local culture and food. I especially enjoy drinking coconut water fresh off the palm trees and trying local fish recipes. Moreover, I enjoy getting hair braided (hairstyle) by local people.<br />

1. Do you often wear makeup?<br />
Yes, almost everyday. If I'm just bumming (relaxing) around the house, I don't bother putting make-up on. However, I have a very professional job, so I always put on my best attire (clothes) and make-up when I go to work. If I go without make-up, I feel sloppy (messy) and unprofessional. I also like to wear make up when I go out, just so I feel more confident with my appearance.<br />

2. What does wearing makeup mean to you?<br />
To me, it's a way of taking pride in (be proud of) my appearance. It makes me feel like the best version of myself. Furthermore, I'm artistic, so I see my face like a canvas (a picture painted with oil paints on canvas or other cloth)<br />

3. Do you give makeup as a gift?<br />
Sometimes, but I'm always hesitant, as I don't always know the right shade of make-up to buy for another person. If someone requests make-up, I would certainly buy it for them. However, I would feel too nervous to pick it out myself, so I would opt for buying a gift card instead.<br />

4. What do you think when you see a man wearing makeup?<br />
Nothing in particular. Everyone has the right to express themselves, so who am I to judge? I wouldn't even blink an eye if a guy walked by me wearing make-up. Actually, I often see it in my city, so I'm quite used to it.<br />

1. Do you like perfume?<br />
Yes, I do! As I'm an athlete who sweats a lot, I tend to (usually) have a strong odor. Because of this. I buy perfume incase I don't have time to take a shower before I go out.<br />

2. Do you use perfume?<br />
Everyday! I always use it after my soccer practice as well as before dates with my boyfriend. It makes me feel a lot more feminine and confident.<br />

3. How much money do you spend on perfume?<br />
Although I don't earn a great salary, I budget (plan an amount of money to be spent) to be able to buy a new bottle of Chanel perfume every few months. It costs around $80 a bottle. Sometimes when I run out (to finish) of perfume, I temporarily use a body spray which is around $15 a bottle.<br />

4. Have you ever given perfume as a gift?<br />
Hmm let me think. Actually, I haven't. I feel nervous to choose a scent for someone in case they don't like it, so I would rather give them a gift card to a department store so they can choose their own.<br />

5. Would you ever give perfume as a gift?<br />
Although I don't prefer it, I would definitely give it as a gift. However, I would make sure that I knew the brand or scent that they like before I buy it. I know that perfume is a sensitive gift to give someone!<br />

1. Who do you trust most?<br />
I would have to say my father. Although we have our differences, I know he is 100% someone I can count on (depend on). I feel that I could tell him any secret, and I know that he would never spill the beans (tell a secret) to anyone. He is a very trustworthy and sincere person.<br />

2. What kind of people do you trust?<br />
I trust people who are transparent, those who are open with their emotions. When I feel someone keeps everything inside, I wonder what it is that they have to hide, so naturally my trust lessens. Furthermore, I trust people who aren't always just looking out to gain something for themselves, and someone who doesn't have a criminal background, especially involving theft.<br />

3. Have you ever lost trust in somebody?<br />
Of course! In high school, my best friend and I were attached at the hip (very close). We used to have sleepovers (when kids sleep at each other's houses) almost every weekend, until one day my mother discovered that my friend was stealing money from her savings jar. Since that day, I felt that I couldn't trust someone who would take advantage of my mother who always opened her home to my friend.<br />

4. Do you trust artificial intelligence?<br />
That's an interesting question. Well, I believe that technology nowadays is advanced enough to create intelligence, but I wouldn't say that it's equal to human intelligence. While a robot may be better on paper (objectively more intelligent), they lack feelings, which leads me to believe that they aren't emotionally and/or socially intelligent, which ties everything together. So, all in all, I'm not overly trusting of artificial intelligence.<br />

1. Have you ever borrowed books from others? Yes, I have! Actually, my friends and I often have a book exchange. I see it as a waste of money to buy every book you want to read, so it's very effective to do this! I always look forward to (excited for) the books I'll get from them.<br />

2. Have you ever borrowed money from others?<br />
Who hasn't? It isn't something I enjoy doing, but something that has been necessary at certain points. For example, one time my washing machine and oven broke simultaneously (at the same time), so I asked my father if he could lend me some money to get a new one. I, of course, paid him back as soon as I could.<br />

3. Do you like to lend things to others?<br />
I would say so. To be honest, I'm always skeptical (suspicious) when I lend money to people because I'm afraid they won't pay me back, but I do it for family members and friends when they need it anyway. Fortunately, I have friends and family that will willingly do the same for me.<br />

4. How do you feel when people don't return things they borrowed from you?<br />
Upset, of course. I am a person of my word (does what I say), so I feel upset when others aren't. I have been very irritated several times when people, especially my little sister, has borrowed something from me and lost or damaged it. However, if it wasn't something very valuable, I try to remember that it isn't the end of the world (something big or important).<br />

5 Do people feel embarrassed when they request the things back from friends?<br />
My ears often turn red out of embarrassment when I ask things back from my friends. It's natural because I don't want to undermine the relationship we are having and requesting stuff back can hurt others' pride and self-respect.<br />

1. Do you like math?<br />
Not at all! Maths has always been my worst subject. While I can write an amazing essay or learn foreign languages easily, I can't seem to understand numbers very well. I always feel stressed and frustrated with myself in Maths class for not being able to think logically.<br />

2. Do you think females are good at maths?<br />
Hmm, I can't say. I haven't noticed whether one gender is better than the other at Maths. However, I've heard the stereotype that women don't tend to think as logically as men, so maybe this affects their mathematical abilities.<br />

3. When did you start learning Math?<br />
Since I was 6 years old, maybe even 5. I remember doing some basic addition activities, such as counting chickens on the board. After that, we progressed onto subtraction, and then even multiplication tables and division!<br />

4. Do you think maths is important?<br />
Yes, I do. However, I don't think that advanced math subjects, such as Calculus, Trigonometry, Geometry, etc. are very applicable in day-to-day life. On the other hand, basic math such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are something that we use everyday, such as at the grocery store or work.<br />

5. Who taught you maths?<br />
My teachers, with my parents' help at home. It all started with very basic equations like "If I take away one of these jelly beans, how many are there?", which my parents practiced with me at home, also. But, first and foremost, it started at school.<br />

6. Is maths difficult for you to learn?<br />
Totally! I tend to have a more abstract (illogical) brain, so I am more apt (able) to subjects like art, literature, or music. Math was always the class I would dread (not look forward to) all day. Actually, I even failed Geometry in high school.<br />

7. Do you like to use a calculator?<br />
Yes! Calculators have made life much more convenient. Thinking back, I can't remember a time without them. I remember my high school algebra teacher didn't believe in them, which made the class even more of a challenge. However, I agree with her to an extent because it strengthened my mental math (math in your head) skills!<br />

1. Do you like to smile?<br />
I love it! I have traveled extensively and seen that some other cultures smile more than others. When someone smiles, it brings me positive energy and instantly improves my mood. With this said, I have taken it upon myself to smile as much as possible to give others a warm feeling.<br />

2. How often do you smile?<br />
As much as possible! I've noticed that even when I'm having a bad day, a smile or laugh always helps. So, I try to smile whenever I meet or pass someone, as well as after a bad day.<br />

3. Do you smile when you are having your picture taken?<br />
Yes, I do! Although I prefer a more serious look for my selfies which shows off my bone structure more, I always smile in a group photo. Actually, sometimes I can't help but to smile because I am having such a good time!<br />

4. When do people smile to others?<br />
In many different cases, but I would say usually when they make eye contact with someone or to people in their workplace. In my country, people usually don't smile at everyone on the streets because that person may suspect us of wanting something from them.<br />

5. Can you sense (or feel, or tell) if someone's smile is fake?<br />
Yes, I can! I can sense a fake smile but how much it looks forced. When someone's smile is fake, they smile with just their mouth instead of their eyes. With this said, you can always tell a genuine smile by the eyes.<br />

1. How do you organize your time?<br />
Hmm, well I'm not always the most organized person, but the good thing is that I'm not a procrastinator (someone who waits until the last minute). I always do what needs to be done first, such as my errands or work tasks. After I do what I need to do, I will then allow myself to relax.<br />

2. Do you make plans every day?<br />
No, I don't. I'm more of a spontaneous (unplanned) person. I don't like to plan every second of every day, as plans can quickly change. I only plan out what I need to do and how to get it done, but I let my social interactions come up (arise) unplanned.<br />

3. Would you say you manage your time well?<br />
More or less. I'm not the most organized nor disorganized person on the planet. However, I can say with certainty that I always complete what is asked of me. On the other hand, I sometimes can't do things like plan vacations very well.<br />

4. Are you ever late for anything?<br />
Once in a blue moon (very rarely)! I am a stickler (serious) about time, so I am almost never late. When I think about it, the only times I've been late for work were because of a traffic jam or an accident.<br />

5. Do you think young people organize their time in the same way?<br />
No, I don't. I think that's too general of a question. I believe everyone organizes their time in different ways. However, young people tend to have heavy work and study schedules, so they may not be able to manage their time and tasks as well as someone who doesn't. So, in this case, young people have to prioritize(decide what is most important) more.<br />

6. What's the biggest difficulty you have when managing time?<br />
I would have to say my social life. As I have a demanding work schedule, I tend to lose track of time and forget to add in time to spend with my friends and family. I am looking for a way to manage this better.<br />

1. Do you like reading?<br />
Yes, I'm definitely a book worm (a person who loves to read)! I believe that books are a way to not only escape, but also to gain more knowledge. By the same token, people who read tend to have a richer vocabulary and a higher level of general knowledge, so they tend to have more to converse about.<br />

2. What books do you like to read?<br />
I'm definitely a fan of fiction. I don't know why, but I've always been more into reading about real-life accounts, self-help books, or biographies rather than farfetched (unreal) fantasies or science fiction novels. I know it's an unpopular opinion, but I've never liked Harry Potter or Star Wars!<br />

3. What book did you read recently?<br />
I recently read a book by a Buddhist monk called "How to Love". The book goes over (reviews) the ways to love someone in a nourishing way, such as giving them freedom and always searching for understanding rather than seeking possession.<br />

4. What did you learn from it?<br />
I learned so much from this book! I learned about different meditation uniques and some new ideas on how to define love. After reading this book, I felt in such a deep zen (relaxed) state.<br />

5. What was your favorite book as a child?<br />
I remember being very fond of a book called "My Sister's Keeper". I recall that it was the story of two sisters, one of which needed a kidney transplant. Although the sister was initially apprehensive (scared; nervous) to do so, she ended up donating a kidney to her sister and saving her. <br />
