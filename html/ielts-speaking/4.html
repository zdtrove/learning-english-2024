ðŸŽ§ <span>Good</span> <span>Afternoon</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Good</span> <span>afternoon</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Come</span> <span>in</span> <span>please</span> and have a <span>seat</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you <span>very</span> <span>much</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span>. Can I <span>take</span> a <span>look</span> <span>at</span> your <span>passport</span>, <span>please?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Yes</span>. <span>Here</span> you <span>go</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thanks</span>, and what <span>is</span> your <span>full</span> <span>name?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ My <span>name</span> <span>is</span> <span>Sara</span> <span>Akbari</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span> <span>Sara</span>. What <span>is</span> the <span>meaning</span> <span>of</span> your <span>name?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I <span>think</span> <span>Sara</span> <span>means</span> <span>pure</span> and <span>innocent</span>. <span>However</span>, <span>this</span> <span>is</span> an <span>international</span> <span>name</span>, <span>as</span> I have <span>heard</span> <span>it</span> <span>in</span> many <span>other</span> <span>languages</span> <span>as</span> <span>well</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ All <span>right</span> <span>Sara</span>. Do you <span>think</span> your <span>name</span> <span>is</span> <span>important</span> to you? Do you <span>like</span> <span>it</span> <span>or</span> you <span>would</span> <span>like</span> to <span>change</span> your <span>name?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span>, I've <span>never</span> <span>given</span> <span>it</span> <span>much</span> <span>thought</span>. I <span>think</span> <span>that</span> <span>must</span> <span>mean</span> <span>that</span> <span>I'm</span> <span>quite</span> <span>content</span> <span>with</span> the <span>name</span> I have. And <span>although</span> I <span>think</span> it's <span>quite</span> a <span>common</span> <span>name</span>, I <span>am</span> <span>nonetheless</span> <span>happy</span> <span>with</span> <span>it</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span> <span>Sara</span>. <span>Please</span> <span>describe</span> your <span>daily</span> <span>routine</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span>, <span>I'm</span> a <span>university</span> <span>student</span> <span>in</span> my <span>second</span> <span>year</span>. My <span>daily</span> <span>routine</span> <span>during</span> the <span>week</span> <span>would</span> <span>consist</span> <span>of</span> me <span>waking</span> <span>up</span> <span>quite</span> <span>early</span> <span>in</span> the <span>morning</span> <span>â€”</span> <span>I'd</span> say <span>about</span> <span>6</span> <span>o'clock</span>. <span>From</span> <span>about</span> six <span>till</span> <span>eight</span> <span>I'll</span> get <span>ready</span>, <span>I'll</span> have my <span>breakfast</span>. <span>If</span> there's any work <span>that</span> <span>needs</span> to be <span>done</span> <span>before</span> <span>attending</span> <span>class</span>, <span>I'll</span> try and fit <span>it</span> <span>in</span> there. I <span>take</span> the bus to <span>university</span>, <span>after</span> which, <span>of</span> <span>course</span>, I <span>attend</span> the <span>classes</span>. <span>Lunchtimes</span>, <span>we</span> <span>normally</span> <span>go</span> off <span>campus</span> <span>with</span> my <span>friends</span> for a <span>sandwich</span> <span>or</span> a <span>quick</span> <span>bite</span> to eat. <span>If</span> <span>we</span> have <span>more</span> <span>time</span>, <span>we</span> <span>might</span> sit <span>in</span> the <span>park</span> and <span>discuss</span> <span>sonic</span> <span>of</span> the <span>subjects</span> we're <span>doing</span>. <span>If</span> I have <span>classes</span> <span>in</span> the <span>afternoon</span>, <span>I'll</span> <span>return</span> to <span>campus</span> and <span>attend</span> <span>those</span>. <span>On</span> a <span>normal</span> day, <span>I'd</span> say <span>I'm</span> <span>finished</span> <span>at</span> <span>university</span> by <span>about</span> <span>5</span> <span>o'clock</span>. And by the <span>time</span> I get <span>home</span>, <span>it</span> <span>should</span> be <span>close</span> to <span>seven</span>. <span>After</span> <span>this</span>, <span>well</span> <span>it</span> <span>depends</span> <span>on</span> how <span>much</span> work I have to do for the <span>next</span> day. <span>Or</span>, <span>whether</span> <span>or</span> not I have <span>enough</span> <span>free</span> <span>time</span>, <span>in</span> which <span>case</span> I <span>will</span> sit <span>down</span> and <span>watch</span> <span>some</span> <span>television</span> <span>or</span> <span>spend</span> <span>some</span> <span>time</span> <span>with</span> my <span>mother</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span> <span>Sara</span>. What do you do <span>on</span> <span>weekends?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span>, <span>preferably</span>, <span>I'd</span> <span>like</span> to <span>spend</span> <span>weekends</span> <span>relaxing</span> and <span>refreshing</span> <span>myself</span> for the <span>coming</span> <span>week</span>. But, there <span>will</span> be <span>times</span> when <span>I'll</span> <span>need</span> to sit <span>down</span> and do <span>some</span> <span>studying</span>. <span>Maybe</span> I've <span>fallen</span> <span>behind</span> <span>on</span> a <span>certain</span> <span>subject</span>, <span>or</span> <span>maybe</span>! <span>need</span> to do <span>some</span> <span>research</span>. But! do <span>prefer</span> to <span>relax</span>, <span>spend</span> <span>some</span> <span>time</span> <span>with</span> my <span>family</span>, <span>maybe</span> <span>go</span> out <span>with</span> my <span>friends</span>, and <span>generally</span> <span>feel</span> <span>rested</span> for the <span>following</span> <span>week</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>OK</span>, <span>thanks</span> <span>Sara</span>. What are <span>some</span> <span>of</span> your <span>hobbies?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span>, <span>if</span>! have the <span>time</span>, I do <span>enjoy</span> <span>going</span> for a <span>swim</span> <span>every</span> <span>once</span> <span>in</span> a <span>while</span>. I <span>also</span> <span>enjoy</span> <span>going</span> <span>window</span> <span>shopping</span> <span>with</span> my <span>friends</span>, and <span>reading</span>. But <span>during</span> <span>university</span>, you have so <span>much</span> to <span>read</span> <span>that</span> I <span>sometimes</span> don't <span>feel</span> <span>like</span> <span>reading</span> <span>fiction</span> <span>during</span> my <span>spare</span> <span>time</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>OK</span> <span>Sara</span>. How <span>much</span> <span>time</span> do you <span>spend</span> <span>with</span> your <span>friends</span> <span>in</span> your <span>spare</span> <span>time?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span>, I <span>like</span> to <span>divide</span> <span>that</span> <span>spare</span> <span>time</span> <span>between</span> my <span>family</span> and my <span>friends</span>. <span>Obviously</span>, I see my <span>family</span> <span>every</span> day, <span>mostly</span> <span>over</span> a <span>meal</span> <span>in</span> the <span>evening</span>. <span>Friends</span>, it's not so. <span>Of</span> <span>course</span>, my <span>university</span> <span>friends</span> <span>I'll</span> see <span>during</span> the day, <span>if</span> <span>we</span> have <span>classes</span> <span>together</span>. But <span>other</span> <span>friends</span>, it's <span>difficult</span> to <span>catch</span> <span>up</span> <span>on</span> a <span>regular</span> <span>basis</span>. <span>I'd</span> say I wouldn't <span>mind</span> <span>spending</span> one day a <span>week</span> <span>catching</span> <span>up</span> <span>with</span> my <span>friends</span> and <span>seeing</span> what they're <span>up</span> to, and <span>exchanging</span> our <span>weekly</span> <span>stories</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span> <span>Sara</span>, now <span>we</span> <span>move</span> <span>onto</span> <span>another</span> <span>topic</span>. I <span>will</span> <span>show</span> you a <span>topic</span> <span>card</span> and I <span>would</span> <span>like</span> you to <span>talk</span> <span>about</span> the <span>topic</span> for <span>about</span> two <span>minutes</span>. You have <span>once</span> <span>minute</span> to <span>organise</span> your <span>mind</span> and <span>think</span> <span>about</span> the <span>topic</span>. <span>Here</span> <span>is</span> a <span>paper</span> and a <span>pencil</span> and you can <span>write</span> <span>down</span> <span>notes</span> <span>if</span> you <span>wish</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you <span>very</span> <span>much.<br/>

ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you <span>Sara</span>. Now I <span>would</span> <span>like</span> to ask a few <span>more</span> <span>detailed</span> <span>questions</span>. How can <span>someone</span> <span>take</span> a <span>good</span> <span>photograph</span>? <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span>, I do <span>enjoy</span> <span>photography</span>, but <span>I'm</span> <span>in</span> <span>no</span> way a <span>professional</span> <span>photographer</span>. <span>I'd</span> have to say a <span>good</span> <span>angle</span>, the <span>right</span> <span>subject</span>. I <span>think</span> <span>light</span> <span>is</span> <span>very</span> <span>important</span>, <span>obviously</span>, <span>well</span>, <span>it</span> <span>would</span> <span>depend</span> <span>on</span> the <span>subject</span> <span>as</span> <span>well</span> and <span>location</span>, but I <span>think</span> there are many <span>different</span> <span>aspects</span> <span>involved</span> <span>in</span> <span>taking</span> a <span>good</span> <span>photo</span>. <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>prefer</span> to <span>keep</span> a <span>film</span> <span>or</span> a <span>photograph?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span>, you have to <span>consider</span> <span>them</span> <span>both</span> <span>really</span>. <span>Photographs</span> are <span>obviously</span> <span>moments</span> <span>in</span> <span>time</span> <span>that</span> have <span>been</span> <span>captured</span> and you can <span>take</span> <span>them</span> out <span>at</span> any <span>given</span> <span>time</span> and have a <span>look</span> <span>at</span> <span>them</span> and <span>feel</span> <span>those</span> <span>emotions</span> <span>again</span>, and see the <span>happiness</span> <span>or</span> <span>whatever</span> the <span>occasion</span> was and what <span>feelings</span> <span>it</span> <span>induced</span> <span>in</span> the <span>people</span> <span>in</span> the <span>photograph</span> <span>or</span> the <span>subject</span> <span>of</span> the <span>photograph</span>. <span>Film</span> has its <span>advantages</span> <span>of</span> <span>being</span> <span>more</span> <span>real</span>, <span>having</span> <span>motion</span> and <span>movement</span> and <span>also</span> <span>sound</span>. But <span>on</span> a <span>personal</span> <span>level</span>, I <span>think</span> there's <span>something</span> <span>magical</span> <span>about</span> a <span>photograph</span> <span>that</span> <span>will</span> <span>never</span> be <span>about</span> a <span>film</span>. <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>prefer</span> a <span>black</span> and <span>white</span> <span>photo</span> <span>or</span> a <span>colourful</span> <span>one?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Again</span>, <span>that</span> <span>depends</span> <span>on</span> the <span>subject</span> <span>matter</span>. I <span>think</span> <span>portraits</span> are <span>more</span> <span>beautiful</span> when they're <span>black</span> and <span>white</span>. But <span>some</span> <span>landscape</span> and <span>sceneries</span> are <span>obviously</span> all the <span>more</span> <span>breathtaking</span> <span>because</span> <span>of</span> the <span>colour</span>. So <span>it</span> <span>would</span> be a <span>shame</span> to <span>take</span> the <span>photograph</span> <span>in</span> <span>black</span> and <span>white</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ How do you <span>feel</span> when you <span>look</span> <span>at</span> your <span>family</span> <span>album?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ A <span>great</span> <span>sense</span> <span>of</span> <span>nostalgia</span>. I <span>absolutely</span> <span>enjoy</span> <span>going</span> <span>through</span> my <span>family</span> <span>albums</span> and <span>looking</span> <span>at</span> my <span>parents</span> and <span>relatives</span> <span>from</span> <span>even</span> <span>before</span> I <span>existed</span>. I <span>like</span> to <span>think</span> what <span>they</span> <span>were</span> <span>thinking</span> <span>then</span> and how <span>they</span> <span>felt</span>, and the <span>funny</span> <span>part</span>, I <span>think</span>, <span>is</span> the way <span>they</span> <span>used</span> to <span>dress</span>. It's <span>just</span> <span>such</span> a <span>beautiful</span> <span>experience</span>, to be <span>able</span> to <span>go</span> <span>back</span> and see what your <span>loved</span> <span>ones</span> <span>looked</span> <span>like</span>, <span>or</span> try to <span>imagine</span> what <span>must</span> have <span>been</span> <span>going</span> <span>on</span> <span>through</span> <span>their</span> <span>minds</span> <span>at</span> the <span>time</span> when <span>this</span> <span>photograph</span> was <span>taken</span>. It's a <span>lovely</span> <span>experience</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you <span>very</span> <span>much</span> <span>Sara</span>. <span>That</span> <span>is</span> the end <span>of</span> your <span>speaking</span> <span>test</span>. Have a <span>nice</span> <span>day</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you <span>very</span> <span>much</span>. <span><br/>

ðŸŽ§ <span>Good</span> <span>Morning</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Good</span> <span>Morning</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Come</span> <span>in</span> and have a <span>seat</span> <span>please</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you <span>very</span> <span>much</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ May I have a <span>look</span> <span>at</span> your <span>passport?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Yes</span>, <span>here</span> you <span>are</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>OK</span> <span>thanks</span>, and may I have your <span>full</span> <span>name</span> <span>please?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ My <span>name</span> <span>is</span> <span>Nazli</span> <span>Parvizi</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span>, <span>thanks</span> <span>Nazli</span>. Who put <span>this</span> <span>name</span> <span>on</span> <span>you?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Nazli</span>, <span>is</span> <span>actually</span> my <span>paternal</span> <span>grandmother</span>, and my <span>parents</span> <span>decided</span> to <span>name</span> me <span>after</span> <span>her</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What <span>kinds</span> <span>of</span> <span>names</span> are <span>popular</span> <span>in</span> your <span>country?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span>, <span>I'll</span> have to say <span>that</span> there's a <span>variety</span> <span>of</span> <span>names</span>. For <span>girls</span> it's <span>mostly</span> <span>flowers</span>, <span>or</span> <span>ancient</span> <span>Persian</span> <span>names</span>, and <span>obviously</span> <span>religious</span> <span>names</span>. But for <span>boys</span>, <span>it</span> <span>tends</span> to be, I <span>think</span>, <span>mostly</span> <span>religious</span> <span>names</span> and <span>also</span> <span>ancient</span> <span>Persian</span> <span>names</span>. You <span>will</span> <span>come</span> <span>across</span> <span>quite</span> a few <span>people</span> who have <span>been</span> <span>named</span> <span>after</span> a <span>prominent</span> <span>religious</span> <span>figure</span>, a <span>historical</span> <span>religious</span> <span>figure</span>. So <span>they</span> <span>would</span> use <span>that</span> for <span>official</span> <span>purposes</span>, but <span>they</span> <span>might</span> be <span>called</span> <span>something</span> <span>totally</span> <span>different</span> <span>at</span> <span>home</span>. <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span> <span>Nazli</span>. <span>Tell</span> me, what <span>is</span> your <span>major?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I have a <span>degree</span> <span>in</span> <span>Teaching</span> <span>English</span> <span>as</span> a <span>Foreign</span> <span>Language</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>like</span> your <span>major</span>, and <span>why</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Yes</span> I do <span>indeed</span>. I <span>wanted</span> to <span>learn</span> <span>English</span> <span>fluently</span> <span>ever</span> <span>since</span> I was a <span>child</span>. So, <span>being</span> <span>lucky</span> <span>enough</span> to get <span>accepted</span> <span>on</span> <span>this</span> <span>course</span> was a <span>dream</span> <span>come</span> <span>true</span> for me. And I <span>enjoyed</span> the <span>course</span> <span>thoroughly</span>. And <span>of</span> <span>course</span>, I've <span>reached</span> my <span>childhood</span> <span>dream</span> <span>now</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ And what do you do <span>at</span> the <span>moment</span>, <span>Nazli?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>At</span> the <span>moment</span> <span>I'm</span> <span>teaching</span> <span>English</span>, <span>both</span> <span>at</span> an <span>institute</span> and <span>also</span> <span>privately</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Ok</span> <span>thanks</span>. And <span>tell</span> me, what do you <span>like</span> <span>about</span> your <span>job?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span>, what I <span>enjoy</span> the <span>most</span> <span>about</span> my <span>job</span>, <span>as</span> I <span>think</span> <span>most</span> <span>teachers</span> <span>would</span> <span>agree</span>, <span>is</span> the <span>sense</span> <span>of</span> <span>satisfaction</span>, and <span>gratification</span> you get when your <span>students</span> <span>learn</span> what you're <span>actually</span> <span>trying</span> so <span>hard</span>, and they're <span>trying</span> so <span>hard</span> to. <span>Nothing</span> <span>replaces</span> <span>that</span>, I <span>think</span>, <span>as</span> a <span>teacher</span>. It's the <span>most</span> <span>wonderful</span> <span>feeling</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Is</span> there <span>anything</span> you <span>dislike</span> <span>about</span> your <span>job?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span> I wouldn't <span>go</span> <span>as</span> far to say <span>dislike</span>. But I <span>find</span> <span>it</span> <span>quite</span> <span>frustrating</span> <span>sometimes</span> <span>if</span> a <span>student</span> <span>is</span> <span>lacking</span> <span>in</span> <span>concentration</span>, <span>or</span> <span>is</span> not <span>even</span> <span>interested</span> <span>in</span> <span>learning</span> <span>this</span> <span>language</span>. You do <span>come</span> <span>across</span> <span>people</span> who are <span>forced</span> by <span>parents</span>, <span>or</span> <span>think</span> it's <span>absolutely</span> <span>necessary</span> to <span>learn</span> <span>English</span>, but don't <span>really</span> <span>commit</span> to <span>it</span> <span>much</span> <span>as</span> <span>they</span> <span>could</span>. <span>Trying</span> to <span>encourage</span> <span>these</span> <span>students</span>, <span>it</span> <span>is</span> <span>quite</span> an <span>ordeal</span>. But it's not <span>something</span> I <span>would</span> <span>hate</span> my <span>job</span> for. It's <span>something</span> that's <span>just</span> an <span>obstacle</span> <span>that</span> I have to <span>overcome</span> <span>as</span> a <span>teacher</span>. <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span> <span>Nazli</span>. <span>Would</span> you <span>like</span> to have your <span>own</span> <span>business</span> one <span>day?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Yes</span>, <span>actually</span>. My <span>ultimate</span> <span>dream</span> <span>would</span> be to <span>open</span> an <span>English</span> <span>Language</span> <span>institute</span>, which <span>would</span> <span>of</span> <span>course</span> be for all <span>ages</span> and <span>levels</span>. <span>This</span> <span>would</span> <span>probably</span> not <span>materialise</span> for <span>quite</span> <span>some</span> <span>time</span> <span>yet</span>. But I <span>am</span> <span>working</span> my way <span>towards</span> <span>reaching</span> <span>this</span> <span>goal</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you <span>Nazli</span>. Now <span>we</span> <span>move</span> <span>on</span> to a <span>topic</span>. I <span>would</span> <span>like</span> to <span>show</span> you a <span>topic</span> <span>card</span>. You have to <span>talk</span> <span>about</span> the <span>topic</span> for <span>about</span> two <span>minutes</span>. You have one <span>minute</span> to <span>think</span> <span>about</span> the <span>topic</span>. <span>Here</span> <span>is</span> a <span>paper</span> and <span>pencil</span>, you can <span>write</span> <span>down</span> <span>notes</span> <span>if</span> you <span>wish</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you <span>very</span> <span>much</span>. <span><br/>

ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span>, <span>thanks</span> <span>Nazli</span>. Now I <span>would</span> <span>like</span> to ask a few <span>more</span> <span>questions</span>. What <span>is</span> the <span>difference</span> <span>between</span> a <span>letter</span> and an <span>email?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span>, <span>we</span> can say the <span>main</span> <span>difference</span> <span>is</span> I <span>suppose</span> the <span>speed</span> <span>in</span> which <span>we</span> <span>receive</span> a <span>letter</span> <span>as</span> <span>opposed</span> to an <span>email</span>. <span>Modern</span> <span>life</span> <span>probably</span> <span>necessitates</span> <span>speedier</span> <span>access</span> to <span>communication</span>. So <span>therefore</span>, an <span>email</span> <span>is</span> <span>much</span> <span>more</span> <span>convenient</span> and <span>less</span> <span>time-consuming</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ How do you <span>think</span> <span>internet</span> has <span>changed</span> <span>traditional</span> <span>letter</span> <span>writing?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>mean</span> <span>in</span> the <span>aspect</span> <span>of</span> <span>whether</span> it's a <span>good</span> <span>change</span> <span>or</span> a <span>negative</span> <span>change?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ That's <span>right</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span>, I <span>think</span> <span>that</span> <span>it</span> has a <span>little</span> bit <span>of</span> <span>both</span>. The <span>internet</span> <span>facilitates</span> the <span>speed</span> <span>in</span> which you can <span>communicate</span> <span>important</span> <span>matters</span> and <span>personal</span> <span>matters</span> <span>with</span> <span>others</span>. And <span>also</span>, <span>it</span> doesn't <span>necessitate</span> a <span>person</span> <span>sitting</span> <span>down</span> and <span>writing</span> a <span>letter</span>, and <span>having</span> to <span>post</span> <span>it</span>, and <span>waiting</span> for the <span>time</span> <span>that</span> <span>it</span> <span>would</span> <span>take</span> to <span>deliver</span> <span>in</span> <span>order</span> to get a <span>reply</span>. <span>With</span> the <span>internet</span> you can <span>write</span> a <span>message</span> and <span>convey</span> a <span>certain</span> <span>thing</span> <span>within</span> <span>minutes</span>, and <span>receive</span> a <span>reply</span> <span>within</span> <span>minutes</span>. <span>On</span> the <span>downside</span>, I <span>would</span> have to say <span>that</span> an <span>email</span> <span>lacks</span> the <span>emotion</span> <span>that</span> <span>maybe</span> the <span>sender</span> <span>is</span> <span>trying</span> to <span>convey</span>. <span>With</span> <span>letters</span> you can <span>perhaps</span> <span>tell</span> a lot <span>about</span> its <span>context</span> <span>because</span> <span>of</span> the <span>person's</span> <span>handwriting</span>. <span>It</span> has a <span>generally</span> <span>more</span> <span>personal</span> <span>touch</span> to <span>it</span>, which I <span>think</span> <span>is</span> <span>quite</span> <span>special</span>. So, <span>maybe</span> <span>emails</span> are a <span>good</span> <span>thing</span>, but <span>on</span> <span>special</span> <span>occasions</span> for the <span>people</span> who <span>matter</span> to you, <span>sending</span> the <span>occasional</span> <span>letter</span> I <span>think</span> <span>is</span> a <span>nice</span> <span>gesture</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ And the <span>last</span> <span>question</span> <span>Nazli</span>. <span>Would</span> <span>post</span> <span>offices</span> <span>disappear</span> <span>in</span> the <span>next</span> <span>fifty</span> <span>years?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span>, I wouldn't be <span>surprised</span> <span>if</span> <span>they</span> did, <span>or</span> <span>at</span> <span>least</span> <span>they</span> <span>were</span> <span>diminished</span> <span>in</span> <span>numbers</span> <span>greatly</span>. The <span>reason</span> <span>is</span> <span>that</span> <span>obviously</span> <span>people</span> are <span>relying</span> <span>more</span> and <span>more</span> <span>on</span> the <span>internet</span> to <span>communicate</span>. But <span>on</span> the <span>other</span> <span>hand</span>, <span>as</span> <span>is</span> the <span>case</span> now, a lot <span>of</span> <span>people</span> <span>around</span> the <span>world</span> <span>still</span> don't have <span>access</span> to the <span>internet</span>, so I <span>think</span> <span>it</span> wouldn't <span>altogether</span> <span>disappear</span>. <span>At</span> the end <span>of</span> the day you can't <span>send</span> a <span>parcel</span>, <span>or</span> a <span>small</span> <span>package</span> via the <span>internet</span>. So <span>perhaps</span> not <span>entirely</span>, but <span>maybe</span> you'd <span>come</span> <span>across</span> <span>them</span> a lot <span>less</span> <span>often</span> <span>than</span> you do <span>now</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you <span>very</span> <span>much</span>, <span>Nazli</span>. <span>This</span> <span>is</span> the end <span>of</span> the <span>speaking</span> <span>test</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> <span>you.<br/>

ðŸŽ§ <span>Good</span> <span>Afternoon</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Good</span> <span>Afternoon</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Come</span> <span>in</span> <span>please</span> and have a <span>seat</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> <span>you</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ May I have a <span>look</span> <span>at</span> your <span>passport</span> <span>please?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Yes</span>. <span>Here</span> you <span>are</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Fine</span>, <span>thanks</span>. And may I have your <span>full</span> <span>name?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ My <span>name</span> <span>is</span> <span>Maryam</span> <span>Bahri</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span> <span>Maryam</span>, <span>describe</span> your <span>family</span> <span>please</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span> there's <span>five</span> <span>people</span> <span>in</span> my <span>family:</span> my <span>parents</span>, and my two <span>siblings</span> and I. <span>I'm</span> the <span>youngest</span> <span>child</span>. I have an <span>older</span> <span>sister</span> which <span>is</span> the <span>oldest</span> <span>child</span>, and <span>of</span> <span>course</span> my <span>brother</span>, who's the <span>middle</span> <span>child</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thanks</span>. Do you get <span>along</span> <span>well</span> <span>with</span> your <span>family</span> <span>members?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span> <span>we</span> try to get <span>on</span> <span>as</span> <span>well</span> <span>as</span> <span>we</span> can, but <span>obviously</span> <span>each</span> <span>of</span> <span>us</span> has a <span>very</span> <span>different</span> <span>character</span> to the <span>other</span>. So <span>yes</span>, <span>because</span> we're not a <span>small</span> <span>family</span> <span>we</span> try to <span>learn</span>, <span>or</span> <span>we</span> <span>were</span> <span>taught</span> <span>early</span> <span>on</span> to <span>appreciate</span> our <span>differences</span> and try and get <span>along</span> <span>as</span> <span>best</span> <span>as</span> <span>we</span> <span>can</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thanks</span> <span>Maryam</span>. What do you <span>like</span> to do to <span>together</span> <span>as</span> a <span>family?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>If</span> <span>we</span> haven't <span>seen</span> <span>each</span> <span>other</span> for a <span>long</span> <span>stretch</span> <span>of</span> <span>time</span>, what <span>we</span> <span>most</span> <span>like</span> to do <span>is</span> get <span>together</span> for a <span>family</span> <span>meal</span>, and <span>discuss</span> the <span>things</span> <span>that</span> are <span>going</span> <span>on</span> <span>in</span> our <span>lives</span>. <span>We</span> <span>tend</span> to do <span>that</span> <span>at</span> <span>least</span> <span>once</span> a <span>week</span> <span>with</span> all the <span>family</span> <span>gathered</span> <span>at</span> my <span>parent's</span> <span>house</span>. It's a <span>very</span> <span>enjoyable</span> <span>time</span>, <span>because</span> you get to <span>catch</span> <span>up</span> and <span>learn</span> what your <span>family</span> are <span>doing</span>. And <span>also</span>, <span>give</span> <span>each</span> <span>other</span> <span>advice</span> <span>on</span> <span>different</span> <span>subjects</span> <span>or</span> <span>difficulties</span> <span>we</span> <span>might</span> be <span>having</span>. <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Are <span>people</span> <span>in</span> your <span>country</span> <span>generally</span> <span>close</span> to <span>their</span> <span>families?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I <span>would</span> say <span>yes</span>, <span>very</span> <span>much</span> so. <span>In</span> our <span>culture</span> it's <span>very</span> <span>important</span>. It's a <span>very</span> <span>family-oriented</span> <span>culture</span>. <span>Families</span> <span>tend</span> to <span>stay</span> <span>in</span> <span>touch</span> a lot. And <span>even</span> <span>if</span> there's <span>distance</span>, for <span>whatever</span> <span>reason</span>, <span>they</span> <span>always</span> <span>tend</span> to <span>keep</span> <span>in</span> <span>touch</span> and <span>inform</span> <span>each</span> <span>other</span> <span>of</span> <span>their</span> <span>well-being</span>. I <span>think</span> the <span>culture</span> <span>encourages</span> <span>this</span>. <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span> <span>Maryam</span>. What <span>kind</span> <span>of</span> <span>building</span> do you <span>live</span> <span>in?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I <span>live</span> <span>on</span> the <span>fifth</span> <span>floor</span> <span>of</span> a <span>twelve-storey</span> <span>apartment</span> <span>building</span>. My <span>apartment</span> <span>is</span> not <span>very</span> <span>large</span>, but <span>it</span> has a <span>nice</span> <span>living</span> <span>area</span> and two <span>smallish</span> <span>bedrooms</span>. What I <span>like</span> <span>most</span> <span>about</span> my <span>building</span> <span>is</span> my <span>neighbours</span>, who are <span>very</span> <span>kind</span>, and <span>they</span> <span>keep</span> to <span>themselves</span>, but you can <span>rely</span> <span>on</span> <span>their</span> <span>help</span> <span>if</span> you <span>need</span> <span>it<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span> <span>thanks</span> <span>Maryam</span>. Do you <span>like</span> your <span>neighbourhood?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I have to say <span>yes</span>, <span>because</span> it's <span>quite</span> <span>central</span> and <span>therefore</span> <span>everything</span> <span>is</span> <span>easily</span> <span>within</span> <span>access</span>. The <span>downside</span> to my <span>neighbourhood</span> <span>is</span> <span>maybe</span> the <span>traffic</span> and the <span>noise</span>. But all <span>in</span> all, I <span>like</span> <span>it</span>. I do. <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Have you <span>ever</span> <span>thought</span> <span>about</span> <span>changing</span> your <span>apartment?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Not for the <span>moment</span>, <span>no</span>. But <span>if</span> our <span>family</span> <span>grows</span>, <span>then</span> <span>obviously</span> <span>we</span> <span>will</span> have to <span>move</span> <span>into</span> a <span>bigger</span> <span>apartment<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span>, <span>thanks</span> <span>Maryam</span>. Now let's <span>move</span> <span>onto</span> the <span>topic</span> <span>of</span> <span>libraries</span>. <span>1</span> <span>would</span> <span>like</span> you to <span>describe</span> a <span>library</span> you have <span>been</span> to. You have to <span>talk</span> <span>about</span> <span>this</span> <span>topic</span> for two <span>minutes</span>, and you have one <span>minute</span> to <span>think</span> <span>about</span> the <span>topic</span>. <span>Here</span> <span>is</span> a <span>paper</span> and <span>pencil</span>. You can <span>think</span> <span>about</span> the <span>topic</span>, and <span>write</span> <span>down</span> your <span>notes</span> <span>if</span> you <span>wish</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you <span>very</span> <span>much.<br/></span>
