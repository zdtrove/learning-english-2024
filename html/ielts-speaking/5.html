ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span> <span>Maryam</span>, now I <span>would</span> <span>like</span> to ask a few <span>more</span> <span>detailed</span> <span>questions</span> <span>about</span> the <span>same</span> <span>topic</span>. <span>Is</span> <span>that</span> <span>library</span> <span>useful</span> for <span>children</span>, <span>or</span> for <span>adults?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span>, <span>seeing</span> <span>as</span> <span>it</span> was <span>located</span> <span>on</span> a <span>university</span> <span>campus</span>, <span>it</span> was <span>specifically</span> for <span>student's</span> and <span>professor's</span> use. But there <span>were</span> <span>some</span> <span>major</span> <span>children's</span> <span>novels</span> and <span>works</span> <span>in</span> the <span>collection</span> <span>obviously</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ How do you <span>think</span> <span>that</span> <span>library</span> has <span>changed?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span> I haven't <span>been</span> there for <span>many</span> <span>years</span> now, but I have <span>been</span> <span>told</span> <span>that</span> it's <span>expanded</span>. The <span>building</span> has <span>been</span> <span>expanded</span>. <span>I'm</span> <span>sure</span> <span>this</span> <span>is</span> due to the <span>numerous</span> <span>books</span> <span>they</span> <span>must</span> have <span>accumulated</span> <span>since</span> my <span>last</span> <span>visit</span>. And <span>also</span>, I've <span>been</span> <span>told</span> <span>that</span> the <span>whole</span> <span>library</span> has <span>been</span> <span>digitalised</span> and the <span>books</span> are now <span>available</span> <span>as</span> <span>e-books</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span>. What <span>skills</span> <span>should</span> a <span>librarian</span> <span>have?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span> I <span>think</span> <span>as</span> a <span>librarian</span>, it's a <span>pre-requisite</span> to have a <span>good</span> <span>knowledge</span> <span>of</span> <span>literature</span>, and <span>also</span> <span>of</span> the <span>books</span> <span>available</span> <span>in</span> the <span>library</span> you're <span>working</span> <span>at</span>. I <span>think</span> <span>another</span> <span>thing</span> <span>that</span> <span>helps</span> <span>is</span> <span>patience</span> and <span>people-skills</span>. You have to <span>manage</span> the <span>people</span> <span>attending</span> the <span>library</span>, <span>trying</span> to <span>keep</span> the <span>peace</span> <span>of</span> the <span>environment</span>, <span>trying</span> to <span>keep</span> <span>it</span> a <span>calm</span> <span>atmosphere</span>. And <span>also</span>, I <span>think</span> <span>perhaps</span> <span>enjoying</span> <span>solitude</span> <span>at</span> <span>long</span> <span>stretches</span> <span>of</span> <span>time</span> <span>is</span> <span>also</span> a <span>benefit</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Is</span> <span>it</span> <span>important</span> to <span>take</span> <span>children</span> to <span>libraries?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span>, I <span>think</span> it's <span>very</span> <span>important</span> to <span>introduce</span> <span>children</span> to <span>books</span> <span>as</span> <span>soon</span> <span>as</span> <span>possible</span>, <span>as</span> <span>early</span> <span>on</span> <span>in</span> <span>life</span> <span>as</span> you can. <span>Of</span> <span>course</span> you can do <span>this</span> by <span>buying</span> <span>books</span> for your <span>children</span>, but <span>obviously</span> you <span>would</span> <span>never</span> be <span>able</span> to buy all the <span>books</span> <span>available</span> <span>at</span> a <span>library</span> for your <span>child</span>. So <span>yes</span>, I <span>think</span> <span>taking</span> <span>children</span> to <span>libraries</span> to <span>enhance</span> <span>their</span> <span>knowledge</span> and <span>their</span> <span>curiosity</span>, and <span>exposing</span> <span>them</span> to the <span>variety</span> <span>available</span> there <span>is</span> <span>very</span> <span>important</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you <span>very</span> <span>much</span> <span>Maryam</span>. <span>This</span> <span>is</span> the end <span>of</span> the <span>interview</span>, and have a <span>very</span> <span>nice</span> <span>day</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you <span>very</span> <span>much</span>. <span><br/>

ðŸŽ§ What's the <span>weather</span> <span>like</span> <span>in</span> your <span>home</span> <span>town?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span>, <span>in</span> <span>Tehran</span> the <span>weather</span> <span>is</span> <span>very</span> <span>diverse</span>. <span>We</span> have <span>4</span> <span>seasons</span> <span>exactly;</span> <span>it</span> can be <span>very</span> hot <span>in</span> the <span>summer</span>, <span>very</span> hot and dry, and <span>extremely</span> <span>cold</span> <span>in</span> the <span>winter</span>. The <span>temperature</span> can <span>go</span> <span>down</span> to <span>minus</span> <span>17</span> and <span>we</span> <span>used</span> to have a lot <span>of</span> <span>snow</span> <span>that</span> <span>stopped</span> for a <span>while</span> <span></span>, but <span>in</span> <span>recent</span> <span>years</span> it's <span>been</span> <span>snowing</span> <span>more</span> and <span>more<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Ok</span>, <span>thanks</span> <span>Ladan</span>, <span>does</span> the <span>weather</span> <span>affect</span> your <span>mood?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I <span>think</span> the <span>weather</span> <span>probably</span> <span>affects</span> <span>everybody's</span> <span>mood</span>. <span>Some</span> <span>people</span> <span>feel</span> <span>more</span> <span>energetic</span> and <span>cheerful</span> <span>under</span> <span>blue</span> sky <span>with</span> the sun <span>shining</span>, and <span>perhaps</span> the wet <span>weather</span> <span>dampens</span> <span>their</span> <span>mood</span> and <span>makes</span> <span>some</span> <span>feel</span> <span>depressed</span> but there are <span>many</span> <span>people</span> who <span>prefer</span> you <span>call</span> <span>it</span> <span>rainy</span> <span>weather</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What <span>is</span> your <span>favorite</span> <span>season</span> <span>of</span> the <span>year?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I <span>personally</span> <span>really</span> <span>enjoy</span> <span>autumn</span> <span>because</span> I <span>think</span> <span>everything</span> <span>looks</span> <span>more</span> <span>beautiful</span>. The <span>colors</span> are <span>warm</span>, the <span>trees</span> <span>look</span> <span>beautiful</span>, the <span>weather</span> <span>is</span> <span>mild</span>. <span>It</span> <span>is</span> <span>neither</span> too hot <span>nor</span> <span>cold</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thanks</span>. <span>Ladan</span>, what do you <span>enjoy</span> <span>doing</span> <span>in</span> hot <span>weather?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span> <span>actually</span>, the <span>heat</span> doesn't <span>agree</span> <span>with</span> me and I don't <span>feel</span> <span>very</span> <span>comfortable</span> <span>in</span> hot <span>weather</span>. But <span>if</span>! had to <span>choose</span> an <span>activity</span>, I <span>suppose</span> <span>it</span> <span>would</span> be <span>something</span> <span>relaxing</span>, may be a <span>short</span> <span>walk</span> <span>somewhere</span>, may be <span>sitting</span> <span>in</span> <span>cafÃ©</span> <span>outside</span>, and <span>having</span> a <span>cool</span> <span>drink</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>O.K</span>. Now let's <span>move</span> to <span>another</span> <span>topic</span>, do you <span>watch</span> <span>TV</span> a <span>lot?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span>, <span>if</span>! have <span>time</span>, <span>yes</span>, but <span>I'm</span> <span>quite</span> <span>busy</span> <span>with</span> my <span>studies</span> <span>at</span> <span>moment<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Ok</span>, what do you <span>usually</span> <span>watch</span> <span>on</span> <span>TV?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I <span>enjoy</span> <span>documentaries</span>. I <span>tend</span> to sit and <span>watch</span> the <span>documentaries</span> when <span>they</span> <span>happen</span> to be <span>on</span> <span>because</span> it's <span>about</span> <span>life</span>, it's <span>about</span> <span>reality</span> and you <span>learn</span> <span>something</span> <span>from</span> <span>these</span> <span>programs</span>, <span>other</span> <span>than</span> <span>that</span> I <span>enjoy</span> <span>comedy</span> and I <span>usually</span> try to <span>keep</span> <span>up</span> <span>with</span> the <span>news</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span>, <span>Ladan</span>. What are the <span>most</span> <span>popular</span> <span>programs</span> <span>in</span> your <span>country?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I <span>think</span> <span>in</span> <span>Iran</span> I <span>would</span> have to say, <span>at</span> the top <span>of</span> the <span>list</span> <span>would</span> be <span>sports</span>, and <span>then</span> may be <span>these</span> <span>TV</span> <span>series</span> <span>that</span> <span>seem</span> to be <span>very</span> <span>popular</span> <span>with</span> <span>families</span>, <span>they</span> <span>tend</span> to be <span>quite</span> <span>late</span> <span>at</span> <span>night</span> <span>around</span> <span>10</span> <span>o'clock</span>, so <span>that</span> the <span>whole</span> <span>family</span> can sit and <span>watch</span> <span>it</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Alright</span>, <span>Ladan</span>, what are <span>some</span> <span>disadvantages</span> <span>of</span> <span>TV?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I <span>think</span> <span>TV</span> <span>is</span> a <span>good</span> <span>thing</span> all <span>in</span> all <span>in</span> <span>moderations</span>. I <span>think</span> <span>maybe</span> has <span>decreased</span> the <span>amount</span> <span>of</span> <span>interaction</span> <span>among</span> <span>families</span> have <span>with</span> <span>each</span> <span>other</span> <span>because</span> <span>while</span> <span>they</span> are <span>at</span> <span>home</span>, <span>they</span> sit <span>in</span> <span>front</span> <span>of</span> <span>television</span> and <span>focus</span> <span>on</span> one <span>program</span> <span>instead</span> <span>of</span> <span>talking</span> to <span>each</span> <span>other</span>, <span>exchanging</span> <span>their</span> <span>daily</span> <span>activities</span> and <span>experiences</span> and <span>children's</span> <span>television</span> <span>should</span> be <span>supervised</span> <span>if</span> not, <span>they</span> <span>probably</span> <span>will</span> <span>spend</span> too <span>much</span> <span>time</span> <span>in</span> <span>front</span> <span>of</span> <span>it</span> and <span>this</span> <span>stops</span> <span>some</span> <span>from</span> <span>being</span> <span>physically</span> and <span>mentally</span> <span>active</span> <span>elsewhere</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Ok</span>, <span>thanks</span> <span>Ladan</span>. NOW, let's <span>move</span> <span>onto</span> a <span>topic</span>. I <span>would</span> <span>like</span> you to <span>describe</span> a pet <span>that</span> you <span>or</span> <span>someone</span> <span>else</span> you <span>know</span> <span>used</span> to have, you have one <span>minute</span> to <span>think</span> <span>about</span> the <span>topic</span> and <span>then</span> I <span>want</span> you to <span>talk</span> <span>about</span> <span>2</span> <span>minutes</span>, <span>here</span> <span>is</span> <span>paper</span> and <span>pencil</span> you can <span>write</span> your <span>notes</span> <span>if</span> you <span>wish</span>.<br/>

ðŸŽ§ <span>Ok</span> <span>Ladan</span>, I <span>would</span> <span>like</span> to ask you a few <span>more</span> <span>detailed</span> <span>questions</span> <span>about</span> the <span>same</span> <span>topic</span>. Why do you <span>think</span> <span>some</span> <span>people</span> <span>keep</span> <span>pets?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span>, the <span>reason</span> for <span>some</span> <span>people</span> <span>is</span> <span>because</span> <span>they</span> are <span>very</span> <span>fond</span> <span>of</span> <span>animals</span>. May be <span>they've</span> <span>been</span> <span>brought</span> <span>up</span> <span>with</span> <span>animals</span> <span>in</span> a <span>house</span>, so it's <span>just</span> a <span>part</span> <span>of</span> <span>their</span> <span>normal</span> <span>life</span>. I <span>think</span> for <span>others</span>, <span>it</span> <span>is</span> <span>because</span> <span>of</span> <span>their</span> <span>loneliness</span>, and the end <span>of</span> the day when you <span>come</span> <span>home</span> <span>if</span> <span>it</span> <span>depresses</span> you there <span>is</span> <span>no</span> one there, it's <span>good</span> to have a <span>living</span> <span>breathing</span> <span>animal</span> <span>waiting</span> for <span>you</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ what <span>kinds</span> <span>of</span> <span>pets</span> are <span>popular</span> <span>in</span> your <span>country?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>I'</span> <span>m</span> <span>afraid</span> <span>some</span> <span>animals</span> <span>in</span> <span>general</span> are not <span>popular</span>. <span>Domesticated</span> <span>animals</span> <span>like</span> <span>pets</span> are not <span>very</span> <span>popular</span>. <span>It</span> <span>is</span> not <span>in</span> our <span>culture</span> to <span>keep</span> <span>animals</span> <span>in</span> the <span>house</span>. <span>However</span>, there are <span>many</span> <span>people</span> who <span>own</span> <span>dogs</span>. <span>We</span> have <span>quite</span> a few dog <span>lovers</span>, <span>cats</span> <span>less</span> and <span>less</span>, there are <span>people</span> who <span>feed</span> <span>them</span> <span>occasionally</span> <span>outside</span> <span>of</span> <span>their</span> <span>home</span>. I <span>would</span> say <span>perhaps</span> an <span>animal</span> <span>with</span> <span>less</span> <span>fuss</span> and <span>less</span> fur <span>like</span> <span>parrots</span> <span>or</span> <span>goldfish</span> <span>is</span> the <span>popular</span> <span>type</span> <span>in</span> my <span>country</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Why do you <span>think</span> <span>some</span> <span>people</span> <span>hate</span> <span>keeping</span> <span>pets</span>, <span>while</span> <span>others</span> <span>like</span> <span>it?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Again</span>, I <span>think</span> <span>that</span> <span>goes</span> <span>back</span> to what you are <span>brought</span> <span>up</span> <span>with</span> and <span>personal</span> <span>feeling</span> <span>towards</span> <span>pets</span> <span>.I</span> <span>think</span> one <span>reason</span> <span>people</span> <span>might</span> not <span>like</span> <span>keeping</span> <span>pets</span> <span>is</span> the <span>trouble</span> <span>they</span> have to <span>go</span> <span>through</span> <span>in</span> <span>order</span> to <span>look</span> <span>after</span> the pet <span>properly</span>. <span>Of</span> <span>course</span> <span>once</span> you <span>take</span> <span>in</span> a pet, you are <span>obliged</span> to <span>look</span> <span>after</span> <span>it</span> <span>properly</span>, <span>feed</span> <span>it</span> <span>on</span> the <span>regular</span> <span>basis</span>, <span>make</span> <span>sure</span> <span>it</span> has a <span>clean</span> dry <span>place</span> to <span>sleep</span> and <span>also</span> <span>make</span> <span>sure</span> <span>it</span> <span>gets</span> <span>enough</span> <span>activities</span> <span>during</span> the <span>day</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thanks</span> <span>Ladan</span>, one <span>more</span> <span>question</span>. What are the <span>limitations</span> <span>in</span> your <span>country</span> for <span>keeping</span> <span>pets?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span> <span>as</span> I <span>mentioned</span> <span>before</span> <span>because</span> <span>of</span> our <span>culture</span> <span>,perhaps</span> our <span>religion</span>, <span>people</span> who <span>keep</span> <span>dogs</span> have a <span>pretty</span> <span>difficult</span> <span>time</span> <span>because</span> <span>dogs</span> <span>need</span> <span>exercise;</span> you can't <span>keep</span> <span>them</span> <span>in</span> the <span>house</span> all day <span>long</span>, you <span>need</span> to <span>take</span> <span>them</span> out for a <span>walk</span>. <span>Perhaps</span> <span>people</span> <span>in</span> the <span>streets</span> <span>would</span> not <span>welcome</span> <span>this</span>. <span>In</span> <span>fact</span> I <span>think</span> <span>they</span> are <span>extremely</span> <span>frowned</span> <span>upon</span>. I <span>think</span> <span>another</span> <span>issue</span> <span>might</span> be the <span>expense</span> <span>of</span> <span>keeping</span> a pet <span></span>. <span>Ever</span> <span>since</span> a dog, <span>well</span> there <span>is</span> not dog <span>food</span> <span>in</span> a can, <span>ready</span> <span>available</span> <span>in</span> <span>every</span> <span>supermarket</span> so you <span>would</span> have to <span>spend</span> <span>more</span> <span>money</span> and <span>time</span> <span>in</span> <span>making</span> for your pet <span>dog</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you <span>very</span> <span>much</span> <span>Ladan</span>. <span>This</span> <span>is</span> the end <span>of</span> your <span>interview</span>, have a <span>nice</span> <span>time<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> <span>you<br/></span>
