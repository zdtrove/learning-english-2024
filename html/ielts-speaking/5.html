ðŸŽ§ Alright <span>Maryam</span>, now I would like to ask a few more <span>detailed</span> <span>questions</span> about the same <span>topic</span>. Is that <span>library</span> <span>useful</span> for children, or for <span>adults</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, <span>seeing</span> as it was <span>located</span> on a university <span>campus</span>, it was <span>specifically</span> for <span>student's</span> and <span>professor's</span> use. But there were some <span>major</span> <span>children's</span> <span>novels</span> and <span>works</span> in the <span>collection</span> <span>obviously</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ How do you think that <span>library</span> has <span>changed</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Well I haven't been there for many years now, but I have been told that it's <span>expanded</span>. The <span>building</span> has been <span>expanded</span>. I'm sure this is due to the <span>numerous</span> books they must have <span>accumulated</span> since my last visit. And also, I've been told that the whole <span>library</span> has been <span>digitalised</span> and the books are now <span>available</span> as <span>e-books</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Alright. What <span>skills</span> should a <span>librarian</span> <span>have</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Well I think as a <span>librarian</span>, it's a <span>pre-requisite</span> to have a good <span>knowledge</span> of <span>literature</span>, and also of the books <span>available</span> in the <span>library</span> you're working at. I think another thing that helps is <span>patience</span> and <span>people-skills</span>. You have to <span>manage</span> the people <span>attending</span> the <span>library</span>, trying to keep the <span>peace</span> of the <span>environment</span>, trying to keep it a <span>calm</span> <span>atmosphere</span>. And also, I think <span>perhaps</span> <span>enjoying</span> <span>solitude</span> at long <span>stretches</span> of time is also a <span>benefit</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Is it important to take children to <span>libraries</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, I think it's very important to <span>introduce</span> children to books as soon as <span>possible</span>, as <span>early</span> on in life as you can. Of course you can do this by <span>buying</span> books for your children, but <span>obviously</span> you would never be able to buy all the books <span>available</span> at a <span>library</span> for your <span>child</span>. So yes, I think taking children to <span>libraries</span> to <span>enhance</span> their <span>knowledge</span> and their <span>curiosity</span>, and <span>exposing</span> them to the <span>variety</span> <span>available</span> there is very important.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Thank you very much <span>Maryam</span>. This is the end of the <span>interview</span>, and have a very nice day.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Thank you very much. <span><br/>
</span> <br/>

ðŸŽ§ Good morning, please come in and have a <span>seat</span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Good morning, <span>ma'am</span>. Thanks.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ May I have you full <span>name</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Sure, my name is <span>Laleh</span> <span>Kashani</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Thank you <span>Laleh</span>. Can I have a look at your <span>passport</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Sure, there you go.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Alright <span>Laleh</span>, I'm going to ask you a few personal <span>questions</span>. Do you <span>watch</span> <span>TV</span> a lot?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, not really. I'm not a <span>couch</span> <span>potato</span>. I don't think I am a <span>TV</span> <span>addict</span> but when I get back home in the <span>evening</span> I really like to lie down and <span>relax</span>, <span>switch</span> <span>onto</span> a <span>channel</span> and probably <span>watch</span> <span>TV</span> <span>series</span> or <span>news</span> <span>channels</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What do you usually <span>watch</span> on <span>TV</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, that's <span>interesting</span>, in <span>fact</span> a very good <span>question</span>. Let me see, well, most of the time I really like to <span>follow</span> the <span>current</span> <span>news</span>, so <span>basically</span> I <span>watch</span> <span>news</span> <span>channels</span>. <span>Probably</span>, <span>late</span> at <span>night</span> I <span>switch</span> on the <span>channel</span> which has <span>TV</span> <span>series</span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Alright, what's the most <span>popular</span> <span>program</span> in your <span>country</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, I <span>suppose</span> <span>among</span> the people, probably <span>TV</span> <span>series</span> and <span>documentaries</span> are the most <span>popular</span> <span>TV</span> <span>programs</span>. <span>Moreover</span>, I <span>suppose</span> many people also are interested in <span>following</span> the <span>news</span>, so many of them in <span>fact</span>, <span>follow</span> the <span>current</span> <span>news</span> through <span>TV</span> <span>channels</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What are some of the <span>disadvantages</span> of <span>TV</span> in your <span>opinion</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Well in my <span>opinion</span>, there might be some <span>disadvantages</span>, in my <span>view</span> let's say, It takes the time of the people and the <span>families</span> <span>especially</span> when <span>family</span> <span>member</span> sit together, watching <span>TV</span> <span>instead</span> of having <span>interaction</span> <span>conversation</span>, they have to just focus their <span>attention</span> on what's going on <span>TV</span>, so actually it <span>gives</span> less time to <span>family</span> <span>members</span> to be together and have <span>friendly</span> <span>chat</span> <span>,and</span> also for the <span>kids</span>, I think, it will not be that <span>beneficial</span> to sit in <span>front</span> of <span>TV</span>, doing <span>nothing</span>, just <span>gazing</span> at the <span>tube</span>, and it might be quite <span>destructive</span> for them <span>,makes</span> them less <span>active</span>, makes them in <span>fact</span> <span>passive</span>. And I can say taking their <span>health</span> issue into <span>consideration</span> makes them fat and <span>obese</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ We are going to move <span>onto</span> a different <span>subject</span> now. Do you use the <span>Internet</span> much during a day?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Well I can say yes. I use most of the time during my <span>office</span> on the net because due to <span>nature</span> of my job I have to <span>surf</span> the net, find out different <span>answers</span> to many <span>questions</span> and different <span>subjects</span>. So, most of the time I <span>spend</span> my day on the <span>net</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What <span>website</span> have you <span>recently</span> <span>visited</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Basically</span>! <span>surf</span> <span>Google</span> and <span>Yahoo</span>. Yes, I can tell you that the most <span>recent</span> one that I have <span>visited</span> was the <span>yahoo</span> <span>site</span> when in <span>fact</span> few hours back I had to <span>send</span> an <span>urgent</span> <span>e-mail</span> to my <span>colleagues</span> <span>overseas</span>, so I <span>switched</span> on the net and I got <span>connected</span>, I <span>composed</span> my own <span>mail</span> , and in <span>fact</span> through <span>mail</span> I <span>sent</span> my <span>message</span> to my friend.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What are some <span>advantages</span> of <span>interne</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I <span>suppose</span> there are too many to be <span>counted</span>. In <span>fact</span>, <span>intemet</span> has made the <span>interactions</span> <span>among</span> the people very <span>close</span> and it <span>brought</span> the people <span>close</span> together and it <span>covers</span> the <span>distances</span>. <span>As</span> you know probably, Now that the whole <span>World</span> is called the <span>global</span> <span>village</span> because all the <span>interactions</span> and <span>communications</span> are <span>among</span> the people and in <span>fact</span> with only a <span>single</span> <span>click</span> on the net, you can get <span>connected</span> to your friends on the other side of the <span>globe</span>, you can also <span>send</span> and <span>receive</span> <span>e-mails</span> and also you can have also <span>access</span> to lots of <span>information</span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Do people in your <span>country</span> use <span>intemet</span> a lot?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I can say more or less yes people use <span>intemet</span> a lot because the young <span>mostly</span> use <span>Internet</span> for <span>chatting</span>, for <span>surfing</span>, for <span>sending</span> and <span>receiving</span> <span>e-mails</span> <span>,and</span> of course the <span>organizations</span> and <span>offices</span> use <span>intemet</span> for <span>official</span> <span>correspondence</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Thank you, <span>Laleh</span>. Now I'm going to give you a <span>topic</span> <span>card</span> which I like you to talk about <span>2</span> <span>minutes</span>, please take <span>1</span> <span>minute</span> to <span>study</span> <span>topic</span> <span>card</span> and here is a <span>piece</span> of <span>paper</span> and a pen if you need to <span>write</span> anything down.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thanks

ðŸŽ§ Alright, thank you <span>Laleh</span>, now <span>E</span> <span>m</span> going to ask you some more <span>detailed</span> <span>questions</span> on the same <span>topic</span>. What do you think is the <span>importance</span> of the <span>museums</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Well in <span>fact</span>, I have never <span>given</span> it much thought, but I <span>suppose</span> the <span>importance</span> of <span>museums</span> are far too many probably to <span>educate</span> people of the <span>ancient</span> <span>civilizations</span> and also to <span>familiarize</span> them with different life <span>styles</span> that have our <span>ancestors</span>, their <span>traditions</span> and I <span>believe</span> in <span>general</span> <span>museum</span> takes us back in time to different <span>eras</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Thank you. What <span>types</span> of <span>museums</span> are <span>popular</span> in your <span>country</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I can say that different <span>types</span> of <span>museums</span> which are quite <span>popular</span> if you want to name a few, I have to say that <span>National</span> <span>Jewelry</span> <span>Museum</span>, <span>Museum</span> Of <span>Contemporary</span> Art, <span>Carpet</span> <span>Museum</span>, The <span>Museum</span> Of <span>Ancient</span> <span>Anthropology</span> and there are also different <span>museums</span> <span>exhibiting</span> different <span>items</span> inside the <span>kings</span> <span>palaces</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Why is it important in your <span>opinion</span> to visit <span>museums</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Well it is really important to visit <span>museums</span>, <span>especially</span> to <span>educate</span> our <span>kids</span> and children and also people at different <span>levels</span> because <span>museum</span> is <span>generally</span> <span>exhibiting</span> different <span>items</span> to help people to get to know their <span>ancient</span> <span>cultures</span> and <span>civilizations</span> and in <span>fact</span> as I told before it takes us back to different <span>times</span> and different <span>eras</span> and there are also so many old and <span>ancient</span> <span>items</span> on <span>display</span> which are in <span>fact</span> <span>pertained</span> to our <span>ancestors</span> that are really <span>unique</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Alright thank you very much <span>Laleh</span>, it is the end of your <span>speaking</span> <span>test</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Thank you very much. Have a nice day. <span><br/>

ðŸŽ§ Hello.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Hello.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Come in please and have a <span>seat</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Thank you.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ May I have your full name, please?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ My name is <span>Ladan</span> <span>Sariri</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Alright, <span>Ladan</span> <span>.Can</span> I look at your <span>passport</span>, please?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Yes, there you go.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Thanks, all right <span>Ladan</span>, where are you <span>from</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I'm from <span>Tehran</span> which is the <span>capital</span> of <span>Iran</span>, I was <span>born</span> and <span>raised</span> here and <span>lived</span> here all my life, it's a very big <span>city</span> but I enjoy living here.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What's the <span>weather</span> like in your home <span>town</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, in <span>Tehran</span> the <span>weather</span> is very <span>diverse</span>. We have <span>4</span> <span>seasons</span> <span>exactly;</span> it can be very hot in the <span>summer</span>, very hot and dry, and <span>extremely</span> <span>cold</span> in the <span>winter</span>. The <span>temperature</span> can go down to <span>minus</span> <span>17</span> and we used to have a lot of <span>snow</span> that <span>stopped</span> for a while , but in <span>recent</span> years it's been <span>snowing</span> more and <span>more</span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Ok, thanks <span>Ladan</span>, does the <span>weather</span> <span>affect</span> your <span>mood</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I think the <span>weather</span> probably <span>affects</span> <span>everybody's</span> <span>mood</span>. Some people feel more <span>energetic</span> and <span>cheerful</span> under <span>blue</span> sky with the sun <span>shining</span>, and <span>perhaps</span> the wet <span>weather</span> <span>dampens</span> their <span>mood</span> and makes some feel <span>depressed</span> but there are many people who <span>prefer</span> you call it <span>rainy</span> <span>weather</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What is your <span>favorite</span> <span>season</span> of the <span>year</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I <span>personally</span> really enjoy <span>autumn</span> because I think everything looks more <span>beautiful</span>. The <span>colors</span> are <span>warm</span>, the <span>trees</span> look <span>beautiful</span>, the <span>weather</span> is <span>mild</span>. It is <span>neither</span> too hot <span>nor</span> <span>cold</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Thanks. <span>Ladan</span>, what do you enjoy doing in hot <span>weather</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Well actually, the <span>heat</span> doesn't agree with me and I don't feel very <span>comfortable</span> in hot <span>weather</span>. But if! had to choose an <span>activity</span>, I <span>suppose</span> it would be something <span>relaxing</span>, may be a short <span>walk</span> somewhere, may be <span>sitting</span> in <span>cafÃ©</span> outside, and having a <span>cool</span> drink.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>O.K</span>. Now let's move to another <span>topic</span>, do you <span>watch</span> <span>TV</span> a lot?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, if! have time, yes, but I'm quite <span>busy</span> with my <span>studies</span> at <span>moment</span><br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Ok, what do you usually <span>watch</span> on <span>TV</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I enjoy <span>documentaries</span>. I <span>tend</span> to sit and <span>watch</span> the <span>documentaries</span> when they <span>happen</span> to be on because it's about life, it's about <span>reality</span> and you learn something from these <span>programs</span>, other than that I enjoy <span>comedy</span> and I usually try to keep up with the <span>news</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Alright, <span>Ladan</span>. What are the most <span>popular</span> <span>programs</span> in your <span>country</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I think in <span>Iran</span> I would have to say, at the top of the <span>list</span> would be <span>sports</span>, and then may be these <span>TV</span> <span>series</span> that <span>seem</span> to be very <span>popular</span> with <span>families</span>, they <span>tend</span> to be quite <span>late</span> at <span>night</span> around <span>10</span> <span>o'clock</span>, so that the whole <span>family</span> can sit and <span>watch</span> it.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Alright, <span>Ladan</span>, what are some <span>disadvantages</span> of <span>TV</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I think <span>TV</span> is a good thing all in all in <span>moderations</span>. I think maybe has <span>decreased</span> the amount of <span>interaction</span> <span>among</span> <span>families</span> have with each other because while they are at home, they sit in <span>front</span> of <span>television</span> and focus on one <span>program</span> <span>instead</span> of talking to each other, <span>exchanging</span> their <span>daily</span> <span>activities</span> and <span>experiences</span> and <span>children's</span> <span>television</span> should be <span>supervised</span> if not, they probably will <span>spend</span> too much time in <span>front</span> of it and this <span>stops</span> some from being <span>physically</span> and <span>mentally</span> <span>active</span> <span>elsewhere</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Ok, thanks <span>Ladan</span>. NOW, let's move <span>onto</span> a <span>topic</span>. I would like you to <span>describe</span> a pet that you or someone else you know used to have, you have one <span>minute</span> to think about the <span>topic</span> and then I want you to talk about <span>2</span> <span>minutes</span>, here is <span>paper</span> and <span>pencil</span> you can <span>write</span> your <span>notes</span> if you wish.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Thank you. <span><br/>

</div>
ðŸŽ§ Ok <span>Ladan</span>, I would like to ask you a few more <span>detailed</span> <span>questions</span> about the same <span>topic</span>. Why do you think some people keep <span>pets</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, the <span>reason</span> for some people is because they are very <span>fond</span> of <span>animals</span>. May be <span>they've</span> been <span>brought</span> up with <span>animals</span> in a house, so it's just a <span>part</span> of their <span>normal</span> life. I think for <span>others</span>, it is because of their <span>loneliness</span>, and the end of the day when you come home if it <span>depresses</span> you there is no one there, it's good to have a living <span>breathing</span> <span>animal</span> <span>waiting</span> for you.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ what <span>kinds</span> of <span>pets</span> are <span>popular</span> in your <span>country</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>I'</span> <span>m</span> <span>afraid</span> some <span>animals</span> in <span>general</span> are not <span>popular</span>. <span>Domesticated</span> <span>animals</span> like <span>pets</span> are not very <span>popular</span>. It is not in our <span>culture</span> to keep <span>animals</span> in the house. <span>However</span>, there are many people who own <span>dogs</span>. We have quite a few dog <span>lovers</span>, <span>cats</span> less and less, there are people who <span>feed</span> them <span>occasionally</span> outside of their home. I would say <span>perhaps</span> an <span>animal</span> with less <span>fuss</span> and less fur like <span>parrots</span> or <span>goldfish</span> is the <span>popular</span> <span>type</span> in my <span>country</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Why do you think some people <span>hate</span> <span>keeping</span> <span>pets</span>, while <span>others</span> like <span>it</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Again</span>, I think that <span>goes</span> back to what you are <span>brought</span> up with and personal feeling <span>towards</span> <span>pets</span> <span>.I</span> think one <span>reason</span> people might not like <span>keeping</span> <span>pets</span> is the <span>trouble</span> they have to go through in order to look after the pet <span>properly</span>. Of course once you take in a pet, you are <span>obliged</span> to look after it <span>properly</span>, <span>feed</span> it on the <span>regular</span> <span>basis</span>, make sure it has a <span>clean</span> dry place to <span>sleep</span> and also make sure it <span>gets</span> enough <span>activities</span> during the day.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Thanks <span>Ladan</span>, one more <span>question</span>. What are the <span>limitations</span> in your <span>country</span> for <span>keeping</span> <span>pets</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Well as I <span>mentioned</span> before because of our <span>culture</span> <span>,perhaps</span> our <span>religion</span>, people who keep <span>dogs</span> have a <span>pretty</span> <span>difficult</span> time because <span>dogs</span> need <span>exercise;</span> you can't keep them in the house all day long, you need to take them out for a <span>walk</span>. <span>Perhaps</span> people in the <span>streets</span> would not <span>welcome</span> this. In <span>fact</span> I think they are <span>extremely</span> <span>frowned</span> <span>upon</span>. I think another issue might be the <span>expense</span> of <span>keeping</span> a pet . Ever since a dog, well there is not dog food in a can, ready <span>available</span> in every <span>supermarket</span> so you would have to <span>spend</span> more money and time in <span>making</span> for your pet <span>dog</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Thank you very much <span>Ladan</span>. This is the end of your <span>interview</span>, have a nice time<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Thank you<br/>
