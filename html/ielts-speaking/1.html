ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>usually</span> do the <span>same</span> <span>things</span> <span>in</span> the <span>mornings?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>As</span> <span>I'm</span> a <span>creature</span> <span>of</span> <span>habit</span>, I <span>would</span> say <span>yes</span>. I <span>always</span> get <span>up</span> <span>at</span> <span>6:00</span> <span>am</span>, have <span>noodles</span> and tea for <span>breakfast</span>, <span>brush</span> my <span>teeth</span>, <span>then</span> <span>brush</span> <span>up</span> <span>(quickly</span> <span>study)</span> <span>on</span> what <span>we</span> <span>learned</span> the day <span>before</span> <span>in</span> <span>class</span> to <span>make</span> <span>sure</span> <span>I'm</span> <span>well-prepared</span>. <span>After</span> all <span>of</span> <span>this</span>, I <span>start</span> <span>heading</span> to <span>class</span> <span>at</span> <span>8:30 AM</span>. <span>However</span>, <span>on</span> <span>weekends</span>, I <span>tend</span> to hit the <span>snooze</span> <span>button</span> and end <span>up</span> <span>sleeping</span> <span>till</span> <span>9:00 AM</span> <span>then</span> <span>start</span> my <span>day</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>think</span> <span>breakfast</span> <span>is</span> <span>important?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Absolutely</span>. <span>Many</span> <span>experts</span> <span>say</span> <span>that</span> <span>it</span> <span>is</span> the <span>most</span> <span>important</span> <span>meal</span> <span>of</span> the day. I <span>believe</span> <span>it</span> <span>gives</span> me the <span>fuel</span> I <span>need</span> to <span>tackle</span> my day <span>(to</span> <span>trongly</span> <span>take</span> <span>on</span> the <span>day)</span>. <span>Moreover</span>, I <span>think</span> it's <span>critical</span> to have a <span>balanced</span> <span>breakfast</span> to <span>make</span> <span>sure</span> I get all the <span>proper</span> <span>nutrients</span>. I <span>cannot</span> <span>imagine</span> <span>starting</span> my day <span>on</span> an <span>empty</span> <span>stomach!<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Did you do the <span>same</span> <span>morning</span> <span>routines</span> <span>in</span> your <span>early</span> <span>ages?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Yes</span>, <span>pretty</span> <span>much</span>! <span>As</span> I've <span>always</span> <span>been</span> a <span>scholarly</span> <span>person</span>, I've <span>always</span> had the <span>motivation</span> to get <span>myself</span> <span>up</span> <span>earlier</span> <span>than</span> <span>expected</span> to have a <span>balanced</span> <span>breakfast</span> and <span>prepare</span> <span>myself</span> for the day <span>ahead</span> <span>of</span> me. <span>However</span>, I <span>used</span> to have <span>more</span> <span>of</span> a <span>sweet tooth</span> <span>as</span> a <span>child</span>, so I <span>used</span> to <span>munch</span> <span>on</span> <span>(eat)</span> <span>some</span> <span>sweet</span> <span>bread</span> <span>instead</span> <span>of</span> <span>noodles</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>want</span> to <span>change</span> your <span>daily</span> <span>routines</span> <span>in</span> the <span>future?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I <span>think</span> it's <span>inevitable</span> <span>since</span> <span>I'll</span> <span>soon</span> be <span>joining</span> the <span>workforce</span>! I <span>want</span> to <span>keep</span> my <span>organized</span>, <span>prepared</span> <span>habits</span>, but I <span>hope</span> to <span>sleep</span> <span>in</span> a bit <span>more</span> <span>in</span> the <span>future</span>. I <span>would</span> <span>like</span> to <span>at</span> <span>least</span> <span>sleep</span> <span>30</span> <span>minutes</span> to an <span>hour</span> <span>later</span>, and not have to <span>spend</span> <span>as</span> <span>much</span> <span>time</span> <span>preparing</span> for my day. <span>Furthermore</span>, I <span>hope</span> to have my <span>own</span> car <span>instead</span> <span>of</span> <span>taking</span> a <span>Grab</span> <span>every</span> <span>morning.<br/>

ðŸŽ§ What can you do to <span>improve</span> your <span>learning</span> <span>efficiency?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Hmm</span>, I <span>would</span> say <span>that</span> <span>meditation</span> and <span>physical</span> <span>exercise</span> can <span>certainly</span> be <span>of</span> <span>help</span>. I <span>believe</span> <span>that</span> <span>meditation</span> can <span>help</span> you to <span>become</span> <span>more</span> <span>aware</span> <span>of</span> <span>yourself</span> and <span>find</span> your <span>center</span> <span>of</span> <span>concentration</span>. <span>Furthermore</span>, <span>exercise</span> <span>releases</span> <span>tension</span> and <span>brings</span> you <span>back</span> to <span>focus</span>. When I <span>feel</span> <span>overwhelmed</span> <span>with</span> my <span>studies</span>, I <span>often</span> <span>take</span> a <span>break</span> to <span>go</span> <span>work</span> out <span>at</span> the gym <span>then</span> <span>afterwards</span> <span>feel</span> <span>more</span> <span>productive</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>prefer</span> to <span>study</span> <span>in</span> the <span>morning</span> <span>or</span> <span>in</span> the <span>evening?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Definitely</span> the <span>evening</span>. When I have an <span>exam</span> the <span>next</span> <span>morning</span>, I <span>feel</span> <span>that</span> the <span>information</span> <span>stays</span> <span>with</span> me <span>much</span> <span>more</span> <span>clearly</span> when I <span>cram</span> <span>(study</span> <span>at</span> the <span>last</span> <span>minute)</span> the <span>evening</span> <span>before</span>. When I try to <span>study</span> <span>in</span> the <span>morning</span>, I <span>often</span> <span>feel</span> <span>rushed</span> <span>or</span> <span>cannot</span> <span>stay</span> <span>focused</span>, <span>as</span> I <span>know</span> all my <span>daily</span> <span>tasks</span> are <span>awaiting</span> <span>me</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What <span>time</span> do you <span>like</span> to <span>study?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Around</span> <span>dinnertime</span> <span>after</span> I've <span>finished</span> all my <span>tasks</span> for the <span>day;</span> I <span>feel</span> <span>most</span> <span>at</span> <span>ease</span> <span>at</span> <span>this</span> <span>time</span>. When I <span>study</span> <span>right</span> <span>before</span> bed, I <span>tend</span> to <span>even</span> <span>dream</span> <span>of</span> <span>that</span> <span>information</span>, <span>helping</span> me to <span>remember</span> <span>clearly</span> for <span>that</span> <span>exam</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Why do <span>people</span> <span>find</span> <span>it</span> <span>difficult</span> to <span>focus</span> <span>on</span> <span>studying?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span>, for one, <span>studying</span> isn't <span>something</span> <span>enjoyable</span> for <span>many</span> <span>people</span>, so it's <span>hard</span> to <span>concentrate</span> <span>on</span> <span>something</span> you <span>dislike</span>. <span>Moreover</span>, it's <span>difficult</span> <span>with</span> all <span>of</span> the <span>distractions</span> <span>of</span> <span>today-</span> <span>such</span> <span>as</span> <span>texting</span>, <span>instagram</span>, <span>facebook</span>, <span>etc</span>. <span>Lastly</span>, <span>some</span> <span>people</span> <span>become</span> <span>preoccupied</span> <span>with</span> <span>other</span> <span>tasks</span> <span>they</span> <span>need</span> to do, <span>such</span> <span>as</span> <span>cleaning</span> <span>or</span> <span>cooking</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>like</span> to <span>study</span> <span>alone</span> <span>or</span> <span>with</span> your <span>friends?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Both</span> can be <span>nice</span>. But, I <span>tend</span> to be <span>more</span> <span>efficient</span> when I <span>study</span> <span>alone</span>. <span>Sometimes</span> when I <span>study</span> <span>with</span> <span>friends</span>, <span>we</span> get off <span>topic</span> and don't get <span>much</span> <span>done</span>. <span>However</span>, <span>it</span> <span>is</span> <span>effective</span> to <span>quiz</span> <span>each</span> <span>other</span>. So all <span>in</span> all, there are <span>benefits</span> to <span>both.<br/></span>

ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>like</span> <span>plants?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Frankly</span> <span>speaking</span>, <span>I'm</span> <span>quite</span> <span>drawn</span> by <span>plants</span> and <span>vegetation</span> <span>in</span> <span>general</span>. I <span>often</span> <span>find</span> <span>myself</span> <span>wandering</span> <span>about</span> <span>in</span> the <span>parks</span> <span>gazing</span> <span>aimlessly</span> <span>at</span> the <span>flowerbeds</span> and <span>enjoy</span> the <span>aroma</span> <span>that</span> <span>some</span> <span>beautiful</span> <span>flowers</span> <span>give</span> <span>off</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>think</span> <span>plants</span> can be a <span>good</span> <span>gift?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Definitely</span>, <span>plants</span> <span>usually</span> <span>feature</span> <span>in</span> <span>many</span> <span>occasions</span> <span>from</span> <span>casual</span> <span>birthdays</span> to <span>more</span> <span>formal</span> <span>dinners</span>. It's <span>common</span> to <span>bring</span> a <span>bunch</span> <span>of</span> <span>newly</span> <span>picked</span> <span>flowers</span> <span>or</span> a <span>bouquet</span> <span>of</span> <span>flowers</span> to the <span>host</span> <span>family</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Can you <span>grow</span> <span>plants</span>? Do you <span>know</span> <span>anything</span> <span>about</span> <span>growing</span> a <span>plant?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I don't have a <span>knack</span> for <span>gardening</span>, so it's <span>quite</span> <span>over</span> my <span>head</span> when <span>it</span> <span>comes</span> to <span>growing</span> <span>certain</span> <span>types</span> <span>of</span> <span>plants</span>. My <span>mother</span> <span>often</span> <span>takes</span> <span>care</span> <span>of</span> <span>this</span> <span>instead</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>keep</span> <span>plants</span> <span>at</span> <span>home?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Yes</span>, I do. I <span>mean</span> I <span>keep</span> <span>lily</span> <span>in</span> my <span>bedroom</span> and I <span>also</span> <span>plant</span> <span>some</span> <span>vegetables</span> <span>like</span> <span>cucumber</span>, <span>onions</span> and <span>tomatoes</span> <span>in</span> the <span>balcony</span>. Now you can see <span>everything</span> <span>covered</span> <span>in</span> <span>green.<br/>

ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>like</span> <span>watch</span> <span>films?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Absolutely</span>! <span>They</span> are an <span>excellent</span> way to <span>unwind</span> <span>(relax;</span> <span>free</span> your <span>mind)</span>. <span>Moreover</span>, my <span>friends</span> are <span>reallt</span> <span>into</span> <span>films</span>, so it's a fun, <span>relaxing</span> way to <span>spend</span> <span>time</span> <span>together</span>. <span>Afterwards</span>, <span>we</span> <span>discuss</span> and <span>debate</span> the <span>film</span> <span>that</span> <span>we</span> have <span>just</span> <span>watched</span>. <span>Apart</span> <span>from</span> <span>just</span> <span>relaxing</span> and <span>enjoying</span> the <span>film</span>, I <span>like</span> to <span>delve</span> <span>deeper</span> <span>(get</span> to the <span>deeper</span> <span>meaning)</span> to <span>discover</span> the <span>subliminal</span> <span>messages</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What <span>kinds</span> <span>of</span> <span>movies</span> do you <span>like</span> <span>best?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span>, I <span>would</span> say <span>I'm</span> <span>still</span> a kid <span>at</span> <span>heart</span> <span>(a</span> <span>person</span> who <span>still</span> <span>feels</span> <span>like</span> a <span>child</span> <span>in</span> <span>their</span> <span>heart)</span>, so I <span>really</span> <span>enjoy</span> <span>watching</span> <span>kids'</span> <span>movies</span>. <span>Although</span> <span>they</span> <span>seem</span> <span>simple</span> and <span>innocent</span>, there are <span>often</span> <span>many</span> <span>life</span> <span>lessons</span> <span>packed</span> <span>into</span> <span>these</span> <span>films</span>. <span>Moreover</span>, <span>I'm</span> <span>really</span> <span>into</span> <span>drama</span> and <span>historical</span> <span>movies</span>. When I <span>watch</span> <span>these</span>, I <span>feel</span> <span>that</span> I can <span>more</span> <span>deeply</span> <span>understand</span> <span>human</span> <span>emotions</span> and <span>re-live</span> <span>historical</span> <span>moments</span>, <span>like</span> the <span>Vietnam-America</span> War <span>or</span> <span>World</span> War <span>II</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>prefer</span> <span>foreign</span> <span>films</span> <span>or</span> <span>films</span> <span>made</span> <span>in</span> your <span>country?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Since</span> my <span>country</span> doesn't have a <span>huge</span> <span>film</span> <span>industry</span>, I've <span>always</span> <span>been</span> <span>really</span> <span>into</span> <span>American</span> <span>films</span>. Not to <span>knock</span> <span>(to</span> <span>insult;</span> <span>discredit)</span> <span>other</span> <span>film</span> <span>industries</span>, but <span>American</span> <span>ones</span> are <span>incredibly</span> <span>entertaining</span> and <span>well-made;</span> the <span>evolution</span> <span>of</span> <span>film</span> <span>continues</span> to <span>amaze</span> me. <span>Moreover</span>, I <span>only</span> <span>watch</span> <span>films</span> <span>in</span> <span>English</span> so <span>it</span> <span>helps</span> me to <span>learn</span> new <span>slang</span> and <span>expressions</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ How <span>often</span> do you <span>watch</span> <span>films?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span>, I <span>am</span> <span>quite</span> a <span>busy</span> bee <span>(a</span> <span>busy</span> <span>person)</span>, but I <span>manage</span> to see <span>about</span> one <span>or</span> two <span>films</span> a <span>week</span> <span>at</span> <span>home</span>. <span>After</span> a <span>long</span> day <span>of</span> <span>studying</span>, I <span>love</span> <span>snuggling</span> <span>up</span> <span>(getting</span> <span>comfortable</span> <span>with</span> <span>blankets)</span> <span>on</span> the <span>sofa</span> and <span>watching</span> a <span>film</span> to <span>unwind</span>. I <span>tend</span> to do <span>this</span> <span>on</span> <span>Friday</span> and <span>Sunday</span> <span>evenings</span> <span>with</span> my <span>friends</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ How <span>often</span> do you <span>go</span> to a <span>cinema</span> to <span>watch</span> a <span>movie?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Not too <span>often</span> <span>actually</span>. <span>As</span> the <span>prices</span> <span>in</span> my <span>country</span> are <span>quite</span> <span>high</span>, I <span>usually</span> <span>opt</span> to <span>(choose)</span> <span>watch</span> a <span>movie</span> <span>at</span> <span>home</span> <span>instead</span> to <span>save</span> <span>on</span> <span>costs</span>. <span>Actually</span>, I <span>think</span> it's <span>kind</span> <span>of</span> a <span>waste</span> <span>of</span> <span>money</span> to see a <span>movie</span> <span>at</span> a <span>cinema</span> when you can <span>watch</span> <span>it</span> <span>from</span> the <span>comfort</span> <span>of</span> your <span>living</span> <span>room</span>. I <span>only</span> <span>go</span> when a <span>friend</span> <span>invites</span> me, which <span>is</span> <span>maybe</span> <span>4</span> <span>times</span> a <span>year</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do <span>people</span> <span>in</span> your <span>country</span> <span>like</span> to <span>go</span> to a <span>cinema</span> to <span>watch</span> a <span>film?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I <span>would</span> say so. <span>Since</span> <span>people</span> <span>like</span> to <span>go</span> out <span>with</span> <span>their</span> <span>families</span> <span>on</span> the <span>weekends</span>, <span>this</span> <span>is</span> <span>often</span> an <span>activity</span> <span>that</span> <span>they</span> <span>would</span> <span>choose</span>. <span>Moreover</span>, <span>teenagers</span> <span>enjoy</span> <span>this</span> <span>activity</span> <span>as</span> a way to get out <span>of</span> the <span>house</span>. <span>Furthermore</span>, it's <span>often</span> a <span>popular</span> <span>date</span> <span>option</span> for <span>many</span> <span>people!<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ What was the <span>first</span> <span>film</span> <span>that</span> you <span>watched?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Hmm</span> it's <span>hard</span> to say the <span>first</span>, but I <span>think</span> <span>it</span> was the <span>Lion</span> <span>King</span>. I <span>know</span> <span>it</span> <span>first</span> <span>came</span> out <span>in</span> the <span>early</span> <span>90's</span> when I was a <span>child</span>. <span>It</span> was my <span>absolute</span> <span>favorite-</span> I <span>used</span> to <span>watch</span> <span>it</span> <span>repeatedly</span> <span>until</span> my <span>parents</span> <span>were</span> <span>really</span> <span>tired</span> <span>of</span> <span>it</span>! I <span>even</span> <span>built</span> <span>"pride</span> <span>rock"</span> out <span>of</span> <span>rocks</span> <span>that</span> I <span>found</span> when <span>we</span> <span>would</span> <span>go</span> to <span>visit</span> my <span>relatives</span> who have a <span>garden</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>like</span> to <span>watch</span> <span>movies</span> <span>alone</span> <span>or</span> <span>with</span> your <span>friends?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Both</span>! <span>On</span> one <span>hand</span>, I <span>find</span> <span>it</span> <span>extremely</span> <span>relaxing</span> to <span>chill</span> out and <span>fall</span> <span>asleep</span> to a <span>film</span> by <span>myself</span>, but it's <span>also</span> <span>enjoyable</span> to have <span>company</span>. So, all <span>in</span> all, I <span>prefer</span> <span>films</span> <span>with</span> <span>friends</span>, <span>since</span> <span>they</span> are <span>also</span> <span>into</span> <span>film</span>. <span>Afterwards</span>, <span>we</span> can <span>discuss</span> the <span>meaning</span> and <span>carry</span> <span>on</span> <span>inside</span> <span>jokes</span> <span>(jokes</span> <span>among</span> <span>friends)</span> <span>from</span> <span>quotes</span> <span>from</span> the <span>film</span> <span>later</span> <span>on!<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Would</span> you <span>like</span> to be <span>in</span> a <span>movie?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Not one bit! <span>As</span> I have <span>stage</span> <span>fright</span> <span>(fear</span> <span>of</span> <span>being</span> <span>on</span> <span>stage)</span>, I <span>would</span> <span>never</span> have the <span>guts</span> <span>(never</span> be <span>brave</span> <span>enough</span> <span>to)</span> to do <span>it</span>. <span>Secondly</span>, I <span>feel</span> <span>awkward</span> when I try to act and I have the <span>memory</span> <span>of</span> a <span>goldfish</span> <span>(short</span> <span>memory)</span> so I <span>know</span> I <span>could</span> <span>never</span> <span>memorize</span> my <span>lines</span>! All <span>in</span> all, <span>acting</span> <span>is</span> <span>simply</span> not my <span>thing.<br/></span>

ðŸŽ§ Do you have any <span>hobbies?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Of</span> <span>course</span>! My <span>number</span> one <span>hobby</span> <span>is</span> <span>playing</span> <span>golf</span>. <span>Actually</span>, my <span>entire</span> <span>family</span>, <span>grandparents</span> <span>included</span>, are <span>really</span> <span>into</span> <span>golf</span>. <span>Ever</span> <span>since</span> I was a <span>child</span>, my <span>father</span> <span>used</span> to <span>take</span> me to the <span>driving</span> <span>range</span> <span>(the</span> <span>place</span> to <span>practice</span> <span>hitting</span> <span>golf</span> <span>balls)</span> <span>with</span> him to <span>practice</span>. <span>This</span> <span>planted</span> the <span>seed</span> <span>of</span> <span>interest</span> for me. Now <span>we</span> all <span>play</span> <span>together</span> <span>as</span> a <span>family</span>, and <span>actually</span> I <span>beat</span> <span>them</span> all <span>most</span> <span>of</span> the <span>time!<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ What do you do when you have <span>free</span> <span>time?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ My <span>favorite</span> <span>things</span> to do are <span>play</span> <span>golf</span> and see my <span>friends</span> and <span>family</span>. My top <span>priority</span> <span>is</span> <span>spending</span> <span>time</span> <span>with</span> <span>those</span> I <span>love-</span> and <span>luckily</span> <span>most</span> <span>of</span> <span>us</span> <span>share</span> the <span>common</span> <span>interest</span> <span>of</span> <span>golf</span>. For <span>those</span> who don't <span>like</span> <span>golf</span>, I <span>enjoy</span> <span>spending</span> <span>time</span> <span>eating</span> <span>or</span> <span>at</span> a <span>coffeeshop</span> <span>together</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What <span>free</span> <span>time</span> <span>activities</span> are <span>popular</span> <span>with</span> <span>people</span> <span>in</span> your <span>country?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>As</span> <span>most</span> <span>countries</span> <span>in</span> the <span>world</span>, <span>soccer</span> <span>is</span> <span>quite</span> <span>popular</span>. <span>Furthermore</span>, <span>people</span> <span>tend</span> to <span>enjoy</span> <span>playing</span> <span>cricket</span> and <span>drinking</span> tea <span>with</span> one <span>another</span>. <span>Nowadays</span>, <span>backpacking</span> <span>across</span> <span>Southeast</span> <span>Asia</span> <span>is</span> <span>becoming</span> <span>quite</span> <span>popular</span> <span>too!<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ What do you <span>usually</span> do <span>after</span> <span>work</span> <span>or</span> <span>classes?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Since</span> I have an <span>exhausting</span> day <span>in</span> the <span>office</span>, I don't <span>like</span> to <span>stay</span> <span>sedentary</span> all day. I <span>usually</span> hit the gym and <span>go</span> to the <span>driving</span> <span>range</span> <span>after</span> <span>work</span> <span>almost</span> <span>every</span> <span>single</span> day. <span>If</span> I <span>go</span> <span>straight</span> <span>home</span>, I <span>become</span> <span>glued</span> to <span>(attached</span> <span>to)</span> the <span>couch</span> <span>(another</span> <span>word</span> for <span>sofa)</span> and don't do <span>anything</span> <span>worthwhile</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>prefer</span> <span>staying</span> <span>at</span> <span>home</span> <span>or</span> <span>going</span> out <span>during</span> <span>evenings?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>As</span> <span>I'm</span> an <span>extroverted</span>, <span>active</span> <span>person</span>, <span>I'd</span> <span>definitely</span> <span>rather</span> hit the <span>town</span> <span>(go</span> <span>out)</span>. I <span>really</span> <span>enjoy</span> <span>going</span> out <span>with</span> my <span>college</span> and <span>golf</span> <span>mates</span> <span>fore</span> <span>some</span> <span>beers</span> <span>every</span> <span>weekend</span>. <span>Moreover</span>, I <span>always</span> <span>dedicate</span> <span>Sunday</span> to my <span>family</span>. <span>We</span> <span>usually</span> have a <span>lunch</span> and tea <span>time</span> <span>at</span> my <span>grandmother's</span> <span>house</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What <span>free-time</span> <span>activities</span> <span>would</span> you <span>like</span> to try <span>in</span> the <span>future?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Lately</span> I've had a <span>growing</span> <span>interest</span> <span>in</span> <span>yoga</span> and <span>meditation</span>. <span>Some</span> <span>of</span> my <span>friends</span> and <span>family</span> have <span>recently</span> <span>gotten</span> <span>involved</span> <span>in</span> <span>it</span>, and I see <span>that</span> <span>it</span> <span>helps</span> <span>them</span> <span>maintain</span> <span>their</span> <span>calm</span> <span>regardless</span> <span>of</span> the <span>chaos</span> <span>around</span> <span>them</span>. <span>Furthermore</span>, <span>it</span> <span>improves</span> <span>balance</span>, <span>coordination</span>, and <span>body</span> <span>toning</span>. I <span>think</span> <span>it</span> <span>could</span> <span>benefit</span> me, <span>as</span> I have a <span>stressful</span> <span>office</span> <span>job</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>like</span> to <span>spend</span> your <span>free</span> <span>time</span> <span>with</span> <span>families</span> <span>or</span> <span>friends?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ It's <span>equal</span>! I <span>need</span> <span>both</span>. <span>However</span>, <span>family</span> <span>will</span> <span>always</span> be my <span>number</span> one <span>priority</span>. <span>Unlike</span> <span>some</span> <span>people</span>, I <span>always</span> let <span>loose</span> and have fun <span>with</span> my <span>family</span>. <span>On</span> the <span>other</span> <span>hand</span>, I <span>really</span> <span>enjoy</span> <span>spending</span> <span>time</span> <span>with</span> my <span>friends</span> and <span>discussing</span> <span>topics</span> <span>that</span> <span>would</span> be <span>inappropriate</span> <span>in</span> <span>front</span> <span>of</span> <span>family</span> <span>members.<br/></span>
