ðŸŽ§ Do you usually do the same things in the <span>mornings</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>As</span> I'm a <span>creature</span> of <span>habit</span>, I would say yes. I always get up at <span>6:00</span> am, have <span>noodles</span> and tea for <span>breakfast</span>, <span>brush</span> my <span>teeth</span>, then <span>brush</span> up <span>(quickly</span> <span>study)</span> on what we <span>learned</span> the day before in class to make sure I'm <span>well-prepared</span>. After all of this, I start <span>heading</span> to class at <span>8:30 AM</span>. <span>However</span>, on <span>weekends</span>, I <span>tend</span> to hit the <span>snooze</span> <span>button</span> and end up <span>sleeping</span> <span>till</span> <span>9:00 AM</span> then start my day.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you think <span>breakfast</span> is important?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Absolutely. many <span>experts</span> say that it is the most important <span>meal</span> of the day. I <span>believe</span> it <span>gives</span> me the <span>fuel</span> I need to <span>tackle</span> my day <span>(to</span> <span>trongly</span> take on the <span>day)</span>. <span>Moreover</span>, I think it's <span>critical</span> to have a <span>balanced</span> <span>breakfast</span> to make sure I get all the <span>proper</span> <span>nutrients</span>. I <span>cannot</span> <span>imagine</span> <span>starting</span> my day on an empty <span>stomach</span>!<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Did you do the same morning <span>routines</span> in your <span>early</span> <span>ages</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Yes, <span>pretty</span> much! <span>As</span> I've always been a <span>scholarly</span> person, I've always had the <span>motivation</span> to get myself up <span>earlier</span> than <span>expected</span> to have a <span>balanced</span> <span>breakfast</span> and <span>prepare</span> myself for the day <span>ahead</span> of me. <span>However</span>, I used to have more of a <span>sweet tooth</span> as a <span>child</span>, so I used to <span>munch</span> on <span>(eat)</span> some <span>sweet</span> <span>bread</span> <span>instead</span> of <span>noodles</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you want to change your <span>daily</span> <span>routines</span> in the <span>future</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I think it's <span>inevitable</span> since I'll soon be <span>joining</span> the <span>workforce</span>! I want to keep my <span>organized</span>, <span>prepared</span> <span>habits</span>, but I hope to <span>sleep</span> in a bit more in the future. I would like to at <span>least</span> <span>sleep</span> <span>30</span> <span>minutes</span> to an <span>hour</span> later, and not have to <span>spend</span> as much time <span>preparing</span> for my day. <span>Furthermore</span>, I hope to have my own car <span>instead</span> of taking a <span>Grab</span> every <span>morning

ðŸŽ§ What can you do to <span>improve</span> your <span>learning</span> <span>efficiency</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Hmm</span>, I would say that <span>meditation</span> and <span>physical</span> <span>exercise</span> can <span>certainly</span> be of help. I <span>believe</span> that <span>meditation</span> can help you to become more <span>aware</span> of yourself and find your <span>center</span> of <span>concentration</span>. <span>Furthermore</span>, <span>exercise</span> <span>releases</span> <span>tension</span> and <span>brings</span> you back to focus. When I feel <span>overwhelmed</span> with my <span>studies</span>, I often take a <span>break</span> to go work out at the gym then <span>afterwards</span> feel more <span>productive</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>prefer</span> to <span>study</span> in the morning or in the <span>evening</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Definitely</span> the <span>evening</span>. When I have an <span>exam</span> the next morning, I feel that the <span>information</span> <span>stays</span> with me much more <span>clearly</span> when I <span>cram</span> <span>(study</span> at the last <span>minute)</span> the <span>evening</span> before. When I try to <span>study</span> in the morning, I often feel <span>rushed</span> or <span>cannot</span> <span>stay</span> <span>focused</span>, as I know all my <span>daily</span> <span>tasks</span> are <span>awaiting</span> me.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What time do you like to <span>study</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Around</span> <span>dinnertime</span> after I've <span>finished</span> all my <span>tasks</span> for the <span>day;</span> I feel most at <span>ease</span> at this time. When I <span>study</span> right before bed, I <span>tend</span> to even <span>dream</span> of that <span>information</span>, <span>helping</span> me to remember <span>clearly</span> for that <span>exam</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Why do people find it <span>difficult</span> to focus on <span>studying</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, for one, <span>studying</span> isn't something <span>enjoyable</span> for many people, so it's <span>hard</span> to <span>concentrate</span> on something you <span>dislike</span>. <span>Moreover</span>, it's <span>difficult</span> with all of the <span>distractions</span> of <span>today-</span> such as <span>texting</span>, <span>instagram</span>, <span>facebook</span>, <span>etc</span>. <span>Lastly</span>, some people become <span>preoccupied</span> with other <span>tasks</span> they need to do, such as <span>cleaning</span> or cooking.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you like to <span>study</span> <span>alone</span> or with your <span>friends</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Both can be nice. But, I <span>tend</span> to be more <span>efficient</span> when I <span>study</span> <span>alone</span>. Sometimes when I <span>study</span> with friends, we get off <span>topic</span> and don't get much done. <span>However</span>, it is <span>effective</span> to <span>quiz</span> each other. So all in all, there are <span>benefits</span> to <span>both</span>.<br/>

ðŸŽ§ Do you like <span>plants</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Frankly</span> <span>speaking</span>, I'm quite <span>drawn</span> by <span>plants</span> and <span>vegetation</span> in <span>general</span>. I often find myself <span>wandering</span> about in the <span>parks</span> <span>gazing</span> <span>aimlessly</span> at the <span>flowerbeds</span> and enjoy the <span>aroma</span> that some <span>beautiful</span> <span>flowers</span> give off.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you think <span>plants</span> can be a good <span>gift</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Definitely</span>, <span>plants</span> usually <span>feature</span> in many <span>occasions</span> from <span>casual</span> <span>birthdays</span> to more <span>formal</span> <span>dinners</span>. It's <span>common</span> to <span>bring</span> a <span>bunch</span> of <span>newly</span> <span>picked</span> <span>flowers</span> or a <span>bouquet</span> of <span>flowers</span> to the <span>host</span> <span>family</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Can you <span>grow</span> <span>plants</span>? Do you know anything about <span>growing</span> a <span>plant</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I don't have a <span>knack</span> for <span>gardening</span>, so it's quite over my <span>head</span> when it comes to <span>growing</span> <span>certain</span> <span>types</span> of <span>plants</span>. My <span>mother</span> often takes <span>care</span> of this <span>instead</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you keep <span>plants</span> at home?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Yes, I do. I mean I keep <span>lily</span> in my <span>bedroom</span> and I also <span>plant</span> some <span>vegetables</span> like <span>cucumber</span>, <span>onions</span> and <span>tomatoes</span> in the <span>balcony</span>. Now you can see everything <span>covered</span> in <span>green

</div>
ðŸŽ§ Do you like <span>watch</span> <span>films</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Absolutely! They are an <span>excellent</span> way to <span>unwind</span> <span>(relax;</span> free your <span>mind)</span>. <span>Moreover</span>, my friends are <span>reallt</span> into <span>films</span>, so it's a fun, <span>relaxing</span> way to <span>spend</span> time together. <span>Afterwards</span>, we <span>discuss</span> and <span>debate</span> the <span>film</span> that we have just <span>watched</span>. <span>Apart</span> from just <span>relaxing</span> and <span>enjoying</span> the <span>film</span>, I like to <span>delve</span> <span>deeper</span> <span>(get</span> to the <span>deeper</span> <span>meaning)</span> to <span>discover</span> the <span>subliminal</span> <span>messages</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What <span>kinds</span> of <span>movies</span> do you like <span>best</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, I would say I'm still a kid at <span>heart</span> <span>(a</span> person who still <span>feels</span> like a <span>child</span> in their <span>heart)</span>, so I really enjoy watching <span>kids'</span> <span>movies</span>. Although they <span>seem</span> simple and <span>innocent</span>, there are often many life <span>lessons</span> <span>packed</span> into these <span>films</span>. <span>Moreover</span>, I'm really into <span>drama</span> and <span>historical</span> <span>movies</span>. When I <span>watch</span> these, I feel that I can more <span>deeply</span> <span>understand</span> <span>human</span> <span>emotions</span> and <span>re-live</span> <span>historical</span> <span>moments</span>, like the <span>Vietnam-America</span> War or <span>World</span> War <span>II</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>prefer</span> <span>foreign</span> <span>films</span> or <span>films</span> made in your <span>country</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Since my <span>country</span> doesn't have a <span>huge</span> <span>film</span> <span>industry</span>, I've always been really into <span>American</span> <span>films</span>. Not to <span>knock</span> <span>(to</span> <span>insult;</span> <span>discredit)</span> other <span>film</span> <span>industries</span>, but <span>American</span> <span>ones</span> are <span>incredibly</span> <span>entertaining</span> and <span>well-made;</span> the <span>evolution</span> of <span>film</span> <span>continues</span> to <span>amaze</span> me. <span>Moreover</span>, I only <span>watch</span> <span>films</span> in English so it helps me to learn new <span>slang</span> and <span>expressions</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ How often do you <span>watch</span> <span>films</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, I am quite a <span>busy</span> bee <span>(a</span> <span>busy</span> <span>person)</span>, but I <span>manage</span> to see about one or two <span>films</span> a week at home. After a long day of <span>studying</span>, I love <span>snuggling</span> up <span>(getting</span> <span>comfortable</span> with <span>blankets)</span> on the <span>sofa</span> and watching a <span>film</span> to <span>unwind</span>. I <span>tend</span> to do this on <span>Friday</span> and <span>Sunday</span> <span>evenings</span> with my friends.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ How often do you go to a <span>cinema</span> to <span>watch</span> a movie?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Not too often actually. <span>As</span> the <span>prices</span> in my <span>country</span> are quite high, I usually <span>opt</span> to <span>(choose)</span> <span>watch</span> a movie at home <span>instead</span> to <span>save</span> on <span>costs</span>. Actually, I think it's kind of a <span>waste</span> of money to see a movie at a <span>cinema</span> when you can <span>watch</span> it from the <span>comfort</span> of your living room. I only go when a friend <span>invites</span> me, which is maybe <span>4</span> <span>times</span> a year.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do people in your <span>country</span> like to go to a <span>cinema</span> to <span>watch</span> a <span>film</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I would say so. Since people like to go out with their <span>families</span> on the <span>weekends</span>, this is often an <span>activity</span> that they would choose. <span>Moreover</span>, <span>teenagers</span> enjoy this <span>activity</span> as a way to get out of the house. <span>Furthermore</span>, it's often a <span>popular</span> date option for many <span>people</span>!<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ What was the first <span>film</span> that you <span>watched</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Hmm</span> it's <span>hard</span> to say the first, but I think it was the <span>Lion</span> <span>King</span>. I know it first came out in the <span>early</span> <span>90's</span> when I was a <span>child</span>. It was my <span>absolute</span> <span>favorite-</span> I used to <span>watch</span> it <span>repeatedly</span> until my <span>parents</span> were really <span>tired</span> of it! I even <span>built</span> <span>"pride</span> <span>rock"</span> out of <span>rocks</span> that I <span>found</span> when we would go to visit my <span>relatives</span> who have a garden.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you like to <span>watch</span> <span>movies</span> <span>alone</span> or with your <span>friends</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Both! On one <span>hand</span>, I find it <span>extremely</span> <span>relaxing</span> to <span>chill</span> out and <span>fall</span> <span>asleep</span> to a <span>film</span> by myself, but it's also <span>enjoyable</span> to have company. So, all in all, I <span>prefer</span> <span>films</span> with friends, since they are also into <span>film</span>. <span>Afterwards</span>, we can <span>discuss</span> the <span>meaning</span> and <span>carry</span> on inside <span>jokes</span> <span>(jokes</span> <span>among</span> <span>friends)</span> from <span>quotes</span> from the <span>film</span> later <span>on</span>!<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Would</span> you like to be in a movie?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Not one bit! <span>As</span> I have <span>stage</span> <span>fright</span> <span>(fear</span> of being on <span>stage)</span>, I would never have the <span>guts</span> <span>(never</span> be <span>brave</span> enough <span>to)</span> to do it. <span>Secondly</span>, I feel <span>awkward</span> when I try to act and I have the <span>memory</span> of a <span>goldfish</span> <span>(short</span> <span>memory)</span> so I know I could never <span>memorize</span> my <span>lines</span>! All in all, <span>acting</span> is <span>simply</span> not my thing.<br/>

ðŸŽ§ Do you have any <span>hobbies</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Of course! My number one hobby is playing <span>golf</span>. Actually, my <span>entire</span> <span>family</span>, <span>grandparents</span> <span>included</span>, are really into <span>golf</span>. Ever since I was a <span>child</span>, my <span>father</span> used to take me to the driving <span>range</span> <span>(the</span> place to practice <span>hitting</span> <span>golf</span> <span>balls)</span> with him to practice. This <span>planted</span> the <span>seed</span> of <span>interest</span> for me. Now we all play together as a <span>family</span>, and actually I <span>beat</span> them all most of the time!<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ What do you do when you have free time?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ My <span>favorite</span> things to do are play <span>golf</span> and see my friends and <span>family</span>. My top <span>priority</span> is spending time with those I <span>love-</span> and <span>luckily</span> most of us share the <span>common</span> <span>interest</span> of <span>golf</span>. For those who don't like <span>golf</span>, I enjoy spending time <span>eating</span> or at a <span>coffeeshop</span> together.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What free time <span>activities</span> are <span>popular</span> with people in your <span>country</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>As</span> most <span>countries</span> in the <span>world</span>, <span>soccer</span> is quite <span>popular</span>. <span>Furthermore</span>, people <span>tend</span> to enjoy playing <span>cricket</span> and <span>drinking</span> tea with one another. <span>Nowadays</span>, <span>backpacking</span> across <span>Southeast</span> <span>Asia</span> is <span>becoming</span> quite <span>popular</span> too!<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ What do you usually do after work or <span>classes</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Since I have an <span>exhausting</span> day in the <span>office</span>, I don't like to <span>stay</span> <span>sedentary</span> all day. I usually hit the gym and go to the driving <span>range</span> after work almost every <span>single</span> day. If I go <span>straight</span> home, I become <span>glued</span> to <span>(attached</span> <span>to)</span> the <span>couch</span> <span>(another</span> <span>word</span> for <span>sofa)</span> and don't do anything <span>worthwhile</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>prefer</span> <span>staying</span> at home or going out during <span>evenings</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>As</span> I'm an <span>extroverted</span>, <span>active</span> person, I'd definitely rather hit the <span>town</span> <span>(go</span> <span>out)</span>. I really enjoy going out with my <span>college</span> and <span>golf</span> <span>mates</span> <span>fore</span> some <span>beers</span> every weekend. <span>Moreover</span>, I always <span>dedicate</span> <span>Sunday</span> to my <span>family</span>. We usually have a lunch and tea time at my <span>grandmother's</span> house.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What <span>free-time</span> <span>activities</span> would you like to try in the <span>future</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ lately I've had a <span>growing</span> <span>interest</span> in <span>yoga</span> and <span>meditation</span>. Some of my friends and <span>family</span> have <span>recently</span> <span>gotten</span> <span>involved</span> in it, and I see that it helps them <span>maintain</span> their <span>calm</span> <span>regardless</span> of the <span>chaos</span> around them. <span>Furthermore</span>, it <span>improves</span> <span>balance</span>, <span>coordination</span>, and <span>body</span> <span>toning</span>. I think it could <span>benefit</span> me, as I have a <span>stressful</span> <span>office</span> job.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you like to <span>spend</span> your free time with <span>families</span> or <span>friends</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ It's <span>equal</span>! I need both. <span>However</span>, <span>family</span> will always be my number one <span>priority</span>. <span>Unlike</span> some people, I always let <span>loose</span> and have fun with my <span>family</span>. On the other <span>hand</span>, I really enjoy spending time with my friends and <span>discussing</span> <span>topics</span> that would be <span>inappropriate</span> in <span>front</span> of <span>family</span> <span>members</span>.<br/>
