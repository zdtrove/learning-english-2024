1. Do you usually do the same things in the mornings?<br />
As I'm a creature of habit, I would say yes. I always get up at 6:00 am, have noodles and tea for breakfast, brush my teeth, then brush up (quickly study) on what we learned the day before in class to make sure I'm well-prepared. After all of this, I start heading to class at 8:30 AM. However, on weekends, I tend to hit the snooze button and end up sleeping till 9:00 AM then start my day.<br />

2. Do you think breakfast is important?<br />
Absolutely. Many experts say that it is the most important meal of the day. I believe it gives me the fuel I need to tackle my day (to trongly take on the day). Moreover, I think it's critical to have a balanced breakfast to make sure I get all the proper nutrients. I cannot imagine starting my day on an empty stomach!<br />

3. Did you do the same morning routines in your early ages?<br />
Yes, pretty much! As I've always been a scholarly person, I've always had the motivation to get myself up earlier than expected to have a balanced breakfast and prepare myself for the day ahead of me. However, I used to have more of a sweet tooth (a person who lives sweets) as a child, so I used to munch on (eat) some sweet bread instead of noodles.<br />

4. Do you want to change your daily routines in the future?<br />
I think it's inevitable since I'll soon be joining the workforce! I want to keep my organized, prepared habits, but I hope to sleep in a bit more in the future. I would like to at least sleep 30 minutes to an hour later, and not have to spend as much time preparing for my day. Furthermore, I hope to have my own car instead of taking a Grab every morning.<br />

1. What can you do to improve your learning efficiency?<br />
Hmm, I would say that meditation and physical exercise can certainly be of help. I believe that meditation can help you to become more aware of yourself and find your center of concentration. Furthermore, exercise releases tension and brings you back to focus. When I feel overwhelmed with my studies, I often take a break to go work out at the gym then afterwards feel more productive.<br />

2. Do you prefer to study in the morning or in the evening?<br />
Definitely the evening. When I have an exam the next morning, I feel that the information stays with me much more clearly when I cram (study at the last minute) the evening before. When I try to study in the morning, I often feel rushed or cannot stay focused, as I know all my daily tasks are awaiting me.<br />

3. What time do you like to study?<br />
Around dinnertime after I've finished all my tasks for the day; I feel most at ease at this time. When I study right before bed, I tend to even dream of that information, helping me to remember clearly for that exam.<br />

4. Why do people find it difficult to focus on studying?<br />
Well, for one, studying isn't something enjoyable for many people, so it's hard to concentrate on something you dislike. Moreover, it's difficult with all of the distractions of today- such as texting, instagram, facebook, etc. Lastly, some people become preoccupied with other tasks they need to do, such as cleaning or cooking.<br />

5. Do you like to study alone or with your friends?<br />
Both can be nice. But, I tend to be more efficient when I study alone. Sometimes when I study with friends, we get off topic and don't get much done. However, it is effective to quiz each other. So all in all, there are benefits to both.<br />

1. Do you like plants?<br />
Frankly speaking, I'm quite drawn by plants and vegetation in general. I often find myself wandering about in the parks gazing aimlessly at the flowerbeds and enjoy the aroma that some beautiful flowers give off.<br />

2. Do you think plants can be a good gift?<br />
Definitely, plants usually feature in many occasions from casual birthdays to more formal dinners. It's common to bring a bunch of newly picked flowers or a bouquet of flowers to the host family.<br />

3. Can you grow plants? Do you know anything about growing a plant?<br />
I don't have a knack for gardening, so it's quite over my head when it comes to growing certain types of plants. My mother often takes care of this instead.<br />

4. Do you keep plants at home?<br />
Yes, I do. I mean I keep lily in my bedroom and I also plant some vegetables like cucumber, onions and tomatoes in the balcony. Now you can see everything covered in green.<br />

1. What's the most popular means of transportation in your hometown?<br />
Without any doubt I would say motorbikes. Almost everyone travels by motorbike. The reason why motorbike is so popular I think is due to their reasonable price and convenience. They also extremely varied in terms of size, color and quality, thus a wide variety of choices is available for everyone.<br />

2. How often do you take buses?<br />
Almost every day. Since my house is so far away from my university, it's impossible for me to travel by motorbike. In addition, the air is heavily polluted by exhaust fumes and traffic jams always take place, especially during peak hours. Thus, I'd prefer to take the bus, to save time, save gasoline and causing less pollution.<br />

3. Can you compare the advantages of planes and trains?<br />
Planes and trains regularly depart and arrive on time. Plus, there are many convenient facilities catering particularly to certain groups of passengers. However, traveling by plane is clearly time-saving and enjoyable in terms of onboard services like meals or comfortable seats, while traveling by train offers you a chance to see the world outside, admire the views from their seats. It's totally a great experience for most train-travelers<br />

4. Is driving to work popular in your country?<br />
Although cars themselves and gasoline are expensive, a lot of people prefer driving, possibly because driving is more comfortable in such weather, with such polluted and noisy surroundings.<br />

5. Do you think people will drive more in the future?<br />
If you're talking about India, no, I don't think it's possible, even in the future. Cars and gasoline are becoming unaffordable for many people these days. Plus, the transport infrastructure in various regions in India is not appropriate for cars.<br />

6. Would you ride bikes to work in the future?<br />
Definitely not. Riding a bike means you're exposing yourself to the unpredictable weather and to air pollution. What is worse, I'm afraid the main streets or the highway are too dangerous for cyclists, as cars, motorbikes and buses will travel at a very high speed. Thus I'd rather ride a motorbike or take the bus instead.<br />

7. What will become the most popular means of transport in your country?<br />
I think buses will take the lead. You can travel the distance without much worries about ticket price or rainy weather outside. Also new buses now offer better services like comfortable seats for the elderly or good air conditioning systems.<br />

8. Do you prefer public transport or private transport?<br />
I think I'd prefer public transport. It's much more inexpensive and because it can contain a large number of people, it helps ease the intensity of traffic jams during peak hours and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions caused by vehicles. Private transportation is more costly in terms of fees, taxes and gasoline.<br />

1. Do you like watch films?<br />
Absolutely! They are an excellent way to unwind (relax; free your mind). Moreover, my friends are really into films, so it's a fun, relaxing way to spend time together. Afterwards, we discuss and debate the film that we have just watched. Apart from just relaxing and enjoying the film, I like to delve deeper (get to the deeper meaning) to discover the subliminal messages.<br />

2. What kinds of movies do you like best?<br />
Well, I would say I'm still a kid at heart (a person who still feels like a child in their heart), so I really enjoy watching kids' movies. Although they seem simple and innocent, there are often many life lessons packed into these films. Moreover, I'm really into drama and historical movies. When I watch these, I feel that I can more deeply understand human emotions and re-live historical moments, like the Vietnam-America War or World War II.<br />

3. Do you prefer foreign films or films made in your country?<br />
Since my country doesn't have a huge film industry, I've always been really into American films. Not to knock (to insult; discredit) other film industries, but American ones are incredibly entertaining and well-made; the evolution of film continues to amaze me. Moreover, I only watch films in English so it helps me to learn new slang and expressions.<br />

4. How often do you watch films?<br />
Well, I am quite a busy bee (a busy person), but I manage to see about one or two films a week at home. After a long day of studying, I love snuggling up (getting comfortable with blankets) on the sofa and watching a film to unwind. I tend to do this on Friday and Sunday evenings with my friends.<br />

5. How often do you go to a cinema to watch a movie?<br />
Not too often actually. As the prices in my country are quite high, I usually opt to (choose) watch a movie at home instead to save on costs. Actually, I think it's kind of a waste of money to see a movie at a cinema when you can watch it from the comfort of your living room. I only go when a friend invites me, which is maybe 4 times a year.<br />

6. Do people in your country like to go to a cinema to watch a film?<br />
I would say so. Since people like to go out with their families on the weekends, this is often an activity that they would choose. Moreover, teenagers enjoy this activity as a way to get out of the house. Furthermore, it's often a popular date option for many people!<br />

7. What was the first film that you watched?<br />
Hmm it's hard to say the first, but I think it was the Lion King. I know it first came out in the early 90's when I was a child. It was my absolute favorite- I used to watch it repeatedly until my parents were really tired of it! I even built "pride rock" out of rocks that I found when we would go to visit my relatives who have a garden.<br />

8. Do you like to watch movies alone or with your friends?<br />
Both! On one hand, I find it extremely relaxing to chill out and fall asleep to a film by myself, but it's also enjoyable to have company. So, all in all, I prefer films with friends, since they are also into film. Afterwards, we can discuss the meaning and carry on inside jokes (jokes among friends) from quotes from the film later on!<br />

9. Would you like to be in a movie?<br />
Not one bit! As I have stage fright (fear of being on stage), I would never have the guts (never be brave enough to) to do it. Secondly, I feel awkward when I try to act and I have the memory of a goldfish (short memory) so I know I could never memorize my lines! All in all, acting is simply not my thing.<br />

1. Do you have any hobbies?<br />
Of course! My number one hobby is playing golf. Actually, my entire family, grandparents included, are really into golf. Ever since I was a child, my father used to take me to the driving range (the place to practice hitting golf balls) with him to practice. This planted the seed of interest for me. Now we all play together as a family, and actually I beat them all most of the time!<br />

2. What do you do when you have free time?<br />
My favorite things to do are play golf and see my friends and family. My top priority is spending time with those I love- and luckily most of us share the common interest of golf. For those who don't like golf, I enjoy spending time eating or at a coffeeshop together.<br />

3. What free time activities are popular with people in your country?<br />
As most countries in the world, soccer is quite popular. Furthermore, people tend to enjoy playing cricket and drinking tea with one another. Nowadays, backpacking across Southeast Asia is becoming quite popular too!<br />

4. What do you usually do after work or classes?<br />
Since I have an exhausting day in the office, I don't like to stay sedentary all day. I usually hit the gym and go to the driving range after work almost every single day. If I go straight home, I become glued to (attached to) the couch (another word for sofa) and don't do anything worthwhile.<br />

5. Do you prefer staying at home or going out during evenings?<br />
As I'm an extroverted, active person, I'd definitely rather hit the town (go out). I really enjoy going out with my college and golf mates fore some beers every weekend. Moreover, I always dedicate Sunday to my family. We usually have a lunch and tea time at my grandmother's house.<br />

6. What free-time activities would you like to try in the future?<br />
Lately I've had a growing interest in yoga and meditation. Some of my friends and family have recently gotten involved in it, and I see that it helps them maintain their calm regardless of the chaos around them. Furthermore, it improves balance, coordination, and body toning. I think it could benefit me, as I have a stressful office job.<br />

7. Do you like to spend your free time with families or friends?<br />
It's equal! I need both. However, family will always be my number one priority. Unlike some people, I always let loose and have fun with my family. On the other hand, I really enjoy spending time with my friends and discussing topics that would be inappropriate in front of family members.<br />

1. Is money important to you?<br />
So-so. To be honest, money can help your life. As I know I'm a person who likes traveling abroad, I know I must have a high-paying job to be able to attain this lifestyle. When I have this freedom to have new experiences, I feel a lot happier. So, because of this I'd say money matters to me.<br />

2. How do you save money?<br />
I think it's always important to have a certain number in mind. I think of a goal amount to save each month and pretend as if I don't have it. This has been a huge success for me. With these savings, I've been able to take my dream vacations and buy nice gifts for my family.<br />

3. Did you save money when you were young?<br />
As I've always dreamt of traveling the world, I used to save money in a piggybank! Although these savings never amounted to anything substantial, maybe just some movie tickets or candy, I'm glad I did it as a way to teach myself to save. I'll never forget how sad I felt when we broke the piggy-bank!<br />

4. Why do people save money?<br />
Various reasons! I think the main reasons are to have a safety blanket in case emergencies or unexpected costs arise, such as a flat tire or a broken hot water heater, or to save for a vacation or something specific that they would like to buy. Moreover, many parents are focused on saving for their children's schooling and college later on.<br />

5. Have you ever given money to the children?<br />
Certainly! Although I don't have any children of my own yet, I like to slip a 20 dollar bill into birthday cards for my young nieces and nephews. Furthermore, when I've traveled, I often buy things from children selling on the streets.<br />

I'm sort of a sporty guy/girl and work out at the gym day in, day out to keep myself in the pink. Compared with others at my age, I must admit that I'm as fit as a fiddle.<br />

2. What kinds of exercises do you do?<br />
As a rule, I work out at the gym on a regular basis. I lift weights, run on the treadmill or do some push-ups and press-ups. These exercises are quite exhausting but it is really good to build muscle and burn fat.<br />

3. In the future, do you want to try some new ways of exercises?<br />
I'd prefer to take up jogging in the morning; it's quite a recommended way to work out in the morning. However, for the time being, because of my workload and laziness, waking up early is out of the question.<br />

But still, that's what I wanted to be, at least until common sense got the better of me.<br />

2. Have you changed your mind on your dream job?<br />

3. What do you plan to do in the future?<br />
I'm planning to pursue overseas study to hone my expertise in my chosen field first, then I will make a decision later. The future is hard to predict and I may end up doing stuff that I won't ever imagine of.<br />

1. Do you like a house or a flat/ an apartment?<br />
I believe most people would prefer to have their own house rather than to rent a place and so do I. Hence, if I have my way, a house with a small garden would be my choice since I don't enjoy the constant disturbance from next-door apartments and elevator rides everytime coming home.<br />

2. What kind of housing/accommodation do you live in?<br />
For the past 21 years I have lived in a house with my family. And I think if I can move out and start making a living on my own, I would try my best to have an independent place where I can plan and design a house layout to suit myself since sharing a room or a flat with strangers sounds so troublesome to me.<br />

3. What do you usually do in your house/flat/room?<br />
Well definitely I'll spend some me-time there. I study, I chill out by reading, drawing and dancing all by myself. Sometimes I also invite one or two friends to spend time with. We'll watch some movies together and tell each other endless stories.<br />

4. Who do you live with?<br />
I live with my family. There are 5 of us and we all have our own room, which is way more comfortable as the older we grow, the more privacy we need for ourselves. I think our house is big enough for us yet still a warm and cozy place that I call home.<br />

5. How long have you lived there?<br />
Although during my childhood my family had to move a lot, I've lived in the most recent house for almost ten years. Comparing to the old houses, I think this house has been the best so far.<br />

6. Do you plan to live there for a long time?<br />
The answer would be yes if the respondent is my parents, since moving in and out is too time-consuming and exhausting. Cleaning and arranging everything all over again would be like torture to them. For me, on the other hand, as I'm thinking of moving out to start my adult life, hopefully soon I'll be able to afford to live in a flat or an apartment.<br />

7. What's the difference between where you are living now and where you have lived in the past? <br />
As I've already mentioned my family moved several times when I was younger. And the most current house where we've been living for about ten years is the best house so far. All of us have separate rooms for our need of privacy yet a big dining room where we can spend the whole evenings together watching TV or having dinner.<br />

8. Can you describe the place where you live?/ Please describe the room you live in<br />
Briefly, my humble house locates in a small and quite street, so coming home to me is like all the craziness happened outside is left behind. Just beside my house stands a big old tree. I have my own room with walls painted violet, which is kinda a peaceful color. The air outside is fresh. I usually open the window to enjoy the wind and sunshine, which will help cool down my room without an air conditioner. Since I spend most of my time staying at home, my room means the whole world to me. It's like a friend who is always there to share ups and downs with me. So yeah, I would always miss my house, my room whenever I'm away.<br />

9. Which part of your home do you like the most?<br />
It's the dining room where my family spends our time together. Not only lunch or dinner but all our family reunions take place in the dining room where we can enjoy a harmonious atmosphere. We always try to keep the family dinner as something we cannot go a day without, since for us it's the family bonding that lies behind.<br />

10. Why do you think some people invest a huge amount of money in buying houses?<br />
People certainly have different reasons to buy a property. I believe the most important one is privacy. You will gain much more independence and freedom to refurbish the place as you please since you are the owner. Besides, it would create a pride of ownership. No matter how small or big your house is, it is yours to renovate or brag about.<br />

11. Should we live in a flat or a house?<br />
It heavily depends on people's preference and affordability since each type of property has its own perks.
