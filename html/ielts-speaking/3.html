🎧 Do you like to <span>watch</span> <span>sports</span> on <span>TV</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Not at all! I <span>despise</span> <span>(hate)</span> it. I get <span>extremely</span> <span>bored</span> and <span>disinterested</span>. I usually try to <span>avoid</span> <span>watching</span> <span>sports</span> on <span>TV</span> at all <span>costs</span> <span>unless</span> it's an <span>exciting</span> <span>event</span>, like the <span>World</span> Cup or <span>Super</span> <span>Bowl</span>. In that case, I go for the <span>social</span> <span>event</span> rather than the game <span>itself</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you play any <span>sports</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Not <span>anymore</span>. I was an <span>avid</span> <span>(enthusiastic)</span> <span>swimmer</span> as a <span>child</span>, but I gave that up after high school, as it was quite <span>time-consuming</span>. <span>Nowadays</span>, I enjoy going to the gym, <span>running</span> around the <span>lake</span> by my house, and going on <span>mountain</span> <span>treks</span>. I'm not sure if these are <span>considered</span> <span>sports</span>, but I'm really into <span>physical</span> <span>activity</span>.<br/>
🎧 Which is the <span>popular</span> <span>sports</span> in your <span>country</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Soccer</span> of course! <span>As</span> <span>soccer</span> is the <span>sport</span> of the <span>world</span>, that would be <span>number</span> one. <span>People</span> go <span>wild</span> when our <span>team</span> <span>wins</span> a <span>game-</span> they even drive around <span>waving</span> <span>flags</span>, <span>blocking</span> off the <span>streets</span>! <span>Apart</span> from this, many people enjoy playing <span>tennis</span> and doing <span>martial</span> <span>arts</span>.<br/>
🎧 Who is your <span>favorite</span> <span>sports</span> <span>star</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>As</span> I'm not a big <span>sports</span> fan, I don't really have one. <span>However</span>, I think I may like <span>Cristiano</span> <span>Ronaldo</span>. Although I don't know anything about him or his <span>athletic</span> <span>abilities</span>, I think I've always been <span>drawn</span> to him <span>(attracted</span> <span>to)</span> because of his looks.<br/>
🎧 What <span>kinds</span> of <span>sports</span> would you like to try in the <span>future</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I'm really <span>intrigued</span> by <span>soccer</span>. I think it's something that can really <span>connect</span> people, as well as is good <span>cardiovascular</span> and <span>coordination</span> <span>activity</span>. Actually, I wish I had <span>gotten</span> into it as a <span>child</span>. I think it would be <span>interesting</span> to join a <span>league</span> in my <span>city</span>. <span><br/>

🎧 Do you do any <span>physical</span> <span>exercise</span>?<br/> 
🎧 You could call me a <span>couch</span> <span>potato</span> <span>(a</span> <span>lazy</span> person who <span>sits</span> on the <span>sofa</span> a lot. <span>"Couch"</span> is another <span>word</span> for <span>sofa)</span>. I'm <span>naturally</span> <span>thin</span> without any <span>exercise</span>, so I'm quite <span>lazy</span> when it comes to <span>exercise</span>. I do go for <span>mountain</span> <span>hikes</span>, but I should definitely do more to <span>gain</span> <span>muscle</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do young people in your <span>country</span> like to do <span>exercise</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Gyms</span> are not very <span>popular</span> in my <span>country</span> because of the <span>cost</span>, but I would say that people get their <span>fair</span> share of <span>exercise</span> everyday because of the <span>hills</span> in the <span>city</span>. many people <span>climb</span> a <span>mountain</span> to their home every <span>single</span> day! I used to live in a house that was <span>unreachable</span> by car and a <span>total</span> of <span>200</span> <span>stairs</span> to get there!<br/> 
🎧 Do you think people are <span>keen</span> on doing <span>physical</span> <span>activity</span>? <span>Why</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Well, I think they are quite <span>accustomed</span> to it. I don't think they would be too <span>keen</span> on going to the gym, but they really enjoy going on <span>mountain</span> <span>hikes</span>. Since our <span>religion</span> is <span>based</span> <span>upon</span> the <span>Mother</span> <span>Earth</span> and the <span>Mountain</span> <span>Gods</span>, these <span>treks</span> are a <span>spiritual</span> <span>journey

🎧 How often do you drink <span>water</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Well, everyday of course! <span>Staying</span> <span>hydrated</span> <span>(provide</span> water for someone to keep them <span>healthy)</span> is a <span>priority</span> for me since I <span>easily</span> get a <span>headache</span> if I don't, not to <span>mention</span> my <span>weight</span> <span>loss</span> <span>goals</span>. <span>Drinking</span> enough water is of <span>paramount</span> <span>importance</span> for <span>health</span>.<br/>
🎧 What kind of water do you like to drink?<br/> 
🎧 All different <span>kinds;</span> I'm not too <span>picky</span> <span>(selective)</span>! I either drink tap water that I put in a <span>Brita</span> <span>filter</span>, or <span>bottled</span> water from time to time <span>(sometimes)</span>. I usually put water in my <span>refillable</span> water <span>bottle</span> and <span>carry</span> it around me with me all day.<br/>
🎧 Do you drink <span>bottled</span> water or water from water <span>machines</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Bottled</span> water. Since the water in my <span>country</span> is <span>potable</span> <span>(drinkable)</span>, I usually <span>opt</span> for that with a <span>filter</span> to <span>improve</span> the <span>flavor</span>. If this <span>isn't</span> <span>available</span> to me, I buy a <span>bottle</span> of water, although I <span>prefer</span> not to because of my <span>environmental</span> <span>concerns

🎧 Hello. Come in please and have a <span>seat</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 And can I have your <span>passport</span>, please?<br/> 
🎧 Yes. There you go.<br/>
🎧 Thanks, and may I have your full name, please?<br/> 
🎧 My name is <span>Nargess</span> <span>Barzegar</span>, but <span>everybody</span> <span>calls</span> me <span>Ameneh</span>. It's been my <span>nickname</span> since I was <span>born</span>.<br/>
🎧 Does your name have any special <span>meaning</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Well, yes. The name <span>Nargess</span> is a <span>flower</span>. It's in <span>actual</span> <span>fact</span> a <span>Daffodil</span>.<br/>
🎧 Alright. And who gave this <span>nickname</span> to you?<br/> 
🎧 Well, it's an <span>interesting</span> <span>story</span> because at the time that I was <span>born</span> there was a very <span>popular</span> <span>song</span>, a pop <span>song</span> by the name of <span>"Ameneh"</span>, and my <span>older</span> <span>siblings</span> who were <span>children</span> at the time, <span>decided</span> there and then that this should be my name, <span>Ameneh</span>, but my <span>parents</span> didn't agree.<br/>
🎧 Alright <span>Ameneh</span>. Is your name <span>important</span> to you?<br/> 
🎧 Well yes, I think <span>everybody's</span> name is <span>important</span> to them. It's the one thing that you <span>fully</span> <span>associate</span> yourself with.<br/>
🎧 OK, thanks <span>Ameneh</span>. And tell me where do you come <span>from</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Well I come from <span>Tehran</span>, which is the <span>capital</span> of <span>Iran</span>. <span>Tehran</span> is a <span>bustling</span> <span>city</span> with a very <span>large</span> <span>population</span> of! think about <span>E7</span> <span>million</span> people. It's a very <span>busy</span> and <span>polluted</span> <span>city</span>, but at the same time it's very <span>charming</span> and you can meet people from all <span>sorts</span> of <span>backgrounds</span>.<br/>
🎧 Alright <span>Ameneh</span>. What do you like about your <span>hometown</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Well, like I said, I like the <span>fact</span> that you can meet people from all <span>sorts</span> of <span>backgrounds</span>. My <span>hometown</span>, <span>Tehran</span>, has <span>beautiful</span> <span>mountains</span> in the <span>North</span>. It's very <span>vibrant</span>. You can almost find something <span>interesting</span> in every <span>neighbourhood</span>. There's lots of <span>activity</span> going on during the day, which makes it very <span>interesting</span> as a <span>city</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, <span>Ameneh</span>. Tell me, what do most of the people do in your <span>hometown</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Well, as <span>Tehran</span> is the <span>capital</span>, there's a <span>variety</span> of <span>vocations</span> and <span>activities</span> going on during the day. <span>Obviously</span> it's the <span>base</span> of a <span>country</span>, so you have <span>businessmen</span>, you have lots of <span>shops</span>, and you have many <span>ministries</span>, many <span>schools</span>. All in all, there's a <span>variety</span> of <span>jobs</span> and <span>activities</span> going on.<br/>
🎧 OK, thanks <span>Ameneh</span>. Now let's move on to the <span>second</span> <span>part</span>. I would like to show you a <span>topic</span> <span>card</span>, and you have to talk about this <span>topic</span> for about two <span>minutes</span>. You have one <span>minute</span> to <span>prepare</span> yourself. <span>Here</span> is a <span>paper</span> and a <span>pencil</span>. You can <span>write</span> down your <span>notes</span> if you wish.<br/>
🎧 Thank you very <span>much

🎧 Thanks <span>Ameneh</span>. Now I would like to ask you a few more <span>questions</span> <span>related</span> to the same <span>topic</span>. How <span>important</span> is <span>goal-setting</span> in your <span>life</span>?<br/> 
🎧 This is <span>extremely</span> <span>important</span>. If you don't set <span>goals</span> <span>-</span> <span>reachable</span>, <span>feasible</span> <span>goals</span> <span>-</span> then you may as well just <span>stop</span> doing what you're doing. If you don't set these <span>goals</span>, then you <span>lose</span> <span>track</span> of what you've been up to and what else needs to be done. This <span>leads</span> to really <span>destructive</span> <span>disorganisation</span>, and at the end of the day you probably will end up without enough time, <span>sufficient</span> time to <span>reach</span> what you set out to <span>reach</span>. That's why <span>self-discipline</span> in <span>keeping</span> <span>within</span> your <span>timeframe</span> for these <span>goals</span>, and working <span>hard</span> to <span>reach</span> them really does make a <span>difference</span>.<br/>
🎧 Tell me <span>Ameneh</span>, do you <span>consider</span> yourself a <span>real</span> <span>success</span>?<br/> 
🎧 That's a <span>difficult</span> <span>question</span> to answer, because I might not be the <span>biggest</span> <span>success</span> <span>compared</span> to other people. But for me <span>personally</span>, yes. My <span>personal</span> <span>opinion</span> of myself, with the <span>circumstances</span> that I had, I do <span>consider</span> myself quite a <span>success</span> because after all, I did <span>manage</span> to <span>divide</span> my time <span>fairly</span> between my <span>studies</span>, the <span>pursuit</span> of my <span>education</span>, and my <span>family</span>. I don't think I <span>compromised</span> my <span>family</span> in <span>order</span> to <span>reach</span> my <span>educational</span> <span>goals</span>. So <span>therefore</span>, yes, I do <span>consider</span> myself a <span>success</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK thanks. And do you think having an <span>organised</span> <span>programme</span> can <span>lead</span> to <span>people's</span> <span>success</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Well I think it's of the <span>utmost</span> <span>importance</span> actually. I think that not having an <span>organised</span> <span>programme</span> or <span>schedule</span> will almost <span>certainly</span> <span>result</span> in the <span>shortage</span> of time. It's <span>specifically</span> <span>important</span> for <span>short-term</span> <span>goals</span>, as time is of the <span>essence</span>. A <span>schedule</span> is also <span>necessary</span> for <span>long-term</span> <span>goals</span>. Because its <span>human</span> <span>nature</span> to put things off <span>till</span> later, or you know, <span>procrastinate</span>, and you end up <span>running</span> out of time without even <span>realising</span> it. So, having a <span>schedule</span> will help you keep <span>track</span> of it.<br/>
🎧 Thank you very much. This is the end of the <span>speaking</span> <span>test</span> Have a nice day.<br/>
🎧 Thank you. You <span>too
</span>.<br/> <br/>
