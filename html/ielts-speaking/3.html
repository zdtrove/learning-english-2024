ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>like</span> to <span>watch</span> <span>sports</span> <span>on</span> <span>TV?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Not <span>at</span> all! I <span>despise</span> <span>(hate)</span> <span>it</span>. I get <span>extremely</span> <span>bored</span> and <span>disinterested</span>. I <span>usually</span> try to <span>avoid</span> <span>watching</span> <span>sports</span> <span>on</span> <span>TV</span> <span>at</span> all <span>costs</span> <span>unless</span> it's an <span>exciting</span> <span>event</span>, <span>like</span> the <span>World</span> Cup <span>or</span> <span>Super</span> <span>Bowl</span>. <span>In</span> <span>that</span> <span>case</span>, I <span>go</span> for the <span>social</span> <span>event</span> <span>rather</span> <span>than</span> the <span>game</span> <span>itself</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>play</span> any <span>sports?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Not <span>anymore</span>. I was an <span>avid</span> <span>(enthusiastic)</span> <span>swimmer</span> <span>as</span> a <span>child</span>, but I <span>gave</span> <span>that</span> <span>up</span> <span>after</span> high <span>school</span>, <span>as</span> <span>it</span> was <span>quite</span> <span>time-consuming</span>. <span>Nowadays</span>, I <span>enjoy</span> <span>going</span> to the gym, <span>running</span> <span>around</span> the <span>lake</span> by my <span>house</span>, and <span>going</span> <span>on</span> <span>mountain</span> <span>treks</span>. <span>I'm</span> not <span>sure</span> <span>if</span> <span>these</span> are <span>considered</span> <span>sports</span>, but <span>I'm</span> <span>really</span> <span>into</span> <span>physical</span> <span>activity</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Which <span>is</span> the <span>popular</span> <span>sports</span> <span>in</span> your <span>country?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Soccer</span> <span>of</span> <span>course</span>! <span>As</span> <span>soccer</span> <span>is</span> the <span>sport</span> <span>of</span> the <span>world</span>, <span>that</span> <span>would</span> be <span>number</span> one. <span>People</span> <span>go</span> <span>wild</span> when our <span>team</span> <span>wins</span> a <span>game-</span> <span>they</span> <span>even</span> <span>drive</span> <span>around</span> <span>waving</span> <span>flags</span>, <span>blocking</span> off the <span>streets</span>! <span>Apart</span> <span>from</span> <span>this</span>, many <span>people</span> <span>enjoy</span> <span>playing</span> <span>tennis</span> and <span>doing</span> <span>martial</span> <span>arts</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Who <span>is</span> your <span>favorite</span> <span>sports</span> <span>star?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>As</span> <span>I'm</span> not a big <span>sports</span> fan, I don't <span>really</span> have one. <span>However</span>, I <span>think</span> I may <span>like</span> <span>Cristiano</span> <span>Ronaldo</span>. <span>Although</span> I don't <span>know</span> <span>anything</span> <span>about</span> him <span>or</span> his <span>athletic</span> <span>abilities</span>, I <span>think</span> I've <span>always</span> <span>been</span> <span>drawn</span> to him <span>(attracted</span> <span>to)</span> <span>because</span> <span>of</span> his <span>looks</span>.<br/>

I <span>think</span> <span>it</span> <span>would</span> be <span>interesting</span> to <span>join</span> a <span>league</span> <span>in</span> my <span>city</span>. <span><br/>

ðŸŽ§ <span>Thanks</span> <span>Ameneh</span>. Now I <span>would</span> <span>like</span> to ask you a few <span>more</span> <span>questions</span> <span>related</span> to the <span>same</span> <span>topic</span>. How <span>important</span> <span>is</span> <span>goal-setting</span> <span>in</span> your <span>life?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>This</span> <span>is</span> <span>extremely</span> <span>important</span>. <span>If</span> you don't set <span>goals</span> <span>-</span> <span>reachable</span>, <span>feasible</span> <span>goals</span> <span>-</span> <span>then</span> you may <span>as</span> <span>well</span> <span>just</span> <span>stop</span> <span>doing</span> what you're <span>doing</span>. <span>If</span> you don't set <span>these</span> <span>goals</span>, <span>then</span> you <span>lose</span> <span>track</span> <span>of</span> what you've <span>been</span> <span>up</span> to and what <span>else</span> <span>needs</span> to be <span>done</span>. <span>This</span> <span>leads</span> to <span>really</span> <span>destructive</span> <span>disorganisation</span>, and <span>at</span> the end <span>of</span> the day you <span>probably</span> <span>will</span> end <span>up</span> <span>without</span> <span>enough</span> <span>time</span>, <span>sufficient</span> <span>time</span> to <span>reach</span> what you set out to <span>reach</span>. That's why <span>self-discipline</span> <span>in</span> <span>keeping</span> <span>within</span> your <span>timeframe</span> for <span>these</span> <span>goals</span>, and <span>working</span> <span>hard</span> to <span>reach</span> <span>them</span> <span>really</span> <span>does</span> make a <span>difference</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Tell</span> me <span>Ameneh</span>, do you <span>consider</span> <span>yourself</span> a <span>real</span> <span>success?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ That's a <span>difficult</span> <span>question</span> to <span>answer</span>, <span>because</span> I <span>might</span> not be the <span>biggest</span> <span>success</span> <span>compared</span> to <span>other</span> <span>people</span>. But for me <span>personally</span>, <span>yes</span>. My <span>personal</span> <span>opinion</span> <span>of</span> <span>myself</span>, <span>with</span> the <span>circumstances</span> <span>that</span> I had, I do <span>consider</span> <span>myself</span> <span>quite</span> a <span>success</span> <span>because</span> <span>after</span> all, I did <span>manage</span> to <span>divide</span> my <span>time</span> <span>fairly</span> <span>between</span> my <span>studies</span>, the <span>pursuit</span> <span>of</span> my <span>education</span>, and my <span>family</span>. I don't <span>think</span> I <span>compromised</span> my <span>family</span> <span>in</span> <span>order</span> to <span>reach</span> my <span>educational</span> <span>goals</span>. So <span>therefore</span>, <span>yes</span>, I do <span>consider</span> <span>myself</span> a <span>success</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>OK</span> <span>thanks</span>. And do you <span>think</span> <span>having</span> an <span>organised</span> <span>programme</span> can <span>lead</span> to <span>people's</span> <span>success?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span> I <span>think</span> it's <span>of</span> the <span>utmost</span> <span>importance</span> <span>actually</span>. I <span>think</span> <span>that</span> not <span>having</span> an <span>organised</span> <span>programme</span> <span>or</span> <span>schedule</span> <span>will</span> <span>almost</span> <span>certainly</span> <span>result</span> <span>in</span> the <span>shortage</span> <span>of</span> <span>time</span>. It's <span>specifically</span> <span>important</span> for <span>short-term</span> <span>goals</span>, <span>as</span> <span>time</span> <span>is</span> <span>of</span> the <span>essence</span>. A <span>schedule</span> <span>is</span> <span>also</span> <span>necessary</span> for <span>long-term</span> <span>goals</span>. <span>Because</span> its <span>human</span> <span>nature</span> to put <span>things</span> off <span>till</span> <span>later</span>, <span>or</span> you <span>know</span>, <span>procrastinate</span>, and you end <span>up</span> <span>running</span> out <span>of</span> <span>time</span> <span>without</span> <span>even</span> <span>realising</span> <span>it</span>. So, <span>having</span> a <span>schedule</span> <span>will</span> <span>help</span> you <span>keep</span> <span>track</span> <span>of</span> <span>it</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you <span>very</span> <span>much</span>. <span>This</span> <span>is</span> the end <span>of</span> the <span>speaking</span> <span>test</span> Have a <span>nice</span> <span>day</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thank</span> you. You <span>too.<br/>
