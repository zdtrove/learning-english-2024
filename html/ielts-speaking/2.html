ðŸŽ§ <span>Is</span> <span>money</span> <span>important</span> to <span>you?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>So-so</span>. To be <span>honest</span>, <span>money</span> can <span>help</span> your <span>life</span>. <span>As</span> I <span>know</span> <span>I'm</span> a <span>person</span> who <span>likes</span> <span>traveling</span> <span>abroad</span>, I <span>know</span> I <span>must</span> have a <span>high-paying</span> <span>job</span> to be <span>able</span> to <span>attain</span> <span>this</span> <span>lifestyle</span>. When I have <span>this</span> <span>freedom</span> to have new <span>experiences</span>, I <span>feel</span> a lot <span>happier</span>. So, <span>because</span> <span>of</span> <span>this</span> <span>I'd</span> say <span>money</span> <span>matters</span> to <span>me</span> .<br/>
ðŸŽ§ How do you <span>save</span> <span>money?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I <span>think</span> it's <span>always</span> <span>important</span> to have a <span>certain</span> <span>number</span> <span>in</span> <span>mind</span>. I <span>think</span> <span>of</span> a <span>goal</span> <span>amount</span> to <span>save</span> <span>each</span> <span>month</span> and <span>pretend</span> <span>as</span> <span>if</span> I don't have <span>it</span>. <span>This</span> has <span>been</span> a <span>huge</span> <span>success</span> for me. <span>With</span> <span>these</span> <span>savings</span>, I've <span>been</span> <span>able</span> to <span>take</span> my <span>dream</span> <span>vacations</span> and buy <span>nice</span> <span>gifts</span> for my <span>family</span> .<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Did you <span>save</span> <span>money</span> when you <span>were</span> <span>young?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>As</span> I've <span>always</span> <span>dreamt</span> <span>of</span> <span>traveling</span> the <span>world</span>, I <span>used</span> to <span>save</span> <span>money</span> <span>in</span> a <span>piggybank</span>! <span>Although</span> <span>these</span> <span>savings</span> <span>never</span> <span>amounted</span> to <span>anything</span> <span>substantial</span>, <span>maybe</span> <span>just</span> <span>some</span> <span>movie</span> <span>tickets</span> <span>or</span> <span>candy</span>, <span>I'm</span> <span>glad</span> I did <span>it</span> <span>as</span> a way to <span>teach</span> <span>myself</span> to <span>save</span>. <span>I'll</span> <span>never</span> <span>forget</span> how sad I <span>felt</span> when <span>we</span> <span>broke</span> the <span>piggy-bank!<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Why do <span>people</span> <span>save</span> <span>money?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Various</span> <span>reasons</span>! I <span>think</span> the <span>main</span> <span>reasons</span> are to have a <span>safety</span> <span>blanket</span> <span>in</span> <span>case</span> <span>emergencies</span> <span>or</span> <span>unexpected</span> <span>costs</span> <span>arise</span>, <span>such</span> <span>as</span> a <span>flat</span> <span>tire</span> <span>or</span> a <span>broken</span> hot <span>water</span> <span>heater</span>, <span>or</span> to <span>save</span> for a <span>vacation</span> <span>or</span> <span>something</span> <span>specific</span> <span>that</span> <span>they</span> <span>would</span> <span>like</span> to buy. <span>Moreover</span>, <span>many</span> <span>parents</span> are <span>focused</span> <span>on</span> <span>saving</span> for <span>their</span> <span>children's</span> <span>schooling</span> and <span>college</span> <span>later</span> <span>on</span> .<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Have you <span>ever</span> <span>given</span> <span>money</span> to the <span>children?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Certainly</span>! <span>Although</span> I don't have any <span>children</span> <span>of</span> my <span>own</span> <span>yet</span>, I <span>like</span> to <span>slip</span> a <span>20</span> <span>dollar</span> <span>bill</span> <span>into</span> <span>birthday</span> <span>cards</span> for my <span>young</span> <span>nieces</span> and <span>nephews</span>. <span>Furthermore</span>, when I've <span>traveled</span>, I <span>often</span> buy <span>things</span> <span>from</span> <span>children</span> <span>selling</span> <span>on</span> the <span>streets.<br/>

ðŸŽ§ Have you <span>ever</span> <span>tried</span> <span>foreign</span> <span>food?<br/></span>

ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>like</span> to try new <span>food?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Absolutely</span>! I <span>think</span> <span>it</span> <span>adds</span> <span>color</span> to our <span>live</span> and <span>tastebuds</span> <span>(part</span> <span>on</span> our <span>tongue</span> <span>that</span> <span>controls</span> <span>taste)</span>. <span>As</span> <span>Iâ€™m</span> a big <span>foodie</span>, <span>Iâ€™m</span> <span>always</span> <span>open</span> to <span>trying</span> new <span>cuisines</span>. <span>Iâ€™ve</span> <span>never</span> <span>been</span> <span>very</span> <span>fearful</span> <span>nor</span> <span>picky</span> when <span>it</span> <span>comes</span> to <span>trying</span> new <span>foods</span>. <span>Even</span> <span>sometimes</span> the <span>scariest</span> <span>looking</span> <span>dishes</span> <span>Iâ€™ve</span> <span>tried</span> have <span>ended</span> <span>up</span> <span>being</span> <span>delicious</span>, <span>such</span> <span>as</span> <span>sheep</span> <span>head</span> <span>soup</span> <span>in</span> <span>Peru</span> and <span>tarantula</span> <span>in</span> <span>Cambodia</span> .<br/>
ðŸŽ§ How <span>often</span> did you eat <span>foreign</span> <span>food</span> when you <span>were</span> <span>young?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Since</span> my <span>father</span> <span>is</span> <span>of</span> <span>Turkish</span> <span>decent</span> where my <span>mother</span> <span>is</span> <span>German</span>, <span>we</span> have <span>always</span> had a <span>fusion</span> <span>(mixture)</span> <span>of</span> <span>cuisines</span> <span>in</span> my <span>home</span>. <span>Furthermore</span>, my <span>father</span> <span>only</span> <span>eats</span> <span>halal</span> <span>meat</span>, so <span>we</span> <span>would</span> <span>often</span> <span>go</span> <span>Middle</span> <span>Eastern</span> <span>or</span> <span>Indian</span> <span>restaurants</span> to <span>accommodate</span> <span>this</span>. <span>Moreover</span>, my <span>mother</span> has <span>always</span> had a <span>taste</span> for <span>Asian</span> <span>cuisines</span>, so <span>we</span> have <span>always</span> <span>incorporated</span> <span>Vietnamese</span>, <span>Chinese</span>, <span>Thai</span>, <span>etc</span> <span>foods</span> <span>into</span> our <span>eating</span> <span>habits</span> <span>as</span> <span>well</span> .<br/>

One <span>of</span> the <span>things</span> I <span>like</span> <span>most</span> <span>about</span> <span>living</span> <span>in</span> <span>Europe</span> <span>is</span> <span>that</span> <span>each</span> <span>country</span> has <span>itâ€™s</span> <span>own</span> <span>unique</span> <span>cuisine</span>. I <span>really</span> <span>enjoy</span> the <span>waffles</span>, <span>chocolate</span>, and <span>beer</span> <span>from</span> one <span>of</span> our <span>neighbors</span>, <span>Belgium</span>, <span>as</span> <span>well</span> <span>as</span> the one <span>of</span> a <span>kind</span> <span>perogies</span> <span>(a</span> <span>traditional</span> <span>Polish</span> <span>dish)</span> <span>from</span> <span>Poland</span>. All <span>in</span> all, <span>Iâ€™d</span> have to say <span>that</span> <span>Mediterranean</span> <span>cuisines</span>, <span>especially</span> <span>Greek</span> and <span>Italian</span>, <span>foods</span> are my <span>favorite</span>. There are few <span>things</span> <span>that</span> <span>compare</span> to <span>those</span> <span>fresh</span> <span>ingredients</span> and <span>delicious</span> <span>olives!<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Do <span>people</span> <span>in</span> your <span>country</span> <span>like</span> <span>foreign</span> <span>food?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>As</span> <span>Germany</span> <span>welcomes</span> <span>many</span> <span>immigrants</span> <span>into</span> our <span>country</span>, I <span>would</span> say <span>yes</span>, <span>since</span> <span>people</span> have <span>always</span> <span>been</span> <span>exposed</span> to <span>different</span> <span>types</span> <span>of</span> <span>food</span>. <span>In</span> my <span>experience</span>, I see <span>that</span> all <span>of</span> the <span>people</span> <span>in</span> my <span>circle</span> <span>embrace</span> <span>(to</span> <span>take</span> <span>advantage</span> <span>of)</span> the <span>unique</span> <span>variety</span> <span>of</span> <span>flavors</span> <span>that</span> <span>we</span> have <span>here</span> <span>in</span> <span>Berlin</span>. To be <span>honest</span>, I don't <span>know</span> <span>anyone</span> who doesn't <span>enjoy</span> a <span>juicy</span> <span>Doner</span> <span>kebab!<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Will</span> <span>people</span> eat <span>more</span> <span>or</span> <span>less</span> <span>foreign</span> <span>food?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>More</span>! <span>Since</span> <span>Germany</span> <span>continues</span> to be one <span>of</span> the <span>most</span> <span>desirable</span> <span>migration</span> <span>destinations</span> <span>in</span> the <span>world</span>, <span>Iâ€™m</span> <span>sure</span> <span>that</span> <span>even</span> <span>more</span> <span>foreign</span> <span>cuisines</span> <span>will</span> be <span>introduced</span> <span>into</span> our <span>country</span>. <span>Moreover</span>, I <span>think</span> <span>that</span> the <span>traditional</span> <span>German</span> <span>food</span> may <span>become</span> a <span>fusion</span> <span>with</span> <span>other</span> <span>popular</span> <span>cuisines</span> <span>here</span>. I <span>really</span> <span>look</span> <span>forward</span> to <span>this</span>! I <span>think</span> <span>that</span> <span>multi-cultural</span> <span>foods</span> <span>bring</span> <span>more</span> <span>culture</span> and <span>richness</span> <span>(diversity)</span> to a <span>place.<br/>

I got so <span>lost</span> and <span>ended</span> <span>up</span> <span>calling</span> my <span>father</span> <span>in</span> <span>tears</span> <span>(crying)</span>! <span>Since</span> <span>online</span> <span>maps</span> and <span>GPS</span>, <span>it</span> has <span>become</span> <span>much</span> <span>easier</span> to get <span>around</span> .<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Did you use <span>paper</span> <span>maps</span> <span>before?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Oh</span>, I can <span>remember</span> <span>those</span> <span>days</span> <span>(an</span> <span>expression</span> when <span>talking</span> <span>fondly</span> <span>about</span> the <span>past)</span>! The <span>glove</span> <span>box(the</span> <span>place</span> <span>in</span> <span>front</span> <span>of</span> your <span>carseat</span> to <span>store</span> <span>things)</span> <span>in</span> my car was <span>full</span> <span>of</span> <span>maps</span> and my <span>father</span> <span>used</span> to <span>draw</span> <span>them</span> for me when I was new to the <span>road</span>. <span>Furthermore</span>, <span>even</span> <span>nowadays</span> when I <span>travel</span>, I <span>often</span> <span>stop</span> by the <span>tourist</span> <span>information</span> <span>desk</span> and get a <span>free</span> <span>map</span> .<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Have you <span>ever</span> <span>asked</span> <span>somebody/passer-by</span> for <span>directions?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I <span>believe</span> <span>that</span> <span>people</span> <span>will</span> <span>help</span> you <span>in</span> <span>most</span> <span>cases</span>, so I <span>certainly</span> have. I <span>know</span> <span>some</span> <span>people</span> <span>feel</span> shy <span>or</span> <span>maybe</span> too <span>proud</span> to ask for <span>help</span>, but <span>Iâ€™m</span> not one <span>of</span> <span>these</span>. <span>Although</span> <span>Iâ€™ve</span> <span>been</span> <span>rejected</span> a few <span>times</span>, <span>more</span> <span>times</span> <span>than</span> not <span>people</span> have <span>gone</span> out <span>of</span> <span>their</span> way <span>(put</span> <span>in</span> a lot <span>of</span> <span>effort</span> to <span>help</span> <span>you)</span> to <span>give</span> me <span>detailed</span> <span>directions</span> <span>with</span> <span>landmarks</span> <span>included</span> to my <span>destination</span> .<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What <span>type</span> <span>of</span> <span>maps</span> do <span>people</span> use the <span>most</span> <span>nowadays</span>? <span>Why?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Google</span> <span>maps</span> <span>or</span> <span>other</span> <span>online</span> <span>maps/GPS</span> have <span>completely</span> <span>taken</span> <span>over</span> <span>(became</span> <span>popular)</span>. <span>Nowadays</span>, you <span>donâ€™t</span> <span>even</span> <span>need</span> to <span>know</span> where <span>youâ€™re</span> <span>going</span>. <span>Since</span> <span>we</span> have <span>these</span> <span>modern</span> day <span>conveniences</span>, <span>less</span> and <span>less</span> <span>people</span> are <span>going</span> <span>through</span> the <span>hassle</span> <span>(inconvenience)</span> <span>of</span> <span>reading</span> a <span>paper</span> map. <span>Furthermore</span>, <span>since</span> <span>GPS</span> and <span>online</span> <span>maps</span> are so <span>popular</span>, <span>perhaps</span> <span>people</span> are <span>losing</span> the <span>skill</span> to <span>read</span> and <span>follow</span> a <span>map.<br/>

ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>like</span> any <span>teachers</span> <span>of</span> <span>yours?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ There <span>were</span> a few <span>teachers</span> <span>that</span> I was <span>particularly</span> <span>fond</span> <span>of</span>. <span>Iâ€™ll</span> <span>tell</span> you <span>about</span> my <span>high</span> <span>school</span> <span>PE</span> <span>teacher</span>, <span>Mrs</span>. <span>Burrier</span>. <span>Since</span> she <span>knew</span> I was <span>painfully</span> shy and <span>especially</span> <span>clumsy</span> <span>(can</span> <span>easily</span> <span>trip</span> <span>or</span> <span>fall)</span> when <span>it</span> <span>comes</span> to gym <span>class</span>, she <span>allowed</span> me to do the <span>dance</span> <span>routine</span> <span>that</span> she <span>assigned</span> to <span>us</span> <span>in</span> a <span>private</span> <span>room</span> <span>only</span> <span>in</span> <span>front</span> <span>of</span> her to <span>save</span> me <span>from</span> <span>embarrassment</span>. I so <span>appreciated</span> <span>it!<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>still</span> <span>keep</span> <span>in</span> <span>touch</span> <span>with</span> your <span>teacher?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Iâ€™ve</span> <span>lost</span> <span>contact</span> <span>with</span> all <span>elementary</span> and <span>middle</span> <span>school</span> <span>teachers</span>, but I <span>keep</span> <span>in</span> <span>touch</span> <span>with</span> a <span>couple</span> <span>university</span> <span>professors</span>. <span>As</span> <span>uni</span> <span>professors</span> are <span>allowed</span> to have <span>more</span> <span>of</span> a <span>relationship</span> <span>with</span> <span>students</span>, <span>it</span> was <span>easier</span> to get to <span>know</span> <span>them</span>. My <span>Spanish</span> <span>professor</span> and I <span>message</span> <span>back</span> and <span>forth</span> <span>every</span> <span>year</span> to <span>catch</span> <span>up</span> .<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>want</span> to be a <span>teacher?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>As</span> <span>Iâ€™m</span> not a <span>patient</span> <span>person</span>, I <span>donâ€™t</span> <span>think</span> <span>teaching</span> <span>is</span> for me. <span>Furthermore</span>, I <span>dread</span> <span>(donâ€™t</span> <span>look</span> <span>forward</span> <span>to)</span> the <span>thought</span> <span>of</span> <span>standing</span> <span>in</span> <span>front</span> <span>of</span> the <span>classroom</span> <span>trying</span> to get the <span>classâ€™s</span> <span>attention</span> <span>while</span> the <span>children</span> <span>fool</span> <span>around</span> <span>(play)</span>. I <span>think</span> <span>it</span> <span>takes</span> a <span>special</span> <span>person</span> to be a <span>teacher</span>, and <span>unfortunately</span> I <span>donâ€™t</span> <span>meet</span> the <span>criteria!<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>remember</span> your <span>fav</span> <span>teach</span> <span>from</span> <span>primary</span> <span>school?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Of</span> <span>course</span>! <span>Iâ€™ll</span> <span>tell</span> you <span>about</span> my <span>second</span> <span>grade</span> <span>teacher</span>, <span>Ms</span>. <span>Puleo</span>. She was <span>always</span> <span>kind</span>, <span>encouraging</span>, and <span>incredibly</span> <span>patient</span>, <span>even</span> <span>with</span> <span>us</span> <span>little</span> <span>rascals</span> <span>(slang</span> for <span>kids)</span>. I <span>always</span> <span>felt</span> a <span>sense</span> <span>of</span> <span>warmth</span> <span>in</span> her <span>classroom</span>, which the <span>students</span> <span>responded</span> <span>well</span> to. The <span>world</span> <span>needs</span> <span>more</span> <span>teachers</span> <span>like</span> <span>her</span> .<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Did you <span>pretend</span> to be a <span>teacher</span> <span>in</span> the <span>childhood?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Oh</span> <span>yes</span>! I <span>remember</span> <span>playing</span> <span>teacher</span> <span>with</span> a <span>small</span> <span>chalkboard</span> my <span>friend</span> had <span>at</span> her <span>house</span>. I <span>used</span> to <span>think</span> <span>it</span> was so <span>entertaining</span> to be the <span>teacher</span> and <span>give</span> the <span>class</span> <span>assignments</span> to <span>do;</span> I <span>usually</span> <span>focused</span> <span>on</span> <span>Math</span> and Art. I <span>loved</span> <span>pretending</span> to <span>give</span> <span>orders!<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ What <span>qualities</span> <span>should</span> a <span>good</span> <span>teacher</span> <span>have?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Firstly</span>, I <span>think</span> a <span>teacher</span> <span>needs</span> to be <span>patient</span>. <span>Secondly</span>, I <span>think</span> the <span>teacher</span> <span>must</span> be <span>kind</span> and <span>encouraging</span>, which <span>creates</span> a <span>warm</span>, <span>open</span> <span>learning</span> <span>environment</span>. I <span>also</span> <span>think</span> <span>they</span> <span>should</span> have <span>interpersonal</span> <span>skills</span> to be <span>able</span> to <span>understand</span> the <span>needs</span> <span>of</span> all <span>different</span> <span>students</span>. There are <span>different</span> <span>kinds</span> <span>of</span> <span>teachers</span>, but I <span>would</span> use <span>this</span> <span>as</span> <span>rule</span> <span>of</span> <span>thumb</span> <span>(a</span> <span>general</span> <span>rule).<br/></span>
