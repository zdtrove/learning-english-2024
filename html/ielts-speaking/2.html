ðŸŽ§ Is <span>money</span> <span>important</span> to <span>you?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>So-so</span>. To be <span>honest</span>, <span>money</span> can <span>help</span> your life. <span>As</span> I know <span>I'm</span> a <span>person</span> who <span>likes</span> <span>traveling</span> <span>abroad</span>, I know I <span>must</span> have a <span>high-paying</span> job to be <span>able</span> to <span>attain</span> this <span>lifestyle</span>. When I have this <span>freedom</span> to have new <span>experiences</span>, I feel a lot <span>happier</span>. So, <span>because</span> of this <span>I'd</span> say <span>money</span> <span>matters</span> to me.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ How do you <span>save</span> <span>money?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I think it's always <span>important</span> to have a <span>certain</span> <span>number</span> in <span>mind</span>. I think of a <span>goal</span> <span>amount</span> to <span>save</span> each <span>month</span> and <span>pretend</span> as if I don't have it. This has <span>been</span> a <span>huge</span> <span>success</span> for me. With <span>these</span> <span>savings</span>, I've <span>been</span> <span>able</span> to take my <span>dream</span> <span>vacations</span> and buy <span>nice</span> <span>gifts</span> for my <span>family</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Did you <span>save</span> <span>money</span> when you were <span>young?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>As</span> I've always <span>dreamt</span> of <span>traveling</span> the <span>world</span>, I used to <span>save</span> <span>money</span> in a <span>piggybank</span>! <span>Although</span> <span>these</span> <span>savings</span> <span>never</span> <span>amounted</span> to <span>anything</span> <span>substantial</span>, <span>maybe</span> just some <span>movie</span> <span>tickets</span> or <span>candy</span>, <span>I'm</span> <span>glad</span> I did it as a way to <span>teach</span> <span>myself</span> to <span>save</span>. <span>I'll</span> <span>never</span> <span>forget</span> how sad I <span>felt</span> when we <span>broke</span> the <span>piggy-bank!<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Why do <span>people</span> <span>save</span> <span>money?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Various</span> <span>reasons</span>! I think the <span>main</span> <span>reasons</span> are to have a <span>safety</span> <span>blanket</span> in <span>case</span> <span>emergencies</span> or <span>unexpected</span> <span>costs</span> <span>arise</span>, such as a <span>flat</span> <span>tire</span> or a <span>broken</span> hot <span>water</span> <span>heater</span>, or to <span>save</span> for a <span>vacation</span> or <span>something</span> <span>specific</span> that they would like to buy. <span>Moreover</span>, many <span>parents</span> are <span>focused</span> on <span>saving</span> for <span>their</span> <span>children's</span> <span>schooling</span> and <span>college</span> <span>later</span> on.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Have you <span>ever</span> <span>given</span> <span>money</span> to the <span>children?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Certainly</span>! <span>Although</span> I don't have any <span>children</span> of my own <span>yet</span>, I like to <span>slip</span> a <span>20</span> <span>dollar</span> <span>bill</span> into <span>birthday</span> <span>cards</span> for my <span>young</span> <span>nieces</span> and <span>nephews</span>. <span>Furthermore</span>, when I've <span>traveled</span>, I <span>often</span> buy <span>things</span> from <span>children</span> <span>selling</span> on the <span>streets.<br/>

ðŸŽ§ Have you <span>ever</span> <span>tried</span> <span>foreign</span> <span>food?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Of</span> <span>course</span>! <span>Since</span> <span>Germany</span> <span>welcomes</span> many <span>immigrants</span> and <span>refugees</span>, we <span>embrace</span> a <span>multi-cultural</span> <span>cuisine</span>. <span>Since</span> there are many with <span>Turkish</span> <span>roots</span> <span>living</span> here, we are <span>huge</span> <span>fans</span> of <span>kebab</span>. <span>Moreover</span>, we enjoy many <span>asian</span> <span>cuisines</span>, <span>especially</span> <span>Vietnamese</span>, <span>since</span> there is a <span>large</span> <span>Vietnamese</span> <span>community</span> <span>living</span> here.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you like to try new <span>food?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Absolutely</span>! I think it <span>adds</span> <span>color</span> to our live and <span>tastebuds</span> <span>(part</span> on our <span>tongue</span> that <span>controls</span> <span>taste)</span>. <span>As</span> <span>Iâ€™m</span> a big <span>foodie</span>, <span>Iâ€™m</span> always <span>open</span> to <span>trying</span> new <span>cuisines</span>. <span>Iâ€™ve</span> <span>never</span> <span>been</span> very <span>fearful</span> <span>nor</span> <span>picky</span> when it <span>comes</span> to <span>trying</span> new <span>foods</span>. Even <span>sometimes</span> the <span>scariest</span> <span>looking</span> <span>dishes</span> <span>Iâ€™ve</span> <span>tried</span> have <span>ended</span> up being <span>delicious</span>, such as <span>sheep</span> <span>head</span> <span>soup</span> in <span>Peru</span> and <span>tarantula</span> in <span>Cambodia</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ How <span>often</span> did you eat <span>foreign</span> <span>food</span> when you were <span>young?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Since</span> my <span>father</span> is of <span>Turkish</span> <span>decent</span> where my <span>mother</span> is <span>German</span>, we have always had a <span>fusion</span> <span>(mixture)</span> of <span>cuisines</span> in my <span>home</span>. <span>Furthermore</span>, my <span>father</span> <span>only</span> <span>eats</span> <span>halal</span> <span>meat</span>, so we would <span>often</span> go <span>Middle</span> <span>Eastern</span> or <span>Indian</span> <span>restaurants</span> to <span>accommodate</span> this. <span>Moreover</span>, my <span>mother</span> has always had a <span>taste</span> for <span>Asian</span> <span>cuisines</span>, so we have always <span>incorporated</span> <span>Vietnamese</span>, <span>Chinese</span>, <span>Thai</span>, <span>etc</span> <span>foods</span> into our <span>eating</span> <span>habits</span> as <span>well</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you like any <span>food</span> from <span>countries</span> <span>near</span> <span>yours?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Certainly</span>! One of the <span>things</span> I like <span>most</span> about <span>living</span> in <span>Europe</span> is that each <span>country</span> has <span>itâ€™s</span> own <span>unique</span> <span>cuisine</span>. I <span>really</span> enjoy the <span>waffles</span>, <span>chocolate</span>, and <span>beer</span> from one of our <span>neighbors</span>, <span>Belgium</span>, as <span>well</span> as the one of a <span>kind</span> <span>perogies</span> <span>(a</span> <span>traditional</span> <span>Polish</span> <span>dish)</span> from <span>Poland</span>. All in all, <span>Iâ€™d</span> have to say that <span>Mediterranean</span> <span>cuisines</span>, <span>especially</span> <span>Greek</span> and <span>Italian</span>, <span>foods</span> are my <span>favorite</span>. There are few <span>things</span> that <span>compare</span> to <span>those</span> <span>fresh</span> <span>ingredients</span> and <span>delicious</span> <span>olives!<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Do <span>people</span> in your <span>country</span> like <span>foreign</span> <span>food?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>As</span> <span>Germany</span> <span>welcomes</span> many <span>immigrants</span> into our <span>country</span>, I would say <span>yes</span>, <span>since</span> <span>people</span> have always <span>been</span> <span>exposed</span> to <span>different</span> <span>types</span> of <span>food</span>. <span>In</span> my <span>experience</span>, I see that all of the <span>people</span> in my <span>circle</span> <span>embrace</span> <span>(to</span> take <span>advantage</span> <span>of)</span> the <span>unique</span> <span>variety</span> of <span>flavors</span> that we have here in <span>Berlin</span>. To be <span>honest</span>, I don't know <span>anyone</span> who doesn't enjoy a <span>juicy</span> <span>Doner</span> <span>kebab!<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Will</span> <span>people</span> eat more or <span>less</span> <span>foreign</span> <span>food?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>More</span>! <span>Since</span> <span>Germany</span> <span>continues</span> to be one of the <span>most</span> <span>desirable</span> <span>migration</span> <span>destinations</span> in the <span>world</span>, <span>Iâ€™m</span> sure that even more <span>foreign</span> <span>cuisines</span> will be <span>introduced</span> into our <span>country</span>. <span>Moreover</span>, I think that the <span>traditional</span> <span>German</span> <span>food</span> may <span>become</span> a <span>fusion</span> with other <span>popular</span> <span>cuisines</span> here. I <span>really</span> look <span>forward</span> to this! I think that <span>multi-cultural</span> <span>foods</span> <span>bring</span> more <span>culture</span> and <span>richness</span> <span>(diversity)</span> to a <span>place.<br/>

ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>ever</span> get <span>bored?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Of</span> <span>course</span>! But <span>recently</span> I have <span>been</span> so <span>lost</span> in my <span>medical</span> school that I haven't <span>really</span> had time to feel <span>bored</span>. <span>Since</span> I work and <span>study</span> from sun up to sun <span>down</span> <span>(all</span> <span>day)</span>, I <span>embrace</span> my <span>downtime</span> much more than I did when I was <span>younger</span>. <span>Nowadays</span> I <span>really</span> enjoy <span>having</span> time to <span>unwind</span> <span>(relax</span> <span>after</span> a long <span>day)</span> <span>doing</span> <span>mindless</span> <span>activities</span>, such as <span>watching</span> <span>TV</span> or <span>reading</span> a book.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What <span>kinds</span> of <span>things</span> are <span>boring</span> to <span>you?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Museums</span> and <span>people</span> who talk too much. <span>Iâ€™ve</span> <span>never</span> <span>been</span> a big fan of <span>museums</span> for some <span>reason</span>. I get <span>extremely</span> <span>bored</span> when <span>everyone</span> is in <span>complete</span> <span>silence</span> <span>observing</span> <span>artifacts</span> and <span>reading</span> <span>information</span>. When I <span>travel</span>, I much <span>before</span> to <span>walk</span> <span>around</span> and <span>soak</span> up <span>(absorb)</span> the <span>local</span> <span>surroundings</span>. <span>On</span> the other <span>hand</span>, I <span>cannot</span> <span>stand</span> <span>people</span> who talk my ear off <span>(talk</span> too <span>much)</span>! I <span>lose</span> <span>focus</span> and <span>cannot</span> <span>wait</span> to get <span>away</span> from <span>them!<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ What will do when you feel <span>bored?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I always <span>call</span> my mom! We have an <span>extremely</span> <span>close</span> <span>relationship</span>, so I know she is always just a <span>phone</span> <span>call</span> <span>away</span>. <span>As</span> she is <span>also</span> in the <span>medical</span> <span>field</span> and <span>shares</span> many <span>similar</span> <span>interests</span> with me, we always have <span>endless</span> <span>things</span> to talk about. <span>Moreover</span>, we <span>both</span> enjoy <span>gossiping!<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ When you were <span>young</span>, what would you do if you <span>felt</span> <span>bored?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ When I was <span>young</span>, I would always <span>venture</span> <span>(explore)</span> <span>outside</span> when I was <span>stuck</span> in the <span>house</span> all day. It always <span>kept</span> me <span>entertained</span> to go <span>outside</span> and <span>people</span> <span>watch</span> <span>(sit</span> <span>outside</span> and <span>observe</span> <span>people)</span>. <span>Moreover</span>, there was a <span>small</span> <span>pond</span> and <span>park</span> <span>near</span> my <span>house</span>, so I would <span>often</span> go there to play at the <span>playground</span>. The <span>swings</span> were always my <span>first</span> <span>choice.<br/>

ðŸŽ§ Do you use <span>maps?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Well</span>, I <span>tend</span> to <span>(I</span> <span>usually)</span> have a <span>good</span> <span>sense</span> of <span>direction</span>, so I <span>prefer</span> to use them <span>only</span> when there is <span>no</span> other <span>option</span>. <span>Iâ€™d</span> <span>rather</span> get <span>directions</span> from <span>someone</span> <span>using</span> <span>landmarks</span>, as I have a <span>photographic</span> <span>memory</span> <span>(when</span> you can <span>easily</span> <span>remember</span> <span>images</span> <span>rather</span> than <span>words)</span>. <span>However</span>, when I find <span>myself</span> <span>completely</span> <span>lost</span>, <span>especially</span> in a <span>foreign</span> <span>place</span>, I will <span>resort</span> to <span>(do</span> as a <span>last</span> <span>option)</span> <span>tourist</span> <span>maps</span> or <span>google</span> <span>maps</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ How <span>often</span> do you use <span>them?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I would say a few <span>times</span> a <span>week</span>. <span>Since</span> I <span>donâ€™t</span> usually go <span>outside</span> of my <span>daily</span> <span>routine</span>, I have <span>no</span> <span>reason</span> to use a map. When I get on my <span>bicycle</span> <span>every</span> day, I know <span>every</span> <span>niche</span> <span>(every</span> <span>small</span> <span>detail)</span> of my <span>city</span>. <span>If</span> I find <span>myself</span> <span>lost</span>, you can always <span>rely</span> on a <span>stranger</span> to <span>help</span> in my <span>small</span> <span>town</span>. <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ What <span>kind</span> of <span>maps</span> do you use? Why is <span>that?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ For some <span>reason</span> <span>paper</span> <span>maps</span> just <span>donâ€™t</span> <span>seem</span> to <span>click</span> <span>(make</span> <span>sense)</span> in my <span>mind</span>. <span>Because</span> of this, I <span>prefer</span> <span>google</span> <span>maps</span> <span>since</span> they give me <span>verbal</span> <span>instructions</span>. I find this a lot <span>easier</span> to <span>follow</span>, as <span>well</span> as much <span>safer</span> <span>especially</span> when <span>Iâ€™m</span> <span>driving</span>. <span>Furthermore</span>, the <span>estimated</span> time and <span>walking</span>, <span>biking</span>, or <span>driving</span> <span>option</span> is <span>super</span> <span>helpful</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ How long have you <span>been</span> <span>using</span> <span>them?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Iâ€™ve</span> <span>been</span> <span>using</span> <span>online</span> <span>maps</span> for the <span>past</span> few <span>years</span>, and <span>well</span>, <span>paper</span> <span>maps</span> for my <span>entire</span> life. I <span>followed</span> my <span>first</span> <span>paper</span> map <span>while</span> <span>driving</span> when I was <span>16</span>. I got so <span>lost</span> and <span>ended</span> up <span>calling</span> my <span>father</span> in <span>tears</span> <span>(crying)</span>! <span>Since</span> <span>online</span> <span>maps</span> and <span>GPS</span>, it has <span>become</span> much <span>easier</span> to get <span>around</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Did you use <span>paper</span> <span>maps</span> <span>before?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Oh</span>, I can <span>remember</span> <span>those</span> <span>days</span> <span>(an</span> <span>expression</span> when <span>talking</span> <span>fondly</span> about the <span>past)</span>! The <span>glove</span> <span>box(the</span> <span>place</span> in <span>front</span> of your <span>carseat</span> to <span>store</span> <span>things)</span> in my car was <span>full</span> of <span>maps</span> and my <span>father</span> used to <span>draw</span> them for me when I was new to the <span>road</span>. <span>Furthermore</span>, even <span>nowadays</span> when I <span>travel</span>, I <span>often</span> <span>stop</span> by the <span>tourist</span> <span>information</span> <span>desk</span> and get a <span>free</span> <span>map</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Have you <span>ever</span> <span>asked</span> <span>somebody/passer-by</span> for <span>directions?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I <span>believe</span> that <span>people</span> will <span>help</span> you in <span>most</span> <span>cases</span>, so I <span>certainly</span> have. I know some <span>people</span> feel shy or <span>maybe</span> too <span>proud</span> to ask for <span>help</span>, but <span>Iâ€™m</span> not one of <span>these</span>. <span>Although</span> <span>Iâ€™ve</span> <span>been</span> <span>rejected</span> a few <span>times</span>, more <span>times</span> than not <span>people</span> have <span>gone</span> out of <span>their</span> way <span>(put</span> in a lot of <span>effort</span> to <span>help</span> <span>you)</span> to give me <span>detailed</span> <span>directions</span> with <span>landmarks</span> <span>included</span> to my <span>destination</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What <span>type</span> of <span>maps</span> do <span>people</span> use the <span>most</span> <span>nowadays</span>? <span>Why?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Google</span> <span>maps</span> or other <span>online</span> <span>maps/GPS</span> have <span>completely</span> <span>taken</span> over <span>(became</span> <span>popular)</span>. <span>Nowadays</span>, you <span>donâ€™t</span> even need to know where <span>youâ€™re</span> <span>going</span>. <span>Since</span> we have <span>these</span> <span>modern</span> day <span>conveniences</span>, <span>less</span> and <span>less</span> <span>people</span> are <span>going</span> <span>through</span> the <span>hassle</span> <span>(inconvenience)</span> of <span>reading</span> a <span>paper</span> map. <span>Furthermore</span>, <span>since</span> <span>GPS</span> and <span>online</span> <span>maps</span> are so <span>popular</span>, <span>perhaps</span> <span>people</span> are <span>losing</span> the <span>skill</span> to <span>read</span> and <span>follow</span> a <span>map.<br/>

ðŸŽ§ There were a few <span>teachers</span> that I was <span>particularly</span> <span>fond</span> of. <span>Iâ€™ll</span> <span>tell</span> you about my high school <span>PE</span> <span>teacher</span>, <span>Mrs</span>. <span>Burrier</span>. <span>Since</span> she <span>knew</span> I was <span>painfully</span> shy and <span>especially</span> <span>clumsy</span> <span>(can</span> <span>easily</span> <span>trip</span> or <span>fall)</span> when it <span>comes</span> to gym <span>class</span>, she <span>allowed</span> me to do the <span>dance</span> <span>routine</span> that she <span>assigned</span> to us in a <span>private</span> <span>room</span> <span>only</span> in <span>front</span> of her to <span>save</span> me from <span>embarrassment</span>. I so <span>appreciated</span> <span>it!<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Do you still <span>keep</span> in <span>touch</span> with your <span>teacher?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Iâ€™ve</span> <span>lost</span> <span>contact</span> with all <span>elementary</span> and <span>middle</span> school <span>teachers</span>, but I <span>keep</span> in <span>touch</span> with a <span>couple</span> <span>university</span> <span>professors</span>. <span>As</span> <span>uni</span> <span>professors</span> are <span>allowed</span> to have more of a <span>relationship</span> with <span>students</span>, it was <span>easier</span> to get to know them. My <span>Spanish</span> <span>professor</span> and I <span>message</span> back and <span>forth</span> <span>every</span> <span>year</span> to <span>catch</span> up.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>want</span> to be a <span>teacher?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>As</span> <span>Iâ€™m</span> not a <span>patient</span> <span>person</span>, I <span>donâ€™t</span> think <span>teaching</span> is for me. <span>Furthermore</span>, I <span>dread</span> <span>(donâ€™t</span> look <span>forward</span> <span>to)</span> the <span>thought</span> of <span>standing</span> in <span>front</span> of the <span>classroom</span> <span>trying</span> to get the <span>classâ€™s</span> <span>attention</span> <span>while</span> the <span>children</span> <span>fool</span> <span>around</span> <span>(play)</span>. I think it <span>takes</span> a <span>special</span> <span>person</span> to be a <span>teacher</span>, and <span>unfortunately</span> I <span>donâ€™t</span> <span>meet</span> the <span>criteria!<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>remember</span> your <span>fav</span> <span>teach</span> from <span>primary</span> <span>school?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Of</span> <span>course</span>! <span>Iâ€™ll</span> <span>tell</span> you about my <span>second</span> <span>grade</span> <span>teacher</span>, <span>Ms</span>. <span>Puleo</span>. She was always <span>kind</span>, <span>encouraging</span>, and <span>incredibly</span> <span>patient</span>, even with us little <span>rascals</span> <span>(slang</span> for <span>kids)</span>. I always <span>felt</span> a <span>sense</span> of <span>warmth</span> in her <span>classroom</span>, which the <span>students</span> <span>responded</span> <span>well</span> to. The <span>world</span> <span>needs</span> more <span>teachers</span> like her.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Did you <span>pretend</span> to be a <span>teacher</span> in the <span>childhood?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Oh</span> <span>yes</span>! I <span>remember</span> <span>playing</span> <span>teacher</span> with a <span>small</span> <span>chalkboard</span> my <span>friend</span> had at her <span>house</span>. I used to think it was so <span>entertaining</span> to be the <span>teacher</span> and give the <span>class</span> <span>assignments</span> to <span>do;</span> I usually <span>focused</span> on <span>Math</span> and Art. I <span>loved</span> <span>pretending</span> to give <span>orders!<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ What <span>qualities</span> should a <span>good</span> <span>teacher</span> <span>have?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Firstly</span>, I think a <span>teacher</span> <span>needs</span> to be <span>patient</span>. <span>Secondly</span>, I think the <span>teacher</span> <span>must</span> be <span>kind</span> and <span>encouraging</span>, which <span>creates</span> a <span>warm</span>, <span>open</span> <span>learning</span> <span>environment</span>. I <span>also</span> think they should have <span>interpersonal</span> <span>skills</span> to be <span>able</span> to <span>understand</span> the <span>needs</span> of all <span>different</span> <span>students</span>. There are <span>different</span> <span>kinds</span> of <span>teachers</span>, but I would use this as <span>rule</span> of <span>thumb</span> <span>(a</span> <span>general</span> <span>rule).<br/></span>
