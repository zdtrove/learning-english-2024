ðŸŽ§ Is money <span>important</span> to <span>you?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>So-so</span>. To be <span>honest</span>, money can help your life. <span>As</span> I know I'm a person who <span>likes</span> <span>traveling</span> <span>abroad</span>, I know I <span>must</span> have a <span>high-paying</span> job to be able to <span>attain</span> this <span>lifestyle</span>. When I have this <span>freedom</span> to have new <span>experiences</span>, I feel a lot <span>happier</span>. So, because of this I'd say money <span>matters</span> to me.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ How do you <span>save</span> <span>money?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I think it's always <span>important</span> to have a <span>certain</span> <span>number</span> in <span>mind</span>. I think of a <span>goal</span> <span>amount</span> to <span>save</span> each <span>month</span> and <span>pretend</span> as if I don't have it. This has been a <span>huge</span> <span>success</span> for me. With these <span>savings</span>, I've been able to take my <span>dream</span> <span>vacations</span> and buy nice <span>gifts</span> for my <span>family</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Did you <span>save</span> money when you were <span>young?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>As</span> I've always <span>dreamt</span> of <span>traveling</span> the <span>world</span>, I used to <span>save</span> money in a <span>piggybank</span>! <span>Although</span> these <span>savings</span> never <span>amounted</span> to anything <span>substantial</span>, maybe just some <span>movie</span> <span>tickets</span> or <span>candy</span>, I'm glad I did it as a way to <span>teach</span> myself to <span>save</span>. I'll never <span>forget</span> how sad I <span>felt</span> when we <span>broke</span> the <span>piggy-bank!<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Why do people <span>save</span> <span>money?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Various</span> <span>reasons</span>! I think the <span>main</span> <span>reasons</span> are to have a <span>safety</span> <span>blanket</span> in case <span>emergencies</span> or <span>unexpected</span> <span>costs</span> <span>arise</span>, such as a <span>flat</span> <span>tire</span> or a <span>broken</span> hot water <span>heater</span>, or to <span>save</span> for a <span>vacation</span> or something <span>specific</span> that they would like to buy. <span>Moreover</span>, many <span>parents</span> are <span>focused</span> on <span>saving</span> for their <span>children's</span> <span>schooling</span> and <span>college</span> later on.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Have you ever <span>given</span> money to the <span>children?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Certainly</span>! <span>Although</span> I don't have any <span>children</span> of my own yet, I like to <span>slip</span> a <span>20</span> <span>dollar</span> <span>bill</span> into <span>birthday</span> <span>cards</span> for my young <span>nieces</span> and <span>nephews</span>. <span>Furthermore</span>, when I've <span>traveled</span>, I often buy things from <span>children</span> <span>selling</span> on the <span>streets.<br/>

ðŸŽ§ Have you ever <span>tried</span> <span>foreign</span> <span>food?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Of course! Since <span>Germany</span> <span>welcomes</span> many <span>immigrants</span> and <span>refugees</span>, we <span>embrace</span> a <span>multi-cultural</span> <span>cuisine</span>. Since there are many with <span>Turkish</span> <span>roots</span> living here, we are <span>huge</span> <span>fans</span> of <span>kebab</span>. <span>Moreover</span>, we enjoy many <span>asian</span> <span>cuisines</span>, <span>especially</span> <span>Vietnamese</span>, since there is a <span>large</span> <span>Vietnamese</span> <span>community</span> living here.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you like to try new <span>food?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Absolutely! I think it <span>adds</span> color to our live and <span>tastebuds</span> <span>(part</span> on our <span>tongue</span> that <span>controls</span> <span>taste)</span>. <span>As</span> <span>I'm</span> a big <span>foodie</span>, <span>I'm</span> always <span>open</span> to trying new <span>cuisines</span>. <span>I've</span> never been very <span>fearful</span> <span>nor</span> <span>picky</span> when it comes to trying new <span>foods</span>. Even sometimes the <span>scariest</span> <span>looking</span> <span>dishes</span> <span>I've</span> <span>tried</span> have <span>ended</span> up being <span>delicious</span>, such as <span>sheep</span> <span>head</span> <span>soup</span> in <span>Peru</span> and <span>tarantula</span> in <span>Cambodia</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ How often did you eat <span>foreign</span> food when you were <span>young?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Since my <span>father</span> is of <span>Turkish</span> <span>decent</span> where my <span>mother</span> is <span>German</span>, we have always had a <span>fusion</span> <span>(mixture)</span> of <span>cuisines</span> in my home. <span>Furthermore</span>, my <span>father</span> only <span>eats</span> <span>halal</span> <span>meat</span>, so we would often go <span>Middle</span> <span>Eastern</span> or <span>Indian</span> <span>restaurants</span> to <span>accommodate</span> this. <span>Moreover</span>, my <span>mother</span> has always had a <span>taste</span> for <span>Asian</span> <span>cuisines</span>, so we have always <span>incorporated</span> <span>Vietnamese</span>, <span>Chinese</span>, <span>Thai</span>, <span>etc</span> <span>foods</span> into our <span>eating</span> <span>habits</span> as well.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you like any food from <span>countries</span> near <span>yours?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Certainly</span>! One of the things I like most about living in <span>Europe</span> is that each <span>country</span> has <span>it's</span> own <span>unique</span> <span>cuisine</span>. I really enjoy the <span>waffles</span>, <span>chocolate</span>, and <span>beer</span> from one of our <span>neighbors</span>, <span>Belgium</span>, as well as the one of a kind <span>perogies</span> <span>(a</span> <span>traditional</span> <span>Polish</span> <span>dish)</span> from <span>Poland</span>. All in all, <span>I'd</span> have to say that <span>Mediterranean</span> <span>cuisines</span>, <span>especially</span> <span>Greek</span> and <span>Italian</span>, <span>foods</span> are my <span>favorite</span>. There are few things that <span>compare</span> to <span>those</span> <span>fresh</span> <span>ingredients</span> and <span>delicious</span> <span>olives!<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Do people in your <span>country</span> like <span>foreign</span> <span>food?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>As</span> <span>Germany</span> <span>welcomes</span> many <span>immigrants</span> into our <span>country</span>, I would say yes, since people have always been <span>exposed</span> to different <span>types</span> of food. In my <span>experience</span>, I see that all of the people in my <span>circle</span> <span>embrace</span> <span>(to</span> take <span>advantage</span> <span>of)</span> the <span>unique</span> <span>variety</span> of <span>flavors</span> that we have here in <span>Berlin</span>. To be <span>honest</span>, I don't know <span>anyone</span> who doesn't enjoy a <span>juicy</span> <span>Doner</span> <span>kebab!<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Will</span> people eat more or less <span>foreign</span> <span>food?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>More</span>! Since <span>Germany</span> <span>continues</span> to be one of the most <span>desirable</span> <span>migration</span> <span>destinations</span> in the <span>world</span>, <span>I'm</span> sure that even more <span>foreign</span> <span>cuisines</span> will be <span>introduced</span> into our <span>country</span>. <span>Moreover</span>, I think that the <span>traditional</span> <span>German</span> food may become a <span>fusion</span> with other <span>popular</span> <span>cuisines</span> here. I really look <span>forward</span> to this! I think that <span>multi-cultural</span> <span>foods</span> <span>bring</span> more <span>culture</span> and <span>richness</span> <span>(diversity)</span> to a <span>place.<br/>

ðŸŽ§ Do you ever get <span>bored?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Of course! But <span>recently</span> I have been so <span>lost</span> in my <span>medical</span> school that I haven't really had time to feel <span>bored</span>. Since I work and <span>study</span> from sun up to sun down <span>(all</span> <span>day)</span>, I <span>embrace</span> my <span>downtime</span> much more than I did when I was <span>younger</span>. <span>Nowadays</span> I really enjoy having time to <span>unwind</span> <span>(relax</span> after a long <span>day)</span> doing <span>mindless</span> <span>activities</span>, such as <span>watching</span> <span>TV</span> or <span>reading</span> a book.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What <span>kinds</span> of things are <span>boring</span> to <span>you?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Museums</span> and people who talk too much. <span>I've</span> never been a big fan of <span>museums</span> for some <span>reason</span>. I get <span>extremely</span> <span>bored</span> when everyone is in <span>complete</span> <span>silence</span> <span>observing</span> <span>artifacts</span> and <span>reading</span> <span>information</span>. When I travel, I much before to <span>walk</span> around and <span>soak</span> up <span>(absorb)</span> the <span>local</span> <span>surroundings</span>. On the other <span>hand</span>, I <span>cannot</span> <span>stand</span> people who talk my ear off <span>(talk</span> too <span>much)</span>! I <span>lose</span> <span>focus</span> and <span>cannot</span> wait to get away from <span>them!<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ What will do when you feel <span>bored?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I always <span>call</span> my mom! We have an <span>extremely</span> <span>close</span> <span>relationship</span>, so I know she is always just a phone <span>call</span> away. <span>As</span> she is also in the <span>medical</span> <span>field</span> and <span>shares</span> many <span>similar</span> <span>interests</span> with me, we always have <span>endless</span> things to talk about. <span>Moreover</span>, we both enjoy <span>gossiping!<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ When you were young, what would you do if you <span>felt</span> <span>bored?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ When I was young, I would always <span>venture</span> <span>(explore)</span> outside when I was <span>stuck</span> in the house all day. It always <span>kept</span> me <span>entertained</span> to go outside and people <span>watch</span> <span>(sit</span> outside and <span>observe</span> <span>people)</span>. <span>Moreover</span>, there was a small <span>pond</span> and <span>park</span> near my house, so I would often go there to play at the <span>playground</span>. The <span>swings</span> were always my first <span>choice.<br/>

ðŸŽ§ Do you use <span>maps?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, I <span>tend</span> to <span>(I</span> <span>usually)</span> have a good <span>sense</span> of <span>direction</span>, so I <span>prefer</span> to use them only when there is no other <span>option</span>. <span>I'd</span> <span>rather</span> get <span>directions</span> from <span>someone</span> <span>using</span> <span>landmarks</span>, as I have a <span>photographic</span> <span>memory</span> <span>(when</span> you can <span>easily</span> <span>remember</span> <span>images</span> <span>rather</span> than <span>words)</span>. <span>However</span>, when I find myself <span>completely</span> <span>lost</span>, <span>especially</span> in a <span>foreign</span> place, I will <span>resort</span> to <span>(do</span> as a last <span>option)</span> <span>tourist</span> <span>maps</span> or <span>google</span> <span>maps</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ How often do you use <span>them?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I would say a few <span>times</span> a week. Since I <span>don't</span> usually go outside of my <span>daily</span> <span>routine</span>, I have no <span>reason</span> to use a map. When I get on my <span>bicycle</span> every day, I know every <span>niche</span> <span>(every</span> small <span>detail)</span> of my <span>city</span>. If I find myself <span>lost</span>, you can always <span>rely</span> on a <span>stranger</span> to help in my small <span>town</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ What kind of <span>maps</span> do you use? Why is <span>that?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ For some <span>reason</span> <span>paper</span> <span>maps</span> just <span>don't</span> <span>seem</span> to <span>click</span> <span>(make</span> <span>sense)</span> in my <span>mind</span>. Because of this, I <span>prefer</span> <span>google</span> <span>maps</span> since they give me <span>verbal</span> <span>instructions</span>. I find this a lot <span>easier</span> to <span>follow</span>, as well as much <span>safer</span> <span>especially</span> when <span>I'm</span> driving. <span>Furthermore</span>, the <span>estimated</span> time and <span>walking</span>, <span>biking</span>, or driving <span>option</span> is <span>super</span> <span>helpful</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ How long have you been <span>using</span> <span>them?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>I've</span> been <span>using</span> <span>online</span> <span>maps</span> for the <span>past</span> few years, and well, <span>paper</span> <span>maps</span> for my <span>entire</span> life. I <span>followed</span> my first <span>paper</span> map <span>while</span> driving when I was <span>16</span>. I got so <span>lost</span> and <span>ended</span> up <span>calling</span> my <span>father</span> in <span>tears</span> <span>(crying)</span>! Since <span>online</span> <span>maps</span> and <span>GPS</span>, it has become much <span>easier</span> to get around.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Did you use <span>paper</span> <span>maps</span> <span>before?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Oh</span>, I can <span>remember</span> <span>those</span> <span>days</span> <span>(an</span> <span>expression</span> when talking <span>fondly</span> about the <span>past)</span>! The <span>glove</span> <span>box(the</span> place in <span>front</span> of your <span>carseat</span> to <span>store</span> <span>things)</span> in my car was full of <span>maps</span> and my <span>father</span> used to <span>draw</span> them for me when I was new to the <span>road</span>. <span>Furthermore</span>, even <span>nowadays</span> when I travel, I often <span>stop</span> by the <span>tourist</span> <span>information</span> <span>desk</span> and get a free <span>map</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Have you ever <span>asked</span> <span>somebody/passer-by</span> for <span>directions?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I <span>believe</span> that people will help you in most <span>cases</span>, so I <span>certainly</span> have. I know some people feel shy or maybe too <span>proud</span> to ask for help, but <span>I'm</span> not one of these. <span>Although</span> <span>I've</span> been <span>rejected</span> a few <span>times</span>, more <span>times</span> than not people have <span>gone</span> out of their way <span>(put</span> in a lot of <span>effort</span> to help <span>you)</span> to give me <span>detailed</span> <span>directions</span> with <span>landmarks</span> <span>included</span> to my <span>destination</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What <span>type</span> of <span>maps</span> do people use the most <span>nowadays</span>? <span>Why?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Google</span> <span>maps</span> or other <span>online</span> <span>maps/GPS</span> have <span>completely</span> taken over <span>(became</span> <span>popular)</span>. <span>Nowadays</span>, you <span>don't</span> even need to know where <span>you're</span> going. Since we have these <span>modern</span> day <span>conveniences</span>, less and less people are going through the <span>hassle</span> <span>(inconvenience)</span> of <span>reading</span> a <span>paper</span> map. <span>Furthermore</span>, since <span>GPS</span> and <span>online</span> <span>maps</span> are so <span>popular</span>, <span>perhaps</span> people are <span>losing</span> the <span>skill</span> to read and <span>follow</span> a <span>map.<br/>

ðŸŽ§ Do you like any <span>teachers</span> of <span>yours?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ There were a few <span>teachers</span> that I was <span>particularly</span> <span>fond</span> of. <span>I'll</span> tell you about my high school <span>PE</span> <span>teacher</span>, <span>Mrs</span>. <span>Burrier</span>. Since she <span>knew</span> I was <span>painfully</span> shy and <span>especially</span> <span>clumsy</span> <span>(can</span> <span>easily</span> <span>trip</span> or <span>fall)</span> when it comes to gym class, she <span>allowed</span> me to do the <span>dance</span> <span>routine</span> that she <span>assigned</span> to us in a <span>private</span> <span>room</span> only in <span>front</span> of her to <span>save</span> me from <span>embarrassment</span>. I so <span>appreciated</span> <span>it!<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Do you still keep in <span>touch</span> with your <span>teacher?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>I've</span> <span>lost</span> <span>contact</span> with all <span>elementary</span> and <span>middle</span> school <span>teachers</span>, but I keep in <span>touch</span> with a <span>couple</span> <span>university</span> <span>professors</span>. <span>As</span> <span>uni</span> <span>professors</span> are <span>allowed</span> to have more of a <span>relationship</span> with <span>students</span>, it was <span>easier</span> to get to know them. My <span>Spanish</span> <span>professor</span> and I <span>message</span> back and <span>forth</span> every year to catch up.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you want to be a <span>teacher?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>As</span> <span>I'm</span> not a <span>patient</span> person, I <span>don't</span> think <span>teaching</span> is for me. <span>Furthermore</span>, I <span>dread</span> <span>(don't</span> look <span>forward</span> <span>to)</span> the thought of <span>standing</span> in <span>front</span> of the <span>classroom</span> trying to get the <span>class's</span> <span>attention</span> <span>while</span> the <span>children</span> <span>fool</span> around <span>(play)</span>. I think it takes a special person to be a <span>teacher</span>, and <span>unfortunately</span> I <span>don't</span> <span>meet</span> the <span>criteria!<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>remember</span> your <span>fav</span> <span>teach</span> from <span>primary</span> <span>school?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Of course! <span>I'll</span> tell you about my <span>second</span> <span>grade</span> <span>teacher</span>, <span>Ms</span>. <span>Puleo</span>. She was always kind, <span>encouraging</span>, and <span>incredibly</span> <span>patient</span>, even with us little <span>rascals</span> <span>(slang</span> for <span>kids)</span>. I always <span>felt</span> a <span>sense</span> of <span>warmth</span> in her <span>classroom</span>, which the <span>students</span> <span>responded</span> well to. The <span>world</span> needs more <span>teachers</span> like her.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Did you <span>pretend</span> to be a <span>teacher</span> in the <span>childhood?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Oh</span> yes! I <span>remember</span> playing <span>teacher</span> with a small <span>chalkboard</span> my friend had at her house. I used to think it was so <span>entertaining</span> to be the <span>teacher</span> and give the class <span>assignments</span> to <span>do;</span> I usually <span>focused</span> on <span>Math</span> and Art. I loved <span>pretending</span> to give <span>orders!<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ What <span>qualities</span> should a good <span>teacher</span> <span>have?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Firstly</span>, I think a <span>teacher</span> needs to be <span>patient</span>. <span>Secondly</span>, I think the <span>teacher</span> <span>must</span> be kind and <span>encouraging</span>, which <span>creates</span> a <span>warm</span>, <span>open</span> <span>learning</span> <span>environment</span>. I also think they should have <span>interpersonal</span> <span>skills</span> to be able to <span>understand</span> the needs of all different <span>students</span>. There are different <span>kinds</span> of <span>teachers</span>, but I would use this as <span>rule</span> of <span>thumb</span> <span>(a</span> <span>general</span> <span>rule)</span>.<br/>
