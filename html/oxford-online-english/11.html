🎧 Sometimes I will go for a <span>walk</span> around <span>Hoàn</span> <span>Kiếm</span> <span>Lake</span>, What's up, everyone?<br/>
🎧 <span>Slow</span> and <span>Clear</span> <span>của</span> What's Up English My name is <span>Carter</span>.<br/>
🎧 And today you're going to learn how to talk about your <span>daily</span> <span>routine</span>.<br/>
🎧 Not only that, but you're going to learn many different <span>activities</span> and fun things that people do not even just fun things, but things that people do in <span>Vietnam</span>.<br/>
🎧 So this will be really <span>useful</span> for you to make <span>plans</span> with <span>someone</span> for you to talk about what you did on the weekend for you to <span>simply</span> make small talk with other people.<br/>
🎧 So first, I'm going to tell you <span>guys</span> about my <span>daily</span> <span>routine</span> in <span>Hanoi</span>.<br/>
🎧 And <span>spoiler</span> <span>alert</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's really <span>nothing</span> too special.<br/>
🎧 It's very <span>normal</span>, I would say.<br/>
🎧 I <span>wake</span> up if it's in the <span>winter</span>, then it can be <span>pretty</span> <span>hard</span> to get out of bed because your bed is so <span>warm</span>, outside is so <span>cold</span>.<br/>
🎧 Even in <span>summer</span> in <span>Vietnam</span>, it can be <span>hard</span> to get out of your room because you have the air <span>conditioner</span> on and it <span>feels</span> so <span>cool</span> and outside of your room is really hot.<br/>
🎧 But yeah, so I <span>wake</span> up and then I usually go outside and get some <span>sunlight</span> into my <span>eyes</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm not the best <span>sleeper</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have <span>trouble</span> <span>sleeping</span>.<br/>
🎧 So I <span>researched</span> online to go outside, get sun in your <span>eyes</span> in the morning, and also try to <span>raise</span> your <span>body</span> <span>temperature</span> by doing some <span>exercise</span>.<br/>
🎧 So sometimes I will <span>walk</span> to the <span>rooftop</span> of my <span>apartment</span> <span>building</span> through the <span>stairs</span> from a very low <span>floor</span> to the top <span>floor</span> and that is my <span>exercise</span>.<br/>
🎧 And then I get the <span>sunlight</span> on the <span>rooftop</span>.<br/>
🎧 So after I <span>walk</span> from my <span>floor</span> to the <span>rooftop</span>, I'm usually feeling <span>pretty</span>, <span>pretty</span> hot from the <span>exercise</span>.<br/>
🎧 And then I <span>stand</span> on the <span>rooftop</span> for about <span>five</span> or <span>10</span> <span>minutes</span>, get the <span>sunlight</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then I go back down.<br/>
🎧 I <span>brew</span> a <span>coffee</span> with the <span>Vietnamese</span> <span>phin</span>.<br/>
🎧 In English, maybe it's just called the <span>Vietnamese</span> <span>coffee</span> <span>filter</span>, or we call it <span>Vietnamese</span> <span>drip</span> <span>coffee</span>.<br/>
🎧 So I <span>brew</span> one of those with a little bit of <span>condensed</span> <span>milk</span> and a <span>pinch</span> of <span>salt</span>.<br/>
🎧 And then while that's <span>brewing</span>, I will maybe go on my <span>computer</span>, plan my day, check the <span>tasks</span> that I have to do.<br/>
🎧 Usually some <span>form</span> of work, because <span>early</span> in the morning I'm still in a <span>relaxed</span> <span>mood</span>, and in the morning, I feel like it's <span>easier</span> to focus.<br/>
🎧 So when my <span>coffee's</span> ready, I drink my <span>coffee</span> and then sometimes I will do a <span>quick</span> <span>workout</span>.<br/>
🎧 Like before it was only a short, small <span>workout</span> and then after I drink the <span>coffee</span>, I'm like, <span>Ooh</span>, I'm <span>pumped</span> up.<br/>
🎧 So then maybe I'll do a <span>workout</span>.<br/>
🎧 And then after that, often I will eat and then go to work.<br/>
🎧 So what I eat in the morning is <span>pretty</span> much only two things.<br/>
🎧 It is either <span>phở</span> or <span>oatmeal</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>depends</span> on what I feel like, but to be <span>honest</span>, I feel like I could eat <span>phở</span> every day and not get <span>tired</span> of it.<br/>
🎧 Well, I do eat <span>phở</span> every day and I don't really feel <span>tired</span> of it, so.<br/>
🎧 I don't know, there's something <span>magic</span> about that <span>dish</span>, to be <span>honest</span>.<br/>
🎧 Because you can eat it so often and you don't get <span>tired</span> of it.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>crazy</span>.<br/>
🎧 So yeah, I eat, I go to work.<br/>
🎧 my <span>job</span> is at a <span>middle</span> school.<br/>
🎧 That's all I will say.<br/>
🎧 After work, I usually come <span>straight</span> home because at that time it's <span>rush</span> <span>hour</span>.<br/>
🎧 And <span>rush</span> <span>hour</span> <span>guys</span> is usually between like <span>five</span> and six.<br/>
🎧 It can go a little bit <span>longer</span>, <span>6</span>:<br/>
🎧 <span>30</span>, but that's when the <span>traffic</span> is the <span>worst</span>.<br/>
🎧 And then I drive home.<br/>
🎧 By the way, we can call that a <span>"commute"</span>.<br/>
🎧 So my <span>commute</span> from home to work is not too <span>far</span>.<br/>
🎧 So then I go home, <span>relax</span> a little bit, and then, for dinner, I will often order food or I will go out for dinner with a friend.<br/>
🎧 I don't often <span>cook</span> at home, to be <span>honest</span>, I should <span>cook</span> at home more, but it just <span>feels</span> so much more <span>convenient</span> and still <span>cheap</span> to eat out or order food.<br/>
🎧 then after dinner I usually work on my <span>YouTube</span> <span>channel</span> until about <span>10</span> or <span>11</span> <span>o'clock</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then I just start to <span>relax</span> and get ready for bed.<br/>
🎧 And uh.<br/>
🎧 Oh!<br/>
🎧 I <span>forgot</span> one important <span>detail</span> of my <span>routine</span> At the end of the <span>night</span>, I always play with my two <span>cats</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Tí</span> and <span>Tèo</span> I will show you <span>guys</span> these <span>cats</span> on a <span>livestream</span> but yeah, they are <span>brothers</span>.<br/>
🎧 I love them so much.<br/>
🎧 they're <span>awesome</span> <span>cats</span> and they really help me <span>relax</span> at the end of the day.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, they're really <span>awesome</span>.<br/>
🎧 So that is my <span>daily</span> <span>routine</span> on a <span>normal</span> <span>weekday</span>, <span>nothing</span> too <span>interesting</span>, right?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>nothing</span> special.<br/>
🎧 I think many people just, you know, most people live lives like that.<br/>
🎧 We get up, we do this thing, we go to work, come home, we do that thing, and the fun things we do are in between all of the things we must do, right?<br/>
🎧 So on the weekend, sometimes I will, So on the weekend, sometimes I will, go for a <span>walk</span> around <span>Hoàn</span> <span>Kiếm</span> <span>Lake</span>, sometimes I will play <span>badminton</span> with a friend, go out to a <span>cafe</span> with a friend, maybe go to a nice <span>restaurant</span> in <span>Westlake</span> because <span>Westlake</span> has a lot of <span>international</span> <span>restaurants</span> and I really like <span>international</span> food like <span>Mexican</span> food or <span>Indian</span> food.<br/>
🎧 So now I'm going to talk about <span>activities</span> that I see people doing a lot in <span>Hanoi</span> and these things.<br/>
🎧 If you live in <span>Ho</span> <span>Chi</span> <span>Minh</span> <span>City</span>, if you live in some other big <span>city</span> or even in the <span>countryside</span>, you can use, you can use these things to talk about what you do So for example, in <span>Hanoi</span>, you can go to the <span>night</span> <span>market</span>, you can <span>wander</span> around there, you don't you don't <span>necessarily</span> need to buy anything, but you can just take a look at what people are <span>selling</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can go to a <span>cafe</span> and just <span>hang</span> out.<br/>
🎧 So one of the great things about <span>cafes</span> is that you don't really need any <span>reason</span> to go to a <span>cafe</span>, right?<br/>
🎧 You can go there to work or you can just call your friend.<br/>
🎧 You want to <span>hang</span> out?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 Okay, let's go to a <span>cafe</span> and then just sit at the <span>cafe</span> and enjoy a <span>coffee</span>, maybe a tea.<br/>
🎧 Many people <span>gather</span> at <span>cafes</span> and they don't even, like, talk to each other.<br/>
🎧 Right?<br/>
🎧 They just sit there on their <span>phones</span>, but at <span>least</span> they're still together.<br/>
🎧 So they enjoy just being next to one another.<br/>
🎧 What else?<br/>
🎧 I see many young <span>kids</span> <span>rollerblading</span>.<br/>
🎧 Maybe some of you call this <span>roller</span> <span>skating</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think it's the same thing.<br/>
🎧 But in <span>Canada</span> we call it <span>rollerblading</span>.<br/>
🎧 And they do this in the <span>parks</span> and they go really <span>fast</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's actually really fun if you try it.<br/>
🎧 I <span>notice</span> in <span>Vietnam</span>, <span>pretty</span> <span>pretty</span> much only <span>kids</span> do the <span>rollerblading</span>.<br/>
🎧 But, if you're an <span>adult</span> and you want to try it, try it.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>seriously</span>, it's a lot of fun and it's a really good <span>workout</span>.<br/>
🎧 When <span>tourists</span> come to <span>Hanoi</span>, they can go or any <span>city</span>, When I say <span>Hanoi</span>, I mean <span>anywhere</span>, <span>basically</span>, in <span>Vietnam</span>.<br/>
🎧 They can go on a food <span>tour</span>, they can visit the <span>temple</span> of <span>literature</span>, or they can go to the <span>prison</span> <span>museum</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's definitely a few things to do.<br/>
🎧 Other things I often see people doing are <span>sitting</span> on the <span>sidewalk</span> and <span>eating</span> <span>street</span> food.<br/>
🎧 To be <span>honest</span>, <span>personally</span>, I'm not a <span>huge</span> fan of <span>street</span> food because most of it is like <span>processed</span> and <span>fried</span> and just not really <span>healthy</span> for you.<br/>
🎧 Like those, <span>um</span>, those <span>meat</span> <span>sticks</span>.<br/>
🎧 Not, not, not, <span>"thịt</span> <span>xiên"</span>, And, but the <span>ones</span> where it's like a <span>stick</span> and you put the different <span>meats</span> on it, like the <span>balls</span>, the <span>pink</span> <span>balls</span>, the <span>yellow</span> <span>balls</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't even know what those are called, but I see they're very <span>common</span>, So yeah, you could <span>chill</span> on the <span>street</span> and eat that <span>street</span> food.<br/>
🎧 And so those are a lot of things you could use to make <span>plans</span> to talk about what you did on the weekend for different <span>sports</span>.<br/>
🎧 We can say, you know, play <span>football</span>, play <span>badminton</span>, play <span>table</span> <span>tennis</span>.<br/>
🎧 We don't use hit, right?<br/>
🎧 We don't say hit <span>tennis</span>.<br/>
🎧 when we're talking about <span>walks</span>, you can say go for a <span>walk</span>, have a <span>walk</span>, go for a <span>stroll</span>, go for a run, go for a <span>jog</span>.<br/>
🎧 That all sounds very <span>natural</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can say go <span>jogging</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, for example.<br/>
🎧 Oh, <span>Tomorrow</span> I'm going to go for a <span>jog</span>.<br/>
🎧 Or <span>tomorrow</span> I'm going to go <span>jogging</span>.<br/>
🎧 Both of them are <span>totally</span> okay.<br/>
🎧 Oh, yeah.<br/>
🎧 And that <span>reminds</span> me some other things you can do.<br/>
🎧 You can go <span>workout</span> at the gym, you can go out for dinner at a <span>restaurant</span>.<br/>
🎧 So there's just so many <span>activities</span> that I'm sure I <span>cannot</span> name them all.<br/>
🎧 But <span>hopefully</span> I've been able to name a lot of them that will be really <span>useful</span> for you <span>guys</span> if there are any <span>activities</span> that I didn't name.<br/>
🎧 Feel free to <span>post</span> it in the <span>comments</span>.<br/>
🎧 tell us like what you do on a <span>regular</span> day.<br/>
🎧 You could practice <span>writing</span>.<br/>
🎧 You know, first I do this, then after that I do this.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes I do this.<br/>
🎧 If it's something, I'll do that right?<br/>
🎧 So, for example, I often go for a <span>walk</span> in the <span>evening</span>, but if it's <span>raining</span>, I'll <span>stay</span> home and read something like that.<br/>
🎧 So, <span>guys</span>, that's it for this <span>podcast</span>.<br/>
🎧 But if you want to check out my live <span>stream</span>, then <span>click</span> this <span>video</span>.<br/>
🎧 This was the first live <span>stream</span> I've ever done.<br/>
🎧 I <span>forgot</span> to <span>post</span> the live <span>chat</span>.<br/>
🎧 So next <span>stream</span> you will be able to see the live <span>chat</span>, but you can <span>expect</span> me to be <span>streaming</span> every <span>Sunday</span> at <span>10</span> <span>a.m</span>.<br/>
