🎧 Hi, I'm <span>Gina</span>. <span>Welcome</span> to <span>Oxford</span> Online English!<br/>
🎧 In this <span>lesson</span>, you can learn how to answer <span>job</span> <span>interview</span> <span>questions</span> in English.<br/>
🎧 Have you ever had a <span>job</span> <span>interview</span> in English?<br/>
🎧 If English is not your first <span>language</span>, <span>answering</span> <span>job</span> <span>interview</span> <span>questions</span> in English can add <span>stress</span> to the <span>experience</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, there are some simple, <span>effective</span> <span>tips</span> you can use to give better <span>answers</span> to <span>job</span> <span>interview</span> <span>questions</span> in <span>clear</span>, <span>natural</span> English.<br/>
🎧 You'll learn about these <span>tips</span> and <span>tricks</span> during this <span>lesson</span>!<br/>
🎧 You'll see <span>eight</span> <span>common</span> <span>job</span> <span>interview</span> <span>questions</span> and <span>four</span> different <span>techniques</span> you can use.<br/>
🎧 You'll see how to answer these <span>common</span> <span>job</span> <span>interview</span> <span>questions</span>, <span>using</span> the <span>techniques</span> we'll show you.<br/>
🎧 Let's start with our <span>eight</span> <span>common</span> <span>job</span> <span>interview</span> <span>questions</span>.<br/>
🎧 Tell me a little about yourself.<br/>
🎧 Where do you see yourself <span>five</span> years from now?<br/>
🎧 What are your <span>strengths/weaknesses</span>?<br/>
🎧 What is your <span>leadership</span> <span>style</span>?<br/>
🎧 Can you tell me about a time when you <span>demonstrated</span> <span>----</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>--></span> For example, can you tell me about a time when you <span>demonstrated</span> <span>strong</span> <span>leadership</span>?<br/>
🎧 Or, can you tell me about a time when you <span>demonstrated</span> <span>excellent</span> <span>customer</span> <span>service</span>?<br/>
🎧 Tell me about a time you <span>dealt</span> with a <span>challenging</span> <span>situation</span> at work.<br/>
🎧 Why do you want this <span>job</span>?<br/>
🎧 Why should we <span>hire</span> you?<br/>
🎧 What does <span>concise</span> mean?<br/>
🎧 It <span>means</span> that you don't <span>waste</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you speak <span>concisely</span>, you get right to the <span>point</span> and don't add anything <span>unnecessary</span> to your answer.<br/>
🎧 Let's look at two <span>questions</span> in this <span>section</span>:<br/>
🎧 Tell me a little about yourself.<br/>
🎧 Where do you see yourself <span>five</span> years from now?<br/>
🎧 These are very <span>common</span> <span>job</span> <span>interview</span> <span>questions</span>, and they're also very open <span>questions</span>.<br/>
🎧 Open <span>questions</span> can be <span>dangerous</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you know why?<br/>
🎧 It's because you might <span>ramble</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ramble</span> <span>means</span> to talk a lot without saying much.<br/>
🎧 This won't give the <span>interviewer</span> a good <span>impression</span>!<br/>
🎧 Let's start by looking at a <span>sample</span> answer to the <span>question</span> tell me a little about yourself.<br/>
🎧 Well, I was <span>born</span> in a small <span>town</span> in <span>northern</span> <span>Italy</span>, where I also went to school.<br/>
🎧 I <span>studied</span> <span>engineering</span> at university and <span>then…<br/></span>
🎧 So, after I <span>graduated…<br/></span>
🎧 I mean, I did a <span>master's</span> <span>degree</span> first, but then I <span>worked</span> for a small <span>firm</span> in my <span>hometown</span> for a few years, which was great fun.<br/>
🎧 After <span>that…<br/></span>
🎧 Okay, we can <span>stop</span> there.<br/>
🎧 Do you think this is a good answer?<br/>
🎧 Why or why not?<br/>
🎧 It's not a very good answer.<br/>
🎧 Why not?<br/>
🎧 There are <span>three</span> things the <span>candidate</span> does which you should try to <span>avoid</span>:<br/>
🎧 One: the <span>candidate</span> <span>includes</span> lots of <span>unnecessary</span> <span>details</span>.<br/>
🎧 Two: he doesn't speak in full <span>sentences</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Three</span>: he doesn't have any <span>clear</span> <span>direction</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you do these things, your answer to this answer will be long and <span>unfocused</span>.<br/>
🎧 What's the <span>solution</span>?<br/>
🎧 You need to be more <span>concise</span>.<br/>
🎧 But how?<br/>
🎧 First, <span>avoid</span> <span>unnecessary</span> <span>details</span>.<br/>
🎧 Don't give your <span>entire</span> work <span>history;</span> the <span>interviewers</span> can get that from your <span>CV</span> if they want it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Secondly</span>, speak in full <span>sentences</span> with a <span>clear</span> <span>beginning</span> and end.<br/>
🎧 This <span>means</span> you need to be thinking ahead while you speak.<br/>
🎧 <span>Thirdly</span>, think about what you want to <span>highlight</span> in your answer, and put it at the <span>beginning</span>.<br/>
🎧 This will give your answer a <span>clear</span> <span>direction</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's look at some <span>examples</span> of this:<br/>
🎧 I've always loved <span>designing</span> and <span>building</span> things, so I <span>suppose</span> it's <span>natural</span> that I <span>became</span> an <span>engineer</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've <span>worked</span> in a <span>variety</span> of <span>roles</span> and <span>companies</span>, which I've <span>learned</span> a lot from, but now I'm ready for a new <span>challenge</span>.<br/>
🎧 What do you think?<br/>
🎧 Better?<br/>
🎧 It's much better.<br/>
🎧 Let's look at the start.<br/>
🎧 <span>Immediately</span>, the <span>candidate</span> <span>identifies</span> a key <span>feature</span> <span>(he</span> <span>loves</span> <span>designing</span> and <span>building</span> <span>things)</span>, and <span>links</span> it to his <span>engineering</span> <span>career</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>candidate's</span> answer is very <span>concise</span>: there are no <span>unnecessary</span> <span>details</span>, and it also has a <span>clear</span> end.<br/>
🎧 What about our second <span>question</span>?<br/>
🎧 Here's one <span>possible</span> answer:<br/>
🎧 There are many things I could be doing.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to have, you know, some <span>sort</span> of <span>progress…<br/></span>
🎧 What I mean is that I don't just want to be doing the same things I'm doing now.<br/>
🎧 I like to be <span>moving</span> forward in my <span>career</span>, for <span>example…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Err…<br/></span>
🎧 I definitely see myself in a better <span>position</span> than I am now.<br/>
🎧 Good answer?<br/>
🎧 Bad answer?<br/>
🎧 Okay, it's not <span>terrible</span>, but it could be much better.<br/>
🎧 The <span>candidate</span> is <span>rambling</span>.<br/>
🎧 She doesn't make her <span>point</span> <span>clear</span>, she doesn't speak in full <span>sentences</span>, and she <span>wastes</span> <span>words</span> on <span>unclear</span> and <span>unnecessary</span> <span>ideas</span>.<br/>
🎧 Here's a better answer:<br/>
🎧 I don't know exactly, but the most important thing is that I <span>continue</span> to learn and <span>grow</span> in my <span>career</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm the kind of person who needs new <span>challenges</span> to <span>stay</span> <span>focused</span>.<br/>
🎧 I might even start my own <span>business</span>, because that's something I've always wanted to do at some <span>point</span> in my life.<br/>
🎧 This is much more <span>concise</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>candidate's</span> answer has a <span>clear</span> <span>beginning</span> and end, and doesn't <span>waste</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, what can you do to make your <span>answers</span> more <span>concise</span>?<br/>
🎧 The best way to <span>practise</span> is to <span>record</span> yourself <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 You could <span>record</span> yourself <span>answering</span> these two <span>questions</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then, listen to yourself.<br/>
🎧 Try to find <span>sentences</span> which you don't <span>finish</span>, or <span>words</span> which don't add anything to your <span>meaning</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then, try again.<br/>
🎧 Keep <span>practising</span> until your answer is <span>clean</span> and <span>focused</span>.<br/>
🎧 What is <span>signposting</span> <span>language<br/></span>
🎧 Next, let's look at another <span>point</span> which will make your <span>answers</span> <span>clearer</span> and more <span>structured</span>: <span>signposting</span> <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Signposting</span> <span>language</span> <span>means</span> <span>words</span> and <span>phrases</span> which show your <span>listener</span> where you're going.<br/>
🎧 For example, the <span>words</span> <span>'for</span> <span>example'</span> are <span>signposting</span> <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I say for example, you know I'm about to give you an example.<br/>
🎧 Simple, right?<br/>
🎧 Yes, but it's also very important.<br/>
🎧 Without <span>signposting</span> <span>language</span>, <span>longer</span> <span>answers</span> can <span>lose</span> focus and be <span>hard</span> to <span>follow</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll see <span>answers</span> to two <span>questions</span> in this <span>section</span>:<br/>
🎧 What are your <span>strengths</span> and <span>weaknesses</span>?<br/>
🎧 What is your <span>leadership</span> <span>style</span>?<br/>
🎧 Let's look at a <span>sample</span> answer to the first <span>question</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm very good at working with other people.<br/>
🎧 In my last <span>job</span>, I always <span>tried</span> to <span>encourage</span> my <span>colleagues</span> and <span>create</span> a good <span>atmosphere</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> I can be a little bit <span>careless</span> sometimes.<br/>
🎧 I'm not the kind of person who <span>focuses</span> on <span>details</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm very <span>calm</span>, and I can keep a <span>cool</span> <span>head</span> in very <span>stressful</span> <span>situations</span>.<br/>
🎧 What do you think?<br/>
🎧 It's not bad, but it could be <span>hard</span> to <span>follow</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>candidate</span> <span>jumps</span> around a lot.<br/>
🎧 <span>Adding</span> <span>signposting</span> <span>language</span> can make a big <span>difference</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's see how. <span>Notice</span> that the <span>content</span> is exactly the same.<br/>
🎧 We haven't <span>changed</span> the <span>candidate's</span> <span>basic</span> <span>ideas</span> at all.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, the answer is now much <span>clearer</span> and <span>easier</span> to <span>follow</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Using</span> <span>signposting</span> <span>language</span> like this can make a big <span>difference</span>!<br/>
🎧 Let's look at our second <span>question</span> for this <span>section</span>.<br/>
🎧 What is your <span>leadership</span> <span>style</span>?<br/>
🎧 Look at a <span>sample</span> answer which doesn't use <span>signposting</span> <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm quite a <span>hands-off</span> <span>manager</span>.<br/>
🎧 If one of my <span>team</span> has a <span>project</span>, I'll keep an eye on things, but I don't need to be <span>involved</span> in every <span>detail</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm very <span>approachable</span>.<br/>
🎧 I make sure my <span>team</span> know they can come to me with <span>problems</span> or <span>questions</span> at any time.<br/>
🎧 I like to <span>lead</span> from the <span>front</span>.<br/>
🎧 If <span>everyone's</span> working <span>late</span> to meet a <span>deadline</span>, I make sure I'm there with them.<br/>
🎧 Now, look at some <span>signposting</span> <span>language</span> you could use in this answer.<br/>
🎧 Now, you have a <span>job</span> to do!<br/>
🎧 I want you to <span>pause</span> the <span>video</span> and put these <span>signposting</span> <span>phrases</span> into the answer you just saw.<br/>
🎧 Go on, <span>pause</span> the <span>video</span> and do it now!<br/>
🎧 Ready?<br/>
🎧 Let's look at the <span>answers</span>:<br/>
🎧 How did you do?<br/>
🎧 Were you able to use the <span>signposting</span> <span>language</span>?<br/>
🎧 Remember, <span>signposting</span> <span>language</span> might <span>seem</span> very simple, but don't <span>forget</span> about it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Using</span> <span>signposting</span> <span>language</span> well makes your <span>answers</span> much <span>clearer</span> and <span>easier</span> to <span>follow</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Star</span> <span>Method<br/></span>
🎧 Now, let's look at another way to make your <span>answers</span> more <span>structured</span>, <span>clearer</span> and more <span>focused</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll see <span>answers</span> to these two <span>questions</span> in this <span>section</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can you tell me about a time when you <span>demonstrated</span> <span>-----</span>?<br/>
🎧 Tell me about a time you <span>dealt</span> with a <span>challenging</span> <span>situation</span> at work.<br/>
🎧 These <span>questions</span> are <span>likely</span> to need <span>longer</span> <span>answers</span>.<br/>
🎧 With <span>longer</span> <span>answers</span>, it's really important that your <span>answers</span> have a <span>clear</span> <span>structure</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Otherwise</span>, your <span>meaning</span> might get <span>lost</span>!<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>method</span> you can use <span>here;</span> it's called the <span>STAR</span> <span>method</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>STAR</span> <span>means</span> <span>situation</span>, <span>task</span>, <span>action</span>, <span>result</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, you start your answer by <span>giving</span> the <span>context</span>: what was the <span>situation</span>, and what did you have to do?<br/>
🎧 Then, you talk about what you actually did, and what the end <span>result</span> was.<br/>
🎧 Let's do an example together.<br/>
🎧 Can you tell me about a time when you <span>demonstrated</span> <span>excellent</span> <span>customer</span> <span>service</span>?<br/>
🎧 Let's use the <span>STAR</span> <span>method</span>.<br/>
🎧 There was one time when a <span>customer's</span> order hadn't <span>arrived</span>, and we didn't know what had <span>happened</span> to it.<br/>
🎧 The <span>customer</span> was very <span>unhappy</span>, and I had to try to <span>solve</span> the <span>problem</span> for him.<br/>
🎧 I <span>arranged</span> for a <span>replacement</span> to be <span>sent</span>, thinking we could find out what <span>happened</span> to the <span>previous</span> order later.<br/>
🎧 In the end, the <span>customer</span> was happy that I could <span>solve</span> his <span>problem</span> quickly and <span>simply</span>.<br/>
🎧 You see how <span>following</span> this <span>method</span> <span>lets</span> you <span>build</span> <span>clear</span>, <span>structured</span> <span>answers</span>? <span>situation</span>, <span>task</span>, <span>action</span>, <span>result<br/></span>
🎧 Let's do another example.<br/>
🎧 Think about our second <span>question</span>.<br/>
🎧 Tell me about a time you <span>dealt</span> with a <span>challenging</span> <span>situation</span> at work.<br/>
🎧 This time, you're going to try!<br/>
🎧 <span>Pause</span> the <span>video</span> and make an answer to this <span>question</span>.<br/>
🎧 Your answer should be <span>four</span> <span>sentences</span> long.<br/>
🎧 <span>Follow</span> the <span>STAR</span> <span>method</span>, one <span>sentence</span> for each <span>part</span>.<br/>
🎧 How was that?<br/>
🎧 Did you find it easy to make your own answer?<br/>
🎧 Let's look at one way you could answer this <span>question</span>.<br/>
🎧 Once, we <span>realised</span> <span>three</span> <span>days</span> before a <span>project</span> <span>deadline</span> that two of our <span>teams</span> were <span>using</span> <span>incompatible</span> <span>software</span> <span>tools</span>.<br/>
🎧 As the <span>project</span> <span>manager</span>, I had to find a way to <span>deal</span> with this without <span>causing</span> any <span>delays</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>talked</span> to both <span>team</span> <span>leaders</span> and we made a plan for one <span>team</span> to <span>convert</span> their work into a different <span>format</span>, with help from some <span>staff</span> from other <span>departments</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was very <span>close</span> but we <span>managed</span> to get everything done on time.<br/>
🎧 Again, you can see the <span>STAR</span> <span>method</span> in <span>action</span>: <span>situation</span>, <span>task</span>, <span>action</span>, <span>result</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you <span>combine</span> this <span>STAR</span> <span>method</span> with the <span>signposting</span> <span>language</span> you <span>learned</span> about in <span>part</span> two, you'll be able to <span>express</span> yourself <span>clearly</span> in English, even in <span>longer</span> and more <span>complex</span> <span>answers</span>.<br/>
🎧 Finally, let's look at another tip you can use to <span>impress</span> your <span>interviewer</span> and <span>increase</span> your <span>chances</span> of getting that <span>job</span> <span>offer</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Mirroring<br/></span>
🎧 You're going to learn about <span>mirroring</span> and how it can help you.<br/>
🎧 What does <span>mirroring</span> mean?<br/>
🎧 It <span>means</span> <span>using</span> some of the same <span>words</span> and <span>expressions</span> as the person you're talking to.<br/>
🎧 For example, if the <span>interviewer</span> <span>asks</span> you:<br/>
🎧 How do you think your <span>values</span> fit our company <span>culture</span>?<br/>
🎧 You could start your answer by saying:<br/>
🎧 I think my <span>values</span> are a good fit for your company <span>culture</span> for two <span>reasons</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>One…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Mirroring</span> has <span>several</span> <span>benefits</span>.<br/>
🎧 First, it <span>keeps</span> your <span>answers</span> <span>focused</span>.<br/>
🎧 By <span>using</span> the same <span>words</span> and <span>phrases</span>, your answer will be <span>relevant</span>.<br/>
🎧 More <span>importantly</span>, it <span>shows</span> the <span>interviewer</span> that you're <span>listening</span> and that you <span>care</span> about the <span>questions</span> and the company.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mirroring</span> is <span>powerful</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>unconsciously</span> <span>mirror</span> people when we like or <span>respect</span> them.<br/>
🎧 <span>Using</span> <span>mirroring</span> <span>consciously</span> will help you to make a better <span>impression</span>.<br/>
🎧 You should start by <span>researching</span> the company you're <span>applying</span> to.<br/>
🎧 How do they <span>describe</span> <span>themselves</span>?<br/>
🎧 What <span>adjectives</span> do they use on their <span>website</span> or in their <span>advertising</span>?<br/>
🎧 Also, read the <span>job</span> <span>advertisement</span> <span>carefully</span>.<br/>
🎧 Pay <span>attention</span> to the <span>words</span> they use to <span>describe</span> the <span>candidate</span> they're looking for.<br/>
🎧 Use these <span>words</span> in your <span>answers</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's think about this <span>question</span>:<br/>
🎧 Why do you want this <span>job</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Imagine</span> you're <span>applying</span> to a company which <span>describes</span> <span>itself</span> as <span>'innovative'</span> and <span>'forward-looking'</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>job</span> <span>advertisement</span>, they say they want <span>someone</span> who is <span>'creative'</span> and <span>'flexible'</span>.<br/>
🎧 Here's a good <span>sample</span> answer:<br/>
🎧 <span>Creativity</span> is very important to me, and I've always wanted to work in an <span>environment</span> <span>where<br/></span>
🎧 I can <span>innovate</span> and find my own <span>solutions</span> to <span>challenges</span>.<br/>
🎧 I also feel that your company will <span>continue</span> to <span>evolve</span> in the future, and I like the idea of <span>contributing</span> to that <span>development</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>candidate</span> doesn't use all <span>four</span> <span>words</span>, but she does <span>reference</span> all <span>four</span> <span>ideas</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, <span>instead</span> of <span>'forward-looking'</span>, she <span>talks</span> about the company <span>evolving</span> in the future.<br/>
🎧 In this way, she <span>shows</span> that she's in <span>tune</span> with the <span>company's</span> <span>values</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's do one more example.<br/>
🎧 <span>Imagine</span> you're <span>applying</span> to a company which <span>describes</span> <span>itself</span> as <span>'commanding</span> <span>respect'</span> and which <span>talks</span> with <span>pride</span> about its long <span>history</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>job</span> <span>advertisement</span>, they say they want <span>someone</span> who has <span>'great</span> <span>communication</span> <span>skills'</span> and <span>'passion</span> for <span>helping</span> <span>others'</span>.<br/>
🎧 During the <span>interview</span>, they ask:<br/>
🎧 Why should we <span>hire</span> you?<br/>
🎧 Here's a good <span>sample</span> answer, <span>using</span> <span>mirroring</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>believe</span> that great <span>customer</span> <span>service</span> <span>starts</span> with good <span>communication</span>, which is a <span>strength</span> of <span>mine</span>.<br/>
🎧 I also think that in <span>customer</span> <span>service</span>, you need to <span>care</span> about what you're doing.<br/>
🎧 I <span>care</span> about <span>helping</span> <span>others</span> and as such I <span>believe</span> you would find me to be a <span>respectful</span> and <span>effective</span> <span>team</span> <span>member</span> who can fit with the <span>established</span> <span>traditions</span> of your company.<br/>
🎧 Again, the <span>candidate</span> doesn't <span>necessarily</span> use the <span>words</span> <span>directly</span>, but he does <span>reference</span> all <span>four</span> of the <span>ideas</span>.<br/>
