🎧 Hi, I'm <span>Oli</span>. <span>Welcome</span> to <span>Oxford</span> Online English!<br/>
🎧 In this <span>lesson</span>, you can learn how to talk about your <span>family</span> in English.<br/>
🎧 Do you have a big <span>family</span>?<br/>
🎧 What do you like doing when you <span>spend</span> time with your <span>family</span>?<br/>
🎧 Talking about <span>family</span> can be a good way to start a <span>conversation</span> in English, so it's <span>useful</span> if you know what to say and if you have some <span>questions</span> to ask.<br/>
🎧 Let's start with something simple.<br/>
🎧 <span>Part</span> one: <span>introducing</span> your <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's start with a simple <span>sentence</span>:<br/>
🎧 There are <span>________</span> people in my <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 So you can say:<br/>
🎧 There are <span>five..</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>ten..</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>thirty</span> people in my <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's not too <span>hard</span>, but it's not so <span>interesting</span>, either!<br/>
🎧 You should say who these people are.<br/>
🎧 There are ten people in my <span>family</span>: I have two <span>sisters</span>, one <span>brother</span>, my <span>uncle</span> and <span>aunt</span>, two <span>grandparents</span> and my <span>parents</span> of course.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>four</span> people in my <span>family</span>: my <span>wife</span>, my two <span>sons</span> and myself.<br/>
🎧 <span>Part</span> two: Talking about your <span>brothers</span> and <span>sisters</span>.<br/>
🎧 How many <span>brothers</span> and <span>sisters</span> do you have?<br/>
🎧 You could say:<br/>
🎧 I have two <span>brothers</span> and one <span>sister</span>.<br/>
🎧 I just have one <span>sister</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm an only <span>child</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's make it more <span>interesting</span> by <span>adding</span> more <span>information</span>.<br/>
🎧 Are your <span>brothers</span> and <span>sisters</span> <span>older</span> or <span>younger</span>?<br/>
🎧 Where are you in the <span>family</span>?<br/>
🎧 I have two <span>older</span> <span>brothers</span> and one <span>older</span> <span>sister</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm the <span>youngest</span> in the <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 I just have one <span>sister</span>, who's <span>five</span> years <span>older</span> than me.<br/>
🎧 I'm the <span>middle</span> <span>child</span>: my <span>brother</span> is two years <span>older</span>, and I have a <span>younger</span> <span>sister</span> who's <span>finishing</span> university this year.<br/>
🎧 <span>Part</span> <span>three</span>: talking about your <span>immediate</span> and your <span>extended</span> <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 In English, we sometimes <span>draw</span> a <span>line</span> between your <span>immediate</span> <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 That <span>means</span>: you, your <span>husband/wife</span>, your children, <span>parents</span>, and <span>brothers</span> and <span>sisters</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then, you have your <span>extended</span> <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 That <span>means</span>: <span>aunts</span>, <span>uncles</span>, <span>cousins</span>, <span>nephews</span>, <span>nieces</span>, <span>grandparents</span>, <span>grandchildren</span>, and so on.<br/>
🎧 Now, you can give more <span>details</span> about the people in your <span>family</span>, like this:<br/>
🎧 My <span>immediate</span> <span>family</span> is quite small, because I'm an only <span>child</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mum</span> is one of <span>five</span> children, so I have a lot of <span>cousins</span>, who are kind of like my <span>brothers</span> and <span>sisters</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are six people in my <span>immediate</span> <span>family</span>: my <span>parents</span>, my <span>brother</span> and his <span>wife</span>, my <span>sister</span> and me.<br/>
🎧 I have a lot of other <span>relatives</span>, but they live in <span>Canada</span> so we don't see them often.<br/>
🎧 <span>Part</span> <span>four</span>: talking about your children.<br/>
🎧 Do you have children?<br/>
🎧 Let's see what you can say:<br/>
🎧 I have <span>three</span> <span>kids</span>: two girls and a boy.<br/>
🎧 We have a <span>newborn</span> son.<br/>
🎧 We have one <span>daughter</span>, and my <span>wife's</span> <span>expecting</span> our second <span>child</span>.<br/>
🎧 As always, you should add <span>details</span> to make your <span>answers</span> <span>longer</span> and more <span>interesting</span>:<br/>
🎧 I have <span>three</span> <span>kids</span>: two girls and a boy.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>eldest</span> <span>daughter</span> has just <span>started</span> <span>secondary</span> school, and the two <span>younger</span> <span>ones</span> are still in <span>primary</span> school.<br/>
🎧 We have a <span>newborn</span> son.<br/>
🎧 He's just <span>three</span> <span>weeks</span> old now, so we're still getting used to things!<br/>
🎧 We have one <span>daughter</span>, and my <span>wife's</span> <span>expecting</span> our second <span>child</span>.<br/>
🎧 We don't know if it's a boy or a girl, but we'll find out in <span>three</span> <span>months</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Part</span> <span>five</span>: talking about your <span>relationship</span> with your <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 Finally, let's add some <span>information</span> about how often you see your <span>family</span>, and what you like to do together.<br/>
🎧 For example:<br/>
🎧 I'm very <span>close</span> to my <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 We have lunch together every weekend.<br/>
🎧 I see my <span>older</span> <span>brother</span> once a <span>week;</span> we play <span>tennis</span> or <span>basketball</span> together.<br/>
🎧 I try to <span>spend</span> as much time as <span>possible</span> with my <span>kids</span>.<br/>
🎧 What now? You should know the answer: add more <span>details</span>!<br/>
🎧 Let's look: I'm very <span>close</span> to my <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 We have lunch together every weekend at my <span>grandmother's</span> house.<br/>
🎧 She always <span>cooks</span> something <span>delicious</span>!<br/>
🎧 I see my <span>older</span> <span>brother</span> once a <span>week;</span> we play <span>tennis</span> or <span>basketball</span> together.<br/>
🎧 I don't see my other <span>brother</span> so often, because he lives <span>overseas</span>, although we talk on <span>Skype</span> every so often.<br/>
🎧 I try to <span>spend</span> as much time as <span>possible</span> with my <span>kids</span>.<br/>
🎧 We play <span>cards</span>, <span>watch</span> <span>films</span>, or go to the <span>park</span> if the <span>weather's</span> nice.<br/>
🎧 <span>Part</span> six: <span>making</span> a <span>longer</span> answer.<br/>
🎧 Now you should be able to make a <span>longer</span> answer talking about your <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 You should be able to talk about your <span>relatives</span>, your <span>brothers</span> and <span>sisters</span>, your children <span>if<br/></span>
🎧 you have any, and your <span>relationship</span> with your <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's look at a <span>sample</span> answer:<br/>
🎧 There are <span>five</span> people in my <span>immediate</span> <span>family</span>, although my <span>extended</span> <span>family</span> is quite large.<br/>
🎧 I have two <span>sisters</span>, both <span>younger</span>, so I'm the <span>oldest</span> <span>child</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't have <span>kids</span> yet but I'd like to have a big <span>family</span> one day.<br/>
🎧 I see my <span>parents</span> and my <span>sisters</span> quite often, because we all live near each other, <span>although<br/></span>
🎧 I don't see my other <span>relatives</span> that much. OK?<br/>
🎧 Could you make an answer like this?<br/>
🎧 Let's look at one more <span>sample</span> answer first:<br/>
🎧 I come from a big <span>family</span>: I'm the <span>fifth</span> <span>child</span>, and I have <span>three</span> <span>brothers</span> and one <span>sister</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're all <span>close</span> to each other in age, but there's a big <span>gap</span> between them and me.<br/>
🎧 I don't have children, but I have lots of <span>nieces</span> and <span>nephews</span>!<br/>
🎧 I don't see my <span>family</span> often because I live in a different <span>country</span>, but I speak to them <span>regularly</span> and we all get together once or <span>twice</span> a year, which is always very <span>noisy</span> but lots of fun.<br/>
🎧 What about you? Try to make a <span>longer</span> answer talking about your <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 Use the <span>vocabulary</span> and <span>ideas</span> from the <span>lesson</span> to help you.<br/>
🎧 Next time you talk about your <span>family</span> in English, <span>hopefully</span> you'll have lots to talk about!<br/>
🎧 That's the end of the <span>lesson</span>. I hope it was <span>useful</span>.<br/>
