🎧 Hi, I'm <span>Gina</span>. <span>Welcome</span> to <span>Oxford</span> Online English!<br/>
🎧 Where do you live? Do you live in a small <span>town</span>, a big <span>city</span>, or a <span>remote</span> <span>village</span>?<br/>
🎧 What's it like?<br/>
🎧 In this <span>lesson</span>, you can learn how to <span>describe</span> your <span>hometown</span> in English.<br/>
🎧 Let's start with some <span>basic</span> English <span>vocabulary</span> You can use to talk about your <span>hometown</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Part</span> one: <span>introducing</span> your <span>hometown</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's start with a simple <span>sentence</span>.<br/>
🎧 I live in a <span>________</span>.<br/>
🎧 What could you say? You could say something like:<br/>
🎧 I live in a <span>city;</span> I live in a <span>town;</span> I live in a <span>village</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's a good start, but it's very <span>basic</span>. Let's add a bit more <span>detail</span>.<br/>
🎧 What's it called? How big is it?<br/>
🎧 I live in <span>Paris</span>. It's the <span>capital</span> <span>city;</span> I live in <span>Shanghai</span>. It's a <span>huge</span> <span>city;<br/></span>
🎧 I live in a small <span>town</span>. It's called <span>Banbury;</span> I live in <span>Manarola</span>, which is a <span>tiny</span> <span>village</span> by the sea.<br/>
🎧 Better! You should always try to add more <span>details</span> when you speak.<br/>
🎧 What about you? Where do you live? Can you make one or two <span>sentences</span> like this?<br/>
🎧 <span>Pause</span> the <span>video</span> and practice!<br/>
🎧 Okay, let's move on. We need to make <span>ouranswers</span> more <span>detailed</span> and <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Adding</span> <span>Background</span> <span>Details<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Part</span> two: <span>adding</span> <span>background</span> and <span>details</span>.<br/>
🎧 Think about these <span>questions</span>:<br/>
🎧 What's your <span>hometown</span> famous for? Can you think of some <span>words</span> you could use to <span>describe</span> your <span>hometown</span>?<br/>
🎧 How long have you <span>lived</span> there?<br/>
🎧 Add these <span>ideas</span> to your answer to make it <span>longer</span> and more <span>detailed</span>. For example:<br/>
🎧 I live in <span>Paris</span>, the <span>capital</span> <span>city</span>. It's famous for its <span>landmarks</span> such as the <span>Eiffel</span> <span>Tower</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>Notre</span> <span>Dame</span> <span>Cathedral</span> or the <span>Louvre</span>. It's also <span>well-known</span> for its food, of course!<br/>
🎧 I live in <span>Shanghai</span>. It's a <span>huge</span>, <span>bustling</span>, <span>international</span> <span>city</span>.<br/>
🎧 People from all over the <span>world</span> live and work there.<br/>
🎧 I live in a small <span>town</span> called <span>Banbury</span>. I've been living there for about <span>five</span> years,<br/>
🎧 since I <span>finished</span> university.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>pretty</span> <span>sleepy</span> place, to be <span>honest</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's look at some <span>useful</span> <span>vocabulary</span> from these <span>examples</span>: Which you can use when you speak.<br/>
🎧 <span>Vocabulary<br/></span>
🎧 We said:<br/>
🎧 <span>Paris</span> is famous for its <span>landmarks</span> such as the <span>Eiffel</span> <span>Tower</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Landmarks</span> are famous <span>places</span> or <span>buildings</span>, like the <span>Eiffel</span> <span>Tower</span> in <span>Paris</span>, the <span>Sydney<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Opera</span> House or <span>Christ</span> the <span>Redeemer</span> in <span>Rio</span>.<br/>
🎧 Does your <span>hometown</span> have any famous <span>landmarks</span>? What are they called in English?<br/>
🎧 Next, we said:<br/>
🎧 <span>Shanghai</span> is a <span>bustling</span> <span>city</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you know what this <span>means</span>?<br/>
🎧 It <span>means</span> there's a lot of <span>activity</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are lots of people, lots of <span>traffic</span>, lots of life and <span>energy</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is your <span>city</span> <span>bustling</span> or <span>sleepy</span>? If a <span>town</span> is <span>sleepy</span> there's not much <span>activity</span> and things are <span>quiet</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about your <span>hometown</span>. Look at our <span>questions</span> again:<br/>
🎧 What's your <span>hometown</span> famous for? Can you think of some <span>words</span> you could use to <span>describe</span> your <span>hometown</span>?<br/>
🎧 How long have you <span>lived</span> there?<br/>
🎧 What could you say about your <span>hometown</span>? <span>Pause</span> the <span>video</span> and try to make <span>2-3</span> <span>sentences</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay? Let's look at our next <span>point</span>.<br/>
🎧 Saying What You <span>Like<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Part</span> <span>three</span>: Saying what you like about your <span>hometown</span>.<br/>
🎧 What's good about your <span>hometown</span>? What do you like most about it?<br/>
🎧 Different people like different things in a <span>city</span> or <span>town</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's look at some example <span>sentences</span> which <span>express</span> <span>positive</span> <span>feelings</span>:<br/>
🎧 I love living in <span>Paris</span>. It's got such a <span>rich</span> <span>culture</span> and there's always something <span>interesting</span> going on.<br/>
🎧 <span>Shanghai's</span> a great place to live. It's a <span>real</span> <span>24-hour</span> <span>city</span> and you can meet people from all over the <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 Living in <span>Banbury</span> <span>suits</span> me. It's a <span>quiet</span> <span>place<br/></span>
🎧 and it's small enough that you can get to know your <span>neighbours</span> and have a <span>sense</span> of <span>community</span>.<br/>
🎧 What's important for you?<br/>
🎧 <span>Whats</span> Important For <span>You<br/></span>
🎧 Do you want to live somewhere with a <span>rich</span> <span>culture</span> and a <span>sense</span> of <span>history</span>,<br/>
🎧 or do you <span>prefer</span> more <span>modern</span>, <span>international</span> <span>cities</span>?<br/>
🎧 Would you rather live somewhere <span>larger</span> and more <span>energetic</span>, or somewhere <span>smaller</span> and more <span>peaceful</span>?<br/>
🎧 Think about these <span>ideas</span>. You'll need them in a <span>minute</span>!<br/>
🎧 Let's look at some <span>useful</span> <span>language</span> from our <span>examples</span>:<br/>
🎧 I love living in <span>_______;</span> <span>_______'s</span> a great place to <span>live;</span> Living in <span>_______</span> <span>suits</span> me.<br/>
🎧 Of course, you can change these to say what you want to:<br/>
🎧 I quite like living in <span>_______;</span> I really like living in <span>________;<br/></span>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> I don't <span>mind</span> living in <span>________</span>.<br/>
🎧 We also saw some <span>useful</span> <span>phrases</span> in our <span>examples</span>:<br/>
🎧 It's got such a <span>rich</span> <span>culture;</span> There's always something <span>interesting</span> going <span>on;<br/></span>
🎧 It's a <span>real</span> <span>24-hour</span> <span>city;</span> You can meet people from all over the <span>world;<br/></span>
🎧 It's small enough that you can get to know your <span>neighbours</span> and have a <span>sense</span> of <span>community<br/></span>
🎧 What does that last <span>phrase</span> mean?<br/>
🎧 If you have a <span>sense</span> of <span>community</span>, it <span>means</span> people know their <span>neighbours</span> and feel like they <span>belong</span> to a <span>wider</span> <span>community</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Smaller</span> <span>towns</span> and <span>villages</span> often have a better <span>sense</span> of <span>community</span>, <span>perhaps</span> because people have more time to talk to each other and do things together.<br/>
🎧 What about your <span>hometown</span>? Could you use any of these <span>phrases</span> to <span>describe</span> where you live?<br/>
🎧 Next, what if you don't like something about your <span>hometown</span>?<br/>
🎧 Saying What You <span>Dislike<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Part</span> <span>four</span>: saying what you <span>dislike</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's look at some <span>examples</span> which <span>express</span> <span>negative</span> <span>feelings</span>:<br/>
🎧 <span>Paris</span> is great, but the <span>cost</span> of living is really high. That can be quite <span>stressful</span> because you're always thinking about money and how to make <span>ends</span> meet.<br/>
🎧 <span>Shanghai's</span> an <span>exciting</span> place, but it's really <span>crowded</span> and it can be <span>exhausting</span> to live there.<br/>
🎧 Air <span>quality</span> can be an issue, <span>particularly</span> in the <span>summer</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Banbury's</span> nice, but sometimes I find it a bit <span>boring</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's not much <span>nightlife</span> and sometimes it <span>feels</span> a bit cut off from the <span>wider</span> <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 When talking about things you don't like about your <span>hometown</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can use <span>adjectives</span> like, <span>'stressful'</span>, <span>'crowded'</span>, <span>'boring'</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can make your answer more <span>interesting</span> by <span>using</span> <span>phrases</span>.<br/>
🎧 We saw some <span>useful</span> <span>ones</span> in our <span>examples</span>:<br/>
🎧 The <span>cost</span> of living is really <span>high;</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 You're always thinking about how to make <span>ends</span> meet.<br/>
🎧 <span>Meaning</span>: you're always thinking about how to pay for your <span>basic</span> living <span>costs</span>.<br/>
🎧 It can be <span>exhausting</span> to live <span>there;<br/></span>
🎧 Air <span>quality</span> can be an <span>issue;</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 There's not much <span>nightlife;</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 It <span>feels</span> a bit cut off from the <span>wider</span> <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Meaning</span>: you feel like you're <span>far</span> away from people, <span>culture</span> and <span>activity</span>.<br/>
🎧 Could you use any of these <span>phrases</span> to <span>describe</span> your <span>hometown</span>?<br/>
🎧 Remember that you can also change the <span>phrases</span> to fit your <span>ideas</span>. For example:<br/>
🎧 <span>Traffic</span> can be an <span>issue;<br/></span>
🎧 There's not much for young people to <span>do;<br/></span>
🎧 It can be very <span>stressful</span> to live here.<br/>
🎧 Talking About <span>Changes<br/></span>
🎧 Okay, what about you? Try to make <span>3-4</span> <span>sentences</span>. Say what you like and <span>dislike</span> about your <span>hometown</span>.<br/>
🎧 Use the key <span>words</span> and <span>phrases</span> from <span>parts</span> <span>3</span> and <span>4</span>.<br/>
🎧 Go on, <span>pause</span> the <span>video</span> and practice!<br/>
🎧 Okay? We have one more thing to do:<br/>
🎧 <span>Part</span> <span>five</span>: <span>describing</span> how it's <span>changed</span> over time.<br/>
🎧 What was your <span>hometown</span> like ten, <span>twenty</span> or <span>fifty</span> years ago?<br/>
🎧 How has it <span>changed</span>?<br/>
🎧 How has it <span>changed</span> over time?<br/>
🎧 Some <span>places</span> change very <span>fast;</span> other <span>places</span> never <span>seem</span> to change at all!<br/>
🎧 Talking about changes can add <span>interesting</span> and <span>useful</span> <span>information</span> to your <span>description</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's look:<br/>
🎧 <span>Paris</span> has <span>changed</span> a lot in the last <span>twenty</span> years.<br/>
🎧 It's much more <span>international</span> and much more <span>expensive</span> than it used to be.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, the <span>soul</span> of the <span>city</span> is still there.<br/>
🎧 <span>Paris</span> will always be <span>Paris</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Shanghai</span> is almost <span>unrecognisable</span> <span>compared</span> to <span>twenty</span> or <span>thirty</span> years ago.<br/>
🎧 The <span>city</span> has <span>expanded</span> so much, both <span>physically</span> and <span>economically</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's amazing when you see old <span>photos</span> of the <span>city;</span> things are so different now!<br/>
🎧 <span>Banbury</span> hasn't <span>changed</span> much as a place in the last <span>twenty</span> years,<br/>
🎧 but the mix of people is a bit different <span>nowadays</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>population</span> used to be <span>older</span> and <span>mostly</span> English, <span>whereas</span> now there are more young people living here, <span>including</span> many people from other <span>parts</span> of <span>Europe</span>.<br/>
🎧 Again, these <span>examples</span> <span>contain</span> a lot of <span>useful</span> <span>language</span> you can use to talk about your <span>hometown</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example:<br/>
🎧 <span>________</span> has <span>changed</span> a lot in the last <span>twenty</span> <span>years;<br/></span>
🎧 <span>________</span> is almost <span>unrecognisable</span> <span>compared</span> to <span>twenty</span> years <span>ago<br/></span>
🎧 <span>;</span> <span>________</span> hasn't <span>changed</span> much as a place in the last <span>twenty</span> years.<br/>
🎧 Which of these <span>sentences</span> is <span>true</span> for your <span>hometown</span>? Can you add <span>details</span> to <span>explain</span> why?<br/>
🎧 For example:<br/>
🎧 It's much more <span>________</span> than it used to <span>be;</span> The <span>city</span> has <span>________</span> so <span>much;</span> <span><br/></span>
🎧 <span>The________</span> is a bit different <span>nowadays</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Review<br/></span>
🎧 Now, you've <span>seen</span> a lot of <span>useful</span> <span>language</span> you can use to talk about your <span>hometown</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's put everything together and practice <span>making</span> a <span>longer</span> answer.<br/>
🎧 <span>Part</span> six: <span>review</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you remember all the <span>points</span> we <span>talked</span> about? We <span>covered</span>:<br/>
🎧 <span>Introducing</span> your <span>hometown</span>, <span>adding</span> <span>background</span> and <span>details</span>, talking about what you like or <span>dislike</span> about it, talking about how it's <span>changed</span> over time.<br/>
🎧 <span>Follow</span> these <span>points</span> and you can make a long, <span>detailed</span> answer to <span>describe</span> your <span>hometown</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example:<br/>
🎧 I live in <span>St</span> <span>Petersburg</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's the second <span>largest</span> <span>city</span> in <span>Russia</span>, and it's a <span>beautiful</span> place to live.<br/>
🎧 I've <span>lived</span> here all my life and I can't <span>imagine</span> living <span>anywhere</span> else!<br/>
🎧 It has such a <span>rich</span> <span>culture</span>,<br/>
🎧 I think <span>partly</span> because the <span>city's</span> <span>history</span> is a mix of <span>European</span> and <span>Russian</span> <span>influences</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think that's why I like it <span>here—it's</span> a <span>unique</span> place.<br/>
🎧 <span>Traffic</span> can be an issue in the <span>city</span> <span>centre</span>, but <span>public</span> <span>transport</span> is very good.<br/>
🎧 The <span>city</span> hasn't <span>changed</span> much in the last <span>twenty</span> years, although there are <span>certainly</span> more and more <span>tourists</span> these <span>days</span>!<br/>
🎧 Could you make an answer like this?<br/>
🎧 Let's do one more example first.<br/>
🎧 I'll tell you about my <span>hometown</span>:<br/>
🎧 I'm from <span>Denver</span>, the <span>capital</span> of <span>Colorado</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's near the <span>Rocky</span> <span>Mountains</span>, so the <span>surrounding</span> <span>area</span> is quite <span>beautiful</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've been living here for about <span>three</span> years.<br/>
🎧 I really like <span>Denver</span> because it's a young <span>city</span> with lots of <span>energy</span>, but if you need a <span>break</span> it's easy to drive to the <span>mountains</span> and find a <span>quiet</span> place to <span>relax</span>.<br/>
🎧 The only <span>real</span> <span>disadvantage</span> is that <span>winter</span> can be <span>seriously</span> <span>cold</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Denver's</span> <span>changed</span> quite a lot in the last <span>twenty</span> <span>years<br/></span>
🎧 Many people are <span>moving</span> here to work.<br/>
🎧 <span>Unfortunately</span>, the <span>cost</span> of living has also <span>gone</span> up quite a lot.<br/>
🎧 Okay, now it's definitely your <span>turn</span>! Talk about your <span>hometown</span>. Make a <span>longer</span> answer like these <span>ones</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you want, you can <span>post</span> your answer in the <span>video</span> <span>comments</span>. We'll give you <span>feedback</span> on your English.<br/>
🎧 That's the end of the <span>lesson</span>. I hope you <span>learned</span> something <span>useful</span>!<br/>
