🎧 Hi, I'm <span>Michael</span>. <span>Welcome</span> to <span>Oxford</span> Online English.<br/>
🎧 In this <span>lesson</span>, you can learn how to <span>describe</span> a <span>picture</span> in English.<br/>
🎧 <span>Describing</span> a <span>picture</span> is <span>useful</span> in many English <span>exams;</span> you need to <span>describe</span> a <span>picture</span> in English for <span>exams</span> like <span>FCE</span>, <span>TOEIC</span> or <span>PTE</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's also a good way to <span>practise</span> your <span>general</span> English <span>skills</span>.<br/>
🎧 Take an <span>interesting</span> <span>picture</span>, and try to <span>describe</span> it in English.<br/>
🎧 You can <span>practise</span> your <span>speaking</span> and learn some new English <span>vocabulary</span>!<br/>
🎧 In this <span>lesson</span>, you can learn how to <span>describe</span> a <span>picture</span> in English in <span>clear</span>, <span>detailed</span> <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 We'll show you how to <span>build</span> an answer <span>step-by-step</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Summary<br/></span>
🎧 What's the best way to start your <span>description</span>?<br/>
🎧 Start with a <span>summary</span>, <span>giving</span> a <span>general</span> <span>description</span> of what's in the <span>picture</span> and what you can see.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>useful</span> to <span>imagine</span> that the person you're talking to can't see the <span>picture</span>.<br/>
🎧 Think: what does the other person need to know?<br/>
🎧 What do you need to say so that other people can <span>understand</span> what's in the <span>picture</span>?<br/>
🎧 Let's do an example.<br/>
🎧 You want to <span>summarize</span> what you see in one or two simple <span>sentences</span>.<br/>
🎧 How could you do that?<br/>
🎧 You could say:<br/>
🎧 There are <span>several</span> small <span>boats</span> next to a <span>beach</span>.<br/>
🎧 Or, The <span>picture</span> <span>shows</span> a <span>beach</span>, with many small <span>boats</span> in the water <span>nearby</span>.<br/>
🎧 Simple <span>summaries</span> like this make it easy to <span>understand</span> the <span>general</span> <span>contents</span> of the <span>picture</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's do one more: What could you say here?<br/>
🎧 Here are some <span>possible</span> <span>answers</span>:<br/>
🎧 There are <span>three</span> people cooking in a <span>kitchen</span>.<br/>
🎧 Or, The <span>picture</span> <span>shows</span> <span>three</span> young friends cooking together.<br/>
🎧 Okay, now it's your <span>turn</span>.<br/>
🎧 Here's another <span>picture</span>: You need to make a <span>summary</span> of what you see.<br/>
🎧 You can use these <span>phrases</span>:<br/>
🎧 There <span>is…</span> or, There <span>are…<br/></span>
🎧 The <span>picture</span> <span>shows…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Pause</span> the <span>video</span>, and make one or two <span>sentences</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can <span>write</span> down your <span>answers</span> if you want.<br/>
🎧 Okay, after your <span>summary</span>, you can start <span>giving</span> more <span>detail</span> about what you see in the <span>picture</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Detail<br/></span>
🎧 To start <span>giving</span> <span>detail</span>, you can talk about where things are in the <span>picture</span>.<br/>
🎧 Here's some <span>useful</span> <span>language</span> to help you do this:<br/>
🎧 Let's do an example.<br/>
🎧 You could say:<br/>
🎧 On the <span>left</span>, there's a girl with <span>dark</span>, <span>curly</span> <span>hair</span>.<br/>
🎧 She's <span>holding</span> <span>half</span> a <span>cauliflower</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>middle</span>, there's a man who's <span>chopping</span> <span>vegetables</span>.<br/>
🎧 At the <span>bottom</span>, we can see a <span>counter</span> with many different <span>vegetables</span> on it.<br/>
🎧 When talking about <span>photos</span>, you might also need the <span>phrases</span>:<br/>
🎧 In the <span>background…<br/></span>
🎧 In the <span>foreground…<br/></span>
🎧 For example: In the <span>foreground</span>, there's a <span>sandy</span> <span>beach</span> with <span>three</span> <span>metal</span> <span>anchors</span> on it.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>middle</span>, there are <span>several</span> small <span>boats</span>, which are <span>close</span> to the <span>beach</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>background</span>, we can see the <span>blue</span> sea <span>stretching</span> to the <span>horizon</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's put all of this <span>language</span> together in another example:<br/>
🎧 Think first: what could you say about this <span>picture</span>?<br/>
🎧 Okay, let's look at what you could say:<br/>
🎧 On the <span>left</span>, there's a cat <span>sitting</span> on a <span>table</span>.<br/>
🎧 On the right, there's a man <span>standing</span>, though we can't see his <span>face</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>background</span>, we can see <span>blue</span> sky and <span>snowy</span> <span>mountains</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now it's your <span>turn</span>!<br/>
🎧 Here's a <span>picture</span>:<br/>
🎧 <span>Pause</span> the <span>video</span>, and make at <span>least</span> <span>three</span> <span>sentences</span>.<br/>
🎧 Use the <span>useful</span> <span>language</span> you saw in this <span>section</span>.<br/>
🎧 Again, you can <span>write</span> your <span>sentences</span> down if you want to!<br/>
🎧 Okay? What's next?<br/>
🎧 Now, the person you're talking to should have a good <span>general</span> idea about what's in the <span>picture</span> you're <span>describing</span>, and where things are.<br/>
🎧 Next, you should start <span>describing</span> your <span>picture</span> in more <span>detail</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's look at a <span>picture</span> you've <span>seen</span> before: When <span>adding</span> <span>detail</span>, don't try to <span>describe</span> everything in the <span>picture</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's not <span>necessary</span> or <span>useful</span>.<br/>
🎧 You should add <span>details</span> to the most important <span>parts</span> of the <span>picture</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, for this <span>picture</span>, what do you think the most important <span>parts</span> are?<br/>
🎧 Probably, the person who took this <span>photo</span> took it because of the people.<br/>
🎧 So, you should focus your <span>description</span> on the two people.<br/>
🎧 Think: what do they look like, and what are they doing?<br/>
🎧 You could say:<br/>
🎧 The two people both look <span>unhappy</span> or <span>irritated</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're <span>sitting</span> at the <span>kitchen</span> <span>table</span> together, but they aren't talking to each other.<br/>
🎧 The man is <span>staring</span> down at the <span>table</span>, while the <span>woman</span> is <span>stirring</span> her tea with a <span>spoon</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's just <span>three</span> <span>sentences</span>, but they add a lot of <span>detail</span> to your <span>description</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's try one more: In this <span>picture</span>, what do you think you should focus on in your <span>description</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Fairly</span> <span>obviously</span>, you should talk about the <span>horses</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's try:<br/>
🎧 The <span>horses</span> are <span>running</span> through the <span>grass</span>.<br/>
🎧 Two of them are <span>black</span>, but the one in the <span>middle</span> is <span>white</span> and <span>grey</span>.<br/>
🎧 They don't have <span>saddles</span> or anything, so they could be <span>wild</span> <span>horses</span>.<br/>
🎧 Again, you can see that you can do a lot with just a few <span>sentences</span>.<br/>
🎧 Alright, now it's your <span>turn</span>!<br/>
🎧 Let's take a <span>picture</span> you've already <span>seen</span>: <span>Pause</span> the <span>video</span> and make at <span>least</span> <span>three</span> <span>sentences</span> to <span>describe</span> the <span>picture</span> in <span>detail</span>.<br/>
🎧 Try to <span>include</span> as much <span>information</span> as you can.<br/>
🎧 How was that?<br/>
🎧 If you want more practice, you can do the same <span>exercise</span> with other <span>pictures</span> from this <span>lesson</span>, or you could use your own <span>pictures</span>!<br/>
🎧 At this <span>point</span>, you've <span>described</span> the <span>picture</span> in <span>detail</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, what else can you do?<br/>
🎧 <span>Speculating<br/></span>
🎧 What does that mean?<br/>
🎧 <span>Speculating</span> <span>means</span> talking about <span>possibilities</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, look at this <span>picture</span>: Think about some <span>questions</span>:<br/>
🎧 Why are the <span>umbrellas</span> there?<br/>
🎧 Who put them there?<br/>
🎧 By trying to answer <span>questions</span> like this, you are <span>speculating;</span> you're talking about <span>possibilities</span> and <span>giving</span> your <span>opinion</span> about the <span>picture</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Speculating</span> can help you to make a <span>longer</span>, more <span>detailed</span> answer when talking about a <span>picture</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's do an example:<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> it might be some kind of <span>art</span> <span>project</span>.<br/>
🎧 Maybe one person put an <span>umbrella</span> up there as a <span>joke</span>, and then other people <span>started</span> doing it, too.<br/>
🎧 Let's look at one more <span>picture</span>:<br/>
🎧 Think, if you wanted to <span>speculate</span> about this <span>picture</span>, what could you say?<br/>
🎧 Another way to think about it: what <span>questions</span> could you ask yourself about this <span>picture</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Possible</span> <span>ideas</span> are: who made the <span>footprints</span>, and why?<br/>
🎧 Where were they going?<br/>
🎧 Where is the person who made the <span>footprints</span> now?<br/>
🎧 There are other <span>possibilities</span>, of course, so feel free to use your own <span>ideas</span>, too!<br/>
🎧 Okay, so what could you say to <span>speculate</span> about this <span>picture</span>?<br/>
🎧 Here are some <span>examples</span>:<br/>
🎧 The <span>footprints</span> must have been made by a <span>climber</span> or a <span>mountaineer</span>.<br/>
🎧 The person who made the <span>footprints</span> might be <span>standing</span> on top of the <span>mountain</span> now.<br/>
🎧 In our <span>examples</span>, you've <span>seen</span> some <span>useful</span> <span>language</span> which you can use to <span>speculate</span> about a <span>picture</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you remember?<br/>
🎧 You can use <span>language</span> like:<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Maybe…<br/></span>
🎧 It <span>must…<br/></span>
🎧 He <span>might…<br/></span>
🎧 Let's <span>practise</span> <span>using</span> these once more with another <span>picture</span>:<br/>
🎧 Could you make <span>four</span> <span>sentences</span>, <span>using</span> the <span>useful</span> <span>language</span> we just saw?<br/>
🎧 Let's do an example together:<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> the guy is a <span>climber</span>, or he's on an <span>adventure</span> <span>holiday</span>.<br/>
🎧 Maybe he <span>climbed</span> something, and now he's on the way down.<br/>
🎧 He must have a lot of <span>experience</span>, because his <span>body</span> <span>language</span> is quite <span>relaxed</span>.<br/>
🎧 He might be <span>focusing</span> on what he's doing, but he might just be <span>enjoying</span> the <span>view</span>!<br/>
🎧 Okay, now it's your <span>turn</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can you make <span>four</span> <span>sentences</span> to <span>speculate</span> about this <span>picture</span>, <span>using</span> the <span>language</span> you've <span>learned</span> in this <span>section</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Pause</span> the <span>video</span> and think about your <span>answers</span>!<br/>
🎧 Now, you have one more thing to do.<br/>
🎧 <span>Speculation<br/></span>
🎧 When you <span>speculate</span>, you can <span>speculate</span> about what you can see in the <span>picture</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, you <span>can—and</span> you <span>should—speculate</span> about what you can't see, too.<br/>
🎧 How's this <span>possible</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, think about this <span>picture</span>: You can think about <span>questions</span> like: where and when was the <span>picture</span> taken?<br/>
🎧 Who took the <span>picture</span>?<br/>
🎧 What was the <span>photographer</span> doing there?<br/>
🎧 For example:<br/>
🎧 I think this could be in the <span>USA</span>, or maybe <span>Russia</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a good <span>photo</span>, so <span>perhaps</span> it was taken by a <span>professional</span> <span>nature</span> <span>photographer</span>.<br/>
🎧 You see?<br/>
🎧 Talking about what you can't see in the <span>picture</span> can be very <span>useful</span>, and can help to add <span>details</span> to your answer.<br/>
🎧 Let's do one more example: What could you say about this <span>picture</span>?<br/>
🎧 Let's do this one together.<br/>
🎧 You could say:<br/>
🎧 This must be somewhere <span>tropical</span>, like the <span>Caribbean</span> or the <span>Maldives</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Perhaps</span> it was taken by a <span>tourist</span> who came to the <span>beach</span> on one of those <span>boats</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, one more.<br/>
🎧 This time, you have to do it yourself!<br/>
🎧 Here's your <span>picture</span>: Make at <span>least</span> two <span>sentences</span> to <span>speculate</span> about the <span>context</span> of the <span>picture</span>.<br/>
🎧 Think about where and when it was taken, who took it, and what the <span>photographer</span> was doing there.<br/>
🎧 How was that?<br/>
🎧 <span>Hopefully</span> you feel more <span>confident</span> <span>describing</span> <span>pictures</span> in English now.<br/>
🎧 Let's put everything you've <span>learned</span> together and <span>practise</span> <span>making</span> <span>longer</span>, <span>fluent</span> <span>descriptions</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you <span>describe</span> a <span>picture</span>, you should:<br/>
🎧 Give a <span>summary</span> of what you see.<br/>
🎧 Talk about where things are in the <span>picture</span>.<br/>
🎧 Add <span>details</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Speculate</span> about what's in the <span>picture</span>.<br/>
🎧 And, <span>Speculate</span> about the <span>context</span> of the <span>picture</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's make a <span>longer</span> answer together.<br/>
🎧 We'll start with a <span>picture</span> we've used already:<br/>
🎧 Here's a <span>possible</span> <span>longer</span> answer:<br/>
🎧 In the <span>picture</span>, there are two people <span>sitting</span> at a <span>table</span>, looking <span>unhappy</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>woman</span> on the <span>left</span> and a man on the right.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>middle</span> of the <span>picture</span>, we can see some things on the <span>table</span>, like <span>cups</span> of tea, <span>biscuits</span>, <span>milk</span> and so on.<br/>
🎧 The two people look sad or <span>irritated</span>, and they aren't <span>speaking</span> to each other.<br/>
🎧 They're both looking down at the <span>table</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> they had a <span>fight</span> and now they aren't talking to each other, or they might just be <span>bored</span> and not have anything to talk about.<br/>
🎧 I <span>guess</span> it's a <span>stock</span> <span>photo</span> because <span>otherwise</span>, why would the <span>photographer</span> be in the <span>kitchen</span> with them?<br/>
🎧 Do you think you could make an answer like this?<br/>
🎧 Remember, all the <span>language</span> you need is in this <span>lesson</span>.<br/>
🎧 You just need to take the things you <span>practised</span> in each <span>part</span>, and then put them together.<br/>
🎧 Let's do one more example together:<br/>
🎧 The <span>picture</span> <span>shows</span> <span>umbrellas</span> <span>hanging</span> in the air.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>foreground</span>, we can see a <span>streetlight</span>, and the <span>umbrellas</span> <span>fill</span> the <span>picture</span> from <span>left</span> to right.<br/>
🎧 The <span>umbrellas</span> are of many different <span>colours</span>, <span>mostly</span> <span>bright</span> <span>colours</span> like <span>pink</span>, <span>yellow</span> or <span>green</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're <span>hanging</span> from <span>wires</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can see at <span>least</span> <span>four</span> <span>lines</span> of <span>umbrellas</span> <span>hanging</span> down in this way, but there could be even more.<br/>
🎧 Maybe this is some <span>sort</span> of <span>art</span> <span>project</span>.<br/>
🎧 It might also be a <span>festival</span> or <span>tradition</span>, that people <span>decorate</span> the <span>street</span> with <span>colourful</span> <span>umbrellas</span> like this.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> the <span>picture</span> was taken in a <span>city</span> or <span>town</span>, though I can't tell where exactly.<br/>
🎧 <span>Perhaps</span> the <span>photographer</span> was a <span>tourist</span>, and was just <span>walking</span> around the <span>city</span> when he saw this amazing and <span>strange</span> <span>scene</span>.<br/>
🎧 Alright, now it's your <span>turn</span>.<br/>
🎧 We'll give you a new <span>picture</span>:<br/>
🎧 <span>Pause</span> the <span>video</span> and try to make a <span>longer</span> answer, like we just did.<br/>
🎧 <span>Follow</span> the same <span>structure</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Finished</span>?<br/>
🎧 I don't think so!<br/>
🎧 You should <span>practise</span> as much as you can.<br/>
🎧 Take the other <span>pictures</span> from the <span>lesson</span>, and make <span>longer</span> <span>answers</span> about them, too.<br/>
🎧 <span>Practise</span> your <span>answers</span> <span>several</span> <span>times</span>, until you can do it <span>fluently</span> and <span>comfortably</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you want, you can leave one of your <span>answers</span> in the <span>comments</span> and we'll give you <span>feedback</span> on your English.<br/>
