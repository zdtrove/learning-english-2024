🎧 Hi, I'm <span>Gina</span>. <span>Welcome</span> to <span>Oxford</span> Online English.<br/>
🎧 In this <span>lesson</span>, you can learn how to talk about your <span>vacation</span> in English.<br/>
🎧 Where did you go for your last <span>holiday</span>?<br/>
🎧 What did you do there?<br/>
🎧 Did you have a good time?<br/>
🎧 In this <span>lesson</span>, you'll learn how to answer these <span>questions</span> and more in <span>clear</span>, <span>natural</span> English.<br/>
🎧 Did you <span>notice</span> how <span>Jack</span> says <span>'holiday'</span>, but I said <span>'vacation'</span>?<br/>
🎧 This is a <span>difference</span> between <span>British</span> and <span>American</span> English.<br/>
🎧 Both <span>words</span> have the same <span>meaning</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's start with some simple <span>language</span> you can use to start your answer.<br/>
🎧 <span>Begin</span> your answer by saying where you went, who with and how long for.<br/>
🎧 For example:<br/>
🎧 I went to the <span>countryside</span> with my <span>family</span> for a <span>couple</span> of <span>weeks</span>.<br/>
🎧 I went to <span>Thailand</span> with a group of friends for ten <span>days</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>girlfriend</span> and I went to <span>Rome</span> for a long weekend.<br/>
🎧 A long weekend <span>means</span> you go for <span>three</span> or <span>four</span> <span>days</span>, usually <span>Friday-Monday</span> or <span>Saturday-Monday</span>, maybe because there's a <span>public</span> <span>holiday</span> on the <span>Monday</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about you?<br/>
🎧 Where did you go for your last <span>vacation</span>?<br/>
🎧 Who did you go with, and how long for?<br/>
🎧 <span>Pause</span> the <span>video</span> and make your own <span>sentence</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you want <span>extra</span> practice, <span>write</span> your <span>sentence</span> down.<br/>
🎧 If you really want <span>extra</span> practice, <span>write</span> down <span>three</span> different <span>sentences</span>!<br/>
🎧 Okay?<br/>
🎧 Next, let's see how you can talk about what you did on your <span>holiday</span>.<br/>
🎧 What do you like doing on <span>holiday</span>?<br/>
🎧 Do you <span>prefer</span> a more <span>active</span> <span>holiday</span>, maybe with lots of <span>adventure</span> <span>sports</span> and <span>activities</span>, or would you rather do something more <span>cultural</span>?<br/>
🎧 Or, maybe you just like <span>relaxing</span> on the <span>beach</span>.<br/>
🎧 Whatever you <span>prefer</span>, it's good if you can say something about how you <span>spent</span> your time on <span>holiday</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's look at some <span>examples</span> and some good <span>vocabulary</span> for you to use:<br/>
🎧 I went to the <span>countryside</span> with my <span>family</span> for a <span>couple</span> of <span>weeks</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mostly</span>, we went <span>hiking</span> in the <span>hills</span> and <span>mountains</span> <span>nearby</span>.<br/>
🎧 We also just <span>hung</span> out in the <span>village</span>, playing <span>cards</span> and <span>eating</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you like <span>hiking</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Hiking</span> <span>means</span> going for <span>longer</span> <span>walks</span>, often in the <span>hills</span> or the <span>mountains</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you <span>hang</span> out, you <span>spend</span> time without having any <span>particular</span> <span>goal</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you say we just <span>hung</span> out in the <span>village</span>, you mean that you <span>spent</span> time there in a <span>relaxed</span> way.<br/>
🎧 Let's look at our second example:<br/>
🎧 I went to <span>Thailand</span> with a group of friends for ten <span>days</span>.<br/>
🎧 We did some <span>sightseeing</span> in <span>Bangkok</span>: the <span>Grand</span> <span>Palace</span>, <span>Wat</span> <span>Pho</span> and so on.<br/>
🎧 Then we hit the <span>beaches</span> in <span>Krabi</span> for some sun, <span>swimming</span> and <span>cocktails</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Sightseeing</span> <span>means</span> <span>visiting</span> the famous <span>places</span> in a <span>city</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can go <span>sightseeing</span> or do <span>sightseeing</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, if you go <span>sightseeing</span> in <span>Paris</span>, you'd probably visit the <span>Eiffel</span> <span>Tower</span>, <span>the<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Louvre</span>, <span>Notre</span> <span>Dame</span> and so on.<br/>
🎧 Saying we hit the <span>beaches</span> is a very <span>informal</span> way of saying we went to the <span>beaches</span>.<br/>
🎧 You could also say we hit the <span>bars</span> or we hit the <span>clubs</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Using</span> hit <span>suggests</span> you're going somewhere to <span>party</span> and have a good time, so you probably wouldn't use it with other <span>places</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's do one more example together:<br/>
🎧 My <span>boyfriend</span> and I went to <span>Rome</span> for a long weekend.<br/>
🎧 We went on a <span>walking</span> <span>tour</span> of the <span>centre</span> and the <span>Vatican</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mostly</span>, we went to <span>restaurants</span> and <span>cafes</span> and <span>sampled</span> as much of the <span>local</span> <span>cuisine</span> as we could fit in our <span>stomachs</span>!<br/>
🎧 If you go on a <span>tour</span>, for example a <span>walking</span> <span>tour</span>, you pay for a <span>guide</span>.<br/>
🎧 Often, <span>tours</span> are in big <span>groups</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you <span>prefer</span> to go on a <span>tour</span> with a <span>guide</span>, or do you like to <span>explore</span> by yourself?<br/>
🎧 <span>Sample</span> <span>means</span> to try many different things.<br/>
🎧 We <span>sampled</span> as much of the <span>local</span> <span>cuisine</span> as we could <span>means</span> that we <span>tried</span> many different <span>dishes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Alright, over to you!<br/>
🎧 What did you do on your last <span>holiday</span>?<br/>
🎧 Did you go <span>hiking</span> in the <span>mountains</span>, go <span>sightseeing</span>, or <span>sample</span> lots of <span>delicious</span> food?<br/>
🎧 Try to make two or <span>three</span> <span>sentences</span>.<br/>
🎧 Use the <span>language</span> from this <span>section</span> if you can.<br/>
🎧 <span>Pause</span> the <span>video</span> now and make your answer.<br/>
🎧 Next, let's see how you can <span>describe</span> the place you <span>visited</span> in more <span>detail</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can you think of <span>three</span> <span>adjectives</span> to <span>describe</span> where you went for your last <span>vacation</span>?<br/>
🎧 Here, try to <span>avoid</span> <span>general</span> <span>adjectives</span> like nice or good.<br/>
🎧 Try to find <span>specific</span> <span>adjectives</span>.<br/>
🎧 Your answer will be more <span>interesting</span>!<br/>
🎧 Let's look at an example:<br/>
🎧 I went to the <span>countryside</span> with my <span>family</span> for a <span>couple</span> of <span>weeks</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>stayed</span> in a very nice <span>village</span> <span>surrounded</span> by nice <span>mountain</span> <span>scenery</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you see what we mean?<br/>
🎧 Saying nice doesn't say much.<br/>
🎧 This isn't a very good example.<br/>
🎧 How could you make it better?<br/>
🎧 Here's one way to <span>improve</span> it:<br/>
🎧 I went to the <span>countryside</span> with my <span>family</span> for a <span>couple</span> of <span>weeks</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>stayed</span> in a very <span>picturesque</span>, <span>sleepy</span> <span>village</span> <span>surrounded</span> by some <span>dramatic</span> <span>mountain</span> <span>scenery</span>.<br/>
🎧 What do you think <span>dramatic</span> <span>scenery</span> <span>means</span>?<br/>
🎧 It <span>means</span> the <span>mountains</span> were very <span>impressive</span> and <span>beautiful</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Picturesque</span> is another way to say <span>‘beautiful'</span>.<br/>
🎧 If something is <span>picturesque</span>, it's <span>beautiful</span> like a <span>painting</span>.<br/>
🎧 So you can use <span>picturesque</span> to talk about <span>scenery</span> and <span>places</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sleepy</span> <span>means</span> that the <span>village</span> was very <span>quiet</span> and <span>peaceful</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can see that <span>using</span> more <span>specific</span> <span>adjectives</span> like <span>picturesque</span>, <span>sleepy</span> or <span>dramatic</span> makes your answer more <span>interesting</span> and <span>expressive</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course, you'll need different <span>language</span> to talk about different <span>places</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's look at another example:<br/>
🎧 I went to <span>Thailand</span> with a group of friends for ten <span>days</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Bangkok</span> is a very <span>cosmopolitan</span> place but it could be a little <span>overwhelming</span> because there was so much going on!<br/>
🎧 Then we went to <span>Krabi</span>, which has some <span>stunning</span> <span>beaches</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you know the <span>meaning</span> of the key <span>words</span> in this answer?<br/>
🎧 <span>Cosmopolitan</span> <span>describes</span> a <span>city</span> which has many different people and <span>cultures</span> <span>mixed</span> together.<br/>
🎧 <span>Overwhelming</span> <span>describes</span> something which is very <span>intense</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, a <span>city</span> can be <span>overwhelming</span> if there are lots of people, <span>noises</span>, <span>sights</span> and <span>smells</span> all around you.<br/>
🎧 There's so much to take in that you don't know where to look!<br/>
🎧 <span>Stunning</span> <span>means</span> <span>‘very</span> <span>beautiful'</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's do one more example together:<br/>
🎧 My <span>girlfriend</span> and I went to <span>Rome</span> for a long weekend.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>fascinating</span> place but it's quite <span>touristy</span>, too.<br/>
🎧 The best thing was the food, which was out of this <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 Here, we used the <span>adjectives</span> <span>fascinating</span>, <span>touristy</span> and out of this <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 Could you <span>explain</span> what these mean?<br/>
🎧 <span>Fascinating</span> <span>means</span> <span>‘very</span> <span>interesting'</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Touristy</span> <span>describes</span> a place where <span>tourism</span> has <span>grown</span> too much.<br/>
🎧 Often, if you <span>describe</span> a place as <span>touristy</span>, you mean that it's <span>lost</span> some of its <span>original</span> <span>atmosphere</span>.<br/>
🎧 Finally, if you <span>describe</span> something as out of this <span>world</span>, you mean it's really good and you <span>enjoyed</span> it very much.<br/>
🎧 Now, it's your <span>turn</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can you <span>describe</span> the place you <span>visited</span> on your last <span>vacation</span>?<br/>
🎧 You can use the <span>adjectives</span> and <span>language</span> from this <span>section</span>, or you can find your own <span>words</span> and <span>phrases</span>.<br/>
🎧 Try to use at <span>least</span> <span>three</span> <span>interesting</span> <span>adjectives</span> in your answer.<br/>
🎧 <span>Pause</span> the <span>video</span> and do it now, either <span>speaking</span> or <span>writing</span>.<br/>
🎧 How was that?<br/>
🎧 Remember that you can always <span>review</span> a <span>section</span> if you <span>found</span> something <span>difficult</span>.<br/>
🎧 Next, how can you talk about what you <span>liked</span> or <span>disliked</span> on your <span>vacation</span>?<br/>
🎧 What's the best <span>vacation</span> you've ever had?<br/>
🎧 What about the <span>worst</span> <span>vacation</span> you've ever been on?<br/>
🎧 What made these <span>holidays</span> so good or so bad?<br/>
🎧 Let's see how you can talk about the <span>positives</span> and <span>negatives</span> of your <span>holiday</span>.<br/>
🎧 Here's our first example:<br/>
🎧 I went to the <span>countryside</span> with my <span>family</span> for a <span>couple</span> of <span>weeks</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>relaxing</span> but by the end I was getting quite <span>bored</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is good, but it's always better to add a <span>reason</span> if you can:<br/>
🎧 I went to the <span>countryside</span> with my <span>family</span> for a <span>couple</span> of <span>weeks</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>relaxing</span> but by the end I was getting quite <span>bored</span>, because each day was <span>pretty</span> <span>similar</span>.<br/>
🎧 What does that mean, each day was <span>pretty</span> <span>similar</span>?<br/>
🎧 Do you know?<br/>
🎧 It <span>means</span> that you did the same kind of things each day, so there wasn't much <span>variety</span> from one day to the next.<br/>
🎧 Let's look at our next example:<br/>
🎧 I went to <span>Thailand</span> with a group of friends for ten <span>days</span>.<br/>
🎧 I loved <span>Krabi</span>, because it was like <span>nowhere</span> I'd ever been before.<br/>
🎧 I wasn't so <span>keen</span> on <span>Bangkok</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>cool</span> place but it's a bit big and <span>noisy</span> for my <span>tastes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Saying it was like <span>nowhere</span> I'd ever been before <span>means</span> that the place you went to was really <span>unique</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can use I wasn't so <span>keen</span> <span>on…</span> to talk about something you didn't like very much in the <span>past</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example:<br/>
🎧 I wasn't so <span>keen</span> on the food in the <span>hotel</span>.<br/>
🎧 I wasn't so <span>keen</span> on the <span>museums—I</span> didn't think they were very <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Adding</span> for my <span>tastes</span> after you give your <span>opinion</span> <span>shows</span> that this is just your <span>perspective</span>.<br/>
🎧 You would use it after you give a <span>negative</span> <span>opinion</span>, to <span>soften</span> your idea <span>slightly</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example:<br/>
🎧 It's a nice <span>area</span>, but it's too <span>developed</span> and <span>touristy</span> for my <span>tastes</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Adding</span> for my <span>tastes</span> makes this sound <span>slightly</span> <span>softer</span> and less <span>direct</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, let's do one more example together:<br/>
🎧 My <span>girlfriend</span> and I went to <span>Rome</span> for a long weekend.<br/>
🎧 I think I <span>liked</span> the <span>general</span> <span>atmosphere</span> most of all.<br/>
🎧 <span>Walking</span> around the little <span>streets</span> in the <span>centre</span> <span>felt</span> like being in an old <span>film</span>.<br/>
🎧 I wish it had been less <span>crowded</span>, though.<br/>
🎧 Here, you can use the <span>phrase</span> I <span>liked</span> <span>…</span> most of all to talk about your <span>favourite</span> thing from your <span>vacation</span>.<br/>
🎧 Use I wish <span>plus</span> the <span>past</span> perfect <span>(had</span> <span>done)</span> to talk about something in the <span>past</span> which you would change if you could.<br/>
🎧 For example:<br/>
🎧 I wish we'd had more time to <span>explore</span> the <span>city</span>.<br/>
🎧 I wish we hadn't <span>stayed</span> in that <span>awful</span> <span>hotel</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, your <span>turn</span> again!<br/>
🎧 What did you like and <span>dislike</span> about your last <span>holiday</span>?<br/>
🎧 Make at <span>least</span> two or <span>three</span> <span>sentences</span>, and say them out <span>loud</span>.<br/>
🎧 Remember to give <span>reasons</span> to <span>support</span> your <span>ideas</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, you should be ready to put everything together into a <span>longer</span> answer.<br/>
🎧 To make a <span>longer</span> answer, you need to:<br/>
🎧 Say where you went, who with, and for how long.<br/>
🎧 Say what you did.<br/>
🎧 <span>Describe</span> the place.<br/>
🎧 Talk about what you <span>liked</span> and <span>disliked</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's do an example <span>using</span> <span>language</span> from the <span>lesson</span>:<br/>
🎧 I went to <span>Thailand</span> with a group of friends for ten <span>days</span>.<br/>
🎧 We did some <span>sightseeing</span> in <span>Bangkok</span>: the <span>Grand</span> <span>Palace</span>, <span>Wat</span> <span>Pho</span> and so on.<br/>
🎧 Then we hit the <span>beaches</span> in <span>Krabi</span> for some sun, <span>swimming</span> and <span>cocktails</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Bangkok</span> is a very <span>cosmopolitan</span> place but it could be a little <span>overwhelming</span> because there was so much going on!<br/>
🎧 <span>Krabi</span> has some <span>stunning</span> <span>beaches</span>, and I loved it there, because it was like <span>nowhere</span> I'd ever been before.<br/>
🎧 On the other <span>hand</span>, I wasn't so <span>keen</span> on <span>Bangkok</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>cool</span> place but it's a bit big and <span>noisy</span> for my <span>tastes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you see how <span>using</span> simple <span>phrases</span> and <span>ideas</span>, you can <span>build</span> a full, <span>clear</span>, <span>detailed</span> answer?<br/>
🎧 We've <span>added</span> some <span>linking</span> <span>words</span>, but <span>otherwise</span> this is only <span>using</span> <span>language</span> you've <span>seen</span> in this <span>lesson</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's do one more example.<br/>
🎧 This time, we'll use <span>original</span> <span>ideas</span>:<br/>
🎧 I went to <span>Siberia</span> by myself for <span>three</span> <span>weeks</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>travelled</span> around, did some <span>hiking</span> and <span>camping</span>, and <span>explored</span> the <span>countryside</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was near <span>Lake</span> <span>Baikal</span>, which is a <span>huge</span> <span>lake</span> with <span>mountains</span> and <span>villages</span> <span>dotted</span> around the <span>sides</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>beautiful</span> in a <span>wild</span> way, and the <span>emptiness</span> gave me a <span>real</span> feeling of <span>isolation</span> and <span>solitude</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>liked</span> the people I <span>met—everyone</span> was so open and <span>welcoming</span>.<br/>
🎧 On the other <span>hand</span>, even though it was <span>summer</span>, the <span>nights</span> were so <span>cold</span>!<br/>
🎧 I wish I'd taken a <span>warmer</span> <span>sleeping</span> bag.<br/>
🎧 This time, I'm <span>using</span> different <span>ideas</span> and some different <span>language</span>, but I'm still <span>following</span> the same <span>structure</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, can you make a <span>longer</span> answer like these?<br/>
🎧 Try it!<br/>
🎧 If it's <span>difficult</span>, <span>review</span> the <span>video</span> or use a <span>dictionary</span> to get the <span>vocabulary</span> you need.<br/>
🎧 <span>Practise</span> your answer <span>several</span> <span>times</span>, until you can do it <span>fluently</span> and <span>comfortably</span>.<br/>
🎧 You could also talk about other <span>vacations</span> you had, not just the last one.<br/>
🎧 If you want <span>feedback</span> on your answer, put it in the <span>comments</span>.<br/>
🎧 We'll give you <span>feedback</span> and show you how you can <span>improve</span>.<br/>
