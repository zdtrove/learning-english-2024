🎧 Hello, I'm <span>Michael</span>. <span>Welcome</span> to <span>Oxford</span> Online English.<br/>
🎧 In this <span>lesson</span>, you'll learn how to talk about the <span>weather</span> in English.<br/>
🎧 Do you know what it <span>means</span> if <span>someone</span> says <span>'it's</span> <span>chucking</span> it down <span>today'</span>?<br/>
🎧 If <span>someone</span> says <span>'it's</span> <span>baking</span> <span>today'</span>, do you know what they are talking about?<br/>
🎧 In this class, you'll learn <span>words</span>, <span>phrases</span> and <span>idioms</span> that you can use to <span>describe</span> different <span>kinds</span> of <span>weather</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>British</span> people are famous for talking about the <span>weather</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you know why?<br/>
🎧 It's because in the <span>UK</span> we have a lot of <span>weather</span>.<br/>
🎧 You never know what the <span>weather</span> will be like.<br/>
🎧 You can have all <span>four</span> <span>seasons</span> in one day.<br/>
🎧 We are going to look at a <span>typical</span> <span>British</span> day, so the <span>weather</span> is going to be very <span>changeable</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>means</span> that <span>weather</span> can change quickly and <span>unpredictably</span>.<br/>
🎧 It can be <span>sunny</span>, and then <span>30</span> <span>minutes</span> later, it will start <span>snowing</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, first we <span>wake</span> up and it is a bit <span>cold</span>.<br/>
🎧 How would we <span>describe</span> this?<br/>
🎧 I could say that it's a bit <span>chilly</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>means</span> that it's a little <span>cold</span>.<br/>
🎧 Not very <span>cold</span>, just a little <span>cold</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Autumn</span> <span>mornings</span> are often <span>chilly</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>chilly</span> <span>weather</span>, you might want a <span>light</span> <span>jacket</span>, but you won't need a <span>heavy</span> <span>coat</span>, or a <span>scarf</span>, or anything like that.<br/>
🎧 But what if it's very <span>cold</span>?<br/>
🎧 You could say that it's <span>freezing</span>.<br/>
🎧 You might say that you can see your <span>breath</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Freezing</span> <span>means</span> that it is very <span>cold</span>.<br/>
🎧 Not just <span>chilly</span>, but very <span>cold</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Antarctica</span> is <span>freezing</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Northern</span> <span>Canada</span> in <span>winter</span> is <span>freezing</span>.<br/>
🎧 To see your <span>breath</span> <span>means</span> that you can <span>literally</span> see the air when you <span>breathe</span> on it.<br/>
🎧 Usually if you can see your <span>breath</span> it is <span>freezing</span>.<br/>
🎧 If the <span>weather</span> is so <span>freezing</span> that you can see your <span>breath</span> you probably will need to <span>bundle</span> up.<br/>
🎧 <span>Bundle</span> up <span>means</span> to <span>wear</span> <span>layers</span> of <span>clothes</span> to keep yourself <span>warm</span>.<br/>
🎧 When the <span>weather</span> is <span>freezing</span> you need to <span>bundle</span> up.<br/>
🎧 On <span>freezing</span> <span>mornings</span>, it can be very, very <span>difficult</span> to get out of bed.<br/>
🎧 But let's <span>imagine</span> that we get up because we have to go to work.<br/>
🎧 So we leave the house and it's <span>drizzling</span> at the <span>moment</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Drizzling</span> <span>means</span> that it is <span>raining</span> <span>lightly</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's not <span>heavy</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Drizzle</span> is so <span>light</span> that it can look like <span>mist</span>.<br/>
🎧 We can also say that it is only <span>spitting</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Spitting</span> is even <span>lighter</span> than <span>drizzling</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>means</span> that a few <span>raindrops</span> are <span>falling</span>, but it isn't really <span>raining</span>.<br/>
🎧 Before it <span>rains</span>, it might start <span>spitting</span> and then get <span>heavier</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then, <span>suddenly</span> the <span>heavens</span> open.<br/>
🎧 This <span>means</span> that it <span>starts</span> <span>raining</span> <span>heavily</span>.<br/>
🎧 How else could I <span>describe</span> it if it is <span>raining</span> a lot?<br/>
🎧 I could say that it is <span>chucking</span> it down.<br/>
🎧 This <span>means</span> that it is <span>raining</span> a lot.<br/>
🎧 It is really <span>heavy</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is the <span>type</span> of <span>rain</span> that people find it <span>difficult</span> to drive in or <span>walk</span> in.<br/>
🎧 As I am <span>walking</span> to work my <span>clothes</span> are getting <span>soaked</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>means</span> that my <span>clothes</span> are very wet because of the <span>rain</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Luckily</span> I <span>bought</span> my <span>umbrella</span> today.<br/>
🎧 So we get to work, only a little <span>damp</span> from the <span>rain</span> thanks to the <span>umbrella</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Damp</span> <span>means</span> that something is <span>slightly</span> wet.<br/>
🎧 My <span>clothes</span> are a little wet because of the <span>rain</span>.<br/>
🎧 And from my <span>window</span> I can see that it's very <span>overcast</span> and <span>dark</span> <span>overhead</span>.<br/>
🎧 To say that it is <span>overcast</span> <span>means</span> that the <span>clouds</span> are <span>covering</span> the sky.<br/>
🎧 You <span>cannot</span> see the sun.<br/>
🎧 When it is <span>dark</span> <span>overhead</span> you are saying that the <span>clouds</span> are very <span>black</span>.<br/>
🎧 Most <span>likely</span> this is because it is <span>raining</span> or going to <span>rain</span> soon.<br/>
🎧 So it is <span>dark</span> <span>overhead</span> and <span>overcast</span>.<br/>
🎧 You think there's going to be a <span>storm</span>.<br/>
🎧 You could say that there is a <span>storm</span> <span>brewing</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>means</span> that you think a <span>storm</span> will start very soon.<br/>
🎧 You're sure there's going to be a <span>storm;</span> you can see it in the sky.<br/>
🎧 And then you see <span>lightning</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Lightning</span> is a large <span>electric</span> <span>flash</span> of <span>light</span>.<br/>
🎧 And after the <span>lightning</span> you hear <span>thunder</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Thunder</span> is the <span>noise</span> that you hear <span>caused</span> by <span>lightning</span>.<br/>
🎧 Usually you will hear <span>thunder</span> after you see <span>lightning</span>.<br/>
🎧 We call these <span>storms</span> <span>thunderstorms</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Thunderstorms</span> are <span>storms</span> that have <span>lightning</span>, <span>thunder</span> and it is also <span>chucking</span> it down as well.<br/>
🎧 When the <span>storm</span> <span>starts</span>, the <span>wind</span> <span>picks</span> up.<br/>
🎧 Soon, it's almost a <span>gale</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>wind</span> <span>picks</span> up when the <span>wind</span> <span>becomes</span> <span>stronger</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>gale</span> is a very <span>strong</span> <span>wind</span>, which can be <span>dangerous</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Lucky</span> for you when it is time to go home the <span>storm</span> has <span>finished</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is now <span>sunny</span> and hot.<br/>
🎧 You won't need your <span>umbrella</span> <span>anymore</span>.<br/>
🎧 You <span>walk</span> outside and there isn't a <span>cloud</span> in the sky and it is <span>baking</span> hot.<br/>
🎧 This <span>means</span> that it is very hot.<br/>
🎧 It is <span>baking</span> hot in the <span>Sahara</span> <span>Desert</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>completely</span> still.<br/>
🎧 That <span>means</span> there's no <span>wind</span> at all.<br/>
🎧 We can also say that it is a <span>scorcher</span> today.<br/>
🎧 This also <span>means</span> that it is <span>extremely</span> hot.<br/>
🎧 In <span>Australia</span>, most <span>days</span> in the <span>summer</span> could be <span>described</span> as <span>scorchers</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another way to say this is to say that it is <span>boiling</span>.<br/>
🎧 So if the <span>temperature</span> is very hot we can say that it is <span>baking</span> hot, a <span>scorcher</span> or <span>boiling</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>walk</span> home from work is a lot better than your <span>walk</span> to work this morning in the <span>rain</span>.<br/>
🎧 So you get home and <span>watch</span> the <span>weather</span> <span>forecast</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>weather</span> <span>forecast</span> is the <span>prediction</span> for the next day or week of what the <span>weather</span> will be like.<br/>
🎧 The <span>weather</span> <span>forecast</span> tells you that <span>tomorrow</span> it will <span>begin</span> with a bit of <span>frost</span> on the <span>ground</span> and it will be <span>sleeting</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>afternoon</span> there will be <span>flurry</span> of <span>snow</span> but then it will <span>turn</span> into a <span>blizzard</span> by the <span>evening</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>snow</span> on the <span>floor</span> will <span>turn</span> into <span>slush</span>.<br/>
🎧 It will be <span>below</span> <span>freezing</span> for most of the day.<br/>
🎧 What does this mean?<br/>
🎧 It will <span>begin</span> with a bit of <span>frost</span> on the <span>ground</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Frost</span> are ice <span>crystals</span> on a <span>frozen</span> <span>surface</span>.<br/>
🎧 When it is <span>freezing</span> the <span>ground</span> may be <span>covered</span> in <span>frost</span>.<br/>
🎧 Usually in <span>winter</span> in the <span>UK</span> we have very <span>frosty</span> <span>mornings</span>.<br/>
🎧 And it will be <span>sleeting</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sleet</span> is <span>rain</span> and <span>snow</span> <span>mixed</span> together.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sleet</span> <span>happens</span> when <span>snow</span> <span>melts</span> as it <span>falls</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>afternoon</span> there will be a <span>flurry</span> of <span>snow</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>flurry</span> of <span>snow</span> <span>means</span> that there will be <span>light</span> <span>snow</span> for a short time.<br/>
🎧 It won't be <span>heavy</span> and it usually doesn't <span>stay</span> on the <span>ground</span>.<br/>
🎧 But it will <span>turn</span> into a <span>blizzard</span> by the <span>evening</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>blizzard</span> is a <span>storm</span> with lots of <span>snow</span> and <span>wind</span>.<br/>
🎧 Usually <span>planes</span> can't take off or <span>land</span> when there is a <span>heavy</span> <span>blizzard</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>snow</span> on the <span>floor</span> will <span>turn</span> into <span>slush</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Slush</span> is <span>snow</span> or ice that has <span>partly</span> <span>melted</span>.<br/>
🎧 Usually <span>snow</span> will <span>turn</span> into <span>slush</span> when the <span>weather</span> <span>gets</span> <span>warmer</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Walking</span> in <span>slush</span> is very <span>unpleasant</span>, because <span>cold</span> water will get into your <span>shoes</span>!<br/>
🎧 It will be <span>below</span> <span>freezing</span> for most of the day.<br/>
🎧 When we say it is <span>below</span> <span>freezing</span> we are saying that the <span>temperature</span> is <span>below</span> <span>0°C</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>means</span> that it's <span>freezing</span>.<br/>
🎧 So I'll probably want to <span>bundle</span> up <span>tomorrow</span>!<br/>
🎧 So what have we <span>learnt</span> today?<br/>
🎧 We have <span>learned</span> that <span>Britain's</span> <span>weather</span> is very <span>changeable</span> and <span>hopefully</span> we have <span>learned</span> how to <span>describe</span> the <span>weather</span> in more <span>detail</span> <span>using</span> <span>phrases</span> and <span>expressions</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks very much for watching!<br/>
🎧 I hope that you have <span>found</span> it <span>useful</span>.<br/>
