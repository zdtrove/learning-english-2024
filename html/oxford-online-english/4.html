🎧 Hello, I'm <span>Oli</span>. <span>Welcome</span> to <span>Oxford</span> Online English!<br/>
🎧 In this <span>lesson</span>, you can learn about how to talk about your home in English.<br/>
🎧 Where do you live?<br/>
🎧 What's your home like?<br/>
🎧 What about your <span>neighbourhood</span>?<br/>
🎧 Talking about where you live is a <span>common</span> <span>conversation</span> <span>topic</span> in English.<br/>
🎧 So it's good to have some things to say.<br/>
🎧 <span>Part</span> one: <span>introducing</span> where you live and talking about <span>types</span> of home.<br/>
🎧 Let's start with a simple <span>sentence</span>.<br/>
🎧 I live in <span>a..</span>. what could you put there?<br/>
🎧 You could say, I live in a house, I live in an <span>apartment</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>Britain</span>, people sometimes say, <span>Flat</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>'Flat'</span> and <span>'apartment'</span> have the same <span>meaning</span>.<br/>
🎧 Next, let's add a bit more <span>detail</span>.<br/>
🎧 What kind of house or <span>apartment</span> is it?<br/>
🎧 For example, I live in a small, <span>two-stoery</span> house in the <span>suburbs</span>.<br/>
🎧 When we say how many <span>floors</span> a <span>building</span> has, we usually use the <span>word</span> <span>storey</span>, so you can say a <span>two-storey</span> house, a <span>four-storey</span> <span>apartment</span> <span>building</span> and so on.<br/>
🎧 I live in an <span>apartment</span> on the <span>third</span> <span>floor</span> of a <span>four-storey</span> <span>building</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are many different <span>kinds</span> of house and <span>apartment</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, do you live in a <span>terraced</span> house, a <span>semi-detached</span> house, or a <span>detached</span> house?<br/>
🎧 <span>Terraced</span> <span>houses</span> have other <span>houses</span> on both <span>sides</span>, a <span>semi-detached</span> house has another house just on one side, and a <span>detached</span> house <span>stands</span> by <span>itself</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Detached</span> <span>houses</span> are usually <span>larger</span> and more <span>expensive</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Terraced</span> <span>houses</span> are usually <span>smaller</span> and <span>cheaper</span>.<br/>
🎧 What <span>kinds</span> of <span>houses</span> are more <span>common</span> in your <span>country</span>?<br/>
🎧 What about <span>apartments</span>?<br/>
🎧 Many <span>apartments</span> are in <span>apartment</span> <span>buildings</span>.<br/>
🎧 Easy enough, right?<br/>
🎧 If you live in a very <span>tall</span> <span>apartment</span> <span>building</span> with many <span>floors</span>, you can say you live in a <span>high-rise</span> in <span>American</span> English or a <span>tower</span> <span>block</span> in <span>British</span> English.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes a house is <span>divided</span> into <span>apartments</span>, these are called <span>converted</span> <span>apartments</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Apartments</span> come in many different <span>sizes</span>, if an <span>apartment</span> just has one room which is a <span>bedroom</span> and living room together, it's called a <span>studio</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course, you can also have <span>bigger</span> <span>apartments</span>, a <span>two-bedroom</span> <span>apartment</span>, a <span>three-bedroom</span> <span>apartment</span> and so on.<br/>
🎧 Large <span>apartments</span> might be <span>duplex</span> <span>apartments</span>, this <span>means</span> the <span>apartment</span> has more than one <span>floor</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about you? Where do you live?<br/>
🎧 Do you live in a house or an <span>apartment</span>?<br/>
🎧 Could you make a <span>sentence</span> <span>using</span> the <span>vocabulary</span> from this <span>section</span>?<br/>
🎧 For example, I live in a <span>two-story</span> <span>terraced</span> house.<br/>
🎧 I live in an <span>apartment</span> on the <span>28th</span> <span>floor</span> of a <span>high-rise</span> <span>building</span>.<br/>
🎧 I live in a <span>converted</span> <span>studio</span> <span>apartment</span>.<br/>
🎧 Next, let's see how you can <span>describe</span> the inside of your home in more <span>detail</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you want to <span>describe</span> your home, what can you talk about?<br/>
🎧 Well, you could start by saying what <span>rooms</span> it has.<br/>
🎧 For example, My house has two <span>bedrooms</span>, a <span>kitchen</span>, a living room, and a garden.<br/>
🎧 It's always better to add <span>adjectives</span> or <span>details</span> to make your <span>speaking</span> more <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's try: My house has two small <span>bedrooms</span>, a <span>kitchen</span> with a <span>dining</span> <span>table</span>, a living room with big <span>windows</span>, and a small garden.<br/>
🎧 What other <span>rooms</span> might you have in your home?<br/>
🎧 You could have a <span>dining</span> room for people to eat together.<br/>
🎧 Maybe you have an <span>office</span> or a <span>study</span> where you can work, if you live in a <span>warmer</span> <span>country</span>, you might have a <span>balcony</span> or a <span>terrace</span> where you can sit outside in <span>warmer</span> <span>weather</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about your home? What does it have?<br/>
🎧 Does your home have a garden, a <span>balcony</span>, or another <span>outdoor</span> <span>area</span>?<br/>
🎧 Try to make a <span>sentence</span> <span>describing</span> your home.<br/>
🎧 For example, I live in a <span>two-bedroom</span> <span>apartment</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>bedrooms</span> are quite small, but there's a big living room with a <span>dining</span> <span>area</span>, a <span>modern</span> <span>kitchen</span>, and also a small <span>balcony</span> where we can sit outside in the <span>summer</span>.<br/>
🎧 What can you say about your home?<br/>
🎧 Okay, next, saying what you like or <span>dislike</span>.<br/>
🎧 So now you can <span>hopefully</span> <span>describe</span> your home a little bit, but what about your <span>opinion</span>?<br/>
🎧 What do you like about your home, and what would you change if you could?<br/>
🎧 <span>Positive</span> <span>words</span> you could use to <span>describe</span> your home <span>include</span> <span>'spacious'</span>, <span>meaning</span> large with lots of <span>room;</span> <span>'cosy'</span> which <span>means</span> <span>comfortable</span> in a <span>warm</span> <span>welcoming</span> <span>way;</span> <span>'light'</span> <span>describes</span> a home which <span>gets</span> lot of <span>natural</span> <span>light</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can say your home is <span>'warm'</span> or <span>'cool'</span>, <span>meaning</span> that it's <span>comfortable</span> in <span>winter</span> or in <span>summer</span>.<br/>
🎧 Finally, you can <span>describe</span> your home as <span>'convenient'</span>, <span>meaning</span> it's <span>close</span> to your <span>job</span>, it's <span>close</span> to the <span>shops</span>, it's <span>close</span> to your <span>children's</span> school and so on.<br/>
🎧 You can use <span>'convenient'</span> <span>plus</span> <span>'for.'<br/></span>
🎧 For example, it's <span>convenient</span> for the <span>subway</span>, or it's <span>convenient</span> for my <span>office</span>.<br/>
🎧 Could you use any of these <span>words</span> to <span>describe</span> your home?<br/>
🎧 Okay, but what if you don't like your home?<br/>
🎧 Well, here are some <span>words</span> you could use: <span>'cramped'</span> <span>means</span> your home is too small, so you don't have enough <span>space</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>'Dark'</span> <span>means</span> your home doesn't get enough <span>light</span>, so that even when it's <span>sunny</span> outside, it's still <span>dark</span> inside.<br/>
🎧 <span>'Drafty'</span> <span>means</span> <span>cold</span> air comes inside through the <span>windows</span> or through the <span>doors</span> in the <span>winter</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>'Stuffy'</span> <span>means</span> there's not enough air so it's very <span>uncomfortable</span> in hot <span>weather</span>.<br/>
🎧 You could say your home is <span>'noisy'</span>, for example if you live near a <span>main</span> <span>road</span>, your home might be <span>noisy</span> even at <span>night</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can you make a <span>sentence</span> about your home <span>using</span> some of these <span>words</span>?<br/>
🎧 For example, My home is <span>light</span> and <span>spacious</span>, but it can get very <span>drafty</span> in the <span>winter</span>.<br/>
🎧 I like my <span>apartment</span> because it's <span>cosy</span>, although it can be <span>noisy</span> because there's a <span>restaurant</span> just <span>downstairs</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, so now you can talk about your home and what you think of it.<br/>
🎧 What else can you say on this <span>topic</span>?<br/>
🎧 Let's look, <span>part</span> <span>four</span>: saying who you live with.<br/>
🎧 Who do you live with?<br/>
🎧 Do live with your <span>parents</span>, your <span>husband</span> or <span>wife</span>, with your <span>family</span>?<br/>
🎧 Do you live by yourself or do you live with <span>flatmates</span> <span>(people</span> who you share a <span>rented</span> <span>flat</span> <span>with)</span>?<br/>
🎧 Maybe you live with friends.<br/>
🎧 Let's look at <span>examples</span> of what you could say here.<br/>
🎧 I live with my <span>parents</span>.<br/>
🎧 I live in a <span>shared</span> <span>house;</span> I have <span>four</span> <span>flatmates</span>.<br/>
🎧 I live by myself.<br/>
🎧 What about you?<br/>
🎧 Okay, that was easy.<br/>
🎧 Let's look at one more <span>topic</span> you can talk about.<br/>
🎧 <span>Part</span> <span>five</span>: talking about your <span>neighbourhood</span>.<br/>
🎧 First, be <span>careful</span> with the <span>word</span> <span>'neighbourhood'</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>neighbourhood</span> is not a <span>person;</span> it's the <span>area</span> near your home.<br/>
🎧 So where is your home?<br/>
🎧 Is it in the <span>city</span> <span>centre</span>, the <span>suburbs</span>, or outside the <span>city</span>?<br/>
🎧 If you live outside the <span>city</span>, do you live on the <span>outskirts</span> of the <span>city</span>, in a <span>village</span>, or in the <span>middle</span> of <span>nowhere</span>?<br/>
🎧 How could you <span>describe</span> your <span>neighbourhood</span>?<br/>
🎧 Is it <span>quiet</span> or <span>lively</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Trendy</span> or <span>boring</span>?<br/>
🎧 Are there many <span>shops</span>, <span>cafes</span>, <span>bars</span>, <span>restaurants</span>?<br/>
🎧 Are there <span>parks</span> or <span>sports</span> <span>facilities</span>?<br/>
🎧 For example, you could say, I live in a very <span>lively</span> <span>area</span> just <span>south</span> of the <span>city</span> <span>center</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are many <span>cafes</span>, <span>shops</span>, and <span>places</span> to go.<br/>
🎧 Or, I live in a <span>quiet</span> <span>area</span> in the <span>suburbs</span>, in the <span>north</span> of the <span>city</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a nice <span>area</span> and it's <span>quiet</span>, but it's a bit <span>boring</span>.<br/>
🎧 There isn't really anything to do.<br/>
🎧 What about you?<br/>
🎧 Can you say something about your <span>neighborhood</span>?<br/>
🎧 Okay, finally let's put everything together.<br/>
🎧 If you can use everything we've <span>looked</span> at in this <span>lesson</span>, you should be able to speak very <span>clearly</span> and with lots of <span>details</span> about your home and where you live.<br/>
🎧 For example, I live in a <span>two-story</span> <span>terraced</span> house.<br/>
🎧 It has two <span>bedrooms</span>, a living room, a small <span>kitchen</span>, and a garden.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>cosy</span> and <span>convenient</span> for getting to work, but it's a bit <span>cramped</span>, <span>especially</span> when we have <span>guests</span>.<br/>
🎧 I live with my <span>wife</span> and <span>daughter</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our house is near the <span>city</span> <span>centre</span> in a <span>quiet</span> <span>neighborhood</span>.<br/>
🎧 There isn't much to do, but there are some small <span>shops</span> and a <span>park</span> where we go if the <span>weather's</span> nice.<br/>
🎧 Here's one more <span>sample</span> answer: I live by myself in a <span>studio</span> <span>apartment</span>.<br/>
🎧 It just has one <span>main</span> room with a <span>tiny</span> <span>kitchen</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's very <span>warm</span> in <span>winter</span>, but it can get a bit <span>stuffy</span> in <span>summer</span>.<br/>
🎧 I live in the <span>city</span> <span>center</span>, very <span>close</span> to everything.<br/>
🎧 It's very <span>lively</span>, with lots of <span>bars</span> and <span>restaurants</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a good place for young people to live, but not many <span>families</span> choose to live here.<br/>
🎧 What about you? Can you make an answer like this talking about where you live?<br/>
🎧 Try to use as much <span>language</span> from the <span>lesson</span> as you can.<br/>
🎧 Okay, that's the end of the <span>lesson</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks very much for watching.<br/>
🎧 You can see more of our free English <span>lessons</span> on our <span>website</span>, <span>oxfordonlineenglish.com</span>, but that's all.<br/>
🎧 Thanks again. I'll see you next time. <span>Bye-bye</span>!<br/>
