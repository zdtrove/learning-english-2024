🎧 Hi, I'm <span>Martin</span>. <span>Welcome</span> to <span>Oxford</span> Online English!<br/>
🎧 In this <span>lesson</span>, you can learn how to <span>describe</span> a person who you know in English.<br/>
🎧 Think about <span>someone</span> you know well.<br/>
🎧 It could be <span>someone</span> in your <span>family</span>, a <span>close</span> friend, <span>someone</span> you work with, or <span>someone</span> else.<br/>
🎧 How would you <span>describe</span> this person?<br/>
🎧 What does this person look like?<br/>
🎧 What kind of <span>personality</span> does this person have?<br/>
🎧 <span>Describing</span> a person is <span>useful</span> in many <span>situations</span>, <span>including</span> <span>speaking</span> <span>exams</span> like the <span>IELTS</span> <span>speaking</span> <span>test</span> or the <span>FCE</span> <span>speaking</span> <span>exam</span>.<br/>
🎧 In this <span>lesson</span>, you'll learn how to <span>describe</span> a person in <span>detail</span> <span>using</span> <span>clear</span>, <span>natural</span> English.<br/>
🎧 During this <span>lesson</span>, you're going to practice, so you need to think of <span>someone</span> you're going to <span>describe</span>.<br/>
🎧 It can be <span>anyone</span> you know well.<br/>
🎧 Got <span>someone</span>? Great! Let's <span>begin</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Part</span> one: <span>describing</span> <span>appearance</span>.<br/>
🎧 First <span>question</span>: what does he or she look like?<br/>
🎧 What can you say when <span>describing</span> a <span>person's</span> <span>appearance</span>?<br/>
🎧 You can talk about the <span>person's</span> <span>height</span> and <span>build</span>:<br/>
🎧 <span>Height</span> and <span>Build<br/></span>
🎧 My <span>brother</span> is <span>tall</span> and <span>well-built</span>.<br/>
🎧 My friend <span>Lia</span> is <span>medium</span> <span>height</span> and <span>slim</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Craig</span>, who I work with, is short and <span>overweight</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you know what <span>'well-built'</span> <span>means</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Someone</span> who is <span>well-built</span> is <span>broad</span> and <span>strong</span>, with big <span>muscles</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can also add <span>adverbs</span> to make your <span>sentences</span> more <span>precise</span>:<br/>
🎧 My <span>brother</span> is quite <span>tall</span> and <span>well-built</span>.<br/>
🎧 My friend <span>Lia</span> is <span>medium</span> <span>height</span> and really <span>slim</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Craig</span>, who I work with, is short and a little <span>overweight</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then, maybe add something about the <span>person's</span> <span>hair</span>:<br/>
🎧 <span>Hair<br/></span>
🎧 He has short, <span>brown</span> <span>hair</span>, but he's going <span>bald</span> <span>fast</span>.<br/>
🎧 She has long, <span>dark</span> <span>blonde</span> <span>hair</span>.<br/>
🎧 He has <span>curly</span>, <span>fair</span> <span>hair</span>.<br/>
🎧 What does <span>'fair'</span> mean here?<br/>
🎧 It's the <span>opposite</span> of <span>'dark'</span>, and you can use it to <span>describe</span> <span>someone's</span> <span>hair</span> or <span>skin</span>.<br/>
🎧 Finally, what else can you say about the <span>person's</span> <span>appearance</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Imagine</span> you're <span>describing</span> the person to me, and you want me to be able to <span>recognise</span> this person from your <span>description</span>.<br/>
🎧 What could you say?<br/>
🎧 There are many <span>possibilities</span>, of course, but here are a few <span>suggestions</span>:<br/>
🎧 <span>Face<br/></span>
🎧 He looks a bit like a <span>younger</span> <span>version</span> of <span>Vin</span> <span>Diesel</span>.<br/>
🎧 She's really <span>beautiful</span>, with very <span>striking</span> <span>features</span>.<br/>
🎧 He has a long <span>scar</span> on his right <span>elbow</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you know what <span>'striking</span> <span>features'</span> <span>means</span>?<br/>
🎧 In this <span>context</span>, <span>'features'</span> <span>refers</span> to <span>someone's</span> <span>face</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>'Striking'</span> <span>means</span> that you can't help <span>noticing</span> something.<br/>
🎧 So if <span>someone</span> has <span>'striking</span> <span>features'</span>, it <span>means</span> he or she has a very <span>unusual</span> and <span>attractive</span> <span>face</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about <span>'scar'</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Scars</span> are <span>left</span> over when you get a <span>deep</span> cut or have an <span>operation</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, so now you should be able to make <span>three</span> <span>sentences</span> about the person you're <span>describing</span>, like this:<br/>
🎧 My <span>brother</span> is quite <span>tall</span> and <span>well-built</span>.<br/>
🎧 He has short, <span>brown</span> <span>hair</span>, but he's going <span>bald</span> <span>fast</span>.<br/>
🎧 He looks a bit like a <span>younger</span> <span>version</span> of <span>Vin</span> <span>Diesel</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Positive</span> <span>adjectives<br/></span>
🎧 Your <span>turn</span>: <span>pause</span> the <span>video</span> and make <span>three</span> <span>sentences</span> about the person you're <span>describing</span>.<br/>
🎧 Remember: <span>height/build</span>, then <span>hair</span>, then <span>general</span> <span>appearance</span>.<br/>
🎧 Could you do this?<br/>
🎧 If so, great <span>job—we've</span> only done one <span>part</span>, and you've already got the start of a good <span>description</span>.<br/>
🎧 But of course, there's more we can add.<br/>
🎧 <span>Part</span> two: <span>describing</span> <span>positive</span> <span>characteristics</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>question</span>: what's this person like?<br/>
🎧 Do you know what this <span>question</span> <span>means</span>?<br/>
🎧 It <span>means</span> I want you to tell me about the <span>person's</span> <span>personality</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's start with <span>positive</span> <span>words</span> you can use to talk about <span>someone's</span> <span>character</span>.<br/>
🎧 Think about the person you're <span>describing</span>.<br/>
🎧 What good things can you say about him or her?<br/>
🎧 You could <span>describe</span> <span>someone</span> as <span>'kind'</span>, but it's better to be more <span>specific</span> if you can.<br/>
🎧 Better <span>words</span> to use are <span>'considerate'—meaning</span> <span>someone</span> who always <span>thinks</span> about other people and their <span>needs—or</span> <span>'warm'—meaning</span> <span>someone</span> who <span>shows</span> <span>positive</span> <span>feelings</span> to <span>others</span> and makes other people feel good.<br/>
🎧 Or, maybe this person is good at <span>making</span> other people <span>laugh</span>.<br/>
🎧 You could say they are <span>'funny'</span> or that they have a <span>'good</span> <span>sense</span> of <span>humour'</span>.<br/>
🎧 More <span>generally</span>, you can <span>describe</span> <span>someone</span> as <span>'fun'</span> or <span>'entertaining'</span> if people enjoy spending time with them.<br/>
🎧 What else?<br/>
🎧 Well, for a friend, it's very important that a person is <span>'reliable'—that</span> you can <span>depend</span> on them to keep their <span>promises</span> and be there for you when you need them.<br/>
🎧 <span>Similarly</span>, you could <span>describe</span> people as <span>'honest'</span> or <span>'straightforward'</span>.<br/>
🎧 If <span>someone</span> is <span>straightforward</span>, they're <span>honest</span>, easy to <span>understand</span> and easy to <span>spend</span> time with.<br/>
🎧 <span>Straightforward</span> people say what they think, but not in a <span>rude</span> way, and they don't keep <span>secrets</span> or <span>gossip</span> about other people.<br/>
🎧 Let's look at <span>three</span> more.<br/>
🎧 Most of us like spending time with people who are <span>'cheerful'—people</span> who <span>smile</span> a lot and are usually in a good <span>mood</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Cheerful</span> people are often <span>'positive'</span> and <span>'optimistic'—they</span> <span>expect</span> good things to <span>happen</span>.<br/>
🎧 So now you have <span>twelve</span> <span>positive</span> <span>adjectives</span> you can use to <span>describe</span> <span>someone's</span> <span>personality</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can you use any of these <span>adjectives</span> to talk about the person you're <span>describing</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Example<br/></span>
🎧 When you use these <span>adjectives</span>, always try to add an example or a <span>reason</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, don't just say:<br/>
🎧 My <span>brother</span> is really funny.<br/>
🎧 My friend <span>Lia</span> is a very <span>cheerful</span> person.<br/>
🎧 Add some <span>details</span> or <span>examples</span> to make your answer more <span>interesting</span>, like this:<br/>
🎧 My <span>brother's</span> really funny.<br/>
🎧 He likes <span>making</span> <span>weird</span> <span>jokes</span>, <span>generally</span> at the most <span>inappropriate</span> <span>moment</span>.<br/>
🎧 My friend <span>Lia</span> is a very <span>cheerful</span> person.<br/>
🎧 Even <span>early</span> in the morning, she's always <span>smiling</span> and in a good <span>mood</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't know how she does it!<br/>
🎧 If <span>possible</span>, you could even add a <span>story</span> to really <span>illustrate</span> the <span>person's</span> <span>character</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Story<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Craig</span>, who I work with, is such an <span>honest</span> guy.<br/>
🎧 I remember one time he <span>found</span> a <span>wallet</span> with <span>£500</span> in a pub.<br/>
🎧 It would have been easy to keep the <span>money—there</span> was <span>nothing</span> in the <span>wallet</span> to say whose it was, but he said it wouldn't be right to keep it, and he <span>insisted</span> on going <span>straight</span> to the <span>police</span>, right that <span>minute</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Adding</span> <span>stories</span> like this can really <span>bring</span> a <span>description</span> to life.<br/>
🎧 You've also <span>seen</span> some good <span>ways</span> to use these <span>adjectives</span>:<br/>
🎧 My <span>brother</span> is really <span>_______</span>.<br/>
🎧 My friend <span>Lia</span> is a very <span>________</span> <span></span>. <span>Craig</span> is such an <span>_______</span> guy.<br/>
🎧 Of course, you can change these and use them in your answer.<br/>
🎧 <span>Negative</span> <span>Characteristics<br/></span>
🎧 What about you?<br/>
🎧 <span>Pause</span> the <span>video</span>, and try to use some of these <span>adjectives</span> about the person you're <span>describing</span>.<br/>
🎧 Don't <span>forget</span> to add <span>details</span> and <span>examples</span> to your <span>description</span>, or you can even add a <span>story</span> if <span>possible</span>!<br/>
🎧 Next, let's look at <span>part</span> <span>three</span>: <span>describing</span> <span>negative</span> <span>characteristics</span>.<br/>
🎧 No <span>one's</span> perfect, right?<br/>
🎧 We all have our <span>flaws</span>, so let's look at how to <span>describe</span> the bad side of <span>someone's</span> <span>personality</span>.<br/>
🎧 Many of the <span>words</span> you saw in <span>part</span> two have <span>direct</span> <span>opposites</span> which you can use.<br/>
🎧 For example:<br/>
🎧 <span>'kind'</span> <span>→</span> <span>'unkind'</span> <span>'considerate'</span> <span>→</span> <span>'inconsiderate'<br/></span>
🎧 <span>'honest'</span> <span>→</span> <span>'dishonest'</span> <span>'reliable'</span> <span>→</span> <span>'unreliable'<br/></span>
🎧 Of course, there are other <span>words</span> you can use, too.<br/>
🎧 Some people can be <span>'selfish'</span> or <span>'self-centered'—they</span> think about <span>themselves</span> too much, and don't think about the needs of <span>others</span>.<br/>
🎧 These two <span>words</span> have a <span>similar</span> <span>meaning</span>.<br/>
🎧 Even more <span>extreme</span>, you can <span>describe</span> <span>someone</span> as <span>'self-obsessed'</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>self-obsessed</span> person only <span>thinks</span> about <span>themselves</span>, and doesn't <span>seem</span> to <span>realise</span> that other people <span>exist</span> at all!<br/>
🎧 Not everyone can be funny, but you don't want to be <span>seen</span> as <span>'humourless'</span> or <span>'dull'</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>'Dull'</span> is <span>similar</span> to <span>'boring'</span>, while <span>'humourless'</span> <span>means</span> that <span>someone</span> has no <span>sense</span> of <span>humour</span> and is too serious.<br/>
🎧 If <span>someone</span> doesn't do what they say or doesn't keep their <span>promises</span>, you've already <span>seen</span> two <span>words</span> you can use: <span>'dishonest'</span> or <span>'unreliable'</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Similarly</span>, you could <span>describe</span> <span>someone</span> as <span>'insincere'—meaning</span> that <span>someone</span> says things without <span>meaning</span> them.<br/>
🎧 For example, if <span>someone</span> is always <span>friendly</span> on the <span>surface</span>, but they don't really feel anything inside, you could <span>describe</span> that person as <span>insincere</span>.<br/>
🎧 Their <span>friendliness</span> doesn't mean anything.<br/>
🎧 Finally, <span>cheerful</span> people are always in a good <span>mood</span>, but what's the <span>opposite</span>?<br/>
🎧 You could <span>describe</span> <span>someone</span> as <span>'moody'</span> or <span>'grumpy'</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Moody</span> <span>people's</span> <span>moods</span> change very <span>easily</span>, and they are often in a bad <span>mood</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Grumpy</span> people never <span>seem</span> to be in a good <span>mood</span> and are always <span>unhappy</span> and <span>negative</span>.<br/>
🎧 So now, you have <span>twelve</span> <span>negative</span> <span>adjectives</span> to go with your <span>twelve</span> <span>positive</span> <span>adjectives</span>!<br/>
🎧 As before, when you use these <span>adjectives</span> to <span>describe</span> <span>someone</span>, try to add <span>details</span> or <span>examples</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example:<br/>
🎧 <span>Negative</span> <span>Characteristics</span> <span>Examples<br/></span>
🎧 My <span>brother</span> can be a little <span>unreliable</span> sometimes.<br/>
🎧 He often <span>‘forgets'</span> to do things he <span>promised</span> he would.<br/>
🎧 <span>Lia's</span> great, but sometimes I feel she's a bit <span>insincere</span>.<br/>
🎧 She says all these nice things, but I'm not sure she really <span>means</span> them.<br/>
🎧 My <span>colleague</span> <span>Craig</span> is so <span>moody</span>.<br/>
🎧 He'll be fine one <span>minute</span>, then <span>suddenly</span> he <span>starts</span> <span>acting</span> like he <span>hates</span> everyone.<br/>
🎧 It makes him quite <span>difficult</span> to be around.<br/>
🎧 You can see how we often use <span>slightly</span> more <span>indirect</span> <span>language</span> to talk about <span>someone's</span> <span>negative</span> <span>characteristics</span>:<br/>
🎧 My <span>brother</span> can be a little <span>_______</span> sometimes.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes I feel that she's a bit <span>________</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course, if you really want to be <span>direct</span>, you can be:<br/>
🎧 My <span>colleague</span> is so <span>________</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, <span>pause</span> the <span>video</span> and try to use these <span>words</span> and <span>phrases</span>.<br/>
🎧 Make <span>2-3</span> <span>sentences</span>, and don't <span>forget</span> to add <span>examples</span> and <span>details</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Part</span> <span>four</span>: talking about your <span>relationship</span>.<br/>
🎧 Finally, let's add some <span>details</span> about how you know this person and your <span>relationship</span>.<br/>
🎧 How You Know <span>Them<br/></span>
🎧 Look at <span>three</span> <span>sentences</span>:<br/>
🎧 We've <span>known</span> each other <span>________</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>met</span> <span>________</span>.<br/>
🎧 We get on <span>_______</span>, because <span>________</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you know what <span>'get</span> <span>on'</span> <span>means</span> here?<br/>
🎧 By <span>itself</span>, it <span>means</span> to have a good <span>relationship</span> with <span>someone</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can add <span>adverbs</span> after <span>'get</span> <span>on'</span> to give it different <span>meanings</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example:<br/>
🎧 We get on very well.<br/>
🎧 We get on well sometimes.<br/>
🎧 Or you can make it <span>negative</span>:<br/>
🎧 We don't get on very well.<br/>
🎧 Okay, look at the <span>sentences</span> again:<br/>
🎧 We've <span>known</span> each other <span>________</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>met</span> <span>________</span>.<br/>
🎧 We get on <span>_______</span>, because <span>________</span>.<br/>
🎧 How could you <span>complete</span> them?<br/>
🎧 You could say:<br/>
🎧 We've <span>known</span> each other for about ten years.<br/>
🎧 We <span>met</span> at university.<br/>
🎧 We get on really well, because we have a <span>similar</span> <span>sense</span> of <span>humour</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course, there are many <span>possibilities</span>:<br/>
🎧 We've <span>known</span> each other almost our whole lives.<br/>
🎧 We <span>met</span> when we were <span>babies</span>, before we could even <span>walk</span>!<br/>
🎧 We get on well most of the time, although we <span>argue</span> sometimes, too.<br/>
🎧 <span>Depending</span> on who you're talking about, it might not make <span>sense</span> to use all of these <span>sentences</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, if you're talking about your <span>brother</span> or another <span>relative</span>, it doesn't make <span>sense</span> to talk about how long you've <span>known</span> each other or where you <span>met</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, you can still talk about how well you get on and why.<br/>
🎧 How Often You See Each <span>Other<br/></span>
🎧 You could also add how often you see each other, or what you like to do together.<br/>
🎧 I don't see my <span>brother</span> often, though we talk a <span>couple</span> of <span>times</span> a month.<br/>
🎧 When we meet up, we like watching <span>films</span> or playing <span>cards</span>.<br/>
🎧 Either way, try to make <span>three</span> <span>sentences</span> about the person you're <span>describing</span>, like this:<br/>
🎧 I've <span>known</span> my friend <span>Lia</span> for about <span>five</span> years.<br/>
🎧 We <span>met</span> because we <span>worked</span> in the same place for a few <span>months</span>.<br/>
🎧 We get on really well, because we have a lot in <span>common</span>: we like the same <span>films</span>, the same music, and so on.<br/>
🎧 I've <span>known</span> <span>Craig</span> since <span>July</span>.<br/>
🎧 We actually <span>met</span> at a <span>mutual</span> <span>friend's</span> <span>birthday</span> <span>party</span>, and then we <span>realised</span> we work in the same place.<br/>
🎧 We get on alright but we aren't <span>close</span>.<br/>
🎧 We're just different people and we don't <span>seem</span> to have much to talk about.<br/>
🎧 Now you try!<br/>
🎧 <span>Pause</span> the <span>video</span> and make <span>three</span> <span>sentences</span> about your <span>relationship</span> with the person you're talking about.<br/>
🎧 Use the <span>words</span> and <span>phrases</span> from this <span>section</span>.<br/>
🎧 Alright?<br/>
🎧 <span>Making</span> a <span>Longer</span> <span>Answer<br/></span>
🎧 Now, we have one more thing to do:<br/>
🎧 <span>Part</span> <span>five</span>: <span>making</span> a <span>longer</span> answer.<br/>
🎧 In this <span>lesson</span>, you've <span>learned</span> how to <span>describe</span> a person by:<br/>
🎧 Talking about their <span>appearance;</span> talking about the <span>positive</span> and <span>negative</span> <span>sides</span> of their <span>personality;<br/></span>
🎧 Talking about your <span>relationship</span> and how you know each other.<br/>
🎧 Now, let's put everything we've done together into a <span>longer</span> answer.<br/>
🎧 Here's one:<br/>
🎧 My <span>brother</span> is quite <span>tall</span> and <span>well-built</span>.<br/>
🎧 He has short, <span>brown</span> <span>hair</span>, but he's going <span>bald</span> <span>fast</span>.<br/>
🎧 He looks a bit like a <span>younger</span> <span>version</span> of <span>Vin</span> <span>Diesel</span>.<br/>
🎧 He's really funny.<br/>
🎧 He likes <span>making</span> <span>weird</span> <span>jokes</span>, <span>generally</span> at the most <span>inappropriate</span> <span>moment</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, he can be a little <span>unreliable</span> sometimes.<br/>
🎧 He often <span>‘forgets'</span> to do things he <span>promised</span> he would.<br/>
🎧 I don't see him often, though we talk a <span>couple</span> of <span>times</span> a month.<br/>
🎧 When we meet up, we like watching <span>films</span> or playing <span>cards</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Longer</span> <span>Answer<br/></span>
🎧 This answer <span>uses</span> <span>examples</span> you've already <span>seen</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's do one more <span>longer</span> answer with <span>original</span> <span>examples</span>:<br/>
🎧 I'm going to tell you about a friend of <span>mine</span>, <span>Sarah</span>.<br/>
🎧 She's quite short and very <span>slim</span>, with <span>light</span> <span>brown</span> <span>hair</span>.<br/>
🎧 She's very <span>pretty</span> and she has a really nice <span>smile</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sarah's</span> <span>cheerful</span> and fun to be around, and she's also very <span>straightforward</span>: you know who she is right away and it's easy to feel <span>comfortable</span> around her.<br/>
🎧 I've <span>known</span> her for about <span>twelve</span> years now, since university.<br/>
🎧 We get on well because we have a <span>similar</span> <span>attitude</span> to life and we always have lots to talk about.<br/>
🎧 Okay, now it's your <span>turn</span>!<br/>
🎧 Your <span>Turn<br/></span>
🎧 Make a <span>longer</span> answer to <span>describe</span> <span>someone</span> you know.<br/>
