🎧 Hi, I'm <span>Mike</span> and <span>welcome</span> to <span>Oxford</span> Online English!<br/>
🎧 In this <span>lesson</span>, you can learn how to talk about your <span>job</span> in English.<br/>
🎧 Where do you work?<br/>
🎧 What do you have to do in your <span>job</span>?<br/>
🎧 What kind of company do you work for?<br/>
🎧 In this class, you can learn how to answer <span>questions</span> like this in <span>clear</span>, <span>detailed</span> English.<br/>
🎧 Ready? Let's start!<br/>
🎧 <span>Part</span> one: <span>introducing</span> your <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm a <span>________</span>: I work in <span>________;</span> I work for <span>_________</span>.<br/>
🎧 How would you <span>complete</span> these <span>sentences</span>?<br/>
🎧 You could say something like:<br/>
🎧 I'm a <span>writer</span>.<br/>
🎧 I work in online <span>education</span>.<br/>
🎧 I work for a <span>publishing</span> company.<br/>
🎧 <span>'I</span> work <span>in...'</span> is used with a <span>field</span>, <span>meaning</span> a <span>type</span> of work.<br/>
🎧 So, you can say things like:<br/>
🎧 I work in <span>finance</span>.<br/>
🎧 I work in <span>digital</span> <span>marketing</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can also use <span>'work</span> <span>in'</span> with a place or a <span>department</span> of a company.<br/>
🎧 For example:<br/>
🎧 I work in the <span>HR</span> <span>department</span> of a <span>financial</span> <span>firm</span>.<br/>
🎧 I work in a school, <span>teaching</span> <span>modern</span> <span>languages</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Confused</span>?<br/>
🎧 You can see that if you use <span>'work</span> <span>in'</span> to talk about the <span>type</span> of work you do, you don't use an <span>article</span> like <span>'a'</span> or <span>'the'</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you use an <span>article</span> <span>'a'</span> or <span>'the'</span> after <span>'work</span> <span>in'</span>, it <span>means</span> you're talking about the place or <span>department</span> where you work.<br/>
🎧 <span>'I</span> work <span>for…'</span> is used with a company.<br/>
🎧 So, you could say:<br/>
🎧 I'm a <span>salesman</span>.<br/>
🎧 I work for a <span>mobile</span> phone company.<br/>
🎧 I work for a law <span>firm</span> <span>based</span> in <span>Frankfurt</span>.<br/>
🎧 Or even: I run my own <span>business</span>, so I work for myself.<br/>
🎧 What can you say?<br/>
🎧 Can you make <span>sentences</span> like this to say something about your <span>job</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Pause</span> the <span>video</span> and try to make a <span>sentence</span>.<br/>
🎧 Say it <span>aloud</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Part</span> <span>2</span> <span>Describe</span> your <span>company<br/></span>
🎧 Next, let's add more <span>details</span> to your answer.<br/>
🎧 <span>Part</span> two: <span>describing</span> your company.<br/>
🎧 I work for a <span>_________</span> company which <span>__________<br/></span>
🎧 Look at this <span>sentence</span>.<br/>
🎧 We need one <span>adjective</span>, and the end of the <span>sentence</span> after <span>'which'</span>.<br/>
🎧 Any <span>ideas</span>?<br/>
🎧 For the <span>adjectives</span>, think about these <span>ideas</span>: is your company big or small?<br/>
🎧 <span>Local</span> or <span>multinational</span>?<br/>
🎧 For the <span>part</span> after <span>'which'</span>, ask yourself: what does your company do?<br/>
🎧 Does it make things, sell things, <span>organise</span> things?<br/>
🎧 Does it <span>provide</span> <span>products</span>, <span>services</span>, or both?<br/>
🎧 So, you could say:<br/>
🎧 I work for an <span>international</span> <span>electronics</span> company which makes <span>tablet</span> <span>computers</span>.<br/>
🎧 I work for a <span>German</span> company which does <span>market</span> <span>research</span> for other <span>companies</span>.<br/>
🎧 What if you don't work for a company?<br/>
🎧 Here are some things you could say:<br/>
🎧 I'm a <span>freelancer</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Meaning</span>: I work <span>independently</span>, for different people and <span>companies</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>self-employed</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Meaning</span>: I work for myself, either <span>freelance</span> or I have my own <span>business</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm a <span>business</span> <span>owner</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you don't work, and people ask you what you do, what can you say?<br/>
🎧 Here are some <span>useful</span> <span>phrases</span>:<br/>
🎧 I'm between <span>jobs</span> at the <span>moment</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Meaning</span>: I've <span>left</span> one <span>job</span>, and haven't <span>found</span> another yet.<br/>
🎧 This sounds <span>nicer</span> than saying, <span>“I'm</span> <span>unemployed.”<br/></span>
🎧 I'm taking some time out <span>to…(travel</span>, <span>spend</span> time with my <span>kids</span>, <span>write</span> a book, <span>recover</span> from an <span>illness</span>, <span>etc.)<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Meaning</span>: I'm not working at the <span>moment</span> because I want to focus on something else.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>retired</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about you?<br/>
🎧 Do you work for a company?<br/>
🎧 What can you say about it?<br/>
🎧 If you don't work for a company, how would you <span>describe</span> your work <span>situation</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Part</span> <span>3</span> <span>Describe</span> your <span>job</span> in <span>detail<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Part</span> <span>three</span>: how to <span>describe</span> your <span>job</span> in more <span>detail</span>.<br/>
🎧 So what do you actually do all day?<br/>
🎧 Let's see how you can <span>describe</span> your <span>job</span> in more <span>detail</span>.<br/>
🎧 Look at these <span>sentences</span>:<br/>
🎧 I have to <span>_________;</span> I'm <span>responsible</span> for <span>_________;</span> Most of my time is <span>spent<br/></span>
🎧 <span>_________</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's do some <span>examples</span> together.<br/>
🎧 We'll start with a simple example.<br/>
🎧 I'm a <span>nurse</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have to look after <span>patients</span>, give them <span>medicine</span> and make sure they're <span>comfortable</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>responsible</span> for about <span>20-30</span> <span>patients</span>.<br/>
🎧 Most of my time is <span>spent</span> talking to <span>patients</span> and <span>checking</span> that everything is okay.<br/>
🎧 Next, let's do a more <span>detailed</span> example.<br/>
🎧 I have to <span>design</span> <span>websites</span> to the <span>client's</span> <span>specifications</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>responsible</span> for the whole <span>design</span> <span>process</span>, so I have to take the <span>client's</span> <span>ideas</span> and <span>turn</span> them into a <span>finished</span> product.<br/>
🎧 Most of my time is <span>spent</span> <span>experimenting</span> with different <span>designs</span> and <span>ideas</span> and <span>seeing</span> what looks good, because <span>attention</span> to <span>detail</span> is important in this kind of work.<br/>
🎧 Can you say something like this about your <span>job</span> and what you do?<br/>
🎧 Try to add <span>details</span> if you can.<br/>
🎧 <span>Part</span> <span>4</span> How to <span>describe</span> your <span>job<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Part</span> <span>four</span>: saying how you feel about your <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, you can <span>hopefully</span> say something about your <span>job</span> and where you work.<br/>
🎧 But here's another <span>question</span>: do you like your <span>job</span>?<br/>
🎧 Why or why not?<br/>
🎧 <span>Hopefully</span>, you enjoy your <span>job</span>!<br/>
🎧 How could you <span>describe</span> a <span>job</span> which you like?<br/>
🎧 Of course, you could use <span>general</span> <span>adjectives</span> like <span>'good'</span> or <span>'interesting'</span>, but here are some <span>specific</span> <span>adjectives</span> you could use:<br/>
🎧 <span>Stimulating</span> <span>:something</span> which is <span>stimulating</span> is <span>exciting</span> and <span>gives</span> you <span>energy</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Satisfying</span>: <span>means</span> that your <span>job</span> <span>gives</span> you a <span>sense</span> of <span>achievement</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Creative</span>: you can use your <span>imagination</span> when you work.<br/>
🎧 <span>Rewarding</span>: this <span>means</span> your <span>job</span> <span>gives</span> you very <span>positive</span> <span>feelings</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's often used to talk about <span>jobs</span> in which you help other people.<br/>
🎧 For example, <span>teachers</span> or <span>nurses</span> might <span>describe</span> their <span>jobs</span> as <span>rewarding</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Challenging</span>: <span>challenging</span> can be <span>positive</span> or <span>negative</span>, but if you use it to talk about your <span>job</span>, it would have a <span>positive</span> <span>meaning</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>means</span> that your <span>job</span> is <span>difficult</span>, but in an <span>interesting</span> way which makes you think and learn.<br/>
🎧 What if you don't like your <span>job</span>?<br/>
🎧 Again, you can use <span>general</span> <span>words</span> like <span>'boring'</span> or <span>'difficult'</span>, which are fine but very <span>basic</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you want to be more <span>creative</span> with your <span>vocabulary</span>, here are some things you could say:<br/>
🎧 <span>Exhausting</span>: <span>describes</span> work which makes you feel very <span>tired</span>, either <span>physically</span> or <span>mentally</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Thankless:if</span> your work is <span>thankless</span>, no one <span>notices</span> or <span>appreciates</span> what you do.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mind-numbing</span>: <span>extremely</span> <span>boring</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Dead-end</span>: <span>describes</span> a <span>job</span> which has no <span>prospects</span> for the future.<br/>
🎧 If you have a <span>dead-end</span> <span>job</span>, you will never get <span>promoted</span> and the <span>job</span> will always be the same.<br/>
🎧 <span>Soul-destroying</span>: <span>describes</span> a <span>job</span> which is <span>extremely</span> <span>unpleasant</span> and <span>boring</span>, and which you really, really <span>hate</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Part</span> <span>5</span> How to make a <span>longer</span> <span>answer<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Part</span> <span>five</span>: how to make a <span>longer</span> answer.<br/>
🎧 At this <span>point</span>, you should be able to <span>introduce</span> your work, say where you work, give <span>details</span> about what you do and say how you feel about your work.<br/>
🎧 Let's make some <span>longer</span> <span>sample</span> <span>answers</span> together.<br/>
🎧 First one:<br/>
🎧 I'm a <span>pharmacist</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>started</span> my own small <span>pharmacy</span>, so I'm also a <span>business</span> <span>owner</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have to work as a <span>pharmacist</span>, of course, <span>giving</span> advice to <span>patients</span> and <span>making</span> sure they have the right <span>medicine</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, I'm also <span>responsible</span> for the <span>pharmacy</span>, so I have to <span>manage</span> my <span>staff</span>, do the <span>accounts</span>, and so on.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>stimulating</span> work because I have to do many different things every day, so I never get <span>bored</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Clear</span>?<br/>
🎧 Could you make an answer like this?<br/>
🎧 Let's do one more:<br/>
🎧 I'm a <span>writer</span>.<br/>
🎧 I work in online <span>education</span>.<br/>
🎧 I work for a big <span>publishing</span> company, which <span>produces</span> different <span>educational</span> <span>materials</span> that are used all around the <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have to <span>write</span> <span>lesson</span> <span>plans</span> and <span>materials</span> for <span>teachers</span> to use in the <span>classroom</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>spend</span> most of my time thinking about how I can make different things fit together into a <span>lesson</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's very <span>challenging</span> work and it can be <span>exhausting</span>, but it's also very <span>creative</span> and <span>satisfying</span>, because I know people all around the <span>world</span> are <span>using</span> <span>lessons</span> which I <span>wrote</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, now it's your <span>turn</span>!<br/>
🎧 Try to make a <span>longer</span> answer like this talking about your <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 Use the <span>vocabulary</span> and <span>structure</span> from this <span>lesson</span> to help you.<br/>
🎧 If you want, you can <span>post</span> your answer in the <span>video</span> <span>comments</span> on <span>YouTube</span>.<br/>
🎧 We'll give you some <span>feedback</span> on your answer.<br/>
🎧 That's the end of the <span>lesson</span>.<br/>
🎧 I hope you <span>learned</span> some new <span>ways</span> to talk about your <span>job</span> and what you do.<br/>
🎧 Thanks very much for watching. See you next time!<br/>
