🎧 Hello, I'm <span>Oli</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Welcome</span> to <span>Oxford</span> Online English!<br/>
🎧 In this <span>lesson</span>, you can learn about how to talk about your free time and <span>hobbies</span> in English.<br/>
🎧 What do you like doing in your free time?<br/>
🎧 Do you have any <span>interesting</span> <span>hobbies</span>?<br/>
🎧 Talking about your free time is a great way to start a <span>conversation</span> in English, or to find things in <span>common</span> when you're <span>speaking</span> to <span>somebody</span>.<br/>
🎧 By the end of this <span>lesson</span>, you'll be able to speak <span>clearly</span> and <span>naturally</span> about your free time and your <span>hobbies</span> in English.<br/>
🎧 <span>Part</span> one: free time and <span>hobbies</span> <span>vocabulary</span>.<br/>
🎧 What <span>words</span> do you know for free time <span>activities</span> in English?<br/>
🎧 Some people <span>prefer</span> things you can do at home, like watching <span>TV</span>, <span>reading</span>, or cooking.<br/>
🎧 Other people like <span>sports</span>, like playing <span>football</span>, playing <span>basketball</span>, playing <span>tennis</span>, going <span>swimming</span>, going <span>jogging</span>, or going <span>climbing</span>, or maybe doing <span>boxing</span>, doing <span>judo</span>, or doing <span>yoga</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course, many people <span>prefer</span> more <span>social</span> <span>activities</span>, for example, <span>hanging</span> out with your friends, <span>relaxing</span> with your <span>family</span>, or going <span>shopping</span>.<br/>
🎧 Or maybe you like to do something more <span>creative</span>, like taking <span>photos</span>, <span>painting</span>, or <span>writing</span> <span>stories</span> or <span>writing</span> a <span>blog</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about you?<br/>
🎧 What kind of free time <span>activities</span> do you <span>prefer</span>?<br/>
🎧 Let's look at how you can talk about free time <span>activities</span> and <span>hobbies</span> which you like.<br/>
🎧 <span>Part</span> two: what do you like doing?<br/>
🎧 In my free time, I like <span></span>. <span></span>. <span></span>. What could you say here?<br/>
🎧 In my free time, I like playing <span>basketball</span>.<br/>
🎧 In my free time, I like <span>relaxing</span> with my <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 In my free time, I like <span>reading</span> books.<br/>
🎧 Can you see a <span>pattern</span> here?<br/>
🎧 In every <span>sentence</span>, after <span>'like,'</span> we use a <span>verb</span> <span>plus</span> <span>-ing</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can you make a <span>sentence</span>?<br/>
🎧 What do you like doing in your free time?<br/>
🎧 But just <span>using</span> <span>'like'</span> can be <span>repetitive</span> and <span>boring</span>.<br/>
🎧 So what other <span>verbs</span> can you use?<br/>
🎧 Well, you could use <span>verbs</span> like <span>'love'</span>, <span>'enjoy'</span>, or <span>'hate'</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example: I love going <span>swimming</span>.<br/>
🎧 I enjoy watching <span>TV</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>hate</span> going <span>shopping</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can you see the same <span>pattern</span>?<br/>
🎧 After all of these <span>verbs</span>, you need to use a <span>verb</span> with <span>-ing</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can also add <span>words</span> like <span>'really'</span>, <span>'sometimes'</span>, or <span>'absolutely'</span>, to make your <span>meaning</span> <span>stronger</span> or <span>weaker</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example: I really like taking <span>photos</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes I enjoy going <span>jogging</span>.<br/>
🎧 I absolutely <span>hate</span> playing <span>football</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now it's your <span>turn</span>.<br/>
🎧 What can you say?<br/>
🎧 Can you make your own <span>sentences</span>?<br/>
🎧 OK, so now you can say something about what you like or don't like doing.<br/>
🎧 Let's look at how you can add more <span>details</span> to your <span>ideas</span>.<br/>
🎧 First, let's say how often you do your free time <span>activity</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example: I like playing <span>sport</span>.<br/>
🎧 I play <span>football</span> every <span>Tuesday</span> <span>evening</span>.<br/>
🎧 I absolutely <span>hate</span> going <span>shopping</span>.<br/>
🎧 I only go <span>shopping</span> once or <span>twice</span> a year.<br/>
🎧 I really like taking <span>photos</span>, but I don't get the <span>chance</span> to do it often.<br/>
🎧 What about you?<br/>
🎧 How often do you do your <span>hobbies</span>?<br/>
🎧 You can use these <span>phrases</span> to help you talk.<br/>
🎧 <span>'Every</span> <span></span>. <span></span>. <span>.'</span> For example: <span>'every</span> <span>weekend'</span>, <span>'every</span> <span>Saturday</span> <span>afternoon'</span>, <span>'every</span> <span>day'</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>'Once</span> or <span>twice</span> a <span></span>. <span></span>. <span>.'</span>, for example: <span>'once</span> a <span>week'</span>, <span>'twice</span> a <span>month'</span>, <span>'three</span> <span>times</span> a <span>year'</span>, and so on.<br/>
🎧 Can you make some <span>sentences</span> like this about your free time and <span>hobbies</span>?<br/>
🎧 How often do you do your <span>hobbies</span>?<br/>
🎧 Next, let's add some <span>details</span> about where you do your hobby or free time <span>activity</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example: I like playing <span>sport</span>.<br/>
🎧 I play <span>football</span> every <span>Tuesday</span> <span>evening</span> at the <span>park</span> near my house.<br/>
🎧 I enjoy having <span>coffee</span> with my friends.<br/>
🎧 We go to a <span>cafe</span> in the <span>city</span> <span>center</span> once or <span>twice</span> a week.<br/>
🎧 I really like taking <span>wildlife</span> <span>photos</span> in the <span>forest</span>, but I don't get the <span>chance</span> to do it often.<br/>
🎧 You can see that our <span>answers</span> are getting more <span>detailed</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you speak, you should always try to add some <span>details</span> to your <span>ideas</span>, like this.<br/>
🎧 It will make your English sound more <span>interesting</span> and more <span>natural</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about you? Can you add some <span>details</span> like these to your <span>sentences</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Pause</span> the <span>video</span>. Practice. Try to make some <span>sentences</span>. Say them out <span>loud</span>. Practice a little bit.<br/>
🎧 OK. Next, let's look at <span>giving</span> <span>background</span> <span>information</span>, <span>especially</span> if you have an <span>interesting</span> or an <span>unusual</span> hobby.<br/>
🎧 You can talk about when and why you <span>started</span> doing it.<br/>
🎧 For example, I <span>started</span> playing <span>tennis</span> when I was <span>10</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've been <span>learning</span> to <span>paint</span> for six <span>months</span> now.<br/>
🎧 I <span>decided</span> to do <span>yoga</span> because I wanted to be <span>healthy</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>French</span> friend got me into <span>climbing</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the last <span>sentence</span>, the <span>phrase</span>, My friend got me into something, <span>means</span> that your friend <span>introduced</span> this <span>activity</span> to you, and now you like it.<br/>
🎧 What can you say about your hobby?<br/>
🎧 Can you use some of these <span>phrases</span> to talk about yourself?<br/>
🎧 For example, I <span>started</span> <span>climbing</span> when I was living in <span>Russia</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've been <span>climbing</span> for about <span>eight</span> years.<br/>
🎧 I also <span>recently</span> <span>decided</span> to do <span>yoga</span> because I wanted to be more <span>flexible</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I was <span>younger</span>, my dad got me into <span>photography</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about you? What are your <span>examples</span>?<br/>
🎧 Finally, let's look at how you can add some <span>descriptive</span> <span>words</span> to say why you do or don't enjoy something.<br/>
🎧 For example, I like <span>climbing</span> because it's really <span>exciting</span>.<br/>
🎧 I love doing <span>yoga</span> because it's so <span>relaxing</span>.<br/>
🎧 I really like <span>writing</span> <span>stories</span> because it's <span>creative</span>, and I like <span>using</span> my <span>imagination</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can also use <span>negative</span> <span>adjectives</span> to talk about things you don't like.<br/>
🎧 For example, I don't like going <span>jogging</span> because it's <span>tiring</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>hate</span> watching <span>TV</span> because I find it <span>boring</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've been trying to learn to <span>paint</span>, but it's too <span>hard</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why do you like your <span>hobbies</span>?<br/>
🎧 What are some <span>activities</span> you don't like doing?<br/>
🎧 Can you say why you don't like them?<br/>
🎧 Try to make some <span>sentences</span> and practice <span>using</span> this <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, now it's your <span>turn</span> to speak.<br/>
🎧 Let's try <span>using</span> everything we've <span>looked</span> at to make a <span>longer</span> answer.<br/>
🎧 For example, I really like playing <span>tennis</span>.<br/>
🎧 I play every weekend at the <span>park</span> near my house.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes I play with my <span>brother</span>, or sometimes with a friend.<br/>
🎧 My <span>brother</span> got me into it because he <span>loves</span> <span>sports</span>, and he <span>needed</span> <span>someone</span> to play with.<br/>
🎧 I didn't like it at first because it was <span>hard</span>, and I <span>lost</span> all the time.<br/>
🎧 But now, I enjoy it, <span>especially</span> when I <span>beat</span> my <span>brother</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, let's do one more <span>sample</span> answer.<br/>
🎧 I love taking <span>photos</span>.<br/>
🎧 Once or <span>twice</span> a month, I go to different <span>areas</span> of the <span>city</span> and look for <span>interesting</span> <span>pictures</span> to take.<br/>
🎧 I've been interested in <span>photography</span> since I was young, when my dad got me a <span>camera</span> for my <span>birthday</span>.<br/>
🎧 I like it because it's <span>creative</span>, and I can <span>express</span> myself through my <span>pictures</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyone</span> can use a <span>camera</span>, but you need to use your <span>imagination</span> to find good <span>pictures</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, can you talk about your free time?<br/>
🎧 What do you like doing?<br/>
🎧 Where do you go, and how often?<br/>
🎧 When did you start doing this hobby, and why?<br/>
🎧 And, why do you like or, <span>perhaps</span>, <span>dislike</span> this <span>activity</span>?<br/>
🎧 Try to talk for at <span>least</span> <span>30</span> <span>seconds</span>.<br/>
🎧 Give lots of <span>details</span>.<br/>
🎧 Add <span>details</span> to make your answer more <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, that's the end of the <span>lesson</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks very much for watching.<br/>
🎧 I hope you <span>learned</span> something about how to talk about your free time in English.<br/>
