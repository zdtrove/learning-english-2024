🎧 This year is going to be different. <br/>

🎧 Every year he failed to keep his resolution. <br/> 
🎧 However, this year Mark knew it was going to be different because he decided to make changes to his resolution. <br/>

🎧 This way he can be more focused and know exactly where to begin.<br/>
🎧 Losing weight and exercising more were extremely general. <br/> 
🎧 Without a guided path, Mark was less likely to reach his resolution. <br/>

🎧 In the past he would exercise once in a while, and eat a diet only sometimes. <br/> 
🎧 He did not have a plan on what he was going to do.<br/>
🎧 Now he did so well that he increased his goal. <br/>
