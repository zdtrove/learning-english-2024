🎧 <span>Mary</span> wanted to get a <span>job</span> to <span>save</span> up money for her future. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She did not want to keep <span>asking</span> her <span>parents</span> for money. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She thought getting a <span>job</span> would be a good way to <span>build</span> her <span>experience</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Since she never had a <span>job</span> before, she <span>decided</span> to start with a simple <span>part-time</span> <span>job</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There were a lot of options out there. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She could be a <span>cashier</span>, a <span>tutor</span>, a <span>waitress</span>, or an <span>usher</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She <span>decided</span> that a <span>cashier</span> <span>job</span> would be most <span>suited</span> for her. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 This was a <span>job</span> that <span>seemed</span> simple enough that she could learn. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It would also let her <span>interact</span> with people, which was her <span>favorite</span> thing to do.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mary</span> did not have a car, so she <span>needed</span> to find a <span>job</span> that was <span>close</span> to her home and school. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She was still going to school, so she <span>needed</span> to find a <span>job</span> that was <span>flexible</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She <span>walked</span> around the <span>restaurants</span> and <span>stores</span> in her <span>neighborhood</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Some were <span>hiring</span>, <span>others</span> had all their <span>positions</span> <span>filled</span> up. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She <span>applied</span> to <span>10</span> different <span>places</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Her top <span>choice</span> was her <span>favorite</span> <span>frozen</span> <span>yogurt</span> <span>shop</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>application</span> usually <span>asked</span> for a <span>resume</span>, a <span>cover</span> <span>letter</span>, and an <span>application</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She was <span>excited</span> to <span>continue</span> with her <span>job</span> <span>search</span>.<br/>
🎧 Two <span>weeks</span> later, <span>five</span> <span>places</span> <span>contacted</span> her for an <span>interview</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They were the movie <span>theater</span>, the <span>yogurt</span> <span>shop</span>, a <span>candy</span> <span>shop</span>, a <span>video</span> game <span>store</span>, and a <span>coffee</span> <span>shop</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She did not <span>mind</span> any of the <span>jobs</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 The sky had been <span>gloomy</span> all week. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>clouds</span> <span>looked</span> <span>stormy</span> and <span>grey</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 No one was at the <span>park</span> or at the <span>beach</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 If they did go out, they would get <span>soaked</span> in the <span>rain</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The only thing people could do was <span>stay</span> <span>indoors</span>, <span>whether</span> it is the <span>mall</span> or a <span>museum</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Some took this <span>opportunity</span> to <span>stay</span> in at home and <span>watch</span> a movie. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Others</span> <span>cooked</span> <span>meals</span> or <span>curled</span> up with a good book.<br/>
🎧 The next day, the <span>rain</span> <span>stopped</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The sky <span>cleared</span> up. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 A <span>beautiful</span> <span>rainbow</span> <span>appeared</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The sky was <span>blue</span>, and people <span>started</span> to come out. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There were no more <span>umbrellas</span> and <span>raincoats</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It was not <span>warm</span> yet, and people still <span>needed</span> <span>sweaters</span>, but most were happy to <span>stay</span> dry.<br/>

🎧 <span>Ruth</span> was very <span>clumsy</span> and often <span>fell</span> at the <span>worst</span> <span>times</span> <span>possible</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Last year she <span>tripped</span> and <span>fell</span> into a <span>tray</span> of food at the <span>cafeteria</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Another year she <span>fell</span> in the <span>middle</span> of a <span>lecture</span>, and all the other students <span>looked</span> at her. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 People <span>knew</span> <span>Ruth</span> was <span>prone</span> to <span>accidents</span>, and she <span>felt</span> <span>super</span> <span>embarrassed</span> when these <span>events</span> <span>happened</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She <span>knew</span> that everyone thought she was <span>weird</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 This year she was <span>determined</span> to be more <span>careful</span> and <span>avoid</span> any <span>accidents</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>However</span>, she could not keep her <span>resolution</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ruth</span> was <span>walking</span> in the <span>rain</span>, and <span>somehow</span> <span>managed</span> to <span>fall</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 The <span>trash</span> <span>smelled</span> with all the old food that students have <span>thrown</span> away. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Instead</span> of <span>laughing</span> at her, many of the students <span>helped</span> her. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They <span>helped</span> <span>pick</span> up the <span>trash</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They also <span>helped</span> her up and <span>asked</span> if she was okay. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She <span>felt</span> so <span>touched</span> by the help she <span>received</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She no <span>longer</span> <span>felt</span> <span>embarrassed</span> or <span>pressured</span>.<br/>

🎧 She <span>knew</span> that she should be more <span>careful</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>However</span>, she was <span>careful</span> for <span>herself</span>, not for other people. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She no <span>longer</span> had <span>embarrassing</span> <span>moments</span>, because she no <span>longer</span> <span>felt</span> <span>embarrassed</span>.<br/>

🎧 This year is going to be different. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 This is what <span>Mark</span> told <span>himself</span> every year. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Every year he made the same <span>resolution</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 He always said that he would start <span>exercising</span> more and <span>eating</span> less. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Every year he <span>failed</span> to keep his <span>resolution</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>However</span>, this year <span>Mark</span> <span>knew</span> it was going to be different because he <span>decided</span> to make changes to his <span>resolution</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 He <span>learned</span> that he should be more <span>specific</span> in his <span>goal</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 This way he can be more <span>focused</span> and know exactly where to <span>begin</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Losing</span> <span>weight</span> and <span>exercising</span> more were <span>extremely</span> <span>general</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Without a <span>guided</span> <span>path</span>, <span>Mark</span> was less <span>likely</span> to <span>reach</span> his <span>resolution</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 This year he <span>decided</span> to <span>write</span> down that he would run at <span>least</span> one <span>mile</span> every day. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It was a <span>realistic</span> <span>goal</span> for <span>Mark</span>. He also said at <span>least</span> <span>five</span> <span>fruits</span> a week. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 This was also <span>realistic</span> since <span>Mark</span> used to eat two <span>fruits</span> <span>per</span> week at most. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 As the <span>weeks</span> went on, <span>Mark</span> <span>found</span> it <span>easier</span> to keep his <span>resolution</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Since he <span>knew</span> what he had to do, it was much <span>easier</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 In the <span>past</span> he would <span>exercise</span> once in a while, and eat a <span>diet</span> only sometimes. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 He did not have a plan on what he was going to do.<br/>
🎧 Now he did so well that he <span>increased</span> his <span>goal</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 He <span>decided</span> to do two <span>miles</span> <span>per</span> day and eat <span>seven</span> <span>fruits</span> <span>per</span> week. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 He <span>felt</span> great about the change he was <span>making;</span> he <span>felt</span> <span>happier</span> and <span>healthier</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 He also thought about other things he could do to <span>improve</span> his <span>health</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 This <span>resolution</span> and also drink more water.<br/>
