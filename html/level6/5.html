🎧 <span>Beverly</span> has been in <span>boarding</span> school since she was ten years old. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Her <span>parents</span> put her in <span>boarding</span> school to make her a more <span>independent</span> person. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Beverly</span> was <span>against</span> it at first. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She wanted to <span>stay</span> with her <span>parents</span> like most <span>kids</span> of her age. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She <span>started</span> getting used to <span>boarding</span> school when she was about <span>15</span> years old. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She would only see her <span>parents</span> during <span>winter</span> <span>break</span> and during the <span>summer</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Beverly</span> is okay with it now, because she is so used to not <span>seeing</span> her <span>parents</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Whenever</span> she <span>sees</span> her <span>parents</span> though, they <span>spend</span> almost every day together. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>However</span>, <span>Beverly</span> is going to <span>attend</span> a university near her <span>parents</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, the university is only <span>20</span> <span>minutes</span> away from their house. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Beverly</span> <span>asked</span> if they wanted her to <span>stay</span> with them. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Her <span>parents</span> said that she should live in the <span>dorms</span> to make more friends. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Beverly</span> agreed. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Even though <span>Beverly</span> <span>lived</span> <span>close</span> to her <span>parents</span>, she <span>barely</span> saw them because she was so <span>busy</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She did see them during <span>winter</span> <span>break</span> though.<br/>
🎧 <span>Beverly</span> wanted to <span>study</span> <span>abroad</span> in the <span>summer</span> in <span>Italy</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She <span>asked</span> her <span>parents</span> if they were okay with that. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Absolutely not! Being <span>alone</span> in a different <span>country</span> is <span>dangerous</span>! her mom said. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 But I have been <span>alone</span> for so long! Isn't this why you put me in <span>boarding</span> school to <span>begin</span> with? I know how to be <span>independent</span>. I am <span>responsible</span> and <span>smart</span> enough to go to <span>Italy</span> <span>alone</span>, she said. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Honey</span>, the <span>truth</span> is, we just wanted to <span>spend</span> <span>summer</span> with you, her dad said. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 That is when <span>Beverly</span> <span>realized</span> that even though her <span>parents</span> wanted her to be <span>independent</span>, they <span>cherished</span> spending time with her a lot.<br/>

🎧 He also does <span>abstract</span> <span>art</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 For example, a red <span>circle</span> <span>painted</span> on a <span>black</span> <span>background</span> is <span>abstract</span> <span>art</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>James</span> was at <span>community</span> <span>college</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 He just wanted to <span>draw</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 After one <span>semester</span>, he <span>decided</span> to <span>drop</span> out. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 His <span>parents</span> were <span>furious</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 How are you going to make a living? his dad <span>asked</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 By doing what I am good at, <span>James</span> said. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The very next day, <span>James</span> <span>enrolled</span> at his <span>local</span> <span>art</span> <span>college</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 His <span>dream</span> was to <span>eventually</span> become a book <span>illustrator</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>James</span> did very well at his <span>art</span> <span>college</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 He <span>won</span> a lot of <span>art</span> <span>competitions</span>.<br/>
🎧 After he <span>graduated</span>, <span>however</span>, <span>James</span> had <span>trouble</span> <span>finding</span> a <span>job</span> as a book <span>illustrator</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 There were not that many <span>positions</span> <span>available</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 After <span>three</span> <span>months</span> of not working, <span>James</span> <span>decided</span> to <span>apply</span> to different <span>jobs</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 He <span>applied</span> to <span>graphic</span> <span>design</span> <span>positions</span> and had better <span>luck</span> there. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It <span>paid</span> <span>pretty</span> well, too. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 He did not want to give up on his <span>dream</span> of <span>becoming</span> a book <span>illustrator</span>, but he was glad he was <span>making</span> money. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 His <span>parents</span> <span>apologized</span> for not <span>believing</span> in him <span>earlier</span>.<br/>
