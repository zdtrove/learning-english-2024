🎧 The principal made the announcement about the dress code in the auditorium. <br/>

🎧 The students were disgusted. <br/> 
🎧 If you have long hair, you need to wear your hair up, the Principal said. <br/> 
🎧 The girls were furious. <br/> 
🎧 Piercings and tattoos are not allowed either, Principal Baker added. <br/> 
🎧 What if we already have a tattoo? I can't remove it! a student shouted. <br/> 
🎧 That is fine. Just do your best to hide it, Principal Baker said.<br/>
🎧 Principal Baker thought everyone would be in uniform the next day. <br/> 
🎧 Instead, everyone was protesting! <br/> 
🎧 Students were carrying signs that said No Uniforms! and wearing inappropriate clothes. <br/> 
🎧 Principal Baker called everyone into the auditorium. <br/> 
🎧 I am demanding everyone to call their parents to bring them their uniform. If you do not do this, you will be suspended, Principal Baker said. <br/> 
🎧 The students knew how bad a suspension looked on their records. <br/> 
🎧 They did what Principal Baker demanded and wore their uniform every day since.<br/>

🎧 Beverly has been in boarding school since she was ten years old. <br/> 
🎧 Her parents put her in boarding school to make her a more independent person. <br/> 
🎧 Beverly was against it at first. <br/> 
🎧 She wanted to stay with her parents like most kids of her age. <br/> 
🎧 She started getting used to boarding school when she was about 15 years old. <br/> 
🎧 She would only see her parents during winter break and during the summer.<br/>
🎧 Beverly is okay with it now, because she is so used to not seeing her parents. <br/> 
🎧 Whenever she sees her parents though, they spend almost every day together. <br/> 
🎧 However, Beverly is going to attend a university near her parents. <br/> 
🎧 In fact, the university is only 20 minutes away from their house. <br/> 
🎧 Beverly asked if they wanted her to stay with them. <br/> 
🎧 Her parents said that she should live in the dorms to make more friends. <br/> 
🎧 Beverly agreed. <br/> 
🎧 Even though Beverly lived close to her parents, she barely saw them because she was so busy. <br/> 
🎧 She did see them during winter break though.<br/>
🎧 Beverly wanted to study abroad in the summer in Italy. <br/> 
🎧 She asked her parents if they were okay with that. <br/> 
🎧 Absolutely not! Being alone in a different country is dangerous! her mom said. <br/> 
🎧 But I have been alone for so long! Isn't this why you put me in boarding school to begin with? I know how to be independent. I am responsible and smart enough to go to Italy alone, she said. <br/> 
🎧 Honey, the truth is, we just wanted to spend summer with you, her dad said. <br/> 
🎧 That is when Beverly realized that even though her parents wanted her to be independent, they cherished spending time with her a lot.<br/>

🎧 James was always good at painting and drawing. <br/> 
🎧 He could paint faces and buildings accurately. <br/> 
🎧 He could come up with original artwork, too. <br/> 
🎧 He also does abstract art. <br/> 
🎧 Abstract art is art that uses shapes, colors, forms, and textures, but does not represent real objects. <br/> 
🎧 For example, a red circle painted on a black background is abstract art. <br/> 
🎧 However, James knew that art was not the most stable career.<br/>
🎧 James was at community college. <br/> 
🎧 His parents wanted him to get an Associate Degree. <br/> 
🎧 James hated community college though. <br/> 
🎧 He didn't care about math, science, or English. <br/> 
🎧 He just wanted to draw. <br/> 
🎧 After one semester, he decided to drop out. <br/> 
🎧 His parents were furious. <br/> 
🎧 How are you going to make a living? his dad asked. <br/> 
🎧 By doing what I am good at, James said. <br/> 
🎧 The very next day, James enrolled at his local art college. <br/> 
🎧 His dream was to eventually become a book illustrator. <br/> 
🎧 James did very well at his art college. <br/> 
🎧 He won a lot of art competitions.<br/>
🎧 After he graduated, however, James had trouble finding a job as a book illustrator. <br/> 
🎧 There were not that many positions available. <br/> 
🎧 After three months of not working, James decided to apply to different jobs. <br/> 
🎧 He applied to graphic design positions and had better luck there. <br/> 
🎧 It paid pretty well, too. <br/> 
🎧 He did not want to give up on his dream of becoming a book illustrator, but he was glad he was making money. <br/> 
🎧 His parents apologized for not believing in him earlier.<br/>

🎧 Fishing for compliments means trying to get people to give you compliments. <br/>
