🎧 Everyone at Jefferson High School was reading How to Save a Life, which was a book about a student's journey in medical school. <br/> 
🎧 The book got really popular around the United States. <br/> 
🎧 It will become a movie some time in 2021. <br/> 
🎧 Some students were ahead of others in the book. <br/> 
🎧 Some students were already done with the book. <br/> 
🎧 Laura was halfway through with the book. <br/> 
🎧 She really liked it and could hardly put it down. <br/> 
🎧 She just finished the chapter where the main character falls in love with a patient who is dying of cancer.<br/>
🎧 Laura's friends already finished the book, so she told them not to give any spoilers. <br/> 
🎧 Spoilers are parts of the story that reveal important details before a person gets to that part of the story. <br/> 
🎧 Spoilers ruin the fun of not knowing. <br/> 
🎧 It's like knowing how a movie ends when you are just starting to watch the movie. <br/> 
🎧 Laura's friend was about to say something about the book, but Laura stopped her. <br/> 
🎧 No spoilers, guys! I want to enjoy this book, she said.<br/>
🎧 Laura was reading the book on the bus. <br/> 
🎧 A couple on the bus started talking about the book. <br/> 
🎧 Laura started to panic. <br/> 
🎧 She put on her headphones and listened to music throughout the entire bus ride. <br/> 
🎧 Laura continued reading the book when she got home. <br/> 
🎧 Her mom came into her room. <br/> 
🎧 That is such a good book! I'm so glad you're reading it. Have you got to the part when the main character is told she also has cancer? her mom said. <br/> 
🎧 MOM! I'm only halfway! Laura exclaimed. <br/> 
🎧 Her mom apologized. <br/> 
🎧 Laura put the book back in her bookshelf and never touched it again.<br/>

🎧 Technology is such a big part of teenagers' lives. <br/> 
🎧 Teenagers are always on social media, uploading pictures, replying to people, and more. <br/> 
🎧 Because the use of technology is becoming more and more popular, cyberbullying has become a trend too. <br/> 
🎧 Cyberbullying is bullying done online. <br/> 
🎧 This includes texting mean things about people, posting private photos of others, and more. <br/> 
🎧 One of the many bad things about cyberbullying is that one can be anonymous, which means that no one would know that he or she is the one cyberbullying someone.<br/>
🎧 Michelle was scrolling on Facebook one day. <br/> 
🎧 A photo of her face photoshopped onto a fat person was on Facebook. <br/> 
🎧 Michelle was shocked. <br/> 
🎧 Who made this? <br/> 
🎧 She looked at who posted it and it was someone with the username chubbybunny94. <br/> 
🎧 She asked her friends if they knew who was behind this. <br/> 
🎧 Unfortunately no one knew. <br/> 
🎧 At school, the next day people made fun of her. <br/> 
🎧 It was annoying, but Michelle didn't care too much because she knew she was not fat. <br/> 
🎧 During lunch time, however, it got out of control. <br/> 
🎧 A classmate threw a piece of cake at her face and said, Eat it fatty! Michelle ran to the bathroom and cried.<br/>
🎧 Michelle's friends told the principal about what happened. <br/> 
🎧 The principal made an announcement at every 11th grade classroom saying that if the cyberbully does not confess, he will call the police. <br/> 
🎧 A couple of days later, the cyberbully confessed. <br/> 
🎧 It was John. <br/> 
🎧 He did it because he was mad at Michelle for refusing to help him cheat on a test. <br/> 
🎧 John was suspended for three days. <br/> 
🎧 Michelle feels better.<br/>
