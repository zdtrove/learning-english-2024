🎧 <span>John</span> and <span>Betty</span> have been <span>dating</span> for <span>five</span> years. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They got together at the end of <span>college</span>, but they were friends before. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>John</span> and <span>Betty</span> were a good <span>couple</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They <span>rarely</span> <span>fought</span>, they never got <span>jealous</span>, and they <span>respected</span> each other. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They <span>managed</span> to make <span>problems</span> go away. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 For example, after <span>college</span>, <span>John</span> was planning to go to <span>medical</span> school in <span>Washington</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Betty</span> was planning to <span>stay</span> in <span>California</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>However</span>, they <span>talked</span> it out and <span>John</span> <span>decided</span> to <span>enroll</span> in a <span>medical</span> school in <span>California</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 He didn't <span>mind</span> <span>changing</span> his <span>plans</span> for <span>Betty</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She was <span>worth</span> it.<br/>
🎧 Right now, <span>John</span> is in <span>residency</span>, which <span>means</span> that he has <span>finished</span> <span>medical</span> school and is now working under a <span>doctor</span> at a <span>hospital</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Betty</span> is an <span>investment</span> <span>banker</span> at <span>Wells</span> <span>Fargo</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Betty</span> <span>feels</span> that they have been <span>dating</span> long enough to get <span>married</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They have been living together for almost <span>four</span> years. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They <span>knew</span> each <span>other's</span> <span>habits</span> and were <span>comfortable</span> with each other. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Over dinner, <span>Betty</span> <span>brings</span> it up. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>John</span> <span>sighs</span>.<br/>
🎧 I want to get <span>married</span> at some <span>point</span>, but not now. I am trying to pay off my <span>medical</span> school <span>debt</span>, he said.<br/>
🎧 Why don't we just <span>borrow</span> some money from my <span>parents</span>? They wouldn't <span>mind</span>! <span>Betty</span> said. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>True</span>, but I would, he said. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Let go of your <span>pride</span>, <span>Betty</span> said. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We'll get <span>married</span> <span>eventually</span>, don't <span>worry</span>. At the end of the day, <span>marriage</span> doesn't mean that much. As long as we love each other, that's okay, <span>John</span> said. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 He has a <span>point</span>, she thought. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Betty</span> <span>believed</span> that they would be together <span>forever</span>.<br/>

🎧 At <span>Sunflower</span> <span>Middle</span> School, the <span>8th</span> <span>graders</span> would all go to the <span>amusement</span> <span>park</span> to <span>celebrate</span> the <span>graduation</span> and finally <span>entering</span> high school. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Robert's</span> group of friends were all <span>excited</span> to go, but he wasn't. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>truth</span> was that <span>Robert</span> was <span>afraid</span> of <span>heights</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 A lot of the <span>rides</span> at the <span>amusement</span> <span>park</span> were <span>fast</span> and high. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Robert</span> didn't want to <span>admit</span> to his friends that he was <span>afraid</span> of <span>heights</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They would probably make fun of him and tell him he's not being a man.<br/>
🎧 <span>Robert</span> told his <span>teacher</span> that he had a <span>family</span> <span>trip</span> that day. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 But <span>Robert</span>, it's a free <span>trip</span> to one of the most <span>popular</span> <span>amusement</span> <span>parks</span> in <span>America</span>! his <span>teacher</span> said. <span><br/></span>

🎧 This was <span>true</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe he can just go on the <span>rides</span> that are not <span>roller</span> <span>coasters</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Michael</span> <span>decided</span> to go. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 He did want to see his friends one last time.<br/>
🎧 At the <span>amusement</span> <span>park</span>, his friends wanted to go on the <span>tallest</span> <span>ride</span> first. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Robert</span> <span>felt</span> his <span>hands</span> <span>shaking</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 His friends all got in <span>line</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 As they got <span>closer</span> to the <span>front</span> of the <span>line</span>, <span>Robert's</span> <span>hands</span> <span>started</span> <span>sweating</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 When they <span>reached</span> the <span>front</span>, <span>Robert</span> couldn't move. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Robert</span>, come on! It's our <span>turn</span>, one of his friends said. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I'm too <span>scared</span>. I can't, he said. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Just try it, you might like it, his friend said. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Robert</span> took a <span>deep</span> <span>breath</span> and went on the <span>ride</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 He <span>closed</span> his <span>eyes</span> and the <span>roller</span> <span>coaster</span> took off. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Robert</span> actually <span>liked</span> it! <span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>Deborah</span> had to move to a new high school though. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She <span>missed</span> all her old friends already, but was looking forward to <span>meeting</span> new people.<br/>
🎧 On her first day of school, <span>Deborah</span> <span>introduced</span> <span>herself</span> to the class. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>guys</span> in the class <span>started</span> <span>whispering</span> about how <span>pretty</span> she was. <span><br/></span>
