🎧 Maria was an intern at a law firm. <br/> 
🎧 Her eventual goal was to become an environmental lawyer. <br/> 
🎧 Getting an internship was a great way to learn more and make her resume look better. <br/> 
🎧 The internship was unpaid, but she was okay with that.<br/>
🎧 Maria was nervous on her first day. <br/> 
🎧 She made sure she looked professional. <br/> 
🎧 She wore a white collared shirt, a navy blue blazer, a pencil skirt, and black heels. <br/> 
🎧 She put her hair in a ponytail and wore a pearl necklace.<br/>
🎧 Maria entered the law firm and looked around her. <br/> 
🎧 Everyone looked so busy and professional. <br/> 
🎧 She liked that. <br/> 
🎧 Maria went to her boss Susan. <br/> 
🎧 Susan has been a lawyer for twenty years and won many of her cases. <br/> 
🎧 Susan looked mean, but Maria was ready to make her like her. <br/> 
🎧 Maria and Susan shook hands. <br/> 
🎧 Susan had a firm grip. <br/> 
🎧 First, I want you to get me a cup of coffee. No creamer or sugar, she said. <br/> 
🎧 Sure! What would you like me to do next? Maria asked. <br/> 
🎧 I'll let you know after you get me my coffee, Susan said.<br/>
🎧 Maria came back with the coffee. <br/> 
🎧 Susan took the coffee and drank it. <br/> 
🎧 Okay, now I want you to drive to the nearest grocery store and buy my groceries, she said. <br/> 
🎧 Maria was shocked. <br/> 
🎧 She thought she would be doing more important work. <br/> 
🎧 What does this have to do with law? Maria asked. <br/> 
🎧 Are you questioning my knowledge of law? Susan asked. <br/> 
🎧 Maria immediately froze. <br/> 
🎧 She shook her head no. <br/> 
🎧 She obeyed her orders and then sent Susan an email saying that she quit.<br/>

🎧 Margaret always liked taking pictures. <br/> 
🎧 She believed that a picture can make anything beautiful. <br/> 
🎧 She brought her camera everywhere even if she was doing simple tasks like going grocery shopping. <br/> 
🎧 Margaret especially liked taking pictures of her friends when they didn't expect it. <br/> 
🎧 She liked capturing people's natural reactions. <br/> 
🎧 Some of Margaret's friends didn't like it when she did this though.<br/>
🎧 Margaret had a website where she put samples of her photography. <br/> 
🎧 There were some pictures of people, some pictures of views, and some pictures of food. <br/> 
🎧 She decided to offer her skills for money. <br/> 
🎧 People could fill out a form on her website requesting her to take pictures of them. <br/> 
🎧 Her rate was $30 per hour. <br/> 
🎧 She wasn't getting that many requests. <br/> 
🎧 It made her feel like her work wasn't good. <br/> 
🎧 Her friend suggested advertising her website on social media. <br/> 
🎧 Once she did that, more requests came in.<br/>
🎧 Day after day, people would request Margaret to take their pictures. <br/> 
🎧 In June, there were over 50 requests because people wanted graduation pictures. <br/> 
🎧 Margaret had to stop taking requests though because she was too busy. <br/> 
🎧 Margaret made a lot of money from taking pictures. <br/> 
🎧 She used the money to buy a new camera.<br/>

🎧 Nancy was just so messy. <br/>

🎧 John and Betty have been dating for five years. <br/> 
🎧 They got together at the end of college, but they were friends before. <br/> 
🎧 John and Betty were a good couple. <br/> 
🎧 They rarely fought, they never got jealous, and they respected each other. <br/> 
🎧 They managed to make problems go away. <br/> 
🎧 For example, after college, John was planning to go to medical school in Washington. <br/> 
🎧 Betty was planning to stay in California. <br/> 
🎧 However, they talked it out and John decided to enroll in a medical school in California. <br/> 
🎧 He didn't mind changing his plans for Betty. <br/>

🎧 Betty feels that they have been dating long enough to get married. <br/> 
🎧 They have been living together for almost four years. <br/> 
🎧 They knew each other's habits and were comfortable with each other. <br/> 
🎧 Over dinner, Betty brings it up. <br/>

🎧 I want to get married at some point, but not now. I am trying to pay off my medical school debt, he said.<br/>
🎧 Why don't we just borrow some money from my parents? They wouldn't mind! Betty said. <br/> 
🎧 True, but I would, he said. <br/> 
🎧 Let go of your pride, Betty said. <br/> 
🎧 We'll get married eventually, don't worry. At the end of the day, marriage doesn't mean that much. As long as we love each other, that's okay, John said. <br/> 
🎧 He has a point, she thought. <br/> 
🎧 Betty believed that they would be together forever.<br/>

🎧 Deborah was originally from Nebraska. <br/> 
🎧 Her family moved to California because her dad found a great job opportunity there. <br/> 
🎧 He would be getting paid much more than he was getting in Nebraska. <br/> 
🎧 He was an engineer, and engineers are high in demand in California. <br/> 
🎧 Deborah had to move to a new high school though. <br/> 
🎧 She missed all her old friends already, but was looking forward to meeting new people.<br/>
🎧 On her first day of school, Deborah introduced herself to the class. <br/> 
🎧 The guys in the class started whispering about how pretty she was. <br/> 
🎧 Some of the girls nodded in agreement while some of the girls just rolled their eyes in jealousy. <br/> 
🎧 After Deborah introduced herself, there was an announcement about Homecoming, a tradition welcoming back the students to school. <br/> 
🎧 The announcement invited all students to run for Homecoming Queen and King. <br/> 
🎧 Deborah would have run if she was back in Nebraska, but she didn't know anyone in California.<br/>

🎧 Hi! You're new! I'm Kimberly. I'm in your homeroom class, she said. <br/> 
🎧 I would, but nobody knows me. I don't stand a chance, Deborah said. <br/> 
🎧 Yes, you do. Everyone is already talking about you and calling you the 'Pretty New Girl'. Also, the main competitor is Sarah, but all the girls don't want her to win because she won last year and she's really mean. <br/>
