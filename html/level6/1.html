🎧 A different hairstyle or color can change a person's entire look. <br/> 
🎧 It can make a person look better or worse. <br/> 
🎧 Jean was about to enter her first day of college. <br/> 
🎧 She wanted a new look. <br/> 
🎧 Her current hairstyle was nice, but it was boring. <br/> 
🎧 She had it since she was a 9th grader. <br/> 
🎧 Her hair right now was straight, long, and blonde.<br/>
🎧 She went into the hair salon and asked for the hairstylist. <br/> 
🎧 What kind of look are you going for? the hairstylist asked. <br/> 
🎧 I want to look like a model, Jean said. <br/> 
🎧 Well, we can add layers to your hair. <br/> 
🎧 We can also make your hair more blonde, the hairstylist said. <br/> 
🎧 That sounds good! Jean said. <br/> 
🎧 Jean sat in the chair while the hairstylist cut her hair. <br/> 
🎧 Jean couldn't see herself in the mirror because she didn't have her glasses on. <br/> 
🎧 She just trusted the hairstylist. <br/> 
🎧 An hour later, the hairstylist said, Done! Jean put on her glasses and looked at herself. <br/> 
🎧 She looked totally different! <br/> 
🎧 She liked it, but felt strange. <br/> 
🎧 She could barely even recognize herself.<br/>
🎧 Jean asked her friends and family what they thought. <br/> 
🎧 Most of them liked it. <br/> 
🎧 They said it made her look edgier, but very different. <br/> 
🎧 In fact, when she met up with her friends, they asked who she was. <br/> 
🎧 One of them even tried calling the police when Jean showed up in front of her house.<br/>
🎧 When Jean was shopping with her friends at the mall, a model scout came up to her and asked if she would consider modeling. <br/> 
🎧 Jean said she would think about it and took his business card. <br/> 
🎧 The new hairstyle was really working out for her.<br/><br/>

🎧 Ophelia's work schedule was 9 p.m. to 4 a.m. <br/> 
🎧 Ophelia would sleep during the day while most people were at work. <br/> 
🎧 For the first year of work, Ophelia had a hard time adjusting to the schedule. <br/> 
🎧 She had trouble sleeping during the afternoon. <br/>

🎧 After lunch, she would watch her favorite TV show. <br/> 
🎧 After that, she would sleep.<br/>
🎧 The hospital informed the employees that they could send requests to change the time of their shift. <br/> 
🎧 Ophelia was excited about this and immediately sent in a request to change her shift. <br/> 
🎧 A couple of weeks later, the manager gave Ophelia a letter. <br/> 
🎧 The letter stated that her request was rejected.<br/>
🎧 Ophelia was shocked. <br/> 
🎧 She went to her manager and asked him why. <br/> 
🎧 He said that many night shift workers who requested an earlier shift were elderly. <br/> 
🎧 Ophelia was only 25. <br/> 
🎧 The manager thought that the older employees needed an earlier shift more than Ophelia did.<br/>
🎧 Ophelia was mad at first, but she thought about the older employees. <br/> 
🎧 Their bones were aching and they're tired. <br/> 
🎧 They do need it more than her.<br/><br />
