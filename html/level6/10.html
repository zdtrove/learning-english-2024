🎧 Adam did not want to be in school that long. <br/> 
🎧 Medical school is also very expensive. <br/> 
🎧 Getting into medical school is hard, too.<br/>

🎧 A lot of people have told him the same thing.<br/>
🎧 I get why you would say that, but there are a lot of male nurses these days. <br/>

🎧 They weren't happy about it at first. <br/> 
🎧 After his first year of nursing school, however, they saw how happy he was.<br/>
