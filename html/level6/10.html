🎧 He wouldn't have to be in school that long and he <span>liked</span> the work better. <span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>Adam</span> <span>expected</span> them to say this. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 A lot of people have told him the same thing.<br/>
🎧 I get why you would say that, but there are a lot of <span>male</span> <span>nurses</span> these <span>days</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They are <span>paid</span> well too, and don't have to work long hours, <span>Adam</span> said. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 His <span>parents</span> <span>accepted</span> his <span>wishes</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They weren't happy about it at first. <span><br/></span>
