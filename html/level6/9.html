🎧 Diana wanted to be a model. <br/> 
🎧 She went to a lot of casting calls. <br/> 
🎧 She wanted to be hired to walk as a runway model. <br/> 
🎧 She also wanted to do advertisements, but those were harder to get. <br/> 
🎧 Diana had a hard time getting hired because she looked a lot like another model named Amy. <br/> 
🎧 Amy was an established model who has done many advertisements, commercials, and fashion shows. <br/> 
🎧 She was very famous. <br/> 
🎧 People did not want to hire Diana because there was already an Amy.<br/>
🎧 Diana thought she looked different though. <br/> 
🎧 She thought her face was more round. <br/> 
🎧 She was also skinnier. <br/> 
🎧 Diana went to an audition for a Gucci commercial. <br/> 
🎧 Gucci is an expensive clothing and accessories brand. <br/> 
🎧 At the audition, Diana spotted Amy. <br/> 
🎧 In fact, Diana was right after her. <br/> 
🎧 There was no way she was going to get hired. <br/> 
🎧 After Amy finished her audition, Diana went up to the front. <br/> 
🎧 Wow, didn't you just do your audition? the casting director asked. <br/> 
🎧 No, that was Amy. I'm Diana, she said.<br/>
🎧 Diana performed her audition. <br/> 
🎧 She thought she did a good job. <br/> 
🎧 She did all the right poses. <br/> 
🎧 She knew she looked great, but she was worried about Amy. <br/> 
🎧 A couple of weeks later, Diana got a call from the casting director saying that she was hired. <br/> 
🎧 Just curious, what made you guys want to hire me over Amy? Diana asked. <br/> 
🎧 We wanted someone new. Amy is everywhere, he said. <br/> 
🎧 Diana was so happy. <br/> 
🎧 She celebrated by buying herself a necklace.<br/>

🎧 Paula was from Los Angeles, California. <br/> 
🎧 Los Angeles has warm weather all year round. <br/> 
🎧 People joke that Los Angeles has no seasons. <br/> 
🎧 It never snows, even during the winter. <br/> 
🎧 The temperature never goes below 0 degrees. <br/> 
🎧 People from Los Angeles can't handle cold weather. <br/> 
🎧 Paula was very used to the warm weather in Los Angeles. <br/> 
🎧 However, she has to move to Minnesota for school. <br/> 
🎧 It is very cold in Minnesota, especially during the winter. <br/> 
🎧 Paula is worried that she can't handle it.<br/>
🎧 Paula is buying many warm clothing items and accessories to prepare herself. <br/> 
🎧 She has bought mittens, boots, rain boots, long coats, and jackets. <br/> 
🎧 Her first day in Minnesota was rough. <br/> 
🎧 Even though she was wearing five layers, she felt extremely cold. <br/> 
🎧 A stranger passed by her and said, You must be from California. How did you know? she asked. <br/> 
🎧 You're shivering even though you're wearing five layers, he said. <br/> 
🎧 The man was only wearing a single long sleeve shirt.<br/>
🎧 Paula's body could not take the cold the first week. <br/> 
🎧 She got the cold. <br/> 
🎧 She called her parents saying she wanted to move back. <br/> 
🎧 They encouraged her to stick with Minnesota. <br/> 
🎧 After a couple of weeks, Paula started to get used to the cold weather. <br/> 
🎧 She started wearing less clothes and shivering less. <br/> 
🎧 That's the great thing about human bodies - they adapt so we can survive.<br/>

🎧 Movie hopping is seeing multiple movies when you only paid to see one. <br/> 
🎧 Many people movie hop. <br/> 
🎧 It is very easy to do it. <br/> 
🎧 Most of the time you don't get caught. <br/> 
🎧 Norma got caught though. <br/> 
🎧 She did it a lot. <br/> 
🎧 The most movies she ever saw in one day was seven. <br/> 
🎧 She saved so much money. <br/> 
🎧 Her friends usually did it with her if it was just two movies. <br/> 
🎧 But if it was over two movies, they just left her. <br/> 
🎧 They thought three movies were too much.<br/>
🎧 Norma went out on a date with Steven, who asked her what she wanted to do. <br/> 
🎧 She said she wanted to go to the movie theater. <br/> 
🎧 He said okay. <br/> 
🎧 They went to see a documentary on whales. <br/> 
🎧 After that, Norma suggested seeing another movie. <br/> 
🎧 Okay, let me just pay for it at the front, Steven said. <br/> 
🎧 No need for that! We can just walk into the next one, she said. <br/> 
🎧 Isn't that illegal? Steven asked. <br/> 
🎧 I mean yes, but everyone does it, she said. <br/> 
🎧 Not me. I think it's wrong. The movie industry loses a lot of money and that affects the employees at the theater, actors, and actresses, he said.<br/>
🎧 Actors and actresses make so much money. <br/> 
🎧 They will be fine. <br/> 
🎧 Also employees get the same hourly wage no matter what, Norma said. <br/> 
🎧 I don't think I can date you. We have very different ideals, he said. <br/> 
🎧 I agree, she said. <br/> 
🎧 Steven left the movie theater while Norma stayed. <br/> 
🎧 She watched three more movies that day.<br/>

🎧 Julia was known around school for having the best handwriting. <br/> 
🎧 It was unique, clear, and consistent. <br/> 
🎧 No matter how fast she wrote, it always looked the same. <br/> 
🎧 Her handwriting was almost like a computer font. <br/> 
🎧 Marilyn, on the other hand, had very messy handwriting. <br/> 
🎧 When people see Marilyn's handwriting, they think that it belongs to a guy. <br/> 
🎧 If Marilyn wrote fast, you couldn't even tell what she wrote. <br/>

🎧 Marilyn was embarrassed of her handwriting and did not want her boyfriend to think less of her.<br/>

🎧 I don't think you should lie to him like that. What if he finds out one day? He'll think you are a liar, Julia said. <br/> 
🎧 He will never find out. Can you please write it for me? Here, I typed out what I want to say, Marilyn said. <br/>
