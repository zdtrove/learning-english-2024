🎧 <span>Norma</span> got <span>caught</span> though. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She did it a lot. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The most <span>movies</span> she ever saw in one day was <span>seven</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She <span>saved</span> so much money. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Her friends usually did it with her if it was just two <span>movies</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 But if it was over two <span>movies</span>, they just <span>left</span> her. <span><br/></span>

🎧 No need for that! We can just <span>walk</span> into the next one, she said. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Isn't that <span>illegal</span>? <span>Steven</span> <span>asked</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I mean yes, but everyone does it, she said. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Not me. I think it's wrong. The movie <span>industry</span> <span>loses</span> a lot of money and that <span>affects</span> the <span>employees</span> at the <span>theater</span>, <span>actors</span>, and <span>actresses</span>, he said.<br/>
🎧 <span>Actors</span> and <span>actresses</span> make so much money. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They will be fine. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Also <span>employees</span> get the same <span>hourly</span> <span>wage</span> no <span>matter</span> what, <span>Norma</span> said. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I don't think I can date you. We have very different <span>ideals</span>, he said. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I agree, she said. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Steven</span> <span>left</span> the movie <span>theater</span> while <span>Norma</span> <span>stayed</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 The <span>landlord</span> does not <span>allow</span> them to have <span>pets</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Jacqueline</span> was <span>disappointed</span> by this because she always wanted to have a dog. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Her <span>roommate</span> <span>Wanda</span> <span>suggested</span> that they get a <span>fish</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 A <span>fish</span> would be easy to take <span>care</span> of. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They never had to <span>worry</span> about the <span>landlord</span> <span>finding</span> out because there were no <span>video</span> <span>cameras</span> inside their <span>apartment</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Jacqueline</span> <span>bought</span> the <span>fish</span> from a pet <span>store</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 They took a lot of <span>pictures</span> with the <span>fish</span>, too.<br/>
🎧 After a <span>couple</span> of <span>weeks</span>, <span>however</span>, they <span>started</span> to get <span>bored</span> of their <span>fish</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 A <span>fish</span> is not like a dog. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 You can't run with it or pet it or <span>dress</span> it up. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Neither</span> <span>Jacqueline</span> <span>nor</span> <span>Wanda</span> wanted to take <span>care</span> of it. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It's your <span>turn</span> to <span>feed</span> him! <span>Wanda</span> <span>yelled</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Ugh</span>! Fine! <span>Jacqueline</span> said. <span><br/></span>
