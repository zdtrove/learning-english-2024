🎧 <span>Irene</span> would have to get <span>100%</span> on the <span>exam</span> to <span>push</span> her <span>grade</span> to an A. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>teacher</span> <span>offered</span> the students <span>extra</span> <span>credit</span> if they <span>brought</span> their mom to <span>Bring</span> Your Mom to <span>Campus</span> day. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Irene</span> <span>decided</span> that this year was going to be the year she told her <span>secret</span> to everyone. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Irene</span> told her mom that she wanted to tell everyone about their <span>relationship</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Irene's</span> mom agreed.<br/>
🎧 On <span>Bring</span> Your Mom to <span>Campus</span> day, <span>Irene</span> <span>brought</span> her mom to her <span>Calculus</span> class. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Hi, our <span>Principal</span>. What <span>brings</span> you here? <span>asked</span> the <span>Calculus</span> <span>teacher</span>. <span><br/></span>
