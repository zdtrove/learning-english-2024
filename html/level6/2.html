🎧 Irene has a secret. <br/> 
🎧 Her mom is the Principal at her high school. <br/> 
🎧 She doesn't want anyone to know because her classmates would think that she gets special treatment. <br/> 
🎧 Not even her friends know about the secret. <br/> 
🎧 When her friends ask to go to her house, she just says that her parents don't allow guests. <br/> 
🎧 Irene's mom also never told anyone that her daughter goes to the high school she works at.<br/>
🎧 Bring Your Mom to Campus day was coming up and Irene usually told her friends in the past years that her mom was out of town. <br/> 
🎧 What does your mom even do? her friend asked. <br/> 
🎧 She is a cancer researcher, so she travels a lot. <br/> 
🎧 Funny enough, Irene's mom was always at Bring Your Mom to Campus day. <br/> 
🎧 The Vice Principal once asked her, Do you have a daughter? Irene's mom said, Yes, she is in college now.<br/>
🎧 Irene was very close to getting an A in her Calculus class. <br/> 
🎧 There was only one exam left. <br/> 
🎧 Irene would have to get 100% on the exam to push her grade to an A. <br/> 
🎧 The teacher offered the students extra credit if they brought their mom to Bring Your Mom to Campus day. <br/> 
🎧 Irene decided that this year was going to be the year she told her secret to everyone. <br/> 
🎧 Irene told her mom that she wanted to tell everyone about their relationship. <br/> 
🎧 Irene's mom agreed.<br/>
🎧 On Bring Your Mom to Campus day, Irene brought her mom to her Calculus class. <br/> 
🎧 Hi, our Principal. What brings you here? asked the Calculus teacher. <br/> 
🎧 I'm actually Irene's mom, she said.<br/><br/>

🎧 Julia always felt average. <br/> 
🎧 She did not have any special talents, but she also was not bad at anything in particular. <br/> 
🎧 She always got Bs in class. <br/> 
🎧 She was neither fat nor skinny. <br/> 
🎧 She could run a mile, but not much more. <br/> 
🎧 Most people felt neutral about her. <br/> 
🎧 She wore nice clothes, but nothing unique. <br/> 
🎧 She wanted to be better than average at something, but whenever she tried, she fell short. <br/> 
🎧 When she took an advanced math class, she found herself struggling. <br/> 
🎧 She joined the basketball team, but she was not very good.<br/>
🎧 As Julia was walking to school, she suddenly felt something in her head. <br/>

🎧 It was hard to eat healthy at school. <br/> 
🎧 It was even harder when Jessica entered college. <br/> 
🎧 Everywhere she went it seemed as if she was surrounded by unhealthy food. <br/>

🎧 She decided to start by cutting out coffee. <br/> 
🎧 At first it was hard since she drank coffee almost every day. <br/> 
🎧 By the end of the week, she felt better. <br/> 
🎧 She was also saving a lot of money by not having to buy a drink every day, which quickly added up.<br/>
🎧 The next step she took was to incorporate more healthy food into her diet. <br/> 
🎧 Instead of eating burgers and sandwiches so often, she decided to eat salads every other day. <br/> 
🎧 She found that salads were just as quick and cheap as burgers. <br/> 
🎧 This made her feel more refreshed and energized. <br/> 
🎧 She found herself less sleepy and more focused in class. <br/>
