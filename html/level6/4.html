🎧 Her family and friends were excited for her. <br/> 
🎧 Harvard was known for being hard to get into. <br/> 
🎧 Even if you got straight As in high school, you could get rejected. <br/> 
🎧 You have to also be very involved in school, do volunteer work, and write well. <br/> 
🎧 Pamela immediately knew that she wanted to go to Harvard, but she was worried about money. <br/> 
🎧 Harvard was a private school, so it was expensive.<br/>
🎧 Two weeks later, she got an email from Harvard telling her what she got for financial aid. <br/> 
🎧 Pamela did not get as much aid as she hoped for. <br/>

🎧 Harvard offered Pamela a lot of loans but not much grants. <br/> 
🎧 Pamela told her parents that she would not go to Harvard. <br/>

🎧 In the end, she managed to get $3000 from scholarships. <br/> 
🎧 This was a good start. She would get a job at Harvard while she took classes.<br/>
