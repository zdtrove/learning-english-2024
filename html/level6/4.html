🎧 <span>Thankfully</span>, <span>Max</span> <span>barked</span> and <span>Donald</span> was able to <span>stop</span> the <span>robber</span> in time. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Sometimes though, <span>Max</span> would <span>bark</span> when he saw another dog. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Donald</span> would go outside thinking something bad was <span>happening</span>, but it was really just another dog.<br/>

🎧 <span>Donald</span> came back home from school and <span>filled</span> up <span>Max's</span> water <span>bowl</span> as <span>usual</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Except</span> this time, <span>Max</span> did not run to the water <span>bowl</span> like he usually did. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Donald</span> <span>looked</span> around the house for <span>Max</span> and <span>found</span> him <span>lying</span> down on the <span>floor</span> <span>dead</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 There are two <span>types</span> of <span>financial</span> <span>aid</span>: <span>grants</span> and <span>loans</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>Pamela</span> told her <span>parents</span> that she would not go to <span>Harvard</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 They have been <span>married</span> for ten years. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They both <span>felt</span> that they <span>married</span> each other too young. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Harold</span> <span>felt</span> like he had <span>changed</span> a lot since then. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 When he was <span>23</span>, he was <span>ambitious</span>, <span>competitive</span>, and sometimes even <span>harsh</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 He had <span>plans</span> to be a <span>CEO</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Now, he was more <span>relaxed</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 He was okay with not having a <span>high-paying</span> <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Darlene</span> wanted the <span>23-year-old</span> <span>version</span> of <span>Harold</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She was <span>ambitious</span> too, and wanted to be a <span>power</span> <span>couple</span>. <span><br/></span>

🎧 She does not know who she will be living with. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Usually the <span>mother</span> <span>gets</span> full <span>custody</span> of the <span>child</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 If <span>Christina</span> <span>stays</span> with her dad, she will be living in a <span>smaller</span> house, but she does not <span>mind</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She is <span>closer</span> to her dad. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They get along better. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 If <span>Christina</span> <span>stays</span> with her mom, she could <span>spend</span> more money because <span>Darlene</span> is <span>rich</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Christina</span> is not that <span>close</span> to her mom though. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Her mom does not show love often.<br/>
🎧 <span>Harold</span> and <span>Darlene</span> <span>decided</span> that <span>Christina</span> should still see both of them. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Harold</span> <span>asked</span> <span>Darlene</span> if she was <span>considering</span> another <span>husband</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Darlene</span> said she <span>eventually</span> wanted to get <span>married</span> again. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Harold</span> <span>wished</span> her good <span>luck</span>.<br/>

🎧 You <span>guys</span> don't even <span>smell</span> anything. If I did not tell you, you would not be doing that, <span>Joyce</span> said. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 They all made <span>excuses</span> to leave her house.<br/>
🎧 <span>Joyce</span> was <span>disappointed</span> in them. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She thought they were being <span>immature</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 She <span>decided</span> to do the <span>project</span> by <span>herself</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Joyce</span> <span>presented</span> her <span>project</span> in <span>front</span> of the <span>entire</span> class. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It was on <span>showering</span> <span>daily</span> and how <span>scientists</span> have <span>proved</span> that it was not <span>necessary</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>teacher</span> was <span>impressed</span> and gave <span>Joyce</span> an <span>A+</span>. <span><br/></span>
