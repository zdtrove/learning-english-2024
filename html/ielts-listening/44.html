🎧 Hi Alex. It's Martha Clines here.<br/>
🎧 James White gave me your number.<br/>
🎧 I hope you don't mind me calling you.<br/>
🎧 Of course not. How are you, Martha?<br/>
🎧 Good thanks.<br/>
🎧 I'm ringing because I need a bit of advice.<br/>
🎧 Oh yeah. What about?<br/>
🎧 The training you did at JPNW a few years ago.<br/>
🎧 I'm applying for the same thing.<br/>
🎧 Oh right. Yes, I did mine in 2014.<br/>
🎧 Best thing I ever did. I'm still working there.<br/>
🎧 Really? What are you doing?<br/>
🎧 Well, now I work in the customer services department<br/>
🎧 but I did my initial training in Finance.<br/>
🎧 I stayed there for the first two years and then moved to where I am now.<br/>
🎧 That's the same department I'm applying for.<br/>
🎧 Did you enjoy it?<br/>
🎧 I was pretty nervous to begin with.<br/>
🎧 I didn't do well in my exams at school<br/>
🎧 and I was really worried because I failed Maths.<br/>
🎧 But it didn't actually matter because I did lots of courses on the job.<br/>
🎧 Did you get a diploma at the end of your trainee period?<br/>
🎧 I'm hoping to do the one in business skills.<br/>
🎧 Yes. That sounds good.<br/>
🎧 I took the one on IT skills but I wish I'd done that one instead.<br/>
🎧 OK, that's good to know.<br/>
🎧 What about the other trainees?<br/>
🎧 How did you get on with them?<br/>
🎧 There were about 20 of us who started at the same time<br/>
🎧 and we were all around the same age.<br/>
🎧 I was 18 and there was only one person younger than me, who was 17.<br/>
🎧 The rest were between 18 and 20.<br/>
🎧 I made some good friends.<br/>
🎧 I've heard lots of good things about the training at JPNW.<br/>
🎧 It seems like there are a lot of opportunities there.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, definitely.<br/>
🎧 Because of its size you can work in loads of different areas within the organisation.<br/>
🎧 What about pay?<br/>
🎧 I know you get a lower minimum wage than regular employees.<br/>
🎧 That's right - which isn't great.<br/>
🎧 But you get the same number of days' holiday as everyone else.<br/>
🎧 And the pay goes up massively if they offer you a job at the end of the training period.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, but I'm not doing it for the money.<br/>
🎧 It's the experience I think will be really useful.<br/>
🎧 Everyone says by the end of the year you gain so much confidence.<br/>
🎧 You're right. That's the most useful part about it.<br/>
🎧 There's a lot of variety too.<br/>
🎧 You're given lots of different things to do.<br/>
🎧 I enjoyed it all - I didn't even mind the studying.<br/>
🎧 Do you have to spend any time in college?<br/>
🎧 Yes, one day each month.<br/>
🎧 So you get lots of support from both your tutor and your manager.<br/>
🎧 That's good.<br/>
🎧 And the company is easy to get to, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's very close to the train station so the location's a real advantage.<br/>
🎧 Have you got a date for your interview yet?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's on the 23rd of this month.<br/>
🎧 So long as you're well prepared there's nothing to worry about.<br/>
🎧 Everyone's very friendly.<br/>
🎧 I am not sure what I should wear.<br/>
🎧 What do you think?<br/>
🎧 Nothing too casual - like jeans, for example.<br/>
🎧 If you've got a nice jacket, wear that with a skirt or trousers.<br/>
🎧 OK. Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Any other tips?<br/>
🎧 Erm, well I know it's really obvious but arrive in plenty of time.<br/>
🎧 They hate people who are late.<br/>
🎧 So make sure you know exactly where you have to get to.<br/>
🎧 And one other useful piece of advice my manager told me before I had the interview for this job - is to smile.<br/>
🎧 Even if you feel terrified.<br/>
🎧 It makes people respond better to you.<br/>
🎧 I'll have to practise doing that in the mirror!<br/>
🎧 Yeah - well, good luck.<br/>
🎧 Let me know if you need any more information.<br/>
🎧 Thanks very much.<br/>
<br />

🎧 Hi everyone, welcome to the Snow Centre.<br/>
🎧 My name's Annie.<br/>
🎧 I hope you enjoyed the bus trip from the airport -<br/>
🎧 we've certainly got plenty of snow today!<br/>
🎧 Well, you've come to New Zealand's premier snow and ski centre,<br/>
🎧 and we've a whole load of activities for you during your week here.<br/>
🎧 Most visitors come here for the cross-country skiing,<br/>
🎧 where you're on fairly flat ground for most of the time,<br/>
🎧 rather than going down steep mountainsides.<br/>
🎧 There are marked trails,<br/>
🎧 but you can also leave these and go off on your own<br/>
🎧 and that's an experience not to be missed.<br/>
🎧 You can go at your own speed -<br/>
🎧 it's great aerobic exercise if you really push yourself,<br/>
🎧 or if you prefer you can just glide gently along and enjoy the beautiful scenery.<br/>
🎧 This afternoon, you'll be going on a dog-sled trip.<br/>
🎧 You may have seen our dogs on TV recently racing in the winter sled festival.<br/>
🎧 If you want, you can have your own team for the afternoon<br/>
🎧 and learn how to drive them, following behind our leader on the trail.<br/>
🎧 Or if you'd prefer, you can just sit back in the sled and enjoy the ride as a passenger.<br/>
🎧 At the weekend, we have the team relay event,<br/>
🎧 and you're all welcome to join in.<br/>
🎧 We have a local school coming along,<br/>
🎧 and a lot of the teachers are taking part too.<br/>
🎧 Participation rather than winning is the main focus,<br/>
🎧 and there's a medal for everyone who takes part.<br/>
🎧 Participants are in teams of two to four,<br/>
🎧 and each team must complete four laps of the course.<br/>
🎧 For your final expedition, you'll head off to Mount Frenner wearing a pair of special snow shoes which allow you to walk on top of the snow.<br/>
🎧 This is an area where miners once searched for gold,<br/>
🎧 though there are very few traces of their work left now.<br/>
🎧 When the snow melts in summer, the mountain slopes are carpeted in flowers and plants.<br/>
🎧 It's a long ascent, though not too steep,<br/>
🎧 and walkers generally take a couple of days to get to the summit and return.<br/>
🎧 You'll spend the night in our hut half-way up the mountain.<br/>
🎧 That's included in your package for the stay.<br/>
🎧 It's got cooking facilities, firewood and water for drinking.<br/>
🎧 For washing, we recommend you use melted snow, though, to conserve supplies.<br/>
🎧 We can take your luggage up on our snowmobile for you for just $10 a person.<br/>
🎧 The hut has cooking facilities so you can make a hot meal in the evening and morning,<br/>
🎧 but you need to take your own food.<br/>
🎧 The weather on Mount Frenner can be very stormy.<br/>
🎧 In that case, stay in the hut - generally the storms don't last long.<br/>
🎧 Don't stress about getting back here to the centre in time to catch the airport bus -<br/>
🎧 they'll probably not be running anyway.<br/>
🎧 We do have an emergency locator beacon in the hut<br/>
🎧 but only use that if it's a real emergency, like if someone's ill or injured.<br/>
🎧 Now, let me tell you something about the different ski trails you can follow during your stay here.<br/>
🎧 Highland Trail's directly accessible from where we are now.<br/>
🎧 This trail's been designed to give first-timers an experience they'll enjoy regardless of their age or skill,<br/>
🎧 but it's also ideal for experts to practise their technique.<br/>
🎧 Then there's Pine Trail…<br/>
🎧 if you're nervous about skiing, leave this one to the experts!<br/>
🎧 You follow a steep valley looking right down on the river below - scary!<br/>
🎧 But if you've fully mastered the techniques needed for hills, it's great fun.<br/>
🎧 Stony Trail's a good choice once you've got a general idea of the basics.<br/>
🎧 There are one or two tricky sections, but nothing too challenging.<br/>
🎧 There's a shelter half-way where you can sit and take a break and enjoy the afternoon sunshine.<br/>
🎧 And finally, Loser's Trail.<br/>
🎧 This starts off following a gentle river valley<br/>
🎧 but the last part is quite exposed so the snow conditions can be challenging -<br/>
🎧 if it's snowing or windy, check with us before you set out to make sure the trail's open that day.<br/>
🎧 Right, so now if you'd like to follow me, we'll get started…<br/>
<br />

🎧 I've still got loads to do for our report on nutritional food labels.<br/>
🎧 Me too.<br/>
🎧 What did you learn from doing the project about your own shopping habits?<br/>
🎧 Well, I've always had to check labels for traces of peanuts in everything I eat because of my allergy.<br/>
🎧 But beyond that I've never really been concerned enough to check how healthy a product is.<br/>
🎧 This project has actually taught me to read the labels much more carefully.<br/>
🎧 I tended to believe claims on packaging like 'low in fat'.<br/>
🎧 But I now realise that the 'healthy' yoghurt I've bought for years is full of sugar<br/>
🎧 and that it's actually quite high in calories.<br/>
🎧 Ready meals are the worst…<br/>
🎧 comparing the labels on supermarket pizzas was a real eye-opener.<br/>
🎧 Did you have any idea how many calories they contain?<br/>
🎧 I was amazed.<br/>
🎧 Yes, because unless you read the label really carefully,<br/>
🎧 you wouldn't know that the nutritional values given are for half a pizza.<br/>
🎧 When most people eat the whole pizza.<br/>
🎧 Not exactly transparent is it?<br/>
🎧 Not at all.<br/>
🎧 But I expect it won't stop you from buying pizza?<br/>
🎧 Probably not, no!<br/>
🎧 I thought comparing the different labelling systems used by food manufactures was interesting.<br/>
🎧 I think the kind of labelling system used makes a big difference.<br/>
🎧 Which one did you prefer?<br/>
🎧 I liked the traditional daily value system best -<br/>
🎧 the one which tells you what proportion of your required daily intake of each ingredient the product contains.<br/>
🎧 I'm not sure it's the easiest for people to use but at least you get the full story.<br/>
🎧 I like to know all the ingredients in a product -<br/>
🎧 not just how much fat, salt and sugar they contain.<br/>
🎧 But it's good supermarkets have been making an effort to provide reliable information for customers.<br/>
🎧 Yes. There just needs to be more consistency between labelling systems used by different supermarkets,<br/>
🎧 in terms of portion sizes, etc.<br/>
🎧 The labels on the different brands of chicken flavour crisps were quite revealing too, weren't they?<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 I don't understand how they can get away with calling them chicken flavour<br/>
🎧 when they only contain artificial additives.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 I'd at least have expected them to contain a small percentage of real chicken.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely.<br/>
🎧 I think having nutritional food labeling has been a good idea, don't you?<br/>
🎧 I think it will change people's behaviour and stop mothers, in particular, buying the wrong things.<br/>
🎧 But didn't that study kind of prove the opposite?<br/>
🎧 People didn't necessarily stop buying unhealthy products.<br/>
🎧 They only said that might be the case.<br/>
🎧 Those findings weren't that conclusive and it was quite a small-scale study.<br/>
🎧 I think more research has to be done.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I think you're probably right.<br/>
🎧 What do you think of the traffic-light system?<br/>
🎧 I think supermarkets like the idea of having a colour-coded system -<br/>
🎧 red, orange or green - for levels of fat, sugar and salt in a product.<br/>
🎧 But it's not been adopted universally.<br/>
🎧 And not on all products.<br/>
🎧 Why do you suppose that is?<br/>
🎧 Pressure from the food manufacturers.<br/>
🎧 Hardly surprising that some of them are opposed to flagging up how unhealthy their products are.<br/>
🎧 I'd have thought it would have been compulsory.<br/>
🎧 It seems ridiculous it isn't.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 And what I couldn't get over is the fact that it was brought in without enough consultation -<br/>
🎧 a lot of experts had deep reservations about it.<br/>
🎧 That is a bit weird.<br/>
🎧 I suppose there's an argument for doing the research now when consumers are familiar with this system.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, maybe.<br/>
🎧 The participants in the survey were quite positive about the traffic-light system.<br/>
🎧 But I don't think they targeted the right people.<br/>
🎧 They should have focused on people with low literacy levels<br/>
🎧 because these labels are designed to be accessible to them.<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 But it's good to get feedback from all socio-economic groups.<br/>
🎧 And there wasn't much variation in their responses.<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 But if they hadn't interviewed participants face-to-face,<br/>
🎧 they could have used a much bigger sample size.<br/>
🎧 I wonder why they chose that method?<br/>
🎧 Dunno.<br/>
🎧 How were they selected?<br/>
🎧 Did they volunteer or were they approached?<br/>
🎧 I think they volunteered.<br/>
🎧 The thing that wasn't stated was how often they bought packaged food -<br/>
🎧 all we know is how frequently they used the supermarket.<br/>
<br />

🎧 In my presentation, I'm going to talk about coffee,<br/>
🎧 and its importance both in economic and social terms.<br/>
🎧 We think it was first drunk in the Arab world,<br/>
🎧 but there's hardly any documentary evidence of it before the 1500s,<br/>
🎧 although of course that doesn't mean that people didn't know about it before then.<br/>
🎧 However, there is evidence that coffee was originally gathered from bushes<br/>
🎧 growing wild in Ethiopia, in the northeast of Africa.<br/>
🎧 In the early 16th century,<br/>
🎧 it was being bought by traders,<br/>
🎧 and gradually its use as a drink spread throughout the Middle East.<br/>
🎧 It's also known that in 1522,<br/>
🎧 in the Turkish city of Constantinople, which was the centre of the Ottoman Empire,<br/>
🎧 the court physician approved its use as a medicine.<br/>
🎧 By the mid-1500s, coffee bushes were being cultivated in the Yemen<br/>
🎧 and for the next hundred years this region produced most of the coffee drunk in Africa and the Arab world.<br/>
🎧 What's particularly interesting about coffee is its effect on social life.<br/>
🎧 It was rarely drunk at home,<br/>
🎧 but instead people went to coffee houses to drink it.<br/>
🎧 These people, usually men, would meet to drink coffee and chat about issues of the day.<br/>
🎧 But at the time, this chance to share ideas and opinions was seen as something that was potentially dangerous,<br/>
🎧 and in 1623 the ruler of Constantinople demanded the destruction of all the coffee houses in the city,<br/>
🎧 although after his death many new ones opened, and coffee consumption continued.<br/>
🎧 In the seventeenth century, coffee drinking spread to Europe,<br/>
🎧 and here too coffee shops became places where ordinary people, nearly always men, could meet to exchange ideas.<br/>
🎧 Because of this, some people said that these places performed a similar function to universities.<br/>
🎧 The opportunity they provided for people to meet together outside their own homes<br/>
🎧 and to discuss the topics of the day had an enormous impact on social life,<br/>
🎧 and many social movements and political developments had their origins in coffee house discussions.<br/>
🎧 In the late 1600s, the Yemeni monopoly on coffee production broke down<br/>
🎧 and coffee production started to spread around the world, helped by European colonization.<br/>
🎧 Europeans set up coffee plantations in Indonesia and the Caribbean<br/>
🎧 and production of coffee in the colonies skyrocketed.<br/>
🎧 Different types of coffee were produced in different areas,<br/>
🎧 and it's interesting that the names given to these different types,<br/>
🎧 like Mocha or Java coffee,<br/>
🎧 were often taken from the port they were shipped to Europe from.<br/>
🎧 But if you look at the labour system in the different colonies,<br/>
🎧 there were some significant differences.<br/>
🎧 In Brazil and the various Caribbean colonies,<br/>
🎧 coffee was grown in huge plantations<br/>
🎧 and the workers there were almost all slaves.<br/>
🎧 But this wasn't the same in all colonies;<br/>
🎧 for example in Java, which had been colonized by the Dutch,<br/>
🎧 the peasants grew coffee and passed a proportion of this on to the Dutch,<br/>
🎧 so it was used as a means of taxation.<br/>
🎧 But whatever system was used, under the European powers of the 18th century,<br/>
🎧 coffee production was very closely linked to colonisation.<br/>
🎧 Coffee was grown in ever-increasing quantities to satisfy the growing demand from Europe,<br/>
🎧 and it became nearly as important as sugar production,<br/>
🎧 which was grown under very similar conditions.<br/>
🎧 However, coffee prices were not yet low enough for people to drink it regularly at home,<br/>
🎧 so most coffee consumption still took place in public coffee houses<br/>
🎧 and it still remained something of a luxury item.<br/>
🎧 In Britain, however, a new drink was introduced from China,<br/>
🎧 and started to become popular, gradually taking over from coffee,<br/>
🎧 although at first it was so expensive that only the upper classes could afford it.<br/>
🎧 This was tea,<br/>
🎧 and by the late 1700s it was being widely drunk.<br/>
🎧 However, when the USA gained independence from Britain in 1776,<br/>
🎧 they identified this drink with Britain,<br/>
🎧 and coffee remained the preferred drink in the USA, as it still is today.<br/>
🎧 So, by the early 19th century, coffee was already being widely produced and consumed.<br/>
🎧 But during this century, production boomed and coffee prices started to fall.<br/>
🎧 This was partly because new types of transportation had been developed which were cheaper and more efficient.<br/>
🎧 So now, working people could afford to buy coffee -<br/>
🎧 it wasn't just a drink for the middle classes.<br/>
🎧 And this was at a time when large parts of Europe were starting to work in industries.<br/>
🎧 And sometimes this meant their work didn't stop when it got dark;<br/>
🎧 they might have to continue throughout the night.<br/>
🎧 So, the use of coffee as a stimulant became important -<br/>
🎧 it wasn't just a drink people drank in the morning, for breakfast.<br/>
🎧 There were also changes in cultivation…<br/>
<br/><br/>
