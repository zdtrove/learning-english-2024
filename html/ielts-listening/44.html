🎧 Hi <span>Alex. It's <span>Martha <span>Clines here.<br/>
🎧 <span>James <span>White gave me your number.<br/>
🎧 I hope you don't <span>mind me <span>calling you.<br/>
🎧 Of course not. How are you, <span>Martha?<br/>
🎧 Good thanks.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>ringing because I need a bit of advice.<br/>
🎧 Oh yeah. What about?<br/>
🎧 The <span>training you did at <span>JPNW a few years ago.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>applying for the same thing.<br/>
🎧 Oh right. Yes, I did <span>mine in <span>2014.<br/>
🎧 Best thing I ever did. I'm still working there.<br/>
🎧 Really? What are you doing?<br/>
🎧 Well, now I work in the <span>customer <span>services <span>department<br/>
🎧 but I did my <span>initial <span>training in <span>Finance.<br/>
🎧 I <span>stayed there for the first two years and then <span>moved to where I am now.<br/>
🎧 That's the same <span>department I'm <span>applying for.<br/>
🎧 Did you enjoy it?<br/>
🎧 I was <span>pretty <span>nervous to <span>begin with.<br/>
🎧 I didn't do well in my <span>exams at <span>school<br/>
🎧 and I was really <span>worried because I <span>failed <span>Maths.<br/>
🎧 But it didn't actually <span>matter because I did lots of <span>courses on the <span>job.<br/>
🎧 Did you get a <span>diploma at the end of your <span>trainee <span>period?<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>hoping to do the one in <span>business <span>skills.<br/>
🎧 Yes. That sounds good.<br/>
🎧 I took the one on IT <span>skills but I wish I'd done that one <span>instead.<br/>
🎧 OK, that's good to know.<br/>
🎧 What about the other <span>trainees?<br/>
🎧 How did you get on with them?<br/>
🎧 There were about <span>20 of us who <span>started at the same <span>time<br/>
🎧 and we were all around the same age.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>18 and there was only one person <span>younger than me, who was <span>17.<br/>
🎧 The <span>rest were between <span>18 and <span>20.<br/>
🎧 I made some good friends.<br/>
🎧 I've heard lots of good things about the <span>training at <span>JPNW.<br/>
🎧 It <span>seems like there are a lot of <span>opportunities there.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, definitely.<br/>
🎧 Because of its size you can work in <span>loads of different <span>areas <span>within the <span>organisation.<br/>
🎧 What about pay?<br/>
🎧 I know you get a <span>lower <span>minimum <span>wage than <span>regular <span>employees.<br/>
🎧 That's right <span>- which isn't great.<br/>
🎧 But you get the same number of <span>days' <span>holiday as everyone else.<br/>
🎧 And the pay <span>goes up <span>massively if they <span>offer you a <span>job at the end of the <span>training <span>period.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, but I'm not doing it for the money.<br/>
🎧 It's the <span>experience I think will be really <span>useful.<br/>
🎧 Everyone says by the end of the year you <span>gain so much <span>confidence.<br/>
🎧 You're right. That's the most <span>useful <span>part about it.<br/>
🎧 There's a lot of <span>variety too.<br/>
🎧 You're <span>given lots of different things to do.<br/>
🎧 I <span>enjoyed it all <span>- I didn't even <span>mind the <span>studying.<br/>
🎧 Do you have to <span>spend any time in <span>college?<br/>
🎧 Yes, one day each month.<br/>
🎧 So you get lots of <span>support from both your <span>tutor and your <span>manager.<br/>
🎧 That's good.<br/>
🎧 And the company is easy to get to, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's very <span>close to the <span>train <span>station so the <span>location's a <span>real <span>advantage.<br/>
🎧 Have you got a date for your <span>interview yet?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's on the <span>23rd of this month.<br/>
🎧 So long as you're well <span>prepared there's <span>nothing to <span>worry about.<br/>
🎧 <span>Everyone's very <span>friendly.<br/>
🎧 I am not sure what I should <span>wear.<br/>
🎧 What do you think?<br/>
🎧 <span>Nothing too <span>casual <span>- like <span>jeans, for example.<br/>
🎧 If you've got a nice <span>jacket, <span>wear that with a <span>skirt or <span>trousers.<br/>
🎧 OK. Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Any other <span>tips?<br/>
🎧 <span>Erm, well I know it's really <span>obvious but <span>arrive in <span>plenty of time.<br/>
🎧 They <span>hate people who are <span>late.<br/>
🎧 So make sure you know exactly where you have to get to.<br/>
🎧 And one other <span>useful <span>piece of advice my <span>manager told me before I had the <span>interview for this <span>job <span>- is to <span>smile.<br/>
🎧 Even if you feel <span>terrified.<br/>
🎧 It makes people <span>respond better to you.<br/>
🎧 I'll have to <span>practise doing that in the <span>mirror!<br/>
🎧 Yeah <span>- well, good <span>luck.<br/>
🎧 Let me know if you need any more <span>information.<br/>
🎧 Thanks very much.<br/>
<br />

🎧 Hi everyone, <span>welcome to the <span>Snow <span>Centre.<br/>
🎧 My <span>name's <span>Annie.<br/>
🎧 I hope you <span>enjoyed the bus <span>trip from the <span>airport <span>-<br/>
🎧 we've <span>certainly got <span>plenty of <span>snow today!<br/>
🎧 Well, you've come to New <span>Zealand's <span>premier <span>snow and <span>ski <span>centre,<br/>
🎧 and we've a whole <span>load of <span>activities for you during your week here.<br/>
🎧 Most <span>visitors come here for the <span>cross-country <span>skiing,<br/>
🎧 where you're on <span>fairly <span>flat <span>ground for most of the time,<br/>
🎧 rather than going down <span>steep <span>mountainsides.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>marked <span>trails,<br/>
🎧 but you can also leave these and go off on your <span>own<br/>
🎧 and that's an <span>experience not to be <span>missed.<br/>
🎧 You can go at your own <span>speed <span>-<br/>
🎧 it's great <span>aerobic <span>exercise if you really <span>push yourself,<br/>
🎧 or if you <span>prefer you can just <span>glide <span>gently along and enjoy the <span>beautiful <span>scenery.<br/>
🎧 This <span>afternoon, you'll be going on a <span>dog-sled <span>trip.<br/>
🎧 You may have <span>seen our <span>dogs on <span>TV <span>recently <span>racing in the <span>winter <span>sled <span>festival.<br/>
🎧 If you want, you can have your own <span>team for the <span>afternoon<br/>
🎧 and learn how to drive them, <span>following behind our <span>leader on the <span>trail.<br/>
🎧 Or if you'd <span>prefer, you can just sit back in the <span>sled and enjoy the <span>ride as a <span>passenger.<br/>
🎧 At the weekend, we have the <span>team <span>relay <span>event,<br/>
🎧 and you're all <span>welcome to join in.<br/>
🎧 We have a <span>local school <span>coming along,<br/>
🎧 and a lot of the <span>teachers are taking <span>part too.<br/>
🎧 <span>Participation rather than <span>winning is the <span>main focus,<br/>
🎧 and there's a <span>medal for everyone who takes <span>part.<br/>
🎧 <span>Participants are in <span>teams of two to <span>four,<br/>
🎧 and each <span>team must <span>complete <span>four <span>laps of the course.<br/>
🎧 For your <span>final <span>expedition, you'll <span>head off to <span>Mount <span>Frenner <span>wearing a <span>pair of special <span>snow <span>shoes which <span>allow you to <span>walk on top of the <span>snow.<br/>
🎧 This is an <span>area where <span>miners once <span>searched for <span>gold,<br/>
🎧 though there are very few <span>traces of their work <span>left now.<br/>
🎧 When the <span>snow <span>melts in <span>summer, the <span>mountain <span>slopes are <span>carpeted in <span>flowers and <span>plants.<br/>
🎧 It's a long <span>ascent, though not too <span>steep,<br/>
🎧 and <span>walkers <span>generally take a <span>couple of <span>days to get to the <span>summit and <span>return.<br/>
🎧 You'll <span>spend the <span>night in our <span>hut <span>half-way up the <span>mountain.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>included in your <span>package for the <span>stay.<br/>
🎧 It's got cooking <span>facilities, <span>firewood and water for <span>drinking.<br/>
🎧 For <span>washing, we <span>recommend you use <span>melted <span>snow, though, to <span>conserve <span>supplies.<br/>
🎧 We can take your <span>luggage up on our <span>snowmobile for you for just <span>$10 a person.<br/>
🎧 The <span>hut has cooking <span>facilities so you can make a hot <span>meal in the <span>evening and morning,<br/>
🎧 but you need to take your own food.<br/>
🎧 The <span>weather on <span>Mount <span>Frenner can be very <span>stormy.<br/>
🎧 In that case, <span>stay in the <span>hut <span>- <span>generally the <span>storms don't last long.<br/>
🎧 Don't <span>stress about getting back here to the <span>centre in time to catch the <span>airport bus <span>-<br/>
🎧 they'll probably not be <span>running <span>anyway.<br/>
🎧 We do have an <span>emergency <span>locator <span>beacon in the <span>hut<br/>
🎧 but only use that if it's a <span>real <span>emergency, like if <span>someone's <span>ill or <span>injured.<br/>
🎧 Now, let me tell you something about the different <span>ski <span>trails you can <span>follow during your <span>stay here.<br/>
🎧 <span>Highland <span>Trail's <span>directly <span>accessible from where we are now.<br/>
🎧 This <span>trail's been <span>designed to give <span>first-timers an <span>experience they'll enjoy <span>regardless of their age or <span>skill,<br/>
🎧 but it's also <span>ideal for <span>experts to <span>practise their <span>technique.<br/>
🎧 Then there's <span>Pine <span>Trail…<br/>
🎧 if you're <span>nervous about <span>skiing, leave this one to the <span>experts!<br/>
🎧 You <span>follow a <span>steep <span>valley looking right down on the <span>river <span>below <span>- <span>scary!<br/>
🎧 But if you've <span>fully <span>mastered the <span>techniques <span>needed for <span>hills, it's great fun.<br/>
🎧 <span>Stony <span>Trail's a good <span>choice once you've got a <span>general idea of the <span>basics.<br/>
🎧 There are one or two <span>tricky <span>sections, but <span>nothing too <span>challenging.<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>shelter <span>half-way where you can sit and take a <span>break and enjoy the <span>afternoon <span>sunshine.<br/>
🎧 And finally, <span>Loser's <span>Trail.<br/>
🎧 This <span>starts off <span>following a <span>gentle <span>river <span>valley<br/>
🎧 but the last <span>part is quite <span>exposed so the <span>snow <span>conditions can be <span>challenging <span>-<br/>
🎧 if it's <span>snowing or <span>windy, check with us before you set out to make sure the <span>trail's open that day.<br/>
🎧 Right, so now if you'd like to <span>follow me, we'll get <span>started…<br/>
<br />

🎧 I've still got <span>loads to do for our <span>report on <span>nutritional food <span>labels.<br/>
🎧 Me too.<br/>
🎧 What did you learn from doing the <span>project about your own <span>shopping <span>habits?<br/>
🎧 Well, I've always had to check <span>labels for <span>traces of <span>peanuts in everything I eat because of my <span>allergy.<br/>
🎧 But <span>beyond that I've never really been <span>concerned enough to check how <span>healthy a product is.<br/>
🎧 This <span>project has actually <span>taught me to read the <span>labels much more <span>carefully.<br/>
🎧 I <span>tended to <span>believe <span>claims on <span>packaging like <span>'low in <span>fat'.<br/>
🎧 But I now <span>realise that the <span>'healthy' <span>yoghurt I've <span>bought for years is full of <span>sugar<br/>
🎧 and that it's actually quite high in <span>calories.<br/>
🎧 Ready <span>meals are the <span>worst…<br/>
🎧 <span>comparing the <span>labels on <span>supermarket <span>pizzas was a <span>real <span>eye-opener.<br/>
🎧 Did you have any idea how many <span>calories they <span>contain?<br/>
🎧 I was <span>amazed.<br/>
🎧 Yes, because <span>unless you read the <span>label really <span>carefully,<br/>
🎧 you wouldn't know that the <span>nutritional <span>values <span>given are for <span>half a <span>pizza.<br/>
🎧 When most people eat the whole <span>pizza.<br/>
🎧 Not exactly <span>transparent is it?<br/>
🎧 Not at all.<br/>
🎧 But I <span>expect it won't <span>stop you from <span>buying <span>pizza?<br/>
🎧 Probably not, no!<br/>
🎧 I thought <span>comparing the different <span>labelling <span>systems used by food <span>manufactures was <span>interesting.<br/>
🎧 I think the kind of <span>labelling <span>system used makes a big <span>difference.<br/>
🎧 Which one did you <span>prefer?<br/>
🎧 I <span>liked the <span>traditional <span>daily <span>value <span>system best <span>-<br/>
🎧 the one which tells you what <span>proportion of your <span>required <span>daily <span>intake of each <span>ingredient the product <span>contains.<br/>
🎧 I'm not sure it's the <span>easiest for people to use but at <span>least you get the full <span>story.<br/>
🎧 I like to know all the <span>ingredients in a product <span>-<br/>
🎧 not just how much fat, <span>salt and <span>sugar they <span>contain.<br/>
🎧 But it's good <span>supermarkets have been <span>making an <span>effort to <span>provide <span>reliable <span>information for <span>customers.<br/>
🎧 Yes. There just needs to be more <span>consistency between <span>labelling <span>systems used by different <span>supermarkets,<br/>
🎧 in <span>terms of <span>portion <span>sizes, <span>etc.<br/>
🎧 The <span>labels on the different <span>brands of <span>chicken <span>flavour <span>crisps were quite <span>revealing too, weren't they?<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 I don't <span>understand how they can get away with <span>calling them <span>chicken <span>flavour<br/>
🎧 when they only <span>contain <span>artificial <span>additives.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 I'd at <span>least have <span>expected them to <span>contain a small <span>percentage of <span>real <span>chicken.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely.<br/>
🎧 I think having <span>nutritional food <span>labeling has been a good idea, don't you?<br/>
🎧 I think it will change <span>people's <span>behaviour and <span>stop <span>mothers, in <span>particular, <span>buying the wrong things.<br/>
🎧 But didn't that <span>study kind of <span>prove the <span>opposite?<br/>
🎧 People didn't <span>necessarily <span>stop <span>buying <span>unhealthy <span>products.<br/>
🎧 They only said that might be the case.<br/>
🎧 Those <span>findings weren't that <span>conclusive and it was quite a <span>small-scale <span>study.<br/>
🎧 I think more <span>research has to be done.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I think you're probably right.<br/>
🎧 What do you think of the <span>traffic-light <span>system?<br/>
🎧 I think <span>supermarkets like the idea of having a <span>colour-coded <span>system <span>-<br/>
🎧 red, <span>orange or <span>green <span>- for <span>levels of fat, <span>sugar and <span>salt in a product.<br/>
🎧 But it's not been <span>adopted <span>universally.<br/>
🎧 And not on all <span>products.<br/>
🎧 Why do you <span>suppose that is?<br/>
🎧 <span>Pressure from the food <span>manufacturers.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hardly <span>surprising that some of them are <span>opposed to <span>flagging up how <span>unhealthy their <span>products are.<br/>
🎧 I'd have thought it would have been <span>compulsory.<br/>
🎧 It <span>seems <span>ridiculous it isn't.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 And what I couldn't get over is the <span>fact that it was <span>brought in without enough <span>consultation <span>-<br/>
🎧 a lot of <span>experts had <span>deep <span>reservations about it.<br/>
🎧 That is a bit <span>weird.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose there's an <span>argument for doing the <span>research now when <span>consumers are <span>familiar with this <span>system.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, maybe.<br/>
🎧 The <span>participants in the <span>survey were quite <span>positive about the <span>traffic-light <span>system.<br/>
🎧 But I don't think they <span>targeted the right people.<br/>
🎧 They should have <span>focused on people with low <span>literacy <span>levels<br/>
🎧 because these <span>labels are <span>designed to be <span>accessible to them.<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 But it's good to get <span>feedback from all <span>socio-economic <span>groups.<br/>
🎧 And there wasn't much <span>variation in their <span>responses.<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 But if they hadn't <span>interviewed <span>participants <span>face-to-face,<br/>
🎧 they could have used a much <span>bigger <span>sample size.<br/>
🎧 I <span>wonder why they <span>chose that <span>method?<br/>
🎧 <span>Dunno.<br/>
🎧 How were they <span>selected?<br/>
🎧 Did they <span>volunteer or were they <span>approached?<br/>
🎧 I think they <span>volunteered.<br/>
🎧 The thing that wasn't <span>stated was how often they <span>bought <span>packaged food <span>-<br/>
🎧 all we know is how <span>frequently they used the <span>supermarket.<br/>
<br />

🎧 In my <span>presentation, I'm going to talk about <span>coffee,<br/>
🎧 and its <span>importance both in <span>economic and <span>social <span>terms.<br/>
🎧 We think it was first <span>drunk in the <span>Arab <span>world,<br/>
🎧 but there's <span>hardly any <span>documentary <span>evidence of it before the <span>1500s,<br/>
🎧 although of course that doesn't mean that people didn't know about it before then.<br/>
🎧 <span>However, there is <span>evidence that <span>coffee was <span>originally <span>gathered from <span>bushes<br/>
🎧 <span>growing <span>wild in <span>Ethiopia, in the <span>northeast of <span>Africa.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>early <span>16th <span>century,<br/>
🎧 it was being <span>bought by <span>traders,<br/>
🎧 and <span>gradually its use as a drink <span>spread <span>throughout the <span>Middle <span>East.<br/>
🎧 It's also <span>known that in <span>1522,<br/>
🎧 in the <span>Turkish <span>city of <span>Constantinople, which was the <span>centre of the <span>Ottoman <span>Empire,<br/>
🎧 the <span>court <span>physician <span>approved its use as a <span>medicine.<br/>
🎧 By the <span>mid-1500s, <span>coffee <span>bushes were being <span>cultivated in the <span>Yemen<br/>
🎧 and for the next <span>hundred years this <span>region <span>produced most of the <span>coffee <span>drunk in <span>Africa and the <span>Arab <span>world.<br/>
🎧 What's <span>particularly <span>interesting about <span>coffee is its <span>effect on <span>social life.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>rarely <span>drunk at home,<br/>
🎧 but <span>instead people went to <span>coffee <span>houses to drink it.<br/>
🎧 These people, usually men, would meet to drink <span>coffee and <span>chat about issues of the day.<br/>
🎧 But at the time, this <span>chance to share <span>ideas and <span>opinions was <span>seen as something that was <span>potentially <span>dangerous,<br/>
🎧 and in <span>1623 the <span>ruler of <span>Constantinople <span>demanded the <span>destruction of all the <span>coffee <span>houses in the <span>city,<br/>
🎧 although after his <span>death many new <span>ones <span>opened, and <span>coffee <span>consumption <span>continued.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>seventeenth <span>century, <span>coffee <span>drinking <span>spread to <span>Europe,<br/>
🎧 and here too <span>coffee <span>shops <span>became <span>places where <span>ordinary people, <span>nearly always men, could meet to <span>exchange <span>ideas.<br/>
🎧 Because of this, some people said that these <span>places <span>performed a <span>similar <span>function to <span>universities.<br/>
🎧 The <span>opportunity they <span>provided for people to meet together outside their own <span>homes<br/>
🎧 and to <span>discuss the <span>topics of the day had an <span>enormous <span>impact on <span>social life,<br/>
🎧 and many <span>social <span>movements and <span>political <span>developments had their <span>origins in <span>coffee house <span>discussions.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>late <span>1600s, the <span>Yemeni <span>monopoly on <span>coffee <span>production <span>broke <span>down<br/>
🎧 and <span>coffee <span>production <span>started to <span>spread around the <span>world, <span>helped by <span>European <span>colonization.<br/>
🎧 <span>Europeans set up <span>coffee <span>plantations in <span>Indonesia and the <span>Caribbean<br/>
🎧 and <span>production of <span>coffee in the <span>colonies <span>skyrocketed.<br/>
🎧 Different <span>types of <span>coffee were <span>produced in different <span>areas,<br/>
🎧 and it's <span>interesting that the <span>names <span>given to these different <span>types,<br/>
🎧 like <span>Mocha or <span>Java <span>coffee,<br/>
🎧 were often taken from the <span>port they were <span>shipped to <span>Europe from.<br/>
🎧 But if you look at the <span>labour <span>system in the different <span>colonies,<br/>
🎧 there were some <span>significant <span>differences.<br/>
🎧 In <span>Brazil and the <span>various <span>Caribbean <span>colonies,<br/>
🎧 <span>coffee was <span>grown in <span>huge <span>plantations<br/>
🎧 and the <span>workers there were almost all <span>slaves.<br/>
🎧 But this wasn't the same in all <span>colonies;<br/>
🎧 for example in <span>Java, which had been <span>colonized by the <span>Dutch,<br/>
🎧 the <span>peasants <span>grew <span>coffee and <span>passed a <span>proportion of this on to the <span>Dutch,<br/>
🎧 so it was used as a <span>means of <span>taxation.<br/>
🎧 But whatever <span>system was used, under the <span>European <span>powers of the <span>18th <span>century,<br/>
🎧 <span>coffee <span>production was very <span>closely <span>linked to <span>colonisation.<br/>
🎧 <span>Coffee was <span>grown in <span>ever-increasing <span>quantities to <span>satisfy the <span>growing <span>demand from <span>Europe,<br/>
🎧 and it <span>became <span>nearly as important as <span>sugar <span>production,<br/>
🎧 which was <span>grown under very <span>similar <span>conditions.<br/>
🎧 <span>However, <span>coffee <span>prices were not yet low enough for people to drink it <span>regularly at home,<br/>
🎧 so most <span>coffee <span>consumption still took place in <span>public <span>coffee <span>houses<br/>
🎧 and it still <span>remained something of a <span>luxury <span>item.<br/>
🎧 In <span>Britain, <span>however, a new drink was <span>introduced from <span>China,<br/>
🎧 and <span>started to become <span>popular, <span>gradually taking over from <span>coffee,<br/>
🎧 although at first it was so <span>expensive that only the <span>upper <span>classes could <span>afford it.<br/>
🎧 This was tea,<br/>
🎧 and by the <span>late <span>1700s it was being <span>widely <span>drunk.<br/>
🎧 <span>However, when the <span>USA <span>gained <span>independence from <span>Britain in <span>1776,<br/>
🎧 they <span>identified this drink with <span>Britain,<br/>
🎧 and <span>coffee <span>remained the <span>preferred drink in the <span>USA, as it still is today.<br/>
🎧 So, by the <span>early <span>19th <span>century, <span>coffee was already being <span>widely <span>produced and <span>consumed.<br/>
🎧 But during this <span>century, <span>production <span>boomed and <span>coffee <span>prices <span>started to <span>fall.<br/>
🎧 This was <span>partly because new <span>types of <span>transportation had been <span>developed which were <span>cheaper and more <span>efficient.<br/>
🎧 So now, working people could <span>afford to buy <span>coffee <span>-<br/>
🎧 it wasn't just a drink for the <span>middle <span>classes.<br/>
🎧 And this was at a time when large <span>parts of <span>Europe were <span>starting to work in <span>industries.<br/>
🎧 And sometimes this <span>meant their work didn't <span>stop when it got <span>dark;<br/>
🎧 they might have to <span>continue <span>throughout the <span>night.<br/>
🎧 So, the use of <span>coffee as a <span>stimulant <span>became important <span>-<br/>
🎧 it wasn't just a drink people <span>drank in the morning, for <span>breakfast.<br/>
🎧 There were also changes in <span>cultivation…<br/>
