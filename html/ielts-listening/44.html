🎧 Hi <span>Alex</span>. It's <span>Martha</span> <span>Clines</span> here.<br/>
🎧 <span>James</span> <span>White</span> gave me your number.<br/>
🎧 I hope you don't <span>mind</span> me <span>calling</span> you.<br/>
🎧 Of course not. How are you, <span>Martha</span>?<br/>
🎧 Good thanks.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>ringing</span> because I need a bit of advice.<br/>
🎧 Oh yeah. What about?<br/>
🎧 The <span>training</span> you did at <span>JPNW</span> a few years ago.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>applying</span> for the same thing.<br/>
🎧 Oh right. Yes, I did <span>mine</span> in <span>2014</span>.<br/>
🎧 Best thing I ever did. I'm still working there.<br/>
🎧 Really? What are you doing?<br/>
🎧 Well, now I work in the <span>customer</span> <span>services</span> <span>department<br/></span>
🎧 but I did my <span>initial</span> <span>training</span> in <span>Finance</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>stayed</span> there for the first two years and then <span>moved</span> to where I am now.<br/>
🎧 That's the same <span>department</span> I'm <span>applying</span> for.<br/>
🎧 Did you enjoy it?<br/>
🎧 I was <span>pretty</span> <span>nervous</span> to <span>begin</span> with.<br/>
🎧 I didn't do well in my <span>exams</span> at <span>school<br/></span>
🎧 and I was really <span>worried</span> because I <span>failed</span> <span>Maths</span>.<br/>
🎧 But it didn't actually <span>matter</span> because I did lots of <span>courses</span> on the <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 Did you get a <span>diploma</span> at the end of your <span>trainee</span> <span>period</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>hoping</span> to do the one in <span>business</span> <span>skills</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes. That sounds good.<br/>
🎧 I took the one on IT <span>skills</span> but I wish I'd done that one <span>instead</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, that's good to know.<br/>
🎧 What about the other <span>trainees</span>?<br/>
🎧 How did you get on with them?<br/>
🎧 There were about <span>20</span> of us who <span>started</span> at the same <span>time<br/></span>
🎧 and we were all around the same age.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>18</span> and there was only one person <span>younger</span> than me, who was <span>17</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>rest</span> were between <span>18</span> and <span>20</span>.<br/>
🎧 I made some good friends.<br/>
🎧 I've heard lots of good things about the <span>training</span> at <span>JPNW</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>seems</span> like there are a lot of <span>opportunities</span> there.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, definitely.<br/>
🎧 Because of its size you can work in <span>loads</span> of different <span>areas</span> <span>within</span> the <span>organisation</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about pay?<br/>
🎧 I know you get a <span>lower</span> <span>minimum</span> <span>wage</span> than <span>regular</span> <span>employees</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's right <span>-</span> which isn't great.<br/>
🎧 But you get the same number of <span>days'</span> <span>holiday</span> as everyone else.<br/>
🎧 And the pay <span>goes</span> up <span>massively</span> if they <span>offer</span> you a <span>job</span> at the end of the <span>training</span> <span>period</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, but I'm not doing it for the money.<br/>
🎧 It's the <span>experience</span> I think will be really <span>useful</span>.<br/>
🎧 Everyone says by the end of the year you <span>gain</span> so much <span>confidence</span>.<br/>
🎧 You're right. That's the most <span>useful</span> <span>part</span> about it.<br/>
🎧 There's a lot of <span>variety</span> too.<br/>
🎧 You're <span>given</span> lots of different things to do.<br/>
🎧 I <span>enjoyed</span> it all <span>-</span> I didn't even <span>mind</span> the <span>studying</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you have to <span>spend</span> any time in <span>college</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, one day each month.<br/>
🎧 So you get lots of <span>support</span> from both your <span>tutor</span> and your <span>manager</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's good.<br/>
🎧 And the company is easy to get to, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's very <span>close</span> to the <span>train</span> <span>station</span> so the <span>location's</span> a <span>real</span> <span>advantage</span>.<br/>
🎧 Have you got a date for your <span>interview</span> yet?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's on the <span>23rd</span> of this month.<br/>
🎧 So long as you're well <span>prepared</span> there's <span>nothing</span> to <span>worry</span> about.<br/>
🎧 <span>Everyone's</span> very <span>friendly</span>.<br/>
🎧 I am not sure what I should <span>wear</span>.<br/>
🎧 What do you think?<br/>
🎧 <span>Nothing</span> too <span>casual</span> <span>-</span> like <span>jeans</span>, for example.<br/>
🎧 If you've got a nice <span>jacket</span>, <span>wear</span> that with a <span>skirt</span> or <span>trousers</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK. Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Any other <span>tips</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Erm</span>, well I know it's really <span>obvious</span> but <span>arrive</span> in <span>plenty</span> of time.<br/>
🎧 They <span>hate</span> people who are <span>late</span>.<br/>
🎧 So make sure you know exactly where you have to get to.<br/>
🎧 And one other <span>useful</span> <span>piece</span> of advice my <span>manager</span> told me before I had the <span>interview</span> for this <span>job</span> <span>-</span> is to <span>smile</span>.<br/>
🎧 Even if you feel <span>terrified</span>.<br/>
🎧 It makes people <span>respond</span> better to you.<br/>
🎧 I'll have to <span>practise</span> doing that in the <span>mirror</span>!<br/>
🎧 Yeah <span>-</span> well, good <span>luck</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let me know if you need any more <span>information</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks very much.<br/>

🎧 Hi everyone, <span>welcome</span> to the <span>Snow</span> <span>Centre</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>name's</span> <span>Annie</span>.<br/>
🎧 I hope you <span>enjoyed</span> the bus <span>trip</span> from the <span>airport</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 we've <span>certainly</span> got <span>plenty</span> of <span>snow</span> today!<br/>
🎧 Well, you've come to New <span>Zealand's</span> <span>premier</span> <span>snow</span> and <span>ski</span> <span>centre</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we've a whole <span>load</span> of <span>activities</span> for you during your week here.<br/>
🎧 Most <span>visitors</span> come here for the <span>cross-country</span> <span>skiing</span>,<br/>
🎧 where you're on <span>fairly</span> <span>flat</span> <span>ground</span> for most of the time,<br/>
🎧 rather than going down <span>steep</span> <span>mountainsides</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>marked</span> <span>trails</span>,<br/>
🎧 but you can also leave these and go off on your <span>own<br/></span>
🎧 and that's an <span>experience</span> not to be <span>missed</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can go at your own <span>speed</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it's great <span>aerobic</span> <span>exercise</span> if you really <span>push</span> yourself,<br/>
🎧 or if you <span>prefer</span> you can just <span>glide</span> <span>gently</span> along and enjoy the <span>beautiful</span> <span>scenery</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>afternoon</span>, you'll be going on a <span>dog-sled</span> <span>trip</span>.<br/>
🎧 You may have <span>seen</span> our <span>dogs</span> on <span>TV</span> <span>recently</span> <span>racing</span> in the <span>winter</span> <span>sled</span> <span>festival</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you want, you can have your own <span>team</span> for the <span>afternoon<br/></span>
🎧 and learn how to drive them, <span>following</span> behind our <span>leader</span> on the <span>trail</span>.<br/>
🎧 Or if you'd <span>prefer</span>, you can just sit back in the <span>sled</span> and enjoy the <span>ride</span> as a <span>passenger</span>.<br/>
🎧 At the weekend, we have the <span>team</span> <span>relay</span> <span>event</span>,<br/>
🎧 and you're all <span>welcome</span> to join in.<br/>
🎧 We have a <span>local</span> school <span>coming</span> along,<br/>
🎧 and a lot of the <span>teachers</span> are taking <span>part</span> too.<br/>
🎧 <span>Participation</span> rather than <span>winning</span> is the <span>main</span> focus,<br/>
🎧 and there's a <span>medal</span> for everyone who takes <span>part</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Participants</span> are in <span>teams</span> of two to <span>four</span>,<br/>
🎧 and each <span>team</span> must <span>complete</span> <span>four</span> <span>laps</span> of the course.<br/>
🎧 For your <span>final</span> <span>expedition</span>, you'll <span>head</span> off to <span>Mount</span> <span>Frenner</span> <span>wearing</span> a <span>pair</span> of special <span>snow</span> <span>shoes</span> which <span>allow</span> you to <span>walk</span> on top of the <span>snow</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is an <span>area</span> where <span>miners</span> once <span>searched</span> for <span>gold</span>,<br/>
🎧 though there are very few <span>traces</span> of their work <span>left</span> now.<br/>
🎧 When the <span>snow</span> <span>melts</span> in <span>summer</span>, the <span>mountain</span> <span>slopes</span> are <span>carpeted</span> in <span>flowers</span> and <span>plants</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a long <span>ascent</span>, though not too <span>steep</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>walkers</span> <span>generally</span> take a <span>couple</span> of <span>days</span> to get to the <span>summit</span> and <span>return</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll <span>spend</span> the <span>night</span> in our <span>hut</span> <span>half-way</span> up the <span>mountain</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>included</span> in your <span>package</span> for the <span>stay</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's got cooking <span>facilities</span>, <span>firewood</span> and water for <span>drinking</span>.<br/>
🎧 For <span>washing</span>, we <span>recommend</span> you use <span>melted</span> <span>snow</span>, though, to <span>conserve</span> <span>supplies</span>.<br/>
🎧 We can take your <span>luggage</span> up on our <span>snowmobile</span> for you for just <span>$10</span> a person.<br/>
🎧 The <span>hut</span> has cooking <span>facilities</span> so you can make a hot <span>meal</span> in the <span>evening</span> and morning,<br/>
🎧 but you need to take your own food.<br/>
🎧 The <span>weather</span> on <span>Mount</span> <span>Frenner</span> can be very <span>stormy</span>.<br/>
🎧 In that case, <span>stay</span> in the <span>hut</span> <span>-</span> <span>generally</span> the <span>storms</span> don't last long.<br/>
🎧 Don't <span>stress</span> about getting back here to the <span>centre</span> in time to catch the <span>airport</span> bus <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 they'll probably not be <span>running</span> <span>anyway</span>.<br/>
🎧 We do have an <span>emergency</span> <span>locator</span> <span>beacon</span> in the <span>hut<br/></span>
🎧 but only use that if it's a <span>real</span> <span>emergency</span>, like if <span>someone's</span> <span>ill</span> or <span>injured</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, let me tell you something about the different <span>ski</span> <span>trails</span> you can <span>follow</span> during your <span>stay</span> here.<br/>
🎧 <span>Highland</span> <span>Trail's</span> <span>directly</span> <span>accessible</span> from where we are now.<br/>
🎧 This <span>trail's</span> been <span>designed</span> to give <span>first-timers</span> an <span>experience</span> they'll enjoy <span>regardless</span> of their age or <span>skill</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it's also <span>ideal</span> for <span>experts</span> to <span>practise</span> their <span>technique</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then there's <span>Pine</span> <span>Trail…<br/></span>
🎧 if you're <span>nervous</span> about <span>skiing</span>, leave this one to the <span>experts</span>!<br/>
🎧 You <span>follow</span> a <span>steep</span> <span>valley</span> looking right down on the <span>river</span> <span>below</span> <span>-</span> <span>scary</span>!<br/>
🎧 But if you've <span>fully</span> <span>mastered</span> the <span>techniques</span> <span>needed</span> for <span>hills</span>, it's great fun.<br/>
🎧 <span>Stony</span> <span>Trail's</span> a good <span>choice</span> once you've got a <span>general</span> idea of the <span>basics</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are one or two <span>tricky</span> <span>sections</span>, but <span>nothing</span> too <span>challenging</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>shelter</span> <span>half-way</span> where you can sit and take a <span>break</span> and enjoy the <span>afternoon</span> <span>sunshine</span>.<br/>
🎧 And finally, <span>Loser's</span> <span>Trail</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>starts</span> off <span>following</span> a <span>gentle</span> <span>river</span> <span>valley<br/></span>
🎧 but the last <span>part</span> is quite <span>exposed</span> so the <span>snow</span> <span>conditions</span> can be <span>challenging</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 if it's <span>snowing</span> or <span>windy</span>, check with us before you set out to make sure the <span>trail's</span> open that day.<br/>
🎧 Right, so now if you'd like to <span>follow</span> me, we'll get <span>started…<br/></span>
<br />

🎧 I've still got <span>loads</span> to do for our <span>report</span> on <span>nutritional</span> food <span>labels</span>.<br/>
🎧 Me too.<br/>
🎧 What did you learn from doing the <span>project</span> about your own <span>shopping</span> <span>habits</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I've always had to check <span>labels</span> for <span>traces</span> of <span>peanuts</span> in everything I eat because of my <span>allergy</span>.<br/>
🎧 But <span>beyond</span> that I've never really been <span>concerned</span> enough to check how <span>healthy</span> a product is.<br/>
🎧 This <span>project</span> has actually <span>taught</span> me to read the <span>labels</span> much more <span>carefully</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>tended</span> to <span>believe</span> <span>claims</span> on <span>packaging</span> like <span>'low</span> in <span>fat'</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I now <span>realise</span> that the <span>'healthy'</span> <span>yoghurt</span> I've <span>bought</span> for years is full of <span>sugar<br/></span>
🎧 and that it's actually quite high in <span>calories</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ready <span>meals</span> are the <span>worst…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>comparing</span> the <span>labels</span> on <span>supermarket</span> <span>pizzas</span> was a <span>real</span> <span>eye-opener</span>.<br/>
🎧 Did you have any idea how many <span>calories</span> they <span>contain</span>?<br/>
🎧 I was <span>amazed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, because <span>unless</span> you read the <span>label</span> really <span>carefully</span>,<br/>
🎧 you wouldn't know that the <span>nutritional</span> <span>values</span> <span>given</span> are for <span>half</span> a <span>pizza</span>.<br/>
🎧 When most people eat the whole <span>pizza</span>.<br/>
🎧 Not exactly <span>transparent</span> is it?<br/>
🎧 Not at all.<br/>
🎧 But I <span>expect</span> it won't <span>stop</span> you from <span>buying</span> <span>pizza</span>?<br/>
🎧 Probably not, no!<br/>
🎧 I thought <span>comparing</span> the different <span>labelling</span> <span>systems</span> used by food <span>manufactures</span> was <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think the kind of <span>labelling</span> <span>system</span> used makes a big <span>difference</span>.<br/>
🎧 Which one did you <span>prefer</span>?<br/>
🎧 I <span>liked</span> the <span>traditional</span> <span>daily</span> <span>value</span> <span>system</span> best <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 the one which tells you what <span>proportion</span> of your <span>required</span> <span>daily</span> <span>intake</span> of each <span>ingredient</span> the product <span>contains</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm not sure it's the <span>easiest</span> for people to use but at <span>least</span> you get the full <span>story</span>.<br/>
🎧 I like to know all the <span>ingredients</span> in a product <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 not just how much fat, <span>salt</span> and <span>sugar</span> they <span>contain</span>.<br/>
🎧 But it's good <span>supermarkets</span> have been <span>making</span> an <span>effort</span> to <span>provide</span> <span>reliable</span> <span>information</span> for <span>customers</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes. There just needs to be more <span>consistency</span> between <span>labelling</span> <span>systems</span> used by different <span>supermarkets</span>,<br/>
🎧 in <span>terms</span> of <span>portion</span> <span>sizes</span>, <span>etc</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>labels</span> on the different <span>brands</span> of <span>chicken</span> <span>flavour</span> <span>crisps</span> were quite <span>revealing</span> too, weren't they?<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 I don't <span>understand</span> how they can get away with <span>calling</span> them <span>chicken</span> <span>flavour<br/></span>
🎧 when they only <span>contain</span> <span>artificial</span> <span>additives</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 I'd at <span>least</span> have <span>expected</span> them to <span>contain</span> a small <span>percentage</span> of <span>real</span> <span>chicken</span>.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely.<br/>
🎧 I think having <span>nutritional</span> food <span>labeling</span> has been a good idea, don't you?<br/>
🎧 I think it will change <span>people's</span> <span>behaviour</span> and <span>stop</span> <span>mothers</span>, in <span>particular</span>, <span>buying</span> the wrong things.<br/>
🎧 But didn't that <span>study</span> kind of <span>prove</span> the <span>opposite</span>?<br/>
🎧 People didn't <span>necessarily</span> <span>stop</span> <span>buying</span> <span>unhealthy</span> <span>products</span>.<br/>
🎧 They only said that might be the case.<br/>
🎧 Those <span>findings</span> weren't that <span>conclusive</span> and it was quite a <span>small-scale</span> <span>study</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think more <span>research</span> has to be done.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I think you're probably right.<br/>
🎧 What do you think of the <span>traffic-light</span> <span>system</span>?<br/>
🎧 I think <span>supermarkets</span> like the idea of having a <span>colour-coded</span> <span>system</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 red, <span>orange</span> or <span>green</span> <span>-</span> for <span>levels</span> of fat, <span>sugar</span> and <span>salt</span> in a product.<br/>
🎧 But it's not been <span>adopted</span> <span>universally</span>.<br/>
🎧 And not on all <span>products</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why do you <span>suppose</span> that is?<br/>
🎧 <span>Pressure</span> from the food <span>manufacturers</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hardly</span> <span>surprising</span> that some of them are <span>opposed</span> to <span>flagging</span> up how <span>unhealthy</span> their <span>products</span> are.<br/>
🎧 I'd have thought it would have been <span>compulsory</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>seems</span> <span>ridiculous</span> it isn't.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 And what I couldn't get over is the <span>fact</span> that it was <span>brought</span> in without enough <span>consultation</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 a lot of <span>experts</span> had <span>deep</span> <span>reservations</span> about it.<br/>
🎧 That is a bit <span>weird</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> there's an <span>argument</span> for doing the <span>research</span> now when <span>consumers</span> are <span>familiar</span> with this <span>system</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, maybe.<br/>
🎧 The <span>participants</span> in the <span>survey</span> were quite <span>positive</span> about the <span>traffic-light</span> <span>system</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I don't think they <span>targeted</span> the right people.<br/>
🎧 They should have <span>focused</span> on people with low <span>literacy</span> <span>levels<br/></span>
🎧 because these <span>labels</span> are <span>designed</span> to be <span>accessible</span> to them.<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 But it's good to get <span>feedback</span> from all <span>socio-economic</span> <span>groups</span>.<br/>
🎧 And there wasn't much <span>variation</span> in their <span>responses</span>.<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 But if they hadn't <span>interviewed</span> <span>participants</span> <span>face-to-face</span>,<br/>
🎧 they could have used a much <span>bigger</span> <span>sample</span> size.<br/>
🎧 I <span>wonder</span> why they <span>chose</span> that <span>method</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Dunno</span>.<br/>
🎧 How were they <span>selected</span>?<br/>
🎧 Did they <span>volunteer</span> or were they <span>approached</span>?<br/>
🎧 I think they <span>volunteered</span>.<br/>
🎧 The thing that wasn't <span>stated</span> was how often they <span>bought</span> <span>packaged</span> food <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 all we know is how <span>frequently</span> they used the <span>supermarket</span>.<br/>

🎧 In my <span>presentation</span>, I'm going to talk about <span>coffee</span>,<br/>
🎧 and its <span>importance</span> both in <span>economic</span> and <span>social</span> <span>terms</span>.<br/>
🎧 We think it was first <span>drunk</span> in the <span>Arab</span> <span>world</span>,<br/>
🎧 but there's <span>hardly</span> any <span>documentary</span> <span>evidence</span> of it before the <span>1500s</span>,<br/>
🎧 although of course that doesn't mean that people didn't know about it before then.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, there is <span>evidence</span> that <span>coffee</span> was <span>originally</span> <span>gathered</span> from <span>bushes<br/></span>
🎧 <span>growing</span> <span>wild</span> in <span>Ethiopia</span>, in the <span>northeast</span> of <span>Africa</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>early</span> <span>16th</span> <span>century</span>,<br/>
🎧 it was being <span>bought</span> by <span>traders</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>gradually</span> its use as a drink <span>spread</span> <span>throughout</span> the <span>Middle</span> <span>East</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's also <span>known</span> that in <span>1522</span>,<br/>
🎧 in the <span>Turkish</span> <span>city</span> of <span>Constantinople</span>, which was the <span>centre</span> of the <span>Ottoman</span> <span>Empire</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>court</span> <span>physician</span> <span>approved</span> its use as a <span>medicine</span>.<br/>
🎧 By the <span>mid-1500s</span>, <span>coffee</span> <span>bushes</span> were being <span>cultivated</span> in the <span>Yemen<br/></span>
🎧 and for the next <span>hundred</span> years this <span>region</span> <span>produced</span> most of the <span>coffee</span> <span>drunk</span> in <span>Africa</span> and the <span>Arab</span> <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 What's <span>particularly</span> <span>interesting</span> about <span>coffee</span> is its <span>effect</span> on <span>social</span> life.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>rarely</span> <span>drunk</span> at home,<br/>
🎧 but <span>instead</span> people went to <span>coffee</span> <span>houses</span> to drink it.<br/>
🎧 These people, usually men, would meet to drink <span>coffee</span> and <span>chat</span> about issues of the day.<br/>
🎧 But at the time, this <span>chance</span> to share <span>ideas</span> and <span>opinions</span> was <span>seen</span> as something that was <span>potentially</span> <span>dangerous</span>,<br/>
🎧 and in <span>1623</span> the <span>ruler</span> of <span>Constantinople</span> <span>demanded</span> the <span>destruction</span> of all the <span>coffee</span> <span>houses</span> in the <span>city</span>,<br/>
🎧 although after his <span>death</span> many new <span>ones</span> <span>opened</span>, and <span>coffee</span> <span>consumption</span> <span>continued</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>seventeenth</span> <span>century</span>, <span>coffee</span> <span>drinking</span> <span>spread</span> to <span>Europe</span>,<br/>
🎧 and here too <span>coffee</span> <span>shops</span> <span>became</span> <span>places</span> where <span>ordinary</span> people, <span>nearly</span> always men, could meet to <span>exchange</span> <span>ideas</span>.<br/>
🎧 Because of this, some people said that these <span>places</span> <span>performed</span> a <span>similar</span> <span>function</span> to <span>universities</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>opportunity</span> they <span>provided</span> for people to meet together outside their own <span>homes<br/></span>
🎧 and to <span>discuss</span> the <span>topics</span> of the day had an <span>enormous</span> <span>impact</span> on <span>social</span> life,<br/>
🎧 and many <span>social</span> <span>movements</span> and <span>political</span> <span>developments</span> had their <span>origins</span> in <span>coffee</span> house <span>discussions</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>late</span> <span>1600s</span>, the <span>Yemeni</span> <span>monopoly</span> on <span>coffee</span> <span>production</span> <span>broke</span> <span>down<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>coffee</span> <span>production</span> <span>started</span> to <span>spread</span> around the <span>world</span>, <span>helped</span> by <span>European</span> <span>colonization</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Europeans</span> set up <span>coffee</span> <span>plantations</span> in <span>Indonesia</span> and the <span>Caribbean<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>production</span> of <span>coffee</span> in the <span>colonies</span> <span>skyrocketed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Different <span>types</span> of <span>coffee</span> were <span>produced</span> in different <span>areas</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it's <span>interesting</span> that the <span>names</span> <span>given</span> to these different <span>types</span>,<br/>
🎧 like <span>Mocha</span> or <span>Java</span> <span>coffee</span>,<br/>
🎧 were often taken from the <span>port</span> they were <span>shipped</span> to <span>Europe</span> from.<br/>
🎧 But if you look at the <span>labour</span> <span>system</span> in the different <span>colonies</span>,<br/>
🎧 there were some <span>significant</span> <span>differences</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>Brazil</span> and the <span>various</span> <span>Caribbean</span> <span>colonies</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>coffee</span> was <span>grown</span> in <span>huge</span> <span>plantations<br/></span>
🎧 and the <span>workers</span> there were almost all <span>slaves</span>.<br/>
🎧 But this wasn't the same in all <span>colonies;<br/></span>
🎧 for example in <span>Java</span>, which had been <span>colonized</span> by the <span>Dutch</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>peasants</span> <span>grew</span> <span>coffee</span> and <span>passed</span> a <span>proportion</span> of this on to the <span>Dutch</span>,<br/>
🎧 so it was used as a <span>means</span> of <span>taxation</span>.<br/>
🎧 But whatever <span>system</span> was used, under the <span>European</span> <span>powers</span> of the <span>18th</span> <span>century</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>coffee</span> <span>production</span> was very <span>closely</span> <span>linked</span> to <span>colonisation</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Coffee</span> was <span>grown</span> in <span>ever-increasing</span> <span>quantities</span> to <span>satisfy</span> the <span>growing</span> <span>demand</span> from <span>Europe</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it <span>became</span> <span>nearly</span> as important as <span>sugar</span> <span>production</span>,<br/>
🎧 which was <span>grown</span> under very <span>similar</span> <span>conditions</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, <span>coffee</span> <span>prices</span> were not yet low enough for people to drink it <span>regularly</span> at home,<br/>
🎧 so most <span>coffee</span> <span>consumption</span> still took place in <span>public</span> <span>coffee</span> <span>houses<br/></span>
🎧 and it still <span>remained</span> something of a <span>luxury</span> <span>item</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>Britain</span>, <span>however</span>, a new drink was <span>introduced</span> from <span>China</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>started</span> to become <span>popular</span>, <span>gradually</span> taking over from <span>coffee</span>,<br/>
🎧 although at first it was so <span>expensive</span> that only the <span>upper</span> <span>classes</span> could <span>afford</span> it.<br/>
🎧 This was tea,<br/>
🎧 and by the <span>late</span> <span>1700s</span> it was being <span>widely</span> <span>drunk</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, when the <span>USA</span> <span>gained</span> <span>independence</span> from <span>Britain</span> in <span>1776</span>,<br/>
🎧 they <span>identified</span> this drink with <span>Britain</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>coffee</span> <span>remained</span> the <span>preferred</span> drink in the <span>USA</span>, as it still is today.<br/>
🎧 So, by the <span>early</span> <span>19th</span> <span>century</span>, <span>coffee</span> was already being <span>widely</span> <span>produced</span> and <span>consumed</span>.<br/>
🎧 But during this <span>century</span>, <span>production</span> <span>boomed</span> and <span>coffee</span> <span>prices</span> <span>started</span> to <span>fall</span>.<br/>
🎧 This was <span>partly</span> because new <span>types</span> of <span>transportation</span> had been <span>developed</span> which were <span>cheaper</span> and more <span>efficient</span>.<br/>
🎧 So now, working people could <span>afford</span> to buy <span>coffee</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it wasn't just a drink for the <span>middle</span> <span>classes</span>.<br/>
🎧 And this was at a time when large <span>parts</span> of <span>Europe</span> were <span>starting</span> to work in <span>industries</span>.<br/>
🎧 And sometimes this <span>meant</span> their work didn't <span>stop</span> when it got <span>dark;<br/></span>
🎧 they might have to <span>continue</span> <span>throughout</span> the <span>night</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, the use of <span>coffee</span> as a <span>stimulant</span> <span>became</span> important <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it wasn't just a drink people <span>drank</span> in the morning, for <span>breakfast</span>.<br/>
🎧 There were also changes in <span>cultivation…<br/>
