🎧 Good morning. <span>World</span> <span>Tours</span>.<br/>
🎧 My name is <span>Jamie</span>.<br/>
🎧 How can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 I want some <span>information</span> on <span>self-drive</span> <span>tours</span> in the <span>USA</span>.<br/>
🎧 Could you <span>send</span> me a <span>brochure</span>?<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 Could I have your name please?<br/>
🎧 <span>Andrea</span> <span>Brown</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 And your <span>address</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>24</span>, <span>Ardleigh</span> <span>Road</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can you <span>spell</span> that?<br/>
🎧 <span>A-R-D-L-E-I-G-H</span> <span>Road</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Postcode</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>BH52OP<br/></span>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 And can I have your phone number?<br/>
🎧 Is a <span>mobile</span> alright?<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>07786643091</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 And can I ask you where you heard about <span>World</span> <span>Tours</span>?<br/>
🎧 From a friend? Or did you see an <span>advert</span> somewhere?<br/>
🎧 No, I read about you in the <span>newspaper</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, I'll get the <span>brochures</span> in the <span>post</span> to you but can I give you some <span>information</span> over the phone.<br/>
🎧 What <span>kinds</span> of things do you want to do on your <span>holiday</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm interested in going to <span>California</span> with my <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've got two children and we want to <span>hire</span> a car.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 We have a <span>couple</span> of <span>self-drive</span> <span>tours</span> there <span>visiting</span> different <span>places</span> of <span>interest</span> in <span>California</span>.<br/>
🎧 The first one <span>begins</span> in <span>Los</span> <span>Angeles</span> and there's <span>plenty</span> of time to visit some of the <span>theme</span> <span>parks</span> there.<br/>
🎧 That's something on my <span>children's</span> <span>list</span> so I'd want to <span>include</span> that.<br/>
🎧 Good. Then you drive to <span>San</span> <span>Francisco</span>.<br/>
🎧 From <span>San</span> <span>Francisco</span> you can drive to <span>Yosemite</span> <span>Park</span> where you <span>spend</span> a <span>couple</span> of <span>nights</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can choose to <span>stay</span> in a <span>lodge</span> or on the <span>campsite</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't like the idea of <span>staying</span> in a <span>tent</span>.<br/>
🎧 It'd be too hot.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>tour</span> <span>ends</span> in <span>Las</span> <span>Vegas</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 The other <span>trip</span> we can <span>arrange</span> is <span>slightly</span> different.<br/>
🎧 It <span>starts</span> in <span>San</span> <span>Francisco</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then you drive <span>south</span> to <span>Cambria</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Someone</span> told me there's a really nice <span>castle</span> near <span>Cambria</span>.<br/>
🎧 Will we go near that?<br/>
🎧 <span>Hearst</span> <span>Castle</span> is on that <span>road</span> so you could <span>stop</span> there.<br/>
🎧 Good. I'd like to do that.<br/>
🎧 Does this <span>trip</span> also go into the <span>desert</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, it <span>continues</span> to <span>Santa</span> <span>Monica</span> where most people like to <span>stop</span> and do some <span>shopping</span>.<br/>
🎧 We have enough of that at home so that doesn't <span>interest</span> us.<br/>
🎧 OK. Well you could go <span>straight</span> on to <span>San</span> <span>Diego</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's good for <span>beaches</span> isn't it?<br/>
🎧 That's right, that's a good place to <span>relax</span> and your children might like to visit the zoo before <span>flying</span> home.<br/>
🎧 I don't think so.<br/>
🎧 We want some time for <span>sunbathing</span> and <span>swimming</span>.<br/>
🎧 So how many <span>days</span> are the <span>trips</span> and how much do they <span>cost</span>?<br/>
🎧 The first one I told you about is a <span>self-drive</span> <span>tour</span> through <span>California<br/></span>
🎧 which <span>lasts</span> <span>twelve</span> <span>days</span> and <span>covers</span> <span>2,020</span> <span>kilometres</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>shortest</span> <span>journey</span> is <span>206</span> <span>kilometres<br/></span>
🎧 and the <span>longest</span> is <span>632</span> <span>kilometres</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>cost</span> is <span>£525</span> <span>per</span> person.<br/>
🎧 That <span>includes</span> <span>accommodation</span>, car <span>rental</span> and a <span>flight</span> but no <span>meals</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK. And the other <span>trip</span>?<br/>
🎧 That <span>lasts</span> <span>nine</span> <span>days</span> but you <span>spend</span> only <span>three</span> <span>days</span> on the <span>road</span>.<br/>
🎧 You <span>cover</span> about <span>980</span> <span>kilometres</span> <span>altogether</span>.<br/>
🎧 So is that <span>cheaper</span> then?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's almost a <span>hundred</span> <span>pounds</span> <span>cheaper</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>£429</span> <span>per</span> person, which is a good <span>deal</span>.<br/>
🎧 So that <span>covers</span> <span>accommodation</span> and car <span>hire</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about <span>flights</span>?<br/>
🎧 They aren't <span>included</span>.<br/>
🎧 But these <span>hotels</span> <span>offer</span> dinner in the <span>price</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK. Well, thank you very much.<br/>
🎧 I'll be in touch when I've had a <span>chance</span> to look at the <span>brochure</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>pleased</span> to help.<br/>
🎧 <span>Goodbye</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Goodbye</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 On <span>behalf</span> of <span>LP</span> <span>Clubs</span>, I'd like to <span>welcome</span> you all here today.<br/>
🎧 My <span>name's</span> <span>Sandy</span> <span>Fisher</span> and I'm one of the <span>fitness</span> <span>managers</span> here.<br/>
🎧 Before we start our <span>tour</span> of the <span>club<br/></span>
🎧 I'll just run through some <span>basic</span> <span>information</span> about the <span>facilities</span> we have here,<br/>
🎧 <span>including</span> <span>recent</span> <span>improvements</span>, and <span>explain</span> the <span>types</span> of <span>membership</span> <span>available</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>greatest</span> <span>asset</span> is probably our <span>swimming</span> <span>pool<br/></span>
🎧 which at <span>25</span> <span>metres</span> isn't <span>Olympic-sized</span>,<br/>
🎧 but now we've <span>expanded</span> it to <span>eight</span> <span>lanes</span>, it's much <span>wider</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>means</span> there are <span>rarely</span> more than a <span>couple</span> of people at a time in each <span>lane</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Unfortunately</span>, there isn't <span>space</span> for an <span>outdoor</span> <span>pool</span> <span>here<br/></span>
🎧 but the <span>glass</span> <span>roof</span> on the <span>swimming</span> <span>pool</span> is <span>partly</span> <span>retractable</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>means</span> you can enjoy something of the <span>open-air</span> <span>experience</span> on <span>warmer</span> <span>days</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>recently</span> <span>refurbished</span> <span>fitness</span> <span>suite</span> has all the <span>latest</span> <span>exercise</span> <span>equipment<br/></span>
🎧 <span>including</span> ten new <span>running</span> <span>machines</span>, and a <span>wide</span> <span>range</span> of <span>weight-training</span> <span>machines</span>.<br/>
🎧 Each <span>member</span> is <span>given</span> full <span>training</span> in how to <span>operate</span> the <span>equipment<br/></span>
🎧 and there is always a <span>trainer</span> on <span>duty</span> to <span>offer</span> help and advice.<br/>
🎧 Although we do have <span>adult-only</span> <span>times</span> after <span>6</span> and at <span>certain</span> <span>times</span> at <span>weekends</span>,<br/>
🎧 children are well <span>catered</span> for.<br/>
🎧 <span>Older</span> children <span>continue</span> to <span>benefit</span> from a <span>wide</span> <span>range</span> of <span>tuition;<br/></span>
🎧 anything from <span>trampolining</span> to <span>yoga</span>.<br/>
🎧 One thing all our <span>members</span> <span>appreciate</span> about us is that we take very good <span>care</span> of them.<br/>
🎧 This <span>starts</span> on day one with your personal <span>assessment</span>.<br/>
🎧 You are <span>asked</span> to <span>fill</span> in a <span>questionnaire</span> <span>giving</span> <span>details</span> of any <span>health</span> <span>problems</span>.<br/>
🎧 One of our personal <span>trainers</span> will then go through this with you.<br/>
🎧 The <span>trainer</span> will then take you through the <span>safety</span> <span>rules</span> for <span>using</span> the <span>equipment</span> in the <span>fitness</span> <span>suite</span>.<br/>
🎧 During your next <span>exercise</span> <span>session</span>, a personal <span>trainer</span> will work with you to make sure you <span>understand</span> these.<br/>
🎧 It's very important to do this because we really do want to <span>avoid</span> having any <span>sports</span> <span>injuries</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's a lot more to looking after yourself than <span>simply</span> <span>lifting</span> <span>weights</span>!<br/>
🎧 At the end of the personal <span>assessment</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>trainer</span> will <span>draw</span> up a plan, <span>outlining</span> what you should try to <span>achieve</span> <span>within</span> a <span>six-week</span> <span>period</span>.<br/>
🎧 This will then be <span>reviewed</span> at the end of the six <span>weeks</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, I'll just quickly run through the <span>types</span> of <span>membership</span> we have <span>available</span>.<br/>
🎧 All <span>members</span> must pay a <span>joining</span> <span>fee</span> of <span>£90<br/></span>
🎧 in <span>addition</span> to the <span>rates</span> for the <span>monthly</span> <span>membership</span> <span>fees</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Gold</span> <span>membership</span> <span>entitles</span> you to free <span>entry</span> at all <span>LP</span> <span>Clubs</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are now <span>LP</span> <span>clubs</span> in all <span>major</span> <span>cities</span> and <span>towns<br/></span>
🎧 so if you travel a lot, this will be a great <span>advantage</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Individual</span> <span>gold</span> <span>membership</span> <span>costs</span> <span>£50</span> a <span>month<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>joint</span> <span>membership</span> for you and your <span>partner</span> will <span>cost</span> <span>£75</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Premier</span> <span>membership</span> is for <span>professional</span> <span>people<br/></span>
🎧 whose work <span>commitments</span> make it <span>difficult</span> for them to use the <span>club</span> during the <span>day<br/></span>
🎧 and so <span>LP</span> <span>gives</span> <span>booking</span> <span>preferences</span> to <span>Premier</span> <span>members</span> at <span>peak</span> <span>times</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>means</span> you will find it <span>easier</span> to book the <span>sessions</span> at <span>times</span> that <span>suit</span> you.<br/>
🎧 <span>Reciprocal</span> <span>arrangements</span> with other <span>LP</span> <span>Clubs</span> are <span>available</span> to <span>Premier</span> <span>members</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Premier</span> <span>membership</span> is for <span>individuals</span> only,<br/>
🎧 but you will be <span>sent</span> <span>passes</span> for <span>guests</span> every month.<br/>
🎧 The <span>monthly</span> <span>fee</span> is <span>£65</span>.<br/>
🎧 You don't have to have any special <span>clothes</span> or <span>equipment</span> when you visit the <span>club</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>provide</span> <span>robes</span> and <span>hairdryers</span> in the <span>changing</span> <span>rooms</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it's very important to remember your <span>photo</span> <span>card<br/></span>
🎧 because you won't be able to get in without it.<br/>
🎧 For people who aren't <span>working..</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 <span>Erm…</span> hello <span>Professor</span>, I'm <span>John</span> <span>Wishart</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm working on my <span>entry</span> for the <span>Global</span> <span>Design</span> <span>Competition</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>tutor</span> said you might be able to help me with it.<br/>
🎧 Ah, yes, I got a <span>copy</span> of your <span>drawings</span>.<br/>
🎧 Come in and tell me about it.<br/>
🎧 What <span>sort</span> of <span>competition</span> is it?<br/>
🎧 Well, it's an <span>international</span> <span>design</span> <span>competition<br/></span>
🎧 and we have to come up with a new <span>design</span> for a <span>typical</span> <span>domestic</span> <span>kitchen</span> <span>appliance</span>.<br/>
🎧 I see, and are there any special <span>conditions</span>? Does it have to <span>save</span> <span>energy</span> for example?<br/>
🎧 Actually that was the focus in last <span>year's</span> <span>competition</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>year's</span> different.<br/>
🎧 We have to <span>adopt</span> an <span>innovative</span> <span>approach</span> to <span>existing</span> <span>technology</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>using</span> it in a way that hasn't been thought of before.<br/>
🎧 I see, that sounds <span>tricky</span>.<br/>
🎧 And what <span>kitchen</span> <span>appliance</span> have you <span>chosen</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I <span>decided</span> to choose the <span>dishwasher</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Interesting</span>, what made you choose that?<br/>
🎧 Well, they're an everyday <span>kitchen</span> <span>appliance</span> in most <span>Australian</span> <span>houses<br/></span>
🎧 but they're all <span>pretty</span> <span>boring</span> and almost <span>identical</span> to each other.<br/>
🎧 I think some people will be <span>prepared</span> to pay a little <span>extra</span> for something that looks different.<br/>
🎧 That's a nice idea.<br/>
🎧 I see you've called your <span>design</span> <span>'the</span> <span>Rockpool';</span> why is that?<br/>
🎧 <span>Basically</span> because it looks like the <span>rock</span> <span>pools</span> you find on a <span>beach</span>.<br/>
🎧 The top is made of <span>glass</span> so that you can look down into it.<br/>
🎧 And there's a <span>stone</span> at the <span>bottom</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is that just for <span>decoration</span>?<br/>
🎧 Actually it does have a <span>function</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Instead</span> of <span>pushing</span> a <span>button</span>, you <span>turn</span> the <span>stone</span>.<br/>
🎧 So it's really just a <span>novel</span> way of <span>starting</span> the <span>dishwasher</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 It's a really nice <span>design</span>, but what makes it <span>innovative</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I <span>decided</span> to make a <span>dishwasher</span> that <span>uses</span> <span>carbon</span> <span>dioxide</span>.<br/>
🎧 In place of water and <span>detergent</span>?<br/>
🎧 How will you <span>manage</span> that?<br/>
🎧 The idea is to <span>pressurize</span> the <span>carbon</span> <span>dioxide</span> so that it <span>becomes</span> a <span>liquid</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>fluid</span> is then <span>released</span> into the <span>dishwasher</span> where it <span>cleans</span> the <span>dishes</span> all by <span>itself</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sounds like a <span>brilliant</span> idea!<br/>
🎧 Your <span>system</span> will <span>totally</span> do away with the need for <span>strong</span> <span>detergents</span>.<br/>
🎧 So what <span>happens</span> once the <span>dishes</span> are <span>clean</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, to <span>allow</span> them to dry,<br/>
🎧 the <span>liquid</span> <span>carbon</span> <span>dioxide</span> and the <span>waste</span> <span>materials</span> all go to an <span>area</span> called the <span>holding</span> <span>chamber</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's where the <span>liquid</span> is <span>depressurised</span> and so it <span>reverts</span> to a gas.<br/>
🎧 Then the oil and <span>grease</span> are <span>separated</span> out and <span>sent</span> to the <span>waste</span> <span>system</span>.<br/>
🎧 It sounds like you've thought it all out very <span>thoroughly</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, what <span>happens</span> to the <span>carbon</span> <span>dioxide</span> once the <span>process</span> is <span>complete</span>?<br/>
🎧 Not <span>wasted</span> I hope.<br/>
🎧 Actually, that's where the <span>real</span> <span>savings</span> are made.<br/>
🎧 The <span>carbon</span> <span>dioxide</span> is <span>sent</span> back to the <span>cylinder</span> and can be used again and again.<br/>
🎧 What a <span>terrific</span> idea.<br/>
🎧 Do you think it will ever be <span>built</span>?<br/>
🎧 Probably not, but that's OK.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm sure a lot of <span>positive</span> things will come out of your <span>design</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, you <span>seem</span> to have thought about everything so what exactly did you need me to help you with?<br/>
🎧 Well, my <span>design</span> has made it to the <span>final</span> <span>stage</span> of the <span>competition<br/></span>
🎧 and, in a few <span>months'</span> time. I have to give a <span>presentation</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that's the <span>part</span> I was <span>hoping</span> you could help me with.<br/>
🎧 Right, well that should be easy enough.<br/>
🎧 What have you <span>managed</span> to do so <span>far</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I've got <span>detailed</span> <span>drawings</span> to show how it will <span>work<br/></span>
🎧 and I've also <span>written</span> a <span>500-word</span> <span>paper</span> on it.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 Well, if you want to <span>stand</span> a good <span>chance</span> of <span>winning</span> you really need a <span>model</span> of the <span>machine</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I thought I might but I'm having a few <span>problems</span>.<br/>
🎧 What is the <span>main</span> <span>difficulty</span> so <span>far</span>?<br/>
🎧 Let me <span>guess</span> <span>-</span> is it the <span>materials</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 I want it to look <span>professional</span> but everything that's top <span>quality</span> is also very <span>expensive</span>.<br/>
🎧 Look, <span>projects</span> like this are very important to us.<br/>
🎧 They really help <span>lift</span> our <span>profile</span>.<br/>
🎧 So why don't you talk to the university about a <span>grant</span>?<br/>
🎧 I can help you <span>fill</span> out the <span>application</span> <span>forms</span> if you like.<br/>
🎧 That would be great.<br/>
🎧 You'd better show me this <span>paper</span> you've <span>written</span> as well.<br/>
🎧 For a <span>global</span> <span>competition</span> such as <span>this<br/></span>
🎧 you need to make sure the <span>technical</span> <span>details</span> you've <span>given</span> are <span>accurate</span> and <span>thorough</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that would be a great help.<br/>
🎧 Is there anything else I can do?<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm <span>really…<br/>

🎧 One in ten <span>black</span> <span>bears</span> is actually <span>born</span> with a <span>white</span> <span>coat</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is the <span>result</span> of a special <span>gene</span> that <span>surfaces</span> in a few.<br/>
🎧 <span>Local</span> people have <span>named</span> it <span>'the</span> <span>spirit</span> <span>bear'</span>.<br/>
🎧 And <span>according</span> to the <span>legends</span> of these <span>communities</span>,<br/>
🎧 its <span>snowy</span> fur <span>brings</span> with it a special <span>power</span>.<br/>
🎧 Because of this, it has always been <span>highly</span> <span>regarded</span> by them <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 so much that they do not speak of <span>seeing</span> it to <span>anyone</span> else.<br/>
🎧 It is their way of <span>protecting</span> it when <span>strangers</span> visit the <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>white</span> <span>bear's</span> <span>habitat</span> is quite <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>bear's</span> <span>strong</span> <span>relationship</span> with the <span>old-growth</span> <span>rainforest</span> is a <span>complex</span> one.<br/>
🎧 The <span>white</span> <span>bear</span> <span>relies</span> on the <span>huge</span> <span>centuries-old</span> <span>trees</span> in the <span>forest</span> in many <span>ways</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, the <span>old-growth</span> <span>trees</span> have <span>extremely</span> long <span>roots<br/></span>
🎧 that help <span>prevent</span> <span>erosion</span> of the <span>soil</span> along the <span>banks</span> of the many <span>fish</span> <span>streams</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Keeping</span> these <span>banks</span> <span>intact</span> is <span>important<br/></span>
🎧 because these <span>streams</span> are home to <span>salmon</span>,<br/>
🎧 which are the <span>bear's</span> <span>main</span> food <span>source</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>return</span>, the <span>bear's</span> <span>feeding</span> <span>habits</span> <span>nurture</span> the <span>forest</span>.<br/>
🎧 As the <span>bears</span> eat the <span>salmon</span>,<br/>
🎧 they <span>discard</span> the <span>skin</span> and <span>bones</span> in great <span>amounts</span> on the <span>forest</span> <span>floor</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>provide</span> <span>vital</span> <span>nutrients</span>.<br/>
🎧 These <span>produce</span> <span>lush</span> <span>vegetation</span> that <span>sustains</span> <span>thousands</span> of other <span>types</span> of life <span>forms</span>,<br/>
🎧 from <span>birds</span> to <span>insects</span> and more.<br/>
🎧 Today, the <span>spirit</span> <span>bear</span> lives off the <span>coast</span> of the <span>province</span> of <span>British</span> <span>Columbia</span> on a few <span>islands</span>.<br/>
🎧 There is great <span>concern</span> for their <span>survival<br/></span>
🎧 since it is <span>estimated</span> that less than <span>200</span> of these <span>white</span> <span>bears</span> <span>remain</span>.<br/>
🎧 The best way to <span>protect</span> them is to make every <span>effort</span> to <span>preserve</span> the <span>delicate</span> <span>balance</span> of their <span>forest</span> <span>environment</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 in other <span>words</span>, their <span>ecosystem</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>greatest</span> <span>threat</span> to the <span>bear's</span> <span>existence</span> is the <span>loss</span> of its <span>habitat</span>.<br/>
🎧 Over many years, <span>logging</span> <span>companies</span> have <span>stripped</span> the <span>land</span> by <span>cutting</span> down a large number of <span>trees</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>addition</span>, they have <span>built</span> <span>roads</span> which have <span>fractured</span> the <span>areas</span> where the <span>bear</span> usually <span>feeds</span>,<br/>
🎧 and many <span>hibernation</span> <span>sites</span> have also been <span>lost</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>logging</span> of the <span>trees</span> along the <span>streams</span> has <span>damaged</span> the <span>places</span> where the <span>bears</span> <span>fish</span>.<br/>
🎧 To make <span>matters</span> <span>worse</span>,<br/>
🎧 the number of <span>salmon</span> in those <span>streams</span> is <span>declining<br/></span>
🎧 because there is no <span>legal</span> <span>limit</span> on <span>fishing</span> at the <span>moment</span>.<br/>
🎧 All these <span>influences</span> have a <span>negative</span> <span>impact</span> on the <span>spirit</span> <span>bear's</span> very <span>existence</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is made all the more <span>fragile<br/></span>
🎧 by the <span>fact</span> that <span>reproduction</span> <span>among</span> these <span>bears</span> has always been <span>disappointingly</span> low.<br/>
🎧 And so, what's the <span>situation</span> going forward?<br/>
🎧 <span>Community</span> <span>organizations</span>, <span>environmental</span> <span>groups</span> and the <span>British</span> <span>Columbia</span> <span>government<br/></span>
🎧 are now working together on the <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>government</span> is now <span>requiring</span> <span>logging</span> <span>companies<br/></span>
🎧 to <span>adopt</span> a better <span>logging</span> <span>method</span>, which is a <span>positive</span> <span>step</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, these <span>measures</span> <span>alone</span> may not be <span>sufficient</span> to <span>ensure</span> a <span>healthy</span> <span>population</span> of the <span>spirit</span> <span>bear</span> in the future.<br/>
🎧 Other <span>steps</span> also need to be taken.<br/>
🎧 While it is important to <span>maintain</span> the <span>spirit</span> <span>bear's</span> <span>habitat</span>,<br/>
🎧 there also needs to be more <span>emphasis</span> on its <span>expansion</span>.<br/>
🎧 The move is <span>justified</span> as it will also <span>create</span> <span>space</span> for other <span>bears</span> that are <span>losing</span> their <span>homes…<br/>
