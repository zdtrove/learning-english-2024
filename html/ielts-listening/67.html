🎧 Hi <span>Shannon</span>, how are you <span>settling</span> into your new <span>flat</span>?<br/>
🎧 Really well, thanks.<br/>
🎧 You look like you're going <span>shopping</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I am.<br/>
🎧 My <span>cousins</span> are <span>coming</span> to <span>stay</span> for a <span>couple</span> of <span>days</span>, and I have to <span>cook</span> for them.<br/>
🎧 Well, there are <span>plenty</span> of <span>places</span> to buy food in <span>Kite</span> Place,<br/>
🎧 it's the <span>area</span> by the <span>harbour</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, okay, I'll find that on the map.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 What <span>sort</span> of food do you need to get?<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>neither</span> of them <span>eats</span> <span>meat</span> but they both like <span>fish</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, there's a really good <span>fish</span> <span>market</span> there.<br/>
🎧 Oh great!<br/>
🎧 Where is it exactly?<br/>
🎧 It's at the <span>far</span> end of <span>Kite</span> Place,<br/>
🎧 so you have to go over the <span>bridge</span> and then it's on the right.<br/>
🎧 Okay, is it open all day?<br/>
🎧 It doesn't <span>close</span> until <span>four</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I'd <span>recommend</span> going <span>earlier</span> than that,<br/>
🎧 it does run out of some things.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I don't want that to <span>happen</span>.<br/>
🎧 As long as you get there by <span>3:30</span>, you should be fine.<br/>
🎧 It's only <span>11</span> now, so <span>plenty</span> of time.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Do you need to buy <span>vegetables</span> too?<br/>
🎧 I do, and I want to <span>avoid</span> all the <span>plastic</span> <span>packaging</span> in the <span>supermarket</span>!<br/>
🎧 Well, there's a really nice <span>organic</span> <span>shop</span> there.<br/>
🎧 Now what's it <span>called..</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's the name of a <span>flower</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know, it's <span>'Rose'</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's a nice name.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, it <span>sells</span> <span>vegetables</span> and quite a lot of other <span>stuff</span>.<br/>
🎧 And where's that?<br/>
🎧 Well, as you <span>reach</span> the <span>market</span>,<br/>
🎧 you'll see a big <span>grey</span> <span>building</span> on your <span>left</span>,<br/>
🎧 I think it used to be a <span>warehouse</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, now it's a <span>restaurant</span> <span>upstairs</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>ground</span> <span>floor</span> has two <span>shops</span> either side of the <span>entrance</span> and it's the one on the <span>left</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's easy enough.<br/>
🎧 You can't <span>miss</span> it,<br/>
🎧 there's also a big <span>sign</span> on the <span>pavement</span> so you can look for that.<br/>
🎧 Fine!<br/>
🎧 I <span>guess</span> if I need anything else, I'll have to go to the <span>supermarket</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, you should be able to get everything you need,<br/>
🎧 but there's a <span>minibus</span> that <span>goes</span> to the <span>supermarket</span> if you need it.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>purple</span> and the number is <span>289</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks, that's great.<br/>
🎧 So what do you need to get at the <span>fish</span> <span>market</span>?<br/>
🎧 The <span>salmon</span> is always very good and the <span>shellfish..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm going to make a <span>curry</span>, I think,<br/>
🎧 and I need about <span>12</span> <span>prawns</span> for that.<br/>
🎧 They'll have <span>plenty</span> of those.<br/>
🎧 Have you ever <span>tried</span> <span>samphire</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, what's that?<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>type</span> of <span>seaweed</span>.<br/>
🎧 I just ask for a <span>handful</span> and you <span>fry</span> it in <span>butter</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>delicious</span>!<br/>
🎧 Oh, I might try that,<br/>
🎧 how do you <span>spell</span> it?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>SAMPHIRE</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great! It's always good to try something different.<br/>
🎧 I'll see what <span>beans</span> they have in the <span>organic</span> <span>shop<br/></span>
🎧 and I think I'll get something for <span>dessert</span> there.<br/>
🎧 How about a <span>mango</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm not sure, they're not always <span>ripe</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd <span>prefer</span> a <span>melon</span>, it's <span>bigger</span> too.<br/>
🎧 Good idea.<br/>
🎧 The <span>owner</span> also <span>sells</span> a lot of <span>spices</span> there that you can put in a <span>curry</span>,<br/>
🎧 and things like <span>coconut</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's very <span>helpful</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll have a look.<br/>
🎧 No <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know <span>bread</span> doesn't really go with <span>curry<br/></span>
🎧 but I always like to have some in case.<br/>
🎧 As I said, all the <span>bread</span> is <span>home-made</span> and there's lots of <span>variety</span>.<br/>
🎧 I like the <span>brown</span> <span>bread</span> myself.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mm</span>, sounds good.<br/>
🎧 They sell other things there too.<br/>
🎧 Like <span>cakes</span>?<br/>
🎧 I love <span>chocolate</span> <span>cake</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, not that,<br/>
🎧 but they have a whole <span>range</span> of <span>tarts<br/></span>
🎧 and the best are the <span>strawberry</span> <span>ones</span>.<br/>
🎧 Perfect!<br/>
🎧 <span>Hopefully</span> I won't even have to go to the <span>supermarket</span>!<br/>

🎧 The <span>children's</span> book <span>festival</span> is <span>coming</span> up again <span>soon<br/></span>
🎧 and here to tell us all about it is the <span>festival's</span> <span>organiser</span>, <span>Jenny</span> <span>Morgan</span>.<br/>
🎧 So tell us what we can <span>expect</span> this year, <span>Jenny</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, as <span>usual</span> we've got <span>five</span> <span>days</span> of <span>action-packed</span> <span>exciting</span> <span>events</span> for children,<br/>
🎧 with <span>writers</span> <span>coming</span> from all over the <span>country</span> getting <span>involved</span>.<br/>
🎧 Just to give you an idea of what's on <span>offer</span> in the <span>workshops</span>,<br/>
🎧 first of all, there's a very special <span>event</span> called <span>Superheroes</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is a <span>chance</span> for <span>deaf</span> children to share their <span>reading</span> <span>experiences</span> with <span>author</span> <span>Madeleine</span> <span>Gordon</span>,<br/>
🎧 who is <span>herself</span> <span>hearing</span> <span>impaired</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>'Just</span> do <span>it'</span> is a <span>practical</span> <span>workshop</span> <span>led</span> by the <span>well-known</span> <span>illustrator</span> <span>Mark</span> <span>Keane</span>.<br/>
🎧 He'll take <span>participants</span> on a <span>magical</span> <span>journey</span> to <span>faraway</span> <span>lands<br/></span>
🎧 with an <span>opportunity</span> for <span>aspiring</span> <span>actors</span> to do some <span>role</span> play.<br/>
🎧 <span>'Count</span> on <span>me'</span> is an <span>inspiring</span> and <span>entertaining</span> look at the issues of <span>friendship</span> for <span>13</span> to <span>14-year-olds</span>.<br/>
🎧 It looks at some of the <span>friendships</span> <span>described</span> in <span>popular</span> <span>books<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>asks</span> <span>participants</span> to <span>compare</span> these with their own <span>experiences</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>'Speak</span> <span>up'</span> is <span>part</span> of a <span>series</span> of <span>workshops</span> on the <span>subject</span> of <span>mental</span> <span>health</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is a <span>creative</span> <span>writing</span> <span>workshop</span> <span>encouraging</span> children to <span>describe</span> <span>situations<br/></span>
🎧 where young people <span>experience</span> <span>loneliness</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>recent</span> <span>survey</span> <span>revealed</span> that children can be <span>lonely<br/></span>
🎧 even when they're at home with their <span>families</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>'Jump</span> for <span>joy'</span>, as many of you will know,<br/>
🎧 is the <span>heart-warming</span>, <span>best-selling</span> <span>story</span> by <span>Nina</span> <span>Karan<br/></span>
🎧 about a young <span>girl's</span> <span>trip</span> to visit her <span>relatives</span> in <span>India</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>recently</span> <span>received</span> the <span>gold</span> <span>medal</span> at the <span>Waterford</span> <span>Awards</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Nina</span> will get children to <span>celebrate</span> the <span>word</span> <span>'joy'</span> by <span>writing</span> a <span>poem</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>'Sticks</span> and <span>stones'</span> is the <span>beautifully</span> <span>illustrated</span> <span>picture</span> book for young <span>readers<br/></span>
🎧 about a <span>community</span> who <span>organise</span> an <span>African-Caribbean</span> <span>festival<br/></span>
🎧 to help <span>local</span> children learn about their <span>Jamaican</span> <span>roots</span>.<br/>
🎧 This will be a <span>musical</span> <span>event</span> where children will have the <span>chance</span> to play <span>steel</span> <span>drums</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is <span>bound</span> to be very <span>popular</span>, so please book as soon as <span>possible</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks <span>Jenny</span>. That all sounds really <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm just <span>wondering</span> if you have a <span>favourite</span> book you could <span>recommend</span> for our <span>readers</span>?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>hard</span> to choose, but <span>'Alive</span> and <span>Kicking'</span> is definitely <span>worth</span> <span>mentioning</span>.<br/>
🎧 You won't have heard of the <span>writer</span> as it's her first book <span>-</span> which is really <span>impressive</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>basically</span> the <span>teenage</span> <span>diary</span> of a boy from <span>Somalia</span> who comes to live in the <span>UK</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>deals</span> with the serious issue of <span>immigration<br/></span>
🎧 and all the <span>challenges</span> the boy has to <span>face</span> at school and with the <span>language</span> <span>barrier</span>, <span>etc</span>.<br/>
🎧 Usually, books like this are quite sad,<br/>
🎧 but this one actually made me cry with <span>laughter</span>.<br/>
🎧 On each <span>page</span>, there are simple but <span>hilarious</span> <span>black</span> and <span>white</span> <span>stick</span> <span>drawings</span> of the boy with his friends and <span>teachers</span>.<br/>
🎧 At the end of each <span>diary</span> <span>entry</span>, there are new English <span>words</span> the boy <span>learns</span> each day,<br/>
🎧 which may help <span>develop</span> some <span>children's</span> <span>vocabulary</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think my <span>kids</span> would enjoy that.<br/>
🎧 What about any advice for <span>parents</span> on how to <span>encourage</span> their children to read more?<br/>
🎧 Well, this is something I get <span>asked</span> about a lot.<br/>
🎧 There are so many <span>distractions</span> for <span>kids</span> these <span>days</span> that it can be <span>hard</span> to find time for <span>reading</span>.<br/>
🎧 One thing I'd say is to make time to sit down with your <span>child</span> and share books with them.<br/>
🎧 A lot of <span>parents</span> give up <span>reading</span> <span>aloud</span> to their children as soon as they learn to read <span>independently</span>,<br/>
🎧 but this is a <span>mistake</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's good to read more <span>advanced</span> books to them as it helps to <span>develop</span> their <span>vocabulary</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you don't have time for this, then let them listen to <span>audio</span> books.<br/>
🎧 Often, they'll want to read books <span>they've</span> <span>listened</span> to for <span>themselves</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think it's a good idea to make a <span>mental</span> <span>note</span> of the <span>type</span> of books your <span>child</span> is <span>reading</span>.<br/>
🎧 Often, they just read the same <span>genre</span> all the time, which can get a bit <span>boring</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can <span>introduce</span> new <span>authors</span> and <span>genres</span> to them.<br/>
🎧 <span>Librarians</span> should be able to help you with this.<br/>
🎧 Well <span>Jenny</span>, I <span>think..</span>.<br/>

🎧 Hi <span>Jake</span>.<br/>
🎧 How are you getting on with the <span>practical</span> <span>teaching</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Ah..</span>. it's <span>harder</span> than I <span>expected</span>, but I've got some great <span>classes</span>.<br/>
🎧 How about you?<br/>
🎧 Not <span>brilliant</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm really <span>struggling</span> with my Year <span>12</span> <span>science</span> class.<br/>
🎧 Are they <span>hard</span> to <span>control</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I don't have <span>discipline</span> <span>problems</span> as such.<br/>
🎧 It's just that they don't <span>seem</span> to think that <span>science</span> has anything to do with their lives.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>depressing</span>.<br/>
🎧 They listen to what I say,<br/>
🎧 and I gave them a <span>test</span> last week and the <span>results</span> weren't too bad,<br/>
🎧 but there's no <span>real</span> <span>engagement</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And as <span>part</span> of my <span>teaching</span> practice, I have to <span>design</span> an <span>experiment</span> for them to do.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>wondering</span> about something on the <span>children's</span> <span>diets..</span>.<br/>
🎧 You know, <span>asking</span> them to <span>record</span> what they eat and maybe <span>linking</span> it to their <span>state</span> of <span>health</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mmm</span>. Let's think.<br/>
🎧 So your <span>methodology</span> would <span>involve</span> the children <span>recording</span> what they eat.<br/>
🎧 Okay, but you'd also need to have <span>access</span> to the <span>children's</span> <span>medical</span> <span>records<br/></span>
🎧 and I don't think people would be happy about <span>that;<br/></span>
🎧 <span>confidentiality</span> would be an issue.<br/>
🎧 If you could get the right <span>data</span>, the <span>conclusions</span> might be <span>significant</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I <span>suspect</span> it's not going to be easy.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Have you thought about doing an <span>experiment</span> <span>using</span> <span>animals</span>?<br/>
🎧 Wouldn't that be <span>upsetting</span> for the children?<br/>
🎧 Well, the <span>animals</span> don't have to be <span>harmed</span> in any way.<br/>
🎧 It could just be an <span>experiment</span> where they're <span>given</span> a <span>certain</span> <span>diet</span> and the <span>effects</span> are <span>observed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Would I have to get <span>permission</span> to use <span>animals</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, you'd have to <span>submit</span> an <span>outline</span> of the <span>experiment</span> and <span>fill</span> in a <span>form</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it's quite <span>straightforward</span>.<br/>
🎧 But if we <span>found</span> out that, say, a <span>particular</span> <span>diet</span> <span>affects</span> the <span>health</span> of <span>animals</span>,<br/>
🎧 the same thing wouldn't <span>necessarily</span> be <span>true</span> for people, would it?<br/>
🎧 No, that's <span>true</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>findings</span> for any <span>experiment</span> are going to be <span>limited</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>inevitable</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> so.<br/>
🎧 So what <span>animals</span> could I use to <span>investigate</span> the <span>effects</span> of <span>diet</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Mice</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 You'd need <span>experimental</span> <span>mice</span> <span>-</span> <span>ones</span> that have been <span>specially</span> <span>bred</span> for <span>experiments</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, so what will your <span>experiment</span> be <span>investigating</span> exactly?<br/>
🎧 Well, something to do with <span>nutrition</span>.<br/>
🎧 So maybe we could look at food <span>supplements..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Things like <span>extra</span> <span>iron</span> and <span>extra</span> <span>protein</span>, and their <span>impact</span> on <span>health</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mmm</span>. That might be rather <span>broad</span>.<br/>
🎧 Maybe just look at the <span>effects</span> of one <span>supplement</span>, like <span>sugar</span>, on the <span>health</span> of the <span>mice</span>?<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, maybe the focus could be on <span>whether</span> <span>mice</span> can <span>control</span> their own <span>diet</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, what <span>happens</span> when they have <span>access</span> to more <span>sugar</span> that they don't really need?<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 Do they eat it or do they decide to leave it?<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 Then later on, you could do a <span>follow-up</span> <span>experiment</span> <span>adding</span> another <span>variable</span>.<br/>
🎧 Like, you could give some of the <span>mice</span> the <span>chance</span> to be more <span>active</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>running</span> on a <span>wheel</span> or something,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>others</span> just sit around and don't do much.<br/>
🎧 Or I could <span>repeat</span> the <span>experiment</span> but change the <span>type</span> of food I <span>provided..</span>.<br/>
🎧 or use <span>mice</span> with a different <span>genetic</span> <span>structure</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I think your idea would be more <span>interesting</span>,<br/>
🎧 I might think about that some more.<br/>
🎧 So can I talk through a <span>possible</span> <span>procedure</span> for the <span>experiment</span> where <span>mice</span> are <span>given</span> a <span>sugar</span> <span>supplement</span>?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 I did a <span>similar</span> <span>experiment</span> in <span>college</span> actually.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 So how many <span>mice</span> would I need?<br/>
🎧 I'd say about <span>12</span>.<br/>
🎧 And all young <span>ones</span>, not a <span>mixture</span> of old and young.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 And I'd need two <span>groups</span> of <span>equal</span> <span>sizes</span>, so six in each group.<br/>
🎧 And how would I tell them <span>apart</span>?<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> I could put some <span>sort</span> of tag on one <span>group..</span>. or just <span>mark</span> them in some way?<br/>
🎧 You could use food <span>colouring</span>, that wouldn't <span>hurt</span> them.<br/>
🎧 Perfect.<br/>
🎧 Then each group would go into a <span>separate</span> <span>cage</span>,<br/>
🎧 and one group, let's call them group A, would be the <span>control</span> group.<br/>
🎧 So they'd just have <span>ordinary</span> <span>mouse</span> food.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> you can buy that?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it comes in dry <span>pellets</span>.<br/>
🎧 And the other group would have the same as the first group,<br/>
🎧 but they'd also have the <span>extra</span> <span>sugar</span>.<br/>
🎧 Would you just give them <span>straight</span> <span>sugar</span>?<br/>
🎧 It might be better to give them something like <span>cereal</span> with it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mmm</span>. Then you'd need to <span>weigh</span> the <span>mice</span>, I should think once a week.<br/>
🎧 And you'd need an <span>electronic</span> <span>balance</span>.<br/>
🎧 But we can't <span>hold</span> them on the <span>balance</span>, or it'd <span>affect</span> the <span>reading</span>.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 So you need something called a <span>weighing</span> <span>chamber</span> to <span>stop</span> the <span>mice</span> from <span>running</span> away.<br/>
🎧 It sounds <span>complicated</span>, but actually you can just use a <span>plastic</span> box with <span>holes</span> in the top.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 So once we've <span>measured</span> the <span>weight</span> <span>gain</span> of each <span>mouse<br/></span>
🎧 we can work out the <span>average</span> for each group, as well as the <span>standard</span> <span>deviation</span>.<br/>
🎧 And then see where we go from there.<br/>
🎧 That sounds <span>cool</span>!<br/>
🎧 I think the students will enjoy it.<br/>
🎧 Yes. One <span>thing..</span>.<br/>

🎧 In <span>today's</span> <span>lecture</span>, I'm going to be talking about <span>microplastics</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Microplastics</span> are <span>tiny</span> <span>pieces</span> of <span>plastic</span> <span>smaller</span> than <span>five</span> <span>millimetres</span> in size.<br/>
🎧 <span>Recently</span>, there's been a <span>greater</span> <span>awareness</span> that there are large <span>quantities</span> of <span>plastic</span> <span>waste</span> <span>-</span> big and small <span>-</span> in the <span>environment</span>.<br/>
🎧 The amount of <span>plastic</span> <span>waste</span> in the <span>oceans</span> has <span>received</span> <span>widespread</span> <span>attention</span>,<br/>
🎧 but <span>far</span> less is <span>known</span> about the <span>effects</span> of <span>microplastics</span> in <span>freshwater</span> and <span>particularly</span> in <span>soil</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Microplastics</span> can <span>enter</span> the <span>environment</span> <span>via</span> a number of different <span>sources</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Threads</span> and <span>microfibres</span> <span>detach</span> from <span>synthetic</span> <span>clothing</span> every time they're put in a <span>washing</span> <span>machine</span>,<br/>
🎧 and these find their way into the water <span>system</span>.<br/>
🎧 Other <span>sources</span> <span>include</span> big <span>pieces</span> of <span>plastic</span> <span>waste</span> that are already in the <span>environment</span>,<br/>
🎧 and these <span>break</span> down into <span>microscopic</span> <span>particles</span> over a <span>period</span> of time.<br/>
🎧 On a <span>larger</span> <span>scale</span>, <span>factory</span> <span>waste</span> is another <span>route</span>,<br/>
🎧 as are <span>tyres</span> which <span>wear</span> down as <span>cars</span>, <span>lorries</span> and so on travel along <span>road</span> <span>surfaces</span>.<br/>
🎧 We already <span>understand</span> some of the <span>impacts</span> of <span>microplastics</span> from <span>studies</span> <span>involving</span> <span>fish</span> and other <span>animals</span>.<br/>
🎧 There is <span>evidence</span> that <span>microplastics</span> <span>harm</span> small <span>creatures</span> in a <span>variety</span> of <span>ways</span>,<br/>
🎧 such as by <span>damaging</span> their <span>mouths</span>,<br/>
🎧 or by <span>impairing</span> their <span>ability</span> to <span>feed</span>,<br/>
🎧 for example, when <span>microplastics</span> get <span>lodged</span> in their <span>digestive</span> <span>system</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Surprisingly</span> <span>perhaps</span>, it is <span>likely</span> that <span>humans</span> <span>consume</span> <span>microplastics</span>,<br/>
🎧 as these have been <span>detected</span> in a <span>wide</span> <span>range</span> of food and drink <span>products</span>, <span>including</span> <span>bottled</span> water,<br/>
🎧 as well as in water that comes <span>direct</span> from the tap.<br/>
🎧 What's more, <span>salt</span> and many <span>kinds</span> of <span>seafood</span> have also been <span>found</span> to <span>contain</span> <span>microplastics</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, it's important to <span>underline</span> that there is not yet <span>conclusive</span> <span>proof<br/></span>
🎧 that <span>microplastics</span> <span>cause</span> <span>significant</span> <span>harm</span> to people.<br/>
🎧 In many <span>countries</span>, <span>including</span> here in the <span>UK</span>,<br/>
🎧 there is <span>legislation</span> which <span>prevents</span> <span>manufacturers</span> from <span>adding</span> <span>plastic</span> <span>microbeads</span> to <span>shower</span> <span>gels</span>, <span>facial</span> <span>cleansers</span> and <span>toothpaste</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is very <span>difficult</span> to <span>accurately</span> <span>estimate</span> the <span>total</span> amount of <span>microplastic</span> <span>particles</span> in the <span>soil<br/></span>
🎧 as they can be <span>hard</span> to <span>detect</span>,<br/>
🎧 but we do know they are <span>carried</span> in the air and <span>deposited</span> in the <span>soil</span> by <span>rain</span>.<br/>
🎧 What's more, many of the <span>fertilisers</span> used by both <span>farmers</span> and <span>gardeners</span> <span>contain</span> <span>microplastics</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>team</span> from the <span>Anglia</span> <span>Ruskin</span> University in <span>Cambridge<br/></span>
🎧 has <span>carried</span> out a <span>study</span> of the <span>effects</span> of <span>microplastics</span> on the <span>digestive</span> <span>tracts</span> of <span>earthworms</span>.<br/>
🎧 These <span>worms</span>, which live in <span>topsoil</span>, are an <span>essential</span> <span>component</span> of our <span>agricultural</span> <span>system</span>.<br/>
🎧 By <span>feeding</span> on <span>soil</span>, they mix <span>nutrients</span> into it, <span>thereby</span> <span>making</span> it more <span>fertile</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>researchers</span> set out to <span>discover</span> <span>whether</span> the <span>introduction</span> of <span>microplastics</span> into the <span>soil</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>subsequent</span> <span>ingestion</span> of these by <span>earthworms</span>,<br/>
🎧 would <span>impact</span> <span>soil</span> <span>quality</span> and <span>ultimately</span> <span>inhibit</span> <span>plant</span> <span>growth</span>.<br/>
🎧 The short answer was, yes, it did.<br/>
🎧 After <span>placing</span> <span>three</span> different <span>types</span> of <span>microplastic</span> <span>particles</span> into the <span>soil</span>,<br/>
🎧 they <span>planted</span> <span>perennial</span> <span>rye</span> <span>grass</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>particles</span> of <span>microplastic</span>, which <span>included</span> <span>biodegradable</span> <span>PLA</span> and <span>conventional</span> <span>high-density</span> <span>polyethylene</span>, or <span>HDPE</span>,<br/>
🎧 were then <span>ingested</span> by the <span>earthworms</span> in the <span>soil</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>result</span> was that the <span>worms</span> <span>lost</span> <span>weight</span> <span>rapidly</span>.<br/>
🎧 What's more, a <span>lower</span> <span>percentage</span> than <span>normal</span> of the <span>rye</span> <span>grass</span> <span>seeds</span> <span>germinated</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>researchers</span> <span>concluded<br/></span>
🎧 that this was a <span>direct</span> <span>result</span> of the <span>earthworms</span> being <span>unable</span> to <span>fulfil</span> their <span>normal</span> <span>role</span> in <span>making</span> <span>soil</span> more <span>fertile</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>team</span> also <span>discovered</span> that there was an <span>increase</span> in the amount of <span>acid</span> <span>found</span> in the <span>soil</span>,<br/>
🎧 and this was <span>attributed</span> <span>mainly</span> to the <span>microplastic</span> <span>particles</span> from <span>conventional</span> <span>HDPE</span> <span>plastic</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>conclusions</span> of the <span>study</span> make for very <span>interesting</span> <span>reading</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've <span>included</span> the <span>reference</span> in the <span>notes</span> to give you at the end of this <span>session</span>.<br/>
🎧 To <span>summarise</span>, the <span>authors</span> <span>proposed</span> the idea that we need to <span>regard</span> <span>soil</span> as we would <span>regard</span> any other <span>process</span> in <span>nature</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>means</span> we should <span>accept</span> the <span>implications</span> of <span>soil</span> being <span>dependent</span> on <span>decaying</span> and <span>dead</span> <span>matter<br/></span>
🎧 <span>constantly</span> being <span>passed</span> through the <span>bodies</span> of <span>earthworms</span>.<br/>
🎧 That is, when <span>soil</span> <span>becomes</span> <span>impoverished</span> by the <span>presence</span> of <span>microplastics</span>,<br/>
🎧 not only <span>ecosystems</span> but also the whole of <span>society</span> are <span>negatively</span> <span>impacted</span>.<br/>
