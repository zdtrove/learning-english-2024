🎧 Hi Shannon</span>, how are you settling</span> into your new flat</span>?<br/>
🎧 Really well, thanks.<br/>
🎧 You look like you're going shopping</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I am.<br/>
🎧 My cousins</span> are coming</span> to stay</span> for a couple</span> of days</span>, and I have to cook</span> for them.<br/>
🎧 Well, there are plenty</span> of places</span> to buy food in Kite</span> Place,<br/>
🎧 it's the area</span> by the harbour</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, okay, I'll find that on the map.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 What sort</span> of food do you need to get?<br/>
🎧 Well, neither</span> of them eats</span> meat</span> but they both like fish</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, there's a really good fish</span> market</span> there.<br/>
🎧 Oh great!<br/>
🎧 Where is it exactly?<br/>
🎧 It's at the far</span> end of Kite</span> Place,<br/>
🎧 so you have to go over the bridge</span> and then it's on the right.<br/>
🎧 Okay, is it open all day?<br/>
🎧 It doesn't close</span> until four</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I'd recommend</span> going earlier</span> than that,<br/>
🎧 it does run out of some things.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I don't want that to happen</span>.<br/>
🎧 As long as you get there by 3:30</span>, you should be fine.<br/>
🎧 It's only 11</span> now, so plenty</span> of time.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Do you need to buy vegetables</span> too?<br/>
🎧 I do, and I want to avoid</span> all the plastic</span> packaging</span> in the supermarket</span>!<br/>
🎧 Well, there's a really nice organic</span> shop</span> there.<br/>
🎧 Now what's it called..</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's the name of a flower</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know, it's 'Rose'</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's a nice name.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, it sells</span> vegetables</span> and quite a lot of other stuff</span>.<br/>
🎧 And where's that?<br/>
🎧 Well, as you reach</span> the market</span>,<br/>
🎧 you'll see a big grey</span> building</span> on your left</span>,<br/>
🎧 I think it used to be a warehouse</span>.<br/>
🎧 Anyway</span>, now it's a restaurant</span> upstairs</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the ground</span> floor</span> has two shops</span> either side of the entrance</span> and it's the one on the left</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's easy enough.<br/>
🎧 You can't miss</span> it,<br/>
🎧 there's also a big sign</span> on the pavement</span> so you can look for that.<br/>
🎧 Fine!<br/>
🎧 I guess</span> if I need anything else, I'll have to go to the supermarket</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, you should be able to get everything you need,<br/>
🎧 but there's a minibus</span> that goes</span> to the supermarket</span> if you need it.<br/>
🎧 It's purple</span> and the number is 289</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks, that's great.<br/>
🎧 So what do you need to get at the fish</span> market</span>?<br/>
🎧 The salmon</span> is always very good and the shellfish..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm going to make a curry</span>, I think,<br/>
🎧 and I need about 12</span> prawns</span> for that.<br/>
🎧 They'll have plenty</span> of those.<br/>
🎧 Have you ever tried</span> samphire</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, what's that?<br/>
🎧 It's a type</span> of seaweed</span>.<br/>
🎧 I just ask for a handful</span> and you fry</span> it in butter</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's delicious</span>!<br/>
🎧 Oh, I might try that,<br/>
🎧 how do you spell</span> it?<br/>
🎧 It's SAMPHIRE</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great! It's always good to try something different.<br/>
🎧 I'll see what beans</span> they have in the organic</span> shop<br/></span>
🎧 and I think I'll get something for dessert</span> there.<br/>
🎧 How about a mango</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm not sure, they're not always ripe</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd prefer</span> a melon</span>, it's bigger</span> too.<br/>
🎧 Good idea.<br/>
🎧 The owner</span> also sells</span> a lot of spices</span> there that you can put in a curry</span>,<br/>
🎧 and things like coconut</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's very helpful</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll have a look.<br/>
🎧 No problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know bread</span> doesn't really go with curry<br/></span>
🎧 but I always like to have some in case.<br/>
🎧 As I said, all the bread</span> is home-made</span> and there's lots of variety</span>.<br/>
🎧 I like the brown</span> bread</span> myself.<br/>
🎧 Mm</span>, sounds good.<br/>
🎧 They sell other things there too.<br/>
🎧 Like cakes</span>?<br/>
🎧 I love chocolate</span> cake</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, not that,<br/>
🎧 but they have a whole range</span> of tarts<br/></span>
🎧 and the best are the strawberry</span> ones</span>.<br/>
🎧 Perfect!<br/>
🎧 Hopefully</span> I won't even have to go to the supermarket</span>!<br/>

🎧 The children's</span> book festival</span> is coming</span> up again soon<br/></span>
🎧 and here to tell us all about it is the festival's</span> organiser</span>, Jenny</span> Morgan</span>.<br/>
🎧 So tell us what we can expect</span> this year, Jenny</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, as usual</span> we've got five</span> days</span> of action-packed</span> exciting</span> events</span> for children,<br/>
🎧 with writers</span> coming</span> from all over the country</span> getting involved</span>.<br/>
🎧 Just to give you an idea of what's on offer</span> in the workshops</span>,<br/>
🎧 first of all, there's a very special event</span> called Superheroes</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is a chance</span> for deaf</span> children to share their reading</span> experiences</span> with author</span> Madeleine</span> Gordon</span>,<br/>
🎧 who is herself</span> hearing</span> impaired</span>.<br/>
🎧 'Just</span> do it'</span> is a practical</span> workshop</span> led</span> by the well-known</span> illustrator</span> Mark</span> Keane</span>.<br/>
🎧 He'll take participants</span> on a magical</span> journey</span> to faraway</span> lands<br/></span>
🎧 with an opportunity</span> for aspiring</span> actors</span> to do some role</span> play.<br/>
🎧 'Count</span> on me'</span> is an inspiring</span> and entertaining</span> look at the issues of friendship</span> for 13</span> to 14-year-olds</span>.<br/>
🎧 It looks at some of the friendships</span> described</span> in popular</span> books<br/></span>
🎧 and asks</span> participants</span> to compare</span> these with their own experiences</span>.<br/>
🎧 'Speak</span> up'</span> is part</span> of a series</span> of workshops</span> on the subject</span> of mental</span> health</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is a creative</span> writing</span> workshop</span> encouraging</span> children to describe</span> situations<br/></span>
🎧 where young people experience</span> loneliness</span>.<br/>
🎧 A recent</span> survey</span> revealed</span> that children can be lonely<br/></span>
🎧 even when they're at home with their families</span>.<br/>
🎧 'Jump</span> for joy'</span>, as many of you will know,<br/>
🎧 is the heart-warming</span>, best-selling</span> story</span> by Nina</span> Karan<br/></span>
🎧 about a young girl's</span> trip</span> to visit her relatives</span> in India</span>.<br/>
🎧 It recently</span> received</span> the gold</span> medal</span> at the Waterford</span> Awards</span>.<br/>
🎧 Nina</span> will get children to celebrate</span> the word</span> 'joy'</span> by writing</span> a poem</span>.<br/>
🎧 'Sticks</span> and stones'</span> is the beautifully</span> illustrated</span> picture</span> book for young readers<br/></span>
🎧 about a community</span> who organise</span> an African-Caribbean</span> festival<br/></span>
🎧 to help local</span> children learn about their Jamaican</span> roots</span>.<br/>
🎧 This will be a musical</span> event</span> where children will have the chance</span> to play steel</span> drums</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is bound</span> to be very popular</span>, so please book as soon as possible</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks Jenny</span>. That all sounds really interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm just wondering</span> if you have a favourite</span> book you could recommend</span> for our readers</span>?<br/>
🎧 It's hard</span> to choose, but 'Alive</span> and Kicking'</span> is definitely worth</span> mentioning</span>.<br/>
🎧 You won't have heard of the writer</span> as it's her first book -</span> which is really impressive</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's basically</span> the teenage</span> diary</span> of a boy from Somalia</span> who comes to live in the UK</span>.<br/>
🎧 It deals</span> with the serious issue of immigration<br/></span>
🎧 and all the challenges</span> the boy has to face</span> at school and with the language</span> barrier</span>, etc</span>.<br/>
🎧 Usually, books like this are quite sad,<br/>
🎧 but this one actually made me cry with laughter</span>.<br/>
🎧 On each page</span>, there are simple but hilarious</span> black</span> and white</span> stick</span> drawings</span> of the boy with his friends and teachers</span>.<br/>
🎧 At the end of each diary</span> entry</span>, there are new English words</span> the boy learns</span> each day,<br/>
🎧 which may help develop</span> some children's</span> vocabulary</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think my kids</span> would enjoy that.<br/>
🎧 What about any advice for parents</span> on how to encourage</span> their children to read more?<br/>
🎧 Well, this is something I get asked</span> about a lot.<br/>
🎧 There are so many distractions</span> for kids</span> these days</span> that it can be hard</span> to find time for reading</span>.<br/>
🎧 One thing I'd say is to make time to sit down with your child</span> and share books with them.<br/>
🎧 A lot of parents</span> give up reading</span> aloud</span> to their children as soon as they learn to read independently</span>,<br/>
🎧 but this is a mistake</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's good to read more advanced</span> books to them as it helps to develop</span> their vocabulary</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you don't have time for this, then let them listen to audio</span> books.<br/>
🎧 Often, they'll want to read books they've</span> listened</span> to for themselves</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think it's a good idea to make a mental</span> note</span> of the type</span> of books your child</span> is reading</span>.<br/>
🎧 Often, they just read the same genre</span> all the time, which can get a bit boring</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can introduce</span> new authors</span> and genres</span> to them.<br/>
🎧 Librarians</span> should be able to help you with this.<br/>
🎧 Well Jenny</span>, I think..</span>.<br/>

🎧 Hi Jake</span>.<br/>
🎧 How are you getting on with the practical</span> teaching</span>?<br/>
🎧 Ah..</span>. it's harder</span> than I expected</span>, but I've got some great classes</span>.<br/>
🎧 How about you?<br/>
🎧 Not brilliant</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm really struggling</span> with my Year 12</span> science</span> class.<br/>
🎧 Are they hard</span> to control</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I don't have discipline</span> problems</span> as such.<br/>
🎧 It's just that they don't seem</span> to think that science</span> has anything to do with their lives.<br/>
🎧 It's depressing</span>.<br/>
🎧 They listen to what I say,<br/>
🎧 and I gave them a test</span> last week and the results</span> weren't too bad,<br/>
🎧 but there's no real</span> engagement</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And as part</span> of my teaching</span> practice, I have to design</span> an experiment</span> for them to do.<br/>
🎧 I was wondering</span> about something on the children's</span> diets..</span>.<br/>
🎧 You know, asking</span> them to record</span> what they eat and maybe linking</span> it to their state</span> of health</span>.<br/>
🎧 Mmm</span>. Let's think.<br/>
🎧 So your methodology</span> would involve</span> the children recording</span> what they eat.<br/>
🎧 Okay, but you'd also need to have access</span> to the children's</span> medical</span> records<br/></span>
🎧 and I don't think people would be happy about that;<br/></span>
🎧 confidentiality</span> would be an issue.<br/>
🎧 If you could get the right data</span>, the conclusions</span> might be significant</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I suspect</span> it's not going to be easy.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Have you thought about doing an experiment</span> using</span> animals</span>?<br/>
🎧 Wouldn't that be upsetting</span> for the children?<br/>
🎧 Well, the animals</span> don't have to be harmed</span> in any way.<br/>
🎧 It could just be an experiment</span> where they're given</span> a certain</span> diet</span> and the effects</span> are observed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Would I have to get permission</span> to use animals</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, you'd have to submit</span> an outline</span> of the experiment</span> and fill</span> in a form</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it's quite straightforward</span>.<br/>
🎧 But if we found</span> out that, say, a particular</span> diet</span> affects</span> the health</span> of animals</span>,<br/>
🎧 the same thing wouldn't necessarily</span> be true</span> for people, would it?<br/>
🎧 No, that's true</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the findings</span> for any experiment</span> are going to be limited</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's inevitable</span>.<br/>
🎧 I suppose</span> so.<br/>
🎧 So what animals</span> could I use to investigate</span> the effects</span> of diet</span>?<br/>
🎧 Mice</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 You'd need experimental</span> mice</span> -</span> ones</span> that have been specially</span> bred</span> for experiments</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, so what will your experiment</span> be investigating</span> exactly?<br/>
🎧 Well, something to do with nutrition</span>.<br/>
🎧 So maybe we could look at food supplements..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Things like extra</span> iron</span> and extra</span> protein</span>, and their impact</span> on health</span>.<br/>
🎧 Mmm</span>. That might be rather broad</span>.<br/>
🎧 Maybe just look at the effects</span> of one supplement</span>, like sugar</span>, on the health</span> of the mice</span>?<br/>
🎧 In fact</span>, maybe the focus could be on whether</span> mice</span> can control</span> their own diet</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, what happens</span> when they have access</span> to more sugar</span> that they don't really need?<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 Do they eat it or do they decide to leave it?<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 Then later on, you could do a follow-up</span> experiment</span> adding</span> another variable</span>.<br/>
🎧 Like, you could give some of the mice</span> the chance</span> to be more active</span>,<br/>
🎧 running</span> on a wheel</span> or something,<br/>
🎧 and the others</span> just sit around and don't do much.<br/>
🎧 Or I could repeat</span> the experiment</span> but change the type</span> of food I provided..</span>.<br/>
🎧 or use mice</span> with a different genetic</span> structure</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I think your idea would be more interesting</span>,<br/>
🎧 I might think about that some more.<br/>
🎧 So can I talk through a possible</span> procedure</span> for the experiment</span> where mice</span> are given</span> a sugar</span> supplement</span>?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 I did a similar</span> experiment</span> in college</span> actually.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 So how many mice</span> would I need?<br/>
🎧 I'd say about 12</span>.<br/>
🎧 And all young ones</span>, not a mixture</span> of old and young.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 And I'd need two groups</span> of equal</span> sizes</span>, so six in each group.<br/>
🎧 And how would I tell them apart</span>?<br/>
🎧 I suppose</span> I could put some sort</span> of tag on one group..</span>. or just mark</span> them in some way?<br/>
🎧 You could use food colouring</span>, that wouldn't hurt</span> them.<br/>
🎧 Perfect.<br/>
🎧 Then each group would go into a separate</span> cage</span>,<br/>
🎧 and one group, let's call them group A, would be the control</span> group.<br/>
🎧 So they'd just have ordinary</span> mouse</span> food.<br/>
🎧 I suppose</span> you can buy that?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it comes in dry pellets</span>.<br/>
🎧 And the other group would have the same as the first group,<br/>
🎧 but they'd also have the extra</span> sugar</span>.<br/>
🎧 Would you just give them straight</span> sugar</span>?<br/>
🎧 It might be better to give them something like cereal</span> with it.<br/>
🎧 Mmm</span>. Then you'd need to weigh</span> the mice</span>, I should think once a week.<br/>
🎧 And you'd need an electronic</span> balance</span>.<br/>
🎧 But we can't hold</span> them on the balance</span>, or it'd affect</span> the reading</span>.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 So you need something called a weighing</span> chamber</span> to stop</span> the mice</span> from running</span> away.<br/>
🎧 It sounds complicated</span>, but actually you can just use a plastic</span> box with holes</span> in the top.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 So once we've measured</span> the weight</span> gain</span> of each mouse<br/></span>
🎧 we can work out the average</span> for each group, as well as the standard</span> deviation</span>.<br/>
🎧 And then see where we go from there.<br/>
🎧 That sounds cool</span>!<br/>
🎧 I think the students will enjoy it.<br/>
🎧 Yes. One thing..</span>.<br/>

🎧 In today's</span> lecture</span>, I'm going to be talking about microplastics</span>.<br/>
🎧 Microplastics</span> are tiny</span> pieces</span> of plastic</span> smaller</span> than five</span> millimetres</span> in size.<br/>
🎧 Recently</span>, there's been a greater</span> awareness</span> that there are large quantities</span> of plastic</span> waste</span> -</span> big and small -</span> in the environment</span>.<br/>
🎧 The amount of plastic</span> waste</span> in the oceans</span> has received</span> widespread</span> attention</span>,<br/>
🎧 but far</span> less is known</span> about the effects</span> of microplastics</span> in freshwater</span> and particularly</span> in soil</span>.<br/>
🎧 Microplastics</span> can enter</span> the environment</span> via</span> a number of different sources</span>.<br/>
🎧 Threads</span> and microfibres</span> detach</span> from synthetic</span> clothing</span> every time they're put in a washing</span> machine</span>,<br/>
🎧 and these find their way into the water system</span>.<br/>
🎧 Other sources</span> include</span> big pieces</span> of plastic</span> waste</span> that are already in the environment</span>,<br/>
🎧 and these break</span> down into microscopic</span> particles</span> over a period</span> of time.<br/>
🎧 On a larger</span> scale</span>, factory</span> waste</span> is another route</span>,<br/>
🎧 as are tyres</span> which wear</span> down as cars</span>, lorries</span> and so on travel along road</span> surfaces</span>.<br/>
🎧 We already understand</span> some of the impacts</span> of microplastics</span> from studies</span> involving</span> fish</span> and other animals</span>.<br/>
🎧 There is evidence</span> that microplastics</span> harm</span> small creatures</span> in a variety</span> of ways</span>,<br/>
🎧 such as by damaging</span> their mouths</span>,<br/>
🎧 or by impairing</span> their ability</span> to feed</span>,<br/>
🎧 for example, when microplastics</span> get lodged</span> in their digestive</span> system</span>.<br/>
🎧 Surprisingly</span> perhaps</span>, it is likely</span> that humans</span> consume</span> microplastics</span>,<br/>
🎧 as these have been detected</span> in a wide</span> range</span> of food and drink products</span>, including</span> bottled</span> water,<br/>
🎧 as well as in water that comes direct</span> from the tap.<br/>
🎧 What's more, salt</span> and many kinds</span> of seafood</span> have also been found</span> to contain</span> microplastics</span>.<br/>
🎧 However</span>, it's important to underline</span> that there is not yet conclusive</span> proof<br/></span>
🎧 that microplastics</span> cause</span> significant</span> harm</span> to people.<br/>
🎧 In many countries</span>, including</span> here in the UK</span>,<br/>
🎧 there is legislation</span> which prevents</span> manufacturers</span> from adding</span> plastic</span> microbeads</span> to shower</span> gels</span>, facial</span> cleansers</span> and toothpaste</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is very difficult</span> to accurately</span> estimate</span> the total</span> amount of microplastic</span> particles</span> in the soil<br/></span>
🎧 as they can be hard</span> to detect</span>,<br/>
🎧 but we do know they are carried</span> in the air and deposited</span> in the soil</span> by rain</span>.<br/>
🎧 What's more, many of the fertilisers</span> used by both farmers</span> and gardeners</span> contain</span> microplastics</span>.<br/>
🎧 A team</span> from the Anglia</span> Ruskin</span> University in Cambridge<br/></span>
🎧 has carried</span> out a study</span> of the effects</span> of microplastics</span> on the digestive</span> tracts</span> of earthworms</span>.<br/>
🎧 These worms</span>, which live in topsoil</span>, are an essential</span> component</span> of our agricultural</span> system</span>.<br/>
🎧 By feeding</span> on soil</span>, they mix nutrients</span> into it, thereby</span> making</span> it more fertile</span>.<br/>
🎧 The researchers</span> set out to discover</span> whether</span> the introduction</span> of microplastics</span> into the soil</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the subsequent</span> ingestion</span> of these by earthworms</span>,<br/>
🎧 would impact</span> soil</span> quality</span> and ultimately</span> inhibit</span> plant</span> growth</span>.<br/>
🎧 The short answer was, yes, it did.<br/>
🎧 After placing</span> three</span> different types</span> of microplastic</span> particles</span> into the soil</span>,<br/>
🎧 they planted</span> perennial</span> rye</span> grass</span>.<br/>
🎧 The particles</span> of microplastic</span>, which included</span> biodegradable</span> PLA</span> and conventional</span> high-density</span> polyethylene</span>, or HDPE</span>,<br/>
🎧 were then ingested</span> by the earthworms</span> in the soil</span>.<br/>
🎧 The result</span> was that the worms</span> lost</span> weight</span> rapidly</span>.<br/>
🎧 What's more, a lower</span> percentage</span> than normal</span> of the rye</span> grass</span> seeds</span> germinated</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the researchers</span> concluded<br/></span>
🎧 that this was a direct</span> result</span> of the earthworms</span> being unable</span> to fulfil</span> their normal</span> role</span> in making</span> soil</span> more fertile</span>.<br/>
🎧 The team</span> also discovered</span> that there was an increase</span> in the amount of acid</span> found</span> in the soil</span>,<br/>
🎧 and this was attributed</span> mainly</span> to the microplastic</span> particles</span> from conventional</span> HDPE</span> plastic</span>.<br/>
🎧 The conclusions</span> of the study</span> make for very interesting</span> reading</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've included</span> the reference</span> in the notes</span> to give you at the end of this session</span>.<br/>
🎧 To summarise</span>, the authors</span> proposed</span> the idea that we need to regard</span> soil</span> as we would regard</span> any other process</span> in nature</span>.<br/>
🎧 This means</span> we should accept</span> the implications</span> of soil</span> being dependent</span> on decaying</span> and dead</span> matter<br/></span>
🎧 constantly</span> being passed</span> through the bodies</span> of earthworms</span>.<br/>
🎧 That is, when soil</span> becomes</span> impoverished</span> by the presence</span> of microplastics</span>,<br/>
🎧 not only ecosystems</span> but also the whole of society</span> are negatively</span> impacted</span>.<br/>
