🎧 Good morning. Can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Yes. I've just been <span>accepted</span> on a course at the <span>university<br/></span>
🎧 and I'd like to try and <span>arrange</span> <span>accommodation</span> in the <span>hall</span> of <span>residence</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, <span>certainly</span>.<br/>
🎧 Please sit down.<br/>
🎧 What I'll do is <span>fill</span> in a <span>form</span> with you to find out a little more about your <span>preferences</span> and so <span>forth</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 So, first of all, can I take your name?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>Anu</span> <span>Bhatt</span>.<br/>
🎧 Could you <span>spell</span> your name please?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 <span>ANU..</span>. <span>BHATT</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks, and could I ask your date of <span>birth</span>?<br/>
🎧 The <span>31st</span> <span>March</span>, <span>1972</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 And where are you from?<br/>
🎧 <span>India</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh right.<br/>
🎧 And <span>um..</span>. what will you be <span>studying</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm doing a course in <span>nursing</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, thank you.<br/>
🎧 And how long would you want to <span>stay</span> in <span>hall</span>, do you think?<br/>
🎧 Well, it'll take <span>three</span> <span>years<br/></span>
🎧 but I'd only like to <span>stay</span> in <span>hall</span> for two.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to think about living outside for the <span>third</span> year.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 And what did you have in <span>mind</span> for <span>catering</span>?<br/>
🎧 Do you want to <span>cook</span> for yourself or have all your <span>meals</span> <span>provided</span>, that's full <span>board</span>?<br/>
🎧 Is there something in between?<br/>
🎧 Yes. You can just have <span>evening</span> <span>meal</span> <span>provided</span>, which is <span>half</span> <span>board</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's what I'd <span>prefer</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, a lot of students <span>opt</span> for that.<br/>
🎧 Now, with that in <span>mind</span>, do you have any special <span>diet</span>, anything we should know about?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I don't take red <span>meat</span>.<br/>
🎧 No red <span>meat</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, thinking about the room <span>itself</span>, we have a number of options.<br/>
🎧 You can have a <span>single</span> <span>study</span> <span>bedroom</span> or you can have a <span>shared</span> one.<br/>
🎧 These are both what we call simple <span>rooms</span>.<br/>
🎧 The other <span>alternative</span> is to <span>opt</span> for a <span>single</span> <span>bedsit<br/></span>
🎧 which actually has more <span>space</span> and better <span>facilities</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's about <span>£20</span> a week <span>difference</span> between them.<br/>
🎧 Well, actually my <span>grant</span> is quite <span>generous</span> and I think the <span>bedsit</span> sounds the best option.<br/>
🎧 <span>Lovely</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll put you down for that and we'll see what <span>availability</span> is like.<br/>
🎧 Now can I ask some other personal <span>details</span> which we like to have on <span>record</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, of course.<br/>
🎧 I <span>wonder</span> if you could let us know what your <span>interests</span> are.<br/>
🎧 This might help us get a <span>closer</span> <span>match</span> for <span>placing</span> you in a <span>particular</span> <span>hall</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well. I love the <span>theatre</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And I enjoy <span>sports</span>, <span>particularly</span> <span>badminton</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ah, that's <span>worth</span> <span>knowing</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, what we <span>finish</span> with on the <span>form</span> is really a <span>list</span> from you of what your <span>priorities</span> are in <span>choosing</span> a <span>hall<br/></span>
🎧 and we'll do our best to take these into <span>account</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, the first thing is I'd <span>prefer</span> a <span>hall</span> where there are other <span>mature</span> students, if <span>possible</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, we do have <span>halls</span> which <span>tend</span> to <span>cater</span> for <span>slightly</span> <span>older</span> students.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ummm</span> and I'd <span>prefer</span> to be out of <span>town</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's actually very good for you because we <span>tend</span> to have more <span>vacancies</span> in <span>out-of-town</span> <span>halls</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Lucky</span>!<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Anything else?<br/>
🎧 Well, I would like somewhere with a <span>shared</span> <span>area</span>, a <span>TV</span> room for example, or something like that.<br/>
🎧 It's a good way to <span>socialise</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Certainly</span> is.<br/>
🎧 That's it.<br/>
🎧 Now, we just need a <span>contact</span> <span>telephone</span> number for you.<br/>
🎧 Sure, I'll just find it.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>667549</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great, so we'll be in <span>contact</span> with you as soon as <span>possible..</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Hello,<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>delighted</span> to <span>welcome</span> you to our <span>Wildlife</span> <span>Club</span>,<br/>
🎧 and very <span>pleased</span> that you're interested in the <span>countryside<br/></span>
🎧 and the <span>plants</span> and <span>creatures</span> of this <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think you'll be <span>surprised</span> at the <span>variety</span> we have here,<br/>
🎧 even though we're not <span>far</span> from <span>London</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll start by <span>telling</span> you about some of the <span>parks</span> and open <span>spaces</span> <span>nearby</span>.<br/>
🎧 One very <span>pleasant</span> place is <span>Halland</span> <span>Common</span>.<br/>
🎧 This has been <span>public</span> <span>land</span> for <span>hundreds</span> of years,<br/>
🎧 and what you'll find <span>interesting</span> is that the <span>River</span> <span>Ouse</span>, which <span>flows</span> into the sea <span>eighty</span> <span>kilometres</span> away,<br/>
🎧 has its <span>source</span> in the <span>common</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's an <span>information</span> <span>board</span> about the <span>plants</span> and <span>animals</span> you can see here,<br/>
🎧 and by the way, the <span>common</span> is <span>accessible</span> <span>24</span> hours a day.<br/>
🎧 Then there's <span>Holt</span> <span>Island</span>, which is <span>noted</span> for its great <span>range</span> of <span>trees</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>past</span> <span>willows</span> were <span>grown</span> here <span>commercially</span> for <span>basket-making</span>,<br/>
🎧 and this <span>ancient</span> <span>craft</span> has <span>recently</span> been <span>reintroduced</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>island</span> is only open to the <span>public</span> from <span>Friday</span> to <span>Sunday</span>,<br/>
🎧 because it's quite small,<br/>
🎧 and if there were people around every day, much of the <span>wildlife</span> would keep away.<br/>
🎧 From there it's just a short <span>walk</span> across the <span>bridge</span> to <span>Longfield</span> <span>Country</span> <span>Park</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Longfield</span> has a <span>modern</span> <span>replica</span> of a <span>farm</span> from over two <span>thousand</span> years ago.<br/>
🎧 <span>Children's</span> <span>activities</span> are often <span>arranged</span> there, like <span>bread-making</span> and <span>face-painting</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>park</span> is only open during <span>daylight</span> hours, so <span>bear</span> that in <span>mind</span> if you decide to go there.<br/>
🎧 <span>Longfield</span> <span>Park</span> has a <span>programme</span> of <span>activities</span> <span>throughout</span> the year,<br/>
🎧 and to give you a <span>sample</span>, this is what's <span>happening</span> in the next few <span>days</span>.<br/>
🎧 On <span>Monday</span> you can learn about <span>herbs</span>, and how <span>they've</span> been used over the <span>centuries</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll start with a <span>tour</span> of our <span>herb</span> garden,<br/>
🎧 <span>practise</span> the <span>technique</span> of <span>using</span> them as <span>colour</span> <span>dyes</span> for <span>cloth</span>,<br/>
🎧 and listen to an <span>illustrated</span> talk about their use in cooking and <span>medicine</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then on <span>Wednesday</span> you can join <span>local</span> <span>experts</span> to <span>discover</span> the <span>variety</span> of <span>insects</span> and <span>birds</span> that <span>appear</span> in the <span>evening</span>.<br/>
🎧 We keep to a small number of people in the group,<br/>
🎧 so if you want to go, you'll need to phone the <span>park</span> <span>ranger</span> a few <span>days</span> <span>ahead</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's a small <span>charge</span>, which you should pay when you <span>turn</span> up.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you're all <span>keen</span> to help with the <span>practical</span> <span>task</span> of looking after the <span>park</span>,<br/>
🎧 so on <span>Saturday</span> you can join a working <span>party</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll have a <span>choice</span> of all <span>sorts</span> of <span>activities</span>, from <span>planting</span> <span>hedges</span> to <span>picking</span> up <span>litter</span>,<br/>
🎧 so you'll be able to change from one to another when you feel like it.<br/>
🎧 The <span>rangers</span> will be <span>hard</span> at work all day,<br/>
🎧 but do come and join in, even for just a short while.<br/>
🎧 One thing, though, is to make sure you're <span>wearing</span> something that you don't <span>mind</span> getting <span>dirty</span> or <span>torn</span>.<br/>
🎧 And finally I'd like to tell you about our new <span>wildlife</span> <span>area</span>, <span>Hinchingbrooke</span> <span>Park</span>,<br/>
🎧 which will be <span>opened</span> to the <span>public</span> next month.<br/>
🎧 This <span>slide</span> doesn't really <span>indicate</span> how big it is,<br/>
🎧 but <span>anyway</span>, you can see the two <span>gates</span> into the <span>park</span>, and the <span>main</span> <span>paths</span>.<br/>
🎧 As you can see, there's a <span>lake</span> in the <span>north</span> <span>west</span> of the <span>park</span>,<br/>
🎧 with a <span>bird</span> <span>hide</span> to the <span>west</span> of it, at the end of a <span>path</span>.<br/>
🎧 So it'll be a nice <span>quiet</span> place for watching the <span>birds</span> on the <span>lake</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Fairly</span> <span>close</span> to where <span>refreshments</span> are <span>available</span>,<br/>
🎧 there's a <span>dog-walking</span> <span>area</span> in the <span>southern</span> <span>part</span> of the <span>park</span>, <span>leading</span> off from the <span>path</span>.<br/>
🎧 And if you just want to sit and <span>relax</span>, you can go to the <span>flower</span> <span>garden;<br/></span>
🎧 that's the <span>circular</span> <span>area</span> on the map <span>surrounded</span> by <span>paths</span>.<br/>
🎧 And finally, there's a <span>wooded</span> <span>area</span> in the <span>western</span> <span>section</span> of the <span>park</span>, between two <span>paths</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, that's enough from me, so <span>let's..</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Hi <span>Jun</span>.<br/>
🎧 As you know, I've <span>asked</span> you here today to <span>discuss</span> the future of our <span>Self-Access</span> <span>Centre</span>.<br/>
🎧 We have to decide what we want to do about this very important <span>resource</span> for our English <span>language</span> students.<br/>
🎧 So, can you tell me what the students think about this?<br/>
🎧 Well, from the <span>students'</span> <span>point</span> of <span>view</span>, we would like to keep it.<br/>
🎧 The <span>majority</span> of students say that they enjoy <span>using</span> <span>it<br/></span>
🎧 because it <span>provides</span> a <span>variation</span> on the <span>classroom</span> <span>routine<br/></span>
🎧 and they see it as a <span>pretty</span> <span>major</span> <span>component</span> of their course,<br/>
🎧 but we would like to see some <span>improvements</span> to the <span>equipment</span>, <span>particularly</span> the <span>computers;<br/></span>
🎧 there aren't enough for one each at the <span>moment</span> and we always have to share.<br/>
🎧 Well, yes, the <span>teachers</span> agree that it is a very <span>valuable</span> <span>resource<br/></span>
🎧 but one thing we have <span>noticed</span> is that a lot of the students are <span>using</span> it to check their personal <span>emails</span>.<br/>
🎧 We don't want to <span>stop</span> you students <span>using</span> it,<br/>
🎧 but we think the <span>computers</span> should be used as a <span>learning</span> <span>resource</span>, not for <span>emails</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some of us also think that we could <span>benefit</span> a lot more by <span>relocating</span> the <span>Self-Access</span> <span>Centre<br/></span>
🎧 to the <span>main</span> University <span>library</span> <span>building</span>.<br/>
🎧 How do you think the students would feel about that, <span>Jun</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, the <span>library</span> is big enough to <span>incorporate</span> the <span>Self-Access</span> <span>Centre</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it wouldn't be like a class <span>activity</span> <span>anymore</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>main</span> <span>worry</span> would be not being able to go to a <span>teacher</span> for advice.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure there would be <span>plenty</span> of things to <span>do<br/></span>
🎧 but we really need <span>teachers</span> to help us choose the best <span>activities</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, there would still be a <span>teacher</span> <span>present</span> and he or she would <span>guide</span> the <span>activities</span> of the students,<br/>
🎧 we wouldn't just leave them to get on with it.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but I think the students would be much <span>happier</span> <span>keeping</span> the <span>existing</span> <span>set-up;<br/></span>
🎧 they really like going to the <span>Self-Access</span> <span>Centre</span> with their <span>teacher<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>staying</span> together as a group to do <span>activities</span>.<br/>
🎧 If we could just <span>improve</span> the <span>resources</span> and <span>facilities</span>, I think it would be fine.<br/>
🎧 Is the <span>cost</span> going to be a <span>problem</span>?<br/>
🎧 It's not so much the <span>expense</span> that I'm <span>worried</span> about,<br/>
🎧 and we've <span>certainly</span> got room to do it,<br/>
🎧 but it's the <span>problem</span> of <span>timetabling</span> a <span>teacher</span> to be in there outside class hours.<br/>
🎧 If we're going to <span>spend</span> a lot of money on <span>equipment</span> and <span>resources</span>,<br/>
🎧 we really need to make sure that everything is <span>looked</span> after <span>properly</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, let's make some <span>notes</span> to see just what needs doing to <span>improve</span> the <span>Centre</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, what about the <span>computers</span>?<br/>
🎧 I think it might be a good idea to <span>install</span> some new <span>models</span>.<br/>
🎧 They would take up a lot less <span>room<br/></span>
🎧 and so that would <span>increase</span> the work <span>space</span> for <span>text</span> books and so on.<br/>
🎧 That would be great.<br/>
🎧 It is a bit <span>cramped</span> in there at <span>times</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about other <span>resources</span>?<br/>
🎧 Do you have a <span>list</span> of things that the students would like to see <span>improved</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, one of the <span>comments</span> that students <span>frequently</span> <span>make<br/></span>
🎧 is that they find it <span>difficult</span> to find <span>materials</span> that are <span>appropriate</span> for their <span>level</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>especially</span> <span>reading</span> <span>resources</span>,<br/>
🎧 so I think we need to <span>label</span> them more <span>clearly</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's easy enough, we can get that <span>organised</span> very quickly.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, I think we should <span>review</span> all of the <span>study</span> <span>resources</span> as some of them are looking a bit <span>out-of-date</span>.<br/>
🎧 Definitely.<br/>
🎧 The <span>CD</span> <span>section</span> <span>especially</span> needs to be more <span>current</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think we should get some of the <span>ones</span> that go with our <span>latest</span> course <span>books<br/></span>
🎧 and also make <span>multiple</span> <span>copies</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 Now, I was also thinking about some different <span>materials</span> that we haven't got in there at all.<br/>
🎧 What do you think of the idea of <span>introducing</span> some <span>workbooks</span>?<br/>
🎧 If we <span>break</span> them up into <span>separate</span> <span>pages</span> and <span>laminate</span> them,<br/>
🎧 they'd be a great <span>resource</span>.<br/>
🎧 The students could <span>study</span> the <span>main</span> course book in <span>class<br/></span>
🎧 and then do <span>follow-up</span> practice in the <span>Self-Access</span> <span>Centre</span>.<br/>
🎧 That sounds good.<br/>
🎧 Okay, now, finally we need to think about how the room is used.<br/>
🎧 I'll have to talk to the <span>teachers<br/></span>
🎧 and make sure we can all <span>reach</span> some <span>agreement</span> on a <span>timetable</span> to <span>supervise</span> the <span>centre</span> after class.<br/>
🎧 But we also need to think about <span>security</span>, too.<br/>
🎧 <span>Especially</span> if we're going to <span>invest</span> in some new <span>equipment</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Umm..</span>. what about <span>putting</span> in an <span>alarm</span>?<br/>
🎧 Good idea.<br/>
🎧 The other thing I'd like to do is talk to our <span>technicians<br/></span>
🎧 and see <span>whether</span> we could <span>somehow</span> <span>limit</span> the <span>access</span> to <span>email</span>.<br/>
🎧 I really don't want to see that <span>resource</span> <span>misused</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about if we agree to only use it before and after class?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that would be fine.<br/>
🎧 OK, <span>anyway...that's</span> great for now.<br/>
🎧 We'll <span>discuss</span> it <span>further</span> when we've <span>managed..</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Good morning everyone.<br/>
🎧 Now <span>whether</span> you're going to university to <span>study</span> <span>business</span> or some other <span>subject</span>,<br/>
🎧 many of you will <span>eventually</span> end up working for a company of some kind.<br/>
🎧 Now, when you first start working somewhere you will <span>realise</span> that the <span>organisation</span> you've <span>joined</span> has <span>certain</span> <span>characteristics</span>.<br/>
🎧 And we often <span>refer</span> to these <span>social</span> <span>characteristics</span> as the <span>culture</span> of the <span>organisation</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>includes</span> its <span>unwritten</span> <span>ideas</span>, <span>beliefs</span>, <span>values</span> and things like that.<br/>
🎧 One well <span>known</span> <span>writer</span> has <span>classified</span> company <span>cultures</span> by <span>identifying</span> <span>four</span> <span>major</span> <span>types</span>.<br/>
🎧 The first <span>type</span> is called the <span>Power</span> <span>Culture</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it's usually <span>found</span> in small <span>organisations</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's the <span>type</span> of <span>culture</span> that needs a <span>central</span> <span>source</span> of <span>power</span> to be <span>effective</span>,<br/>
🎧 and because <span>control</span> is in the <span>hands</span> of just one or two people,<br/>
🎧 there aren't many <span>rules</span> or <span>procedures</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>characteristic</span> is that <span>communication</span> usually takes the <span>form</span> of <span>conversations<br/></span>
🎧 rather than, say, <span>formal</span> <span>meetings</span> or <span>written</span> <span>memos</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now one of the <span>benefits</span> of this <span>culture</span> is that the <span>organisation</span> has the <span>ability</span> to act quickly,<br/>
🎧 so it <span>responds</span> well to <span>threat</span>, or <span>danger</span> on the one <span>hand</span>, and <span>opportunity</span> on the other.<br/>
🎧 But on the <span>negative</span> side, this <span>type</span> of <span>organisation</span> doesn't always act <span>effectively</span>,<br/>
🎧 because it <span>depends</span> too much on one or two people at the top,<br/>
🎧 and when these people make <span>poor</span> <span>decisions</span>, there's <span>no-one</span> else who can <span>influence</span> them.<br/>
🎧 And the kind of person who does well in this <span>type</span> of <span>business</span> <span>culture</span> is one who is happy to take <span>risks</span>,<br/>
🎧 and for whom <span>job</span> <span>security</span> is a low <span>priority</span>.<br/>
🎧 The next <span>type</span> is <span>known</span> as <span>Role</span> <span>Culture</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 that's <span>ROLE</span>, not <span>ROLL</span>, by the way,<br/>
🎧 and this <span>type</span> is usually <span>found</span> in large <span>companies</span>,<br/>
🎧 which have lots of different <span>levels</span> in them.<br/>
🎧 These <span>organisations</span> usually have <span>separate</span> <span>departments<br/></span>
🎧 that <span>specialise</span> in things like <span>finance</span>, or <span>sales</span>, or <span>maintenance</span>, or whatever.<br/>
🎧 Each one is <span>co-ordinated</span> at the top by a small group of <span>senior</span> <span>managers</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>typically</span> <span>everyone's</span> <span>job</span> is <span>controlled</span> by <span>sets</span> of <span>rules</span> and <span>procedures</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, there are <span>specific</span> <span>job</span> <span>descriptions</span>, <span>rules</span> for <span>discipline</span>, and so on.<br/>
🎧 What are the <span>benefits</span> of this kind of <span>culture</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well <span>firstly</span>, because it's <span>found</span> in large <span>organisations</span>,<br/>
🎧 its <span>fixed</span> <span>costs</span>, or <span>overheads</span> as they're <span>known</span>, are low in <span>relation</span> to its <span>output</span>, or what it <span>produces</span>.<br/>
🎧 In other <span>words</span> it can <span>achieve</span> <span>economies</span> of <span>scale</span>.<br/>
🎧 And <span>secondly</span>, it is <span>particularly</span> <span>successful</span> in <span>business</span> <span>markets</span> where <span>technical</span> <span>expertise</span> is important.<br/>
🎧 On the other <span>hand</span>, this <span>culture</span> is often very <span>slow</span> to <span>recognise</span> the need for change,<br/>
🎧 and even <span>slower</span> to <span>react</span>.<br/>
🎧 What kind of person does this <span>type</span> of <span>culture</span> <span>suit</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, it <span>suits</span> <span>employees</span> who <span>value</span> <span>security</span>,<br/>
🎧 and who don't <span>particularly</span> want to have <span>responsibility</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Moving</span> on now to <span>Task</span> <span>Cultures</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>type</span> is <span>found</span> in <span>organisations</span> that are <span>project-oriented</span>.<br/>
🎧 You usually find it where the <span>market</span> for the <span>company's</span> product is <span>extremely</span> <span>competitive</span>,<br/>
🎧 or where the <span>products</span> <span>themselves</span> have a short <span>life-span</span>.<br/>
🎧 Usually top <span>management</span> <span>delegates</span> the <span>projects</span>, the people and other <span>resources</span>.<br/>
🎧 And once these have been <span>allocated</span>, little <span>day-to-day</span> <span>control</span> is <span>exercised</span> from the top,<br/>
🎧 because this would <span>seem</span> like <span>breaking</span> the <span>rules'</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now one of the <span>major</span> <span>benefits</span> of this <span>culture</span> is that it's <span>flexible</span>.<br/>
🎧 But it does have some <span>major</span> <span>disadvantages</span> too.<br/>
🎧 For <span>instance</span>, it can't <span>produce</span> <span>economies</span> of <span>scale</span> or great <span>depth</span> of <span>expertise</span>.<br/>
🎧 People who like working in <span>groups</span> or <span>teams</span> <span>prefer</span> this <span>type</span> of <span>culture</span>.<br/>
🎧 And finally, the <span>fourth</span> <span>category</span> is called the Person <span>Culture..</span>.<br/>
