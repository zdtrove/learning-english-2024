🎧 Good morning. Can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Yes. I've just been accepted on a course at the university<br/>
🎧 and I'd like to try and arrange accommodation in the hall of residence.<br/>
🎧 Yes, certainly.<br/>
🎧 Please sit down.<br/>
🎧 What I'll do is fill in a form with you to find out a little more about your preferences and so forth.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 So, first of all, can I take your name?<br/>
🎧 It's Anu Bhatt.<br/>
🎧 Could you spell your name please?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 ANU... BHATT.<br/>
🎧 Thanks, and could I ask your date of birth?<br/>
🎧 The 31st March, 1972.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 And where are you from?<br/>
🎧 India.<br/>
🎧 Oh right.<br/>
🎧 And um... what will you be studying?<br/>
🎧 I'm doing a course in nursing.<br/>
🎧 Right, thank you.<br/>
🎧 And how long would you want to stay in hall, do you think?<br/>
🎧 Well, it'll take three years<br/>
🎧 but I'd only like to stay in hall for two.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to think about living outside for the third year.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 And what did you have in mind for catering?<br/>
🎧 Do you want to cook for yourself or have all your meals provided, that's full board?<br/>
🎧 Is there something in between?<br/>
🎧 Yes. You can just have evening meal provided, which is half board.<br/>
🎧 That's what I'd prefer.<br/>
🎧 Yes, a lot of students opt for that.<br/>
🎧 Now, with that in mind, do you have any special diet, anything we should know about?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I don't take red meat.<br/>
🎧 No red meat.<br/>
🎧 Now, thinking about the room itself, we have a number of options.<br/>
🎧 You can have a single study bedroom or you can have a shared one.<br/>
🎧 These are both what we call simple rooms.<br/>
🎧 The other alternative is to opt for a single bedsit<br/>
🎧 which actually has more space and better facilities.<br/>
🎧 There's about £20 a week difference between them.<br/>
🎧 Well, actually my grant is quite generous and I think the bedsit sounds the best option.<br/>
🎧 Lovely.<br/>
🎧 I'll put you down for that and we'll see what availability is like.<br/>
🎧 Now can I ask some other personal details which we like to have on record?<br/>
🎧 Yes, of course.<br/>
🎧 I wonder if you could let us know what your interests are.<br/>
🎧 This might help us get a closer match for placing you in a particular hall.<br/>
🎧 Well. I love the theatre.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And I enjoy sports, particularly badminton.<br/>
🎧 Ah, that's worth knowing.<br/>
🎧 Now, what we finish with on the form is really a list from you of what your priorities are in choosing a hall<br/>
🎧 and we'll do our best to take these into account.<br/>
🎧 Well, the first thing is I'd prefer a hall where there are other mature students, if possible.<br/>
🎧 Yes, we do have halls which tend to cater for slightly older students.<br/>
🎧 Ummm and I'd prefer to be out of town.<br/>
🎧 That's actually very good for you because we tend to have more vacancies in out-of-town halls.<br/>
🎧 Lucky!<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Anything else?<br/>
🎧 Well, I would like somewhere with a shared area, a TV room for example, or something like that.<br/>
🎧 It's a good way to socialise.<br/>
🎧 Certainly is.<br/>
🎧 That's it.<br/>
🎧 Now, we just need a contact telephone number for you.<br/>
🎧 Sure, I'll just find it.<br/>
🎧 It's 667549.<br/>
🎧 Great, so we'll be in contact with you as soon as possible...<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Hello,<br/>
🎧 I'm delighted to welcome you to our Wildlife Club,<br/>
🎧 and very pleased that you're interested in the countryside<br/>
🎧 and the plants and creatures of this area.<br/>
🎧 I think you'll be surprised at the variety we have here,<br/>
🎧 even though we're not far from London.<br/>
🎧 I'll start by telling you about some of the parks and open spaces nearby.<br/>
🎧 One very pleasant place is Halland Common.<br/>
🎧 This has been public land for hundreds of years,<br/>
🎧 and what you'll find interesting is that the River Ouse, which flows into the sea eighty kilometres away,<br/>
🎧 has its source in the common.<br/>
🎧 There's an information board about the plants and animals you can see here,<br/>
🎧 and by the way, the common is accessible 24 hours a day.<br/>
🎧 Then there's Holt Island, which is noted for its great range of trees.<br/>
🎧 In the past willows were grown here commercially for basket-making,<br/>
🎧 and this ancient craft has recently been reintroduced.<br/>
🎧 The island is only open to the public from Friday to Sunday,<br/>
🎧 because it's quite small,<br/>
🎧 and if there were people around every day, much of the wildlife would keep away.<br/>
🎧 From there it's just a short walk across the bridge to Longfield Country Park.<br/>
🎧 Longfield has a modern replica of a farm from over two thousand years ago.<br/>
🎧 Children's activities are often arranged there, like bread-making and face-painting.<br/>
🎧 The park is only open during daylight hours, so bear that in mind if you decide to go there.<br/>
🎧 Longfield Park has a programme of activities throughout the year,<br/>
🎧 and to give you a sample, this is what's happening in the next few days.<br/>
🎧 On Monday you can learn about herbs, and how they've been used over the centuries.<br/>
🎧 You'll start with a tour of our herb garden,<br/>
🎧 practise the technique of using them as colour dyes for cloth,<br/>
🎧 and listen to an illustrated talk about their use in cooking and medicine.<br/>
🎧 Then on Wednesday you can join local experts to discover the variety of insects and birds that appear in the evening.<br/>
🎧 We keep to a small number of people in the group,<br/>
🎧 so if you want to go, you'll need to phone the park ranger a few days ahead.<br/>
🎧 There's a small charge, which you should pay when you turn up.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you're all keen to help with the practical task of looking after the park,<br/>
🎧 so on Saturday you can join a working party.<br/>
🎧 You'll have a choice of all sorts of activities, from planting hedges to picking up litter,<br/>
🎧 so you'll be able to change from one to another when you feel like it.<br/>
🎧 The rangers will be hard at work all day,<br/>
🎧 but do come and join in, even for just a short while.<br/>
🎧 One thing, though, is to make sure you're wearing something that you don't mind getting dirty or torn.<br/>
🎧 And finally I'd like to tell you about our new wildlife area, Hinchingbrooke Park,<br/>
🎧 which will be opened to the public next month.<br/>
🎧 This slide doesn't really indicate how big it is,<br/>
🎧 but anyway, you can see the two gates into the park, and the main paths.<br/>
🎧 As you can see, there's a lake in the north west of the park,<br/>
🎧 with a bird hide to the west of it, at the end of a path.<br/>
🎧 So it'll be a nice quiet place for watching the birds on the lake.<br/>
🎧 Fairly close to where refreshments are available,<br/>
🎧 there's a dog-walking area in the southern part of the park, leading off from the path.<br/>
🎧 And if you just want to sit and relax, you can go to the flower garden;<br/>
🎧 that's the circular area on the map surrounded by paths.<br/>
🎧 And finally, there's a wooded area in the western section of the park, between two paths.<br/>
🎧 Okay, that's enough from me, so let's...<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Hi Jun.<br/>
🎧 As you know, I've asked you here today to discuss the future of our Self-Access Centre.<br/>
🎧 We have to decide what we want to do about this very important resource for our English language students.<br/>
🎧 So, can you tell me what the students think about this?<br/>
🎧 Well, from the students' point of view, we would like to keep it.<br/>
🎧 The majority of students say that they enjoy using it<br/>
🎧 because it provides a variation on the classroom routine<br/>
🎧 and they see it as a pretty major component of their course,<br/>
🎧 but we would like to see some improvements to the equipment, particularly the computers;<br/>
🎧 there aren't enough for one each at the moment and we always have to share.<br/>
🎧 Well, yes, the teachers agree that it is a very valuable resource<br/>
🎧 but one thing we have noticed is that a lot of the students are using it to check their personal emails.<br/>
🎧 We don't want to stop you students using it,<br/>
🎧 but we think the computers should be used as a learning resource, not for emails.<br/>
🎧 Some of us also think that we could benefit a lot more by relocating the Self-Access Centre<br/>
🎧 to the main University library building.<br/>
🎧 How do you think the students would feel about that, Jun?<br/>
🎧 Well, the library is big enough to incorporate the Self-Access Centre,<br/>
🎧 but it wouldn't be like a class activity anymore.<br/>
🎧 Our main worry would be not being able to go to a teacher for advice.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure there would be plenty of things to do<br/>
🎧 but we really need teachers to help us choose the best activities.<br/>
🎧 Well, there would still be a teacher present and he or she would guide the activities of the students,<br/>
🎧 we wouldn't just leave them to get on with it.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but I think the students would be much happier keeping the existing set-up;<br/>
🎧 they really like going to the Self-Access Centre with their teacher<br/>
🎧 and staying together as a group to do activities.<br/>
🎧 If we could just improve the resources and facilities, I think it would be fine.<br/>
🎧 Is the cost going to be a problem?<br/>
🎧 It's not so much the expense that I'm worried about,<br/>
🎧 and we've certainly got room to do it,<br/>
🎧 but it's the problem of timetabling a teacher to be in there outside class hours.<br/>
🎧 If we're going to spend a lot of money on equipment and resources,<br/>
🎧 we really need to make sure that everything is looked after properly.<br/>
🎧 Anyway, let's make some notes to see just what needs doing to improve the Centre.<br/>
🎧 Now, what about the computers?<br/>
🎧 I think it might be a good idea to install some new models.<br/>
🎧 They would take up a lot less room<br/>
🎧 and so that would increase the work space for text books and so on.<br/>
🎧 That would be great.<br/>
🎧 It is a bit cramped in there at times.<br/>
🎧 What about other resources?<br/>
🎧 Do you have a list of things that the students would like to see improved?<br/>
🎧 Yes, one of the comments that students frequently make<br/>
🎧 is that they find it difficult to find materials that are appropriate for their level,<br/>
🎧 especially reading resources,<br/>
🎧 so I think we need to label them more clearly.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's easy enough, we can get that organised very quickly.<br/>
🎧 In fact, I think we should review all of the study resources as some of them are looking a bit out-of-date.<br/>
🎧 Definitely.<br/>
🎧 The CD section especially needs to be more current.<br/>
🎧 I think we should get some of the ones that go with our latest course books<br/>
🎧 and also make multiple copies.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 Now, I was also thinking about some different materials that we haven't got in there at all.<br/>
🎧 What do you think of the idea of introducing some workbooks?<br/>
🎧 If we break them up into separate pages and laminate them,<br/>
🎧 they'd be a great resource.<br/>
🎧 The students could study the main course book in class<br/>
🎧 and then do follow-up practice in the Self-Access Centre.<br/>
🎧 That sounds good.<br/>
🎧 Okay, now, finally we need to think about how the room is used.<br/>
🎧 I'll have to talk to the teachers<br/>
🎧 and make sure we can all reach some agreement on a timetable to supervise the centre after class.<br/>
🎧 But we also need to think about security, too.<br/>
🎧 Especially if we're going to invest in some new equipment.<br/>
🎧 Umm... what about putting in an alarm?<br/>
🎧 Good idea.<br/>
🎧 The other thing I'd like to do is talk to our technicians<br/>
🎧 and see whether we could somehow limit the access to email.<br/>
🎧 I really don't want to see that resource misused.<br/>
🎧 What about if we agree to only use it before and after class?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that would be fine.<br/>
🎧 OK, anyway...that's great for now.<br/>
🎧 We'll discuss it further when we've managed...<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Good morning everyone.<br/>
🎧 Now whether you're going to university to study business or some other subject,<br/>
🎧 many of you will eventually end up working for a company of some kind.<br/>
🎧 Now, when you first start working somewhere you will realise that the organisation you've joined has certain characteristics.<br/>
🎧 And we often refer to these social characteristics as the culture of the organisation.<br/>
🎧 This includes its unwritten ideas, beliefs, values and things like that.<br/>
🎧 One well known writer has classified company cultures by identifying four major types.<br/>
🎧 The first type is called the Power Culture,<br/>
🎧 and it's usually found in small organisations.<br/>
🎧 It's the type of culture that needs a central source of power to be effective,<br/>
🎧 and because control is in the hands of just one or two people,<br/>
🎧 there aren't many rules or procedures.<br/>
🎧 Another characteristic is that communication usually takes the form of conversations<br/>
🎧 rather than, say, formal meetings or written memos.<br/>
🎧 Now one of the benefits of this culture is that the organisation has the ability to act quickly,<br/>
🎧 so it responds well to threat, or danger on the one hand, and opportunity on the other.<br/>
🎧 But on the negative side, this type of organisation doesn't always act effectively,<br/>
🎧 because it depends too much on one or two people at the top,<br/>
🎧 and when these people make poor decisions, there's no-one else who can influence them.<br/>
🎧 And the kind of person who does well in this type of business culture is one who is happy to take risks,<br/>
🎧 and for whom job security is a low priority.<br/>
🎧 The next type is known as Role Culture -<br/>
🎧 that's ROLE, not ROLL, by the way,<br/>
🎧 and this type is usually found in large companies,<br/>
🎧 which have lots of different levels in them.<br/>
🎧 These organisations usually have separate departments<br/>
🎧 that specialise in things like finance, or sales, or maintenance, or whatever.<br/>
🎧 Each one is co-ordinated at the top by a small group of senior managers,<br/>
🎧 and typically everyone's job is controlled by sets of rules and procedures.<br/>
🎧 For example, there are specific job descriptions, rules for discipline, and so on.<br/>
🎧 What are the benefits of this kind of culture?<br/>
🎧 Well firstly, because it's found in large organisations,<br/>
🎧 its fixed costs, or overheads as they're known, are low in relation to its output, or what it produces.<br/>
🎧 In other words it can achieve economies of scale.<br/>
🎧 And secondly, it is particularly successful in business markets where technical expertise is important.<br/>
🎧 On the other hand, this culture is often very slow to recognise the need for change,<br/>
🎧 and even slower to react.<br/>
🎧 What kind of person does this type of culture suit?<br/>
🎧 Well, it suits employees who value security,<br/>
🎧 and who don't particularly want to have responsibility.<br/>
🎧 Moving on now to Task Cultures.<br/>
🎧 This type is found in organisations that are project-oriented.<br/>
🎧 You usually find it where the market for the company's product is extremely competitive,<br/>
🎧 or where the products themselves have a short life-span.<br/>
🎧 Usually top management delegates the projects, the people and other resources.<br/>
🎧 And once these have been allocated, little day-to-day control is exercised from the top,<br/>
🎧 because this would seem like breaking the rules'.<br/>
🎧 Now one of the major benefits of this culture is that it's flexible.<br/>
🎧 But it does have some major disadvantages too.<br/>
🎧 For instance, it can't produce economies of scale or great depth of expertise.<br/>
🎧 People who like working in groups or teams prefer this type of culture.<br/>
🎧 And finally, the fourth category is called the Person Culture...<br/>
<br/><br/>
