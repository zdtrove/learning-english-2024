🎧 Hello?<br/>
🎧 Oh hello. My name's Jan.<br/>
🎧 Are you the right person to talk to about the Buckworth Conservation Group?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I'm Peter. I'm the secretary.<br/>
🎧 Good. I've just moved to this area, and I'm interested in getting involved.<br/>
🎧 I was in a similar group where I used to live.<br/>
🎧 Could you tell me something about your activities, please?<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 Well, we have a mixture of regular activities and special events.<br/>
🎧 One of the regular ones is trying to keep the beach free of litter.<br/>
🎧 A few of us spend a couple of hours a month on it,<br/>
🎧 and it's awful how much there is to clear.<br/>
🎧 I wish people would be more responsible and take it home with them.<br/>
🎧 I totally agree.<br/>
🎧 I'd be happy to help with that.<br/>
🎧 Is it OK to take dogs?<br/>
🎧 I'm afraid not, as they're banned from the beach itself.<br/>
🎧 You can take them along the cliffs, though. And children are welcome.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 We also manage a nature reserve, and there's a lot to do there all year round.<br/>
🎧 For example, because it's a popular place to visit,<br/>
🎧 we spend a lot of time looking after the paths<br/>
🎧 and making sure they're in good condition for walking.<br/>
🎧 I could certainly help with that.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 And we have a programme of creating new habitats there.<br/>
🎧 We've just finished making and installing nesting boxes for birds to use,<br/>
🎧 and next we're going to work on encouraging insects,<br/>
🎧 they're important for the biodiversity of the reserve.<br/>
🎧 They certainly are.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and we're also running a project to identify the different species of butterflies that visit the reserve.<br/>
🎧 You might be interested in taking part in that.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 I was involved in something similar where I used to live,<br/>
🎧 counting all the species of moths.<br/>
🎧 I'd enjoy that.<br/>
🎧 Another job we're doing at the reserve is replacing the wall on the southern side,<br/>
🎧 between the parking area and our woodshed.<br/>
🎧 It was badly damaged in a storm last month.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Then as I said, we have a programme of events as well, both at the weekend, and during the week.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I presume you have guided walks?<br/>
🎧 I'd like to get to know the local countryside, as I'm new to the area.<br/>
🎧 Yes, we do. The next walk is to Ruston Island, a week on Saturday.<br/>
🎧 We'll be meeting in the car park at Dunsmore Beach at low tide,<br/>
🎧 that's when the sands are dry enough for us to walk to the island without getting wet.<br/>
🎧 Sounds good.<br/>
🎧 The island's a great place to explore.<br/>
🎧 It's quite small, and it's got a range of habitats.<br/>
🎧 It's also an ideal location for seeing seals just off the coast, or even on the beach.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And is there anything we should bring, like a picnic, for instance?<br/>
🎧 Yes, do bring one, as it's a full-day walk.<br/>
🎧 And of course it'll be wet walking across and back,<br/>
🎧 so make sure your boots are waterproof.<br/>
🎧 I must buy a new pair, there's a hole in one of my current ones!<br/>
🎧 Well, I'd definitely like to come on the walk.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 Then later this month we're having a one-day woodwork session in Hopton Wood.<br/>
🎧 I've never tried that before.<br/>
🎧 Is it OK for beginners to take part?<br/>
🎧 Definitely.<br/>
🎧 There'll be a couple of experts leading the session,<br/>
🎧 and we keep the number of participants down, so you'll get as much help as you need.<br/>
🎧 Excellent!<br/>
🎧 I'd love to be able to make chairs.<br/>
🎧 That's probably too ambitious for one day!<br/>
🎧 You'll be starting with wooden spoons,<br/>
🎧 and of course learning how to use the tools.<br/>
🎧 And anything you make is yours to take home with you.<br/>
🎧 That sounds like fun.<br/>
🎧 When is it?<br/>
🎧 It's on the 17th, from 10 a.m. until 3.<br/>
🎧 There's a charge of £35, including lunch<br/>
🎧 or £40 if you want to camp in the wood.<br/>
🎧 I should think I'll come home the same day.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'd certainly like to join the group.<br/>

🎧 So, hello everyone.<br/>
🎧 My name's Lou Miller and I'm going to be your tour guide today<br/>
🎧 as we take this fantastic boat trip around the Tasmanian coast.<br/>
🎧 Before we set off, I just want to tell you a few things about our journey.<br/>
🎧 Our boats aren't huge as you can see.<br/>
🎧 We already have three staff members on board<br/>
🎧 and on top of that,<br/>
🎧 we can transport a further fifteen people, that's you - around the coastline.<br/>
🎧 But please note if there are more than nine people on either side of the boat,<br/>
🎧 we'll move some of you over, otherwise all eighteen of us will end up in the sea!<br/>
🎧 We've recently upgraded all our boats.<br/>
🎧 They used to be jet black,<br/>
🎧 but our new ones now have these comfortable dark red seats and a light-green exterior<br/>
🎧 in order to stand out from others and help promote our company.<br/>
🎧 This gives our boats a rather unique appearance, don't you think?<br/>
🎧 We offer you a free lunchbox during the trip<br/>
🎧 and we have three types.<br/>
🎧 Lunchbox 1 contains ham and tomato sandwiches.<br/>
🎧 Lunchbox 2 contains a cheddar cheese roll<br/>
🎧 and Lunchbox 3 is salad-based and also contains eggs and tuna.<br/>
🎧 All three lunchboxes also have a packet of crisps and chocolate bar inside.<br/>
🎧 Please let staff know which lunchbox you prefer.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure I don't have to ask you not to throw anything into the sea.<br/>
🎧 We don't have any bins to put litter in,<br/>
🎧 but Jess, myself or Ray, our other guide, will collect it from you after lunch<br/>
🎧 and put it all in a large plastic sack.<br/>
🎧 The engine on the boat makes quite a lot of noise so before we head off,<br/>
🎧 let me tell you a few things about what you're going to see.<br/>
🎧 This area is famous for its ancient lighthouse,<br/>
🎧 which you'll see from the boat as we turn past the first little island.<br/>
🎧 It was built in 1838 to protect sailors<br/>
🎧 as a number of shipwrecks had led to significant loss of life.<br/>
🎧 The construction itself was complicated<br/>
🎧 as some of the original drawings kept by the local council show.<br/>
🎧 It sits right on top of the cliffs in a very isolated spot.<br/>
🎧 In the nineteenth century there were many jobs there,<br/>
🎧 such as polishing the brass lamps,<br/>
🎧 chopping firewood and cleaning windows, that kept lighthouse keepers busy.<br/>
🎧 These workers were mainly prison convicts until the middle of that century<br/>
🎧 when ordinary families willing to live in such circumstances took over.<br/>
🎧 Some of you have asked me what creatures we can expect to see.<br/>
🎧 I know everyone loves the penguins,<br/>
🎧 but they're very shy and, unfortunately, tend to hide from passing boats,<br/>
🎧 but you might see birds in the distance, such as sea eagles,<br/>
🎧 flying around the cliff edges where they nest.<br/>
🎧 When we get to the rocky area inhabited by fur seals,<br/>
🎧 we'll stop and watch them swimming around the coast.<br/>
🎧 They're inquisitive creatures so don't be surprised if one pops up right in front of you.<br/>
🎧 Their predators, orca whales, hunt along the coastline too,<br/>
🎧 but spotting one of these is rare.<br/>
🎧 Dolphins, on the other hand,<br/>
🎧 can sometimes approach on their own or in groups as they ride the waves beside us.<br/>
🎧 Lastly, I want to mention the caves.<br/>
🎧 Tasmania is famous for its caves<br/>
🎧 and the ones we'll pass by are so amazing that people are lost for words when they see them.<br/>
🎧 They can only be approached by sea.<br/>
🎧 but if you feel that you want to see more than we're able to show you,<br/>
🎧 then you can take a kayak into the area on another day<br/>
🎧 and one of our staff will give you more information on that.<br/>
🎧 What we'll do is to go through a narrow channel,<br/>
🎧 past some incredible rock formations<br/>
🎧 and from there we'll be able to see the openings to the caves,<br/>
🎧 and at that point we'll talk to you about what lies beyond.<br/>

🎧 So, Tim, we have to do a short summary of our work experience on a farm.<br/>
🎧 Right. My farm was great,<br/>
🎧 but arranging the work experience was hard.<br/>
🎧 One problem was it was miles away and I don't drive.<br/>
🎧 And also, I'd really wanted a placement for a month,<br/>
🎧 but I could only get one for two weeks.<br/>
🎧 I was lucky,<br/>
🎧 the farmer let me stay on the farm so I didn't have to travel.<br/>
🎧 But finding the right sort of farm to apply to wasn't easy.<br/>
🎧 No, they don't seem to have websites, do they.<br/>
🎧 I found mine through a friend of my mother's, but it wasn't easy.<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 My farm was mostly livestock, especially sheep.<br/>
🎧 I really enjoyed helping out with them.<br/>
🎧 I was up most of one night helping a sheep deliver a lamb...<br/>
🎧 On your own?<br/>
🎧 No, the farmer was there,<br/>
🎧 and he told me what to do.<br/>
🎧 It wasn't a straightforward birth, but I managed.<br/>
🎧 It was a great feeling to see the lamb stagger to its feet and start feeding almost straightaway,<br/>
🎧 and to know that it was OK.<br/>
🎧 Then another time a lamb had broken its leg,<br/>
🎧 and they got the vet in to set it,<br/>
🎧 and he talked me through what he was doing.<br/>
🎧 That was really useful.<br/>
🎧 Yes, my farm had sheep too.<br/>
🎧 The farm was in a valley and they had a lowland breed called Suffolks,<br/>
🎧 although the farmer said they'd had other breeds in the past.<br/>
🎧 So were they bred for their meat?<br/>
🎧 Mostly, yes.<br/>
🎧 They're quite big and solid.<br/>
🎧 My farm was up in the hills and they had a different breed of sheep,<br/>
🎧 they were Cheviots.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I heard their wool's really sought after.<br/>
🎧 Yes. It's very hardwearing and they use it for carpets.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I was interested in the amount of supplements they add to animals' feed nowadays.<br/>
🎧 Like, even the chickens got extra vitamins and electrolytes in their feed.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I found that too.<br/>
🎧 And they're not cheap.<br/>
🎧 But my farmer said some are overpriced for what they are.<br/>
🎧 And he didn't give them as a matter of routine,<br/>
🎧 just at times when the chickens seemed to particularly require them.<br/>
🎧 Yes, mine said the same.<br/>
🎧 He said certain breeds of chickens might need more supplements than the others,<br/>
🎧 but the cheap and expensive ones are all basically the same.<br/>
🎧 So did your farm have any other livestock, Diana?<br/>
🎧 Yes, dairy cows.<br/>
🎧 I made a really embarrassing mistake when I was working in the milk shed.<br/>
🎧 Some cows had been treated with antibiotics,<br/>
🎧 so their milk wasn't suitable for human consumption,<br/>
🎧 and it had to be put in a separate container.<br/>
🎧 But I got mixed up,<br/>
🎧 and I poured some milk from the wrong cow in with the milk for humans,<br/>
🎧 so the whole lot had to be thrown away.<br/>
🎧 The farmer wasn't too happy with me.<br/>
🎧 I asked my farmer how much he depended on the vet to deal with health problems.<br/>
🎧 I'd read reports that the livestock's health is being affected<br/>
🎧 as farmers are under pressure to increase production.<br/>
🎧 Well, he didn't agree with that,<br/>
🎧 but he said that actually some of the stuff the vets do, like minor operations,<br/>
🎧 he'd be quite capable of doing himself.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. My farmer said the same.<br/>
🎧 But he reckons vets' skills are still needed.<br/>
🎧 Now we've got to give a bit of feedback about last term's modules,<br/>
🎧 just short comments, apparently.<br/>
🎧 Shall we do that now?<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So medical terminology.<br/>
🎧 Well, my heart sank when I saw that,<br/>
🎧 especially right at the beginning of the course.<br/>
🎧 And I did struggle with it.<br/>
🎧 I thought it'd be hard,<br/>
🎧 but actually I found it all quite straightforward.<br/>
🎧 What did you think about diet and nutrition?<br/>
🎧 OK, I suppose.<br/>
🎧 Do you remember what they told us about pet food<br/>
🎧 and the fact that there's such limited checking into whether or not it's contaminated?<br/>
🎧 I mean in comparison with the checks on food for humans,<br/>
🎧 I thought that was terrible.<br/>
🎧 I think the module that really impressed me was the animal disease one,<br/>
🎧 when we looked at domesticated animals in different parts of the world,<br/>
🎧 like camels and water buffalo and alpaca.<br/>
🎧 The economies of so many countries depend on these,<br/>
🎧 but scientists don't know much about the diseases that affect them.<br/>
🎧 Yes,<br/>
🎧 I thought they'd know a lot about ways of controlling and eradicating those diseases,<br/>
🎧 but that's not the case at all.<br/>
🎧 I loved the wildlife medication unit.<br/>
🎧 Things like helping birds that have been caught in oil spills.<br/>
🎧 That's something I hadn't thought about before.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I thought I might write my dissertation on something connected with that.<br/>
🎧 Right. So, actually I was thinking...<br/>

🎧 Labyrinths have existed for well over 4,000 years.<br/>
🎧 Labyrinths and labyrinthine symbols have been found in regions as diverse as modern-day Turkey,<br/>
🎧 Ireland, Greece, and India<br/>
🎧 There are various designs of labyrinth<br/>
🎧 but what they all have in common is a winding spiral path which leads to a central area<br/>
🎧 There is one starting point at the entrance and the goal is to reach the central area.<br/>
🎧 Finding your way through a labyrinth involves many twists and turns,<br/>
🎧 but it's not possible to get lost as there is only one single path.<br/>
🎧 In modern times, the word labyrinth has taken on a different meaning<br/>
🎧 and is often used as a synonym for a maze.<br/>
🎧 A maze is quite different<br/>
🎧 as it is a kind of puzzle with an intricate network of paths.<br/>
🎧 Mazes became fashionable in the 15th and 16th centuries in Europe,<br/>
🎧 and can still be found in the gardens of great houses and palaces.<br/>
🎧 The paths are usually surrounded by thick, high hedges so that it's not possible to see over them.<br/>
🎧 Entering a maze usually involves getting lost a few times<br/>
🎧 before using logic to work out the pattern and find your way to the centre and then out again.<br/>
🎧 There are lots of dead ends and paths which lead you back to where you started.<br/>
🎧 The word 'maze' is believed to come from a Scandinavian word for a state of confusion.<br/>
🎧 This is where the word 'amazing' comes from.<br/>
🎧 Labyrinths, on the other hand, have a very different function.<br/>
🎧 Although people now often refer to things they find complicated as labyrinths,<br/>
🎧 this is not how they were seen in the past.<br/>
🎧 The winding spiral of the labyrinth has been used for centuries as a metaphor for life's journey.<br/>
🎧 It served as a spiritual reminder that there is purpose and meaning to our lives<br/>
🎧 and helped to give people a sense of direction.<br/>
🎧 Labyrinths are thought to encourage a feeling of calm<br/>
🎧 and have been used as a meditation and prayer tool in many cultures over many centuries.<br/>
🎧 The earliest examples of the labyrinth spiral pattern have been found carved into stone,<br/>
🎧 from Sardinia to Scandinavia, from Arizona to India to Africa.<br/>
🎧 In Europe, these spiral carvings date from the late Bronze Age.<br/>
🎧 The Native American Pima tribe wove baskets with a circular labyrinth design that depicted their own cosmology.<br/>
🎧 In Ancient Greece, the labyrinth spiral was used on coins around 4000 years ago.<br/>
🎧 Labyrinths made of mosaics were commonly found in bathhouses,<br/>
🎧 villas and tombs throughout the Roman Empire.<br/>
🎧 In Northern Europe, there were actual physical labyrinths designed for walking on.<br/>
🎧 These were cut into the turf or grass, usually in a circular pattern.<br/>
🎧 The origin of these walking labyrinths remains unclear,<br/>
🎧 but they were probably used for fertility rites<br/>
🎧 which may date back thousands of years.<br/>
🎧 Eleven examples of turf labyrinths survive today,<br/>
🎧 including the largest one at Saffron Walden, England,<br/>
🎧 which used to have a large tree in the middle of it.<br/>
🎧 More recently labyrinths have experienced something of a revival.<br/>
🎧 Some believe that walking a labyrinth promotes healing and mindfulness,<br/>
🎧 and there are those who believe in its emotional and physical benefits,<br/>
🎧 which include slower breathing<br/>
🎧 and a restored sense of balance and perspective.<br/>
🎧 This idea has become so popular that labyrinths have been laid into the floors of spas, wellness centres<br/>
🎧 and even prisons in recent years.<br/>
🎧 A pamphlet at Colorado Children's Hospital informs patients that<br/>
🎧 'walking a labyrinth can often calm people in the midst of a crisis'.<br/>
🎧 And apparently, it's not only patients who benefit.<br/>
🎧 Many visitors find walking a labyrinth less stressful than sitting in a corridor or waiting room.<br/>
🎧 Some doctors even walk the labyrinth during their breaks.<br/>
🎧 In some hospitals, patients who can't walk<br/>
🎧 can have a paper 'finger labyrinth' brought to their bed.<br/>
🎧 The science behind the theory is a little sketchy,<br/>
🎧 but there are dozens of small-scale studies which support claims about the benefits of labyrinths.<br/>
🎧 For example, one study found that walking a labyrinth provided 'short-term calming,<br/>
🎧 relaxation, and relief from anxiety' for Alzheimer's patients.<br/>
🎧 So, what is it about labyrinths that makes their appeal so universal?...<br/>
<br/><br/>
