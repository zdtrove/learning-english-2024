🎧 Hello?<br/>
🎧 Oh hello. My name's</span> Jan</span>.<br/>
🎧 Are you the right person to talk to about the Buckworth</span> Conservation</span> Group?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I'm Peter</span>. I'm the secretary</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good. I've just moved</span> to this area</span>, and I'm interested in getting involved</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was in a similar</span> group where I used to live.<br/>
🎧 Could you tell me something about your activities</span>, please?<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 Well, we have a mixture</span> of regular</span> activities</span> and special events</span>.<br/>
🎧 One of the regular</span> ones</span> is trying to keep the beach</span> free of litter</span>.<br/>
🎧 A few of us spend</span> a couple</span> of hours a month on it,<br/>
🎧 and it's awful</span> how much there is to clear</span>.<br/>
🎧 I wish people would be more responsible</span> and take it home with them.<br/>
🎧 I totally</span> agree.<br/>
🎧 I'd be happy to help with that.<br/>
🎧 Is it OK to take dogs</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm afraid</span> not, as they're banned</span> from the beach</span> itself</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can take them along the cliffs</span>, though. And children are welcome</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 We also manage</span> a nature</span> reserve</span>, and there's a lot to do there all year round</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, because it's a popular</span> place to visit,<br/>
🎧 we spend</span> a lot of time looking after the paths<br/></span>
🎧 and making</span> sure they're in good condition</span> for walking</span>.<br/>
🎧 I could certainly</span> help with that.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 And we have a programme</span> of creating</span> new habitats</span> there.<br/>
🎧 We've just finished</span> making</span> and installing</span> nesting</span> boxes</span> for birds</span> to use,<br/>
🎧 and next we're going to work on encouraging</span> insects</span>,<br/>
🎧 they're important for the biodiversity</span> of the reserve</span>.<br/>
🎧 They certainly</span> are.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and we're also running</span> a project</span> to identify</span> the different species</span> of butterflies</span> that visit the reserve</span>.<br/>
🎧 You might be interested in taking part</span> in that.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 I was involved</span> in something similar</span> where I used to live,<br/>
🎧 counting</span> all the species</span> of moths</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd enjoy that.<br/>
🎧 Another job</span> we're doing at the reserve</span> is replacing</span> the wall</span> on the southern</span> side,<br/>
🎧 between the parking</span> area</span> and our woodshed</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was badly</span> damaged</span> in a storm</span> last month.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Then as I said, we have a programme</span> of events</span> as well, both at the weekend, and during the week.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I presume</span> you have guided</span> walks</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'd like to get to know the local</span> countryside</span>, as I'm new to the area</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, we do. The next walk</span> is to Ruston</span> Island</span>, a week on Saturday</span>.<br/>
🎧 We'll be meeting</span> in the car park</span> at Dunsmore</span> Beach</span> at low tide</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's when the sands</span> are dry enough for us to walk</span> to the island</span> without getting wet.<br/>
🎧 Sounds good.<br/>
🎧 The island's</span> a great place to explore</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's quite small, and it's got a range</span> of habitats</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's also an ideal</span> location</span> for seeing</span> seals</span> just off the coast</span>, or even on the beach</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And is there anything we should bring</span>, like a picnic</span>, for instance</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, do bring</span> one, as it's a full-day</span> walk</span>.<br/>
🎧 And of course it'll be wet walking</span> across and back,<br/>
🎧 so make sure your boots</span> are waterproof</span>.<br/>
🎧 I must buy a new pair</span>, there's a hole</span> in one of my current</span> ones</span>!<br/>
🎧 Well, I'd definitely like to come on the walk</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 Then later this month we're having a one-day</span> woodwork</span> session</span> in Hopton</span> Wood</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've never tried</span> that before.<br/>
🎧 Is it OK for beginners</span> to take part</span>?<br/>
🎧 Definitely.<br/>
🎧 There'll</span> be a couple</span> of experts</span> leading</span> the session</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we keep the number of participants</span> down, so you'll get as much help as you need.<br/>
🎧 Excellent</span>!<br/>
🎧 I'd love to be able to make chairs</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's probably too ambitious</span> for one day!<br/>
🎧 You'll be starting</span> with wooden</span> spoons</span>,<br/>
🎧 and of course learning</span> how to use the tools</span>.<br/>
🎧 And anything you make is yours</span> to take home with you.<br/>
🎧 That sounds like fun.<br/>
🎧 When is it?<br/>
🎧 It's on the 17th</span>, from 10</span> a.m</span>. until 3</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's a charge</span> of £35</span>, including</span> lunch<br/></span>
🎧 or £40</span> if you want to camp</span> in the wood</span>.<br/>
🎧 I should think I'll come home the same day.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'd certainly</span> like to join the group.<br/>

🎧 So, hello everyone.<br/>
🎧 My name's</span> Lou</span> Miller</span> and I'm going to be your tour</span> guide</span> today<br/></span>
🎧 as we take this fantastic</span> boat</span> trip</span> around the Tasmanian</span> coast</span>.<br/>
🎧 Before we set off, I just want to tell you a few things about our journey</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our boats</span> aren't huge</span> as you can see.<br/>
🎧 We already have three</span> staff</span> members</span> on board<br/></span>
🎧 and on top of that,<br/>
🎧 we can transport</span> a further</span> fifteen</span> people, that's you -</span> around the coastline</span>.<br/>
🎧 But please note</span> if there are more than nine</span> people on either side of the boat</span>,<br/>
🎧 we'll move some of you over, otherwise</span> all eighteen</span> of us will end up in the sea!<br/>
🎧 We've recently</span> upgraded</span> all our boats</span>.<br/>
🎧 They used to be jet</span> black</span>,<br/>
🎧 but our new ones</span> now have these comfortable</span> dark</span> red seats</span> and a light-green</span> exterior<br/></span>
🎧 in order to stand</span> out from others</span> and help promote</span> our company.<br/>
🎧 This gives</span> our boats</span> a rather unique</span> appearance</span>, don't you think?<br/>
🎧 We offer</span> you a free lunchbox</span> during the trip<br/></span>
🎧 and we have three</span> types</span>.<br/>
🎧 Lunchbox</span> 1</span> contains</span> ham</span> and tomato</span> sandwiches</span>.<br/>
🎧 Lunchbox</span> 2</span> contains</span> a cheddar</span> cheese</span> roll<br/></span>
🎧 and Lunchbox</span> 3</span> is salad-based</span> and also contains</span> eggs</span> and tuna</span>.<br/>
🎧 All three</span> lunchboxes</span> also have a packet</span> of crisps</span> and chocolate</span> bar</span> inside.<br/>
🎧 Please let staff</span> know which lunchbox</span> you prefer</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure I don't have to ask you not to throw</span> anything into the sea.<br/>
🎧 We don't have any bins</span> to put litter</span> in,<br/>
🎧 but Jess</span>, myself or Ray</span>, our other guide</span>, will collect</span> it from you after lunch<br/></span>
🎧 and put it all in a large plastic</span> sack</span>.<br/>
🎧 The engine</span> on the boat</span> makes quite a lot of noise</span> so before we head</span> off,<br/>
🎧 let me tell you a few things about what you're going to see.<br/>
🎧 This area</span> is famous for its ancient</span> lighthouse</span>,<br/>
🎧 which you'll see from the boat</span> as we turn</span> past</span> the first little island</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was built</span> in 1838</span> to protect</span> sailors<br/></span>
🎧 as a number of shipwrecks</span> had led</span> to significant</span> loss</span> of life.<br/>
🎧 The construction</span> itself</span> was complicated<br/></span>
🎧 as some of the original</span> drawings</span> kept</span> by the local</span> council</span> show.<br/>
🎧 It sits</span> right on top of the cliffs</span> in a very isolated</span> spot</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the nineteenth</span> century</span> there were many jobs</span> there,<br/>
🎧 such as polishing</span> the brass</span> lamps</span>,<br/>
🎧 chopping</span> firewood</span> and cleaning</span> windows</span>, that kept</span> lighthouse</span> keepers</span> busy</span>.<br/>
🎧 These workers</span> were mainly</span> prison</span> convicts</span> until the middle</span> of that century<br/></span>
🎧 when ordinary</span> families</span> willing</span> to live in such circumstances</span> took over.<br/>
🎧 Some of you have asked</span> me what creatures</span> we can expect</span> to see.<br/>
🎧 I know everyone loves</span> the penguins</span>,<br/>
🎧 but they're very shy and, unfortunately</span>, tend</span> to hide</span> from passing</span> boats</span>,<br/>
🎧 but you might see birds</span> in the distance</span>, such as sea eagles</span>,<br/>
🎧 flying</span> around the cliff</span> edges</span> where they nest</span>.<br/>
🎧 When we get to the rocky</span> area</span> inhabited</span> by fur seals</span>,<br/>
🎧 we'll stop</span> and watch</span> them swimming</span> around the coast</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're inquisitive</span> creatures</span> so don't be surprised</span> if one pops</span> up right in front</span> of you.<br/>
🎧 Their predators</span>, orca</span> whales</span>, hunt</span> along the coastline</span> too,<br/>
🎧 but spotting</span> one of these is rare</span>.<br/>
🎧 Dolphins</span>, on the other hand</span>,<br/>
🎧 can sometimes approach</span> on their own or in groups</span> as they ride</span> the waves</span> beside</span> us.<br/>
🎧 Lastly</span>, I want to mention</span> the caves</span>.<br/>
🎧 Tasmania</span> is famous for its caves<br/></span>
🎧 and the ones</span> we'll pass</span> by are so amazing that people are lost</span> for words</span> when they see them.<br/>
🎧 They can only be approached</span> by sea.<br/>
🎧 but if you feel that you want to see more than we're able to show you,<br/>
🎧 then you can take a kayak</span> into the area</span> on another day<br/></span>
🎧 and one of our staff</span> will give you more information</span> on that.<br/>
🎧 What we'll do is to go through a narrow</span> channel</span>,<br/>
🎧 past</span> some incredible</span> rock</span> formations<br/></span>
🎧 and from there we'll be able to see the openings</span> to the caves</span>,<br/>
🎧 and at that point</span> we'll talk to you about what lies</span> beyond</span>.<br/>

🎧 So, Tim</span>, we have to do a short summary</span> of our work experience</span> on a farm</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right. My farm</span> was great,<br/>
🎧 but arranging</span> the work experience</span> was hard</span>.<br/>
🎧 One problem</span> was it was miles</span> away and I don't drive.<br/>
🎧 And also, I'd really wanted a placement</span> for a month,<br/>
🎧 but I could only get one for two weeks</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was lucky</span>,<br/>
🎧 the farmer</span> let me stay</span> on the farm</span> so I didn't have to travel.<br/>
🎧 But finding</span> the right sort</span> of farm</span> to apply</span> to wasn't easy.<br/>
🎧 No, they don't seem</span> to have websites</span>, do they.<br/>
🎧 I found</span> mine</span> through a friend of my mother's</span>, but it wasn't easy.<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 My farm</span> was mostly</span> livestock</span>, especially</span> sheep</span>.<br/>
🎧 I really enjoyed</span> helping</span> out with them.<br/>
🎧 I was up most of one night</span> helping</span> a sheep</span> deliver</span> a lamb..</span>.<br/>
🎧 On your own?<br/>
🎧 No, the farmer</span> was there,<br/>
🎧 and he told me what to do.<br/>
🎧 It wasn't a straightforward</span> birth</span>, but I managed</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was a great feeling to see the lamb</span> stagger</span> to its feet</span> and start feeding</span> almost straightaway</span>,<br/>
🎧 and to know that it was OK.<br/>
🎧 Then another time a lamb</span> had broken</span> its leg,<br/>
🎧 and they got the vet</span> in to set it,<br/>
🎧 and he talked</span> me through what he was doing.<br/>
🎧 That was really useful</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, my farm</span> had sheep</span> too.<br/>
🎧 The farm</span> was in a valley</span> and they had a lowland</span> breed</span> called Suffolks</span>,<br/>
🎧 although the farmer</span> said they'd had other breeds</span> in the past</span>.<br/>
🎧 So were they bred</span> for their meat</span>?<br/>
🎧 Mostly</span>, yes.<br/>
🎧 They're quite big and solid</span>.<br/>
🎧 My farm</span> was up in the hills</span> and they had a different breed</span> of sheep</span>,<br/>
🎧 they were Cheviots</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I heard their wool's</span> really sought</span> after.<br/>
🎧 Yes. It's very hardwearing</span> and they use it for carpets</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I was interested in the amount of supplements</span> they add to animals'</span> feed</span> nowadays</span>.<br/>
🎧 Like, even the chickens</span> got extra</span> vitamins</span> and electrolytes</span> in their feed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I found</span> that too.<br/>
🎧 And they're not cheap</span>.<br/>
🎧 But my farmer</span> said some are overpriced</span> for what they are.<br/>
🎧 And he didn't give them as a matter</span> of routine</span>,<br/>
🎧 just at times</span> when the chickens</span> seemed</span> to particularly</span> require</span> them.<br/>
🎧 Yes, mine</span> said the same.<br/>
🎧 He said certain</span> breeds</span> of chickens</span> might need more supplements</span> than the others</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the cheap</span> and expensive</span> ones</span> are all basically</span> the same.<br/>
🎧 So did your farm</span> have any other livestock</span>, Diana</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, dairy</span> cows</span>.<br/>
🎧 I made a really embarrassing</span> mistake</span> when I was working in the milk</span> shed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some cows</span> had been treated</span> with antibiotics</span>,<br/>
🎧 so their milk</span> wasn't suitable</span> for human</span> consumption</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it had to be put in a separate</span> container</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I got mixed</span> up,<br/>
🎧 and I poured</span> some milk</span> from the wrong cow in with the milk</span> for humans</span>,<br/>
🎧 so the whole lot had to be thrown</span> away.<br/>
🎧 The farmer</span> wasn't too happy with me.<br/>
🎧 I asked</span> my farmer</span> how much he depended</span> on the vet</span> to deal</span> with health</span> problems</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd read reports</span> that the livestock's</span> health</span> is being affected<br/></span>
🎧 as farmers</span> are under pressure</span> to increase</span> production</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, he didn't agree with that,<br/>
🎧 but he said that actually some of the stuff</span> the vets</span> do, like minor</span> operations</span>,<br/>
🎧 he'd be quite capable</span> of doing himself</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. My farmer</span> said the same.<br/>
🎧 But he reckons</span> vets'</span> skills</span> are still needed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now we've got to give a bit of feedback</span> about last term's</span> modules</span>,<br/>
🎧 just short comments</span>, apparently</span>.<br/>
🎧 Shall we do that now?<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So medical</span> terminology</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, my heart</span> sank</span> when I saw that,<br/>
🎧 especially</span> right at the beginning</span> of the course.<br/>
🎧 And I did struggle</span> with it.<br/>
🎧 I thought it'd be hard</span>,<br/>
🎧 but actually I found</span> it all quite straightforward</span>.<br/>
🎧 What did you think about diet</span> and nutrition</span>?<br/>
🎧 OK, I suppose</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you remember what they told us about pet food<br/></span>
🎧 and the fact</span> that there's such limited</span> checking</span> into whether</span> or not it's contaminated</span>?<br/>
🎧 I mean in comparison</span> with the checks</span> on food for humans</span>,<br/>
🎧 I thought that was terrible</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think the module</span> that really impressed</span> me was the animal</span> disease</span> one,<br/>
🎧 when we looked</span> at domesticated</span> animals</span> in different parts</span> of the world</span>,<br/>
🎧 like camels</span> and water buffalo</span> and alpaca</span>.<br/>
🎧 The economies</span> of so many countries</span> depend</span> on these,<br/>
🎧 but scientists</span> don't know much about the diseases</span> that affect</span> them.<br/>
🎧 Yes,<br/>
🎧 I thought they'd know a lot about ways</span> of controlling</span> and eradicating</span> those diseases</span>,<br/>
🎧 but that's not the case at all.<br/>
🎧 I loved the wildlife</span> medication</span> unit</span>.<br/>
🎧 Things like helping</span> birds</span> that have been caught</span> in oil spills</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's something I hadn't thought about before.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I thought I might write</span> my dissertation</span> on something connected</span> with that.<br/>
🎧 Right. So, actually I was thinking..</span>.<br/>

🎧 Labyrinths</span> have existed</span> for well over 4,000</span> years.<br/>
🎧 Labyrinths</span> and labyrinthine</span> symbols</span> have been found</span> in regions</span> as diverse</span> as modern-day</span> Turkey</span>,<br/>
🎧 Ireland</span>, Greece</span>, and India<br/></span>
🎧 There are various</span> designs</span> of labyrinth<br/></span>
🎧 but what they all have in common</span> is a winding</span> spiral</span> path</span> which leads</span> to a central</span> area<br/></span>
🎧 There is one starting</span> point</span> at the entrance</span> and the goal</span> is to reach</span> the central</span> area</span>.<br/>
🎧 Finding</span> your way through a labyrinth</span> involves</span> many twists</span> and turns</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it's not possible</span> to get lost</span> as there is only one single</span> path</span>.<br/>
🎧 In modern</span> times</span>, the word</span> labyrinth</span> has taken on a different meaning<br/></span>
🎧 and is often used as a synonym</span> for a maze</span>.<br/>
🎧 A maze</span> is quite different<br/></span>
🎧 as it is a kind of puzzle</span> with an intricate</span> network</span> of paths</span>.<br/>
🎧 Mazes</span> became</span> fashionable</span> in the 15th</span> and 16th</span> centuries</span> in Europe</span>,<br/>
🎧 and can still be found</span> in the gardens</span> of great houses</span> and palaces</span>.<br/>
🎧 The paths</span> are usually surrounded</span> by thick</span>, high hedges</span> so that it's not possible</span> to see over them.<br/>
🎧 Entering</span> a maze</span> usually involves</span> getting lost</span> a few times<br/></span>
🎧 before using</span> logic</span> to work out the pattern</span> and find your way to the centre</span> and then out again.<br/>
🎧 There are lots of dead</span> ends</span> and paths</span> which lead</span> you back to where you started</span>.<br/>
🎧 The word</span> 'maze'</span> is believed</span> to come from a Scandinavian</span> word</span> for a state</span> of confusion</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is where the word</span> 'amazing'</span> comes from.<br/>
🎧 Labyrinths</span>, on the other hand</span>, have a very different function</span>.<br/>
🎧 Although people now often refer</span> to things they find complicated</span> as labyrinths</span>,<br/>
🎧 this is not how they were seen</span> in the past</span>.<br/>
🎧 The winding</span> spiral</span> of the labyrinth</span> has been used for centuries</span> as a metaphor</span> for life's</span> journey</span>.<br/>
🎧 It served</span> as a spiritual</span> reminder</span> that there is purpose</span> and meaning</span> to our lives<br/></span>
🎧 and helped</span> to give people a sense</span> of direction</span>.<br/>
🎧 Labyrinths</span> are thought to encourage</span> a feeling of calm<br/></span>
🎧 and have been used as a meditation</span> and prayer</span> tool</span> in many cultures</span> over many centuries</span>.<br/>
🎧 The earliest</span> examples</span> of the labyrinth</span> spiral</span> pattern</span> have been found</span> carved</span> into stone</span>,<br/>
🎧 from Sardinia</span> to Scandinavia</span>, from Arizona</span> to India</span> to Africa</span>.<br/>
🎧 In Europe</span>, these spiral</span> carvings</span> date from the late</span> Bronze</span> Age.<br/>
🎧 The Native</span> American</span> Pima</span> tribe</span> wove</span> baskets</span> with a circular</span> labyrinth</span> design</span> that depicted</span> their own cosmology</span>.<br/>
🎧 In Ancient</span> Greece</span>, the labyrinth</span> spiral</span> was used on coins</span> around 4000</span> years ago.<br/>
🎧 Labyrinths</span> made of mosaics</span> were commonly</span> found</span> in bathhouses</span>,<br/>
🎧 villas</span> and tombs</span> throughout</span> the Roman</span> Empire</span>.<br/>
🎧 In Northern</span> Europe</span>, there were actual</span> physical</span> labyrinths</span> designed</span> for walking</span> on.<br/>
🎧 These were cut into the turf</span> or grass</span>, usually in a circular</span> pattern</span>.<br/>
🎧 The origin</span> of these walking</span> labyrinths</span> remains</span> unclear</span>,<br/>
🎧 but they were probably used for fertility</span> rites<br/></span>
🎧 which may date back thousands</span> of years.<br/>
🎧 Eleven</span> examples</span> of turf</span> labyrinths</span> survive</span> today,<br/>
🎧 including</span> the largest</span> one at Saffron</span> Walden</span>, England</span>,<br/>
🎧 which used to have a large tree</span> in the middle</span> of it.<br/>
🎧 More recently</span> labyrinths</span> have experienced</span> something of a revival</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some believe</span> that walking</span> a labyrinth</span> promotes</span> healing</span> and mindfulness</span>,<br/>
🎧 and there are those who believe</span> in its emotional</span> and physical</span> benefits</span>,<br/>
🎧 which include</span> slower</span> breathing<br/></span>
🎧 and a restored</span> sense</span> of balance</span> and perspective</span>.<br/>
🎧 This idea has become so popular</span> that labyrinths</span> have been laid</span> into the floors</span> of spas</span>, wellness</span> centres<br/></span>
🎧 and even prisons</span> in recent</span> years.<br/>
🎧 A pamphlet</span> at Colorado</span> Children's</span> Hospital</span> informs</span> patients</span> that<br/></span>
🎧 'walking</span> a labyrinth</span> can often calm</span> people in the midst</span> of a crisis'</span>.<br/>
🎧 And apparently</span>, it's not only patients</span> who benefit</span>.<br/>
🎧 Many visitors</span> find walking</span> a labyrinth</span> less stressful</span> than sitting</span> in a corridor</span> or waiting</span> room.<br/>
🎧 Some doctors</span> even walk</span> the labyrinth</span> during their breaks</span>.<br/>
🎧 In some hospitals</span>, patients</span> who can't walk<br/></span>
🎧 can have a paper</span> 'finger</span> labyrinth'</span> brought</span> to their bed.<br/>
🎧 The science</span> behind the theory</span> is a little sketchy</span>,<br/>
🎧 but there are dozens</span> of small-scale</span> studies</span> which support</span> claims</span> about the benefits</span> of labyrinths</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, one study</span> found</span> that walking</span> a labyrinth</span> provided</span> 'short-term</span> calming</span>,<br/>
🎧 relaxation</span>, and relief</span> from anxiety'</span> for Alzheimer's</span> patients</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, what is it about labyrinths</span> that makes their appeal</span> so universal?..</span>.<br/>
