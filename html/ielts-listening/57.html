🎧 Hello?<br/>
🎧 Oh hello. My <span>name's</span> <span>Jan</span>.<br/>
🎧 Are you the right person to talk to about the <span>Buckworth</span> <span>Conservation</span> Group?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I'm <span>Peter</span>. I'm the <span>secretary</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good. I've just <span>moved</span> to this <span>area</span>, and I'm interested in getting <span>involved</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was in a <span>similar</span> group where I used to live.<br/>
🎧 Could you tell me something about your <span>activities</span>, please?<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 Well, we have a <span>mixture</span> of <span>regular</span> <span>activities</span> and special <span>events</span>.<br/>
🎧 One of the <span>regular</span> <span>ones</span> is trying to keep the <span>beach</span> free of <span>litter</span>.<br/>
🎧 A few of us <span>spend</span> a <span>couple</span> of hours a month on it,<br/>
🎧 and it's <span>awful</span> how much there is to <span>clear</span>.<br/>
🎧 I wish people would be more <span>responsible</span> and take it home with them.<br/>
🎧 I <span>totally</span> agree.<br/>
🎧 I'd be happy to help with that.<br/>
🎧 Is it OK to take <span>dogs</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>afraid</span> not, as they're <span>banned</span> from the <span>beach</span> <span>itself</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can take them along the <span>cliffs</span>, though. And children are <span>welcome</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 We also <span>manage</span> a <span>nature</span> <span>reserve</span>, and there's a lot to do there all year <span>round</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, because it's a <span>popular</span> place to visit,<br/>
🎧 we <span>spend</span> a lot of time looking after the <span>paths<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>making</span> sure they're in good <span>condition</span> for <span>walking</span>.<br/>
🎧 I could <span>certainly</span> help with that.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 And we have a <span>programme</span> of <span>creating</span> new <span>habitats</span> there.<br/>
🎧 We've just <span>finished</span> <span>making</span> and <span>installing</span> <span>nesting</span> <span>boxes</span> for <span>birds</span> to use,<br/>
🎧 and next we're going to work on <span>encouraging</span> <span>insects</span>,<br/>
🎧 they're important for the <span>biodiversity</span> of the <span>reserve</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>certainly</span> are.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and we're also <span>running</span> a <span>project</span> to <span>identify</span> the different <span>species</span> of <span>butterflies</span> that visit the <span>reserve</span>.<br/>
🎧 You might be interested in taking <span>part</span> in that.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>involved</span> in something <span>similar</span> where I used to live,<br/>
🎧 <span>counting</span> all the <span>species</span> of <span>moths</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd enjoy that.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>job</span> we're doing at the <span>reserve</span> is <span>replacing</span> the <span>wall</span> on the <span>southern</span> side,<br/>
🎧 between the <span>parking</span> <span>area</span> and our <span>woodshed</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>badly</span> <span>damaged</span> in a <span>storm</span> last month.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Then as I said, we have a <span>programme</span> of <span>events</span> as well, both at the weekend, and during the week.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I <span>presume</span> you have <span>guided</span> <span>walks</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'd like to get to know the <span>local</span> <span>countryside</span>, as I'm new to the <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, we do. The next <span>walk</span> is to <span>Ruston</span> <span>Island</span>, a week on <span>Saturday</span>.<br/>
🎧 We'll be <span>meeting</span> in the car <span>park</span> at <span>Dunsmore</span> <span>Beach</span> at low <span>tide</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's when the <span>sands</span> are dry enough for us to <span>walk</span> to the <span>island</span> without getting wet.<br/>
🎧 Sounds good.<br/>
🎧 The <span>island's</span> a great place to <span>explore</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's quite small, and it's got a <span>range</span> of <span>habitats</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's also an <span>ideal</span> <span>location</span> for <span>seeing</span> <span>seals</span> just off the <span>coast</span>, or even on the <span>beach</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And is there anything we should <span>bring</span>, like a <span>picnic</span>, for <span>instance</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, do <span>bring</span> one, as it's a <span>full-day</span> <span>walk</span>.<br/>
🎧 And of course it'll be wet <span>walking</span> across and back,<br/>
🎧 so make sure your <span>boots</span> are <span>waterproof</span>.<br/>
🎧 I must buy a new <span>pair</span>, there's a <span>hole</span> in one of my <span>current</span> <span>ones</span>!<br/>
🎧 Well, I'd definitely like to come on the <span>walk</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 Then later this month we're having a <span>one-day</span> <span>woodwork</span> <span>session</span> in <span>Hopton</span> <span>Wood</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've never <span>tried</span> that before.<br/>
🎧 Is it OK for <span>beginners</span> to take <span>part</span>?<br/>
🎧 Definitely.<br/>
🎧 <span>There'll</span> be a <span>couple</span> of <span>experts</span> <span>leading</span> the <span>session</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we keep the number of <span>participants</span> down, so you'll get as much help as you need.<br/>
🎧 <span>Excellent</span>!<br/>
🎧 I'd love to be able to make <span>chairs</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's probably too <span>ambitious</span> for one day!<br/>
🎧 You'll be <span>starting</span> with <span>wooden</span> <span>spoons</span>,<br/>
🎧 and of course <span>learning</span> how to use the <span>tools</span>.<br/>
🎧 And anything you make is <span>yours</span> to take home with you.<br/>
🎧 That sounds like fun.<br/>
🎧 When is it?<br/>
🎧 It's on the <span>17th</span>, from <span>10</span> <span>a.m</span>. until <span>3</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>charge</span> of <span>£35</span>, <span>including</span> <span>lunch<br/></span>
🎧 or <span>£40</span> if you want to <span>camp</span> in the <span>wood</span>.<br/>
🎧 I should think I'll come home the same day.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'd <span>certainly</span> like to join the group.<br/>

🎧 So, hello everyone.<br/>
🎧 My <span>name's</span> <span>Lou</span> <span>Miller</span> and I'm going to be your <span>tour</span> <span>guide</span> <span>today<br/></span>
🎧 as we take this <span>fantastic</span> <span>boat</span> <span>trip</span> around the <span>Tasmanian</span> <span>coast</span>.<br/>
🎧 Before we set off, I just want to tell you a few things about our <span>journey</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>boats</span> aren't <span>huge</span> as you can see.<br/>
🎧 We already have <span>three</span> <span>staff</span> <span>members</span> on <span>board<br/></span>
🎧 and on top of that,<br/>
🎧 we can <span>transport</span> a <span>further</span> <span>fifteen</span> people, that's you <span>-</span> around the <span>coastline</span>.<br/>
🎧 But please <span>note</span> if there are more than <span>nine</span> people on either side of the <span>boat</span>,<br/>
🎧 we'll move some of you over, <span>otherwise</span> all <span>eighteen</span> of us will end up in the sea!<br/>
🎧 We've <span>recently</span> <span>upgraded</span> all our <span>boats</span>.<br/>
🎧 They used to be <span>jet</span> <span>black</span>,<br/>
🎧 but our new <span>ones</span> now have these <span>comfortable</span> <span>dark</span> red <span>seats</span> and a <span>light-green</span> <span>exterior<br/></span>
🎧 in order to <span>stand</span> out from <span>others</span> and help <span>promote</span> our company.<br/>
🎧 This <span>gives</span> our <span>boats</span> a rather <span>unique</span> <span>appearance</span>, don't you think?<br/>
🎧 We <span>offer</span> you a free <span>lunchbox</span> during the <span>trip<br/></span>
🎧 and we have <span>three</span> <span>types</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Lunchbox</span> <span>1</span> <span>contains</span> <span>ham</span> and <span>tomato</span> <span>sandwiches</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Lunchbox</span> <span>2</span> <span>contains</span> a <span>cheddar</span> <span>cheese</span> <span>roll<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>Lunchbox</span> <span>3</span> is <span>salad-based</span> and also <span>contains</span> <span>eggs</span> and <span>tuna</span>.<br/>
🎧 All <span>three</span> <span>lunchboxes</span> also have a <span>packet</span> of <span>crisps</span> and <span>chocolate</span> <span>bar</span> inside.<br/>
🎧 Please let <span>staff</span> know which <span>lunchbox</span> you <span>prefer</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure I don't have to ask you not to <span>throw</span> anything into the sea.<br/>
🎧 We don't have any <span>bins</span> to put <span>litter</span> in,<br/>
🎧 but <span>Jess</span>, myself or <span>Ray</span>, our other <span>guide</span>, will <span>collect</span> it from you after <span>lunch<br/></span>
🎧 and put it all in a large <span>plastic</span> <span>sack</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>engine</span> on the <span>boat</span> makes quite a lot of <span>noise</span> so before we <span>head</span> off,<br/>
🎧 let me tell you a few things about what you're going to see.<br/>
🎧 This <span>area</span> is famous for its <span>ancient</span> <span>lighthouse</span>,<br/>
🎧 which you'll see from the <span>boat</span> as we <span>turn</span> <span>past</span> the first little <span>island</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>built</span> in <span>1838</span> to <span>protect</span> <span>sailors<br/></span>
🎧 as a number of <span>shipwrecks</span> had <span>led</span> to <span>significant</span> <span>loss</span> of life.<br/>
🎧 The <span>construction</span> <span>itself</span> was <span>complicated<br/></span>
🎧 as some of the <span>original</span> <span>drawings</span> <span>kept</span> by the <span>local</span> <span>council</span> show.<br/>
🎧 It <span>sits</span> right on top of the <span>cliffs</span> in a very <span>isolated</span> <span>spot</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>nineteenth</span> <span>century</span> there were many <span>jobs</span> there,<br/>
🎧 such as <span>polishing</span> the <span>brass</span> <span>lamps</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>chopping</span> <span>firewood</span> and <span>cleaning</span> <span>windows</span>, that <span>kept</span> <span>lighthouse</span> <span>keepers</span> <span>busy</span>.<br/>
🎧 These <span>workers</span> were <span>mainly</span> <span>prison</span> <span>convicts</span> until the <span>middle</span> of that <span>century<br/></span>
🎧 when <span>ordinary</span> <span>families</span> <span>willing</span> to live in such <span>circumstances</span> took over.<br/>
🎧 Some of you have <span>asked</span> me what <span>creatures</span> we can <span>expect</span> to see.<br/>
🎧 I know everyone <span>loves</span> the <span>penguins</span>,<br/>
🎧 but they're very shy and, <span>unfortunately</span>, <span>tend</span> to <span>hide</span> from <span>passing</span> <span>boats</span>,<br/>
🎧 but you might see <span>birds</span> in the <span>distance</span>, such as sea <span>eagles</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>flying</span> around the <span>cliff</span> <span>edges</span> where they <span>nest</span>.<br/>
🎧 When we get to the <span>rocky</span> <span>area</span> <span>inhabited</span> by fur <span>seals</span>,<br/>
🎧 we'll <span>stop</span> and <span>watch</span> them <span>swimming</span> around the <span>coast</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're <span>inquisitive</span> <span>creatures</span> so don't be <span>surprised</span> if one <span>pops</span> up right in <span>front</span> of you.<br/>
🎧 Their <span>predators</span>, <span>orca</span> <span>whales</span>, <span>hunt</span> along the <span>coastline</span> too,<br/>
🎧 but <span>spotting</span> one of these is <span>rare</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Dolphins</span>, on the other <span>hand</span>,<br/>
🎧 can sometimes <span>approach</span> on their own or in <span>groups</span> as they <span>ride</span> the <span>waves</span> <span>beside</span> us.<br/>
🎧 <span>Lastly</span>, I want to <span>mention</span> the <span>caves</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Tasmania</span> is famous for its <span>caves<br/></span>
🎧 and the <span>ones</span> we'll <span>pass</span> by are so amazing that people are <span>lost</span> for <span>words</span> when they see them.<br/>
🎧 They can only be <span>approached</span> by sea.<br/>
🎧 but if you feel that you want to see more than we're able to show you,<br/>
🎧 then you can take a <span>kayak</span> into the <span>area</span> on another <span>day<br/></span>
🎧 and one of our <span>staff</span> will give you more <span>information</span> on that.<br/>
🎧 What we'll do is to go through a <span>narrow</span> <span>channel</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>past</span> some <span>incredible</span> <span>rock</span> <span>formations<br/></span>
🎧 and from there we'll be able to see the <span>openings</span> to the <span>caves</span>,<br/>
🎧 and at that <span>point</span> we'll talk to you about what <span>lies</span> <span>beyond</span>.<br/>

🎧 So, <span>Tim</span>, we have to do a short <span>summary</span> of our work <span>experience</span> on a <span>farm</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right. My <span>farm</span> was great,<br/>
🎧 but <span>arranging</span> the work <span>experience</span> was <span>hard</span>.<br/>
🎧 One <span>problem</span> was it was <span>miles</span> away and I don't drive.<br/>
🎧 And also, I'd really wanted a <span>placement</span> for a month,<br/>
🎧 but I could only get one for two <span>weeks</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>lucky</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>farmer</span> let me <span>stay</span> on the <span>farm</span> so I didn't have to travel.<br/>
🎧 But <span>finding</span> the right <span>sort</span> of <span>farm</span> to <span>apply</span> to wasn't easy.<br/>
🎧 No, they don't <span>seem</span> to have <span>websites</span>, do they.<br/>
🎧 I <span>found</span> <span>mine</span> through a friend of my <span>mother's</span>, but it wasn't easy.<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 My <span>farm</span> was <span>mostly</span> <span>livestock</span>, <span>especially</span> <span>sheep</span>.<br/>
🎧 I really <span>enjoyed</span> <span>helping</span> out with them.<br/>
🎧 I was up most of one <span>night</span> <span>helping</span> a <span>sheep</span> <span>deliver</span> a <span>lamb..</span>.<br/>
🎧 On your own?<br/>
🎧 No, the <span>farmer</span> was there,<br/>
🎧 and he told me what to do.<br/>
🎧 It wasn't a <span>straightforward</span> <span>birth</span>, but I <span>managed</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was a great feeling to see the <span>lamb</span> <span>stagger</span> to its <span>feet</span> and start <span>feeding</span> almost <span>straightaway</span>,<br/>
🎧 and to know that it was OK.<br/>
🎧 Then another time a <span>lamb</span> had <span>broken</span> its leg,<br/>
🎧 and they got the <span>vet</span> in to set it,<br/>
🎧 and he <span>talked</span> me through what he was doing.<br/>
🎧 That was really <span>useful</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, my <span>farm</span> had <span>sheep</span> too.<br/>
🎧 The <span>farm</span> was in a <span>valley</span> and they had a <span>lowland</span> <span>breed</span> called <span>Suffolks</span>,<br/>
🎧 although the <span>farmer</span> said they'd had other <span>breeds</span> in the <span>past</span>.<br/>
🎧 So were they <span>bred</span> for their <span>meat</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Mostly</span>, yes.<br/>
🎧 They're quite big and <span>solid</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>farm</span> was up in the <span>hills</span> and they had a different <span>breed</span> of <span>sheep</span>,<br/>
🎧 they were <span>Cheviots</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I heard their <span>wool's</span> really <span>sought</span> after.<br/>
🎧 Yes. It's very <span>hardwearing</span> and they use it for <span>carpets</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I was interested in the amount of <span>supplements</span> they add to <span>animals'</span> <span>feed</span> <span>nowadays</span>.<br/>
🎧 Like, even the <span>chickens</span> got <span>extra</span> <span>vitamins</span> and <span>electrolytes</span> in their <span>feed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I <span>found</span> that too.<br/>
🎧 And they're not <span>cheap</span>.<br/>
🎧 But my <span>farmer</span> said some are <span>overpriced</span> for what they are.<br/>
🎧 And he didn't give them as a <span>matter</span> of <span>routine</span>,<br/>
🎧 just at <span>times</span> when the <span>chickens</span> <span>seemed</span> to <span>particularly</span> <span>require</span> them.<br/>
🎧 Yes, <span>mine</span> said the same.<br/>
🎧 He said <span>certain</span> <span>breeds</span> of <span>chickens</span> might need more <span>supplements</span> than the <span>others</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>cheap</span> and <span>expensive</span> <span>ones</span> are all <span>basically</span> the same.<br/>
🎧 So did your <span>farm</span> have any other <span>livestock</span>, <span>Diana</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, <span>dairy</span> <span>cows</span>.<br/>
🎧 I made a really <span>embarrassing</span> <span>mistake</span> when I was working in the <span>milk</span> <span>shed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>cows</span> had been <span>treated</span> with <span>antibiotics</span>,<br/>
🎧 so their <span>milk</span> wasn't <span>suitable</span> for <span>human</span> <span>consumption</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it had to be put in a <span>separate</span> <span>container</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I got <span>mixed</span> up,<br/>
🎧 and I <span>poured</span> some <span>milk</span> from the wrong cow in with the <span>milk</span> for <span>humans</span>,<br/>
🎧 so the whole lot had to be <span>thrown</span> away.<br/>
🎧 The <span>farmer</span> wasn't too happy with me.<br/>
🎧 I <span>asked</span> my <span>farmer</span> how much he <span>depended</span> on the <span>vet</span> to <span>deal</span> with <span>health</span> <span>problems</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd read <span>reports</span> that the <span>livestock's</span> <span>health</span> is being <span>affected<br/></span>
🎧 as <span>farmers</span> are under <span>pressure</span> to <span>increase</span> <span>production</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, he didn't agree with that,<br/>
🎧 but he said that actually some of the <span>stuff</span> the <span>vets</span> do, like <span>minor</span> <span>operations</span>,<br/>
🎧 he'd be quite <span>capable</span> of doing <span>himself</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. My <span>farmer</span> said the same.<br/>
🎧 But he <span>reckons</span> <span>vets'</span> <span>skills</span> are still <span>needed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now we've got to give a bit of <span>feedback</span> about last <span>term's</span> <span>modules</span>,<br/>
🎧 just short <span>comments</span>, <span>apparently</span>.<br/>
🎧 Shall we do that now?<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So <span>medical</span> <span>terminology</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, my <span>heart</span> <span>sank</span> when I saw that,<br/>
🎧 <span>especially</span> right at the <span>beginning</span> of the course.<br/>
🎧 And I did <span>struggle</span> with it.<br/>
🎧 I thought it'd be <span>hard</span>,<br/>
🎧 but actually I <span>found</span> it all quite <span>straightforward</span>.<br/>
🎧 What did you think about <span>diet</span> and <span>nutrition</span>?<br/>
🎧 OK, I <span>suppose</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you remember what they told us about pet <span>food<br/></span>
🎧 and the <span>fact</span> that there's such <span>limited</span> <span>checking</span> into <span>whether</span> or not it's <span>contaminated</span>?<br/>
🎧 I mean in <span>comparison</span> with the <span>checks</span> on food for <span>humans</span>,<br/>
🎧 I thought that was <span>terrible</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think the <span>module</span> that really <span>impressed</span> me was the <span>animal</span> <span>disease</span> one,<br/>
🎧 when we <span>looked</span> at <span>domesticated</span> <span>animals</span> in different <span>parts</span> of the <span>world</span>,<br/>
🎧 like <span>camels</span> and water <span>buffalo</span> and <span>alpaca</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>economies</span> of so many <span>countries</span> <span>depend</span> on these,<br/>
🎧 but <span>scientists</span> don't know much about the <span>diseases</span> that <span>affect</span> them.<br/>
🎧 Yes,<br/>
🎧 I thought they'd know a lot about <span>ways</span> of <span>controlling</span> and <span>eradicating</span> those <span>diseases</span>,<br/>
🎧 but that's not the case at all.<br/>
🎧 I loved the <span>wildlife</span> <span>medication</span> <span>unit</span>.<br/>
🎧 Things like <span>helping</span> <span>birds</span> that have been <span>caught</span> in oil <span>spills</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's something I hadn't thought about before.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I thought I might <span>write</span> my <span>dissertation</span> on something <span>connected</span> with that.<br/>
🎧 Right. So, actually I was <span>thinking..</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>Labyrinths</span> have <span>existed</span> for well over <span>4,000</span> years.<br/>
🎧 <span>Labyrinths</span> and <span>labyrinthine</span> <span>symbols</span> have been <span>found</span> in <span>regions</span> as <span>diverse</span> as <span>modern-day</span> <span>Turkey</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>Ireland</span>, <span>Greece</span>, and <span>India<br/></span>
🎧 There are <span>various</span> <span>designs</span> of <span>labyrinth<br/></span>
🎧 but what they all have in <span>common</span> is a <span>winding</span> <span>spiral</span> <span>path</span> which <span>leads</span> to a <span>central</span> <span>area<br/></span>
🎧 There is one <span>starting</span> <span>point</span> at the <span>entrance</span> and the <span>goal</span> is to <span>reach</span> the <span>central</span> <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Finding</span> your way through a <span>labyrinth</span> <span>involves</span> many <span>twists</span> and <span>turns</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it's not <span>possible</span> to get <span>lost</span> as there is only one <span>single</span> <span>path</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>modern</span> <span>times</span>, the <span>word</span> <span>labyrinth</span> has taken on a different <span>meaning<br/></span>
🎧 and is often used as a <span>synonym</span> for a <span>maze</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>maze</span> is quite <span>different<br/></span>
🎧 as it is a kind of <span>puzzle</span> with an <span>intricate</span> <span>network</span> of <span>paths</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mazes</span> <span>became</span> <span>fashionable</span> in the <span>15th</span> and <span>16th</span> <span>centuries</span> in <span>Europe</span>,<br/>
🎧 and can still be <span>found</span> in the <span>gardens</span> of great <span>houses</span> and <span>palaces</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>paths</span> are usually <span>surrounded</span> by <span>thick</span>, high <span>hedges</span> so that it's not <span>possible</span> to see over them.<br/>
🎧 <span>Entering</span> a <span>maze</span> usually <span>involves</span> getting <span>lost</span> a few <span>times<br/></span>
🎧 before <span>using</span> <span>logic</span> to work out the <span>pattern</span> and find your way to the <span>centre</span> and then out again.<br/>
🎧 There are lots of <span>dead</span> <span>ends</span> and <span>paths</span> which <span>lead</span> you back to where you <span>started</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>word</span> <span>'maze'</span> is <span>believed</span> to come from a <span>Scandinavian</span> <span>word</span> for a <span>state</span> of <span>confusion</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is where the <span>word</span> <span>'amazing'</span> comes from.<br/>
🎧 <span>Labyrinths</span>, on the other <span>hand</span>, have a very different <span>function</span>.<br/>
🎧 Although people now often <span>refer</span> to things they find <span>complicated</span> as <span>labyrinths</span>,<br/>
🎧 this is not how they were <span>seen</span> in the <span>past</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>winding</span> <span>spiral</span> of the <span>labyrinth</span> has been used for <span>centuries</span> as a <span>metaphor</span> for <span>life's</span> <span>journey</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>served</span> as a <span>spiritual</span> <span>reminder</span> that there is <span>purpose</span> and <span>meaning</span> to our <span>lives<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>helped</span> to give people a <span>sense</span> of <span>direction</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Labyrinths</span> are thought to <span>encourage</span> a feeling of <span>calm<br/></span>
🎧 and have been used as a <span>meditation</span> and <span>prayer</span> <span>tool</span> in many <span>cultures</span> over many <span>centuries</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>earliest</span> <span>examples</span> of the <span>labyrinth</span> <span>spiral</span> <span>pattern</span> have been <span>found</span> <span>carved</span> into <span>stone</span>,<br/>
🎧 from <span>Sardinia</span> to <span>Scandinavia</span>, from <span>Arizona</span> to <span>India</span> to <span>Africa</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>Europe</span>, these <span>spiral</span> <span>carvings</span> date from the <span>late</span> <span>Bronze</span> Age.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Native</span> <span>American</span> <span>Pima</span> <span>tribe</span> <span>wove</span> <span>baskets</span> with a <span>circular</span> <span>labyrinth</span> <span>design</span> that <span>depicted</span> their own <span>cosmology</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>Ancient</span> <span>Greece</span>, the <span>labyrinth</span> <span>spiral</span> was used on <span>coins</span> around <span>4000</span> years ago.<br/>
🎧 <span>Labyrinths</span> made of <span>mosaics</span> were <span>commonly</span> <span>found</span> in <span>bathhouses</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>villas</span> and <span>tombs</span> <span>throughout</span> the <span>Roman</span> <span>Empire</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>Northern</span> <span>Europe</span>, there were <span>actual</span> <span>physical</span> <span>labyrinths</span> <span>designed</span> for <span>walking</span> on.<br/>
🎧 These were cut into the <span>turf</span> or <span>grass</span>, usually in a <span>circular</span> <span>pattern</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>origin</span> of these <span>walking</span> <span>labyrinths</span> <span>remains</span> <span>unclear</span>,<br/>
🎧 but they were probably used for <span>fertility</span> <span>rites<br/></span>
🎧 which may date back <span>thousands</span> of years.<br/>
🎧 <span>Eleven</span> <span>examples</span> of <span>turf</span> <span>labyrinths</span> <span>survive</span> today,<br/>
🎧 <span>including</span> the <span>largest</span> one at <span>Saffron</span> <span>Walden</span>, <span>England</span>,<br/>
🎧 which used to have a large <span>tree</span> in the <span>middle</span> of it.<br/>
🎧 More <span>recently</span> <span>labyrinths</span> have <span>experienced</span> something of a <span>revival</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>believe</span> that <span>walking</span> a <span>labyrinth</span> <span>promotes</span> <span>healing</span> and <span>mindfulness</span>,<br/>
🎧 and there are those who <span>believe</span> in its <span>emotional</span> and <span>physical</span> <span>benefits</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>include</span> <span>slower</span> <span>breathing<br/></span>
🎧 and a <span>restored</span> <span>sense</span> of <span>balance</span> and <span>perspective</span>.<br/>
🎧 This idea has become so <span>popular</span> that <span>labyrinths</span> have been <span>laid</span> into the <span>floors</span> of <span>spas</span>, <span>wellness</span> <span>centres<br/></span>
🎧 and even <span>prisons</span> in <span>recent</span> years.<br/>
🎧 A <span>pamphlet</span> at <span>Colorado</span> <span>Children's</span> <span>Hospital</span> <span>informs</span> <span>patients</span> <span>that<br/></span>
🎧 <span>'walking</span> a <span>labyrinth</span> can often <span>calm</span> people in the <span>midst</span> of a <span>crisis'</span>.<br/>
🎧 And <span>apparently</span>, it's not only <span>patients</span> who <span>benefit</span>.<br/>
🎧 Many <span>visitors</span> find <span>walking</span> a <span>labyrinth</span> less <span>stressful</span> than <span>sitting</span> in a <span>corridor</span> or <span>waiting</span> room.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>doctors</span> even <span>walk</span> the <span>labyrinth</span> during their <span>breaks</span>.<br/>
🎧 In some <span>hospitals</span>, <span>patients</span> who can't <span>walk<br/></span>
🎧 can have a <span>paper</span> <span>'finger</span> <span>labyrinth'</span> <span>brought</span> to their bed.<br/>
🎧 The <span>science</span> behind the <span>theory</span> is a little <span>sketchy</span>,<br/>
🎧 but there are <span>dozens</span> of <span>small-scale</span> <span>studies</span> which <span>support</span> <span>claims</span> about the <span>benefits</span> of <span>labyrinths</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, one <span>study</span> <span>found</span> that <span>walking</span> a <span>labyrinth</span> <span>provided</span> <span>'short-term</span> <span>calming</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>relaxation</span>, and <span>relief</span> from <span>anxiety'</span> for <span>Alzheimer's</span> <span>patients</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, what is it about <span>labyrinths</span> that makes their <span>appeal</span> so <span>universal?..</span>.<br/>
