🎧 Hello Charlotte</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm Kaeden</span>, one of the supervisors</span>.<br/>
🎧 Welcome</span> to the team</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hi Aiden</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's Kaeden</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm so sorry.<br/>
🎧 Don't worry</span>.<br/>
🎧 People often get my name wrong;<br/></span>
🎧 they never know how to spell</span> it.<br/>
🎧 It's KAEDEN</span>, in case you ever need to write</span> it.<br/>
🎧 I'll try and remember.<br/>
🎧 So, there are a few practical</span> things you need to sort</span> out this morning.<br/>
🎧 Then I'll show you what you're going to do today.<br/>
🎧 Ah..</span>. the email</span> I received</span> said to go to the front</span> desk</span>, to show my letter</span> of appointment</span> and pick</span> up my badge</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll need that for the staffroom</span> and other areas</span> of the supermarket</span> where shoppers</span> aren't allowed</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, after you've finished</span> at the front</span> desk</span>, I'll take you to the staffroom</span>.<br/>
🎧 Put your coat</span> and rucksack</span> in one of the lockers</span> there.<br/>
🎧 Take whichever</span> one is free.<br/>
🎧 Will I have a key?<br/>
🎧 Yes. Try not to lose</span> it.<br/>
🎧 At the end of the day, leave it in the door</span> for the next person to use.<br/>
🎧 Will do.<br/>
🎧 You also need to go to the HR</span> department</span> to see Tiffany</span>.<br/>
🎧 She's really helpful</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was told to bring</span> my passport</span> with me.<br/>
🎧 HR</span> need to take a note</span> of the number in it.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 Or you can show your ID</span> card</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't have one of those.<br/>
🎧 Okay. Tiffany</span> will give you a uniform</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ah..</span>. They have lots in different sizes</span>, so you just tell her what you need.<br/>
🎧 I won't come with you to HR</span>. I've got to go and sort</span> something else out.<br/>
🎧 Uhm..</span>. problem</span> with a bread</span> slicer</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is the HR</span> office</span> near the staffroom</span>?<br/>
🎧 The staffroom's</span> on the first floor</span>, and HR</span> are a couple</span> of floors</span> above</span> that, on the third</span> floor</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's a staircase</span> outside the staffroom</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 When you've finished</span> with HR</span>, come and find me in the bakery</span> section</span> of the shop</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm looking forward to getting started</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll just give you my phone number, in case you can't find me.<br/>
🎧 Ah..</span>. have you got your phone there?<br/>
🎧 Yes..</span>. Okay, ready.<br/>
🎧 It's 0412665903</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, done.<br/>
🎧 So, Charlotte</span>, your tasks</span> today are in the bakery</span> section</span>,<br/>
🎧 on the sushi</span> counter</span>, and on the meat</span> and fish</span> counters</span>.<br/>
🎧 The first job</span> is to check sell-by</span> dates</span> on the bread</span> and cakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 If any of the dates</span> are today's</span>, put a new price</span> label</span> on the packaging</span>.<br/>
🎧 What if any of the labels</span> are yesterday's</span> dates</span>, or older</span>?<br/>
🎧 Do I throw</span> those items</span> away?<br/>
🎧 Yes, but that shouldn't happen</span>, we check the stock</span> every day.<br/>
🎧 When something needs a new price</span> label</span>,<br/>
🎧 put a yellow</span> one on the package</span>, next to the original</span> price</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 After that, you'll go to the sushi</span> takeaway</span> counter</span>.<br/>
🎧 Will I be preparing</span> boxes</span> of food?<br/>
🎧 Ah..</span>. for today, you'll just be helping</span> the staff</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, of course.<br/>
🎧 You'll see lots of flat</span> cardboard</span> boxes</span> at one end of the counter</span>.<br/>
🎧 Beneath</span> those is where we keep the plastic</span> boxes</span>,<br/>
🎧 we run out of those really quickly, so you should bring</span> more from the storeroom</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is that my only task</span> on the sushi</span> counter</span>?<br/>
🎧 No. You also need to clean</span> the area</span> where they prepare</span> the dishes</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are cloths</span> and bottles</span> of spray</span> by the sink</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and please make sure you clean</span> that too.<br/>
🎧 Sure. That's important, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Absolutely. But you mustn't wash</span> up knives</span>.<br/>
🎧 You have to do some training</span> before you're allowed</span> to touch sharp</span> objects</span>.<br/>
🎧 What should I do if there are any?<br/>
🎧 Ask someone</span> to put them in the dishwasher</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, thanks.<br/>
🎧 I don't want to get anything wrong.<br/>
🎧 Don't worry</span>. You'll be fine.<br/>
🎧 And I'll be around to help.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Finally, the meat</span> and fish</span> counters</span>.<br/>
🎧 You need to clean</span> the area</span> where staff</span> serve</span> customers</span>,<br/>
🎧 including</span> wiping</span> the weighing</span> scales</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Anything else?<br/>
🎧 The fish</span> is laid</span> on ice, but when that starts</span> to melt</span>, you'll need to get more from the cold-room</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know the staff</span> on the food counters</span> wear</span> a hat.<br/>
🎧 Will that be the same for me?<br/>
🎧 You won't be serving</span> customers</span> directly</span>, so no.<br/>
🎧 But make sure you put on thermal</span> gloves</span> when you take anything out of the cold-room</span>.<br/>
🎧 The temperature's</span> low enough in there to get frostbite</span> from touching</span> things.<br/>
🎧 Understood</span>.<br/>

🎧 My name's</span> Liz</span> Fuller</span> and I'm a running</span> coach</span> with Compton</span> Park</span> Runners</span> Club</span>.<br/>
🎧 Welcome</span> to my podcast</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you're thinking about taking up running</span> -</span> I'm here to help.<br/>
🎧 There are many training</span> programmes</span> available</span> online which aim</span> to help people build</span> up to running</span> 5</span> kilometres</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some of them are great<br/></span>
🎧 and thousands</span> of people of all ages</span> are taking part</span> in 5-kilometre</span> races</span> across the country</span> as a result</span>.<br/>
🎧 People like them because they're easy to follow</span> and don't push</span> them too hard</span>.<br/>
🎧 However</span>, they don't work for everyone,<br/>
🎧 especially</span> if you suffer</span> from something like a heart</span> condition</span> or asthma</span>,<br/>
🎧 because they're aimed</span> at people with average</span> fitness</span> and running</span> ability</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another thing is that everyone is different<br/></span>
🎧 and if you have any specific</span> questions</span> related</span> to your needs,<br/>
🎧 there's no one to provide</span> any answers</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have a couple</span> of simple tips</span> I always give to new runners</span>.<br/>
🎧 I expect</span> you've been told to run very slowly</span> until your fitness</span> increases</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, I find that can prevent</span> progress</span>.<br/>
🎧 You should run at a speed</span> that feels</span> comfortable</span>,<br/>
🎧 but time yourself and try to run a bit faster</span> each time.<br/>
🎧 Listening</span> to music can be very helpful</span>.<br/>
🎧 It takes your mind</span> off things and helps your body</span> get into a rhythm</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd say that is better than running</span> with a friend,<br/>
🎧 especially</span> as most people are competitive<br/></span>
🎧 and that's not what you want when you're just starting</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't think the time of day is especially</span> important.<br/>
🎧 Some people are better in the evening</span>, while others</span> are morning people<br/></span>
🎧 but you need to be consistent</span>, so aim</span> to train</span> regularly</span>.<br/>
🎧 Twice</span> a week is enough to begin</span> with.<br/>
🎧 New members</span> often say to me that they've</span> been put off running</span> either because they lack</span> confidence</span>,<br/>
🎧 or they don't have time,<br/>
🎧 or they think they dislike</span> running</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ceri</span>, for example, joined</span> the club</span> two years ago at the age of 40</span>.<br/>
🎧 She'd always enjoyed</span> running</span> at school but wasn't sure if she'd be able to do it.<br/>
🎧 She was worried</span> about being left</span> behind and being the slowest</span> runner</span>.<br/>
🎧 But she says she was made to feel so welcome</span> she soon forgot</span> all about that.<br/>
🎧 James</span> had always hated</span> the idea of running<br/></span>
🎧 but a friend encouraged</span> him to come along for a taster</span> session<br/></span>
🎧 and he hasn't looked</span> back.<br/>
🎧 He never misses</span> a training</span> session</span> despite</span> having a really demanding</span> job</span>.<br/>
🎧 Leo</span> was worried</span> about having to commit</span> himself</span> to training</span> sessions</span> every week<br/></span>
🎧 and wasn't sure he'd be able to fit training</span> into his busy</span> schedule</span>.<br/>
🎧 But after experiencing</span> a lot of stress</span> at work<br/></span>
🎧 he came along to us and gave it a go.<br/>
🎧 Now he says he feels</span> much more relaxed</span> and he looks forward to his weekly</span> run.<br/>
🎧 Mark</span> is quite typical</span> of our new members</span>.<br/>
🎧 He's never considered</span> himself</span> to be a sporty</span> person<br/></span>
🎧 and it was only when he retired</span> that he decided</span> to take up the challenge</span> of trying to run 5</span> kilometres</span>.<br/>
🎧 It took him months</span> to find the courage</span> to contact</span> us but felt</span> reassured</span> immediately<br/></span>
🎧 as there were other people his age who were only just taking up running</span> for the first time.<br/>
🎧 My own journey</span> hasn't been easy.<br/>
🎧 I did my first marathon</span> when I was 37</span>, after having had two kids</span>.<br/>
🎧 My husband</span> had been running</span> marathons</span> for years,<br/>
🎧 but I never dreamed</span> I'd be doing one with him.<br/>
🎧 I managed</span> to complete</span> it in four</span> hours,<br/>
🎧 but I felt</span> like giving</span> up halfway</span> through.<br/>
🎧 It was only the support</span> of the spectators</span> that kept</span> me going.<br/>
🎧 I do think signing</span> up for a race</span> of whatever length</span> is motivating<br/></span>
🎧 whether</span> it's 5K</span> or 25K<br/></span>
🎧 because it's good to have something to work towards<br/></span>
🎧 and it gives</span> you a sense</span> of achievement</span>.<br/>
🎧 I did my first 10K</span> after only six months</span>,<br/>
🎧 which was certainly</span> very challenging</span> and not something I'd necessarily</span> recommend</span>.<br/>
🎧 But after you've been training</span> for a few weeks</span>, it's worth</span> putting</span> your name down for a 5K</span>.<br/>
🎧 some people find they only need a few practice runs</span> before taking part</span> in a race</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I'd give yourself a couple</span> of months</span> at least</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, I hope that's given..</span>.<br/>

🎧 So Jane</span> you'll be off to Denmark</span> soon to do your work placement</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I'm really looking forward to it<br/></span>
🎧 and I've just started</span> packing</span> up all my books to put in storage</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, I hope they don't get spoilt</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's okay, my grandfather</span> works</span> in a bookshop<br/></span>
🎧 and he told me how to pack</span> them.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's helpful</span>.<br/>
🎧 He says you have to support</span> the spine<br/></span>
🎧 otherwise</span> the paper</span> can come away from the cover</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah that's obvious</span>.<br/>
🎧 He also told me to pack</span> them flat</span> in the box, not on their side,<br/>
🎧 again because they can bend<br/></span>
🎧 and if you leave them like that for, say, a year,<br/>
🎧 it's quite hard</span> to get them back to their normal</span> shape</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, it's pretty</span> clear</span> that ruins</span> them,<br/>
🎧 but a lot of people just can't be bothered</span> to protect</span> their books.<br/>
🎧 He always says it's such a shame</span> that publishers</span> don't use better-quality</span> paper</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's the acid</span> in the paper</span> that causes</span> the problem</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, that's why old books go yellow</span>.<br/>
🎧 You know some of the books my grandfather's</span> given</span> me are like that already.<br/>
🎧 I should dump</span> them really if they're going to deteriorate</span> further</span>, but I'd feel bad.<br/>
🎧 They'll always remind</span> me of him.<br/>
🎧 He's quite a collector</span>, you know.<br/>
🎧 Well, if they're important to you..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I'd regret</span> just throwing</span> them away.<br/>
🎧 You know, maybe it's because I was taught</span> to treasure</span> books..</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I hate</span> seeing</span> students force</span> open the pages</span> of paperbacks</span>.<br/>
🎧 They press</span> so hard</span> they end up breaking</span> the spine</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know,<br/>
🎧 but unfortunately</span>, paperbacks</span> aren't designed</span> to last a long time and people know that.<br/>
🎧 Hardbacks</span> aren't quite as weak</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, they're different, I suppose</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I still don't think people value</span> hardbacks</span> like they used to.<br/>
🎧 Well, they aren't decorative</span>, are they, like other objects</span>.<br/>
🎧 Plus</span>, nowadays</span>, people don't keep them out on shelves</span> as much as they used to.<br/>
🎧 That's such a pity</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I visit someone</span>,<br/>
🎧 if they have, say, a colourful</span> book on a table</span>, it's the first thing I'm drawn</span> to.<br/>
🎧 I agree,<br/>
🎧 and book covers</span> can be a work of art</span> in themselves</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some are really eye-catching</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've always been taught</span> to handle</span> books carefully</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you watch</span> someone</span> take a book off a shelf</span>, well, they usually do it wrong.<br/>
🎧 Ah, my grandfather</span> says, you should put your hand</span> right over the top of the book..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Or, if you can't do that,<br/>
🎧 pull</span> the other books on the shelf</span> aside</span> so that you can hold</span> the whole cover</span>.<br/>
🎧 When did you learn all this?<br/>
🎧 He watched</span> me pull</span> a heavy</span> book off the shelf</span> when I was small,<br/>
🎧 and it fell</span> on the floor</span> and broke</span> apart</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh dear</span>!<br/>
🎧 Ah..</span>. I can still remember it!<br/>
🎧 You know what I really like?<br/>
🎧 What?<br/>
🎧 The smell</span> of new books.<br/>
🎧 Me too.<br/>
🎧 My parents</span> used to laugh</span> at me when I was a kid</span> because I loved putting</span> books up to my nose</span>.<br/>
🎧 Almost as much as reading</span> them!<br/>
🎧 New books aren't cheap</span>, though, are they?<br/>
🎧 I guess</span> we're lucky</span> we can buy them.<br/>
🎧 My grandfather</span> stocks</span> second-hand</span> books as well as new ones<br/></span>
🎧 and they don't smell</span> quite as good.<br/>
🎧 I'd love to have a bookshop</span> like your grandfather</span>.<br/>
🎧 What's it like?<br/>
🎧 Well, it's quite big.<br/>
🎧 It's got two floors</span> and an attic</span>,<br/>
🎧 and he stocks</span> all kinds</span> of books really.<br/>
🎧 I guess</span> he treasures</span> things like first editions</span> and other rare</span> books.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, you might think he'd keep those in the attic</span> or somewhere..</span>.<br/>
🎧 So they'd be hidden</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 But he likes people to know that he has them.<br/>
🎧 So, he puts</span> them out in the shop</span> but makes sure you need a ladder</span> to get them.<br/>
🎧 Right. That would prevent</span> any thefts</span>!<br/>
🎧 Does he stock</span> books for children?<br/>
🎧 He does.<br/>
🎧 He particularly</span> likes to encourage</span> kids</span> to read;<br/></span>
🎧 he always says that he used to sit under the stairs</span> as a child</span> with a pile</span> of books and read them all.<br/>
🎧 Is that where he keeps</span> them, then?<br/>
🎧 Not exactly.<br/>
🎧 He's got a dedicated</span> area</span> on the ground</span> floor</span> with cushions<br/></span>
🎧 so that parents</span> can enter</span> with their toddlers</span>,<br/>
🎧 go there and spend</span> some time reading</span> to them.<br/>
🎧 Oh cool</span>.<br/>
🎧 And then there's a place for pushchairs</span> by the front</span> door</span>.<br/>
🎧 And a café</span> if anyone</span> needs refreshments</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's good to know.<br/>
🎧 As I said, it's a big shop<br/></span>
🎧 and there's a storage</span> area</span> out the back as well.<br/>
🎧 Oh, what does he keep there?<br/>
🎧 Books he wants</span> to throw</span> away?<br/>
🎧 He hardly</span> ever throws</span> anything away.<br/>
🎧 He just leaves unwanted</span> books by the front</span> door</span> for customers</span> to take.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's very nice.<br/>
🎧 And books people or institutions</span> have requested</span>, they all go at the far</span> end.<br/>
🎧 He thinks</span> it's best to keep these out of the main</span> shopping</span> area</span> as they're boxed</span> and new.<br/>
🎧 Did you get your coursebooks</span> from him?<br/>
🎧 Naturally</span>.<br/>
🎧 He stocks</span> books for a lot of the colleges</span>.<br/>
🎧 He used to keep these books on the first floor</span>,<br/>
🎧 but now there's a new university in my hometown</span>,<br/>
🎧 he's moved</span> them downstairs</span> to attract</span> the students.<br/>
🎧 They're actually part</span> of the coffee</span> shop</span>, on low shelves</span> all around it.<br/>
🎧 Pretty</span> central</span> then.<br/>
🎧 You'll have to take me there some time!<br/>

🎧 Tree</span> planting</span> now dominates</span> political</span> and popular</span> agendas<br/></span>
🎧 and is often presented</span> as an easy answer to the climate</span> crisis</span>,<br/>
🎧 as well as a way for business</span> corporations</span> to offset</span> their carbon</span> emissions</span>.<br/>
🎧 But unfortunately</span>, tree</span> planting</span> isn't as straightforward</span> as some people think.<br/>
🎧 When the wrong trees</span> are planted</span> in the wrong place,<br/>
🎧 it can do considerably</span> more damage</span> than good,<br/>
🎧 failing</span> to help either people or the environment</span>.<br/>
🎧 Reforestation</span> projects</span> are currently</span> being undertaken</span> on a huge</span> scale</span> in many countries<br/></span>
🎧 and it's crucial</span> that the right trees</span> are selected</span>.<br/>
🎧 A mix of species</span> should always be planted</span>,<br/>
🎧 typical</span> of the local</span> natural</span> forest</span> ecosystem<br/></span>
🎧 and including</span> rare</span> and endangered</span> species</span> in order to create</span> a rich</span> ecosystem</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's important to avoid</span> non-native</span> species</span> that could become invasive</span>.<br/>
🎧 Invasive</span> species</span> are a significant</span> contributor</span> to the current</span> global</span> biodiversity</span> crisis<br/></span>
🎧 and are often in competition</span> with native</span> species<br/></span>
🎧 and may threaten</span> their long-term</span> survival</span>.<br/>
🎧 Restoring</span> biodiversity</span> that will maximise</span> carbon</span> capture</span> is key when reforesting</span> an area</span>,<br/>
🎧 but ideally</span> any reforestation</span> project</span> should have several</span> goals</span>.<br/>
🎧 These could include</span> selecting</span> trees</span> that can contribute</span> to wildlife</span> conservation</span>,<br/>
🎧 improve</span> the availability</span> of food for the local</span> community<br/></span>
🎧 and maintain</span> the stability</span> of soil</span> systems</span>.<br/>
🎧 Meeting</span> as many of these goals</span> as possible</span>,<br/>
🎧 whilst</span> doing no harm</span> to local</span> communities</span>, native</span> ecosystems</span> and vulnerable</span> species</span>,<br/>
🎧 is the sign</span> of a highly</span> successful</span> tree-planting</span> scheme</span>.<br/>
🎧 To ensure</span> the survival</span> and resilience</span> of a planted</span> forest</span>,<br/>
🎧 it's vital</span> to use tree</span> seeds</span> with appropriate</span> levels</span> of genetic</span> diversity</span>:<br/>
🎧 the amount of genetic</span> variation</span> found</span> within</span> a species</span> essential</span> for their survival</span>.<br/>
🎧 Using</span> seeds</span> with low genetic</span> diversity</span> generally</span> lowers</span> the resilience</span> of restored</span> forests</span>,<br/>
🎧 which can make them vulnerable</span> to disease</span> and unable</span> to adapt</span> to climate</span> change.<br/>
🎧 Choosing</span> the right location</span> for reforestation</span> projects</span> is as important as choosing</span> the right trees</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ultimately</span>, the best area</span> for planting</span> trees</span> would be in formerly</span> forested</span> areas</span> that are in poor</span> condition</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's better to avoid</span> non-forested</span> landscapes</span> such as natural</span> grasslands</span>, savannas</span> or wetlands<br/></span>
🎧 as these ecosystems</span> already contribute</span> greatly</span> to capturing</span> carbon</span>.<br/>
🎧 It would also be advantageous</span> to choose an area</span> where trees</span> could provide</span> other benefits</span>,<br/>
🎧 such as recreational</span> spaces</span>.<br/>
🎧 Reforesting</span> areas</span> which are currently</span> exploited</span> for agriculture</span> should be avoided<br/></span>
🎧 as this often leads</span> to other areas</span> being deforested</span>.<br/>
🎧 Large-scale</span> reforestation</span> projects</span> require</span> careful</span> planning.<br/>
🎧 Making</span> the right decisions</span> about where to plant</span> trees</span> depends</span> on having the right information</span>.<br/>
🎧 Having detailed</span> and up-to-date</span> maps</span> identifying</span> high-priority</span> areas</span> for intervention</span> is essential</span>.<br/>
🎧 Drone</span> technology</span> is a useful</span> tool</span> in helping</span> to prioritise</span> and monitor</span> areas</span> of degraded</span> forest</span> for restoration</span>.<br/>
🎧 In Brazil</span>, it's being used to identify</span> and quantify</span> how parts</span> of the Amazon</span> are being devastated</span> by human</span> activities<br/></span>
🎧 such as rearing</span> cattle</span> and illegal</span> logging</span>.<br/>
🎧 A good example of where the right trees</span> were picked</span> to achieve</span> a restored</span> forest<br/></span>
🎧 is in Lampang</span> Province</span> in Northern</span> Thailand</span>.<br/>
🎧 A previously</span> forested</span> site</span> which had been degraded</span> through mining<br/></span>
🎧 was reforested</span> by a cement</span> company together with Chiang</span> Mai</span> University.<br/>
🎧 After spreading</span> 60</span> cm</span> of topsoil</span>,<br/>
🎧 they planted</span> 14</span> different native</span> tree</span> species<br/></span>
🎧 which included</span> several</span> species</span> of fig.<br/>
🎧 Figs</span> are a keystone</span> species<br/></span>
🎧 because of the critical</span> role</span> they play in maintaining</span> wildlife</span> populations</span>.<br/>
🎧 They are central</span> to tropical</span> reforestation</span> projects<br/></span>
🎧 as they accelerate</span> the speed</span> of the recovery</span> process<br/></span>
🎧 by attracting</span> animals</span> and birds</span> which act as natural</span> seed</span> dispersers</span>.<br/>
🎧 This helps to promote</span> diversity</span> through the healthy</span> regrowth</span> of a wide</span> range</span> of plant</span> species</span>.<br/>
🎧 Unlike</span> the majority</span> of fruit</span> trees</span>,<br/>
🎧 figs</span> bear</span> fruit</span> all year round</span>, providing</span> a reliable</span> food source</span> for many species</span>.<br/>
🎧 At this site</span>, for example, after only three</span> rainy</span> seasons</span>,<br/>
🎧 monkeys</span> started</span> visiting</span> to eat the fig fruits</span>,<br/>
🎧 naturally</span> dispersing</span> seeds</span> through defecation</span>.<br/>
🎧 Reforestation</span> projects</span> should always aim</span> to make sure that..</span>.<br/>
🎧 local</span> communities</span> are consulted</span> and involved</span> in the decision-making</span> process</span>.<br/>
🎧 The restoration</span> of mangrove</span> forests</span> in Madagascar<br/></span>
🎧 is an example of a project</span> which has succeeded</span> in creating</span> real</span> benefits</span> for the community</span>.<br/>
🎧 Destruction</span> of the mangrove</span> forests</span> had a terrible</span> impact</span> on plant</span> and animal</span> life,<br/>
🎧 and also badly</span> affected</span> the fishing</span> industry</span>,<br/>
🎧 which was a major</span> source</span> of employment</span> for local</span> people living in coastal</span> areas</span>.<br/>
🎧 The reforestation</span> project</span> involved</span> hiring</span> local</span> people to plant</span> and care</span> for the new mangrove</span> trees</span>.<br/>
🎧 Millions</span> of mangrove</span> trees</span> have now been planted<br/></span>
🎧 which has resulted</span> in the return</span> of a healthy</span> aquatic</span> ecosystem</span>.<br/>
🎧 The mangroves</span> also act as a defence</span> against</span> the increased</span> threat</span> of flooding</span> caused</span> by climate</span> change.<br/>
🎧 What's more, the local</span> economy</span> is more stable<br/></span>
🎧 and thousands</span> more Madagascans</span> are now able to send</span> their children to school.<br/>
🎧 One other important point..</span>.<br/>
