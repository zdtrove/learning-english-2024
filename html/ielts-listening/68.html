🎧 Hello <span>Charlotte</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>Kaeden</span>, one of the <span>supervisors</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Welcome</span> to the <span>team</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hi <span>Aiden</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>Kaeden</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm so sorry.<br/>
🎧 Don't <span>worry</span>.<br/>
🎧 People often get my name <span>wrong;<br/></span>
🎧 they never know how to <span>spell</span> it.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>KAEDEN</span>, in case you ever need to <span>write</span> it.<br/>
🎧 I'll try and remember.<br/>
🎧 So, there are a few <span>practical</span> things you need to <span>sort</span> out this morning.<br/>
🎧 Then I'll show you what you're going to do today.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ah..</span>. the <span>email</span> I <span>received</span> said to go to the <span>front</span> <span>desk</span>, to show my <span>letter</span> of <span>appointment</span> and <span>pick</span> up my <span>badge</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll need that for the <span>staffroom</span> and other <span>areas</span> of the <span>supermarket</span> where <span>shoppers</span> aren't <span>allowed</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, after you've <span>finished</span> at the <span>front</span> <span>desk</span>, I'll take you to the <span>staffroom</span>.<br/>
🎧 Put your <span>coat</span> and <span>rucksack</span> in one of the <span>lockers</span> there.<br/>
🎧 Take <span>whichever</span> one is free.<br/>
🎧 Will I have a key?<br/>
🎧 Yes. Try not to <span>lose</span> it.<br/>
🎧 At the end of the day, leave it in the <span>door</span> for the next person to use.<br/>
🎧 Will do.<br/>
🎧 You also need to go to the <span>HR</span> <span>department</span> to see <span>Tiffany</span>.<br/>
🎧 She's really <span>helpful</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was told to <span>bring</span> my <span>passport</span> with me.<br/>
🎧 <span>HR</span> need to take a <span>note</span> of the number in it.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 Or you can show your <span>ID</span> <span>card</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't have one of those.<br/>
🎧 Okay. <span>Tiffany</span> will give you a <span>uniform</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ah..</span>. They have lots in different <span>sizes</span>, so you just tell her what you need.<br/>
🎧 I won't come with you to <span>HR</span>. I've got to go and <span>sort</span> something else out.<br/>
🎧 <span>Uhm..</span>. <span>problem</span> with a <span>bread</span> <span>slicer</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is the <span>HR</span> <span>office</span> near the <span>staffroom</span>?<br/>
🎧 The <span>staffroom's</span> on the first <span>floor</span>, and <span>HR</span> are a <span>couple</span> of <span>floors</span> <span>above</span> that, on the <span>third</span> <span>floor</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>staircase</span> outside the <span>staffroom</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 When you've <span>finished</span> with <span>HR</span>, come and find me in the <span>bakery</span> <span>section</span> of the <span>shop</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm looking forward to getting <span>started</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll just give you my phone number, in case you can't find me.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ah..</span>. have you got your phone there?<br/>
🎧 <span>Yes..</span>. Okay, ready.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>0412665903</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, done.<br/>
🎧 So, <span>Charlotte</span>, your <span>tasks</span> today are in the <span>bakery</span> <span>section</span>,<br/>
🎧 on the <span>sushi</span> <span>counter</span>, and on the <span>meat</span> and <span>fish</span> <span>counters</span>.<br/>
🎧 The first <span>job</span> is to check <span>sell-by</span> <span>dates</span> on the <span>bread</span> and <span>cakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 If any of the <span>dates</span> are <span>today's</span>, put a new <span>price</span> <span>label</span> on the <span>packaging</span>.<br/>
🎧 What if any of the <span>labels</span> are <span>yesterday's</span> <span>dates</span>, or <span>older</span>?<br/>
🎧 Do I <span>throw</span> those <span>items</span> away?<br/>
🎧 Yes, but that shouldn't <span>happen</span>, we check the <span>stock</span> every day.<br/>
🎧 When something needs a new <span>price</span> <span>label</span>,<br/>
🎧 put a <span>yellow</span> one on the <span>package</span>, next to the <span>original</span> <span>price</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 After that, you'll go to the <span>sushi</span> <span>takeaway</span> <span>counter</span>.<br/>
🎧 Will I be <span>preparing</span> <span>boxes</span> of food?<br/>
🎧 <span>Ah..</span>. for today, you'll just be <span>helping</span> the <span>staff</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, of course.<br/>
🎧 You'll see lots of <span>flat</span> <span>cardboard</span> <span>boxes</span> at one end of the <span>counter</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Beneath</span> those is where we keep the <span>plastic</span> <span>boxes</span>,<br/>
🎧 we run out of those really quickly, so you should <span>bring</span> more from the <span>storeroom</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is that my only <span>task</span> on the <span>sushi</span> <span>counter</span>?<br/>
🎧 No. You also need to <span>clean</span> the <span>area</span> where they <span>prepare</span> the <span>dishes</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>cloths</span> and <span>bottles</span> of <span>spray</span> by the <span>sink</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and please make sure you <span>clean</span> that too.<br/>
🎧 Sure. That's important, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Absolutely. But you mustn't <span>wash</span> up <span>knives</span>.<br/>
🎧 You have to do some <span>training</span> before you're <span>allowed</span> to touch <span>sharp</span> <span>objects</span>.<br/>
🎧 What should I do if there are any?<br/>
🎧 Ask <span>someone</span> to put them in the <span>dishwasher</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, thanks.<br/>
🎧 I don't want to get anything wrong.<br/>
🎧 Don't <span>worry</span>. You'll be fine.<br/>
🎧 And I'll be around to help.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Finally, the <span>meat</span> and <span>fish</span> <span>counters</span>.<br/>
🎧 You need to <span>clean</span> the <span>area</span> where <span>staff</span> <span>serve</span> <span>customers</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>including</span> <span>wiping</span> the <span>weighing</span> <span>scales</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Anything else?<br/>
🎧 The <span>fish</span> is <span>laid</span> on ice, but when that <span>starts</span> to <span>melt</span>, you'll need to get more from the <span>cold-room</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know the <span>staff</span> on the food <span>counters</span> <span>wear</span> a hat.<br/>
🎧 Will that be the same for me?<br/>
🎧 You won't be <span>serving</span> <span>customers</span> <span>directly</span>, so no.<br/>
🎧 But make sure you put on <span>thermal</span> <span>gloves</span> when you take anything out of the <span>cold-room</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>temperature's</span> low enough in there to get <span>frostbite</span> from <span>touching</span> things.<br/>
🎧 <span>Understood</span>.<br/>

🎧 My <span>name's</span> <span>Liz</span> <span>Fuller</span> and I'm a <span>running</span> <span>coach</span> with <span>Compton</span> <span>Park</span> <span>Runners</span> <span>Club</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Welcome</span> to my <span>podcast</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you're thinking about taking up <span>running</span> <span>-</span> I'm here to help.<br/>
🎧 There are many <span>training</span> <span>programmes</span> <span>available</span> online which <span>aim</span> to help people <span>build</span> up to <span>running</span> <span>5</span> <span>kilometres</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some of them are <span>great<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>thousands</span> of people of all <span>ages</span> are taking <span>part</span> in <span>5-kilometre</span> <span>races</span> across the <span>country</span> as a <span>result</span>.<br/>
🎧 People like them because they're easy to <span>follow</span> and don't <span>push</span> them too <span>hard</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, they don't work for everyone,<br/>
🎧 <span>especially</span> if you <span>suffer</span> from something like a <span>heart</span> <span>condition</span> or <span>asthma</span>,<br/>
🎧 because they're <span>aimed</span> at people with <span>average</span> <span>fitness</span> and <span>running</span> <span>ability</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another thing is that everyone is <span>different<br/></span>
🎧 and if you have any <span>specific</span> <span>questions</span> <span>related</span> to your needs,<br/>
🎧 there's no one to <span>provide</span> any <span>answers</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have a <span>couple</span> of simple <span>tips</span> I always give to new <span>runners</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>expect</span> you've been told to run very <span>slowly</span> until your <span>fitness</span> <span>increases</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, I find that can <span>prevent</span> <span>progress</span>.<br/>
🎧 You should run at a <span>speed</span> that <span>feels</span> <span>comfortable</span>,<br/>
🎧 but time yourself and try to run a bit <span>faster</span> each time.<br/>
🎧 <span>Listening</span> to music can be very <span>helpful</span>.<br/>
🎧 It takes your <span>mind</span> off things and helps your <span>body</span> get into a <span>rhythm</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd say that is better than <span>running</span> with a friend,<br/>
🎧 <span>especially</span> as most people are <span>competitive<br/></span>
🎧 and that's not what you want when you're just <span>starting</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't think the time of day is <span>especially</span> important.<br/>
🎧 Some people are better in the <span>evening</span>, while <span>others</span> are morning <span>people<br/></span>
🎧 but you need to be <span>consistent</span>, so <span>aim</span> to <span>train</span> <span>regularly</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Twice</span> a week is enough to <span>begin</span> with.<br/>
🎧 New <span>members</span> often say to me that <span>they've</span> been put off <span>running</span> either because they <span>lack</span> <span>confidence</span>,<br/>
🎧 or they don't have time,<br/>
🎧 or they think they <span>dislike</span> <span>running</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ceri</span>, for example, <span>joined</span> the <span>club</span> two years ago at the age of <span>40</span>.<br/>
🎧 She'd always <span>enjoyed</span> <span>running</span> at school but wasn't sure if she'd be able to do it.<br/>
🎧 She was <span>worried</span> about being <span>left</span> behind and being the <span>slowest</span> <span>runner</span>.<br/>
🎧 But she says she was made to feel so <span>welcome</span> she soon <span>forgot</span> all about that.<br/>
🎧 <span>James</span> had always <span>hated</span> the idea of <span>running<br/></span>
🎧 but a friend <span>encouraged</span> him to come along for a <span>taster</span> <span>session<br/></span>
🎧 and he hasn't <span>looked</span> back.<br/>
🎧 He never <span>misses</span> a <span>training</span> <span>session</span> <span>despite</span> having a really <span>demanding</span> <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Leo</span> was <span>worried</span> about having to <span>commit</span> <span>himself</span> to <span>training</span> <span>sessions</span> every <span>week<br/></span>
🎧 and wasn't sure he'd be able to fit <span>training</span> into his <span>busy</span> <span>schedule</span>.<br/>
🎧 But after <span>experiencing</span> a lot of <span>stress</span> at <span>work<br/></span>
🎧 he came along to us and gave it a go.<br/>
🎧 Now he says he <span>feels</span> much more <span>relaxed</span> and he looks forward to his <span>weekly</span> run.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mark</span> is quite <span>typical</span> of our new <span>members</span>.<br/>
🎧 He's never <span>considered</span> <span>himself</span> to be a <span>sporty</span> <span>person<br/></span>
🎧 and it was only when he <span>retired</span> that he <span>decided</span> to take up the <span>challenge</span> of trying to run <span>5</span> <span>kilometres</span>.<br/>
🎧 It took him <span>months</span> to find the <span>courage</span> to <span>contact</span> us but <span>felt</span> <span>reassured</span> <span>immediately<br/></span>
🎧 as there were other people his age who were only just taking up <span>running</span> for the first time.<br/>
🎧 My own <span>journey</span> hasn't been easy.<br/>
🎧 I did my first <span>marathon</span> when I was <span>37</span>, after having had two <span>kids</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>husband</span> had been <span>running</span> <span>marathons</span> for years,<br/>
🎧 but I never <span>dreamed</span> I'd be doing one with him.<br/>
🎧 I <span>managed</span> to <span>complete</span> it in <span>four</span> hours,<br/>
🎧 but I <span>felt</span> like <span>giving</span> up <span>halfway</span> through.<br/>
🎧 It was only the <span>support</span> of the <span>spectators</span> that <span>kept</span> me going.<br/>
🎧 I do think <span>signing</span> up for a <span>race</span> of whatever <span>length</span> is <span>motivating<br/></span>
🎧 <span>whether</span> it's <span>5K</span> or <span>25K<br/></span>
🎧 because it's good to have something to work <span>towards<br/></span>
🎧 and it <span>gives</span> you a <span>sense</span> of <span>achievement</span>.<br/>
🎧 I did my first <span>10K</span> after only six <span>months</span>,<br/>
🎧 which was <span>certainly</span> very <span>challenging</span> and not something I'd <span>necessarily</span> <span>recommend</span>.<br/>
🎧 But after you've been <span>training</span> for a few <span>weeks</span>, it's <span>worth</span> <span>putting</span> your name down for a <span>5K</span>.<br/>
🎧 some people find they only need a few practice <span>runs</span> before taking <span>part</span> in a <span>race</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I'd give yourself a <span>couple</span> of <span>months</span> at <span>least</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, I hope that's <span>given..</span>.<br/>

🎧 So <span>Jane</span> you'll be off to <span>Denmark</span> soon to do your work <span>placement</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I'm really looking forward to <span>it<br/></span>
🎧 and I've just <span>started</span> <span>packing</span> up all my books to put in <span>storage</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, I hope they don't get <span>spoilt</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's okay, my <span>grandfather</span> <span>works</span> in a <span>bookshop<br/></span>
🎧 and he told me how to <span>pack</span> them.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's <span>helpful</span>.<br/>
🎧 He says you have to <span>support</span> the <span>spine<br/></span>
🎧 <span>otherwise</span> the <span>paper</span> can come away from the <span>cover</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah that's <span>obvious</span>.<br/>
🎧 He also told me to <span>pack</span> them <span>flat</span> in the box, not on their side,<br/>
🎧 again because they can <span>bend<br/></span>
🎧 and if you leave them like that for, say, a year,<br/>
🎧 it's quite <span>hard</span> to get them back to their <span>normal</span> <span>shape</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, it's <span>pretty</span> <span>clear</span> that <span>ruins</span> them,<br/>
🎧 but a lot of people just can't be <span>bothered</span> to <span>protect</span> their books.<br/>
🎧 He always says it's such a <span>shame</span> that <span>publishers</span> don't use <span>better-quality</span> <span>paper</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's the <span>acid</span> in the <span>paper</span> that <span>causes</span> the <span>problem</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, that's why old books go <span>yellow</span>.<br/>
🎧 You know some of the books my <span>grandfather's</span> <span>given</span> me are like that already.<br/>
🎧 I should <span>dump</span> them really if they're going to <span>deteriorate</span> <span>further</span>, but I'd feel bad.<br/>
🎧 They'll always <span>remind</span> me of him.<br/>
🎧 He's quite a <span>collector</span>, you know.<br/>
🎧 Well, if they're important to <span>you..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I'd <span>regret</span> just <span>throwing</span> them away.<br/>
🎧 You know, maybe it's because I was <span>taught</span> to <span>treasure</span> <span>books..</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I <span>hate</span> <span>seeing</span> students <span>force</span> open the <span>pages</span> of <span>paperbacks</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>press</span> so <span>hard</span> they end up <span>breaking</span> the <span>spine</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know,<br/>
🎧 but <span>unfortunately</span>, <span>paperbacks</span> aren't <span>designed</span> to last a long time and people know that.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hardbacks</span> aren't quite as <span>weak</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, they're different, I <span>suppose</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I still don't think people <span>value</span> <span>hardbacks</span> like they used to.<br/>
🎧 Well, they aren't <span>decorative</span>, are they, like other <span>objects</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Plus</span>, <span>nowadays</span>, people don't keep them out on <span>shelves</span> as much as they used to.<br/>
🎧 That's such a <span>pity</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I visit <span>someone</span>,<br/>
🎧 if they have, say, a <span>colourful</span> book on a <span>table</span>, it's the first thing I'm <span>drawn</span> to.<br/>
🎧 I agree,<br/>
🎧 and book <span>covers</span> can be a work of <span>art</span> in <span>themselves</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some are really <span>eye-catching</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've always been <span>taught</span> to <span>handle</span> books <span>carefully</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you <span>watch</span> <span>someone</span> take a book off a <span>shelf</span>, well, they usually do it wrong.<br/>
🎧 Ah, my <span>grandfather</span> says, you should put your <span>hand</span> right over the top of the <span>book..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Or, if you can't do that,<br/>
🎧 <span>pull</span> the other books on the <span>shelf</span> <span>aside</span> so that you can <span>hold</span> the whole <span>cover</span>.<br/>
🎧 When did you learn all this?<br/>
🎧 He <span>watched</span> me <span>pull</span> a <span>heavy</span> book off the <span>shelf</span> when I was small,<br/>
🎧 and it <span>fell</span> on the <span>floor</span> and <span>broke</span> <span>apart</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>dear</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Ah..</span>. I can still remember it!<br/>
🎧 You know what I really like?<br/>
🎧 What?<br/>
🎧 The <span>smell</span> of new books.<br/>
🎧 Me too.<br/>
🎧 My <span>parents</span> used to <span>laugh</span> at me when I was a <span>kid</span> because I loved <span>putting</span> books up to my <span>nose</span>.<br/>
🎧 Almost as much as <span>reading</span> them!<br/>
🎧 New books aren't <span>cheap</span>, though, are they?<br/>
🎧 I <span>guess</span> we're <span>lucky</span> we can buy them.<br/>
🎧 My <span>grandfather</span> <span>stocks</span> <span>second-hand</span> books as well as new <span>ones<br/></span>
🎧 and they don't <span>smell</span> quite as good.<br/>
🎧 I'd love to have a <span>bookshop</span> like your <span>grandfather</span>.<br/>
🎧 What's it like?<br/>
🎧 Well, it's quite big.<br/>
🎧 It's got two <span>floors</span> and an <span>attic</span>,<br/>
🎧 and he <span>stocks</span> all <span>kinds</span> of books really.<br/>
🎧 I <span>guess</span> he <span>treasures</span> things like first <span>editions</span> and other <span>rare</span> books.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, you might think he'd keep those in the <span>attic</span> or <span>somewhere..</span>.<br/>
🎧 So they'd be <span>hidden</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 But he likes people to know that he has them.<br/>
🎧 So, he <span>puts</span> them out in the <span>shop</span> but makes sure you need a <span>ladder</span> to get them.<br/>
🎧 Right. That would <span>prevent</span> any <span>thefts</span>!<br/>
🎧 Does he <span>stock</span> books for children?<br/>
🎧 He does.<br/>
🎧 He <span>particularly</span> likes to <span>encourage</span> <span>kids</span> to <span>read;<br/></span>
🎧 he always says that he used to sit under the <span>stairs</span> as a <span>child</span> with a <span>pile</span> of books and read them all.<br/>
🎧 Is that where he <span>keeps</span> them, then?<br/>
🎧 Not exactly.<br/>
🎧 He's got a <span>dedicated</span> <span>area</span> on the <span>ground</span> <span>floor</span> with <span>cushions<br/></span>
🎧 so that <span>parents</span> can <span>enter</span> with their <span>toddlers</span>,<br/>
🎧 go there and <span>spend</span> some time <span>reading</span> to them.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>cool</span>.<br/>
🎧 And then there's a place for <span>pushchairs</span> by the <span>front</span> <span>door</span>.<br/>
🎧 And a <span>café</span> if <span>anyone</span> needs <span>refreshments</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's good to know.<br/>
🎧 As I said, it's a big <span>shop<br/></span>
🎧 and there's a <span>storage</span> <span>area</span> out the back as well.<br/>
🎧 Oh, what does he keep there?<br/>
🎧 Books he <span>wants</span> to <span>throw</span> away?<br/>
🎧 He <span>hardly</span> ever <span>throws</span> anything away.<br/>
🎧 He just leaves <span>unwanted</span> books by the <span>front</span> <span>door</span> for <span>customers</span> to take.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's very nice.<br/>
🎧 And books people or <span>institutions</span> have <span>requested</span>, they all go at the <span>far</span> end.<br/>
🎧 He <span>thinks</span> it's best to keep these out of the <span>main</span> <span>shopping</span> <span>area</span> as they're <span>boxed</span> and new.<br/>
🎧 Did you get your <span>coursebooks</span> from him?<br/>
🎧 <span>Naturally</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>stocks</span> books for a lot of the <span>colleges</span>.<br/>
🎧 He used to keep these books on the first <span>floor</span>,<br/>
🎧 but now there's a new university in my <span>hometown</span>,<br/>
🎧 he's <span>moved</span> them <span>downstairs</span> to <span>attract</span> the students.<br/>
🎧 They're actually <span>part</span> of the <span>coffee</span> <span>shop</span>, on low <span>shelves</span> all around it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Pretty</span> <span>central</span> then.<br/>
🎧 You'll have to take me there some time!<br/>

🎧 <span>Tree</span> <span>planting</span> now <span>dominates</span> <span>political</span> and <span>popular</span> <span>agendas<br/></span>
🎧 and is often <span>presented</span> as an easy answer to the <span>climate</span> <span>crisis</span>,<br/>
🎧 as well as a way for <span>business</span> <span>corporations</span> to <span>offset</span> their <span>carbon</span> <span>emissions</span>.<br/>
🎧 But <span>unfortunately</span>, <span>tree</span> <span>planting</span> isn't as <span>straightforward</span> as some people think.<br/>
🎧 When the wrong <span>trees</span> are <span>planted</span> in the wrong place,<br/>
🎧 it can do <span>considerably</span> more <span>damage</span> than good,<br/>
🎧 <span>failing</span> to help either people or the <span>environment</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Reforestation</span> <span>projects</span> are <span>currently</span> being <span>undertaken</span> on a <span>huge</span> <span>scale</span> in many <span>countries<br/></span>
🎧 and it's <span>crucial</span> that the right <span>trees</span> are <span>selected</span>.<br/>
🎧 A mix of <span>species</span> should always be <span>planted</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>typical</span> of the <span>local</span> <span>natural</span> <span>forest</span> <span>ecosystem<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>including</span> <span>rare</span> and <span>endangered</span> <span>species</span> in order to <span>create</span> a <span>rich</span> <span>ecosystem</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's important to <span>avoid</span> <span>non-native</span> <span>species</span> that could become <span>invasive</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Invasive</span> <span>species</span> are a <span>significant</span> <span>contributor</span> to the <span>current</span> <span>global</span> <span>biodiversity</span> <span>crisis<br/></span>
🎧 and are often in <span>competition</span> with <span>native</span> <span>species<br/></span>
🎧 and may <span>threaten</span> their <span>long-term</span> <span>survival</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Restoring</span> <span>biodiversity</span> that will <span>maximise</span> <span>carbon</span> <span>capture</span> is key when <span>reforesting</span> an <span>area</span>,<br/>
🎧 but <span>ideally</span> any <span>reforestation</span> <span>project</span> should have <span>several</span> <span>goals</span>.<br/>
🎧 These could <span>include</span> <span>selecting</span> <span>trees</span> that can <span>contribute</span> to <span>wildlife</span> <span>conservation</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>improve</span> the <span>availability</span> of food for the <span>local</span> <span>community<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>maintain</span> the <span>stability</span> of <span>soil</span> <span>systems</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Meeting</span> as many of these <span>goals</span> as <span>possible</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>whilst</span> doing no <span>harm</span> to <span>local</span> <span>communities</span>, <span>native</span> <span>ecosystems</span> and <span>vulnerable</span> <span>species</span>,<br/>
🎧 is the <span>sign</span> of a <span>highly</span> <span>successful</span> <span>tree-planting</span> <span>scheme</span>.<br/>
🎧 To <span>ensure</span> the <span>survival</span> and <span>resilience</span> of a <span>planted</span> <span>forest</span>,<br/>
🎧 it's <span>vital</span> to use <span>tree</span> <span>seeds</span> with <span>appropriate</span> <span>levels</span> of <span>genetic</span> <span>diversity</span>:<br/>
🎧 the amount of <span>genetic</span> <span>variation</span> <span>found</span> <span>within</span> a <span>species</span> <span>essential</span> for their <span>survival</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Using</span> <span>seeds</span> with low <span>genetic</span> <span>diversity</span> <span>generally</span> <span>lowers</span> the <span>resilience</span> of <span>restored</span> <span>forests</span>,<br/>
🎧 which can make them <span>vulnerable</span> to <span>disease</span> and <span>unable</span> to <span>adapt</span> to <span>climate</span> change.<br/>
🎧 <span>Choosing</span> the right <span>location</span> for <span>reforestation</span> <span>projects</span> is as important as <span>choosing</span> the right <span>trees</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ultimately</span>, the best <span>area</span> for <span>planting</span> <span>trees</span> would be in <span>formerly</span> <span>forested</span> <span>areas</span> that are in <span>poor</span> <span>condition</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's better to <span>avoid</span> <span>non-forested</span> <span>landscapes</span> such as <span>natural</span> <span>grasslands</span>, <span>savannas</span> or <span>wetlands<br/></span>
🎧 as these <span>ecosystems</span> already <span>contribute</span> <span>greatly</span> to <span>capturing</span> <span>carbon</span>.<br/>
🎧 It would also be <span>advantageous</span> to choose an <span>area</span> where <span>trees</span> could <span>provide</span> other <span>benefits</span>,<br/>
🎧 such as <span>recreational</span> <span>spaces</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Reforesting</span> <span>areas</span> which are <span>currently</span> <span>exploited</span> for <span>agriculture</span> should be <span>avoided<br/></span>
🎧 as this often <span>leads</span> to other <span>areas</span> being <span>deforested</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Large-scale</span> <span>reforestation</span> <span>projects</span> <span>require</span> <span>careful</span> planning.<br/>
🎧 <span>Making</span> the right <span>decisions</span> about where to <span>plant</span> <span>trees</span> <span>depends</span> on having the right <span>information</span>.<br/>
🎧 Having <span>detailed</span> and <span>up-to-date</span> <span>maps</span> <span>identifying</span> <span>high-priority</span> <span>areas</span> for <span>intervention</span> is <span>essential</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Drone</span> <span>technology</span> is a <span>useful</span> <span>tool</span> in <span>helping</span> to <span>prioritise</span> and <span>monitor</span> <span>areas</span> of <span>degraded</span> <span>forest</span> for <span>restoration</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>Brazil</span>, it's being used to <span>identify</span> and <span>quantify</span> how <span>parts</span> of the <span>Amazon</span> are being <span>devastated</span> by <span>human</span> <span>activities<br/></span>
🎧 such as <span>rearing</span> <span>cattle</span> and <span>illegal</span> <span>logging</span>.<br/>
🎧 A good example of where the right <span>trees</span> were <span>picked</span> to <span>achieve</span> a <span>restored</span> <span>forest<br/></span>
🎧 is in <span>Lampang</span> <span>Province</span> in <span>Northern</span> <span>Thailand</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>previously</span> <span>forested</span> <span>site</span> which had been <span>degraded</span> through <span>mining<br/></span>
🎧 was <span>reforested</span> by a <span>cement</span> company together with <span>Chiang</span> <span>Mai</span> University.<br/>
🎧 After <span>spreading</span> <span>60</span> <span>cm</span> of <span>topsoil</span>,<br/>
🎧 they <span>planted</span> <span>14</span> different <span>native</span> <span>tree</span> <span>species<br/></span>
🎧 which <span>included</span> <span>several</span> <span>species</span> of fig.<br/>
🎧 <span>Figs</span> are a <span>keystone</span> <span>species<br/></span>
🎧 because of the <span>critical</span> <span>role</span> they play in <span>maintaining</span> <span>wildlife</span> <span>populations</span>.<br/>
🎧 They are <span>central</span> to <span>tropical</span> <span>reforestation</span> <span>projects<br/></span>
🎧 as they <span>accelerate</span> the <span>speed</span> of the <span>recovery</span> <span>process<br/></span>
🎧 by <span>attracting</span> <span>animals</span> and <span>birds</span> which act as <span>natural</span> <span>seed</span> <span>dispersers</span>.<br/>
🎧 This helps to <span>promote</span> <span>diversity</span> through the <span>healthy</span> <span>regrowth</span> of a <span>wide</span> <span>range</span> of <span>plant</span> <span>species</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Unlike</span> the <span>majority</span> of <span>fruit</span> <span>trees</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>figs</span> <span>bear</span> <span>fruit</span> all year <span>round</span>, <span>providing</span> a <span>reliable</span> food <span>source</span> for many <span>species</span>.<br/>
🎧 At this <span>site</span>, for example, after only <span>three</span> <span>rainy</span> <span>seasons</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>monkeys</span> <span>started</span> <span>visiting</span> to eat the fig <span>fruits</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>naturally</span> <span>dispersing</span> <span>seeds</span> through <span>defecation</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Reforestation</span> <span>projects</span> should always <span>aim</span> to make sure <span>that..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>local</span> <span>communities</span> are <span>consulted</span> and <span>involved</span> in the <span>decision-making</span> <span>process</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>restoration</span> of <span>mangrove</span> <span>forests</span> in <span>Madagascar<br/></span>
🎧 is an example of a <span>project</span> which has <span>succeeded</span> in <span>creating</span> <span>real</span> <span>benefits</span> for the <span>community</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Destruction</span> of the <span>mangrove</span> <span>forests</span> had a <span>terrible</span> <span>impact</span> on <span>plant</span> and <span>animal</span> life,<br/>
🎧 and also <span>badly</span> <span>affected</span> the <span>fishing</span> <span>industry</span>,<br/>
🎧 which was a <span>major</span> <span>source</span> of <span>employment</span> for <span>local</span> people living in <span>coastal</span> <span>areas</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>reforestation</span> <span>project</span> <span>involved</span> <span>hiring</span> <span>local</span> people to <span>plant</span> and <span>care</span> for the new <span>mangrove</span> <span>trees</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Millions</span> of <span>mangrove</span> <span>trees</span> have now been <span>planted<br/></span>
🎧 which has <span>resulted</span> in the <span>return</span> of a <span>healthy</span> <span>aquatic</span> <span>ecosystem</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>mangroves</span> also act as a <span>defence</span> <span>against</span> the <span>increased</span> <span>threat</span> of <span>flooding</span> <span>caused</span> by <span>climate</span> change.<br/>
🎧 What's more, the <span>local</span> <span>economy</span> is more <span>stable<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>thousands</span> more <span>Madagascans</span> are now able to <span>send</span> their children to school.<br/>
🎧 One other important <span>point..</span>.<br/>
