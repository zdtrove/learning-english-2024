🎧 Hello Charlotte.<br/>
🎧 I'm Kaeden, one of the supervisors.<br/>
🎧 Welcome to the team.<br/>
🎧 Hi Aiden.<br/>
🎧 It's Kaeden.<br/>
🎧 I'm so sorry.<br/>
🎧 Don't worry.<br/>
🎧 People often get my name wrong;<br/>
🎧 they never know how to spell it.<br/>
🎧 It's KAEDEN, in case you ever need to write it.<br/>
🎧 I'll try and remember.<br/>
🎧 So, there are a few practical things you need to sort out this morning.<br/>
🎧 Then I'll show you what you're going to do today.<br/>
🎧 Ah... the email I received said to go to the front desk, to show my letter of appointment and pick up my badge.<br/>
🎧 You'll need that for the staffroom and other areas of the supermarket where shoppers aren't allowed.<br/>
🎧 So, after you've finished at the front desk, I'll take you to the staffroom.<br/>
🎧 Put your coat and rucksack in one of the lockers there.<br/>
🎧 Take whichever one is free.<br/>
🎧 Will I have a key?<br/>
🎧 Yes. Try not to lose it.<br/>
🎧 At the end of the day, leave it in the door for the next person to use.<br/>
🎧 Will do.<br/>
🎧 You also need to go to the HR department to see Tiffany.<br/>
🎧 She's really helpful.<br/>
🎧 I was told to bring my passport with me.<br/>
🎧 HR need to take a note of the number in it.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 Or you can show your ID card.<br/>
🎧 I don't have one of those.<br/>
🎧 Okay. Tiffany will give you a uniform.<br/>
🎧 Ah... They have lots in different sizes, so you just tell her what you need.<br/>
🎧 I won't come with you to HR. I've got to go and sort something else out.<br/>
🎧 Uhm... problem with a bread slicer.<br/>
🎧 Is the HR office near the staffroom?<br/>
🎧 The staffroom's on the first floor, and HR are a couple of floors above that, on the third floor.<br/>
🎧 There's a staircase outside the staffroom.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 When you've finished with HR, come and find me in the bakery section of the shop.<br/>
🎧 I'm looking forward to getting started.<br/>
🎧 I'll just give you my phone number, in case you can't find me.<br/>
🎧 Ah... have you got your phone there?<br/>
🎧 Yes... Okay, ready.<br/>
🎧 It's 0412665903.<br/>
🎧 Okay, done.<br/>
🎧 So, Charlotte, your tasks today are in the bakery section,<br/>
🎧 on the sushi counter, and on the meat and fish counters.<br/>
🎧 The first job is to check sell-by dates on the bread and cakes.<br/>
🎧 If any of the dates are today's, put a new price label on the packaging.<br/>
🎧 What if any of the labels are yesterday's dates, or older?<br/>
🎧 Do I throw those items away?<br/>
🎧 Yes, but that shouldn't happen, we check the stock every day.<br/>
🎧 When something needs a new price label,<br/>
🎧 put a yellow one on the package, next to the original price.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 After that, you'll go to the sushi takeaway counter.<br/>
🎧 Will I be preparing boxes of food?<br/>
🎧 Ah... for today, you'll just be helping the staff.<br/>
🎧 Yes, of course.<br/>
🎧 You'll see lots of flat cardboard boxes at one end of the counter.<br/>
🎧 Beneath those is where we keep the plastic boxes,<br/>
🎧 we run out of those really quickly, so you should bring more from the storeroom.<br/>
🎧 Is that my only task on the sushi counter?<br/>
🎧 No. You also need to clean the area where they prepare the dishes.<br/>
🎧 There are cloths and bottles of spray by the sink.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and please make sure you clean that too.<br/>
🎧 Sure. That's important, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Absolutely. But you mustn't wash up knives.<br/>
🎧 You have to do some training before you're allowed to touch sharp objects.<br/>
🎧 What should I do if there are any?<br/>
🎧 Ask someone to put them in the dishwasher.<br/>
🎧 Okay, thanks.<br/>
🎧 I don't want to get anything wrong.<br/>
🎧 Don't worry. You'll be fine.<br/>
🎧 And I'll be around to help.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Finally, the meat and fish counters.<br/>
🎧 You need to clean the area where staff serve customers,<br/>
🎧 including wiping the weighing scales.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Anything else?<br/>
🎧 The fish is laid on ice, but when that starts to melt, you'll need to get more from the cold-room.<br/>
🎧 I know the staff on the food counters wear a hat.<br/>
🎧 Will that be the same for me?<br/>
🎧 You won't be serving customers directly, so no.<br/>
🎧 But make sure you put on thermal gloves when you take anything out of the cold-room.<br/>
🎧 The temperature's low enough in there to get frostbite from touching things.<br/>
🎧 Understood.<br/>

🎧 My name's Liz Fuller and I'm a running coach with Compton Park Runners Club.<br/>
🎧 Welcome to my podcast.<br/>
🎧 If you're thinking about taking up running - I'm here to help.<br/>
🎧 There are many training programmes available online which aim to help people build up to running 5 kilometres.<br/>
🎧 Some of them are great<br/>
🎧 and thousands of people of all ages are taking part in 5-kilometre races across the country as a result.<br/>
🎧 People like them because they're easy to follow and don't push them too hard.<br/>
🎧 However, they don't work for everyone,<br/>
🎧 especially if you suffer from something like a heart condition or asthma,<br/>
🎧 because they're aimed at people with average fitness and running ability.<br/>
🎧 Another thing is that everyone is different<br/>
🎧 and if you have any specific questions related to your needs,<br/>
🎧 there's no one to provide any answers.<br/>
🎧 I have a couple of simple tips I always give to new runners.<br/>
🎧 I expect you've been told to run very slowly until your fitness increases.<br/>
🎧 Well, I find that can prevent progress.<br/>
🎧 You should run at a speed that feels comfortable,<br/>
🎧 but time yourself and try to run a bit faster each time.<br/>
🎧 Listening to music can be very helpful.<br/>
🎧 It takes your mind off things and helps your body get into a rhythm.<br/>
🎧 I'd say that is better than running with a friend,<br/>
🎧 especially as most people are competitive<br/>
🎧 and that's not what you want when you're just starting.<br/>
🎧 I don't think the time of day is especially important.<br/>
🎧 Some people are better in the evening, while others are morning people<br/>
🎧 but you need to be consistent, so aim to train regularly.<br/>
🎧 Twice a week is enough to begin with.<br/>
🎧 New members often say to me that they've been put off running either because they lack confidence,<br/>
🎧 or they don't have time,<br/>
🎧 or they think they dislike running.<br/>
🎧 Ceri, for example, joined the club two years ago at the age of 40.<br/>
🎧 She'd always enjoyed running at school but wasn't sure if she'd be able to do it.<br/>
🎧 She was worried about being left behind and being the slowest runner.<br/>
🎧 But she says she was made to feel so welcome she soon forgot all about that.<br/>
🎧 James had always hated the idea of running<br/>
🎧 but a friend encouraged him to come along for a taster session<br/>
🎧 and he hasn't looked back.<br/>
🎧 He never misses a training session despite having a really demanding job.<br/>
🎧 Leo was worried about having to commit himself to training sessions every week<br/>
🎧 and wasn't sure he'd be able to fit training into his busy schedule.<br/>
🎧 But after experiencing a lot of stress at work<br/>
🎧 he came along to us and gave it a go.<br/>
🎧 Now he says he feels much more relaxed and he looks forward to his weekly run.<br/>
🎧 Mark is quite typical of our new members.<br/>
🎧 He's never considered himself to be a sporty person<br/>
🎧 and it was only when he retired that he decided to take up the challenge of trying to run 5 kilometres.<br/>
🎧 It took him months to find the courage to contact us but felt reassured immediately<br/>
🎧 as there were other people his age who were only just taking up running for the first time.<br/>
🎧 My own journey hasn't been easy.<br/>
🎧 I did my first marathon when I was 37, after having had two kids.<br/>
🎧 My husband had been running marathons for years,<br/>
🎧 but I never dreamed I'd be doing one with him.<br/>
🎧 I managed to complete it in four hours,<br/>
🎧 but I felt like giving up halfway through.<br/>
🎧 It was only the support of the spectators that kept me going.<br/>
🎧 I do think signing up for a race of whatever length is motivating<br/>
🎧 whether it's 5K or 25K<br/>
🎧 because it's good to have something to work towards<br/>
🎧 and it gives you a sense of achievement.<br/>
🎧 I did my first 10K after only six months,<br/>
🎧 which was certainly very challenging and not something I'd necessarily recommend.<br/>
🎧 But after you've been training for a few weeks, it's worth putting your name down for a 5K.<br/>
🎧 some people find they only need a few practice runs before taking part in a race,<br/>
🎧 but I'd give yourself a couple of months at least.<br/>
🎧 Well, I hope that's given...<br/>

🎧 So Jane you'll be off to Denmark soon to do your work placement.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I'm really looking forward to it<br/>
🎧 and I've just started packing up all my books to put in storage.<br/>
🎧 Well, I hope they don't get spoilt.<br/>
🎧 It's okay, my grandfather works in a bookshop<br/>
🎧 and he told me how to pack them.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's helpful.<br/>
🎧 He says you have to support the spine<br/>
🎧 otherwise the paper can come away from the cover.<br/>
🎧 Yeah that's obvious.<br/>
🎧 He also told me to pack them flat in the box, not on their side,<br/>
🎧 again because they can bend<br/>
🎧 and if you leave them like that for, say, a year,<br/>
🎧 it's quite hard to get them back to their normal shape.<br/>
🎧 Well, it's pretty clear that ruins them,<br/>
🎧 but a lot of people just can't be bothered to protect their books.<br/>
🎧 He always says it's such a shame that publishers don't use better-quality paper.<br/>
🎧 It's the acid in the paper that causes the problem, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, that's why old books go yellow.<br/>
🎧 You know some of the books my grandfather's given me are like that already.<br/>
🎧 I should dump them really if they're going to deteriorate further, but I'd feel bad.<br/>
🎧 They'll always remind me of him.<br/>
🎧 He's quite a collector, you know.<br/>
🎧 Well, if they're important to you...<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I'd regret just throwing them away.<br/>
🎧 You know, maybe it's because I was taught to treasure books...<br/>
🎧 But I hate seeing students force open the pages of paperbacks.<br/>
🎧 They press so hard they end up breaking the spine.<br/>
🎧 I know,<br/>
🎧 but unfortunately, paperbacks aren't designed to last a long time and people know that.<br/>
🎧 Hardbacks aren't quite as weak.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, they're different, I suppose.<br/>
🎧 But I still don't think people value hardbacks like they used to.<br/>
🎧 Well, they aren't decorative, are they, like other objects.<br/>
🎧 Plus, nowadays, people don't keep them out on shelves as much as they used to.<br/>
🎧 That's such a pity.<br/>
🎧 When I visit someone,<br/>
🎧 if they have, say, a colourful book on a table, it's the first thing I'm drawn to.<br/>
🎧 I agree,<br/>
🎧 and book covers can be a work of art in themselves.<br/>
🎧 Some are really eye-catching.<br/>
🎧 I've always been taught to handle books carefully.<br/>
🎧 If you watch someone take a book off a shelf, well, they usually do it wrong.<br/>
🎧 Ah, my grandfather says, you should put your hand right over the top of the book...<br/>
🎧 Or, if you can't do that,<br/>
🎧 pull the other books on the shelf aside so that you can hold the whole cover.<br/>
🎧 When did you learn all this?<br/>
🎧 He watched me pull a heavy book off the shelf when I was small,<br/>
🎧 and it fell on the floor and broke apart.<br/>
🎧 Oh dear!<br/>
🎧 Ah... I can still remember it!<br/>
🎧 You know what I really like?<br/>
🎧 What?<br/>
🎧 The smell of new books.<br/>
🎧 Me too.<br/>
🎧 My parents used to laugh at me when I was a kid because I loved putting books up to my nose.<br/>
🎧 Almost as much as reading them!<br/>
🎧 New books aren't cheap, though, are they?<br/>
🎧 I guess we're lucky we can buy them.<br/>
🎧 My grandfather stocks second-hand books as well as new ones<br/>
🎧 and they don't smell quite as good.<br/>
🎧 I'd love to have a bookshop like your grandfather.<br/>
🎧 What's it like?<br/>
🎧 Well, it's quite big.<br/>
🎧 It's got two floors and an attic,<br/>
🎧 and he stocks all kinds of books really.<br/>
🎧 I guess he treasures things like first editions and other rare books.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, you might think he'd keep those in the attic or somewhere...<br/>
🎧 So they'd be hidden?<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 But he likes people to know that he has them.<br/>
🎧 So, he puts them out in the shop but makes sure you need a ladder to get them.<br/>
🎧 Right. That would prevent any thefts!<br/>
🎧 Does he stock books for children?<br/>
🎧 He does.<br/>
🎧 He particularly likes to encourage kids to read;<br/>
🎧 he always says that he used to sit under the stairs as a child with a pile of books and read them all.<br/>
🎧 Is that where he keeps them, then?<br/>
🎧 Not exactly.<br/>
🎧 He's got a dedicated area on the ground floor with cushions<br/>
🎧 so that parents can enter with their toddlers,<br/>
🎧 go there and spend some time reading to them.<br/>
🎧 Oh cool.<br/>
🎧 And then there's a place for pushchairs by the front door.<br/>
🎧 And a café if anyone needs refreshments.<br/>
🎧 That's good to know.<br/>
🎧 As I said, it's a big shop<br/>
🎧 and there's a storage area out the back as well.<br/>
🎧 Oh, what does he keep there?<br/>
🎧 Books he wants to throw away?<br/>
🎧 He hardly ever throws anything away.<br/>
🎧 He just leaves unwanted books by the front door for customers to take.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's very nice.<br/>
🎧 And books people or institutions have requested, they all go at the far end.<br/>
🎧 He thinks it's best to keep these out of the main shopping area as they're boxed and new.<br/>
🎧 Did you get your coursebooks from him?<br/>
🎧 Naturally.<br/>
🎧 He stocks books for a lot of the colleges.<br/>
🎧 He used to keep these books on the first floor,<br/>
🎧 but now there's a new university in my hometown,<br/>
🎧 he's moved them downstairs to attract the students.<br/>
🎧 They're actually part of the coffee shop, on low shelves all around it.<br/>
🎧 Pretty central then.<br/>
🎧 You'll have to take me there some time!<br/>

🎧 Tree planting now dominates political and popular agendas<br/>
🎧 and is often presented as an easy answer to the climate crisis,<br/>
🎧 as well as a way for business corporations to offset their carbon emissions.<br/>
🎧 But unfortunately, tree planting isn't as straightforward as some people think.<br/>
🎧 When the wrong trees are planted in the wrong place,<br/>
🎧 it can do considerably more damage than good,<br/>
🎧 failing to help either people or the environment.<br/>
🎧 Reforestation projects are currently being undertaken on a huge scale in many countries<br/>
🎧 and it's crucial that the right trees are selected.<br/>
🎧 A mix of species should always be planted,<br/>
🎧 typical of the local natural forest ecosystem<br/>
🎧 and including rare and endangered species in order to create a rich ecosystem.<br/>
🎧 It's important to avoid non-native species that could become invasive.<br/>
🎧 Invasive species are a significant contributor to the current global biodiversity crisis<br/>
🎧 and are often in competition with native species<br/>
🎧 and may threaten their long-term survival.<br/>
🎧 Restoring biodiversity that will maximise carbon capture is key when reforesting an area,<br/>
🎧 but ideally any reforestation project should have several goals.<br/>
🎧 These could include selecting trees that can contribute to wildlife conservation,<br/>
🎧 improve the availability of food for the local community<br/>
🎧 and maintain the stability of soil systems.<br/>
🎧 Meeting as many of these goals as possible,<br/>
🎧 whilst doing no harm to local communities, native ecosystems and vulnerable species,<br/>
🎧 is the sign of a highly successful tree-planting scheme.<br/>
🎧 To ensure the survival and resilience of a planted forest,<br/>
🎧 it's vital to use tree seeds with appropriate levels of genetic diversity:<br/>
🎧 the amount of genetic variation found within a species essential for their survival.<br/>
🎧 Using seeds with low genetic diversity generally lowers the resilience of restored forests,<br/>
🎧 which can make them vulnerable to disease and unable to adapt to climate change.<br/>
🎧 Choosing the right location for reforestation projects is as important as choosing the right trees.<br/>
🎧 Ultimately, the best area for planting trees would be in formerly forested areas that are in poor condition.<br/>
🎧 It's better to avoid non-forested landscapes such as natural grasslands, savannas or wetlands<br/>
🎧 as these ecosystems already contribute greatly to capturing carbon.<br/>
🎧 It would also be advantageous to choose an area where trees could provide other benefits,<br/>
🎧 such as recreational spaces.<br/>
🎧 Reforesting areas which are currently exploited for agriculture should be avoided<br/>
🎧 as this often leads to other areas being deforested.<br/>
🎧 Large-scale reforestation projects require careful planning.<br/>
🎧 Making the right decisions about where to plant trees depends on having the right information.<br/>
🎧 Having detailed and up-to-date maps identifying high-priority areas for intervention is essential.<br/>
🎧 Drone technology is a useful tool in helping to prioritise and monitor areas of degraded forest for restoration.<br/>
🎧 In Brazil, it's being used to identify and quantify how parts of the Amazon are being devastated by human activities<br/>
🎧 such as rearing cattle and illegal logging.<br/>
🎧 A good example of where the right trees were picked to achieve a restored forest<br/>
🎧 is in Lampang Province in Northern Thailand.<br/>
🎧 A previously forested site which had been degraded through mining<br/>
🎧 was reforested by a cement company together with Chiang Mai University.<br/>
🎧 After spreading 60 cm of topsoil,<br/>
🎧 they planted 14 different native tree species<br/>
🎧 which included several species of fig.<br/>
🎧 Figs are a keystone species<br/>
🎧 because of the critical role they play in maintaining wildlife populations.<br/>
🎧 They are central to tropical reforestation projects<br/>
🎧 as they accelerate the speed of the recovery process<br/>
🎧 by attracting animals and birds which act as natural seed dispersers.<br/>
🎧 This helps to promote diversity through the healthy regrowth of a wide range of plant species.<br/>
🎧 Unlike the majority of fruit trees,<br/>
🎧 figs bear fruit all year round, providing a reliable food source for many species.<br/>
🎧 At this site, for example, after only three rainy seasons,<br/>
🎧 monkeys started visiting to eat the fig fruits,<br/>
🎧 naturally dispersing seeds through defecation.<br/>
🎧 Reforestation projects should always aim to make sure that...<br/>
🎧 local communities are consulted and involved in the decision-making process.<br/>
🎧 The restoration of mangrove forests in Madagascar<br/>
🎧 is an example of a project which has succeeded in creating real benefits for the community.<br/>
🎧 Destruction of the mangrove forests had a terrible impact on plant and animal life,<br/>
🎧 and also badly affected the fishing industry,<br/>
🎧 which was a major source of employment for local people living in coastal areas.<br/>
🎧 The reforestation project involved hiring local people to plant and care for the new mangrove trees.<br/>
🎧 Millions of mangrove trees have now been planted<br/>
🎧 which has resulted in the return of a healthy aquatic ecosystem.<br/>
🎧 The mangroves also act as a defence against the increased threat of flooding caused by climate change.<br/>
🎧 What's more, the local economy is more stable<br/>
🎧 and thousands more Madagascans are now able to send their children to school.<br/>
🎧 One other important point...<br/>
<br/><br/>
