🎧 <span>Right..</span>. let's try and get it <span>sorted</span> out <span>today<br/></span>
🎧 so we don't have it <span>hanging</span> over us. Okay?<br/>
🎧 Good idea. I'll take <span>notes</span>.<br/>
🎧 First <span>thing..</span>. <span>numbers..</span>.<br/>
🎧 have we got anything <span>definite</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Well..</span>. I've been working it out and I think <span>40</span> to <span>43</span>.<br/>
🎧 Shall we put <span>45</span> to be on the <span>safe</span> side?<br/>
🎧 <span>Yep</span>, fine.<br/>
🎧 <span>Dates..</span>. well, that's <span>straightforward</span>.<br/>
🎧 The last working day before <span>Christmas..</span>. which <span>is..</span>.<br/>
🎧 which is <span>December</span> the <span>21st</span>.<br/>
🎧 which is going to be <span>pretty</span> <span>difficult</span> to book at <span>Christmas<br/></span>
🎧 so we'd better think of two or <span>three</span> <span>places</span> just to be on the <span>safe</span> side.<br/>
🎧 Well, last <span>year's</span> was <span>hopeless</span>.<br/>
🎧 The Red <span>Lion</span>, wasn't it?<br/>
🎧 <span>Yep</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>ought</span> to go for something more <span>expensive</span>, <span>cos</span> <span>you..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>...you</span> <span>gets</span> what you pay for.<br/>
🎧 That new <span>Indian</span> <span>restaurant</span> in <span>Wetherfield</span> is <span>supposed</span> to be <span>excellent..</span>.<br/>
🎧 the <span>Rajdoot</span>.<br/>
🎧 How do you <span>spell</span> that?<br/>
🎧 <span>RAJDOOT</span>.<br/>
🎧 But it's <span>bound</span> to be <span>packed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, let's put that down as the first <span>choice</span> and have some <span>back-ups</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about the <span>Park</span> <span>View</span> <span>Hotel</span> as a second <span>choice</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's always <span>reliable</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Park</span> <span>View</span> <span>Hotel..</span>.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>London</span> <span>Arms</span> in case.<br/>
🎧 <span>London</span> <span>Arms..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll call them now if you want.<br/>
🎧 No. I'll do it, <span>Joan</span>.<br/>
🎧 You're really <span>busy</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, have you got the <span>numbers</span>?<br/>
🎧 Not for the <span>Rajdoot</span>, <span>but..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>right..</span>. <span>Park</span> <span>View</span> <span>Hotel:<br/></span>
🎧 <span>777192</span>.<br/>
🎧 And <span>London</span> <span>Arms</span>: <span>208657</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 Before I <span>ring</span>, we'd better just make sure they're <span>within</span> the <span>price</span> <span>range</span>.<br/>
🎧 Up to <span>£15</span> a <span>head</span>?<br/>
🎧 I think you'll find some people won't be able to go that high.<br/>
🎧 Well, you can't get anything <span>decent</span> under <span>£10</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 We'll say <span>£12</span>?<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 And we'd better make sure there's good <span>vegetarian</span> food.<br/>
🎧 And a <span>non-smoking</span> <span>section</span>!<br/>
🎧 You know what the <span>boss</span> is like.<br/>
🎧 Don't <span>remind</span> me.<br/>
🎧 I'll let you know as soon as I get anything.<br/>
🎧 Good <span>news</span>. I <span>found</span> <span>Rajdoot's</span> number <span>straight</span> <span>away<br/></span>
🎧 and they can fit us in.<br/>
🎧 Their <span>Christmas</span> <span>menu</span> sounds great.<br/>
🎧 What is it?<br/>
🎧 <span>French</span> <span>onion</span> <span>soup</span> or <span>fruit</span> <span>juice</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Roast</span> dinner or <span>lentil</span> <span>curry..</span>.<br/>
🎧 sounds <span>ordinary</span> but my friend said it was really <span>tasty</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Umm..</span>. <span>lentil</span> <span>curry..</span>. that's <span>unusual</span>.<br/>
🎧 And then for <span>dessert</span>, there's <span>traditional</span> <span>plum</span> <span>pudding<br/></span>
🎧 or <span>apple</span> <span>pie</span>, <span>plus</span> <span>coffee</span>.<br/>
🎧 That sounds really good for <span>£12</span>.<br/>
🎧 Did you book it?<br/>
🎧 Well, I said I'd check with the <span>staff</span> first.<br/>
🎧 But they did say they'd <span>hold</span> the <span>booking</span> until next <span>Wednesday</span> <span>anyway</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and if we go ahead, they'd like a <span>£50</span> <span>deposit</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>50</span> is <span>normal..</span>. that's fine.<br/>
🎧 And they want a <span>letter</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Right..</span>. to <span>confirm</span>.<br/>
🎧 They say with such large <span>numbers</span> we have to choose the <span>menu</span> in <span>advance</span>.<br/>
🎧 That won't be a <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll put up a <span>notice</span> with <span>details</span> of the <span>restaurant</span> and the <span>menu</span>.<br/>
🎧 When did you say they wanted <span>confirmation</span> by?<br/>
🎧 It <span>was..</span>. let's <span>see..</span>.<br/>
🎧 the <span>4th</span> of <span>November</span>.<br/>
🎧 Where do you think I should put up the <span>notice</span>?<br/>
🎧 Where <span>everyone's</span> <span>guaranteed</span> to see it.<br/>
🎧 On the <span>café</span> <span>noticeboard</span> I should think.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hardly</span> <span>anyone</span> looks at that.<br/>
🎧 Well, the <span>Newsletter</span> is probably your best bet.<br/>
🎧 Good idea.<br/>
🎧 I'll go and do that now.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 <span>Welcome</span> to the <span>Sports</span> <span>Centre</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's good to see that there are so many people <span>wanting</span> to find out about our <span>sports</span> <span>facilities</span>.<br/>
🎧 First of all, <span>membership</span>.<br/>
🎧 All students at the <span>college</span> are <span>entitled</span> to become <span>members</span> of the <span>Sports</span> <span>Centre</span>,<br/>
🎧 for an <span>annual</span> <span>fee</span> of <span>£9.50</span>.<br/>
🎧 To <span>register</span> with us and get your <span>membership</span> <span>card</span>,<br/>
🎧 you need to come to <span>reception</span>, between <span>2</span> and <span>6</span> pm,<br/>
🎧 <span>Monday</span> to <span>Thursday</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>afraid</span> we can't <span>register</span> new <span>members</span> on <span>Friday</span>,<br/>
🎧 so it's <span>Monday</span> to <span>Thursday</span>, <span>2</span> to <span>6</span>, at <span>reception</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, there are <span>three</span> things that you must remember to <span>bring</span> with you when you come to <span>register;<br/></span>
🎧 they <span>are</span>: your <span>Union</span> <span>card</span>,<br/>
🎧 a <span>recent</span> <span>passport-sized</span> <span>photograph</span> of yourself, and the <span>fee</span>.<br/>
🎧 It doesn't <span>matter</span> <span>whether</span> you <span>bring</span> <span>cash</span> or a <span>cheque</span>.<br/>
🎧 We can't issue your <span>card</span> <span>unless</span> you <span>bring</span> all <span>three;</span> so, don't <span>forget:<br/></span>
🎧 your <span>Union</span> <span>card</span>, <span>passport</span> <span>photo</span> and <span>fee</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then once you have got your <span>sports</span> <span>card</span>,<br/>
🎧 you will need to <span>bring</span> it with you <span>whenever</span> you come to book or use any <span>Sports</span> <span>Centre</span> <span>facilities</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Booking</span> over the phone is not <span>allowed</span>,<br/>
🎧 so you have to come here in person, with your <span>card</span>, when you want to book.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>opening</span> hours <span>seem</span> to get <span>longer</span> every year.<br/>
🎧 We are now open from <span>9am</span> to <span>10pm</span> on <span>weekdays<br/></span>
🎧 and from <span>10am</span> to <span>6pm</span> on <span>Saturdays</span>.<br/>
🎧 For those of you who are up and about <span>early</span> in the morning,<br/>
🎧 we are <span>introducing</span> a <span>50%</span> <span>'morning</span> <span>discount'</span> this year.<br/>
🎧 This is because the <span>facilities</span> <span>tended</span> to be <span>under-used</span> in the <span>mornings</span> last year.<br/>
🎧 It <span>means</span> that all the <span>sessions</span> will be <span>half-price</span> between <span>9</span> am and <span>12</span> <span>noon</span> on <span>weekdays</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, what exactly are the <span>facilities</span>?<br/>
🎧 What <span>sports</span> can you play here?<br/>
🎧 Well, this room we are in at the <span>moment</span> is called the <span>Main</span> <span>Hall</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it's used <span>mainly</span> for <span>team</span> <span>sports</span> such as <span>football</span>, <span>volleyball</span> and <span>basketball</span>,<br/>
🎧 but also for <span>badminton</span> and <span>aerobics</span>.<br/>
🎧 On the other side of the <span>reception</span> <span>area</span> there is the <span>dance</span> <span>studio;<br/></span>
🎧 this <span>provides</span> a <span>smaller</span>, more <span>intimate</span> <span>space</span>,<br/>
🎧 which we use for <span>ballet</span>, <span>modern</span> <span>dance</span> and <span>martial</span> <span>arts</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 not at the same time, of course.<br/>
🎧 Then, in a <span>separate</span> <span>building</span>, which you may have <span>noticed</span> on your way <span>here..</span>.<br/>
🎧 it's on the other side of the car <span>park..</span>.<br/>
🎧 there are the <span>squash</span> <span>courts</span>, six of them,<br/>
🎧 and at the <span>far</span> end of the <span>building</span> a <span>fitness</span> room.<br/>
🎧 This is our <span>newest</span> <span>facility</span>, only <span>completed</span> in the <span>Spring</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it is already <span>proving</span> to be one of the most <span>popular</span>.<br/>
🎧 As well as all these <span>facilities</span> <span>available</span> here on the <span>campus</span>,<br/>
🎧 we also have an <span>arrangement</span> with the <span>local</span> <span>tennis</span> <span>club</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is only two <span>miles</span> away,<br/>
🎧 <span>entitling</span> our students to use their <span>courts</span> on <span>weekday</span> <span>mornings</span> in the <span>Summer</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, I think that there should be something here for <span>everybody</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I hope to see all of you at the <span>Centre</span>, <span>making</span> use of the <span>facilities</span>.<br/>
🎧 If, in the course of the year,<br/>
🎧 you have any <span>suggestions</span> as to how the <span>service</span> we <span>provide</span> might be <span>improved<br/></span>
🎧 or its <span>appeal</span> <span>widened</span>,<br/>
🎧 I'll be interested to hear from you.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Good morning, <span>Mrs</span> <span>Collins</span>.<br/>
🎧 I just <span>wondered</span> if you could help me with this <span>entry</span> <span>form</span> for the Young <span>Electronic</span> <span>Engineer</span> <span>competition</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hello, <span>John</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, you've made the <span>jigsaw</span> for <span>blind</span> children, with the <span>bleeper</span>.<br/>
🎧 When they put a <span>piece</span> in <span>correctly</span>, that's right.<br/>
🎧 Okay, let's have a look at the <span>form</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, thanks.<br/>
🎧 I've never <span>filled</span> in one of these before, <span>so..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, let's just do it in <span>pencil</span> first.<br/>
🎧 So, name of <span>designers..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>Anne</span> <span>helped</span> me with some of the <span>electronics</span> work.<br/>
🎧 Then you must put her name in as well.<br/>
🎧 <span>Right..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ann</span> <span>Ray</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sorry. It's <span>ANNE<br/></span>
🎧 and her <span>surname</span> is <span>spelt</span> <span>REA</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good start! <span>Okay..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>REA</span>.<br/>
🎧 And age is easy. You're both <span>16</span>.<br/>
🎧 What have you called the <span>design</span>? Keep it short.<br/>
🎧 What about <span>jigsaw</span> <span>puzzle</span> <span>design</span> for <span>visually</span> <span>handicapped</span>?<br/>
🎧 Too long.<br/>
🎧 Just say <span>blind</span> <span>puzzle</span>, <span>that'll</span> do.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Right, now, size of <span>equipment</span>?<br/>
🎧 I've got it <span>noted</span> down <span>here..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>um</span>, yes, <span>length</span>, sorry, <span>width</span> is <span>20</span> <span>centimetres</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 <span>Length</span> is <span>50</span> <span>centimetres</span>,<br/>
🎧 and then the <span>depth</span> <span>is..</span>. well, it's very little.<br/>
🎧 What would you say? I think you can be <span>approximate</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd say <span>2.5</span> <span>centimetres</span>.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>electricity</span> <span>supply</span>?<br/>
🎧 Is it <span>mains</span> <span>operated</span>?<br/>
🎧 No it isn't, it's actually <span>battery</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, <span>write</span> <span>battery</span>.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 Okay. It's the next bit that I'm really not sure what to put.<br/>
🎧 Well, special <span>features</span> <span>means..</span>.<br/>
🎧 what is really new about this, you know, <span>suitable</span> for the group you made it for.<br/>
🎧 Well, it's <span>safe</span> for children.<br/>
🎧 That's fine. Put that in.<br/>
🎧 Okay, and of course we think it's <span>educational</span>.<br/>
🎧 There you are, you've done it.<br/>
🎧 Anything else?<br/>
🎧 Well, I think the <span>price</span> is good.<br/>
🎧 That's probably the most important <span>factor</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Okay..</span>. <span>cheap</span> <span>price</span>.<br/>
🎧 Which <span>brings</span> us on to the next bit.<br/>
🎧 What's the <span>cost</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, the <span>pieces</span> we made out of old <span>wood..</span>.<br/>
🎧 they <span>cost</span>, <span>ooh</span>, <span>$5</span>.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>electrics</span>?<br/>
🎧 They were more <span>expensive..</span>. say, <span>$9.50</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Brilliant</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now what do they mean by other <span>comments</span>?<br/>
🎧 It's just a <span>chance</span> for you to say anything about the <span>equipment</span>, and <span>problems</span> you <span>envisage</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, we would really like help with <span>making</span> <span>plastic</span> <span>instead</span> of <span>wooden</span> <span>pieces</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, put something like, need help to make <span>plastic</span> <span>pieces</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 And the other thing is, we'd like to <span>develop</span> a <span>range</span> of <span>sizes</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's fine, then, just put that.<br/>
🎧 And the last bit is,<br/>
🎧 when will you <span>send</span> the <span>equipment</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, we've got a lot of work on at the <span>moment</span> <span>and..</span>.<br/>
🎧 we want to get it as good as we can.<br/>
🎧 Well, say <span>25th</span> of <span>June</span>?<br/>
🎧 Can't we make it later?<br/>
🎧 Well, the last date is the <span>1st</span> of <span>July</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why not say that?<br/>
🎧 Okay, that's what I'll put.<br/>
🎧 So, that's the lot!<br/>
🎧 That's <span>brilliant</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks very much, <span>Mrs</span> <span>Collins</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll <span>send</span> it off <span>straight</span> away.<br/>
🎧 Glad to be of help.<br/>
🎧 Very best of <span>luck</span> to you both.<br/>
🎧 Thanks, bye.<br/>
🎧 Bye.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Today I'd like to <span>introduce</span> <span>Ted</span> <span>Hunter</span>,<br/>
🎧 who used to <span>rear</span> <span>sheep</span> and <span>poultry<br/></span>
🎧 but who is here to tell us about a rather <span>unusual</span> <span>type</span> of <span>livestock<br/></span>
🎧 that he's been <span>concentrating</span> on in the last few years.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ted</span> <span>Hunter</span> is a <span>member</span> of the <span>Domesticated</span> <span>Ostrich</span> <span>Farming</span> <span>Association</span>,<br/>
🎧 and is here to tell us about the <span>possibilities</span> of <span>breeding</span> and <span>rearing</span> these <span>birds</span> in this <span>country</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you, <span>Paula</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you look at <span>international</span> <span>restaurant</span> <span>menus</span> and <span>supermarkets</span>,<br/>
🎧 they all <span>tend</span> to <span>feature</span> the same <span>range</span> of <span>meats</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>beef</span>, <span>lamb</span>, <span>chicken</span>, <span>pork</span>, that <span>sort</span> of thing.<br/>
🎧 But people are always interested in something <span>different<br/></span>
🎧 and we're now <span>finding</span> that <span>farming</span> can <span>bring</span> new <span>types</span> of <span>meat</span> to our <span>tables</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>kangaroo</span> is one <span>animal</span> that's now being <span>farmed</span> for its <span>meat<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>eaten</span> outside <span>Australia</span>, where it comes from.<br/>
🎧 It looks and <span>tastes</span> rather like <span>rabbit</span>,<br/>
🎧 though it's <span>slightly</span> <span>darker</span> in <span>colour</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it is rather tough, so that's a <span>problem</span> for some people.<br/>
🎧 <span>Crocodiles</span> are also being <span>farmed</span> for their <span>meat</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is rather like <span>chicken</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>pale</span> and <span>tender</span>, and it's getting quite <span>fashionable</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some people also find it's rather <span>fatty</span>, <span>but<br/></span>
🎧 I think it makes a really <span>tasty</span> <span>sandwich</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now a <span>third</span> <span>type</span> of <span>meat</span> <span>becoming</span> <span>increasingly</span> <span>available</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the one that I think is by <span>far</span> the <span>nicest</span> of the <span>three</span>, is <span>ostrich</span>,<br/>
🎧 which most people say has a <span>similar</span> <span>taste</span> and <span>texture</span> to <span>beef</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, it's much better for you than <span>beef</span>, as we'll see later.<br/>
🎧 Most people think of <span>ostriches</span> as <span>wild</span> <span>animals</span>,<br/>
🎧 but in <span>fact</span> <span>ostriches</span> have been <span>farmed</span> in <span>South</span> <span>Africa</span> since around <span>1860</span>.<br/>
🎧 At first they were <span>produced</span> for their <span>feathers</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>Africa</span> they were used for <span>tribal</span> <span>ceremonial</span> <span>dress<br/></span>
🎧 and they were also <span>exported</span> to <span>Europe</span> and <span>America<br/></span>
🎧 where they were made into <span>ladies'</span> <span>fans</span> and used for <span>decorating</span> <span>hats</span>.<br/>
🎧 Later, <span>feather</span> <span>fans</span> and big, <span>decorated</span> <span>hats</span> went out of <span>fashion<br/></span>
🎧 but <span>ostriches</span> were still <span>bred</span>,<br/>
🎧 this time for their <span>hide</span>.<br/>
🎧 This can be <span>treated</span> to <span>produce</span> about <span>half</span> a <span>square</span> <span>metre</span> of <span>leather</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 very <span>delicate</span>, fine <span>stuff</span> of very good <span>quality</span>.<br/>
🎧 At the same time, some of the <span>meat</span> was used for <span>biltong</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>air-dried</span> <span>strips</span> of <span>meat</span> <span>popular</span> in <span>South</span> <span>Africa</span> as a <span>sort</span> of <span>fast</span> food.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, <span>recently</span> there's been more and more <span>interest</span> in the <span>development</span> of <span>ostrich</span> <span>farming</span> in other <span>parts</span> of the <span>world</span>,<br/>
🎧 and more people are <span>recognising</span> its <span>value</span> as a food <span>source</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ostrich</span> <span>meat</span> is <span>slightly</span> <span>higher</span> in <span>protein</span> than <span>beef</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and much <span>lower</span> in <span>fats</span> and <span>cholesterol</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>tastes</span> good too.<br/>
🎧 A <span>series</span> of <span>European</span> <span>taste</span> <span>tests<br/></span>
🎧 <span>found</span> that <span>82%</span> of people <span>prefer</span> <span>ostrich</span> to <span>beef</span>.<br/>
🎧 And one <span>ostrich</span> <span>produces</span> a lot of <span>meat</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 from around <span>30</span> to <span>50</span> <span>kg</span> <span>mostly</span> from the <span>hindquarters</span> of the <span>bird</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Farmed</span> <span>ostriches</span> don't need <span>African</span> <span>climates</span>,<br/>
🎧 and in <span>fact</span> <span>ostrich</span> <span>farming</span> is now <span>becoming</span> well <span>established</span> in other <span>parts</span> of the <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, <span>setting</span> up an <span>ostrich</span> <span>farm</span> isn't something to <span>embark</span> on <span>lightly</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mature</span> <span>breeding</span> <span>birds</span> are very <span>expensive</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 even a <span>fertilised</span> <span>ostrich</span> egg isn't <span>cheap<br/></span>
🎧 so you need quite a bit of <span>capital</span> to <span>begin</span> with.<br/>
🎧 Then the <span>farmer</span> needs special <span>equipment</span> such as <span>incubators</span> for the <span>eggs</span>.<br/>
🎧 The young <span>chicks</span> are very <span>dependent</span> on <span>human</span> <span>minders</span>,<br/>
🎧 and need a lot of <span>attention</span> from the people looking after them.<br/>
🎧 In <span>addition</span>, <span>ostriches</span> can't be <span>intensively</span> <span>farmed</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 they need <span>space</span> and <span>exercise</span>.<br/>
🎧 But in <span>spite</span> of this, they make good <span>farming</span> <span>sense</span>.<br/>
🎧 A cow <span>produces</span> only one <span>calf</span> a <span>year<br/></span>
🎧 <span>whereas</span> a <span>female</span> <span>ostrich</span> can lay an egg every other day.<br/>
🎧 And because the <span>farmers</span> can use <span>incubators</span> <span>and..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>hatched</span> <span>chicks</span> are <span>nourished</span> well and <span>protected</span> from <span>danger</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>failure</span> <span>rate</span> on <span>farms</span> is very low <span>indeed<br/></span>
🎧 and almost all the <span>fertilised</span> <span>eggs</span> will <span>hatch</span> out into <span>chicks<br/></span>
🎧 which will in <span>turn</span> <span>reach</span> <span>maturity</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is very different from the <span>situation</span> in the <span>wild</span>,<br/>
🎧 where the <span>vast</span> <span>majority</span> of <span>chicks</span> will <span>die</span> or be <span>killed<br/></span>
🎧 before they <span>grow</span> up into <span>mature</span> <span>ostriches</span>.<br/>
🎧 So it's <span>possible</span>, once the <span>initial</span> <span>outlay</span> has been made,<br/>
🎧 for the <span>farmer</span> to be looking at very good <span>profit</span> <span>margins</span> <span>indeed</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ostrich</span> <span>farming</span> is still in its <span>early</span> <span>days</span> outside <span>Africa<br/></span>
🎧 but we hope that <span>ostrich</span> <span>meat</span> will be <span>freely</span> <span>available</span> <span>soon<br/></span>
🎧 and before long will be as <span>cheap</span> as <span>beef</span>.<br/>
