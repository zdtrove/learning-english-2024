🎧 <span>Right... let's try and get it <span>sorted out <span>today<br/>
🎧 so we don't have it <span>hanging over us. Okay?<br/>
🎧 Good idea. I'll take <span>notes.<br/>
🎧 First <span>thing... <span>numbers...<br/>
🎧 have we got anything <span>definite?<br/>
🎧 <span>Well... I've been working it out and I think <span>40 to <span>43.<br/>
🎧 Shall we put <span>45 to be on the <span>safe side?<br/>
🎧 <span>Yep, fine.<br/>
🎧 <span>Dates... well, that's <span>straightforward.<br/>
🎧 The last working day before <span>Christmas... which <span>is...<br/>
🎧 which is <span>December the <span>21st.<br/>
🎧 which is going to be <span>pretty <span>difficult to book at <span>Christmas<br/>
🎧 so we'd better think of two or <span>three <span>places just to be on the <span>safe side.<br/>
🎧 Well, last <span>year's was <span>hopeless.<br/>
🎧 The Red <span>Lion, wasn't it?<br/>
🎧 <span>Yep.<br/>
🎧 We <span>ought to go for something more <span>expensive, <span>cos <span>you...<br/>
🎧 <span>...you <span>gets what you pay for.<br/>
🎧 That new <span>Indian <span>restaurant in <span>Wetherfield is <span>supposed to be <span>excellent...<br/>
🎧 the <span>Rajdoot.<br/>
🎧 How do you <span>spell that?<br/>
🎧 <span>RAJDOOT.<br/>
🎧 But it's <span>bound to be <span>packed.<br/>
🎧 Well, let's put that down as the first <span>choice and have some <span>back-ups.<br/>
🎧 What about the <span>Park <span>View <span>Hotel as a second <span>choice?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's always <span>reliable.<br/>
🎧 <span>Park <span>View <span>Hotel...<br/>
🎧 And the <span>London <span>Arms in case.<br/>
🎧 <span>London <span>Arms...<br/>
🎧 I'll call them now if you want.<br/>
🎧 No. I'll do it, <span>Joan.<br/>
🎧 You're really <span>busy.<br/>
🎧 Oh, have you got the <span>numbers?<br/>
🎧 Not for the <span>Rajdoot, <span>but...<br/>
🎧 <span>right... <span>Park <span>View <span>Hotel:<br/>
🎧 <span>777192.<br/>
🎧 And <span>London <span>Arms: <span>208657.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 Before I <span>ring, we'd better just make sure they're <span>within the <span>price <span>range.<br/>
🎧 Up to <span>£15 a <span>head?<br/>
🎧 I think you'll find some people won't be able to go that high.<br/>
🎧 Well, you can't get anything <span>decent under <span>£10.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 We'll say <span>£12?<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 And we'd better make sure there's good <span>vegetarian food.<br/>
🎧 And a <span>non-smoking <span>section!<br/>
🎧 You know what the <span>boss is like.<br/>
🎧 Don't <span>remind me.<br/>
🎧 I'll let you know as soon as I get anything.<br/>
🎧 Good <span>news. I <span>found <span>Rajdoot's number <span>straight <span>away<br/>
🎧 and they can fit us in.<br/>
🎧 Their <span>Christmas <span>menu sounds great.<br/>
🎧 What is it?<br/>
🎧 <span>French <span>onion <span>soup or <span>fruit <span>juice.<br/>
🎧 <span>Roast dinner or <span>lentil <span>curry...<br/>
🎧 sounds <span>ordinary but my friend said it was really <span>tasty.<br/>
🎧 <span>Umm... <span>lentil <span>curry... that's <span>unusual.<br/>
🎧 And then for <span>dessert, there's <span>traditional <span>plum <span>pudding<br/>
🎧 or <span>apple <span>pie, <span>plus <span>coffee.<br/>
🎧 That sounds really good for <span>£12.<br/>
🎧 Did you book it?<br/>
🎧 Well, I said I'd check with the <span>staff first.<br/>
🎧 But they did say they'd <span>hold the <span>booking until next <span>Wednesday <span>anyway.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and if we go ahead, they'd like a <span>£50 <span>deposit.<br/>
🎧 <span>50 is <span>normal... that's fine.<br/>
🎧 And they want a <span>letter.<br/>
🎧 <span>Right... to <span>confirm.<br/>
🎧 They say with such large <span>numbers we have to choose the <span>menu in <span>advance.<br/>
🎧 That won't be a <span>problem.<br/>
🎧 I'll put up a <span>notice with <span>details of the <span>restaurant and the <span>menu.<br/>
🎧 When did you say they wanted <span>confirmation by?<br/>
🎧 It <span>was... let's <span>see...<br/>
🎧 the <span>4th of <span>November.<br/>
🎧 Where do you think I should put up the <span>notice?<br/>
🎧 Where <span>everyone's <span>guaranteed to see it.<br/>
🎧 On the <span>café <span>noticeboard I should think.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hardly <span>anyone looks at that.<br/>
🎧 Well, the <span>Newsletter is probably your best bet.<br/>
🎧 Good idea.<br/>
🎧 I'll go and do that now.<br/>

🎧 <span>Welcome to the <span>Sports <span>Centre.<br/>
🎧 It's good to see that there are so many people <span>wanting to find out about our <span>sports <span>facilities.<br/>
🎧 First of all, <span>membership.<br/>
🎧 All students at the <span>college are <span>entitled to become <span>members of the <span>Sports <span>Centre,<br/>
🎧 for an <span>annual <span>fee of <span>£9.50.<br/>
🎧 To <span>register with us and get your <span>membership <span>card,<br/>
🎧 you need to come to <span>reception, between <span>2 and <span>6 pm,<br/>
🎧 <span>Monday to <span>Thursday.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>afraid we can't <span>register new <span>members on <span>Friday,<br/>
🎧 so it's <span>Monday to <span>Thursday, <span>2 to <span>6, at <span>reception.<br/>
🎧 Now, there are <span>three things that you must remember to <span>bring with you when you come to <span>register;<br/>
🎧 they <span>are: your <span>Union <span>card,<br/>
🎧 a <span>recent <span>passport-sized <span>photograph of yourself, and the <span>fee.<br/>
🎧 It doesn't <span>matter <span>whether you <span>bring <span>cash or a <span>cheque.<br/>
🎧 We can't issue your <span>card <span>unless you <span>bring all <span>three; so, don't <span>forget:<br/>
🎧 your <span>Union <span>card, <span>passport <span>photo and <span>fee.<br/>
🎧 Then once you have got your <span>sports <span>card,<br/>
🎧 you will need to <span>bring it with you <span>whenever you come to book or use any <span>Sports <span>Centre <span>facilities.<br/>
🎧 <span>Booking over the phone is not <span>allowed,<br/>
🎧 so you have to come here in person, with your <span>card, when you want to book.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>opening hours <span>seem to get <span>longer every year.<br/>
🎧 We are now open from <span>9am to <span>10pm on <span>weekdays<br/>
🎧 and from <span>10am to <span>6pm on <span>Saturdays.<br/>
🎧 For those of you who are up and about <span>early in the morning,<br/>
🎧 we are <span>introducing a <span>50% <span>'morning <span>discount' this year.<br/>
🎧 This is because the <span>facilities <span>tended to be <span>under-used in the <span>mornings last year.<br/>
🎧 It <span>means that all the <span>sessions will be <span>half-price between <span>9 am and <span>12 <span>noon on <span>weekdays.<br/>
🎧 So, what exactly are the <span>facilities?<br/>
🎧 What <span>sports can you play here?<br/>
🎧 Well, this room we are in at the <span>moment is called the <span>Main <span>Hall,<br/>
🎧 and it's used <span>mainly for <span>team <span>sports such as <span>football, <span>volleyball and <span>basketball,<br/>
🎧 but also for <span>badminton and <span>aerobics.<br/>
🎧 On the other side of the <span>reception <span>area there is the <span>dance <span>studio;<br/>
🎧 this <span>provides a <span>smaller, more <span>intimate <span>space,<br/>
🎧 which we use for <span>ballet, <span>modern <span>dance and <span>martial <span>arts <span>-<br/>
🎧 not at the same time, of course.<br/>
🎧 Then, in a <span>separate <span>building, which you may have <span>noticed on your way <span>here...<br/>
🎧 it's on the other side of the car <span>park...<br/>
🎧 there are the <span>squash <span>courts, six of them,<br/>
🎧 and at the <span>far end of the <span>building a <span>fitness room.<br/>
🎧 This is our <span>newest <span>facility, only <span>completed in the <span>Spring,<br/>
🎧 but it is already <span>proving to be one of the most <span>popular.<br/>
🎧 As well as all these <span>facilities <span>available here on the <span>campus,<br/>
🎧 we also have an <span>arrangement with the <span>local <span>tennis <span>club,<br/>
🎧 which is only two <span>miles away,<br/>
🎧 <span>entitling our students to use their <span>courts on <span>weekday <span>mornings in the <span>Summer.<br/>
🎧 So, I think that there should be something here for <span>everybody,<br/>
🎧 and I hope to see all of you at the <span>Centre, <span>making use of the <span>facilities.<br/>
🎧 If, in the course of the year,<br/>
🎧 you have any <span>suggestions as to how the <span>service we <span>provide might be <span>improved<br/>
🎧 or its <span>appeal <span>widened,<br/>
🎧 I'll be interested to hear from you.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Good morning, <span>Mrs <span>Collins.<br/>
🎧 I just <span>wondered if you could help me with this <span>entry <span>form for the Young <span>Electronic <span>Engineer <span>competition.<br/>
🎧 Hello, <span>John.<br/>
🎧 Oh, you've made the <span>jigsaw for <span>blind children, with the <span>bleeper.<br/>
🎧 When they put a <span>piece in <span>correctly, that's right.<br/>
🎧 Okay, let's have a look at the <span>form.<br/>
🎧 Right, thanks.<br/>
🎧 I've never <span>filled in one of these before, <span>so...<br/>
🎧 Well, let's just do it in <span>pencil first.<br/>
🎧 So, name of <span>designers...<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>Anne <span>helped me with some of the <span>electronics work.<br/>
🎧 Then you must put her name in as well.<br/>
🎧 <span>Right...<br/>
🎧 <span>Ann <span>Ray.<br/>
🎧 Sorry. It's <span>ANNE<br/>
🎧 and her <span>surname is <span>spelt <span>REA.<br/>
🎧 Good start! <span>Okay...<br/>
🎧 <span>REA.<br/>
🎧 And age is easy. You're both <span>16.<br/>
🎧 What have you called the <span>design? Keep it short.<br/>
🎧 What about <span>jigsaw <span>puzzle <span>design for <span>visually <span>handicapped?<br/>
🎧 Too long.<br/>
🎧 Just say <span>blind <span>puzzle, <span>that'll do.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Right, now, size of <span>equipment?<br/>
🎧 I've got it <span>noted down <span>here...<br/>
🎧 <span>um, yes, <span>length, sorry, <span>width is <span>20 <span>centimetres.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 <span>Length is <span>50 <span>centimetres,<br/>
🎧 and then the <span>depth <span>is... well, it's very little.<br/>
🎧 What would you say? I think you can be <span>approximate.<br/>
🎧 I'd say <span>2.5 <span>centimetres.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>electricity <span>supply?<br/>
🎧 Is it <span>mains <span>operated?<br/>
🎧 No it isn't, it's actually <span>battery.<br/>
🎧 Okay, <span>write <span>battery.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 Okay. It's the next bit that I'm really not sure what to put.<br/>
🎧 Well, special <span>features <span>means...<br/>
🎧 what is really new about this, you know, <span>suitable for the group you made it for.<br/>
🎧 Well, it's <span>safe for children.<br/>
🎧 That's fine. Put that in.<br/>
🎧 Okay, and of course we think it's <span>educational.<br/>
🎧 There you are, you've done it.<br/>
🎧 Anything else?<br/>
🎧 Well, I think the <span>price is good.<br/>
🎧 That's probably the most important <span>factor.<br/>
🎧 <span>Okay... <span>cheap <span>price.<br/>
🎧 Which <span>brings us on to the next bit.<br/>
🎧 What's the <span>cost?<br/>
🎧 Well, the <span>pieces we made out of old <span>wood...<br/>
🎧 they <span>cost, <span>ooh, <span>$5.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>electrics?<br/>
🎧 They were more <span>expensive... say, <span>$9.50.<br/>
🎧 <span>Brilliant.<br/>
🎧 Now what do they mean by other <span>comments?<br/>
🎧 It's just a <span>chance for you to say anything about the <span>equipment, and <span>problems you <span>envisage.<br/>
🎧 Well, we would really like help with <span>making <span>plastic <span>instead of <span>wooden <span>pieces.<br/>
🎧 Well, put something like, need help to make <span>plastic <span>pieces.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 And the other thing is, we'd like to <span>develop a <span>range of <span>sizes.<br/>
🎧 That's fine, then, just put that.<br/>
🎧 And the last bit is,<br/>
🎧 when will you <span>send the <span>equipment?<br/>
🎧 Well, we've got a lot of work on at the <span>moment <span>and...<br/>
🎧 we want to get it as good as we can.<br/>
🎧 Well, say <span>25th of <span>June?<br/>
🎧 Can't we make it later?<br/>
🎧 Well, the last date is the <span>1st of <span>July.<br/>
🎧 Why not say that?<br/>
🎧 Okay, that's what I'll put.<br/>
🎧 So, that's the lot!<br/>
🎧 That's <span>brilliant.<br/>
🎧 Thanks very much, <span>Mrs <span>Collins.<br/>
🎧 I'll <span>send it off <span>straight away.<br/>
🎧 Glad to be of help.<br/>
🎧 Very best of <span>luck to you both.<br/>
🎧 Thanks, bye.<br/>
🎧 Bye.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Today I'd like to <span>introduce <span>Ted <span>Hunter,<br/>
🎧 who used to <span>rear <span>sheep and <span>poultry<br/>
🎧 but who is here to tell us about a rather <span>unusual <span>type of <span>livestock<br/>
🎧 that he's been <span>concentrating on in the last few years.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ted <span>Hunter is a <span>member of the <span>Domesticated <span>Ostrich <span>Farming <span>Association,<br/>
🎧 and is here to tell us about the <span>possibilities of <span>breeding and <span>rearing these <span>birds in this <span>country.<br/>
🎧 Thank you, <span>Paula.<br/>
🎧 When you look at <span>international <span>restaurant <span>menus and <span>supermarkets,<br/>
🎧 they all <span>tend to <span>feature the same <span>range of <span>meats <span>-<br/>
🎧 <span>beef, <span>lamb, <span>chicken, <span>pork, that <span>sort of thing.<br/>
🎧 But people are always interested in something <span>different<br/>
🎧 and we're now <span>finding that <span>farming can <span>bring new <span>types of <span>meat to our <span>tables.<br/>
🎧 The <span>kangaroo is one <span>animal that's now being <span>farmed for its <span>meat<br/>
🎧 and <span>eaten outside <span>Australia, where it comes from.<br/>
🎧 It looks and <span>tastes rather like <span>rabbit,<br/>
🎧 though it's <span>slightly <span>darker in <span>colour,<br/>
🎧 but it is rather tough, so that's a <span>problem for some people.<br/>
🎧 <span>Crocodiles are also being <span>farmed for their <span>meat.<br/>
🎧 This is rather like <span>chicken,<br/>
🎧 <span>pale and <span>tender, and it's getting quite <span>fashionable.<br/>
🎧 Some people also find it's rather <span>fatty, <span>but<br/>
🎧 I think it makes a really <span>tasty <span>sandwich.<br/>
🎧 Now a <span>third <span>type of <span>meat <span>becoming <span>increasingly <span>available,<br/>
🎧 and the one that I think is by <span>far the <span>nicest of the <span>three, is <span>ostrich,<br/>
🎧 which most people say has a <span>similar <span>taste and <span>texture to <span>beef.<br/>
🎧 <span>However, it's much better for you than <span>beef, as we'll see later.<br/>
🎧 Most people think of <span>ostriches as <span>wild <span>animals,<br/>
🎧 but in <span>fact <span>ostriches have been <span>farmed in <span>South <span>Africa since around <span>1860.<br/>
🎧 At first they were <span>produced for their <span>feathers.<br/>
🎧 In <span>Africa they were used for <span>tribal <span>ceremonial <span>dress<br/>
🎧 and they were also <span>exported to <span>Europe and <span>America<br/>
🎧 where they were made into <span>ladies' <span>fans and used for <span>decorating <span>hats.<br/>
🎧 Later, <span>feather <span>fans and big, <span>decorated <span>hats went out of <span>fashion<br/>
🎧 but <span>ostriches were still <span>bred,<br/>
🎧 this time for their <span>hide.<br/>
🎧 This can be <span>treated to <span>produce about <span>half a <span>square <span>metre of <span>leather <span>-<br/>
🎧 very <span>delicate, fine <span>stuff of very good <span>quality.<br/>
🎧 At the same time, some of the <span>meat was used for <span>biltong <span>-<br/>
🎧 the <span>air-dried <span>strips of <span>meat <span>popular in <span>South <span>Africa as a <span>sort of <span>fast food.<br/>
🎧 <span>However, <span>recently there's been more and more <span>interest in the <span>development of <span>ostrich <span>farming in other <span>parts of the <span>world,<br/>
🎧 and more people are <span>recognising its <span>value as a food <span>source.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ostrich <span>meat is <span>slightly <span>higher in <span>protein than <span>beef <span>-<br/>
🎧 and much <span>lower in <span>fats and <span>cholesterol.<br/>
🎧 It <span>tastes good too.<br/>
🎧 A <span>series of <span>European <span>taste <span>tests<br/>
🎧 <span>found that <span>82% of people <span>prefer <span>ostrich to <span>beef.<br/>
🎧 And one <span>ostrich <span>produces a lot of <span>meat <span>-<br/>
🎧 from around <span>30 to <span>50 <span>kg <span>mostly from the <span>hindquarters of the <span>bird.<br/>
🎧 <span>Farmed <span>ostriches don't need <span>African <span>climates,<br/>
🎧 and in <span>fact <span>ostrich <span>farming is now <span>becoming well <span>established in other <span>parts of the <span>world.<br/>
🎧 <span>However, <span>setting up an <span>ostrich <span>farm isn't something to <span>embark on <span>lightly.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mature <span>breeding <span>birds are very <span>expensive <span>-<br/>
🎧 even a <span>fertilised <span>ostrich egg isn't <span>cheap<br/>
🎧 so you need quite a bit of <span>capital to <span>begin with.<br/>
🎧 Then the <span>farmer needs special <span>equipment such as <span>incubators for the <span>eggs.<br/>
🎧 The young <span>chicks are very <span>dependent on <span>human <span>minders,<br/>
🎧 and need a lot of <span>attention from the people looking after them.<br/>
🎧 In <span>addition, <span>ostriches can't be <span>intensively <span>farmed <span>-<br/>
🎧 they need <span>space and <span>exercise.<br/>
🎧 But in <span>spite of this, they make good <span>farming <span>sense.<br/>
🎧 A cow <span>produces only one <span>calf a <span>year<br/>
🎧 <span>whereas a <span>female <span>ostrich can lay an egg every other day.<br/>
🎧 And because the <span>farmers can use <span>incubators <span>and...<br/>
🎧 <span>hatched <span>chicks are <span>nourished well and <span>protected from <span>danger,<br/>
🎧 the <span>failure <span>rate on <span>farms is very low <span>indeed<br/>
🎧 and almost all the <span>fertilised <span>eggs will <span>hatch out into <span>chicks<br/>
🎧 which will in <span>turn <span>reach <span>maturity.<br/>
🎧 This is very different from the <span>situation in the <span>wild,<br/>
🎧 where the <span>vast <span>majority of <span>chicks will <span>die or be <span>killed<br/>
🎧 before they <span>grow up into <span>mature <span>ostriches.<br/>
🎧 So it's <span>possible, once the <span>initial <span>outlay has been made,<br/>
🎧 for the <span>farmer to be looking at very good <span>profit <span>margins <span>indeed.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ostrich <span>farming is still in its <span>early <span>days outside <span>Africa<br/>
🎧 but we hope that <span>ostrich <span>meat will be <span>freely <span>available <span>soon<br/>
🎧 and before long will be as <span>cheap as <span>beef.<br/>
<br/><br/>
