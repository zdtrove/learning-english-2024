🎧 Right... let's try and get it sorted out today<br/>
🎧 so we don't have it hanging over us. Okay?<br/>
🎧 Good idea. I'll take notes.<br/>
🎧 First thing... numbers...<br/>
🎧 have we got anything definite?<br/>
🎧 Well... I've been working it out and I think 40 to 43.<br/>
🎧 Shall we put 45 to be on the safe side?<br/>
🎧 Yep, fine.<br/>
🎧 Dates... well, that's straightforward.<br/>
🎧 The last working day before Christmas... which is...<br/>
🎧 which is December the 21st.<br/>
🎧 which is going to be pretty difficult to book at Christmas<br/>
🎧 so we'd better think of two or three places just to be on the safe side.<br/>
🎧 Well, last year's was hopeless.<br/>
🎧 The Red Lion, wasn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yep.<br/>
🎧 We ought to go for something more expensive, cos you...<br/>
🎧 ...you gets what you pay for.<br/>
🎧 That new Indian restaurant in Wetherfield is supposed to be excellent...<br/>
🎧 the Rajdoot.<br/>
🎧 How do you spell that?<br/>
🎧 RAJDOOT.<br/>
🎧 But it's bound to be packed.<br/>
🎧 Well, let's put that down as the first choice and have some back-ups.<br/>
🎧 What about the Park View Hotel as a second choice?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's always reliable.<br/>
🎧 Park View Hotel...<br/>
🎧 And the London Arms in case.<br/>
🎧 London Arms...<br/>
🎧 I'll call them now if you want.<br/>
🎧 No. I'll do it, Joan.<br/>
🎧 You're really busy.<br/>
🎧 Oh, have you got the numbers?<br/>
🎧 Not for the Rajdoot, but...<br/>
🎧 right... Park View Hotel:<br/>
🎧 777192.<br/>
🎧 And London Arms: 208657.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 Before I ring, we'd better just make sure they're within the price range.<br/>
🎧 Up to £15 a head?<br/>
🎧 I think you'll find some people won't be able to go that high.<br/>
🎧 Well, you can't get anything decent under £10.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 We'll say £12?<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 And we'd better make sure there's good vegetarian food.<br/>
🎧 And a non-smoking section!<br/>
🎧 You know what the boss is like.<br/>
🎧 Don't remind me.<br/>
🎧 I'll let you know as soon as I get anything.<br/>
🎧 Good news. I found Rajdoot's number straight away<br/>
🎧 and they can fit us in.<br/>
🎧 Their Christmas menu sounds great.<br/>
🎧 What is it?<br/>
🎧 French onion soup or fruit juice.<br/>
🎧 Roast dinner or lentil curry...<br/>
🎧 sounds ordinary but my friend said it was really tasty.<br/>
🎧 Umm... lentil curry... that's unusual.<br/>
🎧 And then for dessert, there's traditional plum pudding<br/>
🎧 or apple pie, plus coffee.<br/>
🎧 That sounds really good for £12.<br/>
🎧 Did you book it?<br/>
🎧 Well, I said I'd check with the staff first.<br/>
🎧 But they did say they'd hold the booking until next Wednesday anyway.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and if we go ahead, they'd like a £50 deposit.<br/>
🎧 50 is normal... that's fine.<br/>
🎧 And they want a letter.<br/>
🎧 Right... to confirm.<br/>
🎧 They say with such large numbers we have to choose the menu in advance.<br/>
🎧 That won't be a problem.<br/>
🎧 I'll put up a notice with details of the restaurant and the menu.<br/>
🎧 When did you say they wanted confirmation by?<br/>
🎧 It was... let's see...<br/>
🎧 the 4th of November.<br/>
🎧 Where do you think I should put up the notice?<br/>
🎧 Where everyone's guaranteed to see it.<br/>
🎧 On the café noticeboard I should think.<br/>
🎧 Hardly anyone looks at that.<br/>
🎧 Well, the Newsletter is probably your best bet.<br/>
🎧 Good idea.<br/>
🎧 I'll go and do that now.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Welcome to the Sports Centre.<br/>
🎧 It's good to see that there are so many people wanting to find out about our sports facilities.<br/>
🎧 First of all, membership.<br/>
🎧 All students at the college are entitled to become members of the Sports Centre,<br/>
🎧 for an annual fee of £9.50.<br/>
🎧 To register with us and get your membership card,<br/>
🎧 you need to come to reception, between 2 and 6 pm,<br/>
🎧 Monday to Thursday.<br/>
🎧 I'm afraid we can't register new members on Friday,<br/>
🎧 so it's Monday to Thursday, 2 to 6, at reception.<br/>
🎧 Now, there are three things that you must remember to bring with you when you come to register;<br/>
🎧 they are: your Union card,<br/>
🎧 a recent passport-sized photograph of yourself, and the fee.<br/>
🎧 It doesn't matter whether you bring cash or a cheque.<br/>
🎧 We can't issue your card unless you bring all three; so, don't forget:<br/>
🎧 your Union card, passport photo and fee.<br/>
🎧 Then once you have got your sports card,<br/>
🎧 you will need to bring it with you whenever you come to book or use any Sports Centre facilities.<br/>
🎧 Booking over the phone is not allowed,<br/>
🎧 so you have to come here in person, with your card, when you want to book.<br/>
🎧 Our opening hours seem to get longer every year.<br/>
🎧 We are now open from 9am to 10pm on weekdays<br/>
🎧 and from 10am to 6pm on Saturdays.<br/>
🎧 For those of you who are up and about early in the morning,<br/>
🎧 we are introducing a 50% 'morning discount' this year.<br/>
🎧 This is because the facilities tended to be under-used in the mornings last year.<br/>
🎧 It means that all the sessions will be half-price between 9 am and 12 noon on weekdays.<br/>
🎧 So, what exactly are the facilities?<br/>
🎧 What sports can you play here?<br/>
🎧 Well, this room we are in at the moment is called the Main Hall,<br/>
🎧 and it's used mainly for team sports such as football, volleyball and basketball,<br/>
🎧 but also for badminton and aerobics.<br/>
🎧 On the other side of the reception area there is the dance studio;<br/>
🎧 this provides a smaller, more intimate space,<br/>
🎧 which we use for ballet, modern dance and martial arts -<br/>
🎧 not at the same time, of course.<br/>
🎧 Then, in a separate building, which you may have noticed on your way here...<br/>
🎧 it's on the other side of the car park...<br/>
🎧 there are the squash courts, six of them,<br/>
🎧 and at the far end of the building a fitness room.<br/>
🎧 This is our newest facility, only completed in the Spring,<br/>
🎧 but it is already proving to be one of the most popular.<br/>
🎧 As well as all these facilities available here on the campus,<br/>
🎧 we also have an arrangement with the local tennis club,<br/>
🎧 which is only two miles away,<br/>
🎧 entitling our students to use their courts on weekday mornings in the Summer.<br/>
🎧 So, I think that there should be something here for everybody,<br/>
🎧 and I hope to see all of you at the Centre, making use of the facilities.<br/>
🎧 If, in the course of the year,<br/>
🎧 you have any suggestions as to how the service we provide might be improved<br/>
🎧 or its appeal widened,<br/>
🎧 I'll be interested to hear from you.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Good morning, Mrs Collins.<br/>
🎧 I just wondered if you could help me with this entry form for the Young Electronic Engineer competition.<br/>
🎧 Hello, John.<br/>
🎧 Oh, you've made the jigsaw for blind children, with the bleeper.<br/>
🎧 When they put a piece in correctly, that's right.<br/>
🎧 Okay, let's have a look at the form.<br/>
🎧 Right, thanks.<br/>
🎧 I've never filled in one of these before, so...<br/>
🎧 Well, let's just do it in pencil first.<br/>
🎧 So, name of designers...<br/>
🎧 Well, Anne helped me with some of the electronics work.<br/>
🎧 Then you must put her name in as well.<br/>
🎧 Right...<br/>
🎧 Ann Ray.<br/>
🎧 Sorry. It's ANNE<br/>
🎧 and her surname is spelt REA.<br/>
🎧 Good start! Okay...<br/>
🎧 REA.<br/>
🎧 And age is easy. You're both 16.<br/>
🎧 What have you called the design? Keep it short.<br/>
🎧 What about jigsaw puzzle design for visually handicapped?<br/>
🎧 Too long.<br/>
🎧 Just say blind puzzle, that'll do.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Right, now, size of equipment?<br/>
🎧 I've got it noted down here...<br/>
🎧 um, yes, length, sorry, width is 20 centimetres.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Length is 50 centimetres,<br/>
🎧 and then the depth is... well, it's very little.<br/>
🎧 What would you say? I think you can be approximate.<br/>
🎧 I'd say 2.5 centimetres.<br/>
🎧 And the electricity supply?<br/>
🎧 Is it mains operated?<br/>
🎧 No it isn't, it's actually battery.<br/>
🎧 Okay, write battery.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 Okay. It's the next bit that I'm really not sure what to put.<br/>
🎧 Well, special features means...<br/>
🎧 what is really new about this, you know, suitable for the group you made it for.<br/>
🎧 Well, it's safe for children.<br/>
🎧 That's fine. Put that in.<br/>
🎧 Okay, and of course we think it's educational.<br/>
🎧 There you are, you've done it.<br/>
🎧 Anything else?<br/>
🎧 Well, I think the price is good.<br/>
🎧 That's probably the most important factor.<br/>
🎧 Okay... cheap price.<br/>
🎧 Which brings us on to the next bit.<br/>
🎧 What's the cost?<br/>
🎧 Well, the pieces we made out of old wood...<br/>
🎧 they cost, ooh, $5.<br/>
🎧 And the electrics?<br/>
🎧 They were more expensive... say, $9.50.<br/>
🎧 Brilliant.<br/>
🎧 Now what do they mean by other comments?<br/>
🎧 It's just a chance for you to say anything about the equipment, and problems you envisage.<br/>
🎧 Well, we would really like help with making plastic instead of wooden pieces.<br/>
🎧 Well, put something like, need help to make plastic pieces.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 And the other thing is, we'd like to develop a range of sizes.<br/>
🎧 That's fine, then, just put that.<br/>
🎧 And the last bit is,<br/>
🎧 when will you send the equipment?<br/>
🎧 Well, we've got a lot of work on at the moment and...<br/>
🎧 we want to get it as good as we can.<br/>
🎧 Well, say 25th of June?<br/>
🎧 Can't we make it later?<br/>
🎧 Well, the last date is the 1st of July.<br/>
🎧 Why not say that?<br/>
🎧 Okay, that's what I'll put.<br/>
🎧 So, that's the lot!<br/>
🎧 That's brilliant.<br/>
🎧 Thanks very much, Mrs Collins.<br/>
🎧 I'll send it off straight away.<br/>
🎧 Glad to be of help.<br/>
🎧 Very best of luck to you both.<br/>
🎧 Thanks, bye.<br/>
🎧 Bye.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Today I'd like to introduce Ted Hunter,<br/>
🎧 who used to rear sheep and poultry<br/>
🎧 but who is here to tell us about a rather unusual type of livestock<br/>
🎧 that he's been concentrating on in the last few years.<br/>
🎧 Ted Hunter is a member of the Domesticated Ostrich Farming Association,<br/>
🎧 and is here to tell us about the possibilities of breeding and rearing these birds in this country.<br/>
🎧 Thank you, Paula.<br/>
🎧 When you look at international restaurant menus and supermarkets,<br/>
🎧 they all tend to feature the same range of meats -<br/>
🎧 beef, lamb, chicken, pork, that sort of thing.<br/>
🎧 But people are always interested in something different<br/>
🎧 and we're now finding that farming can bring new types of meat to our tables.<br/>
🎧 The kangaroo is one animal that's now being farmed for its meat<br/>
🎧 and eaten outside Australia, where it comes from.<br/>
🎧 It looks and tastes rather like rabbit,<br/>
🎧 though it's slightly darker in colour,<br/>
🎧 but it is rather tough, so that's a problem for some people.<br/>
🎧 Crocodiles are also being farmed for their meat.<br/>
🎧 This is rather like chicken,<br/>
🎧 pale and tender, and it's getting quite fashionable.<br/>
🎧 Some people also find it's rather fatty, but<br/>
🎧 I think it makes a really tasty sandwich.<br/>
🎧 Now a third type of meat becoming increasingly available,<br/>
🎧 and the one that I think is by far the nicest of the three, is ostrich,<br/>
🎧 which most people say has a similar taste and texture to beef.<br/>
🎧 However, it's much better for you than beef, as we'll see later.<br/>
🎧 Most people think of ostriches as wild animals,<br/>
🎧 but in fact ostriches have been farmed in South Africa since around 1860.<br/>
🎧 At first they were produced for their feathers.<br/>
🎧 In Africa they were used for tribal ceremonial dress<br/>
🎧 and they were also exported to Europe and America<br/>
🎧 where they were made into ladies' fans and used for decorating hats.<br/>
🎧 Later, feather fans and big, decorated hats went out of fashion<br/>
🎧 but ostriches were still bred,<br/>
🎧 this time for their hide.<br/>
🎧 This can be treated to produce about half a square metre of leather -<br/>
🎧 very delicate, fine stuff of very good quality.<br/>
🎧 At the same time, some of the meat was used for biltong -<br/>
🎧 the air-dried strips of meat popular in South Africa as a sort of fast food.<br/>
🎧 However, recently there's been more and more interest in the development of ostrich farming in other parts of the world,<br/>
🎧 and more people are recognising its value as a food source.<br/>
🎧 Ostrich meat is slightly higher in protein than beef -<br/>
🎧 and much lower in fats and cholesterol.<br/>
🎧 It tastes good too.<br/>
🎧 A series of European taste tests<br/>
🎧 found that 82% of people prefer ostrich to beef.<br/>
🎧 And one ostrich produces a lot of meat -<br/>
🎧 from around 30 to 50 kg mostly from the hindquarters of the bird.<br/>
🎧 Farmed ostriches don't need African climates,<br/>
🎧 and in fact ostrich farming is now becoming well established in other parts of the world.<br/>
🎧 However, setting up an ostrich farm isn't something to embark on lightly.<br/>
🎧 Mature breeding birds are very expensive -<br/>
🎧 even a fertilised ostrich egg isn't cheap<br/>
🎧 so you need quite a bit of capital to begin with.<br/>
🎧 Then the farmer needs special equipment such as incubators for the eggs.<br/>
🎧 The young chicks are very dependent on human minders,<br/>
🎧 and need a lot of attention from the people looking after them.<br/>
🎧 In addition, ostriches can't be intensively farmed -<br/>
🎧 they need space and exercise.<br/>
🎧 But in spite of this, they make good farming sense.<br/>
🎧 A cow produces only one calf a year<br/>
🎧 whereas a female ostrich can lay an egg every other day.<br/>
🎧 And because the farmers can use incubators and...<br/>
🎧 hatched chicks are nourished well and protected from danger,<br/>
🎧 the failure rate on farms is very low indeed<br/>
🎧 and almost all the fertilised eggs will hatch out into chicks<br/>
🎧 which will in turn reach maturity.<br/>
🎧 This is very different from the situation in the wild,<br/>
🎧 where the vast majority of chicks will die or be killed<br/>
🎧 before they grow up into mature ostriches.<br/>
🎧 So it's possible, once the initial outlay has been made,<br/>
🎧 for the farmer to be looking at very good profit margins indeed.<br/>
🎧 Ostrich farming is still in its early days outside Africa<br/>
🎧 but we hope that ostrich meat will be freely available soon<br/>
🎧 and before long will be as cheap as beef.<br/>
<br/><br/>
