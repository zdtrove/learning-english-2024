🎧 Good morning. Total Insurance.<br/>
🎧 Judy speaking, how may I help you?<br/>
🎧 I recently shipped my belongings from overseas back here to Australia<br/>
🎧 and I took out insurance with your company.<br/>
🎧 Some items were damaged during the move so I need to make a claim.<br/>
🎧 What do I have to do?<br/>
🎧 Okay, well first I need to get a few details about this.<br/>
🎧 Can you give me your name please?<br/>
🎧 Yes. It's Michael Alexander.<br/>
🎧 Okay. And your address, please?<br/>
🎧 My old address or my current one?<br/>
🎧 Your current one.<br/>
🎧 It's 24 Manly Street, Milperra near Sydney.<br/>
🎧 What was the suburb, sorry?<br/>
🎧 Milperra.<br/>
🎧 MILPERRA.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Now, who was the shipping agent, Mr Alexander?<br/>
🎧 You mean the company we used?<br/>
🎧 Yes, the company who packed everything up at the point of origin.<br/>
🎧 Oh, it was… erm…<br/>
🎧 First Class Movers.<br/>
🎧 Okay…<br/>
🎧 where were the goods shipped from?<br/>
🎧 China,<br/>
🎧 but the ship came via Singapore and was there for about a week.<br/>
🎧 Don't worry, all of that information will be in the documentation.<br/>
🎧 Now, the dates.<br/>
🎧 Do you know when the ship arrived?<br/>
🎧 It left on the 11th of October<br/>
🎧 and got to Sydney on the 28th of November.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 I need one more thing.<br/>
🎧 There's a reference number.<br/>
🎧 It should be in the top right-hand corner of the pink form they gave you.<br/>
🎧 Uh... let me have a look.<br/>
🎧 Uh, yes, here it is.<br/>
🎧 It's 601ACK.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 I need to take down a few details of the actual damage over the phone before you put in a full report.<br/>
🎧 Can you tell me how many items were damaged and what the damage was?<br/>
🎧 Yes, well four things actually.<br/>
🎧 I'll start with the big things.<br/>
🎧 My TV first of all.<br/>
🎧 It's a large one… very expensive.<br/>
🎧 Our insurance doesn't cover electrical problems.<br/>
🎧 It isn't an electrical problem.<br/>
🎧 The screen has a huge crack in it so it's unusable.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 Any idea of the price to repair it?<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 Well, I don't think it can be repaired.<br/>
🎧 It will need a new one.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 I'll make a note of that and we'll see what we can do.<br/>
🎧 Now, what was the second item?<br/>
🎧 The cabinet from the bathroom was damaged as well.<br/>
🎧 It's a lovely cabinet, we use it to keep our towels in.<br/>
🎧 And what is the extent of the damage?<br/>
🎧 Well, the back and the sides seem okay<br/>
🎧 but the door has a huge hole in it.<br/>
🎧 It can't be repaired.<br/>
🎧 I'm really not very happy about it.<br/>
🎧 And how much do you think it will cost to replace it?<br/>
🎧 Well, when I bought it last year, I paid $125 for it.<br/>
🎧 But the one I've seen here in Sydney is a bit more expensive,<br/>
🎧 it's $140.<br/>
🎧 Right, and what was the third item?<br/>
🎧 My dining room table.<br/>
🎧 It's a lovely table from Indonesia.<br/>
🎧 It must have been very hot inside the container<br/>
🎧 because one leg has completely split down the middle.<br/>
🎧 The top and the other three look okay, thank goodness.<br/>
🎧 Any idea of the price to repair it?<br/>
🎧 Well, I had an estimate done on this actually because it is a very special table to us.<br/>
🎧 They quoted us $200, which is really pricey<br/>
🎧 so I hope the insurance will cover the total cost.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure that will be fine.<br/>
🎧 What was the last item, Mr Alexander?<br/>
🎧 Well, we have a lovely set of china plates and dishes,<br/>
🎧 you know, with matching cups, saucers, the lot.<br/>
🎧 They were all in the one box which must have got dropped because some plates were broken - six actually.<br/>
🎧 And can you tell me the replacement value of these?<br/>
🎧 Well, it's hard to say because they were part of a set<br/>
🎧 but they can be up to $10 each as it's such a good set.<br/>
🎧 Okay, so that would be around $60 altogether?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's right.<br/>
🎧 And is that all of the items?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 So what do I have to do now?<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Welcome to Green Vale Agricultural Park.<br/>
🎧 As you know, we have only been open a week,<br/>
🎧 so you are amongst our first visitors.<br/>
🎧 We have lots of fascinating indoor and outdoor exhibits on our huge complex, spreading hundreds of hectares.<br/>
🎧 Our remit is to give educational opportunities to the wider public<br/>
🎧 as well as to offer research sites for a wide variety of agriculturists and other scientists.<br/>
🎧 Let's start by seeing what there is to do.<br/>
🎧 As you can see here on our giant wall plan,<br/>
🎧 we are now situated in the Reception block… here.<br/>
🎧 As you walk out of the main door into the park,<br/>
🎧 there's a path you can follow.<br/>
🎧 If you follow this route,<br/>
🎧 you will immediately come into the Rare Breeds section,<br/>
🎧 where we keep a wide variety of animals<br/>
🎧 which I shall be telling you a little more about later.<br/>
🎧 Next to this… moving east… is the large grazing area for the rare breeds.<br/>
🎧 Then further east… in the largest section of our Park is the Forest Area.<br/>
🎧 South of the grazing area, and in fact, just next to the Reception block is our Experimental Crop Area.<br/>
🎧 In the middle of the Park… this circular area is our lake…<br/>
🎧 These two small rectangular shapes here…<br/>
🎧 are the Fish Farms where we rear fish for sale.<br/>
🎧 To the east of those is the marsh area,<br/>
🎧 which attracts a great many migrant birds<br/>
🎧 In the south-eastern corner, beyond the marsh,<br/>
🎧 is our Market Garden area, growing vegetables and flowers.<br/>
🎧 All these areas can be visited by the general public for almost all the year…<br/>
🎧 although… please take note of the large signs at the entrance to each area<br/>
🎧 which tell you when certain areas are being used for particular controlled experiments<br/>
🎧 and are therefore temporarily out of bounds to the public.<br/>
🎧 You can see for yourself what a huge area the park covers<br/>
🎧 and a key question is always, how can we move around?<br/>
🎧 Well you have a choice of means…<br/>
🎧 all environmentally friendly…<br/>
🎧 cars are banned in the park.<br/>
🎧 We have bicycles which you can hire behind the Reception block… here…<br/>
🎧 the healthy ones of you can go on foot<br/>
🎧 and finally there's our electric tram, powered from solar cells.<br/>
🎧 You find more information about this at the front entrance.<br/>
🎧 A good place to start on your tour is the Rare Breeds section.<br/>
🎧 We keep goats, sheep and hens and other kinds of poultry.<br/>
🎧 We are also thinking of bringing in cows and horses<br/>
🎧 but we do not, as yet, have facilities for these bigger animals.<br/>
🎧 The animals are fed in public twice a day<br/>
🎧 and a short lecture given on their feeding habits and nutritional needs.<br/>
🎧 These are very popular with the public but...<br/>
🎧 of course we mustn't lose sight of the main purpose of having this section,<br/>
🎧 not as such to preserve rare animals but to maintain the diversity of breeds<br/>
🎧 to broaden the gene pool for agricultural development.<br/>
🎧 Green Vale changes with the seasons with different events happening at different times of the year.<br/>
🎧 May will be perhaps our most spectacular month with the arrival of the Canada geese<br/>
🎧 and when our fruit trees will be in full blossom,<br/>
🎧 but there are interesting events on all year round….<br/>
🎧 for example John Havers, our expert fly fisherman, is currently giving displays on the lake.<br/>
🎧 Each of the sections has its own seasonal calendar…<br/>
🎧 please consult the summary board at the main entrance.<br/>
🎧 And the final section, as we return to the Reception blocks, is the orchard.<br/>
🎧 Do take time to browse round our shop…<br/>
🎧 there's a wide selection of books on wildlife,<br/>
🎧 some of them written by local authors,<br/>
🎧 and the history of farming, including organic farming,<br/>
🎧 something which the park will be diversifying into in the coming months.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Good morning, everyone.<br/>
🎧 In today's seminar, Grant Freeman, a biologist who specialises in identifying insects,<br/>
🎧 and who works for the Australian Quarantine Service,<br/>
🎧 has come to talk to us about his current research work.<br/>
🎧 Right, well, over to you, Grant.<br/>
🎧 Good morning, everyone.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure that you know that the quarantine service regulates all food brought into Australia.<br/>
🎧 Well, obviously they want to protect Australia from diseases that might come in with imported goods,<br/>
🎧 but they also want to prevent insect pests from being introduced into the country,<br/>
🎧 and that's where I have a part to play.<br/>
🎧 Anyway, my current research involves trying to find a particular type of bee:<br/>
🎧 the Asian Honey Bee<br/>
🎧 and finding out whether there are any of them around in various states of Australia.<br/>
🎧 We discovered a few of them in Queensland once and eradicated them.<br/>
🎧 Now, we're pretty keen to make sure that there aren't any more getting in,<br/>
🎧 particularly to New South Wales and other states.<br/>
🎧 What's wrong with Asian Honey Bees?<br/>
🎧 Are they so different from Australian bees?<br/>
🎧 Well, in fact, they look almost the same,<br/>
🎧 but they are infested with mites -<br/>
🎧 microscopic creatures which live on them,<br/>
🎧 and which can seriously damage our own home-grown bees, or could even wipe them out.<br/>
🎧 Well, what would happen if Australian bees died out?<br/>
🎧 Well, the honey from Australian bees is of excellent quality,<br/>
🎧 much better than the stuff the Asian bees produce.<br/>
🎧 In fact, Australia exports native Queen bees to a large number of countries because of this.<br/>
🎧 When the European Honey Bee was first discovered out in the bush,<br/>
🎧 we found they made really unpleasant honey<br/>
🎧 and they were also too big to pollinate many of our native flowers here in Australia.<br/>
🎧 That must have had a devastating effect on the natural flora.<br/>
🎧 Did you lose any species?<br/>
🎧 No, we managed to get them under control before that happened<br/>
🎧 but if Asian bees got in there could be other consequences.<br/>
🎧 We could lose a lot of money because you might not be aware,<br/>
🎧 but it's estimated that native bees' pollination of flower and vegetable crops is worth 1.2 billion dollars a year.<br/>
🎧 So in a way they're the farmer's friend.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and another thing is, if you're stung by an Asian Honey Bee,<br/>
🎧 it can produce an allergic reaction in some people;<br/>
🎧 so they're much more dangerous than native bees.<br/>
🎧 How will you know if Asian bees have entered Australia?<br/>
🎧 We're looking at the diet of the bird called the Rainbow Bee Eater.<br/>
🎧 The Bee Eater doesn't care what it eats, as long as they're insects.<br/>
🎧 But the interesting thing about this bird is that we are able to analyse exactly what it eats<br/>
🎧 and that's really helpful if we're looking for introduced insects.<br/>
🎧 How come?<br/>
🎧 Because insects have their skeletons outside their bodies,<br/>
🎧 so the Bee Eaters digest the meat from the inside.<br/>
🎧 Then they bring up all the indigestible bits of skeleton<br/>
🎧 and, of course, the wings in a pellet -<br/>
🎧 a small ball of waste material which they cough up.<br/>
🎧 That sounds a bit unpleasant.<br/>
🎧 So, how do you go about it?<br/>
🎧 In the field, we track down the Bee Eaters and find their favourite feeding spots,<br/>
🎧 you know, the places where the birds usually feed.<br/>
🎧 It's here that we can find the pellets.<br/>
🎧 We collect them up and take them back to the laboratory to examine the contents.<br/>
🎧 How do you do that?<br/>
🎧 The pellets are really hard, especially if they have been out in the sun for a few days<br/>
🎧 so, first of all, we treat them by adding water to moisten them and make them softer.<br/>
🎧 Then we pull them apart under the microscope.<br/>
🎧 Everything's all scrunched up but we're looking for wings so we just pull them all out and straighten them.<br/>
🎧 Then we identify them to see if we can find any Asian bee wings.<br/>
🎧 And how many have you found?<br/>
🎧 So far our research shows that Asian bees have not entered Australia in any number -<br/>
🎧 it's a good result and much more reliable than trying to find live ones as evidence of introduced insects.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's fascinating!<br/>
🎧 Thank you, Grant, for those insights.<br/>
🎧 I hope that you might inspire some of our students here to conduct some similar experiments.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 I've been doing some research into what people in Britain think of doctors,<br/>
🎧 the ones who work in general practice - the first call for medical care -<br/>
🎧 and comparing this with the situation in a couple of other countries.<br/>
🎧 I want to talk about the rationale behind what I decided to do.<br/>
🎧 Now I had to set up my programme of research in three different countries<br/>
🎧 so I approached postgraduates in my field in overseas departments,<br/>
🎧 contacting them by email, to organize things for me at their end.<br/>
🎧 I thought I would have trouble recruiting help<br/>
🎧 but in fact everyone was very willing and sometimes their tutors got involved too.<br/>
🎧 I had to give my helpers clear instructions about what kind of sample population I wanted them to use.<br/>
🎧 I decided that people under 18 should be excluded<br/>
🎧 because most of them are students or looking for their first job,<br/>
🎧 and also I decided at this stage, just to focus on men who were in employment,<br/>
🎧 and set up something for people who didn't have jobs<br/>
🎧 and for employed women later on as a separate investigation.<br/>
🎧 I specifically wanted to do a questionnaire,<br/>
🎧 and interviews with a focus group.<br/>
🎧 With the questionnaire, rather than limiting it to one specific point,<br/>
🎧 I wanted to include as much variety as possible.<br/>
🎧 I know questionnaires are a very controlled way to do things<br/>
🎧 but I thought I could do taped interviews later on to counteract the effects of this.<br/>
🎧 And the focus group may also prove useful in future,<br/>
🎧 by targeting subjects I can easily return to,<br/>
🎧 as the participants tend to be more involved.<br/>
🎧 So I'm just collating the results now.<br/>
🎧 At the moment, it looks as if, in the UK,<br/>
🎧 despite the fact that newspapers continually report that people are unhappy with medical care,<br/>
🎧 in fact, it is mainly the third level of care,<br/>
🎧 which takes place in hospitals, that they are worried about.<br/>
🎧 Government reforms have been proposed at all levels<br/>
🎧 and although their success is not guaranteed,<br/>
🎧 long-term hospital care is in fact probably less of an issue<br/>
🎧 than the media would have us believe.<br/>
🎧 However, I've still got quite a bit of data to look at.<br/>
🎧 Certainly I will need to do more far-reaching research than I had anticipated<br/>
🎧 in order to establish if people want extra medical staff invested in the community,<br/>
🎧 or if they want care to revert to fewer, but larger, key medical units.<br/>
🎧 The solution may well be something that can be easily implemented<br/>
🎧 by those responsible in local government,<br/>
🎧 with central government support, of course.<br/>
🎧 This first stage has proved very valuable though.<br/>
🎧 I was surprised by how willing most of the subjects were to get involved in the project -<br/>
🎧 I had expected some unwillingness to answer questions honestly.<br/>
🎧 But I was taken aback and rather concerned that something I thought I'd set up very well...<br/>
🎧 didn't necessarily seem that way to everyone in my own department.<br/>
🎧 I thought you might also be interested in some of the problems I encountered in collecting my data.<br/>
🎧 There were odd cases that threw me -<br/>
🎧 one of the subjects who I had approached while he was out shopping in town,<br/>
🎧 decided to pull out when it came to the second round.<br/>
🎧 It was a shame as it was someone who I would like to have interviewed more closely.<br/>
🎧 And one of the first-year students I interviewed<br/>
🎧 wanted reassurance that no names would be traceable from the answers.<br/>
🎧 I was so surprised,<br/>
🎧 because they think nothing of telling you about themselves and their opinions in seminar groups!<br/>
🎧 Then, one of the people that I work with got a bit funny.<br/>
🎧 The questions were quite personal<br/>
🎧 and one minute he said he'd do it,<br/>
🎧 then the next day he wouldn't,<br/>
🎧 and in the end he did do it.<br/>
🎧 It's hard not to get angry in that situation<br/>
🎧 but I tried to keep focused on the overall picture in order to stay calm.<br/>
🎧 The most bizarre case was a telephone interview I did with a teacher at a university in France.<br/>
🎧 He answered all my questions in great detail -<br/>
🎧 but then when I asked how much access he had to dangerous substances,<br/>
🎧 he wouldn't tell me exactly what his work involved.<br/>
<br/><br/>
