🎧 Good morning. <span>Total</span> <span>Insurance</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Judy</span> <span>speaking</span>, how may I help you?<br/>
🎧 I <span>recently</span> <span>shipped</span> my <span>belongings</span> from <span>overseas</span> back here to <span>Australia<br/></span>
🎧 and I took out <span>insurance</span> with your company.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>items</span> were <span>damaged</span> during the move so I need to make a <span>claim</span>.<br/>
🎧 What do I have to do?<br/>
🎧 Okay, well first I need to get a few <span>details</span> about this.<br/>
🎧 Can you give me your name please?<br/>
🎧 Yes. It's <span>Michael</span> <span>Alexander</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay. And your <span>address</span>, please?<br/>
🎧 My old <span>address</span> or my <span>current</span> one?<br/>
🎧 Your <span>current</span> one.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>24</span> <span>Manly</span> <span>Street</span>, <span>Milperra</span> near <span>Sydney</span>.<br/>
🎧 What was the <span>suburb</span>, sorry?<br/>
🎧 <span>Milperra</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>MILPERRA</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Now, who was the <span>shipping</span> <span>agent</span>, Mr <span>Alexander</span>?<br/>
🎧 You mean the company we used?<br/>
🎧 Yes, the company who <span>packed</span> everything up at the <span>point</span> of <span>origin</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, it <span>was…</span> <span>erm…<br/></span>
🎧 First Class <span>Movers</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Okay…<br/></span>
🎧 where were the <span>goods</span> <span>shipped</span> from?<br/>
🎧 <span>China</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>ship</span> came <span>via</span> <span>Singapore</span> and was there for about a week.<br/>
🎧 Don't <span>worry</span>, all of that <span>information</span> will be in the <span>documentation</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, the <span>dates</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you know when the <span>ship</span> <span>arrived</span>?<br/>
🎧 It <span>left</span> on the <span>11th</span> of <span>October<br/></span>
🎧 and got to <span>Sydney</span> on the <span>28th</span> of <span>November</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 I need one more thing.<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>reference</span> number.<br/>
🎧 It should be in the top <span>right-hand</span> <span>corner</span> of the <span>pink</span> <span>form</span> they gave you.<br/>
🎧 <span>Uh..</span>. let me have a look.<br/>
🎧 Uh, yes, here it is.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>601ACK</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 I need to take down a few <span>details</span> of the <span>actual</span> <span>damage</span> over the phone before you put in a full <span>report</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can you tell me how many <span>items</span> were <span>damaged</span> and what the <span>damage</span> was?<br/>
🎧 Yes, well <span>four</span> things actually.<br/>
🎧 I'll start with the big things.<br/>
🎧 My <span>TV</span> first of all.<br/>
🎧 It's a large <span>one…</span> very <span>expensive</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>insurance</span> doesn't <span>cover</span> <span>electrical</span> <span>problems</span>.<br/>
🎧 It isn't an <span>electrical</span> <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>screen</span> has a <span>huge</span> <span>crack</span> in it so it's <span>unusable</span>.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 Any idea of the <span>price</span> to <span>repair</span> it?<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 Well, I don't think it can be <span>repaired</span>.<br/>
🎧 It will need a new one.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 I'll make a <span>note</span> of that and we'll see what we can do.<br/>
🎧 Now, what was the second <span>item</span>?<br/>
🎧 The <span>cabinet</span> from the <span>bathroom</span> was <span>damaged</span> as well.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>lovely</span> <span>cabinet</span>, we use it to keep our <span>towels</span> in.<br/>
🎧 And what is the <span>extent</span> of the <span>damage</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, the back and the <span>sides</span> <span>seem</span> <span>okay<br/></span>
🎧 but the <span>door</span> has a <span>huge</span> <span>hole</span> in it.<br/>
🎧 It can't be <span>repaired</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm really not very happy about it.<br/>
🎧 And how much do you think it will <span>cost</span> to <span>replace</span> it?<br/>
🎧 Well, when I <span>bought</span> it last year, I <span>paid</span> <span>$125</span> for it.<br/>
🎧 But the one I've <span>seen</span> here in <span>Sydney</span> is a bit more <span>expensive</span>,<br/>
🎧 it's <span>$140</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, and what was the <span>third</span> <span>item</span>?<br/>
🎧 My <span>dining</span> room <span>table</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>lovely</span> <span>table</span> from <span>Indonesia</span>.<br/>
🎧 It must have been very hot inside the <span>container<br/></span>
🎧 because one leg has <span>completely</span> <span>split</span> down the <span>middle</span>.<br/>
🎧 The top and the other <span>three</span> look okay, thank <span>goodness</span>.<br/>
🎧 Any idea of the <span>price</span> to <span>repair</span> it?<br/>
🎧 Well, I had an <span>estimate</span> done on this actually because it is a very special <span>table</span> to us.<br/>
🎧 They <span>quoted</span> us <span>$200</span>, which is really <span>pricey<br/></span>
🎧 so I hope the <span>insurance</span> will <span>cover</span> the <span>total</span> <span>cost</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure that will be fine.<br/>
🎧 What was the last <span>item</span>, Mr <span>Alexander</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, we have a <span>lovely</span> set of <span>china</span> <span>plates</span> and <span>dishes</span>,<br/>
🎧 you know, with <span>matching</span> <span>cups</span>, <span>saucers</span>, the lot.<br/>
🎧 They were all in the one box which must have got <span>dropped</span> because some <span>plates</span> were <span>broken</span> <span>-</span> six actually.<br/>
🎧 And can you tell me the <span>replacement</span> <span>value</span> of these?<br/>
🎧 Well, it's <span>hard</span> to say because they were <span>part</span> of a <span>set<br/></span>
🎧 but they can be up to <span>$10</span> each as it's such a good set.<br/>
🎧 Okay, so that would be around <span>$60</span> <span>altogether</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's right.<br/>
🎧 And is that all of the <span>items</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 So what do I have to do now?<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 <span>Welcome</span> to <span>Green</span> <span>Vale</span> <span>Agricultural</span> <span>Park</span>.<br/>
🎧 As you know, we have only been open a week,<br/>
🎧 so you are <span>amongst</span> our first <span>visitors</span>.<br/>
🎧 We have lots of <span>fascinating</span> <span>indoor</span> and <span>outdoor</span> <span>exhibits</span> on our <span>huge</span> <span>complex</span>, <span>spreading</span> <span>hundreds</span> of <span>hectares</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>remit</span> is to give <span>educational</span> <span>opportunities</span> to the <span>wider</span> <span>public<br/></span>
🎧 as well as to <span>offer</span> <span>research</span> <span>sites</span> for a <span>wide</span> <span>variety</span> of <span>agriculturists</span> and other <span>scientists</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's start by <span>seeing</span> what there is to do.<br/>
🎧 As you can see here on our <span>giant</span> <span>wall</span> plan,<br/>
🎧 we are now <span>situated</span> in the <span>Reception</span> <span>block…</span> here.<br/>
🎧 As you <span>walk</span> out of the <span>main</span> <span>door</span> into the <span>park</span>,<br/>
🎧 there's a <span>path</span> you can <span>follow</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you <span>follow</span> this <span>route</span>,<br/>
🎧 you will <span>immediately</span> come into the <span>Rare</span> <span>Breeds</span> <span>section</span>,<br/>
🎧 where we keep a <span>wide</span> <span>variety</span> of <span>animals<br/></span>
🎧 which I shall be <span>telling</span> you a little more about later.<br/>
🎧 Next to <span>this…</span> <span>moving</span> <span>east…</span> is the large <span>grazing</span> <span>area</span> for the <span>rare</span> <span>breeds</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then <span>further</span> <span>east…</span> in the <span>largest</span> <span>section</span> of our <span>Park</span> is the <span>Forest</span> <span>Area</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>South</span> of the <span>grazing</span> <span>area</span>, and in <span>fact</span>, just next to the <span>Reception</span> <span>block</span> is our <span>Experimental</span> <span>Crop</span> <span>Area</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>middle</span> of the <span>Park…</span> this <span>circular</span> <span>area</span> is our <span>lake…<br/></span>
🎧 These two small <span>rectangular</span> <span>shapes</span> <span>here…<br/></span>
🎧 are the <span>Fish</span> <span>Farms</span> where we <span>rear</span> <span>fish</span> for <span>sale</span>.<br/>
🎧 To the <span>east</span> of those is the <span>marsh</span> <span>area</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>attracts</span> a great many <span>migrant</span> <span>birds<br/></span>
🎧 In the <span>south-eastern</span> <span>corner</span>, <span>beyond</span> the <span>marsh</span>,<br/>
🎧 is our <span>Market</span> Garden <span>area</span>, <span>growing</span> <span>vegetables</span> and <span>flowers</span>.<br/>
🎧 All these <span>areas</span> can be <span>visited</span> by the <span>general</span> <span>public</span> for almost all the <span>year…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>although…</span> please take <span>note</span> of the large <span>signs</span> at the <span>entrance</span> to each <span>area<br/></span>
🎧 which tell you when <span>certain</span> <span>areas</span> are being used for <span>particular</span> <span>controlled</span> <span>experiments<br/></span>
🎧 and are <span>therefore</span> <span>temporarily</span> out of <span>bounds</span> to the <span>public</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can see for yourself what a <span>huge</span> <span>area</span> the <span>park</span> <span>covers<br/></span>
🎧 and a key <span>question</span> is always, how can we move around?<br/>
🎧 Well you have a <span>choice</span> of <span>means…<br/></span>
🎧 all <span>environmentally</span> <span>friendly…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>cars</span> are <span>banned</span> in the <span>park</span>.<br/>
🎧 We have <span>bicycles</span> which you can <span>hire</span> behind the <span>Reception</span> <span>block…</span> <span>here…<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>healthy</span> <span>ones</span> of you can go on <span>foot<br/></span>
🎧 and finally there's our <span>electric</span> <span>tram</span>, <span>powered</span> from <span>solar</span> <span>cells</span>.<br/>
🎧 You find more <span>information</span> about this at the <span>front</span> <span>entrance</span>.<br/>
🎧 A good place to start on your <span>tour</span> is the <span>Rare</span> <span>Breeds</span> <span>section</span>.<br/>
🎧 We keep <span>goats</span>, <span>sheep</span> and <span>hens</span> and other <span>kinds</span> of <span>poultry</span>.<br/>
🎧 We are also thinking of <span>bringing</span> in <span>cows</span> and <span>horses<br/></span>
🎧 but we do not, as yet, have <span>facilities</span> for these <span>bigger</span> <span>animals</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>animals</span> are <span>fed</span> in <span>public</span> <span>twice</span> a <span>day<br/></span>
🎧 and a short <span>lecture</span> <span>given</span> on their <span>feeding</span> <span>habits</span> and <span>nutritional</span> needs.<br/>
🎧 These are very <span>popular</span> with the <span>public</span> <span>but..</span>.<br/>
🎧 of course we mustn't <span>lose</span> <span>sight</span> of the <span>main</span> <span>purpose</span> of having this <span>section</span>,<br/>
🎧 not as such to <span>preserve</span> <span>rare</span> <span>animals</span> but to <span>maintain</span> the <span>diversity</span> of <span>breeds<br/></span>
🎧 to <span>broaden</span> the <span>gene</span> <span>pool</span> for <span>agricultural</span> <span>development</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Green</span> <span>Vale</span> changes with the <span>seasons</span> with different <span>events</span> <span>happening</span> at different <span>times</span> of the year.<br/>
🎧 May will be <span>perhaps</span> our most <span>spectacular</span> month with the <span>arrival</span> of the <span>Canada</span> <span>geese<br/></span>
🎧 and when our <span>fruit</span> <span>trees</span> will be in full <span>blossom</span>,<br/>
🎧 but there are <span>interesting</span> <span>events</span> on all year <span>round…</span>.<br/>
🎧 for example <span>John</span> <span>Havers</span>, our <span>expert</span> fly <span>fisherman</span>, is <span>currently</span> <span>giving</span> <span>displays</span> on the <span>lake</span>.<br/>
🎧 Each of the <span>sections</span> has its own <span>seasonal</span> <span>calendar…<br/></span>
🎧 please <span>consult</span> the <span>summary</span> <span>board</span> at the <span>main</span> <span>entrance</span>.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>final</span> <span>section</span>, as we <span>return</span> to the <span>Reception</span> <span>blocks</span>, is the <span>orchard</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do take time to <span>browse</span> <span>round</span> our <span>shop…<br/></span>
🎧 there's a <span>wide</span> <span>selection</span> of books on <span>wildlife</span>,<br/>
🎧 some of them <span>written</span> by <span>local</span> <span>authors</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>history</span> of <span>farming</span>, <span>including</span> <span>organic</span> <span>farming</span>,<br/>
🎧 something which the <span>park</span> will be <span>diversifying</span> into in the <span>coming</span> <span>months</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Good morning, everyone.<br/>
🎧 In <span>today's</span> <span>seminar</span>, <span>Grant</span> <span>Freeman</span>, a <span>biologist</span> who <span>specialises</span> in <span>identifying</span> <span>insects</span>,<br/>
🎧 and who <span>works</span> for the <span>Australian</span> <span>Quarantine</span> <span>Service</span>,<br/>
🎧 has come to talk to us about his <span>current</span> <span>research</span> work.<br/>
🎧 Right, well, over to you, <span>Grant</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good morning, everyone.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure that you know that the <span>quarantine</span> <span>service</span> <span>regulates</span> all food <span>brought</span> into <span>Australia</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>obviously</span> they want to <span>protect</span> <span>Australia</span> from <span>diseases</span> that might come in with <span>imported</span> <span>goods</span>,<br/>
🎧 but they also want to <span>prevent</span> <span>insect</span> <span>pests</span> from being <span>introduced</span> into the <span>country</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that's where I have a <span>part</span> to play.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, my <span>current</span> <span>research</span> <span>involves</span> trying to find a <span>particular</span> <span>type</span> of <span>bee:<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>Asian</span> <span>Honey</span> <span>Bee<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>finding</span> out <span>whether</span> there are any of them around in <span>various</span> <span>states</span> of <span>Australia</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>discovered</span> a few of them in <span>Queensland</span> once and <span>eradicated</span> them.<br/>
🎧 Now, we're <span>pretty</span> <span>keen</span> to make sure that there aren't any more getting in,<br/>
🎧 <span>particularly</span> to New <span>South</span> <span>Wales</span> and other <span>states</span>.<br/>
🎧 What's wrong with <span>Asian</span> <span>Honey</span> <span>Bees</span>?<br/>
🎧 Are they so different from <span>Australian</span> <span>bees</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, in <span>fact</span>, they look almost the same,<br/>
🎧 but they are <span>infested</span> with <span>mites</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>microscopic</span> <span>creatures</span> which live on them,<br/>
🎧 and which can <span>seriously</span> <span>damage</span> our own <span>home-grown</span> <span>bees</span>, or could even <span>wipe</span> them out.<br/>
🎧 Well, what would <span>happen</span> if <span>Australian</span> <span>bees</span> <span>died</span> out?<br/>
🎧 Well, the <span>honey</span> from <span>Australian</span> <span>bees</span> is of <span>excellent</span> <span>quality</span>,<br/>
🎧 much better than the <span>stuff</span> the <span>Asian</span> <span>bees</span> <span>produce</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, <span>Australia</span> <span>exports</span> <span>native</span> <span>Queen</span> <span>bees</span> to a large number of <span>countries</span> because of this.<br/>
🎧 When the <span>European</span> <span>Honey</span> Bee was first <span>discovered</span> out in the <span>bush</span>,<br/>
🎧 we <span>found</span> they made really <span>unpleasant</span> <span>honey<br/></span>
🎧 and they were also too big to <span>pollinate</span> many of our <span>native</span> <span>flowers</span> here in <span>Australia</span>.<br/>
🎧 That must have had a <span>devastating</span> <span>effect</span> on the <span>natural</span> <span>flora</span>.<br/>
🎧 Did you <span>lose</span> any <span>species</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, we <span>managed</span> to get them under <span>control</span> before that <span>happened<br/></span>
🎧 but if <span>Asian</span> <span>bees</span> got in there could be other <span>consequences</span>.<br/>
🎧 We could <span>lose</span> a lot of money because you might not be <span>aware</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it's <span>estimated</span> that <span>native</span> <span>bees'</span> <span>pollination</span> of <span>flower</span> and <span>vegetable</span> <span>crops</span> is <span>worth</span> <span>1.2</span> <span>billion</span> <span>dollars</span> a year.<br/>
🎧 So in a way they're the <span>farmer's</span> friend.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and another thing is, if you're <span>stung</span> by an <span>Asian</span> <span>Honey</span> Bee,<br/>
🎧 it can <span>produce</span> an <span>allergic</span> <span>reaction</span> in some <span>people;<br/></span>
🎧 so they're much more <span>dangerous</span> than <span>native</span> <span>bees</span>.<br/>
🎧 How will you know if <span>Asian</span> <span>bees</span> have <span>entered</span> <span>Australia</span>?<br/>
🎧 We're looking at the <span>diet</span> of the <span>bird</span> called the <span>Rainbow</span> Bee <span>Eater</span>.<br/>
🎧 The Bee <span>Eater</span> doesn't <span>care</span> what it <span>eats</span>, as long as they're <span>insects</span>.<br/>
🎧 But the <span>interesting</span> thing about this <span>bird</span> is that we are able to <span>analyse</span> exactly what it <span>eats<br/></span>
🎧 and that's really <span>helpful</span> if we're looking for <span>introduced</span> <span>insects</span>.<br/>
🎧 How come?<br/>
🎧 Because <span>insects</span> have their <span>skeletons</span> outside their <span>bodies</span>,<br/>
🎧 so the Bee <span>Eaters</span> <span>digest</span> the <span>meat</span> from the inside.<br/>
🎧 Then they <span>bring</span> up all the <span>indigestible</span> <span>bits</span> of <span>skeleton<br/></span>
🎧 and, of course, the <span>wings</span> in a <span>pellet</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 a small <span>ball</span> of <span>waste</span> <span>material</span> which they <span>cough</span> up.<br/>
🎧 That sounds a bit <span>unpleasant</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, how do you go about it?<br/>
🎧 In the <span>field</span>, we <span>track</span> down the Bee <span>Eaters</span> and find their <span>favourite</span> <span>feeding</span> <span>spots</span>,<br/>
🎧 you know, the <span>places</span> where the <span>birds</span> usually <span>feed</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's here that we can find the <span>pellets</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>collect</span> them up and take them back to the <span>laboratory</span> to <span>examine</span> the <span>contents</span>.<br/>
🎧 How do you do that?<br/>
🎧 The <span>pellets</span> are really <span>hard</span>, <span>especially</span> if they have been out in the sun for a few <span>days<br/></span>
🎧 so, first of all, we <span>treat</span> them by <span>adding</span> water to <span>moisten</span> them and make them <span>softer</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then we <span>pull</span> them <span>apart</span> under the <span>microscope</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Everything's</span> all <span>scrunched</span> up but we're looking for <span>wings</span> so we just <span>pull</span> them all out and <span>straighten</span> them.<br/>
🎧 Then we <span>identify</span> them to see if we can find any <span>Asian</span> bee <span>wings</span>.<br/>
🎧 And how many have you <span>found</span>?<br/>
🎧 So <span>far</span> our <span>research</span> <span>shows</span> that <span>Asian</span> <span>bees</span> have not <span>entered</span> <span>Australia</span> in any number <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it's a good <span>result</span> and much more <span>reliable</span> than trying to find live <span>ones</span> as <span>evidence</span> of <span>introduced</span> <span>insects</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's <span>fascinating</span>!<br/>
🎧 Thank you, <span>Grant</span>, for those <span>insights</span>.<br/>
🎧 I hope that you might <span>inspire</span> some of our students here to <span>conduct</span> some <span>similar</span> <span>experiments</span>.<br/>

🎧 I've been doing some <span>research</span> into what people in <span>Britain</span> think of <span>doctors</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>ones</span> who work in <span>general</span> practice <span>-</span> the first call for <span>medical</span> <span>care</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>comparing</span> this with the <span>situation</span> in a <span>couple</span> of other <span>countries</span>.<br/>
🎧 I want to talk about the <span>rationale</span> behind what I <span>decided</span> to do.<br/>
🎧 Now I had to set up my <span>programme</span> of <span>research</span> in <span>three</span> different <span>countries<br/></span>
🎧 so I <span>approached</span> <span>postgraduates</span> in my <span>field</span> in <span>overseas</span> <span>departments</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>contacting</span> them by <span>email</span>, to <span>organize</span> things for me at their end.<br/>
🎧 I thought I would have <span>trouble</span> <span>recruiting</span> <span>help<br/></span>
🎧 but in <span>fact</span> everyone was very <span>willing</span> and sometimes their <span>tutors</span> got <span>involved</span> too.<br/>
🎧 I had to give my <span>helpers</span> <span>clear</span> <span>instructions</span> about what kind of <span>sample</span> <span>population</span> I wanted them to use.<br/>
🎧 I <span>decided</span> that people under <span>18</span> should be <span>excluded<br/></span>
🎧 because most of them are students or looking for their first <span>job</span>,<br/>
🎧 and also I <span>decided</span> at this <span>stage</span>, just to focus on men who were in <span>employment</span>,<br/>
🎧 and set up something for people who didn't have <span>jobs<br/></span>
🎧 and for <span>employed</span> <span>women</span> later on as a <span>separate</span> <span>investigation</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>specifically</span> wanted to do a <span>questionnaire</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>interviews</span> with a focus group.<br/>
🎧 With the <span>questionnaire</span>, rather than <span>limiting</span> it to one <span>specific</span> <span>point</span>,<br/>
🎧 I wanted to <span>include</span> as much <span>variety</span> as <span>possible</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know <span>questionnaires</span> are a very <span>controlled</span> way to do <span>things<br/></span>
🎧 but I thought I could do <span>taped</span> <span>interviews</span> later on to <span>counteract</span> the <span>effects</span> of this.<br/>
🎧 And the focus group may also <span>prove</span> useful in future,<br/>
🎧 by <span>targeting</span> <span>subjects</span> I can <span>easily</span> <span>return</span> to,<br/>
🎧 as the <span>participants</span> <span>tend</span> to be more <span>involved</span>.<br/>
🎧 So I'm just <span>collating</span> the <span>results</span> now.<br/>
🎧 At the <span>moment</span>, it looks as if, in the <span>UK</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>despite</span> the <span>fact</span> that <span>newspapers</span> <span>continually</span> <span>report</span> that people are <span>unhappy</span> with <span>medical</span> <span>care</span>,<br/>
🎧 in <span>fact</span>, it is <span>mainly</span> the <span>third</span> <span>level</span> of <span>care</span>,<br/>
🎧 which takes place in <span>hospitals</span>, that they are <span>worried</span> about.<br/>
🎧 <span>Government</span> <span>reforms</span> have been <span>proposed</span> at all <span>levels<br/></span>
🎧 and although their success is not <span>guaranteed</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>long-term</span> <span>hospital</span> <span>care</span> is in <span>fact</span> probably less of an <span>issue<br/></span>
🎧 than the <span>media</span> would have us <span>believe</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, I've still got quite a bit of <span>data</span> to look at.<br/>
🎧 <span>Certainly</span> I will need to do more <span>far-reaching</span> <span>research</span> than I had <span>anticipated<br/></span>
🎧 in order to <span>establish</span> if people want <span>extra</span> <span>medical</span> <span>staff</span> <span>invested</span> in the <span>community</span>,<br/>
🎧 or if they want <span>care</span> to <span>revert</span> to <span>fewer</span>, but <span>larger</span>, key <span>medical</span> <span>units</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>solution</span> may well be something that can be <span>easily</span> <span>implemented<br/></span>
🎧 by those <span>responsible</span> in <span>local</span> <span>government</span>,<br/>
🎧 with <span>central</span> <span>government</span> <span>support</span>, of course.<br/>
🎧 This first <span>stage</span> has <span>proved</span> very <span>valuable</span> though.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>surprised</span> by how <span>willing</span> most of the <span>subjects</span> were to get <span>involved</span> in the <span>project</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 I had <span>expected</span> some <span>unwillingness</span> to answer <span>questions</span> <span>honestly</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I was taken <span>aback</span> and rather <span>concerned</span> that something I thought I'd set up very <span>well..</span>.<br/>
🎧 didn't <span>necessarily</span> <span>seem</span> that way to everyone in my own <span>department</span>.<br/>
🎧 I thought you might also be interested in some of the <span>problems</span> I <span>encountered</span> in <span>collecting</span> my <span>data</span>.<br/>
🎧 There were <span>odd</span> <span>cases</span> that <span>threw</span> me <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 one of the <span>subjects</span> who I had <span>approached</span> while he was out <span>shopping</span> in <span>town</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>decided</span> to <span>pull</span> out when it came to the second <span>round</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was a <span>shame</span> as it was <span>someone</span> who I would like to have <span>interviewed</span> more <span>closely</span>.<br/>
🎧 And one of the <span>first-year</span> students I <span>interviewed<br/></span>
🎧 wanted <span>reassurance</span> that no <span>names</span> would be <span>traceable</span> from the <span>answers</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was so <span>surprised</span>,<br/>
🎧 because they think <span>nothing</span> of <span>telling</span> you about <span>themselves</span> and their <span>opinions</span> in <span>seminar</span> <span>groups</span>!<br/>
🎧 Then, one of the people that I work with got a bit funny.<br/>
🎧 The <span>questions</span> were quite <span>personal<br/></span>
🎧 and one <span>minute</span> he said he'd do it,<br/>
🎧 then the next day he wouldn't,<br/>
🎧 and in the end he did do it.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>hard</span> not to get <span>angry</span> in that <span>situation<br/></span>
🎧 but I <span>tried</span> to keep <span>focused</span> on the <span>overall</span> <span>picture</span> in order to <span>stay</span> <span>calm</span>.<br/>
🎧 The most <span>bizarre</span> case was a <span>telephone</span> <span>interview</span> I did with a <span>teacher</span> at a university in <span>France</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>answered</span> all my <span>questions</span> in great <span>detail</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 but then when I <span>asked</span> how much <span>access</span> he had to <span>dangerous</span> <span>substances</span>,<br/>
🎧 he wouldn't tell me exactly what his work <span>involved</span>.<br/>
