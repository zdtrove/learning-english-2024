🎧 Good Morning. <span>Youth</span> <span>Council</span>. <span>Caroline</span> <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, hello, I'm interested in <span>standing</span> for <span>election</span> to the <span>Youth</span> <span>Council</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I was told to give you a call.<br/>
🎧 That's good.<br/>
🎧 Could I have your name, please?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's <span>Roger</span> <span>Brown</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>Caroline</span>, the <span>Youth</span> <span>Council</span> <span>administrator</span>.<br/>
🎧 So do you know much about what the <span>Council</span> does, <span>Roger</span>?<br/>
🎧 I've <span>talked</span> to <span>Stephanie</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 I think she's the <span>chair</span> of the <span>Council</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 And she told me a lot about it.<br/>
🎧 How it's a way for young people to <span>discuss</span> <span>local</span> issues, for example,<br/>
🎧 and make <span>suggestions</span> to the <span>town</span> <span>council</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's what made me interested.<br/>
🎧 Fine. Well let me take down some of your <span>details</span>.<br/>
🎧 First of all, how old are you?<br/>
🎧 You know the <span>Council</span> is for young people <span>aged</span> from <span>13</span> to <span>18</span>?<br/>
🎧 I've just <span>turned</span> <span>18</span>.<br/>
🎧 And where do you live, <span>Roger</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, that's a bit <span>complicated</span>.<br/>
🎧 At the <span>moment</span> I'm looking for a <span>flat</span> to <span>rent</span> here,<br/>
🎧 so I'm in a <span>hostel</span> from <span>Monday</span> to <span>Friday</span>.<br/>
🎧 I go back to my <span>parents'</span> place at the weekend.<br/>
🎧 OK, so where's the best place to <span>send</span> you some <span>information</span> about the <span>Council</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh, to my <span>parent's</span> <span>address</span>, please.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>17</span>, <span>Buckleigh</span> <span>Street</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>B-U-C-K-L-E-I-G-H</span> <span>Street</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>Stamford</span>, <span>Lincolnshire</span>,<br/>
🎧 though you don't really need the <span>county</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I know <span>Stamford</span> <span>-</span> it's a <span>lovely</span> <span>town</span>.<br/>
🎧 And what's the <span>postcode</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>PE9</span> <span>7QT</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, thank you.<br/>
🎧 So are you working here, or are you a student?<br/>
🎧 I <span>started</span> <span>studying</span> at the university a <span>couple</span> of <span>weeks</span> ago,<br/>
🎧 and I've got a <span>part-time</span> <span>job</span> for a few hours a week.<br/>
🎧 What do you do?<br/>
🎧 Well, I've done <span>several</span> different things.<br/>
🎧 I've just <span>finished</span> a <span>short-term</span> <span>contract</span> as a <span>courier</span>,<br/>
🎧 and now I'm working as a <span>waiter</span> in one of the big <span>hotels</span>.<br/>
🎧 That can't leave you much time for <span>studying</span>!<br/>
🎧 Oh, it's not too bad.<br/>
🎧 I <span>manage</span> to fit it all in.<br/>
🎧 What are you <span>studying</span>?<br/>
🎧 My <span>ambition</span> is to go into <span>parliament</span> <span>eventually</span>,<br/>
🎧 so my <span>major</span> <span>subject</span> is <span>politics</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>partly</span> why I think the <span>Youth</span> <span>Council</span> is important and want to be a <span>part</span> of it.<br/>
🎧 And I <span>suppose</span> you're also taking a <span>minor</span> <span>subject</span>, aren't you?<br/>
🎧 I know a lot of people <span>study</span> <span>economics</span> too.<br/>
🎧 I <span>chose</span> <span>history</span>.<br/>
🎧 To be <span>honest</span>, I'm not <span>finding</span> it as <span>interesting</span> as I <span>expected</span>!<br/>
🎧 OK, so with your <span>studying</span> and your <span>part-time</span> <span>job</span>,<br/>
🎧 do you have time for any other <span>interests</span> or <span>hobbies</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I <span>spend</span> quite a lot of time <span>cycling</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 both around <span>town</span> to get to university and to work,<br/>
🎧 and also <span>long-distance</span>, from here to <span>London</span>, for <span>instance</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>pretty</span> <span>impressive</span>!<br/>
🎧 Anything else?<br/>
🎧 For <span>relaxation</span> I'm also <span>keen</span> on the <span>cinema</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 I used to go at <span>least</span> once a week, but I can't <span>manage</span> to go so often now.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Are you sure you'll have enough time for the <span>Youth</span> <span>Council</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I've <span>worked</span> out that I can <span>afford</span> to <span>reduce</span> my hours at work, and that will make the time.<br/>
🎧 So is there any <span>particular</span> <span>aspect</span> of the <span>Youth</span> <span>Council's</span> work that <span>appeals</span> to you, <span>Roger</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, my <span>sister</span> is <span>blind</span>,<br/>
🎧 so I'm <span>particularly</span> interested in working with <span>disabled</span> young people,<br/>
🎧 to try and <span>improve</span> the <span>quality</span> of their lives.<br/>
🎧 That's great.<br/>
🎧 Well, the best way to get <span>involved</span> is to be <span>nominated</span> by some people who you know.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Can you tell me how to set about <span>organising</span> that?<br/>
🎧 You should talk to <span>Jeffrey</span>, our <span>Elections</span> <span>Officer</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can <span>arrange</span> a <span>meeting</span> in the <span>council</span> <span>office</span> with him, if you like.<br/>
🎧 Yes, please.<br/>
🎧 He'll be here next <span>Monday</span>, if that <span>suits</span> you.<br/>
🎧 That's the <span>14th</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 I can <span>manage</span> <span>late</span> <span>afternoon</span>.<br/>
🎧 Would you like to <span>suggest</span> a time?<br/>
🎧 He <span>generally</span> leaves around <span>5.30</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, would <span>4.30</span> be OK?<br/>
🎧 My last class <span>finishes</span> at <span>4</span>, so I'd have <span>plenty</span> of time to get to your <span>office</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, that's fine.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and could I have a phone number we can <span>contact</span> you on?<br/>
🎧 Yes, my <span>mobile</span> <span>number's</span> <span>07788136711</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Well, we'll look forward to <span>seeing</span> you next week.<br/>
🎧 Thanks very much.<br/>
🎧 <span>Goodbye</span>.<br/>
🎧 Bye.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Hi. Great to see you!<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>Jody</span>, and I'll be looking after both of you for the first month you're working here at the <span>Amersham</span> <span>Theatre</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll tell you something about the <span>theatre</span> now, then take you to meet two of the other <span>staff</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's an old <span>building</span>, and it's been <span>modernised</span> <span>several</span> <span>times</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, as you can see, we're <span>carrying</span> out a <span>major</span> <span>refurbishment</span> at the <span>moment</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>interior</span> has just been <span>repainted</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we're about to start on the <span>exterior</span> of the <span>building</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>that'll</span> be a big <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>work's</span> <span>running</span> over <span>budget</span>,<br/>
🎧 so we've had to <span>postpone</span> <span>installing</span> an <span>elevator</span>.<br/>
🎧 I hope you're happy <span>running</span> up and down <span>stairs</span>!<br/>
🎧 When the <span>theatre</span> was <span>built</span>,<br/>
🎧 people were <span>generally</span> <span>slimmer</span> and <span>shorter</span> than now,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>seats</span> were very <span>close</span> together.<br/>
🎧 We've <span>replaced</span> them with <span>larger</span> <span>seats</span>, with more <span>legroom</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>means</span> <span>fewer</span> <span>seats</span> in <span>total</span>,<br/>
🎧 but we've taken the <span>opportunity</span> to <span>install</span> <span>seats</span> that can <span>easily</span> be <span>moved</span>, to <span>create</span> different <span>acting</span> <span>spaces</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've also <span>turned</span> a few <span>storerooms</span> over to other <span>purposes</span> like <span>using</span> them for <span>meetings</span>.<br/>
🎧 We try <span>hard</span> to <span>involve</span> <span>members</span> of the <span>public</span> in the <span>theatre</span>.<br/>
🎧 One way is by <span>organising</span> <span>backstage</span> <span>tours<br/></span>
🎧 so people can be <span>shown</span> <span>round</span> the <span>building</span> and learn how a <span>theatre</span> <span>operates</span>.<br/>
🎧 These are <span>proving</span> very <span>popular</span>.<br/>
🎧 What we're <span>finding</span> is that people want to have lunch or a cup of <span>coffee</span> while they're here,<br/>
🎧 so we're looking into the <span>possibility</span> of <span>opening</span> a <span>café</span> in <span>due</span> course.<br/>
🎧 We have a <span>bookshop</span>, which <span>specialises</span> in books about <span>drama<br/></span>
🎧 and that <span>attracts</span> <span>plenty</span> of <span>customers</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then there are two large <span>rooms</span> that will be <span>decorated</span> next month,<br/>
🎧 and they'll be <span>available</span> for <span>hire</span>,<br/>
🎧 for <span>conferences</span> and <span>private</span> <span>functions</span>, such as <span>parties</span>.<br/>
🎧 We're also <span>considering</span> <span>hiring</span> out <span>costumes</span> to <span>amateur</span> <span>drama</span> <span>clubs</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now I want to tell you about our <span>workshops</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>recently</span> <span>started</span> a <span>programme</span> of <span>workshops</span> that <span>anyone</span> can join.<br/>
🎧 <span>Eventually</span> we <span>intend</span> to run <span>courses</span> in <span>acting</span>,<br/>
🎧 but we're <span>waiting</span> until we've got the right people in place as <span>trainers</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>proving</span> more <span>difficult</span> than we'd <span>expected</span>!<br/>
🎧 There's a big <span>demand</span> to learn about the <span>technical</span> side of <span>putting</span> on a <span>production</span>,<br/>
🎧 and our <span>lighting</span> <span>workshop</span> has already <span>started</span> with great success.<br/>
🎧 We're going to start one on sound next month.<br/>
🎧 A number of people have <span>enquired</span> about <span>workshops</span> on <span>make-up</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that's something we're <span>considering</span> for the future.<br/>
🎧 A <span>surprise</span> success is the <span>workshop</span> on <span>making</span> <span>puppets</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 we <span>happen</span> to have <span>someone</span> working here who does it as a hobby,<br/>
🎧 and she <span>offered</span> to run a <span>workshop</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was so <span>popular</span> we're now <span>running</span> them every month!<br/>
🎧 Now, a <span>word</span> about the <span>layout</span> of the <span>building</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>auditorium</span>, <span>stage</span> and <span>dressing</span> <span>rooms</span> for the <span>actors</span> are all <span>below</span> <span>ground</span> <span>level</span>.<br/>
🎧 Here on the <span>ground</span> <span>floor</span> we have most of the <span>rooms</span> that the <span>public</span> doesn't see.<br/>
🎧 The <span>majority</span> are <span>internal</span>, so they have <span>windows</span> in the <span>roof</span> to <span>light</span> them.<br/>
🎧 <span>Standing</span> here in the <span>foyer</span>, you're probably <span>wondering</span> why the box <span>office</span> isn't here,<br/>
🎧 where the <span>public</span> would <span>expect</span> to find it.<br/>
🎧 Well, you might have <span>noticed</span> it on your way in <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 although it's <span>part</span> of this <span>building</span>, it's next <span>door</span> with a <span>separate</span> <span>entrance</span> from the <span>road</span>.<br/>
🎧 For the <span>theatre</span> <span>manager's</span> <span>office</span>, you go across the <span>foyer</span> and through the <span>double</span> <span>doors</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>turn</span> right, and it's the room at the end of the <span>corridor</span>, with the <span>door</span> on the <span>left</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>lighting</span> box is where the <span>computerised</span> <span>stage</span> <span>lighting</span> is <span>operated<br/></span>
🎧 and it's at the back of the <span>building</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you're through the <span>double</span> <span>doors<br/></span>
🎧 <span>turn</span> <span>left</span>, <span>turn</span> right at the water <span>cooler</span>, and right again at the end.<br/>
🎧 It's the second room along that <span>corridor</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>lighting</span> box has a <span>window</span> into the <span>auditorium</span>,<br/>
🎧 which of course is <span>below</span> us.<br/>
🎧 The <span>artistic</span> <span>director's</span> <span>office</span> is through the <span>double</span> <span>doors</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>turn</span> right and it's the first room you come to on the <span>right-hand</span> side.<br/>
🎧 And finally, for the <span>moment</span>,<br/>
🎧 the room where I'll take you next <span>-</span> the <span>relaxation</span> room.<br/>
🎧 So if you'd <span>like..</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 I've <span>brought</span> my <span>notes</span> on our <span>Biology</span> <span>Field</span> <span>Trip</span> to <span>Rocky</span> <span>Bay</span>, <span>Colin</span>,<br/>
🎧 so we can work on our <span>report</span> on the <span>research</span> we did together.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 I've got <span>mine</span> too. Let's look at the <span>aims</span> of the <span>trip</span> first.<br/>
🎧 Right. What did you have?<br/>
🎧 I just put something about getting <span>experience</span> of the different <span>sorts</span> of <span>procedures</span> used on a <span>field</span> <span>trip</span>.<br/>
🎧 But we need something about what <span>causes</span> different <span>organisms</span> to choose <span>particular</span> <span>habitats</span>.<br/>
🎧 I agree.<br/>
🎧 And something about <span>finding</span> out how to <span>protect</span> <span>organisms</span> in <span>danger</span> of <span>dying</span> out?<br/>
🎧 In our <span>aims</span>?<br/>
🎧 But we weren't really looking at that.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> not.<br/>
🎧 OK, now there's the <span>list</span> of <span>equipment</span> we all had to <span>bring</span> on the <span>field</span> <span>trip</span>.<br/>
🎧 What did they tell us to <span>bring</span> a <span>ruler</span> for?<br/>
🎧 It was something about <span>measuring</span> the <span>slope</span> of the <span>shore</span>,<br/>
🎧 but of course we didn't need it because we were <span>measuring</span> <span>wind</span> <span>direction</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we'd <span>brought</span> the <span>compass</span> for <span>that…<br/></span>
🎧 But not the <span>piece</span> of <span>string</span> to <span>hold</span> up in the air!<br/>
🎧 Didn't Mr <span>Blake</span> make a <span>fuss</span> about us <span>leaving</span> that behind.<br/>
🎧 He does go on.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span> it was easy to get one from another of the students.<br/>
🎧 Now, the next <span>section's</span> the <span>procedure</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>sent</span> you the <span>draft</span> of that.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. <span>And.</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>clear</span>, but I don't think we need all these <span>details</span> of what time we <span>left</span> and what time we got back <span>and..</span>.<br/>
🎧 how we <span>divided</span> up the different <span>research</span> <span>tasks</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK. I'll look at that again.<br/>
🎧 Then we have to <span>describe</span> our <span>method</span> of <span>investigation</span> in <span>detail</span>.<br/>
🎧 So let's <span>begin</span> with how we <span>measured</span> <span>wave</span> <span>speed</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>surprised</span> how <span>straightforward</span> that was.<br/>
🎧 I'd <span>expected</span> us to have some <span>sort</span> of <span>high-tech</span> <span>device</span>,<br/>
🎧 not just <span>stand</span> there and <span>count</span> the number of <span>waves</span> <span>per</span> <span>minute</span>.<br/>
🎧 Not very <span>precise</span>, but I <span>suppose</span> it was good enough.<br/>
🎧 But the way we <span>measured</span> the amount of <span>salt</span> was <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the water from the <span>rock</span> <span>pools</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I wanted to check the <span>chemicals</span> we used in the <span>lab</span> when we <span>analysed</span> those <span>samples</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 was it <span>potassium</span> <span>chromate</span> and <span>silver</span> <span>nitrate</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And we need the map of the <span>seashore</span>.<br/>
🎧 You just <span>left</span> that to me.<br/>
🎧 And I had to do it while the <span>tide</span> was low,<br/>
🎧 well, that was OK, but the place I <span>started</span> it from was down on the <span>beach</span>,<br/>
🎧 then I <span>realised</span> I should have <span>gone</span> up <span>higher</span> to get better <span>visibility</span>,<br/>
🎧 so I had to start all over again.<br/>
🎧 But at <span>least</span> I'd got the <span>squared</span> <span>paper</span> or I'd have had <span>problems</span> <span>drawing</span> it all to <span>scale</span>.<br/>
🎧 It looks good.<br/>
🎧 We could get a map of the <span>region</span> off the <span>internet</span> and see if we need to make any changes.<br/>
🎧 I had a look but I couldn't find anything.<br/>
🎧 But you took some <span>pictures</span>, didn't you?<br/>
🎧 Yeah. I'll <span>email</span> you them if you want.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 I'll make my <span>amendments</span> <span>using</span> those, then I can <span>scan</span> it into our <span>report</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 Now when we get to our <span>findings</span> I thought we could <span>divide</span> them up into the different <span>zones</span> we <span>identified</span> on the <span>shore<br/></span>
🎧 and the <span>problems</span> <span>organisms</span> <span>face</span> in each <span>zone</span>.<br/>
🎧 So for the <span>highest</span> <span>area…</span> <span>…the</span> <span>splash</span> <span>zone</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, we <span>found</span> <span>mostly</span> those <span>tiny</span> <span>shellfish</span> that have <span>strong</span> <span>hard</span> <span>shells</span> that act as <span>protection</span>.<br/>
🎧 But not from other <span>organisms</span> that might eat them, <span>predators</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, that's not the <span>main</span> <span>danger</span> for them.<br/>
🎧 But the <span>shells</span> <span>prevent</span> them from <span>drying</span> <span>out<br/></span>
🎧 because they're in the open air for most of the time.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And since they're <span>exposed</span>, they need to be able to find some <span>sort</span> of <span>shelter</span>, or <span>cover</span> <span>themselves</span> up, so they don't get too hot.<br/>
🎧 Then in the <span>middle</span> and <span>lower</span> <span>zones</span>, <span>nearer</span> the sea,<br/>
🎧 we need to <span>discuss</span> the <span>effects</span> of <span>wave</span> <span>action…<br/></span>
🎧 Yes, and how <span>organisms</span> <span>develop</span> <span>structures</span> to <span>prevent</span> <span>themselves</span> from being <span>swept</span> away,<br/>
🎧 or even <span>destroyed</span> by being <span>smashed</span> <span>against</span> the <span>rocks</span>.<br/>
🎧 I haven't done anything on the <span>geological</span> changes.<br/>
🎧 I don't know what to put for that.<br/>
🎧 No, we weren't <span>concentrating</span> on that.<br/>
🎧 Maybe we need to find some <span>websites</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good idea.<br/>
🎧 I've got the <span>lecture</span> <span>notes</span> from Mr <span>Blake's</span> <span>geology</span> course,<br/>
🎧 but they're too <span>general</span>.<br/>
🎧 But we could ask him which books on our <span>Reading</span> <span>List</span> might be most <span>helpful</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 OK, now I did a <span>draft</span> of the <span>section</span> of <span>sources</span> of <span>possible</span> <span>error</span> in our <span>research</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I don't know if you agree.<br/>
🎧 For example, the size of the <span>sample</span>, and <span>whether</span> it's big enough to make any <span>general</span> <span>conclusions</span> from.<br/>
🎧 But I thought actually we did have quite a big <span>sample</span>.<br/>
🎧 We did.<br/>
🎧 And our <span>general</span> <span>method</span> of <span>observation</span> <span>seemed</span> quite <span>reliable</span>.<br/>
🎧 But we might not be all that <span>accurate</span> as <span>far</span> as the <span>actual</span> <span>numbers</span> go.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, we might have <span>missed</span> some <span>organisms</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 if they were <span>hiding</span> under a <span>rock</span>, for example.<br/>
🎧 I wasn't sure about the way we <span>described</span> their <span>habitats</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>decided</span> it was probably OK.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, and the <span>descriptions</span> we gave of the <span>smaller</span> <span>organisms</span>,<br/>
🎧 they weren't very <span>detailed</span>, but they were <span>adequate</span> in this <span>context</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm not sure we <span>identified</span> all the <span>species</span> <span>correctly</span> though.<br/>
🎧 OK, we'd better <span>mention</span> that.<br/>

🎧 We've been <span>discussing</span> the <span>factors</span> the <span>architect</span> has to <span>consider</span> when <span>designing</span> <span>domestic</span> <span>buildings</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm going to move on now to <span>consider</span> the <span>design</span> of <span>public</span> <span>buildings</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I'll <span>illustrate</span> this by <span>referring</span> to the new <span>Taylor</span> <span>Concert</span> <span>Hall</span> that's <span>recently</span> been <span>completed</span> here in the <span>city</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, as with a <span>domestic</span> <span>building</span>,<br/>
🎧 when <span>designing</span> a <span>public</span> <span>building</span>, an <span>architect</span> needs to <span>consider</span> the <span>function</span> of the <span>building</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 for example, is it to be used <span>primarily</span> for <span>entertainment</span>, or for <span>education</span>, or for <span>administration</span>?<br/>
🎧 The second thing the <span>architect</span> needs to think about is the <span>context</span> of the <span>building</span>,<br/>
🎧 this <span>includes</span> its <span>physical</span> <span>location</span> <span>obviously</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it also <span>includes</span> the <span>social</span> <span>meaning</span> of the <span>building:<br/></span>
🎧 how it <span>relates</span> to the people it's <span>built</span> for.<br/>
🎧 And finally, for important <span>public</span> <span>buildings</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>architect</span> may also be looking for a <span>central</span> <span>symbolic</span> idea on which to <span>base</span> the <span>design</span>,<br/>
🎧 a <span>sort</span> of <span>metaphor</span> for the <span>building</span> and the way in which it is used.<br/>
🎧 Let's look at the new <span>Taylor</span> <span>Concert</span> <span>Hall</span> in <span>relation</span> to these <span>ideas</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>location</span> <span>chosen</span> was a <span>site</span> in a <span>run-down</span> <span>district</span> that has been <span>ignored</span> in <span>previous</span> <span>redevelopment</span> <span>plans</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>occupied</span> by a <span>factory</span> that had been empty for some years.<br/>
🎧 The whole <span>area</span> was some <span>distance</span> from the <span>high-rise</span> <span>office</span> <span>blocks</span> of the <span>central</span> <span>business</span> <span>district</span> and <span>shopping</span> <span>centre</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it was only one <span>kilometre</span> from the <span>ring</span> <span>road</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>site</span> <span>itself</span> was <span>bordered</span> to the <span>north</span> by a <span>canal<br/></span>
🎧 which had once been used by <span>boats</span> <span>bringing</span> in raw <span>materials</span> when the <span>area</span> was used for <span>manufacturing</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>architect</span> <span>chosen</span> for the <span>project</span> was <span>Tom</span> <span>Harrison</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>found</span> the <span>main</span> <span>design</span> <span>challenge</span> was the <span>location</span> of the <span>site</span> in an <span>area</span> that had no <span>neighbouring</span> <span>buildings</span> of any <span>importance</span>.<br/>
🎧 To <span>reflect</span> the <span>fact</span> that the <span>significance</span> of the <span>building</span> in this quite <span>run-down</span> <span>location</span> was as yet <span>unknown</span>,<br/>
🎧 he <span>decided</span> to <span>create</span> a <span>building</span> <span>centred</span> around the idea of a <span>mystery</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 something whose <span>meaning</span> still has to be <span>discovered</span>.<br/>
🎧 So how was this <span>reflected</span> in the <span>design</span> of the <span>building</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>Harrison</span> <span>decided</span> to <span>create</span> <span>pedestrian</span> <span>access</span> to the <span>building<br/></span>
🎧 and to make use of the <span>presence</span> of water on the <span>site</span>.<br/>
🎧 As people <span>approach</span> the <span>entrance</span>, they <span>therefore</span> have to <span>cross</span> over a <span>bridge</span>.<br/>
🎧 He wanted to give people a feeling of <span>suspense<br/></span>
🎧 as they see the <span>building</span> first from a <span>distance</span>, and then <span>close-up</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>initial</span> <span>impression</span> he wanted to <span>create</span> from the <span>shape</span> of the <span>building</span> as a whole was that of a box.<br/>
🎧 The first side that people see, the <span>southern</span> <span>wall</span>, is just a high, <span>flat</span> <span>wall</span> <span>uninterrupted</span> by any <span>windows</span>.<br/>
🎧 This might sound <span>off-putting</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it <span>supports</span> <span>Harrison's</span> <span>concept</span> of the <span>building</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 that the person <span>approaching</span> is <span>intrigued</span> and <span>wonders</span> what will be inside.<br/>
🎧 And this <span>flat</span> <span>wall</span> also has another <span>purpose</span>.<br/>
🎧 At <span>night-time</span>, <span>projectors</span> are <span>switched</span> on and it <span>functions</span> as a <span>huge</span> <span>screen</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>onto</span> which <span>images</span> are <span>projected</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>auditorium</span> <span>itself</span> <span>seats</span> <span>1500</span> people.<br/>
🎧 The <span>floor's</span> <span>supported</span> by ten <span>massive</span> <span>pads</span>.<br/>
🎧 These are <span>constructed</span> from <span>rubber</span>,<br/>
🎧 and so are able to <span>absorb</span> any <span>vibrations</span> from <span>outside<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>prevent</span> them from <span>affecting</span> the <span>auditorium</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>walls</span> are made of <span>several</span> <span>layers</span> of <span>honey-coloured</span> <span>wood</span>,<br/>
🎧 all <span>sourced</span> from <span>local</span> <span>beech</span> <span>trees</span>.<br/>
🎧 In order to <span>improve</span> the <span>acoustic</span> <span>properties</span> of the <span>auditorium</span> and to <span>amplify</span> the sound,<br/>
🎧 they are not <span>straight</span>, they are <span>curved</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>acoustics</span> are also <span>adjustable</span> <span>according</span> to the size of <span>orchestra</span> and the <span>type</span> of music being <span>played</span>.<br/>
🎧 In order to <span>achieve</span> this, there are <span>nine</span> <span>movable</span> <span>panels</span> in the <span>ceiling</span> <span>above</span> the <span>orchestra<br/></span>
🎧 which are all <span>individually</span> <span>motorized</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>walls</span> also have <span>curtains</span> which can be <span>opened</span> or <span>closed</span> to change the <span>acoustics</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>reaction</span> of the <span>public</span> to the new <span>building</span> has <span>generally</span> been <span>positive</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, the <span>evaluation</span> of some <span>critics</span> has been less <span>enthusiastic</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>spite</span> of <span>Harrison's</span> <span>efforts</span> to use <span>local</span> <span>materials</span>,<br/>
🎧 they <span>criticise</span> the <span>style</span> of the <span>design</span> as being <span>international</span> rather than <span>local</span>,<br/>
🎧 and say it doesn't <span>reflect</span> <span>features</span> of the <span>landscape</span> or <span>society</span> for which it is <span>built</span>.<br/>
