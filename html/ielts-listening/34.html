🎧 Good Morning. Youth Council. Caroline speaking.<br/>
🎧 Oh, hello, I'm interested in standing for election to the Youth Council,<br/>
🎧 and I was told to give you a call.<br/>
🎧 That's good.<br/>
🎧 Could I have your name, please?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's Roger Brown.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 I'm Caroline, the Youth Council administrator.<br/>
🎧 So do you know much about what the Council does, Roger?<br/>
🎧 I've talked to Stephanie -<br/>
🎧 I think she's the chair of the Council.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 And she told me a lot about it.<br/>
🎧 How it's a way for young people to discuss local issues, for example,<br/>
🎧 and make suggestions to the town council.<br/>
🎧 That's what made me interested.<br/>
🎧 Fine. Well let me take down some of your details.<br/>
🎧 First of all, how old are you?<br/>
🎧 You know the Council is for young people aged from 13 to 18?<br/>
🎧 I've just turned 18.<br/>
🎧 And where do you live, Roger?<br/>
🎧 Well, that's a bit complicated.<br/>
🎧 At the moment I'm looking for a flat to rent here,<br/>
🎧 so I'm in a hostel from Monday to Friday.<br/>
🎧 I go back to my parents' place at the weekend.<br/>
🎧 OK, so where's the best place to send you some information about the Council?<br/>
🎧 Oh, to my parent's address, please.<br/>
🎧 That's 17, Buckleigh Street -<br/>
🎧 B-U-C-K-L-E-I-G-H Street,<br/>
🎧 Stamford, Lincolnshire,<br/>
🎧 though you don't really need the county.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I know Stamford - it's a lovely town.<br/>
🎧 And what's the postcode?<br/>
🎧 PE9 7QT.<br/>
🎧 Right, thank you.<br/>
🎧 So are you working here, or are you a student?<br/>
🎧 I started studying at the university a couple of weeks ago,<br/>
🎧 and I've got a part-time job for a few hours a week.<br/>
🎧 What do you do?<br/>
🎧 Well, I've done several different things.<br/>
🎧 I've just finished a short-term contract as a courier,<br/>
🎧 and now I'm working as a waiter in one of the big hotels.<br/>
🎧 That can't leave you much time for studying!<br/>
🎧 Oh, it's not too bad.<br/>
🎧 I manage to fit it all in.<br/>
🎧 What are you studying?<br/>
🎧 My ambition is to go into parliament eventually,<br/>
🎧 so my major subject is politics.<br/>
🎧 That's partly why I think the Youth Council is important and want to be a part of it.<br/>
🎧 And I suppose you're also taking a minor subject, aren't you?<br/>
🎧 I know a lot of people study economics too.<br/>
🎧 I chose history.<br/>
🎧 To be honest, I'm not finding it as interesting as I expected!<br/>
🎧 OK, so with your studying and your part-time job,<br/>
🎧 do you have time for any other interests or hobbies?<br/>
🎧 Well, I spend quite a lot of time cycling -<br/>
🎧 both around town to get to university and to work,<br/>
🎧 and also long-distance, from here to London, for instance.<br/>
🎧 That's pretty impressive!<br/>
🎧 Anything else?<br/>
🎧 For relaxation I'm also keen on the cinema -<br/>
🎧 I used to go at least once a week, but I can't manage to go so often now.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Are you sure you'll have enough time for the Youth Council?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I've worked out that I can afford to reduce my hours at work, and that will make the time.<br/>
🎧 So is there any particular aspect of the Youth Council's work that appeals to you, Roger?<br/>
🎧 Well, my sister is blind,<br/>
🎧 so I'm particularly interested in working with disabled young people,<br/>
🎧 to try and improve the quality of their lives.<br/>
🎧 That's great.<br/>
🎧 Well, the best way to get involved is to be nominated by some people who you know.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Can you tell me how to set about organising that?<br/>
🎧 You should talk to Jeffrey, our Elections Officer.<br/>
🎧 I can arrange a meeting in the council office with him, if you like.<br/>
🎧 Yes, please.<br/>
🎧 He'll be here next Monday, if that suits you.<br/>
🎧 That's the 14th, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 I can manage late afternoon.<br/>
🎧 Would you like to suggest a time?<br/>
🎧 He generally leaves around 5.30.<br/>
🎧 Well, would 4.30 be OK?<br/>
🎧 My last class finishes at 4, so I'd have plenty of time to get to your office.<br/>
🎧 Right, that's fine.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and could I have a phone number we can contact you on?<br/>
🎧 Yes, my mobile number's 07788136711.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Well, we'll look forward to seeing you next week.<br/>
🎧 Thanks very much.<br/>
🎧 Goodbye.<br/>
🎧 Bye.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Hi. Great to see you!<br/>
🎧 I'm Jody, and I'll be looking after both of you for the first month you're working here at the Amersham Theatre.<br/>
🎧 I'll tell you something about the theatre now, then take you to meet two of the other staff.<br/>
🎧 It's an old building, and it's been modernised several times.<br/>
🎧 In fact, as you can see, we're carrying out a major refurbishment at the moment.<br/>
🎧 The interior has just been repainted,<br/>
🎧 and we're about to start on the exterior of the building -<br/>
🎧 that'll be a big job.<br/>
🎧 The work's running over budget,<br/>
🎧 so we've had to postpone installing an elevator.<br/>
🎧 I hope you're happy running up and down stairs!<br/>
🎧 When the theatre was built,<br/>
🎧 people were generally slimmer and shorter than now,<br/>
🎧 and the seats were very close together.<br/>
🎧 We've replaced them with larger seats, with more legroom.<br/>
🎧 This means fewer seats in total,<br/>
🎧 but we've taken the opportunity to install seats that can easily be moved, to create different acting spaces.<br/>
🎧 We've also turned a few storerooms over to other purposes like using them for meetings.<br/>
🎧 We try hard to involve members of the public in the theatre.<br/>
🎧 One way is by organising backstage tours<br/>
🎧 so people can be shown round the building and learn how a theatre operates.<br/>
🎧 These are proving very popular.<br/>
🎧 What we're finding is that people want to have lunch or a cup of coffee while they're here,<br/>
🎧 so we're looking into the possibility of opening a café in due course.<br/>
🎧 We have a bookshop, which specialises in books about drama<br/>
🎧 and that attracts plenty of customers.<br/>
🎧 Then there are two large rooms that will be decorated next month,<br/>
🎧 and they'll be available for hire,<br/>
🎧 for conferences and private functions, such as parties.<br/>
🎧 We're also considering hiring out costumes to amateur drama clubs.<br/>
🎧 Now I want to tell you about our workshops.<br/>
🎧 We recently started a programme of workshops that anyone can join.<br/>
🎧 Eventually we intend to run courses in acting,<br/>
🎧 but we're waiting until we've got the right people in place as trainers.<br/>
🎧 That's proving more difficult than we'd expected!<br/>
🎧 There's a big demand to learn about the technical side of putting on a production,<br/>
🎧 and our lighting workshop has already started with great success.<br/>
🎧 We're going to start one on sound next month.<br/>
🎧 A number of people have enquired about workshops on make-up,<br/>
🎧 and that's something we're considering for the future.<br/>
🎧 A surprise success is the workshop on making puppets -<br/>
🎧 we happen to have someone working here who does it as a hobby,<br/>
🎧 and she offered to run a workshop.<br/>
🎧 It was so popular we're now running them every month!<br/>
🎧 Now, a word about the layout of the building.<br/>
🎧 The auditorium, stage and dressing rooms for the actors are all below ground level.<br/>
🎧 Here on the ground floor we have most of the rooms that the public doesn't see.<br/>
🎧 The majority are internal, so they have windows in the roof to light them.<br/>
🎧 Standing here in the foyer, you're probably wondering why the box office isn't here,<br/>
🎧 where the public would expect to find it.<br/>
🎧 Well, you might have noticed it on your way in -<br/>
🎧 although it's part of this building, it's next door with a separate entrance from the road.<br/>
🎧 For the theatre manager's office, you go across the foyer and through the double doors,<br/>
🎧 turn right, and it's the room at the end of the corridor, with the door on the left.<br/>
🎧 The lighting box is where the computerised stage lighting is operated<br/>
🎧 and it's at the back of the building.<br/>
🎧 When you're through the double doors<br/>
🎧 turn left, turn right at the water cooler, and right again at the end.<br/>
🎧 It's the second room along that corridor.<br/>
🎧 The lighting box has a window into the auditorium,<br/>
🎧 which of course is below us.<br/>
🎧 The artistic director's office is through the double doors,<br/>
🎧 turn right and it's the first room you come to on the right-hand side.<br/>
🎧 And finally, for the moment,<br/>
🎧 the room where I'll take you next - the relaxation room.<br/>
🎧 So if you'd like...<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 I've brought my notes on our Biology Field Trip to Rocky Bay, Colin,<br/>
🎧 so we can work on our report on the research we did together.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 I've got mine too. Let's look at the aims of the trip first.<br/>
🎧 Right. What did you have?<br/>
🎧 I just put something about getting experience of the different sorts of procedures used on a field trip.<br/>
🎧 But we need something about what causes different organisms to choose particular habitats.<br/>
🎧 I agree.<br/>
🎧 And something about finding out how to protect organisms in danger of dying out?<br/>
🎧 In our aims?<br/>
🎧 But we weren't really looking at that.<br/>
🎧 I suppose not.<br/>
🎧 OK, now there's the list of equipment we all had to bring on the field trip.<br/>
🎧 What did they tell us to bring a ruler for?<br/>
🎧 It was something about measuring the slope of the shore,<br/>
🎧 but of course we didn't need it because we were measuring wind direction,<br/>
🎧 and we'd brought the compass for that…<br/>
🎧 But not the piece of string to hold up in the air!<br/>
🎧 Didn't Mr Blake make a fuss about us leaving that behind.<br/>
🎧 He does go on.<br/>
🎧 Anyway it was easy to get one from another of the students.<br/>
🎧 Now, the next section's the procedure.<br/>
🎧 I sent you the draft of that.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. And..<br/>
🎧 It was clear, but I don't think we need all these details of what time we left and what time we got back and...<br/>
🎧 how we divided up the different research tasks.<br/>
🎧 OK. I'll look at that again.<br/>
🎧 Then we have to describe our method of investigation in detail.<br/>
🎧 So let's begin with how we measured wave speed.<br/>
🎧 I was surprised how straightforward that was.<br/>
🎧 I'd expected us to have some sort of high-tech device,<br/>
🎧 not just stand there and count the number of waves per minute.<br/>
🎧 Not very precise, but I suppose it was good enough.<br/>
🎧 But the way we measured the amount of salt was interesting.<br/>
🎧 In the water from the rock pools?<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I wanted to check the chemicals we used in the lab when we analysed those samples -<br/>
🎧 was it potassium chromate and silver nitrate?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And we need the map of the seashore.<br/>
🎧 You just left that to me.<br/>
🎧 And I had to do it while the tide was low,<br/>
🎧 well, that was OK, but the place I started it from was down on the beach,<br/>
🎧 then I realised I should have gone up higher to get better visibility,<br/>
🎧 so I had to start all over again.<br/>
🎧 But at least I'd got the squared paper or I'd have had problems drawing it all to scale.<br/>
🎧 It looks good.<br/>
🎧 We could get a map of the region off the internet and see if we need to make any changes.<br/>
🎧 I had a look but I couldn't find anything.<br/>
🎧 But you took some pictures, didn't you?<br/>
🎧 Yeah. I'll email you them if you want.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 I'll make my amendments using those, then I can scan it into our report.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 Now when we get to our findings I thought we could divide them up into the different zones we identified on the shore<br/>
🎧 and the problems organisms face in each zone.<br/>
🎧 So for the highest area… …the splash zone?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, we found mostly those tiny shellfish that have strong hard shells that act as protection.<br/>
🎧 But not from other organisms that might eat them, predators?<br/>
🎧 No, that's not the main danger for them.<br/>
🎧 But the shells prevent them from drying out<br/>
🎧 because they're in the open air for most of the time.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And since they're exposed, they need to be able to find some sort of shelter, or cover themselves up, so they don't get too hot.<br/>
🎧 Then in the middle and lower zones, nearer the sea,<br/>
🎧 we need to discuss the effects of wave action…<br/>
🎧 Yes, and how organisms develop structures to prevent themselves from being swept away,<br/>
🎧 or even destroyed by being smashed against the rocks.<br/>
🎧 I haven't done anything on the geological changes.<br/>
🎧 I don't know what to put for that.<br/>
🎧 No, we weren't concentrating on that.<br/>
🎧 Maybe we need to find some websites.<br/>
🎧 Good idea.<br/>
🎧 I've got the lecture notes from Mr Blake's geology course,<br/>
🎧 but they're too general.<br/>
🎧 But we could ask him which books on our Reading List might be most helpful.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 OK, now I did a draft of the section of sources of possible error in our research,<br/>
🎧 but I don't know if you agree.<br/>
🎧 For example, the size of the sample, and whether it's big enough to make any general conclusions from.<br/>
🎧 But I thought actually we did have quite a big sample.<br/>
🎧 We did.<br/>
🎧 And our general method of observation seemed quite reliable.<br/>
🎧 But we might not be all that accurate as far as the actual numbers go.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, we might have missed some organisms -<br/>
🎧 if they were hiding under a rock, for example.<br/>
🎧 I wasn't sure about the way we described their habitats.<br/>
🎧 I decided it was probably OK.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, and the descriptions we gave of the smaller organisms,<br/>
🎧 they weren't very detailed, but they were adequate in this context.<br/>
🎧 I'm not sure we identified all the species correctly though.<br/>
🎧 OK, we'd better mention that.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 We've been discussing the factors the architect has to consider when designing domestic buildings.<br/>
🎧 I'm going to move on now to consider the design of public buildings,<br/>
🎧 and I'll illustrate this by referring to the new Taylor Concert Hall that's recently been completed here in the city.<br/>
🎧 So, as with a domestic building,<br/>
🎧 when designing a public building, an architect needs to consider the function of the building -<br/>
🎧 for example, is it to be used primarily for entertainment, or for education, or for administration?<br/>
🎧 The second thing the architect needs to think about is the context of the building,<br/>
🎧 this includes its physical location obviously,<br/>
🎧 but it also includes the social meaning of the building:<br/>
🎧 how it relates to the people it's built for.<br/>
🎧 And finally, for important public buildings,<br/>
🎧 the architect may also be looking for a central symbolic idea on which to base the design,<br/>
🎧 a sort of metaphor for the building and the way in which it is used.<br/>
🎧 Let's look at the new Taylor Concert Hall in relation to these ideas.<br/>
🎧 The location chosen was a site in a run-down district that has been ignored in previous redevelopment plans.<br/>
🎧 It was occupied by a factory that had been empty for some years.<br/>
🎧 The whole area was some distance from the high-rise office blocks of the central business district and shopping centre,<br/>
🎧 but it was only one kilometre from the ring road.<br/>
🎧 The site itself was bordered to the north by a canal<br/>
🎧 which had once been used by boats bringing in raw materials when the area was used for manufacturing.<br/>
🎧 The architect chosen for the project was Tom Harrison.<br/>
🎧 He found the main design challenge was the location of the site in an area that had no neighbouring buildings of any importance.<br/>
🎧 To reflect the fact that the significance of the building in this quite run-down location was as yet unknown,<br/>
🎧 he decided to create a building centred around the idea of a mystery -<br/>
🎧 something whose meaning still has to be discovered.<br/>
🎧 So how was this reflected in the design of the building?<br/>
🎧 Well, Harrison decided to create pedestrian access to the building<br/>
🎧 and to make use of the presence of water on the site.<br/>
🎧 As people approach the entrance, they therefore have to cross over a bridge.<br/>
🎧 He wanted to give people a feeling of suspense<br/>
🎧 as they see the building first from a distance, and then close-up,<br/>
🎧 and the initial impression he wanted to create from the shape of the building as a whole was that of a box.<br/>
🎧 The first side that people see, the southern wall, is just a high, flat wall uninterrupted by any windows.<br/>
🎧 This might sound off-putting,<br/>
🎧 but it supports Harrison's concept of the building -<br/>
🎧 that the person approaching is intrigued and wonders what will be inside.<br/>
🎧 And this flat wall also has another purpose.<br/>
🎧 At night-time, projectors are switched on and it functions as a huge screen,<br/>
🎧 onto which images are projected.<br/>
🎧 The auditorium itself seats 1500 people.<br/>
🎧 The floor's supported by ten massive pads.<br/>
🎧 These are constructed from rubber,<br/>
🎧 and so are able to absorb any vibrations from outside<br/>
🎧 and prevent them from affecting the auditorium.<br/>
🎧 The walls are made of several layers of honey-coloured wood,<br/>
🎧 all sourced from local beech trees.<br/>
🎧 In order to improve the acoustic properties of the auditorium and to amplify the sound,<br/>
🎧 they are not straight, they are curved.<br/>
🎧 The acoustics are also adjustable according to the size of orchestra and the type of music being played.<br/>
🎧 In order to achieve this, there are nine movable panels in the ceiling above the orchestra<br/>
🎧 which are all individually motorized,<br/>
🎧 and the walls also have curtains which can be opened or closed to change the acoustics.<br/>
🎧 The reaction of the public to the new building has generally been positive.<br/>
🎧 However, the evaluation of some critics has been less enthusiastic.<br/>
🎧 In spite of Harrison's efforts to use local materials,<br/>
🎧 they criticise the style of the design as being international rather than local,<br/>
🎧 and say it doesn't reflect features of the landscape or society for which it is built.<br/>
<br/><br/>
