🎧 Good Morning. <span>Youth <span>Council. <span>Caroline <span>speaking.<br/>
🎧 Oh, hello, I'm interested in <span>standing for <span>election to the <span>Youth <span>Council,<br/>
🎧 and I was told to give you a call.<br/>
🎧 That's good.<br/>
🎧 Could I have your name, please?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's <span>Roger <span>Brown.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>Caroline, the <span>Youth <span>Council <span>administrator.<br/>
🎧 So do you know much about what the <span>Council does, <span>Roger?<br/>
🎧 I've <span>talked to <span>Stephanie <span>-<br/>
🎧 I think she's the <span>chair of the <span>Council.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 And she told me a lot about it.<br/>
🎧 How it's a way for young people to <span>discuss <span>local issues, for example,<br/>
🎧 and make <span>suggestions to the <span>town <span>council.<br/>
🎧 That's what made me interested.<br/>
🎧 Fine. Well let me take down some of your <span>details.<br/>
🎧 First of all, how old are you?<br/>
🎧 You know the <span>Council is for young people <span>aged from <span>13 to <span>18?<br/>
🎧 I've just <span>turned <span>18.<br/>
🎧 And where do you live, <span>Roger?<br/>
🎧 Well, that's a bit <span>complicated.<br/>
🎧 At the <span>moment I'm looking for a <span>flat to <span>rent here,<br/>
🎧 so I'm in a <span>hostel from <span>Monday to <span>Friday.<br/>
🎧 I go back to my <span>parents' place at the weekend.<br/>
🎧 OK, so where's the best place to <span>send you some <span>information about the <span>Council?<br/>
🎧 Oh, to my <span>parent's <span>address, please.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>17, <span>Buckleigh <span>Street <span>-<br/>
🎧 <span>B-U-C-K-L-E-I-G-H <span>Street,<br/>
🎧 <span>Stamford, <span>Lincolnshire,<br/>
🎧 though you don't really need the <span>county.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I know <span>Stamford <span>- it's a <span>lovely <span>town.<br/>
🎧 And what's the <span>postcode?<br/>
🎧 <span>PE9 <span>7QT.<br/>
🎧 Right, thank you.<br/>
🎧 So are you working here, or are you a student?<br/>
🎧 I <span>started <span>studying at the university a <span>couple of <span>weeks ago,<br/>
🎧 and I've got a <span>part-time <span>job for a few hours a week.<br/>
🎧 What do you do?<br/>
🎧 Well, I've done <span>several different things.<br/>
🎧 I've just <span>finished a <span>short-term <span>contract as a <span>courier,<br/>
🎧 and now I'm working as a <span>waiter in one of the big <span>hotels.<br/>
🎧 That can't leave you much time for <span>studying!<br/>
🎧 Oh, it's not too bad.<br/>
🎧 I <span>manage to fit it all in.<br/>
🎧 What are you <span>studying?<br/>
🎧 My <span>ambition is to go into <span>parliament <span>eventually,<br/>
🎧 so my <span>major <span>subject is <span>politics.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>partly why I think the <span>Youth <span>Council is important and want to be a <span>part of it.<br/>
🎧 And I <span>suppose you're also taking a <span>minor <span>subject, aren't you?<br/>
🎧 I know a lot of people <span>study <span>economics too.<br/>
🎧 I <span>chose <span>history.<br/>
🎧 To be <span>honest, I'm not <span>finding it as <span>interesting as I <span>expected!<br/>
🎧 OK, so with your <span>studying and your <span>part-time <span>job,<br/>
🎧 do you have time for any other <span>interests or <span>hobbies?<br/>
🎧 Well, I <span>spend quite a lot of time <span>cycling <span>-<br/>
🎧 both around <span>town to get to university and to work,<br/>
🎧 and also <span>long-distance, from here to <span>London, for <span>instance.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>pretty <span>impressive!<br/>
🎧 Anything else?<br/>
🎧 For <span>relaxation I'm also <span>keen on the <span>cinema <span>-<br/>
🎧 I used to go at <span>least once a week, but I can't <span>manage to go so often now.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Are you sure you'll have enough time for the <span>Youth <span>Council?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I've <span>worked out that I can <span>afford to <span>reduce my hours at work, and that will make the time.<br/>
🎧 So is there any <span>particular <span>aspect of the <span>Youth <span>Council's work that <span>appeals to you, <span>Roger?<br/>
🎧 Well, my <span>sister is <span>blind,<br/>
🎧 so I'm <span>particularly interested in working with <span>disabled young people,<br/>
🎧 to try and <span>improve the <span>quality of their lives.<br/>
🎧 That's great.<br/>
🎧 Well, the best way to get <span>involved is to be <span>nominated by some people who you know.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Can you tell me how to set about <span>organising that?<br/>
🎧 You should talk to <span>Jeffrey, our <span>Elections <span>Officer.<br/>
🎧 I can <span>arrange a <span>meeting in the <span>council <span>office with him, if you like.<br/>
🎧 Yes, please.<br/>
🎧 He'll be here next <span>Monday, if that <span>suits you.<br/>
🎧 That's the <span>14th, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 I can <span>manage <span>late <span>afternoon.<br/>
🎧 Would you like to <span>suggest a time?<br/>
🎧 He <span>generally leaves around <span>5.30.<br/>
🎧 Well, would <span>4.30 be OK?<br/>
🎧 My last class <span>finishes at <span>4, so I'd have <span>plenty of time to get to your <span>office.<br/>
🎧 Right, that's fine.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and could I have a phone number we can <span>contact you on?<br/>
🎧 Yes, my <span>mobile <span>number's <span>07788136711.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Well, we'll look forward to <span>seeing you next week.<br/>
🎧 Thanks very much.<br/>
🎧 <span>Goodbye.<br/>
🎧 Bye.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Hi. Great to see you!<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>Jody, and I'll be looking after both of you for the first month you're working here at the <span>Amersham <span>Theatre.<br/>
🎧 I'll tell you something about the <span>theatre now, then take you to meet two of the other <span>staff.<br/>
🎧 It's an old <span>building, and it's been <span>modernised <span>several <span>times.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact, as you can see, we're <span>carrying out a <span>major <span>refurbishment at the <span>moment.<br/>
🎧 The <span>interior has just been <span>repainted,<br/>
🎧 and we're about to start on the <span>exterior of the <span>building <span>-<br/>
🎧 <span>that'll be a big <span>job.<br/>
🎧 The <span>work's <span>running over <span>budget,<br/>
🎧 so we've had to <span>postpone <span>installing an <span>elevator.<br/>
🎧 I hope you're happy <span>running up and down <span>stairs!<br/>
🎧 When the <span>theatre was <span>built,<br/>
🎧 people were <span>generally <span>slimmer and <span>shorter than now,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>seats were very <span>close together.<br/>
🎧 We've <span>replaced them with <span>larger <span>seats, with more <span>legroom.<br/>
🎧 This <span>means <span>fewer <span>seats in <span>total,<br/>
🎧 but we've taken the <span>opportunity to <span>install <span>seats that can <span>easily be <span>moved, to <span>create different <span>acting <span>spaces.<br/>
🎧 We've also <span>turned a few <span>storerooms over to other <span>purposes like <span>using them for <span>meetings.<br/>
🎧 We try <span>hard to <span>involve <span>members of the <span>public in the <span>theatre.<br/>
🎧 One way is by <span>organising <span>backstage <span>tours<br/>
🎧 so people can be <span>shown <span>round the <span>building and learn how a <span>theatre <span>operates.<br/>
🎧 These are <span>proving very <span>popular.<br/>
🎧 What we're <span>finding is that people want to have lunch or a cup of <span>coffee while they're here,<br/>
🎧 so we're looking into the <span>possibility of <span>opening a <span>café in <span>due course.<br/>
🎧 We have a <span>bookshop, which <span>specialises in books about <span>drama<br/>
🎧 and that <span>attracts <span>plenty of <span>customers.<br/>
🎧 Then there are two large <span>rooms that will be <span>decorated next month,<br/>
🎧 and they'll be <span>available for <span>hire,<br/>
🎧 for <span>conferences and <span>private <span>functions, such as <span>parties.<br/>
🎧 We're also <span>considering <span>hiring out <span>costumes to <span>amateur <span>drama <span>clubs.<br/>
🎧 Now I want to tell you about our <span>workshops.<br/>
🎧 We <span>recently <span>started a <span>programme of <span>workshops that <span>anyone can join.<br/>
🎧 <span>Eventually we <span>intend to run <span>courses in <span>acting,<br/>
🎧 but we're <span>waiting until we've got the right people in place as <span>trainers.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>proving more <span>difficult than we'd <span>expected!<br/>
🎧 There's a big <span>demand to learn about the <span>technical side of <span>putting on a <span>production,<br/>
🎧 and our <span>lighting <span>workshop has already <span>started with great success.<br/>
🎧 We're going to start one on sound next month.<br/>
🎧 A number of people have <span>enquired about <span>workshops on <span>make-up,<br/>
🎧 and that's something we're <span>considering for the future.<br/>
🎧 A <span>surprise success is the <span>workshop on <span>making <span>puppets <span>-<br/>
🎧 we <span>happen to have <span>someone working here who does it as a hobby,<br/>
🎧 and she <span>offered to run a <span>workshop.<br/>
🎧 It was so <span>popular we're now <span>running them every month!<br/>
🎧 Now, a <span>word about the <span>layout of the <span>building.<br/>
🎧 The <span>auditorium, <span>stage and <span>dressing <span>rooms for the <span>actors are all <span>below <span>ground <span>level.<br/>
🎧 Here on the <span>ground <span>floor we have most of the <span>rooms that the <span>public doesn't see.<br/>
🎧 The <span>majority are <span>internal, so they have <span>windows in the <span>roof to <span>light them.<br/>
🎧 <span>Standing here in the <span>foyer, you're probably <span>wondering why the box <span>office isn't here,<br/>
🎧 where the <span>public would <span>expect to find it.<br/>
🎧 Well, you might have <span>noticed it on your way in <span>-<br/>
🎧 although it's <span>part of this <span>building, it's next <span>door with a <span>separate <span>entrance from the <span>road.<br/>
🎧 For the <span>theatre <span>manager's <span>office, you go across the <span>foyer and through the <span>double <span>doors,<br/>
🎧 <span>turn right, and it's the room at the end of the <span>corridor, with the <span>door on the <span>left.<br/>
🎧 The <span>lighting box is where the <span>computerised <span>stage <span>lighting is <span>operated<br/>
🎧 and it's at the back of the <span>building.<br/>
🎧 When you're through the <span>double <span>doors<br/>
🎧 <span>turn <span>left, <span>turn right at the water <span>cooler, and right again at the end.<br/>
🎧 It's the second room along that <span>corridor.<br/>
🎧 The <span>lighting box has a <span>window into the <span>auditorium,<br/>
🎧 which of course is <span>below us.<br/>
🎧 The <span>artistic <span>director's <span>office is through the <span>double <span>doors,<br/>
🎧 <span>turn right and it's the first room you come to on the <span>right-hand side.<br/>
🎧 And finally, for the <span>moment,<br/>
🎧 the room where I'll take you next <span>- the <span>relaxation room.<br/>
🎧 So if you'd <span>like...<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 I've <span>brought my <span>notes on our <span>Biology <span>Field <span>Trip to <span>Rocky <span>Bay, <span>Colin,<br/>
🎧 so we can work on our <span>report on the <span>research we did together.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 I've got <span>mine too. Let's look at the <span>aims of the <span>trip first.<br/>
🎧 Right. What did you have?<br/>
🎧 I just put something about getting <span>experience of the different <span>sorts of <span>procedures used on a <span>field <span>trip.<br/>
🎧 But we need something about what <span>causes different <span>organisms to choose <span>particular <span>habitats.<br/>
🎧 I agree.<br/>
🎧 And something about <span>finding out how to <span>protect <span>organisms in <span>danger of <span>dying out?<br/>
🎧 In our <span>aims?<br/>
🎧 But we weren't really looking at that.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose not.<br/>
🎧 OK, now there's the <span>list of <span>equipment we all had to <span>bring on the <span>field <span>trip.<br/>
🎧 What did they tell us to <span>bring a <span>ruler for?<br/>
🎧 It was something about <span>measuring the <span>slope of the <span>shore,<br/>
🎧 but of course we didn't need it because we were <span>measuring <span>wind <span>direction,<br/>
🎧 and we'd <span>brought the <span>compass for <span>that…<br/>
🎧 But not the <span>piece of <span>string to <span>hold up in the air!<br/>
🎧 Didn't Mr <span>Blake make a <span>fuss about us <span>leaving that behind.<br/>
🎧 He does go on.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway it was easy to get one from another of the students.<br/>
🎧 Now, the next <span>section's the <span>procedure.<br/>
🎧 I <span>sent you the <span>draft of that.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. <span>And..<br/>
🎧 It was <span>clear, but I don't think we need all these <span>details of what time we <span>left and what time we got back <span>and...<br/>
🎧 how we <span>divided up the different <span>research <span>tasks.<br/>
🎧 OK. I'll look at that again.<br/>
🎧 Then we have to <span>describe our <span>method of <span>investigation in <span>detail.<br/>
🎧 So let's <span>begin with how we <span>measured <span>wave <span>speed.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>surprised how <span>straightforward that was.<br/>
🎧 I'd <span>expected us to have some <span>sort of <span>high-tech <span>device,<br/>
🎧 not just <span>stand there and <span>count the number of <span>waves <span>per <span>minute.<br/>
🎧 Not very <span>precise, but I <span>suppose it was good enough.<br/>
🎧 But the way we <span>measured the amount of <span>salt was <span>interesting.<br/>
🎧 In the water from the <span>rock <span>pools?<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I wanted to check the <span>chemicals we used in the <span>lab when we <span>analysed those <span>samples <span>-<br/>
🎧 was it <span>potassium <span>chromate and <span>silver <span>nitrate?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And we need the map of the <span>seashore.<br/>
🎧 You just <span>left that to me.<br/>
🎧 And I had to do it while the <span>tide was low,<br/>
🎧 well, that was OK, but the place I <span>started it from was down on the <span>beach,<br/>
🎧 then I <span>realised I should have <span>gone up <span>higher to get better <span>visibility,<br/>
🎧 so I had to start all over again.<br/>
🎧 But at <span>least I'd got the <span>squared <span>paper or I'd have had <span>problems <span>drawing it all to <span>scale.<br/>
🎧 It looks good.<br/>
🎧 We could get a map of the <span>region off the <span>internet and see if we need to make any changes.<br/>
🎧 I had a look but I couldn't find anything.<br/>
🎧 But you took some <span>pictures, didn't you?<br/>
🎧 Yeah. I'll <span>email you them if you want.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 I'll make my <span>amendments <span>using those, then I can <span>scan it into our <span>report.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 Now when we get to our <span>findings I thought we could <span>divide them up into the different <span>zones we <span>identified on the <span>shore<br/>
🎧 and the <span>problems <span>organisms <span>face in each <span>zone.<br/>
🎧 So for the <span>highest <span>area… <span>…the <span>splash <span>zone?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, we <span>found <span>mostly those <span>tiny <span>shellfish that have <span>strong <span>hard <span>shells that act as <span>protection.<br/>
🎧 But not from other <span>organisms that might eat them, <span>predators?<br/>
🎧 No, that's not the <span>main <span>danger for them.<br/>
🎧 But the <span>shells <span>prevent them from <span>drying <span>out<br/>
🎧 because they're in the open air for most of the time.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And since they're <span>exposed, they need to be able to find some <span>sort of <span>shelter, or <span>cover <span>themselves up, so they don't get too hot.<br/>
🎧 Then in the <span>middle and <span>lower <span>zones, <span>nearer the sea,<br/>
🎧 we need to <span>discuss the <span>effects of <span>wave <span>action…<br/>
🎧 Yes, and how <span>organisms <span>develop <span>structures to <span>prevent <span>themselves from being <span>swept away,<br/>
🎧 or even <span>destroyed by being <span>smashed <span>against the <span>rocks.<br/>
🎧 I haven't done anything on the <span>geological changes.<br/>
🎧 I don't know what to put for that.<br/>
🎧 No, we weren't <span>concentrating on that.<br/>
🎧 Maybe we need to find some <span>websites.<br/>
🎧 Good idea.<br/>
🎧 I've got the <span>lecture <span>notes from Mr <span>Blake's <span>geology course,<br/>
🎧 but they're too <span>general.<br/>
🎧 But we could ask him which books on our <span>Reading <span>List might be most <span>helpful.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 OK, now I did a <span>draft of the <span>section of <span>sources of <span>possible <span>error in our <span>research,<br/>
🎧 but I don't know if you agree.<br/>
🎧 For example, the size of the <span>sample, and <span>whether it's big enough to make any <span>general <span>conclusions from.<br/>
🎧 But I thought actually we did have quite a big <span>sample.<br/>
🎧 We did.<br/>
🎧 And our <span>general <span>method of <span>observation <span>seemed quite <span>reliable.<br/>
🎧 But we might not be all that <span>accurate as <span>far as the <span>actual <span>numbers go.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, we might have <span>missed some <span>organisms <span>-<br/>
🎧 if they were <span>hiding under a <span>rock, for example.<br/>
🎧 I wasn't sure about the way we <span>described their <span>habitats.<br/>
🎧 I <span>decided it was probably OK.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, and the <span>descriptions we gave of the <span>smaller <span>organisms,<br/>
🎧 they weren't very <span>detailed, but they were <span>adequate in this <span>context.<br/>
🎧 I'm not sure we <span>identified all the <span>species <span>correctly though.<br/>
🎧 OK, we'd better <span>mention that.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 We've been <span>discussing the <span>factors the <span>architect has to <span>consider when <span>designing <span>domestic <span>buildings.<br/>
🎧 I'm going to move on now to <span>consider the <span>design of <span>public <span>buildings,<br/>
🎧 and I'll <span>illustrate this by <span>referring to the new <span>Taylor <span>Concert <span>Hall that's <span>recently been <span>completed here in the <span>city.<br/>
🎧 So, as with a <span>domestic <span>building,<br/>
🎧 when <span>designing a <span>public <span>building, an <span>architect needs to <span>consider the <span>function of the <span>building <span>-<br/>
🎧 for example, is it to be used <span>primarily for <span>entertainment, or for <span>education, or for <span>administration?<br/>
🎧 The second thing the <span>architect needs to think about is the <span>context of the <span>building,<br/>
🎧 this <span>includes its <span>physical <span>location <span>obviously,<br/>
🎧 but it also <span>includes the <span>social <span>meaning of the <span>building:<br/>
🎧 how it <span>relates to the people it's <span>built for.<br/>
🎧 And finally, for important <span>public <span>buildings,<br/>
🎧 the <span>architect may also be looking for a <span>central <span>symbolic idea on which to <span>base the <span>design,<br/>
🎧 a <span>sort of <span>metaphor for the <span>building and the way in which it is used.<br/>
🎧 Let's look at the new <span>Taylor <span>Concert <span>Hall in <span>relation to these <span>ideas.<br/>
🎧 The <span>location <span>chosen was a <span>site in a <span>run-down <span>district that has been <span>ignored in <span>previous <span>redevelopment <span>plans.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>occupied by a <span>factory that had been empty for some years.<br/>
🎧 The whole <span>area was some <span>distance from the <span>high-rise <span>office <span>blocks of the <span>central <span>business <span>district and <span>shopping <span>centre,<br/>
🎧 but it was only one <span>kilometre from the <span>ring <span>road.<br/>
🎧 The <span>site <span>itself was <span>bordered to the <span>north by a <span>canal<br/>
🎧 which had once been used by <span>boats <span>bringing in raw <span>materials when the <span>area was used for <span>manufacturing.<br/>
🎧 The <span>architect <span>chosen for the <span>project was <span>Tom <span>Harrison.<br/>
🎧 He <span>found the <span>main <span>design <span>challenge was the <span>location of the <span>site in an <span>area that had no <span>neighbouring <span>buildings of any <span>importance.<br/>
🎧 To <span>reflect the <span>fact that the <span>significance of the <span>building in this quite <span>run-down <span>location was as yet <span>unknown,<br/>
🎧 he <span>decided to <span>create a <span>building <span>centred around the idea of a <span>mystery <span>-<br/>
🎧 something whose <span>meaning still has to be <span>discovered.<br/>
🎧 So how was this <span>reflected in the <span>design of the <span>building?<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>Harrison <span>decided to <span>create <span>pedestrian <span>access to the <span>building<br/>
🎧 and to make use of the <span>presence of water on the <span>site.<br/>
🎧 As people <span>approach the <span>entrance, they <span>therefore have to <span>cross over a <span>bridge.<br/>
🎧 He wanted to give people a feeling of <span>suspense<br/>
🎧 as they see the <span>building first from a <span>distance, and then <span>close-up,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>initial <span>impression he wanted to <span>create from the <span>shape of the <span>building as a whole was that of a box.<br/>
🎧 The first side that people see, the <span>southern <span>wall, is just a high, <span>flat <span>wall <span>uninterrupted by any <span>windows.<br/>
🎧 This might sound <span>off-putting,<br/>
🎧 but it <span>supports <span>Harrison's <span>concept of the <span>building <span>-<br/>
🎧 that the person <span>approaching is <span>intrigued and <span>wonders what will be inside.<br/>
🎧 And this <span>flat <span>wall also has another <span>purpose.<br/>
🎧 At <span>night-time, <span>projectors are <span>switched on and it <span>functions as a <span>huge <span>screen,<br/>
🎧 <span>onto which <span>images are <span>projected.<br/>
🎧 The <span>auditorium <span>itself <span>seats <span>1500 people.<br/>
🎧 The <span>floor's <span>supported by ten <span>massive <span>pads.<br/>
🎧 These are <span>constructed from <span>rubber,<br/>
🎧 and so are able to <span>absorb any <span>vibrations from <span>outside<br/>
🎧 and <span>prevent them from <span>affecting the <span>auditorium.<br/>
🎧 The <span>walls are made of <span>several <span>layers of <span>honey-coloured <span>wood,<br/>
🎧 all <span>sourced from <span>local <span>beech <span>trees.<br/>
🎧 In order to <span>improve the <span>acoustic <span>properties of the <span>auditorium and to <span>amplify the sound,<br/>
🎧 they are not <span>straight, they are <span>curved.<br/>
🎧 The <span>acoustics are also <span>adjustable <span>according to the size of <span>orchestra and the <span>type of music being <span>played.<br/>
🎧 In order to <span>achieve this, there are <span>nine <span>movable <span>panels in the <span>ceiling <span>above the <span>orchestra<br/>
🎧 which are all <span>individually <span>motorized,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>walls also have <span>curtains which can be <span>opened or <span>closed to change the <span>acoustics.<br/>
🎧 The <span>reaction of the <span>public to the new <span>building has <span>generally been <span>positive.<br/>
🎧 <span>However, the <span>evaluation of some <span>critics has been less <span>enthusiastic.<br/>
🎧 In <span>spite of <span>Harrison's <span>efforts to use <span>local <span>materials,<br/>
🎧 they <span>criticise the <span>style of the <span>design as being <span>international rather than <span>local,<br/>
🎧 and say it doesn't <span>reflect <span>features of the <span>landscape or <span>society for which it is <span>built.<br/>
