🎧 Hello, West Bay Hotel. Can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Oh, good morning.<br/>
🎧 I'm ringing about your advertisement in the Evening Gazette.<br/>
🎧 Is that the one for temporary staff?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 I'm afraid the person who's dealing with that isn't in today,<br/>
🎧 but I can give you the main details if you like.<br/>
🎧 Yes, please.<br/>
🎧 Could you tell me what kind of staff you are looking for?<br/>
🎧 We're looking for waiters at the moment.<br/>
🎧 There was one post for a cook, but that's already been taken.<br/>
🎧 Oh right.<br/>
🎧 What are the hours of work?<br/>
🎧 There are two different shifts -<br/>
🎧 there's a day shift from 7 to 2<br/>
🎧 and a late shift from 4 till 11.<br/>
🎧 And can people choose which one they want to do?<br/>
🎧 Not normally, because everyone would choose the day shift I suppose.<br/>
🎧 You alternate from one week to another.<br/>
🎧 Okay. I'm just writing all this down.<br/>
🎧 What about time off?<br/>
🎧 You get one day off<br/>
🎧 and I think you can negotiate which one you want,<br/>
🎧 it's more or less up to you.<br/>
🎧 But it has to be the same one every week.<br/>
🎧 Do you know what the rates of pay are?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I've got them here.<br/>
🎧 You get £5.50 an hour,<br/>
🎧 and that includes a break.<br/>
🎧 Do I have to go home to eat or…<br/>
🎧 You don't have to.<br/>
🎧 You can get a meal in the hotel if you want to,<br/>
🎧 and there's no charge for it so you might as well.<br/>
🎧 Oh good.<br/>
🎧 Yes, so let's see.<br/>
🎧 I'd get er..., 221, no, no, £231 a week?<br/>
🎧 You'd also get tips.<br/>
🎧 Our guests tend to be quite generous.<br/>
🎧 Erm, is there a uniform?<br/>
🎧 What about clothes?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I forgot to mention that.<br/>
🎧 You need to wear a white shirt, just a plain one,<br/>
🎧 and dark trousers.<br/>
🎧 You know, not green or anything like that.<br/>
🎧 And we don't supply those.<br/>
🎧 That's okay, I've got trousers,<br/>
🎧 I'd just have to buy a couple of shirts.<br/>
🎧 What about anything else?<br/>
🎧 Do I need a waistcoat or anything?<br/>
🎧 You have to wear a jacket, but the hotel lends you that.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 One last thing - I don't know what the starting date is.<br/>
🎧 Just a minute, I think it's sometime around the end of June.<br/>
🎧 Yes, the 28th, in time for the summer.<br/>
🎧 That's great. I'm available from the 10th.<br/>
🎧 Oh good.<br/>
🎧 Well, if you can call again you need to speak to the Service Manager.<br/>
🎧 Her name's Jane Urwin,<br/>
🎧 that's URWIN,<br/>
🎧 and she'll probably arrange to meet you.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 And when's the best time to ring?<br/>
🎧 Could you call tomorrow?<br/>
🎧 She usually starts checking the rooms at midday,<br/>
🎧 so before then if you can, so she'll have more time to chat.<br/>
🎧 I'll just give you her number because she's got a direct line.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 It's 832009.<br/>
🎧 823009?<br/>
🎧 832.<br/>
🎧 Oh, okay.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I'll do that.<br/>
🎧 And by the way, she will ask you for a reference,<br/>
🎧 so you might like to be thinking about that.<br/>
🎧 You know, just someone who knows you and can vouch for you.<br/>
🎧 Yes, no problem.<br/>
🎧 Well, thanks very much for your help.<br/>
🎧 You're welcome.<br/>
🎧 Bye.<br/>
🎧 Bye.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Good morning and welcome again to Your City Today.<br/>
🎧 With me today is Graham Campbell, a councillor from the city council.<br/>
🎧 He'll be telling us about the plan to improve the fast-growing suburb of Red Hill.<br/>
🎧 Good morning Graham and welcome to the show.<br/>
🎧 Good morning, Carol.<br/>
🎧 Now, Graham, I understand that there has been a lot of community consultations for the new plan?<br/>
🎧 Yes, we've tried to address some of the concerns that local groups told us about.<br/>
🎧 People we've heard from are mainly worried about traffic in the area,<br/>
🎧 and, in particular, the increasing speed of cars near schools.<br/>
🎧 They feel that it is only a matter of time before there is an accident as a lot of the children walk to the school.<br/>
🎧 So we're trying to do something about that.<br/>
🎧 Another area of concern is the overhead power lines.<br/>
🎧 These are very old and a lot of people we spoke to asked if something could be done about them.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm happy to report<br/>
🎧 the power company have agreed to move the power lines underground at a cost of $800,000.<br/>
🎧 I think that will really improve the look of the area, as well as being safer.<br/>
🎧 That's good to know,<br/>
🎧 but will that mean an increase in rates for the local businesses in that area?<br/>
🎧 Well, the power company have agreed to bear the cost of this themselves after a lot of discussion with the council.<br/>
🎧 This is wonderful news<br/>
🎧 as the council now has some extra funds for us to put into other things like tree planting and art work.<br/>
🎧 Now, we've also put together a map which we've sent out to all the residents in the area.<br/>
🎧 And on the map we've marked the proposed changes.<br/>
🎧 Firstly, we'll plant mature pine trees to provide shelter and shade just to the right of the supermarket in Days Road.<br/>
🎧 In order to address the traffic problems,<br/>
🎧 the pavements on the corner of Carberry and Thomas Street will be widened.<br/>
🎧 This will help to reduce the speed of vehicles entering Thomas Street.<br/>
🎧 We think it's very important to separate the local residential streets from the main road.<br/>
🎧 So the roadway at the entry to Thomas Street from Days Road will be painted red.<br/>
🎧 This should mark it more clearly and act as a signal for traffic to slow down.<br/>
🎧 One way of making sure that the pedestrians are safe is to increase signage at the intersections.<br/>
🎧 A 'keep clear' sign will be erected at the junction of Evelyn Street and Hill Street,<br/>
🎧 to enable traffic to exit at all times.<br/>
🎧 Something we're planning to do to help control the flow of traffic in the area<br/>
🎧 is to install traffic lights half way down Hill Street where it crosses Days Road.<br/>
🎧 Now, we haven't only thought about the cars and traffic, of course,<br/>
🎧 there's also something for the children.<br/>
🎧 We're going to get school children in the area to research a local story, the life of a local sports hero perhaps,<br/>
🎧 and an artist will incorporate that story into paintings on the wall of a building on the other side of Hill Street from the supermarket.<br/>
🎧 And finally, we've agreed to build a new children's playground<br/>
🎧 which will be at the other end of Hill Street, close to the intersection with Carberry Street.<br/>
🎧 Wonderful!<br/>
🎧 Now, what's the next stage?<br/>
🎧 Well, the final plan…<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Hi Jeannie. How's it going?<br/>
🎧 Oh. Hello Dan.<br/>
🎧 Pretty well, thanks.<br/>
🎧 Have you managed to get the money for the course yet?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's all sorted out now, thanks.<br/>
🎧 It took long enough, though.<br/>
🎧 It was practically a year ago that I applied to my local council for a grant,<br/>
🎧 and it took them six months to turn me down.<br/>
🎧 That's really slow.<br/>
🎧 And I thought I was eligible for government funding,<br/>
🎧 but it seems I was mistaken.<br/>
🎧 So then I asked the boss of the company I used to work for if they would sponsor me,<br/>
🎧 and much to my surprise, he said they'd make a contribution.<br/>
🎧 But what about college grants and scholarships?<br/>
🎧 There must be some you could apply for.<br/>
🎧 Yes, there are,<br/>
🎧 but they're all so small that I decided to leave them until I was desperate.<br/>
🎧 And in fact, I didn't need to apply.<br/>
🎧 My parents had been saying that as I already had a job, I ought to support myself through college.<br/>
🎧 But in the end, they took pity on me, so now I've just about got enough.<br/>
🎧 That's good.<br/>
🎧 So now I can put a bit of effort into meeting people.<br/>
🎧 Haven't had time so far.<br/>
🎧 Any suggestions?<br/>
🎧 What about joining some college clubs?<br/>
🎧 Oh right. You joined several, didn't you?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I'm in the drama club.<br/>
🎧 It's our first performance next week,<br/>
🎧 so we're rehearsing frantically, and I've got behind with my work,<br/>
🎧 but it's worth it.<br/>
🎧 I'm hoping to be in the spring production, too.<br/>
🎧 I've never liked acting.<br/>
🎧 Are you doing anything else?<br/>
🎧 I enjoyed singing when I was at school,<br/>
🎧 so I joined a group when I came to college.<br/>
🎧 I don't think the conductor stretches us enough, though<br/>
🎧 so I'll give up after the next concert.<br/>
🎧 And I also joined the debating society.<br/>
🎧 It's fun, but with all the rehearsing I'm doing, something has to go,<br/>
🎧 and I'm afraid that's the one.<br/>
🎧 Do you do any sports?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I'm in one of the hockey teams.<br/>
🎧 I'm not very good, but I'd really miss it if I stopped.<br/>
🎧 I decided to try tennis when I came to college,<br/>
🎧 and I'm finding it pretty tough going.<br/>
🎧 I'm simply not fit enough.<br/>
🎧 Nor me.<br/>
🎧 I think I'll give that a miss!<br/>
🎧 I'm hoping it'll help me to build up my stamina,<br/>
🎧 but it'll probably be a long haul.<br/>
🎧 Good luck.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 How are you finding the course?<br/>
🎧 I wish we had more seminars.<br/>
🎧 What?<br/>
🎧 I'd have thought we had more than enough already.<br/>
🎧 All those people saying clever things that I could never think of -<br/>
🎧 it's quite interesting, but I wonder if I'm clever enough to be doing this course.<br/>
🎧 I find it helpful to listen to the other people.<br/>
🎧 I like the way we're exploring the subject,<br/>
🎧 and working towards getting insight into it.<br/>
🎧 How do you get on with your tutor?<br/>
🎧 I don't think I'm on the same wavelength as mine,<br/>
🎧 so I feel I'm not getting anything out of the tutorials.<br/>
🎧 It would be more productive to read a book instead.<br/>
🎧 Oh, mine's very demanding.<br/>
🎧 She gives me lots of feedback and advice,<br/>
🎧 so I've got much better at writing essays.<br/>
🎧 And she's helping me plan my revision for the end-of-year exams.<br/>
🎧 Do you tell me, I always struggle with revision.<br/>
🎧 Well, the first thing is to find out exactly what's required in the exams.<br/>
🎧 Would it help to get hold of some past papers?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 They'll help to make it clear.<br/>
🎧 Right, I'll do that.<br/>
🎧 Then what?<br/>
🎧 Then you can sort out your revision priorities,<br/>
🎧 based on what's most likely to come up.<br/>
🎧 I put these on a card, and read them through regularly.<br/>
🎧 But that isn't enough in itself.<br/>
🎧 You also need a timetable, to see how you can fit everything in, in the time available.<br/>
🎧 Then keep it in front of you while you're studying.<br/>
🎧 I've done that before, but it hasn't helped me!<br/>
🎧 Maybe you need to do something different every day,<br/>
🎧 so if you break down your revision into small tasks, and allocate them to specific days,<br/>
🎧 there's more incentive to tackle them.<br/>
🎧 With big topics you're more likely to put off starting.<br/>
🎧 Good idea.<br/>
🎧 And as I revise each topic<br/>
🎧 I write a single paragraph about it -<br/>
🎧 then later I can read it through quickly, and it helps fix things in my mind.<br/>
🎧 That's brilliant.<br/>
🎧 I also write answers to questions for the exam practice.<br/>
🎧 It's hard to make myself do it, though!<br/>
🎧 Well, I'll try.<br/>
🎧 Thanks a lot, Jeannie. That's a great help.<br/>
🎧 No problem.<br/>
🎧 See you around.<br/>
🎧 Bye.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Good morning, everyone.<br/>
🎧 I've been invited to talk about my research project into Australian Aboriginal rock paintings.<br/>
🎧 The Australian Aborigines have recorded both real and symbolic images of their time on rock walls for many thousands of years.<br/>
🎧 Throughout the long history of this tradition,<br/>
🎧 new images have appeared and new painting styles have developed.<br/>
🎧 And these characteristics can be used to categorise the different artistic styles.<br/>
🎧 Among these are what we call the Dynamic, Yam and Modern styles of painting.<br/>
🎧 One of the most significant characteristics of the different styles is the way that humans are depicted in the paintings.<br/>
🎧 The more recent paintings show people in static poses.<br/>
🎧 But the first human images to dominate rock art paintings, over 8,000 years ago, were full of movement.<br/>
🎧 These paintings showed people hunting and cooking food<br/>
🎧 and so they were given the name 'Dynamic' to reflect this energy.<br/>
🎧 It's quite amazing considering they were painted in such a simple stick-like form.<br/>
🎧 In the Yam period, there was a movement away from the stick figures to a more naturalistic shape.<br/>
🎧 However, they didn't go as far as the Modern style,<br/>
🎧 which is known as 'X-ray' because it actually makes a feature of the internal skeleton<br/>
🎧 as well as the organs of animals and humans.<br/>
🎧 The Yam style of painting got its name from the fact that it featured much curvier figures<br/>
🎧 that actually resemble the vegetable called a yam,<br/>
🎧 which is similar to a sweet potato.<br/>
🎧 The Modern paintings are interesting because they include paintings at the time of the first contact with European settlers.<br/>
🎧 Aborigines managed to convey the idea of the settlers' clothing by simply painting the Europeans without any hands,<br/>
🎧 indicating the habit of standing with their hands in their pockets!<br/>
🎧 Size is another characteristic.<br/>
🎧 The more recent images tend to be life size or even larger,<br/>
🎧 but the Dynamic figures are painted in miniature.<br/>
🎧 Aboriginal rock art also records the environmental changes that occurred over thousands of years.<br/>
🎧 For example, we know from the Dynamic paintings that over 8,000 years ago,<br/>
🎧 Aborigines would have rarely eaten fish<br/>
🎧 and sea levels were much lower at this time.<br/>
🎧 In fact, fish didn't start to appear in paintings until the Yam period<br/>
🎧 along with shells and other marine images.<br/>
🎧 The paintings of the Yam tradition also suggest that, during this time,<br/>
🎧 the Aborigines moved away from animals as their main food source<br/>
🎧 and began including vegetables in their diet, as these feature prominently.<br/>
🎧 Freshwater creatures didn't appear in the paintings until the Modern period from 4,000 years ago.<br/>
🎧 So, these paintings have already taught us a lot.<br/>
🎧 But one image that has always intrigued us is known as the 'Rainbow Serpent'.<br/>
🎧 The Rainbow Serpent, which is the focus of my most recent project,<br/>
🎧 gets its name from its snake or serpent-like body<br/>
🎧 and it first appeared in the Yam period 4 to 6,000 years ago.<br/>
🎧 Many believe it is a curious mixture of kangaroo, snake and crocodile.<br/>
🎧 But we decided to study the Rainbow Serpent paintings<br/>
🎧 to see if we could locate the animal that the very first painters based their image on.<br/>
🎧 The Yam period coincided with the end of the last ice age.<br/>
🎧 This brought about tremendous change in the environment,<br/>
🎧 with the sea levels rising and creeping steadily inland.<br/>
🎧 This flooded many familiar land features<br/>
🎧 and also caused a great deal of disruption to traditional patterns of life,<br/>
🎧 hunting in particular.<br/>
🎧 New shores were formed and totally different creatures would have washed up onto the shores.<br/>
🎧 We studied 107 paintings of the Rainbow Serpent<br/>
🎧 and found that the one creature that matches it most closely was the Ribboned Pipefish,<br/>
🎧 which is a type of sea horse.<br/>
🎧 This sea creature would have been a totally unfamiliar sight in the inland regions where the image is found<br/>
🎧 and may have been the inspiration behind the early paintings.<br/>
🎧 So, at the end of the ice age, there would have been enormous changes in animal and plant life.<br/>
🎧 It's not surprising then, that the Aborigines linked this abundance to the new creatures they witnessed.<br/>
🎧 Even today, Aborigines see the Rainbow Serpent as a symbol of creation,<br/>
🎧 which is understandable given the increase in vegetation and the new life forms that featured when the image first appeared.<br/>
<br/><br/>
