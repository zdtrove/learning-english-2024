🎧 Hello, <span>West</span> <span>Bay</span> <span>Hotel</span>. Can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Oh, good morning.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>ringing</span> about your <span>advertisement</span> in the <span>Evening</span> <span>Gazette</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is that the one for <span>temporary</span> <span>staff</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>afraid</span> the person who's <span>dealing</span> with that isn't in today,<br/>
🎧 but I can give you the <span>main</span> <span>details</span> if you like.<br/>
🎧 Yes, please.<br/>
🎧 Could you tell me what kind of <span>staff</span> you are looking for?<br/>
🎧 We're looking for <span>waiters</span> at the <span>moment</span>.<br/>
🎧 There was one <span>post</span> for a <span>cook</span>, but that's already been taken.<br/>
🎧 Oh right.<br/>
🎧 What are the hours of work?<br/>
🎧 There are two different <span>shifts</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 there's a day <span>shift</span> from <span>7</span> to <span>2<br/></span>
🎧 and a <span>late</span> <span>shift</span> from <span>4</span> <span>till</span> <span>11</span>.<br/>
🎧 And can people choose which one they want to do?<br/>
🎧 Not <span>normally</span>, because everyone would choose the day <span>shift</span> I <span>suppose</span>.<br/>
🎧 You <span>alternate</span> from one week to another.<br/>
🎧 Okay. I'm just <span>writing</span> all this down.<br/>
🎧 What about time off?<br/>
🎧 You get one day <span>off<br/></span>
🎧 and I think you can <span>negotiate</span> which one you want,<br/>
🎧 it's more or less up to you.<br/>
🎧 But it has to be the same one every week.<br/>
🎧 Do you know what the <span>rates</span> of pay are?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I've got them here.<br/>
🎧 You get <span>£5.50</span> an <span>hour</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that <span>includes</span> a <span>break</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do I have to go home to eat <span>or…<br/></span>
🎧 You don't have to.<br/>
🎧 You can get a <span>meal</span> in the <span>hotel</span> if you want to,<br/>
🎧 and there's no <span>charge</span> for it so you might as well.<br/>
🎧 Oh good.<br/>
🎧 Yes, so let's see.<br/>
🎧 I'd get <span>er...</span>, <span>221</span>, no, no, <span>£231</span> a week?<br/>
🎧 You'd also get <span>tips</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>guests</span> <span>tend</span> to be quite <span>generous</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Erm</span>, is there a <span>uniform</span>?<br/>
🎧 What about <span>clothes</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I <span>forgot</span> to <span>mention</span> that.<br/>
🎧 You need to <span>wear</span> a <span>white</span> <span>shirt</span>, just a <span>plain</span> one,<br/>
🎧 and <span>dark</span> <span>trousers</span>.<br/>
🎧 You know, not <span>green</span> or anything like that.<br/>
🎧 And we don't <span>supply</span> those.<br/>
🎧 That's okay, I've got <span>trousers</span>,<br/>
🎧 I'd just have to buy a <span>couple</span> of <span>shirts</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about anything else?<br/>
🎧 Do I need a <span>waistcoat</span> or anything?<br/>
🎧 You have to <span>wear</span> a <span>jacket</span>, but the <span>hotel</span> <span>lends</span> you that.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 One last thing <span>-</span> I don't know what the <span>starting</span> date is.<br/>
🎧 Just a <span>minute</span>, I think it's sometime around the end of <span>June</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, the <span>28th</span>, in time for the <span>summer</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's great. I'm <span>available</span> from the <span>10th</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh good.<br/>
🎧 Well, if you can call again you need to speak to the <span>Service</span> <span>Manager</span>.<br/>
🎧 Her <span>name's</span> <span>Jane</span> <span>Urwin</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's <span>URWIN</span>,<br/>
🎧 and she'll probably <span>arrange</span> to meet you.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 And when's the best time to <span>ring</span>?<br/>
🎧 Could you call <span>tomorrow</span>?<br/>
🎧 She usually <span>starts</span> <span>checking</span> the <span>rooms</span> at <span>midday</span>,<br/>
🎧 so before then if you can, so she'll have more time to <span>chat</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll just give you her number because she's got a <span>direct</span> <span>line</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>832009</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>823009</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>832</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, okay.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I'll do that.<br/>
🎧 And by the way, she will ask you for a <span>reference</span>,<br/>
🎧 so you might like to be thinking about that.<br/>
🎧 You know, just <span>someone</span> who <span>knows</span> you and can <span>vouch</span> for you.<br/>
🎧 Yes, no <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, thanks very much for your help.<br/>
🎧 You're <span>welcome</span>.<br/>
🎧 Bye.<br/>
🎧 Bye.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Good morning and <span>welcome</span> again to Your <span>City</span> Today.<br/>
🎧 With me today is <span>Graham</span> <span>Campbell</span>, a <span>councillor</span> from the <span>city</span> <span>council</span>.<br/>
🎧 He'll be <span>telling</span> us about the plan to <span>improve</span> the <span>fast-growing</span> <span>suburb</span> of Red <span>Hill</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good morning <span>Graham</span> and <span>welcome</span> to the show.<br/>
🎧 Good morning, <span>Carol</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, <span>Graham</span>, I <span>understand</span> that there has been a lot of <span>community</span> <span>consultations</span> for the new plan?<br/>
🎧 Yes, we've <span>tried</span> to <span>address</span> some of the <span>concerns</span> that <span>local</span> <span>groups</span> told us about.<br/>
🎧 People we've heard from are <span>mainly</span> <span>worried</span> about <span>traffic</span> in the <span>area</span>,<br/>
🎧 and, in <span>particular</span>, the <span>increasing</span> <span>speed</span> of <span>cars</span> near <span>schools</span>.<br/>
🎧 They feel that it is only a <span>matter</span> of time before there is an <span>accident</span> as a lot of the children <span>walk</span> to the school.<br/>
🎧 So we're trying to do something about that.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>area</span> of <span>concern</span> is the <span>overhead</span> <span>power</span> <span>lines</span>.<br/>
🎧 These are very old and a lot of people we <span>spoke</span> to <span>asked</span> if something could be done about them.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm happy to <span>report<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>power</span> company have agreed to move the <span>power</span> <span>lines</span> <span>underground</span> at a <span>cost</span> of <span>$800,000</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think that will really <span>improve</span> the look of the <span>area</span>, as well as being <span>safer</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's good to know,<br/>
🎧 but will that mean an <span>increase</span> in <span>rates</span> for the <span>local</span> <span>businesses</span> in that <span>area</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, the <span>power</span> company have agreed to <span>bear</span> the <span>cost</span> of this <span>themselves</span> after a lot of <span>discussion</span> with the <span>council</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is wonderful <span>news<br/></span>
🎧 as the <span>council</span> now has some <span>extra</span> <span>funds</span> for us to put into other things like <span>tree</span> <span>planting</span> and <span>art</span> work.<br/>
🎧 Now, we've also put together a map which we've <span>sent</span> out to all the <span>residents</span> in the <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 And on the map we've <span>marked</span> the <span>proposed</span> changes.<br/>
🎧 <span>Firstly</span>, we'll <span>plant</span> <span>mature</span> <span>pine</span> <span>trees</span> to <span>provide</span> <span>shelter</span> and <span>shade</span> just to the right of the <span>supermarket</span> in <span>Days</span> <span>Road</span>.<br/>
🎧 In order to <span>address</span> the <span>traffic</span> <span>problems</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>pavements</span> on the <span>corner</span> of <span>Carberry</span> and <span>Thomas</span> <span>Street</span> will be <span>widened</span>.<br/>
🎧 This will help to <span>reduce</span> the <span>speed</span> of <span>vehicles</span> <span>entering</span> <span>Thomas</span> <span>Street</span>.<br/>
🎧 We think it's very important to <span>separate</span> the <span>local</span> <span>residential</span> <span>streets</span> from the <span>main</span> <span>road</span>.<br/>
🎧 So the <span>roadway</span> at the <span>entry</span> to <span>Thomas</span> <span>Street</span> from <span>Days</span> <span>Road</span> will be <span>painted</span> red.<br/>
🎧 This should <span>mark</span> it more <span>clearly</span> and act as a <span>signal</span> for <span>traffic</span> to <span>slow</span> down.<br/>
🎧 One way of <span>making</span> sure that the <span>pedestrians</span> are <span>safe</span> is to <span>increase</span> <span>signage</span> at the <span>intersections</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>'keep</span> <span>clear'</span> <span>sign</span> will be <span>erected</span> at the <span>junction</span> of <span>Evelyn</span> <span>Street</span> and <span>Hill</span> <span>Street</span>,<br/>
🎧 to <span>enable</span> <span>traffic</span> to <span>exit</span> at all <span>times</span>.<br/>
🎧 Something we're planning to do to help <span>control</span> the <span>flow</span> of <span>traffic</span> in the <span>area<br/></span>
🎧 is to <span>install</span> <span>traffic</span> <span>lights</span> <span>half</span> way down <span>Hill</span> <span>Street</span> where it <span>crosses</span> <span>Days</span> <span>Road</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, we haven't only thought about the <span>cars</span> and <span>traffic</span>, of course,<br/>
🎧 there's also something for the children.<br/>
🎧 We're going to get school children in the <span>area</span> to <span>research</span> a <span>local</span> <span>story</span>, the life of a <span>local</span> <span>sports</span> <span>hero</span> <span>perhaps</span>,<br/>
🎧 and an <span>artist</span> will <span>incorporate</span> that <span>story</span> into <span>paintings</span> on the <span>wall</span> of a <span>building</span> on the other side of <span>Hill</span> <span>Street</span> from the <span>supermarket</span>.<br/>
🎧 And finally, we've agreed to <span>build</span> a new <span>children's</span> <span>playground<br/></span>
🎧 which will be at the other end of <span>Hill</span> <span>Street</span>, <span>close</span> to the <span>intersection</span> with <span>Carberry</span> <span>Street</span>.<br/>
🎧 Wonderful!<br/>
🎧 Now, what's the next <span>stage</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, the <span>final</span> <span>plan…<br/>
</span> <span><br/>

🎧 Hi <span>Jeannie</span>. How's it going?<br/>
🎧 Oh. Hello <span>Dan</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Pretty</span> well, thanks.<br/>
🎧 Have you <span>managed</span> to get the money for the course yet?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's all <span>sorted</span> out now, thanks.<br/>
🎧 It took long enough, though.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>practically</span> a year ago that I <span>applied</span> to my <span>local</span> <span>council</span> for a <span>grant</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it took them six <span>months</span> to <span>turn</span> me down.<br/>
🎧 That's really <span>slow</span>.<br/>
🎧 And I thought I was <span>eligible</span> for <span>government</span> <span>funding</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it <span>seems</span> I was <span>mistaken</span>.<br/>
🎧 So then I <span>asked</span> the <span>boss</span> of the company I used to work for if they would <span>sponsor</span> me,<br/>
🎧 and much to my <span>surprise</span>, he said they'd make a <span>contribution</span>.<br/>
🎧 But what about <span>college</span> <span>grants</span> and <span>scholarships</span>?<br/>
🎧 There must be some you could <span>apply</span> for.<br/>
🎧 Yes, there are,<br/>
🎧 but they're all so small that I <span>decided</span> to leave them until I was <span>desperate</span>.<br/>
🎧 And in <span>fact</span>, I didn't need to <span>apply</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>parents</span> had been saying that as I already had a <span>job</span>, I <span>ought</span> to <span>support</span> myself through <span>college</span>.<br/>
🎧 But in the end, they took <span>pity</span> on me, so now I've just about got enough.<br/>
🎧 That's good.<br/>
🎧 So now I can put a bit of <span>effort</span> into <span>meeting</span> people.<br/>
🎧 Haven't had time so <span>far</span>.<br/>
🎧 Any <span>suggestions</span>?<br/>
🎧 What about <span>joining</span> some <span>college</span> <span>clubs</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh right. You <span>joined</span> <span>several</span>, didn't you?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I'm in the <span>drama</span> <span>club</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's our first <span>performance</span> next week,<br/>
🎧 so we're <span>rehearsing</span> <span>frantically</span>, and I've got behind with my work,<br/>
🎧 but it's <span>worth</span> it.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>hoping</span> to be in the <span>spring</span> <span>production</span>, too.<br/>
🎧 I've never <span>liked</span> <span>acting</span>.<br/>
🎧 Are you doing anything else?<br/>
🎧 I <span>enjoyed</span> <span>singing</span> when I was at school,<br/>
🎧 so I <span>joined</span> a group when I came to <span>college</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't think the <span>conductor</span> <span>stretches</span> us enough, <span>though<br/></span>
🎧 so I'll give up after the next <span>concert</span>.<br/>
🎧 And I also <span>joined</span> the <span>debating</span> <span>society</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's fun, but with all the <span>rehearsing</span> I'm doing, something has to go,<br/>
🎧 and I'm <span>afraid</span> that's the one.<br/>
🎧 Do you do any <span>sports</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I'm in one of the <span>hockey</span> <span>teams</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm not very good, but I'd really <span>miss</span> it if I <span>stopped</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>decided</span> to try <span>tennis</span> when I came to <span>college</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I'm <span>finding</span> it <span>pretty</span> tough going.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>simply</span> not fit enough.<br/>
🎧 <span>Nor</span> me.<br/>
🎧 I think I'll give that a <span>miss</span>!<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>hoping</span> it'll help me to <span>build</span> up my <span>stamina</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it'll probably be a long <span>haul</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good <span>luck</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 How are you <span>finding</span> the course?<br/>
🎧 I wish we had more <span>seminars</span>.<br/>
🎧 What?<br/>
🎧 I'd have thought we had more than enough already.<br/>
🎧 All those people saying <span>clever</span> things that I could never think of <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it's quite <span>interesting</span>, but I <span>wonder</span> if I'm <span>clever</span> enough to be doing this course.<br/>
🎧 I find it <span>helpful</span> to listen to the other people.<br/>
🎧 I like the way we're <span>exploring</span> the <span>subject</span>,<br/>
🎧 and working <span>towards</span> getting <span>insight</span> into it.<br/>
🎧 How do you get on with your <span>tutor</span>?<br/>
🎧 I don't think I'm on the same <span>wavelength</span> as <span>mine</span>,<br/>
🎧 so I feel I'm not getting anything out of the <span>tutorials</span>.<br/>
🎧 It would be more <span>productive</span> to read a book <span>instead</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, <span>mine's</span> very <span>demanding</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>gives</span> me lots of <span>feedback</span> and advice,<br/>
🎧 so I've got much better at <span>writing</span> <span>essays</span>.<br/>
🎧 And she's <span>helping</span> me plan my <span>revision</span> for the <span>end-of-year</span> <span>exams</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you tell me, I always <span>struggle</span> with <span>revision</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, the first thing is to find out exactly what's <span>required</span> in the <span>exams</span>.<br/>
🎧 Would it help to get <span>hold</span> of some <span>past</span> <span>papers</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 They'll help to make it <span>clear</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, I'll do that.<br/>
🎧 Then what?<br/>
🎧 Then you can <span>sort</span> out your <span>revision</span> <span>priorities</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>based</span> on what's most <span>likely</span> to come up.<br/>
🎧 I put these on a <span>card</span>, and read them through <span>regularly</span>.<br/>
🎧 But that isn't enough in <span>itself</span>.<br/>
🎧 You also need a <span>timetable</span>, to see how you can fit everything in, in the time <span>available</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then keep it in <span>front</span> of you while you're <span>studying</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've done that before, but it hasn't <span>helped</span> me!<br/>
🎧 Maybe you need to do something different every day,<br/>
🎧 so if you <span>break</span> down your <span>revision</span> into small <span>tasks</span>, and <span>allocate</span> them to <span>specific</span> <span>days</span>,<br/>
🎧 there's more <span>incentive</span> to <span>tackle</span> them.<br/>
🎧 With big <span>topics</span> you're more <span>likely</span> to put off <span>starting</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good idea.<br/>
🎧 And as I <span>revise</span> each <span>topic<br/></span>
🎧 I <span>write</span> a <span>single</span> <span>paragraph</span> about it <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 then later I can read it through quickly, and it helps fix things in my <span>mind</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>brilliant</span>.<br/>
🎧 I also <span>write</span> <span>answers</span> to <span>questions</span> for the <span>exam</span> practice.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>hard</span> to make myself do it, though!<br/>
🎧 Well, I'll try.<br/>
🎧 Thanks a lot, <span>Jeannie</span>. That's a great help.<br/>
🎧 No <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 See you around.<br/>
🎧 Bye.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Good morning, everyone.<br/>
🎧 I've been <span>invited</span> to talk about my <span>research</span> <span>project</span> into <span>Australian</span> <span>Aboriginal</span> <span>rock</span> <span>paintings</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Australian</span> <span>Aborigines</span> have <span>recorded</span> both <span>real</span> and <span>symbolic</span> <span>images</span> of their time on <span>rock</span> <span>walls</span> for many <span>thousands</span> of years.<br/>
🎧 <span>Throughout</span> the long <span>history</span> of this <span>tradition</span>,<br/>
🎧 new <span>images</span> have <span>appeared</span> and new <span>painting</span> <span>styles</span> have <span>developed</span>.<br/>
🎧 And these <span>characteristics</span> can be used to <span>categorise</span> the different <span>artistic</span> <span>styles</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Among</span> these are what we call the <span>Dynamic</span>, Yam and <span>Modern</span> <span>styles</span> of <span>painting</span>.<br/>
🎧 One of the most <span>significant</span> <span>characteristics</span> of the different <span>styles</span> is the way that <span>humans</span> are <span>depicted</span> in the <span>paintings</span>.<br/>
🎧 The more <span>recent</span> <span>paintings</span> show people in <span>static</span> <span>poses</span>.<br/>
🎧 But the first <span>human</span> <span>images</span> to <span>dominate</span> <span>rock</span> <span>art</span> <span>paintings</span>, over <span>8,000</span> years ago, were full of <span>movement</span>.<br/>
🎧 These <span>paintings</span> <span>showed</span> people <span>hunting</span> and cooking <span>food<br/></span>
🎧 and so they were <span>given</span> the name <span>'Dynamic'</span> to <span>reflect</span> this <span>energy</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's quite amazing <span>considering</span> they were <span>painted</span> in such a simple <span>stick-like</span> <span>form</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the Yam <span>period</span>, there was a <span>movement</span> away from the <span>stick</span> <span>figures</span> to a more <span>naturalistic</span> <span>shape</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, they didn't go as <span>far</span> as the <span>Modern</span> <span>style</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is <span>known</span> as <span>'X-ray'</span> because it actually makes a <span>feature</span> of the <span>internal</span> <span>skeleton<br/></span>
🎧 as well as the <span>organs</span> of <span>animals</span> and <span>humans</span>.<br/>
🎧 The Yam <span>style</span> of <span>painting</span> got its name from the <span>fact</span> that it <span>featured</span> much <span>curvier</span> <span>figures<br/></span>
🎧 that actually <span>resemble</span> the <span>vegetable</span> called a yam,<br/>
🎧 which is <span>similar</span> to a <span>sweet</span> <span>potato</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Modern</span> <span>paintings</span> are <span>interesting</span> because they <span>include</span> <span>paintings</span> at the time of the first <span>contact</span> with <span>European</span> <span>settlers</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Aborigines</span> <span>managed</span> to <span>convey</span> the idea of the <span>settlers'</span> <span>clothing</span> by <span>simply</span> <span>painting</span> the <span>Europeans</span> without any <span>hands</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>indicating</span> the <span>habit</span> of <span>standing</span> with their <span>hands</span> in their <span>pockets</span>!<br/>
🎧 Size is another <span>characteristic</span>.<br/>
🎧 The more <span>recent</span> <span>images</span> <span>tend</span> to be life size or even <span>larger</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>Dynamic</span> <span>figures</span> are <span>painted</span> in <span>miniature</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Aboriginal</span> <span>rock</span> <span>art</span> also <span>records</span> the <span>environmental</span> changes that <span>occurred</span> over <span>thousands</span> of years.<br/>
🎧 For example, we know from the <span>Dynamic</span> <span>paintings</span> that over <span>8,000</span> years ago,<br/>
🎧 <span>Aborigines</span> would have <span>rarely</span> <span>eaten</span> <span>fish<br/></span>
🎧 and sea <span>levels</span> were much <span>lower</span> at this time.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, <span>fish</span> didn't start to <span>appear</span> in <span>paintings</span> until the Yam <span>period<br/></span>
🎧 along with <span>shells</span> and other <span>marine</span> <span>images</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>paintings</span> of the Yam <span>tradition</span> also <span>suggest</span> that, during this time,<br/>
🎧 the <span>Aborigines</span> <span>moved</span> away from <span>animals</span> as their <span>main</span> food <span>source<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>began</span> <span>including</span> <span>vegetables</span> in their <span>diet</span>, as these <span>feature</span> <span>prominently</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Freshwater</span> <span>creatures</span> didn't <span>appear</span> in the <span>paintings</span> until the <span>Modern</span> <span>period</span> from <span>4,000</span> years ago.<br/>
🎧 So, these <span>paintings</span> have already <span>taught</span> us a lot.<br/>
🎧 But one <span>image</span> that has always <span>intrigued</span> us is <span>known</span> as the <span>'Rainbow</span> <span>Serpent'</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Rainbow</span> <span>Serpent</span>, which is the focus of my most <span>recent</span> <span>project</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>gets</span> its name from its <span>snake</span> or <span>serpent-like</span> <span>body<br/></span>
🎧 and it first <span>appeared</span> in the Yam <span>period</span> <span>4</span> to <span>6,000</span> years ago.<br/>
🎧 Many <span>believe</span> it is a <span>curious</span> <span>mixture</span> of <span>kangaroo</span>, <span>snake</span> and <span>crocodile</span>.<br/>
🎧 But we <span>decided</span> to <span>study</span> the <span>Rainbow</span> <span>Serpent</span> <span>paintings<br/></span>
🎧 to see if we could <span>locate</span> the <span>animal</span> that the very first <span>painters</span> <span>based</span> their <span>image</span> on.<br/>
🎧 The Yam <span>period</span> <span>coincided</span> with the end of the last ice age.<br/>
🎧 This <span>brought</span> about <span>tremendous</span> change in the <span>environment</span>,<br/>
🎧 with the sea <span>levels</span> <span>rising</span> and <span>creeping</span> <span>steadily</span> <span>inland</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>flooded</span> many <span>familiar</span> <span>land</span> <span>features<br/></span>
🎧 and also <span>caused</span> a great <span>deal</span> of <span>disruption</span> to <span>traditional</span> <span>patterns</span> of life,<br/>
🎧 <span>hunting</span> in <span>particular</span>.<br/>
🎧 New <span>shores</span> were <span>formed</span> and <span>totally</span> different <span>creatures</span> would have <span>washed</span> up <span>onto</span> the <span>shores</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>studied</span> <span>107</span> <span>paintings</span> of the <span>Rainbow</span> <span>Serpent<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>found</span> that the one <span>creature</span> that <span>matches</span> it most <span>closely</span> was the <span>Ribboned</span> <span>Pipefish</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is a <span>type</span> of sea <span>horse</span>.<br/>
🎧 This sea <span>creature</span> would have been a <span>totally</span> <span>unfamiliar</span> <span>sight</span> in the <span>inland</span> <span>regions</span> where the <span>image</span> is <span>found<br/></span>
🎧 and may have been the <span>inspiration</span> behind the <span>early</span> <span>paintings</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, at the end of the ice age, there would have been <span>enormous</span> changes in <span>animal</span> and <span>plant</span> life.<br/>
🎧 It's not <span>surprising</span> then, that the <span>Aborigines</span> <span>linked</span> this <span>abundance</span> to the new <span>creatures</span> they <span>witnessed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Even today, <span>Aborigines</span> see the <span>Rainbow</span> <span>Serpent</span> as a <span>symbol</span> of <span>creation</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is <span>understandable</span> <span>given</span> the <span>increase</span> in <span>vegetation</span> and the new life <span>forms</span> that <span>featured</span> when the <span>image</span> first <span>appeared</span>.<br/>
