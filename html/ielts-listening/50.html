🎧 Good morning. You're through to the <span>tourist</span> <span>information</span> <span>office</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Tim</span> <span>speaking</span>. How can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Oh hello.<br/>
🎧 Could you give me some <span>information</span> about next <span>month's</span> <span>festival</span>, please?<br/>
🎧 My <span>family</span> and I will be <span>staying</span> in the <span>town</span> that week.<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 Well, it <span>starts</span> with a <span>concert</span> on the <span>afternoon</span> of the <span>17th</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh I heard about that.<br/>
🎧 The <span>orchestra</span> and <span>singers</span> come from the <span>USA</span>, don't they?<br/>
🎧 They're from <span>Canada</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're very <span>popular</span> over there.<br/>
🎧 They're going to <span>perform</span> a number of <span>well-known</span> <span>pieces</span> that will <span>appeal</span> to children as well as <span>adults</span>.<br/>
🎧 That sounds good.<br/>
🎧 My whole <span>family</span> are interested in music.<br/>
🎧 The next day, the <span>18th</span>,<br/>
🎧 there's a <span>performance</span> by a <span>ballet</span> company called <span>Eustatis</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sorry?<br/>
🎧 The name is <span>spelt</span> <span>E-U-S-T-A-T-I-S</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>appeared</span> in last <span>year's</span> <span>festival</span>, and went down very well.<br/>
🎧 Again, their <span>programme</span> is <span>designed</span> for all <span>ages</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 I <span>expect</span> we'll go to that.<br/>
🎧 I hope there's going to be a play during the <span>festival</span>, a <span>comedy</span>, <span>ideally</span>.<br/>
🎧 You're in <span>luck</span>!<br/>
🎧 On the <span>19th</span> and <span>20th</span> a <span>local</span> <span>amateur</span> group are <span>performing</span> one <span>written</span> by a <span>member</span> of the group.<br/>
🎧 It's called <span>Jemima</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>That'll</span> be on in the <span>town</span> <span>hall</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>They've</span> already <span>performed</span> it two or <span>three</span> <span>times</span>.<br/>
🎧 I haven't <span>seen</span> it myself,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>review</span> in the <span>local</span> <span>paper</span> was very good.<br/>
🎧 And is it <span>suitable</span> for children?<br/>
🎧 Yes, in <span>fact</span> it's <span>aimed</span> more at children than at <span>adults</span>,<br/>
🎧 so both <span>performances</span> are in the <span>afternoon</span>.<br/>
🎧 And what about <span>dance</span>?<br/>
🎧 Will there be any <span>performances</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, also on the <span>20th</span>, but in the <span>evening</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>professional</span> company is <span>putting</span> on a show of <span>modern</span> <span>pieces</span>,<br/>
🎧 with <span>electronic</span> music by young <span>composers</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Uh-huh</span>.<br/>
🎧 The show is about how people <span>communicate</span>, or <span>fail</span> to <span>communicate</span>, with each other,<br/>
🎧 so it's got the rather <span>strange</span> name, <span>Chat</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> that's because that's something we do both <span>face</span> to <span>face</span> and online.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 Now there are also some <span>workshops</span> and other <span>activities</span>.<br/>
🎧 They'll all take place at <span>least</span> once every day,<br/>
🎧 so everyone who <span>wants</span> to take <span>part</span> will have a <span>chance</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 We're <span>particularly</span> interested in <span>cookery</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 you don't <span>happen</span> to have a <span>cookery</span> <span>workshop</span>, do you?<br/>
🎧 We <span>certainly</span> do.<br/>
🎧 It's going to focus on how to make food <span>part</span> of a <span>healthy</span> <span>lifestyle</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it'll show that even <span>sweet</span> things like <span>cakes</span> can <span>contain</span> much less <span>sugar</span> than they usually do.<br/>
🎧 That might be <span>worth</span> going to.<br/>
🎧 We're trying to <span>encourage</span> our children to <span>cook</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>workshop</span> is just for children,<br/>
🎧 and that's on <span>creating</span> <span>posters</span> to <span>reflect</span> the <span>history</span> of the <span>town</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>aim</span> is to make children <span>aware</span> of how both the <span>town</span> and <span>people's</span> lives have <span>changed</span> over the <span>centuries</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>results</span> will be <span>exhibited</span> in the <span>community</span> <span>centre</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then the other <span>workshop</span> is in <span>toy-making</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that's for <span>adults</span> only.<br/>
🎧 Oh, why's that?<br/>
🎧 Because it <span>involves</span> <span>carpentry</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>participants</span> will be <span>making</span> <span>toys</span> out of <span>wood</span>,<br/>
🎧 so <span>there'll</span> be a lot of <span>sharp</span> <span>chisels</span> and other <span>tools</span> around.<br/>
🎧 It makes <span>sense</span> to keep children away from it.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 Now let me tell you about some of the <span>outdoor</span> <span>activities</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>There'll</span> be <span>supervised</span> <span>wild</span> <span>swimming…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Wild</span> <span>swimming</span>?<br/>
🎧 What's that?<br/>
🎧 It just <span>means</span> <span>swimming</span> in <span>natural</span> <span>waters</span>, rather than a <span>swimming</span> <span>pool</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh OK.<br/>
🎧 In a <span>lake</span>, for <span>instance</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, there's a <span>beautiful</span> one just outside the <span>town</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>that'll</span> be the <span>venue</span> for the <span>swimming</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>There'll</span> be <span>lifeguards</span> on <span>duty</span>, so it's <span>suitable</span> for all <span>ages</span>.<br/>
🎧 And finally, <span>there'll</span> be a <span>walk</span> in some <span>nearby</span> <span>woods</span> every day.<br/>
🎧 The <span>leader</span> is an <span>expert</span> on <span>insects</span>.<br/>
🎧 He'll show some that live in the <span>woods</span>, and how important they are for the <span>environment</span>.<br/>
🎧 So there are going to be all <span>sorts</span> of different things to do during the <span>festival</span>.<br/>
🎧 There <span>certainly</span> are.<br/>
🎧 If you'd like to read about how the <span>preparations</span> for the <span>festival</span> are going,<br/>
🎧 the <span>festival</span> <span>organizer</span> is <span>keeping</span> a <span>blog</span>.<br/>
🎧 Just <span>search</span> online for the <span>festival</span> <span>website</span>, and you'll find it.<br/>
🎧 Well, thank you very much for all the <span>information</span>.<br/>
🎧 You're <span>welcome</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Goodbye</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Goodbye</span>.<br/>

🎧 I'm very <span>pleased</span> to <span>welcome</span> this <span>evening's</span> <span>guest</span> <span>speaker</span>, <span>Mark</span> <span>Logan</span>,<br/>
🎧 who's going to tell us about the <span>recent</span> <span>transformation</span> of <span>Minster</span> <span>Park</span>.<br/>
🎧 Over to you, <span>Mark</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you're all <span>familiar</span> with <span>Minster</span> <span>Park</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's been a <span>feature</span> of the <span>city</span> for well over a <span>century</span>,<br/>
🎧 and has been the <span>responsibility</span> of the <span>city</span> <span>council</span> for most of that time.<br/>
🎧 What <span>perhaps</span> isn't so well <span>known</span> is the <span>origin</span> of the <span>park</span>:<br/>
🎧 <span>unlike</span> many <span>public</span> <span>parks</span> that <span>started</span> in <span>private</span> <span>ownership</span>,<br/>
🎧 as the garden of a large house, for <span>instance</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>Minster</span> was some <span>waste</span> <span>land</span>,<br/>
🎧 which people living <span>nearby</span> <span>started</span> <span>planting</span> with <span>flowers</span> in <span>1892</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>unclear</span> who actually <span>owned</span> the <span>land</span>,<br/>
🎧 and this wasn't <span>settled</span> until <span>20</span> years later,<br/>
🎧 when the <span>council</span> took <span>possession</span> of it.<br/>
🎧 You may have <span>noticed</span> the <span>statue</span> near one of the <span>entrances</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's of <span>Diane</span> <span>Gosforth</span>,<br/>
🎧 who <span>played</span> a key <span>role</span> in the <span>history</span> of the <span>park</span>.<br/>
🎧 Once the <span>council</span> had become the <span>legal</span> <span>owner</span>,<br/>
🎧 it <span>planned</span> to sell the <span>land</span> for <span>housing</span>.<br/>
🎧 Many <span>local</span> people wanted it to <span>remain</span> a place that everyone could go to,<br/>
🎧 to enjoy the <span>fresh</span> air and <span>natural</span> <span>environment</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 remember, the <span>park</span> is in a <span>densely</span> <span>populated</span> <span>residential</span> <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Diane</span> <span>Gosforth</span> was one of those people,<br/>
🎧 and she <span>organised</span> <span>petitions</span> and <span>demonstrations</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>eventually</span> made the <span>council</span> change its <span>mind</span> about the future of the <span>land</span>.<br/>
🎧 Soon after this the First <span>World</span> War <span>broke</span> out, in <span>1914</span>,<br/>
🎧 and most of the <span>park</span> was <span>dug</span> up and <span>planted</span> with <span>vegetables</span>,<br/>
🎧 which were <span>sold</span> <span>locally</span>.<br/>
🎧 At one <span>stage</span>, the <span>army</span> <span>considered</span> taking it over for <span>troop</span> <span>exercises<br/></span>
🎧 and got as <span>far</span> as <span>contacting</span> the <span>city</span> <span>council</span>,<br/>
🎧 then <span>decided</span> the <span>park</span> was too small to be of use.<br/>
🎧 There were <span>occasional</span> <span>public</span> <span>meetings</span> during the war,<br/>
🎧 in an <span>area</span> that had been <span>retained</span> as <span>grass</span>.<br/>
🎧 After the war, the <span>park</span> was <span>turned</span> back more or less to how it had been before <span>1914</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>continued</span> almost <span>unchanged</span> until <span>recently</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Plans</span> for <span>transforming</span> it were <span>drawn</span> up at <span>various</span> <span>times</span>,<br/>
🎧 most <span>recently</span> in <span>2013</span>,<br/>
🎧 though they were <span>revised</span> in <span>2015</span>,<br/>
🎧 before any work had <span>started</span>.<br/>
🎧 The changes finally got going in <span>2016</span>,<br/>
🎧 and were <span>finished</span> on <span>schedule</span> last year.<br/>
🎧 OK, let me tell you about some of the changes that have been <span>made<br/></span>
🎧 and some things that have been <span>retained</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you look at this map,<br/>
🎧 you'll see the <span>familiar</span> <span>outline</span> of the <span>park</span>,<br/>
🎧 with the <span>river</span> <span>forming</span> the <span>northern</span> <span>boundary</span>,<br/>
🎧 and a <span>gate</span> in each of the other <span>three</span> <span>walls</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>statue</span> of <span>Diane</span> <span>Gosforth</span> has been <span>moved</span>:<br/>
🎧 it used to be <span>close</span> to the <span>south</span> <span>gate</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it's now <span>immediately</span> to the <span>north</span> of the <span>lily</span> <span>pond</span>,<br/>
🎧 almost in the <span>centre</span> of the <span>park</span>, which makes it much more <span>visible</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's a new <span>area</span> of <span>wooden</span> <span>sculptures</span>, which are on the <span>river</span> <span>bank</span>,<br/>
🎧 where the <span>path</span> from the <span>east</span> <span>gate</span> makes a <span>sharp</span> <span>bend</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are two <span>areas</span> that are <span>particularly</span> <span>intended</span> for children.<br/>
🎧 The <span>playground</span> has been <span>enlarged</span> and <span>improved</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that's between the <span>river</span> and the <span>path</span> that <span>leads</span> from the <span>pond</span> to the <span>river</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then there's a new <span>maze</span>, a <span>circular</span> <span>series</span> of <span>paths</span>, <span>separated</span> by low <span>hedges</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's near the <span>west</span> <span>gate</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 you go <span>north</span> from there <span>towards</span> the <span>river</span> and then <span>turn</span> <span>left</span> to <span>reach</span> it.<br/>
🎧 There have been <span>tennis</span> <span>courts</span> in the <span>park</span> for many years,<br/>
🎧 and <span>they've</span> been <span>doubled</span>, from <span>four</span> to <span>eight</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're still in the <span>south-west</span> <span>corner</span> of the <span>park</span>,<br/>
🎧 where there's a <span>right-angle</span> <span>bend</span> in the <span>path</span>.<br/>
🎧 Something else I'd like to <span>mention</span> is the new <span>fitness</span> <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is right next to the <span>lily</span> <span>pond</span> on the same side as the <span>west</span> <span>gate</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, as you're all <span>gardeners</span>,<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you'll like to hear about the <span>plants</span> that have been <span>chosen</span> for the <span>park</span>.<br/>
<br />

🎧 OK, <span>Graham</span>, so let's check we both know what we're <span>supposed</span> to be doing.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So, for the <span>university's</span> open day,<br/>
🎧 we have to plan a <span>display</span> on <span>British</span> life and <span>literature</span> in the <span>mid-19th</span> <span>century</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 But we'll have some people to help us find the <span>materials</span> and set it up, remember.<br/>
🎧 For the <span>moment</span>, we just need to plan it.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 So have you <span>gathered</span> who's <span>expected</span> to come and see the <span>display</span>?<br/>
🎧 Is it for the people <span>studying</span> English, or students from other <span>departments</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm not <span>clear</span> about it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Nor</span> me.<br/>
🎧 That was how it used to be,<br/>
🎧 but it didn't <span>attract</span> many people, so this year it's going to be <span>part</span> of an open day,<br/>
🎧 to <span>raise</span> the <span>university's</span> <span>profile</span>.<br/>
🎧 It'll be <span>publicised</span> in the <span>city</span>, to <span>encourage</span> people to come and find out something of what <span>goes</span> on here.<br/>
🎧 And it's <span>included</span> in the <span>information</span> that's <span>sent</span> to people who are <span>considering</span> <span>applying</span> to <span>study</span> here next year.<br/>
🎧 <span>Presumably</span> some <span>current</span> students and <span>lecturers</span> will come?<br/>
🎧 I would <span>imagine</span> so,<br/>
🎧 but we've been told to <span>concentrate</span> on the other <span>categories</span> of people.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 We don't have to <span>cover</span> the whole <span>range</span> of <span>19th-century</span> <span>literature</span>, do we?<br/>
🎧 No, it's <span>entirely</span> up to us.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suggest</span> just <span>using</span> <span>Charles</span> <span>Dickens</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's a good idea.<br/>
🎧 Most people have heard of him, and have probably read some of his <span>novels</span>,<br/>
🎧 or <span>seen</span> <span>films</span> <span>based</span> on them,<br/>
🎧 so that's a good <span>lead-in</span> to life in his time.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 And his <span>novels</span> show the <span>awful</span> <span>conditions</span> that most people had to live in, don't they:<br/>
🎧 he wanted to <span>shock</span> people into doing something about it.<br/>
🎧 Did he do any <span>campaigning</span>, other than <span>writing</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, he <span>campaigned</span> for <span>education</span> and other <span>social</span> <span>reforms</span>, and gave <span>talks</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I'm <span>inclined</span> to <span>ignore</span> that and focus on the <span>novels</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I agree.<br/>
🎧 OK, so now shall we think about a <span>topic</span> <span>linked</span> to each <span>novel</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes. I've <span>printed</span> out a <span>list</span> of <span>Dickens's</span> <span>novels</span> in the order they were <span>published</span>,<br/>
🎧 in the hope you'd agree to focus on him!<br/>
🎧 You're <span>lucky</span> I did agree!<br/>
🎧 Let's have a look.<br/>
🎧 OK, the first was The <span>Pickwick</span> <span>Papers</span>, <span>published</span> in <span>1836</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was very <span>successful</span> when it came out, wasn't it,<br/>
🎧 and was <span>adapted</span> for the <span>theatre</span> <span>straight</span> away.<br/>
🎧 There's an <span>interesting</span> <span>point</span>, though,<br/>
🎧 that there's a <span>character</span> who <span>keeps</span> <span>falling</span> <span>asleep</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that <span>medical</span> <span>condition</span> was <span>named</span> after the book <span>-</span> <span>Pickwickian</span> <span>Syndrome</span>.<br/>
🎧 So why don't we use that as the <span>topic</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>include</span> some <span>quotations</span> from the <span>novel</span>?<br/>
🎧 Right, Next is <span>Oliver</span> <span>Twist</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's a lot in the <span>novel</span> about <span>poverty</span>.<br/>
🎧 But maybe something less <span>obvious…<br/></span>
🎧 Well <span>Oliver</span> is <span>taught</span> how to <span>steal</span>, isn't he?<br/>
🎧 We could use that to <span>illustrate</span> the <span>fact</span> that very few children went to school,<br/>
🎧 <span>particularly</span> not <span>poor</span> children, so they <span>learnt</span> in other <span>ways</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good idea.<br/>
🎧 What's next?<br/>
🎧 Maybe <span>Nicholas</span> <span>Nickleby</span>.<br/>
🎧 Actually he <span>taught</span> in a really <span>cruel</span> school, didn't he?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 But there's also the company of <span>touring</span> <span>actors</span> that <span>Nicholas</span> <span>joins</span>.<br/>
🎧 We could do something on <span>theatres</span> and other <span>amusements</span> of the time.<br/>
🎧 We don't want only the bad things, do we?<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 What about <span>Martin</span> <span>Chuzzlewit</span>?<br/>
🎧 He <span>goes</span> to the <span>USA</span>, doesn't he?<br/>
🎧 Yes, and <span>Dickens</span> <span>himself</span> had been there a year before,<br/>
🎧 and <span>drew</span> on his <span>experience</span> there in the <span>novel</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>wonder</span>, <span>though…<br/></span>
🎧 The <span>main</span> <span>theme</span> is <span>selfishness</span>,<br/>
🎧 so we could do something on <span>social</span> <span>justice</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm..</span>. No, too <span>general</span>, let's keep to your idea.<br/>
🎧 I think it would work well.<br/>
🎧 He <span>wrote</span> <span>Bleak</span> House next <span>-</span> that's my <span>favourite</span> of his <span>novels</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>mine</span> too.<br/>
🎧 His <span>satire</span> of the <span>legal</span> <span>system</span> is <span>pretty</span> <span>powerful</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>true</span>, but think about <span>Esther</span>, the <span>heroine</span>.<br/>
🎧 As a <span>child</span> she lives with <span>someone</span> she doesn't know is her <span>aunt</span>,<br/>
🎧 who <span>treats</span> her very <span>badly</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then she's very happy living with her <span>guardian</span>,<br/>
🎧 and he <span>puts</span> her in <span>charge</span> of the <span>household</span>.<br/>
🎧 And at the end she <span>gets</span> <span>married</span> and her <span>guardian</span> <span>gives</span> her and her <span>husband</span> a house,<br/>
🎧 where of course they're very happy.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I like that.<br/>
🎧 What shall we take next?<br/>
🎧 Little <span>Dorrit</span>?<br/>
🎧 Old Mr <span>Dorrit</span> has been in a <span>debtors'</span> <span>prison</span> for <span>years…<br/></span>
🎧 So was <span>Dickens's</span> <span>father</span>, wasn't he?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 What about <span>focusing</span> on the <span>part</span> when Mr <span>Dorrit</span> <span>inherits</span> a <span>fortune</span>,<br/>
🎧 and he <span>starts</span> <span>pretending</span> he's always been <span>rich</span>?<br/>
🎧 Good idea.<br/>
🎧 So, next, we need to think about what <span>materials</span> we want to <span>illustrate</span> each issue.<br/>
🎧 That's going to be quite <span>hard</span>.<br/>

🎧 I'm going to <span>report</span> on a case <span>study</span> of a <span>programme<br/></span>
🎧 which has been set up to help <span>rural</span> <span>populations</span> in <span>Mozambique</span>,<br/>
🎧 a <span>largely</span> <span>agricultural</span> <span>country</span> in <span>South-East</span> <span>Africa</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>programme</span> <span>worked</span> with <span>three</span> <span>communities</span> in <span>Chicualacuala</span> <span>district</span>,<br/>
🎧 near the <span>Limpopo</span> <span>River</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is a dry and <span>arid</span> <span>region</span>, with <span>unpredictable</span> <span>rainfall</span>.<br/>
🎧 Because of this, people in the <span>area</span> were <span>unable</span> to <span>support</span> <span>themselves</span> through <span>agriculture<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>instead</span> they used the <span>forest</span> as a <span>means</span> of <span>providing</span> <span>themselves</span> with an <span>income</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>mainly</span> by <span>selling</span> <span>charcoal</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, this was not a <span>sustainable</span> way of living in the long <span>term</span>,<br/>
🎧 as they were <span>rapidly</span> <span>using</span> up this <span>resource</span>.<br/>
🎧 To <span>support</span> <span>agriculture</span> in this dry <span>region</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>programme</span> <span>focused</span> <span>primarily</span> on <span>making</span> use of <span>existing</span> water <span>resources</span> from the <span>Limpopo</span> <span>River<br/></span>
🎧 by <span>setting</span> up <span>systems</span> of <span>irrigation</span>,<br/>
🎧 which would <span>provide</span> a <span>dependable</span> water <span>supply</span> for <span>crops</span> and <span>animals</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>programme</span> <span>worked</span> <span>closely</span> with the <span>district</span> <span>government</span> in order to find the best way of <span>implementing</span> this.<br/>
🎧 The <span>region</span> already had one <span>farmers'</span> <span>association</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it was <span>decided</span> to set up two more of these.<br/>
🎧 These <span>associations</span> <span>planned</span> and <span>carried</span> out <span>activities</span> <span>including</span> water <span>management</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>livestock</span> <span>breeding</span> and <span>agriculture</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it was <span>notable</span> that in <span>general</span>, <span>women</span> <span>formed</span> the <span>majority</span> of the <span>workforce</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>decided</span> that in order to keep the <span>crops</span> <span>safe</span> from <span>animals</span>, both <span>wild</span> and <span>domestic</span>,<br/>
🎧 special <span>areas</span> should be <span>fenced</span> off where the <span>crops</span> could be <span>grown</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>community</span> was <span>responsible</span> for <span>creating</span> these <span>fences</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>programme</span> <span>provided</span> the <span>necessary</span> <span>wire</span> for <span>making</span> them.<br/>
🎧 Once the <span>area</span> had been <span>fenced</span> off, it could be <span>cultivated</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>land</span> was <span>dug</span>, so that <span>vegetables</span> and <span>cereals</span> <span>appropriate</span> to the <span>climate</span> could be <span>grown</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>programme</span> <span>provided</span> the <span>necessary</span> <span>seeds</span> for this.<br/>
🎧 The <span>programme</span> also <span>provided</span> <span>pumps</span> so that water could be <span>brought</span> from the <span>river</span> in <span>pipes</span> to the <span>fields</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, the <span>labour</span> was all <span>provided</span> by <span>local</span> people,<br/>
🎧 and they also <span>provided</span> and put up the <span>posts</span> that <span>supported</span> the <span>fences</span> around the <span>fields</span>.<br/>
🎧 Once the <span>programme</span> had been set up,<br/>
🎧 its <span>development</span> was <span>monitored</span> <span>carefully</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>farmers</span> were able to <span>grow</span> enough <span>produce<br/></span>
🎧 not just for their own needs, but also to sell.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, getting the <span>produce</span> to <span>places</span> where it could be <span>marketed</span> was sometimes a <span>problem</span>,<br/>
🎧 as the <span>farmers</span> did not have <span>access</span> to <span>transport</span>,<br/>
🎧 and this <span>resulted</span> in large <span>amounts</span> of <span>produce</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>especially</span> <span>vegetables</span>, being <span>spoiled</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>problem</span> was <span>discussed</span> with the <span>farmers'</span> <span>associations<br/></span>
🎧 and it was <span>decided</span> that in order to <span>prevent</span> food from being <span>spoiled</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>farmers</span> <span>needed</span> to learn <span>techniques</span> for its <span>preservation</span>.<br/>
🎧 There was also an <span>additional</span> <span>initiative</span> that had not been <span>originally</span> <span>planned</span>,<br/>
🎧 but which <span>became</span> a <span>central</span> <span>feature</span> of the <span>programme</span>.<br/>
🎧 This was when <span>farmers</span> <span>started</span> to <span>dig</span> <span>holes</span> for <span>tanks</span> in the <span>fenced-off</span> <span>areas<br/></span>
🎧 and to <span>fill</span> these with water and use them for <span>breeding</span> <span>fish</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 an important <span>source</span> of <span>protein</span>.<br/>
🎧 After a time, another <span>suggestion</span> was made by <span>local</span> <span>people<br/></span>
🎧 which hadn't been <span>part</span> of the <span>programme's</span> <span>original</span> <span>proposal</span>,<br/>
🎧 but which was also <span>adopted</span> later on.<br/>
🎧 They <span>decided</span> to try <span>setting</span> up <span>colonies</span> of <span>bees</span>,<br/>
🎧 which would <span>provide</span> <span>honey</span> both for their own <span>consumption</span> and to sell.<br/>
🎧 So what <span>lessons</span> can be <span>learned</span> from this <span>programme</span>?<br/>
🎧 First of all, it tells us that in dry, <span>arid</span> <span>regions</span>,<br/>
🎧 if there is <span>access</span> to a <span>reliable</span> <span>source</span> of water,<br/>
🎧 there is great <span>potential</span> for the <span>development</span> of <span>agriculture</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>Chicualacuala</span>, there was a <span>marked</span> <span>improvement</span> in <span>agricultural</span> <span>production</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>improved</span> food <span>security<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>benefited</span> <span>local</span> people by <span>providing</span> them with both food and <span>income</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, it's important to set <span>realistic</span> <span>timelines</span> for each <span>phase</span> of the <span>programme</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>especially</span> for its <span>design</span>,<br/>
🎧 as <span>mistakes</span> made at this <span>stage</span> may be <span>hard</span> to <span>correct</span> later on.<br/>
🎧 The <span>programme</span> <span>demonstrates</span> that <span>sustainable</span> <span>development</span> is <span>possible</span> in <span>areas</span> <span>where…<br/>
