🎧 Good morning. You're through to the tourist information office.<br/>
🎧 Tim speaking. How can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Oh hello.<br/>
🎧 Could you give me some information about next month's festival, please?<br/>
🎧 My family and I will be staying in the town that week.<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 Well, it starts with a concert on the afternoon of the 17th.<br/>
🎧 Oh I heard about that.<br/>
🎧 The orchestra and singers come from the USA, don't they?<br/>
🎧 They're from Canada.<br/>
🎧 They're very popular over there.<br/>
🎧 They're going to perform a number of well-known pieces that will appeal to children as well as adults.<br/>
🎧 That sounds good.<br/>
🎧 My whole family are interested in music.<br/>
🎧 The next day, the 18th,<br/>
🎧 there's a performance by a ballet company called Eustatis.<br/>
🎧 Sorry?<br/>
🎧 The name is spelt E-U-S-T-A-T-I-S.<br/>
🎧 They appeared in last year's festival, and went down very well.<br/>
🎧 Again, their programme is designed for all ages.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 I expect we'll go to that.<br/>
🎧 I hope there's going to be a play during the festival, a comedy, ideally.<br/>
🎧 You're in luck!<br/>
🎧 On the 19th and 20th a local amateur group are performing one written by a member of the group.<br/>
🎧 It's called Jemima.<br/>
🎧 That'll be on in the town hall.<br/>
🎧 They've already performed it two or three times.<br/>
🎧 I haven't seen it myself,<br/>
🎧 but the review in the local paper was very good.<br/>
🎧 And is it suitable for children?<br/>
🎧 Yes, in fact it's aimed more at children than at adults,<br/>
🎧 so both performances are in the afternoon.<br/>
🎧 And what about dance?<br/>
🎧 Will there be any performances?<br/>
🎧 Yes, also on the 20th, but in the evening.<br/>
🎧 A professional company is putting on a show of modern pieces,<br/>
🎧 with electronic music by young composers.<br/>
🎧 Uh-huh.<br/>
🎧 The show is about how people communicate, or fail to communicate, with each other,<br/>
🎧 so it's got the rather strange name, Chat.<br/>
🎧 I suppose that's because that's something we do both face to face and online.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 Now there are also some workshops and other activities.<br/>
🎧 They'll all take place at least once every day,<br/>
🎧 so everyone who wants to take part will have a chance.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 We're particularly interested in cookery -<br/>
🎧 you don't happen to have a cookery workshop, do you?<br/>
🎧 We certainly do.<br/>
🎧 It's going to focus on how to make food part of a healthy lifestyle,<br/>
🎧 and it'll show that even sweet things like cakes can contain much less sugar than they usually do.<br/>
🎧 That might be worth going to.<br/>
🎧 We're trying to encourage our children to cook.<br/>
🎧 Another workshop is just for children,<br/>
🎧 and that's on creating posters to reflect the history of the town.<br/>
🎧 The aim is to make children aware of how both the town and people's lives have changed over the centuries.<br/>
🎧 The results will be exhibited in the community centre.<br/>
🎧 Then the other workshop is in toy-making,<br/>
🎧 and that's for adults only.<br/>
🎧 Oh, why's that?<br/>
🎧 Because it involves carpentry -<br/>
🎧 participants will be making toys out of wood,<br/>
🎧 so there'll be a lot of sharp chisels and other tools around.<br/>
🎧 It makes sense to keep children away from it.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 Now let me tell you about some of the outdoor activities.<br/>
🎧 There'll be supervised wild swimming…<br/>
🎧 Wild swimming?<br/>
🎧 What's that?<br/>
🎧 It just means swimming in natural waters, rather than a swimming pool.<br/>
🎧 Oh OK.<br/>
🎧 In a lake, for instance.<br/>
🎧 Yes, there's a beautiful one just outside the town,<br/>
🎧 and that'll be the venue for the swimming.<br/>
🎧 There'll be lifeguards on duty, so it's suitable for all ages.<br/>
🎧 And finally, there'll be a walk in some nearby woods every day.<br/>
🎧 The leader is an expert on insects.<br/>
🎧 He'll show some that live in the woods, and how important they are for the environment.<br/>
🎧 So there are going to be all sorts of different things to do during the festival.<br/>
🎧 There certainly are.<br/>
🎧 If you'd like to read about how the preparations for the festival are going,<br/>
🎧 the festival organizer is keeping a blog.<br/>
🎧 Just search online for the festival website, and you'll find it.<br/>
🎧 Well, thank you very much for all the information.<br/>
🎧 You're welcome.<br/>
🎧 Goodbye.<br/>
🎧 Goodbye.<br/>
<br />

🎧 I'm very pleased to welcome this evening's guest speaker, Mark Logan,<br/>
🎧 who's going to tell us about the recent transformation of Minster Park.<br/>
🎧 Over to you, Mark.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you're all familiar with Minster Park.<br/>
🎧 It's been a feature of the city for well over a century,<br/>
🎧 and has been the responsibility of the city council for most of that time.<br/>
🎧 What perhaps isn't so well known is the origin of the park:<br/>
🎧 unlike many public parks that started in private ownership,<br/>
🎧 as the garden of a large house, for instance,<br/>
🎧 Minster was some waste land,<br/>
🎧 which people living nearby started planting with flowers in 1892.<br/>
🎧 It was unclear who actually owned the land,<br/>
🎧 and this wasn't settled until 20 years later,<br/>
🎧 when the council took possession of it.<br/>
🎧 You may have noticed the statue near one of the entrances.<br/>
🎧 It's of Diane Gosforth,<br/>
🎧 who played a key role in the history of the park.<br/>
🎧 Once the council had become the legal owner,<br/>
🎧 it planned to sell the land for housing.<br/>
🎧 Many local people wanted it to remain a place that everyone could go to,<br/>
🎧 to enjoy the fresh air and natural environment -<br/>
🎧 remember, the park is in a densely populated residential area.<br/>
🎧 Diane Gosforth was one of those people,<br/>
🎧 and she organised petitions and demonstrations,<br/>
🎧 which eventually made the council change its mind about the future of the land.<br/>
🎧 Soon after this the First World War broke out, in 1914,<br/>
🎧 and most of the park was dug up and planted with vegetables,<br/>
🎧 which were sold locally.<br/>
🎧 At one stage, the army considered taking it over for troop exercises<br/>
🎧 and got as far as contacting the city council,<br/>
🎧 then decided the park was too small to be of use.<br/>
🎧 There were occasional public meetings during the war,<br/>
🎧 in an area that had been retained as grass.<br/>
🎧 After the war, the park was turned back more or less to how it had been before 1914,<br/>
🎧 and continued almost unchanged until recently.<br/>
🎧 Plans for transforming it were drawn up at various times,<br/>
🎧 most recently in 2013,<br/>
🎧 though they were revised in 2015,<br/>
🎧 before any work had started.<br/>
🎧 The changes finally got going in 2016,<br/>
🎧 and were finished on schedule last year.<br/>
🎧 OK, let me tell you about some of the changes that have been made<br/>
🎧 and some things that have been retained.<br/>
🎧 If you look at this map,<br/>
🎧 you'll see the familiar outline of the park,<br/>
🎧 with the river forming the northern boundary,<br/>
🎧 and a gate in each of the other three walls.<br/>
🎧 The statue of Diane Gosforth has been moved:<br/>
🎧 it used to be close to the south gate,<br/>
🎧 but it's now immediately to the north of the lily pond,<br/>
🎧 almost in the centre of the park, which makes it much more visible.<br/>
🎧 There's a new area of wooden sculptures, which are on the river bank,<br/>
🎧 where the path from the east gate makes a sharp bend.<br/>
🎧 There are two areas that are particularly intended for children.<br/>
🎧 The playground has been enlarged and improved,<br/>
🎧 and that's between the river and the path that leads from the pond to the river.<br/>
🎧 Then there's a new maze, a circular series of paths, separated by low hedges.<br/>
🎧 That's near the west gate -<br/>
🎧 you go north from there towards the river and then turn left to reach it.<br/>
🎧 There have been tennis courts in the park for many years,<br/>
🎧 and they've been doubled, from four to eight.<br/>
🎧 They're still in the south-west corner of the park,<br/>
🎧 where there's a right-angle bend in the path.<br/>
🎧 Something else I'd like to mention is the new fitness area.<br/>
🎧 This is right next to the lily pond on the same side as the west gate.<br/>
🎧 Now, as you're all gardeners,<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you'll like to hear about the plants that have been chosen for the park.<br/>
<br />

🎧 OK, Graham, so let's check we both know what we're supposed to be doing.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So, for the university's open day,<br/>
🎧 we have to plan a display on British life and literature in the mid-19th century.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 But we'll have some people to help us find the materials and set it up, remember.<br/>
🎧 For the moment, we just need to plan it.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 So have you gathered who's expected to come and see the display?<br/>
🎧 Is it for the people studying English, or students from other departments?<br/>
🎧 I'm not clear about it.<br/>
🎧 Nor me.<br/>
🎧 That was how it used to be,<br/>
🎧 but it didn't attract many people, so this year it's going to be part of an open day,<br/>
🎧 to raise the university's profile.<br/>
🎧 It'll be publicised in the city, to encourage people to come and find out something of what goes on here.<br/>
🎧 And it's included in the information that's sent to people who are considering applying to study here next year.<br/>
🎧 Presumably some current students and lecturers will come?<br/>
🎧 I would imagine so,<br/>
🎧 but we've been told to concentrate on the other categories of people.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 We don't have to cover the whole range of 19th-century literature, do we?<br/>
🎧 No, it's entirely up to us.<br/>
🎧 I suggest just using Charles Dickens.<br/>
🎧 That's a good idea.<br/>
🎧 Most people have heard of him, and have probably read some of his novels,<br/>
🎧 or seen films based on them,<br/>
🎧 so that's a good lead-in to life in his time.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 And his novels show the awful conditions that most people had to live in, don't they:<br/>
🎧 he wanted to shock people into doing something about it.<br/>
🎧 Did he do any campaigning, other than writing?<br/>
🎧 Yes, he campaigned for education and other social reforms, and gave talks,<br/>
🎧 but I'm inclined to ignore that and focus on the novels.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I agree.<br/>
🎧 OK, so now shall we think about a topic linked to each novel?<br/>
🎧 Yes. I've printed out a list of Dickens's novels in the order they were published,<br/>
🎧 in the hope you'd agree to focus on him!<br/>
🎧 You're lucky I did agree!<br/>
🎧 Let's have a look.<br/>
🎧 OK, the first was The Pickwick Papers, published in 1836.<br/>
🎧 It was very successful when it came out, wasn't it,<br/>
🎧 and was adapted for the theatre straight away.<br/>
🎧 There's an interesting point, though,<br/>
🎧 that there's a character who keeps falling asleep,<br/>
🎧 and that medical condition was named after the book - Pickwickian Syndrome.<br/>
🎧 So why don't we use that as the topic,<br/>
🎧 and include some quotations from the novel?<br/>
🎧 Right, Next is Oliver Twist.<br/>
🎧 There's a lot in the novel about poverty.<br/>
🎧 But maybe something less obvious…<br/>
🎧 Well Oliver is taught how to steal, isn't he?<br/>
🎧 We could use that to illustrate the fact that very few children went to school,<br/>
🎧 particularly not poor children, so they learnt in other ways.<br/>
🎧 Good idea.<br/>
🎧 What's next?<br/>
🎧 Maybe Nicholas Nickleby.<br/>
🎧 Actually he taught in a really cruel school, didn't he?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 But there's also the company of touring actors that Nicholas joins.<br/>
🎧 We could do something on theatres and other amusements of the time.<br/>
🎧 We don't want only the bad things, do we?<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 What about Martin Chuzzlewit?<br/>
🎧 He goes to the USA, doesn't he?<br/>
🎧 Yes, and Dickens himself had been there a year before,<br/>
🎧 and drew on his experience there in the novel.<br/>
🎧 I wonder, though…<br/>
🎧 The main theme is selfishness,<br/>
🎧 so we could do something on social justice?<br/>
🎧 Hmm... No, too general, let's keep to your idea.<br/>
🎧 I think it would work well.<br/>
🎧 He wrote Bleak House next - that's my favourite of his novels.<br/>
🎧 It's mine too.<br/>
🎧 His satire of the legal system is pretty powerful.<br/>
🎧 That's true, but think about Esther, the heroine.<br/>
🎧 As a child she lives with someone she doesn't know is her aunt,<br/>
🎧 who treats her very badly.<br/>
🎧 Then she's very happy living with her guardian,<br/>
🎧 and he puts her in charge of the household.<br/>
🎧 And at the end she gets married and her guardian gives her and her husband a house,<br/>
🎧 where of course they're very happy.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I like that.<br/>
🎧 What shall we take next?<br/>
🎧 Little Dorrit?<br/>
🎧 Old Mr Dorrit has been in a debtors' prison for years…<br/>
🎧 So was Dickens's father, wasn't he?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 What about focusing on the part when Mr Dorrit inherits a fortune,<br/>
🎧 and he starts pretending he's always been rich?<br/>
🎧 Good idea.<br/>
🎧 So, next, we need to think about what materials we want to illustrate each issue.<br/>
🎧 That's going to be quite hard.<br/>
<br />

🎧 I'm going to report on a case study of a programme<br/>
🎧 which has been set up to help rural populations in Mozambique,<br/>
🎧 a largely agricultural country in South-East Africa.<br/>
🎧 The programme worked with three communities in Chicualacuala district,<br/>
🎧 near the Limpopo River.<br/>
🎧 This is a dry and arid region, with unpredictable rainfall.<br/>
🎧 Because of this, people in the area were unable to support themselves through agriculture<br/>
🎧 and instead they used the forest as a means of providing themselves with an income,<br/>
🎧 mainly by selling charcoal.<br/>
🎧 However, this was not a sustainable way of living in the long term,<br/>
🎧 as they were rapidly using up this resource.<br/>
🎧 To support agriculture in this dry region,<br/>
🎧 the programme focused primarily on making use of existing water resources from the Limpopo River<br/>
🎧 by setting up systems of irrigation,<br/>
🎧 which would provide a dependable water supply for crops and animals.<br/>
🎧 The programme worked closely with the district government in order to find the best way of implementing this.<br/>
🎧 The region already had one farmers' association,<br/>
🎧 and it was decided to set up two more of these.<br/>
🎧 These associations planned and carried out activities including water management,<br/>
🎧 livestock breeding and agriculture,<br/>
🎧 and it was notable that in general, women formed the majority of the workforce.<br/>
🎧 It was decided that in order to keep the crops safe from animals, both wild and domestic,<br/>
🎧 special areas should be fenced off where the crops could be grown.<br/>
🎧 The community was responsible for creating these fences,<br/>
🎧 but the programme provided the necessary wire for making them.<br/>
🎧 Once the area had been fenced off, it could be cultivated.<br/>
🎧 The land was dug, so that vegetables and cereals appropriate to the climate could be grown,<br/>
🎧 and the programme provided the necessary seeds for this.<br/>
🎧 The programme also provided pumps so that water could be brought from the river in pipes to the fields.<br/>
🎧 However, the labour was all provided by local people,<br/>
🎧 and they also provided and put up the posts that supported the fences around the fields.<br/>
🎧 Once the programme had been set up,<br/>
🎧 its development was monitored carefully.<br/>
🎧 The farmers were able to grow enough produce<br/>
🎧 not just for their own needs, but also to sell.<br/>
🎧 However, getting the produce to places where it could be marketed was sometimes a problem,<br/>
🎧 as the farmers did not have access to transport,<br/>
🎧 and this resulted in large amounts of produce,<br/>
🎧 especially vegetables, being spoiled.<br/>
🎧 This problem was discussed with the farmers' associations<br/>
🎧 and it was decided that in order to prevent food from being spoiled,<br/>
🎧 the farmers needed to learn techniques for its preservation.<br/>
🎧 There was also an additional initiative that had not been originally planned,<br/>
🎧 but which became a central feature of the programme.<br/>
🎧 This was when farmers started to dig holes for tanks in the fenced-off areas<br/>
🎧 and to fill these with water and use them for breeding fish -<br/>
🎧 an important source of protein.<br/>
🎧 After a time, another suggestion was made by local people<br/>
🎧 which hadn't been part of the programme's original proposal,<br/>
🎧 but which was also adopted later on.<br/>
🎧 They decided to try setting up colonies of bees,<br/>
🎧 which would provide honey both for their own consumption and to sell.<br/>
🎧 So what lessons can be learned from this programme?<br/>
🎧 First of all, it tells us that in dry, arid regions,<br/>
🎧 if there is access to a reliable source of water,<br/>
🎧 there is great potential for the development of agriculture.<br/>
🎧 In Chicualacuala, there was a marked improvement in agricultural production,<br/>
🎧 which improved food security<br/>
🎧 and benefited local people by providing them with both food and income.<br/>
🎧 However, it's important to set realistic timelines for each phase of the programme,<br/>
🎧 especially for its design,<br/>
🎧 as mistakes made at this stage may be hard to correct later on.<br/>
🎧 The programme demonstrates that sustainable development is possible in areas where…<br/>
<br/><br/>
