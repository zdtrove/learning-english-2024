🎧 Yes… it was Northern Star.<br/>
🎧 Thank you,<br/>
🎧 and have you made any insurance claims in the last five years?<br/>
🎧 Yes…<br/>
🎧 one in 1999.<br/>

🎧 Thank you for calling the Tourist Line.<br/>
🎧 There are many different ways of getting round the city<br/>
🎧 and we'd like to suggest some you may not have thought of.<br/>
🎧 How about a city trip by boat?<br/>
🎧 There are four main stopping points - from west to east:<br/>
🎧 stop A: Green Banks,<br/>
🎧 stop B: City Bridge,<br/>
🎧 stop C: Roman Landing<br/>
🎧 and stop D: Newtown.<br/>
🎧 You can find the main booking office at stop A.<br/>
🎧 The first boat leaves at 8 a.m.<br/>
🎧 and the last one at 6.30 p.m.<br/>
🎧 There are also many attractions you can visit along the river.<br/>
🎧 At Stop A, if you have time,<br/>
🎧 you can visit the fine 16th century palace here<br/>
🎧 built for the king with its beautiful formal gardens.<br/>
🎧 It's very near the booking office.<br/>
🎧 Now, you can enjoy every corner of this superb residence.<br/>
🎧 Stop B - Why don't you visit Tower Restaurant with its wide range of refreshments?<br/>
🎧 This is a place where you can sit and enjoy the wonderful views over the old commercial and banking centre of the city.<br/>
🎧 Stop C is the area where, in the first century AD, invading soldiers crossed the river;<br/>
🎧 this was much shallower than it is now.<br/>
🎧 That's why this area is called Roman Landing.<br/>
🎧 There's an interactive museum to visit here<br/>
🎧 with a large shop which has a good range of local history books.<br/>
🎧 At the furthest point of the trip, stop D,<br/>
🎧 the most exciting place to visit is the new Entertainment Complex<br/>
🎧 with seven-screen cinema, bowling alley and video games arcade.<br/>
🎧 Besides the boat tours, there are city buses.<br/>
🎧 Two companies offer special services:<br/>

🎧 We're pleased to welcome Dr Martin Merrywhether of the Antarctic Centre in Christchurch, New Zealand<br/>
🎧 who has come along to talk to us today about the role of the Centre and the Antarctic Treaty.<br/>
🎧 Now my first question is about the choice of location for the centre.<br/>
🎧 Why Christchurch? Was it because of the climate?<br/>
🎧 Well, actually, New Zealand is the second closest country to Antarctica<br/>
🎧 and Christchurch is often used on Antarctic expeditions.<br/>
🎧 Right, so it's because of where we are… coupled with our historical role.<br/>
🎧 So tell us - what is the main purpose of the centre?<br/>
🎧 Oh well… we have two complementary roles.<br/>
🎧 One is as a scientific base for expeditions and research<br/>
🎧 and the other is as an information centre.<br/>
🎧 Tell us something about the role as a scientific base.<br/>
🎧 We're able to provide information about what scientists should take with them to the South Pole -<br/>
🎧 for example, the centre contains a clothing warehouse<br/>
🎧 where expeditions are supplied with suitable clothing for the extreme conditions.<br/>
🎧 I suppose you need a bit more than your normal winter coat!<br/>
🎧 Yes, exactly<br/>
🎧 and then there's also the specialist library and mapping services.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And which countries are actually located at the centre?<br/>
🎧 Well… the centre houses research programmes for New Zealand,<br/>
🎧 for The United States as well as for Italy…<br/>
🎧 there's even a US post office at the American airforce base here.<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 And what does the visitor's centre offer?<br/>
🎧 Well, since very few people will ever experience the Antarctic first hand,<br/>
🎧 the visitors' centre aims to recreate the atmosphere of Antarctica.<br/>
🎧 There's a mock camp site where you can see inside an Antarctic tent and imagine yourself sleeping there.<br/>
🎧 And the centre also acts as a showcase for the unique international co-operation<br/>
🎧 which exists in Antarctica today.<br/>
🎧 What is it actually like at the South Pole?<br/>
🎧 I know you've been there on a number of occasions.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I have and each time I'm struck by the awesome beauty of the place.<br/>
🎧 It's magnificent<br/>
🎧 but you can really only visit it in the summer months.<br/>
🎧 October to March.<br/>
🎧 Yes, because it's completely dark for four months of the year…<br/>
🎧 and, in addition, it has to be the coldest place on earth.<br/>
🎧 Colder than the North Pole?<br/>
🎧 Why's that?<br/>
🎧 Well, unlike the North Pole, which is actually a frozen sea,<br/>
🎧 Antarctica is a land mass shaped like a dome,<br/>
🎧 with the result that the winds blow down the slopes at speeds of up to 150 km an hour<br/>
🎧 and that's what makes it so cold.<br/>
🎧 And one other interesting thing is that Antarctica is the driest continent on earth,<br/>
🎧 surprisingly, and so you have to drink large amounts of water when you're there.<br/>
🎧 How old is Antarctica?<br/>
🎧 Oh, we're pretty sure it was part of a larger land mass but it broke away from the rest of the continent...<br/>
🎧 170 million years ago.<br/>
🎧 How can you be certain of this?<br/>
🎧 Because fossils and rocks have been discovered in Antarctica<br/>
🎧 which are the same as those found in places such as Africa and Australia.<br/>
🎧 Amazing… to think that it was once attached to Africa…<br/>
🎧 Now let's just have a look at the Antarctic Treaty.<br/>
🎧 How far back does the idea of an international treaty go?<br/>
🎧 Well, as far back as the 19th century,<br/>
🎧 when 11 nations organised an international event.<br/>
🎧 When was that exactly?<br/>
🎧 In 1870.<br/>
🎧 And it was called the Polar Research Meeting.<br/>
🎧 And then, not long after that,<br/>
🎧 they organised something called the First International Polar Year.<br/>
🎧 And that took place when exactly?<br/>
🎧 Over two years from 1882 to 1883.<br/>
🎧 But it wasn't until the 1950s that the idea of an international treaty was proposed.<br/>
🎧 And in 1959, the Treaty was actually signed.<br/>
🎧 What do you see as the main achievements of the treaty?<br/>
🎧 Well, firstly, it means that the continent is reserved for peaceful use.<br/>
🎧 That's Article 1, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yes…<br/>
🎧 That's important since the territory belongs to everyone.<br/>
🎧 Yes but not as important as Article 5,<br/>
🎧 which prohibits any nuclear explosions or waste disposal.<br/>
🎧 Which is marvellous.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm afraid we're going to have to stop there because I'm afraid we've run out of time.<br/>
🎧 Thanks for coming along today and telling us all about the centre and its work.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 My topic is handedness -<br/>
🎧 whether in different sports it is better to be left or right-sided<br/>
🎧 or whether a more balanced approach is more successful.<br/>
🎧 I'm left-handed myself<br/>
🎧 and I actually didn't see any relevance to my own life<br/>
🎧 when I happened to start reading an article by a sports psychologist called Peter Matthews.<br/>
🎧 He spent the first part of the article talking about handedness in music instead of sport,<br/>
🎧 which I have to say almost put me off from reading further.<br/>
🎧 But what I soon became struck by<br/>
🎧 was the sheer volume of both observation and investigation he had done in many different sports<br/>
🎧 and I felt persuaded that what he had to say would be of real interest.<br/>
🎧 I think Matthews' findings will be beneficial,<br/>
🎧 not so much in helping sportspeople to work on their weaker side,<br/>
🎧 but more that they can help them identify the most suitable strategies to use in a given game.<br/>
🎧 Although most trainers know how important handedness is,<br/>
🎧 at present they are rather reluctant to make use of the insights scientists like Matthews can give,<br/>
🎧 which I think is rather short-sighted<br/>
🎧 because focusing on individual flexibility is only part of the story.<br/>
🎧 Anyway, back to the article.<br/>
🎧 Matthews found a German study which looked at what he called 'mixed-handedness',<br/>
🎧 that is, the capacity to use both left and right hands equally.<br/>
🎧 It looked at mixed-handedness in 40 musicians on a variety of instruments.<br/>
🎧 Researchers examined a number of variables,<br/>
🎧 for example, type of instrument played,<br/>
🎧 regularity of practice undertaken<br/>
🎧 and length of time playing instrument…<br/>
🎧 and found the following:<br/>
🎧 keyboard players had high levels of mixed-handedness,<br/>
🎧 whereas string players like cellists and violinists strongly favoured one hand.<br/>
🎧 Also, those who started younger were more mixed-handed.<br/>
🎧 Matthews also reports studies of handedness in apes.<br/>
🎧 Apes get a large proportion of their food by 'fishing' ants from ant hills.<br/>
🎧 The studies show that apes, like humans, show handedness -<br/>
🎧 though, for them right and left-handedness is about equal,<br/>
🎧 whereas about 85% of humans are right-handed.<br/>
🎧 Studies showed that apes consistently using the same hand<br/>
🎧 fished out 30% more ants than those varying between the two.<br/>
🎧 Matthews started researching several different sports<br/>
🎧 and found different types of handedness in each.<br/>
🎧 By the way, he uses 'handedness'.<br/>
🎧 to refer to the dominant side for feet and eyes as well as hands.<br/>
🎧 Anyway, his team measured the hand, feet and eyes of 2,611 players<br/>
🎧 and found that there were really three main types of laterality:<br/>
🎧 mixed - you work equally well on both sides - both hand and eye;<br/>
🎧 single - you tend to favour one side but both hand and eye favour the same side;<br/>
🎧 and cross-laterality - a player's hands and eyes favour only one side<br/>
🎧 but they are opposite sides.<br/>
🎧 Let's start with hockey.<br/>
🎧 Matthews found that it was best to be mixed-handed -<br/>
🎧 this is because a hockey stick must be deployed in two directions -<br/>
🎧 it would be a drawback to have hand or eye favouring one side.<br/>
🎧 An interesting finding is that mixed-handed hockey players were significantly more confident than their single-handed counterparts.<br/>
🎧 Things are slightly different in racket sports like tennis.<br/>
🎧 Here the important thing is to have the dominant hand and eye on the one side.<br/>
🎧 This means that there is a bigger area of vision on the side where most of the action occurs.<br/>
🎧 If a player is cross lateral,<br/>
🎧 the racket is invisible from the dominant eye for much of the swing.<br/>
🎧 It means that they can only make corrections much later…<br/>
🎧 and often the damage has been done by then.<br/>
🎧 And moving to a rather different type of sport which involves large but precise movements - gymnastics.<br/>
🎧 It's been found that cross hand-eye favouring is best.<br/>
🎧 The predominant reason for this is because it aids balance,<br/>
🎧 which is of course absolutely central to performance in this sport.<br/>
<br/><br/>
