🎧 I <span>presume</span> you've had a <span>previous</span> <span>insurer</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 <span>Right…<br/></span>

🎧 <span>Well…</span> <span>uh..</span>. <span>mainly</span> for <span>social</span> <span>use…<br/></span>
🎧 Will you be <span>using</span> it to travel to work?<br/>
🎧 <span>Yes…</span> sometimes.<br/>
🎧 Anything else?<br/>
🎧 No. That's it.<br/>
🎧 And finally, when would you like to start the <span>insurance</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'll need it from the <span>31st</span> of <span>January</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Right…<br/></span>
🎧 Mr <span>Jones…</span> I'm getting a <span>couple</span> of <span>quotes</span> <span>coming</span> up on the <span>computer</span> <span>now…<br/></span>
🎧 and the best bet looks like being with a company called Red <span>Flag</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 And that comes out at <span>$450</span> <span>per</span> <span>year…<br/></span>
🎧 That <span>seems</span> okay.<br/>
🎧 It's quite a bit <span>lower</span> than I've been <span>paying</span> up to now.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 So, would you like me to go <span>ahead</span> with that?<br/>
🎧 <span>Sure…</span> why not?<br/>
🎧 How would you like to pay?<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Thank you for <span>calling</span> the <span>Tourist</span> <span>Line</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are many different <span>ways</span> of getting <span>round</span> the <span>city<br/></span>
🎧 and we'd like to <span>suggest</span> some you may not have thought of.<br/>
🎧 How about a <span>city</span> <span>trip</span> by <span>boat</span>?<br/>
🎧 There are <span>four</span> <span>main</span> <span>stopping</span> <span>points</span> <span>-</span> from <span>west</span> to <span>east:<br/></span>
🎧 <span>stop</span> <span>A:</span> <span>Green</span> <span>Banks</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>stop</span> <span>B:</span> <span>City</span> <span>Bridge</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>stop</span> <span>C:</span> <span>Roman</span> <span>Landing<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>stop</span> <span>D:</span> <span>Newtown</span>.<br/>

🎧 The first <span>boat</span> leaves at <span>8</span> <span>a.m</span>.<br/>
🎧 and the last one at <span>6.30</span> <span>p.m</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are also many <span>attractions</span> you can visit along the <span>river</span>.<br/>
🎧 At <span>Stop</span> A, if you have time,<br/>
🎧 you can visit the fine <span>16th</span> <span>century</span> <span>palace</span> <span>here<br/></span>
🎧 <span>built</span> for the <span>king</span> with its <span>beautiful</span> <span>formal</span> <span>gardens</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's very near the <span>booking</span> <span>office</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, you can enjoy every <span>corner</span> of this <span>superb</span> <span>residence</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Stop</span> <span>B</span> <span>-</span> Why don't you visit <span>Tower</span> <span>Restaurant</span> with its <span>wide</span> <span>range</span> of <span>refreshments</span>?<br/>
🎧 This is a place where you can sit and enjoy the wonderful <span>views</span> over the old <span>commercial</span> and <span>banking</span> <span>centre</span> of the <span>city</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Stop</span> <span>C</span> is the <span>area</span> where, in the first <span>century</span> <span>AD</span>, <span>invading</span> <span>soldiers</span> <span>crossed</span> the <span>river;<br/></span>
🎧 this was much <span>shallower</span> than it is now.<br/>
🎧 That's why this <span>area</span> is called <span>Roman</span> <span>Landing</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's an <span>interactive</span> <span>museum</span> to visit <span>here<br/></span>
🎧 with a large <span>shop</span> which has a good <span>range</span> of <span>local</span> <span>history</span> books.<br/>
🎧 At the <span>furthest</span> <span>point</span> of the <span>trip</span>, <span>stop</span> <span>D</span>,<br/>
🎧 the most <span>exciting</span> place to visit is the new <span>Entertainment</span> <span>Complex<br/></span>
🎧 with <span>seven-screen</span> <span>cinema</span>, <span>bowling</span> <span>alley</span> and <span>video</span> <span>games</span> <span>arcade</span>.<br/>

🎧 We're <span>pleased</span> to <span>welcome</span> <span>Dr</span> <span>Martin</span> <span>Merrywhether</span> of the <span>Antarctic</span> <span>Centre</span> in <span>Christchurch</span>, New <span>Zealand<br/></span>
🎧 who has come along to talk to us today about the <span>role</span> of the <span>Centre</span> and the <span>Antarctic</span> <span>Treaty</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now my first <span>question</span> is about the <span>choice</span> of <span>location</span> for the <span>centre</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why <span>Christchurch</span>? Was it because of the <span>climate</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, actually, New <span>Zealand</span> is the second <span>closest</span> <span>country</span> to <span>Antarctica<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>Christchurch</span> is often used on <span>Antarctic</span> <span>expeditions</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, so it's because of where we <span>are…</span> <span>coupled</span> with our <span>historical</span> <span>role</span>.<br/>
🎧 So tell us <span>-</span> what is the <span>main</span> <span>purpose</span> of the <span>centre</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>well…</span> we have two <span>complementary</span> <span>roles</span>.<br/>
🎧 One is as a <span>scientific</span> <span>base</span> for <span>expeditions</span> and <span>research<br/></span>
🎧 and the other is as an <span>information</span> <span>centre</span>.<br/>
🎧 Tell us something about the <span>role</span> as a <span>scientific</span> <span>base</span>.<br/>
🎧 We're able to <span>provide</span> <span>information</span> about what <span>scientists</span> should take with them to the <span>South</span> <span>Pole</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 for example, the <span>centre</span> <span>contains</span> a <span>clothing</span> <span>warehouse<br/></span>
🎧 where <span>expeditions</span> are <span>supplied</span> with <span>suitable</span> <span>clothing</span> for the <span>extreme</span> <span>conditions</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> you need a bit more than your <span>normal</span> <span>winter</span> <span>coat</span>!<br/>
🎧 Yes, <span>exactly<br/></span>
🎧 and then there's also the <span>specialist</span> <span>library</span> and <span>mapping</span> <span>services</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And which <span>countries</span> are actually <span>located</span> at the <span>centre</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Well…</span> the <span>centre</span> <span>houses</span> <span>research</span> <span>programmes</span> for New <span>Zealand</span>,<br/>
🎧 for The <span>United</span> <span>States</span> as well as for <span>Italy…<br/></span>
🎧 there's even a US <span>post</span> <span>office</span> at the <span>American</span> <span>airforce</span> <span>base</span> here.<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 And what does the <span>visitor's</span> <span>centre</span> <span>offer</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, since very few people will ever <span>experience</span> the <span>Antarctic</span> first <span>hand</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>visitors'</span> <span>centre</span> <span>aims</span> to <span>recreate</span> the <span>atmosphere</span> of <span>Antarctica</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>mock</span> <span>camp</span> <span>site</span> where you can see inside an <span>Antarctic</span> <span>tent</span> and <span>imagine</span> yourself <span>sleeping</span> there.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>centre</span> also <span>acts</span> as a <span>showcase</span> for the <span>unique</span> <span>international</span> <span>co-operation<br/></span>
🎧 which <span>exists</span> in <span>Antarctica</span> today.<br/>
🎧 What is it actually like at the <span>South</span> <span>Pole</span>?<br/>
🎧 I know you've been there on a number of <span>occasions</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I have and each time I'm <span>struck</span> by the <span>awesome</span> <span>beauty</span> of the place.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>magnificent<br/></span>
🎧 but you can really only visit it in the <span>summer</span> <span>months</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>October</span> to <span>March</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, because it's <span>completely</span> <span>dark</span> for <span>four</span> <span>months</span> of the <span>year…<br/></span>
🎧 and, in <span>addition</span>, it has to be the <span>coldest</span> place on <span>earth</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Colder</span> than the <span>North</span> <span>Pole</span>?<br/>
🎧 Why's that?<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>unlike</span> the <span>North</span> <span>Pole</span>, which is actually a <span>frozen</span> sea,<br/>
🎧 <span>Antarctica</span> is a <span>land</span> <span>mass</span> <span>shaped</span> like a <span>dome</span>,<br/>
🎧 with the <span>result</span> that the <span>winds</span> <span>blow</span> down the <span>slopes</span> at <span>speeds</span> of up to <span>150</span> <span>km</span> an <span>hour<br/></span>
🎧 and that's what makes it so <span>cold</span>.<br/>
🎧 And one other <span>interesting</span> thing is that <span>Antarctica</span> is the <span>driest</span> <span>continent</span> on <span>earth</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>surprisingly</span>, and so you have to drink large <span>amounts</span> of water when you're there.<br/>
🎧 How old is <span>Antarctica</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh, we're <span>pretty</span> sure it was <span>part</span> of a <span>larger</span> <span>land</span> <span>mass</span> but it <span>broke</span> away from the <span>rest</span> of the <span>continent..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>170</span> <span>million</span> years ago.<br/>
🎧 How can you be <span>certain</span> of this?<br/>
🎧 Because <span>fossils</span> and <span>rocks</span> have been <span>discovered</span> in <span>Antarctica<br/></span>
🎧 which are the same as those <span>found</span> in <span>places</span> such as <span>Africa</span> and <span>Australia</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Amazing…</span> to think that it was once <span>attached</span> to <span>Africa…<br/></span>
🎧 Now let's just have a look at the <span>Antarctic</span> <span>Treaty</span>.<br/>
🎧 How <span>far</span> back does the idea of an <span>international</span> <span>treaty</span> go?<br/>
🎧 Well, as <span>far</span> back as the <span>19th</span> <span>century</span>,<br/>
🎧 when <span>11</span> <span>nations</span> <span>organised</span> an <span>international</span> <span>event</span>.<br/>
🎧 When was that exactly?<br/>
🎧 In <span>1870</span>.<br/>
🎧 And it was called the <span>Polar</span> <span>Research</span> <span>Meeting</span>.<br/>
🎧 And then, not long after that,<br/>
🎧 they <span>organised</span> something called the First <span>International</span> <span>Polar</span> Year.<br/>
🎧 And that took place when exactly?<br/>
🎧 Over two years from <span>1882</span> to <span>1883</span>.<br/>
🎧 But it wasn't until the <span>1950s</span> that the idea of an <span>international</span> <span>treaty</span> was <span>proposed</span>.<br/>
🎧 And in <span>1959</span>, the <span>Treaty</span> was actually <span>signed</span>.<br/>
🎧 What do you see as the <span>main</span> <span>achievements</span> of the <span>treaty</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>firstly</span>, it <span>means</span> that the <span>continent</span> is <span>reserved</span> for <span>peaceful</span> use.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>Article</span> <span>1</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 <span>Yes…<br/></span>
🎧 That's important since the <span>territory</span> <span>belongs</span> to everyone.<br/>
🎧 Yes but not as important as <span>Article</span> <span>5</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>prohibits</span> any <span>nuclear</span> <span>explosions</span> or <span>waste</span> <span>disposal</span>.<br/>
🎧 Which is <span>marvellous</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm <span>afraid</span> we're going to have to <span>stop</span> there because I'm <span>afraid</span> we've run out of time.<br/>
🎧 Thanks for <span>coming</span> along today and <span>telling</span> us all about the <span>centre</span> and its work.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 My <span>topic</span> is <span>handedness</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>whether</span> in different <span>sports</span> it is better to be <span>left</span> or <span>right-sided<br/></span>
🎧 or <span>whether</span> a more <span>balanced</span> <span>approach</span> is more <span>successful</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>left-handed</span> <span>myself<br/></span>
🎧 and I actually didn't see any <span>relevance</span> to my own <span>life<br/></span>
🎧 when I <span>happened</span> to start <span>reading</span> an <span>article</span> by a <span>sports</span> <span>psychologist</span> called <span>Peter</span> <span>Matthews</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>spent</span> the first <span>part</span> of the <span>article</span> talking about <span>handedness</span> in music <span>instead</span> of <span>sport</span>,<br/>
🎧 which I have to say almost put me off from <span>reading</span> <span>further</span>.<br/>
🎧 But what I soon <span>became</span> <span>struck</span> <span>by<br/></span>
🎧 was the <span>sheer</span> <span>volume</span> of both <span>observation</span> and <span>investigation</span> he had done in many different <span>sports<br/></span>
🎧 and I <span>felt</span> <span>persuaded</span> that what he had to say would be of <span>real</span> <span>interest</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think <span>Matthews'</span> <span>findings</span> will be <span>beneficial</span>,<br/>
🎧 not so much in <span>helping</span> <span>sportspeople</span> to work on their <span>weaker</span> side,<br/>
🎧 but more that they can help them <span>identify</span> the most <span>suitable</span> <span>strategies</span> to use in a <span>given</span> game.<br/>
🎧 Although most <span>trainers</span> know how important <span>handedness</span> is,<br/>
🎧 at <span>present</span> they are rather <span>reluctant</span> to make use of the <span>insights</span> <span>scientists</span> like <span>Matthews</span> can give,<br/>
🎧 which I think is rather <span>short-sighted<br/></span>
🎧 because <span>focusing</span> on <span>individual</span> <span>flexibility</span> is only <span>part</span> of the <span>story</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, back to the <span>article</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Matthews</span> <span>found</span> a <span>German</span> <span>study</span> which <span>looked</span> at what he called <span>'mixed-handedness'</span>,<br/>
🎧 that is, the <span>capacity</span> to use both <span>left</span> and right <span>hands</span> <span>equally</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>looked</span> at <span>mixed-handedness</span> in <span>40</span> <span>musicians</span> on a <span>variety</span> of <span>instruments</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Researchers</span> <span>examined</span> a number of <span>variables</span>,<br/>
🎧 for example, <span>type</span> of <span>instrument</span> <span>played</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>regularity</span> of practice <span>undertaken<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>length</span> of time playing <span>instrument…<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>found</span> the <span>following:<br/></span>
🎧 <span>keyboard</span> <span>players</span> had high <span>levels</span> of <span>mixed-handedness</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>whereas</span> <span>string</span> <span>players</span> like <span>cellists</span> and <span>violinists</span> <span>strongly</span> <span>favoured</span> one <span>hand</span>.<br/>
🎧 Also, those who <span>started</span> <span>younger</span> were more <span>mixed-handed</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Matthews</span> also <span>reports</span> <span>studies</span> of <span>handedness</span> in <span>apes</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Apes</span> get a large <span>proportion</span> of their food by <span>'fishing'</span> <span>ants</span> from <span>ant</span> <span>hills</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>studies</span> show that <span>apes</span>, like <span>humans</span>, show <span>handedness</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 though, for them right and <span>left-handedness</span> is about <span>equal</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>whereas</span> about <span>85%</span> of <span>humans</span> are <span>right-handed</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Studies</span> <span>showed</span> that <span>apes</span> <span>consistently</span> <span>using</span> the same <span>hand<br/></span>
🎧 <span>fished</span> out <span>30%</span> more <span>ants</span> than those <span>varying</span> between the two.<br/>
🎧 <span>Matthews</span> <span>started</span> <span>researching</span> <span>several</span> different <span>sports<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>found</span> different <span>types</span> of <span>handedness</span> in each.<br/>
🎧 By the way, he <span>uses</span> <span>'handedness'</span>.<br/>
🎧 to <span>refer</span> to the <span>dominant</span> side for <span>feet</span> and <span>eyes</span> as well as <span>hands</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, his <span>team</span> <span>measured</span> the <span>hand</span>, <span>feet</span> and <span>eyes</span> of <span>2,611</span> <span>players<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>found</span> that there were really <span>three</span> <span>main</span> <span>types</span> of <span>laterality:<br/></span>
🎧 <span>mixed</span> <span>-</span> you work <span>equally</span> well on both <span>sides</span> <span>-</span> both <span>hand</span> and <span>eye;<br/></span>
🎧 <span>single</span> <span>-</span> you <span>tend</span> to <span>favour</span> one side but both <span>hand</span> and eye <span>favour</span> the same <span>side;<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>cross-laterality</span> <span>-</span> a <span>player's</span> <span>hands</span> and <span>eyes</span> <span>favour</span> only one <span>side<br/></span>
🎧 but they are <span>opposite</span> <span>sides</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's start with <span>hockey</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Matthews</span> <span>found</span> that it was best to be <span>mixed-handed</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 this is because a <span>hockey</span> <span>stick</span> must be <span>deployed</span> in two <span>directions</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it would be a <span>drawback</span> to have <span>hand</span> or eye <span>favouring</span> one side.<br/>
🎧 An <span>interesting</span> <span>finding</span> is that <span>mixed-handed</span> <span>hockey</span> <span>players</span> were <span>significantly</span> more <span>confident</span> than their <span>single-handed</span> <span>counterparts</span>.<br/>
🎧 Things are <span>slightly</span> different in <span>racket</span> <span>sports</span> like <span>tennis</span>.<br/>
🎧 Here the important thing is to have the <span>dominant</span> <span>hand</span> and eye on the one side.<br/>
🎧 This <span>means</span> that there is a <span>bigger</span> <span>area</span> of <span>vision</span> on the side where most of the <span>action</span> <span>occurs</span>.<br/>
🎧 If a <span>player</span> is <span>cross</span> <span>lateral</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>racket</span> is <span>invisible</span> from the <span>dominant</span> eye for much of the <span>swing</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>means</span> that they can only make <span>corrections</span> much <span>later…<br/></span>
🎧 and often the <span>damage</span> has been done by then.<br/>
🎧 And <span>moving</span> to a rather different <span>type</span> of <span>sport</span> which <span>involves</span> large but <span>precise</span> <span>movements</span> <span>-</span> <span>gymnastics</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's been <span>found</span> that <span>cross</span> <span>hand-eye</span> <span>favouring</span> is best.<br/>
🎧 The <span>predominant</span> <span>reason</span> for this is because it <span>aids</span> <span>balance</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is of course absolutely <span>central</span> to <span>performance</span> in this <span>sport</span>.<br/>
