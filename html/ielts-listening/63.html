🎧 Hello, Wayside</span> Camera</span> Club</span>, Breda</span> speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, hello, um</span>, my name's</span> Dan</span> and I'd like to join your club</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's great, Dan</span>.<br/>
🎧 We have an application</span> form</span>,<br/>
🎧 would you like to complete</span> it over the phone,<br/>
🎧 then you can ask any questions</span> you might have?<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes, thanks.<br/>
🎧 OK, so what's your family</span> name?<br/>
🎧 It's Green</span>, Dan</span> Green</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, can I take your email</span> address</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's dan1068@market.com</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 And what about your home address</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm about ten miles</span> away from your club</span> in Peacetown</span>.<br/>
🎧 I live in a house there.<br/>
🎧 OK, so what's the house number and street</span>?<br/>
🎧 It's 52</span> Marrowfield</span> Street</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is that M-A-R-R-O-W-F-I-E-L-D</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 ...and</span> that's Peacetown</span>, you said?<br/>
🎧 So how did you hear about our club</span>?<br/>
🎧 Did you look on the internet</span>?<br/>
🎧 I usually do that, but this time..</span>.<br/>
🎧 well, I was talking to a relative</span> the other day and he suggested</span> it.<br/>
🎧 Oh, is he a member</span> too?<br/>
🎧 He belongs</span> to another club</span>,<br/>
🎧 but he'd heard good things about yours</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So what do you hope to get from joining</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, one thing that really interests</span> me is the competitions</span> that you have.<br/>
🎧 I enjoy entering</span> those.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Anything else?<br/>
🎧 Well, I also like to socialise</span> with other photographers</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's great.<br/>
🎧 So what type</span> of membership</span> would you like?<br/>
🎧 What are the options?<br/>
🎧 It's £30</span> a year for full membership<br/></span>
🎧 or £20</span> a year if you're an associate</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think I'll go for the full membership</span>, then.<br/>
🎧 That's a good idea<br/></span>
🎧 because you can't vote</span> in meetings</span> with an associate</span> membership</span>.<br/>
🎧 If I could just find out a bit more about you..</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So you said you wanted to compete</span>,<br/>
🎧 have you ever won</span> any photography</span> competitions</span>?<br/>
🎧 Not yet, but I have entered</span> three</span> in the past</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 So why don't you tell me something about those?<br/>
🎧 Let's start with the first one.<br/>
🎧 Well, the theme</span> was entitled</span> 'Domestic</span> Life'</span>.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 So it had to be something related</span> to the home?<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 I chose</span> to take a photo</span> of a family</span> sitting</span> round</span> the dinner table</span> having a meal</span>,<br/>
🎧 and, urn</span>, I didn't win, but I did get some feedback</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, what did the judges</span> say?<br/>
🎧 That it was too 'busy'</span> as a picture</span>.<br/>
🎧 Aha</span>, so it was the composition</span> of the picture</span> that they criticised</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's right, and once they'd told me that, I could see my mistake</span>.<br/>
🎧 So what was the theme</span> of the second composition</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, my university was on the coast<br/></span>
🎧 and that area</span> gets</span> a lot of beautiful</span> sunsets<br/></span>
🎧 so that was the theme</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, sunsets</span>, that's a great theme</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 The instructions</span> were to capture</span> the clouds</span> as well,<br/>
🎧 it couldn't just be blue</span> sky and a setting</span> sun.<br/>
🎧 Sure, 'cause</span> they give you all those amazing pinks</span> and purples</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, and I thought I'd done that well,<br/>
🎧 but the feedback</span> was that I should have waited</span> a bit longer</span> to get the shot</span>.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 So the timing</span> wasn't right.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I took it too soon, basically</span>.<br/>
🎧 And then the third</span> competition</span> I entered</span> was called 'Animal</span> Magic'</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's a difficult</span> subject</span>!<br/>
🎧 I know!<br/>
🎧 I had to take hundreds</span> of shots</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure, because animals</span> move all the time.<br/>
🎧 That's what we had to show,<br/>
🎧 there had to be some movements</span> in the scene</span>.<br/>
🎧 I got a great shot</span> of a fox in the end,<br/>
🎧 but I took it at night</span> and..</span>.<br/>
🎧 well, I suspected</span> that it was a bit dark</span> which is what I was told.<br/>
🎧 Well, Dan</span>, you seem</span> to be really keen</span> and we'd be delighted</span> to have you in our club</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure we can help with all those areas</span> that you've outlined</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks, that's great.<br/>

🎧 This evening</span> we're delighted</span> to welcome</span> Dan</span> Beagle</span>,<br/>
🎧 who's just written</span> a book on looking for and finding</span> food in the wild</span>.<br/>
🎧 He's going to tell us everything we need to know about picking</span> wild</span> mushrooms</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you very much.<br/>
🎧 Well, I need to start by talking about safety</span>.<br/>
🎧 You really need to know what you're doing because some mushrooms</span> are extremely</span> poisonous</span>.<br/>
🎧 Having said that, once you know what to look for,<br/>
🎧 it's really worth</span> doing for the amazing variety</span> of mushrooms</span> available</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 which you can't get in the shops</span>.<br/>
🎧 But of course, you have to be very careful<br/></span>
🎧 and that's why I always say you should never consume</span> mushrooms</span> picked</span> by friends or neighbours</span>.<br/>
🎧 Always remember that some poisonous</span> mushrooms</span> look very similar</span> to edible</span> ones<br/></span>
🎧 and it's easy for people to get confused</span>.<br/>
🎧 The other thing to avoid</span> is mushrooms</span> growing</span> beside</span> busy</span> roads</span> for obvious</span> reasons</span>.<br/>
🎧 But nothing</span> beats</span> the taste</span> of freshly</span> picked</span> mushrooms</span>.<br/>
🎧 Don't forget</span> that the ones</span> in the shops</span> are often several</span> days</span> old and past</span> their best.<br/>
🎧 There are certain</span> ideas</span> about wild</span> mushrooms</span> that it's important to be aware</span> of.<br/>
🎧 Don't listen to people who tell you that it's only OK to eat mushrooms</span> that are pale</span> or dull</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is completely</span> untrue</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some edible</span> mushrooms</span> are bright</span> red, for example.<br/>
🎧 Personally</span>, I prefer</span> mushrooms</span> cooked<br/></span>
🎧 but it won't do you any harm</span> to eat them uncooked</span> in salads</span>,<br/>
🎧 it's not necessary</span> to peel</span> them.<br/>
🎧 Another thing you should remember is that you can't tell if a mushroom</span> is safe</span> to eat by its smell</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some of the most deadly</span> mushrooms</span> have no smell</span> and taste</span> quite nice, apparently</span>.<br/>
🎧 Finally, just because deer</span> or squirrels</span> eat a particular</span> mushroom</span> doesn't mean that you can.<br/>
🎧 Of course, mushroom</span> picking</span> is associated</span> with the countryside<br/></span>
🎧 but if you haven't got a car, your local</span> park</span> can be a great place to start.<br/>
🎧 There are usually a range</span> of habitats</span> where mushrooms</span> grow</span>,<br/>
🎧 such as playing fields</span> and wooded</span> areas</span>.<br/>
🎧 But you need to be there first thing in the morning,<br/>
🎧 as there's likely</span> to be a lot of competition</span>,<br/>
🎧 not just from people but wildlife</span> too.<br/>
🎧 The deer</span> often get the best mushrooms</span> in my local</span> park</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you're a complete</span> beginner</span>,<br/>
🎧 I wouldn't recommend</span> going alone</span> or relying</span> on photos</span> in a book,<br/>
🎧 even the one I've written</span>!<br/>
🎧 There are some really good phone apps</span> for identifying</span> mushrooms</span>,<br/>
🎧 but you can't always rely</span> on getting a good signal</span> in the middle</span> of a wood</span>.<br/>
🎧 If possible</span>, you should go with a group led</span> by an expert</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll stay</span> safe</span> and learn a lot that way.<br/>
🎧 Conservation</span> is a really important consideration<br/></span>
🎧 and you must follow</span> a few basic</span> rules</span>.<br/>
🎧 You should never pick</span> all the mushrooms</span> in one area</span>.<br/>
🎧 Collect</span> only enough for your own needs.<br/>
🎧 Be very careful</span> that you don't trample</span> on young mushrooms</span> or other plants</span>.<br/>
🎧 And make sure you don't pick</span> any mushrooms</span> that are endangered</span> and protected</span> by law.<br/>
🎧 There's been a decline</span> in some varieties</span> of wild</span> mushrooms</span> in this part</span> of the country</span>.<br/>
🎧 Restaurants</span> are becoming</span> more interested in locally</span> sourced</span> food like wild</span> mushrooms</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the biggest</span> problem</span> is that so many new houses</span> have been built</span> in this area</span> in the last ten years.<br/>
🎧 And more water is being taken from rivers</span> and reservoirs</span> because of this,<br/>
🎧 and mushroom</span> habitats</span> have been destroyed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Anyway</span>, a word</span> of advice on storing</span> mushrooms</span>.<br/>
🎧 Collect</span> them in a brown</span> paper</span> bag<br/></span>
🎧 and as soon as you get home, put them in the fridge</span>.<br/>
🎧 They'll be fine for a couple</span> of days</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it's best to cook</span> them as soon as possible<br/></span>
🎧 after washing</span> them really carefully</span> first, of course.<br/>
🎧 So everybody</span> knows</span> what a mushroom</span> tastes</span> like, right?<br/>
🎧 Well, you'll be surprised</span> by the huge</span> variety</span> of wild</span> mushrooms</span> there are.<br/>
🎧 Be adventurous</span>!<br/>
🎧 They're great in so many dishes</span>:<br/>
🎧 stir</span> fries</span>, risottos</span>, pasta</span>.<br/>
🎧 But just be aware</span> that some people can react</span> badly</span> to certain</span> varieties<br/></span>
🎧 so it's a good idea not to eat huge</span> quantities</span> to begin</span> with.<br/>
🎧 OK, so now I'm going to show you..</span>.<br/>

🎧 That seminar</span> yesterday</span> on automation</span> and the future of work was really good, wasn't it?<br/>
🎧 Looking at the first industrial</span> revolution</span> in Britain</span> in the 19th</span> century<br/></span>
🎧 and seeing</span> how people reacted</span> to massive</span> change was a real</span> eye opener</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 It was interesting</span> to hear how people felt</span> about automation</span> then<br/></span>
🎧 and what challenges</span> they faced</span>.<br/>
🎧 I didn't know that first started</span> with workers</span> in the textile</span> industry</span>.<br/>
🎧 With those protesting</span> workers</span> called the Luddites<br/></span>
🎧 destroying</span> their knitting</span> machines</span> because they were so worried</span> about losing</span> their jobs</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, and ultimately</span>, they didn't achieve</span> anything.<br/>
🎧 And anyway</span>, industrialisation</span> created</span> more jobs</span> than it destroyed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's true</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it probably didn't seem</span> a positive</span> thing at the time.<br/>
🎧 I can see why the Luddites</span> felt</span> so threatened</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure I would have felt</span> the same.<br/>
🎧 The discussion</span> about the future of work was really optimistic</span> for a change.<br/>
🎧 I like the idea that work won't involve</span> doing boring</span>, repetitive</span> tasks</span>,<br/>
🎧 as robots</span> will do all that.<br/>
🎧 Normally</span>, you only hear negative</span> stuff</span> about the future.<br/>
🎧 Bit too optimistic</span>, don't you think?<br/>
🎧 For example, I can't see how people are about to have more leisure</span> time,<br/>
🎧 when all the evidence</span> shows</span> people are spending longer</span> than ever at work.<br/>
🎧 No, that's true</span>.<br/>
🎧 And what about lower</span> unemployment</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm not so sure about that.<br/>
🎧 Perhaps</span> in the long term</span>,<br/>
🎧 but not in the foreseeable</span> future.<br/>
🎧 And I expect</span> most people will be expected</span> to work until they're much older<br/></span>
🎧 as everyone's</span> living much longer</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's already happening</span>.<br/>
🎧 I enjoyed</span> all that stuff</span> on how technology's</span> changed</span> some jobs<br/></span>
🎧 and how they're likely</span> to change in the near future.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, incredible</span>.<br/>
🎧 Like accountants</span>.<br/>
🎧 You might think all the technological</span> innovations</span> would have put them out of a job</span>,<br/>
🎧 but in fact</span> there are more of them than ever.<br/>
🎧 They're still really in demand</span> and have become far</span> more efficient</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right. That was amazing.<br/>
🎧 Twenty</span> times</span> more accountants</span> in this country</span> compared</span> to the 19th</span> century</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 I'd never have thought that demand</span> for hairdressing</span> would have gone</span> up so much in the last hundred</span> years.<br/>
🎧 One hairdresser</span> for every 287</span> people now,<br/>
🎧 compared</span> to one for over 1,500</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah because people's</span> earning</span> power</span> has gone</span> up so they can afford</span> to spend</span> more on personal services</span> like that.<br/>
🎧 But technology</span> hasn't changed</span> the actual</span> job</span> that much.<br/>
🎧 No, they've</span> got hairdryers</span>, etc</span>.<br/>
🎧 but it's one job</span> where you don't depend</span> on a computer..</span>.<br/>
🎧 The kind of work that administrative</span> staff</span> do has changed</span> enormously</span>, thanks to technology</span>.<br/>
🎧 Even 20</span> years ago there were secretaries</span> doing dictation</span> and typing</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes. Really boring</span> compared</span> to these days</span>,<br/>
🎧 when they're given</span> much more responsibility</span> and higher</span> status</span>.<br/>
🎧 A lot of graduates</span> go in for this kind of work now..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd expected</span> there to be a much bigger</span> change in the number of agricultural</span> workers</span> in the 19th</span> century</span>.<br/>
🎧 But the 1871</span> census</span> showed</span> that roughly</span> 25%</span> of the population</span> worked</span> on the land</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I'd have assumed</span> it would be more than 50%</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now it's less than 0.2%</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hmm..</span>. What about care</span> workers</span>?<br/>
🎧 They barely</span> existed</span> in the 19th</span> century<br/></span>
🎧 as people's</span> lifespan</span> was so much shorter</span>.<br/>
🎧 But now of course this sector</span> will see huge</span> growth</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, and it's hard</span> enough to meet current</span> demand</span>.<br/>
🎧 The future looks quite bleak</span> for bank</span> clerks</span>.<br/>
🎧 They've</span> been in decline</span> since ATMs</span> were introduced</span> in the 80s</span>.<br/>
🎧 And technology</span> will certainly</span> make most of the jobs</span> they do now redundant</span>, I think.<br/>
🎧 I agree, although the situation</span> may change.<br/>
🎧 It's very hard</span> to predict</span> what will happen</span>.<br/>

🎧 In today's</span> astronomy</span> lecture</span>,<br/>
🎧 I'm going to talk about the need for a system</span> to manage</span> the movement</span> of satellites<br/></span>
🎧 and other objects</span> in orbit</span> around the Earth</span>.<br/>
🎧 In other words</span>, a Space</span> Traffic</span> Management</span> system</span>.<br/>
🎧 We already have effective</span> Air Traffic</span> Control</span> systems<br/></span>
🎧 that are used internationally</span> to ensure</span> that planes</span> navigate</span> our skies</span> safely</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, Space</span> Traffic</span> Management</span> is a similar</span> concept</span>,<br/>
🎧 but focusing</span> on the control</span> of satellites</span>.<br/>
🎧 The aim</span> of such a system</span> would be to prevent</span> the danger</span> of collisions</span> in space<br/></span>
🎧 between the objects</span> in orbit</span> around the Earth</span>.<br/>
🎧 In order to do this, we'd need to have a set of legal</span> measures</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we'd also have to develop</span> the technical</span> systems</span> to enable</span> us to prevent</span> such accidents</span>.<br/>
🎧 But unfortunately</span>, at present</span> we don't actually have a Space</span> Traffic</span> Management</span> system</span> that works</span>.<br/>
🎧 So why not?<br/>
🎧 What are the problems</span> in developing</span> such a system</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, for one thing, satellites</span> are relatively</span> cheap</span> these days</span>,<br/>
🎧 compared</span> with how they were in the past</span>,<br/>
🎧 meaning</span> that more people can afford</span> to put them into space</span>.<br/>
🎧 So there's a lot more of them out there,<br/>
🎧 and people aren't just launching</span> single</span> satellites<br/></span>
🎧 but whole constellations</span>, consisting</span> of thousands</span> of them designed</span> to work together.<br/>
🎧 So space</span> is getting more crowded</span> every day.<br/>
🎧 But in spite</span> of this, one thing you may be surprised</span> to learn<br/></span>
🎧 is that you can launch</span> a satellite</span> into space<br/></span>
🎧 and, once it's out there, it doesn't have to send</span> back any information</span> to Earth</span> to allow</span> its identification</span>.<br/>
🎧 So while we have international</span> systems</span> for ensuring</span> we know where the planes</span> in our skies</span> are,<br/>
🎧 and to prevent</span> them from colliding</span> with one another,<br/>
🎧 when it comes to the safety</span> of satellites</span>,<br/>
🎧 at present</span> we don't have anything like enough proper</span> ways</span> of tracking</span> them.<br/>
🎧 And it isn't just entire</span> satellites</span> that we need to consider</span>.<br/>
🎧 A greater</span> threat</span> is the huge</span> amount of space</span> debris</span> in orbit</span> around the Earth</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 broken</span> bits</span> of satellite</span> and junk</span> from space</span> stations</span> and so on.<br/>
🎧 And some of these are so small that they can be very hard</span> to identify</span>,<br/>
🎧 but they can still be very dangerous</span>.<br/>
🎧 In addition</span>, some operators</span> may be unwilling</span> to share information</span> about the satellites</span> they've</span> launched</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, a satellite</span> may be designed</span> for military</span> purposes</span>,<br/>
🎧 or it may have been launched</span> for commercial</span> reasons</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the operators</span> don't want competitors</span> to have information</span> about it.<br/>
🎧 And even if the operators</span> are willing</span> to provide</span> it,<br/>
🎧 the information</span> isn't easy to collect</span>.<br/>
🎧 Details</span> are needed</span> about the object</span> itself</span>,<br/>
🎧 as well as about its location</span> at a particular</span> time -<br/></span>
🎧 and remember that a satellite</span> isn't very big,<br/>
🎧 and it's likely</span> to be moving</span> at thousands</span> of kilometres</span> an hour</span>.<br/>
🎧 We don't have any sensors</span> that can constantly</span> follow</span> something moving</span> so fast</span>,<br/>
🎧 so all that the scientists</span> can do is to put forward a prediction</span> concerning</span> where the satellite</span> is heading</span> next.<br/>
🎧 So those are some of the problems</span> that we're facing</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's consider</span> now some of the solutions</span> that have been suggested</span>.<br/>
🎧 One key issue is the way in which information</span> is dealt</span> with.<br/>
🎧 We need more information</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it also needs to be accessible</span> at a global</span> level</span>,<br/>
🎧 so we need to establish</span> shared</span> standards</span> that we can all agree on<br/></span>
🎧 for the way in which this information</span> is presented</span>.<br/>
🎧 We already do this in other areas</span> of science</span>,<br/>
🎧 so although this is a challenge</span>, it's not an impossible</span> task</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then, as all this information's</span> collected</span>,<br/>
🎧 it needs to be put together so it can be used,<br/>
🎧 and that will involve</span> creating</span> a single</span> database</span> on which it can be entered</span>.<br/>
🎧 As we continue</span> to push</span> forward new developments</span>,<br/>
