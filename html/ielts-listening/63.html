🎧 Hello, Wayside Camera Club, Breda speaking.<br/>
🎧 Oh, hello, um, my name's Dan and I'd like to join your club.<br/>
🎧 That's great, Dan.<br/>
🎧 We have an application form,<br/>
🎧 would you like to complete it over the phone,<br/>
🎧 then you can ask any questions you might have?<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes, thanks.<br/>
🎧 OK, so what's your family name?<br/>
🎧 It's Green, Dan Green.<br/>
🎧 So, can I take your email address?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's dan1068@market.com.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 And what about your home address?<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm about ten miles away from your club in Peacetown.<br/>
🎧 I live in a house there.<br/>
🎧 OK, so what's the house number and street?<br/>
🎧 It's 52 Marrowfield Street.<br/>
🎧 Is that M-A-R-R-O-W-F-I-E-L-D?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 ...and that's Peacetown, you said?<br/>
🎧 So how did you hear about our club?<br/>
🎧 Did you look on the internet?<br/>
🎧 I usually do that, but this time...<br/>
🎧 well, I was talking to a relative the other day and he suggested it.<br/>
🎧 Oh, is he a member too?<br/>
🎧 He belongs to another club,<br/>
🎧 but he'd heard good things about yours.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So what do you hope to get from joining?<br/>
🎧 Well, one thing that really interests me is the competitions that you have.<br/>
🎧 I enjoy entering those.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Anything else?<br/>
🎧 Well, I also like to socialise with other photographers.<br/>
🎧 That's great.<br/>
🎧 So what type of membership would you like?<br/>
🎧 What are the options?<br/>
🎧 It's £30 a year for full membership<br/>
🎧 or £20 a year if you're an associate.<br/>
🎧 I think I'll go for the full membership, then.<br/>
🎧 That's a good idea<br/>
🎧 because you can't vote in meetings with an associate membership.<br/>
🎧 If I could just find out a bit more about you...<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So you said you wanted to compete,<br/>
🎧 have you ever won any photography competitions?<br/>
🎧 Not yet, but I have entered three in the past.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's interesting.<br/>
🎧 So why don't you tell me something about those?<br/>
🎧 Let's start with the first one.<br/>
🎧 Well, the theme was entitled 'Domestic Life'.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 So it had to be something related to the home?<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 I chose to take a photo of a family sitting round the dinner table having a meal,<br/>
🎧 and, urn, I didn't win, but I did get some feedback.<br/>
🎧 Oh, what did the judges say?<br/>
🎧 That it was too 'busy' as a picture.<br/>
🎧 Aha, so it was the composition of the picture that they criticised?<br/>
🎧 That's right, and once they'd told me that, I could see my mistake.<br/>
🎧 So what was the theme of the second composition?<br/>
🎧 Well, my university was on the coast<br/>
🎧 and that area gets a lot of beautiful sunsets<br/>
🎧 so that was the theme.<br/>
🎧 Oh, sunsets, that's a great theme.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 The instructions were to capture the clouds as well,<br/>
🎧 it couldn't just be blue sky and a setting sun.<br/>
🎧 Sure, 'cause they give you all those amazing pinks and purples.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, and I thought I'd done that well,<br/>
🎧 but the feedback was that I should have waited a bit longer to get the shot.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 So the timing wasn't right.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I took it too soon, basically.<br/>
🎧 And then the third competition I entered was called 'Animal Magic'.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's a difficult subject!<br/>
🎧 I know!<br/>
🎧 I had to take hundreds of shots.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure, because animals move all the time.<br/>
🎧 That's what we had to show,<br/>
🎧 there had to be some movements in the scene.<br/>
🎧 I got a great shot of a fox in the end,<br/>
🎧 but I took it at night and...<br/>
🎧 well, I suspected that it was a bit dark which is what I was told.<br/>
🎧 Well, Dan, you seem to be really keen and we'd be delighted to have you in our club.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure we can help with all those areas that you've outlined.<br/>
🎧 Thanks, that's great.<br/>

🎧 This evening we're delighted to welcome Dan Beagle,<br/>
🎧 who's just written a book on looking for and finding food in the wild.<br/>
🎧 He's going to tell us everything we need to know about picking wild mushrooms.<br/>
🎧 Thank you very much.<br/>
🎧 Well, I need to start by talking about safety.<br/>
🎧 You really need to know what you're doing because some mushrooms are extremely poisonous.<br/>
🎧 Having said that, once you know what to look for,<br/>
🎧 it's really worth doing for the amazing variety of mushrooms available -<br/>
🎧 which you can't get in the shops.<br/>
🎧 But of course, you have to be very careful<br/>
🎧 and that's why I always say you should never consume mushrooms picked by friends or neighbours.<br/>
🎧 Always remember that some poisonous mushrooms look very similar to edible ones<br/>
🎧 and it's easy for people to get confused.<br/>
🎧 The other thing to avoid is mushrooms growing beside busy roads for obvious reasons.<br/>
🎧 But nothing beats the taste of freshly picked mushrooms.<br/>
🎧 Don't forget that the ones in the shops are often several days old and past their best.<br/>
🎧 There are certain ideas about wild mushrooms that it's important to be aware of.<br/>
🎧 Don't listen to people who tell you that it's only OK to eat mushrooms that are pale or dull.<br/>
🎧 This is completely untrue.<br/>
🎧 Some edible mushrooms are bright red, for example.<br/>
🎧 Personally, I prefer mushrooms cooked<br/>
🎧 but it won't do you any harm to eat them uncooked in salads,<br/>
🎧 it's not necessary to peel them.<br/>
🎧 Another thing you should remember is that you can't tell if a mushroom is safe to eat by its smell.<br/>
🎧 Some of the most deadly mushrooms have no smell and taste quite nice, apparently.<br/>
🎧 Finally, just because deer or squirrels eat a particular mushroom doesn't mean that you can.<br/>
🎧 Of course, mushroom picking is associated with the countryside<br/>
🎧 but if you haven't got a car, your local park can be a great place to start.<br/>
🎧 There are usually a range of habitats where mushrooms grow,<br/>
🎧 such as playing fields and wooded areas.<br/>
🎧 But you need to be there first thing in the morning,<br/>
🎧 as there's likely to be a lot of competition,<br/>
🎧 not just from people but wildlife too.<br/>
🎧 The deer often get the best mushrooms in my local park.<br/>
🎧 If you're a complete beginner,<br/>
🎧 I wouldn't recommend going alone or relying on photos in a book,<br/>
🎧 even the one I've written!<br/>
🎧 There are some really good phone apps for identifying mushrooms,<br/>
🎧 but you can't always rely on getting a good signal in the middle of a wood.<br/>
🎧 If possible, you should go with a group led by an expert.<br/>
🎧 You'll stay safe and learn a lot that way.<br/>
🎧 Conservation is a really important consideration<br/>
🎧 and you must follow a few basic rules.<br/>
🎧 You should never pick all the mushrooms in one area.<br/>
🎧 Collect only enough for your own needs.<br/>
🎧 Be very careful that you don't trample on young mushrooms or other plants.<br/>
🎧 And make sure you don't pick any mushrooms that are endangered and protected by law.<br/>
🎧 There's been a decline in some varieties of wild mushrooms in this part of the country.<br/>
🎧 Restaurants are becoming more interested in locally sourced food like wild mushrooms,<br/>
🎧 but the biggest problem is that so many new houses have been built in this area in the last ten years.<br/>
🎧 And more water is being taken from rivers and reservoirs because of this,<br/>
🎧 and mushroom habitats have been destroyed.<br/>
🎧 Anyway, a word of advice on storing mushrooms.<br/>
🎧 Collect them in a brown paper bag<br/>
🎧 and as soon as you get home, put them in the fridge.<br/>
🎧 They'll be fine for a couple of days,<br/>
🎧 but it's best to cook them as soon as possible<br/>
🎧 after washing them really carefully first, of course.<br/>
🎧 So everybody knows what a mushroom tastes like, right?<br/>
🎧 Well, you'll be surprised by the huge variety of wild mushrooms there are.<br/>
🎧 Be adventurous!<br/>
🎧 They're great in so many dishes:<br/>
🎧 stir fries, risottos, pasta.<br/>
🎧 But just be aware that some people can react badly to certain varieties<br/>
🎧 so it's a good idea not to eat huge quantities to begin with.<br/>
🎧 OK, so now I'm going to show you...<br/>

🎧 That seminar yesterday on automation and the future of work was really good, wasn't it?<br/>
🎧 Looking at the first industrial revolution in Britain in the 19th century<br/>
🎧 and seeing how people reacted to massive change was a real eye opener.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 It was interesting to hear how people felt about automation then<br/>
🎧 and what challenges they faced.<br/>
🎧 I didn't know that first started with workers in the textile industry.<br/>
🎧 With those protesting workers called the Luddites<br/>
🎧 destroying their knitting machines because they were so worried about losing their jobs.<br/>
🎧 Yes, and ultimately, they didn't achieve anything.<br/>
🎧 And anyway, industrialisation created more jobs than it destroyed.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's true,<br/>
🎧 but it probably didn't seem a positive thing at the time.<br/>
🎧 I can see why the Luddites felt so threatened.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure I would have felt the same.<br/>
🎧 The discussion about the future of work was really optimistic for a change.<br/>
🎧 I like the idea that work won't involve doing boring, repetitive tasks,<br/>
🎧 as robots will do all that.<br/>
🎧 Normally, you only hear negative stuff about the future.<br/>
🎧 Bit too optimistic, don't you think?<br/>
🎧 For example, I can't see how people are about to have more leisure time,<br/>
🎧 when all the evidence shows people are spending longer than ever at work.<br/>
🎧 No, that's true.<br/>
🎧 And what about lower unemployment?<br/>
🎧 I'm not so sure about that.<br/>
🎧 Perhaps in the long term,<br/>
🎧 but not in the foreseeable future.<br/>
🎧 And I expect most people will be expected to work until they're much older<br/>
🎧 as everyone's living much longer.<br/>
🎧 That's already happening.<br/>
🎧 I enjoyed all that stuff on how technology's changed some jobs<br/>
🎧 and how they're likely to change in the near future.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, incredible.<br/>
🎧 Like accountants.<br/>
🎧 You might think all the technological innovations would have put them out of a job,<br/>
🎧 but in fact there are more of them than ever.<br/>
🎧 They're still really in demand and have become far more efficient.<br/>
🎧 Right. That was amazing.<br/>
🎧 Twenty times more accountants in this country compared to the 19th century.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 I'd never have thought that demand for hairdressing would have gone up so much in the last hundred years.<br/>
🎧 One hairdresser for every 287 people now,<br/>
🎧 compared to one for over 1,500.<br/>
🎧 Yeah because people's earning power has gone up so they can afford to spend more on personal services like that.<br/>
🎧 But technology hasn't changed the actual job that much.<br/>
🎧 No, they've got hairdryers, etc.<br/>
🎧 but it's one job where you don't depend on a computer...<br/>
🎧 The kind of work that administrative staff do has changed enormously, thanks to technology.<br/>
🎧 Even 20 years ago there were secretaries doing dictation and typing.<br/>
🎧 Yes. Really boring compared to these days,<br/>
🎧 when they're given much more responsibility and higher status.<br/>
🎧 A lot of graduates go in for this kind of work now...<br/>
🎧 I'd expected there to be a much bigger change in the number of agricultural workers in the 19th century.<br/>
🎧 But the 1871 census showed that roughly 25% of the population worked on the land.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I'd have assumed it would be more than 50%.<br/>
🎧 Now it's less than 0.2%.<br/>
🎧 Hmm... What about care workers?<br/>
🎧 They barely existed in the 19th century<br/>
🎧 as people's lifespan was so much shorter.<br/>
🎧 But now of course this sector will see huge growth.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, and it's hard enough to meet current demand.<br/>
🎧 The future looks quite bleak for bank clerks.<br/>
🎧 They've been in decline since ATMs were introduced in the 80s.<br/>
🎧 And technology will certainly make most of the jobs they do now redundant, I think.<br/>
🎧 I agree, although the situation may change.<br/>
🎧 It's very hard to predict what will happen.<br/>

🎧 In today's astronomy lecture,<br/>
🎧 I'm going to talk about the need for a system to manage the movement of satellites<br/>
🎧 and other objects in orbit around the Earth.<br/>
🎧 In other words, a Space Traffic Management system.<br/>
🎧 We already have effective Air Traffic Control systems<br/>
🎧 that are used internationally to ensure that planes navigate our skies safely.<br/>
🎧 Well, Space Traffic Management is a similar concept,<br/>
🎧 but focusing on the control of satellites.<br/>
🎧 The aim of such a system would be to prevent the danger of collisions in space<br/>
🎧 between the objects in orbit around the Earth.<br/>
🎧 In order to do this, we'd need to have a set of legal measures,<br/>
🎧 and we'd also have to develop the technical systems to enable us to prevent such accidents.<br/>
🎧 But unfortunately, at present we don't actually have a Space Traffic Management system that works.<br/>
🎧 So why not?<br/>
🎧 What are the problems in developing such a system?<br/>
🎧 Well, for one thing, satellites are relatively cheap these days,<br/>
🎧 compared with how they were in the past,<br/>
🎧 meaning that more people can afford to put them into space.<br/>
🎧 So there's a lot more of them out there,<br/>
🎧 and people aren't just launching single satellites<br/>
🎧 but whole constellations, consisting of thousands of them designed to work together.<br/>
🎧 So space is getting more crowded every day.<br/>
🎧 But in spite of this, one thing you may be surprised to learn<br/>
🎧 is that you can launch a satellite into space<br/>
🎧 and, once it's out there, it doesn't have to send back any information to Earth to allow its identification.<br/>
🎧 So while we have international systems for ensuring we know where the planes in our skies are,<br/>
🎧 and to prevent them from colliding with one another,<br/>
🎧 when it comes to the safety of satellites,<br/>
🎧 at present we don't have anything like enough proper ways of tracking them.<br/>
🎧 And it isn't just entire satellites that we need to consider.<br/>
🎧 A greater threat is the huge amount of space debris in orbit around the Earth -<br/>
🎧 broken bits of satellite and junk from space stations and so on.<br/>
🎧 And some of these are so small that they can be very hard to identify,<br/>
🎧 but they can still be very dangerous.<br/>
🎧 In addition, some operators may be unwilling to share information about the satellites they've launched.<br/>
🎧 For example, a satellite may be designed for military purposes,<br/>
🎧 or it may have been launched for commercial reasons,<br/>
🎧 and the operators don't want competitors to have information about it.<br/>
🎧 And even if the operators are willing to provide it,<br/>
🎧 the information isn't easy to collect.<br/>
🎧 Details are needed about the object itself,<br/>
🎧 as well as about its location at a particular time -<br/>
🎧 and remember that a satellite isn't very big,<br/>
🎧 and it's likely to be moving at thousands of kilometres an hour.<br/>
🎧 We don't have any sensors that can constantly follow something moving so fast,<br/>
🎧 so all that the scientists can do is to put forward a prediction concerning where the satellite is heading next.<br/>
🎧 So those are some of the problems that we're facing.<br/>
🎧 Let's consider now some of the solutions that have been suggested.<br/>
🎧 One key issue is the way in which information is dealt with.<br/>
🎧 We need more information,<br/>
🎧 but it also needs to be accessible at a global level,<br/>
🎧 so we need to establish shared standards that we can all agree on<br/>
🎧 for the way in which this information is presented.<br/>
🎧 We already do this in other areas of science,<br/>
🎧 so although this is a challenge, it's not an impossible task.<br/>
🎧 Then, as all this information's collected,<br/>
🎧 it needs to be put together so it can be used,<br/>
🎧 and that will involve creating a single database on which it can be entered.<br/>
🎧 As we continue to push forward new developments,<br/>
🎧 congestion of the space environment is only going to increase.<br/>
🎧 To cope with this, we need to develop a system like the one I've described<br/>
🎧 to coordinate the work of the numerous spacecraft operators,<br/>
🎧 but it's also essential that this system is one that establishes trust in the people that use it,<br/>
🎧 both nationally and at a global level.<br/>
🎧 One interesting development...<br/>
<br/><br/>
