🎧 Hello, <span>Wayside</span> <span>Camera</span> <span>Club</span>, <span>Breda</span> <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, hello, <span>um</span>, my <span>name's</span> <span>Dan</span> and I'd like to join your <span>club</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's great, <span>Dan</span>.<br/>
🎧 We have an <span>application</span> <span>form</span>,<br/>
🎧 would you like to <span>complete</span> it over the phone,<br/>
🎧 then you can ask any <span>questions</span> you might have?<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes, thanks.<br/>
🎧 OK, so what's your <span>family</span> name?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>Green</span>, <span>Dan</span> <span>Green</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, can I take your <span>email</span> <span>address</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's <span>dan1068@market.com</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 And what about your home <span>address</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm about ten <span>miles</span> away from your <span>club</span> in <span>Peacetown</span>.<br/>
🎧 I live in a house there.<br/>
🎧 OK, so what's the house number and <span>street</span>?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>52</span> <span>Marrowfield</span> <span>Street</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is that <span>M-A-R-R-O-W-F-I-E-L-D</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 <span>...and</span> that's <span>Peacetown</span>, you said?<br/>
🎧 So how did you hear about our <span>club</span>?<br/>
🎧 Did you look on the <span>internet</span>?<br/>
🎧 I usually do that, but this <span>time..</span>.<br/>
🎧 well, I was talking to a <span>relative</span> the other day and he <span>suggested</span> it.<br/>
🎧 Oh, is he a <span>member</span> too?<br/>
🎧 He <span>belongs</span> to another <span>club</span>,<br/>
🎧 but he'd heard good things about <span>yours</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So what do you hope to get from <span>joining</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, one thing that really <span>interests</span> me is the <span>competitions</span> that you have.<br/>
🎧 I enjoy <span>entering</span> those.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Anything else?<br/>
🎧 Well, I also like to <span>socialise</span> with other <span>photographers</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's great.<br/>
🎧 So what <span>type</span> of <span>membership</span> would you like?<br/>
🎧 What are the options?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>£30</span> a year for full <span>membership<br/></span>
🎧 or <span>£20</span> a year if you're an <span>associate</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think I'll go for the full <span>membership</span>, then.<br/>
🎧 That's a good <span>idea<br/></span>
🎧 because you can't <span>vote</span> in <span>meetings</span> with an <span>associate</span> <span>membership</span>.<br/>
🎧 If I could just find out a bit more about <span>you..</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So you said you wanted to <span>compete</span>,<br/>
🎧 have you ever <span>won</span> any <span>photography</span> <span>competitions</span>?<br/>
🎧 Not yet, but I have <span>entered</span> <span>three</span> in the <span>past</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 So why don't you tell me something about those?<br/>
🎧 Let's start with the first one.<br/>
🎧 Well, the <span>theme</span> was <span>entitled</span> <span>'Domestic</span> <span>Life'</span>.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 So it had to be something <span>related</span> to the home?<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 I <span>chose</span> to take a <span>photo</span> of a <span>family</span> <span>sitting</span> <span>round</span> the dinner <span>table</span> having a <span>meal</span>,<br/>
🎧 and, <span>urn</span>, I didn't win, but I did get some <span>feedback</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, what did the <span>judges</span> say?<br/>
🎧 That it was too <span>'busy'</span> as a <span>picture</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Aha</span>, so it was the <span>composition</span> of the <span>picture</span> that they <span>criticised</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's right, and once they'd told me that, I could see my <span>mistake</span>.<br/>
🎧 So what was the <span>theme</span> of the second <span>composition</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, my university was on the <span>coast<br/></span>
🎧 and that <span>area</span> <span>gets</span> a lot of <span>beautiful</span> <span>sunsets<br/></span>
🎧 so that was the <span>theme</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, <span>sunsets</span>, that's a great <span>theme</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 The <span>instructions</span> were to <span>capture</span> the <span>clouds</span> as well,<br/>
🎧 it couldn't just be <span>blue</span> sky and a <span>setting</span> sun.<br/>
🎧 Sure, <span>'cause</span> they give you all those amazing <span>pinks</span> and <span>purples</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, and I thought I'd done that well,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>feedback</span> was that I should have <span>waited</span> a bit <span>longer</span> to get the <span>shot</span>.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 So the <span>timing</span> wasn't right.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I took it too soon, <span>basically</span>.<br/>
🎧 And then the <span>third</span> <span>competition</span> I <span>entered</span> was called <span>'Animal</span> <span>Magic'</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's a <span>difficult</span> <span>subject</span>!<br/>
🎧 I know!<br/>
🎧 I had to take <span>hundreds</span> of <span>shots</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure, because <span>animals</span> move all the time.<br/>
🎧 That's what we had to show,<br/>
🎧 there had to be some <span>movements</span> in the <span>scene</span>.<br/>
🎧 I got a great <span>shot</span> of a fox in the end,<br/>
🎧 but I took it at <span>night</span> <span>and..</span>.<br/>
🎧 well, I <span>suspected</span> that it was a bit <span>dark</span> which is what I was told.<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>Dan</span>, you <span>seem</span> to be really <span>keen</span> and we'd be <span>delighted</span> to have you in our <span>club</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure we can help with all those <span>areas</span> that you've <span>outlined</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks, that's great.<br/>

🎧 This <span>evening</span> we're <span>delighted</span> to <span>welcome</span> <span>Dan</span> <span>Beagle</span>,<br/>
🎧 who's just <span>written</span> a book on looking for and <span>finding</span> food in the <span>wild</span>.<br/>
🎧 He's going to tell us everything we need to know about <span>picking</span> <span>wild</span> <span>mushrooms</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you very much.<br/>
🎧 Well, I need to start by talking about <span>safety</span>.<br/>
🎧 You really need to know what you're doing because some <span>mushrooms</span> are <span>extremely</span> <span>poisonous</span>.<br/>
🎧 Having said that, once you know what to look for,<br/>
🎧 it's really <span>worth</span> doing for the amazing <span>variety</span> of <span>mushrooms</span> <span>available</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 which you can't get in the <span>shops</span>.<br/>
🎧 But of course, you have to be very <span>careful<br/></span>
🎧 and that's why I always say you should never <span>consume</span> <span>mushrooms</span> <span>picked</span> by friends or <span>neighbours</span>.<br/>
🎧 Always remember that some <span>poisonous</span> <span>mushrooms</span> look very <span>similar</span> to <span>edible</span> <span>ones<br/></span>
🎧 and it's easy for people to get <span>confused</span>.<br/>
🎧 The other thing to <span>avoid</span> is <span>mushrooms</span> <span>growing</span> <span>beside</span> <span>busy</span> <span>roads</span> for <span>obvious</span> <span>reasons</span>.<br/>
🎧 But <span>nothing</span> <span>beats</span> the <span>taste</span> of <span>freshly</span> <span>picked</span> <span>mushrooms</span>.<br/>
🎧 Don't <span>forget</span> that the <span>ones</span> in the <span>shops</span> are often <span>several</span> <span>days</span> old and <span>past</span> their best.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>certain</span> <span>ideas</span> about <span>wild</span> <span>mushrooms</span> that it's important to be <span>aware</span> of.<br/>
🎧 Don't listen to people who tell you that it's only OK to eat <span>mushrooms</span> that are <span>pale</span> or <span>dull</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is <span>completely</span> <span>untrue</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>edible</span> <span>mushrooms</span> are <span>bright</span> red, for example.<br/>
🎧 <span>Personally</span>, I <span>prefer</span> <span>mushrooms</span> <span>cooked<br/></span>
🎧 but it won't do you any <span>harm</span> to eat them <span>uncooked</span> in <span>salads</span>,<br/>
🎧 it's not <span>necessary</span> to <span>peel</span> them.<br/>
🎧 Another thing you should remember is that you can't tell if a <span>mushroom</span> is <span>safe</span> to eat by its <span>smell</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some of the most <span>deadly</span> <span>mushrooms</span> have no <span>smell</span> and <span>taste</span> quite nice, <span>apparently</span>.<br/>
🎧 Finally, just because <span>deer</span> or <span>squirrels</span> eat a <span>particular</span> <span>mushroom</span> doesn't mean that you can.<br/>
🎧 Of course, <span>mushroom</span> <span>picking</span> is <span>associated</span> with the <span>countryside<br/></span>
🎧 but if you haven't got a car, your <span>local</span> <span>park</span> can be a great place to start.<br/>
🎧 There are usually a <span>range</span> of <span>habitats</span> where <span>mushrooms</span> <span>grow</span>,<br/>
🎧 such as playing <span>fields</span> and <span>wooded</span> <span>areas</span>.<br/>
🎧 But you need to be there first thing in the morning,<br/>
🎧 as there's <span>likely</span> to be a lot of <span>competition</span>,<br/>
🎧 not just from people but <span>wildlife</span> too.<br/>
🎧 The <span>deer</span> often get the best <span>mushrooms</span> in my <span>local</span> <span>park</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you're a <span>complete</span> <span>beginner</span>,<br/>
🎧 I wouldn't <span>recommend</span> going <span>alone</span> or <span>relying</span> on <span>photos</span> in a book,<br/>
🎧 even the one I've <span>written</span>!<br/>
🎧 There are some really good phone <span>apps</span> for <span>identifying</span> <span>mushrooms</span>,<br/>
🎧 but you can't always <span>rely</span> on getting a good <span>signal</span> in the <span>middle</span> of a <span>wood</span>.<br/>
🎧 If <span>possible</span>, you should go with a group <span>led</span> by an <span>expert</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll <span>stay</span> <span>safe</span> and learn a lot that way.<br/>
🎧 <span>Conservation</span> is a really important <span>consideration<br/></span>
🎧 and you must <span>follow</span> a few <span>basic</span> <span>rules</span>.<br/>
🎧 You should never <span>pick</span> all the <span>mushrooms</span> in one <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Collect</span> only enough for your own needs.<br/>
🎧 Be very <span>careful</span> that you don't <span>trample</span> on young <span>mushrooms</span> or other <span>plants</span>.<br/>
🎧 And make sure you don't <span>pick</span> any <span>mushrooms</span> that are <span>endangered</span> and <span>protected</span> by law.<br/>
🎧 There's been a <span>decline</span> in some <span>varieties</span> of <span>wild</span> <span>mushrooms</span> in this <span>part</span> of the <span>country</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Restaurants</span> are <span>becoming</span> more interested in <span>locally</span> <span>sourced</span> food like <span>wild</span> <span>mushrooms</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>biggest</span> <span>problem</span> is that so many new <span>houses</span> have been <span>built</span> in this <span>area</span> in the last ten years.<br/>
🎧 And more water is being taken from <span>rivers</span> and <span>reservoirs</span> because of this,<br/>
🎧 and <span>mushroom</span> <span>habitats</span> have been <span>destroyed</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, a <span>word</span> of advice on <span>storing</span> <span>mushrooms</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Collect</span> them in a <span>brown</span> <span>paper</span> <span>bag<br/></span>
🎧 and as soon as you get home, put them in the <span>fridge</span>.<br/>
🎧 They'll be fine for a <span>couple</span> of <span>days</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it's best to <span>cook</span> them as soon as <span>possible<br/></span>
🎧 after <span>washing</span> them really <span>carefully</span> first, of course.<br/>
🎧 So <span>everybody</span> <span>knows</span> what a <span>mushroom</span> <span>tastes</span> like, right?<br/>
🎧 Well, you'll be <span>surprised</span> by the <span>huge</span> <span>variety</span> of <span>wild</span> <span>mushrooms</span> there are.<br/>
🎧 Be <span>adventurous</span>!<br/>
🎧 They're great in so many <span>dishes</span>:<br/>
🎧 <span>stir</span> <span>fries</span>, <span>risottos</span>, <span>pasta</span>.<br/>
🎧 But just be <span>aware</span> that some people can <span>react</span> <span>badly</span> to <span>certain</span> <span>varieties<br/></span>
🎧 so it's a good idea not to eat <span>huge</span> <span>quantities</span> to <span>begin</span> with.<br/>
🎧 OK, so now I'm going to show <span>you..</span>.<br/>

🎧 That <span>seminar</span> <span>yesterday</span> on <span>automation</span> and the future of work was really good, wasn't it?<br/>
🎧 Looking at the first <span>industrial</span> <span>revolution</span> in <span>Britain</span> in the <span>19th</span> <span>century<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>seeing</span> how people <span>reacted</span> to <span>massive</span> change was a <span>real</span> eye <span>opener</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>interesting</span> to hear how people <span>felt</span> about <span>automation</span> <span>then<br/></span>
🎧 and what <span>challenges</span> they <span>faced</span>.<br/>
🎧 I didn't know that first <span>started</span> with <span>workers</span> in the <span>textile</span> <span>industry</span>.<br/>
🎧 With those <span>protesting</span> <span>workers</span> called the <span>Luddites<br/></span>
🎧 <span>destroying</span> their <span>knitting</span> <span>machines</span> because they were so <span>worried</span> about <span>losing</span> their <span>jobs</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, and <span>ultimately</span>, they didn't <span>achieve</span> anything.<br/>
🎧 And <span>anyway</span>, <span>industrialisation</span> <span>created</span> more <span>jobs</span> than it <span>destroyed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's <span>true</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it probably didn't <span>seem</span> a <span>positive</span> thing at the time.<br/>
🎧 I can see why the <span>Luddites</span> <span>felt</span> so <span>threatened</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure I would have <span>felt</span> the same.<br/>
🎧 The <span>discussion</span> about the future of work was really <span>optimistic</span> for a change.<br/>
🎧 I like the idea that work won't <span>involve</span> doing <span>boring</span>, <span>repetitive</span> <span>tasks</span>,<br/>
🎧 as <span>robots</span> will do all that.<br/>
🎧 <span>Normally</span>, you only hear <span>negative</span> <span>stuff</span> about the future.<br/>
🎧 Bit too <span>optimistic</span>, don't you think?<br/>
🎧 For example, I can't see how people are about to have more <span>leisure</span> time,<br/>
🎧 when all the <span>evidence</span> <span>shows</span> people are spending <span>longer</span> than ever at work.<br/>
🎧 No, that's <span>true</span>.<br/>
🎧 And what about <span>lower</span> <span>unemployment</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm not so sure about that.<br/>
🎧 <span>Perhaps</span> in the long <span>term</span>,<br/>
🎧 but not in the <span>foreseeable</span> future.<br/>
🎧 And I <span>expect</span> most people will be <span>expected</span> to work until they're much <span>older<br/></span>
🎧 as <span>everyone's</span> living much <span>longer</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's already <span>happening</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>enjoyed</span> all that <span>stuff</span> on how <span>technology's</span> <span>changed</span> some <span>jobs<br/></span>
🎧 and how they're <span>likely</span> to change in the near future.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, <span>incredible</span>.<br/>
🎧 Like <span>accountants</span>.<br/>
🎧 You might think all the <span>technological</span> <span>innovations</span> would have put them out of a <span>job</span>,<br/>
🎧 but in <span>fact</span> there are more of them than ever.<br/>
🎧 They're still really in <span>demand</span> and have become <span>far</span> more <span>efficient</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right. That was amazing.<br/>
🎧 <span>Twenty</span> <span>times</span> more <span>accountants</span> in this <span>country</span> <span>compared</span> to the <span>19th</span> <span>century</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 I'd never have thought that <span>demand</span> for <span>hairdressing</span> would have <span>gone</span> up so much in the last <span>hundred</span> years.<br/>
🎧 One <span>hairdresser</span> for every <span>287</span> people now,<br/>
🎧 <span>compared</span> to one for over <span>1,500</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah because <span>people's</span> <span>earning</span> <span>power</span> has <span>gone</span> up so they can <span>afford</span> to <span>spend</span> more on personal <span>services</span> like that.<br/>
🎧 But <span>technology</span> hasn't <span>changed</span> the <span>actual</span> <span>job</span> that much.<br/>
🎧 No, <span>they've</span> got <span>hairdryers</span>, <span>etc</span>.<br/>
🎧 but it's one <span>job</span> where you don't <span>depend</span> on a <span>computer..</span>.<br/>
🎧 The kind of work that <span>administrative</span> <span>staff</span> do has <span>changed</span> <span>enormously</span>, thanks to <span>technology</span>.<br/>
🎧 Even <span>20</span> years ago there were <span>secretaries</span> doing <span>dictation</span> and <span>typing</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes. Really <span>boring</span> <span>compared</span> to these <span>days</span>,<br/>
🎧 when they're <span>given</span> much more <span>responsibility</span> and <span>higher</span> <span>status</span>.<br/>
🎧 A lot of <span>graduates</span> go in for this kind of work <span>now..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd <span>expected</span> there to be a much <span>bigger</span> change in the number of <span>agricultural</span> <span>workers</span> in the <span>19th</span> <span>century</span>.<br/>
🎧 But the <span>1871</span> <span>census</span> <span>showed</span> that <span>roughly</span> <span>25%</span> of the <span>population</span> <span>worked</span> on the <span>land</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I'd have <span>assumed</span> it would be more than <span>50%</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now it's less than <span>0.2%</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm..</span>. What about <span>care</span> <span>workers</span>?<br/>
🎧 They <span>barely</span> <span>existed</span> in the <span>19th</span> <span>century<br/></span>
🎧 as <span>people's</span> <span>lifespan</span> was so much <span>shorter</span>.<br/>
🎧 But now of course this <span>sector</span> will see <span>huge</span> <span>growth</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, and it's <span>hard</span> enough to meet <span>current</span> <span>demand</span>.<br/>
🎧 The future looks quite <span>bleak</span> for <span>bank</span> <span>clerks</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>They've</span> been in <span>decline</span> since <span>ATMs</span> were <span>introduced</span> in the <span>80s</span>.<br/>
🎧 And <span>technology</span> will <span>certainly</span> make most of the <span>jobs</span> they do now <span>redundant</span>, I think.<br/>
🎧 I agree, although the <span>situation</span> may change.<br/>
🎧 It's very <span>hard</span> to <span>predict</span> what will <span>happen</span>.<br/>

🎧 I'm going to talk about the need for a <span>system</span> to <span>manage</span> the <span>movement</span> of <span>satellites<br/></span>
🎧 and other <span>objects</span> in <span>orbit</span> around the <span>Earth</span>.<br/>
🎧 In other <span>words</span>, a <span>Space</span> <span>Traffic</span> <span>Management</span> <span>system</span>.<br/>
🎧 We already have <span>effective</span> Air <span>Traffic</span> <span>Control</span> <span>systems<br/></span>
🎧 that are used <span>internationally</span> to <span>ensure</span> that <span>planes</span> <span>navigate</span> our <span>skies</span> <span>safely</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>Space</span> <span>Traffic</span> <span>Management</span> is a <span>similar</span> <span>concept</span>,<br/>
🎧 but <span>focusing</span> on the <span>control</span> of <span>satellites</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>aim</span> of such a <span>system</span> would be to <span>prevent</span> the <span>danger</span> of <span>collisions</span> in <span>space<br/></span>
🎧 between the <span>objects</span> in <span>orbit</span> around the <span>Earth</span>.<br/>
🎧 In order to do this, we'd need to have a set of <span>legal</span> <span>measures</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we'd also have to <span>develop</span> the <span>technical</span> <span>systems</span> to <span>enable</span> us to <span>prevent</span> such <span>accidents</span>.<br/>
🎧 But <span>unfortunately</span>, at <span>present</span> we don't actually have a <span>Space</span> <span>Traffic</span> <span>Management</span> <span>system</span> that <span>works</span>.<br/>
🎧 So why not?<br/>
🎧 What are the <span>problems</span> in <span>developing</span> such a <span>system</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, for one thing, <span>satellites</span> are <span>relatively</span> <span>cheap</span> these <span>days</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>compared</span> with how they were in the <span>past</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>meaning</span> that more people can <span>afford</span> to put them into <span>space</span>.<br/>
🎧 So there's a lot more of them out there,<br/>
🎧 and people aren't just <span>launching</span> <span>single</span> <span>satellites<br/></span>
🎧 but whole <span>constellations</span>, <span>consisting</span> of <span>thousands</span> of them <span>designed</span> to work together.<br/>
🎧 So <span>space</span> is getting more <span>crowded</span> every day.<br/>
🎧 But in <span>spite</span> of this, one thing you may be <span>surprised</span> to <span>learn<br/></span>
🎧 is that you can <span>launch</span> a <span>satellite</span> into <span>space<br/></span>
🎧 and, once it's out there, it doesn't have to <span>send</span> back any <span>information</span> to <span>Earth</span> to <span>allow</span> its <span>identification</span>.<br/>
🎧 So while we have <span>international</span> <span>systems</span> for <span>ensuring</span> we know where the <span>planes</span> in our <span>skies</span> are,<br/>
🎧 and to <span>prevent</span> them from <span>colliding</span> with one another,<br/>
🎧 when it comes to the <span>safety</span> of <span>satellites</span>,<br/>
🎧 at <span>present</span> we don't have anything like enough <span>proper</span> <span>ways</span> of <span>tracking</span> them.<br/>
🎧 And it isn't just <span>entire</span> <span>satellites</span> that we need to <span>consider</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>greater</span> <span>threat</span> is the <span>huge</span> amount of <span>space</span> <span>debris</span> in <span>orbit</span> around the <span>Earth</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>broken</span> <span>bits</span> of <span>satellite</span> and <span>junk</span> from <span>space</span> <span>stations</span> and so on.<br/>
🎧 And some of these are so small that they can be very <span>hard</span> to <span>identify</span>,<br/>
🎧 but they can still be very <span>dangerous</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>addition</span>, some <span>operators</span> may be <span>unwilling</span> to share <span>information</span> about the <span>satellites</span> <span>they've</span> <span>launched</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, a <span>satellite</span> may be <span>designed</span> for <span>military</span> <span>purposes</span>,<br/>
🎧 or it may have been <span>launched</span> for <span>commercial</span> <span>reasons</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>operators</span> don't want <span>competitors</span> to have <span>information</span> about it.<br/>
🎧 And even if the <span>operators</span> are <span>willing</span> to <span>provide</span> it,<br/>
🎧 the <span>information</span> isn't easy to <span>collect</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Details</span> are <span>needed</span> about the <span>object</span> <span>itself</span>,<br/>
🎧 as well as about its <span>location</span> at a <span>particular</span> time <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and remember that a <span>satellite</span> isn't very big,<br/>
🎧 and it's <span>likely</span> to be <span>moving</span> at <span>thousands</span> of <span>kilometres</span> an <span>hour</span>.<br/>
🎧 We don't have any <span>sensors</span> that can <span>constantly</span> <span>follow</span> something <span>moving</span> so <span>fast</span>,<br/>
🎧 so all that the <span>scientists</span> can do is to put forward a <span>prediction</span> <span>concerning</span> where the <span>satellite</span> is <span>heading</span> next.<br/>
🎧 So those are some of the <span>problems</span> that we're <span>facing</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's <span>consider</span> now some of the <span>solutions</span> that have been <span>suggested</span>.<br/>
🎧 One key issue is the way in which <span>information</span> is <span>dealt</span> with.<br/>
🎧 We need more <span>information</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it also needs to be <span>accessible</span> at a <span>global</span> <span>level</span>,<br/>
🎧 so we need to <span>establish</span> <span>shared</span> <span>standards</span> that we can all agree <span>on<br/></span>
🎧 for the way in which this <span>information</span> is <span>presented</span>.<br/>
🎧 We already do this in other <span>areas</span> of <span>science</span>,<br/>
🎧 so although this is a <span>challenge</span>, it's not an <span>impossible</span> <span>task</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then, as all this <span>information's</span> <span>collected</span>,<br/>
🎧 it needs to be put together so it can be used,<br/>
🎧 and that will <span>involve</span> <span>creating</span> a <span>single</span> <span>database</span> on which it can be <span>entered</span>.<br/>
🎧 As we <span>continue</span> to <span>push</span> forward new <span>developments</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>congestion</span> of the <span>space</span> <span>environment</span> is only going to <span>increase</span>.<br/>
🎧 To <span>cope</span> with this, we need to <span>develop</span> a <span>system</span> like the one I've <span>described<br/></span>
🎧 to <span>coordinate</span> the work of the <span>numerous</span> <span>spacecraft</span> <span>operators</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it's also <span>essential</span> that this <span>system</span> is one that <span>establishes</span> <span>trust</span> in the people that use it,<br/>
🎧 both <span>nationally</span> and at a <span>global</span> <span>level</span>.<br/>
🎧 One <span>interesting</span> <span>development..</span>.<br/>
