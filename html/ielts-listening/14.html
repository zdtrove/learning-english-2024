🎧 Good morning, <span>Synmouth</span> <span>Museum</span>. Can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes. Good morning.<br/>
🎧 I'm interested in the <span>children's</span> <span>workshops</span> and I'd like a little more <span>information</span>, please.<br/>
🎧 Do you mean the <span>Art</span> and <span>Craft</span> <span>workshops</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes. A friend of a friend <span>mentioned</span> them <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 the children do <span>painting</span> and make <span>models</span> and so <span>forth</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, of course.<br/>
🎧 <span>Um</span>, where to <span>begin</span>?<br/>
🎧 First of all, as you probably know, they run every <span>Saturday</span>.<br/>
🎧 Fine. And what about <span>ages</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, all <span>ages</span> from <span>five</span> <span>upwards</span> are <span>welcome</span>,<br/>
🎧 though we do ask that children <span>below</span> <span>eight</span> years of age are <span>accompanied</span> by an <span>adult</span>.<br/>
🎧 Fine. That wouldn't be a <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about <span>cost</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I think you'll find them very <span>reasonable</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>£2.50</span> a <span>child</span>,<br/>
🎧 with <span>80</span> <span>pence</span> off for two or more children from the same <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, very <span>reasonable</span>.<br/>
🎧 And are they <span>held</span> in the <span>main</span> <span>museum</span>?<br/>
🎧 Not exactly.<br/>
🎧 They're <span>nearby</span>.<br/>
🎧 Could you give me the full <span>address</span>?<br/>
🎧 I don't know the <span>area</span> very well.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's <span>Winter</span> House.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And that's in <span>Tamer</span> <span>Street</span>.<br/>
🎧 Could you <span>spell</span> that please?<br/>
🎧 Yes, <span>TAMER</span> <span>Street</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Lovely</span>.<br/>
🎧 And I do need to tell you that there's a <span>security</span> <span>entrance</span>,<br/>
🎧 so you need to <span>press</span> the <span>green</span> <span>button</span> for <span>someone</span> to let you in.<br/>
🎧 Don't <span>press</span> the red <span>button</span> please,<br/>
🎧 but don't <span>worry</span>, it's all <span>clearly</span> <span>labelled</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay. And one more <span>question</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 is <span>parking</span> <span>available</span> <span>nearby</span>?<br/>
🎧 We're driving in from out of <span>town</span>.<br/>
🎧 Your best bet is to leave your car at the back of the <span>library</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 on a <span>Saturday</span> morning, there are <span>plenty</span> of <span>spaces</span> there.<br/>
🎧 It's right next <span>door</span> to the <span>museum</span>.<br/>
🎧 And can I ask about <span>booking</span> <span>places</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, and I must tell you, you really should book by <span>calling</span> the <span>education</span> <span>department</span> here.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I'm sorry, should I have <span>rung</span> them <span>instead</span> of the <span>main</span> <span>museum</span> number?<br/>
🎧 No, that's fine this time, please don't <span>worry</span>.<br/>
🎧 But for future <span>reference</span>, I'll give you the <span>direct</span> number.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>200765</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great, I've got that.<br/>
🎧 But I'm very happy to give you <span>information</span> about the next two <span>workshops</span>.<br/>
🎧 On <span>Saturday</span> the <span>16th</span>, there's <span>Building</span> <span>Castles</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, sounds great!<br/>
🎧 This <span>involves</span> quite a bit of <span>glue</span>, so just make sure the <span>kids</span> are in old <span>clothes</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know, <span>ones</span> I don't <span>mind</span> getting <span>mucky</span>.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 And if <span>possible</span>, could you <span>bring</span> along <span>bottle</span> <span>tops<br/></span>
🎧 which the children might be able to use in the <span>models</span>, you know, as <span>decoration</span>?<br/>
🎧 We'll <span>certainly</span> try to find some for you.<br/>
🎧 Then the <span>following</span> <span>week..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>That'll</span> be the <span>23rd</span>, won't it?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's right.<br/>
🎧 On that day, it's what we call <span>Undersea</span> <span>Worlds</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is where they make <span>scenes</span> with <span>fishes</span>, <span>underground</span> <span>caverns</span> and so on.<br/>
🎧 Is that <span>likely</span> to get very <span>dirty</span>?<br/>
🎧 Lots of <span>paint</span> <span>splashes</span>?<br/>
🎧 Not really, so we don't <span>recommend</span> any special <span>clothes</span> for that one.<br/>
🎧 But if you could <span>search</span> out some <span>silver</span> <span>paper</span> to <span>bring</span> along to use in the <span>sessions</span>,<br/>
🎧 you know, it's <span>shiny</span> <span>-</span> it looks like water, that'd be great.<br/>
🎧 Yes, of course. We'll see what we can come up with.<br/>
🎧 Well, thank you ever so much for all your help.<br/>
🎧 The <span>sessions</span> sound really good and I'll <span>certainly</span> book up for the next two.<br/>
🎧 <span>Lovely</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks very much for <span>ringing</span>.<br/>
🎧 Bye.<br/>
🎧 <span>Bye-bye</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Hello.<br/>
🎧 <span>Um..</span>. my <span>family</span> and I are <span>staying</span> here in <span>Trebirch</span> for a week or <span>two<br/></span>
🎧 and we wanted to know about the <span>train</span> <span>services</span>.<br/>
🎧 We're <span>hoping</span> to do a few <span>local</span> <span>trips</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Well, I can give you lots of <span>details</span> about all the <span>trains</span> going from <span>Trebirch</span> in the <span>South</span> <span>West</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>leaflet</span> will be very <span>helpful<br/></span>
🎧 but I can tell you some of the <span>main</span> things.<br/>
🎧 We've got two <span>main</span> <span>train</span> <span>stations</span> in the <span>town</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>King</span> <span>Street</span> is for <span>local</span> <span>commuter</span> <span>lines</span> and <span>regional</span> <span>services</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about <span>trains</span> to <span>London</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'll need to go there on <span>business</span> for one day.<br/>
🎧 Then you need to go to <span>Central</span> <span>Station</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 that's for all the <span>national</span> <span>services</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>regular</span> <span>trains</span> to <span>London</span>.<br/>
🎧 They leave <span>Trebirch</span> every <span>half</span> <span>hour</span> on <span>weekdays</span> and every <span>hour</span> at <span>weekends</span>.<br/>
🎧 It takes about two hours, a bit <span>longer</span> on <span>Sundays</span>.<br/>
🎧 You've got a <span>choice</span> of first and second class and there's a <span>buffet</span> car <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 though <span>refreshments</span> are <span>included</span> in the <span>cost</span> of a first class <span>ticket</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ah, right.<br/>
🎧 <span>Um</span>, and have you got any <span>information</span> on different <span>ticket</span> <span>types</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>range</span> of <span>ticket</span> <span>prices</span> <span>depending</span> on when you travel and when you buy your <span>ticket</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>standard</span> open <span>ticket</span> which doesn't have any <span>restrictions</span>.<br/>
🎧 This can be <span>bought</span> in <span>advance</span> or on the day.<br/>
🎧 You can also get <span>various</span> <span>discounted</span> <span>tickets</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>popular</span> one is called the <span>Supersave<br/></span>
🎧 and, <span>er</span>, this is OK for travel after <span>8.45</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then there is the Special <span>ticket</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is <span>valid</span> for travel after <span>10:15</span>.<br/>
🎧 The Special <span>tickets</span> are also <span>valid</span> for travel at <span>weekends</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>cheapest</span> <span>tickets</span> are called <span>Advance<br/></span>
🎧 and you have to buy them at <span>least</span> six <span>days</span> ahead.<br/>
🎧 Only a <span>certain</span> number are <span>available<br/></span>
🎧 and you have to make <span>seat</span> <span>reservations</span> for these.<br/>
🎧 Thanks. And are there lots of <span>places</span> to go to around here?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes.<br/>
🎧 You can enjoy many <span>days</span> out.<br/>
🎧 <span>Um</span> there's the <span>Merthyr</span> <span>Mining</span> <span>Museum</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is only <span>half</span> an <span>hour</span> from <span>Trebirch</span> by <span>train</span>.<br/>
🎧 Your children will find it just as <span>fascinating</span> as any <span>theme</span> <span>park<br/></span>
🎧 and they can <span>ride</span> in the <span>original</span> <span>miners'</span> <span>lifts</span> and on the <span>coal</span> <span>trains</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are special <span>excursion</span> <span>tickets</span> which <span>include</span> <span>entrance</span> <span>fees</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mainline</span> <span>trains</span> also <span>offer</span> <span>direct</span> <span>services</span> to <span>Bristol</span>,<br/>
🎧 where you can visit the <span>docks</span> or <span>spend</span> a great day out with the children in the zoo,<br/>
🎧 which is set in the <span>parkland</span> that used to <span>surround</span> the old <span>castle</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Er</span>, special <span>family</span> <span>awayday</span> <span>fares</span> are <span>available</span> for this <span>service</span> now during the school <span>holidays</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Er</span>, <span>alternatively</span>, you can be in <span>Birmingham</span> in only an <span>hour</span> and a <span>half</span>,<br/>
🎧 where there's lots to see and do <span>including</span> the new and <span>internationally-acclaimed</span> <span>climbing</span> <span>wall<br/></span>
🎧 <span>built</span> on the <span>site</span> of the old <span>aquarium</span>.<br/>
🎧 We will also be <span>running</span> a special <span>service</span> to <span>Newport<br/></span>
🎧 when the new <span>science</span> <span>museum</span> <span>opens</span> next year,<br/>
🎧 as we <span>anticipate</span> a lot of <span>visitors</span> in the <span>opening</span> <span>weeks</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd <span>advise</span> you to call <span>early</span> to book your <span>tickets</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is that OK?<br/>
🎧 Yes, thanks.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Hello, <span>Sandy</span>.<br/>
🎧 How have you been getting on with your <span>dissertation</span>?<br/>
🎧 Fine, and I've been working <span>hard</span> on the <span>various</span> <span>action</span> <span>points</span> we agreed on our last <span>tutorial</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you want to talk me through what you've done?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, sure.<br/>
🎧 Well, we agreed on <span>three</span> <span>main</span> <span>targets</span> for me to <span>aim</span> for.<br/>
🎧 The first one was to find out about <span>suitable</span> <span>data</span> <span>analysis</span> <span>software</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 And what I <span>decided</span> to do was to look through <span>catalogues</span> <span>specialising</span> in IT.<br/>
🎧 That's a good idea.<br/>
🎧 What did you come up with?<br/>
🎧 I <span>found</span> the <span>names</span> of two <span>promising</span> <span>ones</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 But I also thought it'd be <span>worthwhile</span> talking to a <span>lecturer</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh right.<br/>
🎧 Who did you see?<br/>
🎧 <span>Jane</span> <span>Prince</span>. Do you know her?<br/>
🎧 She's in the <span>Computer</span> <span>Centre</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, of course, she's the new <span>Head</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes. Well, she was very <span>helpful</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's good.<br/>
🎧 Did she <span>suggest</span> anything in <span>particular</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah. She <span>recommended</span> <span>software</span> called <span>Vivat<br/></span>
🎧 and said I should book up for a <span>couple</span> of practice <span>sessions</span> <span>using</span> <span>Vivat</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great. I'm sure you'll find them useful.<br/>
🎧 And, of course, the second <span>target</span> was to <span>draw</span> up a <span>survey</span> <span>checklist..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, you <span>emailed</span> me it last week.<br/>
🎧 Have you had a <span>chance</span> to <span>look...</span>?<br/>
🎧 Of course,<br/>
🎧 <span>um</span>, I think it's good.<br/>
🎧 Very much on the right <span>lines</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd say your first two <span>sections</span> are <span>spot</span> on.<br/>
🎧 I wouldn't <span>suggest</span> that you change anything there, <span>but..</span>.<br/>
🎧 in <span>section</span> <span>three</span> you really do need to have <span>questions</span> on <span>teaching</span> <span>experience</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. I was thinking that <span>section</span> <span>looked</span> a bit short.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And my <span>third</span> <span>target</span> was, do <span>further</span> <span>reading</span> on <span>discipline</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes. I <span>mentioned</span> a <span>couple</span> of <span>writers</span>, didn't I?<br/>
🎧 Yes, well, I got <span>hold</span> of the <span>Banerjee</span> and I thought that was <span>excellent</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I'm <span>afraid</span> I didn't <span>manage</span> to get <span>hold</span> of the <span>essays</span> about <span>classroom</span> <span>management</span>,<br/>
🎧 you know, the <span>ones</span> by <span>Simon</span> <span>Ericsson</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>bookshop</span> said it was out of <span>print</span> and the <span>library</span> doesn't have a <span>copy</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh right, and I'm <span>afraid</span> I've <span>lent</span> my <span>copy</span> to another student.<br/>
🎧 What I <span>suggest</span> you do is try the <span>library</span> again <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 this time <span>apply</span> for it through the <span>service</span> called special <span>loans</span>.<br/>
🎧 Have you done that before?<br/>
🎧 You're <span>entitled</span> to six books a year.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 No <span>problem</span>. That's what I'll do.<br/>
🎧 So, lots of useful work done.<br/>
🎧 So, let's look at some new <span>targets</span>.<br/>
🎧 We'll start by having a <span>chat</span> about your <span>Chapter</span> One.<br/>
🎧 I very much <span>enjoyed</span> <span>reading</span> it.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>written</span> <span>style</span> is very <span>clear<br/></span>
🎧 and you've <span>included</span> lots of <span>interesting</span> <span>descriptions</span> of <span>education</span> in your <span>target</span> <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've just got a <span>couple</span> of <span>suggestions</span> for some <span>additional</span> work.<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 Could I just ask <span>-</span> what do you think I should call it?<br/>
🎧 Well, I'd go for something like <span>Context</span> <span>Review</span>.<br/>
🎧 What do you think?<br/>
🎧 Well, short and to the <span>point</span>.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 Now, as <span>regards</span> <span>specific</span> <span>areas</span> to work on,<br/>
🎧 I'd be quite interested to have a few more <span>statistics</span> about the <span>schools</span> in the different <span>zones</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that wouldn't be a <span>problem</span>. I can get them from the <span>Internet</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great,<br/>
🎧 and although you did make a <span>reference</span> to quite a few different <span>writers</span>,<br/>
🎧 I think you should <span>aim</span> to <span>cite</span> more <span>works</span> <span>written</span> later than <span>2000</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 That's more <span>difficult</span>, but I can try.<br/>
🎧 When do you want that done by?<br/>
🎧 Oh, it's not <span>urgent</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Um</span>, I should <span>aim</span> for the end of <span>term</span>.<br/>
🎧 But in the <span>meantime</span>, I think you should also be thinking about <span>Chapter</span> Two.<br/>
🎧 Should I be <span>drafting</span> it already?<br/>
🎧 No, but I think you should <span>note</span> down its <span>main</span> <span>sections</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 You know, I always find that the <span>hardest</span> <span>part</span>.<br/>
🎧 I always find it <span>helpful</span> to put some <span>ideas</span> on <span>index</span> <span>cards</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Um..</span>. and then you can <span>sort</span> them, and even lay them out on the <span>floor</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>real</span> help.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'll <span>certainly</span> try it!<br/>
🎧 When would the <span>deadline</span> be for that?<br/>
🎧 My advice would be to get it done before you <span>embark</span> <span>upon</span> the <span>research</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can always change it later if you need to.<br/>
🎧 Okay. I'll get going on <span>that..</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Many <span>believe</span> that the <span>story</span> first <span>began</span> in <span>America</span> in <span>1877</span>,<br/>
🎧 when two friends were <span>arguing</span> over <span>whether</span> a <span>horse</span> ever had all <span>four</span> <span>feet</span> or <span>hooves</span> off the <span>ground</span> when it <span>galloped</span>.<br/>
🎧 To <span>settle</span> the bet, a <span>photographer</span> was <span>asked</span> to <span>photograph</span> a <span>horse</span> <span>galloping<br/></span>
🎧 and the bet was <span>settled</span> because you could see that all the <span>hooves</span> were off the <span>ground</span> in some of the <span>photos</span>.<br/>
🎧 What was even more <span>interesting</span> was that if the <span>photos</span> were <span>shown</span> in <span>quick</span> <span>succession<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>horse</span> <span>looked</span> like it was <span>running</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 in other <span>words</span> <span>'moving</span> <span>pictures'</span>.<br/>
🎧 The person who <span>became</span> interested in taking the <span>moving</span> <span>pictures</span> to its next <span>step<br/></span>
🎧 was the famous <span>American</span> <span>inventor</span> <span>Thomas</span> <span>Edison</span>.<br/>
🎧 Actually, he didn't do the work <span>himself</span> but rather <span>asked</span> a young <span>Scotsman</span> in his <span>employ</span> to <span>design</span> a <span>system</span>,<br/>
🎧 which he did.<br/>
🎧 Now this young <span>fellow</span> was <span>clever<br/></span>
🎧 because the first thing he did was <span>study</span> other <span>systems</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>primitive</span> as they were of <span>moving</span> <span>pictures<br/></span>
🎧 and then put all the <span>existing</span> <span>technologies</span> together to make the first <span>entire</span> <span>motion</span> <span>picture</span> <span>system</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>designed</span> a <span>camera</span>, a <span>projection</span> <span>device</span> and the <span>film</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>system</span> was first <span>shown</span> in New <span>York</span> in <span>1894</span> and was really very <span>popular</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Apparently</span>, people <span>lined</span> up around the <span>block</span> to see the wonderful new <span>invention</span>.<br/>
🎧 There were, <span>however</span>, a <span>couple</span> of <span>problems</span> with the <span>system</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>camera</span> <span>weighed</span> over <span>200</span> <span>kilograms<br/></span>
🎧 and only one person at a time could see the <span>film</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well now, <span>news</span> of the new <span>system</span> in <span>America</span> <span>travelled</span> <span>fast<br/></span>
🎧 and a number of <span>rival</span> <span>European</span> <span>systems</span> <span>started</span> to <span>appear</span> once people had heard about it.<br/>
🎧 The <span>single</span> <span>problem</span> with all the <span>systems</span> was they couldn't really <span>project</span> the <span>film</span> <span>onto</span> a <span>screen</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 you know, so more than one person could see it.<br/>
🎧 Then in <span>1895;<br/></span>
🎧 <span>three</span> <span>systems</span> were all <span>developed</span>,<br/>
🎧 more or less at the same time and <span>independently</span> of each other.<br/>
🎧 I <span>guess</span> the most famous of these was by the <span>Lumiere</span> <span>Brothers</span> from <span>France</span>,<br/>
🎧 and they called their <span>system</span> the <span>cinematographe<br/></span>
🎧 which of course is where the <span>word</span> <span>cinema</span> comes from.<br/>
🎧 There were also two <span>brothers</span> in <span>Germany</span> who <span>developed</span> a <span>successful</span> <span>system</span> and they called it a <span>bioskop</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well now, once the <span>problem</span> of <span>projection</span> had been <span>solved</span>,<br/>
🎧 the next <span>challenge</span> for the <span>inventors</span> was to make the <span>films</span> <span>longer</span> and more <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>continuing</span> <span>problem</span> at the time was that the <span>films</span> had a <span>tendency</span> to <span>break</span> when they were being <span>played</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 a <span>problem</span> which was <span>caused</span> by the <span>tension</span> between the two <span>wheels</span>,<br/>
🎧 or <span>'reels'</span> as they are called, which <span>hold</span> the <span>film</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now this <span>problem</span> was <span>solved</span> by two <span>American</span> <span>brothers</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>developed</span> the <span>'Lantham</span> <span>Loop'</span>,<br/>
🎧 which was the simple <span>addition</span> of a <span>third</span> <span>reel</span> between the two <span>main</span> <span>reels</span>,<br/>
🎧 and this took all the <span>tension</span> away with the <span>result</span> that the <span>film</span> <span>stopped</span> <span>snapping</span>.<br/>
🎧 So now there was a <span>real</span> <span>possibility</span> of having <span>films</span> of more than two or <span>three</span> <span>minutes</span>,<br/>
🎧 and this <span>led</span> to the <span>making</span> of The Great <span>Train</span> <span>Robbery</span> <span>-</span> the very first movie made.<br/>
🎧 It only <span>lasted</span> <span>11</span> <span>minutes</span> but was an <span>absolute</span> <span>sensation</span>,<br/>
🎧 and there were <span>cases</span> of people watching the movie and actually <span>fainting</span> when the <span>character</span> <span>fired</span> a gun at the <span>camera</span>!<br/>
🎧 Almost <span>overnight</span> <span>movies</span> <span>became</span> a <span>craze</span>,<br/>
🎧 and by <span>1905</span>, people in <span>America</span> were <span>lining</span> up to see <span>movies</span> in <span>'store</span> <span>theatres'</span>, as they were called then.<br/>
🎧 I <span>guess</span> the next big <span>step</span> in <span>terms</span> of <span>development</span> of <span>technology<br/></span>
🎧 was to have people actually talking on the <span>film</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the first <span>step</span> <span>towards</span> this was in <span>1926<br/></span>
🎧 when sound <span>effects</span> were first used on a <span>film</span>.<br/>
🎧 It wasn't until the <span>following</span> year <span>however</span> that the first <span>'talkie'</span>, as they were called then, was made.<br/>
🎧 This <span>film</span> <span>featured</span> <span>actors</span> <span>speaking</span> only during <span>parts</span> of the <span>film<br/></span>
🎧 and was called The <span>Jazz</span> <span>Singer</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it wasn't until <span>1928</span> that the first <span>all-talking</span> <span>film</span> was <span>produced</span>,<br/>
🎧 and this was called The <span>Lights</span> of New <span>York</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Unfortunately</span>, the sound on this <span>early</span> <span>film</span> was not very <span>good<br/></span>
🎧 and I <span>believe</span> they put <span>subtitles</span> on the <span>film</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 that is, they <span>printed</span> the <span>dialogue</span> along the <span>bottom</span> of the <span>film<br/></span>
🎧 to <span>compensate</span> for this <span>poor</span> sound <span>quality</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, with the <span>addition</span> of sound,<br/>
🎧 <span>moving</span> <span>pictures</span> <span>became</span> <span>far</span> more <span>difficult..</span>.<br/>
