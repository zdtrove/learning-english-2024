🎧 Good morning, Synmouth Museum. Can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes. Good morning.<br/>
🎧 I'm interested in the children's workshops and I'd like a little more information, please.<br/>
🎧 Do you mean the Art and Craft workshops?<br/>
🎧 Yes. A friend of a friend mentioned them -<br/>
🎧 the children do painting and make models and so forth.<br/>
🎧 Yes, of course.<br/>
🎧 Um, where to begin?<br/>
🎧 First of all, as you probably know, they run every Saturday.<br/>
🎧 Fine. And what about ages?<br/>
🎧 Well, all ages from five upwards are welcome,<br/>
🎧 though we do ask that children below eight years of age are accompanied by an adult.<br/>
🎧 Fine. That wouldn't be a problem.<br/>
🎧 What about cost?<br/>
🎧 Well, I think you'll find them very reasonable.<br/>
🎧 It's £2.50 a child,<br/>
🎧 with 80 pence off for two or more children from the same family.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, very reasonable.<br/>
🎧 And are they held in the main museum?<br/>
🎧 Not exactly.<br/>
🎧 They're nearby.<br/>
🎧 Could you give me the full address?<br/>
🎧 I don't know the area very well.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's Winter House.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And that's in Tamer Street.<br/>
🎧 Could you spell that please?<br/>
🎧 Yes, TAMER Street.<br/>
🎧 Lovely.<br/>
🎧 And I do need to tell you that there's a security entrance,<br/>
🎧 so you need to press the green button for someone to let you in.<br/>
🎧 Don't press the red button please,<br/>
🎧 but don't worry, it's all clearly labelled.<br/>
🎧 Okay. And one more question -<br/>
🎧 is parking available nearby?<br/>
🎧 We're driving in from out of town.<br/>
🎧 Your best bet is to leave your car at the back of the library -<br/>
🎧 on a Saturday morning, there are plenty of spaces there.<br/>
🎧 It's right next door to the museum.<br/>
🎧 And can I ask about booking places?<br/>
🎧 Yes, and I must tell you, you really should book by calling the education department here.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I'm sorry, should I have rung them instead of the main museum number?<br/>
🎧 No, that's fine this time, please don't worry.<br/>
🎧 But for future reference, I'll give you the direct number.<br/>
🎧 It's 200765.<br/>
🎧 Great, I've got that.<br/>
🎧 But I'm very happy to give you information about the next two workshops.<br/>
🎧 On Saturday the 16th, there's Building Castles.<br/>
🎧 Oh, sounds great!<br/>
🎧 This involves quite a bit of glue, so just make sure the kids are in old clothes.<br/>
🎧 I know, ones I don't mind getting mucky.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 And if possible, could you bring along bottle tops<br/>
🎧 which the children might be able to use in the models, you know, as decoration?<br/>
🎧 We'll certainly try to find some for you.<br/>
🎧 Then the following week...<br/>
🎧 That'll be the 23rd, won't it?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's right.<br/>
🎧 On that day, it's what we call Undersea Worlds.<br/>
🎧 This is where they make scenes with fishes, underground caverns and so on.<br/>
🎧 Is that likely to get very dirty?<br/>
🎧 Lots of paint splashes?<br/>
🎧 Not really, so we don't recommend any special clothes for that one.<br/>
🎧 But if you could search out some silver paper to bring along to use in the sessions,<br/>
🎧 you know, it's shiny - it looks like water, that'd be great.<br/>
🎧 Yes, of course. We'll see what we can come up with.<br/>
🎧 Well, thank you ever so much for all your help.<br/>
🎧 The sessions sound really good and I'll certainly book up for the next two.<br/>
🎧 Lovely.<br/>
🎧 Thanks very much for ringing.<br/>
🎧 Bye.<br/>
🎧 Bye-bye.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Hello.<br/>
🎧 Um... my family and I are staying here in Trebirch for a week or two<br/>
🎧 and we wanted to know about the train services.<br/>
🎧 We're hoping to do a few local trips.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Well, I can give you lots of details about all the trains going from Trebirch in the South West.<br/>
🎧 This leaflet will be very helpful<br/>
🎧 but I can tell you some of the main things.<br/>
🎧 We've got two main train stations in the town.<br/>
🎧 King Street is for local commuter lines and regional services.<br/>
🎧 What about trains to London?<br/>
🎧 I'll need to go there on business for one day.<br/>
🎧 Then you need to go to Central Station -<br/>
🎧 that's for all the national services.<br/>
🎧 There are regular trains to London.<br/>
🎧 They leave Trebirch every half hour on weekdays and every hour at weekends.<br/>
🎧 It takes about two hours, a bit longer on Sundays.<br/>
🎧 You've got a choice of first and second class and there's a buffet car -<br/>
🎧 though refreshments are included in the cost of a first class ticket.<br/>
🎧 Ah, right.<br/>
🎧 Um, and have you got any information on different ticket types?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 There's a range of ticket prices depending on when you travel and when you buy your ticket.<br/>
🎧 There's a standard open ticket which doesn't have any restrictions.<br/>
🎧 This can be bought in advance or on the day.<br/>
🎧 You can also get various discounted tickets.<br/>
🎧 A popular one is called the Supersave<br/>
🎧 and, er, this is OK for travel after 8.45.<br/>
🎧 Then there is the Special ticket,<br/>
🎧 which is valid for travel after 10:15.<br/>
🎧 The Special tickets are also valid for travel at weekends.<br/>
🎧 The cheapest tickets are called Advance<br/>
🎧 and you have to buy them at least six days ahead.<br/>
🎧 Only a certain number are available<br/>
🎧 and you have to make seat reservations for these.<br/>
🎧 Thanks. And are there lots of places to go to around here?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes.<br/>
🎧 You can enjoy many days out.<br/>
🎧 Um there's the Merthyr Mining Museum,<br/>
🎧 which is only half an hour from Trebirch by train.<br/>
🎧 Your children will find it just as fascinating as any theme park<br/>
🎧 and they can ride in the original miners' lifts and on the coal trains.<br/>
🎧 There are special excursion tickets which include entrance fees.<br/>
🎧 Mainline trains also offer direct services to Bristol,<br/>
🎧 where you can visit the docks or spend a great day out with the children in the zoo,<br/>
🎧 which is set in the parkland that used to surround the old castle.<br/>
🎧 Er, special family awayday fares are available for this service now during the school holidays.<br/>
🎧 Er, alternatively, you can be in Birmingham in only an hour and a half,<br/>
🎧 where there's lots to see and do including the new and internationally-acclaimed climbing wall<br/>
🎧 built on the site of the old aquarium.<br/>
🎧 We will also be running a special service to Newport<br/>
🎧 when the new science museum opens next year,<br/>
🎧 as we anticipate a lot of visitors in the opening weeks.<br/>
🎧 I'd advise you to call early to book your tickets.<br/>
🎧 Is that OK?<br/>
🎧 Yes, thanks.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Hello, Sandy.<br/>
🎧 How have you been getting on with your dissertation?<br/>
🎧 Fine, and I've been working hard on the various action points we agreed on our last tutorial.<br/>
🎧 Do you want to talk me through what you've done?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, sure.<br/>
🎧 Well, we agreed on three main targets for me to aim for.<br/>
🎧 The first one was to find out about suitable data analysis software.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 And what I decided to do was to look through catalogues specialising in IT.<br/>
🎧 That's a good idea.<br/>
🎧 What did you come up with?<br/>
🎧 I found the names of two promising ones.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 But I also thought it'd be worthwhile talking to a lecturer.<br/>
🎧 Oh right.<br/>
🎧 Who did you see?<br/>
🎧 Jane Prince. Do you know her?<br/>
🎧 She's in the Computer Centre.<br/>
🎧 Yes, of course, she's the new Head.<br/>
🎧 Yes. Well, she was very helpful.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's good.<br/>
🎧 Did she suggest anything in particular?<br/>
🎧 Yeah. She recommended software called Vivat<br/>
🎧 and said I should book up for a couple of practice sessions using Vivat.<br/>
🎧 Great. I'm sure you'll find them useful.<br/>
🎧 And, of course, the second target was to draw up a survey checklist...<br/>
🎧 Yes, you emailed me it last week.<br/>
🎧 Have you had a chance to look...?<br/>
🎧 Of course,<br/>
🎧 um, I think it's good.<br/>
🎧 Very much on the right lines.<br/>
🎧 I'd say your first two sections are spot on.<br/>
🎧 I wouldn't suggest that you change anything there, but...<br/>
🎧 in section three you really do need to have questions on teaching experience.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. I was thinking that section looked a bit short.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And my third target was, do further reading on discipline.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes. I mentioned a couple of writers, didn't I?<br/>
🎧 Yes, well, I got hold of the Banerjee and I thought that was excellent.<br/>
🎧 But I'm afraid I didn't manage to get hold of the essays about classroom management,<br/>
🎧 you know, the ones by Simon Ericsson.<br/>
🎧 The bookshop said it was out of print and the library doesn't have a copy.<br/>
🎧 Oh right, and I'm afraid I've lent my copy to another student.<br/>
🎧 What I suggest you do is try the library again -<br/>
🎧 this time apply for it through the service called special loans.<br/>
🎧 Have you done that before?<br/>
🎧 You're entitled to six books a year.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 No problem. That's what I'll do.<br/>
🎧 So, lots of useful work done.<br/>
🎧 So, let's look at some new targets.<br/>
🎧 We'll start by having a chat about your Chapter One.<br/>
🎧 I very much enjoyed reading it.<br/>
🎧 Your written style is very clear<br/>
🎧 and you've included lots of interesting descriptions of education in your target area.<br/>
🎧 I've just got a couple of suggestions for some additional work.<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 Could I just ask - what do you think I should call it?<br/>
🎧 Well, I'd go for something like Context Review.<br/>
🎧 What do you think?<br/>
🎧 Well, short and to the point.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 Now, as regards specific areas to work on,<br/>
🎧 I'd be quite interested to have a few more statistics about the schools in the different zones.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that wouldn't be a problem. I can get them from the Internet.<br/>
🎧 Great,<br/>
🎧 and although you did make a reference to quite a few different writers,<br/>
🎧 I think you should aim to cite more works written later than 2000.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 That's more difficult, but I can try.<br/>
🎧 When do you want that done by?<br/>
🎧 Oh, it's not urgent.<br/>
🎧 Um, I should aim for the end of term.<br/>
🎧 But in the meantime, I think you should also be thinking about Chapter Two.<br/>
🎧 Should I be drafting it already?<br/>
🎧 No, but I think you should note down its main sections.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 You know, I always find that the hardest part.<br/>
🎧 I always find it helpful to put some ideas on index cards.<br/>
🎧 Um... and then you can sort them, and even lay them out on the floor.<br/>
🎧 It's a real help.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'll certainly try it!<br/>
🎧 When would the deadline be for that?<br/>
🎧 My advice would be to get it done before you embark upon the research.<br/>
🎧 You can always change it later if you need to.<br/>
🎧 Okay. I'll get going on that...<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Many believe that the story first began in America in 1877,<br/>
🎧 when two friends were arguing over whether a horse ever had all four feet or hooves off the ground when it galloped.<br/>
🎧 To settle the bet, a photographer was asked to photograph a horse galloping<br/>
🎧 and the bet was settled because you could see that all the hooves were off the ground in some of the photos.<br/>
🎧 What was even more interesting was that if the photos were shown in quick succession<br/>
🎧 the horse looked like it was running -<br/>
🎧 in other words 'moving pictures'.<br/>
🎧 The person who became interested in taking the moving pictures to its next step<br/>
🎧 was the famous American inventor Thomas Edison.<br/>
🎧 Actually, he didn't do the work himself but rather asked a young Scotsman in his employ to design a system,<br/>
🎧 which he did.<br/>
🎧 Now this young fellow was clever<br/>
🎧 because the first thing he did was study other systems -<br/>
🎧 primitive as they were of moving pictures<br/>
🎧 and then put all the existing technologies together to make the first entire motion picture system.<br/>
🎧 He designed a camera, a projection device and the film.<br/>
🎧 The system was first shown in New York in 1894 and was really very popular.<br/>
🎧 Apparently, people lined up around the block to see the wonderful new invention.<br/>
🎧 There were, however, a couple of problems with the system.<br/>
🎧 The camera weighed over 200 kilograms<br/>
🎧 and only one person at a time could see the film.<br/>
🎧 Well now, news of the new system in America travelled fast<br/>
🎧 and a number of rival European systems started to appear once people had heard about it.<br/>
🎧 The single problem with all the systems was they couldn't really project the film onto a screen -<br/>
🎧 you know, so more than one person could see it.<br/>
🎧 Then in 1895;<br/>
🎧 three systems were all developed,<br/>
🎧 more or less at the same time and independently of each other.<br/>
🎧 I guess the most famous of these was by the Lumiere Brothers from France,<br/>
🎧 and they called their system the cinematographe<br/>
🎧 which of course is where the word cinema comes from.<br/>
🎧 There were also two brothers in Germany who developed a successful system and they called it a bioskop.<br/>
🎧 Well now, once the problem of projection had been solved,<br/>
🎧 the next challenge for the inventors was to make the films longer and more interesting.<br/>
🎧 A continuing problem at the time was that the films had a tendency to break when they were being played -<br/>
🎧 a problem which was caused by the tension between the two wheels,<br/>
🎧 or 'reels' as they are called, which hold the film.<br/>
🎧 Now this problem was solved by two American brothers.<br/>
🎧 They developed the 'Lantham Loop',<br/>
🎧 which was the simple addition of a third reel between the two main reels,<br/>
🎧 and this took all the tension away with the result that the film stopped snapping.<br/>
🎧 So now there was a real possibility of having films of more than two or three minutes,<br/>
🎧 and this led to the making of The Great Train Robbery - the very first movie made.<br/>
🎧 It only lasted 11 minutes but was an absolute sensation,<br/>
🎧 and there were cases of people watching the movie and actually fainting when the character fired a gun at the camera!<br/>
🎧 Almost overnight movies became a craze,<br/>
🎧 and by 1905, people in America were lining up to see movies in 'store theatres', as they were called then.<br/>
🎧 I guess the next big step in terms of development of technology<br/>
🎧 was to have people actually talking on the film,<br/>
🎧 and the first step towards this was in 1926<br/>
🎧 when sound effects were first used on a film.<br/>
🎧 It wasn't until the following year however that the first 'talkie', as they were called then, was made.<br/>
🎧 This film featured actors speaking only during parts of the film<br/>
🎧 and was called The Jazz Singer,<br/>
🎧 and it wasn't until 1928 that the first all-talking film was produced,<br/>
🎧 and this was called The Lights of New York.<br/>
🎧 Unfortunately, the sound on this early film was not very good<br/>
🎧 and I believe they put subtitles on the film -<br/>
🎧 that is, they printed the dialogue along the bottom of the film<br/>
🎧 to compensate for this poor sound quality.<br/>
🎧 Now, with the addition of sound,<br/>
🎧 moving pictures became far more difficult...<br/>
<br/><br/>
