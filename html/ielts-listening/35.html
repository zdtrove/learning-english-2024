🎧 Good morning. This is <span>Burnham <span>tourist <span>office, <span>Martin <span>speaking.<br/>
🎧 Oh, hello.<br/>
🎧 I saw a <span>poster about free things to do in the <span>area,<br/>
🎧 and it said people should phone you for <span>information.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>coming to <span>Burnham with my <span>husband and two children for a few <span>days on <span>June the <span>27th,<br/>
🎧 or <span>possibly the <span>28th,<br/>
🎧 and I'd like some <span>ideas for things to do on the <span>29th.<br/>
🎧 Yes, of course. OK.<br/>
🎧 Then let's start with a <span>couple of <span>events <span>especially for children.<br/>
🎧 The <span>art <span>gallery is <span>holding an <span>event called <span>'Family <span>Welcome' that day,<br/>
🎧 when there are <span>activities and <span>trails to use <span>throughout the <span>gallery.<br/>
🎧 That sounds <span>interesting.<br/>
🎧 What time does it start?<br/>
🎧 The <span>gallery <span>opens at <span>10, and the <span>'Family <span>Welcome' <span>event <span>runs from <span>10.30 until <span>2 <span>o'clock.<br/>
🎧 The <span>gallery <span>stays open until <span>5.<br/>
🎧 And <span>several <span>times during the day, they're going to show a short <span>film that the <span>gallery has <span>produced.<br/>
🎧 It <span>demonstrates how <span>ceramics are made,<br/>
🎧 and <span>there'll be <span>equipment and <span>materials for children to have a go <span>themselves.<br/>
🎧 Last time they ran the <span>event, there was a <span>film about <span>painting,<br/>
🎧 which went down very well with the children,<br/>
🎧 and they're now working on one about <span>sculpture.<br/>
🎧 I like the sound of that.<br/>
🎧 And what other <span>events <span>happen in <span>Burnham?<br/>
🎧 Well, do you all enjoy <span>listening to music?<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes.<br/>
🎧 Well there are <span>several free <span>concerts taking place at different <span>times <span>-<br/>
🎧 one or two in the morning,<br/>
🎧 the <span>majority at <span>lunchtime, and a <span>couple in the <span>evening.<br/>
🎧 And they <span>range from pop music to <span>Latin <span>American.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Latin <span>American could be fun.<br/>
🎧 What time is that?<br/>
🎧 It's being <span>repeated <span>several <span>times, in different <span>places.<br/>
🎧 They're <span>performing in the <span>central <span>library at <span>1 <span>o'clock,<br/>
🎧 then at <span>4 it's in the <span>City <span>Museum,<br/>
🎧 and in the <span>evening, at <span>7.30, there's a <span>longer <span>concert, in the <span>theatre.<br/>
🎧 Right. I'll <span>suggest that to the <span>rest of the <span>family.<br/>
🎧 Something else you might be interested in is the <span>boat <span>race along the <span>river.<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes, do tell me about that.<br/>
🎧 The <span>race <span>starts at <span>Offord <span>Marina, to the <span>north of <span>Burnham, and <span>goes as <span>far as <span>Summer <span>Pool.<br/>
🎧 The best place to <span>watch it from is <span>Charlesworth <span>Bridge, though that does get rather <span>crowded.<br/>
🎧 And who's taking <span>part?<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>local <span>boat <span>clubs, but the <span>standard is very high.<br/>
🎧 One of them came first in the <span>West of <span>England <span>regional <span>championship in May this year <span>-<br/>
🎧 it was the first time a <span>team from <span>Burnham has <span>won.<br/>
🎧 It <span>means that next year they'll be <span>representing the <span>region in the <span>national <span>championship.<br/>
🎧 Now I've heard something about <span>Paxton <span>Nature <span>Reserve.<br/>
🎧 It's a good place for <span>spotting <span>unusual <span>birds, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 That's right <span>- <span>throughout the year.<br/>
🎧 There is a <span>lake there, as well as a <span>river,<br/>
🎧 and they <span>provide a very <span>attractive <span>habitat.<br/>
🎧 So it's a good idea to <span>bring <span>binoculars if you have them.<br/>
🎧 And just at the <span>moment you can see <span>various <span>flowers that are <span>pretty <span>unusual <span>-<br/>
🎧 the <span>soil at <span>Paxton isn't very <span>common.<br/>
🎧 They're looking good right now.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 My <span>husband will be <span>particularly interested in that.<br/>
🎧 And there's going to be a talk and <span>slide show about <span>mushrooms <span>-<br/>
🎧 and you'll be able to go out and <span>pick some <span>afterwards and <span>study the different <span>varieties.<br/>
🎧 <span>Uhuh. And is it <span>possible for children to <span>swim in the <span>river?<br/>
🎧 Yes. <span>Part of it has been <span>fenced off to make it <span>safe for children to <span>swim in.<br/>
🎧 It's very <span>shallow, and there's a <span>lifeguard on <span>duty <span>whenever it's open.<br/>
🎧 The <span>lake is too <span>deep, so <span>swimming isn't <span>allowed there.<br/>
🎧 OK, we must remember to <span>bring their <span>swimming things, in case we go to <span>Paxton.<br/>
🎧 How long does it take to get there by car from <span>Burnham?<br/>
🎧 About <span>20 <span>minutes,<br/>
🎧 but <span>parking is very <span>limited, so it's usually much <span>easier to go by bus <span>-<br/>
🎧 and it takes about the same time.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Well. I'll <span>discuss the options with the <span>rest of the <span>family.<br/>
🎧 Thanks very much for all your help.<br/>
🎧 You're <span>welcome.<br/>
🎧 <span>Goodbye.<br/>
🎧 Bye.<br/>
 <span><br/>

</div>
🎧 First of all, let me thank you all for <span>coming to this <span>public <span>meeting, to <span>discuss the future of our <span>town.<br/>
🎧 Our first <span>speaker is <span>Shona <span>Ferguson, from <span>Barford <span>town <span>council.<br/>
🎧 <span>Shone.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 First I'll <span>briefly give you some <span>background <span>information,<br/>
🎧 then I'll be <span>asking you for your <span>comments on <span>developments in the <span>town.<br/>
🎧 Well, as you don't need me to tell you, <span>Barford has <span>changed a great <span>deal in the last <span>50 years.<br/>
🎧 These are some of the <span>main changes.<br/>
🎧 <span>Fifty years ago, <span>buses <span>linked <span>virtually every <span>part of the <span>town and the <span>neighbouring <span>towns and <span>villages.<br/>
🎧 Most people used them <span>frequently,<br/>
🎧 but not now because the bus <span>companies <span>concentrate on just the <span>routes that <span>attract most <span>passengers.<br/>
🎧 So <span>parts of the <span>town are no <span>longer <span>served by <span>buses.<br/>
🎧 Even <span>replacing old <span>uncomfortable <span>buses with <span>smart new <span>ones has had little <span>impact on <span>passenger <span>numbers.<br/>
🎧 It's sometimes said that bus <span>fares are too high,<br/>
🎧 but in <span>relation to <span>average <span>incomes, <span>fares are not much <span>higher than they were <span>50 years ago.<br/>
🎧 Changes in the <span>road <span>network are <span>affecting the <span>town.<br/>
🎧 The <span>centre was <span>recently <span>closed to <span>traffic on a <span>trial <span>basis, <span>making it much <span>safer for <span>pedestrians.<br/>
🎧 The <span>impact of this is being <span>measured.<br/>
🎧 The new <span>cycle <span>paths <span>separating <span>bikes from <span>cars in most <span>main <span>roads,<br/>
🎧 are being used <span>far more than was <span>expected <span>reducing <span>traffic and <span>improving air <span>quality.<br/>
🎧 And although the <span>council's <span>attempts to have a <span>bypass <span>constructed have <span>failed,<br/>
🎧 we haven't <span>given up hope of <span>persuading the <span>government to change its <span>mind.<br/>
🎧 <span>Shopping in the <span>town <span>centre has <span>changed over the years.<br/>
🎧 Many of us can remember when the <span>town was <span>crowded with people going <span>shopping.<br/>
🎧 <span>Numbers have been <span>falling for <span>several years,<br/>
🎧 <span>despite <span>efforts to <span>attract <span>shoppers, for <span>instance by <span>opening new car <span>parks.<br/>
🎧 Some people <span>combine <span>shopping with <span>visits to the <span>town's <span>restaurants and <span>cafés.<br/>
🎧 Most <span>shops are small <span>independent <span>stores, which is good,<br/>
🎧 but many people <span>prefer to use <span>supermarkets and <span>department <span>stores in <span>nearby large <span>towns,<br/>
🎧 as there are so few <span>well-known <span>chain <span>stores here.<br/>
🎧 <span>Turning now to <span>medical <span>facilities,<br/>
🎧 the <span>town is <span>served by <span>family <span>doctors in <span>several <span>medical <span>practices <span>-<br/>
🎧 <span>fewer than <span>50 years ago, but each <span>catering for <span>far more <span>patients.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>hospital <span>closed <span>15 years ago,<br/>
🎧 which <span>means <span>journeys to other <span>towns are <span>unavoidable.<br/>
🎧 On the other <span>hand, there are more <span>dentists than there used to be.<br/>
🎧 <span>Employment <span>patterns have <span>changed, along with almost everything else.<br/>
🎧 The number of <span>schools and <span>colleges has <span>increased <span>making that the <span>main <span>employment <span>sector.<br/>
🎧 <span>Services, such as <span>website <span>design and <span>accountancy, have <span>grown in <span>importance,<br/>
🎧 and <span>surprisingly, <span>perhaps, <span>manufacturing hasn't <span>seen the <span>decline that has <span>affected it in other <span>parts of the <span>country.<br/>
🎧 Now I'll very quickly <span>outline <span>current <span>plans for some of the <span>town's <span>facilities,<br/>
🎧 before <span>asking for your <span>comments.<br/>
🎧 As you'll know if you <span>regularly use the car <span>park at the <span>railway <span>station, it's usually full.<br/>
🎧 The <span>railway company <span>applied for <span>permission to <span>replace it with a <span>multi-storey car <span>park,<br/>
🎧 but that was <span>refused.<br/>
🎧 <span>Instead, the company has <span>bought some <span>adjoining <span>land, and this will be used to <span>increase the number of <span>parking <span>spaces.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Grand, the old <span>cinema in the high <span>street will <span>close at the end of the year,<br/>
🎧 and <span>reopen on a different <span>site.<br/>
🎧 You've probably <span>seen the <span>building under <span>construction.<br/>
🎧 The plan is to have <span>three <span>screens with <span>fewer <span>seats, rather than just the one large <span>auditorium in the old <span>cinema.<br/>
🎧 I <span>expect many of you <span>shop in the <span>indoor <span>market.<br/>
🎧 It's become more and more <span>shabby-looking,<br/>
🎧 and because of <span>fears about <span>safety, it was <span>threatened with <span>demolition.<br/>
🎧 The good <span>news is that it will <span>close for six <span>weeks to be made <span>safe and <span>redecorated,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>improved <span>building will open in <span>July.<br/>
🎧 Lots of people use the <span>library, <span>including school and <span>college students who go there to <span>study.<br/>
🎧 The <span>council has <span>managed to <span>secure <span>funding to keep the <span>library open later into the <span>evening, <span>twice a week.<br/>
🎧 We would like to <span>enlarge the <span>building in the <span>not-too-distant future,<br/>
🎧 but this is by no <span>means <span>definite.<br/>
🎧 There's no <span>limit on <span>access to the <span>nature <span>reserve on the <span>edge of <span>town,<br/>
🎧 and this will <span>continue to be the case.<br/>
🎧 What will change, though, is that the <span>council will no <span>longer be in <span>charge of the <span>area.<br/>
🎧 <span>Instead it will become the <span>responsibility of a <span>national <span>body<br/>
🎧 that <span>administers most <span>nature <span>reserves in the <span>country.<br/>
🎧 OK, <span>now...<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Hello, <span>Helen. Sorry I'm <span>late.<br/>
🎧 Hi, <span>Jeremy, no <span>problem.<br/>
🎧 Well we'd better work out where we are on our <span>project, I <span>suppose.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. I've <span>looked at the <span>drawings you've done for my <span>story, <span>'The <span>Forest',<br/>
🎧 and I think they're <span>brilliant <span>- they really <span>create the <span>atmosphere I had in <span>mind when I was <span>writing it.<br/>
🎧 I'm glad you like them.<br/>
🎧 There are just a few <span>suggestions I'd like to make.<br/>
🎧 Go ahead.<br/>
🎧 Now, I'm not sure about the <span>drawing of the <span>cave <span>-<br/>
🎧 it's got <span>trees all around it, which is great,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>drawing's a bit too <span>static, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 I think it needs some <span>action.<br/>
🎧 Yes, there's <span>nothing <span>happening.<br/>
🎧 <span>Perhaps I should add the boy <span>- <span>Malcolm, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 He would be <span>walking up to it.<br/>
🎧 Yes, let's have <span>Malcolm in the <span>drawing.<br/>
🎧 And what about <span>putting in a <span>tiger <span>-<br/>
🎧 the one that he makes friends with a bit later? Maybe it could be <span>sitting under a <span>tree <span>washing <span>itself.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>tiger <span>stops in the <span>middle of what it's doing when it <span>sees <span>Malcolm <span>walking <span>past.<br/>
🎧 That's a good idea.<br/>
🎧 OK, I'll have a go at that.<br/>
🎧 Then there's the <span>drawing of the <span>crowd of men and <span>women <span>dancing.<br/>
🎧 They're just outside the <span>forest, and there's a lot going on.<br/>
🎧 That's right, you wanted them to be watching a <span>carnival <span>procession, but I thought it would be too <span>crowded.<br/>
🎧 Do you think it <span>works like this?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I like what you've done.<br/>
🎧 The only thing is, could you add <span>Malcolm to it, without <span>changing what's already there.<br/>
🎧 What about having him <span>sitting on the <span>tree <span>trunk on the right of the <span>picture?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that would be fine.<br/>
🎧 And do you want him watching the other people?<br/>
🎧 No, he's been <span>left out of all the fun, so I'd like him to be <span>crying <span>-<br/>
🎧 <span>that'll <span>contrast <span>nicely with the next <span>picture,<br/>
🎧 where he's <span>laughing at the <span>clowns in the <span>carnival.<br/>
🎧 Right, I'll do that.<br/>
🎧 And then the <span>drawing of the people ice <span>skating in the <span>forest.<br/>
🎧 I wasn't too happy with that one.<br/>
🎧 Because they're <span>supposed to be <span>skating on <span>grass aren't they?<br/>
🎧 That's right, and it's <span>frozen over.<br/>
🎧 At the <span>moment it doesn't look quite right.<br/>
🎧 I see what you mean.<br/>
🎧 I'll have another go at that.<br/>
🎧 And I like the <span>wool <span>hats they're <span>wearing.<br/>
🎧 Maybe you could give each of them a <span>scarf as well.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, that's easy enough.<br/>
🎧 They can be <span>streaming out behind the people to <span>suggest they're <span>skating really <span>fast.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 Well that's all on the <span>drawings.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So you've <span>finished <span>writing your <span>story and I just need to <span>finish <span>illustrating it,<br/>
🎧 and my <span>story and your <span>drawings are done.<br/>
🎧 So the next thing is to decide what exactly we need to <span>write about in the <span>report that <span>goes with the <span>stories,<br/>
🎧 and how we're going to <span>divide the work.<br/>
🎧 Right, <span>Helen.<br/>
🎧 What do you think about <span>including a <span>section on how we <span>planned the <span>project as a whole, <span>Jeremy?<br/>
🎧 That's probably quite important.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. Well, you've had most of the good <span>ideas so <span>far.<br/>
🎧 How do you feel about <span>drafting something,<br/>
🎧 then we can go through it together and <span>discuss it?<br/>
🎧 OK, that <span>seems <span>reasonable.<br/>
🎧 And I could <span>include something on how we came up with the <span>ideas for our two <span>stories, couldn't I?<br/>
🎧 Well, I've <span>started <span>writing something about that,<br/>
🎧 so why don't you do the same and we can <span>include the two things.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So what about our <span>interpretation of the <span>stories?<br/>
🎧 Do we need to <span>write about what we think they show,<br/>
🎧 like the <span>value of <span>helping other people, all that <span>sort of thing?<br/>
🎧 That's going to come up later isn't it?<br/>
🎧 I think everyone in the class is going to read each <span>other's <span>stories<br/>
🎧 and come up with their own <span>interpretations which we're going to <span>discuss.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I <span>missed that.<br/>
🎧 So it isn't going to be <span>part of the <span>report at all?<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 But we need to <span>write about the <span>illustrations, because they're an <span>essential <span>element of <span>children's <span>experience of <span>reading the <span>stories.<br/>
🎧 It's probably <span>easiest for you to <span>write that <span>section, as you know more about <span>drawing than I do.<br/>
🎧 Maybe, but I find it quite <span>hard to <span>write about.<br/>
🎧 I'd be <span>happier if you did it.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So when do you <span>think…<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 So what I'm going to talk about to you today is something called <span>Ethnography.<br/>
🎧 This is a <span>type of <span>research <span>aimed at <span>exploring the way <span>human <span>cultures work.<br/>
🎧 It was first <span>developed for use in <span>anthropology,<br/>
🎧 and it's also been used in <span>sociology and <span>communication <span>studies.<br/>
🎧 So what's it got to do with <span>business, you may ask.<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>businesses are <span>finding that <span>ethnography can <span>offer them <span>deeper <span>insight into the <span>possible needs of <span>customers,<br/>
🎧 either <span>present or future,<br/>
🎧 as well as <span>providing <span>valuable <span>information about their <span>attitudes <span>towards <span>existing <span>products.<br/>
🎧 And <span>ethnography can also help <span>companies to <span>design new <span>products or <span>services that <span>customers really want.<br/>
🎧 Let's look at some <span>examples of how <span>ethnographic <span>research <span>works in <span>business.<br/>
🎧 One <span>team of <span>researchers did a <span>project for a company <span>manufacturing <span>kitchen <span>equipment.<br/>
🎧 They <span>watched how <span>cooks used <span>measuring <span>cups to <span>measure out things like <span>sugar and <span>flour.<br/>
🎧 They saw that the <span>cooks had to check and <span>recheck the <span>contents,<br/>
🎧 because although the <span>measuring <span>cups had <span>numbers inside them,<br/>
🎧 the <span>cooks couldn't see these <span>easily.<br/>
🎧 So a new <span>design of cup was <span>developed to <span>overcome this <span>problem,<br/>
🎧 and it was a top <span>seller.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>team of <span>ethnographic <span>researchers <span>looked at how <span>cell <span>phones were used in <span>Uganda, in <span>Africa.<br/>
🎧 They <span>found that people who didn't have their own <span>phones could pay to use the <span>phones of <span>local <span>entrepreneurs.<br/>
🎧 Because these <span>customers <span>paid in <span>advance for their <span>calls,<br/>
🎧 they were <span>eager to know how much time they'd <span>spent on the call so <span>far.<br/>
🎧 So the phone company <span>designed <span>phones for use <span>globally with this <span>added <span>feature.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ethnographic <span>research has also been <span>carried out in <span>computer <span>companies.<br/>
🎧 In one company, IT <span>systems <span>administrators were <span>observed for <span>several <span>weeks.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>found that a large amount of their work <span>involved <span>communicating with <span>colleagues in order to <span>solve <span>problems,<br/>
🎧 but that they didn't have a <span>standard way of <span>exchanging <span>information from <span>spreadsheets and so on.<br/>
🎧 So the <span>team came up with an idea for <span>software that would help them to do this.<br/>
🎧 In another <span>piece of <span>research, a <span>team <span>observed and <span>talked to <span>nurses working in <span>hospitals.<br/>
🎧 This <span>led to the <span>recognition that the <span>nurses <span>needed to <span>access the <span>computer <span>records of their <span>patients,<br/>
🎧 no <span>matter where they were.<br/>
🎧 This <span>led to the <span>development of a <span>portable <span>computer <span>tablet<br/>
🎧 that <span>allowed the <span>nurses to check <span>records in <span>locations <span>throughout the <span>hospital.<br/>
🎧 <span>Occasionally, <span>research can be done even in <span>environments where the <span>researchers can't be <span>present.<br/>
🎧 For example, in one <span>project done for an <span>airline,<br/>
🎧 <span>respondents used their <span>smartphones to <span>record <span>information during <span>airline <span>trips,<br/>
🎧 in a <span>study <span>aiming at <span>tracking the <span>emotions of <span>passengers during a <span>flight.<br/>
🎧 So what makes <span>studies like these different from <span>ordinary <span>research?<br/>
🎧 Let's look at some of the <span>general <span>principles behind <span>ethnographic <span>research in <span>business.<br/>
🎧 First of all, the <span>researcher has to be <span>completely <span>open-minded <span>-<br/>
🎧 he or she hasn't thought up a <span>hypothesis to be <span>tested, as is the case in other <span>types of <span>research.<br/>
🎧 <span>Instead they wait for the <span>participants in the <span>research to <span>inform them.<br/>
🎧 As <span>far as <span>choosing the <span>participants <span>themselves is <span>concerned,<br/>
🎧 that's not really all that different from <span>ordinary <span>research <span>-<br/>
🎧 the <span>criteria <span>according to which the <span>participants are <span>chosen may be something as simple as the age <span>bracket they <span>fall into,<br/>
🎧 or the <span>researchers may <span>select them <span>according to their <span>income,<br/>
🎧 or they might try to find a set of people who all use a <span>particular product, for example.<br/>
🎧 But it's absolutely <span>crucial to <span>recruit the right people as <span>participants.<br/>
🎧 As well as the <span>criteria I've <span>mentioned,<br/>
🎧 they have to be <span>comfortable talking about <span>themselves<br/>
🎧 and being <span>watched as they go about their <span>activities.<br/>
🎧 Actually, most <span>researchers say that people open up <span>pretty <span>easily,<br/>
🎧 maybe because they're often in their own home or <span>workplace.<br/>
🎧 So what makes this <span>type of <span>research special is that it's not just a <span>matter of <span>sending a <span>questionnaire to the <span>participants,<br/>
🎧 <span>instead the <span>research is usually <span>based on <span>first-hand <span>observation of what they are doing at the time.<br/>
🎧 But that doesn't mean that the <span>researcher never <span>talks to the <span>participants.<br/>
🎧 <span>However, <span>unlike in <span>traditional <span>research,<br/>
🎧 in this case it's the <span>participant rather than the <span>researchers<br/>
🎧 who <span>decides what <span>direction the <span>interview will <span>follow.<br/>
🎧 This <span>means that there's less <span>likelihood of the <span>researcher <span>imposing his or her own <span>ideas on the <span>participant.<br/>
🎧 But after <span>they've said <span>goodbye to their <span>participants and got back to their <span>office,<br/>
🎧 the <span>researchers' work isn't <span>finished.<br/>
🎧 Most <span>researchers <span>estimate that <span>70 to <span>80 <span>percent of their time is <span>spent not on the <span>collecting of <span>data but on its <span>analysis <span>-<br/>
🎧 looking at <span>photos <span>listening to <span>recordings and <span>transcribing them and so on.<br/>
🎧 The <span>researchers may end up with <span>hundreds of <span>pages of <span>notes.<br/>
🎧 And to <span>determine what's <span>significant, they don't focus on the <span>sensational things or the <span>unusual things,<br/>
🎧 <span>instead they try to <span>identify a <span>pattern of some <span>sort in all this <span>data,<br/>
🎧 and to <span>discern the <span>meaning behind it.<br/>
🎧 This can <span>result in some <span>compelling <span>insights that can in <span>turn <span>feed back to the whole <span>design <span>process.<br/>
