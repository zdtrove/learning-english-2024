🎧 Good morning. This is <span>Burnham</span> <span>tourist</span> <span>office</span>, <span>Martin</span> <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, hello.<br/>
🎧 I saw a <span>poster</span> about free things to do in the <span>area</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it said people should phone you for <span>information</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>coming</span> to <span>Burnham</span> with my <span>husband</span> and two children for a few <span>days</span> on <span>June</span> the <span>27th</span>,<br/>
🎧 or <span>possibly</span> the <span>28th</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I'd like some <span>ideas</span> for things to do on the <span>29th</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, of course. OK.<br/>
🎧 Then let's start with a <span>couple</span> of <span>events</span> <span>especially</span> for children.<br/>
🎧 The <span>art</span> <span>gallery</span> is <span>holding</span> an <span>event</span> called <span>'Family</span> <span>Welcome'</span> that day,<br/>
🎧 when there are <span>activities</span> and <span>trails</span> to use <span>throughout</span> the <span>gallery</span>.<br/>
🎧 That sounds <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 What time does it start?<br/>
🎧 The <span>gallery</span> <span>opens</span> at <span>10</span>, and the <span>'Family</span> <span>Welcome'</span> <span>event</span> <span>runs</span> from <span>10.30</span> until <span>2</span> <span>o'clock</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>gallery</span> <span>stays</span> open until <span>5</span>.<br/>
🎧 And <span>several</span> <span>times</span> during the day, they're going to show a short <span>film</span> that the <span>gallery</span> has <span>produced</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>demonstrates</span> how <span>ceramics</span> are made,<br/>
🎧 and <span>there'll</span> be <span>equipment</span> and <span>materials</span> for children to have a go <span>themselves</span>.<br/>
🎧 Last time they ran the <span>event</span>, there was a <span>film</span> about <span>painting</span>,<br/>
🎧 which went down very well with the children,<br/>
🎧 and they're now working on one about <span>sculpture</span>.<br/>
🎧 I like the sound of that.<br/>
🎧 And what other <span>events</span> <span>happen</span> in <span>Burnham</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, do you all enjoy <span>listening</span> to music?<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes.<br/>
🎧 Well there are <span>several</span> free <span>concerts</span> taking place at different <span>times</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 one or two in the morning,<br/>
🎧 the <span>majority</span> at <span>lunchtime</span>, and a <span>couple</span> in the <span>evening</span>.<br/>
🎧 And they <span>range</span> from pop music to <span>Latin</span> <span>American</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Latin</span> <span>American</span> could be fun.<br/>
🎧 What time is that?<br/>
🎧 It's being <span>repeated</span> <span>several</span> <span>times</span>, in different <span>places</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're <span>performing</span> in the <span>central</span> <span>library</span> at <span>1</span> <span>o'clock</span>,<br/>
🎧 then at <span>4</span> it's in the <span>City</span> <span>Museum</span>,<br/>
🎧 and in the <span>evening</span>, at <span>7.30</span>, there's a <span>longer</span> <span>concert</span>, in the <span>theatre</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right. I'll <span>suggest</span> that to the <span>rest</span> of the <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 Something else you might be interested in is the <span>boat</span> <span>race</span> along the <span>river</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes, do tell me about that.<br/>
🎧 The <span>race</span> <span>starts</span> at <span>Offord</span> <span>Marina</span>, to the <span>north</span> of <span>Burnham</span>, and <span>goes</span> as <span>far</span> as <span>Summer</span> <span>Pool</span>.<br/>
🎧 The best place to <span>watch</span> it from is <span>Charlesworth</span> <span>Bridge</span>, though that does get rather <span>crowded</span>.<br/>
🎧 And who's taking <span>part</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>local</span> <span>boat</span> <span>clubs</span>, but the <span>standard</span> is very high.<br/>
🎧 One of them came first in the <span>West</span> of <span>England</span> <span>regional</span> <span>championship</span> in May this year <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it was the first time a <span>team</span> from <span>Burnham</span> has <span>won</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>means</span> that next year they'll be <span>representing</span> the <span>region</span> in the <span>national</span> <span>championship</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now I've heard something about <span>Paxton</span> <span>Nature</span> <span>Reserve</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a good place for <span>spotting</span> <span>unusual</span> <span>birds</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 That's right <span>-</span> <span>throughout</span> the year.<br/>
🎧 There is a <span>lake</span> there, as well as a <span>river</span>,<br/>
🎧 and they <span>provide</span> a very <span>attractive</span> <span>habitat</span>.<br/>
🎧 So it's a good idea to <span>bring</span> <span>binoculars</span> if you have them.<br/>
🎧 And just at the <span>moment</span> you can see <span>various</span> <span>flowers</span> that are <span>pretty</span> <span>unusual</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>soil</span> at <span>Paxton</span> isn't very <span>common</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're looking good right now.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 My <span>husband</span> will be <span>particularly</span> interested in that.<br/>
🎧 And there's going to be a talk and <span>slide</span> show about <span>mushrooms</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and you'll be able to go out and <span>pick</span> some <span>afterwards</span> and <span>study</span> the different <span>varieties</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Uhuh</span>. And is it <span>possible</span> for children to <span>swim</span> in the <span>river</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes. <span>Part</span> of it has been <span>fenced</span> off to make it <span>safe</span> for children to <span>swim</span> in.<br/>
🎧 It's very <span>shallow</span>, and there's a <span>lifeguard</span> on <span>duty</span> <span>whenever</span> it's open.<br/>
🎧 The <span>lake</span> is too <span>deep</span>, so <span>swimming</span> isn't <span>allowed</span> there.<br/>
🎧 OK, we must remember to <span>bring</span> their <span>swimming</span> things, in case we go to <span>Paxton</span>.<br/>
🎧 How long does it take to get there by car from <span>Burnham</span>?<br/>
🎧 About <span>20</span> <span>minutes</span>,<br/>
🎧 but <span>parking</span> is very <span>limited</span>, so it's usually much <span>easier</span> to go by bus <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and it takes about the same time.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Well. I'll <span>discuss</span> the options with the <span>rest</span> of the <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks very much for all your help.<br/>
🎧 You're <span>welcome</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Goodbye</span>.<br/>
🎧 Bye.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 First of all, let me thank you all for <span>coming</span> to this <span>public</span> <span>meeting</span>, to <span>discuss</span> the future of our <span>town</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our first <span>speaker</span> is <span>Shona</span> <span>Ferguson</span>, from <span>Barford</span> <span>town</span> <span>council</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Shone</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 First I'll <span>briefly</span> give you some <span>background</span> <span>information</span>,<br/>
🎧 then I'll be <span>asking</span> you for your <span>comments</span> on <span>developments</span> in the <span>town</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, as you don't need me to tell you, <span>Barford</span> has <span>changed</span> a great <span>deal</span> in the last <span>50</span> years.<br/>
🎧 These are some of the <span>main</span> changes.<br/>
🎧 <span>Fifty</span> years ago, <span>buses</span> <span>linked</span> <span>virtually</span> every <span>part</span> of the <span>town</span> and the <span>neighbouring</span> <span>towns</span> and <span>villages</span>.<br/>
🎧 Most people used them <span>frequently</span>,<br/>
🎧 but not now because the bus <span>companies</span> <span>concentrate</span> on just the <span>routes</span> that <span>attract</span> most <span>passengers</span>.<br/>
🎧 So <span>parts</span> of the <span>town</span> are no <span>longer</span> <span>served</span> by <span>buses</span>.<br/>
🎧 Even <span>replacing</span> old <span>uncomfortable</span> <span>buses</span> with <span>smart</span> new <span>ones</span> has had little <span>impact</span> on <span>passenger</span> <span>numbers</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's sometimes said that bus <span>fares</span> are too high,<br/>
🎧 but in <span>relation</span> to <span>average</span> <span>incomes</span>, <span>fares</span> are not much <span>higher</span> than they were <span>50</span> years ago.<br/>
🎧 Changes in the <span>road</span> <span>network</span> are <span>affecting</span> the <span>town</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>centre</span> was <span>recently</span> <span>closed</span> to <span>traffic</span> on a <span>trial</span> <span>basis</span>, <span>making</span> it much <span>safer</span> for <span>pedestrians</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>impact</span> of this is being <span>measured</span>.<br/>
🎧 The new <span>cycle</span> <span>paths</span> <span>separating</span> <span>bikes</span> from <span>cars</span> in most <span>main</span> <span>roads</span>,<br/>
🎧 are being used <span>far</span> more than was <span>expected</span> <span>reducing</span> <span>traffic</span> and <span>improving</span> air <span>quality</span>.<br/>
🎧 And although the <span>council's</span> <span>attempts</span> to have a <span>bypass</span> <span>constructed</span> have <span>failed</span>,<br/>
🎧 we haven't <span>given</span> up hope of <span>persuading</span> the <span>government</span> to change its <span>mind</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Shopping</span> in the <span>town</span> <span>centre</span> has <span>changed</span> over the years.<br/>
🎧 Many of us can remember when the <span>town</span> was <span>crowded</span> with people going <span>shopping</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Numbers</span> have been <span>falling</span> for <span>several</span> years,<br/>
🎧 <span>despite</span> <span>efforts</span> to <span>attract</span> <span>shoppers</span>, for <span>instance</span> by <span>opening</span> new car <span>parks</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some people <span>combine</span> <span>shopping</span> with <span>visits</span> to the <span>town's</span> <span>restaurants</span> and <span>cafés</span>.<br/>
🎧 Most <span>shops</span> are small <span>independent</span> <span>stores</span>, which is good,<br/>
🎧 but many people <span>prefer</span> to use <span>supermarkets</span> and <span>department</span> <span>stores</span> in <span>nearby</span> large <span>towns</span>,<br/>
🎧 as there are so few <span>well-known</span> <span>chain</span> <span>stores</span> here.<br/>
🎧 <span>Turning</span> now to <span>medical</span> <span>facilities</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>town</span> is <span>served</span> by <span>family</span> <span>doctors</span> in <span>several</span> <span>medical</span> <span>practices</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>fewer</span> than <span>50</span> years ago, but each <span>catering</span> for <span>far</span> more <span>patients</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>hospital</span> <span>closed</span> <span>15</span> years ago,<br/>
🎧 which <span>means</span> <span>journeys</span> to other <span>towns</span> are <span>unavoidable</span>.<br/>
🎧 On the other <span>hand</span>, there are more <span>dentists</span> than there used to be.<br/>
🎧 <span>Employment</span> <span>patterns</span> have <span>changed</span>, along with almost everything else.<br/>
🎧 The number of <span>schools</span> and <span>colleges</span> has <span>increased</span> <span>making</span> that the <span>main</span> <span>employment</span> <span>sector</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Services</span>, such as <span>website</span> <span>design</span> and <span>accountancy</span>, have <span>grown</span> in <span>importance</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>surprisingly</span>, <span>perhaps</span>, <span>manufacturing</span> hasn't <span>seen</span> the <span>decline</span> that has <span>affected</span> it in other <span>parts</span> of the <span>country</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now I'll very quickly <span>outline</span> <span>current</span> <span>plans</span> for some of the <span>town's</span> <span>facilities</span>,<br/>
🎧 before <span>asking</span> for your <span>comments</span>.<br/>
🎧 As you'll know if you <span>regularly</span> use the car <span>park</span> at the <span>railway</span> <span>station</span>, it's usually full.<br/>
🎧 The <span>railway</span> company <span>applied</span> for <span>permission</span> to <span>replace</span> it with a <span>multi-storey</span> car <span>park</span>,<br/>
🎧 but that was <span>refused</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Instead</span>, the company has <span>bought</span> some <span>adjoining</span> <span>land</span>, and this will be used to <span>increase</span> the number of <span>parking</span> <span>spaces</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Grand</span>, the old <span>cinema</span> in the high <span>street</span> will <span>close</span> at the end of the year,<br/>
🎧 and <span>reopen</span> on a different <span>site</span>.<br/>
🎧 You've probably <span>seen</span> the <span>building</span> under <span>construction</span>.<br/>
🎧 The plan is to have <span>three</span> <span>screens</span> with <span>fewer</span> <span>seats</span>, rather than just the one large <span>auditorium</span> in the old <span>cinema</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>expect</span> many of you <span>shop</span> in the <span>indoor</span> <span>market</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's become more and more <span>shabby-looking</span>,<br/>
🎧 and because of <span>fears</span> about <span>safety</span>, it was <span>threatened</span> with <span>demolition</span>.<br/>
🎧 The good <span>news</span> is that it will <span>close</span> for six <span>weeks</span> to be made <span>safe</span> and <span>redecorated</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>improved</span> <span>building</span> will open in <span>July</span>.<br/>
🎧 Lots of people use the <span>library</span>, <span>including</span> school and <span>college</span> students who go there to <span>study</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>council</span> has <span>managed</span> to <span>secure</span> <span>funding</span> to keep the <span>library</span> open later into the <span>evening</span>, <span>twice</span> a week.<br/>
🎧 We would like to <span>enlarge</span> the <span>building</span> in the <span>not-too-distant</span> future,<br/>
🎧 but this is by no <span>means</span> <span>definite</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's no <span>limit</span> on <span>access</span> to the <span>nature</span> <span>reserve</span> on the <span>edge</span> of <span>town</span>,<br/>
🎧 and this will <span>continue</span> to be the case.<br/>
🎧 What will change, though, is that the <span>council</span> will no <span>longer</span> be in <span>charge</span> of the <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Instead</span> it will become the <span>responsibility</span> of a <span>national</span> <span>body<br/></span>
🎧 that <span>administers</span> most <span>nature</span> <span>reserves</span> in the <span>country</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, <span>now..</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Hello, <span>Helen</span>. Sorry I'm <span>late</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hi, <span>Jeremy</span>, no <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well we'd better work out where we are on our <span>project</span>, I <span>suppose</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. I've <span>looked</span> at the <span>drawings</span> you've done for my <span>story</span>, <span>'The</span> <span>Forest'</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I think they're <span>brilliant</span> <span>-</span> they really <span>create</span> the <span>atmosphere</span> I had in <span>mind</span> when I was <span>writing</span> it.<br/>
🎧 I'm glad you like them.<br/>
🎧 There are just a few <span>suggestions</span> I'd like to make.<br/>
🎧 Go ahead.<br/>
🎧 Now, I'm not sure about the <span>drawing</span> of the <span>cave</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it's got <span>trees</span> all around it, which is great,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>drawing's</span> a bit too <span>static</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 I think it needs some <span>action</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, there's <span>nothing</span> <span>happening</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Perhaps</span> I should add the boy <span>-</span> <span>Malcolm</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 He would be <span>walking</span> up to it.<br/>
🎧 Yes, let's have <span>Malcolm</span> in the <span>drawing</span>.<br/>
🎧 And what about <span>putting</span> in a <span>tiger</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 the one that he makes friends with a bit later? Maybe it could be <span>sitting</span> under a <span>tree</span> <span>washing</span> <span>itself</span>.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>tiger</span> <span>stops</span> in the <span>middle</span> of what it's doing when it <span>sees</span> <span>Malcolm</span> <span>walking</span> <span>past</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's a good idea.<br/>
🎧 OK, I'll have a go at that.<br/>
🎧 Then there's the <span>drawing</span> of the <span>crowd</span> of men and <span>women</span> <span>dancing</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're just outside the <span>forest</span>, and there's a lot going on.<br/>
🎧 That's right, you wanted them to be watching a <span>carnival</span> <span>procession</span>, but I thought it would be too <span>crowded</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you think it <span>works</span> like this?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I like what you've done.<br/>
🎧 The only thing is, could you add <span>Malcolm</span> to it, without <span>changing</span> what's already there.<br/>
🎧 What about having him <span>sitting</span> on the <span>tree</span> <span>trunk</span> on the right of the <span>picture</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that would be fine.<br/>
🎧 And do you want him watching the other people?<br/>
🎧 No, he's been <span>left</span> out of all the fun, so I'd like him to be <span>crying</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>that'll</span> <span>contrast</span> <span>nicely</span> with the next <span>picture</span>,<br/>
🎧 where he's <span>laughing</span> at the <span>clowns</span> in the <span>carnival</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, I'll do that.<br/>
🎧 And then the <span>drawing</span> of the people ice <span>skating</span> in the <span>forest</span>.<br/>
🎧 I wasn't too happy with that one.<br/>
🎧 Because they're <span>supposed</span> to be <span>skating</span> on <span>grass</span> aren't they?<br/>
🎧 That's right, and it's <span>frozen</span> over.<br/>
🎧 At the <span>moment</span> it doesn't look quite right.<br/>
🎧 I see what you mean.<br/>
🎧 I'll have another go at that.<br/>
🎧 And I like the <span>wool</span> <span>hats</span> they're <span>wearing</span>.<br/>
🎧 Maybe you could give each of them a <span>scarf</span> as well.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, that's easy enough.<br/>
🎧 They can be <span>streaming</span> out behind the people to <span>suggest</span> they're <span>skating</span> really <span>fast</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 Well that's all on the <span>drawings</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So you've <span>finished</span> <span>writing</span> your <span>story</span> and I just need to <span>finish</span> <span>illustrating</span> it,<br/>
🎧 and my <span>story</span> and your <span>drawings</span> are done.<br/>
🎧 So the next thing is to decide what exactly we need to <span>write</span> about in the <span>report</span> that <span>goes</span> with the <span>stories</span>,<br/>
🎧 and how we're going to <span>divide</span> the work.<br/>
🎧 Right, <span>Helen</span>.<br/>
🎧 What do you think about <span>including</span> a <span>section</span> on how we <span>planned</span> the <span>project</span> as a whole, <span>Jeremy</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's probably quite important.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. Well, you've had most of the good <span>ideas</span> so <span>far</span>.<br/>
🎧 How do you feel about <span>drafting</span> something,<br/>
🎧 then we can go through it together and <span>discuss</span> it?<br/>
🎧 OK, that <span>seems</span> <span>reasonable</span>.<br/>
🎧 And I could <span>include</span> something on how we came up with the <span>ideas</span> for our two <span>stories</span>, couldn't I?<br/>
🎧 Well, I've <span>started</span> <span>writing</span> something about that,<br/>
🎧 so why don't you do the same and we can <span>include</span> the two things.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So what about our <span>interpretation</span> of the <span>stories</span>?<br/>
🎧 Do we need to <span>write</span> about what we think they show,<br/>
🎧 like the <span>value</span> of <span>helping</span> other people, all that <span>sort</span> of thing?<br/>
🎧 That's going to come up later isn't it?<br/>
🎧 I think everyone in the class is going to read each <span>other's</span> <span>stories<br/></span>
🎧 and come up with their own <span>interpretations</span> which we're going to <span>discuss</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I <span>missed</span> that.<br/>
🎧 So it isn't going to be <span>part</span> of the <span>report</span> at all?<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 But we need to <span>write</span> about the <span>illustrations</span>, because they're an <span>essential</span> <span>element</span> of <span>children's</span> <span>experience</span> of <span>reading</span> the <span>stories</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's probably <span>easiest</span> for you to <span>write</span> that <span>section</span>, as you know more about <span>drawing</span> than I do.<br/>
🎧 Maybe, but I find it quite <span>hard</span> to <span>write</span> about.<br/>
🎧 I'd be <span>happier</span> if you did it.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So when do you <span>think…<br/>

🎧 So what I'm going to talk about to you today is something called <span>Ethnography</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is a <span>type</span> of <span>research</span> <span>aimed</span> at <span>exploring</span> the way <span>human</span> <span>cultures</span> work.<br/>
🎧 It was first <span>developed</span> for use in <span>anthropology</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it's also been used in <span>sociology</span> and <span>communication</span> <span>studies</span>.<br/>
🎧 So what's it got to do with <span>business</span>, you may ask.<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>businesses</span> are <span>finding</span> that <span>ethnography</span> can <span>offer</span> them <span>deeper</span> <span>insight</span> into the <span>possible</span> needs of <span>customers</span>,<br/>
🎧 either <span>present</span> or future,<br/>
🎧 as well as <span>providing</span> <span>valuable</span> <span>information</span> about their <span>attitudes</span> <span>towards</span> <span>existing</span> <span>products</span>.<br/>
🎧 And <span>ethnography</span> can also help <span>companies</span> to <span>design</span> new <span>products</span> or <span>services</span> that <span>customers</span> really want.<br/>
🎧 Let's look at some <span>examples</span> of how <span>ethnographic</span> <span>research</span> <span>works</span> in <span>business</span>.<br/>
🎧 One <span>team</span> of <span>researchers</span> did a <span>project</span> for a company <span>manufacturing</span> <span>kitchen</span> <span>equipment</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>watched</span> how <span>cooks</span> used <span>measuring</span> <span>cups</span> to <span>measure</span> out things like <span>sugar</span> and <span>flour</span>.<br/>
🎧 They saw that the <span>cooks</span> had to check and <span>recheck</span> the <span>contents</span>,<br/>
🎧 because although the <span>measuring</span> <span>cups</span> had <span>numbers</span> inside them,<br/>
🎧 the <span>cooks</span> couldn't see these <span>easily</span>.<br/>
🎧 So a new <span>design</span> of cup was <span>developed</span> to <span>overcome</span> this <span>problem</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it was a top <span>seller</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>team</span> of <span>ethnographic</span> <span>researchers</span> <span>looked</span> at how <span>cell</span> <span>phones</span> were used in <span>Uganda</span>, in <span>Africa</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>found</span> that people who didn't have their own <span>phones</span> could pay to use the <span>phones</span> of <span>local</span> <span>entrepreneurs</span>.<br/>
🎧 Because these <span>customers</span> <span>paid</span> in <span>advance</span> for their <span>calls</span>,<br/>
🎧 they were <span>eager</span> to know how much time they'd <span>spent</span> on the call so <span>far</span>.<br/>
🎧 So the phone company <span>designed</span> <span>phones</span> for use <span>globally</span> with this <span>added</span> <span>feature</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ethnographic</span> <span>research</span> has also been <span>carried</span> out in <span>computer</span> <span>companies</span>.<br/>
🎧 In one company, IT <span>systems</span> <span>administrators</span> were <span>observed</span> for <span>several</span> <span>weeks</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>found</span> that a large amount of their work <span>involved</span> <span>communicating</span> with <span>colleagues</span> in order to <span>solve</span> <span>problems</span>,<br/>
🎧 but that they didn't have a <span>standard</span> way of <span>exchanging</span> <span>information</span> from <span>spreadsheets</span> and so on.<br/>
🎧 So the <span>team</span> came up with an idea for <span>software</span> that would help them to do this.<br/>
🎧 In another <span>piece</span> of <span>research</span>, a <span>team</span> <span>observed</span> and <span>talked</span> to <span>nurses</span> working in <span>hospitals</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>led</span> to the <span>recognition</span> that the <span>nurses</span> <span>needed</span> to <span>access</span> the <span>computer</span> <span>records</span> of their <span>patients</span>,<br/>
🎧 no <span>matter</span> where they were.<br/>
🎧 This <span>led</span> to the <span>development</span> of a <span>portable</span> <span>computer</span> <span>tablet<br/></span>
🎧 that <span>allowed</span> the <span>nurses</span> to check <span>records</span> in <span>locations</span> <span>throughout</span> the <span>hospital</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Occasionally</span>, <span>research</span> can be done even in <span>environments</span> where the <span>researchers</span> can't be <span>present</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, in one <span>project</span> done for an <span>airline</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>respondents</span> used their <span>smartphones</span> to <span>record</span> <span>information</span> during <span>airline</span> <span>trips</span>,<br/>
🎧 in a <span>study</span> <span>aiming</span> at <span>tracking</span> the <span>emotions</span> of <span>passengers</span> during a <span>flight</span>.<br/>
🎧 So what makes <span>studies</span> like these different from <span>ordinary</span> <span>research</span>?<br/>
🎧 Let's look at some of the <span>general</span> <span>principles</span> behind <span>ethnographic</span> <span>research</span> in <span>business</span>.<br/>
🎧 First of all, the <span>researcher</span> has to be <span>completely</span> <span>open-minded</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 he or she hasn't thought up a <span>hypothesis</span> to be <span>tested</span>, as is the case in other <span>types</span> of <span>research</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Instead</span> they wait for the <span>participants</span> in the <span>research</span> to <span>inform</span> them.<br/>
🎧 As <span>far</span> as <span>choosing</span> the <span>participants</span> <span>themselves</span> is <span>concerned</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's not really all that different from <span>ordinary</span> <span>research</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>criteria</span> <span>according</span> to which the <span>participants</span> are <span>chosen</span> may be something as simple as the age <span>bracket</span> they <span>fall</span> into,<br/>
🎧 or the <span>researchers</span> may <span>select</span> them <span>according</span> to their <span>income</span>,<br/>
🎧 or they might try to find a set of people who all use a <span>particular</span> product, for example.<br/>
🎧 But it's absolutely <span>crucial</span> to <span>recruit</span> the right people as <span>participants</span>.<br/>
🎧 As well as the <span>criteria</span> I've <span>mentioned</span>,<br/>
🎧 they have to be <span>comfortable</span> talking about <span>themselves<br/></span>
🎧 and being <span>watched</span> as they go about their <span>activities</span>.<br/>
🎧 Actually, most <span>researchers</span> say that people open up <span>pretty</span> <span>easily</span>,<br/>
🎧 maybe because they're often in their own home or <span>workplace</span>.<br/>
🎧 So what makes this <span>type</span> of <span>research</span> special is that it's not just a <span>matter</span> of <span>sending</span> a <span>questionnaire</span> to the <span>participants</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>instead</span> the <span>research</span> is usually <span>based</span> on <span>first-hand</span> <span>observation</span> of what they are doing at the time.<br/>
🎧 But that doesn't mean that the <span>researcher</span> never <span>talks</span> to the <span>participants</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, <span>unlike</span> in <span>traditional</span> <span>research</span>,<br/>
🎧 in this case it's the <span>participant</span> rather than the <span>researchers<br/></span>
🎧 who <span>decides</span> what <span>direction</span> the <span>interview</span> will <span>follow</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>means</span> that there's less <span>likelihood</span> of the <span>researcher</span> <span>imposing</span> his or her own <span>ideas</span> on the <span>participant</span>.<br/>
🎧 But after <span>they've</span> said <span>goodbye</span> to their <span>participants</span> and got back to their <span>office</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>researchers'</span> work isn't <span>finished</span>.<br/>
🎧 Most <span>researchers</span> <span>estimate</span> that <span>70</span> to <span>80</span> <span>percent</span> of their time is <span>spent</span> not on the <span>collecting</span> of <span>data</span> but on its <span>analysis</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 looking at <span>photos</span> <span>listening</span> to <span>recordings</span> and <span>transcribing</span> them and so on.<br/>
🎧 The <span>researchers</span> may end up with <span>hundreds</span> of <span>pages</span> of <span>notes</span>.<br/>
🎧 And to <span>determine</span> what's <span>significant</span>, they don't focus on the <span>sensational</span> things or the <span>unusual</span> things,<br/>
🎧 <span>instead</span> they try to <span>identify</span> a <span>pattern</span> of some <span>sort</span> in all this <span>data</span>,<br/>
🎧 and to <span>discern</span> the <span>meaning</span> behind it.<br/>
🎧 This can <span>result</span> in some <span>compelling</span> <span>insights</span> that can in <span>turn</span> <span>feed</span> back to the whole <span>design</span> <span>process</span>.<br/>
