🎧 <span>Excuse</span> me.<br/>
🎧 Yes?<br/>
🎧 I <span>wonder</span> if you could <span>spare</span> a few <span>minutes</span> to do a <span>survey</span> on <span>transport</span>. It won't take long.<br/>
🎧 No, that's fine.<br/>
🎧 Oh, <span>lovely</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>survey</span> is on <span>behalf</span> of the <span>local</span> <span>council</span>.<br/>
🎧 They'd like to know about what <span>transport</span> you use and any <span>suggestions</span> for <span>improvement</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can I start by <span>asking</span> you how you <span>travelled</span> to <span>town</span> today?<br/>
🎧 Sure. I came on the bus.<br/>
🎧 Great. Now can I get a few <span>details</span> about yourself?<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 What's your name?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>Luisa…<br/></span>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hardie</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can you <span>spell</span> that, please?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's <span>H-A-R-D-I-E</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great. Thanks. And can I have your <span>address</span>?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>19</span>, <span>White</span> <span>Stone</span> <span>Road</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, right. I know that <span>area</span>. It's <span>Bradfield</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 Is the <span>postcode</span> <span>GT7</span>?<br/>
🎧 It's actually <span>GT82LC</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great. And could I ask what your <span>job</span> is?<br/>
🎧 Are you a student?<br/>
🎧 I've actually just <span>finished</span> my <span>training</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm a <span>hairdresser</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, right.<br/>
🎧 And one more <span>question</span> in this <span>section</span>.<br/>
🎧 What is the <span>reason</span> for you <span>coming</span> into <span>town</span> today?<br/>
🎧 Actually it's not for <span>shopping</span> today, which would be my <span>normal</span> <span>reason</span>,<br/>
🎧 but to see the <span>dentist</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right. Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Now in this last <span>section</span> I'd like you to give us some <span>ideas</span> about the <span>facilities</span> and <span>arrangements</span> in the <span>city</span> for getting to and from work,<br/>
🎧 Any <span>suggestions</span> you have for <span>improvements</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, something I've thought about for some time is that when I do <span>walk</span> and I'm doing a later <span>shift</span>,<br/>
🎧 I think the <span>lighting</span> should be better.<br/>
🎧 Yes, good <span>point</span>.<br/>
🎧 And of course, I think it's a <span>real</span> <span>shame</span> <span>they've</span> been <span>cutting</span> down on the number of <span>footpaths</span>.<br/>
🎧 They should have more of those.<br/>
🎧 Then people would <span>walk</span> more.<br/>
🎧 Yes, right.<br/>
🎧 And, I don't think there are enough <span>trains</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's why I don't use them <span>-</span> you have to wait so long.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 And finally I'd like to ask your <span>opinion</span> on <span>cycling</span>.<br/>
🎧 As you may know, there's a drive in the <span>city</span> to get more people to <span>cycle</span> to work.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 But we <span>realise</span> that there are things which the <span>council</span>, but also <span>employers</span>, might do to help <span>encourage</span> <span>workers</span> to <span>cycle</span> to work.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yep</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, I have thought about it and where I work there are no <span>safe</span> <span>places</span> to leave your <span>bikes</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And also, I'd have to <span>cycle</span> <span>uphill<br/></span>
🎧 and on a hot day I'd <span>arrive</span> at work <span>pretty</span> <span>sweaty</span> so I think I'd need a <span>shower</span> somewhere at work.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And I <span>suppose</span> the last thing is that I wouldn't be all that <span>confident</span> about <span>cycling</span> on such <span>busy</span> <span>roads</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think I'd like to see you <span>offering</span> <span>training</span> for that, you know.<br/>
🎧 I'd feel a lot better about <span>starting</span> if that was the case.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's very <span>helpful</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you very much for your time.<br/>
🎧 No <span>problem</span>. Bye.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 I'm very <span>pleased</span> to have this <span>opportunity</span> to say a little about two <span>exciting</span> new <span>developments</span> in the <span>city:<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>Brackenside</span> <span>Open-Air</span> <span>Swimming</span> <span>Pool<br/></span>
🎧 and the <span>children's</span> <span>Adventure</span> <span>Playground</span> in <span>Central</span> <span>Park</span>.<br/>
🎧 As many of you may know,<br/>
🎧 the idea for these <span>initiatives</span> came from you, the <span>public</span>,<br/>
🎧 in the <span>extensive</span> <span>consultation</span> <span>exercise</span> which the <span>City</span> <span>Council</span> <span>conducted</span> last year.<br/>
🎧 And they have been <span>realised</span> <span>using</span> money from the <span>SWRDC</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>South</span> <span>West</span> <span>Regional</span> <span>Development</span> <span>Commission</span>.<br/>
🎧 First of all, <span>Brackenside</span> <span>Pool</span>.<br/>
🎧 As many of the <span>older</span> <span>members</span> of the <span>audience</span> will remember,<br/>
🎧 there used to be a wonderful <span>open-air</span> <span>pool</span> on the sea <span>front</span> <span>30</span> years <span>ago<br/></span>
🎧 but it had to <span>close</span> when it was <span>judged</span> to be <span>unsafe</span>.<br/>
🎧 For the <span>design</span> of this new <span>heated</span> <span>pool</span>,<br/>
🎧 we were very happy to <span>secure</span> the <span>talents</span> of <span>internationally</span> <span>renowned</span> <span>architect</span> <span>Ellen</span> <span>Wendon</span>,<br/>
🎧 who has <span>managed</span> to <span>combine</span> a <span>charming</span> <span>1930s</span> <span>design</span>, which <span>fits</span> in so well with many of the other <span>buildings</span> in the <span>area</span>,<br/>
🎧 with <span>up-to-the-minute</span> <span>features</span> such as a <span>recycling</span> <span>system</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 the only one of its kind in the <span>world</span> <span>-</span> which <span>enables</span> <span>seawater</span> to be used in the <span>pool</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, there has been quite a bit of <span>discussion</span> in the <span>local</span> <span>press<br/></span>
🎧 about <span>whether</span> there would be enough room for the number of <span>visitors</span> we're <span>hoping</span> to <span>attract</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>design</span> is <span>deceptive</span> and there have been <span>rigorous</span> <span>checks</span> about <span>capacity</span>.<br/>
🎧 Also, just in case you were <span>wondering</span>,<br/>
🎧 we're on <span>schedule</span> for a <span>June</span> <span>15th</span> <span>opening</span> date and well <span>within</span> <span>budget:<br/></span>
🎧 a <span>testimony</span> to the <span>excellent</span> work of <span>local</span> <span>contractors</span> <span>Hickman's</span>.<br/>
🎧 We hope that as many people as <span>possible</span> will be there on <span>June</span> <span>15th</span>.<br/>
🎧 We have <span>engaged</span> <span>award-winning</span> <span>actress</span> <span>Coral</span> <span>White</span> to <span>declare</span> the <span>pool</span> <span>open<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>there'll</span> be <span>drinks</span> and <span>snacks</span> <span>available</span> at the <span>pool</span> side.<br/>
🎧 <span>There'll</span> also be a <span>competition</span> for the <span>public</span> to decide on the <span>sculpture</span> we plan to have at the <span>entrance:<br/></span>
🎧 you will decide which famous <span>historical</span> <span>figure</span> from the <span>city</span> we should have.<br/>
🎧 And now, <span>moving</span> on to the <span>Central</span> <span>Park</span> <span>Playground</span>,<br/>
🎧 which we're <span>pleased</span> to <span>announce</span> has just <span>won</span> the <span>Douglas</span> <span>Award</span> for <span>safety:<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>news</span> came through only last week.<br/>
🎧 The <span>unique</span> <span>design</span> is <span>based</span> on the <span>concept</span> of the <span>Global</span> <span>Village</span>,<br/>
🎧 with the <span>playground</span> being <span>divided</span> into <span>6</span> <span>areas</span> <span>showing</span> different <span>parts</span> of the <span>world</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 each with a <span>representative</span> <span>feature</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, there is a <span>section</span> on <span>Asia</span>,<br/>
🎧 and this is <span>represented</span> by <span>rides</span> and <span>equipment</span> in the <span>shape</span> of <span>snakes</span>, <span>orang-utans</span>, <span>tigers</span> and so on <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>fauna</span> <span>native</span> to the <span>forests</span> of the <span>region</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Moving</span> <span>south</span> to the <span>Antarctic</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 we couldn't run to an ice <span>rink</span> I'm <span>afraid<br/></span>
🎧 but <span>opted</span> <span>instead</span> for <span>climbing</span> <span>blocks</span> in the <span>shape</span> of <span>mountains</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 I thought they could have had <span>slides</span> for the <span>glaciers</span> but the <span>designers</span> did want to <span>avoid</span> being too <span>literal</span>!<br/>
🎧 Then on to <span>South</span> <span>America</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and here the <span>theme</span> is <span>El</span> <span>Dorado</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>games</span> <span>replicating</span> the <span>search</span> for <span>mines</span> full of <span>precious</span> <span>stones</span>.<br/>
🎧 And then <span>moving</span> up to <span>North</span> <span>America</span>,<br/>
🎧 here there was <span>considerable</span> <span>debate</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 I know the <span>contribution</span> of <span>cinema</span> and <span>jazz</span> was <span>considered<br/></span>
🎧 but the <span>designers</span> finally <span>opted</span> for <span>rockets</span> and the <span>international</span> <span>Space</span> <span>Station</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Eastwards</span> to <span>Europe</span> then, and <span>perhaps</span> the most <span>traditional</span> <span>choice</span> of all the <span>areas:<br/></span>
🎧 <span>medieval</span> <span>castles</span> and other <span>fortifications</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then last, but not <span>least</span>, <span>moving</span> <span>south</span> to <span>Africa<br/></span>
🎧 and a whole set of wonderful <span>mosaics</span> and <span>trails</span> to <span>represent</span> the great <span>rivers</span> of this <span>fascinating</span> and <span>varied</span> <span>continent</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, the <span>opening</span> date for our <span>Global</span> <span>Playground</span> is the <span>10th</span> of <span>July</span>.<br/>
🎧 And again we'd love to see you there <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 so make a date and come and see this <span>magnificent</span>, <span>original</span> new <span>amenity</span> right in the <span>heart</span> of the <span>city</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Right, well, for our <span>presentation</span> shall I start with the <span>early</span> life of <span>Thor</span> <span>Heyerdahl</span>?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 Why don't you <span>begin</span> with <span>describing</span> the <span>type</span> of boy he was,<br/>
🎧 <span>especially</span> his <span>passion</span> for <span>collecting</span> things.<br/>
🎧 That's right, he had his own little <span>museum</span>.<br/>
🎧 And I think it's <span>unusual</span> for children to <span>develop</span> their own <span>values</span> and not join in their <span>parents'</span> <span>hobbies;<br/></span>
🎧 I'm thinking of how <span>Heyerdahl</span> wouldn't go <span>hunting</span> with his dad, for example.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, he <span>preferred</span> to learn about <span>nature</span> by <span>listening</span> to his <span>mother</span> read to him.<br/>
🎧 And quite <span>early</span> on he <span>knew</span> he wanted to become an <span>explorer</span> when he <span>grew</span> up.<br/>
🎧 That came from his <span>camping</span> <span>trips</span> he went on in <span>Norway</span> I <span>think…<br/></span>
🎧 No, it was <span>climbing</span> that he <span>spent</span> his time on as a young man.<br/>
🎧 Oh, <span>right…<br/></span>
🎧 After university he <span>married</span> a <span>classmate<br/></span>
🎧 and together, they <span>decided</span> to <span>experience</span> living on a small <span>island</span>,<br/>
🎧 to find out how <span>harsh</span> <span>weather</span> <span>conditions</span> <span>shaped</span> <span>people's</span> <span>lifestyles</span>.<br/>
🎧 As <span>part</span> of their <span>preparation</span> before they <span>left</span> home,<br/>
🎧 they <span>learnt</span> <span>basic</span> <span>survival</span> <span>skills</span> like <span>building</span> a <span>shelter</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>guess</span> they <span>needed</span> that <span>knowledge</span> in order to live <span>wild</span> in a <span>remote</span> <span>location<br/></span>
🎧 with few <span>inhabitants</span>, cut off by the sea,<br/>
🎧 which is what they were <span>aiming</span> to do.<br/>
🎧 An important <span>part</span> of your talk should be the <span>radical</span> <span>theory</span> <span>Heyerdahl</span> <span>formed</span> from <span>examining</span> <span>mysterious</span> <span>ancient</span> <span>carvings<br/></span>
🎧 that he <span>happened</span> to find on the <span>island</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think you should <span>finish</span> with that.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 All right, <span>Victor</span>, so after your <span>part<br/></span>
🎧 I'll talk about <span>Thor</span> <span>Heyerdahl's</span> <span>adult</span> life,<br/>
🎧 <span>continuing</span> from the <span>theory</span> he had about <span>Polynesian</span> <span>migration:<br/></span>
🎧 Up until that time of course,<br/>
🎧 <span>academics</span> had <span>believed</span> that <span>humans</span> first <span>migrated</span> to the <span>islands</span> in <span>Polynesia</span> from <span>Asia</span>, in the <span>west</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, they thought that travel from the <span>east</span> was <span>impossible</span>,<br/>
🎧 because of the <span>huge</span>, empty <span>stretch</span> of <span>ocean</span> that <span>lies</span> between the <span>islands</span> and the <span>nearest</span> <span>inhabited</span> <span>land</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but <span>Heyerdahl</span> <span>spent</span> <span>ages</span> <span>studying</span> the <span>cloud</span> <span>movements</span>, <span>ocean</span> <span>currents</span> and <span>wind</span> <span>patterns</span> to find if it was actually <span>possible</span>.<br/>
🎧 And another <span>argument</span> was that there was no <span>tradition</span> of large <span>ship-building</span> in the <span>communities</span> <span>lying</span> to the <span>east</span> of <span>Polynesia</span>.<br/>
🎧 But <span>Heyerdahl</span> <span>knew</span> they made lots of <span>coastal</span> <span>voyages</span> in <span>locally</span> <span>built</span> <span>canoes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, or <span>sailing</span> on <span>rafts</span>, as was <span>shown</span> by the long <span>voyage</span> that <span>Heyerdahl</span> did next.<br/>
🎧 It was an <span>incredibly</span> <span>risky</span> <span>journey</span> to <span>undertake</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 sometimes I <span>wonder</span> if he did that <span>trip</span> for <span>private</span> <span>reasons</span>, you know?<br/>
🎧 To show <span>others</span> that he could have <span>spectacular</span> <span>adventures</span>.<br/>
🎧 What do you think, <span>Olivia</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I think it was more a <span>matter</span> of <span>simply</span> trying out his idea,<br/>
🎧 to see if <span>migration</span> from the <span>east</span> was <span>possible</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's probably it.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>poor</span> guy <span>suffered</span> a bit at that time because the war <span>forced</span> him to <span>stop</span> his work for some <span>years…<br/></span>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 When he got <span>started</span> again and <span>planned</span> his <span>epic</span> <span>voyage</span>,<br/>
🎧 do you think it was important to him that he <span>achieve</span> it before <span>anyone</span> else did?<br/>
🎧 I haven't read <span>anywhere</span> that that was his <span>motivation</span>.<br/>
🎧 The most important <span>factor</span> <span>seems</span> to have been that he use only <span>ancient</span> <span>techniques</span> and <span>local</span> <span>materials</span> to <span>build</span> his <span>raft</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 I <span>wonder</span> how <span>fast</span> it went.<br/>
🎧 Well, it took them <span>97</span> <span>days</span> from <span>South</span> <span>America</span> to the <span>Pacific</span> <span>Islands</span>.<br/>
🎧 And after that, <span>Heyerdahl</span> went to <span>Easter</span> <span>Island</span>, didn't he?<br/>
🎧 We should <span>mention</span> the <span>purpose</span> of that <span>trip</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think he <span>sailed</span> there in a <span>boat</span> made out of <span>reeds</span>.<br/>
🎧 No, that was later on in <span>Egypt</span>, <span>Olivia</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes, that's right.<br/>
🎧 But what he wanted to do was talk to the <span>local</span> people about their old <span>stone</span> <span>carvings<br/></span>
🎧 and then make one <span>himself</span> to learn more about the <span>process</span>.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 Well, what a great life.<br/>
🎧 Even though many of his <span>theories</span> have been <span>disproven</span>,<br/>
🎧 he <span>certainly</span> <span>left</span> a <span>lasting</span> <span>impression</span> on many <span>disciplines</span>, didn't he?<br/>
🎧 To my <span>mind</span>, he was the first person to <span>establish</span> what <span>modern</span> <span>academics</span> call <span>practical</span> <span>archaeology</span>.<br/>
🎧 I mean, that they try to <span>recreate</span> something from the <span>past</span> today,<br/>
🎧 like he did with his <span>raft</span> <span>trip</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>unfortunate</span> that his <span>ideas</span> about where <span>Polynesians</span> <span>originated</span> from have been <span>completely</span> <span>discredited</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Right, well, I'll <span>prepare</span> a <span>PowerPoint</span> <span>slide</span> at the end that <span>acknowledges</span> our <span>sources</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>mainly</span> used The Life and Work of <span>Thor</span> <span>Heyerdahl</span> by <span>William</span> <span>Oliver</span>.<br/>
🎧 I thought the <span>research</span> <span>methods</span> he used were very sound,<br/>
🎧 although I must say I <span>found</span> the <span>overall</span> <span>tone</span> <span>somewhat</span> <span>old-fashioned</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think they need to do a new, <span>revised</span> <span>edition</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I agree.<br/>
🎧 What about the <span>subject</span> <span>matter</span> <span>-</span> I <span>found</span> it really <span>challenging</span>!<br/>
🎧 Well, it's a <span>complex</span> <span>issue…<br/></span>
🎧 I thought the book had lots of good <span>points</span>.<br/>
🎧 What did you think <span>of…<br/>
</span> <span><br/>

🎧 and <span>reading</span> <span>surveys</span> about the future of <span>management</span>.<br/>
🎧 And what I'm going to <span>present</span> in this <span>seminar<br/></span>
🎧 is a few <span>ideas</span> about how the <span>activity</span> is <span>likely</span> to change in the next ten years.<br/>
🎧 It isn't a <span>scientific</span>, <span>statistical</span> <span>analysis</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 just some <span>ideas</span> for us to <span>discuss</span>.<br/>
🎧 One <span>area</span> I want to <span>mention</span> is <span>business</span> <span>markets</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I'm sure a really <span>significant</span> <span>development</span> will be a <span>major</span> <span>increase</span> in <span>competition</span>,<br/>
🎧 with <span>companies</span> from all around the <span>world</span> trying to sell <span>similar</span> <span>products</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Consumers</span> will have much more <span>choice</span>,<br/>
🎧 for <span>instance</span>, food <span>products</span> <span>sold</span> in <span>Australia</span> might be <span>manufactured</span> in the <span>USA</span>, <span>China</span>, <span>Finland</span> and <span>dozens</span> of other <span>countries</span>.<br/>
🎧 At the same time, <span>mergers</span> and <span>takeovers</span> mean that <span>governments</span> are actually <span>losing</span> <span>power</span> to <span>major</span> <span>global</span> <span>corporations</span>.<br/>
🎧 We can probably all think of <span>companies</span> that <span>exert</span> a great <span>deal</span> of <span>influence</span>,<br/>
🎧 which may be good for <span>consumers</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>third</span> <span>point</span> I want to make about <span>markets<br/></span>
🎧 is that in the <span>rapidly</span> <span>expanding</span> <span>economies</span>,<br/>
🎧 such as <span>India</span>, <span>China</span>, <span>Brazil</span> and <span>Russia</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>demand</span> is <span>growing</span> very <span>fast</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is <span>putting</span> <span>pressure</span> on <span>resources</span> all over the <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think <span>businesses</span> are <span>becoming</span> more open to <span>external</span> <span>influences</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>particular</span>, <span>companies</span> are <span>consulting</span> <span>customers</span> more and more before <span>making</span> their <span>business</span> <span>decisions</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Companies</span> are <span>finding</span> out what they want and <span>providing</span> it,<br/>
🎧 <span>instead</span> of <span>making</span> <span>products</span> and then trying to sell them,<br/>
🎧 which is the <span>model</span> of years ago.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>influence</span> is that <span>concerns</span> about the <span>environment</span> will <span>force</span> <span>manufacturers</span> to <span>extend</span> product <span>lifecycles</span>,<br/>
🎧 to <span>reduce</span> the amount of <span>pollution</span> and <span>waste</span>.<br/>
🎧 And in some <span>cases</span>, <span>regulation</span> will need to be <span>strengthened</span>.<br/>
🎧 Many <span>societies</span> are much more <span>fluid</span> and <span>democratic</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>structure</span> of <span>companies</span> is <span>changing</span> to <span>reflect</span> that.<br/>
🎧 I think we're going to see a <span>greater</span> <span>emphasis</span> <span>within</span> <span>companies</span> on <span>teams</span> <span>created</span> with a <span>specific</span> <span>project</span> in <span>mind</span>.<br/>
🎧 And when they're <span>completed</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>teams</span> will be <span>disbanded</span> and new <span>ones</span> <span>formed</span>.<br/>
🎧 More and more people see work as <span>simply</span> one <span>part</span> of their <span>lifestyle</span>,<br/>
🎧 and not the most important one,<br/>
🎧 and as the <span>workforce</span> is <span>shrinking</span> in some <span>countries</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>businesses</span> are having to <span>compete</span> for <span>staff</span> <span>instead</span> of being able to choose <span>among</span> a lot of <span>applicants</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Typical</span> <span>examples</span> that will <span>attract</span> and <span>retain</span> <span>staff</span> are <span>traditional</span> <span>ones</span> like <span>flexible</span> hours and <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 something that has been made <span>possible</span> by <span>advances</span> in <span>technology</span> <span>-</span> <span>remote</span> working,<br/>
🎧 with people <span>based</span> at their home, <span>abroad</span>, or almost <span>anywhere</span> they choose.<br/>
🎧 <span>Management</span> <span>styles</span> will almost <span>certainly</span> <span>continue</span> to change.<br/>
🎧 <span>Senior</span> <span>managers</span> will <span>require</span> a lot more than the <span>efficiency</span> that <span>they've</span> always <span>needed</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Above</span> all they'll need great <span>skills</span> in <span>leadership</span>,<br/>
🎧 so that their <span>organisation</span> can <span>initiate</span> and <span>respond</span> to change in a <span>fast-moving</span> <span>world</span>,<br/>
🎧 where they <span>face</span> lots of <span>competing</span> <span>requirements</span> and <span>potential</span> <span>conflicts</span>.<br/>
🎧 In most of the <span>world</span>, the <span>senior</span> <span>managers</span> of large <span>businesses</span> are <span>mainly</span> men in their <span>fifties</span> and <span>sixties</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>predominant</span> <span>style</span> of <span>management</span> will almost <span>certainly</span> become more <span>consultative</span> and <span>collaborative</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>caused</span> <span>above</span> all, by more <span>women</span> <span>moving</span> into <span>senior</span> <span>management</span> <span>positions</span>.<br/>
🎧 Many of the changes are <span>influenced</span> by <span>developments</span> in the <span>wider</span> <span>economy</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>traditional</span> <span>emphasis</span> of <span>business</span> was <span>manufacturing</span>,<br/>
🎧 and of course the <span>service</span> <span>sector</span> is very important.<br/>
🎧 But we shouldn't <span>overlook</span> the <span>growing</span> <span>financial</span> <span>contribution</span> of <span>IP</span>, that is, <span>intellectual</span> <span>property</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some books and <span>films</span> <span>generate</span> <span>enormous</span> <span>sums</span> from the <span>sale</span> of <span>related</span> <span>DVDs</span>, music, <span>games</span>, <span>clothes</span>, and so on.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>point</span> I'd like to make is that although I've been talking about <span>companies</span>,<br/>
🎧 one <span>trend</span> that they have to <span>face</span> is the move away from people working for the same <span>employer</span> for years.<br/>
🎧 <span>Instead</span>, more and more people are <span>becoming</span> <span>self-employed</span>,<br/>
🎧 to <span>gain</span> the <span>freedom</span> and <span>control</span> over their lives that they're <span>unlikely</span> to get from being <span>employed</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, well that's all I want to say,<br/>
🎧 so let's open it up for <span>discussion</span>.<br/>
