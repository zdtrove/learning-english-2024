🎧 Excuse me.<br/>
🎧 Yes?<br/>
🎧 I wonder if you could spare a few minutes to do a survey on transport. It won't take long.<br/>
🎧 No, that's fine.<br/>
🎧 Oh, lovely.<br/>
🎧 The survey is on behalf of the local council.<br/>
🎧 They'd like to know about what transport you use and any suggestions for improvement.<br/>
🎧 Can I start by asking you how you travelled to town today?<br/>
🎧 Sure. I came on the bus.<br/>
🎧 Great. Now can I get a few details about yourself?<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 What's your name?<br/>
🎧 It's Luisa…<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Hardie.<br/>
🎧 Can you spell that, please?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's H-A-R-D-I-E.<br/>
🎧 Great. Thanks. And can I have your address?<br/>
🎧 It's 19, White Stone Road.<br/>
🎧 Oh, right. I know that area. It's Bradfield, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 Is the postcode GT7?<br/>
🎧 It's actually GT82LC.<br/>
🎧 Great. And could I ask what your job is?<br/>
🎧 Are you a student?<br/>
🎧 I've actually just finished my training.<br/>
🎧 I'm a hairdresser.<br/>
🎧 Oh, right.<br/>
🎧 And one more question in this section.<br/>
🎧 What is the reason for you coming into town today?<br/>
🎧 Actually it's not for shopping today, which would be my normal reason,<br/>
🎧 but to see the dentist.<br/>
🎧 Right. Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Now in this last section I'd like you to give us some ideas about the facilities and arrangements in the city for getting to and from work,<br/>
🎧 Any suggestions you have for improvements?<br/>
🎧 Well, something I've thought about for some time is that when I do walk and I'm doing a later shift,<br/>
🎧 I think the lighting should be better.<br/>
🎧 Yes, good point.<br/>
🎧 And of course, I think it's a real shame they've been cutting down on the number of footpaths.<br/>
🎧 They should have more of those.<br/>
🎧 Then people would walk more.<br/>
🎧 Yes, right.<br/>
🎧 And, I don't think there are enough trains.<br/>
🎧 That's why I don't use them - you have to wait so long.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 And finally I'd like to ask your opinion on cycling.<br/>
🎧 As you may know, there's a drive in the city to get more people to cycle to work.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 But we realise that there are things which the council, but also employers, might do to help encourage workers to cycle to work.<br/>
🎧 Yep.<br/>
🎧 Well, I have thought about it and where I work there are no safe places to leave your bikes.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And also, I'd have to cycle uphill<br/>
🎧 and on a hot day I'd arrive at work pretty sweaty so I think I'd need a shower somewhere at work.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And I suppose the last thing is that I wouldn't be all that confident about cycling on such busy roads.<br/>
🎧 I think I'd like to see you offering training for that, you know.<br/>
🎧 I'd feel a lot better about starting if that was the case.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's very helpful.<br/>
🎧 Thank you very much for your time.<br/>
🎧 No problem. Bye.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 I'm very pleased to have this opportunity to say a little about two exciting new developments in the city:<br/>
🎧 the Brackenside Open-Air Swimming Pool<br/>
🎧 and the children's Adventure Playground in Central Park.<br/>
🎧 As many of you may know,<br/>
🎧 the idea for these initiatives came from you, the public,<br/>
🎧 in the extensive consultation exercise which the City Council conducted last year.<br/>
🎧 And they have been realised using money from the SWRDC -<br/>
🎧 the South West Regional Development Commission.<br/>
🎧 First of all, Brackenside Pool.<br/>
🎧 As many of the older members of the audience will remember,<br/>
🎧 there used to be a wonderful open-air pool on the sea front 30 years ago<br/>
🎧 but it had to close when it was judged to be unsafe.<br/>
🎧 For the design of this new heated pool,<br/>
🎧 we were very happy to secure the talents of internationally renowned architect Ellen Wendon,<br/>
🎧 who has managed to combine a charming 1930s design, which fits in so well with many of the other buildings in the area,<br/>
🎧 with up-to-the-minute features such as a recycling system -<br/>
🎧 the only one of its kind in the world - which enables seawater to be used in the pool.<br/>
🎧 Now, there has been quite a bit of discussion in the local press<br/>
🎧 about whether there would be enough room for the number of visitors we're hoping to attract,<br/>
🎧 but the design is deceptive and there have been rigorous checks about capacity.<br/>
🎧 Also, just in case you were wondering,<br/>
🎧 we're on schedule for a June 15th opening date and well within budget:<br/>
🎧 a testimony to the excellent work of local contractors Hickman's.<br/>
🎧 We hope that as many people as possible will be there on June 15th.<br/>
🎧 We have engaged award-winning actress Coral White to declare the pool open<br/>
🎧 and there'll be drinks and snacks available at the pool side.<br/>
🎧 There'll also be a competition for the public to decide on the sculpture we plan to have at the entrance:<br/>
🎧 you will decide which famous historical figure from the city we should have.<br/>
🎧 And now, moving on to the Central Park Playground,<br/>
🎧 which we're pleased to announce has just won the Douglas Award for safety:<br/>
🎧 the news came through only last week.<br/>
🎧 The unique design is based on the concept of the Global Village,<br/>
🎧 with the playground being divided into 6 areas showing different parts of the world -<br/>
🎧 each with a representative feature.<br/>
🎧 For example, there is a section on Asia,<br/>
🎧 and this is represented by rides and equipment in the shape of snakes, orang-utans, tigers and so on -<br/>
🎧 fauna native to the forests of the region.<br/>
🎧 Moving south to the Antarctic -<br/>
🎧 we couldn't run to an ice rink I'm afraid<br/>
🎧 but opted instead for climbing blocks in the shape of mountains -<br/>
🎧 I thought they could have had slides for the glaciers but the designers did want to avoid being too literal!<br/>
🎧 Then on to South America -<br/>
🎧 and here the theme is El Dorado -<br/>
🎧 games replicating the search for mines full of precious stones.<br/>
🎧 And then moving up to North America,<br/>
🎧 here there was considerable debate -<br/>
🎧 I know the contribution of cinema and jazz was considered<br/>
🎧 but the designers finally opted for rockets and the international Space Station.<br/>
🎧 Eastwards to Europe then, and perhaps the most traditional choice of all the areas:<br/>
🎧 medieval castles and other fortifications.<br/>
🎧 Then last, but not least, moving south to Africa<br/>
🎧 and a whole set of wonderful mosaics and trails to represent the great rivers of this fascinating and varied continent.<br/>
🎧 Now, the opening date for our Global Playground is the 10th of July.<br/>
🎧 And again we'd love to see you there -<br/>
🎧 so make a date and come and see this magnificent, original new amenity right in the heart of the city.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Right, well, for our presentation shall I start with the early life of Thor Heyerdahl?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 Why don't you begin with describing the type of boy he was,<br/>
🎧 especially his passion for collecting things.<br/>
🎧 That's right, he had his own little museum.<br/>
🎧 And I think it's unusual for children to develop their own values and not join in their parents' hobbies;<br/>
🎧 I'm thinking of how Heyerdahl wouldn't go hunting with his dad, for example.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, he preferred to learn about nature by listening to his mother read to him.<br/>
🎧 And quite early on he knew he wanted to become an explorer when he grew up.<br/>
🎧 That came from his camping trips he went on in Norway I think…<br/>
🎧 No, it was climbing that he spent his time on as a young man.<br/>
🎧 Oh, right…<br/>
🎧 After university he married a classmate<br/>
🎧 and together, they decided to experience living on a small island,<br/>
🎧 to find out how harsh weather conditions shaped people's lifestyles.<br/>
🎧 As part of their preparation before they left home,<br/>
🎧 they learnt basic survival skills like building a shelter.<br/>
🎧 I guess they needed that knowledge in order to live wild in a remote location<br/>
🎧 with few inhabitants, cut off by the sea,<br/>
🎧 which is what they were aiming to do.<br/>
🎧 An important part of your talk should be the radical theory Heyerdahl formed from examining mysterious ancient carvings<br/>
🎧 that he happened to find on the island.<br/>
🎧 I think you should finish with that.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 All right, Victor, so after your part<br/>
🎧 I'll talk about Thor Heyerdahl's adult life,<br/>
🎧 continuing from the theory he had about Polynesian migration:<br/>
🎧 Up until that time of course,<br/>
🎧 academics had believed that humans first migrated to the islands in Polynesia from Asia, in the west.<br/>
🎧 Yes, they thought that travel from the east was impossible,<br/>
🎧 because of the huge, empty stretch of ocean that lies between the islands and the nearest inhabited land.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but Heyerdahl spent ages studying the cloud movements, ocean currents and wind patterns to find if it was actually possible.<br/>
🎧 And another argument was that there was no tradition of large ship-building in the communities lying to the east of Polynesia.<br/>
🎧 But Heyerdahl knew they made lots of coastal voyages in locally built canoes.<br/>
🎧 Yes, or sailing on rafts, as was shown by the long voyage that Heyerdahl did next.<br/>
🎧 It was an incredibly risky journey to undertake -<br/>
🎧 sometimes I wonder if he did that trip for private reasons, you know?<br/>
🎧 To show others that he could have spectacular adventures.<br/>
🎧 What do you think, Olivia?<br/>
🎧 Well, I think it was more a matter of simply trying out his idea,<br/>
🎧 to see if migration from the east was possible.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's probably it.<br/>
🎧 And the poor guy suffered a bit at that time because the war forced him to stop his work for some years…<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 When he got started again and planned his epic voyage,<br/>
🎧 do you think it was important to him that he achieve it before anyone else did?<br/>
🎧 I haven't read anywhere that that was his motivation.<br/>
🎧 The most important factor seems to have been that he use only ancient techniques and local materials to build his raft.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 I wonder how fast it went.<br/>
🎧 Well, it took them 97 days from South America to the Pacific Islands.<br/>
🎧 And after that, Heyerdahl went to Easter Island, didn't he?<br/>
🎧 We should mention the purpose of that trip.<br/>
🎧 I think he sailed there in a boat made out of reeds.<br/>
🎧 No, that was later on in Egypt, Olivia.<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes, that's right.<br/>
🎧 But what he wanted to do was talk to the local people about their old stone carvings<br/>
🎧 and then make one himself to learn more about the process.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 Well, what a great life.<br/>
🎧 Even though many of his theories have been disproven,<br/>
🎧 he certainly left a lasting impression on many disciplines, didn't he?<br/>
🎧 To my mind, he was the first person to establish what modern academics call practical archaeology.<br/>
🎧 I mean, that they try to recreate something from the past today,<br/>
🎧 like he did with his raft trip.<br/>
🎧 It's unfortunate that his ideas about where Polynesians originated from have been completely discredited.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Right, well, I'll prepare a PowerPoint slide at the end that acknowledges our sources.<br/>
🎧 I mainly used The Life and Work of Thor Heyerdahl by William Oliver.<br/>
🎧 I thought the research methods he used were very sound,<br/>
🎧 although I must say I found the overall tone somewhat old-fashioned.<br/>
🎧 I think they need to do a new, revised edition.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I agree.<br/>
🎧 What about the subject matter - I found it really challenging!<br/>
🎧 Well, it's a complex issue…<br/>
🎧 I thought the book had lots of good points.<br/>
🎧 What did you think of…<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Well, I've been talking to managers in a number of businesses,<br/>
🎧 and reading surveys about the future of management.<br/>
🎧 And what I'm going to present in this seminar<br/>
🎧 is a few ideas about how the activity is likely to change in the next ten years.<br/>
🎧 It isn't a scientific, statistical analysis -<br/>
🎧 just some ideas for us to discuss.<br/>
🎧 One area I want to mention is business markets,<br/>
🎧 and I'm sure a really significant development will be a major increase in competition,<br/>
🎧 with companies from all around the world trying to sell similar products.<br/>
🎧 Consumers will have much more choice,<br/>
🎧 for instance, food products sold in Australia might be manufactured in the USA, China, Finland and dozens of other countries.<br/>
🎧 At the same time, mergers and takeovers mean that governments are actually losing power to major global corporations.<br/>
🎧 We can probably all think of companies that exert a great deal of influence,<br/>
🎧 which may be good for consumers.<br/>
🎧 A third point I want to make about markets<br/>
🎧 is that in the rapidly expanding economies,<br/>
🎧 such as India, China, Brazil and Russia,<br/>
🎧 demand is growing very fast.<br/>
🎧 This is putting pressure on resources all over the world.<br/>
🎧 I think businesses are becoming more open to external influences.<br/>
🎧 In particular, companies are consulting customers more and more before making their business decisions.<br/>
🎧 Companies are finding out what they want and providing it,<br/>
🎧 instead of making products and then trying to sell them,<br/>
🎧 which is the model of years ago.<br/>
🎧 Another influence is that concerns about the environment will force manufacturers to extend product lifecycles,<br/>
🎧 to reduce the amount of pollution and waste.<br/>
🎧 And in some cases, regulation will need to be strengthened.<br/>
🎧 Many societies are much more fluid and democratic,<br/>
🎧 and the structure of companies is changing to reflect that.<br/>
🎧 I think we're going to see a greater emphasis within companies on teams created with a specific project in mind.<br/>
🎧 And when they're completed,<br/>
🎧 the teams will be disbanded and new ones formed.<br/>
🎧 More and more people see work as simply one part of their lifestyle,<br/>
🎧 and not the most important one,<br/>
🎧 and as the workforce is shrinking in some countries,<br/>
🎧 businesses are having to compete for staff instead of being able to choose among a lot of applicants.<br/>
🎧 Typical examples that will attract and retain staff are traditional ones like flexible hours and -<br/>
🎧 something that has been made possible by advances in technology - remote working,<br/>
🎧 with people based at their home, abroad, or almost anywhere they choose.<br/>
🎧 Management styles will almost certainly continue to change.<br/>
🎧 Senior managers will require a lot more than the efficiency that they've always needed.<br/>
🎧 Above all they'll need great skills in leadership,<br/>
🎧 so that their organisation can initiate and respond to change in a fast-moving world,<br/>
🎧 where they face lots of competing requirements and potential conflicts.<br/>
🎧 In most of the world, the senior managers of large businesses are mainly men in their fifties and sixties.<br/>
🎧 The predominant style of management will almost certainly become more consultative and collaborative,<br/>
🎧 caused above all, by more women moving into senior management positions.<br/>
🎧 Many of the changes are influenced by developments in the wider economy.<br/>
🎧 The traditional emphasis of business was manufacturing,<br/>
🎧 and of course the service sector is very important.<br/>
🎧 But we shouldn't overlook the growing financial contribution of IP, that is, intellectual property.<br/>
🎧 Some books and films generate enormous sums from the sale of related DVDs, music, games, clothes, and so on.<br/>
🎧 Another point I'd like to make is that although I've been talking about companies,<br/>
🎧 one trend that they have to face is the move away from people working for the same employer for years.<br/>
🎧 Instead, more and more people are becoming self-employed,<br/>
🎧 to gain the freedom and control over their lives that they're unlikely to get from being employed.<br/>
🎧 OK, well that's all I want to say,<br/>
🎧 so let's open it up for discussion.<br/>
<br/><br/>
