🎧 <span>Excuse me.<br/>
🎧 Yes?<br/>
🎧 I <span>wonder if you could <span>spare a few <span>minutes to do a <span>survey on <span>transport. It won't take long.<br/>
🎧 No, that's fine.<br/>
🎧 Oh, <span>lovely.<br/>
🎧 The <span>survey is on <span>behalf of the <span>local <span>council.<br/>
🎧 They'd like to know about what <span>transport you use and any <span>suggestions for <span>improvement.<br/>
🎧 Can I start by <span>asking you how you <span>travelled to <span>town today?<br/>
🎧 Sure. I came on the bus.<br/>
🎧 Great. Now can I get a few <span>details about yourself?<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 What's your name?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>Luisa…<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hardie.<br/>
🎧 Can you <span>spell that, please?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's <span>H-A-R-D-I-E.<br/>
🎧 Great. Thanks. And can I have your <span>address?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>19, <span>White <span>Stone <span>Road.<br/>
🎧 Oh, right. I know that <span>area. It's <span>Bradfield, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 Is the <span>postcode <span>GT7?<br/>
🎧 It's actually <span>GT82LC.<br/>
🎧 Great. And could I ask what your <span>job is?<br/>
🎧 Are you a student?<br/>
🎧 I've actually just <span>finished my <span>training.<br/>
🎧 I'm a <span>hairdresser.<br/>
🎧 Oh, right.<br/>
🎧 And one more <span>question in this <span>section.<br/>
🎧 What is the <span>reason for you <span>coming into <span>town today?<br/>
🎧 Actually it's not for <span>shopping today, which would be my <span>normal <span>reason,<br/>
🎧 but to see the <span>dentist.<br/>
🎧 Right. Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Now in this last <span>section I'd like you to give us some <span>ideas about the <span>facilities and <span>arrangements in the <span>city for getting to and from work,<br/>
🎧 Any <span>suggestions you have for <span>improvements?<br/>
🎧 Well, something I've thought about for some time is that when I do <span>walk and I'm doing a later <span>shift,<br/>
🎧 I think the <span>lighting should be better.<br/>
🎧 Yes, good <span>point.<br/>
🎧 And of course, I think it's a <span>real <span>shame <span>they've been <span>cutting down on the number of <span>footpaths.<br/>
🎧 They should have more of those.<br/>
🎧 Then people would <span>walk more.<br/>
🎧 Yes, right.<br/>
🎧 And, I don't think there are enough <span>trains.<br/>
🎧 That's why I don't use them <span>- you have to wait so long.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 And finally I'd like to ask your <span>opinion on <span>cycling.<br/>
🎧 As you may know, there's a drive in the <span>city to get more people to <span>cycle to work.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 But we <span>realise that there are things which the <span>council, but also <span>employers, might do to help <span>encourage <span>workers to <span>cycle to work.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yep.<br/>
🎧 Well, I have thought about it and where I work there are no <span>safe <span>places to leave your <span>bikes.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And also, I'd have to <span>cycle <span>uphill<br/>
🎧 and on a hot day I'd <span>arrive at work <span>pretty <span>sweaty so I think I'd need a <span>shower somewhere at work.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And I <span>suppose the last thing is that I wouldn't be all that <span>confident about <span>cycling on such <span>busy <span>roads.<br/>
🎧 I think I'd like to see you <span>offering <span>training for that, you know.<br/>
🎧 I'd feel a lot better about <span>starting if that was the case.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's very <span>helpful.<br/>
🎧 Thank you very much for your time.<br/>
🎧 No <span>problem. Bye.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 I'm very <span>pleased to have this <span>opportunity to say a little about two <span>exciting new <span>developments in the <span>city:<br/>
🎧 the <span>Brackenside <span>Open-Air <span>Swimming <span>Pool<br/>
🎧 and the <span>children's <span>Adventure <span>Playground in <span>Central <span>Park.<br/>
🎧 As many of you may know,<br/>
🎧 the idea for these <span>initiatives came from you, the <span>public,<br/>
🎧 in the <span>extensive <span>consultation <span>exercise which the <span>City <span>Council <span>conducted last year.<br/>
🎧 And they have been <span>realised <span>using money from the <span>SWRDC <span>-<br/>
🎧 the <span>South <span>West <span>Regional <span>Development <span>Commission.<br/>
🎧 First of all, <span>Brackenside <span>Pool.<br/>
🎧 As many of the <span>older <span>members of the <span>audience will remember,<br/>
🎧 there used to be a wonderful <span>open-air <span>pool on the sea <span>front <span>30 years <span>ago<br/>
🎧 but it had to <span>close when it was <span>judged to be <span>unsafe.<br/>
🎧 For the <span>design of this new <span>heated <span>pool,<br/>
🎧 we were very happy to <span>secure the <span>talents of <span>internationally <span>renowned <span>architect <span>Ellen <span>Wendon,<br/>
🎧 who has <span>managed to <span>combine a <span>charming <span>1930s <span>design, which <span>fits in so well with many of the other <span>buildings in the <span>area,<br/>
🎧 with <span>up-to-the-minute <span>features such as a <span>recycling <span>system <span>-<br/>
🎧 the only one of its kind in the <span>world <span>- which <span>enables <span>seawater to be used in the <span>pool.<br/>
🎧 Now, there has been quite a bit of <span>discussion in the <span>local <span>press<br/>
🎧 about <span>whether there would be enough room for the number of <span>visitors we're <span>hoping to <span>attract,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>design is <span>deceptive and there have been <span>rigorous <span>checks about <span>capacity.<br/>
🎧 Also, just in case you were <span>wondering,<br/>
🎧 we're on <span>schedule for a <span>June <span>15th <span>opening date and well <span>within <span>budget:<br/>
🎧 a <span>testimony to the <span>excellent work of <span>local <span>contractors <span>Hickman's.<br/>
🎧 We hope that as many people as <span>possible will be there on <span>June <span>15th.<br/>
🎧 We have <span>engaged <span>award-winning <span>actress <span>Coral <span>White to <span>declare the <span>pool <span>open<br/>
🎧 and <span>there'll be <span>drinks and <span>snacks <span>available at the <span>pool side.<br/>
🎧 <span>There'll also be a <span>competition for the <span>public to decide on the <span>sculpture we plan to have at the <span>entrance:<br/>
🎧 you will decide which famous <span>historical <span>figure from the <span>city we should have.<br/>
🎧 And now, <span>moving on to the <span>Central <span>Park <span>Playground,<br/>
🎧 which we're <span>pleased to <span>announce has just <span>won the <span>Douglas <span>Award for <span>safety:<br/>
🎧 the <span>news came through only last week.<br/>
🎧 The <span>unique <span>design is <span>based on the <span>concept of the <span>Global <span>Village,<br/>
🎧 with the <span>playground being <span>divided into <span>6 <span>areas <span>showing different <span>parts of the <span>world <span>-<br/>
🎧 each with a <span>representative <span>feature.<br/>
🎧 For example, there is a <span>section on <span>Asia,<br/>
🎧 and this is <span>represented by <span>rides and <span>equipment in the <span>shape of <span>snakes, <span>orang-utans, <span>tigers and so on <span>-<br/>
🎧 <span>fauna <span>native to the <span>forests of the <span>region.<br/>
🎧 <span>Moving <span>south to the <span>Antarctic <span>-<br/>
🎧 we couldn't run to an ice <span>rink I'm <span>afraid<br/>
🎧 but <span>opted <span>instead for <span>climbing <span>blocks in the <span>shape of <span>mountains <span>-<br/>
🎧 I thought they could have had <span>slides for the <span>glaciers but the <span>designers did want to <span>avoid being too <span>literal!<br/>
🎧 Then on to <span>South <span>America <span>-<br/>
🎧 and here the <span>theme is <span>El <span>Dorado <span>-<br/>
🎧 <span>games <span>replicating the <span>search for <span>mines full of <span>precious <span>stones.<br/>
🎧 And then <span>moving up to <span>North <span>America,<br/>
🎧 here there was <span>considerable <span>debate <span>-<br/>
🎧 I know the <span>contribution of <span>cinema and <span>jazz was <span>considered<br/>
🎧 but the <span>designers finally <span>opted for <span>rockets and the <span>international <span>Space <span>Station.<br/>
🎧 <span>Eastwards to <span>Europe then, and <span>perhaps the most <span>traditional <span>choice of all the <span>areas:<br/>
🎧 <span>medieval <span>castles and other <span>fortifications.<br/>
🎧 Then last, but not <span>least, <span>moving <span>south to <span>Africa<br/>
🎧 and a whole set of wonderful <span>mosaics and <span>trails to <span>represent the great <span>rivers of this <span>fascinating and <span>varied <span>continent.<br/>
🎧 Now, the <span>opening date for our <span>Global <span>Playground is the <span>10th of <span>July.<br/>
🎧 And again we'd love to see you there <span>-<br/>
🎧 so make a date and come and see this <span>magnificent, <span>original new <span>amenity right in the <span>heart of the <span>city.<br/>
 <span><br/>

</div>
🎧 Right, well, for our <span>presentation shall I start with the <span>early life of <span>Thor <span>Heyerdahl?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 Why don't you <span>begin with <span>describing the <span>type of boy he was,<br/>
🎧 <span>especially his <span>passion for <span>collecting things.<br/>
🎧 That's right, he had his own little <span>museum.<br/>
🎧 And I think it's <span>unusual for children to <span>develop their own <span>values and not join in their <span>parents' <span>hobbies;<br/>
🎧 I'm thinking of how <span>Heyerdahl wouldn't go <span>hunting with his dad, for example.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, he <span>preferred to learn about <span>nature by <span>listening to his <span>mother read to him.<br/>
🎧 And quite <span>early on he <span>knew he wanted to become an <span>explorer when he <span>grew up.<br/>
🎧 That came from his <span>camping <span>trips he went on in <span>Norway I <span>think…<br/>
🎧 No, it was <span>climbing that he <span>spent his time on as a young man.<br/>
🎧 Oh, <span>right…<br/>
🎧 After university he <span>married a <span>classmate<br/>
🎧 and together, they <span>decided to <span>experience living on a small <span>island,<br/>
🎧 to find out how <span>harsh <span>weather <span>conditions <span>shaped <span>people's <span>lifestyles.<br/>
🎧 As <span>part of their <span>preparation before they <span>left home,<br/>
🎧 they <span>learnt <span>basic <span>survival <span>skills like <span>building a <span>shelter.<br/>
🎧 I <span>guess they <span>needed that <span>knowledge in order to live <span>wild in a <span>remote <span>location<br/>
🎧 with few <span>inhabitants, cut off by the sea,<br/>
🎧 which is what they were <span>aiming to do.<br/>
🎧 An important <span>part of your talk should be the <span>radical <span>theory <span>Heyerdahl <span>formed from <span>examining <span>mysterious <span>ancient <span>carvings<br/>
🎧 that he <span>happened to find on the <span>island.<br/>
🎧 I think you should <span>finish with that.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 All right, <span>Victor, so after your <span>part<br/>
🎧 I'll talk about <span>Thor <span>Heyerdahl's <span>adult life,<br/>
🎧 <span>continuing from the <span>theory he had about <span>Polynesian <span>migration:<br/>
🎧 Up until that time of course,<br/>
🎧 <span>academics had <span>believed that <span>humans first <span>migrated to the <span>islands in <span>Polynesia from <span>Asia, in the <span>west.<br/>
🎧 Yes, they thought that travel from the <span>east was <span>impossible,<br/>
🎧 because of the <span>huge, empty <span>stretch of <span>ocean that <span>lies between the <span>islands and the <span>nearest <span>inhabited <span>land.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but <span>Heyerdahl <span>spent <span>ages <span>studying the <span>cloud <span>movements, <span>ocean <span>currents and <span>wind <span>patterns to find if it was actually <span>possible.<br/>
🎧 And another <span>argument was that there was no <span>tradition of large <span>ship-building in the <span>communities <span>lying to the <span>east of <span>Polynesia.<br/>
🎧 But <span>Heyerdahl <span>knew they made lots of <span>coastal <span>voyages in <span>locally <span>built <span>canoes.<br/>
🎧 Yes, or <span>sailing on <span>rafts, as was <span>shown by the long <span>voyage that <span>Heyerdahl did next.<br/>
🎧 It was an <span>incredibly <span>risky <span>journey to <span>undertake <span>-<br/>
🎧 sometimes I <span>wonder if he did that <span>trip for <span>private <span>reasons, you know?<br/>
🎧 To show <span>others that he could have <span>spectacular <span>adventures.<br/>
🎧 What do you think, <span>Olivia?<br/>
🎧 Well, I think it was more a <span>matter of <span>simply trying out his idea,<br/>
🎧 to see if <span>migration from the <span>east was <span>possible.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's probably it.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>poor guy <span>suffered a bit at that time because the war <span>forced him to <span>stop his work for some <span>years…<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 When he got <span>started again and <span>planned his <span>epic <span>voyage,<br/>
🎧 do you think it was important to him that he <span>achieve it before <span>anyone else did?<br/>
🎧 I haven't read <span>anywhere that that was his <span>motivation.<br/>
🎧 The most important <span>factor <span>seems to have been that he use only <span>ancient <span>techniques and <span>local <span>materials to <span>build his <span>raft.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 I <span>wonder how <span>fast it went.<br/>
🎧 Well, it took them <span>97 <span>days from <span>South <span>America to the <span>Pacific <span>Islands.<br/>
🎧 And after that, <span>Heyerdahl went to <span>Easter <span>Island, didn't he?<br/>
🎧 We should <span>mention the <span>purpose of that <span>trip.<br/>
🎧 I think he <span>sailed there in a <span>boat made out of <span>reeds.<br/>
🎧 No, that was later on in <span>Egypt, <span>Olivia.<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes, that's right.<br/>
🎧 But what he wanted to do was talk to the <span>local people about their old <span>stone <span>carvings<br/>
🎧 and then make one <span>himself to learn more about the <span>process.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 Well, what a great life.<br/>
🎧 Even though many of his <span>theories have been <span>disproven,<br/>
🎧 he <span>certainly <span>left a <span>lasting <span>impression on many <span>disciplines, didn't he?<br/>
🎧 To my <span>mind, he was the first person to <span>establish what <span>modern <span>academics call <span>practical <span>archaeology.<br/>
🎧 I mean, that they try to <span>recreate something from the <span>past today,<br/>
🎧 like he did with his <span>raft <span>trip.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>unfortunate that his <span>ideas about where <span>Polynesians <span>originated from have been <span>completely <span>discredited.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Right, well, I'll <span>prepare a <span>PowerPoint <span>slide at the end that <span>acknowledges our <span>sources.<br/>
🎧 I <span>mainly used The Life and Work of <span>Thor <span>Heyerdahl by <span>William <span>Oliver.<br/>
🎧 I thought the <span>research <span>methods he used were very sound,<br/>
🎧 although I must say I <span>found the <span>overall <span>tone <span>somewhat <span>old-fashioned.<br/>
🎧 I think they need to do a new, <span>revised <span>edition.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I agree.<br/>
🎧 What about the <span>subject <span>matter <span>- I <span>found it really <span>challenging!<br/>
🎧 Well, it's a <span>complex <span>issue…<br/>
🎧 I thought the book had lots of good <span>points.<br/>
🎧 What did you think <span>of…<br/>
 <span><br/>

</div>
🎧 Well, I've been talking to <span>managers in a number of <span>businesses,<br/>
🎧 and <span>reading <span>surveys about the future of <span>management.<br/>
🎧 And what I'm going to <span>present in this <span>seminar<br/>
🎧 is a few <span>ideas about how the <span>activity is <span>likely to change in the next ten years.<br/>
🎧 It isn't a <span>scientific, <span>statistical <span>analysis <span>-<br/>
🎧 just some <span>ideas for us to <span>discuss.<br/>
🎧 One <span>area I want to <span>mention is <span>business <span>markets,<br/>
🎧 and I'm sure a really <span>significant <span>development will be a <span>major <span>increase in <span>competition,<br/>
🎧 with <span>companies from all around the <span>world trying to sell <span>similar <span>products.<br/>
🎧 <span>Consumers will have much more <span>choice,<br/>
🎧 for <span>instance, food <span>products <span>sold in <span>Australia might be <span>manufactured in the <span>USA, <span>China, <span>Finland and <span>dozens of other <span>countries.<br/>
🎧 At the same time, <span>mergers and <span>takeovers mean that <span>governments are actually <span>losing <span>power to <span>major <span>global <span>corporations.<br/>
🎧 We can probably all think of <span>companies that <span>exert a great <span>deal of <span>influence,<br/>
🎧 which may be good for <span>consumers.<br/>
🎧 A <span>third <span>point I want to make about <span>markets<br/>
🎧 is that in the <span>rapidly <span>expanding <span>economies,<br/>
🎧 such as <span>India, <span>China, <span>Brazil and <span>Russia,<br/>
🎧 <span>demand is <span>growing very <span>fast.<br/>
🎧 This is <span>putting <span>pressure on <span>resources all over the <span>world.<br/>
🎧 I think <span>businesses are <span>becoming more open to <span>external <span>influences.<br/>
🎧 In <span>particular, <span>companies are <span>consulting <span>customers more and more before <span>making their <span>business <span>decisions.<br/>
🎧 <span>Companies are <span>finding out what they want and <span>providing it,<br/>
🎧 <span>instead of <span>making <span>products and then trying to sell them,<br/>
🎧 which is the <span>model of years ago.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>influence is that <span>concerns about the <span>environment will <span>force <span>manufacturers to <span>extend product <span>lifecycles,<br/>
🎧 to <span>reduce the amount of <span>pollution and <span>waste.<br/>
🎧 And in some <span>cases, <span>regulation will need to be <span>strengthened.<br/>
🎧 Many <span>societies are much more <span>fluid and <span>democratic,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>structure of <span>companies is <span>changing to <span>reflect that.<br/>
🎧 I think we're going to see a <span>greater <span>emphasis <span>within <span>companies on <span>teams <span>created with a <span>specific <span>project in <span>mind.<br/>
🎧 And when they're <span>completed,<br/>
🎧 the <span>teams will be <span>disbanded and new <span>ones <span>formed.<br/>
🎧 More and more people see work as <span>simply one <span>part of their <span>lifestyle,<br/>
🎧 and not the most important one,<br/>
🎧 and as the <span>workforce is <span>shrinking in some <span>countries,<br/>
🎧 <span>businesses are having to <span>compete for <span>staff <span>instead of being able to choose <span>among a lot of <span>applicants.<br/>
🎧 <span>Typical <span>examples that will <span>attract and <span>retain <span>staff are <span>traditional <span>ones like <span>flexible hours and <span>-<br/>
🎧 something that has been made <span>possible by <span>advances in <span>technology <span>- <span>remote working,<br/>
🎧 with people <span>based at their home, <span>abroad, or almost <span>anywhere they choose.<br/>
🎧 <span>Management <span>styles will almost <span>certainly <span>continue to change.<br/>
🎧 <span>Senior <span>managers will <span>require a lot more than the <span>efficiency that <span>they've always <span>needed.<br/>
🎧 <span>Above all they'll need great <span>skills in <span>leadership,<br/>
🎧 so that their <span>organisation can <span>initiate and <span>respond to change in a <span>fast-moving <span>world,<br/>
🎧 where they <span>face lots of <span>competing <span>requirements and <span>potential <span>conflicts.<br/>
🎧 In most of the <span>world, the <span>senior <span>managers of large <span>businesses are <span>mainly men in their <span>fifties and <span>sixties.<br/>
🎧 The <span>predominant <span>style of <span>management will almost <span>certainly become more <span>consultative and <span>collaborative,<br/>
🎧 <span>caused <span>above all, by more <span>women <span>moving into <span>senior <span>management <span>positions.<br/>
🎧 Many of the changes are <span>influenced by <span>developments in the <span>wider <span>economy.<br/>
🎧 The <span>traditional <span>emphasis of <span>business was <span>manufacturing,<br/>
🎧 and of course the <span>service <span>sector is very important.<br/>
🎧 But we shouldn't <span>overlook the <span>growing <span>financial <span>contribution of <span>IP, that is, <span>intellectual <span>property.<br/>
🎧 Some books and <span>films <span>generate <span>enormous <span>sums from the <span>sale of <span>related <span>DVDs, music, <span>games, <span>clothes, and so on.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>point I'd like to make is that although I've been talking about <span>companies,<br/>
