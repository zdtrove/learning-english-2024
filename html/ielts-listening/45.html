🎧 Good morning. What can I do for you?<br/>
🎧 I want to <span>report a <span>theft.<br/>
🎧 I had some things <span>stolen out of my bag <span>yesterday.<br/>
🎧 I'm sorry to hear that.<br/>
🎧 Right, so I'll need to take a few <span>details.<br/>
🎧 Can I start with your name?<br/>
🎧 <span>Louise <span>Taylor.<br/>
🎧 OK, thank you.<br/>
🎧 And are you <span>resident in the <span>UK?<br/>
🎧 No, I'm actually <span>Canadian. Though my <span>mother was <span>British.<br/>
🎧 And your date of <span>birth?<br/>
🎧 <span>December <span>14th, <span>1977.<br/>
🎧 So you're just <span>visiting this <span>country?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 I come over most <span>summers on <span>business.<br/>
🎧 I'm an <span>interior <span>designer and I come over to buy old <span>furniture, <span>antiques you know.<br/>
🎧 There are some really <span>lovely things around here,<br/>
🎧 but you need to get out to the small <span>towns.<br/>
🎧 I've had a really good <span>trip this year, until this <span>happened.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So you've been here quite a while?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I'm here for two <span>months.<br/>
🎧 I go back next week.<br/>
🎧 So may I ask where you're <span>staying now?<br/>
🎧 Well at <span>present I've got a place at <span>Park <span>Apartments, that's on <span>King <span>Street.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>staying at the <span>Riverside <span>Apartments on the same <span>street,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>apartment there was only <span>available for six <span>weeks<br/>
🎧 so I had to find another one.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>apartment number?<br/>
🎧 <span>Fifteen.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Now, I need to take some <span>details of the <span>theft.<br/>
🎧 So you said you had some things <span>stolen out of your bag?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 And were you actually <span>carrying the bag when the <span>theft took place?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I really can't <span>understand it.<br/>
🎧 I had my <span>backpack on.<br/>
🎧 And I went into a <span>supermarket to buy a few <span>things<br/>
🎧 and when I <span>opened it up my <span>wallet wasn't there.<br/>
🎧 And what did your <span>wallet have in it?<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>fortunately I don't keep my <span>credit <span>cards in that <span>wallet,<br/>
🎧 I keep them with my <span>passport in an inside <span>compartment in my <span>backpack.<br/>
🎧 But there was quite a bit of <span>cash <span>there…<br/>
🎧 about <span>£250 <span>sterling, I should think.<br/>
🎧 I <span>withdrew <span>£300 from my <span>account <span>yesterday,<br/>
🎧 but I did a bit of <span>shopping,<br/>
🎧 so I must have already <span>spent about <span>£50 of that.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 At first I thought, oh I must have <span>left the <span>wallet back in the <span>apartment,<br/>
🎧 but then I <span>realised my phone had <span>gone as well.<br/>
🎧 It was only a week old,<br/>
🎧 and that's when I <span>realised I'd been <span>robbed.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway at <span>least they didn't take the <span>keys to my <span>rental car.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 So you say the <span>theft <span>occurred <span>yesterday?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 So that was <span>September the <span>tenth.<br/>
🎧 And do you have any idea at all of where or when the things might <span>possibly have been <span>stolen?<br/>
🎧 Well at first I couldn't <span>believe it because the bag had been on my back ever since I <span>left the <span>apartment after lunch.<br/>
🎧 It's just a small <span>backpack,<br/>
🎧 but I <span>generally use it when I'm <span>travelling because it <span>seems <span>safer than a <span>handbag.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway, I <span>met up with a friend,<br/>
🎧 and we <span>spent a <span>couple of hours in the <span>museum.<br/>
🎧 But I do remember that as we were <span>leaving there, at about <span>4 <span>o'clock,<br/>
🎧 a group of young <span>boys ran up to us,<br/>
🎧 and they were really <span>crowding <span>round us,<br/>
🎧 and they were <span>asking us what time it was,<br/>
🎧 then all of a <span>sudden they ran off.<br/>
🎧 Can you remember anything about them?<br/>
🎧 The one who did most of the talking was <span>wearing a <span>T-shirt with a <span>picture of <span>something…<br/>
🎧 let's <span>see… a <span>tiger.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Any idea of how old he might have been?<br/>
🎧 Around <span>twelve years old?<br/>
🎧 And can you remember anything else about his <span>appearance?<br/>
🎧 Not much.<br/>
🎧 He was quite <span>thin…<br/>
🎧 <span>Colour of <span>hair?<br/>
🎧 I do remember that <span>- he was <span>blond.<br/>
🎧 All the <span>others were <span>dark-haired.<br/>
🎧 And any <span>details of the <span>others?<br/>
🎧 Not really.<br/>
🎧 They came and went so quickly.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So what I'm going to do now is give you a <span>crime <span>reference number so you can <span>contact your <span>insurance company.<br/>
🎧 So this is ten <span>digits:<br/>
🎧 <span>8795482361.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 So should I <span>contact…<br/>
<br />

🎧 Good morning everyone.<br/>
🎧 My <span>name's <span>Janet <span>Parker and I'm the <span>human <span>resources <span>manager.<br/>
🎧 We're very happy to <span>welcome you to your new <span>apprenticeship.<br/>
🎧 I hope that the next six <span>months will be a <span>positive and <span>enjoyable <span>experience for you.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to start with some <span>general advice about being an <span>apprentice.<br/>
🎧 Most of you have very little or no <span>experience of working for a big <span>organisation<br/>
🎧 and the first week or so may be quite <span>challenging.<br/>
🎧 There will be a lot of new <span>information to take <span>in<br/>
🎧 but don't <span>worry too much about trying to remember everything.<br/>
🎧 The important thing is to check with <span>someone if you're not sure what to do <span>-<br/>
🎧 you'll find your <span>supervisor is very <span>approachable and won't <span>mind <span>explaining things or <span>helping you out.<br/>
🎧 You're here to learn so make the most of that <span>opportunity.<br/>
🎧 You'll be spending time in different <span>departments during your first <span>week<br/>
🎧 so make an <span>effort to talk to as many people as <span>possible about their work <span>-<br/>
🎧 you'll make some new friends and find out lots of <span>useful <span>information.<br/>
🎧 As well as having a <span>supervisor, you'll each be <span>assigned a <span>mentor.<br/>
🎧 This person will be <span>someone who's <span>recently <span>completed an <span>apprenticeship<br/>
🎧 and you'll meet with them on a <span>weekly <span>basis.<br/>
🎧 Their <span>role is to <span>provide help and <span>support <span>throughout your <span>apprenticeship.<br/>
🎧 Of course, this doesn't mean they'll actually do any of your work for you <span>-<br/>
🎧 <span>instead they'll be <span>asking you about what <span>goals you've <span>achieved so <span>far,<br/>
🎧 as well as <span>helping you to <span>identify any <span>areas for <span>improvement.<br/>
🎧 You can also <span>discuss your more <span>long-term <span>ambitions with them as well.<br/>
🎧 Now I just want to run through a few company <span>policies for our <span>apprenticeship <span>scheme with <span>you…<br/>
🎧 Most <span>importantly, the <span>internet.<br/>
🎧 As <span>part of your <span>job you'll be doing some <span>research <span>online<br/>
🎧 so <span>obviously you'll have <span>unlimited <span>access for <span>that<br/>
🎧 but please don't use it for personal use,<br/>
🎧 you'll have your own <span>phones for that.<br/>
🎧 Some of you have already <span>asked me about <span>flexible working.<br/>
🎧 After your <span>probationary <span>three-month <span>period,<br/>
🎧 some of you will be <span>eligible for this,<br/>
🎧 but it will <span>depend on which <span>department you're in and what your personal <span>circumstances are.<br/>
🎧 So please don't <span>assume you'll <span>automatically be <span>permitted to do this.<br/>
🎧 I want to make sure there's no <span>confusion about our <span>holiday <span>policy.<br/>
🎧 <span>Apart from any <span>statutory <span>public <span>holidays<br/>
🎧 we ask that you don't book any <span>holidays until after your <span>six-month <span>apprenticeship has <span>finished.<br/>
🎧 Time off should only be taken if you are <span>unwell.<br/>
🎧 Please speak to your <span>supervisor if this is going to be a <span>problem.<br/>
🎧 You'll be <span>expected to work a <span>40-hour <span>week<br/>
🎧 but there may be <span>opportunities to do <span>overtime during <span>busy <span>periods.<br/>
🎧 Although you're not <span>required to do this,<br/>
🎧 it can be a <span>valuable <span>experience <span>-<br/>
🎧 so we <span>advise you to take it up if <span>possible.<br/>
🎧 <span>Obviously, we <span>understand that people do have <span>commitments outside work,<br/>
🎧 so don't <span>worry if there are <span>times when you are <span>unavailable.<br/>
🎧 As you know, we don't have a <span>formal <span>dress <span>code here <span>-<br/>
🎧 you may <span>wear <span>casual <span>clothes as long as they're <span>practical <span>-<br/>
🎧 and the only <span>restriction for <span>shoes we have is on high <span>heels for <span>health and <span>safety <span>reasons.<br/>
🎧 <span>Comfortable <span>shoes like <span>trainers are <span>preferable.<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>heavily <span>subsidised <span>canteen on <span>site where you can get hot <span>meals or <span>salads <span>cheaply.<br/>
🎧 <span>Snacks and <span>drinks are also <span>provided <span>-<br/>
🎧 so we've <span>decided to <span>introduce a no <span>packed lunch <span>policy.<br/>
🎧 This is <span>partly to <span>encourage <span>healthy <span>eating at <span>work<br/>
🎧 and <span>partly to <span>stop people from <span>eating at their <span>workstation, which is <span>unhygienic.<br/>
🎧 OK <span>moving on <span>to…<br/>
<br />

🎧 OK, so what I'd like you to do now is to talk to your <span>partner about your <span>presentations on <span>urban planning.<br/>
🎧 You should have done most of the <span>reading now, so I'd like you to share your <span>ideas,<br/>
🎧 and talk about the <span>structure of your <span>presentation and what you need to do next.<br/>
🎧 OK Rob.<br/>
🎧 I'm glad we <span>chose quite a <span>specific <span>topic <span>- <span>cities <span>built next to the sea.<br/>
🎧 It made it much <span>easier to find <span>relevant <span>information.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. And <span>cities are <span>growing so quickly <span>-<br/>
🎧 I mean, we know that more than <span>half the <span>world's <span>population lives in <span>cities now.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, though that's all <span>cities, not just <span>ones on the <span>coast.<br/>
🎧 But most of the <span>biggest <span>cities are actually <span>built by the sea.<br/>
🎧 I'd not <span>realised that before.<br/>
🎧 <span>Nor me.<br/>
🎧 And what's more, a lot of them are <span>built at <span>places where <span>rivers come out into the sea.<br/>
🎧 But <span>apparently this can be a <span>problem.<br/>
🎧 Why?<br/>
🎧 Well, as the <span>city <span>expands,<br/>
🎧 <span>agriculture and <span>industry <span>tend to <span>spread <span>further <span>inland along the <span>rivers,<br/>
🎧 and so <span>agriculture <span>moves even <span>further <span>inland up the <span>river.<br/>
🎧 That's not <span>necessarily a <span>problem,<br/>
🎧 <span>except it <span>means more and more <span>pollutants are <span>discharged into the <span>rivers.<br/>
🎧 So these are <span>brought <span>downstream to the <span>cities?<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Did you read that <span>article about <span>Miami, on the <span>east <span>coast of the <span>USA?<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>apparently back in the <span>1950s,<br/>
🎧 they <span>built <span>channels to <span>drain away the water in case of <span>flooding.<br/>
🎧 Sounds <span>sensible.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, they <span>spent quite a lot of money on them.<br/>
🎧 But what they didn't take into <span>account was <span>global <span>warming.<br/>
🎧 So they <span>built the <span>drainage <span>channels too <span>close to sea <span>level,<br/>
🎧 and now sea <span>levels are <span>rising, they're more or less <span>useless.<br/>
🎧 If there's a lot of <span>rain, the water can't run away, there's <span>nowhere for it to go.<br/>
🎧 The whole <span>design was <span>faulty.<br/>
🎧 So what are the <span>authorities doing about it now?<br/>
🎧 I don't know.<br/>
🎧 I did read that they're <span>aiming to <span>stop <span>disposing of <span>waste water into the <span>ocean over the next ten years.<br/>
🎧 But that won't help with <span>flood <span>prevention now, will it?<br/>
🎧 No. Really they just need to find the money for something to <span>replace the <span>drainage <span>channels,<br/>
🎧 in order to <span>protect <span>against <span>flooding now.<br/>
🎧 But in the long <span>term they need to <span>consider the whole <span>ecosystem.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Really, though, <span>coastal <span>cities can't <span>deal with their <span>problems on their own, can they?<br/>
🎧 I mean, <span>they've got to start <span>acting together at an <span>international <span>level <span>instead of just doing their own thing.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely.<br/>
🎧 The thing is, everyone <span>knows what the <span>problems <span>are<br/>
🎧 and <span>environmentalists have a <span>pretty good idea of what we should be doing about them,<br/>
🎧 so they should be able to work together to some <span>extent.<br/>
🎧 But it's going to be a long time before <span>countries come to a <span>decision on what <span>principles they're <span>prepared to <span>abide by.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, if they ever do.<br/>
🎧 So I think we've probably got enough for our <span>presentation.<br/>
🎧 It's only <span>fifteen <span>minutes.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So I <span>suppose we'll <span>begin with some <span>general <span>historical <span>background<br/>
🎧 about why <span>coastal <span>cities were <span>established.<br/>
🎧 But we don't want to <span>spend too long on that,<br/>
🎧 the other students will already know a bit about it.<br/>
🎧 It's all to do with <span>communications and so on.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 We should <span>mention some <span>geographical <span>factors,<br/>
🎧 things like <span>wetlands and <span>river <span>estuaries and <span>coastal <span>erosion and so on.<br/>
🎧 We could have some <span>maps of different <span>cities with these <span>features <span>marked.<br/>
🎧 On a <span>handout you mean?<br/>
🎧 Or some <span>slides everyone can see?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, that'd be better.<br/>
🎧 It'd be good to go into <span>past <span>mistakes in a bit more <span>detail.<br/>
🎧 Did you read that case <span>study of the <span>problems there were in New <span>Orleans with <span>flooding a few years ago?<br/>
🎧 Yes, We could use that as the <span>basis for that <span>part of the talk.<br/>
🎧 I don't think the other students will have read it,<br/>
🎧 but they'll remember <span>hearing about the <span>flooding at the time.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So that's probably enough <span>background.<br/>
🎧 So then we'll go on to talk about what <span>action's being taken to <span>deal with the <span>problems of <span>coastal <span>cities.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 What else do we need to talk about?<br/>
🎧 Maybe something on future <span>risks, looking more at the long <span>term, if <span>populations <span>continue to <span>grow.<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 We'll need to do a bit of work there,<br/>
🎧 I haven't got much <span>information, have you?<br/>
🎧 No. We'll need to look at some <span>websites.<br/>
🎧 Shouldn't take too long.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And I think we should end by talking about <span>international <span>implications.<br/>
🎧 Maybe we could ask people in the <span>audience.<br/>
🎧 We've got people from quite a lot of different <span>places.<br/>
🎧 That'd be <span>interesting, if we have time, yes.<br/>
🎧 So <span>now…<br/>
<br />

🎧 <span>Producing enough <span>energy to meet our needs has become a serious <span>problem.<br/>
🎧 <span>Demand is <span>rising <span>rapidly,<br/>
🎧 because of the <span>world's <span>increasing <span>population and <span>expanding <span>industry.<br/>
🎧 <span>Burning <span>fossil <span>fuels, like gas, <span>coal and oil,<br/>
🎧 <span>seriously <span>damages the <span>environment<br/>
🎧 and they'll <span>eventually run out.<br/>
🎧 For a number of years now,<br/>
🎧 <span>scientists have been working out how we can <span>derive <span>energy from <span>renewable <span>sources,<br/>
🎧 such as the sun and <span>wind, without <span>causing <span>pollution.<br/>
🎧 Today I'll <span>outline <span>marine <span>renewable <span>energy <span>- also called <span>ocean <span>energy <span>-<br/>
🎧 which <span>harnesses the <span>movement of the <span>oceans.<br/>
🎧 <span>Marine <span>renewable <span>energy can be <span>divided into <span>three <span>main <span>categories:<br/>
🎧 <span>wave <span>energy, <span>tidal <span>energy and <span>ocean <span>thermal <span>energy <span>conversion,<br/>
🎧 and I'll say a few <span>words about each one.<br/>
🎧 First, <span>wave <span>energy.<br/>
🎧 <span>Numerous <span>devices have been <span>invented to <span>harvest <span>wave <span>energy,<br/>
🎧 with <span>names such as <span>Wave <span>Dragon, the <span>Penguin and <span>Mighty <span>Whale,<br/>
🎧 and <span>research is going on to try and come up with a really <span>efficient <span>method.<br/>
🎧 This <span>form of <span>energy has <span>plenty of <span>potential, as the <span>source is <span>constant,<br/>
🎧 and there's no <span>danger of <span>waves <span>coming to a <span>standstill.<br/>
🎧 <span>Electricity can be <span>generated <span>using <span>onshore <span>systems,<br/>
🎧 <span>using a <span>reservoir, or <span>offshore <span>systems.<br/>
🎧 But the <span>problem with <span>ocean <span>waves is that they're <span>erratic,<br/>
🎧 with the <span>winds <span>making them travel in every <span>direction.<br/>
🎧 This <span>adds to the <span>difficulty of <span>creating <span>efficient <span>technology:<br/>
🎧 <span>ideally all the <span>waves would travel <span>smoothly and <span>regularly along the same <span>straight <span>line.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>drawback is that <span>sand and other <span>sediment on the <span>ocean <span>floor<br/>
🎧 might be <span>stopped from <span>flowing <span>normally,<br/>
🎧 which can <span>lead to <span>environmental <span>problems.<br/>
🎧 The second <span>category of <span>marine <span>energy that I'll <span>mention is <span>tidal <span>energy.<br/>
🎧 One <span>major <span>advantage of <span>using the <span>tide, rather than <span>waves, as a <span>source of <span>energy<br/>
🎧 is that it's <span>predictable:<br/>
🎧 we know the <span>exact <span>times of high and low <span>tides for years to come.<br/>
🎧 For <span>tidal <span>energy to be <span>effective,<br/>
🎧 the <span>difference between high and low <span>tides needs to be at <span>least <span>five <span>metres,<br/>
🎧 and this <span>occurs <span>naturally in only about <span>forty <span>places on <span>Earth.<br/>
🎧 But the right <span>conditions can be <span>created by <span>constructing a <span>tidal <span>lagoon,<br/>
🎧 an <span>area of sea water <span>separated from the sea.<br/>
🎧 One <span>current plan is to <span>create a <span>tidal <span>lagoon on the <span>coast of <span>Wales.<br/>
🎧 This will be an <span>area of water <span>within a <span>bay at <span>Swansea,<br/>
🎧 <span>sheltered by a <span>U-shaped <span>breakwater, or <span>dam, <span>built out from the <span>coast.<br/>
🎧 The <span>breakwater will <span>contain <span>sixteen <span>hydro <span>turbines,<br/>
🎧 and as the <span>tide <span>rises, water <span>rushes through the <span>breakwater,<br/>
🎧 <span>activating the <span>turbines, which <span>turn a <span>generator to <span>produce <span>electricity.<br/>
🎧 Then, for <span>three hours as the <span>tide <span>goes out,<br/>
🎧 the water is <span>held back <span>within the <span>breakwater,<br/>
🎧 <span>increasing the <span>difference in water <span>level,<br/>
🎧 until it's <span>several <span>metres <span>higher <span>within the <span>lagoon than in the open sea.<br/>
🎧 Then, in order to <span>release the <span>stored water,<br/>
🎧 <span>gates in the <span>breakwater are <span>opened.<br/>
🎧 It <span>pours <span>powerfully out of the <span>lagoon,<br/>
🎧 driving the <span>turbines in the <span>breakwater in the <span>opposite <span>direction<br/>
🎧 and again <span>generating <span>thousands of <span>megawatts of <span>electricity.<br/>
🎧 As there are two high <span>tides a day,<br/>
🎧 this <span>lagoon <span>scheme would <span>generate <span>electricity <span>four <span>times a day, every day,<br/>
🎧 for a <span>total of around <span>14 hours in every <span>24,<br/>
🎧 and enough <span>electricity for over <span>150,000 <span>homes.<br/>
🎧 This <span>system has quite a lot in its <span>favour:<br/>
🎧 <span>unlike <span>solar and <span>wind <span>energy it doesn't <span>depend on the <span>weather;<br/>
🎧 the <span>turbines are <span>operated without the need for <span>fuel,<br/>
🎧 so it doesn't <span>create any <span>greenhouse gas <span>emissions;<br/>
🎧 and very little <span>maintenance is <span>needed.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>estimated that <span>electricity <span>generated in this way will be <span>relatively <span>cheap,<br/>
🎧 and that <span>manufacturing the <span>components would <span>create more than <span>2,000 <span>jobs,<br/>
🎧 a big <span>boost to the <span>local <span>economy.<br/>
🎧 On the other <span>hand,<br/>
🎧 there are <span>fears that <span>lagoons might <span>harm both <span>fish and <span>birds,<br/>
🎧 for example by <span>disturbing <span>migration <span>patterns,<br/>
🎧 and <span>causing a <span>build-up of <span>silt, <span>affecting <span>local <span>ecosystems.<br/>
🎧 There are other <span>forms of <span>tidal <span>energy,<br/>
🎧 but I'll go on to the <span>third <span>category of <span>marine <span>energy:<br/>
🎧 <span>ocean <span>thermal <span>energy <span>conversion.<br/>
🎧 This <span>depends on there being a big <span>difference in <span>temperature<br/>
🎧 between <span>surface water and the water a <span>couple of <span>kilometres <span>below the <span>surface,<br/>
🎧 and this <span>occurs in <span>tropical <span>coastal <span>areas.<br/>
🎧 The idea is to <span>bring <span>cold water up to the <span>surface <span>using a <span>submerged <span>pipe.<br/>
🎧 The <span>concept <span>dates back to <span>1881...<br/>
