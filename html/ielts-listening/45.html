🎧 Good morning. What can I do for you?<br/>
🎧 I want to <span>report</span> a <span>theft</span>.<br/>
🎧 I had some things <span>stolen</span> out of my bag <span>yesterday</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm sorry to hear that.<br/>
🎧 Right, so I'll need to take a few <span>details</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can I start with your name?<br/>
🎧 <span>Louise</span> <span>Taylor</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, thank you.<br/>
🎧 And are you <span>resident</span> in the <span>UK</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, I'm actually <span>Canadian</span>. Though my <span>mother</span> was <span>British</span>.<br/>
🎧 And your date of <span>birth</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>December</span> <span>14th</span>, <span>1977</span>.<br/>
🎧 So you're just <span>visiting</span> this <span>country</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 I come over most <span>summers</span> on <span>business</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm an <span>interior</span> <span>designer</span> and I come over to buy old <span>furniture</span>, <span>antiques</span> you know.<br/>
🎧 There are some really <span>lovely</span> things around here,<br/>
🎧 but you need to get out to the small <span>towns</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've had a really good <span>trip</span> this year, until this <span>happened</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So you've been here quite a while?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I'm here for two <span>months</span>.<br/>
🎧 I go back next week.<br/>
🎧 So may I ask where you're <span>staying</span> now?<br/>
🎧 Well at <span>present</span> I've got a place at <span>Park</span> <span>Apartments</span>, that's on <span>King</span> <span>Street</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>staying</span> at the <span>Riverside</span> <span>Apartments</span> on the same <span>street</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>apartment</span> there was only <span>available</span> for six <span>weeks<br/></span>
🎧 so I had to find another one.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>apartment</span> number?<br/>
🎧 <span>Fifteen</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Now, I need to take some <span>details</span> of the <span>theft</span>.<br/>
🎧 So you said you had some things <span>stolen</span> out of your bag?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 And were you actually <span>carrying</span> the bag when the <span>theft</span> took place?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I really can't <span>understand</span> it.<br/>
🎧 I had my <span>backpack</span> on.<br/>
🎧 And I went into a <span>supermarket</span> to buy a few <span>things<br/></span>
🎧 and when I <span>opened</span> it up my <span>wallet</span> wasn't there.<br/>
🎧 And what did your <span>wallet</span> have in it?<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>fortunately</span> I don't keep my <span>credit</span> <span>cards</span> in that <span>wallet</span>,<br/>
🎧 I keep them with my <span>passport</span> in an inside <span>compartment</span> in my <span>backpack</span>.<br/>
🎧 But there was quite a bit of <span>cash</span> <span>there…<br/></span>
🎧 about <span>£250</span> <span>sterling</span>, I should think.<br/>
🎧 I <span>withdrew</span> <span>£300</span> from my <span>account</span> <span>yesterday</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I did a bit of <span>shopping</span>,<br/>
🎧 so I must have already <span>spent</span> about <span>£50</span> of that.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 At first I thought, oh I must have <span>left</span> the <span>wallet</span> back in the <span>apartment</span>,<br/>
🎧 but then I <span>realised</span> my phone had <span>gone</span> as well.<br/>
🎧 It was only a week old,<br/>
🎧 and that's when I <span>realised</span> I'd been <span>robbed</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span> at <span>least</span> they didn't take the <span>keys</span> to my <span>rental</span> car.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 So you say the <span>theft</span> <span>occurred</span> <span>yesterday</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 So that was <span>September</span> the <span>tenth</span>.<br/>
🎧 And do you have any idea at all of where or when the things might <span>possibly</span> have been <span>stolen</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well at first I couldn't <span>believe</span> it because the bag had been on my back ever since I <span>left</span> the <span>apartment</span> after lunch.<br/>
🎧 It's just a small <span>backpack</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I <span>generally</span> use it when I'm <span>travelling</span> because it <span>seems</span> <span>safer</span> than a <span>handbag</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, I <span>met</span> up with a friend,<br/>
🎧 and we <span>spent</span> a <span>couple</span> of hours in the <span>museum</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I do remember that as we were <span>leaving</span> there, at about <span>4</span> <span>o'clock</span>,<br/>
🎧 a group of young <span>boys</span> ran up to us,<br/>
🎧 and they were really <span>crowding</span> <span>round</span> us,<br/>
🎧 and they were <span>asking</span> us what time it was,<br/>
🎧 then all of a <span>sudden</span> they ran off.<br/>
🎧 Can you remember anything about them?<br/>
🎧 The one who did most of the talking was <span>wearing</span> a <span>T-shirt</span> with a <span>picture</span> of <span>something…<br/></span>
🎧 let's <span>see…</span> a <span>tiger</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Any idea of how old he might have been?<br/>
🎧 Around <span>twelve</span> years old?<br/>
🎧 And can you remember anything else about his <span>appearance</span>?<br/>
🎧 Not much.<br/>
🎧 He was quite <span>thin…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Colour</span> of <span>hair</span>?<br/>
🎧 I do remember that <span>-</span> he was <span>blond</span>.<br/>
🎧 All the <span>others</span> were <span>dark-haired</span>.<br/>
🎧 And any <span>details</span> of the <span>others</span>?<br/>
🎧 Not really.<br/>
🎧 They came and went so quickly.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So what I'm going to do now is give you a <span>crime</span> <span>reference</span> number so you can <span>contact</span> your <span>insurance</span> company.<br/>
🎧 So this is ten <span>digits</span>:<br/>
🎧 <span>8795482361</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 So should I <span>contact…<br/></span>
<br />

🎧 Good morning everyone.<br/>
🎧 My <span>name's</span> <span>Janet</span> <span>Parker</span> and I'm the <span>human</span> <span>resources</span> <span>manager</span>.<br/>
🎧 We're very happy to <span>welcome</span> you to your new <span>apprenticeship</span>.<br/>
🎧 I hope that the next six <span>months</span> will be a <span>positive</span> and <span>enjoyable</span> <span>experience</span> for you.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to start with some <span>general</span> advice about being an <span>apprentice</span>.<br/>
🎧 Most of you have very little or no <span>experience</span> of working for a big <span>organisation<br/></span>
🎧 and the first week or so may be quite <span>challenging</span>.<br/>
🎧 There will be a lot of new <span>information</span> to take <span>in<br/></span>
🎧 but don't <span>worry</span> too much about trying to remember everything.<br/>
🎧 The important thing is to check with <span>someone</span> if you're not sure what to do <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 you'll find your <span>supervisor</span> is very <span>approachable</span> and won't <span>mind</span> <span>explaining</span> things or <span>helping</span> you out.<br/>
🎧 You're here to learn so make the most of that <span>opportunity</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll be spending time in different <span>departments</span> during your first <span>week<br/></span>
🎧 so make an <span>effort</span> to talk to as many people as <span>possible</span> about their work <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 you'll make some new friends and find out lots of <span>useful</span> <span>information</span>.<br/>
🎧 As well as having a <span>supervisor</span>, you'll each be <span>assigned</span> a <span>mentor</span>.<br/>
🎧 This person will be <span>someone</span> who's <span>recently</span> <span>completed</span> an <span>apprenticeship<br/></span>
🎧 and you'll meet with them on a <span>weekly</span> <span>basis</span>.<br/>
🎧 Their <span>role</span> is to <span>provide</span> help and <span>support</span> <span>throughout</span> your <span>apprenticeship</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course, this doesn't mean they'll actually do any of your work for you <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>instead</span> they'll be <span>asking</span> you about what <span>goals</span> you've <span>achieved</span> so <span>far</span>,<br/>
🎧 as well as <span>helping</span> you to <span>identify</span> any <span>areas</span> for <span>improvement</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can also <span>discuss</span> your more <span>long-term</span> <span>ambitions</span> with them as well.<br/>
🎧 Now I just want to run through a few company <span>policies</span> for our <span>apprenticeship</span> <span>scheme</span> with <span>you…<br/></span>
🎧 Most <span>importantly</span>, the <span>internet</span>.<br/>
🎧 As <span>part</span> of your <span>job</span> you'll be doing some <span>research</span> <span>online<br/></span>
🎧 so <span>obviously</span> you'll have <span>unlimited</span> <span>access</span> for <span>that<br/></span>
🎧 but please don't use it for personal use,<br/>
🎧 you'll have your own <span>phones</span> for that.<br/>
🎧 Some of you have already <span>asked</span> me about <span>flexible</span> working.<br/>
🎧 After your <span>probationary</span> <span>three-month</span> <span>period</span>,<br/>
🎧 some of you will be <span>eligible</span> for this,<br/>
🎧 but it will <span>depend</span> on which <span>department</span> you're in and what your personal <span>circumstances</span> are.<br/>
🎧 So please don't <span>assume</span> you'll <span>automatically</span> be <span>permitted</span> to do this.<br/>
🎧 I want to make sure there's no <span>confusion</span> about our <span>holiday</span> <span>policy</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Apart</span> from any <span>statutory</span> <span>public</span> <span>holidays<br/></span>
🎧 we ask that you don't book any <span>holidays</span> until after your <span>six-month</span> <span>apprenticeship</span> has <span>finished</span>.<br/>
🎧 Time off should only be taken if you are <span>unwell</span>.<br/>
🎧 Please speak to your <span>supervisor</span> if this is going to be a <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll be <span>expected</span> to work a <span>40-hour</span> <span>week<br/></span>
🎧 but there may be <span>opportunities</span> to do <span>overtime</span> during <span>busy</span> <span>periods</span>.<br/>
🎧 Although you're not <span>required</span> to do this,<br/>
🎧 it can be a <span>valuable</span> <span>experience</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 so we <span>advise</span> you to take it up if <span>possible</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Obviously</span>, we <span>understand</span> that people do have <span>commitments</span> outside work,<br/>
🎧 so don't <span>worry</span> if there are <span>times</span> when you are <span>unavailable</span>.<br/>
🎧 As you know, we don't have a <span>formal</span> <span>dress</span> <span>code</span> here <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 you may <span>wear</span> <span>casual</span> <span>clothes</span> as long as they're <span>practical</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and the only <span>restriction</span> for <span>shoes</span> we have is on high <span>heels</span> for <span>health</span> and <span>safety</span> <span>reasons</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Comfortable</span> <span>shoes</span> like <span>trainers</span> are <span>preferable</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>heavily</span> <span>subsidised</span> <span>canteen</span> on <span>site</span> where you can get hot <span>meals</span> or <span>salads</span> <span>cheaply</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Snacks</span> and <span>drinks</span> are also <span>provided</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 so we've <span>decided</span> to <span>introduce</span> a no <span>packed</span> lunch <span>policy</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is <span>partly</span> to <span>encourage</span> <span>healthy</span> <span>eating</span> at <span>work<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>partly</span> to <span>stop</span> people from <span>eating</span> at their <span>workstation</span>, which is <span>unhygienic</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK <span>moving</span> on <span>to…<br/></span>
<br />

🎧 OK, so what I'd like you to do now is to talk to your <span>partner</span> about your <span>presentations</span> on <span>urban</span> planning.<br/>
🎧 You should have done most of the <span>reading</span> now, so I'd like you to share your <span>ideas</span>,<br/>
🎧 and talk about the <span>structure</span> of your <span>presentation</span> and what you need to do next.<br/>
🎧 OK Rob.<br/>
🎧 I'm glad we <span>chose</span> quite a <span>specific</span> <span>topic</span> <span>-</span> <span>cities</span> <span>built</span> next to the sea.<br/>
🎧 It made it much <span>easier</span> to find <span>relevant</span> <span>information</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. And <span>cities</span> are <span>growing</span> so quickly <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 I mean, we know that more than <span>half</span> the <span>world's</span> <span>population</span> lives in <span>cities</span> now.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, though that's all <span>cities</span>, not just <span>ones</span> on the <span>coast</span>.<br/>
🎧 But most of the <span>biggest</span> <span>cities</span> are actually <span>built</span> by the sea.<br/>
🎧 I'd not <span>realised</span> that before.<br/>
🎧 <span>Nor</span> me.<br/>
🎧 And what's more, a lot of them are <span>built</span> at <span>places</span> where <span>rivers</span> come out into the sea.<br/>
🎧 But <span>apparently</span> this can be a <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why?<br/>
🎧 Well, as the <span>city</span> <span>expands</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>agriculture</span> and <span>industry</span> <span>tend</span> to <span>spread</span> <span>further</span> <span>inland</span> along the <span>rivers</span>,<br/>
🎧 and so <span>agriculture</span> <span>moves</span> even <span>further</span> <span>inland</span> up the <span>river</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's not <span>necessarily</span> a <span>problem</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>except</span> it <span>means</span> more and more <span>pollutants</span> are <span>discharged</span> into the <span>rivers</span>.<br/>
🎧 So these are <span>brought</span> <span>downstream</span> to the <span>cities</span>?<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Did you read that <span>article</span> about <span>Miami</span>, on the <span>east</span> <span>coast</span> of the <span>USA</span>?<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>apparently</span> back in the <span>1950s</span>,<br/>
🎧 they <span>built</span> <span>channels</span> to <span>drain</span> away the water in case of <span>flooding</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sounds <span>sensible</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, they <span>spent</span> quite a lot of money on them.<br/>
🎧 But what they didn't take into <span>account</span> was <span>global</span> <span>warming</span>.<br/>
🎧 So they <span>built</span> the <span>drainage</span> <span>channels</span> too <span>close</span> to sea <span>level</span>,<br/>
🎧 and now sea <span>levels</span> are <span>rising</span>, they're more or less <span>useless</span>.<br/>
🎧 If there's a lot of <span>rain</span>, the water can't run away, there's <span>nowhere</span> for it to go.<br/>
🎧 The whole <span>design</span> was <span>faulty</span>.<br/>
🎧 So what are the <span>authorities</span> doing about it now?<br/>
🎧 I don't know.<br/>
🎧 I did read that they're <span>aiming</span> to <span>stop</span> <span>disposing</span> of <span>waste</span> water into the <span>ocean</span> over the next ten years.<br/>
🎧 But that won't help with <span>flood</span> <span>prevention</span> now, will it?<br/>
🎧 No. Really they just need to find the money for something to <span>replace</span> the <span>drainage</span> <span>channels</span>,<br/>
🎧 in order to <span>protect</span> <span>against</span> <span>flooding</span> now.<br/>
🎧 But in the long <span>term</span> they need to <span>consider</span> the whole <span>ecosystem</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Really, though, <span>coastal</span> <span>cities</span> can't <span>deal</span> with their <span>problems</span> on their own, can they?<br/>
🎧 I mean, <span>they've</span> got to start <span>acting</span> together at an <span>international</span> <span>level</span> <span>instead</span> of just doing their own thing.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely.<br/>
🎧 The thing is, everyone <span>knows</span> what the <span>problems</span> <span>are<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>environmentalists</span> have a <span>pretty</span> good idea of what we should be doing about them,<br/>
🎧 so they should be able to work together to some <span>extent</span>.<br/>
🎧 But it's going to be a long time before <span>countries</span> come to a <span>decision</span> on what <span>principles</span> they're <span>prepared</span> to <span>abide</span> by.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, if they ever do.<br/>
🎧 So I think we've probably got enough for our <span>presentation</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's only <span>fifteen</span> <span>minutes</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So I <span>suppose</span> we'll <span>begin</span> with some <span>general</span> <span>historical</span> <span>background<br/></span>
🎧 about why <span>coastal</span> <span>cities</span> were <span>established</span>.<br/>
🎧 But we don't want to <span>spend</span> too long on that,<br/>
🎧 the other students will already know a bit about it.<br/>
🎧 It's all to do with <span>communications</span> and so on.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 We should <span>mention</span> some <span>geographical</span> <span>factors</span>,<br/>
🎧 things like <span>wetlands</span> and <span>river</span> <span>estuaries</span> and <span>coastal</span> <span>erosion</span> and so on.<br/>
🎧 We could have some <span>maps</span> of different <span>cities</span> with these <span>features</span> <span>marked</span>.<br/>
🎧 On a <span>handout</span> you mean?<br/>
🎧 Or some <span>slides</span> everyone can see?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, that'd be better.<br/>
🎧 It'd be good to go into <span>past</span> <span>mistakes</span> in a bit more <span>detail</span>.<br/>
🎧 Did you read that case <span>study</span> of the <span>problems</span> there were in New <span>Orleans</span> with <span>flooding</span> a few years ago?<br/>
🎧 Yes, We could use that as the <span>basis</span> for that <span>part</span> of the talk.<br/>
🎧 I don't think the other students will have read it,<br/>
🎧 but they'll remember <span>hearing</span> about the <span>flooding</span> at the time.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So that's probably enough <span>background</span>.<br/>
🎧 So then we'll go on to talk about what <span>action's</span> being taken to <span>deal</span> with the <span>problems</span> of <span>coastal</span> <span>cities</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 What else do we need to talk about?<br/>
🎧 Maybe something on future <span>risks</span>, looking more at the long <span>term</span>, if <span>populations</span> <span>continue</span> to <span>grow</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 We'll need to do a bit of work there,<br/>
🎧 I haven't got much <span>information</span>, have you?<br/>
🎧 No. We'll need to look at some <span>websites</span>.<br/>
🎧 Shouldn't take too long.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And I think we should end by talking about <span>international</span> <span>implications</span>.<br/>
🎧 Maybe we could ask people in the <span>audience</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've got people from quite a lot of different <span>places</span>.<br/>
🎧 That'd be <span>interesting</span>, if we have time, yes.<br/>
🎧 So <span>now…<br/></span>

🎧 <span>seriously</span> <span>damages</span> the <span>environment<br/></span>
🎧 and they'll <span>eventually</span> run out.<br/>
🎧 For a number of years now,<br/>
🎧 <span>scientists</span> have been working out how we can <span>derive</span> <span>energy</span> from <span>renewable</span> <span>sources</span>,<br/>
🎧 such as the sun and <span>wind</span>, without <span>causing</span> <span>pollution</span>.<br/>
🎧 Today I'll <span>outline</span> <span>marine</span> <span>renewable</span> <span>energy</span> <span>-</span> also called <span>ocean</span> <span>energy</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 which <span>harnesses</span> the <span>movement</span> of the <span>oceans</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Marine</span> <span>renewable</span> <span>energy</span> can be <span>divided</span> into <span>three</span> <span>main</span> <span>categories</span>:<br/>
🎧 <span>wave</span> <span>energy</span>, <span>tidal</span> <span>energy</span> and <span>ocean</span> <span>thermal</span> <span>energy</span> <span>conversion</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I'll say a few <span>words</span> about each one.<br/>
🎧 First, <span>wave</span> <span>energy</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Numerous</span> <span>devices</span> have been <span>invented</span> to <span>harvest</span> <span>wave</span> <span>energy</span>,<br/>
🎧 with <span>names</span> such as <span>Wave</span> <span>Dragon</span>, the <span>Penguin</span> and <span>Mighty</span> <span>Whale</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>research</span> is going on to try and come up with a really <span>efficient</span> <span>method</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>form</span> of <span>energy</span> has <span>plenty</span> of <span>potential</span>, as the <span>source</span> is <span>constant</span>,<br/>
🎧 and there's no <span>danger</span> of <span>waves</span> <span>coming</span> to a <span>standstill</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Electricity</span> can be <span>generated</span> <span>using</span> <span>onshore</span> <span>systems</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>using</span> a <span>reservoir</span>, or <span>offshore</span> <span>systems</span>.<br/>
🎧 But the <span>problem</span> with <span>ocean</span> <span>waves</span> is that they're <span>erratic</span>,<br/>
🎧 with the <span>winds</span> <span>making</span> them travel in every <span>direction</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>adds</span> to the <span>difficulty</span> of <span>creating</span> <span>efficient</span> <span>technology</span>:<br/>
🎧 <span>ideally</span> all the <span>waves</span> would travel <span>smoothly</span> and <span>regularly</span> along the same <span>straight</span> <span>line</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>drawback</span> is that <span>sand</span> and other <span>sediment</span> on the <span>ocean</span> <span>floor<br/></span>
🎧 might be <span>stopped</span> from <span>flowing</span> <span>normally</span>,<br/>
🎧 which can <span>lead</span> to <span>environmental</span> <span>problems</span>.<br/>
🎧 The second <span>category</span> of <span>marine</span> <span>energy</span> that I'll <span>mention</span> is <span>tidal</span> <span>energy</span>.<br/>
🎧 One <span>major</span> <span>advantage</span> of <span>using</span> the <span>tide</span>, rather than <span>waves</span>, as a <span>source</span> of <span>energy<br/></span>
🎧 is that it's <span>predictable</span>:<br/>
🎧 we know the <span>exact</span> <span>times</span> of high and low <span>tides</span> for years to come.<br/>
🎧 For <span>tidal</span> <span>energy</span> to be <span>effective</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>difference</span> between high and low <span>tides</span> needs to be at <span>least</span> <span>five</span> <span>metres</span>,<br/>
🎧 and this <span>occurs</span> <span>naturally</span> in only about <span>forty</span> <span>places</span> on <span>Earth</span>.<br/>
🎧 But the right <span>conditions</span> can be <span>created</span> by <span>constructing</span> a <span>tidal</span> <span>lagoon</span>,<br/>
🎧 an <span>area</span> of sea water <span>separated</span> from the sea.<br/>
🎧 One <span>current</span> plan is to <span>create</span> a <span>tidal</span> <span>lagoon</span> on the <span>coast</span> of <span>Wales</span>.<br/>
🎧 This will be an <span>area</span> of water <span>within</span> a <span>bay</span> at <span>Swansea</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>sheltered</span> by a <span>U-shaped</span> <span>breakwater</span>, or <span>dam</span>, <span>built</span> out from the <span>coast</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>breakwater</span> will <span>contain</span> <span>sixteen</span> <span>hydro</span> <span>turbines</span>,<br/>
🎧 and as the <span>tide</span> <span>rises</span>, water <span>rushes</span> through the <span>breakwater</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>activating</span> the <span>turbines</span>, which <span>turn</span> a <span>generator</span> to <span>produce</span> <span>electricity</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then, for <span>three</span> hours as the <span>tide</span> <span>goes</span> out,<br/>
🎧 the water is <span>held</span> back <span>within</span> the <span>breakwater</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>increasing</span> the <span>difference</span> in water <span>level</span>,<br/>
🎧 until it's <span>several</span> <span>metres</span> <span>higher</span> <span>within</span> the <span>lagoon</span> than in the open sea.<br/>
🎧 Then, in order to <span>release</span> the <span>stored</span> water,<br/>
🎧 <span>gates</span> in the <span>breakwater</span> are <span>opened</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>pours</span> <span>powerfully</span> out of the <span>lagoon</span>,<br/>
🎧 driving the <span>turbines</span> in the <span>breakwater</span> in the <span>opposite</span> <span>direction<br/></span>
🎧 and again <span>generating</span> <span>thousands</span> of <span>megawatts</span> of <span>electricity</span>.<br/>
🎧 As there are two high <span>tides</span> a day,<br/>
🎧 this <span>lagoon</span> <span>scheme</span> would <span>generate</span> <span>electricity</span> <span>four</span> <span>times</span> a day, every day,<br/>
🎧 for a <span>total</span> of around <span>14</span> hours in every <span>24</span>,<br/>
🎧 and enough <span>electricity</span> for over <span>150,000</span> <span>homes</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>system</span> has quite a lot in its <span>favour</span>:<br/>
🎧 <span>unlike</span> <span>solar</span> and <span>wind</span> <span>energy</span> it doesn't <span>depend</span> on the <span>weather;<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>turbines</span> are <span>operated</span> without the need for <span>fuel</span>,<br/>
🎧 so it doesn't <span>create</span> any <span>greenhouse</span> gas <span>emissions;<br/></span>
🎧 and very little <span>maintenance</span> is <span>needed</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>estimated</span> that <span>electricity</span> <span>generated</span> in this way will be <span>relatively</span> <span>cheap</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that <span>manufacturing</span> the <span>components</span> would <span>create</span> more than <span>2,000</span> <span>jobs</span>,<br/>
🎧 a big <span>boost</span> to the <span>local</span> <span>economy</span>.<br/>
🎧 On the other <span>hand</span>,<br/>
🎧 there are <span>fears</span> that <span>lagoons</span> might <span>harm</span> both <span>fish</span> and <span>birds</span>,<br/>
🎧 for example by <span>disturbing</span> <span>migration</span> <span>patterns</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>causing</span> a <span>build-up</span> of <span>silt</span>, <span>affecting</span> <span>local</span> <span>ecosystems</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are other <span>forms</span> of <span>tidal</span> <span>energy</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I'll go on to the <span>third</span> <span>category</span> of <span>marine</span> <span>energy</span>:<br/>
🎧 <span>ocean</span> <span>thermal</span> <span>energy</span> <span>conversion</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>depends</span> on there being a big <span>difference</span> in <span>temperature<br/></span>
🎧 between <span>surface</span> water and the water a <span>couple</span> of <span>kilometres</span> <span>below</span> the <span>surface</span>,<br/>
🎧 and this <span>occurs</span> in <span>tropical</span> <span>coastal</span> <span>areas</span>.<br/>
🎧 The idea is to <span>bring</span> <span>cold</span> water up to the <span>surface</span> <span>using</span> a <span>submerged</span> <span>pipe</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>concept</span> <span>dates</span> back to <span>1881..</span>.<br/>
