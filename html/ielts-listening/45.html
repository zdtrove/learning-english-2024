🎧 Good morning. What can I do for you?<br/>
🎧 I want to report a theft.<br/>
🎧 I had some things stolen out of my bag yesterday.<br/>
🎧 I'm sorry to hear that.<br/>
🎧 Right, so I'll need to take a few details.<br/>
🎧 Can I start with your name?<br/>
🎧 Louise Taylor.<br/>
🎧 OK, thank you.<br/>
🎧 And are you resident in the UK?<br/>
🎧 No, I'm actually Canadian. Though my mother was British.<br/>
🎧 And your date of birth?<br/>
🎧 December 14th, 1977.<br/>
🎧 So you're just visiting this country?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 I come over most summers on business.<br/>
🎧 I'm an interior designer and I come over to buy old furniture, antiques you know.<br/>
🎧 There are some really lovely things around here,<br/>
🎧 but you need to get out to the small towns.<br/>
🎧 I've had a really good trip this year, until this happened.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So you've been here quite a while?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I'm here for two months.<br/>
🎧 I go back next week.<br/>
🎧 So may I ask where you're staying now?<br/>
🎧 Well at present I've got a place at Park Apartments, that's on King Street.<br/>
🎧 I was staying at the Riverside Apartments on the same street,<br/>
🎧 but the apartment there was only available for six weeks<br/>
🎧 so I had to find another one.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And the apartment number?<br/>
🎧 Fifteen.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Now, I need to take some details of the theft.<br/>
🎧 So you said you had some things stolen out of your bag?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 And were you actually carrying the bag when the theft took place?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I really can't understand it.<br/>
🎧 I had my backpack on.<br/>
🎧 And I went into a supermarket to buy a few things<br/>
🎧 and when I opened it up my wallet wasn't there.<br/>
🎧 And what did your wallet have in it?<br/>
🎧 Well, fortunately I don't keep my credit cards in that wallet,<br/>
🎧 I keep them with my passport in an inside compartment in my backpack.<br/>
🎧 But there was quite a bit of cash there…<br/>
🎧 about £250 sterling, I should think.<br/>
🎧 I withdrew £300 from my account yesterday,<br/>
🎧 but I did a bit of shopping,<br/>
🎧 so I must have already spent about £50 of that.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 At first I thought, oh I must have left the wallet back in the apartment,<br/>
🎧 but then I realised my phone had gone as well.<br/>
🎧 It was only a week old,<br/>
🎧 and that's when I realised I'd been robbed.<br/>
🎧 Anyway at least they didn't take the keys to my rental car.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 So you say the theft occurred yesterday?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 So that was September the tenth.<br/>
🎧 And do you have any idea at all of where or when the things might possibly have been stolen?<br/>
🎧 Well at first I couldn't believe it because the bag had been on my back ever since I left the apartment after lunch.<br/>
🎧 It's just a small backpack,<br/>
🎧 but I generally use it when I'm travelling because it seems safer than a handbag.<br/>
🎧 Anyway, I met up with a friend,<br/>
🎧 and we spent a couple of hours in the museum.<br/>
🎧 But I do remember that as we were leaving there, at about 4 o'clock,<br/>
🎧 a group of young boys ran up to us,<br/>
🎧 and they were really crowding round us,<br/>
🎧 and they were asking us what time it was,<br/>
🎧 then all of a sudden they ran off.<br/>
🎧 Can you remember anything about them?<br/>
🎧 The one who did most of the talking was wearing a T-shirt with a picture of something…<br/>
🎧 let's see… a tiger.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Any idea of how old he might have been?<br/>
🎧 Around twelve years old?<br/>
🎧 And can you remember anything else about his appearance?<br/>
🎧 Not much.<br/>
🎧 He was quite thin…<br/>
🎧 Colour of hair?<br/>
🎧 I do remember that - he was blond.<br/>
🎧 All the others were dark-haired.<br/>
🎧 And any details of the others?<br/>
🎧 Not really.<br/>
🎧 They came and went so quickly.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So what I'm going to do now is give you a crime reference number so you can contact your insurance company.<br/>
🎧 So this is ten digits:<br/>
🎧 8795482361.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 So should I contact…<br/>
<br />

🎧 Good morning everyone.<br/>
🎧 My name's Janet Parker and I'm the human resources manager.<br/>
🎧 We're very happy to welcome you to your new apprenticeship.<br/>
🎧 I hope that the next six months will be a positive and enjoyable experience for you.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to start with some general advice about being an apprentice.<br/>
🎧 Most of you have very little or no experience of working for a big organisation<br/>
🎧 and the first week or so may be quite challenging.<br/>
🎧 There will be a lot of new information to take in<br/>
🎧 but don't worry too much about trying to remember everything.<br/>
🎧 The important thing is to check with someone if you're not sure what to do -<br/>
🎧 you'll find your supervisor is very approachable and won't mind explaining things or helping you out.<br/>
🎧 You're here to learn so make the most of that opportunity.<br/>
🎧 You'll be spending time in different departments during your first week<br/>
🎧 so make an effort to talk to as many people as possible about their work -<br/>
🎧 you'll make some new friends and find out lots of useful information.<br/>
🎧 As well as having a supervisor, you'll each be assigned a mentor.<br/>
🎧 This person will be someone who's recently completed an apprenticeship<br/>
🎧 and you'll meet with them on a weekly basis.<br/>
🎧 Their role is to provide help and support throughout your apprenticeship.<br/>
🎧 Of course, this doesn't mean they'll actually do any of your work for you -<br/>
🎧 instead they'll be asking you about what goals you've achieved so far,<br/>
🎧 as well as helping you to identify any areas for improvement.<br/>
🎧 You can also discuss your more long-term ambitions with them as well.<br/>
🎧 Now I just want to run through a few company policies for our apprenticeship scheme with you…<br/>
🎧 Most importantly, the internet.<br/>
🎧 As part of your job you'll be doing some research online<br/>
🎧 so obviously you'll have unlimited access for that<br/>
🎧 but please don't use it for personal use,<br/>
🎧 you'll have your own phones for that.<br/>
🎧 Some of you have already asked me about flexible working.<br/>
🎧 After your probationary three-month period,<br/>
🎧 some of you will be eligible for this,<br/>
🎧 but it will depend on which department you're in and what your personal circumstances are.<br/>
🎧 So please don't assume you'll automatically be permitted to do this.<br/>
🎧 I want to make sure there's no confusion about our holiday policy.<br/>
🎧 Apart from any statutory public holidays<br/>
🎧 we ask that you don't book any holidays until after your six-month apprenticeship has finished.<br/>
🎧 Time off should only be taken if you are unwell.<br/>
🎧 Please speak to your supervisor if this is going to be a problem.<br/>
🎧 You'll be expected to work a 40-hour week<br/>
🎧 but there may be opportunities to do overtime during busy periods.<br/>
🎧 Although you're not required to do this,<br/>
🎧 it can be a valuable experience -<br/>
🎧 so we advise you to take it up if possible.<br/>
🎧 Obviously, we understand that people do have commitments outside work,<br/>
🎧 so don't worry if there are times when you are unavailable.<br/>
🎧 As you know, we don't have a formal dress code here -<br/>
🎧 you may wear casual clothes as long as they're practical -<br/>
🎧 and the only restriction for shoes we have is on high heels for health and safety reasons.<br/>
🎧 Comfortable shoes like trainers are preferable.<br/>
🎧 There's a heavily subsidised canteen on site where you can get hot meals or salads cheaply.<br/>
🎧 Snacks and drinks are also provided -<br/>
🎧 so we've decided to introduce a no packed lunch policy.<br/>
🎧 This is partly to encourage healthy eating at work<br/>
🎧 and partly to stop people from eating at their workstation, which is unhygienic.<br/>
🎧 OK moving on to…<br/>
<br />

🎧 OK, so what I'd like you to do now is to talk to your partner about your presentations on urban planning.<br/>
🎧 You should have done most of the reading now, so I'd like you to share your ideas,<br/>
🎧 and talk about the structure of your presentation and what you need to do next.<br/>
🎧 OK Rob.<br/>
🎧 I'm glad we chose quite a specific topic - cities built next to the sea.<br/>
🎧 It made it much easier to find relevant information.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. And cities are growing so quickly -<br/>
🎧 I mean, we know that more than half the world's population lives in cities now.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, though that's all cities, not just ones on the coast.<br/>
🎧 But most of the biggest cities are actually built by the sea.<br/>
🎧 I'd not realised that before.<br/>
🎧 Nor me.<br/>
🎧 And what's more, a lot of them are built at places where rivers come out into the sea.<br/>
🎧 But apparently this can be a problem.<br/>
🎧 Why?<br/>
🎧 Well, as the city expands,<br/>
🎧 agriculture and industry tend to spread further inland along the rivers,<br/>
🎧 and so agriculture moves even further inland up the river.<br/>
🎧 That's not necessarily a problem,<br/>
🎧 except it means more and more pollutants are discharged into the rivers.<br/>
🎧 So these are brought downstream to the cities?<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Did you read that article about Miami, on the east coast of the USA?<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 Well, apparently back in the 1950s,<br/>
🎧 they built channels to drain away the water in case of flooding.<br/>
🎧 Sounds sensible.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, they spent quite a lot of money on them.<br/>
🎧 But what they didn't take into account was global warming.<br/>
🎧 So they built the drainage channels too close to sea level,<br/>
🎧 and now sea levels are rising, they're more or less useless.<br/>
🎧 If there's a lot of rain, the water can't run away, there's nowhere for it to go.<br/>
🎧 The whole design was faulty.<br/>
🎧 So what are the authorities doing about it now?<br/>
🎧 I don't know.<br/>
🎧 I did read that they're aiming to stop disposing of waste water into the ocean over the next ten years.<br/>
🎧 But that won't help with flood prevention now, will it?<br/>
🎧 No. Really they just need to find the money for something to replace the drainage channels,<br/>
🎧 in order to protect against flooding now.<br/>
🎧 But in the long term they need to consider the whole ecosystem.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Really, though, coastal cities can't deal with their problems on their own, can they?<br/>
🎧 I mean, they've got to start acting together at an international level instead of just doing their own thing.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely.<br/>
🎧 The thing is, everyone knows what the problems are<br/>
🎧 and environmentalists have a pretty good idea of what we should be doing about them,<br/>
🎧 so they should be able to work together to some extent.<br/>
🎧 But it's going to be a long time before countries come to a decision on what principles they're prepared to abide by.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, if they ever do.<br/>
🎧 So I think we've probably got enough for our presentation.<br/>
🎧 It's only fifteen minutes.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So I suppose we'll begin with some general historical background<br/>
🎧 about why coastal cities were established.<br/>
🎧 But we don't want to spend too long on that,<br/>
🎧 the other students will already know a bit about it.<br/>
🎧 It's all to do with communications and so on.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 We should mention some geographical factors,<br/>
🎧 things like wetlands and river estuaries and coastal erosion and so on.<br/>
🎧 We could have some maps of different cities with these features marked.<br/>
🎧 On a handout you mean?<br/>
🎧 Or some slides everyone can see?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, that'd be better.<br/>
🎧 It'd be good to go into past mistakes in a bit more detail.<br/>
🎧 Did you read that case study of the problems there were in New Orleans with flooding a few years ago?<br/>
🎧 Yes, We could use that as the basis for that part of the talk.<br/>
🎧 I don't think the other students will have read it,<br/>
🎧 but they'll remember hearing about the flooding at the time.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So that's probably enough background.<br/>
🎧 So then we'll go on to talk about what action's being taken to deal with the problems of coastal cities.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 What else do we need to talk about?<br/>
🎧 Maybe something on future risks, looking more at the long term, if populations continue to grow.<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 We'll need to do a bit of work there,<br/>
🎧 I haven't got much information, have you?<br/>
🎧 No. We'll need to look at some websites.<br/>
🎧 Shouldn't take too long.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And I think we should end by talking about international implications.<br/>
🎧 Maybe we could ask people in the audience.<br/>
🎧 We've got people from quite a lot of different places.<br/>
🎧 That'd be interesting, if we have time, yes.<br/>
🎧 So now…<br/>
<br />

🎧 Producing enough energy to meet our needs has become a serious problem.<br/>
🎧 Demand is rising rapidly,<br/>
🎧 because of the world's increasing population and expanding industry.<br/>
🎧 Burning fossil fuels, like gas, coal and oil,<br/>
🎧 seriously damages the environment<br/>
🎧 and they'll eventually run out.<br/>
🎧 For a number of years now,<br/>
🎧 scientists have been working out how we can derive energy from renewable sources,<br/>
🎧 such as the sun and wind, without causing pollution.<br/>
🎧 Today I'll outline marine renewable energy - also called ocean energy -<br/>
🎧 which harnesses the movement of the oceans.<br/>
🎧 Marine renewable energy can be divided into three main categories:<br/>
🎧 wave energy, tidal energy and ocean thermal energy conversion,<br/>
🎧 and I'll say a few words about each one.<br/>
🎧 First, wave energy.<br/>
🎧 Numerous devices have been invented to harvest wave energy,<br/>
🎧 with names such as Wave Dragon, the Penguin and Mighty Whale,<br/>
🎧 and research is going on to try and come up with a really efficient method.<br/>
🎧 This form of energy has plenty of potential, as the source is constant,<br/>
🎧 and there's no danger of waves coming to a standstill.<br/>
🎧 Electricity can be generated using onshore systems,<br/>
🎧 using a reservoir, or offshore systems.<br/>
🎧 But the problem with ocean waves is that they're erratic,<br/>
🎧 with the winds making them travel in every direction.<br/>
🎧 This adds to the difficulty of creating efficient technology:<br/>
🎧 ideally all the waves would travel smoothly and regularly along the same straight line.<br/>
🎧 Another drawback is that sand and other sediment on the ocean floor<br/>
🎧 might be stopped from flowing normally,<br/>
🎧 which can lead to environmental problems.<br/>
🎧 The second category of marine energy that I'll mention is tidal energy.<br/>
🎧 One major advantage of using the tide, rather than waves, as a source of energy<br/>
🎧 is that it's predictable:<br/>
🎧 we know the exact times of high and low tides for years to come.<br/>
🎧 For tidal energy to be effective,<br/>
🎧 the difference between high and low tides needs to be at least five metres,<br/>
🎧 and this occurs naturally in only about forty places on Earth.<br/>
🎧 But the right conditions can be created by constructing a tidal lagoon,<br/>
🎧 an area of sea water separated from the sea.<br/>
🎧 One current plan is to create a tidal lagoon on the coast of Wales.<br/>
🎧 This will be an area of water within a bay at Swansea,<br/>
🎧 sheltered by a U-shaped breakwater, or dam, built out from the coast.<br/>
🎧 The breakwater will contain sixteen hydro turbines,<br/>
🎧 and as the tide rises, water rushes through the breakwater,<br/>
🎧 activating the turbines, which turn a generator to produce electricity.<br/>
🎧 Then, for three hours as the tide goes out,<br/>
🎧 the water is held back within the breakwater,<br/>
🎧 increasing the difference in water level,<br/>
🎧 until it's several metres higher within the lagoon than in the open sea.<br/>
🎧 Then, in order to release the stored water,<br/>
🎧 gates in the breakwater are opened.<br/>
🎧 It pours powerfully out of the lagoon,<br/>
🎧 driving the turbines in the breakwater in the opposite direction<br/>
🎧 and again generating thousands of megawatts of electricity.<br/>
🎧 As there are two high tides a day,<br/>
🎧 this lagoon scheme would generate electricity four times a day, every day,<br/>
🎧 for a total of around 14 hours in every 24,<br/>
🎧 and enough electricity for over 150,000 homes.<br/>
🎧 This system has quite a lot in its favour:<br/>
🎧 unlike solar and wind energy it doesn't depend on the weather;<br/>
🎧 the turbines are operated without the need for fuel,<br/>
🎧 so it doesn't create any greenhouse gas emissions;<br/>
🎧 and very little maintenance is needed.<br/>
🎧 It's estimated that electricity generated in this way will be relatively cheap,<br/>
🎧 and that manufacturing the components would create more than 2,000 jobs,<br/>
🎧 a big boost to the local economy.<br/>
🎧 On the other hand,<br/>
🎧 there are fears that lagoons might harm both fish and birds,<br/>
🎧 for example by disturbing migration patterns,<br/>
🎧 and causing a build-up of silt, affecting local ecosystems.<br/>
🎧 There are other forms of tidal energy,<br/>
🎧 but I'll go on to the third category of marine energy:<br/>
🎧 ocean thermal energy conversion.<br/>
🎧 This depends on there being a big difference in temperature<br/>
🎧 between surface water and the water a couple of kilometres below the surface,<br/>
🎧 and this occurs in tropical coastal areas.<br/>
🎧 The idea is to bring cold water up to the surface using a submerged pipe.<br/>
🎧 The concept dates back to 1881...<br/>
<br/><br/>
