🎧 Hello, Easy Life <span>Cleaning</span> <span>Services</span>, <span>Jacinta</span> <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh hello.<br/>
🎧 I'm looking for a <span>cleaning</span> <span>service</span> for my <span>apartment</span>,<br/>
🎧 do you do <span>domestic</span> <span>cleaning</span>?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 Well, it's just a <span>one-bedroom</span> <span>flat</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you have a <span>basic</span> <span>cleaning</span> <span>package</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 For a <span>one-bedroom</span> <span>flat</span> we're probably looking at about two hours for a <span>clean</span>.<br/>
🎧 So we'd do a <span>thorough</span> <span>clean</span> of all <span>surfaces</span> in each room,<br/>
🎧 and <span>polish</span> them where <span>necessary</span>.<br/>
🎧 Does your <span>apartment</span> have <span>carpets</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, I don't have any, but the <span>floor</span> would need <span>cleaning</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course, we'd do that in every room.<br/>
🎧 And we'd do a <span>thorough</span> <span>clean</span> of the <span>kitchen</span> and <span>bathroom</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Then we have some <span>additional</span> <span>services</span> which you can <span>request</span> if you want,<br/>
🎧 so for example, we can <span>clean</span> your <span>oven</span> for you every week.<br/>
🎧 Actually, I <span>hardly</span> ever use that,<br/>
🎧 but can you do the <span>fridge</span>?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 Would you like that done every week?<br/>
🎧 Yes, definitely.<br/>
🎧 And would <span>ironing</span> <span>clothes</span> be an <span>additional</span> <span>service</span> you can do?<br/>
🎧 Yes, of course.<br/>
🎧 It wouldn't be much, just my <span>shirts</span> for work that week.<br/>
🎧 That's fine.<br/>
🎧 And we could also <span>clean</span> your <span>microwave</span> if you want.<br/>
🎧 No, I <span>wipe</span> that out <span>pretty</span> <span>regularly</span> so there's no need for that.<br/>
🎧 We also <span>offer</span> <span>additional</span> <span>services</span> that you might want a bit less often, say every month.<br/>
🎧 So for example, if the inside of your <span>windows</span> need <span>cleaning</span>, we could do that.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that'd be good.<br/>
🎧 I'm on the <span>fifteenth</span> <span>floor</span>, so the outside <span>gets</span> done <span>regularly</span> by <span>specialists</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the inside does get a bit <span>grubby</span>.<br/>
🎧 And we could <span>arrange</span> for your <span>curtains</span> to get <span>cleaned</span> if <span>necessary</span>.<br/>
🎧 No, they're OK.<br/>
🎧 But would you be able to do something about the <span>balcony</span>?<br/>
🎧 It's quite small and I don't use it much,<br/>
🎧 but it could do with a <span>wash</span> every month or so.<br/>
🎧 Yes, we can get the <span>pressure</span> <span>washer</span> <span>onto</span> that.<br/>
🎧 Now if you're interested,<br/>
🎧 we do <span>offer</span> some other <span>possibilities</span> to do with <span>general</span> <span>maintenance</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, if you have a <span>problem</span> with water and you need a <span>plumber</span> in a <span>hurry</span>,<br/>
🎧 we can put you in touch with a <span>reliable</span> one who can come out <span>straightaway</span>.<br/>
🎧 And the same thing if you need an <span>electrician</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right. That's good to know.<br/>
🎧 I've only just <span>moved</span> here so I don't have any of those <span>sorts</span> of <span>contacts</span>.<br/>
🎧 And I don't know if this is of <span>interest</span> to you,<br/>
🎧 but we also <span>offer</span> a special <span>vacuum</span> <span>cleaning</span> <span>system<br/></span>
🎧 which can <span>improve</span> the <span>indoor</span> air <span>quality</span> of your home by <span>capturing</span> up to <span>99%</span> of all the <span>dust</span> in the air.<br/>
🎧 So if you're <span>troubled</span> by <span>allergies</span>, this can make a big <span>difference</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right. In <span>fact</span>, I don't have that <span>sort</span> of <span>problem</span>, but I'll <span>bear</span> it in <span>mind</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now can you tell me a bit about your <span>cleaning</span> <span>staff</span>?<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 So all our <span>cleaners</span> are very <span>carefully</span> <span>selected</span>.<br/>
🎧 When they <span>apply</span> to us, they have to <span>undergo</span> a <span>security</span> check with the <span>police<br/></span>
🎧 to make sure they don't have any <span>sort</span> of <span>criminal</span> <span>background</span>,<br/>
🎧 and, of course, they have to <span>provide</span> <span>references</span> as well.<br/>
🎧 Then if we think they might be <span>suitable</span> for the <span>job</span>, we give them <span>training</span> for it.<br/>
🎧 That <span>lasts</span> for two <span>weeks</span> so it's very <span>thorough</span>,<br/>
🎧 and at the end of it, they have a <span>test</span>.<br/>
🎧 If they <span>pass</span> that, we take them on,<br/>
🎧 but we <span>monitor</span> them very <span>carefully</span>,<br/>
🎧 we ask all our <span>clients</span> to <span>complete</span> a <span>review</span> of their <span>performance</span> after every visit and to <span>email</span> it to us.<br/>
🎧 So we can <span>pick</span> up any <span>problems</span> <span>straightaway</span> and <span>deal</span> with them.<br/>
🎧 OK, well that all sounds good.<br/>
🎧 And will I always have the same <span>cleaner</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, we do our best to <span>organise</span> it that way, and we usually <span>manage</span> it.<br/>
🎧 Good. That's fine.<br/>
🎧 Right, so I'd like to go ahead <span>and..</span>.<br/>

🎧 As many of you here today have <span>worked</span> in the <span>hotel</span> <span>industry</span> for some time,<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you have <span>experienced</span> the <span>problem</span> of high <span>staff</span> <span>turnover</span> in your <span>hotels</span>.<br/>
🎧 Every <span>hotel</span> <span>relies</span> on having <span>loyal</span> and <span>experienced</span> <span>members</span> of <span>staff<br/></span>
🎧 who make sure that everything <span>runs</span> <span>smoothly</span>.<br/>
🎧 If <span>staff</span> are <span>constantly</span> <span>changing</span>,<br/>
🎧 it can make life <span>difficult</span> for everyone.<br/>
🎧 But why do <span>staff</span> leave <span>frequently</span> in many <span>hotels</span>?<br/>
🎧 Of course, many <span>hotel</span> <span>jobs</span>, such as <span>cleaning</span>, are <span>low-skilled</span> and are not <span>well-paid</span>.<br/>
🎧 A lot of <span>managers</span> think it's this and the long hours that are the <span>main</span> <span>causes</span> of high <span>staff</span> <span>turnover</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 but what they don't <span>realise</span> is that it's the <span>lack</span> of <span>training</span> in many <span>hotel</span> <span>jobs</span> which is a <span>huge</span> <span>factor</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, what kind of <span>problems</span> does a high <span>turnover</span> of <span>staff</span> <span>cause</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, having to <span>recruit</span> new <span>staff</span> all the time can be very <span>time-consuming</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>managers</span> may have to <span>cover</span> some <span>duties</span> while <span>waiting</span> for new <span>staff</span> to <span>arrive</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>means</span> they don't have time to think about less <span>immediate</span> <span>problems<br/></span>
🎧 such as how to <span>improve</span> their <span>service</span>.<br/>
🎧 When <span>staff</span> leave, it can also <span>severely</span> <span>affect</span> the <span>colleagues</span> they leave behind.<br/>
🎧 It has a <span>negative</span> <span>effect</span> on <span>remaining</span> <span>staff</span>,<br/>
🎧 who may start to feel that they too should be thinking about <span>leaving</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, what can be done to change this <span>situation</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Firstly</span>, <span>managers</span> should <span>stop</span> <span>making</span> <span>basic</span> <span>errors<br/></span>
🎧 which leave their <span>staff</span> feeling <span>upset</span> and <span>resentful</span>.<br/>
🎧 When <span>organising</span> <span>shifts</span>, for example,<br/>
🎧 make sure you never give <span>certain</span> <span>staff</span> <span>preferential</span> <span>treatment</span>.<br/>
🎧 All <span>staff</span> should be <span>given</span> some <span>choice</span> about when they work,<br/>
🎧 and everyone should have to work some <span>evening</span> and weekend <span>shifts</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you <span>treat</span> <span>staff</span> <span>fairly</span>,<br/>
🎧 they'll be more <span>likely</span> to <span>step</span> in and help when <span>extra</span> <span>staff</span> are <span>needed</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Keeping</span> <span>staff</span> happy has other <span>tangible</span> <span>benefits</span> for the <span>business</span>.<br/>
🎧 Take the <span>Dunwich</span> <span>Hotel</span> as an example.<br/>
🎧 It had been <span>experiencing</span> a <span>problem</span> with <span>staff</span> <span>complaints<br/></span>
🎧 and in order to <span>deal</span> with this,<br/>
🎧 <span>invested</span> in <span>staff</span> <span>training<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>improved</span> <span>staff</span> <span>conditions</span>.<br/>
🎧 Not only did the <span>level</span> of <span>complaints</span> <span>fall</span>,<br/>
🎧 but they also <span>noticed</span> a <span>significant</span> <span>increase</span> in the amount each <span>customer</span> <span>spent</span> during their <span>stay</span>.<br/>
🎧 They have now <span>introduced</span> a <span>customer</span> <span>loyalty</span> <span>scheme<br/></span>
🎧 which is going really well.<br/>
🎧 Now I'd like to look at some <span>ways</span> you can <span>reduce</span> <span>staff</span> <span>turnover</span> in your <span>hotels</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I'll do this by <span>giving</span> some <span>examples</span> of <span>hotels</span> where I've done some <span>training</span> <span>recently</span>.<br/>
🎧 The Sun <span>Club</span> <span>received</span> <span>feedback</span> which <span>showed</span> that <span>staff</span> thought <span>managers</span> didn't <span>value</span> their <span>opinions</span>.<br/>
🎧 They weren't made to feel they were <span>partners</span> who were <span>contributing</span> to the success of the <span>business</span> as a whole.<br/>
🎧 This <span>situation</span> has <span>changed</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Junior</span> <span>staff</span> at all <span>levels</span> are <span>regularly</span> <span>invited</span> to <span>meetings</span> where their <span>ideas</span> are <span>welcomed</span>.<br/>
🎧 A year ago, The <span>Portland</span> <span>recognised</span> the need to <span>invest</span> in <span>staff</span> <span>retention</span>.<br/>
🎧 Their first <span>step</span> was to <span>introduce</span> a <span>scheme</span> for <span>recognising</span> <span>talent</span> <span>amongst</span> their <span>employees</span>.<br/>
🎧 The hope is that <span>organising</span> <span>training</span> for <span>individuals</span> with <span>management</span> <span>potential</span> will <span>encourage</span> them to <span>stay</span> with the <span>business</span>.<br/>
🎧 At <span>Bluewater</span>, <span>managers</span> <span>decided</span> to <span>recognise</span> <span>50</span> high <span>achievers</span> from across the <span>company's</span> <span>huge</span> <span>hotel</span> <span>chain</span>.<br/>
🎧 As a <span>reward</span>, they're <span>sent</span> on an <span>all-expenses-paid</span> <span>trip</span> <span>abroad</span> every year.<br/>
🎧 Fun is an important <span>element</span> in the <span>trips</span>,<br/>
🎧 but there's also the <span>opportunity</span> to learn something <span>useful</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>year's</span> <span>trip</span> <span>included</span> a visit to a <span>brewery</span>,<br/>
🎧 where <span>staff</span> <span>learned</span> about the new <span>beer</span> that would be <span>served</span> in the <span>hotel</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Pentlow</span> <span>Hotels</span> <span>identified</span> that <span>retention</span> of <span>junior</span> <span>reception</span> <span>staff</span> was an issue.<br/>
🎧 In order to <span>encourage</span> them to see that working in a <span>hotel</span> could be <span>worthwhile</span> and <span>rewarding</span>, with good <span>prospects</span>,<br/>
🎧 they <span>introduced</span> a <span>management</span> <span>programme</span>.<br/>
🎧 These <span>staff</span> were <span>given</span> <span>additional</span> <span>responsibilities</span> and the <span>chance</span> to work in <span>various</span> <span>roles</span> in the <span>hotel</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Green</span> <span>Planets</span> wanted to be <span>seen</span> as a <span>caring</span> <span>employer</span>.<br/>
🎧 To make life <span>easier</span> for <span>staff</span>, many of whom had <span>childcare</span> <span>responsibilities</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>hotel</span> <span>began</span> <span>issuing</span> <span>vouchers</span> to help <span>cover</span> the <span>cost</span> of <span>childcare</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Louise</span> <span>Marsh</span> at The <span>Amesbury</span> has one of the best <span>staff</span> <span>retention</span> <span>rates</span> in the <span>business</span>.<br/>
🎧 Since she <span>joined</span> the company,<br/>
🎧 she's made a <span>huge</span> <span>effort</span> to <span>achieve</span> this by <span>creating</span> a <span>co-operative</span> and <span>supportive</span> <span>environment</span>.<br/>
🎧 For her, the <span>staff</span> are <span>part</span> of a large <span>family</span> where everyone is <span>valued</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, now I'd like <span>to..</span>.<br/>

🎧 Hi <span>Thomas</span>, how are you <span>enjoying</span> the course so <span>far</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I think it's good.<br/>
🎧 <span>Remind</span> me, why did you decide to <span>study</span> <span>sports</span> <span>science</span>?<br/>
🎧 Didn't you want to be a <span>professional</span> <span>athlete</span> when you were at school?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, that was my <span>goal</span>,<br/>
🎧 and all my <span>classmates</span> <span>assumed</span> I would <span>achieve</span> <span>it;</span> they thought I was <span>brilliant</span>.<br/>
🎧 That must have been a nice feeling.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mm</span>, I thought I could win anything.<br/>
🎧 There was no one who could run <span>faster</span> than me.<br/>
🎧 Exactly, so what <span>happened</span>?<br/>
🎧 Did your <span>mum</span> and dad want you to be more <span>'academic'</span>?<br/>
🎧 Not at all.<br/>
🎧 <span>Perhaps</span> they should have <span>pushed</span> me <span>harder</span>, though.<br/>
🎧 What do you mean?<br/>
🎧 I think I should have <span>practised</span> more.<br/>
🎧 What makes you say that?<br/>
🎧 Well, I went out to <span>Kenya</span> for a <span>couple</span> of <span>weeks</span> to <span>train..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Really! I didn't know that.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>chosen</span> to go there out of <span>loads</span> of <span>kids</span> and run with some of the top <span>teenage</span> <span>athletes</span> in the <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>And..</span>. I was so <span>calm</span> about it.<br/>
🎧 I just <span>kept</span> thinking how <span>fortunate</span> I was.<br/>
🎧 What a great <span>chance</span> this was!<br/>
🎧 Everyone back home was so <span>proud</span> of me.<br/>
🎧 But once we <span>started</span> <span>competing</span>, I very quickly <span>realised</span> I wasn't good enough.<br/>
🎧 That must have been a <span>huge</span> <span>shock</span>.<br/>
🎧 I thought <span>'this</span> can't be <span>happening'</span>!<br/>
🎧 I was used to <span>winning</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm sorry to hear that.<br/>
🎧 It's OK.<br/>
🎧 I'm over it <span>now<br/></span>
🎧 and I think it's much better to do a university <span>course<br/></span>
🎧 and this one has such a <span>variety</span> of <span>sports-related</span> <span>areas</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's going to be good.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I agree, I <span>chose</span> it because of that.<br/>
🎧 So <span>Jeanne</span>, have you thought of any <span>ideas</span> for the <span>discussion</span> <span>session</span> next week on <span>technology</span> and <span>sport</span>?<br/>
🎧 We have to <span>cover</span> more than one <span>sport</span>, don't we?<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 You know, we always think <span>technology</span> is about the future,<br/>
🎧 but we could <span>gather</span> some <span>ideas</span> about <span>past</span> <span>developments</span> in <span>sport</span>.<br/>
🎧 Look at <span>early</span> <span>types</span> of <span>equipment</span> <span>perhaps</span>?<br/>
🎧 I remember <span>reading</span> something about <span>table</span> <span>tennis</span> <span>bats</span> once,<br/>
🎧 how they <span>ended</span> up being <span>covered</span> with <span>pimpled</span> <span>rubber</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Cos</span> they were just <span>wooden</span> at first, I'd <span>imagine</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 In about the <span>1920s</span>,<br/>
🎧 a <span>factory</span> was <span>making</span> <span>rolls</span> of the <span>rubber</span> in <span>bulk</span> for something like <span>horse</span> <span>harnesses</span>.<br/>
🎧 Really!<br/>
🎧 Yeah, and <span>someone</span> <span>realised</span> that it would make a perfect <span>covering</span> for the <span>wooden</span> <span>bats</span>.<br/>
🎧 So what about <span>cricket</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's had a few <span>innovative</span> changes.<br/>
🎧 Maybe the <span>pads</span> they <span>wear</span> on their <span>legs</span>?<br/>
🎧 I don't think <span>they've</span> <span>changed</span> much but, I'm just looking on the <span>internet..</span>.<br/>
🎧 and it says that when the first <span>cricket</span> <span>helmet</span> came in, in <span>1978</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>Australian</span> <span>batsman</span> who first <span>wore</span> it was <span>booed</span> and <span>jeered</span> by people watching because it was so <span>ugly</span>!<br/>
🎧 Wow, <span>players</span> have to <span>protect</span> <span>themselves</span> from getting <span>hurt</span>!<br/>
🎧 I mean everyone <span>wears</span> one now.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mm</span>, <span>unlike</span> the <span>cycle</span> <span>helmet</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>unless</span> you're a <span>professional</span>,<br/>
🎧 but you're right, many <span>ordinary</span> <span>bikers</span> don't <span>wear</span> a <span>helmet</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hey, look at these <span>pictures</span> of <span>original</span> <span>helmet</span> <span>designs</span>.<br/>
🎧 This one looks like an <span>upside-down</span> <span>bowl</span>!<br/>
🎧 Yet, the <span>woman's</span> <span>laughing</span>,<br/>
🎧 she's so <span>proud</span> to be <span>wearing</span> it!<br/>
🎧 It says serious <span>cyclists</span> <span>ended</span> up with wet <span>hair</span> from all the <span>hard</span> <span>exercise</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>guess</span> that's why they have large air <span>vents</span> in them <span>now<br/></span>
🎧 so that the <span>skin</span> can <span>breathe</span> more <span>easily</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, so we've done <span>helmets</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about <span>golf</span> <span>balls</span> or better still <span>golf</span> <span>clubs</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>they've</span> <span>changed</span> a lot.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I remember my great <span>grandfather</span> <span>telling</span> me that because a <span>club</span> was made <span>entirely</span> of <span>wood</span>,<br/>
🎧 it would <span>easily</span> <span>break</span> and <span>players</span> had to get another.<br/>
🎧 There's no <span>wood</span> at all in them now, is there?<br/>
🎧 No, they're much more <span>powerful</span>.<br/>
🎧 The same must be <span>true</span> of <span>hockey</span> <span>sticks</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't think so because <span>players</span> still use <span>wooden</span> <span>sticks</span> today.<br/>
🎧 What it does say here, though,<br/>
🎧 is that when the game <span>started</span> you had to <span>produce</span> a <span>stick</span> yourself.<br/>
🎧 I <span>guess</span> they just weren't being <span>manufactured</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, one more <span>perhaps</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about <span>football</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I know the first <span>balls</span> were made of <span>animal</span> <span>skin</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, they <span>covered</span> them with <span>pieces</span> of <span>leather</span> that were <span>stitched</span> together,<br/>
🎧 <span>but..</span>. the <span>balls</span> let in water when it <span>rained</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that would have made them much <span>heavier</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 You can <span>imagine</span> the <span>damage</span> to <span>player's</span> <span>necks</span> when the <span>ball</span> was <span>headed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, how <span>painful</span> that must have been!<br/>
🎧 Yeah, well, I think we can put together some <span>useful</span> <span>ideas..</span>.<br/>

🎧 Hello everyone.<br/>
🎧 Today we're going to look at another <span>natural</span> food <span>product<br/></span>
🎧 and that's <span>maple</span> <span>syrup</span>.<br/>
🎧 What is this exactly?<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>maple</span> <span>syrup</span> looks rather like <span>clear</span> <span>honey</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it's not made by <span>bees;<br/></span>
🎧 it's <span>produced</span> from the <span>plant</span> <span>fluid</span>, or <span>sap</span>, inside the <span>maple</span> <span>tree<br/></span>
🎧 and that makes <span>maple</span> <span>syrup</span> a very <span>natural</span> product.<br/>
🎧 <span>Maple</span> <span>syrup</span> is a <span>thick</span>, <span>golden</span>, <span>sweet-tasting</span> <span>liquid<br/></span>
🎧 that can be <span>bought</span> in <span>bottles</span> or <span>jars<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>poured</span> <span>onto</span> food such as <span>waffles</span> and ice <span>cream<br/></span>
🎧 or used in the <span>baking</span> of <span>cakes</span> and <span>pastries</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>contains</span> no <span>preservatives</span> or <span>added</span> <span>ingredients</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it <span>provides</span> a <span>healthy</span> <span>alternative</span> to <span>refined</span> <span>sugar</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's just talk a bit about the <span>maple</span> <span>tree</span> <span>itself</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is where <span>maple</span> <span>syrup</span> comes from.<br/>
🎧 So, there are many <span>species</span> of <span>maple</span> <span>tree</span>,<br/>
🎧 and they'll <span>grow</span> without <span>fertilizer</span> in <span>areas</span> where there's <span>plenty</span> of <span>moisture</span> in the <span>soil</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, they'll only do this if another important <span>criterion</span> is <span>fulfilled</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is that they must have full or <span>partial</span> sun <span>exposure</span> during the day and very <span>cool</span> <span>nights</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I'll talk more about that in a <span>minute</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are only <span>certain</span> <span>parts</span> of the <span>world</span> that <span>provide</span> all these <span>conditions</span>:<br/>
🎧 one is <span>Canada</span>,<br/>
🎧 and by that, I mean all <span>parts</span> of <span>Canada</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the other is the <span>north-eastern</span> <span>states</span> of <span>North</span> <span>America</span>.<br/>
🎧 In these <span>areas</span>, the <span>climate</span> <span>suits</span> the <span>trees</span> <span>perfectly</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, <span>Canada</span> <span>produces</span> over <span>two-thirds</span> of the <span>world's</span> <span>maple</span> <span>syrup</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is why the <span>five-pointed</span> <span>maple</span> <span>leaf</span> is a <span>Canadian</span> <span>symbol<br/></span>
🎧 and has <span>featured</span> on the <span>flag</span> since <span>1964</span>.<br/>
🎧 So how did <span>maple</span> <span>syrup</span> <span>production</span> <span>begin</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, long before <span>Europeans</span> <span>settled</span> in these <span>parts</span> of the <span>world</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>indigenous</span> <span>communities</span> had <span>started</span> <span>producing</span> <span>maple</span> <span>sugar</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>bored</span> <span>holes</span> in the <span>trunks</span> of <span>maple</span> <span>trees<br/></span>
🎧 and used <span>containers</span> made of <span>tree</span> <span>bark</span> to <span>collect</span> the <span>liquid</span> <span>sap</span> as it <span>poured</span> out.<br/>
🎧 As they were <span>unable</span> to keep the <span>liquid</span> for any <span>length</span> of time,<br/>
🎧 they didn't have <span>storage</span> <span>facilities</span> in those <span>days</span>,<br/>
🎧 they <span>boiled</span> the <span>liquid</span> by <span>placing</span> <span>pieces</span> of <span>rock</span> that had become <span>scorching</span> hot from the sun into the <span>sap</span>.<br/>
🎧 They did this until it <span>turned</span> into <span>sugar</span>,<br/>
🎧 and they were then able to use this to <span>sweeten</span> their food and <span>drinks</span>.<br/>
🎧 Since that time, <span>improvements</span> have been made to the <span>process</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it has <span>changed</span> very little <span>overall</span>.<br/>
🎧 So let's look at the <span>production</span> of <span>maple</span> <span>syrup</span> today.<br/>
🎧 <span>Clearly</span>, the <span>maple</span> <span>forests</span> are a <span>valuable</span> <span>resource</span> in many <span>Canadian</span> and <span>North</span> <span>American</span> <span>communities</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>trees</span> have to be well <span>looked</span> <span>after<br/></span>
🎧 and they <span>cannot</span> be used to make <span>syrup</span> until the <span>trunks</span> <span>reach</span> a <span>diameter</span> of around <span>25</span> <span>centimetres</span>.<br/>
🎧 This can take anything up to <span>40</span> years.<br/>
🎧 As I've already <span>mentioned</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>maple</span> <span>trees</span> need the right <span>conditions</span> to <span>grow</span> and also to <span>produce</span> <span>sap</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why is this?<br/>
🎧 Well, what <span>happens</span> is that during a <span>cold</span> <span>night</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>tree</span> <span>absorbs</span> water from the <span>soil</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that <span>rises</span> through the <span>tree's</span> <span>vascular</span> <span>system</span>.<br/>
🎧 But then in the <span>warmer</span> <span>daytime</span>,<br/>
🎧 the change in <span>temperature</span> <span>causes</span> the water to be <span>pushed</span> back down to the <span>bottom</span> of the <span>tree</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>continual</span> <span>movement</span>, up and down,<br/>
🎧 <span>leads</span> to the <span>formation</span> of the <span>sap</span> <span>needed</span> for <span>maple</span> <span>syrup</span> <span>production</span>.<br/>
🎧 When the <span>tree</span> is ready,<br/>
🎧 it can be <span>tapped</span> and this <span>involves</span> <span>drilling</span> a small <span>hole</span> into the <span>trunk<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>inserting</span> a <span>tube</span> into it that <span>ends</span> in a <span>bucket</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>trees</span> can often take <span>several</span> <span>taps</span>,<br/>
🎧 though the <span>workers</span> take <span>care</span> not to <span>cause</span> any <span>damage</span> to the <span>healthy</span> <span>growth</span> of the <span>tree</span> <span>itself</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>sap</span> that comes out of the <span>trees</span> <span>consists</span> of <span>98%</span> <span>water<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>2%</span> <span>sugar</span> and other <span>nutrients</span>.<br/>
🎧 It has to be <span>boiled</span> so that much of that water <span>evaporates</span>,<br/>
🎧 and this <span>process</span> has to take place <span>immediately</span>, <span>using</span> what are called <span>evaporators</span>.<br/>
🎧 These are <span>basically</span> <span>extremely</span> large <span>pans</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>sap</span> is <span>poured</span> into these,<br/>
🎧 a <span>fire</span> is <span>built</span> and the <span>pans</span> are then <span>heated</span> until the <span>sap</span> <span>boils</span>.<br/>
🎧 As it does this, the water <span>evaporates</span>, and the <span>syrup</span> <span>begins</span> to <span>form</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>evaporation</span> <span>process</span> <span>creates</span> large <span>quantities</span> of <span>steam</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>sap</span> <span>becomes</span> <span>thicker</span> and <span>denser</span>, and, at just the right <span>moment</span>,<br/>
🎧 when the <span>sap</span> is <span>thick</span> enough to be called <span>maple</span> <span>syrup</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>worker</span> <span>removes</span> it from the <span>heat</span>.<br/>
🎧 After this <span>process</span>, something called <span>'sugar</span> <span>sand'</span> has to be <span>filtered</span> <span>out<br/></span>
🎧 as this <span>builds</span> up during the <span>boiling</span> and <span>gives</span> the <span>syrup</span> a <span>cloudy</span> <span>appearance</span> and a <span>slightly</span> <span>gritty</span> <span>taste</span>.<br/>
🎧 Once this has been done,<br/>
🎧 the <span>syrup</span> is ready to be <span>packaged</span> so that it can be used for a whole <span>variety</span> of <span>products</span>.<br/>
🎧 It takes <span>40</span> <span>litres</span> of <span>sap</span> to <span>produce</span> one <span>litre</span> of <span>maple</span> <span>syrup<br/></span>
🎧 so you can get an idea of how much is <span>needed</span>!<br/>
🎧 So that's the <span>basic</span> <span>process..</span>.<br/>
