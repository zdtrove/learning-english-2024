🎧 Hello, Easy Life Cleaning</span> Services</span>, Jacinta</span> speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh hello.<br/>
🎧 I'm looking for a cleaning</span> service</span> for my apartment</span>,<br/>
🎧 do you do domestic</span> cleaning</span>?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 Well, it's just a one-bedroom</span> flat</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you have a basic</span> cleaning</span> package</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 For a one-bedroom</span> flat</span> we're probably looking at about two hours for a clean</span>.<br/>
🎧 So we'd do a thorough</span> clean</span> of all surfaces</span> in each room,<br/>
🎧 and polish</span> them where necessary</span>.<br/>
🎧 Does your apartment</span> have carpets</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, I don't have any, but the floor</span> would need cleaning</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course, we'd do that in every room.<br/>
🎧 And we'd do a thorough</span> clean</span> of the kitchen</span> and bathroom</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Then we have some additional</span> services</span> which you can request</span> if you want,<br/>
🎧 so for example, we can clean</span> your oven</span> for you every week.<br/>
🎧 Actually, I hardly</span> ever use that,<br/>
🎧 but can you do the fridge</span>?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 Would you like that done every week?<br/>
🎧 Yes, definitely.<br/>
🎧 And would ironing</span> clothes</span> be an additional</span> service</span> you can do?<br/>
🎧 Yes, of course.<br/>
🎧 It wouldn't be much, just my shirts</span> for work that week.<br/>
🎧 That's fine.<br/>
🎧 And we could also clean</span> your microwave</span> if you want.<br/>
🎧 No, I wipe</span> that out pretty</span> regularly</span> so there's no need for that.<br/>
🎧 We also offer</span> additional</span> services</span> that you might want a bit less often, say every month.<br/>
🎧 So for example, if the inside of your windows</span> need cleaning</span>, we could do that.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that'd be good.<br/>
🎧 I'm on the fifteenth</span> floor</span>, so the outside gets</span> done regularly</span> by specialists</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the inside does get a bit grubby</span>.<br/>
🎧 And we could arrange</span> for your curtains</span> to get cleaned</span> if necessary</span>.<br/>
🎧 No, they're OK.<br/>
🎧 But would you be able to do something about the balcony</span>?<br/>
🎧 It's quite small and I don't use it much,<br/>
🎧 but it could do with a wash</span> every month or so.<br/>
🎧 Yes, we can get the pressure</span> washer</span> onto</span> that.<br/>
🎧 Now if you're interested,<br/>
🎧 we do offer</span> some other possibilities</span> to do with general</span> maintenance</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, if you have a problem</span> with water and you need a plumber</span> in a hurry</span>,<br/>
🎧 we can put you in touch with a reliable</span> one who can come out straightaway</span>.<br/>
🎧 And the same thing if you need an electrician</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right. That's good to know.<br/>
🎧 I've only just moved</span> here so I don't have any of those sorts</span> of contacts</span>.<br/>
🎧 And I don't know if this is of interest</span> to you,<br/>
🎧 but we also offer</span> a special vacuum</span> cleaning</span> system<br/></span>
🎧 which can improve</span> the indoor</span> air quality</span> of your home by capturing</span> up to 99%</span> of all the dust</span> in the air.<br/>
🎧 So if you're troubled</span> by allergies</span>, this can make a big difference</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right. In fact</span>, I don't have that sort</span> of problem</span>, but I'll bear</span> it in mind</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now can you tell me a bit about your cleaning</span> staff</span>?<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 So all our cleaners</span> are very carefully</span> selected</span>.<br/>
🎧 When they apply</span> to us, they have to undergo</span> a security</span> check with the police<br/></span>
🎧 to make sure they don't have any sort</span> of criminal</span> background</span>,<br/>
🎧 and, of course, they have to provide</span> references</span> as well.<br/>
🎧 Then if we think they might be suitable</span> for the job</span>, we give them training</span> for it.<br/>
🎧 That lasts</span> for two weeks</span> so it's very thorough</span>,<br/>
🎧 and at the end of it, they have a test</span>.<br/>
🎧 If they pass</span> that, we take them on,<br/>
🎧 but we monitor</span> them very carefully</span>,<br/>
🎧 we ask all our clients</span> to complete</span> a review</span> of their performance</span> after every visit and to email</span> it to us.<br/>
🎧 So we can pick</span> up any problems</span> straightaway</span> and deal</span> with them.<br/>
🎧 OK, well that all sounds good.<br/>
🎧 And will I always have the same cleaner</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, we do our best to organise</span> it that way, and we usually manage</span> it.<br/>
🎧 Good. That's fine.<br/>
🎧 Right, so I'd like to go ahead and..</span>.<br/>

🎧 As many of you here today have worked</span> in the hotel</span> industry</span> for some time,<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you have experienced</span> the problem</span> of high staff</span> turnover</span> in your hotels</span>.<br/>
🎧 Every hotel</span> relies</span> on having loyal</span> and experienced</span> members</span> of staff<br/></span>
🎧 who make sure that everything runs</span> smoothly</span>.<br/>
🎧 If staff</span> are constantly</span> changing</span>,<br/>
🎧 it can make life difficult</span> for everyone.<br/>
🎧 But why do staff</span> leave frequently</span> in many hotels</span>?<br/>
🎧 Of course, many hotel</span> jobs</span>, such as cleaning</span>, are low-skilled</span> and are not well-paid</span>.<br/>
🎧 A lot of managers</span> think it's this and the long hours that are the main</span> causes</span> of high staff</span> turnover</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 but what they don't realise</span> is that it's the lack</span> of training</span> in many hotel</span> jobs</span> which is a huge</span> factor</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, what kind of problems</span> does a high turnover</span> of staff</span> cause</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, having to recruit</span> new staff</span> all the time can be very time-consuming</span>,<br/>
🎧 and managers</span> may have to cover</span> some duties</span> while waiting</span> for new staff</span> to arrive</span>.<br/>
🎧 This means</span> they don't have time to think about less immediate</span> problems<br/></span>
🎧 such as how to improve</span> their service</span>.<br/>
🎧 When staff</span> leave, it can also severely</span> affect</span> the colleagues</span> they leave behind.<br/>
🎧 It has a negative</span> effect</span> on remaining</span> staff</span>,<br/>
🎧 who may start to feel that they too should be thinking about leaving</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, what can be done to change this situation</span>?<br/>
🎧 Firstly</span>, managers</span> should stop</span> making</span> basic</span> errors<br/></span>
🎧 which leave their staff</span> feeling upset</span> and resentful</span>.<br/>
🎧 When organising</span> shifts</span>, for example,<br/>
🎧 make sure you never give certain</span> staff</span> preferential</span> treatment</span>.<br/>
🎧 All staff</span> should be given</span> some choice</span> about when they work,<br/>
🎧 and everyone should have to work some evening</span> and weekend shifts</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you treat</span> staff</span> fairly</span>,<br/>
🎧 they'll be more likely</span> to step</span> in and help when extra</span> staff</span> are needed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Keeping</span> staff</span> happy has other tangible</span> benefits</span> for the business</span>.<br/>
🎧 Take the Dunwich</span> Hotel</span> as an example.<br/>
🎧 It had been experiencing</span> a problem</span> with staff</span> complaints<br/></span>
🎧 and in order to deal</span> with this,<br/>
🎧 invested</span> in staff</span> training<br/></span>
🎧 and improved</span> staff</span> conditions</span>.<br/>
🎧 Not only did the level</span> of complaints</span> fall</span>,<br/>
🎧 but they also noticed</span> a significant</span> increase</span> in the amount each customer</span> spent</span> during their stay</span>.<br/>
🎧 They have now introduced</span> a customer</span> loyalty</span> scheme<br/></span>
🎧 which is going really well.<br/>
🎧 Now I'd like to look at some ways</span> you can reduce</span> staff</span> turnover</span> in your hotels</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I'll do this by giving</span> some examples</span> of hotels</span> where I've done some training</span> recently</span>.<br/>
🎧 The Sun Club</span> received</span> feedback</span> which showed</span> that staff</span> thought managers</span> didn't value</span> their opinions</span>.<br/>
🎧 They weren't made to feel they were partners</span> who were contributing</span> to the success of the business</span> as a whole.<br/>
🎧 This situation</span> has changed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Junior</span> staff</span> at all levels</span> are regularly</span> invited</span> to meetings</span> where their ideas</span> are welcomed</span>.<br/>
🎧 A year ago, The Portland</span> recognised</span> the need to invest</span> in staff</span> retention</span>.<br/>
🎧 Their first step</span> was to introduce</span> a scheme</span> for recognising</span> talent</span> amongst</span> their employees</span>.<br/>
🎧 The hope is that organising</span> training</span> for individuals</span> with management</span> potential</span> will encourage</span> them to stay</span> with the business</span>.<br/>
🎧 At Bluewater</span>, managers</span> decided</span> to recognise</span> 50</span> high achievers</span> from across the company's</span> huge</span> hotel</span> chain</span>.<br/>
🎧 As a reward</span>, they're sent</span> on an all-expenses-paid</span> trip</span> abroad</span> every year.<br/>
🎧 Fun is an important element</span> in the trips</span>,<br/>
🎧 but there's also the opportunity</span> to learn something useful</span>.<br/>
🎧 This year's</span> trip</span> included</span> a visit to a brewery</span>,<br/>
🎧 where staff</span> learned</span> about the new beer</span> that would be served</span> in the hotel</span>.<br/>
🎧 Pentlow</span> Hotels</span> identified</span> that retention</span> of junior</span> reception</span> staff</span> was an issue.<br/>
🎧 In order to encourage</span> them to see that working in a hotel</span> could be worthwhile</span> and rewarding</span>, with good prospects</span>,<br/>
🎧 they introduced</span> a management</span> programme</span>.<br/>
🎧 These staff</span> were given</span> additional</span> responsibilities</span> and the chance</span> to work in various</span> roles</span> in the hotel</span>.<br/>
🎧 Green</span> Planets</span> wanted to be seen</span> as a caring</span> employer</span>.<br/>
🎧 To make life easier</span> for staff</span>, many of whom had childcare</span> responsibilities</span>,<br/>
🎧 the hotel</span> began</span> issuing</span> vouchers</span> to help cover</span> the cost</span> of childcare</span>.<br/>
🎧 Louise</span> Marsh</span> at The Amesbury</span> has one of the best staff</span> retention</span> rates</span> in the business</span>.<br/>
🎧 Since she joined</span> the company,<br/>
🎧 she's made a huge</span> effort</span> to achieve</span> this by creating</span> a co-operative</span> and supportive</span> environment</span>.<br/>
🎧 For her, the staff</span> are part</span> of a large family</span> where everyone is valued</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, now I'd like to..</span>.<br/>

🎧 Hi Thomas</span>, how are you enjoying</span> the course so far</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I think it's good.<br/>
🎧 Remind</span> me, why did you decide to study</span> sports</span> science</span>?<br/>
🎧 Didn't you want to be a professional</span> athlete</span> when you were at school?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, that was my goal</span>,<br/>
🎧 and all my classmates</span> assumed</span> I would achieve</span> it;</span> they thought I was brilliant</span>.<br/>
🎧 That must have been a nice feeling.<br/>
🎧 Mm</span>, I thought I could win anything.<br/>
🎧 There was no one who could run faster</span> than me.<br/>
🎧 Exactly, so what happened</span>?<br/>
🎧 Did your mum</span> and dad want you to be more 'academic'</span>?<br/>
🎧 Not at all.<br/>
🎧 Perhaps</span> they should have pushed</span> me harder</span>, though.<br/>
🎧 What do you mean?<br/>
🎧 I think I should have practised</span> more.<br/>
🎧 What makes you say that?<br/>
🎧 Well, I went out to Kenya</span> for a couple</span> of weeks</span> to train..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Really! I didn't know that.<br/>
🎧 I was chosen</span> to go there out of loads</span> of kids</span> and run with some of the top teenage</span> athletes</span> in the world</span>.<br/>
🎧 And..</span>. I was so calm</span> about it.<br/>
🎧 I just kept</span> thinking how fortunate</span> I was.<br/>
🎧 What a great chance</span> this was!<br/>
🎧 Everyone back home was so proud</span> of me.<br/>
🎧 But once we started</span> competing</span>, I very quickly realised</span> I wasn't good enough.<br/>
🎧 That must have been a huge</span> shock</span>.<br/>
🎧 I thought 'this</span> can't be happening'</span>!<br/>
🎧 I was used to winning</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm sorry to hear that.<br/>
🎧 It's OK.<br/>
🎧 I'm over it now<br/></span>
🎧 and I think it's much better to do a university course<br/></span>
🎧 and this one has such a variety</span> of sports-related</span> areas</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's going to be good.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I agree, I chose</span> it because of that.<br/>
🎧 So Jeanne</span>, have you thought of any ideas</span> for the discussion</span> session</span> next week on technology</span> and sport</span>?<br/>
🎧 We have to cover</span> more than one sport</span>, don't we?<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 You know, we always think technology</span> is about the future,<br/>
🎧 but we could gather</span> some ideas</span> about past</span> developments</span> in sport</span>.<br/>
🎧 Look at early</span> types</span> of equipment</span> perhaps</span>?<br/>
🎧 I remember reading</span> something about table</span> tennis</span> bats</span> once,<br/>
🎧 how they ended</span> up being covered</span> with pimpled</span> rubber</span>.<br/>
🎧 Cos</span> they were just wooden</span> at first, I'd imagine</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 In about the 1920s</span>,<br/>
🎧 a factory</span> was making</span> rolls</span> of the rubber</span> in bulk</span> for something like horse</span> harnesses</span>.<br/>
🎧 Really!<br/>
🎧 Yeah, and someone</span> realised</span> that it would make a perfect covering</span> for the wooden</span> bats</span>.<br/>
🎧 So what about cricket</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's had a few innovative</span> changes.<br/>
🎧 Maybe the pads</span> they wear</span> on their legs</span>?<br/>
🎧 I don't think they've</span> changed</span> much but, I'm just looking on the internet..</span>.<br/>
🎧 and it says that when the first cricket</span> helmet</span> came in, in 1978</span>,<br/>
🎧 the Australian</span> batsman</span> who first wore</span> it was booed</span> and jeered</span> by people watching because it was so ugly</span>!<br/>
🎧 Wow, players</span> have to protect</span> themselves</span> from getting hurt</span>!<br/>
🎧 I mean everyone wears</span> one now.<br/>
🎧 Mm</span>, unlike</span> the cycle</span> helmet</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, unless</span> you're a professional</span>,<br/>
🎧 but you're right, many ordinary</span> bikers</span> don't wear</span> a helmet</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hey, look at these pictures</span> of original</span> helmet</span> designs</span>.<br/>
🎧 This one looks like an upside-down</span> bowl</span>!<br/>
🎧 Yet, the woman's</span> laughing</span>,<br/>
🎧 she's so proud</span> to be wearing</span> it!<br/>
🎧 It says serious cyclists</span> ended</span> up with wet hair</span> from all the hard</span> exercise</span>.<br/>
🎧 I guess</span> that's why they have large air vents</span> in them now<br/></span>
🎧 so that the skin</span> can breathe</span> more easily</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, so we've done helmets</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about golf</span> balls</span> or better still golf</span> clubs</span>,<br/>
🎧 they've</span> changed</span> a lot.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I remember my great grandfather</span> telling</span> me that because a club</span> was made entirely</span> of wood</span>,<br/>
🎧 it would easily</span> break</span> and players</span> had to get another.<br/>
🎧 There's no wood</span> at all in them now, is there?<br/>
🎧 No, they're much more powerful</span>.<br/>
🎧 The same must be true</span> of hockey</span> sticks</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't think so because players</span> still use wooden</span> sticks</span> today.<br/>
🎧 What it does say here, though,<br/>
🎧 is that when the game started</span> you had to produce</span> a stick</span> yourself.<br/>
🎧 I guess</span> they just weren't being manufactured</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, one more perhaps</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about football</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I know the first balls</span> were made of animal</span> skin</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, they covered</span> them with pieces</span> of leather</span> that were stitched</span> together,<br/>
🎧 but..</span>. the balls</span> let in water when it rained</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that would have made them much heavier</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 You can imagine</span> the damage</span> to player's</span> necks</span> when the ball</span> was headed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, how painful</span> that must have been!<br/>
🎧 Yeah, well, I think we can put together some useful</span> ideas..</span>.<br/>

🎧 Hello everyone.<br/>
🎧 Today we're going to look at another natural</span> food product<br/></span>
🎧 and that's maple</span> syrup</span>.<br/>
🎧 What is this exactly?<br/>
🎧 Well, maple</span> syrup</span> looks rather like clear</span> honey</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it's not made by bees;<br/></span>
🎧 it's produced</span> from the plant</span> fluid</span>, or sap</span>, inside the maple</span> tree<br/></span>
🎧 and that makes maple</span> syrup</span> a very natural</span> product.<br/>
🎧 Maple</span> syrup</span> is a thick</span>, golden</span>, sweet-tasting</span> liquid<br/></span>
🎧 that can be bought</span> in bottles</span> or jars<br/></span>
🎧 and poured</span> onto</span> food such as waffles</span> and ice cream<br/></span>
🎧 or used in the baking</span> of cakes</span> and pastries</span>.<br/>
🎧 It contains</span> no preservatives</span> or added</span> ingredients</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it provides</span> a healthy</span> alternative</span> to refined</span> sugar</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's just talk a bit about the maple</span> tree</span> itself</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is where maple</span> syrup</span> comes from.<br/>
🎧 So, there are many species</span> of maple</span> tree</span>,<br/>
🎧 and they'll grow</span> without fertilizer</span> in areas</span> where there's plenty</span> of moisture</span> in the soil</span>.<br/>
🎧 However</span>, they'll only do this if another important criterion</span> is fulfilled</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is that they must have full or partial</span> sun exposure</span> during the day and very cool</span> nights</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I'll talk more about that in a minute</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are only certain</span> parts</span> of the world</span> that provide</span> all these conditions</span>:<br/>
🎧 one is Canada</span>,<br/>
🎧 and by that, I mean all parts</span> of Canada</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the other is the north-eastern</span> states</span> of North</span> America</span>.<br/>
🎧 In these areas</span>, the climate</span> suits</span> the trees</span> perfectly</span>.<br/>
🎧 In fact</span>, Canada</span> produces</span> over two-thirds</span> of the world's</span> maple</span> syrup</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is why the five-pointed</span> maple</span> leaf</span> is a Canadian</span> symbol<br/></span>
🎧 and has featured</span> on the flag</span> since 1964</span>.<br/>
🎧 So how did maple</span> syrup</span> production</span> begin</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, long before Europeans</span> settled</span> in these parts</span> of the world</span>,<br/>
🎧 the indigenous</span> communities</span> had started</span> producing</span> maple</span> sugar</span>.<br/>
🎧 They bored</span> holes</span> in the trunks</span> of maple</span> trees<br/></span>
🎧 and used containers</span> made of tree</span> bark</span> to collect</span> the liquid</span> sap</span> as it poured</span> out.<br/>
🎧 As they were unable</span> to keep the liquid</span> for any length</span> of time,<br/>
🎧 they didn't have storage</span> facilities</span> in those days</span>,<br/>
🎧 they boiled</span> the liquid</span> by placing</span> pieces</span> of rock</span> that had become scorching</span> hot from the sun into the sap</span>.<br/>
🎧 They did this until it turned</span> into sugar</span>,<br/>
🎧 and they were then able to use this to sweeten</span> their food and drinks</span>.<br/>
🎧 Since that time, improvements</span> have been made to the process</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it has changed</span> very little overall</span>.<br/>
🎧 So let's look at the production</span> of maple</span> syrup</span> today.<br/>
🎧 Clearly</span>, the maple</span> forests</span> are a valuable</span> resource</span> in many Canadian</span> and North</span> American</span> communities</span>.<br/>
🎧 The trees</span> have to be well looked</span> after<br/></span>
🎧 and they cannot</span> be used to make syrup</span> until the trunks</span> reach</span> a diameter</span> of around 25</span> centimetres</span>.<br/>
🎧 This can take anything up to 40</span> years.<br/>
🎧 As I've already mentioned</span>,<br/>
🎧 maple</span> trees</span> need the right conditions</span> to grow</span> and also to produce</span> sap</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why is this?<br/>
🎧 Well, what happens</span> is that during a cold</span> night</span>,<br/>
🎧 the tree</span> absorbs</span> water from the soil</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that rises</span> through the tree's</span> vascular</span> system</span>.<br/>
🎧 But then in the warmer</span> daytime</span>,<br/>
🎧 the change in temperature</span> causes</span> the water to be pushed</span> back down to the bottom</span> of the tree</span>.<br/>
🎧 This continual</span> movement</span>, up and down,<br/>
🎧 leads</span> to the formation</span> of the sap</span> needed</span> for maple</span> syrup</span> production</span>.<br/>
🎧 When the tree</span> is ready,<br/>
🎧 it can be tapped</span> and this involves</span> drilling</span> a small hole</span> into the trunk<br/></span>
🎧 and inserting</span> a tube</span> into it that ends</span> in a bucket</span>.<br/>
🎧 The trees</span> can often take several</span> taps</span>,<br/>
🎧 though the workers</span> take care</span> not to cause</span> any damage</span> to the healthy</span> growth</span> of the tree</span> itself</span>.<br/>
🎧 The sap</span> that comes out of the trees</span> consists</span> of 98%</span> water<br/></span>
🎧 and 2%</span> sugar</span> and other nutrients</span>.<br/>
🎧 It has to be boiled</span> so that much of that water evaporates</span>,<br/>
🎧 and this process</span> has to take place immediately</span>, using</span> what are called evaporators</span>.<br/>
🎧 These are basically</span> extremely</span> large pans</span>,<br/>
🎧 the sap</span> is poured</span> into these,<br/>
🎧 a fire</span> is built</span> and the pans</span> are then heated</span> until the sap</span> boils</span>.<br/>
🎧 As it does this, the water evaporates</span>, and the syrup</span> begins</span> to form</span>.<br/>
🎧 The evaporation</span> process</span> creates</span> large quantities</span> of steam</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the sap</span> becomes</span> thicker</span> and denser</span>, and, at just the right moment</span>,<br/>
🎧 when the sap</span> is thick</span> enough to be called maple</span> syrup</span>,<br/>
🎧 the worker</span> removes</span> it from the heat</span>.<br/>
🎧 After this process</span>, something called 'sugar</span> sand'</span> has to be filtered</span> out<br/></span>
🎧 as this builds</span> up during the boiling</span> and gives</span> the syrup</span> a cloudy</span> appearance</span> and a slightly</span> gritty</span> taste</span>.<br/>
🎧 Once this has been done,<br/>
🎧 the syrup</span> is ready to be packaged</span> so that it can be used for a whole variety</span> of products</span>.<br/>
🎧 It takes 40</span> litres</span> of sap</span> to produce</span> one litre</span> of maple</span> syrup<br/></span>
🎧 so you can get an idea of how much is needed</span>!<br/>
🎧 So that's the basic</span> process..</span>.<br/>
