🎧 <span>Greek</span> <span>Island</span> <span>Holidays</span>, can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I hope so.<br/>
🎧 I have a friend who's just come back from <span>Corfu<br/></span>
🎧 and she's <span>recommended</span> some <span>apartments</span> in <span>Arilas</span>.<br/>
🎧 She thought they might be on your <span>list</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Arilas</span>, <span>Arilas..</span>. let me see.<br/>
🎧 Can you give me the <span>names</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, the <span>first's</span> <span>Rose</span> Garden <span>Apartments</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to go with another friend in the last week of <span>October</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, we've got a <span>lovely</span> <span>studio</span> <span>flat</span> <span>available</span> at that time.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you'd enjoy the <span>entertainment</span> <span>programme</span> there too,<br/>
🎧 with <span>Greek</span> <span>dancing</span> in the <span>restaurant</span>.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>cost</span> for each of us?<br/>
🎧 <span>£219</span>.<br/>
🎧 That sounds very <span>reasonable</span>!<br/>
🎧 I'm just <span>jotting</span> down some <span>notes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now the second one she <span>mentioned</span> was called <span>Blue</span> <span>Bay</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Blue</span> <span>Bay</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, in <span>fact</span> that's very <span>popular</span> and it has some special <span>features</span>.<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 The <span>main</span> <span>attraction</span> is the large <span>swimming</span> <span>pool</span> with <span>salt</span> water.<br/>
🎧 Much <span>healthier</span>, I <span>understand</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 And it isn't <span>far</span> from the <span>beach</span>, either <span>-</span> only <span>300</span> <span>metres</span>,<br/>
🎧 and only around <span>half</span> a <span>kilometre</span> to some <span>shops</span>,<br/>
🎧 so you don't have to be too <span>energetic</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is it much more <span>expensive</span> than the first one?<br/>
🎧 Let me just check.<br/>
🎧 I think at the time you want to go it's around <span>£260<br/></span>
🎧 No, <span>£275</span> to be <span>exact</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, I've got that.<br/>
🎧 Now there are just two more <span>apartments</span> to ask you about.<br/>
🎧 <span>Um</span>, I can't read my own <span>writing</span>!<br/>
🎧 Something to do with <span>sun..</span>. <span>Sunshine</span>, is it?<br/>
🎧 I think you <span>meant</span> the <span>Sunshade</span> <span>Apartments</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're on a <span>mountainside</span>.<br/>
🎧 Any special <span>features</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, each room has its own sun <span>terrace<br/></span>
🎧 and there are <span>shared</span> <span>barbecue</span> <span>facilities</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, sounds <span>lovely</span>!<br/>
🎧 Yes, it is rather <span>well-equipped</span>.<br/>
🎧 It also <span>provides</span> water <span>sports</span>, it has its own <span>beach</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>facilities</span> for <span>water-skiing</span>.<br/>
🎧 Any <span>kite-surfing</span>? My <span>friend's</span> quite <span>keen</span>.<br/>
🎧 Not at the <span>hotel</span> but I'm sure you'll find some in <span>Arilas</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's also <span>satellite</span> <span>TV</span> in the <span>apartments</span>.<br/>
🎧 And how much is that one?<br/>
🎧 <span>£490</span> with two <span>sharing</span>.<br/>
🎧 You mean <span>£245</span> each?<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>afraid</span> not!<br/>
🎧 Each person has to pay that amount and there must be at <span>least</span> two in an <span>apartment</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't think that would be <span>within</span> our <span>budget</span>, <span>unfortunately</span>.<br/>
🎧 And the last one sounds a bit <span>expensive</span> too <span>-</span> the <span>Grand</span>!<br/>
🎧 Actually it's quite <span>reasonable</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's an <span>older</span> <span>style</span> house with <span>Greek</span> <span>paintings</span> in every room, and a <span>balcony</span> outside.<br/>
🎧 Sounds nice. What are the <span>views</span> like?<br/>
🎧 Well, there are <span>forests</span> all <span>round</span> and they <span>hide</span> a <span>supermarket</span> just down the <span>road</span>,<br/>
🎧 so that's very <span>useful</span> for all your <span>shopping</span> needs.<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>disco</span> in the <span>area</span> too.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>price</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>£319</span> at that time,<br/>
🎧 but if you leave it <span>till</span> <span>November</span> it <span>goes</span> down by <span>40%</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm..</span>. Too <span>late</span>, I'm <span>afraid</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, why don't i <span>send</span> you a <span>brochure</span> with full <span>details</span>, <span>Ms...</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Nash</span>.<br/>
🎧 But don't <span>worry</span> about that.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>coming</span> to <span>Upminster</span> soon and I'll call and get one.<br/>
🎧 I just wanted to get an idea first.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's fine.<br/>
🎧 <span>Uhh..</span>. We've got <span>plenty</span> here when you come.<br/>
🎧 If you've got a <span>minute</span>, could I just check a <span>couple</span> of <span>points</span> about <span>insurance</span>?<br/>
🎧 I got one <span>policy</span> through the <span>post</span> but I'd like to see if <span>yours</span> is better.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 What would you like to know?<br/>
🎧 Well, the one I've got has <span>benefits</span> and then the <span>maximum</span> amount you can <span>claim</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is that like <span>yours</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's how most of them are.<br/>
🎧 Well, the first thing is <span>cancellation</span>.<br/>
🎧 If the <span>holiday's</span> <span>cancelled</span> on the <span>policy</span> I've got, you can <span>claim</span> <span>£8,000</span>.<br/>
🎧 We can <span>improve</span> on that, Ms <span>Nash</span>.<br/>
🎧 For <span>Greek</span> <span>Island</span> <span>holidays</span>, our <span>maximum</span> is <span>£10,000</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's good <span>-</span> of course our <span>holiday</span> won't even <span>cost</span> <span>£1,000</span> together!<br/>
🎧 It's still <span>sensible</span> to have good <span>cover</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, if you go to <span>hospital</span>, we <span>allow</span> <span>£600</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, <span>mine's</span> <span>similar</span>.<br/>
🎧 And we also <span>allow</span> a <span>relative</span> to travel to your <span>holiday</span> <span>resort</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>policy</span> just says their <span>representative</span> will help you.<br/>
🎧 You can see there's another <span>difference</span> there.<br/>
🎧 And what <span>happens</span> if you don't get on the <span>plane</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Nothing</span>, as <span>far</span> as I can see on this <span>form</span>.<br/>
🎧 Don't you have <span>missed</span> <span>departure</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, I'll just <span>jot</span> that down.<br/>
🎧 We pay up to <span>£1,000</span> for that, <span>depending</span> on the <span>reason</span>.<br/>
🎧 And we're <span>particularly</span> <span>generous</span> about <span>loss</span> of personal <span>belongings</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 up to <span>£3,000</span>, but not more than <span>£500</span> for a <span>single</span> <span>item</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then I'd better not take my <span>laptop</span>!<br/>
🎧 Not <span>unless</span> you <span>insure</span> it <span>separately</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, thanks very much for your time, you've really been <span>helpful</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can I get back to you? Your name is?<br/>
🎧 <span>Ben</span> <span>Ludlow</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>LUDLOW</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm the <span>Assistant</span> <span>Manager</span> here.<br/>
🎧 I'll give you my number.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>081260543216</span>.<br/>
🎧 But didn't I phone <span>081260567294</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's what I've got on the <span>paper</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's the <span>main</span> <span>switchboard</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've <span>given</span> you my <span>direct</span> <span>line</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, thank you very much for your time.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 For the second in our <span>series</span> about <span>locally-run</span> <span>businesses</span>, we meet <span>Simon</span> <span>Winridge</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>co-founder</span> of the <span>hugely-successful</span> <span>Winridge</span> <span>Forest</span> <span>Railway</span> <span>Park</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Welcome</span>, <span>Simon</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, <span>perhaps</span> you can <span>begin</span> by <span>telling</span> us a little bit about how it all <span>started</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, during the <span>1970s</span>, my <span>wife</span>, <span>Liz</span> and I had just <span>acquired</span> <span>80</span> <span>acres</span> of <span>sheep-farming</span> <span>land</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we <span>decided</span> to <span>settle</span> down and have children.<br/>
🎧 <span>Pretty</span> soon we had a <span>daughter</span>, <span>Sarah</span>, and a son, <span>Duncan</span>.<br/>
🎧 The place was wonderful for the <span>kids:<br/></span>
🎧 they <span>particularly</span> loved <span>trains</span> and <span>gradually</span> <span>built</span> up an <span>enormous</span> <span>network</span> of <span>miniature</span> <span>railway</span> <span>track</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>began</span> to <span>develop</span> <span>larger-scale</span> <span>models</span> of <span>locomotives<br/></span>
🎧 but we didn't think anything more of it until I went on a <span>trip</span> to a <span>theme</span> <span>park</span> near <span>Birmingham<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>decided</span> we could do a much better <span>job</span>!<br/>
🎧 So we set up a small one <span>ourselves</span> <span>based</span> on the <span>miniature</span> <span>railway<br/></span>
🎧 and we <span>opened</span> to the <span>public</span> for just a month that year, <span>1984</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 in <span>July</span> <span>-</span> our <span>driest</span> month <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 because our children said they didn't want our <span>guests</span> to have a <span>miserable</span>, wet visit.<br/>
🎧 I <span>dealt</span> with <span>park</span> <span>business</span> and <span>Liz</span> <span>carried</span> on with the <span>farm</span> work.<br/>
🎧 It soon <span>became</span> <span>clear</span> that we were <span>onto</span> a <span>winner</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>began</span> to <span>extend</span> the <span>railway</span> <span>track</span> and lay it <span>among</span> more <span>interesting</span> <span>landscape</span> by <span>planting</span> <span>trees</span>,<br/>
🎧 which in <span>turn</span> <span>attracted</span> more <span>wildlife</span>,<br/>
🎧 and by <span>making</span> <span>cuttings</span> through the <span>rock</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Nowadays</span>, we're open all year <span>round<br/></span>
🎧 and we're <span>pleased</span> to say that <span>Winridge</span> is one of the most <span>popular</span> <span>visitor</span> <span>attractions</span> in the <span>area</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 with <span>50,000</span> <span>visitors</span> a year <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 a <span>million</span> and a <span>half</span> people have been through our <span>doors</span> since we <span>opened</span>.<br/>
🎧 All these <span>visitors</span> mean we have had to <span>expand</span> our <span>operation<br/></span>
🎧 and it's now a <span>truly</span> <span>family</span> <span>concern</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm near to <span>retirement</span> age <span>so..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I only <span>concern</span> myself with looking after the <span>mechanical</span> side of things <span>-</span> <span>keeping</span> the <span>trains</span> going.<br/>
🎧 <span>Liz</span> now <span>devotes</span> all her <span>energies</span> to <span>recruiting</span> and <span>supporting</span> the large <span>squadron</span> of <span>workers</span>,<br/>
🎧 which keep the place <span>running</span> <span>smoothly</span>.<br/>
🎧 We're really <span>pleased</span> that after some years away <span>teaching</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>Sarah</span> has now <span>returned</span> to the <span>park</span> and makes sure the <span>visitors</span> are <span>kept</span> <span>fed</span> and <span>watered</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>keeps</span> her <span>pretty</span> <span>busy</span> as you can <span>imagine</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our son, <span>Duncan</span>, has been a <span>stalwart</span> of the <span>park</span> for the last ten years,<br/>
🎧 taking over from me in the <span>area</span> of <span>construction</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and I'll say a little bit more about that in a <span>moment</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and his new <span>wife</span> <span>-</span> <span>Judith</span>, has also <span>joined</span> the <span>team</span> in <span>charge</span> of <span>retail</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>becoming</span> a <span>tremendous</span> <span>growth</span> <span>area</span> for us <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 a lot of people want to buy <span>souvenirs</span>.<br/>
🎧 So have you <span>finished</span> your <span>development</span> of the <span>site</span> for the <span>moment</span>?<br/>
🎧 Not at all!<br/>
🎧 We're <span>constantly</span> looking for <span>ways</span> to <span>offer</span> more to our <span>visitors</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>railway</span> <span>remains</span> the <span>central</span> <span>feature<br/></span>
🎧 and there's now <span>1.2</span> <span>kilometres</span> of the <span>line</span> <span>laid</span> but we'd like to lay more.<br/>
🎧 Because of the <span>geology</span> of the <span>area</span>, our <span>greatest</span> <span>problem</span> is <span>digging</span> <span>tunnels</span>.<br/>
🎧 But we're <span>gradually</span> <span>overcoming</span> that.<br/>
🎧 We're also very <span>pleased</span> with a new <span>installation</span> of the <span>Go-Kart</span> <span>arena<br/></span>
🎧 which is <span>120</span> <span>square</span> <span>metres</span> in <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 Again the <span>problem</span> is the <span>geology;<br/></span>
🎧 we had to <span>level</span> the <span>mounds</span> on the <span>track</span> for <span>safety</span> <span>reasons</span>.<br/>
🎧 We wanted to <span>enable</span> <span>5</span> to <span>12</span> year <span>olds</span> to use the <span>go-karts</span>.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>main</span> <span>attraction</span> here is the <span>Formula</span> <span>1</span> <span>Kart</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've <span>known</span> <span>fights</span> to <span>break</span> out over who <span>gets</span> it!<br/>
🎧 And then, finally, to our most <span>recent..</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Ah <span>Caroline..</span>. come on in. Sit down.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 So how's the <span>dissertation</span> planning going?<br/>
🎧 Well <span>Dr</span> <span>Schulmann</span>, I'm still having a lot of <span>trouble</span> <span>deciding</span> on a <span>title</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's <span>perfectly</span> <span>normal</span> at this <span>stage</span>.<br/>
🎧 And this is what your <span>tutorials</span> will help you to do.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 What we'll do is <span>jot</span> down some <span>points</span> that might help you in your <span>decision</span>.<br/>
🎧 First of all, you have <span>chosen</span> your <span>general</span> <span>topic</span> <span>area</span>, haven't you?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's the <span>fishing</span> <span>industry</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, that was one of the <span>areas</span> you <span>mentioned</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, what <span>aspects</span> of the course are you good at?<br/>
🎧 Well, I think I'm <span>coping</span> well with <span>statistics</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I'm never <span>bored</span> by it.<br/>
🎧 Good. Anything else?<br/>
🎧 Well, I <span>found</span> <span>computer</span> <span>modelling</span> <span>fascinating</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 I have no <span>problem</span> <span>following</span> what's being <span>taught</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>whereas</span> quite a few of my <span>classmates</span> find it <span>difficult</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's very good.<br/>
🎧 Do you think these might be <span>areas</span> you could <span>bring</span> into your <span>dissertation</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, if <span>possible</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's just that I'm having <span>difficulty</span> thinking how I can do that.<br/>
🎧 You see, I feel I don't have <span>sufficient</span> <span>background</span> <span>information</span>.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 Well, do you take <span>notes</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm very <span>weak</span> at <span>note-taking</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>teachers</span> always used to say that.<br/>
🎧 Well, I think you really need to work on these <span>weaknesses</span> before you go any <span>further</span>.<br/>
🎧 What do you <span>suggest</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I can go through the <span>possible</span> <span>strategies</span> with you and let you decide where to go from there.<br/>
🎧 Okay, thanks.<br/>
🎧 Well, some people find it <span>helpful</span> to <span>organise</span> <span>peer-group</span> <span>discussions</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 you know, each week a different person <span>studies</span> a different <span>topic</span> and <span>shares</span> it with the group.<br/>
🎧 Oh right.<br/>
🎧 It really helps <span>build</span> <span>confidence</span>, you know, having to <span>present</span> something to <span>others</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can see that.<br/>
🎧 The <span>drawback</span> is that everyone in the group <span>seems</span> to share the same <span>ideas..</span>.<br/>
🎧 they keep being <span>repeated</span> in all the <span>dissertations</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 You could also try a <span>service</span> called <span>'Student</span> <span>Support'</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>designed</span> to give you a <span>structured</span> <span>programme</span> over a number of <span>weeks</span> to <span>develop</span> your <span>skills</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sounds good.<br/>
🎧 Yes, <span>unfortunately</span> there are only a few <span>places</span>.<br/>
🎧 But it's <span>worth</span> looking into.<br/>
🎧 Yes, of course.<br/>
🎧 I know I've got to work on my <span>study</span> <span>skills</span>.<br/>
🎧 And then there are <span>several</span> <span>study</span> <span>skills</span> books you can <span>consult</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 They'll be a good <span>source</span> of <span>reference<br/></span>
🎧 but the <span>problem</span> is they are sometimes too <span>general</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's what I've <span>found</span>.<br/>
🎧 Other than that, I would <span>strongly</span> <span>advise</span> quite simple <span>ideas</span> like <span>using</span> a <span>card</span> <span>index</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, yes, I've never done that before.<br/>
🎧 It's simple, but it really <span>works</span> because you have to get <span>points</span> down in a small <span>space</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another thing I always <span>advise</span> is don't just take your <span>notes</span> and <span>forget</span> about them.<br/>
🎧 Read everything <span>three</span> <span>times</span> <span>-</span> <span>that'll</span> really fix them in your <span>mind</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I can see it'd take <span>discipline</span> <span>but..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, if you <span>establish</span> good <span>study</span> <span>skills</span> at this <span>stage</span>, they'll be with you all your life.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes. I <span>completely</span> agree.<br/>
🎧 It's just that I don't <span>seem</span> to be able to <span>discipline</span> myself.<br/>
🎧 I need to talk things over.<br/>
🎧 Well, we'll be <span>continuing</span> these <span>tutorials</span> of course.<br/>
🎧 Let's <span>arrange</span> next <span>month's</span> now. Let's <span>see..</span>.<br/>

🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 In the last few <span>lectures</span>, I've been talking about the <span>history</span> of <span>domestic</span> <span>building</span> <span>construction</span>.<br/>
🎧 But today I want to <span>begin</span> looking at some <span>contemporary</span>, <span>experimental</span> <span>designs</span> for <span>housing</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, I'm going to start with a house which is <span>constructed</span> more or less under the <span>ground</span>.<br/>
🎧 And one of the <span>interesting</span> things about this <span>project</span> <span>is..</span>.<br/>
🎧 that the <span>owners</span> <span>-</span> both <span>professionals</span> but not <span>architects</span> <span>-</span> wanted to be <span>closely</span> <span>involved</span>,<br/>
🎧 so they <span>decided</span> to <span>manage</span> the <span>project</span> <span>themselves</span>.<br/>
🎧 Their <span>chief</span> <span>aim</span> was to <span>create</span> somewhere that was as <span>environmentally-friendly</span> as <span>possible</span>.<br/>
🎧 But at the same time they wanted to live somewhere <span>peaceful</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 they'd both <span>grown</span> up in a <span>rural</span> <span>area</span> and <span>disliked</span> <span>urban</span> life.<br/>
🎧 So the first thing they did was to look for a <span>site</span>.<br/>
🎧 And they <span>found</span> a <span>disused</span> <span>stone</span> <span>quarry</span> in a <span>beautiful</span> <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>price</span> was <span>relatively</span> low,<br/>
🎧 and they <span>liked</span> the idea of <span>recycling</span> the <span>land</span>, as it were.<br/>
🎧 As it was, the <span>quarry</span> was an <span>ugly</span> <span>blot</span> on the <span>landscape</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it wasn't <span>productive</span> any <span>longer</span>, either.<br/>
🎧 They <span>consulted</span> <span>various</span> <span>architects<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>looked</span> at a number of <span>designs</span> before finally <span>deciding</span> on one.<br/>
🎧 As I've said,<br/>
🎧 it was a <span>design</span> for a <span>sort</span> of <span>underground</span> house,<br/>
🎧 and it was <span>built</span> into the <span>earth</span> <span>itself</span>, with two <span>storeys</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>north</span>, <span>east</span> and <span>west</span> <span>sides</span> were set in the <span>earth</span>,<br/>
🎧 and only the <span>sloping</span>, <span>south-facing</span> side was <span>exposed</span> to the <span>light</span>.<br/>
🎧 That was made of a <span>double</span> <span>layer</span> of very <span>strong</span> <span>glass</span>.<br/>
🎧 There were also <span>photovoltaic</span> <span>tiles</span> <span>fixed</span> to the top and <span>bottom</span> of this <span>sloping</span> <span>wall</span>.<br/>
🎧 These are <span>tiles</span> that are <span>designed</span> to <span>store</span> <span>energy</span> from the sun.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>walls</span> had a <span>layer</span> of <span>foam</span> around them too, to <span>increase</span> the <span>insulation</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, what is of <span>interest</span> to us about this <span>project<br/></span>
🎧 is the <span>features</span> which make the <span>building</span> <span>energy-efficient</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sunlight</span> <span>floods</span> in through the <span>glass</span> <span>wall</span>,<br/>
🎧 and to <span>maximise</span> it, there are lots of <span>mirrors</span> and <span>windows</span> inside the house.<br/>
🎧 That helps to <span>spread</span> the <span>light</span> around.<br/>
🎧 So that's the first thing <span>-</span> <span>light</span> is <span>utilised</span> as <span>fully</span> as <span>possible</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>addition</span>, the special <span>tiles</span> on the outside <span>convert</span> <span>energy</span> from the <span>sun<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>generate</span> some of the <span>house's</span> <span>electricity</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, and it's <span>possible</span> that in future the house may even <span>generate</span> an <span>electricity</span> <span>surplus</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that the <span>owners</span> will be able to sell some to the <span>national</span> <span>grid</span>.<br/>
🎧 As well as that, <span>wherever</span> <span>possible</span>, <span>recycled</span> <span>materials</span> have been used.<br/>
🎧 For example, the <span>floors</span> are made of <span>reclaimed</span> <span>wood</span>.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>owners</span> haven't <span>bought</span> a <span>single</span> <span>item</span> of new <span>furniture</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 they just <span>kept</span> what they already had.<br/>
🎧 And then there's the <span>system</span> for <span>dealing</span> with the <span>waste</span> <span>produced</span> in the house.<br/>
🎧 This is <span>dealt</span> with <span>organically</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it's <span>purified</span> by being <span>filtered</span> through <span>reed</span> <span>beds<br/></span>
🎧 which have been <span>planted</span> for that <span>purpose</span> in the garden.<br/>
🎧 So the <span>occupants</span> of the house won't <span>pollute</span> the <span>land</span> or use any <span>damaging</span> <span>chemicals</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>true</span> that the <span>actual</span> <span>construction</span> of the house was <span>harmful</span> to the <span>environment</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>mainly</span> because they had to use <span>massive</span> <span>amounts</span> of <span>concrete</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 one of the <span>biggest</span> <span>sources</span> of <span>carbon</span> <span>dioxide</span> in <span>manufacturing</span>.<br/>
🎧 And, as you know, this is very <span>damaging</span> to the <span>environment</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>total</span>, the house <span>construction</span> has <span>released</span> <span>70</span> <span>tons</span> of <span>carbon</span> <span>dioxide</span> into the air.<br/>
🎧 Now that's a <span>frightening</span> thought.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, once the <span>initial</span> <span>'debt'</span> has been <span>cleared</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and it's been <span>calculated</span> that this will only take <span>fifteen</span> years <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 this <span>underground</span> house won't <span>cost</span> anything <span>-</span> <span>environmentally</span> I mean <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 because <span>unlike</span> <span>ordinary</span> <span>houses</span>,<br/>
🎧 it is run in a way that is <span>completely</span> <span>environmentally</span> <span>friendly</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, <span>eco-housing</span> like this is <span>likely</span> to <span>become..</span>.<br/>
