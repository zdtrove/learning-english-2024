🎧 Greek Island Holidays, can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I hope so.<br/>
🎧 I have a friend who's just come back from Corfu<br/>
🎧 and she's recommended some apartments in Arilas.<br/>
🎧 She thought they might be on your list.<br/>
🎧 Arilas, Arilas... let me see.<br/>
🎧 Can you give me the names?<br/>
🎧 Yes, the first's Rose Garden Apartments.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to go with another friend in the last week of October.<br/>
🎧 Well, we've got a lovely studio flat available at that time.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you'd enjoy the entertainment programme there too,<br/>
🎧 with Greek dancing in the restaurant.<br/>
🎧 And the cost for each of us?<br/>
🎧 £219.<br/>
🎧 That sounds very reasonable!<br/>
🎧 I'm just jotting down some notes.<br/>
🎧 Now the second one she mentioned was called Blue Bay.<br/>
🎧 Blue Bay?<br/>
🎧 Yes, in fact that's very popular and it has some special features.<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 The main attraction is the large swimming pool with salt water.<br/>
🎧 Much healthier, I understand.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 And it isn't far from the beach, either - only 300 metres,<br/>
🎧 and only around half a kilometre to some shops,<br/>
🎧 so you don't have to be too energetic.<br/>
🎧 Is it much more expensive than the first one?<br/>
🎧 Let me just check.<br/>
🎧 I think at the time you want to go it's around £260<br/>
🎧 No, £275 to be exact.<br/>
🎧 Right, I've got that.<br/>
🎧 Now there are just two more apartments to ask you about.<br/>
🎧 Um, I can't read my own writing!<br/>
🎧 Something to do with sun... Sunshine, is it?<br/>
🎧 I think you meant the Sunshade Apartments.<br/>
🎧 They're on a mountainside.<br/>
🎧 Any special features?<br/>
🎧 Yes, each room has its own sun terrace<br/>
🎧 and there are shared barbecue facilities.<br/>
🎧 Oh, sounds lovely!<br/>
🎧 Yes, it is rather well-equipped.<br/>
🎧 It also provides water sports, it has its own beach.<br/>
🎧 There are facilities for water-skiing.<br/>
🎧 Any kite-surfing? My friend's quite keen.<br/>
🎧 Not at the hotel but I'm sure you'll find some in Arilas.<br/>
🎧 There's also satellite TV in the apartments.<br/>
🎧 And how much is that one?<br/>
🎧 £490 with two sharing.<br/>
🎧 You mean £245 each?<br/>
🎧 I'm afraid not!<br/>
🎧 Each person has to pay that amount and there must be at least two in an apartment.<br/>
🎧 I don't think that would be within our budget, unfortunately.<br/>
🎧 And the last one sounds a bit expensive too - the Grand!<br/>
🎧 Actually it's quite reasonable.<br/>
🎧 It's an older style house with Greek paintings in every room, and a balcony outside.<br/>
🎧 Sounds nice. What are the views like?<br/>
🎧 Well, there are forests all round and they hide a supermarket just down the road,<br/>
🎧 so that's very useful for all your shopping needs.<br/>
🎧 There's a disco in the area too.<br/>
🎧 And the price?<br/>
🎧 £319 at that time,<br/>
🎧 but if you leave it till November it goes down by 40%.<br/>
🎧 Hmm... Too late, I'm afraid.<br/>
🎧 Well, why don't i send you a brochure with full details, Ms...?<br/>
🎧 Nash.<br/>
🎧 But don't worry about that.<br/>
🎧 I'm coming to Upminster soon and I'll call and get one.<br/>
🎧 I just wanted to get an idea first.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's fine.<br/>
🎧 Uhh... We've got plenty here when you come.<br/>
🎧 If you've got a minute, could I just check a couple of points about insurance?<br/>
🎧 I got one policy through the post but I'd like to see if yours is better.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 What would you like to know?<br/>
🎧 Well, the one I've got has benefits and then the maximum amount you can claim.<br/>
🎧 Is that like yours?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's how most of them are.<br/>
🎧 Well, the first thing is cancellation.<br/>
🎧 If the holiday's cancelled on the policy I've got, you can claim £8,000.<br/>
🎧 We can improve on that, Ms Nash.<br/>
🎧 For Greek Island holidays, our maximum is £10,000.<br/>
🎧 That's good - of course our holiday won't even cost £1,000 together!<br/>
🎧 It's still sensible to have good cover.<br/>
🎧 Now, if you go to hospital, we allow £600.<br/>
🎧 Yes, mine's similar.<br/>
🎧 And we also allow a relative to travel to your holiday resort.<br/>
🎧 My policy just says their representative will help you.<br/>
🎧 You can see there's another difference there.<br/>
🎧 And what happens if you don't get on the plane?<br/>
🎧 Nothing, as far as I can see on this form.<br/>
🎧 Don't you have missed departure?<br/>
🎧 No, I'll just jot that down.<br/>
🎧 We pay up to £1,000 for that, depending on the reason.<br/>
🎧 And we're particularly generous about loss of personal belongings -<br/>
🎧 up to £3,000, but not more than £500 for a single item.<br/>
🎧 Then I'd better not take my laptop!<br/>
🎧 Not unless you insure it separately.<br/>
🎧 Okay, thanks very much for your time, you've really been helpful.<br/>
🎧 Can I get back to you? Your name is?<br/>
🎧 Ben Ludlow.<br/>
🎧 That's LUDLOW.<br/>
🎧 I'm the Assistant Manager here.<br/>
🎧 I'll give you my number.<br/>
🎧 It's 081260543216.<br/>
🎧 But didn't I phone 081260567294?<br/>
🎧 That's what I've got on the paper.<br/>
🎧 That's the main switchboard.<br/>
🎧 I've given you my direct line.<br/>
🎧 Right, thank you very much for your time.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 For the second in our series about locally-run businesses, we meet Simon Winridge,<br/>
🎧 co-founder of the hugely-successful Winridge Forest Railway Park.<br/>
🎧 Welcome, Simon.<br/>
🎧 Now, perhaps you can begin by telling us a little bit about how it all started.<br/>
🎧 Well, during the 1970s, my wife, Liz and I had just acquired 80 acres of sheep-farming land,<br/>
🎧 and we decided to settle down and have children.<br/>
🎧 Pretty soon we had a daughter, Sarah, and a son, Duncan.<br/>
🎧 The place was wonderful for the kids:<br/>
🎧 they particularly loved trains and gradually built up an enormous network of miniature railway track.<br/>
🎧 I began to develop larger-scale models of locomotives<br/>
🎧 but we didn't think anything more of it until I went on a trip to a theme park near Birmingham<br/>
🎧 and decided we could do a much better job!<br/>
🎧 So we set up a small one ourselves based on the miniature railway<br/>
🎧 and we opened to the public for just a month that year, 1984 -<br/>
🎧 in July - our driest month -<br/>
🎧 because our children said they didn't want our guests to have a miserable, wet visit.<br/>
🎧 I dealt with park business and Liz carried on with the farm work.<br/>
🎧 It soon became clear that we were onto a winner.<br/>
🎧 We began to extend the railway track and lay it among more interesting landscape by planting trees,<br/>
🎧 which in turn attracted more wildlife,<br/>
🎧 and by making cuttings through the rock.<br/>
🎧 Nowadays, we're open all year round<br/>
🎧 and we're pleased to say that Winridge is one of the most popular visitor attractions in the area -<br/>
🎧 with 50,000 visitors a year -<br/>
🎧 a million and a half people have been through our doors since we opened.<br/>
🎧 All these visitors mean we have had to expand our operation<br/>
🎧 and it's now a truly family concern.<br/>
🎧 I'm near to retirement age so...<br/>
🎧 I only concern myself with looking after the mechanical side of things - keeping the trains going.<br/>
🎧 Liz now devotes all her energies to recruiting and supporting the large squadron of workers,<br/>
🎧 which keep the place running smoothly.<br/>
🎧 We're really pleased that after some years away teaching,<br/>
🎧 Sarah has now returned to the park and makes sure the visitors are kept fed and watered,<br/>
🎧 which keeps her pretty busy as you can imagine.<br/>
🎧 Our son, Duncan, has been a stalwart of the park for the last ten years,<br/>
🎧 taking over from me in the area of construction -<br/>
🎧 and I'll say a little bit more about that in a moment -<br/>
🎧 and his new wife - Judith, has also joined the team in charge of retail.<br/>
🎧 That's becoming a tremendous growth area for us -<br/>
🎧 a lot of people want to buy souvenirs.<br/>
🎧 So have you finished your development of the site for the moment?<br/>
🎧 Not at all!<br/>
🎧 We're constantly looking for ways to offer more to our visitors.<br/>
🎧 The railway remains the central feature<br/>
🎧 and there's now 1.2 kilometres of the line laid but we'd like to lay more.<br/>
🎧 Because of the geology of the area, our greatest problem is digging tunnels.<br/>
🎧 But we're gradually overcoming that.<br/>
🎧 We're also very pleased with a new installation of the Go-Kart arena<br/>
🎧 which is 120 square metres in area.<br/>
🎧 Again the problem is the geology;<br/>
🎧 we had to level the mounds on the track for safety reasons.<br/>
🎧 We wanted to enable 5 to 12 year olds to use the go-karts.<br/>
🎧 And the main attraction here is the Formula 1 Kart.<br/>
🎧 We've known fights to break out over who gets it!<br/>
🎧 And then, finally, to our most recent...<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Ah Caroline... come on in. Sit down.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 So how's the dissertation planning going?<br/>
🎧 Well Dr Schulmann, I'm still having a lot of trouble deciding on a title.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's perfectly normal at this stage.<br/>
🎧 And this is what your tutorials will help you to do.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 What we'll do is jot down some points that might help you in your decision.<br/>
🎧 First of all, you have chosen your general topic area, haven't you?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's the fishing industry.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, that was one of the areas you mentioned.<br/>
🎧 Now, what aspects of the course are you good at?<br/>
🎧 Well, I think I'm coping well with statistics,<br/>
🎧 and I'm never bored by it.<br/>
🎧 Good. Anything else?<br/>
🎧 Well, I found computer modelling fascinating -<br/>
🎧 I have no problem following what's being taught,<br/>
🎧 whereas quite a few of my classmates find it difficult.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's very good.<br/>
🎧 Do you think these might be areas you could bring into your dissertation?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, if possible.<br/>
🎧 It's just that I'm having difficulty thinking how I can do that.<br/>
🎧 You see, I feel I don't have sufficient background information.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 Well, do you take notes?<br/>
🎧 I'm very weak at note-taking.<br/>
🎧 My teachers always used to say that.<br/>
🎧 Well, I think you really need to work on these weaknesses before you go any further.<br/>
🎧 What do you suggest?<br/>
🎧 Well, I can go through the possible strategies with you and let you decide where to go from there.<br/>
🎧 Okay, thanks.<br/>
🎧 Well, some people find it helpful to organise peer-group discussions -<br/>
🎧 you know, each week a different person studies a different topic and shares it with the group.<br/>
🎧 Oh right.<br/>
🎧 It really helps build confidence, you know, having to present something to others.<br/>
🎧 I can see that.<br/>
🎧 The drawback is that everyone in the group seems to share the same ideas...<br/>
🎧 they keep being repeated in all the dissertations.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 You could also try a service called 'Student Support'.<br/>
🎧 It's designed to give you a structured programme over a number of weeks to develop your skills.<br/>
🎧 Sounds good.<br/>
🎧 Yes, unfortunately there are only a few places.<br/>
🎧 But it's worth looking into.<br/>
🎧 Yes, of course.<br/>
🎧 I know I've got to work on my study skills.<br/>
🎧 And then there are several study skills books you can consult.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 They'll be a good source of reference<br/>
🎧 but the problem is they are sometimes too general.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's what I've found.<br/>
🎧 Other than that, I would strongly advise quite simple ideas like using a card index.<br/>
🎧 Well, yes, I've never done that before.<br/>
🎧 It's simple, but it really works because you have to get points down in a small space.<br/>
🎧 Another thing I always advise is don't just take your notes and forget about them.<br/>
🎧 Read everything three times - that'll really fix them in your mind.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I can see it'd take discipline but...<br/>
🎧 Well, if you establish good study skills at this stage, they'll be with you all your life.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes. I completely agree.<br/>
🎧 It's just that I don't seem to be able to discipline myself.<br/>
🎧 I need to talk things over.<br/>
🎧 Well, we'll be continuing these tutorials of course.<br/>
🎧 Let's arrange next month's now. Let's see...<br/>
🎧 I can see you virtually any time during the week starting the 22nd of January.<br/>
🎧 What about the 24th?<br/>
🎧 I'm free in the afternoon.<br/>
🎧 Sorry, I'm booked then.<br/>
🎧 What about the following day?<br/>
🎧 The Thursday?<br/>
🎧 I can make the morning.<br/>
🎧 Fine, we'll go for the 25th then.<br/>
🎧 That's great, thanks.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 In the last few lectures, I've been talking about the history of domestic building construction.<br/>
🎧 But today I want to begin looking at some contemporary, experimental designs for housing.<br/>
🎧 So, I'm going to start with a house which is constructed more or less under the ground.<br/>
🎧 And one of the interesting things about this project is...<br/>
🎧 that the owners - both professionals but not architects - wanted to be closely involved,<br/>
🎧 so they decided to manage the project themselves.<br/>
🎧 Their chief aim was to create somewhere that was as environmentally-friendly as possible.<br/>
🎧 But at the same time they wanted to live somewhere peaceful -<br/>
🎧 they'd both grown up in a rural area and disliked urban life.<br/>
🎧 So the first thing they did was to look for a site.<br/>
🎧 And they found a disused stone quarry in a beautiful area.<br/>
🎧 The price was relatively low,<br/>
🎧 and they liked the idea of recycling the land, as it were.<br/>
🎧 As it was, the quarry was an ugly blot on the landscape,<br/>
🎧 and it wasn't productive any longer, either.<br/>
🎧 They consulted various architects<br/>
🎧 and looked at a number of designs before finally deciding on one.<br/>
🎧 As I've said,<br/>
🎧 it was a design for a sort of underground house,<br/>
🎧 and it was built into the earth itself, with two storeys.<br/>
🎧 The north, east and west sides were set in the earth,<br/>
🎧 and only the sloping, south-facing side was exposed to the light.<br/>
🎧 That was made of a double layer of very strong glass.<br/>
🎧 There were also photovoltaic tiles fixed to the top and bottom of this sloping wall.<br/>
🎧 These are tiles that are designed to store energy from the sun.<br/>
🎧 And the walls had a layer of foam around them too, to increase the insulation.<br/>
🎧 Now, what is of interest to us about this project<br/>
🎧 is the features which make the building energy-efficient.<br/>
🎧 Sunlight floods in through the glass wall,<br/>
🎧 and to maximise it, there are lots of mirrors and windows inside the house.<br/>
🎧 That helps to spread the light around.<br/>
🎧 So that's the first thing - light is utilised as fully as possible.<br/>
🎧 In addition, the special tiles on the outside convert energy from the sun<br/>
🎧 and generate some of the house's electricity.<br/>
🎧 In fact, and it's possible that in future the house may even generate an electricity surplus,<br/>
🎧 and that the owners will be able to sell some to the national grid.<br/>
🎧 As well as that, wherever possible, recycled materials have been used.<br/>
🎧 For example, the floors are made of reclaimed wood.<br/>
🎧 And the owners haven't bought a single item of new furniture -<br/>
🎧 they just kept what they already had.<br/>
🎧 And then there's the system for dealing with the waste produced in the house.<br/>
🎧 This is dealt with organically -<br/>
🎧 it's purified by being filtered through reed beds<br/>
🎧 which have been planted for that purpose in the garden.<br/>
🎧 So the occupants of the house won't pollute the land or use any damaging chemicals.<br/>
🎧 It's true that the actual construction of the house was harmful to the environment,<br/>
🎧 mainly because they had to use massive amounts of concrete -<br/>
🎧 one of the biggest sources of carbon dioxide in manufacturing.<br/>
🎧 And, as you know, this is very damaging to the environment.<br/>
🎧 In total, the house construction has released 70 tons of carbon dioxide into the air.<br/>
🎧 Now that's a frightening thought.<br/>
🎧 However, once the initial 'debt' has been cleared -<br/>
🎧 and it's been calculated that this will only take fifteen years -<br/>
🎧 this underground house won't cost anything - environmentally I mean -<br/>
🎧 because unlike ordinary houses,<br/>
🎧 it is run in a way that is completely environmentally friendly.<br/>
🎧 So, eco-housing like this is likely to become...<br/>
<br/><br/>
