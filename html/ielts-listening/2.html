🎧 Sorry to keep you <span>waiting</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>firstly</span>, let me give you this <span>booklet</span>.<br/>
🎧 It tells you a bit more about the school,<br/>
🎧 the <span>courses</span> and the <span>social</span> <span>activities</span> we <span>offer</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, on the first <span>page</span>,<br/>
🎧 there's an <span>outline</span> of this <span>morning's</span> <span>activities</span>.<br/>
🎧 There, you see?<br/>
🎧 The <span>programme</span> <span>starts</span> at <span>10</span> <span>o'clock</span>.<br/>
🎧 Try not to be <span>late</span> as it's a very full day.<br/>
🎧 At <span>10</span> <span>o'clock</span>, all the new students will <span>gather</span> in the <span>Main</span> <span>Hall<br/></span>
🎧 to meet the <span>Principal</span> and the <span>rest</span> of the <span>staff</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, you <span>spend</span> most of the morning in the <span>Main</span> <span>Hall</span>.<br/>
🎧 Where's that?<br/>
🎧 I'll show you in a <span>minute</span>.<br/>
🎧 Just let me quickly run through this <span>morning's</span> <span>events</span> <span>first<br/></span>
🎧 and then I'll <span>explain</span> how to get there.<br/>
🎧 Yes, okay.<br/>
🎧 Right. Where were we?<br/>
🎧 Yes, so, the <span>Principal's</span> talk will last about <span>15</span> <span>minutes<br/></span>
🎧 and then the <span>Director</span> of <span>Studies</span> will talk to you for <span>half</span> an <span>hour</span> about the <span>courses<br/></span>
🎧 and the different <span>requirements</span> for each.<br/>
🎧 After that, the <span>Student</span> <span>Adviser</span> will tell you about the <span>various</span> <span>services</span> and <span>activities</span> we <span>offer</span> to students.<br/>
🎧 Any <span>questions</span>?<br/>
🎧 So, all of this is in the <span>Main</span> <span>Hall</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 And then you'll go next <span>door</span> to <span>Classroom</span> <span>5</span> at <span>11</span> <span>o'clock</span>.<br/>
🎧 What <span>happens</span> there?<br/>
🎧 You'll have a <span>test</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Test</span>?<br/>
🎧 I don't like the sound of that.<br/>
🎧 What <span>sort</span> of <span>test</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh, it's <span>nothing</span> to <span>worry</span> about.<br/>
🎧 It's just a <span>placement</span> <span>test</span> to help us find your <span>level</span> of <span>English<br/></span>
🎧 so that we can put you in the right class.<br/>
🎧 It won't last long.<br/>
🎧 But how do I find the <span>Main</span> <span>Hall</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Right;</span> if you look on the back of the <span>booklet</span> I gave you,<br/>
🎧 you'll see a map of the school.<br/>
🎧 Let me show you.<br/>
🎧 <span>Look;</span> you came in through the <span>Main</span> <span>Entrance</span>, here,<br/>
🎧 and now we're here at <span>Reception</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, to get to the <span>Main</span> <span>Hall</span>,<br/>
🎧 you <span>walk</span> on to the end of this <span>corridor</span> in <span>front</span> of <span>you<br/></span>
🎧 and then you <span>turn</span> <span>left</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Walk</span> along <span>past</span> the <span>Language</span> <span>Laboratory<br/></span>
🎧 and then <span>past</span> the <span>Library</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is next to the <span>Language</span> <span>Lab</span>, on the same side,<br/>
🎧 and <span>facing</span> you is the <span>Main</span> <span>Hall</span>, at the end of the <span>corridor</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can't <span>miss</span> it.<br/>
🎧 So it's next to the <span>Library</span>, in <span>fact</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's right.<br/>
🎧 I should be able to find that.<br/>
🎧 And do you have a <span>Computer</span> <span>Laboratory</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, we do.<br/>
🎧 Could you tell me where that is?<br/>
🎧 <span>Certainly</span>, yes.<br/>
🎧 You go down to the end of this <span>corridor</span> <span>again<br/></span>
🎧 but, this time, don't <span>turn</span> <span>left;<br/></span>
🎧 <span>turn</span> right, away from the <span>Main</span> <span>Hall</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Computer</span> <span>Lab</span>. is <span>immediately</span> on your right. Okay?<br/>
🎧 And where's the <span>staff</span> room, in case I need to find a <span>teacher</span> at some <span>stage</span>?<br/>
🎧 The <span>staff</span> room is near the <span>main</span> <span>entrance</span>,<br/>
🎧 on the <span>left</span> over there, just <span>opposite</span> the <span>Reception</span> <span>desk</span>.<br/>
🎧 In a day or two, I'm sure you'll find your way around very <span>easily</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, one last thing.<br/>
🎧 Is there a student <span>common</span> room?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, I <span>forgot</span> to <span>mention</span> that.<br/>
🎧 It's this <span>area</span> here,<br/>
🎧 very <span>close</span> to where we are now,<br/>
🎧 to the right of the <span>Reception</span> <span>desk</span> as you come in the <span>main</span> <span>entrance</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's tea and <span>coffee</span> <span>facilities</span> there.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 Thank you very much.<br/>
🎧 You're <span>welcome</span>.<br/>
<br/><br/>

🎧 Hello <span>everybody</span> and <span>welcome</span> to this <span>informal</span> <span>meeting</span> about the <span>University</span> <span>Helpline</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Helpline</span> was set up ten years ago by the <span>Students</span> <span>Union<br/></span>
🎧 and it <span>aims</span> to <span>provide</span> new students to the <span>university<br/></span>
🎧 with a <span>service</span> that they can use if they need <span>information<br/></span>
🎧 about <span>practical</span> <span>areas</span> of student life that they are <span>unfamiliar</span> with.<br/>
🎧 Let me give you some <span>examples</span> of the <span>type</span> of help we can <span>offer</span>.<br/>
🎧 We can <span>provide</span> <span>information</span> on <span>financial</span> <span>matters;<br/></span>
🎧 for example, you may feel that your <span>grant</span> is <span>insufficient</span> to see you through <span>college</span> <span>life<br/></span>
🎧 or you may have some <span>queries</span> <span>regarding</span> the <span>fees</span> you are <span>paying<br/></span>
🎧 if you are an <span>overseas</span> student.<br/>
🎧 In both <span>cases</span>, the <span>Helpline</span> would be able to go through things with <span>you<br/></span>
🎧 and see what the <span>outcome</span> might be.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>area</span> we can help with is what we <span>generally</span> <span>term</span> the <span>'domestic'</span> <span>area;<br/></span>
🎧 things such as <span>childcare</span> and the <span>availability</span> of <span>nursery</span> <span>provision</span>, for example, come under this.<br/>
🎧 Then there's <span>'academic'</span> issues that may <span>arise</span> while you are in the <span>early</span> <span>stages</span> of your <span>course<br/></span>
🎧 that you may not know what to do about.<br/>
🎧 You may wish to know more about <span>essay</span> <span>deadlines</span>, for example,<br/>
🎧 or how to use the <span>library</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 there are all <span>kinds</span> of <span>questions</span> you will find yourself <span>asking<br/></span>
🎧 and not <span>knowing</span> where to get <span>quick</span> <span>answers</span> from.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Helpline</span> would be able to <span>provide</span> these.<br/>
🎧 The last example I've <span>given</span> here is <span>simply</span> <span>termed</span> <span>'social'</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and yes, there is a lot of <span>social</span> life here!<br/>
🎧 But you may have a <span>particular</span> <span>interest</span> you wish to <span>pursue<br/></span>
🎧 or you may wish to <span>participate</span> in <span>outings</span> or <span>trips<br/></span>
🎧 if you don't know many people at the <span>moment</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let me give you some <span>details<br/></span>
🎧 so that you know where to go and who to see if you want to pay us a visit.<br/>
🎧 <span>Generally</span> you will see our <span>Helpline</span> <span>officer</span> <span>Jackie</span> <span>Kouachi</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's <span>KOUACHI</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Jackie</span> is a <span>full-time</span> <span>employee</span> of the <span>Student</span> <span>Union<br/></span>
🎧 and she <span>works</span> in the <span>Student</span> <span>Welfare</span> <span>Office</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 that's the <span>office</span> that <span>deals</span> with all <span>matters</span> <span>related</span> to student <span>welfare<br/></span>
🎧 and it's <span>located</span> at <span>13</span> <span>Marshall</span> <span>Road</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have some <span>maps</span> here for those of you who haven't been there yet.<br/>
🎧 If you wish to <span>ring</span> the <span>office</span>,<br/>
🎧 the number is <span>3269940</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>3269940</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>office</span> is open between <span>9.30</span> and <span>6</span> <span>o'clock</span> on <span>weekdays<br/></span>
🎧 and from <span>10</span> to <span>4</span> on <span>Saturdays<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>there'll</span> be <span>somebody</span> there usually <span>Jackie</span> or myself <span>-</span> between those <span>times</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you want to make an <span>appointment</span>, you can phone or call at the <span>office</span> in person.<br/>
🎧 Please <span>note</span> that it may not be <span>possible</span> for <span>anyone</span> to see you <span>straight</span> away <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>particularly</span> if it is a <span>busy</span> time <span>-</span> lunch time for example <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and you may have to go on the <span>waiting</span> <span>list</span> and then come back later.<br/>
🎧 Well, enough from me.<br/>
🎧 Any <span>questions</span>?<br/>
<br/><br/>

🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 So, we've <span>looked</span> at <span>various</span> <span>aspects</span> of <span>staff</span> <span>selection</span> this <span>term</span> <span>and..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think by now you should be <span>beginning</span> to <span>see<br/></span>
🎧 how much more there is to it than just <span>putting</span> <span>applicants</span> through a short <span>interview<br/></span>
🎧 or <span>asking</span> the <span>'right'</span> <span>questions</span>.<br/>
🎧 So I think you should be ready for <span>today's</span> <span>tutorial</span> on <span>'matching</span> the person to the <span>job'</span>.<br/>
🎧 We're going to talk today about the <span>importance</span> of <span>choosing</span> that all <span>round</span> <span>'right'</span> person.<br/>
🎧 Right. So we have to put <span>ourselves</span> into the <span>role</span> of the <span>manager</span> or <span>supervisor</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 And then we're going to <span>imagine</span> how different <span>applicants</span> would fit into the <span>team</span> or group they have to work <span>with..</span>.<br/>
🎧 we'll look at some <span>examples</span> later.<br/>
🎧 It's just <span>theoretical</span> at the <span>moment..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 The <span>point</span> is, you can <span>select</span> <span>someone</span> <span>-</span> even a friend <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 who has all the right <span>qualifications</span>, <span>degrees</span>, <span>certificates</span>, whatever.<br/>
🎧 You can also check that they have a lot of <span>experience..</span>.<br/>
🎧 that <span>they've</span> done the <span>sort</span> of <span>tasks</span> that you want them to do in your <span>office</span> already,<br/>
🎧 in a <span>similar</span> <span>environment</span>.<br/>
🎧 But if they start <span>work<br/></span>
🎧 and you <span>realise</span> that they just don't get along with <span>everybody</span> else, <span>that..</span>.<br/>
🎧 say, <span>they've</span> got <span>sharply</span> <span>contrasting</span> <span>views</span> on how something will <span>work..</span>.<br/>
🎧 well, with the best will in the <span>world</span>, you may be <span>backing</span> a <span>loser</span>.<br/>
🎧 Wouldn't it be just a <span>question</span> of company <span>training</span>, though?<br/>
🎧 Not always.<br/>
🎧 <span>Particularly</span> in a <span>team</span> <span>situation</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I think it's important to think in <span>terms</span> of that <span>type</span> of working <span>environment</span>.<br/>
🎧 People have to have <span>faith</span> in each <span>other's</span> <span>ability</span> to <span>carry</span> out the <span>task</span> their <span>boss</span> has set them.<br/>
🎧 They have to <span>trust</span> that everyone will do their <span>part</span> of the <span>job</span>,<br/>
🎧 and you can't <span>necessarily</span> <span>train</span> people for this.<br/>
🎧 But it's like trying to find out what <span>someone's</span> <span>personality</span> is like in a <span>job</span> <span>interview..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>mean..</span>. you just can't do that.<br/>
🎧 Even if you try, you won't find out what they're really like until they actually start work.<br/>
🎧 Well, in most <span>interviews</span> you usually ask <span>candidates</span> <span>questions</span> about their <span>hobbies</span> <span>and..</span>.<br/>
🎧 what they like doing in their <span>spare</span> <span>time..</span>.<br/>
🎧 that <span>sort</span> of <span>thing..</span>.<br/>
🎧 so, <span>employers</span> are already <span>involved</span> in the practice <span>of..</span>.<br/>
🎧 well, doing <span>part</span> of the <span>task</span>.<br/>
🎧 But it doesn't tell you anything.<br/>
🎧 It doesn't tell you if they're <span>easy-going</span> or <span>hate</span> <span>smokers</span> or whatever.<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>arguably</span> it does give you a bit of <span>information</span> about an <span>applicant's</span> <span>character</span>,<br/>
🎧 but also more and more <span>employers</span> around the <span>world</span> are <span>making</span> use of what are called <span>'personality</span> <span>questionnaires'<br/></span>
🎧 to help them <span>select</span> new <span>staff</span> <span>and..</span>.<br/>
🎧 What's it called?<br/>
🎧 A <span>Personality</span> <span>Questionnaire</span>.<br/>
🎧 They have to be <span>filled</span> out by the <span>candidates</span> some time during the <span>selection</span> <span>procedure</span>,<br/>
🎧 often just before an <span>interview</span>.<br/>
🎧 The idea is actually quite old.<br/>
🎧 <span>Apparently</span> they were used by the <span>ancient</span> <span>Chinese</span> for <span>picking</span> out <span>clerks</span> and <span>civil</span> <span>servants</span>,<br/>
🎧 and then later they were used by the <span>military</span> to put people in <span>appropriate</span> <span>areas</span> of work.<br/>
🎧 <span>They've</span> <span>gained</span> a lot of <span>ground</span> since <span>then<br/></span>
🎧 and there are about <span>80,000</span> different <span>tests</span> <span>available</span> <span>now<br/></span>
🎧 and almost two <span>thirds</span> of the large <span>employers</span> use them.<br/>
🎧 Which makes you think that there must be something in them.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 They ask the <span>sort</span> of <span>questions</span> that you might <span>expect</span>,<br/>
🎧 like do you like working under <span>pressure</span> <span>or..</span>.<br/>
🎧 are you good at <span>keeping</span> <span>deadlines</span>.<br/>
🎧 And what if people can see through them and just <span>write</span> what they think the <span>employer</span> <span>wants</span> to see?<br/>
🎧 Well that's always a <span>possibility</span>.<br/>
🎧 I mean, it's <span>human</span> <span>nature</span> to <span>lie</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Well, that's the <span>point</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Apparently</span> it isn't.<br/>
🎧 These <span>tests</span> are <span>compiled</span> by <span>experts<br/></span>
🎧 and they <span>believe</span> that the <span>answers</span> can <span>provide</span> a few simple <span>indicators<br/></span>
🎧 as to <span>roughly</span> the <span>type</span> of person that you <span>are..</span>.<br/>
🎧 that people will <span>generally</span> be <span>truthful</span> in that <span>situation</span>.<br/>
🎧 And then you can go some way <span>towards</span> <span>finding</span> out <span>whether</span> <span>someone's</span>, say, <span>forward-looking..</span>.<br/>
🎧 a <span>go-ahead</span> <span>type</span> of <span>person..</span>. or <span>resistant</span> to change.<br/>
🎧 And there are all <span>kinds</span> <span>of..</span>.<br/>
<br/><br/>

🎧 Right. Are we all here?<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 As you know, today <span>Vivien</span> is going to do a <span>presentation</span> on the <span>hat-making</span> <span>project<br/></span>
🎧 she did with her class during her last <span>teaching</span> practice. <span>So..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Over to you, <span>Vivien</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Mr <span>Yardley</span> has <span>asked</span> me to <span>describe</span> to <span>you<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>project</span> I did as a student <span>teacher</span> at a <span>secondary</span> school in <span>London</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was at this school for six <span>weeks<br/></span>
🎧 and I <span>taught</span> a <span>variety</span> of <span>subjects</span> to a class of <span>14</span> year old <span>pupils</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>project</span> I <span>chose</span> to do was a <span>hat-making</span> <span>project<br/></span>
🎧 and I think this <span>project</span> could <span>easily</span> be <span>adapted</span> to <span>suit</span> any age.<br/>
🎧 So, to <span>explain</span> the <span>project..</span>.<br/>
🎧 After we'd done the <span>research</span>,<br/>
🎧 we went back to the <span>classroom</span> to make two <span>basic</span> hat <span>shapes</span> <span>using</span> <span>rolls</span> of old <span>wallpaper</span>.<br/>
🎧 We each made, first of all, a <span>conical</span> hat <span>by..</span>.<br/>
🎧 well, if I show you <span>now..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>cutting</span> out a <span>circle</span> and then <span>making</span> one cut up to the <span>centre<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>then..</span>. <span>er..</span>. <span>overlapping</span> the cut like <span>this..</span>.<br/>
🎧 a <span>conical</span> hat that <span>sits</span> on your <span>head</span>.<br/>
🎧 The other hat we made was a little more <span>complicated</span>.<br/>
🎧 First of all, we cut out a <span>circle</span> <span>again..</span>.<br/>
🎧 like <span>this..</span>.<br/>
🎧 then you need a long <span>piece</span> with <span>flaps</span> on it.<br/>
🎧 I've already made that bit which I have here.<br/>
🎧 you <span>bend</span> the <span>flaps</span> over and <span>stick</span> them with <span>glue</span> or <span>prittstick<br/></span>
🎧 to the <span>underside</span> of the <span>circle..</span>. like this.<br/>
🎧 Again, I've <span>prepared</span> this so that I don't get <span>glue</span> <span>everywhere</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>pupils</span> do, of course, so you need <span>plenty</span> of <span>covers</span> for the <span>table</span>.<br/>
🎧 And there you have a <span>pillbox</span> hat as in <span>pill</span> and box.<br/>
🎧 Now <span>variations</span> and <span>combinations</span> of these two hat <span>shapes</span> <span>formed</span> the <span>basis</span> of the <span>pupils'</span> <span>final</span> <span>designs</span>.<br/>
🎧 The next <span>stage</span> of the <span>project</span> was the <span>design</span> <span>phase<br/></span>
🎧 and this <span>involved</span>, first of all, <span>using</span> their <span>pages</span> of <span>research</span> to <span>draw</span> a <span>design</span> of their hat on <span>paper</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's the easy <span>part</span>.<br/>
🎧 They then had to <span>translate</span> their <span>two-dimensional</span> <span>design</span> into a <span>form</span> to fit their <span>head</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>encouraged</span> them to make a <span>small-scale</span>, <span>three</span> <span>dimensional</span> hat <span>first<br/></span>
🎧 so that they could <span>experiment</span> with how to <span>achieve</span> the <span>form</span> they <span>required<br/></span>
🎧 and I <span>imposed</span> <span>certain</span> <span>constraints</span> on them to keep things simple.<br/>
🎧 For example, they had to use <span>paper</span> not <span>card</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Paper</span> is more <span>pliable</span> and <span>easier</span> to <span>handle</span>.<br/>
🎧 They also had to <span>limit</span> their <span>colours</span> to <span>white</span>, <span>grey</span> or <span>brown</span> <span>shades</span> of <span>paper<br/></span>
🎧 which <span>reflected</span> the <span>colours</span> of the <span>buildings</span> they were <span>using</span> as a <span>model</span> for their <span>hats<br/></span>
🎧 and they had to make sure their <span>glue</span> didn't show!<br/>
🎧 Well, it was very <span>enjoyable<br/></span>
🎧 and just to give you an idea of what they <span>produced</span>,<br/>
🎧 I've <span>brought</span> along <span>three</span> <span>hats</span> to show you.<br/>
🎧 This one here is <span>based</span> on a <span>circular</span> <span>stairway</span> in an old <span>building</span> in <span>London</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>uses</span> <span>three</span> <span>pillbox</span> <span>hats</span>, one on top of the other.<br/>
🎧 This was <span>designed</span> by <span>Theresa</span>.<br/>
🎧 Here's another one that has a simple <span>strip</span> going <span>round</span> the <span>base</span> of the <span>hat<br/></span>
🎧 but has then <span>gone</span> on to add <span>strips</span> of <span>paper</span> that come out from the <span>base<br/></span>
🎧 and that meet at the top of the hat <span>-</span> rather like a <span>crown</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>making</span> a <span>fairly</span> <span>tall</span> hat.<br/>
🎧 This was made by <span>Muriel</span>.<br/>
🎧 And <span>lastly</span>, there's a <span>combination</span> of the <span>pillbox</span> or <span>single</span> <span>strip</span> around the <span>base<br/></span>
🎧 and then the <span>conical</span> hat <span>shape</span> on top to <span>form</span> a <span>castle</span> <span>turret</span>.<br/>
🎧 This was made by <span>Fabrice</span>,<br/>
🎧 and there are many more that I could have <span>brought</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you, <span>Vivien</span>.<br/>
🎧 That was most <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now what we can learn from <span>this..</span>.<br/>
