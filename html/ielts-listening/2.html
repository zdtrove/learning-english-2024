🎧 Sorry to keep you waiting.<br/>
🎧 Well, firstly, let me give you this booklet.<br/>
🎧 It tells you a bit more about the school,<br/>
🎧 the courses and the social activities we offer.<br/>
🎧 Now, on the first page,<br/>
🎧 there's an outline of this morning's activities.<br/>
🎧 There, you see?<br/>
🎧 The programme starts at 10 o'clock.<br/>
🎧 Try not to be late as it's a very full day.<br/>
🎧 At 10 o'clock, all the new students will gather in the Main Hall<br/>
🎧 to meet the Principal and the rest of the staff.<br/>
🎧 In fact, you spend most of the morning in the Main Hall.<br/>
🎧 Where's that?<br/>
🎧 I'll show you in a minute.<br/>
🎧 Just let me quickly run through this morning's events first<br/>
🎧 and then I'll explain how to get there.<br/>
🎧 Yes, okay.<br/>
🎧 Right. Where were we?<br/>
🎧 Yes, so, the Principal's talk will last about 15 minutes<br/>
🎧 and then the Director of Studies will talk to you for half an hour about the courses<br/>
🎧 and the different requirements for each.<br/>
🎧 After that, the Student Adviser will tell you about the various services and activities we offer to students.<br/>
🎧 Any questions?<br/>
🎧 So, all of this is in the Main Hall?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 And then you'll go next door to Classroom 5 at 11 o'clock.<br/>
🎧 What happens there?<br/>
🎧 You'll have a test.<br/>
🎧 Test?<br/>
🎧 I don't like the sound of that.<br/>
🎧 What sort of test?<br/>
🎧 Oh, it's nothing to worry about.<br/>
🎧 It's just a placement test to help us find your level of English<br/>
🎧 so that we can put you in the right class.<br/>
🎧 It won't last long.<br/>
🎧 But how do I find the Main Hall?<br/>
🎧 Right; if you look on the back of the booklet I gave you,<br/>
🎧 you'll see a map of the school.<br/>
🎧 Let me show you.<br/>
🎧 Look; you came in through the Main Entrance, here,<br/>
🎧 and now we're here at Reception.<br/>
🎧 Now, to get to the Main Hall,<br/>
🎧 you walk on to the end of this corridor in front of you<br/>
🎧 and then you turn left.<br/>
🎧 Walk along past the Language Laboratory<br/>
🎧 and then past the Library,<br/>
🎧 which is next to the Language Lab, on the same side,<br/>
🎧 and facing you is the Main Hall, at the end of the corridor.<br/>
🎧 You can't miss it.<br/>
🎧 So it's next to the Library, in fact.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's right.<br/>
🎧 I should be able to find that.<br/>
🎧 And do you have a Computer Laboratory?<br/>
🎧 Yes, we do.<br/>
🎧 Could you tell me where that is?<br/>
🎧 Certainly, yes.<br/>
🎧 You go down to the end of this corridor again<br/>
🎧 but, this time, don't turn left;<br/>
🎧 turn right, away from the Main Hall.<br/>
🎧 The Computer Lab. is immediately on your right. Okay?<br/>
🎧 And where's the staff room, in case I need to find a teacher at some stage?<br/>
🎧 The staff room is near the main entrance,<br/>
🎧 on the left over there, just opposite the Reception desk.<br/>
🎧 In a day or two, I'm sure you'll find your way around very easily.<br/>
🎧 Oh, one last thing.<br/>
🎧 Is there a student common room?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, I forgot to mention that.<br/>
🎧 It's this area here,<br/>
🎧 very close to where we are now,<br/>
🎧 to the right of the Reception desk as you come in the main entrance.<br/>
🎧 There's tea and coffee facilities there.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 Thank you very much.<br/>
🎧 You're welcome.<br/><br/>

🎧 Hello everybody and welcome to this informal meeting about the University Helpline.<br/>
🎧 The Helpline was set up ten years ago by the Students Union<br/>
🎧 and it aims to provide new students to the university<br/>
🎧 with a service that they can use if they need information<br/>
🎧 about practical areas of student life that they are unfamiliar with.<br/>
🎧 Let me give you some examples of the type of help we can offer.<br/>
🎧 We can provide information on financial matters;<br/>
🎧 for example, you may feel that your grant is insufficient to see you through college life<br/>
🎧 or you may have some queries regarding the fees you are paying<br/>
🎧 if you are an overseas student.<br/>
🎧 In both cases, the Helpline would be able to go through things with you<br/>
🎧 and see what the outcome might be.<br/>
🎧 Another area we can help with is what we generally term the 'domestic' area;<br/>
🎧 things such as childcare and the availability of nursery provision, for example, come under this.<br/>
🎧 Then there's 'academic' issues that may arise while you are in the early stages of your course<br/>
🎧 that you may not know what to do about.<br/>
🎧 You may wish to know more about essay deadlines, for example,<br/>
🎧 or how to use the library -<br/>
🎧 there are all kinds of questions you will find yourself asking<br/>
🎧 and not knowing where to get quick answers from.<br/>
🎧 The Helpline would be able to provide these.<br/>
🎧 The last example I've given here is simply termed 'social' -<br/>
🎧 and yes, there is a lot of social life here!<br/>
🎧 But you may have a particular interest you wish to pursue<br/>
🎧 or you may wish to participate in outings or trips<br/>
🎧 if you don't know many people at the moment.<br/>
🎧 Let me give you some details<br/>
🎧 so that you know where to go and who to see if you want to pay us a visit.<br/>
🎧 Generally you will see our Helpline officer Jackie Kouachi,<br/>
🎧 that's KOUACHI.<br/>
🎧 Jackie is a full-time employee of the Student Union<br/>
🎧 and she works in the Student Welfare Office -<br/>
🎧 that's the office that deals with all matters related to student welfare<br/>
🎧 and it's located at 13 Marshall Road.<br/>
🎧 I have some maps here for those of you who haven't been there yet.<br/>
🎧 If you wish to ring the office,<br/>
🎧 the number is 3269940.<br/>
🎧 That's 3269940.<br/>
🎧 The office is open between 9.30 and 6 o'clock on weekdays<br/>
🎧 and from 10 to 4 on Saturdays<br/>
🎧 and there'll be somebody there usually Jackie or myself - between those times.<br/>
🎧 If you want to make an appointment, you can phone or call at the office in person.<br/>
🎧 Please note that it may not be possible for anyone to see you straight away -<br/>
🎧 particularly if it is a busy time - lunch time for example -<br/>
🎧 and you may have to go on the waiting list and then come back later.<br/>
🎧 Well, enough from me.<br/>
🎧 Any questions?<br/><br/>

🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 So, we've looked at various aspects of staff selection this term and...<br/>
🎧 I think by now you should be beginning to see<br/>
🎧 how much more there is to it than just putting applicants through a short interview<br/>
🎧 or asking the 'right' questions.<br/>
🎧 So I think you should be ready for today's tutorial on 'matching the person to the job'.<br/>
🎧 We're going to talk today about the importance of choosing that all round 'right' person.<br/>
🎧 Right. So we have to put ourselves into the role of the manager or supervisor?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 And then we're going to imagine how different applicants would fit into the team or group they have to work with...<br/>
🎧 we'll look at some examples later.<br/>
🎧 It's just theoretical at the moment...<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 The point is, you can select someone - even a friend -<br/>
🎧 who has all the right qualifications, degrees, certificates, whatever.<br/>
🎧 You can also check that they have a lot of experience...<br/>
🎧 that they've done the sort of tasks that you want them to do in your office already,<br/>
🎧 in a similar environment.<br/>
🎧 But if they start work<br/>
🎧 and you realise that they just don't get along with everybody else, that...<br/>
🎧 say, they've got sharply contrasting views on how something will work...<br/>
🎧 well, with the best will in the world, you may be backing a loser.<br/>
🎧 Wouldn't it be just a question of company training, though?<br/>
🎧 Not always.<br/>
🎧 Particularly in a team situation,<br/>
🎧 and I think it's important to think in terms of that type of working environment.<br/>
🎧 People have to have faith in each other's ability to carry out the task their boss has set them.<br/>
🎧 They have to trust that everyone will do their part of the job,<br/>
🎧 and you can't necessarily train people for this.<br/>
🎧 But it's like trying to find out what someone's personality is like in a job interview...<br/>
🎧 I mean... you just can't do that.<br/>
🎧 Even if you try, you won't find out what they're really like until they actually start work.<br/>
🎧 Well, in most interviews you usually ask candidates questions about their hobbies and...<br/>
🎧 what they like doing in their spare time...<br/>
🎧 that sort of thing...<br/>
🎧 so, employers are already involved in the practice of...<br/>
🎧 well, doing part of the task.<br/>
🎧 But it doesn't tell you anything.<br/>
🎧 It doesn't tell you if they're easy-going or hate smokers or whatever.<br/>
🎧 Well, arguably it does give you a bit of information about an applicant's character,<br/>
🎧 but also more and more employers around the world are making use of what are called 'personality questionnaires'<br/>
🎧 to help them select new staff and...<br/>
🎧 What's it called?<br/>
🎧 A Personality Questionnaire.<br/>
🎧 They have to be filled out by the candidates some time during the selection procedure,<br/>
🎧 often just before an interview.<br/>
🎧 The idea is actually quite old.<br/>
🎧 Apparently they were used by the ancient Chinese for picking out clerks and civil servants,<br/>
🎧 and then later they were used by the military to put people in appropriate areas of work.<br/>
🎧 They've gained a lot of ground since then<br/>
🎧 and there are about 80,000 different tests available now<br/>
🎧 and almost two thirds of the large employers use them.<br/>
🎧 Which makes you think that there must be something in them.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 They ask the sort of questions that you might expect,<br/>
🎧 like do you like working under pressure or...<br/>
🎧 are you good at keeping deadlines.<br/>
🎧 And what if people can see through them and just write what they think the employer wants to see?<br/>
🎧 Well that's always a possibility.<br/>
🎧 I mean, it's human nature to lie, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Well, that's the point.<br/>
🎧 Apparently it isn't.<br/>
🎧 These tests are compiled by experts<br/>
🎧 and they believe that the answers can provide a few simple indicators<br/>
🎧 as to roughly the type of person that you are...<br/>
🎧 that people will generally be truthful in that situation.<br/>
🎧 And then you can go some way towards finding out whether someone's, say, forward-looking...<br/>
🎧 a go-ahead type of person... or resistant to change.<br/>
🎧 And there are all kinds of...<br/><br/>

<br/>
🎧 Right. Are we all here?<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 As you know, today Vivien is going to do a presentation on the hat-making project<br/>
🎧 she did with her class during her last teaching practice. So...<br/>
🎧 Over to you, Vivien.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Mr Yardley has asked me to describe to you<br/>
🎧 the project I did as a student teacher at a secondary school in London.<br/>
🎧 I was at this school for six weeks<br/>
🎧 and I taught a variety of subjects to a class of 14 year old pupils.<br/>
🎧 The project I chose to do was a hat-making project<br/>
🎧 and I think this project could easily be adapted to suit any age.<br/>
🎧 So, to explain the project...<br/>
🎧 After we'd done the research,<br/>
🎧 we went back to the classroom to make two basic hat shapes using rolls of old wallpaper.<br/>
🎧 We each made, first of all, a conical hat by...<br/>
🎧 well, if I show you now...<br/>
🎧 cutting out a circle and then making one cut up to the centre<br/>
🎧 and then... er... overlapping the cut like this...<br/>
🎧 a conical hat that sits on your head.<br/>
🎧 The other hat we made was a little more complicated.<br/>
🎧 First of all, we cut out a circle again...<br/>
🎧 like this...<br/>
🎧 then you need a long piece with flaps on it.<br/>
🎧 I've already made that bit which I have here.<br/>
🎧 you bend the flaps over and stick them with glue or prittstick<br/>
🎧 to the underside of the circle... like this.<br/>
🎧 Again, I've prepared this so that I don't get glue everywhere.<br/>
🎧 The pupils do, of course, so you need plenty of covers for the table.<br/>
🎧 And there you have a pillbox hat as in pill and box.<br/>
🎧 Now variations and combinations of these two hat shapes formed the basis of the pupils' final designs.<br/>
🎧 The next stage of the project was the design phase<br/>
🎧 and this involved, first of all, using their pages of research to draw a design of their hat on paper.<br/>
🎧 That's the easy part.<br/>
🎧 They then had to translate their two-dimensional design into a form to fit their head.<br/>
🎧 I encouraged them to make a small-scale, three dimensional hat first<br/>
🎧 so that they could experiment with how to achieve the form they required<br/>
🎧 and I imposed certain constraints on them to keep things simple.<br/>
🎧 For example, they had to use paper not card.<br/>
🎧 Paper is more pliable and easier to handle.<br/>
🎧 They also had to limit their colours to white, grey or brown shades of paper<br/>
🎧 which reflected the colours of the buildings they were using as a model for their hats<br/>
🎧 and they had to make sure their glue didn't show!<br/>
🎧 Well, it was very enjoyable<br/>
🎧 and just to give you an idea of what they produced,<br/>
🎧 I've brought along three hats to show you.<br/>
🎧 This one here is based on a circular stairway in an old building in London.<br/>
🎧 It uses three pillbox hats, one on top of the other.<br/>
🎧 This was designed by Theresa.<br/>
🎧 Here's another one that has a simple strip going round the base of the hat<br/>
🎧 but has then gone on to add strips of paper that come out from the base<br/>
🎧 and that meet at the top of the hat - rather like a crown -<br/>
🎧 making a fairly tall hat.<br/>
🎧 This was made by Muriel.<br/>
🎧 And lastly, there's a combination of the pillbox or single strip around the base<br/>
🎧 and then the conical hat shape on top to form a castle turret.<br/>
🎧 This was made by Fabrice,<br/>
🎧 and there are many more that I could have brought.<br/>
🎧 Thank you, Vivien.<br/>
🎧 That was most interesting.<br/>
🎧 Now what we can learn from this...<br/>
<br/><br/>
