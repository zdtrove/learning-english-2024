🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 Welcome to the Early Learning Childcare Centre.<br/>
🎧 How may I help you?<br/>
🎧 Hi. I spoke to you last week about enrolling my daughter for next year.<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes.<br/>
🎧 I'll just get some details from you.<br/>
🎧 So, you're her mother?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 And, can I have your name?<br/>
🎧 It's Carol, Carol Smith.<br/>
🎧 And your daughter's name?<br/>
🎧 It's Kate.<br/>
🎧 Now, we have several groups at the centre and we cater for children from three to five years old.<br/>
🎧 How old is your daughter?<br/>
🎧 She's three now but she turns four next month.<br/>
🎧 I'll put four down because that's how old she'll be when she starts.<br/>
🎧 Fine, she's so excited about her birthday and coming to the centre.<br/>
🎧 Aw, that's good to hear.<br/>
🎧 And what's your address?<br/>
🎧 It's 46 Wombat Road,<br/>
🎧 that's W-O-M-B-A-T.<br/>
🎧 Woodside 4032.<br/>
🎧 And what's the phone number?<br/>
🎧 Oh… it's… 3345 9865.<br/>
🎧 So, have you decided on the days you'd like to bring your daughter here?<br/>
🎧 I'd prefer Monday and Wednesday if possible.<br/>
🎧 Mmm. I'll check,<br/>
🎧 Monday's fine, but I think the centre is already full for Wednesday.<br/>
🎧 Erm. Yes. Sorry. It seems to be a very popular day.<br/>
🎧 We can offer you a Thursday or a Friday as well.<br/>
🎧 Oh dear.<br/>
🎧 I suppose Thursday would be all right because she has swimming on Friday.<br/>
🎧 OK, got that.<br/>
🎧 Because a lot of parents work, we do offer flexible start and finish times.<br/>
🎧 We are open from 7:30 in the morning until 6 o'clock at night.<br/>
🎧 What time would you like your daughter to start?<br/>
🎧 I need to get to work in the city by 9:00 so I'll drop her off at 8:30.<br/>
🎧 You're pretty close to the city here so that should give me plenty of time to get there.<br/>
🎧 That's fine.<br/>
🎧 Now, we also need to decide which group she'll be in.<br/>
🎧 we have two different groups and they're divided up according to age.<br/>
🎧 There's the green group.<br/>
🎧 Which is for three- to four-year-olds.<br/>
🎧 And then there's the red group which is for four- to five-year-olds.<br/>
🎧 She's quite mature for her age and she can already write her name and read a little.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'll put her in the red group<br/>
🎧 and we can always change her to the green one if there are any problems.<br/>
🎧 That sounds fine.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Let's move on to meals.<br/>
🎧 We can provide breakfast, lunch and dinner.<br/>
🎧 As she's finishing pretty early, she won't need dinner,<br/>
🎧 will you give her breakfast before she comes?<br/>
🎧 Yes, she'll only need lunch.<br/>
🎧 Now, does she have any medical conditions we need to know about?<br/>
🎧 Does she have asthma or any hearing problems for example?<br/>
🎧 No. But she does need to wear glasses.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I'll make a note of that.<br/>
🎧 Yes, she's pretty good about wearing them, she can't see much without them.<br/>
🎧 Right. OK.<br/>
🎧 Now, I also need emergency contact details.<br/>
🎧 So what sort of information do you need?<br/>
🎧 Just the name and number of a friend or family member we can contact in case we can't get hold of you at any time.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 That'd better be my sister… Jenny Ball.<br/>
🎧 That's B-A-L-L.<br/>
🎧 Her phone number is 33467523.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 So she is the child's aunt?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's right.<br/>
🎧 I'll make a note of that as well.<br/>
🎧 Now, is there anything you'd like to ask?<br/>
🎧 What about payment?<br/>
🎧 How much are the fees each term?<br/>
🎧 Well, for two days and the hours you've chosen,<br/>
🎧 that will be $450 altogether.<br/>
🎧 OK, and do I have to pay that now?<br/>
🎧 No, we send out invoices once the children start at the centre.<br/>
🎧 You can choose to pay at the end of each term or...<br/>
🎧 we do offer a slightly discounted rate if you pay every month.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I'll do that then.<br/>
🎧 I find it easier to budget that way and I'm not used to the term dates just yet.<br/>
🎧 Good, it makes it a lot simpler for us as well.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's everything.<br/>
🎧 Would you like me to show you around…?<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Today we're pleased to have on the show Alice Bussell from the Dolphin Conservation Trust.<br/>
🎧 Tell us about the Trust, Alice.<br/>
🎧 Well, obviously its purpose is to protect dolphins in seas all around the world.<br/>
🎧 It tries to raise people's awareness of the problems these marine creatures are suffering<br/>
🎧 because of pollution and other threats.<br/>
🎧 It started ten years ago and it's one of the fastest growing animal charities in the country -<br/>
🎧 although it's still fairly small compared with the big players in animal protection.<br/>
🎧 We are particularly proud of the work we do in education -<br/>
🎧 last year we visited a huge number of schools in different parts of the country,<br/>
🎧 going round to talk to children and young people aged from five to eighteen.<br/>
🎧 In fact, about thirty-five per cent of our members are children.<br/>
🎧 The charity uses its money to support campaigns -<br/>
🎧 for example, for changes in fishing policy and so forth.<br/>
🎧 It hopes soon to be able to employ its first full-time biologist - with dolphin expertise - to monitor populations.<br/>
🎧 Of course, many people give their services on a voluntary basis<br/>
🎧 and we now have volunteers working in observation, office work and other things.<br/>
🎧 I should also tell you about the award we won from the Charity Commission last year - for our work in education.<br/>
🎧 Although it's not meant an enormous amount of money for us,<br/>
🎧 it has made our activities even more widely publicised and understood.<br/>
🎧 In the long term it may not bring in extra members<br/>
🎧 but we're hoping it'll have this effect.<br/>
🎧 Is it possible to see dolphins in UK waters?<br/>
🎧 Yes. In several locations.<br/>
🎧 And we have a big project in the east part of Scotland.<br/>
🎧 This has long been a haven for dolphins because it has very little shipping.<br/>
🎧 However, that may be about to change soon<br/>
🎧 because oil companies want to increase exploration there.<br/>
🎧 We're campaigning against this<br/>
🎧 because, although there'll be little pollution from oil,<br/>
🎧 exploration creates a lot of underwater noise.<br/>
🎧 It means the dolphins can't rest and socialise.<br/>
🎧 This is how I became interested in dolphin conservation in the first place.<br/>
🎧 I had never seen one and I hadn't been particularly interested in them at school.<br/>
🎧 Then I came across this story about a family of dolphins who had to leave their home in the Moray Firth<br/>
🎧 because of the oil companies and about a child who campaigned to save them.<br/>
🎧 I couldn't put the book down - I was hooked.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure our listeners will want to find out what they can do to help.<br/>
🎧 You mentioned the 'Adopt a Dolphin' scheme.<br/>
🎧 Can you tell us about that?<br/>
🎧 Of course!<br/>
🎧 People can choose one of our dolphins to sponsor.<br/>
🎧 They receive a picture of it and news updates.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to tell you about four which are currently being adopted by our members:<br/>
🎧 Moondancer, Echo, Kiwi and Samson.<br/>
🎧 Unfortunately, Echo is being rather elusive this year and hasn't yet been sighted by our observers<br/>
🎧 but we remain optimistic that he'll be out there soon.<br/>
🎧 All the others have been out in force -<br/>
🎧 Samson and Moondancer are often photographed together<br/>
🎧 but it is Kiwi who's our real 'character' as she seems to love coming up close for the cameras<br/>
🎧 and we've captured her on film hundreds of times.<br/>
🎧 They all have their own personalities -<br/>
🎧 Moondancer is very elegant and curves out and into the water very smoothly,<br/>
🎧 whereas Samson has a lot of energy -<br/>
🎧 he's always leaping out of the water with great vigour.<br/>
🎧 You'd probably expect him to be the youngest -<br/>
🎧 he's not quite - that's Kiwi -<br/>
🎧 but Samson's the latest of our dolphins to be chosen for the scheme.<br/>
🎧 Kiwi makes a lot of noise so we can often pick her out straightaway.<br/>
🎧 Echo and Moondancer are noisy too,<br/>
🎧 but Moondancer's easy to find because she has a particularly large fin on her back,<br/>
🎧 which makes her easy to identify.<br/>
🎧 So, yes, they're all very different…<br/>
🎧 Well, they sound a fascinating group…<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Hi, Rob. How's the course going?<br/>
🎧 Oh, hi, Mia. Yeah, great.<br/>
🎧 I can't believe the first term's nearly over.<br/>
🎧 I saw your group's performance last night at the student theatre.<br/>
🎧 It was good.<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 Yeah… but now we have to write a report on the whole thing, an in-depth analysis.<br/>
🎧 I don't know where to start.<br/>
🎧 Like, I have to write about the role I played, the doctor, how I developed the character.<br/>
🎧 Well, what was your starting point?<br/>
🎧 My grandfather was a doctor before he retired, and I just based it on him.<br/>
🎧 OK, but how?<br/>
🎧 Did you talk to him about it?<br/>
🎧 He must have all sorts of stories, but he never says much about his work, even now.<br/>
🎧 He has a sort of authority though.<br/>
🎧 So how did you manage to capture that?<br/>
🎧 I'd visualise what he must have been like in the past,<br/>
🎧 when he was sitting in his consulting room listening to his patients.<br/>
🎧 OK, so that's what you explain in your report.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Then there's the issue of atmosphere -<br/>
🎧 so in the first scene we needed to know how boring life was in the doctor's village in the 1950s,<br/>
🎧 so when the curtain went up on the first scene in the waiting room,<br/>
🎧 there was that long silence before anyone spoke.<br/>
🎧 And then people kept saying the same thing over and over, like 'Cold, isn't it?'<br/>
🎧 Yes, and everyone wore grey and brown, and just sat in a row.<br/>
🎧 Yes, all those details of the production.<br/>
🎧 And I have to analyse how I functioned in the group -<br/>
🎧 what I found out about myself.<br/>
🎧 I know I was so frustrated at times, when we couldn't agree.<br/>
🎧 Yes. So did one person emerge as the leader?<br/>
🎧 Sophia did.<br/>
🎧 That was OK - she helped us work out exactly what to do, for the production.<br/>
🎧 And that made me feel better, I suppose.<br/>
🎧 When you understood what needed doing?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 And Sophia did some research, too.<br/>
🎧 That was useful in developing our approach.<br/>
🎧 Like what?<br/>
🎧 Well, she found these articles from the 1950s about how relationships between children and their parents,<br/>
🎧 or between the public and people like bank managers or the police were shifting.<br/>
🎧 Interesting.<br/>
🎧 And did you have any practical problems to overcome?<br/>
🎧 Well, in the final rehearsal everything was going fine until the last scene -<br/>
🎧 that's where the doctor's first patient appears on stage on his own.<br/>
🎧 The one in the wheelchair?<br/>
🎧 Yes, and he had this really long speech, with the stage all dark except for one spotlight -<br/>
🎧 and then that stuck somehow so it was shining on the wrong side of the stage…<br/>
🎧 but anyway we got that fixed, thank goodness.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it was fine on the night.<br/>
🎧 But while you're here, Mia.<br/>
🎧 I wanted to ask you about the year abroad option.<br/>
🎧 Would you recommend doing that?<br/>
🎧 Yes, definitely.<br/>
🎧 It's a fantastic chance to study in another country for a year.<br/>
🎧 I think I'd like to do it,<br/>
🎧 but it looks very competitive -<br/>
🎧 there's only a limited number of places.<br/>
🎧 Yes, so next year when you are in the second year of the course,<br/>
🎧 you need to work really hard in all your theatre studies modules.<br/>
🎧 Only students with good marks get places -<br/>
🎧 you have to prove that you know your subject really well.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So how did you choose where to go?<br/>
🎧 Well, I decided I wanted a programme that would fit in with what I wanted to do after I graduate,<br/>
🎧 so I looked for a university with emphasis on acting rather than directing for example.<br/>
🎧 It depends on you.<br/>
🎧 Then about six months before you go,<br/>
🎧 you have to email the scheme coordinator with your top three choices.<br/>
🎧 I had a friend who missed the deadline and didn't get her first choice,<br/>
🎧 so you do need to get a move on at that stage.<br/>
🎧 You'll find that certain places are very popular with everyone.<br/>
🎧 And don't you have to write a personal statement at that stage?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I'll get some of the final year students to give me some tips…<br/>
🎧 maybe see if I can read what they wrote.<br/>
🎧 I think that's a very good idea.<br/>
🎧 I don't mind showing you what I did.<br/>
🎧 And while you're abroad don't make the mistake I made.<br/>
🎧 I got so involved I forgot all about making arrangements for when I came back here for the final year.<br/>
🎧 Make sure you stay in touch so they know your choices for the optional modules.<br/>
🎧 You don't want to miss out doing your preferred specialisms.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Today, I want to talk about self-regulatory focus theory<br/>
🎧 and how the actions of leaders can affect the way followers approach different situations.<br/>
🎧 Self-regulatory focus theory is a theory developed by Tori Higgins.<br/>
🎧 He says that a person's focus at any given time is to either approach pleasure or avoid pain.<br/>
🎧 These are two basic motivations that each and every one of us has,<br/>
🎧 and they cause us to have different kinds of goals.<br/>
🎧 Promotion goals in different life situations emphasise achievement.<br/>
🎧 Prevention goals are oriented towards the avoidance of punishment.<br/>
🎧 In a specific situation,<br/>
🎧 our thoughts might focus more on promotion goals or more on prevention goals.<br/>
🎧 The theory suggests that two factors affect which goals we are focusing on.<br/>
🎧 First, there is a chronic factor.<br/>
🎧 This factor is connected to a person's personality<br/>
🎧 and says that each person has a basic tendency to either focus more on promotion goals<br/>
🎧 or focus more on prevention goals as part of his or her personality.<br/>
🎧 Second, there is a situational factor<br/>
🎧 which means that the context we are in can make us more likely to focus on one set of goals or the other.<br/>
🎧 For example, we are more likely to be thinking about pleasure and to have promotion goals<br/>
🎧 when we are spending time with a friend.<br/>
🎧 In contrast, if we are working on an important project for our boss,<br/>
🎧 we are more likely to try to avoid making mistakes<br/>
🎧 and therefore have more prevention goals in our mind.<br/>
🎧 Research has shown that the goals we are focusing on at a given time affect the way we think.<br/>
🎧 For example, when focusing on promotion goals,<br/>
🎧 people consider their ideal self, their aspirations and gains.<br/>
🎧 They don't think about what they can lose,<br/>
🎧 so they think in a happier mode.<br/>
🎧 They feel more inspired to change.<br/>
🎧 When people are focusing on prevention goals,<br/>
🎧 they think about their “ought” self.<br/>
🎧 What are they supposed to be?<br/>
🎧 What are people expecting from them?<br/>
🎧 They consider their obligations to others.<br/>
🎧 As a result, they experience more anxiety and try to avoid situations where they could lose.<br/>
🎧 Now that I have talked about the two focuses and how they affect people,<br/>
🎧 I want to look at the idea that the way leaders behave, or their style of leading,<br/>
🎧 can affect the focus that followers adopt in a specific situation.<br/>
🎧 In talking about leadership,<br/>
🎧 we often mention transformational leaders and transactional leaders.<br/>
🎧 Transformational leaders, when interacting with their followers, focus on their development.<br/>
🎧 In their words and actions transformational leaders highlight change.<br/>
🎧 Their speech is passionate and conveys a definitive vision.<br/>
🎧 All of these things can encourage followers to think about what could be.<br/>
🎧 In other words, they inspire a promotion focus in their followers.<br/>
🎧 In contrast, transactional leaders focus on developing clear structures<br/>
🎧 that tell their followers exactly what is expected of them.<br/>
🎧 While they do explain the rewards people will get for following orders,<br/>
🎧 they emphasise more how a follower will be punished<br/>
🎧 or that a follower won't get rewarded<br/>
🎧 if his or her behaviour doesn't change.<br/>
🎧 In short, they emphasise the consequences of making a mistake.<br/>
🎧 This emphasis will clearly lead followers to focus on avoiding punishment and problems.<br/>
🎧 This is clearly a prevention focus.<br/>
🎧 In conclusion, it is important to understand that one focus is not necessarily better than the other one.<br/>
🎧 For a designer who works in a field where a lot of innovation is needed,<br/>
🎧 a promotion focus is probably better.<br/>
🎧 In contrast, a prevention focus which causes people to work more cautiously and produce higher quality work<br/>
🎧 might be very appropriate for a job like a surgeon, for example.<br/>
🎧 The main point of the research, though, is that the actions of leaders<br/>
🎧 can greatly influence whether people approach a situation<br/>
🎧 with more of a promotion focus or more of a prevention focus.<br/>
<br/><br/>
