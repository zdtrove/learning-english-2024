🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 <span>Welcome to the <span>Early <span>Learning <span>Childcare <span>Centre.<br/>
🎧 How may I help you?<br/>
🎧 Hi. I <span>spoke to you last week about <span>enrolling my <span>daughter for next year.<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes.<br/>
🎧 I'll just get some <span>details from you.<br/>
🎧 So, you're her <span>mother?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 And, can I have your name?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>Carol, <span>Carol <span>Smith.<br/>
🎧 And your <span>daughter's name?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>Kate.<br/>
🎧 Now, we have <span>several <span>groups at the <span>centre and we <span>cater for children from <span>three to <span>five years old.<br/>
🎧 How old is your <span>daughter?<br/>
🎧 She's <span>three now but she <span>turns <span>four next month.<br/>
🎧 I'll put <span>four down because that's how old she'll be when she <span>starts.<br/>
🎧 Fine, she's so <span>excited about her <span>birthday and <span>coming to the <span>centre.<br/>
🎧 <span>Aw, that's good to hear.<br/>
🎧 And what's your <span>address?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>46 <span>Wombat <span>Road,<br/>
🎧 that's <span>W-O-M-B-A-T.<br/>
🎧 <span>Woodside <span>4032.<br/>
🎧 And what's the phone number?<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh… <span>it's… <span>3345 <span>9865.<br/>
🎧 So, have you <span>decided on the <span>days you'd like to <span>bring your <span>daughter here?<br/>
🎧 I'd <span>prefer <span>Monday and <span>Wednesday if <span>possible.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mmm. I'll check,<br/>
🎧 <span>Monday's fine, but I think the <span>centre is already full for <span>Wednesday.<br/>
🎧 <span>Erm. Yes. Sorry. It <span>seems to be a very <span>popular day.<br/>
🎧 We can <span>offer you a <span>Thursday or a <span>Friday as well.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>dear.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose <span>Thursday would be all right because she has <span>swimming on <span>Friday.<br/>
🎧 OK, got that.<br/>
🎧 Because a lot of <span>parents work, we do <span>offer <span>flexible start and <span>finish <span>times.<br/>
🎧 We are open from <span>7:30 in the morning until <span>6 <span>o'clock at <span>night.<br/>
🎧 What time would you like your <span>daughter to start?<br/>
🎧 I need to get to work in the <span>city by <span>9:00 so I'll <span>drop her off at <span>8:30.<br/>
🎧 You're <span>pretty <span>close to the <span>city here so that should give me <span>plenty of time to get there.<br/>
🎧 That's fine.<br/>
🎧 Now, we also need to decide which group she'll be in.<br/>
🎧 we have two different <span>groups and they're <span>divided up <span>according to age.<br/>
🎧 There's the <span>green group.<br/>
🎧 Which is for <span>three- to <span>four-year-olds.<br/>
🎧 And then there's the red group which is for <span>four- to <span>five-year-olds.<br/>
🎧 She's quite <span>mature for her age and she can already <span>write her name and read a little.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'll put her in the red <span>group<br/>
🎧 and we can always change her to the <span>green one if there are any <span>problems.<br/>
🎧 That sounds fine.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Let's move on to <span>meals.<br/>
🎧 We can <span>provide <span>breakfast, lunch and dinner.<br/>
🎧 As she's <span>finishing <span>pretty <span>early, she won't need dinner,<br/>
🎧 will you give her <span>breakfast before she comes?<br/>
🎧 Yes, she'll only need lunch.<br/>
🎧 Now, does she have any <span>medical <span>conditions we need to know about?<br/>
🎧 Does she have <span>asthma or any <span>hearing <span>problems for example?<br/>
🎧 No. But she does need to <span>wear <span>glasses.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I'll make a <span>note of that.<br/>
🎧 Yes, she's <span>pretty good about <span>wearing them, she can't see much without them.<br/>
🎧 Right. OK.<br/>
🎧 Now, I also need <span>emergency <span>contact <span>details.<br/>
🎧 So what <span>sort of <span>information do you need?<br/>
🎧 Just the name and number of a friend or <span>family <span>member we can <span>contact in case we can't get <span>hold of you at any time.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 That'd better be my <span>sister… <span>Jenny <span>Ball.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>B-A-L-L.<br/>
🎧 Her phone number is <span>33467523.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 So she is the <span>child's <span>aunt?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's right.<br/>
🎧 I'll make a <span>note of that as well.<br/>
🎧 Now, is there anything you'd like to ask?<br/>
🎧 What about <span>payment?<br/>
🎧 How much are the <span>fees each <span>term?<br/>
🎧 Well, for two <span>days and the hours you've <span>chosen,<br/>
🎧 that will be <span>$450 <span>altogether.<br/>
🎧 OK, and do I have to pay that now?<br/>
🎧 No, we <span>send out <span>invoices once the children start at the <span>centre.<br/>
🎧 You can choose to pay at the end of each <span>term <span>or...<br/>
🎧 we do <span>offer a <span>slightly <span>discounted <span>rate if you pay every month.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I'll do that then.<br/>
🎧 I find it <span>easier to <span>budget that way and I'm not used to the <span>term <span>dates just yet.<br/>
🎧 Good, it makes it a lot <span>simpler for us as well.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's everything.<br/>
🎧 Would you like me to show you <span>around…?<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Today we're <span>pleased to have on the show <span>Alice <span>Bussell from the <span>Dolphin <span>Conservation <span>Trust.<br/>
🎧 Tell us about the <span>Trust, <span>Alice.<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>obviously its <span>purpose is to <span>protect <span>dolphins in <span>seas all around the <span>world.<br/>
🎧 It <span>tries to <span>raise <span>people's <span>awareness of the <span>problems these <span>marine <span>creatures are <span>suffering<br/>
🎧 because of <span>pollution and other <span>threats.<br/>
🎧 It <span>started ten years ago and it's one of the <span>fastest <span>growing <span>animal <span>charities in the <span>country <span>-<br/>
🎧 although it's still <span>fairly small <span>compared with the big <span>players in <span>animal <span>protection.<br/>
🎧 We are <span>particularly <span>proud of the work we do in <span>education <span>-<br/>
🎧 last year we <span>visited a <span>huge number of <span>schools in different <span>parts of the <span>country,<br/>
🎧 going <span>round to talk to children and young people <span>aged from <span>five to <span>eighteen.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact, about <span>thirty-five <span>per <span>cent of our <span>members are children.<br/>
🎧 The <span>charity <span>uses its money to <span>support <span>campaigns <span>-<br/>
🎧 for example, for changes in <span>fishing <span>policy and so <span>forth.<br/>
🎧 It <span>hopes soon to be able to <span>employ its first <span>full-time <span>biologist <span>- with <span>dolphin <span>expertise <span>- to <span>monitor <span>populations.<br/>
🎧 Of course, many people give their <span>services on a <span>voluntary <span>basis<br/>
🎧 and we now have <span>volunteers working in <span>observation, <span>office work and other things.<br/>
🎧 I should also tell you about the <span>award we <span>won from the <span>Charity <span>Commission last year <span>- for our work in <span>education.<br/>
🎧 Although it's not <span>meant an <span>enormous amount of money for us,<br/>
🎧 it has made our <span>activities even more <span>widely <span>publicised and <span>understood.<br/>
🎧 In the long <span>term it may not <span>bring in <span>extra <span>members<br/>
🎧 but we're <span>hoping it'll have this <span>effect.<br/>
🎧 Is it <span>possible to see <span>dolphins in <span>UK <span>waters?<br/>
🎧 Yes. In <span>several <span>locations.<br/>
🎧 And we have a big <span>project in the <span>east <span>part of <span>Scotland.<br/>
🎧 This has long been a <span>haven for <span>dolphins because it has very little <span>shipping.<br/>
🎧 <span>However, that may be about to change <span>soon<br/>
🎧 because oil <span>companies want to <span>increase <span>exploration there.<br/>
🎧 We're <span>campaigning <span>against <span>this<br/>
🎧 because, although <span>there'll be little <span>pollution from oil,<br/>
🎧 <span>exploration <span>creates a lot of <span>underwater <span>noise.<br/>
🎧 It <span>means the <span>dolphins can't <span>rest and <span>socialise.<br/>
🎧 This is how I <span>became interested in <span>dolphin <span>conservation in the first place.<br/>
🎧 I had never <span>seen one and I hadn't been <span>particularly interested in them at school.<br/>
🎧 Then I came across this <span>story about a <span>family of <span>dolphins who had to leave their home in the <span>Moray <span>Firth<br/>
🎧 because of the oil <span>companies and about a <span>child who <span>campaigned to <span>save them.<br/>
🎧 I couldn't put the book down <span>- I was <span>hooked.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure our <span>listeners will want to find out what they can do to help.<br/>
🎧 You <span>mentioned the <span>'Adopt a <span>Dolphin' <span>scheme.<br/>
🎧 Can you tell us about that?<br/>
🎧 Of course!<br/>
🎧 People can choose one of our <span>dolphins to <span>sponsor.<br/>
🎧 They <span>receive a <span>picture of it and <span>news <span>updates.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to tell you about <span>four which are <span>currently being <span>adopted by our <span>members:<br/>
🎧 <span>Moondancer, <span>Echo, <span>Kiwi and <span>Samson.<br/>
🎧 <span>Unfortunately, <span>Echo is being rather <span>elusive this year and hasn't yet been <span>sighted by our <span>observers<br/>
🎧 but we <span>remain <span>optimistic that he'll be out there soon.<br/>
🎧 All the <span>others have been out in <span>force <span>-<br/>
🎧 <span>Samson and <span>Moondancer are often <span>photographed <span>together<br/>
🎧 but it is <span>Kiwi who's our <span>real <span>'character' as she <span>seems to love <span>coming up <span>close for the <span>cameras<br/>
🎧 and we've <span>captured her on <span>film <span>hundreds of <span>times.<br/>
🎧 They all have their own <span>personalities <span>-<br/>
🎧 <span>Moondancer is very <span>elegant and <span>curves out and into the water very <span>smoothly,<br/>
🎧 <span>whereas <span>Samson has a lot of <span>energy <span>-<br/>
🎧 he's always <span>leaping out of the water with great <span>vigour.<br/>
🎧 You'd probably <span>expect him to be the <span>youngest <span>-<br/>
🎧 he's not quite <span>- that's <span>Kiwi <span>-<br/>
🎧 but <span>Samson's the <span>latest of our <span>dolphins to be <span>chosen for the <span>scheme.<br/>
🎧 <span>Kiwi makes a lot of <span>noise so we can often <span>pick her out <span>straightaway.<br/>
🎧 <span>Echo and <span>Moondancer are <span>noisy too,<br/>
🎧 but <span>Moondancer's easy to find because she has a <span>particularly large <span>fin on her back,<br/>
🎧 which makes her easy to <span>identify.<br/>
🎧 So, yes, they're all very <span>different…<br/>
🎧 Well, they sound a <span>fascinating <span>group…<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Hi, Rob. How's the course going?<br/>
🎧 Oh, hi, <span>Mia. Yeah, great.<br/>
🎧 I can't <span>believe the first <span>term's <span>nearly over.<br/>
🎧 I saw your <span>group's <span>performance last <span>night at the student <span>theatre.<br/>
🎧 It was good.<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 <span>Yeah… but now we have to <span>write a <span>report on the whole thing, an <span>in-depth <span>analysis.<br/>
🎧 I don't know where to start.<br/>
🎧 Like, I have to <span>write about the <span>role I <span>played, the <span>doctor, how I <span>developed the <span>character.<br/>
🎧 Well, what was your <span>starting <span>point?<br/>
🎧 My <span>grandfather was a <span>doctor before he <span>retired, and I just <span>based it on him.<br/>
🎧 OK, but how?<br/>
🎧 Did you talk to him about it?<br/>
🎧 He must have all <span>sorts of <span>stories, but he never says much about his work, even now.<br/>
🎧 He has a <span>sort of <span>authority though.<br/>
🎧 So how did you <span>manage to <span>capture that?<br/>
🎧 I'd <span>visualise what he must have been like in the <span>past,<br/>
🎧 when he was <span>sitting in his <span>consulting room <span>listening to his <span>patients.<br/>
🎧 OK, so that's what you <span>explain in your <span>report.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Then there's the issue of <span>atmosphere <span>-<br/>
🎧 so in the first <span>scene we <span>needed to know how <span>boring life was in the <span>doctor's <span>village in the <span>1950s,<br/>
🎧 so when the <span>curtain went up on the first <span>scene in the <span>waiting room,<br/>
🎧 there was that long <span>silence before <span>anyone <span>spoke.<br/>
🎧 And then people <span>kept saying the same thing over and over, like <span>'Cold, isn't <span>it?'<br/>
🎧 Yes, and everyone <span>wore <span>grey and <span>brown, and just <span>sat in a row.<br/>
🎧 Yes, all those <span>details of the <span>production.<br/>
🎧 And I have to <span>analyse how I <span>functioned in the group <span>-<br/>
🎧 what I <span>found out about myself.<br/>
🎧 I know I was so <span>frustrated at <span>times, when we couldn't agree.<br/>
🎧 Yes. So did one person <span>emerge as the <span>leader?<br/>
🎧 <span>Sophia did.<br/>
🎧 That was OK <span>- she <span>helped us work out exactly what to do, for the <span>production.<br/>
🎧 And that made me feel better, I <span>suppose.<br/>
🎧 When you <span>understood what <span>needed doing?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 And <span>Sophia did some <span>research, too.<br/>
🎧 That was useful in <span>developing our <span>approach.<br/>
🎧 Like what?<br/>
🎧 Well, she <span>found these <span>articles from the <span>1950s about how <span>relationships between children and their <span>parents,<br/>
🎧 or between the <span>public and people like <span>bank <span>managers or the <span>police were <span>shifting.<br/>
🎧 <span>Interesting.<br/>
🎧 And did you have any <span>practical <span>problems to <span>overcome?<br/>
🎧 Well, in the <span>final <span>rehearsal everything was going fine until the last <span>scene <span>-<br/>
🎧 that's where the <span>doctor's first <span>patient <span>appears on <span>stage on his own.<br/>
🎧 The one in the <span>wheelchair?<br/>
🎧 Yes, and he had this really long <span>speech, with the <span>stage all <span>dark <span>except for one <span>spotlight <span>-<br/>
🎧 and then that <span>stuck <span>somehow so it was <span>shining on the wrong side of the <span>stage…<br/>
🎧 but <span>anyway we got that <span>fixed, thank <span>goodness.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it was fine on the <span>night.<br/>
🎧 But while you're here, <span>Mia.<br/>
🎧 I wanted to ask you about the year <span>abroad option.<br/>
🎧 Would you <span>recommend doing that?<br/>
🎧 Yes, definitely.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>fantastic <span>chance to <span>study in another <span>country for a year.<br/>
🎧 I think I'd like to do it,<br/>
🎧 but it looks very <span>competitive <span>-<br/>
🎧 there's only a <span>limited number of <span>places.<br/>
🎧 Yes, so next year when you are in the second year of the course,<br/>
🎧 you need to work really <span>hard in all your <span>theatre <span>studies <span>modules.<br/>
🎧 Only students with good <span>marks get <span>places <span>-<br/>
🎧 you have to <span>prove that you know your <span>subject really well.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So how did you choose where to go?<br/>
🎧 Well, I <span>decided I wanted a <span>programme that would fit in with what I wanted to do after I <span>graduate,<br/>
🎧 so I <span>looked for a university with <span>emphasis on <span>acting rather than <span>directing for example.<br/>
🎧 It <span>depends on you.<br/>
🎧 Then about six <span>months before you go,<br/>
🎧 you have to <span>email the <span>scheme <span>coordinator with your top <span>three <span>choices.<br/>
🎧 I had a friend who <span>missed the <span>deadline and didn't get her first <span>choice,<br/>
🎧 so you do need to get a move on at that <span>stage.<br/>
🎧 You'll find that <span>certain <span>places are very <span>popular with everyone.<br/>
🎧 And don't you have to <span>write a personal <span>statement at that <span>stage?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I'll get some of the <span>final year students to give me some <span>tips…<br/>
🎧 maybe see if I can read what they <span>wrote.<br/>
🎧 I think that's a very good idea.<br/>
🎧 I don't <span>mind <span>showing you what I did.<br/>
🎧 And while you're <span>abroad don't make the <span>mistake I made.<br/>
🎧 I got so <span>involved I <span>forgot all about <span>making <span>arrangements for when I came back here for the <span>final year.<br/>
🎧 Make sure you <span>stay in touch so they know your <span>choices for the <span>optional <span>modules.<br/>
🎧 You don't want to <span>miss out doing your <span>preferred <span>specialisms.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Today, I want to talk about <span>self-regulatory focus <span>theory<br/>
🎧 and how the <span>actions of <span>leaders can <span>affect the way <span>followers <span>approach different <span>situations.<br/>
🎧 <span>Self-regulatory focus <span>theory is a <span>theory <span>developed by <span>Tori <span>Higgins.<br/>
🎧 He says that a <span>person's focus at any <span>given time is to either <span>approach <span>pleasure or <span>avoid <span>pain.<br/>
🎧 These are two <span>basic <span>motivations that each and every one of us has,<br/>
🎧 and they <span>cause us to have different <span>kinds of <span>goals.<br/>
🎧 <span>Promotion <span>goals in different life <span>situations <span>emphasise <span>achievement.<br/>
🎧 <span>Prevention <span>goals are <span>oriented <span>towards the <span>avoidance of <span>punishment.<br/>
🎧 In a <span>specific <span>situation,<br/>
🎧 our <span>thoughts might focus more on <span>promotion <span>goals or more on <span>prevention <span>goals.<br/>
🎧 The <span>theory <span>suggests that two <span>factors <span>affect which <span>goals we are <span>focusing on.<br/>
🎧 First, there is a <span>chronic <span>factor.<br/>
🎧 This <span>factor is <span>connected to a <span>person's <span>personality<br/>
🎧 and says that each person has a <span>basic <span>tendency to either focus more on <span>promotion <span>goals<br/>
🎧 or focus more on <span>prevention <span>goals as <span>part of his or her <span>personality.<br/>
🎧 Second, there is a <span>situational <span>factor<br/>
🎧 which <span>means that the <span>context we are in can make us more <span>likely to focus on one set of <span>goals or the other.<br/>
🎧 For example, we are more <span>likely to be thinking about <span>pleasure and to have <span>promotion <span>goals<br/>
🎧 when we are spending time with a friend.<br/>
🎧 In <span>contrast, if we are working on an important <span>project for our <span>boss,<br/>
🎧 we are more <span>likely to try to <span>avoid <span>making <span>mistakes<br/>
🎧 and <span>therefore have more <span>prevention <span>goals in our <span>mind.<br/>
🎧 <span>Research has <span>shown that the <span>goals we are <span>focusing on at a <span>given time <span>affect the way we think.<br/>
🎧 For example, when <span>focusing on <span>promotion <span>goals,<br/>
🎧 people <span>consider their <span>ideal <span>self, their <span>aspirations and <span>gains.<br/>
🎧 They don't think about what they can <span>lose,<br/>
🎧 so they think in a <span>happier <span>mode.<br/>
🎧 They feel more <span>inspired to change.<br/>
🎧 When people are <span>focusing on <span>prevention <span>goals,<br/>
🎧 they think about their <span>“ought” <span>self.<br/>
🎧 What are they <span>supposed to be?<br/>
🎧 What are people <span>expecting from them?<br/>
🎧 They <span>consider their <span>obligations to <span>others.<br/>
🎧 As a <span>result, they <span>experience more <span>anxiety and try to <span>avoid <span>situations where they could <span>lose.<br/>
🎧 Now that I have <span>talked about the two <span>focuses and how they <span>affect people,<br/>
🎧 I want to look at the idea that the way <span>leaders <span>behave, or their <span>style of <span>leading,<br/>
🎧 can <span>affect the focus that <span>followers <span>adopt in a <span>specific <span>situation.<br/>
🎧 In talking about <span>leadership,<br/>
🎧 we often <span>mention <span>transformational <span>leaders and <span>transactional <span>leaders.<br/>
🎧 <span>Transformational <span>leaders, when <span>interacting with their <span>followers, focus on their <span>development.<br/>
🎧 In their <span>words and <span>actions <span>transformational <span>leaders <span>highlight change.<br/>
🎧 Their <span>speech is <span>passionate and <span>conveys a <span>definitive <span>vision.<br/>
🎧 All of these things can <span>encourage <span>followers to think about what could be.<br/>
🎧 In other <span>words, they <span>inspire a <span>promotion focus in their <span>followers.<br/>
🎧 In <span>contrast, <span>transactional <span>leaders focus on <span>developing <span>clear <span>structures<br/>
🎧 that tell their <span>followers exactly what is <span>expected of them.<br/>
🎧 While they do <span>explain the <span>rewards people will get for <span>following <span>orders,<br/>
🎧 they <span>emphasise more how a <span>follower will be <span>punished<br/>
🎧 or that a <span>follower won't get <span>rewarded<br/>
🎧 if his or her <span>behaviour doesn't change.<br/>
🎧 In short, they <span>emphasise the <span>consequences of <span>making a <span>mistake.<br/>
🎧 This <span>emphasis will <span>clearly <span>lead <span>followers to focus on <span>avoiding <span>punishment and <span>problems.<br/>
🎧 This is <span>clearly a <span>prevention focus.<br/>
🎧 In <span>conclusion, it is important to <span>understand that one focus is not <span>necessarily better than the other one.<br/>
🎧 For a <span>designer who <span>works in a <span>field where a lot of <span>innovation is <span>needed,<br/>
🎧 a <span>promotion focus is probably better.<br/>
🎧 In <span>contrast, a <span>prevention focus which <span>causes people to work more <span>cautiously and <span>produce <span>higher <span>quality <span>work<br/>
🎧 might be very <span>appropriate for a <span>job like a <span>surgeon, for example.<br/>
🎧 The <span>main <span>point of the <span>research, though, is that the <span>actions of <span>leaders<br/>
🎧 can <span>greatly <span>influence <span>whether people <span>approach a <span>situation<br/>
🎧 with more of a <span>promotion focus or more of a <span>prevention focus.<br/>
