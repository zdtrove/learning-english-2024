🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 <span>Welcome</span> to the <span>Early</span> <span>Learning</span> <span>Childcare</span> <span>Centre</span>.<br/>
🎧 How may I help you?<br/>
🎧 Hi. I <span>spoke</span> to you last week about <span>enrolling</span> my <span>daughter</span> for next year.<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes.<br/>
🎧 I'll just get some <span>details</span> from you.<br/>
🎧 So, you're her <span>mother</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 And, can I have your name?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>Carol</span>, <span>Carol</span> <span>Smith</span>.<br/>
🎧 And your <span>daughter's</span> name?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>Kate</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, we have <span>several</span> <span>groups</span> at the <span>centre</span> and we <span>cater</span> for children from <span>three</span> to <span>five</span> years old.<br/>
🎧 How old is your <span>daughter</span>?<br/>
🎧 She's <span>three</span> now but she <span>turns</span> <span>four</span> next month.<br/>
🎧 I'll put <span>four</span> down because that's how old she'll be when she <span>starts</span>.<br/>
🎧 Fine, she's so <span>excited</span> about her <span>birthday</span> and <span>coming</span> to the <span>centre</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Aw</span>, that's good to hear.<br/>
🎧 And what's your <span>address</span>?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>46</span> <span>Wombat</span> <span>Road</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's <span>W-O-M-B-A-T</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Woodside</span> <span>4032</span>.<br/>
🎧 And what's the phone number?<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh…</span> <span>it's…</span> <span>3345</span> <span>9865</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, have you <span>decided</span> on the <span>days</span> you'd like to <span>bring</span> your <span>daughter</span> here?<br/>
🎧 I'd <span>prefer</span> <span>Monday</span> and <span>Wednesday</span> if <span>possible</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mmm</span>. I'll check,<br/>
🎧 <span>Monday's</span> fine, but I think the <span>centre</span> is already full for <span>Wednesday</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Erm</span>. Yes. Sorry. It <span>seems</span> to be a very <span>popular</span> day.<br/>
🎧 We can <span>offer</span> you a <span>Thursday</span> or a <span>Friday</span> as well.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>dear</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> <span>Thursday</span> would be all right because she has <span>swimming</span> on <span>Friday</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, got that.<br/>
🎧 Because a lot of <span>parents</span> work, we do <span>offer</span> <span>flexible</span> start and <span>finish</span> <span>times</span>.<br/>
🎧 We are open from <span>7:30</span> in the morning until <span>6</span> <span>o'clock</span> at <span>night</span>.<br/>
🎧 What time would you like your <span>daughter</span> to start?<br/>
🎧 I need to get to work in the <span>city</span> by <span>9:00</span> so I'll <span>drop</span> her off at <span>8:30</span>.<br/>
🎧 You're <span>pretty</span> <span>close</span> to the <span>city</span> here so that should give me <span>plenty</span> of time to get there.<br/>
🎧 That's fine.<br/>
🎧 Now, we also need to decide which group she'll be in.<br/>
🎧 we have two different <span>groups</span> and they're <span>divided</span> up <span>according</span> to age.<br/>
🎧 There's the <span>green</span> group.<br/>
🎧 Which is for <span>three-</span> to <span>four-year-olds</span>.<br/>
🎧 And then there's the red group which is for <span>four-</span> to <span>five-year-olds</span>.<br/>
🎧 She's quite <span>mature</span> for her age and she can already <span>write</span> her name and read a little.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'll put her in the red <span>group<br/></span>
🎧 and we can always change her to the <span>green</span> one if there are any <span>problems</span>.<br/>
🎧 That sounds fine.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Let's move on to <span>meals</span>.<br/>
🎧 We can <span>provide</span> <span>breakfast</span>, lunch and dinner.<br/>
🎧 As she's <span>finishing</span> <span>pretty</span> <span>early</span>, she won't need dinner,<br/>
🎧 will you give her <span>breakfast</span> before she comes?<br/>
🎧 Yes, she'll only need lunch.<br/>
🎧 Now, does she have any <span>medical</span> <span>conditions</span> we need to know about?<br/>
🎧 Does she have <span>asthma</span> or any <span>hearing</span> <span>problems</span> for example?<br/>
🎧 No. But she does need to <span>wear</span> <span>glasses</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I'll make a <span>note</span> of that.<br/>
🎧 Yes, she's <span>pretty</span> good about <span>wearing</span> them, she can't see much without them.<br/>
🎧 Right. OK.<br/>
🎧 Now, I also need <span>emergency</span> <span>contact</span> <span>details</span>.<br/>
🎧 So what <span>sort</span> of <span>information</span> do you need?<br/>
🎧 Just the name and number of a friend or <span>family</span> <span>member</span> we can <span>contact</span> in case we can't get <span>hold</span> of you at any time.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 That'd better be my <span>sister…</span> <span>Jenny</span> <span>Ball</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>B-A-L-L</span>.<br/>
🎧 Her phone number is <span>33467523</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 So she is the <span>child's</span> <span>aunt</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's right.<br/>
🎧 I'll make a <span>note</span> of that as well.<br/>
🎧 Now, is there anything you'd like to ask?<br/>
🎧 What about <span>payment</span>?<br/>
🎧 How much are the <span>fees</span> each <span>term</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, for two <span>days</span> and the hours you've <span>chosen</span>,<br/>
🎧 that will be <span>$450</span> <span>altogether</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, and do I have to pay that now?<br/>
🎧 No, we <span>send</span> out <span>invoices</span> once the children start at the <span>centre</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can choose to pay at the end of each <span>term</span> <span>or..</span>.<br/>
🎧 we do <span>offer</span> a <span>slightly</span> <span>discounted</span> <span>rate</span> if you pay every month.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I'll do that then.<br/>
🎧 I find it <span>easier</span> to <span>budget</span> that way and I'm not used to the <span>term</span> <span>dates</span> just yet.<br/>
🎧 Good, it makes it a lot <span>simpler</span> for us as well.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's everything.<br/>
🎧 Would you like me to show you <span>around…</span>?<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Today we're <span>pleased</span> to have on the show <span>Alice</span> <span>Bussell</span> from the <span>Dolphin</span> <span>Conservation</span> <span>Trust</span>.<br/>
🎧 Tell us about the <span>Trust</span>, <span>Alice</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>obviously</span> its <span>purpose</span> is to <span>protect</span> <span>dolphins</span> in <span>seas</span> all around the <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>tries</span> to <span>raise</span> <span>people's</span> <span>awareness</span> of the <span>problems</span> these <span>marine</span> <span>creatures</span> are <span>suffering<br/></span>
🎧 because of <span>pollution</span> and other <span>threats</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>started</span> ten years ago and it's one of the <span>fastest</span> <span>growing</span> <span>animal</span> <span>charities</span> in the <span>country</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 although it's still <span>fairly</span> small <span>compared</span> with the big <span>players</span> in <span>animal</span> <span>protection</span>.<br/>
🎧 We are <span>particularly</span> <span>proud</span> of the work we do in <span>education</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 last year we <span>visited</span> a <span>huge</span> number of <span>schools</span> in different <span>parts</span> of the <span>country</span>,<br/>
🎧 going <span>round</span> to talk to children and young people <span>aged</span> from <span>five</span> to <span>eighteen</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, about <span>thirty-five</span> <span>per</span> <span>cent</span> of our <span>members</span> are children.<br/>
🎧 The <span>charity</span> <span>uses</span> its money to <span>support</span> <span>campaigns</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 for example, for changes in <span>fishing</span> <span>policy</span> and so <span>forth</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>hopes</span> soon to be able to <span>employ</span> its first <span>full-time</span> <span>biologist</span> <span>-</span> with <span>dolphin</span> <span>expertise</span> <span>-</span> to <span>monitor</span> <span>populations</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course, many people give their <span>services</span> on a <span>voluntary</span> <span>basis<br/></span>
🎧 and we now have <span>volunteers</span> working in <span>observation</span>, <span>office</span> work and other things.<br/>
🎧 I should also tell you about the <span>award</span> we <span>won</span> from the <span>Charity</span> <span>Commission</span> last year <span>-</span> for our work in <span>education</span>.<br/>
🎧 Although it's not <span>meant</span> an <span>enormous</span> amount of money for us,<br/>
🎧 it has made our <span>activities</span> even more <span>widely</span> <span>publicised</span> and <span>understood</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the long <span>term</span> it may not <span>bring</span> in <span>extra</span> <span>members<br/></span>
🎧 but we're <span>hoping</span> it'll have this <span>effect</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is it <span>possible</span> to see <span>dolphins</span> in <span>UK</span> <span>waters</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes. In <span>several</span> <span>locations</span>.<br/>
🎧 And we have a big <span>project</span> in the <span>east</span> <span>part</span> of <span>Scotland</span>.<br/>
🎧 This has long been a <span>haven</span> for <span>dolphins</span> because it has very little <span>shipping</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, that may be about to change <span>soon<br/></span>
🎧 because oil <span>companies</span> want to <span>increase</span> <span>exploration</span> there.<br/>
🎧 We're <span>campaigning</span> <span>against</span> <span>this<br/></span>
🎧 because, although <span>there'll</span> be little <span>pollution</span> from oil,<br/>
🎧 <span>exploration</span> <span>creates</span> a lot of <span>underwater</span> <span>noise</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>means</span> the <span>dolphins</span> can't <span>rest</span> and <span>socialise</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is how I <span>became</span> interested in <span>dolphin</span> <span>conservation</span> in the first place.<br/>
🎧 I had never <span>seen</span> one and I hadn't been <span>particularly</span> interested in them at school.<br/>
🎧 Then I came across this <span>story</span> about a <span>family</span> of <span>dolphins</span> who had to leave their home in the <span>Moray</span> <span>Firth<br/></span>
🎧 because of the oil <span>companies</span> and about a <span>child</span> who <span>campaigned</span> to <span>save</span> them.<br/>
🎧 I couldn't put the book down <span>-</span> I was <span>hooked</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure our <span>listeners</span> will want to find out what they can do to help.<br/>
🎧 You <span>mentioned</span> the <span>'Adopt</span> a <span>Dolphin'</span> <span>scheme</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can you tell us about that?<br/>
🎧 Of course!<br/>
🎧 People can choose one of our <span>dolphins</span> to <span>sponsor</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>receive</span> a <span>picture</span> of it and <span>news</span> <span>updates</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to tell you about <span>four</span> which are <span>currently</span> being <span>adopted</span> by our <span>members:<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Moondancer</span>, <span>Echo</span>, <span>Kiwi</span> and <span>Samson</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Unfortunately</span>, <span>Echo</span> is being rather <span>elusive</span> this year and hasn't yet been <span>sighted</span> by our <span>observers<br/></span>
🎧 but we <span>remain</span> <span>optimistic</span> that he'll be out there soon.<br/>
🎧 All the <span>others</span> have been out in <span>force</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Samson</span> and <span>Moondancer</span> are often <span>photographed</span> <span>together<br/></span>
🎧 but it is <span>Kiwi</span> who's our <span>real</span> <span>'character'</span> as she <span>seems</span> to love <span>coming</span> up <span>close</span> for the <span>cameras<br/></span>
🎧 and we've <span>captured</span> her on <span>film</span> <span>hundreds</span> of <span>times</span>.<br/>
🎧 They all have their own <span>personalities</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Moondancer</span> is very <span>elegant</span> and <span>curves</span> out and into the water very <span>smoothly</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>whereas</span> <span>Samson</span> has a lot of <span>energy</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 he's always <span>leaping</span> out of the water with great <span>vigour</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'd probably <span>expect</span> him to be the <span>youngest</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 he's not quite <span>-</span> that's <span>Kiwi</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 but <span>Samson's</span> the <span>latest</span> of our <span>dolphins</span> to be <span>chosen</span> for the <span>scheme</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Kiwi</span> makes a lot of <span>noise</span> so we can often <span>pick</span> her out <span>straightaway</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Echo</span> and <span>Moondancer</span> are <span>noisy</span> too,<br/>
🎧 but <span>Moondancer's</span> easy to find because she has a <span>particularly</span> large <span>fin</span> on her back,<br/>
🎧 which makes her easy to <span>identify</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, yes, they're all very <span>different…<br/></span>
🎧 Well, they sound a <span>fascinating</span> <span>group…<br/>
</span> <span><br/>

🎧 Hi, Rob. How's the course going?<br/>
🎧 Oh, hi, <span>Mia</span>. Yeah, great.<br/>
🎧 I can't <span>believe</span> the first <span>term's</span> <span>nearly</span> over.<br/>
🎧 I saw your <span>group's</span> <span>performance</span> last <span>night</span> at the student <span>theatre</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was good.<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 <span>Yeah…</span> but now we have to <span>write</span> a <span>report</span> on the whole thing, an <span>in-depth</span> <span>analysis</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't know where to start.<br/>
🎧 Like, I have to <span>write</span> about the <span>role</span> I <span>played</span>, the <span>doctor</span>, how I <span>developed</span> the <span>character</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, what was your <span>starting</span> <span>point</span>?<br/>
🎧 My <span>grandfather</span> was a <span>doctor</span> before he <span>retired</span>, and I just <span>based</span> it on him.<br/>
🎧 OK, but how?<br/>
🎧 Did you talk to him about it?<br/>
🎧 He must have all <span>sorts</span> of <span>stories</span>, but he never says much about his work, even now.<br/>
🎧 He has a <span>sort</span> of <span>authority</span> though.<br/>
🎧 So how did you <span>manage</span> to <span>capture</span> that?<br/>
🎧 I'd <span>visualise</span> what he must have been like in the <span>past</span>,<br/>
🎧 when he was <span>sitting</span> in his <span>consulting</span> room <span>listening</span> to his <span>patients</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, so that's what you <span>explain</span> in your <span>report</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Then there's the issue of <span>atmosphere</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 so in the first <span>scene</span> we <span>needed</span> to know how <span>boring</span> life was in the <span>doctor's</span> <span>village</span> in the <span>1950s</span>,<br/>
🎧 so when the <span>curtain</span> went up on the first <span>scene</span> in the <span>waiting</span> room,<br/>
🎧 there was that long <span>silence</span> before <span>anyone</span> <span>spoke</span>.<br/>
🎧 And then people <span>kept</span> saying the same thing over and over, like <span>'Cold</span>, isn't <span>it?'<br/></span>
🎧 Yes, and everyone <span>wore</span> <span>grey</span> and <span>brown</span>, and just <span>sat</span> in a row.<br/>
🎧 Yes, all those <span>details</span> of the <span>production</span>.<br/>
🎧 And I have to <span>analyse</span> how I <span>functioned</span> in the group <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 what I <span>found</span> out about myself.<br/>
🎧 I know I was so <span>frustrated</span> at <span>times</span>, when we couldn't agree.<br/>
🎧 Yes. So did one person <span>emerge</span> as the <span>leader</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Sophia</span> did.<br/>
🎧 That was OK <span>-</span> she <span>helped</span> us work out exactly what to do, for the <span>production</span>.<br/>
🎧 And that made me feel better, I <span>suppose</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you <span>understood</span> what <span>needed</span> doing?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 And <span>Sophia</span> did some <span>research</span>, too.<br/>
🎧 That was <span>useful</span> in <span>developing</span> our <span>approach</span>.<br/>
🎧 Like what?<br/>
🎧 Well, she <span>found</span> these <span>articles</span> from the <span>1950s</span> about how <span>relationships</span> between children and their <span>parents</span>,<br/>
🎧 or between the <span>public</span> and people like <span>bank</span> <span>managers</span> or the <span>police</span> were <span>shifting</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 And did you have any <span>practical</span> <span>problems</span> to <span>overcome</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, in the <span>final</span> <span>rehearsal</span> everything was going fine until the last <span>scene</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 that's where the <span>doctor's</span> first <span>patient</span> <span>appears</span> on <span>stage</span> on his own.<br/>
🎧 The one in the <span>wheelchair</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, and he had this really long <span>speech</span>, with the <span>stage</span> all <span>dark</span> <span>except</span> for one <span>spotlight</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and then that <span>stuck</span> <span>somehow</span> so it was <span>shining</span> on the wrong side of the <span>stage…<br/></span>
🎧 but <span>anyway</span> we got that <span>fixed</span>, thank <span>goodness</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it was fine on the <span>night</span>.<br/>
🎧 But while you're here, <span>Mia</span>.<br/>
🎧 I wanted to ask you about the year <span>abroad</span> option.<br/>
🎧 Would you <span>recommend</span> doing that?<br/>
🎧 Yes, definitely.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>fantastic</span> <span>chance</span> to <span>study</span> in another <span>country</span> for a year.<br/>
🎧 I think I'd like to do it,<br/>
🎧 but it looks very <span>competitive</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 there's only a <span>limited</span> number of <span>places</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, so next year when you are in the second year of the course,<br/>
🎧 you need to work really <span>hard</span> in all your <span>theatre</span> <span>studies</span> <span>modules</span>.<br/>
🎧 Only students with good <span>marks</span> get <span>places</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 you have to <span>prove</span> that you know your <span>subject</span> really well.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So how did you choose where to go?<br/>
🎧 Well, I <span>decided</span> I wanted a <span>programme</span> that would fit in with what I wanted to do after I <span>graduate</span>,<br/>
🎧 so I <span>looked</span> for a university with <span>emphasis</span> on <span>acting</span> rather than <span>directing</span> for example.<br/>
🎧 It <span>depends</span> on you.<br/>
🎧 Then about six <span>months</span> before you go,<br/>
🎧 you have to <span>email</span> the <span>scheme</span> <span>coordinator</span> with your top <span>three</span> <span>choices</span>.<br/>
🎧 I had a friend who <span>missed</span> the <span>deadline</span> and didn't get her first <span>choice</span>,<br/>
🎧 so you do need to get a move on at that <span>stage</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll find that <span>certain</span> <span>places</span> are very <span>popular</span> with everyone.<br/>
🎧 And don't you have to <span>write</span> a personal <span>statement</span> at that <span>stage</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I'll get some of the <span>final</span> year students to give me some <span>tips…<br/></span>
🎧 maybe see if I can read what they <span>wrote</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think that's a very good idea.<br/>
🎧 I don't <span>mind</span> <span>showing</span> you what I did.<br/>

🎧 Today, I want to talk about <span>self-regulatory</span> focus <span>theory<br/></span>
🎧 and how the <span>actions</span> of <span>leaders</span> can <span>affect</span> the way <span>followers</span> <span>approach</span> different <span>situations</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Self-regulatory</span> focus <span>theory</span> is a <span>theory</span> <span>developed</span> by <span>Tori</span> <span>Higgins</span>.<br/>
🎧 He says that a <span>person's</span> focus at any <span>given</span> time is to either <span>approach</span> <span>pleasure</span> or <span>avoid</span> <span>pain</span>.<br/>
🎧 These are two <span>basic</span> <span>motivations</span> that each and every one of us has,<br/>
🎧 and they <span>cause</span> us to have different <span>kinds</span> of <span>goals</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Promotion</span> <span>goals</span> in different life <span>situations</span> <span>emphasise</span> <span>achievement</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Prevention</span> <span>goals</span> are <span>oriented</span> <span>towards</span> the <span>avoidance</span> of <span>punishment</span>.<br/>
🎧 In a <span>specific</span> <span>situation</span>,<br/>
🎧 our <span>thoughts</span> might focus more on <span>promotion</span> <span>goals</span> or more on <span>prevention</span> <span>goals</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>theory</span> <span>suggests</span> that two <span>factors</span> <span>affect</span> which <span>goals</span> we are <span>focusing</span> on.<br/>
🎧 First, there is a <span>chronic</span> <span>factor</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>factor</span> is <span>connected</span> to a <span>person's</span> <span>personality<br/></span>
🎧 and says that each person has a <span>basic</span> <span>tendency</span> to either focus more on <span>promotion</span> <span>goals<br/></span>
🎧 or focus more on <span>prevention</span> <span>goals</span> as <span>part</span> of his or her <span>personality</span>.<br/>
🎧 Second, there is a <span>situational</span> <span>factor<br/></span>
🎧 which <span>means</span> that the <span>context</span> we are in can make us more <span>likely</span> to focus on one set of <span>goals</span> or the other.<br/>
🎧 For example, we are more <span>likely</span> to be thinking about <span>pleasure</span> and to have <span>promotion</span> <span>goals<br/></span>
🎧 when we are spending time with a friend.<br/>
🎧 In <span>contrast</span>, if we are working on an important <span>project</span> for our <span>boss</span>,<br/>
🎧 we are more <span>likely</span> to try to <span>avoid</span> <span>making</span> <span>mistakes<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>therefore</span> have more <span>prevention</span> <span>goals</span> in our <span>mind</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Research</span> has <span>shown</span> that the <span>goals</span> we are <span>focusing</span> on at a <span>given</span> time <span>affect</span> the way we think.<br/>
🎧 For example, when <span>focusing</span> on <span>promotion</span> <span>goals</span>,<br/>
🎧 people <span>consider</span> their <span>ideal</span> <span>self</span>, their <span>aspirations</span> and <span>gains</span>.<br/>
🎧 They don't think about what they can <span>lose</span>,<br/>
🎧 so they think in a <span>happier</span> <span>mode</span>.<br/>
🎧 They feel more <span>inspired</span> to change.<br/>
🎧 When people are <span>focusing</span> on <span>prevention</span> <span>goals</span>,<br/>
🎧 they think about their <span>“ought”</span> <span>self</span>.<br/>
🎧 What are they <span>supposed</span> to be?<br/>
🎧 What are people <span>expecting</span> from them?<br/>
🎧 They <span>consider</span> their <span>obligations</span> to <span>others</span>.<br/>
🎧 As a <span>result</span>, they <span>experience</span> more <span>anxiety</span> and try to <span>avoid</span> <span>situations</span> where they could <span>lose</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now that I have <span>talked</span> about the two <span>focuses</span> and how they <span>affect</span> people,<br/>
🎧 I want to look at the idea that the way <span>leaders</span> <span>behave</span>, or their <span>style</span> of <span>leading</span>,<br/>
🎧 can <span>affect</span> the focus that <span>followers</span> <span>adopt</span> in a <span>specific</span> <span>situation</span>.<br/>
🎧 In talking about <span>leadership</span>,<br/>
🎧 we often <span>mention</span> <span>transformational</span> <span>leaders</span> and <span>transactional</span> <span>leaders</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Transformational</span> <span>leaders</span>, when <span>interacting</span> with their <span>followers</span>, focus on their <span>development</span>.<br/>
🎧 In their <span>words</span> and <span>actions</span> <span>transformational</span> <span>leaders</span> <span>highlight</span> change.<br/>
🎧 Their <span>speech</span> is <span>passionate</span> and <span>conveys</span> a <span>definitive</span> <span>vision</span>.<br/>
🎧 All of these things can <span>encourage</span> <span>followers</span> to think about what could be.<br/>
🎧 In other <span>words</span>, they <span>inspire</span> a <span>promotion</span> focus in their <span>followers</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>contrast</span>, <span>transactional</span> <span>leaders</span> focus on <span>developing</span> <span>clear</span> <span>structures<br/></span>
🎧 that tell their <span>followers</span> exactly what is <span>expected</span> of them.<br/>
🎧 While they do <span>explain</span> the <span>rewards</span> people will get for <span>following</span> <span>orders</span>,<br/>
🎧 they <span>emphasise</span> more how a <span>follower</span> will be <span>punished<br/></span>
🎧 or that a <span>follower</span> won't get <span>rewarded<br/></span>
🎧 if his or her <span>behaviour</span> doesn't change.<br/>
🎧 In short, they <span>emphasise</span> the <span>consequences</span> of <span>making</span> a <span>mistake</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>emphasis</span> will <span>clearly</span> <span>lead</span> <span>followers</span> to focus on <span>avoiding</span> <span>punishment</span> and <span>problems</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is <span>clearly</span> a <span>prevention</span> focus.<br/>
🎧 In <span>conclusion</span>, it is important to <span>understand</span> that one focus is not <span>necessarily</span> better than the other one.<br/>
🎧 For a <span>designer</span> who <span>works</span> in a <span>field</span> where a lot of <span>innovation</span> is <span>needed</span>,<br/>
🎧 a <span>promotion</span> focus is probably better.<br/>
🎧 In <span>contrast</span>, a <span>prevention</span> focus which <span>causes</span> people to work more <span>cautiously</span> and <span>produce</span> <span>higher</span> <span>quality</span> <span>work<br/></span>
🎧 might be very <span>appropriate</span> for a <span>job</span> like a <span>surgeon</span>, for example.<br/>
🎧 The <span>main</span> <span>point</span> of the <span>research</span>, though, is that the <span>actions</span> of <span>leaders<br/></span>
🎧 can <span>greatly</span> <span>influence</span> <span>whether</span> people <span>approach</span> a <span>situation<br/></span>
🎧 with more of a <span>promotion</span> focus or more of a <span>prevention</span> focus.<br/>
