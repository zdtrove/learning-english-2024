🎧 Hello, <span>Linda</span> <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh hi, <span>Linda</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is <span>Matt</span> <span>Brooks</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Alex</span> <span>White</span> gave me your number.<br/>
🎧 He said you'd be able to give me some advice about <span>moving</span> to <span>Banford</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, <span>Alex</span> did <span>mention</span> you.<br/>
🎧 How can I help?<br/>
🎧 Well, first of all <span>-</span> which <span>area</span> to live in?<br/>
🎧 Well, I live in <span>Dalton</span>, which is a really nice <span>suburb</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 not too <span>expensive</span>, and there's a nice <span>park</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sounds good.<br/>
🎧 Do you know how much it would be to <span>rent</span> a two <span>bedroom</span> <span>flat</span> there?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, you should be able to get something <span>reasonable</span> for <span>850</span> <span>pounds</span> <span>per</span> month.<br/>
🎧 That's what people <span>typically</span> pay.<br/>
🎧 You <span>certainly</span> wouldn't want to pay more than <span>900</span> <span>pounds</span>.<br/>
🎧 That doesn't <span>include</span> <span>bills</span> or anything.<br/>
🎧 No. That sounds alright.<br/>
🎧 I'll definitely have a look there.<br/>
🎧 Are the <span>transport</span> <span>links</span> easy from where you live?<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm very <span>lucky</span>.<br/>
🎧 I work in the <span>city</span> <span>centre</span> so I don't have to use <span>public</span> <span>transport</span>.<br/>
🎧 I go by <span>bike</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I wish I could do that.<br/>
🎧 Is it <span>safe</span> to <span>cycle</span> around the <span>city</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's fine.<br/>
🎧 And it <span>keeps</span> me fit.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, driving to work in the <span>city</span> <span>centre</span> would be a <span>nightmare<br/></span>
🎧 because there's <span>hardly</span> any <span>parking</span>.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>traffic</span> during the <span>rush</span> <span>hour</span> can be bad.<br/>
🎧 I'd be working from <span>home<br/></span>
🎧 but I'd have to go to <span>London</span> one or two <span>days</span> a week.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's perfect.<br/>
🎧 Getting to <span>London</span> is no <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>fast</span> <span>train</span> every <span>30</span> <span>minutes</span> which only takes <span>45</span> <span>minutes</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's good.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, the <span>train</span> <span>service</span> isn't bad during the week.<br/>
🎧 And they run quite <span>late</span> at <span>night</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>weekends</span> that are a <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're always doing <span>engineering</span> <span>work<br/></span>
🎧 and you have to take a bus to <span>Hadham<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>pick</span> up the <span>train</span> there, which is really <span>slow</span>.<br/>
🎧 But other than that, <span>Banford's</span> a great place to live.<br/>
🎧 I've never been <span>happier</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are some nice <span>restaurants</span> in the <span>city</span> <span>centre<br/></span>
🎧 and a <span>brand</span> new <span>cinema</span> which has only been open a <span>couple</span> of <span>months</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's a good <span>arts</span> <span>centre</span> too.<br/>
🎧 Sounds like <span>Banford's</span> got it all.<br/>
🎧 Yes! We're really <span>lucky</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are lots of really good <span>aspects</span> to living here.<br/>
🎧 The <span>schools</span> are <span>good<br/></span>
🎧 and the <span>hospital</span> here is one of the best in the <span>country</span>.<br/>
🎧 Everyone I know who's been there's had a <span>positive</span> <span>experience</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I can give you the name of my <span>dentist</span> too in <span>Bridge</span> <span>Street</span>,<br/>
🎧 if you're interested.<br/>
🎧 I've been going to him for years and I've never had any <span>problems</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, OK. Thanks!<br/>
🎧 I'll find his number and <span>send</span> it to you.<br/>
🎧 Thanks, that would be really <span>helpful</span>.<br/>
🎧 Are you planning to visit <span>Banford</span> soon?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 My <span>wife</span> and I are both <span>coming</span> next week.<br/>
🎧 We want to make some <span>appointments</span> with <span>estate</span> <span>agents</span>.<br/>
🎧 I could meet you if you like and show you around.<br/>
🎧 Are you sure?<br/>
🎧 We'd really <span>appreciate</span> that.<br/>
🎧 Either a <span>Tuesday</span> or <span>Thursday</span> is good for me, after <span>5.30</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Thursday's</span> <span>preferable</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Tuesday</span> I need to get home before <span>6</span> pm.<br/>
🎧 Okay great.<br/>
🎧 Let me know which <span>train</span> you're <span>catching<br/></span>
🎧 and I'll meet you in the <span>cafe</span> outside.<br/>
🎧 You can't <span>miss</span> it.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>opposite</span> the <span>station</span> and next to the <span>museum</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Brilliant</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll <span>text</span> you next week then.<br/>
🎧 Thanks so much for all the advice.<br/>
🎧 No <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll see you next week.<br/>
<br />

🎧 So if you are one of those people who hasn't <span>found</span> the perfect <span>physical</span> <span>activity</span> yet,<br/>
🎧 here are some things to think about which might help you make the right <span>decision</span> for you.<br/>
🎧 The first <span>question</span> to ask yourself is <span>whether</span> you would enjoy <span>training</span> in a gym.<br/>
🎧 Many people are put off by the idea of having to fit a visit to the gym into their <span>busy</span> day.<br/>
🎧 You often have to go very <span>early</span> or <span>late</span> as some <span>gyms</span> can get very <span>crowded<br/></span>
🎧 but with <span>regular</span> <span>training</span> you'll see a big <span>difference</span> in a <span>relatively</span> short <span>space</span> of time.<br/>
🎧 <span>Running</span> has become <span>incredibly</span> <span>popular</span> in <span>recent</span> years.<br/>
🎧 That's probably got a lot to do with the <span>fact</span> that it's a very <span>accessible</span> <span>form</span> of <span>exercise<br/></span>
🎧 that <span>anyone</span> can run even if you could only run a few <span>meters</span> to <span>begin</span> with.<br/>
🎧 But make sure you get the right <span>shoes</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>worth</span> <span>investing</span> in a high <span>quality</span> <span>pair</span> and they don't come <span>cheap</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another great thing about <span>running</span> is that you can do it at any time of day or <span>night</span>.<br/>
🎧 The only thing that may <span>stop</span> you is <span>snow</span> and ice.<br/>
🎧 <span>Swimming</span> is another really good way to <span>build</span> <span>fitness</span>.<br/>
🎧 What <span>attracts</span> many people is that you can <span>swim</span> in an <span>indoor</span> <span>pool</span> at any time of year.<br/>
🎧 On the other <span>hand</span>, it can be quite <span>boring</span> or <span>solitary</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>hard</span> to <span>chat</span> to people while you're <span>swimming</span> <span>lengths</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Cycling</span> has become almost as <span>popular</span> as <span>running</span> in <span>recent</span> years.<br/>
🎧 That's probably because as well as <span>improving</span> their <span>fitness<br/></span>
🎧 many people say being out in the <span>fresh</span> air in a <span>park</span> or in the <span>countryside</span> can be fun,<br/>
🎧 <span>provided</span> the <span>conditions</span> are right of course.<br/>
🎧 Only <span>fanatics</span> go out in the <span>wind</span> and <span>rain</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yoga</span> is a good <span>choice</span> for those of you looking for <span>exercise</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>focuses</span> on <span>developing</span> both a <span>healthy</span> <span>mind</span> and <span>body</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a good way of <span>building</span> <span>strength<br/></span>
🎧 and with the right <span>instructor</span> there's less <span>chance</span> of <span>hurting</span> yourself than with other more <span>active</span> <span>sports</span>.<br/>
🎧 But don't <span>expect</span> to find it easy.<br/>
🎧 It can be <span>surprisingly</span> <span>challenging</span>, <span>especially</span> for people who aren't very <span>flexible</span>.<br/>
🎧 Getting a personal <span>trainer</span> is a good way to start your <span>fitness</span> <span>program</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Obviously</span> there can be <span>significant</span> <span>costs</span> <span>involved</span>.<br/>
🎧 But if you've got <span>someone</span> there to <span>encourage</span> you and help you <span>achieve</span> your <span>goals</span>,<br/>
🎧 you're less <span>likely</span> to give up.<br/>
🎧 Make sure you get <span>someone</span> with a <span>recognised</span> <span>qualification</span> though.<br/>
🎧 Or you could do yourself <span>permanent</span> <span>damage</span>.<br/>
🎧 Whatever you do, don't join a gym <span>unless</span> you're sure you'll make good use of it.<br/>
🎧 So many people <span>waste</span> lots of money by <span>signing</span> up for <span>membership</span> and then <span>hardly</span> ever go.<br/>
🎧 What <span>happens</span> to their good <span>intentions</span>?<br/>
🎧 I don't think people <span>suddenly</span> <span>stop</span> <span>caring</span> about <span>improving</span> their <span>fitness<br/></span>
🎧 or decide they have more important things to do.<br/>
🎧 I think people <span>lose</span> <span>interest</span> when they don't think they're <span>making</span> enough <span>progress</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's when they give up hope and <span>stop</span> <span>believing</span> they'll ever <span>achieve</span> their <span>goals</span>.<br/>
🎧 Also, what people sometimes don't <span>realize</span> when they <span>start<br/></span>
🎧 is that it takes a lot of <span>determination</span> and <span>hard</span> work to keep <span>training</span> week after week,<br/>
🎧 and lots of people don't have that kind of <span>commitment</span>.<br/>
🎧 One thing you can do to help yourself is to set <span>manageable</span> <span>goals</span>,<br/>
🎧 be <span>realistic</span> and don't <span>push</span> yourself too <span>far</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some people <span>advise</span> <span>writing</span> <span>goals</span> <span>down<br/></span>
🎧 but I think it's better to have a <span>flexible</span> <span>approach</span>.<br/>
🎧 Give yourself a really nice <span>treat</span> every time you <span>reach</span> one of your <span>goals<br/></span>
🎧 and don't get too <span>upset</span> if you <span>experience</span> <span>setbacks</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>journey</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>bound</span> to be <span>difficulties</span> along the way.<br/>
<br />

🎧 OK, <span>Jim</span>.<br/>
🎧 You wanted to see me about your <span>textile</span> <span>design</span> <span>project</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 I've been looking at how a <span>range</span> of <span>natural</span> <span>dyes</span> can be used to <span>colour</span> <span>fabrics</span> like <span>cotton</span> and <span>wool</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why did you choose that <span>topic</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I got a lot of <span>useful</span> <span>ideas</span> from the <span>museum</span>,<br/>
🎧 you know, at that <span>exhibition</span> of <span>textiles</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I've always been interested in anything to do with <span>colour</span>.<br/>
🎧 Years ago, I went to a <span>carpet</span> <span>shop</span> with my <span>parents</span> when we were on <span>holiday</span> in <span>Turkey</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I remember all the amazing <span>colours</span>.<br/>
🎧 They might not all have been <span>natural</span> <span>dyes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Maybe not, but for the <span>project</span> I <span>decided</span> to <span>follow</span> it up.<br/>
🎧 And I <span>found</span> a great book about a <span>botanic</span> garden in <span>California</span> that <span>specialises</span> in <span>plants</span> used for <span>dyes</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So, in your <span>project</span>, you had to <span>include</span> a <span>practical</span> <span>investigation</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 At first I couldn't decide on my <span>variables</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was going to just look at one <span>type</span> of <span>fibre</span> for example, like <span>cotton…<br/></span>
🎧 and see how different <span>types</span> of <span>dyes</span> <span>affected</span> it?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Then I <span>decided</span> to <span>include</span> <span>others</span> as well,<br/>
🎧 so I <span>looked</span> at <span>cotton</span> and <span>wool</span> and <span>nylon</span>.<br/>
🎧 With just one <span>type</span> of <span>dye</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Various</span> <span>types</span>, <span>including</span> some that weren't <span>natural</span>, for <span>comparison</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So, I did the <span>experiments</span> last week.<br/>
🎧 I used some <span>ready-made</span> <span>natural</span> <span>dyes</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>found</span> a <span>website</span> which <span>supplied</span> them,<br/>
🎧 they came in just a few <span>days</span>, but I also made some of my own.<br/>
🎧 That must have taken quite a bit of time.<br/>
🎧 Yes,<br/>
🎧 I'd thought it'd just be a <span>matter</span> of a <span>teaspoon</span> or so of <span>dye</span>,<br/>
🎧 and actually that wasn't the case at all.<br/>
🎧 Like I was <span>using</span> one <span>vegetable</span>, <span>beetroot</span>, for a red <span>dye</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I had to <span>chop</span> up a whole <span>pile</span> of it.<br/>
🎧 So it all took <span>longer</span> than I'd <span>expected</span>.<br/>
🎧 One <span>possibility</span> is to use food <span>colourings</span>.<br/>
🎧 I did use one.<br/>
🎧 That was a <span>yellow</span> <span>dye</span>, an <span>artificial</span> one.<br/>
🎧 <span>Tartrazine</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah. I used it on <span>cotton</span> first.<br/>
🎧 It came out a great <span>colour</span>,<br/>
🎧 but when I <span>rinsed</span> the <span>material</span>, the <span>colour</span> just <span>washed</span> away.<br/>
🎧 I'd been going to try it out on <span>nylon</span>, but I <span>abandoned</span> that idea.<br/>
🎧 Were you <span>worried</span> about <span>health</span> issues?<br/>
🎧 I'd thought if it's a <span>legal</span> food <span>colouring</span>, it must be <span>safe</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, it can <span>occasionally</span> <span>cause</span> <span>allergic</span> <span>reactions</span>, I <span>believe</span>.<br/>
🎧 So what <span>natural</span> <span>dyes</span> did you look at?<br/>
🎧 Well, one was <span>turmeric</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>colour's</span> great, it's a really <span>strong</span> <span>yellow</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>generally</span> used in <span>dishes</span> like <span>curry</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>meant</span> to be quite good for your <span>health</span> when <span>eaten</span>,<br/>
🎧 but you might find it's not <span>permanent</span> when it's used as a <span>dye</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 a few <span>washes</span>, and it's <span>gone</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I used <span>beetroot</span> as a <span>dye</span> for <span>wool</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I <span>chop</span> up <span>beetroot</span> to eat I always end up with <span>bright</span> red <span>hands</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>wool</span> <span>ended</span> up just a <span>sort</span> of <span>watery</span> <span>cream</span> <span>shade</span>. <span>Disappointing</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>natural</span> <span>dye</span> called <span>Tyrian</span> <span>purple</span>. Have you heard of that?<br/>
🎧 Yes. It comes from a <span>shellfish</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it was <span>worn</span> in <span>ancient</span> <span>times</span> but only by important people as it was so <span>rare</span>.<br/>
🎧 I didn't use it.<br/>
🎧 It <span>fell</span> out of use <span>centuries</span> ago,<br/>
🎧 though one <span>researcher</span> <span>managed</span> to get <span>hold</span> of some <span>recently</span>.<br/>
🎧 But that <span>shade</span> of <span>purple</span> can be <span>produced</span> by <span>chemical</span> <span>dyes</span> <span>nowadays</span>.<br/>
🎧 Did you use any <span>black</span> <span>dyes</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Logwood</span>.<br/>
🎧 That was quite <span>complicated</span>.<br/>
🎧 I had to <span>prepare</span> the <span>fabric</span> so the <span>dye</span> would take.<br/>
🎧 I hope you were <span>careful</span> to <span>wear</span> <span>gloves</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes. I know the <span>danger</span> with that <span>dye</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good. It can be <span>extremely</span> <span>dangerous</span> if it's <span>ingested</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, <span>presumably</span> you had a look at an <span>insect-based</span> <span>dye</span>? Like <span>cochineal</span>, for example?<br/>
🎧 Yes. I didn't actually make that,<br/>
🎧 I didn't have time to start <span>crushing</span> up <span>insects</span> to get the red <span>colour<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>anyway</span> they're not <span>available</span> here,<br/>
🎧 but I <span>managed</span> to get the <span>dye</span> quite <span>easily</span> from a <span>website</span>.<br/>
🎧 But it <span>cost</span> a <span>fortune</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can see why it's <span>generally</span> just used in cooking, and in small <span>quantities</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's very <span>effective</span>, but that's <span>precisely</span> why it's not used as a <span>dye</span>.<br/>
🎧 I also read about <span>using</span> <span>metal</span> <span>oxide</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Apparently</span> you can <span>allow</span> <span>iron</span> to <span>rust</span> while it's in <span>contact</span> with the <span>fabric</span>, and that <span>colours</span> it.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that <span>works</span> well for <span>dying</span> <span>cotton</span>.<br/>
🎧 But you have to be <span>careful</span> as the <span>metal</span> can actually <span>affect</span> the <span>fabric<br/></span>
🎧 and so you can't <span>expect</span> to get a lot of <span>wear</span> out of <span>fabrics</span> <span>treated</span> in this way.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>colours</span> are quite <span>subtle</span>, not everyone likes them.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, it looks as if you've done a lot of <span>work…<br/></span>
<br />

🎧 Last week, we <span>started</span> looking at <span>reptiles</span>, <span>including</span> <span>crocodiles</span> and <span>snakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Today, I'd like us to have a look at another <span>reptile</span> <span>-</span> the <span>lizard</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and in <span>particular</span>, at some <span>studies</span> that have been done on a <span>particular</span> <span>type</span> of <span>lizard<br/></span>
🎧 whose <span>Latin</span> name is <span>tiliqua</span> <span>rugosa</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is <span>commonly</span> <span>known</span> as the <span>sleepy</span> <span>lizard</span>,<br/>
🎧 because it's quite <span>slow</span> in its <span>movements</span> and <span>spends</span> quite a lot of its time <span>dozing</span> under <span>rocks</span> or <span>lying</span> in the sun.<br/>
🎧 I'll start with a <span>general</span> <span>description</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sleepy</span> <span>lizards</span> live in <span>Western</span> and <span>South</span> <span>Australia</span>, where they're quite <span>common</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Unlike</span> <span>European</span> <span>lizards</span>, which are <span>mostly</span> small, <span>green</span> and <span>fast-moving</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>sleepy</span> <span>lizards</span> are <span>brown</span>,<br/>
🎧 but what's <span>particularly</span> <span>distinctive</span> about them is the <span>colour</span> of their <span>tongue</span>, which is <span>dark</span> <span>blue</span>,<br/>
🎧 in <span>contrast</span> with the <span>lining</span> of their <span>mouth</span> which is <span>bright</span> <span>pink</span>.<br/>
🎧 And they're much <span>bigger</span> than most <span>European</span> <span>lizards</span>.<br/>
🎧 They have quite a <span>varied</span> <span>diet</span>, <span>including</span> <span>insects</span> and even small <span>animals</span>,<br/>
🎧 but they <span>mostly</span> eat <span>plants</span> of <span>varying</span> <span>kinds</span>.<br/>
🎧 Even though they're quite large and <span>powerful</span>,<br/>
🎧 with <span>strong</span> <span>jaws</span> that can <span>crush</span> <span>beetles</span> and <span>snail</span> <span>shells</span>,<br/>
🎧 they still have quite a few <span>predators</span>.<br/>
🎧 Large <span>birds</span> like <span>cassowaries</span> were one of the <span>main</span> <span>ones</span> in the <span>past</span>,<br/>
🎧 but <span>nowadays</span> they're more <span>likely</span> to be <span>caught</span> and <span>killed</span> by <span>snakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Actually, another <span>threat</span> to their <span>survival</span> isn't a <span>predator</span> at all, but is <span>man-made</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 quite a large number of <span>sleepy</span> <span>lizards</span> are <span>killed</span> by <span>cars</span> when they're trying to <span>cross</span> <span>highways</span>.<br/>
🎧 One <span>study</span> <span>carried</span> out by <span>Michael</span> <span>Freake</span> at <span>Flinders</span> <span>University<br/></span>
🎧 <span>investigated</span> the <span>methods</span> of <span>navigation</span> of these <span>lizards</span>.<br/>
🎧 Though they move <span>slowly</span>, they can travel quite long <span>distances</span>.<br/>
🎧 And he <span>found</span> that even if they were taken some <span>distance</span> away from their home <span>territory</span>,<br/>
🎧 they could usually find their way back home as long as they could see the sky <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 they didn't need any other <span>landmarks</span> on the <span>ground</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Observations</span> of these <span>lizards</span> in the <span>wild</span> have also <span>revealed</span> that their <span>mating</span> <span>habits</span> are quite <span>unusual</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Unlike</span> most <span>animals</span>, it <span>seems</span> that they're <span>relatively</span> <span>monogamous</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>returning</span> to the same <span>partner</span> year after year.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>male</span> and <span>female</span> also <span>stay</span> together for a long time,<br/>
🎧 both before and after the <span>birth</span> of their young.<br/>
🎧 It's quite <span>interesting</span> to think about the <span>possible</span> <span>reasons</span> for this.<br/>
🎧 It could be that it's to do with <span>protecting</span> their young <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 you'd <span>expect</span> them to have a much better <span>chance</span> of <span>survival</span> if they have both <span>parents</span> around.<br/>
🎧 But in <span>fact</span> <span>observers</span> have <span>noted</span> that once the <span>babies</span> have <span>hatched</span> out of their <span>eggs</span>,<br/>
🎧 they have <span>hardly</span> any <span>contact</span> with their <span>parents</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, there's not really any <span>evidence</span> to <span>support</span> that idea.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>suggestion's</span> <span>based</span> on the <span>observation</span> that <span>male</span> <span>lizards</span> in <span>monogamous</span> <span>relationships<br/></span>
🎧 <span>tend</span> to be <span>bigger</span> and <span>stronger</span> than other <span>males</span>.<br/>
🎧 So maybe the <span>male</span> <span>lizards</span> <span>stay</span> around so they can give the <span>female</span> <span>lizards</span> <span>protection</span> from other <span>males</span>.<br/>
🎧 But again, we're not really sure.<br/>
🎧 Finally, I'd like to <span>mention</span> another <span>study</span> that <span>involved</span> <span>collecting</span> <span>data</span> by <span>tracking</span> the <span>lizards</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was actually <span>involved</span> in this myself.<br/>
🎧 So we <span>caught</span> some <span>lizards</span> in the <span>wild<br/></span>
🎧 and we <span>developed</span> a <span>tiny</span> <span>GPS</span> <span>system</span> that would <span>allow</span> us to <span>track</span> them,<br/>
🎧 and we <span>fixed</span> this <span>onto</span> their <span>tails</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then we set the <span>lizards</span> free again,<br/>
🎧 and we were able to <span>track</span> them for <span>twelve</span> <span>days</span> and <span>gather</span> <span>data</span>,<br/>
🎧 not just about their <span>location</span>, but even about how many <span>steps</span> they took during this <span>period</span>.<br/>
🎧 One <span>surprising</span> thing we <span>discovered</span> from <span>this<br/></span>
🎧 is that there were <span>far</span> <span>fewer</span> <span>meetings</span> between <span>lizards</span> than we <span>expected</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it <span>seems</span> that they were actually trying to <span>avoid</span> one another.<br/>
🎧 So why would that be?<br/>
🎧 Well, again we have no <span>clear</span> <span>evidence</span>,<br/>
🎧 but one <span>hypothesis</span> is that <span>male</span> <span>lizards</span> can <span>cause</span> quite serious <span>injuries</span> to one another,<br/>
🎧 so maybe this <span>avoidance</span> is a way of <span>preventing</span> this <span>-</span> of <span>self-preservation</span>, if you like.<br/>
🎧 But we need to <span>collect</span> a lot more <span>data</span> before we can be sure of any of this.<br/>
