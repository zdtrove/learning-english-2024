🎧 Hello, <span>Linda <span>speaking.<br/>
🎧 Oh hi, <span>Linda.<br/>
🎧 This is <span>Matt <span>Brooks.<br/>
🎧 <span>Alex <span>White gave me your number.<br/>
🎧 He said you'd be able to give me some advice about <span>moving to <span>Banford.<br/>
🎧 Yes, <span>Alex did <span>mention you.<br/>
🎧 How can I help?<br/>
🎧 Well, first of all <span>- which <span>area to live in?<br/>
🎧 Well, I live in <span>Dalton, which is a really nice <span>suburb <span>-<br/>
🎧 not too <span>expensive, and there's a nice <span>park.<br/>
🎧 Sounds good.<br/>
🎧 Do you know how much it would be to <span>rent a two <span>bedroom <span>flat there?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, you should be able to get something <span>reasonable for <span>850 <span>pounds <span>per month.<br/>
🎧 That's what people <span>typically pay.<br/>
🎧 You <span>certainly wouldn't want to pay more than <span>900 <span>pounds.<br/>
🎧 That doesn't <span>include <span>bills or anything.<br/>
🎧 No. That sounds alright.<br/>
🎧 I'll definitely have a look there.<br/>
🎧 Are the <span>transport <span>links easy from where you live?<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm very <span>lucky.<br/>
🎧 I work in the <span>city <span>centre so I don't have to use <span>public <span>transport.<br/>
🎧 I go by <span>bike.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I wish I could do that.<br/>
🎧 Is it <span>safe to <span>cycle around the <span>city?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's fine.<br/>
🎧 And it <span>keeps me fit.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway, driving to work in the <span>city <span>centre would be a <span>nightmare<br/>
🎧 because there's <span>hardly any <span>parking.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>traffic during the <span>rush <span>hour can be bad.<br/>
🎧 I'd be working from <span>home<br/>
🎧 but I'd have to go to <span>London one or two <span>days a week.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's perfect.<br/>
🎧 Getting to <span>London is no <span>problem.<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>fast <span>train every <span>30 <span>minutes which only takes <span>45 <span>minutes.<br/>
🎧 That's good.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, the <span>train <span>service isn't bad during the week.<br/>
🎧 And they run quite <span>late at <span>night.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>weekends that are a <span>problem.<br/>
🎧 They're always doing <span>engineering <span>work<br/>
🎧 and you have to take a bus to <span>Hadham<br/>
🎧 and <span>pick up the <span>train there, which is really <span>slow.<br/>
🎧 But other than that, <span>Banford's a great place to live.<br/>
🎧 I've never been <span>happier.<br/>
🎧 There are some nice <span>restaurants in the <span>city <span>centre<br/>
🎧 and a <span>brand new <span>cinema which has only been open a <span>couple of <span>months.<br/>
🎧 There's a good <span>arts <span>centre too.<br/>
🎧 Sounds like <span>Banford's got it all.<br/>
🎧 Yes! We're really <span>lucky.<br/>
🎧 There are lots of really good <span>aspects to living here.<br/>
🎧 The <span>schools are <span>good<br/>
🎧 and the <span>hospital here is one of the best in the <span>country.<br/>
🎧 Everyone I know who's been there's had a <span>positive <span>experience.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I can give you the name of my <span>dentist too in <span>Bridge <span>Street,<br/>
🎧 if you're interested.<br/>
🎧 I've been going to him for years and I've never had any <span>problems.<br/>
🎧 Oh, OK. Thanks!<br/>
🎧 I'll find his number and <span>send it to you.<br/>
🎧 Thanks, that would be really <span>helpful.<br/>
🎧 Are you planning to visit <span>Banford soon?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 My <span>wife and I are both <span>coming next week.<br/>
🎧 We want to make some <span>appointments with <span>estate <span>agents.<br/>
🎧 I could meet you if you like and show you around.<br/>
🎧 Are you sure?<br/>
🎧 We'd really <span>appreciate that.<br/>
🎧 Either a <span>Tuesday or <span>Thursday is good for me, after <span>5.30.<br/>
🎧 <span>Thursday's <span>preferable.<br/>
🎧 <span>Tuesday I need to get home before <span>6 pm.<br/>
🎧 Okay great.<br/>
🎧 Let me know which <span>train you're <span>catching<br/>
🎧 and I'll meet you in the <span>cafe outside.<br/>
🎧 You can't <span>miss it.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>opposite the <span>station and next to the <span>museum.<br/>
🎧 <span>Brilliant.<br/>
🎧 I'll <span>text you next week then.<br/>
🎧 Thanks so much for all the advice.<br/>
🎧 No <span>problem.<br/>
🎧 I'll see you next week.<br/>
<br />

🎧 So if you are one of those people who hasn't <span>found the perfect <span>physical <span>activity yet,<br/>
🎧 here are some things to think about which might help you make the right <span>decision for you.<br/>
🎧 The first <span>question to ask yourself is <span>whether you would enjoy <span>training in a gym.<br/>
🎧 Many people are put off by the idea of having to fit a visit to the gym into their <span>busy day.<br/>
🎧 You often have to go very <span>early or <span>late as some <span>gyms can get very <span>crowded<br/>
🎧 but with <span>regular <span>training you'll see a big <span>difference in a <span>relatively short <span>space of time.<br/>
🎧 <span>Running has become <span>incredibly <span>popular in <span>recent years.<br/>
🎧 That's probably got a lot to do with the <span>fact that it's a very <span>accessible <span>form of <span>exercise<br/>
🎧 that <span>anyone can run even if you could only run a few <span>meters to <span>begin with.<br/>
🎧 But make sure you get the right <span>shoes.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>worth <span>investing in a high <span>quality <span>pair and they don't come <span>cheap.<br/>
🎧 Another great thing about <span>running is that you can do it at any time of day or <span>night.<br/>
🎧 The only thing that may <span>stop you is <span>snow and ice.<br/>
🎧 <span>Swimming is another really good way to <span>build <span>fitness.<br/>
🎧 What <span>attracts many people is that you can <span>swim in an <span>indoor <span>pool at any time of year.<br/>
🎧 On the other <span>hand, it can be quite <span>boring or <span>solitary.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>hard to <span>chat to people while you're <span>swimming <span>lengths.<br/>
🎧 <span>Cycling has become almost as <span>popular as <span>running in <span>recent years.<br/>
🎧 That's probably because as well as <span>improving their <span>fitness<br/>
🎧 many people say being out in the <span>fresh air in a <span>park or in the <span>countryside can be fun,<br/>
🎧 <span>provided the <span>conditions are right of course.<br/>
🎧 Only <span>fanatics go out in the <span>wind and <span>rain.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yoga is a good <span>choice for those of you looking for <span>exercise,<br/>
🎧 which <span>focuses on <span>developing both a <span>healthy <span>mind and <span>body.<br/>
🎧 It's a good way of <span>building <span>strength<br/>
🎧 and with the right <span>instructor there's less <span>chance of <span>hurting yourself than with other more <span>active <span>sports.<br/>
🎧 But don't <span>expect to find it easy.<br/>
🎧 It can be <span>surprisingly <span>challenging, <span>especially for people who aren't very <span>flexible.<br/>
🎧 Getting a personal <span>trainer is a good way to start your <span>fitness <span>program.<br/>
🎧 <span>Obviously there can be <span>significant <span>costs <span>involved.<br/>
🎧 But if you've got <span>someone there to <span>encourage you and help you <span>achieve your <span>goals,<br/>
🎧 you're less <span>likely to give up.<br/>
🎧 Make sure you get <span>someone with a <span>recognised <span>qualification though.<br/>
🎧 Or you could do yourself <span>permanent <span>damage.<br/>
🎧 Whatever you do, don't join a gym <span>unless you're sure you'll make good use of it.<br/>
🎧 So many people <span>waste lots of money by <span>signing up for <span>membership and then <span>hardly ever go.<br/>
🎧 What <span>happens to their good <span>intentions?<br/>
🎧 I don't think people <span>suddenly <span>stop <span>caring about <span>improving their <span>fitness<br/>
🎧 or decide they have more important things to do.<br/>
🎧 I think people <span>lose <span>interest when they don't think they're <span>making enough <span>progress.<br/>
🎧 That's when they give up hope and <span>stop <span>believing they'll ever <span>achieve their <span>goals.<br/>
🎧 Also, what people sometimes don't <span>realize when they <span>start<br/>
🎧 is that it takes a lot of <span>determination and <span>hard work to keep <span>training week after week,<br/>
🎧 and lots of people don't have that kind of <span>commitment.<br/>
🎧 One thing you can do to help yourself is to set <span>manageable <span>goals,<br/>
🎧 be <span>realistic and don't <span>push yourself too <span>far.<br/>
🎧 Some people <span>advise <span>writing <span>goals <span>down<br/>
🎧 but I think it's better to have a <span>flexible <span>approach.<br/>
🎧 Give yourself a really nice <span>treat every time you <span>reach one of your <span>goals<br/>
🎧 and don't get too <span>upset if you <span>experience <span>setbacks.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>journey.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>bound to be <span>difficulties along the way.<br/>
<br />

🎧 OK, <span>Jim.<br/>
🎧 You wanted to see me about your <span>textile <span>design <span>project.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 I've been looking at how a <span>range of <span>natural <span>dyes can be used to <span>colour <span>fabrics like <span>cotton and <span>wool.<br/>
🎧 Why did you choose that <span>topic?<br/>
🎧 Well, I got a lot of <span>useful <span>ideas from the <span>museum,<br/>
🎧 you know, at that <span>exhibition of <span>textiles.<br/>
🎧 But I've always been interested in anything to do with <span>colour.<br/>
🎧 Years ago, I went to a <span>carpet <span>shop with my <span>parents when we were on <span>holiday in <span>Turkey,<br/>
🎧 and I remember all the amazing <span>colours.<br/>
🎧 They might not all have been <span>natural <span>dyes.<br/>
🎧 Maybe not, but for the <span>project I <span>decided to <span>follow it up.<br/>
🎧 And I <span>found a great book about a <span>botanic garden in <span>California that <span>specialises in <span>plants used for <span>dyes.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So, in your <span>project, you had to <span>include a <span>practical <span>investigation.<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 At first I couldn't decide on my <span>variables.<br/>
🎧 I was going to just look at one <span>type of <span>fibre for example, like <span>cotton…<br/>
🎧 and see how different <span>types of <span>dyes <span>affected it?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Then I <span>decided to <span>include <span>others as well,<br/>
🎧 so I <span>looked at <span>cotton and <span>wool and <span>nylon.<br/>
🎧 With just one <span>type of <span>dye?<br/>
🎧 <span>Various <span>types, <span>including some that weren't <span>natural, for <span>comparison.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So, I did the <span>experiments last week.<br/>
🎧 I used some <span>ready-made <span>natural <span>dyes.<br/>
🎧 I <span>found a <span>website which <span>supplied them,<br/>
🎧 they came in just a few <span>days, but I also made some of my own.<br/>
🎧 That must have taken quite a bit of time.<br/>
🎧 Yes,<br/>
🎧 I'd thought it'd just be a <span>matter of a <span>teaspoon or so of <span>dye,<br/>
🎧 and actually that wasn't the case at all.<br/>
🎧 Like I was <span>using one <span>vegetable, <span>beetroot, for a red <span>dye,<br/>
🎧 and I had to <span>chop up a whole <span>pile of it.<br/>
🎧 So it all took <span>longer than I'd <span>expected.<br/>
🎧 One <span>possibility is to use food <span>colourings.<br/>
🎧 I did use one.<br/>
🎧 That was a <span>yellow <span>dye, an <span>artificial one.<br/>
🎧 <span>Tartrazine?<br/>
🎧 Yeah. I used it on <span>cotton first.<br/>
🎧 It came out a great <span>colour,<br/>
🎧 but when I <span>rinsed the <span>material, the <span>colour just <span>washed away.<br/>
🎧 I'd been going to try it out on <span>nylon, but I <span>abandoned that idea.<br/>
🎧 Were you <span>worried about <span>health issues?<br/>
🎧 I'd thought if it's a <span>legal food <span>colouring, it must be <span>safe.<br/>
🎧 Well, it can <span>occasionally <span>cause <span>allergic <span>reactions, I <span>believe.<br/>
🎧 So what <span>natural <span>dyes did you look at?<br/>
🎧 Well, one was <span>turmeric.<br/>
🎧 The <span>colour's great, it's a really <span>strong <span>yellow.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>generally used in <span>dishes like <span>curry.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>meant to be quite good for your <span>health when <span>eaten,<br/>
🎧 but you might find it's not <span>permanent when it's used as a <span>dye <span>-<br/>
🎧 a few <span>washes, and it's <span>gone.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I used <span>beetroot as a <span>dye for <span>wool.<br/>
🎧 When I <span>chop up <span>beetroot to eat I always end up with <span>bright red <span>hands,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>wool <span>ended up just a <span>sort of <span>watery <span>cream <span>shade. <span>Disappointing.<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>natural <span>dye called <span>Tyrian <span>purple. Have you heard of that?<br/>
🎧 Yes. It comes from a <span>shellfish,<br/>
🎧 and it was <span>worn in <span>ancient <span>times but only by important people as it was so <span>rare.<br/>
🎧 I didn't use it.<br/>
🎧 It <span>fell out of use <span>centuries ago,<br/>
🎧 though one <span>researcher <span>managed to get <span>hold of some <span>recently.<br/>
🎧 But that <span>shade of <span>purple can be <span>produced by <span>chemical <span>dyes <span>nowadays.<br/>
🎧 Did you use any <span>black <span>dyes?<br/>
🎧 <span>Logwood.<br/>
🎧 That was quite <span>complicated.<br/>
🎧 I had to <span>prepare the <span>fabric so the <span>dye would take.<br/>
🎧 I hope you were <span>careful to <span>wear <span>gloves.<br/>
🎧 Yes. I know the <span>danger with that <span>dye.<br/>
🎧 Good. It can be <span>extremely <span>dangerous if it's <span>ingested.<br/>
🎧 Now, <span>presumably you had a look at an <span>insect-based <span>dye? Like <span>cochineal, for example?<br/>
🎧 Yes. I didn't actually make that,<br/>
🎧 I didn't have time to start <span>crushing up <span>insects to get the red <span>colour<br/>
🎧 and <span>anyway they're not <span>available here,<br/>
🎧 but I <span>managed to get the <span>dye quite <span>easily from a <span>website.<br/>
🎧 But it <span>cost a <span>fortune.<br/>
🎧 I can see why it's <span>generally just used in cooking, and in small <span>quantities.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's very <span>effective, but that's <span>precisely why it's not used as a <span>dye.<br/>
🎧 I also read about <span>using <span>metal <span>oxide.<br/>
🎧 <span>Apparently you can <span>allow <span>iron to <span>rust while it's in <span>contact with the <span>fabric, and that <span>colours it.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that <span>works well for <span>dying <span>cotton.<br/>
🎧 But you have to be <span>careful as the <span>metal can actually <span>affect the <span>fabric<br/>
🎧 and so you can't <span>expect to get a lot of <span>wear out of <span>fabrics <span>treated in this way.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>colours are quite <span>subtle, not everyone likes them.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway, it looks as if you've done a lot of <span>work…<br/>
<br />

🎧 Last week, we <span>started looking at <span>reptiles, <span>including <span>crocodiles and <span>snakes.<br/>
🎧 Today, I'd like us to have a look at another <span>reptile <span>- the <span>lizard <span>-<br/>
🎧 and in <span>particular, at some <span>studies that have been done on a <span>particular <span>type of <span>lizard<br/>
🎧 whose <span>Latin name is <span>tiliqua <span>rugosa.<br/>
🎧 This is <span>commonly <span>known as the <span>sleepy <span>lizard,<br/>
🎧 because it's quite <span>slow in its <span>movements and <span>spends quite a lot of its time <span>dozing under <span>rocks or <span>lying in the sun.<br/>
🎧 I'll start with a <span>general <span>description.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sleepy <span>lizards live in <span>Western and <span>South <span>Australia, where they're quite <span>common.<br/>
🎧 <span>Unlike <span>European <span>lizards, which are <span>mostly small, <span>green and <span>fast-moving,<br/>
🎧 <span>sleepy <span>lizards are <span>brown,<br/>
🎧 but what's <span>particularly <span>distinctive about them is the <span>colour of their <span>tongue, which is <span>dark <span>blue,<br/>
🎧 in <span>contrast with the <span>lining of their <span>mouth which is <span>bright <span>pink.<br/>
🎧 And they're much <span>bigger than most <span>European <span>lizards.<br/>
🎧 They have quite a <span>varied <span>diet, <span>including <span>insects and even small <span>animals,<br/>
🎧 but they <span>mostly eat <span>plants of <span>varying <span>kinds.<br/>
🎧 Even though they're quite large and <span>powerful,<br/>
🎧 with <span>strong <span>jaws that can <span>crush <span>beetles and <span>snail <span>shells,<br/>
🎧 they still have quite a few <span>predators.<br/>
🎧 Large <span>birds like <span>cassowaries were one of the <span>main <span>ones in the <span>past,<br/>
🎧 but <span>nowadays they're more <span>likely to be <span>caught and <span>killed by <span>snakes.<br/>
🎧 Actually, another <span>threat to their <span>survival isn't a <span>predator at all, but is <span>man-made <span>-<br/>
🎧 quite a large number of <span>sleepy <span>lizards are <span>killed by <span>cars when they're trying to <span>cross <span>highways.<br/>
🎧 One <span>study <span>carried out by <span>Michael <span>Freake at <span>Flinders <span>University<br/>
🎧 <span>investigated the <span>methods of <span>navigation of these <span>lizards.<br/>
🎧 Though they move <span>slowly, they can travel quite long <span>distances.<br/>
🎧 And he <span>found that even if they were taken some <span>distance away from their home <span>territory,<br/>
🎧 they could usually find their way back home as long as they could see the sky <span>-<br/>
🎧 they didn't need any other <span>landmarks on the <span>ground.<br/>
🎧 <span>Observations of these <span>lizards in the <span>wild have also <span>revealed that their <span>mating <span>habits are quite <span>unusual.<br/>
🎧 <span>Unlike most <span>animals, it <span>seems that they're <span>relatively <span>monogamous,<br/>
🎧 <span>returning to the same <span>partner year after year.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>male and <span>female also <span>stay together for a long time,<br/>
🎧 both before and after the <span>birth of their young.<br/>
🎧 It's quite <span>interesting to think about the <span>possible <span>reasons for this.<br/>
🎧 It could be that it's to do with <span>protecting their young <span>-<br/>
🎧 you'd <span>expect them to have a much better <span>chance of <span>survival if they have both <span>parents around.<br/>
🎧 But in <span>fact <span>observers have <span>noted that once the <span>babies have <span>hatched out of their <span>eggs,<br/>
🎧 they have <span>hardly any <span>contact with their <span>parents.<br/>
🎧 So, there's not really any <span>evidence to <span>support that idea.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>suggestion's <span>based on the <span>observation that <span>male <span>lizards in <span>monogamous <span>relationships<br/>
🎧 <span>tend to be <span>bigger and <span>stronger than other <span>males.<br/>
🎧 So maybe the <span>male <span>lizards <span>stay around so they can give the <span>female <span>lizards <span>protection from other <span>males.<br/>
🎧 But again, we're not really sure.<br/>
🎧 Finally, I'd like to <span>mention another <span>study that <span>involved <span>collecting <span>data by <span>tracking the <span>lizards.<br/>
🎧 I was actually <span>involved in this myself.<br/>
🎧 So we <span>caught some <span>lizards in the <span>wild<br/>
🎧 and we <span>developed a <span>tiny <span>GPS <span>system that would <span>allow us to <span>track them,<br/>
🎧 and we <span>fixed this <span>onto their <span>tails.<br/>
🎧 Then we set the <span>lizards free again,<br/>
🎧 and we were able to <span>track them for <span>twelve <span>days and <span>gather <span>data,<br/>
🎧 not just about their <span>location, but even about how many <span>steps they took during this <span>period.<br/>
🎧 One <span>surprising thing we <span>discovered from <span>this<br/>
🎧 is that there were <span>far <span>fewer <span>meetings between <span>lizards than we <span>expected <span>-<br/>
🎧 it <span>seems that they were actually trying to <span>avoid one another.<br/>
🎧 So why would that be?<br/>
🎧 Well, again we have no <span>clear <span>evidence,<br/>
