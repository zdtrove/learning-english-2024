🎧 Hello?<br/>
🎧 Oh hello.<br/>
🎧 I was hoping to speak to Jack Fitzgerald about renting a cottage.<br/>
🎧 I'm his wife, Shirley, and we own the cottages together,<br/>
🎧 so I'm sure I can help you.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 My name's Tom.<br/>
🎧 Some friends of ours rented Granary Cottage from you last year,<br/>
🎧 and they thought it was great.<br/>
🎧 So my wife and I are hoping to come in May for a week.<br/>
🎧 What date did you have in mind?<br/>
🎧 The week beginning the 14th, if possible.<br/>
🎧 I'll just check...<br/>
🎧 I'm sorry, Tom, it's already booked that week.<br/>
🎧 It's free the week beginning the 28th, though, for seven nights.<br/>
🎧 In fact, that's the only time you could have it in May.<br/>
🎧 Well, we could manage that, I think.<br/>
🎧 We'd just need to change a couple of things.<br/>
🎧 How much would it cost?<br/>
🎧 That's the beginning of high season,<br/>
🎧 so it'd be £550 for the week.<br/>
🎧 That's a bit more than we wanted to pay, I'm afraid.<br/>
🎧 We've budgeted up to £500 for accommodation.<br/>
🎧 Well, we've just finished converting another building into a cottage,<br/>
🎧 which we're calling Chervil Cottage.<br/>
🎧 Sorry? What was that again?<br/>
🎧 Chervil.<br/>
🎧 C H E R V for Victor I L.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's a herb, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 It grows fairly wild around here.<br/>
🎧 You could have that for the week you want for £480.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So could you tell me something about it, please?<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 The building was built as a garage.<br/>
🎧 It's a little smaller than Granary Cottage.<br/>
🎧 So that must sleep two people, as well?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 There's a double bedroom.<br/>
🎧 Does it have a garden?<br/>
🎧 Yes, you get to it from the living room through French doors,<br/>
🎧 and we provide two deckchairs.<br/>
🎧 We hope to build a patio in the near future,<br/>
🎧 but I wouldn't like to guarantee it'll be finished by May.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 The front door opens onto the old farmyard,<br/>
🎧 and parking isn't a problem -<br/>
🎧 there's plenty of room at the front for that.<br/>
🎧 There are some trees and potted plants there.<br/>
🎧 What about facilities in the cottage?<br/>
🎧 It has standard things like a cooker and fridge, I presume.<br/>
🎧 In the kitchen area there's a fridge-freezer<br/>
🎧 and we've just put in an electric cooker.<br/>
🎧 Is there a washing machine?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 There's also a TV in the living room, which plays DVDs too.<br/>
🎧 The bathroom is too small for a bath,<br/>
🎧 so there's a shower instead.<br/>
🎧 I think a lot of people prefer that nowadays, anyway.<br/>
🎧 It's more environmentally friendly, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Unless you spend half the day in it!<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 What about heating?<br/>
🎧 It sometimes gets quite cool at that time of year.<br/>
🎧 There's central heating, and if you want to light a fire, there's a stove.<br/>
🎧 We can provide all the wood you need for it.<br/>
🎧 It smells so much nicer than coal,<br/>
🎧 and it makes the room very cosy -<br/>
🎧 we've got one in our own house.<br/>
🎧 That sounds very pleasant.<br/>
🎧 Perhaps we should come in the winter, to make the most of it!<br/>
🎧 Yes, we find we don't want to go out when we've got the fire burning.<br/>
🎧 There are some attractive views from the cottage, which I haven't mentioned.<br/>
🎧 There's a famous stone bridge -<br/>
🎧 it's one of the oldest in the region,<br/>
🎧 and you can see it from the living room.<br/>
🎧 It isn't far away.<br/>
🎧 The bedroom window looks in the opposite direction,<br/>
🎧 and has a lovely view of the hills and the monument at the top.<br/>
🎧 Well, that all sounds perfect.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to book it, please.<br/>
🎧 Would you want a deposit?<br/>
🎧 Yes, we ask for 30% to secure your booking,<br/>
🎧 so that'll be... £144.<br/>
🎧 And when would you like the rest of the money?<br/>
🎧 You're coming in May, so the last day of March, please.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 Excellent.<br/>
🎧 Could I just take your details...<br/>

🎧 Right. Next on the agenda we have traffic and highways.<br/>
🎧 Councillor Thornton.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Well, we now have the results of the survey carried out last month<br/>
🎧 about traffic and road transport in the town.<br/>
🎧 People were generally satisfied with the state of the roads.<br/>
🎧 There were one or two complaints about potholes which will be addressed,<br/>
🎧 but a significant number of people complained about the increasing number of heavy vehicles<br/>
🎧 using our local roads to avoid traffic elsewhere.<br/>
🎧 We'd expected more complaints by commuters<br/>
🎧 about the reduction in the train service,<br/>
🎧 but it doesn't seem to have affected people too much.<br/>
🎧 The cycle path that runs alongside the river<br/>
🎧 is very well used by both cyclists and pedestrians<br/>
🎧 since the surface was improved last year,<br/>
🎧 but overtaking can be a problem<br/>
🎧 so we're going to add a bit on the side to make it wider.<br/>
🎧 At some stage, we'd like to extend the path so that it goes all the way through the town,<br/>
🎧 but that won't be happening in the immediate future.<br/>
🎧 The plans to have a pedestrian crossing next to the Post Office<br/>
🎧 have unfortunately had to be put on hold for the time being.<br/>
🎧 We'd budgeted for this to be done this financial year,<br/>
🎧 but then there were rumours that the Post Office was going to move,<br/>
🎧 which would have meant there wasn't really a need for a crossing.<br/>
🎧 Now they've confirmed that they're staying where they are,<br/>
🎧 but the Highways Department have told us that it would be dangerous to have a pedestrian crossing<br/>
🎧 where we'd originally planned it as there's a bend in the road there.<br/>
🎧 So that'll need some more thought.<br/>
🎧 On Station Road near the station and level crossing,<br/>
🎧 drivers can face quite long waits if the level crossing's closed,<br/>
🎧 and we've now got signs up requesting them not to leave their engines running at that time.<br/>
🎧 This means pedestrians waiting on the pavement to cross the railway line<br/>
🎧 don't have to breathe in car fumes.<br/>
🎧 We've had some problems with cyclists leaving their bikes chained to the railings outside the ticket office,<br/>
🎧 but the station has agreed to provide bike racks there.<br/>
🎧 So next on the agenda is 'Proposals for improvements to the recreation ground'.<br/>
🎧 Councillor Thornton again.<br/>
🎧 Well, since we managed to extend the recreation ground,<br/>
🎧 we've spent some time talking to local people<br/>
🎧 about how it could be made a more attractive and useful space.<br/>
🎧 If you have a look at the map up on the screen,<br/>
🎧 you can see the river up in the north,<br/>
🎧 and the Community Hall near the entrance from the road.<br/>
🎧 At present, cars can park between the Community Hall and that line of trees to the east,<br/>
🎧 but this is quite dangerous for pedestrians<br/>
🎧 so we're suggesting a new car park on the opposite side of the Community Hall,<br/>
🎧 right next to it.<br/>
🎧 We also have a new location for the cricket pitch.<br/>
🎧 As we've now purchased additional space to the east of the recreation ground,<br/>
🎧 beyond the trees,<br/>
🎧 we plan to move it away from its current location,<br/>
🎧 which is rather near the road, into this new area beyond the line of trees.<br/>
🎧 This means there's less danger of stray balls hitting cars or pedestrians.<br/>
🎧 We've got plans for a children's playground<br/>
🎧 which will be accessible by a footpath from the Community Hall<br/>
🎧 and will be alongside the river.<br/>
🎧 We'd originally thought of having it close to the road,<br/>
🎧 but we think this will be a more attractive location.<br/>
🎧 The skateboard ramp is very popular with both younger and older children -<br/>
🎧 we had considered moving this up towards the river,<br/>
🎧 but in the end we decided to have it in the southeast corner near the road.<br/>
🎧 The pavilion is very well used at present by both football players and cricketers.<br/>
🎧 It will stay where it is now -<br/>
🎧 to the left of the line of trees and near to the river -<br/>
🎧 handy for both the football and cricket pitches.<br/>
🎧 And finally, we'll be getting a new notice board for local information,<br/>
🎧 and that will be directly on people's right<br/>
🎧 as they go from the road into the recreation ground.<br/>

🎧 Now that we've done all the research into bike-sharing schemes in cities around the world,<br/>
🎧 we need to think about how we're going to organise our report.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I think we should start by talking about the benefits.<br/>
🎧 I mean it's great that so many cities have introduced these schemes<br/>
🎧 where anyone can pick up a bike from dozens of different locations<br/>
🎧 and hire it for a few hours.<br/>
🎧 It makes riding a bike very convenient for people.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but the costs can add up<br/>
🎧 and that puts people on low incomes off in some places.<br/>
🎧 I suppose so,<br/>
🎧 but if it means more people in general are cycling rather than driving,<br/>
🎧 then because they're increasing the amount of physical activity they do,<br/>
🎧 it's good for their health<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 But isn't that of less importance?<br/>
🎧 I mean, doesn't the impact of reduced emissions on air pollution<br/>
🎧 have a more significant effect on people's health?<br/>
🎧 Certainly, in some cities bike-sharing has made a big contribution to that.<br/>
🎧 And also helped to cut the number of cars on the road significantly.<br/>
🎧 Which is the main point.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 But I'd say it's had less of an impact on noise pollution<br/>
🎧 because there are still loads of buses and lorries around.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Shall we quickly discuss the recommendations we're going to make?<br/>
🎧 In order to ensure bike-sharing schemes are successful?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Well, while I think it's nice to have really state-of-the-art bikes with things like GPS,<br/>
🎧 I wouldn't say they're absolutely necessary.<br/>
🎧 But some technical things are really important -<br/>
🎧 like a fully functional app -<br/>
🎧 so people can make payments and book bikes easily.<br/>
🎧 Places which haven't invested in that have really struggled.<br/>
🎧 Good point...<br/>
🎧 Some people say there shouldn't be competing companies offering separate bike-sharing schemes,<br/>
🎧 but in some really big cities, competition's beneficial<br/>
🎧 and anyway one company might not be able to manage the whole thing.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Deciding how much to invest is a big question.<br/>
🎧 Cities which have opened loads of new bike lanes<br/>
🎧 at the same time as introducing bike-sharing schemes have generally been more successful -<br/>
🎧 but there are examples of successful schemes where this hasn't happened...<br/>
🎧 What does matter though - is having a big publicity campaign.<br/>
🎧 Definitely.<br/>
🎧 If people don't know how to use the scheme or don't understand its benefits,<br/>
🎧 they won't use it.<br/>
🎧 People need a lot of persuasion to stop using their cars.<br/>
🎧 Shall we look at some examples now?<br/>
🎧 And say what we think is good or bad about them.<br/>
🎧 I suppose we should start with Amsterdam<br/>
🎧 as this was one of the first cities to have a bike-sharing scheme.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 There was already a strong culture of cycling here.<br/>
🎧 In a way it's strange that there was such a demand for bike-sharing<br/>
🎧 because you'd have thought most people would have used their own bikes.<br/>
🎧 And yet it's one of the best-used schemes...<br/>
🎧 Dublin's an interesting example of a success story.<br/>
🎧 It must be because the public transport system's quite limited.<br/>
🎧 Not really -<br/>
🎧 there's no underground, but there are trams and a good bus network.<br/>
🎧 I'd say price has a lot to do with it.<br/>
🎧 It's one of the cheapest schemes in Europe to join.<br/>
🎧 But the buses are really slow -<br/>
🎧 anyway the weather certainly can't be a factor!<br/>
🎧 No - definitely not.<br/>
🎧 The London scheme's been quite successful<br/>
🎧 Yes - it's been a really good thing for the city.<br/>
🎧 The bikes are popular and the whole system is well maintained<br/>
🎧 but it isn't expanding quickly enough.<br/>
🎧 Basically, not enough's been spent on increasing the number of cycle lanes.<br/>
🎧 Hopefully that'll change.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Now what about outside Europe?<br/>
🎧 Well bike-sharing schemes have taken off in places like Buenos Aires.<br/>
🎧 They built a huge network of cycle lanes to support the introduction of the scheme there, didn't they?<br/>
🎧 It attracted huge numbers of cyclists where previously there were hardly any.<br/>
🎧 An example of good planning.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely.<br/>
🎧 New York is a good example of how not to introduce a scheme.<br/>
🎧 When they launched it,<br/>
🎧 it was more than ten times the price of most other schemes.<br/>
🎧 More than it costs to take a taxi, crazy.<br/>
🎧 I think the organisers lacked vision and ambition there.<br/>
🎧 I think so too.<br/>
🎧 Sydney would be a good example to use.<br/>
🎧 I would have expected it to have grown pretty quickly here.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 I can't quite work out why it hasn't been an instant success like some of the others.<br/>
🎧 It's a shame really.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 OK so now we've thought about...<br/>

🎧 One of the most famous cases of extinction is that of a bird known as the dodo.<br/>
🎧 In fact there's even a saying in English, 'as dead as the dodo',<br/>
🎧 used to refer to something which no longer exists.<br/>
🎧 But for many centuries the dodo was alive and well,<br/>
🎧 although it could only be found in one place,<br/>
🎧 the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean.<br/>
🎧 It was a very large bird, about one metre tall,<br/>
🎧 and over the centuries it had lost the ability to fly,<br/>
🎧 but it survived happily under the trees that covered the island.<br/>
🎧 Then in the year 1507,<br/>
🎧 the first Portuguese ships stopped at the island.<br/>
🎧 The sailors were carrying spices back to Europe,<br/>
🎧 and found the island a convenient stopping place<br/>
🎧 where they could stock up with food and water for the rest of the voyage,<br/>
🎧 but they didn't settle on Mauritius.<br/>
🎧 However, in 1638<br/>
🎧 the Dutch arrived and set up a colony there.<br/>
🎧 These first human inhabitants of the island<br/>
🎧 found the dodo birds a convenient source of meat,<br/>
🎧 although not everyone liked the taste.<br/>
🎧 It's hard to get an accurate description of what the dodo actually looked like.<br/>
🎧 We do have some written records from sailors,<br/>
🎧 and a few pictures,<br/>
🎧 but we don't know how reliable these are.<br/>
🎧 The best-known picture is a Dutch painting,<br/>
🎧 in which the bird appears to be extremely fat,<br/>
🎧 but this may not be accurate -<br/>
🎧 an Indian painting done at the same time shows a much thinner bird.<br/>
🎧 Although attempts were made to preserve the bodies of some of the birds,<br/>
🎧 no complete specimen survives.<br/>
🎧 In the early 17th century<br/>
🎧 four dried parts of a bird were known to exist -<br/>
🎧 of these, three have disappeared,<br/>
🎧 so only one example of soft tissue from the dodo survives,<br/>
🎧 a dodo head.<br/>
🎧 Bones have also been found,<br/>
🎧 but there's only one complete skeleton in existence.<br/>
🎧 This single dodo skeleton has recently been the subject of scientific research<br/>
🎧 which suggests that many of the earlier beliefs about dodos<br/>
🎧 may have been incorrect.<br/>
🎧 For example,<br/>
🎧 early accounts of the birds mention how slow and clumsy it was,<br/>
🎧 but scientists now believe<br/>
🎧 the bird's strong knee joints would have made it capable of movement which was not slow,<br/>
🎧 but actually quite fast.<br/>
🎧 In fact, one 17th century sailor wrote that he found the birds hard to catch.<br/>
🎧 It's true that the dodo's small wings wouldn't have allowed it to leave the ground,<br/>
🎧 but the scientists suggest that these were probably employed for balance<br/>
🎧 while going over uneven ground.<br/>
🎧 Another group of scientists carried out analysis of the dodo's skull.<br/>
🎧 They found that the reports of the lack of intelligence of the dodo<br/>
🎧 were not borne out by their research,<br/>
🎧 which suggested the bird's brain was not small,<br/>
🎧 but average in size.<br/>
🎧 In fact, in relation to its body size,<br/>
🎧 it was similar to that of the pigeon,<br/>
🎧 which is known to be a highly intelligent bird.<br/>
🎧 The researchers also found that the structure of the bird's skull<br/>
🎧 suggested that one sense which was particularly well-developed was that of smell.<br/>
🎧 So the dodo may also have been particularly good at locating ripe fruit<br/>
🎧 and other food in the island's thick vegetation.<br/>
🎧 So it looks as if the dodo was better able to survive and defend itself than was originally believed.<br/>
🎧 Yet less than 200 years after Europeans first arrived on the island,<br/>
🎧 they had become extinct.<br/>
🎧 So what was the reason for this?<br/>
🎧 For a long time, it was believed that the dodos were hunted to extinction,<br/>
🎧 but scientists now believe the situation was more complicated than this.<br/>
🎧 Another factor may have been the new species brought to the island by the sailors.<br/>
🎧 These included dogs, which would have been a threat to the dodos,<br/>
🎧 and also monkeys,<br/>
🎧 which ate the fruit that was the main part of the dodos' diet.<br/>
🎧 These were brought to the island deliberately,<br/>
🎧 but the ships also brought another type of creature - rats,<br/>
🎧 which came to land from the ships and rapidly overran the island.<br/>
🎧 These upset the ecology of the island,<br/>
🎧 not just the dodos but other species too.<br/>
🎧 However,<br/>
🎧 they were a particular danger to the dodos<br/>
🎧 because they consumed their eggs,<br/>
🎧 and since each dodo only laid one at a time,<br/>
🎧 this probably had a devastating effect on populations.<br/>
🎧 However,<br/>
🎧 we now think that probably the main cause of the birds' extinction<br/>
🎧 was not the introduction of non-native species,<br/>
🎧 but the introduction of agriculture.<br/>
🎧 This meant that the forest that had once covered all the island,<br/>
🎧 and that had provided a perfect home for the dodo,<br/>
🎧 was cut down so that crops such as sugar could be grown.<br/>
🎧 So although the dodo had survived for thousands of years,<br/>
🎧 suddenly it was gone.<br/>
<br/><br/>
