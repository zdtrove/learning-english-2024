🎧 Hello?<br/>
🎧 Oh hello.<br/>
🎧 I was hoping</span> to speak to Jack</span> Fitzgerald</span> about renting</span> a cottage</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm his wife</span>, Shirley</span>, and we own the cottages</span> together,<br/>
🎧 so I'm sure I can help you.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 My name's</span> Tom</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some friends of ours</span> rented</span> Granary</span> Cottage</span> from you last year,<br/>
🎧 and they thought it was great.<br/>
🎧 So my wife</span> and I are hoping</span> to come in May for a week.<br/>
🎧 What date did you have in mind</span>?<br/>
🎧 The week beginning</span> the 14th</span>, if possible</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll just check..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm sorry, Tom</span>, it's already booked</span> that week.<br/>
🎧 It's free the week beginning</span> the 28th</span>, though, for seven</span> nights</span>.<br/>
🎧 In fact</span>, that's the only time you could have it in May.<br/>
🎧 Well, we could manage</span> that, I think.<br/>
🎧 We'd just need to change a couple</span> of things.<br/>
🎧 How much would it cost</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's the beginning</span> of high season</span>,<br/>
🎧 so it'd be £550</span> for the week.<br/>
🎧 That's a bit more than we wanted to pay, I'm afraid</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've budgeted</span> up to £500</span> for accommodation</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, we've just finished</span> converting</span> another building</span> into a cottage</span>,<br/>
🎧 which we're calling</span> Chervil</span> Cottage</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sorry? What was that again?<br/>
🎧 Chervil</span>.<br/>
🎧 C</span> H</span> E</span> R</span> V</span> for Victor</span> I L</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's a herb</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 It grows</span> fairly</span> wild</span> around here.<br/>
🎧 You could have that for the week you want for £480</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So could you tell me something about it, please?<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 The building</span> was built</span> as a garage</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a little smaller</span> than Granary</span> Cottage</span>.<br/>
🎧 So that must sleep</span> two people, as well?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 There's a double</span> bedroom</span>.<br/>
🎧 Does it have a garden?<br/>
🎧 Yes, you get to it from the living room through French</span> doors</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we provide</span> two deckchairs</span>.<br/>
🎧 We hope to build</span> a patio</span> in the near future,<br/>
🎧 but I wouldn't like to guarantee</span> it'll be finished</span> by May.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 The front</span> door</span> opens</span> onto</span> the old farmyard</span>,<br/>
🎧 and parking</span> isn't a problem</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 there's plenty</span> of room at the front</span> for that.<br/>
🎧 There are some trees</span> and potted</span> plants</span> there.<br/>
🎧 What about facilities</span> in the cottage</span>?<br/>
🎧 It has standard</span> things like a cooker</span> and fridge</span>, I presume</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the kitchen</span> area</span> there's a fridge-freezer<br/></span>
🎧 and we've just put in an electric</span> cooker</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is there a washing</span> machine</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 There's also a TV</span> in the living room, which plays</span> DVDs</span> too.<br/>
🎧 The bathroom</span> is too small for a bath</span>,<br/>
🎧 so there's a shower</span> instead</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think a lot of people prefer</span> that nowadays</span>, anyway</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's more environmentally</span> friendly</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Unless</span> you spend</span> half</span> the day in it!<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 What about heating</span>?<br/>
🎧 It sometimes gets</span> quite cool</span> at that time of year.<br/>
🎧 There's central</span> heating</span>, and if you want to light</span> a fire</span>, there's a stove</span>.<br/>
🎧 We can provide</span> all the wood</span> you need for it.<br/>
🎧 It smells</span> so much nicer</span> than coal</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it makes the room very cosy</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 we've got one in our own house.<br/>
🎧 That sounds very pleasant</span>.<br/>
🎧 Perhaps</span> we should come in the winter</span>, to make the most of it!<br/>
🎧 Yes, we find we don't want to go out when we've got the fire</span> burning</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are some attractive</span> views</span> from the cottage</span>, which I haven't mentioned</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's a famous stone</span> bridge</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 it's one of the oldest</span> in the region</span>,<br/>
🎧 and you can see it from the living room.<br/>
🎧 It isn't far</span> away.<br/>
🎧 The bedroom</span> window</span> looks in the opposite</span> direction</span>,<br/>
🎧 and has a lovely</span> view</span> of the hills</span> and the monument</span> at the top.<br/>
🎧 Well, that all sounds perfect.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to book it, please.<br/>
🎧 Would you want a deposit</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, we ask for 30%</span> to secure</span> your booking</span>,<br/>
🎧 so that'll</span> be..</span>. £144</span>.<br/>
🎧 And when would you like the rest</span> of the money?<br/>
🎧 You're coming</span> in May, so the last day of March</span>, please.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 Excellent</span>.<br/>
🎧 Could I just take your details..</span>.<br/>

🎧 Right. Next on the agenda</span> we have traffic</span> and highways</span>.<br/>
🎧 Councillor</span> Thornton</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Well, we now have the results</span> of the survey</span> carried</span> out last month<br/></span>
🎧 about traffic</span> and road</span> transport</span> in the town</span>.<br/>
🎧 People were generally</span> satisfied</span> with the state</span> of the roads</span>.<br/>
🎧 There were one or two complaints</span> about potholes</span> which will be addressed</span>,<br/>
🎧 but a significant</span> number of people complained</span> about the increasing</span> number of heavy</span> vehicles<br/></span>
🎧 using</span> our local</span> roads</span> to avoid</span> traffic</span> elsewhere</span>.<br/>
🎧 We'd expected</span> more complaints</span> by commuters<br/></span>
🎧 about the reduction</span> in the train</span> service</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it doesn't seem</span> to have affected</span> people too much.<br/>
🎧 The cycle</span> path</span> that runs</span> alongside</span> the river<br/></span>
🎧 is very well used by both cyclists</span> and pedestrians<br/></span>
🎧 since the surface</span> was improved</span> last year,<br/>
🎧 but overtaking</span> can be a problem<br/></span>
🎧 so we're going to add a bit on the side to make it wider</span>.<br/>
🎧 At some stage</span>, we'd like to extend</span> the path</span> so that it goes</span> all the way through the town</span>,<br/>
🎧 but that won't be happening</span> in the immediate</span> future.<br/>
🎧 The plans</span> to have a pedestrian</span> crossing</span> next to the Post</span> Office<br/></span>
🎧 have unfortunately</span> had to be put on hold</span> for the time being.<br/>
🎧 We'd budgeted</span> for this to be done this financial</span> year,<br/>
🎧 but then there were rumours</span> that the Post</span> Office</span> was going to move,<br/>
🎧 which would have meant</span> there wasn't really a need for a crossing</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now they've</span> confirmed</span> that they're staying</span> where they are,<br/>
🎧 but the Highways</span> Department</span> have told us that it would be dangerous</span> to have a pedestrian</span> crossing<br/></span>
🎧 where we'd originally</span> planned</span> it as there's a bend</span> in the road</span> there.<br/>
🎧 So that'll</span> need some more thought.<br/>
🎧 On Station</span> Road</span> near the station</span> and level</span> crossing</span>,<br/>
🎧 drivers</span> can face</span> quite long waits</span> if the level</span> crossing's</span> closed</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we've now got signs</span> up requesting</span> them not to leave their engines</span> running</span> at that time.<br/>
🎧 This means</span> pedestrians</span> waiting</span> on the pavement</span> to cross</span> the railway</span> line<br/></span>
🎧 don't have to breathe</span> in car fumes</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've had some problems</span> with cyclists</span> leaving</span> their bikes</span> chained</span> to the railings</span> outside the ticket</span> office</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the station</span> has agreed to provide</span> bike</span> racks</span> there.<br/>
🎧 So next on the agenda</span> is 'Proposals</span> for improvements</span> to the recreation</span> ground'</span>.<br/>
🎧 Councillor</span> Thornton</span> again.<br/>
🎧 Well, since we managed</span> to extend</span> the recreation</span> ground</span>,<br/>
🎧 we've spent</span> some time talking to local</span> people<br/></span>
🎧 about how it could be made a more attractive</span> and useful</span> space</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you have a look at the map up on the screen</span>,<br/>
🎧 you can see the river</span> up in the north</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the Community</span> Hall</span> near the entrance</span> from the road</span>.<br/>
🎧 At present</span>, cars</span> can park</span> between the Community</span> Hall</span> and that line</span> of trees</span> to the east</span>,<br/>
🎧 but this is quite dangerous</span> for pedestrians<br/></span>
🎧 so we're suggesting</span> a new car park</span> on the opposite</span> side of the Community</span> Hall</span>,<br/>
🎧 right next to it.<br/>
🎧 We also have a new location</span> for the cricket</span> pitch</span>.<br/>
🎧 As we've now purchased</span> additional</span> space</span> to the east</span> of the recreation</span> ground</span>,<br/>
🎧 beyond</span> the trees</span>,<br/>
🎧 we plan to move it away from its current</span> location</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is rather near the road</span>, into this new area</span> beyond</span> the line</span> of trees</span>.<br/>
🎧 This means</span> there's less danger</span> of stray</span> balls</span> hitting</span> cars</span> or pedestrians</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've got plans</span> for a children's</span> playground<br/></span>
🎧 which will be accessible</span> by a footpath</span> from the Community</span> Hall<br/></span>
🎧 and will be alongside</span> the river</span>.<br/>
🎧 We'd originally</span> thought of having it close</span> to the road</span>,<br/>
🎧 but we think this will be a more attractive</span> location</span>.<br/>
🎧 The skateboard</span> ramp</span> is very popular</span> with both younger</span> and older</span> children -<br/></span>
🎧 we had considered</span> moving</span> this up towards</span> the river</span>,<br/>
🎧 but in the end we decided</span> to have it in the southeast</span> corner</span> near the road</span>.<br/>
🎧 The pavilion</span> is very well used at present</span> by both football</span> players</span> and cricketers</span>.<br/>
🎧 It will stay</span> where it is now -<br/></span>
🎧 to the left</span> of the line</span> of trees</span> and near to the river</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 handy</span> for both the football</span> and cricket</span> pitches</span>.<br/>
🎧 And finally, we'll be getting a new notice</span> board</span> for local</span> information</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that will be directly</span> on people's</span> right<br/></span>
🎧 as they go from the road</span> into the recreation</span> ground</span>.<br/>

</div>
🎧 Now that we've done all the research</span> into bike-sharing</span> schemes</span> in cities</span> around the world</span>,<br/>
🎧 we need to think about how we're going to organise</span> our report</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I think we should start by talking about the benefits</span>.<br/>
🎧 I mean it's great that so many cities</span> have introduced</span> these schemes<br/></span>
🎧 where anyone</span> can pick</span> up a bike</span> from dozens</span> of different locations<br/></span>
🎧 and hire</span> it for a few hours.<br/>
🎧 It makes riding</span> a bike</span> very convenient</span> for people.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but the costs</span> can add up<br/></span>
🎧 and that puts</span> people on low incomes</span> off in some places</span>.<br/>
🎧 I suppose</span> so,<br/>
🎧 but if it means</span> more people in general</span> are cycling</span> rather than driving,<br/>
🎧 then because they're increasing</span> the amount of physical</span> activity</span> they do,<br/>
🎧 it's good for their health<br/></span>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 But isn't that of less importance</span>?<br/>
🎧 I mean, doesn't the impact</span> of reduced</span> emissions</span> on air pollution<br/></span>
🎧 have a more significant</span> effect</span> on people's</span> health</span>?<br/>
🎧 Certainly</span>, in some cities</span> bike-sharing</span> has made a big contribution</span> to that.<br/>
🎧 And also helped</span> to cut the number of cars</span> on the road</span> significantly</span>.<br/>
🎧 Which is the main</span> point</span>.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 But I'd say it's had less of an impact</span> on noise</span> pollution<br/></span>
🎧 because there are still loads</span> of buses</span> and lorries</span> around.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Shall we quickly discuss</span> the recommendations</span> we're going to make?<br/>
🎧 In order to ensure</span> bike-sharing</span> schemes</span> are successful</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Well, while I think it's nice to have really state-of-the-art</span> bikes</span> with things like GPS</span>,<br/>
🎧 I wouldn't say they're absolutely necessary</span>.<br/>
🎧 But some technical</span> things are really important -<br/></span>
🎧 like a fully</span> functional</span> app</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 so people can make payments</span> and book bikes</span> easily</span>.<br/>
🎧 Places</span> which haven't invested</span> in that have really struggled</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good point..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some people say there shouldn't be competing</span> companies</span> offering</span> separate</span> bike-sharing</span> schemes</span>,<br/>
🎧 but in some really big cities</span>, competition's</span> beneficial<br/></span>
🎧 and anyway</span> one company might not be able to manage</span> the whole thing.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Deciding</span> how much to invest</span> is a big question</span>.<br/>
🎧 Cities</span> which have opened</span> loads</span> of new bike</span> lanes<br/></span>
🎧 at the same time as introducing</span> bike-sharing</span> schemes</span> have generally</span> been more successful</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 but there are examples</span> of successful</span> schemes</span> where this hasn't happened..</span>.<br/>
🎧 What does matter</span> though -</span> is having a big publicity</span> campaign</span>.<br/>
🎧 Definitely.<br/>
🎧 If people don't know how to use the scheme</span> or don't understand</span> its benefits</span>,<br/>
🎧 they won't use it.<br/>
🎧 People need a lot of persuasion</span> to stop</span> using</span> their cars</span>.<br/>
🎧 Shall we look at some examples</span> now?<br/>
🎧 And say what we think is good or bad about them.<br/>
🎧 I suppose</span> we should start with Amsterdam<br/></span>
🎧 as this was one of the first cities</span> to have a bike-sharing</span> scheme</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 There was already a strong</span> culture</span> of cycling</span> here.<br/>
🎧 In a way it's strange</span> that there was such a demand</span> for bike-sharing<br/></span>
🎧 because you'd have thought most people would have used their own bikes</span>.<br/>
🎧 And yet it's one of the best-used</span> schemes..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Dublin's</span> an interesting</span> example of a success story</span>.<br/>
🎧 It must be because the public</span> transport</span> system's</span> quite limited</span>.<br/>
🎧 Not really -<br/></span>
🎧 there's no underground</span>, but there are trams</span> and a good bus network</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd say price</span> has a lot to do with it.<br/>
🎧 It's one of the cheapest</span> schemes</span> in Europe</span> to join.<br/>
🎧 But the buses</span> are really slow</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 anyway</span> the weather</span> certainly</span> can't be a factor</span>!<br/>
🎧 No -</span> definitely not.<br/>
🎧 The London</span> scheme's</span> been quite successful<br/></span>
🎧 Yes -</span> it's been a really good thing for the city</span>.<br/>
🎧 The bikes</span> are popular</span> and the whole system</span> is well maintained<br/></span>
🎧 but it isn't expanding</span> quickly enough.<br/>
🎧 Basically</span>, not enough's</span> been spent</span> on increasing</span> the number of cycle</span> lanes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hopefully</span> that'll</span> change.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Now what about outside Europe</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well bike-sharing</span> schemes</span> have taken off in places</span> like Buenos</span> Aires</span>.<br/>
🎧 They built</span> a huge</span> network</span> of cycle</span> lanes</span> to support</span> the introduction</span> of the scheme</span> there, didn't they?<br/>
🎧 It attracted</span> huge</span> numbers</span> of cyclists</span> where previously</span> there were hardly</span> any.<br/>
🎧 An example of good planning.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely.<br/>
🎧 New York</span> is a good example of how not to introduce</span> a scheme</span>.<br/>
🎧 When they launched</span> it,<br/>
🎧 it was more than ten times</span> the price</span> of most other schemes</span>.<br/>
🎧 More than it costs</span> to take a taxi</span>, crazy</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think the organisers</span> lacked</span> vision</span> and ambition</span> there.<br/>
🎧 I think so too.<br/>
🎧 Sydney</span> would be a good example to use.<br/>
🎧 I would have expected</span> it to have grown</span> pretty</span> quickly here.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 I can't quite work out why it hasn't been an instant</span> success like some of the others</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a shame</span> really.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 OK so now we've thought about..</span>.<br/>

🎧 One of the most famous cases</span> of extinction</span> is that of a bird</span> known</span> as the dodo</span>.<br/>
🎧 In fact</span> there's even a saying in English, 'as</span> dead</span> as the dodo'</span>,<br/>
🎧 used to refer</span> to something which no longer</span> exists</span>.<br/>
🎧 But for many centuries</span> the dodo</span> was alive</span> and well,<br/>
🎧 although it could only be found</span> in one place,<br/>
🎧 the island</span> of Mauritius</span> in the Indian</span> Ocean</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was a very large bird</span>, about one metre</span> tall</span>,<br/>
🎧 and over the centuries</span> it had lost</span> the ability</span> to fly,<br/>
🎧 but it survived</span> happily</span> under the trees</span> that covered</span> the island</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then in the year 1507</span>,<br/>
🎧 the first Portuguese</span> ships</span> stopped</span> at the island</span>.<br/>
🎧 The sailors</span> were carrying</span> spices</span> back to Europe</span>,<br/>
🎧 and found</span> the island</span> a convenient</span> stopping</span> place<br/></span>
🎧 where they could stock</span> up with food and water for the rest</span> of the voyage</span>,<br/>
🎧 but they didn't settle</span> on Mauritius</span>.<br/>
🎧 However</span>, in 1638<br/></span>
🎧 the Dutch</span> arrived</span> and set up a colony</span> there.<br/>
🎧 These first human</span> inhabitants</span> of the island<br/></span>
🎧 found</span> the dodo</span> birds</span> a convenient</span> source</span> of meat</span>,<br/>
🎧 although not everyone liked</span> the taste</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's hard</span> to get an accurate</span> description</span> of what the dodo</span> actually looked</span> like.<br/>
🎧 We do have some written</span> records</span> from sailors</span>,<br/>
🎧 and a few pictures</span>,<br/>
🎧 but we don't know how reliable</span> these are.<br/>
🎧 The best-known</span> picture</span> is a Dutch</span> painting</span>,<br/>
🎧 in which the bird</span> appears</span> to be extremely</span> fat,<br/>
🎧 but this may not be accurate</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 an Indian</span> painting</span> done at the same time shows</span> a much thinner</span> bird</span>.<br/>
🎧 Although attempts</span> were made to preserve</span> the bodies</span> of some of the birds</span>,<br/>
🎧 no complete</span> specimen</span> survives</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the early</span> 17th</span> century<br/></span>
🎧 four</span> dried</span> parts</span> of a bird</span> were known</span> to exist</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 of these, three</span> have disappeared</span>,<br/>
🎧 so only one example of soft</span> tissue</span> from the dodo</span> survives</span>,<br/>
🎧 a dodo</span> head</span>.<br/>
🎧 Bones</span> have also been found</span>,<br/>
🎧 but there's only one complete</span> skeleton</span> in existence</span>.<br/>
🎧 This single</span> dodo</span> skeleton</span> has recently</span> been the subject</span> of scientific</span> research<br/></span>
🎧 which suggests</span> that many of the earlier</span> beliefs</span> about dodos<br/></span>
🎧 may have been incorrect</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example,<br/>
🎧 early</span> accounts</span> of the birds</span> mention</span> how slow</span> and clumsy</span> it was,<br/>
🎧 but scientists</span> now believe<br/></span>
🎧 the bird's</span> strong</span> knee</span> joints</span> would have made it capable</span> of movement</span> which was not slow</span>,<br/>
🎧 but actually quite fast</span>.<br/>
🎧 In fact</span>, one 17th</span> century</span> sailor</span> wrote</span> that he found</span> the birds</span> hard</span> to catch.<br/>
🎧 It's true</span> that the dodo's</span> small wings</span> wouldn't have allowed</span> it to leave the ground</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the scientists</span> suggest</span> that these were probably employed</span> for balance<br/></span>
🎧 while going over uneven</span> ground</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another group of scientists</span> carried</span> out analysis</span> of the dodo's</span> skull</span>.<br/>
🎧 They found</span> that the reports</span> of the lack</span> of intelligence</span> of the dodo<br/></span>
🎧 were not borne</span> out by their research</span>,<br/>
🎧 which suggested</span> the bird's</span> brain</span> was not small,<br/>
🎧 but average</span> in size.<br/>
🎧 In fact</span>, in relation</span> to its body</span> size,<br/>
🎧 it was similar</span> to that of the pigeon</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is known</span> to be a highly</span> intelligent</span> bird</span>.<br/>
🎧 The researchers</span> also found</span> that the structure</span> of the bird's</span> skull<br/></span>
🎧 suggested</span> that one sense</span> which was particularly</span> well-developed</span> was that of smell</span>.<br/>
🎧 So the dodo</span> may also have been particularly</span> good at locating</span> ripe</span> fruit<br/></span>
🎧 and other food in the island's</span> thick</span> vegetation</span>.<br/>
🎧 So it looks as if the dodo</span> was better able to survive</span> and defend</span> itself</span> than was originally</span> believed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yet less than 200</span> years after Europeans</span> first arrived</span> on the island</span>,<br/>
🎧 they had become extinct</span>.<br/>
🎧 So what was the reason</span> for this?<br/>
🎧 For a long time, it was believed</span> that the dodos</span> were hunted</span> to extinction</span>,<br/>
🎧 but scientists</span> now believe</span> the situation</span> was more complicated</span> than this.<br/>
🎧 Another factor</span> may have been the new species</span> brought</span> to the island</span> by the sailors</span>.<br/>
🎧 These included</span> dogs</span>, which would have been a threat</span> to the dodos</span>,<br/>
🎧 and also monkeys</span>,<br/>
🎧 which ate</span> the fruit</span> that was the main</span> part</span> of the dodos'</span> diet</span>.<br/>
🎧 These were brought</span> to the island</span> deliberately</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the ships</span> also brought</span> another type</span> of creature</span> -</span> rats</span>,<br/>
🎧 which came to land</span> from the ships</span> and rapidly</span> overran</span> the island</span>.<br/>
🎧 These upset</span> the ecology</span> of the island</span>,<br/>
🎧 not just the dodos</span> but other species</span> too.<br/>
🎧 However</span>,<br/>
🎧 they were a particular</span> danger</span> to the dodos<br/></span>
🎧 because they consumed</span> their eggs</span>,<br/>
🎧 and since each dodo</span> only laid</span> one at a time,<br/>
🎧 this probably had a devastating</span> effect</span> on populations</span>.<br/>
🎧 However</span>,<br/>
🎧 we now think that probably the main</span> cause</span> of the birds'</span> extinction<br/></span>
🎧 was not the introduction</span> of non-native</span> species</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the introduction</span> of agriculture</span>.<br/>
🎧 This meant</span> that the forest</span> that had once covered</span> all the island</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that had provided</span> a perfect home for the dodo</span>,<br/>
🎧 was cut down so that crops</span> such as sugar</span> could be grown</span>.<br/>
🎧 So although the dodo</span> had survived</span> for thousands</span> of years,<br/>
🎧 suddenly</span> it was gone</span>.<br/>
