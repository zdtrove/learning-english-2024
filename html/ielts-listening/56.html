🎧 Hello?<br/>
🎧 Oh hello.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>hoping</span> to speak to <span>Jack</span> <span>Fitzgerald</span> about <span>renting</span> a <span>cottage</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm his <span>wife</span>, <span>Shirley</span>, and we own the <span>cottages</span> together,<br/>
🎧 so I'm sure I can help you.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 My <span>name's</span> <span>Tom</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some friends of <span>ours</span> <span>rented</span> <span>Granary</span> <span>Cottage</span> from you last year,<br/>
🎧 and they thought it was great.<br/>
🎧 So my <span>wife</span> and I are <span>hoping</span> to come in May for a week.<br/>
🎧 What date did you have in <span>mind</span>?<br/>
🎧 The week <span>beginning</span> the <span>14th</span>, if <span>possible</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll just <span>check..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm sorry, <span>Tom</span>, it's already <span>booked</span> that week.<br/>
🎧 It's free the week <span>beginning</span> the <span>28th</span>, though, for <span>seven</span> <span>nights</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, that's the only time you could have it in May.<br/>
🎧 Well, we could <span>manage</span> that, I think.<br/>
🎧 We'd just need to change a <span>couple</span> of things.<br/>
🎧 How much would it <span>cost</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's the <span>beginning</span> of high <span>season</span>,<br/>
🎧 so it'd be <span>£550</span> for the week.<br/>
🎧 That's a bit more than we wanted to pay, I'm <span>afraid</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've <span>budgeted</span> up to <span>£500</span> for <span>accommodation</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, we've just <span>finished</span> <span>converting</span> another <span>building</span> into a <span>cottage</span>,<br/>
🎧 which we're <span>calling</span> <span>Chervil</span> <span>Cottage</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sorry? What was that again?<br/>
🎧 <span>Chervil</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>C</span> <span>H</span> <span>E</span> <span>R</span> <span>V</span> for <span>Victor</span> I <span>L</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's a <span>herb</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 It <span>grows</span> <span>fairly</span> <span>wild</span> around here.<br/>
🎧 You could have that for the week you want for <span>£480</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So could you tell me something about it, please?<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 The <span>building</span> was <span>built</span> as a <span>garage</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a little <span>smaller</span> than <span>Granary</span> <span>Cottage</span>.<br/>
🎧 So that must <span>sleep</span> two people, as well?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>double</span> <span>bedroom</span>.<br/>
🎧 Does it have a garden?<br/>
🎧 Yes, you get to it from the living room through <span>French</span> <span>doors</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we <span>provide</span> two <span>deckchairs</span>.<br/>
🎧 We hope to <span>build</span> a <span>patio</span> in the near future,<br/>
🎧 but I wouldn't like to <span>guarantee</span> it'll be <span>finished</span> by May.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 The <span>front</span> <span>door</span> <span>opens</span> <span>onto</span> the old <span>farmyard</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>parking</span> isn't a <span>problem</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 there's <span>plenty</span> of room at the <span>front</span> for that.<br/>
🎧 There are some <span>trees</span> and <span>potted</span> <span>plants</span> there.<br/>
🎧 What about <span>facilities</span> in the <span>cottage</span>?<br/>
🎧 It has <span>standard</span> things like a <span>cooker</span> and <span>fridge</span>, I <span>presume</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>kitchen</span> <span>area</span> there's a <span>fridge-freezer<br/></span>
🎧 and we've just put in an <span>electric</span> <span>cooker</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is there a <span>washing</span> <span>machine</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 There's also a <span>TV</span> in the living room, which <span>plays</span> <span>DVDs</span> too.<br/>
🎧 The <span>bathroom</span> is too small for a <span>bath</span>,<br/>
🎧 so there's a <span>shower</span> <span>instead</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think a lot of people <span>prefer</span> that <span>nowadays</span>, <span>anyway</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's more <span>environmentally</span> <span>friendly</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 <span>Unless</span> you <span>spend</span> <span>half</span> the day in it!<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 What about <span>heating</span>?<br/>
🎧 It sometimes <span>gets</span> quite <span>cool</span> at that time of year.<br/>
🎧 There's <span>central</span> <span>heating</span>, and if you want to <span>light</span> a <span>fire</span>, there's a <span>stove</span>.<br/>
🎧 We can <span>provide</span> all the <span>wood</span> you need for it.<br/>
🎧 It <span>smells</span> so much <span>nicer</span> than <span>coal</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it makes the room very <span>cosy</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 we've got one in our own house.<br/>
🎧 That sounds very <span>pleasant</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Perhaps</span> we should come in the <span>winter</span>, to make the most of it!<br/>
🎧 Yes, we find we don't want to go out when we've got the <span>fire</span> <span>burning</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are some <span>attractive</span> <span>views</span> from the <span>cottage</span>, which I haven't <span>mentioned</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's a famous <span>stone</span> <span>bridge</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it's one of the <span>oldest</span> in the <span>region</span>,<br/>
🎧 and you can see it from the living room.<br/>
🎧 It isn't <span>far</span> away.<br/>
🎧 The <span>bedroom</span> <span>window</span> looks in the <span>opposite</span> <span>direction</span>,<br/>
🎧 and has a <span>lovely</span> <span>view</span> of the <span>hills</span> and the <span>monument</span> at the top.<br/>
🎧 Well, that all sounds perfect.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to book it, please.<br/>
🎧 Would you want a <span>deposit</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, we ask for <span>30%</span> to <span>secure</span> your <span>booking</span>,<br/>
🎧 so <span>that'll</span> <span>be..</span>. <span>£144</span>.<br/>
🎧 And when would you like the <span>rest</span> of the money?<br/>
🎧 You're <span>coming</span> in May, so the last day of <span>March</span>, please.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 <span>Excellent</span>.<br/>
🎧 Could I just take your <span>details..</span>.<br/>

🎧 Right. Next on the <span>agenda</span> we have <span>traffic</span> and <span>highways</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Councillor</span> <span>Thornton</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Well, we now have the <span>results</span> of the <span>survey</span> <span>carried</span> out last <span>month<br/></span>
🎧 about <span>traffic</span> and <span>road</span> <span>transport</span> in the <span>town</span>.<br/>
🎧 People were <span>generally</span> <span>satisfied</span> with the <span>state</span> of the <span>roads</span>.<br/>
🎧 There were one or two <span>complaints</span> about <span>potholes</span> which will be <span>addressed</span>,<br/>
🎧 but a <span>significant</span> number of people <span>complained</span> about the <span>increasing</span> number of <span>heavy</span> <span>vehicles<br/></span>
🎧 <span>using</span> our <span>local</span> <span>roads</span> to <span>avoid</span> <span>traffic</span> <span>elsewhere</span>.<br/>
🎧 We'd <span>expected</span> more <span>complaints</span> by <span>commuters<br/></span>
🎧 about the <span>reduction</span> in the <span>train</span> <span>service</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it doesn't <span>seem</span> to have <span>affected</span> people too much.<br/>
🎧 The <span>cycle</span> <span>path</span> that <span>runs</span> <span>alongside</span> the <span>river<br/></span>
🎧 is very well used by both <span>cyclists</span> and <span>pedestrians<br/></span>
🎧 since the <span>surface</span> was <span>improved</span> last year,<br/>
🎧 but <span>overtaking</span> can be a <span>problem<br/></span>
🎧 so we're going to add a bit on the side to make it <span>wider</span>.<br/>
🎧 At some <span>stage</span>, we'd like to <span>extend</span> the <span>path</span> so that it <span>goes</span> all the way through the <span>town</span>,<br/>
🎧 but that won't be <span>happening</span> in the <span>immediate</span> future.<br/>
🎧 The <span>plans</span> to have a <span>pedestrian</span> <span>crossing</span> next to the <span>Post</span> <span>Office<br/></span>
🎧 have <span>unfortunately</span> had to be put on <span>hold</span> for the time being.<br/>
🎧 We'd <span>budgeted</span> for this to be done this <span>financial</span> year,<br/>
🎧 but then there were <span>rumours</span> that the <span>Post</span> <span>Office</span> was going to move,<br/>
🎧 which would have <span>meant</span> there wasn't really a need for a <span>crossing</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now <span>they've</span> <span>confirmed</span> that they're <span>staying</span> where they are,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>Highways</span> <span>Department</span> have told us that it would be <span>dangerous</span> to have a <span>pedestrian</span> <span>crossing<br/></span>
🎧 where we'd <span>originally</span> <span>planned</span> it as there's a <span>bend</span> in the <span>road</span> there.<br/>
🎧 So <span>that'll</span> need some more thought.<br/>
🎧 On <span>Station</span> <span>Road</span> near the <span>station</span> and <span>level</span> <span>crossing</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>drivers</span> can <span>face</span> quite long <span>waits</span> if the <span>level</span> <span>crossing's</span> <span>closed</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we've now got <span>signs</span> up <span>requesting</span> them not to leave their <span>engines</span> <span>running</span> at that time.<br/>
🎧 This <span>means</span> <span>pedestrians</span> <span>waiting</span> on the <span>pavement</span> to <span>cross</span> the <span>railway</span> <span>line<br/></span>
🎧 don't have to <span>breathe</span> in car <span>fumes</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've had some <span>problems</span> with <span>cyclists</span> <span>leaving</span> their <span>bikes</span> <span>chained</span> to the <span>railings</span> outside the <span>ticket</span> <span>office</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>station</span> has agreed to <span>provide</span> <span>bike</span> <span>racks</span> there.<br/>
🎧 So next on the <span>agenda</span> is <span>'Proposals</span> for <span>improvements</span> to the <span>recreation</span> <span>ground'</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Councillor</span> <span>Thornton</span> again.<br/>
🎧 Well, since we <span>managed</span> to <span>extend</span> the <span>recreation</span> <span>ground</span>,<br/>
🎧 we've <span>spent</span> some time talking to <span>local</span> <span>people<br/></span>
🎧 about how it could be made a more <span>attractive</span> and <span>useful</span> <span>space</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you have a look at the map up on the <span>screen</span>,<br/>
🎧 you can see the <span>river</span> up in the <span>north</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>Community</span> <span>Hall</span> near the <span>entrance</span> from the <span>road</span>.<br/>
🎧 At <span>present</span>, <span>cars</span> can <span>park</span> between the <span>Community</span> <span>Hall</span> and that <span>line</span> of <span>trees</span> to the <span>east</span>,<br/>
🎧 but this is quite <span>dangerous</span> for <span>pedestrians<br/></span>
🎧 so we're <span>suggesting</span> a new car <span>park</span> on the <span>opposite</span> side of the <span>Community</span> <span>Hall</span>,<br/>
🎧 right next to it.<br/>
🎧 We also have a new <span>location</span> for the <span>cricket</span> <span>pitch</span>.<br/>
🎧 As we've now <span>purchased</span> <span>additional</span> <span>space</span> to the <span>east</span> of the <span>recreation</span> <span>ground</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>beyond</span> the <span>trees</span>,<br/>
🎧 we plan to move it away from its <span>current</span> <span>location</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is rather near the <span>road</span>, into this new <span>area</span> <span>beyond</span> the <span>line</span> of <span>trees</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>means</span> there's less <span>danger</span> of <span>stray</span> <span>balls</span> <span>hitting</span> <span>cars</span> or <span>pedestrians</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've got <span>plans</span> for a <span>children's</span> <span>playground<br/></span>
🎧 which will be <span>accessible</span> by a <span>footpath</span> from the <span>Community</span> <span>Hall<br/></span>
🎧 and will be <span>alongside</span> the <span>river</span>.<br/>
🎧 We'd <span>originally</span> thought of having it <span>close</span> to the <span>road</span>,<br/>
🎧 but we think this will be a more <span>attractive</span> <span>location</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>skateboard</span> <span>ramp</span> is very <span>popular</span> with both <span>younger</span> and <span>older</span> children <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 we had <span>considered</span> <span>moving</span> this up <span>towards</span> the <span>river</span>,<br/>
🎧 but in the end we <span>decided</span> to have it in the <span>southeast</span> <span>corner</span> near the <span>road</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>pavilion</span> is very well used at <span>present</span> by both <span>football</span> <span>players</span> and <span>cricketers</span>.<br/>
🎧 It will <span>stay</span> where it is now <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 to the <span>left</span> of the <span>line</span> of <span>trees</span> and near to the <span>river</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>handy</span> for both the <span>football</span> and <span>cricket</span> <span>pitches</span>.<br/>
🎧 And finally, we'll be getting a new <span>notice</span> <span>board</span> for <span>local</span> <span>information</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that will be <span>directly</span> on <span>people's</span> <span>right<br/></span>
🎧 as they go from the <span>road</span> into the <span>recreation</span> <span>ground</span>.<br/>

🎧 Now that we've done all the <span>research</span> into <span>bike-sharing</span> <span>schemes</span> in <span>cities</span> around the <span>world</span>,<br/>
🎧 we need to think about how we're going to <span>organise</span> our <span>report</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I think we should start by talking about the <span>benefits</span>.<br/>
🎧 I mean it's great that so many <span>cities</span> have <span>introduced</span> these <span>schemes<br/></span>
🎧 where <span>anyone</span> can <span>pick</span> up a <span>bike</span> from <span>dozens</span> of different <span>locations<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>hire</span> it for a few hours.<br/>
🎧 It makes <span>riding</span> a <span>bike</span> very <span>convenient</span> for people.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but the <span>costs</span> can add <span>up<br/></span>
🎧 and that <span>puts</span> people on low <span>incomes</span> off in some <span>places</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> so,<br/>
🎧 but if it <span>means</span> more people in <span>general</span> are <span>cycling</span> rather than driving,<br/>
🎧 then because they're <span>increasing</span> the amount of <span>physical</span> <span>activity</span> they do,<br/>
🎧 it's good for their <span>health<br/></span>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 But isn't that of less <span>importance</span>?<br/>
🎧 I mean, doesn't the <span>impact</span> of <span>reduced</span> <span>emissions</span> on air <span>pollution<br/></span>
🎧 have a more <span>significant</span> <span>effect</span> on <span>people's</span> <span>health</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Certainly</span>, in some <span>cities</span> <span>bike-sharing</span> has made a big <span>contribution</span> to that.<br/>
🎧 And also <span>helped</span> to cut the number of <span>cars</span> on the <span>road</span> <span>significantly</span>.<br/>
🎧 Which is the <span>main</span> <span>point</span>.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 But I'd say it's had less of an <span>impact</span> on <span>noise</span> <span>pollution<br/></span>
🎧 because there are still <span>loads</span> of <span>buses</span> and <span>lorries</span> around.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Shall we quickly <span>discuss</span> the <span>recommendations</span> we're going to make?<br/>
🎧 In order to <span>ensure</span> <span>bike-sharing</span> <span>schemes</span> are <span>successful</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Well, while I think it's nice to have really <span>state-of-the-art</span> <span>bikes</span> with things like <span>GPS</span>,<br/>
🎧 I wouldn't say they're absolutely <span>necessary</span>.<br/>
🎧 But some <span>technical</span> things are really important <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 like a <span>fully</span> <span>functional</span> <span>app</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 so people can make <span>payments</span> and book <span>bikes</span> <span>easily</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Places</span> which haven't <span>invested</span> in that have really <span>struggled</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good <span>point..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some people say there shouldn't be <span>competing</span> <span>companies</span> <span>offering</span> <span>separate</span> <span>bike-sharing</span> <span>schemes</span>,<br/>
🎧 but in some really big <span>cities</span>, <span>competition's</span> <span>beneficial<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>anyway</span> one company might not be able to <span>manage</span> the whole thing.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 <span>Deciding</span> how much to <span>invest</span> is a big <span>question</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Cities</span> which have <span>opened</span> <span>loads</span> of new <span>bike</span> <span>lanes<br/></span>
🎧 at the same time as <span>introducing</span> <span>bike-sharing</span> <span>schemes</span> have <span>generally</span> been more <span>successful</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 but there are <span>examples</span> of <span>successful</span> <span>schemes</span> where this hasn't <span>happened..</span>.<br/>
🎧 What does <span>matter</span> though <span>-</span> is having a big <span>publicity</span> <span>campaign</span>.<br/>
🎧 Definitely.<br/>
🎧 If people don't know how to use the <span>scheme</span> or don't <span>understand</span> its <span>benefits</span>,<br/>
🎧 they won't use it.<br/>
🎧 People need a lot of <span>persuasion</span> to <span>stop</span> <span>using</span> their <span>cars</span>.<br/>
🎧 Shall we look at some <span>examples</span> now?<br/>
🎧 And say what we think is good or bad about them.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> we should start with <span>Amsterdam<br/></span>
🎧 as this was one of the first <span>cities</span> to have a <span>bike-sharing</span> <span>scheme</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 There was already a <span>strong</span> <span>culture</span> of <span>cycling</span> here.<br/>
🎧 In a way it's <span>strange</span> that there was such a <span>demand</span> for <span>bike-sharing<br/></span>
🎧 because you'd have thought most people would have used their own <span>bikes</span>.<br/>
🎧 And yet it's one of the <span>best-used</span> <span>schemes..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Dublin's</span> an <span>interesting</span> example of a success <span>story</span>.<br/>
🎧 It must be because the <span>public</span> <span>transport</span> <span>system's</span> quite <span>limited</span>.<br/>
🎧 Not really <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 there's no <span>underground</span>, but there are <span>trams</span> and a good bus <span>network</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd say <span>price</span> has a lot to do with it.<br/>
🎧 It's one of the <span>cheapest</span> <span>schemes</span> in <span>Europe</span> to join.<br/>
🎧 But the <span>buses</span> are really <span>slow</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>anyway</span> the <span>weather</span> <span>certainly</span> can't be a <span>factor</span>!<br/>
🎧 No <span>-</span> definitely not.<br/>
🎧 The <span>London</span> <span>scheme's</span> been quite <span>successful<br/></span>
🎧 Yes <span>-</span> it's been a really good thing for the <span>city</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>bikes</span> are <span>popular</span> and the whole <span>system</span> is well <span>maintained<br/></span>
🎧 but it isn't <span>expanding</span> quickly enough.<br/>
🎧 <span>Basically</span>, not <span>enough's</span> been <span>spent</span> on <span>increasing</span> the number of <span>cycle</span> <span>lanes</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hopefully</span> <span>that'll</span> change.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Now what about outside <span>Europe</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well <span>bike-sharing</span> <span>schemes</span> have taken off in <span>places</span> like <span>Buenos</span> <span>Aires</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>built</span> a <span>huge</span> <span>network</span> of <span>cycle</span> <span>lanes</span> to <span>support</span> the <span>introduction</span> of the <span>scheme</span> there, didn't they?<br/>
🎧 It <span>attracted</span> <span>huge</span> <span>numbers</span> of <span>cyclists</span> where <span>previously</span> there were <span>hardly</span> any.<br/>
🎧 An example of good planning.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely.<br/>
🎧 New <span>York</span> is a good example of how not to <span>introduce</span> a <span>scheme</span>.<br/>
🎧 When they <span>launched</span> it,<br/>
🎧 it was more than ten <span>times</span> the <span>price</span> of most other <span>schemes</span>.<br/>
🎧 More than it <span>costs</span> to take a <span>taxi</span>, <span>crazy</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think the <span>organisers</span> <span>lacked</span> <span>vision</span> and <span>ambition</span> there.<br/>
🎧 I think so too.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sydney</span> would be a good example to use.<br/>
🎧 I would have <span>expected</span> it to have <span>grown</span> <span>pretty</span> quickly here.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 I can't quite work out why it hasn't been an <span>instant</span> success like some of the <span>others</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>shame</span> really.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 OK so now we've thought <span>about..</span>.<br/>

🎧 One of the most famous <span>cases</span> of <span>extinction</span> is that of a <span>bird</span> <span>known</span> as the <span>dodo</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span> there's even a saying in English, <span>'as</span> <span>dead</span> as the <span>dodo'</span>,<br/>
🎧 used to <span>refer</span> to something which no <span>longer</span> <span>exists</span>.<br/>
🎧 But for many <span>centuries</span> the <span>dodo</span> was <span>alive</span> and well,<br/>
🎧 although it could only be <span>found</span> in one place,<br/>
🎧 the <span>island</span> of <span>Mauritius</span> in the <span>Indian</span> <span>Ocean</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was a very large <span>bird</span>, about one <span>metre</span> <span>tall</span>,<br/>
🎧 and over the <span>centuries</span> it had <span>lost</span> the <span>ability</span> to fly,<br/>
🎧 but it <span>survived</span> <span>happily</span> under the <span>trees</span> that <span>covered</span> the <span>island</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then in the year <span>1507</span>,<br/>
🎧 the first <span>Portuguese</span> <span>ships</span> <span>stopped</span> at the <span>island</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>sailors</span> were <span>carrying</span> <span>spices</span> back to <span>Europe</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>found</span> the <span>island</span> a <span>convenient</span> <span>stopping</span> <span>place<br/></span>
🎧 where they could <span>stock</span> up with food and water for the <span>rest</span> of the <span>voyage</span>,<br/>
🎧 but they didn't <span>settle</span> on <span>Mauritius</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, in <span>1638<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>Dutch</span> <span>arrived</span> and set up a <span>colony</span> there.<br/>
🎧 These first <span>human</span> <span>inhabitants</span> of the <span>island<br/></span>
🎧 <span>found</span> the <span>dodo</span> <span>birds</span> a <span>convenient</span> <span>source</span> of <span>meat</span>,<br/>
🎧 although not everyone <span>liked</span> the <span>taste</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>hard</span> to get an <span>accurate</span> <span>description</span> of what the <span>dodo</span> actually <span>looked</span> like.<br/>
🎧 We do have some <span>written</span> <span>records</span> from <span>sailors</span>,<br/>
🎧 and a few <span>pictures</span>,<br/>
🎧 but we don't know how <span>reliable</span> these are.<br/>
🎧 The <span>best-known</span> <span>picture</span> is a <span>Dutch</span> <span>painting</span>,<br/>
🎧 in which the <span>bird</span> <span>appears</span> to be <span>extremely</span> fat,<br/>
🎧 but this may not be <span>accurate</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 an <span>Indian</span> <span>painting</span> done at the same time <span>shows</span> a much <span>thinner</span> <span>bird</span>.<br/>
🎧 Although <span>attempts</span> were made to <span>preserve</span> the <span>bodies</span> of some of the <span>birds</span>,<br/>
🎧 no <span>complete</span> <span>specimen</span> <span>survives</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>early</span> <span>17th</span> <span>century<br/></span>
🎧 <span>four</span> <span>dried</span> <span>parts</span> of a <span>bird</span> were <span>known</span> to <span>exist</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 of these, <span>three</span> have <span>disappeared</span>,<br/>
🎧 so only one example of <span>soft</span> <span>tissue</span> from the <span>dodo</span> <span>survives</span>,<br/>
🎧 a <span>dodo</span> <span>head</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Bones</span> have also been <span>found</span>,<br/>
🎧 but there's only one <span>complete</span> <span>skeleton</span> in <span>existence</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>single</span> <span>dodo</span> <span>skeleton</span> has <span>recently</span> been the <span>subject</span> of <span>scientific</span> <span>research<br/></span>
🎧 which <span>suggests</span> that many of the <span>earlier</span> <span>beliefs</span> about <span>dodos<br/></span>
🎧 may have been <span>incorrect</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example,<br/>
🎧 <span>early</span> <span>accounts</span> of the <span>birds</span> <span>mention</span> how <span>slow</span> and <span>clumsy</span> it was,<br/>
🎧 but <span>scientists</span> now <span>believe<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>bird's</span> <span>strong</span> <span>knee</span> <span>joints</span> would have made it <span>capable</span> of <span>movement</span> which was not <span>slow</span>,<br/>
🎧 but actually quite <span>fast</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, one <span>17th</span> <span>century</span> <span>sailor</span> <span>wrote</span> that he <span>found</span> the <span>birds</span> <span>hard</span> to catch.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>true</span> that the <span>dodo's</span> small <span>wings</span> wouldn't have <span>allowed</span> it to leave the <span>ground</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>scientists</span> <span>suggest</span> that these were probably <span>employed</span> for <span>balance<br/></span>
🎧 while going over <span>uneven</span> <span>ground</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another group of <span>scientists</span> <span>carried</span> out <span>analysis</span> of the <span>dodo's</span> <span>skull</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>found</span> that the <span>reports</span> of the <span>lack</span> of <span>intelligence</span> of the <span>dodo<br/></span>
🎧 were not <span>borne</span> out by their <span>research</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>suggested</span> the <span>bird's</span> <span>brain</span> was not small,<br/>
🎧 but <span>average</span> in size.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, in <span>relation</span> to its <span>body</span> size,<br/>
🎧 it was <span>similar</span> to that of the <span>pigeon</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is <span>known</span> to be a <span>highly</span> <span>intelligent</span> <span>bird</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>researchers</span> also <span>found</span> that the <span>structure</span> of the <span>bird's</span> <span>skull<br/></span>
🎧 <span>suggested</span> that one <span>sense</span> which was <span>particularly</span> <span>well-developed</span> was that of <span>smell</span>.<br/>
🎧 So the <span>dodo</span> may also have been <span>particularly</span> good at <span>locating</span> <span>ripe</span> <span>fruit<br/></span>
🎧 and other food in the <span>island's</span> <span>thick</span> <span>vegetation</span>.<br/>
🎧 So it looks as if the <span>dodo</span> was better able to <span>survive</span> and <span>defend</span> <span>itself</span> than was <span>originally</span> <span>believed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yet less than <span>200</span> years after <span>Europeans</span> first <span>arrived</span> on the <span>island</span>,<br/>
🎧 they had become <span>extinct</span>.<br/>
🎧 So what was the <span>reason</span> for this?<br/>
🎧 For a long time, it was <span>believed</span> that the <span>dodos</span> were <span>hunted</span> to <span>extinction</span>,<br/>
🎧 but <span>scientists</span> now <span>believe</span> the <span>situation</span> was more <span>complicated</span> than this.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>factor</span> may have been the new <span>species</span> <span>brought</span> to the <span>island</span> by the <span>sailors</span>.<br/>
🎧 These <span>included</span> <span>dogs</span>, which would have been a <span>threat</span> to the <span>dodos</span>,<br/>
🎧 and also <span>monkeys</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>ate</span> the <span>fruit</span> that was the <span>main</span> <span>part</span> of the <span>dodos'</span> <span>diet</span>.<br/>
🎧 These were <span>brought</span> to the <span>island</span> <span>deliberately</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>ships</span> also <span>brought</span> another <span>type</span> of <span>creature</span> <span>-</span> <span>rats</span>,<br/>
🎧 which came to <span>land</span> from the <span>ships</span> and <span>rapidly</span> <span>overran</span> the <span>island</span>.<br/>
🎧 These <span>upset</span> the <span>ecology</span> of the <span>island</span>,<br/>
🎧 not just the <span>dodos</span> but other <span>species</span> too.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>,<br/>
🎧 they were a <span>particular</span> <span>danger</span> to the <span>dodos<br/></span>
🎧 because they <span>consumed</span> their <span>eggs</span>,<br/>
🎧 and since each <span>dodo</span> only <span>laid</span> one at a time,<br/>
🎧 this probably had a <span>devastating</span> <span>effect</span> on <span>populations</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>,<br/>
🎧 we now think that probably the <span>main</span> <span>cause</span> of the <span>birds'</span> <span>extinction<br/></span>
🎧 was not the <span>introduction</span> of <span>non-native</span> <span>species</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>introduction</span> of <span>agriculture</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>meant</span> that the <span>forest</span> that had once <span>covered</span> all the <span>island</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that had <span>provided</span> a perfect home for the <span>dodo</span>,<br/>
🎧 was cut down so that <span>crops</span> such as <span>sugar</span> could be <span>grown</span>.<br/>
🎧 So although the <span>dodo</span> had <span>survived</span> for <span>thousands</span> of years,<br/>
🎧 <span>suddenly</span> it was <span>gone</span>.<br/>
