🎧 Good morning, how can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 I understand you help fix up students with host families.<br/>
🎧 That's right...<br/>
🎧 are you interested in...?<br/>
🎧 Well please sit down and I'll just take a few details.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Right, now... what name is it?<br/>
🎧 Jenny Chan.<br/>
🎧 Can you spell that please?<br/>
🎧 Yes...<br/>
🎧 JENNY<br/>
🎧 CHAN.<br/>
🎧 Right... and what is your present address?<br/>
🎧 Sea View Guest House, 14 Hill Road.<br/>
🎧 Okay, and do you know the phone number there?<br/>
🎧 Yes... I have it here...<br/>
🎧 2237676<br/>
🎧 but I'm only there after about 7 pm.<br/>
🎧 So when would be the best time to catch you?<br/>
🎧 I suppose between 9 and, let me see, half-past, before I leave for the college.<br/>
🎧 Great... and can I ask you your age?<br/>
🎧 I've just had my nineteenth birthday.<br/>
🎧 And how long would you want to stay with the host family?<br/>
🎧 I'm planning on staying a year<br/>
🎧 but at the moment I'm definitely here for four months only.<br/>
🎧 I have to get an extension to my permit.<br/>
🎧 You're working on it?<br/>
🎧 Fine...<br/>
🎧 and what will be your occupation while you're in the UK?<br/>
🎧 Studying English?<br/>
🎧 And what would you say your level of English is?<br/>
🎧 Good, I think.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to say 'advanced' but my written work is below the level of my spoken,<br/>
🎧 so I suppose it's intermediate.<br/>
🎧 Certainly your spoken English is advanced.<br/>
🎧 Anyway, which area do you think you would prefer?<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm studying right in the centre<br/>
🎧 but I'd really like to live in the north-west.<br/>
🎧 That shouldn't be a great problem...<br/>
🎧 we usually have lots of families up there...<br/>
🎧 And do you have any particular requirements for diet?<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm nearly a vegetarian... not quite.<br/>
🎧 Shall I say you are? It's probably easier that way.<br/>
🎧 That would be best.<br/>
🎧 Anything about your actual room?<br/>
🎧 I would prefer my own facilities - 'en suite', is that right?<br/>
🎧 And also if it's possible, a TV<br/>
🎧 and I'd also like the house to have a real garden rather than just a yard,<br/>
🎧 somewhere I could sit and be peaceful.<br/>
🎧 Is that all?<br/>
🎧 Well... I'm really serious about improving my English<br/>
🎧 so I'd prefer to be the only guest if that's possible?<br/>
🎧 No other guests...<br/>
🎧 Yes, you get more practice that way.<br/>
🎧 Anyway, obviously all this is partly dependent on how much you're willing to pay.<br/>
🎧 What did you have in mind?<br/>
🎧 I was thinking in terms of about £60 to £80 a week,<br/>
🎧 but I'd go up to a hundred if it was something special.<br/>
🎧 Well, I don't think we'd have any problems finding something for you.<br/>
🎧 Oh, good.<br/>
🎧 And when would you want it for?<br/>
🎧 I'd like to move in approximately two weeks.<br/>
🎧 Let me see, it's the 10th today...<br/>
🎧 so if we go for the Monday it's the 23rd of March.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Right...<br/>
🎧 good, and if I could ask one last question...<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Good evening everyone<br/>
🎧 and thank you for coming to the Soccer Club meeting.<br/>
🎧 It's good to see so many parents and children here tonight,<br/>
🎧 and I know you're looking forward to a great football season.<br/>
🎧 Now I'd like to take a few minutes to tell you about some changes to the Soccer Club for the coming season.<br/>
🎧 Now, this season we'll be playing all our matches for both the junior and senior competitions at King's Park,<br/>
🎧 instead of Royal Park, which was used last season.<br/>
🎧 Now, for meetings, we're going to use the clubhouse in King's Park,<br/>
🎧 and the next meeting will be held in the clubhouse on the 2nd of July.<br/>
🎧 As usual, we hope to begin the season with a picnic next Saturday at the clubhouse.<br/>
🎧 Please try and come to the picnic as it's always good fun.<br/>
🎧 In the last week of the season, we usually have a dinner and presentation of prizes to the players,<br/>
🎧 and more information about this will be given to you later in the season.<br/>
🎧 This season we have more teams than ever.<br/>
🎧 We hope to have ten teams, instead of five, in the junior competition<br/>
🎧 and they will play on Saturday mornings, beginning at 8.30 a.m.<br/>
🎧 Training sessions will be held in King's Park on Wednesday afternoons for the juniors<br/>
🎧 and they will be wearing red shirts again this year.<br/>
🎧 In the senior competition, there'll be four teams, same as last year,<br/>
🎧 and their games will be played on Saturday afternoons starting at 2.30,<br/>
🎧 oh, no sorry, it will be a 2 o'clock start,<br/>
🎧 and the training session for seniors is planned for Sunday afternoons.<br/>
🎧 Now I'd like to introduce you to the new committee for the Soccer Club for this season.<br/>
🎧 Firstly, let me welcome Robert Young, the new President,<br/>
🎧 who will manage the meetings for the next two years.<br/>
🎧 Robert's son has been playing football with the club for over five years now,<br/>
🎧 and many thanks to Robert for taking on the job of President.<br/>
🎧 Next we have Gina Costello, she's the treasurer,<br/>
🎧 and she'll collect the fees from you for the season.<br/>
🎧 Please try and give Gina your fees as early as possible in the season,<br/>
🎧 as the club needs the money to buy some new equipment.<br/>
🎧 Then there's David West who has volunteered to be the club secretary,<br/>
🎧 and one of the many jobs he'll have is to send out newsletters to you regularly.<br/>
🎧 If you have any information that may be useful,<br/>
🎧 please let David know so that it can be included in these newsletters.<br/>
🎧 Also, I'd like to introduce you to Jason Dokic who is the Head Coach.<br/>
🎧 For all the new members here tonight, this is the third year that Jason has been with us as Head Coach,<br/>
🎧 and we're very lucky to have such an experienced coach and former player at our club.<br/>
🎧 He will continue to supervise the teams, at training sessions and on match days.<br/>
🎧 Now, before we finish and have some refreshments,<br/>
🎧 does anyone have any questions they'd like to ask the new committee?<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Right, Jason and Karin,<br/>
🎧 now I asked you to look at the case study for Box Telecom as part of your exam assessment.<br/>
🎧 It's interesting because they are in the middle of problems at the moment<br/>
🎧 and I want you to track how they deal with them.<br/>
🎧 Let's start with you, Karin.<br/>
🎧 Having read through the case study,<br/>
🎧 can you just summarise what the problems were that Box Telecom had to take on board?<br/>
🎧 Um, yeah...<br/>
🎧 Well of course what first came to their attention was that, despite a new advertising campaign,<br/>
🎧 they were suffering from falling sales -<br/>
🎧 and this is something that had many causes.<br/>
🎧 On top of that immediate problem,<br/>
🎧 what had also happened over the last two years was that,<br/>
🎧 although they had invested in an expansion plan,<br/>
🎧 they had to face up to increased competition.<br/>
🎧 And, before they had a chance to get to grips with the effects of that,<br/>
🎧 they were stalled by a strike<br/>
🎧 and it was just when they were thinking about making a colossal investment in new machinery for their plants.<br/>
🎧 So they were really in trouble.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I think that's fair.<br/>
🎧 And Jason, you contacted the company, didn't you?<br/>
🎧 What did the company define as the reasons for these problems?<br/>
🎧 Well, I think they've hit on the right things -<br/>
🎧 it would be easy to say they had invested too heavily, or at the wrong time,<br/>
🎧 but in fact, the signs were good<br/>
🎧 and what they were set back by was high interest rates.<br/>
🎧 At the same time, their longer-term problems, which were affecting their market share,<br/>
🎧 were eventually credited to poor training -<br/>
🎧 and having looked at the details in their last report I think that's right.<br/>
🎧 So, onto the larger issues then.<br/>
🎧 Karin, what do you think the company will do?<br/>
🎧 Obviously they have the choice of accepting the very favourable terms that another company - KMG Plc - have given them to buy them out.<br/>
🎧 That would mean creating a new company with a new image.<br/>
🎧 Or they could decide on a bolder move and offer some new shares if they wanted.<br/>
🎧 But I think they're much more cautious than that<br/>
🎧 and expect they will start trying to find individuals who'd be prepared to back them with some of the capital they need.<br/>
🎧 Well, you mustn't always assume that dramatic problems require dramatic solutions.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes there's a simple fix such as changing the guy at the top.<br/>
🎧 If they truly are cautious,<br/>
🎧 then I suspect they will seek to shut down some of their shops.<br/>
🎧 But a more ambitious approach,<br/>
🎧 and one which I think would have more chance of success,<br/>
🎧 would be to alter how they're running things -<br/>
🎧 the management layers and the processes.<br/>
🎧 So, in your analysis, try to think of all the options.<br/>
🎧 Jason?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's interesting because I've found it a really useful company to study.<br/>
🎧 Its problems cross all types of industries<br/>
🎧 and it's lucky it's so big -<br/>
🎧 a smaller or even medium-sized company would have gone under by now.<br/>
🎧 Ah well in fact, what I want you two to do<br/>
🎧 is to go away when we've finished our discussion today and write a report.<br/>
🎧 We've looked in general at the telecommunications market in the UK over the last few sessions<br/>
🎧 and I want you to take Box Telecom as an example<br/>
🎧 and suggest some ways in which they might overcome their problems.<br/>
🎧 And outline the reasons why you think as you do -<br/>
🎧 but try and keep it intrinsic to the company<br/>
🎧 rather than dragging in other examples.<br/>
🎧 Is that okay, Karin?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I think I can do that.<br/>
🎧 Personally I've got great hopes for it.<br/>
🎧 I think it will recover.<br/>
🎧 That advertising campaign they did was very strong<br/>
🎧 and they're very innovative with their products - they set new trends.<br/>
🎧 The company's got to recover, don't you think, Jason?<br/>
🎧 Hmm... I'm not sure.<br/>
🎧 I think it can but it's not a foregone conclusion<br/>
🎧 unless they manage to attract the right level of investment.<br/>
🎧 The company definitely needs a boost<br/>
🎧 and to attract more highly skilled workers if their recovery is to be long-lasting.<br/>
🎧 When I was talking to the marketing manager<br/>
🎧 he said to me that he thinks the company had got a great management team<br/>
🎧 but he would say that, wouldn't he?<br/>
🎧 but they are suffering from having to work with outdated production machinery<br/>
🎧 and that could cost a lot to put right.<br/>
🎧 Well, personally I think the stock market is to blame.<br/>
🎧 I think they were expecting too much of the company<br/>
🎧 and then inevitably it looked bad when it didn't perform.<br/>
🎧 The market should have had more realistic expectations.<br/>
🎧 And I disagree with you about the advertising campaign, Karin.<br/>
🎧 That's where they could do with some innovation - to get sales kick-started.<br/>
🎧 Anyway, let's see what you come up with...<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Okay, are you all settled?<br/>
🎧 Well, first of all, welcome to Cardiff University.<br/>
🎧 I'm here to explain what we can offer you.<br/>
🎧 Now, as a new student at the university,<br/>
🎧 you will probably need some sort of guidance to help you to use the library effectively<br/>
🎧 to study and research.<br/>
🎧 Some of you have asked about a guided tour<br/>
🎧 but we find this rather muddles people.<br/>
🎧 So, in this first week,<br/>
🎧 we run a series of talks which focus on different aspects of the library and its resources.<br/>
🎧 You'll also find that to get the most out of the library,<br/>
🎧 you really do need to be computer literate<br/>
🎧 and so, all this term we run small classes<br/>
🎧 which will bring you up to speed on how to access the computer-loaded information.<br/>
🎧 Okay, now let me give you an outline of what's available to you.<br/>
🎧 You'll find that the computers are increasingly used as a research tool.<br/>
🎧 Many students do most of their research on the internet<br/>
🎧 and the library computers are permanently online.<br/>
🎧 Having found what you need, you'll find you can readily save texts on your personal computer space to print off when you need.<br/>
🎧 You might think that it is the fastest way to get information but the links can be slow.<br/>
🎧 Clearly, you can find lots on there but much of it is useless information<br/>
🎧 as it is from highly debatable sources - so be critical.<br/>
🎧 You'll also find that the library has loaded several CD-ROMS onto the computers from specialist reference sources<br/>
🎧 such as the MLA.<br/>
🎧 It means we can expand what we offer you at very little extra cost<br/>
🎧 and saves us having to invest in more and more books.<br/>
🎧 The CD-ROMS contain exactly the same information as the reference books<br/>
🎧 as the two are updated together.<br/>
🎧 Now most of you will need to refer to journal articles in your work<br/>
🎧 and you'll find you can also access these online<br/>
🎧 and we encourage you to do so.<br/>
🎧 Clearly some of you will find the printed version more accessible as it sits on the shelves<br/>
🎧 but I'm afraid the intention is to phase these out eventually.<br/>
🎧 However, you will still be able to print off a version of the text rather than photocopying the journal pages.<br/>
🎧 So you must get used to working online.<br/>
🎧 Naturally we do still have the full range of classic reference books,<br/>
🎧 additional to the CD-ROMS, for you to use<br/>
🎧 and there are several copies of each one.<br/>
🎧 This is because some of you may prefer to borrow a book rather than sit in the library.<br/>
🎧 There is a restricted loan time on these<br/>
🎧 so that they are not missing from the shelves for too long.<br/>
🎧 Although there is a Section Manager for each part of the library,<br/>
🎧 they are very busy<br/>
🎧 and so, if you do get stuck looking for things,<br/>
🎧 you should ask the relevant Cataloguing Assistant.<br/>
🎧 As your Training Supervisor, I just oversee your induction<br/>
🎧 and will not be around after this initial week.<br/>
🎧 Some of you may be interested to know that the library is offering specialised training sessions on writing a dissertation.<br/>
🎧 Obviously, this is not relevant to those of you who are undergraduates;<br/>
🎧 it is just for postgraduates.<br/>
🎧 Your department will discuss the planning stage of the dissertation -<br/>
🎧 i.e. what you're going to do with you<br/>
🎧 and we will focus on the structure of it.<br/>
🎧 However, the training will also include some time on the computers.<br/>
🎧 I realise most of you know how to organise files<br/>
🎧 but we can show you the different ways to run data programmes.<br/>
🎧 Your tutors will tell you at the outset how to set out the chapters they require<br/>
🎧 but you will need to ask them how they would like you to organise the bibliography<br/>
🎧 because it varies depending on your subject area.<br/>
🎧 When you've got something together, the trainer here will look through the draft version for you to see if it's okay.<br/>
🎧 And, one final point,<br/>
🎧 for those of you who have registered from abroad,<br/>
🎧 we can offer individual sessions on dissertations if you feel you need them.<br/>
🎧 If you require language lessons then they are available from the International Centre next to the Law Department.<br/>
<br/><br/>
