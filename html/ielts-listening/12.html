🎧 Good morning, how can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 I <span>understand</span> you help fix up students with <span>host</span> <span>families</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>right..</span>.<br/>
🎧 are you interested <span>in...</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well please sit down and I'll just take a few <span>details</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Right, <span>now..</span>. what name is it?<br/>
🎧 <span>Jenny</span> <span>Chan</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can you <span>spell</span> that please?<br/>
🎧 <span>Yes..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>JENNY<br/></span>
🎧 <span>CHAN</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Right..</span>. and what is your <span>present</span> <span>address</span>?<br/>
🎧 Sea <span>View</span> <span>Guest</span> House, <span>14</span> <span>Hill</span> <span>Road</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, and do you know the phone number there?<br/>
🎧 <span>Yes..</span>. I have it <span>here..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>2237676<br/></span>
🎧 but I'm only there after about <span>7</span> pm.<br/>
🎧 So when would be the best time to catch you?<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> between <span>9</span> and, let me see, <span>half-past</span>, before I leave for the <span>college</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Great..</span>. and can I ask you your age?<br/>
🎧 I've just had my <span>nineteenth</span> <span>birthday</span>.<br/>
🎧 And how long would you want to <span>stay</span> with the <span>host</span> <span>family</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm planning on <span>staying</span> a <span>year<br/></span>
🎧 but at the <span>moment</span> I'm definitely here for <span>four</span> <span>months</span> only.<br/>
🎧 I have to get an <span>extension</span> to my <span>permit</span>.<br/>
🎧 You're working on it?<br/>
🎧 <span>Fine..</span>.<br/>
🎧 and what will be your <span>occupation</span> while you're in the <span>UK</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Studying</span> English?<br/>
🎧 And what would you say your <span>level</span> of English is?<br/>
🎧 Good, I think.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to say <span>'advanced'</span> but my <span>written</span> work is <span>below</span> the <span>level</span> of my <span>spoken</span>,<br/>
🎧 so I <span>suppose</span> it's <span>intermediate</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Certainly</span> your <span>spoken</span> English is <span>advanced</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, which <span>area</span> do you think you would <span>prefer</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm <span>studying</span> right in the <span>centre<br/></span>
🎧 but I'd really like to live in the <span>north-west</span>.<br/>
🎧 That shouldn't be a great <span>problem..</span>.<br/>
🎧 we usually have lots of <span>families</span> up <span>there..</span>.<br/>
🎧 And do you have any <span>particular</span> <span>requirements</span> for <span>diet</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm <span>nearly</span> a <span>vegetarian..</span>. not quite.<br/>
🎧 Shall I say you are? It's probably <span>easier</span> that way.<br/>
🎧 That would be best.<br/>
🎧 Anything about your <span>actual</span> room?<br/>
🎧 I would <span>prefer</span> my own <span>facilities</span> <span>-</span> <span>'en</span> <span>suite'</span>, is that right?<br/>
🎧 And also if it's <span>possible</span>, a <span>TV<br/></span>
🎧 and I'd also like the house to have a <span>real</span> garden rather than just a <span>yard</span>,<br/>
🎧 somewhere I could sit and be <span>peaceful</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is that all?<br/>
🎧 <span>Well..</span>. I'm really serious about <span>improving</span> my <span>English<br/></span>
🎧 so I'd <span>prefer</span> to be the only <span>guest</span> if that's <span>possible</span>?<br/>
🎧 No other <span>guests..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, you get more practice that way.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, <span>obviously</span> all this is <span>partly</span> <span>dependent</span> on how much you're <span>willing</span> to pay.<br/>
🎧 What did you have in <span>mind</span>?<br/>
🎧 I was thinking in <span>terms</span> of about <span>£60</span> to <span>£80</span> a week,<br/>
🎧 but I'd go up to a <span>hundred</span> if it was something special.<br/>
🎧 Well, I don't think we'd have any <span>problems</span> <span>finding</span> something for you.<br/>
🎧 Oh, good.<br/>
🎧 And when would you want it for?<br/>
🎧 I'd like to move in <span>approximately</span> two <span>weeks</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let me see, it's the <span>10th</span> <span>today..</span>.<br/>
🎧 so if we go for the <span>Monday</span> it's the <span>23rd</span> of <span>March</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 <span>Right..</span>.<br/>
🎧 good, and if I could ask one last <span>question..</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Good <span>evening</span> <span>everyone<br/></span>
🎧 and thank you for <span>coming</span> to the <span>Soccer</span> <span>Club</span> <span>meeting</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's good to see so many <span>parents</span> and children here <span>tonight</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I know you're looking forward to a great <span>football</span> <span>season</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now I'd like to take a few <span>minutes</span> to tell you about some changes to the <span>Soccer</span> <span>Club</span> for the <span>coming</span> <span>season</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, this <span>season</span> we'll be playing all our <span>matches</span> for both the <span>junior</span> and <span>senior</span> <span>competitions</span> at <span>King's</span> <span>Park</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>instead</span> of <span>Royal</span> <span>Park</span>, which was used last <span>season</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, for <span>meetings</span>, we're going to use the <span>clubhouse</span> in <span>King's</span> <span>Park</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the next <span>meeting</span> will be <span>held</span> in the <span>clubhouse</span> on the <span>2nd</span> of <span>July</span>.<br/>
🎧 As <span>usual</span>, we hope to <span>begin</span> the <span>season</span> with a <span>picnic</span> next <span>Saturday</span> at the <span>clubhouse</span>.<br/>
🎧 Please try and come to the <span>picnic</span> as it's always good fun.<br/>
🎧 In the last week of the <span>season</span>, we usually have a dinner and <span>presentation</span> of <span>prizes</span> to the <span>players</span>,<br/>
🎧 and more <span>information</span> about this will be <span>given</span> to you later in the <span>season</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>season</span> we have more <span>teams</span> than ever.<br/>
🎧 We hope to have ten <span>teams</span>, <span>instead</span> of <span>five</span>, in the <span>junior</span> <span>competition<br/></span>
🎧 and they will play on <span>Saturday</span> <span>mornings</span>, <span>beginning</span> at <span>8.30</span> <span>a.m</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Training</span> <span>sessions</span> will be <span>held</span> in <span>King's</span> <span>Park</span> on <span>Wednesday</span> <span>afternoons</span> for the <span>juniors<br/></span>
🎧 and they will be <span>wearing</span> red <span>shirts</span> again this year.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>senior</span> <span>competition</span>, <span>there'll</span> be <span>four</span> <span>teams</span>, same as last year,<br/>
🎧 and their <span>games</span> will be <span>played</span> on <span>Saturday</span> <span>afternoons</span> <span>starting</span> at <span>2.30</span>,<br/>
🎧 oh, no sorry, it will be a <span>2</span> <span>o'clock</span> start,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>training</span> <span>session</span> for <span>seniors</span> is <span>planned</span> for <span>Sunday</span> <span>afternoons</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now I'd like to <span>introduce</span> you to the new <span>committee</span> for the <span>Soccer</span> <span>Club</span> for this <span>season</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Firstly</span>, let me <span>welcome</span> <span>Robert</span> Young, the new <span>President</span>,<br/>
🎧 who will <span>manage</span> the <span>meetings</span> for the next two years.<br/>
🎧 <span>Robert's</span> son has been playing <span>football</span> with the <span>club</span> for over <span>five</span> years now,<br/>
🎧 and many thanks to <span>Robert</span> for taking on the <span>job</span> of <span>President</span>.<br/>
🎧 Next we have <span>Gina</span> <span>Costello</span>, she's the <span>treasurer</span>,<br/>
🎧 and she'll <span>collect</span> the <span>fees</span> from you for the <span>season</span>.<br/>
🎧 Please try and give <span>Gina</span> your <span>fees</span> as <span>early</span> as <span>possible</span> in the <span>season</span>,<br/>
🎧 as the <span>club</span> needs the money to buy some new <span>equipment</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then there's <span>David</span> <span>West</span> who has <span>volunteered</span> to be the <span>club</span> <span>secretary</span>,<br/>
🎧 and one of the many <span>jobs</span> he'll have is to <span>send</span> out <span>newsletters</span> to you <span>regularly</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you have any <span>information</span> that may be useful,<br/>
🎧 please let <span>David</span> know so that it can be <span>included</span> in these <span>newsletters</span>.<br/>
🎧 Also, I'd like to <span>introduce</span> you to <span>Jason</span> <span>Dokic</span> who is the <span>Head</span> <span>Coach</span>.<br/>
🎧 For all the new <span>members</span> here <span>tonight</span>, this is the <span>third</span> year that <span>Jason</span> has been with us as <span>Head</span> <span>Coach</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we're very <span>lucky</span> to have such an <span>experienced</span> <span>coach</span> and <span>former</span> <span>player</span> at our <span>club</span>.<br/>
🎧 He will <span>continue</span> to <span>supervise</span> the <span>teams</span>, at <span>training</span> <span>sessions</span> and on <span>match</span> <span>days</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, before we <span>finish</span> and have some <span>refreshments</span>,<br/>
🎧 does <span>anyone</span> have any <span>questions</span> they'd like to ask the new <span>committee</span>?<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Right, <span>Jason</span> and <span>Karin</span>,<br/>
🎧 now I <span>asked</span> you to look at the case <span>study</span> for Box <span>Telecom</span> as <span>part</span> of your <span>exam</span> <span>assessment</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>interesting</span> because they are in the <span>middle</span> of <span>problems</span> at the <span>moment<br/></span>
🎧 and I want you to <span>track</span> how they <span>deal</span> with them.<br/>
🎧 Let's start with you, <span>Karin</span>.<br/>
🎧 Having read through the case <span>study</span>,<br/>
🎧 can you just <span>summarise</span> what the <span>problems</span> were that Box <span>Telecom</span> had to take on <span>board</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Um</span>, <span>yeah..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well of course what first came to their <span>attention</span> was that, <span>despite</span> a new <span>advertising</span> <span>campaign</span>,<br/>
🎧 they were <span>suffering</span> from <span>falling</span> <span>sales</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and this is something that had many <span>causes</span>.<br/>
🎧 On top of that <span>immediate</span> <span>problem</span>,<br/>
🎧 what had also <span>happened</span> over the last two years was that,<br/>
🎧 although they had <span>invested</span> in an <span>expansion</span> plan,<br/>
🎧 they had to <span>face</span> up to <span>increased</span> <span>competition</span>.<br/>
🎧 And, before they had a <span>chance</span> to get to <span>grips</span> with the <span>effects</span> of that,<br/>
🎧 they were <span>stalled</span> by a <span>strike<br/></span>
🎧 and it was just when they were thinking about <span>making</span> a <span>colossal</span> <span>investment</span> in new <span>machinery</span> for their <span>plants</span>.<br/>
🎧 So they were really in <span>trouble</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I think that's <span>fair</span>.<br/>
🎧 And <span>Jason</span>, you <span>contacted</span> the company, didn't you?<br/>
🎧 What did the company <span>define</span> as the <span>reasons</span> for these <span>problems</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I think <span>they've</span> hit on the right things <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it would be easy to say they had <span>invested</span> too <span>heavily</span>, or at the wrong time,<br/>
🎧 but in <span>fact</span>, the <span>signs</span> were <span>good<br/></span>
🎧 and what they were set back by was high <span>interest</span> <span>rates</span>.<br/>
🎧 At the same time, their <span>longer-term</span> <span>problems</span>, which were <span>affecting</span> their <span>market</span> share,<br/>
🎧 were <span>eventually</span> <span>credited</span> to <span>poor</span> <span>training</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and having <span>looked</span> at the <span>details</span> in their last <span>report</span> I think that's right.<br/>
🎧 So, <span>onto</span> the <span>larger</span> issues then.<br/>
🎧 <span>Karin</span>, what do you think the company will do?<br/>
🎧 <span>Obviously</span> they have the <span>choice</span> of <span>accepting</span> the very <span>favourable</span> <span>terms</span> that another company <span>-</span> <span>KMG</span> <span>Plc</span> <span>-</span> have <span>given</span> them to buy them out.<br/>
🎧 That would mean <span>creating</span> a new company with a new <span>image</span>.<br/>
🎧 Or they could decide on a <span>bolder</span> move and <span>offer</span> some new <span>shares</span> if they wanted.<br/>
🎧 But I think they're much more <span>cautious</span> than <span>that<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>expect</span> they will start trying to find <span>individuals</span> who'd be <span>prepared</span> to back them with some of the <span>capital</span> they need.<br/>
🎧 Well, you mustn't always <span>assume</span> that <span>dramatic</span> <span>problems</span> <span>require</span> <span>dramatic</span> <span>solutions</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes there's a simple fix such as <span>changing</span> the guy at the top.<br/>
🎧 If they <span>truly</span> are <span>cautious</span>,<br/>
🎧 then I <span>suspect</span> they will <span>seek</span> to <span>shut</span> down some of their <span>shops</span>.<br/>
🎧 But a more <span>ambitious</span> <span>approach</span>,<br/>
🎧 and one which I think would have more <span>chance</span> of success,<br/>
🎧 would be to <span>alter</span> how they're <span>running</span> things <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>management</span> <span>layers</span> and the <span>processes</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, in your <span>analysis</span>, try to think of all the options.<br/>
🎧 <span>Jason</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's <span>interesting</span> because I've <span>found</span> it a really useful company to <span>study</span>.<br/>
🎧 Its <span>problems</span> <span>cross</span> all <span>types</span> of <span>industries<br/></span>
🎧 and it's <span>lucky</span> it's so big <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 a <span>smaller</span> or even <span>medium-sized</span> company would have <span>gone</span> under by now.<br/>
🎧 Ah well in <span>fact</span>, what I want you two to <span>do<br/></span>
🎧 is to go away when we've <span>finished</span> our <span>discussion</span> today and <span>write</span> a <span>report</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've <span>looked</span> in <span>general</span> at the <span>telecommunications</span> <span>market</span> in the <span>UK</span> over the last few <span>sessions<br/></span>
🎧 and I want you to take Box <span>Telecom</span> as an <span>example<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>suggest</span> some <span>ways</span> in which they might <span>overcome</span> their <span>problems</span>.<br/>
🎧 And <span>outline</span> the <span>reasons</span> why you think as you do <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 but try and keep it <span>intrinsic</span> to the <span>company<br/></span>
🎧 rather than <span>dragging</span> in other <span>examples</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is that okay, <span>Karin</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I think I can do that.<br/>
🎧 <span>Personally</span> I've got great <span>hopes</span> for it.<br/>
🎧 I think it will <span>recover</span>.<br/>
🎧 That <span>advertising</span> <span>campaign</span> they did was very <span>strong<br/></span>
🎧 and they're very <span>innovative</span> with their <span>products</span> <span>-</span> they set new <span>trends</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>company's</span> got to <span>recover</span>, don't you think, <span>Jason</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm..</span>. I'm not sure.<br/>
🎧 I think it can but it's not a <span>foregone</span> <span>conclusion<br/></span>
🎧 <span>unless</span> they <span>manage</span> to <span>attract</span> the right <span>level</span> of <span>investment</span>.<br/>
🎧 The company definitely needs a <span>boost<br/></span>
🎧 and to <span>attract</span> more <span>highly</span> <span>skilled</span> <span>workers</span> if their <span>recovery</span> is to be <span>long-lasting</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I was talking to the <span>marketing</span> <span>manager<br/></span>
🎧 he said to me that he <span>thinks</span> the company had got a great <span>management</span> <span>team<br/></span>
🎧 but he would say that, wouldn't he?<br/>
🎧 but they are <span>suffering</span> from having to work with <span>outdated</span> <span>production</span> <span>machinery<br/></span>
🎧 and that could <span>cost</span> a lot to put right.<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>personally</span> I think the <span>stock</span> <span>market</span> is to <span>blame</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think they were <span>expecting</span> too much of the <span>company<br/></span>
🎧 and then <span>inevitably</span> it <span>looked</span> bad when it didn't <span>perform</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>market</span> should have had more <span>realistic</span> <span>expectations</span>.<br/>
🎧 And I <span>disagree</span> with you about the <span>advertising</span> <span>campaign</span>, <span>Karin</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's where they could do with some <span>innovation</span> <span>-</span> to get <span>sales</span> <span>kick-started</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, let's see what you come up <span>with..</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Okay, are you all <span>settled</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, first of all, <span>welcome</span> to <span>Cardiff</span> University.<br/>
🎧 I'm here to <span>explain</span> what we can <span>offer</span> you.<br/>
🎧 Now, as a new student at the university,<br/>
🎧 you will probably need some <span>sort</span> of <span>guidance</span> to help you to use the <span>library</span> <span>effectively<br/></span>
🎧 to <span>study</span> and <span>research</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some of you have <span>asked</span> about a <span>guided</span> <span>tour<br/></span>
🎧 but we find this rather <span>muddles</span> people.<br/>
🎧 So, in this first week,<br/>
🎧 we run a <span>series</span> of <span>talks</span> which focus on different <span>aspects</span> of the <span>library</span> and its <span>resources</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll also find that to get the most out of the <span>library</span>,<br/>
🎧 you really do need to be <span>computer</span> <span>literate<br/></span>
🎧 and so, all this <span>term</span> we run small <span>classes<br/></span>
🎧 which will <span>bring</span> you up to <span>speed</span> on how to <span>access</span> the <span>computer-loaded</span> <span>information</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, now let me give you an <span>outline</span> of what's <span>available</span> to you.<br/>
🎧 You'll find that the <span>computers</span> are <span>increasingly</span> used as a <span>research</span> <span>tool</span>.<br/>
🎧 Many students do most of their <span>research</span> on the <span>internet<br/></span>
🎧 and the <span>library</span> <span>computers</span> are <span>permanently</span> online.<br/>
🎧 Having <span>found</span> what you need, you'll find you can <span>readily</span> <span>save</span> <span>texts</span> on your personal <span>computer</span> <span>space</span> to <span>print</span> off when you need.<br/>
🎧 You might think that it is the <span>fastest</span> way to get <span>information</span> but the <span>links</span> can be <span>slow</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Clearly</span>, you can find lots on there but much of it is <span>useless</span> <span>information<br/></span>
🎧 as it is from <span>highly</span> <span>debatable</span> <span>sources</span> <span>-</span> so be <span>critical</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll also find that the <span>library</span> has <span>loaded</span> <span>several</span> <span>CD-ROMS</span> <span>onto</span> the <span>computers</span> from <span>specialist</span> <span>reference</span> <span>sources<br/></span>
🎧 such as the <span>MLA</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>means</span> we can <span>expand</span> what we <span>offer</span> you at very little <span>extra</span> <span>cost<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>saves</span> us having to <span>invest</span> in more and more books.<br/>
🎧 The <span>CD-ROMS</span> <span>contain</span> exactly the same <span>information</span> as the <span>reference</span> <span>books<br/></span>
🎧 as the two are <span>updated</span> together.<br/>
🎧 Now most of you will need to <span>refer</span> to <span>journal</span> <span>articles</span> in your <span>work<br/></span>
🎧 and you'll find you can also <span>access</span> these <span>online<br/></span>
🎧 and we <span>encourage</span> you to do so.<br/>
🎧 <span>Clearly</span> some of you will find the <span>printed</span> <span>version</span> more <span>accessible</span> as it <span>sits</span> on the <span>shelves<br/></span>
🎧 but I'm <span>afraid</span> the <span>intention</span> is to <span>phase</span> these out <span>eventually</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, you will still be able to <span>print</span> off a <span>version</span> of the <span>text</span> rather than <span>photocopying</span> the <span>journal</span> <span>pages</span>.<br/>
🎧 So you must get used to working online.<br/>
🎧 <span>Naturally</span> we do still have the full <span>range</span> of <span>classic</span> <span>reference</span> books,<br/>
🎧 <span>additional</span> to the <span>CD-ROMS</span>, for you to <span>use<br/></span>
🎧 and there are <span>several</span> <span>copies</span> of each one.<br/>
🎧 This is because some of you may <span>prefer</span> to <span>borrow</span> a book rather than sit in the <span>library</span>.<br/>
🎧 There is a <span>restricted</span> <span>loan</span> time on <span>these<br/></span>
🎧 so that they are not <span>missing</span> from the <span>shelves</span> for too long.<br/>
🎧 Although there is a <span>Section</span> <span>Manager</span> for each <span>part</span> of the <span>library</span>,<br/>
🎧 they are very <span>busy<br/></span>
🎧 and so, if you do get <span>stuck</span> looking for things,<br/>
🎧 you should ask the <span>relevant</span> <span>Cataloguing</span> <span>Assistant</span>.<br/>
🎧 As your <span>Training</span> <span>Supervisor</span>, I just <span>oversee</span> your <span>induction<br/></span>
🎧 and will not be around after this <span>initial</span> week.<br/>
🎧 Some of you may be interested to know that the <span>library</span> is <span>offering</span> <span>specialised</span> <span>training</span> <span>sessions</span> on <span>writing</span> a <span>dissertation</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Obviously</span>, this is not <span>relevant</span> to those of you who are <span>undergraduates;<br/></span>
🎧 it is just for <span>postgraduates</span>.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>department</span> will <span>discuss</span> the planning <span>stage</span> of the <span>dissertation</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>i.e</span>. what you're going to do with <span>you<br/></span>
🎧 and we will focus on the <span>structure</span> of it.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, the <span>training</span> will also <span>include</span> some time on the <span>computers</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>realise</span> most of you know how to <span>organise</span> <span>files<br/></span>
🎧 but we can show you the different <span>ways</span> to run <span>data</span> <span>programmes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>tutors</span> will tell you at the <span>outset</span> how to set out the <span>chapters</span> they <span>require<br/></span>
🎧 but you will need to ask them how they would like you to <span>organise</span> the <span>bibliography<br/></span>
🎧 because it <span>varies</span> <span>depending</span> on your <span>subject</span> <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you've got something together, the <span>trainer</span> here will look through the <span>draft</span> <span>version</span> for you to see if it's okay.<br/>
🎧 And, one <span>final</span> <span>point</span>,<br/>
🎧 for those of you who have <span>registered</span> from <span>abroad</span>,<br/>
🎧 we can <span>offer</span> <span>individual</span> <span>sessions</span> on <span>dissertations</span> if you feel you need them.<br/>
🎧 If you <span>require</span> <span>language</span> <span>lessons</span> then they are <span>available</span> from the <span>International</span> <span>Centre</span> next to the Law <span>Department</span>.<br/>
