🎧 Hello, Flanders conference hotel.<br/>
🎧 Oh, hi. I wanted to ask about conference facilities at the hotel.<br/>
🎧 Have I come through to the right person?<br/>
🎧 Hmm... You have. I'm the customer services manager.<br/>
🎧 My name's Angela.<br/>
🎧 So how can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm calling from Barrett and Stansons,<br/>
🎧 we're a medical company based in Perth.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes.<br/>
🎧 And we're organising a conference for our clients to be held in Sydney.<br/>
🎧 It'll be held over two days and we're expecting about fifty or sixty people.<br/>
🎧 When were you thinking of having it?<br/>
🎧 Some time early next year, like the end of January?<br/>
🎧 It'd have to be a weekend.<br/>
🎧 Ah... let me see…<br/>
🎧 our conference facilities are already booked for the weekend beginning January the 28th.<br/>
🎧 We could do the first weekend in February?<br/>
🎧 How about January the 21st?<br/>
🎧 Oh.. I'm afraid that's booked too.<br/>
🎧 Well, let's go for the February date then.<br/>
🎧 So that's the weekend beginning the 4th.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Now can you tell me a bit about what conference facilities you have?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 So for talks and presentations we have the Tesla room.<br/>
🎧 Sorry?<br/>
🎧 Tesla - that's spelled TESLA.<br/>
🎧 it holds up to a hundred people,<br/>
🎧 and it's fully equipped with a projector and so on.<br/>
🎧 How about a microphone?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that'll be all set up ready for you,<br/>
🎧 and there'll be one that members of the audience can use too, for questions, if necessary.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 And we'll also need some sort of open area where people can sit and have a cup of coffee,<br/>
🎧 and we'd like to have an exhibition of our products and services there as well,<br/>
🎧 so that'll need to be quite a big space.<br/>
🎧 That's fine,<br/>
🎧 there's a central atrium with all those facilities,<br/>
🎧 and you can come before the conference starts if you want to set everything up.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 And I presume there's wifi?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, that's free and available throughout the hotel.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Would you also like us to provide a buffet lunch?<br/>
🎧 We can do a two-course meal with a number of different options.<br/>
🎧 What sort of price are we looking at for that?<br/>
🎧 Well, I can send you a copy of the standard menu.<br/>
🎧 That's $45 per person.<br/>
🎧 Or you can have the special for $25 more.<br/>
🎧 I think the standard should be OK, but yes, send me the menu.<br/>
🎧 Now we're also going to need accommodation on the Saturday night for some of the participants…<br/>
🎧 I'm not sure how many, but probably about 25.<br/>
🎧 So what do you charge for a room?<br/>
🎧 Well, for conference attendees we have a 25% reduction,<br/>
🎧 so we can offer you rooms at $135.<br/>
🎧 Normally a standard room's $180.<br/>
🎧 And does that include breakfast?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 And of course, guests can also make use of all the other facilities at the hotel.<br/>
🎧 So we've got a spa where you can get massages and facials and so on,<br/>
🎧 and there's a pool up on the roof for the use of guests.<br/>
🎧 Ah... great.<br/>
🎧 Now what about transport links?<br/>
🎧 The hotel's downtown, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's about 12 kilometres from the airport,<br/>
🎧 but there's a complimentary shuttle bus for guests.<br/>
🎧 And it's only about ten minutes' walk from the central railway station.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Now, I don't know Sydney very well,<br/>
🎧 can you just give me an idea of the location of the hotel?<br/>
🎧 Ah... well, it's downtown on Wilby Street,<br/>
🎧 ah... that's quite a small street, and it's not very far from the sea.<br/>
🎧 And of course if the conference attendees want to go out on the Saturday evening,<br/>
🎧 there's a huge choice of places to eat.<br/>
🎧 Then if they want to make a night of it,<br/>
🎧 they can go on to one of the clubs in the area -<br/>
🎧 there are a great many to choose from.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So if we go ahead with this,<br/>
🎧 Can you give me some information about how much…<br/>
<br />

🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 My name's Lucy Crittenden,<br/>
🎧 and I'm the Director of Operations for an organisation that arranges volunteering in this part of the country.<br/>
🎧 I'm hoping I can persuade one or two of you to become volunteers yourselves.<br/>
🎧 Let me start by briefly explaining what we mean by volunteering.<br/>
🎧 Volunteers are teenagers and adults who choose to spend some time, unpaid, helping other people in some way.<br/>
🎧 Most volunteers devote two or three hours to this every week, while a few do much more.<br/>
🎧 The people they help may have physical or behavioural difficulties, for example.<br/>
🎧 Volunteers can do all sorts of things, depending on their own abilities and interests.<br/>
🎧 If they're supporting a family that's struggling, for example,<br/>
🎧 they may be able to give them tips on cooking,<br/>
🎧 or recommend how to plan their budget<br/>
🎧 or how to shop sensibly on their income.<br/>
🎧 They might even do some painting or wallpapering,<br/>
🎧 perhaps alongside any members of the family who are able to do it.<br/>
🎧 Or even do some babysitting so that parents can go out for a while.<br/>
🎧 The benefit from volunteering isn't only for the people being helped.<br/>
🎧 Volunteers also gain from it:<br/>
🎧 they're using their skills to cope with somebody's mental or physical ill health,<br/>
🎧 and volunteering may be a valuable element of their CV when they're applying for jobs:<br/>
🎧 employers usually look favourably on someone who's given up time to help others.<br/>
🎧 Significantly, most volunteers feel that what they're doing gives them a purpose in their lives.<br/>
🎧 And in my opinion, they're lucky in that respect,<br/>
🎧 as many people don't have that feeling.<br/>
🎧 Now I'd like to tell you what some of our volunteers have said about what they do,<br/>
🎧 to give you an idea of the range of ways in which they can help people.<br/>
🎧 Habib supports an elderly lady who's beginning to show signs of dementia.<br/>
🎧 Once a week they, along with other elderly people, go to the local community centre,<br/>
🎧 where a group of people come in and sing.<br/>
🎧 The songs take the listeners back to their youth,<br/>
🎧 and for a little while they can forget the difficulties that they face now.<br/>
🎧 Our volunteer Consuela is an amazing woman.<br/>
🎧 She has difficulty walking herself, but she doesn't let that stop her.<br/>
🎧 She helps a couple of people with similar difficulties,<br/>
🎧 who had almost stopped walking altogether.<br/>
🎧 By using herself as an example,<br/>
🎧 Consuela encourages them to walk more and more.<br/>
🎧 Minh visits a young man who lives alone and can't leave his home on his own,<br/>
🎧 so he hardly ever saw anyone.<br/>
🎧 But together they go out to the cinema,<br/>
🎧 or to see friends the young man hadn't been able to visit for a long time.<br/>
🎧 Tanya visits an elderly woman once a week.<br/>
🎧 When the woman found out that Tanya is a professional dressmaker, she got interested.<br/>
🎧 Tanya showed her some soft toys she'd made,<br/>
🎧 and the woman decided to try it herself.<br/>
🎧 And now she really enjoys it, and spends hours making toys.<br/>
🎧 They're not perhaps up to Tanya's standard yet,<br/>
🎧 but she gains a lot of pleasure from doing it.<br/>
🎧 Alexei is a volunteer with a family that faces a number of difficulties.<br/>
🎧 By calmly talking over possible solutions with family members,<br/>
🎧 he's helping them to realise that they aren't helpless,<br/>
🎧 and that they can do something themselves to improve their situation.<br/>
🎧 This has been great for their self-esteem.<br/>
🎧 And the last volunteer I'll mention, though there are plenty more, is Juba.<br/>
🎧 She volunteers with a teenage girl with learning difficulties,<br/>
🎧 who wasn't very good at talking to other people.<br/>
🎧 Juba's worked very patiently with her,<br/>
🎧 and now the girl is far better at expressing herself,<br/>
🎧 and at understanding other people.<br/>
🎧 OK, I hope that's given you an idea of what volunteering is all about.<br/>
🎧 Now I'd like…<br/>
<br />

🎧 So how are you getting on with your teaching practice at the High School, Joe?<br/>
🎧 Well I've been put in charge of the school marching band, and it's quite a responsibility.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to talk it over with you.<br/>
🎧 Go ahead.<br/>
🎧 You'd better start by giving me a bit of background.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Well the band has students in it from all years,<br/>
🎧 so they're aged 11 to 18, and there are about 50 of them altogether.<br/>
🎧 It's quite a popular activity within the school.<br/>
🎧 I've never worked with a band of more than 20 before, and this is very different.<br/>
🎧 I can imagine.<br/>
🎧 They aren't really good enough to enter national band competitions,<br/>
🎧 but they're in a regional one later in the term.<br/>
🎧 Even if they don't win, and I don't expect them to,<br/>
🎧 hopefully it'll be an incentive for them to try and improve.<br/>
🎧 Yes, hopefully.<br/>
🎧 Well, now the town council's organising a carnival in the summer,<br/>
🎧 and the band has been asked to perform.<br/>
🎧 If you ask me, they aren't really up to it yet,<br/>
🎧 and I need to get them functioning better as a band, and in a very short time.<br/>
🎧 Have you been doing anything with them?<br/>
🎧 Apart from practising the music, I mean.<br/>
🎧 I played a recording I came across,<br/>
🎧 of a drummer talking about how playing in a band had changed his life.<br/>
🎧 I think it was an after-dinner speech.<br/>
🎧 I thought it was pretty inspiring,<br/>
🎧 because being in the band had stopped him from getting involved in crime.<br/>
🎧 The students seemed to find it interesting, too.<br/>
🎧 That's good.<br/>
🎧 I'm planning to show them that old film from the 1940s 'Strike Up the Band',<br/>
🎧 and talk about it with the students.<br/>
🎧 What do you think?<br/>
🎧 Good idea.<br/>
🎧 As it's about a school band, it might make the students realise how much they can achieve if they work together.<br/>
🎧 That's what I've got in mind.<br/>
🎧 I'm hoping I can take some of the band to a parade that's going to take place next month.<br/>
🎧 A couple of marching bands will be performing, and the atmosphere should be quite exciting.<br/>
🎧 It depends on whether I can persuade the school to hire a coach or two to take us there.<br/>
🎧 They sound like good ideas to me.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Can I tell you about a few people in the band who I'm finding it quite difficult to cope with?<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you'll have some ideas about what I can do.<br/>
🎧 Go ahead.<br/>
🎧 There's a flautist who says she loves playing in the band.<br/>
🎧 We rehearse twice a week after school, but she's hardly ever there.<br/>
🎧 Then she looks for me the next day and gives me a very plausible reason -<br/>
🎧 she says she had to help her mother, or she's been ill,<br/>
🎧 but to be honest, I don't believe her.<br/>
🎧 Oh dear!<br/>
🎧 Any more students with difficulties?<br/>
🎧 Plenty!<br/>
🎧 There's a trumpeter who thinks she's the best musician in the band, though she certainly isn't.<br/>
🎧 She's always saying what she thinks other people should do, which makes my job pretty difficult.<br/>
🎧 She sounds a bit of a nightmare!<br/>
🎧 You can say that again.<br/>
🎧 Uh... one of the trombonists has got an impressive sense of rhythm,<br/>
🎧 and could be an excellent musician -<br/>
🎧 except that he has breathing difficulties,<br/>
🎧 and he doesn't really have enough breath for the trombone.<br/>
🎧 He'd be much better off playing percussion, for instance, but he refuses to give up.<br/>
🎧 So he ends up only playing half the notes.<br/>
🎧 I suppose you have to admire his determination.<br/>
🎧 Maybe.<br/>
🎧 One of the percussionists isn't too bad,<br/>
🎧 but he never seems to interact with other people,<br/>
🎧 and he always rushes off as soon as the rehearsal ends.<br/>
🎧 I don't know if there are family reasons, or what.<br/>
🎧 But it isn't good in a band, where people really need to feel they're part of a group.<br/>
🎧 There are others too, but at least that gives you an idea of what I'm up against.<br/>
🎧 Do you have any thoughts about what I can do, Lizzie?<br/>
<br />

🎧 As you all know, the university is planning an arts festival for later this year,<br/>
🎧 and here in the music department we've planned three concerts.<br/>
🎧 These will be public performances, and the programme has just been finalised.<br/>
🎧 The theme of the festival is links between the UK and Australia,<br/>
🎧 and this is reflected in the music:<br/>
🎧 each concert will feature both British and Australian composers.<br/>
🎧 I'll tell you briefly about the Australian music,<br/>
🎧 as you probably won't be familiar with that.<br/>
🎧 The first concert will include music by Liza Lim,<br/>
🎧 who was born in Perth, Western Australia, in 1966.<br/>
🎧 As a child, Lim originally learned to play the piano - like so many children -<br/>
🎧 and also the violin.<br/>
🎧 But when she was 11 her teachers encouraged her to start composing.<br/>
🎧 She found this was her real strength,<br/>
🎧 and she studied and later taught composition,<br/>
🎧 both in Australia and in other countries.<br/>
🎧 As a composer, she has received commissions from numerous orchestras,<br/>
🎧 other performers and festivals in several countries.<br/>
🎧 Liza Lim's compositions are vibrant and full of energy,<br/>
🎧 and she often explores Asian and Australian Aboriginal cultural sources,<br/>
🎧 including the native instrument, the didgeridoo:<br/>
🎧 this is featured in a work called The Compass.<br/>
🎧 Her music is very expressive,<br/>
🎧 so although it is complex,<br/>
🎧 it has the power of connecting with audiences and performers alike.<br/>
🎧 In the festival we're going to give a semi-staged performance of The Oresteia.<br/>
🎧 This is an opera in seven parts,<br/>
🎧 based on the trilogy of ancient Greek tragedies by Aeschylus.<br/>
🎧 Lim composed this when she was in her mid-20s,<br/>
🎧 and she also wrote the text, along with Barrie Kosky.<br/>
🎧 It's performed by six singers, a dancer,<br/>
🎧 and an orchestra that, as well as standard orchestral instruments, includes electric guitar,<br/>
🎧 and a traditional Turkish stringed instrument.<br/>
🎧 Lim wrote that because the stories in the tragedies are not easy to tell,<br/>
🎧 the sounds she creates are also disturbing,<br/>
🎧 and they include breathing, sobbing, laughing and whistling.<br/>
🎧 The work lasts around 75 minutes,<br/>
🎧 and the rest of the concert will consist of orchestral works by the British composers<br/>
🎧 Ralph Vaughan Williams and Frederick Delius.<br/>
🎧 Moving on now to our second concert,<br/>
🎧 this will begin with instrumental music by British composers - Benjamin Britten and Judith Weir.<br/>
🎧 After the interval we'll go to Australia for a piece by Ross Edwards:<br/>
🎧 The Tower of Remoteness.<br/>
🎧 According to Edwards, the inspiration for this piece came from nature,<br/>
🎧 when he was sitting alone in the dry bed of a creek,<br/>
🎧 overshadowed by the leaves of palm trees,<br/>
🎧 listening to the birds and insects.<br/>
🎧 The Tower of Remoteness is scored for piano and clarinet.<br/>
🎧 Edwards says he realised years after writing the piece<br/>
🎧 that he had subconsciously modelled its opening phrase on a bird call.<br/>
🎧 Ross Edwards was born in 1943 in Sydney, Australia,<br/>
🎧 and studied at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music<br/>
🎧 and the universities of Adelaide and Sydney.<br/>
🎧 He's well known in Australia,<br/>
🎧 and in fact he's one of the country's most performed composers.<br/>
🎧 He's written a wide range of music,<br/>
🎧 from symphonies and concertos to some composed specifically for children.<br/>
🎧 Edwards's music has been described as being 'deeply connected to Australia',<br/>
🎧 and it can be regarded as a celebration of the diversity of cultures that Australia can be proud of.<br/>
🎧 The last of the three Australian composers to be represented in our festival is Carl Vine.<br/>
🎧 Born in 1954, Vine, like Liza Lim, comes from Perth, Western Australia.<br/>
🎧 He took up the cornet at the age of five, switching to the piano five years later.<br/>
🎧 However, he went to university to study physics, before changing to composition.<br/>
🎧 After graduating he moved to Sydney and worked as a freelance pianist and composer.<br/>
🎧 Before long he had become prominent in Australia as a composer for dance,<br/>
🎧 and in fact has written 25 scores of that type.<br/>
🎧 In our third concert,<br/>
🎧 Vine will be represented by his music for the flag hand-over ceremony of the Olympics held in 1996.<br/>
🎧 This seven-minute orchestral piece was of course heard by millions of people worldwide,<br/>
🎧 and we'll hear it alongside works written by British composers Edward Elgar and, more recently, Thomas Adès.<br/>
<br/><br/>
