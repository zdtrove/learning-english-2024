🎧 Hello, <span>Flanders</span> <span>conference</span> <span>hotel</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, hi. I wanted to ask about <span>conference</span> <span>facilities</span> at the <span>hotel</span>.<br/>
🎧 Have I come through to the right person?<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm..</span>. You have. I'm the <span>customer</span> <span>services</span> <span>manager</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>name's</span> <span>Angela</span>.<br/>
🎧 So how can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm <span>calling</span> from <span>Barrett</span> and <span>Stansons</span>,<br/>
🎧 we're a <span>medical</span> company <span>based</span> in <span>Perth</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes.<br/>
🎧 And we're <span>organising</span> a <span>conference</span> for our <span>clients</span> to be <span>held</span> in <span>Sydney</span>.<br/>
🎧 It'll be <span>held</span> over two <span>days</span> and we're <span>expecting</span> about <span>fifty</span> or <span>sixty</span> people.<br/>
🎧 When were you thinking of having it?<br/>
🎧 Some time <span>early</span> next year, like the end of <span>January</span>?<br/>
🎧 It'd have to be a weekend.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ah..</span>. let me <span>see…<br/></span>
🎧 our <span>conference</span> <span>facilities</span> are already <span>booked</span> for the weekend <span>beginning</span> <span>January</span> the <span>28th</span>.<br/>
🎧 We could do the first weekend in <span>February</span>?<br/>
🎧 How about <span>January</span> the <span>21st</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh.</span>. I'm <span>afraid</span> that's <span>booked</span> too.<br/>
🎧 Well, let's go for the <span>February</span> date then.<br/>
🎧 So that's the weekend <span>beginning</span> the <span>4th</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Now can you tell me a bit about what <span>conference</span> <span>facilities</span> you have?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 So for <span>talks</span> and <span>presentations</span> we have the <span>Tesla</span> room.<br/>
🎧 Sorry?<br/>
🎧 <span>Tesla</span> <span>-</span> that's <span>spelled</span> <span>TESLA</span>.<br/>
🎧 it <span>holds</span> up to a <span>hundred</span> people,<br/>
🎧 and it's <span>fully</span> <span>equipped</span> with a <span>projector</span> and so on.<br/>
🎧 How about a <span>microphone</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, <span>that'll</span> be all set up ready for you,<br/>
🎧 and <span>there'll</span> be one that <span>members</span> of the <span>audience</span> can use too, for <span>questions</span>, if <span>necessary</span>.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 And we'll also need some <span>sort</span> of open <span>area</span> where people can sit and have a cup of <span>coffee</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we'd like to have an <span>exhibition</span> of our <span>products</span> and <span>services</span> there as well,<br/>
🎧 so <span>that'll</span> need to be quite a big <span>space</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's fine,<br/>
🎧 there's a <span>central</span> <span>atrium</span> with all those <span>facilities</span>,<br/>
🎧 and you can come before the <span>conference</span> <span>starts</span> if you want to set everything up.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 And I <span>presume</span> there's <span>wifi</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, that's free and <span>available</span> <span>throughout</span> the <span>hotel</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Would you also like us to <span>provide</span> a <span>buffet</span> lunch?<br/>
🎧 We can do a <span>two-course</span> <span>meal</span> with a number of different options.<br/>
🎧 What <span>sort</span> of <span>price</span> are we looking at for that?<br/>
🎧 Well, I can <span>send</span> you a <span>copy</span> of the <span>standard</span> <span>menu</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>$45</span> <span>per</span> person.<br/>
🎧 Or you can have the special for <span>$25</span> more.<br/>
🎧 I think the <span>standard</span> should be OK, but yes, <span>send</span> me the <span>menu</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now we're also going to need <span>accommodation</span> on the <span>Saturday</span> <span>night</span> for some of the <span>participants…<br/></span>
🎧 I'm not sure how many, but probably about <span>25</span>.<br/>
🎧 So what do you <span>charge</span> for a room?<br/>
🎧 Well, for <span>conference</span> <span>attendees</span> we have a <span>25%</span> <span>reduction</span>,<br/>
🎧 so we can <span>offer</span> you <span>rooms</span> at <span>$135</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Normally</span> a <span>standard</span> <span>room's</span> <span>$180</span>.<br/>
🎧 And does that <span>include</span> <span>breakfast</span>?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 And of course, <span>guests</span> can also make use of all the other <span>facilities</span> at the <span>hotel</span>.<br/>
🎧 So we've got a <span>spa</span> where you can get <span>massages</span> and <span>facials</span> and so on,<br/>
🎧 and there's a <span>pool</span> up on the <span>roof</span> for the use of <span>guests</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ah..</span>. great.<br/>
🎧 Now what about <span>transport</span> <span>links</span>?<br/>
🎧 The <span>hotel's</span> <span>downtown</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's about <span>12</span> <span>kilometres</span> from the <span>airport</span>,<br/>
🎧 but there's a <span>complimentary</span> <span>shuttle</span> bus for <span>guests</span>.<br/>
🎧 And it's only about ten <span>minutes'</span> <span>walk</span> from the <span>central</span> <span>railway</span> <span>station</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Now, I don't know <span>Sydney</span> very well,<br/>
🎧 can you just give me an idea of the <span>location</span> of the <span>hotel</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Ah..</span>. well, it's <span>downtown</span> on <span>Wilby</span> <span>Street</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>ah..</span>. that's quite a small <span>street</span>, and it's not very <span>far</span> from the sea.<br/>
🎧 And of course if the <span>conference</span> <span>attendees</span> want to go out on the <span>Saturday</span> <span>evening</span>,<br/>
🎧 there's a <span>huge</span> <span>choice</span> of <span>places</span> to eat.<br/>
🎧 Then if they want to make a <span>night</span> of it,<br/>
🎧 they can go on to one of the <span>clubs</span> in the <span>area</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 there are a great many to choose from.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So if we go ahead with this,<br/>
🎧 Can you give me some <span>information</span> about how <span>much…<br/></span>

🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 My <span>name's</span> <span>Lucy</span> <span>Crittenden</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I'm the <span>Director</span> of <span>Operations</span> for an <span>organisation</span> that <span>arranges</span> <span>volunteering</span> in this <span>part</span> of the <span>country</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>hoping</span> I can <span>persuade</span> one or two of you to become <span>volunteers</span> <span>yourselves</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let me start by <span>briefly</span> <span>explaining</span> what we mean by <span>volunteering</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Volunteers</span> are <span>teenagers</span> and <span>adults</span> who choose to <span>spend</span> some time, <span>unpaid</span>, <span>helping</span> other people in some way.<br/>
🎧 Most <span>volunteers</span> <span>devote</span> two or <span>three</span> hours to this every week, while a few do much more.<br/>
🎧 The people they help may have <span>physical</span> or <span>behavioural</span> <span>difficulties</span>, for example.<br/>
🎧 <span>Volunteers</span> can do all <span>sorts</span> of things, <span>depending</span> on their own <span>abilities</span> and <span>interests</span>.<br/>
🎧 If they're <span>supporting</span> a <span>family</span> that's <span>struggling</span>, for example,<br/>
🎧 they may be able to give them <span>tips</span> on cooking,<br/>
🎧 or <span>recommend</span> how to plan their <span>budget<br/></span>
🎧 or how to <span>shop</span> <span>sensibly</span> on their <span>income</span>.<br/>
🎧 They might even do some <span>painting</span> or <span>wallpapering</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>perhaps</span> <span>alongside</span> any <span>members</span> of the <span>family</span> who are able to do it.<br/>
🎧 Or even do some <span>babysitting</span> so that <span>parents</span> can go out for a while.<br/>
🎧 The <span>benefit</span> from <span>volunteering</span> isn't only for the people being <span>helped</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Volunteers</span> also <span>gain</span> from it:<br/>
🎧 they're <span>using</span> their <span>skills</span> to <span>cope</span> with <span>somebody's</span> <span>mental</span> or <span>physical</span> <span>ill</span> <span>health</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>volunteering</span> may be a <span>valuable</span> <span>element</span> of their <span>CV</span> when they're <span>applying</span> for <span>jobs</span>:<br/>
🎧 <span>employers</span> usually look <span>favourably</span> on <span>someone</span> who's <span>given</span> up time to help <span>others</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Significantly</span>, most <span>volunteers</span> feel that what they're doing <span>gives</span> them a <span>purpose</span> in their lives.<br/>
🎧 And in my <span>opinion</span>, they're <span>lucky</span> in that <span>respect</span>,<br/>
🎧 as many people don't have that feeling.<br/>
🎧 Now I'd like to tell you what some of our <span>volunteers</span> have said about what they do,<br/>
🎧 to give you an idea of the <span>range</span> of <span>ways</span> in which they can help people.<br/>
🎧 <span>Habib</span> <span>supports</span> an <span>elderly</span> <span>lady</span> who's <span>beginning</span> to show <span>signs</span> of <span>dementia</span>.<br/>
🎧 Once a week they, along with other <span>elderly</span> people, go to the <span>local</span> <span>community</span> <span>centre</span>,<br/>
🎧 where a group of people come in and <span>sing</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>songs</span> take the <span>listeners</span> back to their <span>youth</span>,<br/>
🎧 and for a little while they can <span>forget</span> the <span>difficulties</span> that they <span>face</span> now.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>volunteer</span> <span>Consuela</span> is an amazing <span>woman</span>.<br/>
🎧 She has <span>difficulty</span> <span>walking</span> <span>herself</span>, but she doesn't let that <span>stop</span> her.<br/>
🎧 She helps a <span>couple</span> of people with <span>similar</span> <span>difficulties</span>,<br/>
🎧 who had almost <span>stopped</span> <span>walking</span> <span>altogether</span>.<br/>
🎧 By <span>using</span> <span>herself</span> as an example,<br/>
🎧 <span>Consuela</span> <span>encourages</span> them to <span>walk</span> more and more.<br/>
🎧 <span>Minh</span> <span>visits</span> a young man who lives <span>alone</span> and can't leave his home on his own,<br/>
🎧 so he <span>hardly</span> ever saw <span>anyone</span>.<br/>
🎧 But together they go out to the <span>cinema</span>,<br/>
🎧 or to see friends the young man hadn't been able to visit for a long time.<br/>
🎧 <span>Tanya</span> <span>visits</span> an <span>elderly</span> <span>woman</span> once a week.<br/>
🎧 When the <span>woman</span> <span>found</span> out that <span>Tanya</span> is a <span>professional</span> <span>dressmaker</span>, she got interested.<br/>
🎧 <span>Tanya</span> <span>showed</span> her some <span>soft</span> <span>toys</span> she'd made,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>woman</span> <span>decided</span> to try it <span>herself</span>.<br/>
🎧 And now she really <span>enjoys</span> it, and <span>spends</span> hours <span>making</span> <span>toys</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're not <span>perhaps</span> up to <span>Tanya's</span> <span>standard</span> yet,<br/>
🎧 but she <span>gains</span> a lot of <span>pleasure</span> from doing it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Alexei</span> is a <span>volunteer</span> with a <span>family</span> that <span>faces</span> a number of <span>difficulties</span>.<br/>
🎧 By <span>calmly</span> talking over <span>possible</span> <span>solutions</span> with <span>family</span> <span>members</span>,<br/>
🎧 he's <span>helping</span> them to <span>realise</span> that they aren't <span>helpless</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that they can do something <span>themselves</span> to <span>improve</span> their <span>situation</span>.<br/>
🎧 This has been great for their <span>self-esteem</span>.<br/>
🎧 And the last <span>volunteer</span> I'll <span>mention</span>, though there are <span>plenty</span> more, is <span>Juba</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>volunteers</span> with a <span>teenage</span> girl with <span>learning</span> <span>difficulties</span>,<br/>
🎧 who wasn't very good at talking to other people.<br/>
🎧 <span>Juba's</span> <span>worked</span> very <span>patiently</span> with her,<br/>
🎧 and now the girl is <span>far</span> better at <span>expressing</span> <span>herself</span>,<br/>
🎧 and at <span>understanding</span> other people.<br/>
🎧 OK, I hope that's <span>given</span> you an idea of what <span>volunteering</span> is all about.<br/>
🎧 Now I'd <span>like…<br/></span>

🎧 So how are you getting on with your <span>teaching</span> practice at the High School, <span>Joe</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well I've been put in <span>charge</span> of the school <span>marching</span> <span>band</span>, and it's quite a <span>responsibility</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to talk it over with you.<br/>
🎧 Go ahead.<br/>
🎧 You'd better start by <span>giving</span> me a bit of <span>background</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Well the <span>band</span> has students in it from all years,<br/>
🎧 so they're <span>aged</span> <span>11</span> to <span>18</span>, and there are about <span>50</span> of them <span>altogether</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's quite a <span>popular</span> <span>activity</span> <span>within</span> the school.<br/>
🎧 I've never <span>worked</span> with a <span>band</span> of more than <span>20</span> before, and this is very different.<br/>
🎧 I can <span>imagine</span>.<br/>
🎧 They aren't really good enough to <span>enter</span> <span>national</span> <span>band</span> <span>competitions</span>,<br/>
🎧 but they're in a <span>regional</span> one later in the <span>term</span>.<br/>
🎧 Even if they don't win, and I don't <span>expect</span> them to,<br/>
🎧 <span>hopefully</span> it'll be an <span>incentive</span> for them to try and <span>improve</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, <span>hopefully</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, now the <span>town</span> <span>council's</span> <span>organising</span> a <span>carnival</span> in the <span>summer</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>band</span> has been <span>asked</span> to <span>perform</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you ask me, they aren't really up to it yet,<br/>
🎧 and I need to get them <span>functioning</span> better as a <span>band</span>, and in a very short time.<br/>
🎧 Have you been doing anything with them?<br/>
🎧 <span>Apart</span> from <span>practising</span> the music, I mean.<br/>
🎧 I <span>played</span> a <span>recording</span> I came across,<br/>
🎧 of a <span>drummer</span> talking about how playing in a <span>band</span> had <span>changed</span> his life.<br/>
🎧 I think it was an <span>after-dinner</span> <span>speech</span>.<br/>
🎧 I thought it was <span>pretty</span> <span>inspiring</span>,<br/>
🎧 because being in the <span>band</span> had <span>stopped</span> him from getting <span>involved</span> in <span>crime</span>.<br/>
🎧 The students <span>seemed</span> to find it <span>interesting</span>, too.<br/>
🎧 That's good.<br/>
🎧 I'm planning to show them that old <span>film</span> from the <span>1940s</span> <span>'Strike</span> Up the <span>Band'</span>,<br/>
🎧 and talk about it with the students.<br/>
🎧 What do you think?<br/>
🎧 Good idea.<br/>
🎧 As it's about a school <span>band</span>, it might make the students <span>realise</span> how much they can <span>achieve</span> if they work together.<br/>
🎧 That's what I've got in <span>mind</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>hoping</span> I can take some of the <span>band</span> to a <span>parade</span> that's going to take place next month.<br/>
🎧 A <span>couple</span> of <span>marching</span> <span>bands</span> will be <span>performing</span>, and the <span>atmosphere</span> should be quite <span>exciting</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>depends</span> on <span>whether</span> I can <span>persuade</span> the school to <span>hire</span> a <span>coach</span> or two to take us there.<br/>
🎧 They sound like good <span>ideas</span> to me.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Can I tell you about a few people in the <span>band</span> who I'm <span>finding</span> it quite <span>difficult</span> to <span>cope</span> with?<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you'll have some <span>ideas</span> about what I can do.<br/>
🎧 Go ahead.<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>flautist</span> who says she <span>loves</span> playing in the <span>band</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>rehearse</span> <span>twice</span> a week after school, but she's <span>hardly</span> ever there.<br/>
🎧 Then she looks for me the next day and <span>gives</span> me a very <span>plausible</span> <span>reason</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 she says she had to help her <span>mother</span>, or she's been <span>ill</span>,<br/>
🎧 but to be <span>honest</span>, I don't <span>believe</span> her.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>dear</span>!<br/>
🎧 Any more students with <span>difficulties</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Plenty</span>!<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>trumpeter</span> who <span>thinks</span> she's the best <span>musician</span> in the <span>band</span>, though she <span>certainly</span> isn't.<br/>
🎧 She's always saying what she <span>thinks</span> other people should do, which makes my <span>job</span> <span>pretty</span> <span>difficult</span>.<br/>
🎧 She sounds a bit of a <span>nightmare</span>!<br/>
🎧 You can say that again.<br/>
🎧 <span>Uh..</span>. one of the <span>trombonists</span> has got an <span>impressive</span> <span>sense</span> of <span>rhythm</span>,<br/>
🎧 and could be an <span>excellent</span> <span>musician</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>except</span> that he has <span>breathing</span> <span>difficulties</span>,<br/>
🎧 and he doesn't really have enough <span>breath</span> for the <span>trombone</span>.<br/>
🎧 He'd be much better off playing <span>percussion</span>, for <span>instance</span>, but he <span>refuses</span> to give up.<br/>
🎧 So he <span>ends</span> up only playing <span>half</span> the <span>notes</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> you have to <span>admire</span> his <span>determination</span>.<br/>
🎧 Maybe.<br/>
🎧 One of the <span>percussionists</span> isn't too bad,<br/>
🎧 but he never <span>seems</span> to <span>interact</span> with other people,<br/>
🎧 and he always <span>rushes</span> off as soon as the <span>rehearsal</span> <span>ends</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't know if there are <span>family</span> <span>reasons</span>, or what.<br/>
🎧 But it isn't good in a <span>band</span>, where people really need to feel they're <span>part</span> of a group.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>others</span> too, but at <span>least</span> that <span>gives</span> you an idea of what I'm up <span>against</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you have any <span>thoughts</span> about what I can do, <span>Lizzie</span>?<br/>
<br />

🎧 As you all know, the university is planning an <span>arts</span> <span>festival</span> for later this year,<br/>
🎧 and here in the music <span>department</span> we've <span>planned</span> <span>three</span> <span>concerts</span>.<br/>
🎧 These will be <span>public</span> <span>performances</span>, and the <span>programme</span> has just been <span>finalised</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>theme</span> of the <span>festival</span> is <span>links</span> between the <span>UK</span> and <span>Australia</span>,<br/>
🎧 and this is <span>reflected</span> in the music:<br/>
🎧 each <span>concert</span> will <span>feature</span> both <span>British</span> and <span>Australian</span> <span>composers</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll tell you <span>briefly</span> about the <span>Australian</span> music,<br/>
🎧 as you probably won't be <span>familiar</span> with that.<br/>
🎧 The first <span>concert</span> will <span>include</span> music by <span>Liza</span> <span>Lim</span>,<br/>
🎧 who was <span>born</span> in <span>Perth</span>, <span>Western</span> <span>Australia</span>, in <span>1966</span>.<br/>
🎧 As a <span>child</span>, <span>Lim</span> <span>originally</span> <span>learned</span> to play the <span>piano</span> <span>-</span> like so many children <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and also the <span>violin</span>.<br/>
🎧 But when she was <span>11</span> her <span>teachers</span> <span>encouraged</span> her to start <span>composing</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>found</span> this was her <span>real</span> <span>strength</span>,<br/>
🎧 and she <span>studied</span> and later <span>taught</span> <span>composition</span>,<br/>
🎧 both in <span>Australia</span> and in other <span>countries</span>.<br/>
🎧 As a <span>composer</span>, she has <span>received</span> <span>commissions</span> from <span>numerous</span> <span>orchestras</span>,<br/>
🎧 other <span>performers</span> and <span>festivals</span> in <span>several</span> <span>countries</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Liza</span> <span>Lim's</span> <span>compositions</span> are <span>vibrant</span> and full of <span>energy</span>,<br/>
🎧 and she often <span>explores</span> <span>Asian</span> and <span>Australian</span> <span>Aboriginal</span> <span>cultural</span> <span>sources</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>including</span> the <span>native</span> <span>instrument</span>, the <span>didgeridoo</span>:<br/>
🎧 this is <span>featured</span> in a work called The <span>Compass</span>.<br/>
🎧 Her music is very <span>expressive</span>,<br/>
🎧 so although it is <span>complex</span>,<br/>
🎧 it has the <span>power</span> of <span>connecting</span> with <span>audiences</span> and <span>performers</span> <span>alike</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>festival</span> we're going to give a <span>semi-staged</span> <span>performance</span> of The <span>Oresteia</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is an <span>opera</span> in <span>seven</span> <span>parts</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>based</span> on the <span>trilogy</span> of <span>ancient</span> <span>Greek</span> <span>tragedies</span> by <span>Aeschylus</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Lim</span> <span>composed</span> this when she was in her <span>mid-20s</span>,<br/>
🎧 and she also <span>wrote</span> the <span>text</span>, along with <span>Barrie</span> <span>Kosky</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>performed</span> by six <span>singers</span>, a <span>dancer</span>,<br/>
🎧 and an <span>orchestra</span> that, as well as <span>standard</span> <span>orchestral</span> <span>instruments</span>, <span>includes</span> <span>electric</span> <span>guitar</span>,<br/>
🎧 and a <span>traditional</span> <span>Turkish</span> <span>stringed</span> <span>instrument</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Lim</span> <span>wrote</span> that because the <span>stories</span> in the <span>tragedies</span> are not easy to tell,<br/>
🎧 the sounds she <span>creates</span> are also <span>disturbing</span>,<br/>
🎧 and they <span>include</span> <span>breathing</span>, <span>sobbing</span>, <span>laughing</span> and <span>whistling</span>.<br/>
🎧 The work <span>lasts</span> around <span>75</span> <span>minutes</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>rest</span> of the <span>concert</span> will <span>consist</span> of <span>orchestral</span> <span>works</span> by the <span>British</span> <span>composers<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Ralph</span> <span>Vaughan</span> <span>Williams</span> and <span>Frederick</span> <span>Delius</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Moving</span> on now to our second <span>concert</span>,<br/>
🎧 this will <span>begin</span> with <span>instrumental</span> music by <span>British</span> <span>composers</span> <span>-</span> <span>Benjamin</span> <span>Britten</span> and <span>Judith</span> <span>Weir</span>.<br/>
🎧 After the <span>interval</span> we'll go to <span>Australia</span> for a <span>piece</span> by <span>Ross</span> <span>Edwards</span>:<br/>
🎧 The <span>Tower</span> of <span>Remoteness</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>According</span> to <span>Edwards</span>, the <span>inspiration</span> for this <span>piece</span> came from <span>nature</span>,<br/>
🎧 when he was <span>sitting</span> <span>alone</span> in the dry bed of a <span>creek</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>overshadowed</span> by the leaves of <span>palm</span> <span>trees</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>listening</span> to the <span>birds</span> and <span>insects</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Tower</span> of <span>Remoteness</span> is <span>scored</span> for <span>piano</span> and <span>clarinet</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Edwards</span> says he <span>realised</span> years after <span>writing</span> the <span>piece<br/></span>
🎧 that he had <span>subconsciously</span> <span>modelled</span> its <span>opening</span> <span>phrase</span> on a <span>bird</span> call.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ross</span> <span>Edwards</span> was <span>born</span> in <span>1943</span> in <span>Sydney</span>, <span>Australia</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>studied</span> at the <span>Sydney</span> <span>Conservatorium</span> of <span>Music<br/></span>
🎧 and the <span>universities</span> of <span>Adelaide</span> and <span>Sydney</span>.<br/>
🎧 He's well <span>known</span> in <span>Australia</span>,<br/>
🎧 and in <span>fact</span> he's one of the <span>country's</span> most <span>performed</span> <span>composers</span>.<br/>
🎧 He's <span>written</span> a <span>wide</span> <span>range</span> of music,<br/>
🎧 from <span>symphonies</span> and <span>concertos</span> to some <span>composed</span> <span>specifically</span> for children.<br/>
🎧 <span>Edwards's</span> music has been <span>described</span> as being <span>'deeply</span> <span>connected</span> to <span>Australia'</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it can be <span>regarded</span> as a <span>celebration</span> of the <span>diversity</span> of <span>cultures</span> that <span>Australia</span> can be <span>proud</span> of.<br/>
🎧 The last of the <span>three</span> <span>Australian</span> <span>composers</span> to be <span>represented</span> in our <span>festival</span> is <span>Carl</span> <span>Vine</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Born</span> in <span>1954</span>, <span>Vine</span>, like <span>Liza</span> <span>Lim</span>, comes from <span>Perth</span>, <span>Western</span> <span>Australia</span>.<br/>
🎧 He took up the <span>cornet</span> at the age of <span>five</span>, <span>switching</span> to the <span>piano</span> <span>five</span> years later.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, he went to university to <span>study</span> <span>physics</span>, before <span>changing</span> to <span>composition</span>.<br/>
🎧 After <span>graduating</span> he <span>moved</span> to <span>Sydney</span> and <span>worked</span> as a <span>freelance</span> <span>pianist</span> and <span>composer</span>.<br/>
🎧 Before long he had become <span>prominent</span> in <span>Australia</span> as a <span>composer</span> for <span>dance</span>,<br/>
🎧 and in <span>fact</span> has <span>written</span> <span>25</span> <span>scores</span> of that <span>type</span>.<br/>
🎧 In our <span>third</span> <span>concert</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>Vine</span> will be <span>represented</span> by his music for the <span>flag</span> <span>hand-over</span> <span>ceremony</span> of the <span>Olympics</span> <span>held</span> in <span>1996</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>seven-minute</span> <span>orchestral</span> <span>piece</span> was of course heard by <span>millions</span> of people <span>worldwide</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we'll hear it <span>alongside</span> <span>works</span> <span>written</span> by <span>British</span> <span>composers</span> <span>Edward</span> <span>Elgar</span> and, more <span>recently</span>, <span>Thomas</span> <span>Adès</span>.<br/>
