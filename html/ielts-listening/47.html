🎧 Hello, <span>Flanders <span>conference <span>hotel.<br/>
🎧 Oh, hi. I wanted to ask about <span>conference <span>facilities at the <span>hotel.<br/>
🎧 Have I come through to the right person?<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm... You have. I'm the <span>customer <span>services <span>manager.<br/>
🎧 My <span>name's <span>Angela.<br/>
🎧 So how can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm <span>calling from <span>Barrett and <span>Stansons,<br/>
🎧 we're a <span>medical company <span>based in <span>Perth.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes.<br/>
🎧 And we're <span>organising a <span>conference for our <span>clients to be <span>held in <span>Sydney.<br/>
🎧 It'll be <span>held over two <span>days and we're <span>expecting about <span>fifty or <span>sixty people.<br/>
🎧 When were you thinking of having it?<br/>
🎧 Some time <span>early next year, like the end of <span>January?<br/>
🎧 It'd have to be a weekend.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ah... let me <span>see…<br/>
🎧 our <span>conference <span>facilities are already <span>booked for the weekend <span>beginning <span>January the <span>28th.<br/>
🎧 We could do the first weekend in <span>February?<br/>
🎧 How about <span>January the <span>21st?<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh.. I'm <span>afraid that's <span>booked too.<br/>
🎧 Well, let's go for the <span>February date then.<br/>
🎧 So that's the weekend <span>beginning the <span>4th.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Now can you tell me a bit about what <span>conference <span>facilities you have?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 So for <span>talks and <span>presentations we have the <span>Tesla room.<br/>
🎧 Sorry?<br/>
🎧 <span>Tesla <span>- that's <span>spelled <span>TESLA.<br/>
🎧 it <span>holds up to a <span>hundred people,<br/>
🎧 and it's <span>fully <span>equipped with a <span>projector and so on.<br/>
🎧 How about a <span>microphone?<br/>
🎧 Yes, <span>that'll be all set up ready for you,<br/>
🎧 and <span>there'll be one that <span>members of the <span>audience can use too, for <span>questions, if <span>necessary.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 And we'll also need some <span>sort of open <span>area where people can sit and have a cup of <span>coffee,<br/>
🎧 and we'd like to have an <span>exhibition of our <span>products and <span>services there as well,<br/>
🎧 so <span>that'll need to be quite a big <span>space.<br/>
🎧 That's fine,<br/>
🎧 there's a <span>central <span>atrium with all those <span>facilities,<br/>
🎧 and you can come before the <span>conference <span>starts if you want to set everything up.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 And I <span>presume there's <span>wifi?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, that's free and <span>available <span>throughout the <span>hotel.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Would you also like us to <span>provide a <span>buffet lunch?<br/>
🎧 We can do a <span>two-course <span>meal with a number of different options.<br/>
🎧 What <span>sort of <span>price are we looking at for that?<br/>
🎧 Well, I can <span>send you a <span>copy of the <span>standard <span>menu.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>$45 <span>per person.<br/>
🎧 Or you can have the special for <span>$25 more.<br/>
🎧 I think the <span>standard should be OK, but yes, <span>send me the <span>menu.<br/>
🎧 Now we're also going to need <span>accommodation on the <span>Saturday <span>night for some of the <span>participants…<br/>
🎧 I'm not sure how many, but probably about <span>25.<br/>
🎧 So what do you <span>charge for a room?<br/>
🎧 Well, for <span>conference <span>attendees we have a <span>25% <span>reduction,<br/>
🎧 so we can <span>offer you <span>rooms at <span>$135.<br/>
🎧 <span>Normally a <span>standard <span>room's <span>$180.<br/>
🎧 And does that <span>include <span>breakfast?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 And of course, <span>guests can also make use of all the other <span>facilities at the <span>hotel.<br/>
🎧 So we've got a <span>spa where you can get <span>massages and <span>facials and so on,<br/>
🎧 and there's a <span>pool up on the <span>roof for the use of <span>guests.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ah... great.<br/>
🎧 Now what about <span>transport <span>links?<br/>
🎧 The <span>hotel's <span>downtown, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's about <span>12 <span>kilometres from the <span>airport,<br/>
🎧 but there's a <span>complimentary <span>shuttle bus for <span>guests.<br/>
🎧 And it's only about ten <span>minutes' <span>walk from the <span>central <span>railway <span>station.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Now, I don't know <span>Sydney very well,<br/>
🎧 can you just give me an idea of the <span>location of the <span>hotel?<br/>
🎧 <span>Ah... well, it's <span>downtown on <span>Wilby <span>Street,<br/>
🎧 <span>ah... that's quite a small <span>street, and it's not very <span>far from the sea.<br/>
🎧 And of course if the <span>conference <span>attendees want to go out on the <span>Saturday <span>evening,<br/>
🎧 there's a <span>huge <span>choice of <span>places to eat.<br/>
🎧 Then if they want to make a <span>night of it,<br/>
🎧 they can go on to one of the <span>clubs in the <span>area <span>-<br/>
🎧 there are a great many to choose from.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So if we go ahead with this,<br/>
🎧 Can you give me some <span>information about how <span>much…<br/>
<br />

🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 My <span>name's <span>Lucy <span>Crittenden,<br/>
🎧 and I'm the <span>Director of <span>Operations for an <span>organisation that <span>arranges <span>volunteering in this <span>part of the <span>country.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>hoping I can <span>persuade one or two of you to become <span>volunteers <span>yourselves.<br/>
🎧 Let me start by <span>briefly <span>explaining what we mean by <span>volunteering.<br/>
🎧 <span>Volunteers are <span>teenagers and <span>adults who choose to <span>spend some time, <span>unpaid, <span>helping other people in some way.<br/>
🎧 Most <span>volunteers <span>devote two or <span>three hours to this every week, while a few do much more.<br/>
🎧 The people they help may have <span>physical or <span>behavioural <span>difficulties, for example.<br/>
🎧 <span>Volunteers can do all <span>sorts of things, <span>depending on their own <span>abilities and <span>interests.<br/>
🎧 If they're <span>supporting a <span>family that's <span>struggling, for example,<br/>
🎧 they may be able to give them <span>tips on cooking,<br/>
🎧 or <span>recommend how to plan their <span>budget<br/>
🎧 or how to <span>shop <span>sensibly on their <span>income.<br/>
🎧 They might even do some <span>painting or <span>wallpapering,<br/>
🎧 <span>perhaps <span>alongside any <span>members of the <span>family who are able to do it.<br/>
🎧 Or even do some <span>babysitting so that <span>parents can go out for a while.<br/>
🎧 The <span>benefit from <span>volunteering isn't only for the people being <span>helped.<br/>
🎧 <span>Volunteers also <span>gain from it:<br/>
🎧 they're <span>using their <span>skills to <span>cope with <span>somebody's <span>mental or <span>physical <span>ill <span>health,<br/>
🎧 and <span>volunteering may be a <span>valuable <span>element of their <span>CV when they're <span>applying for <span>jobs:<br/>
🎧 <span>employers usually look <span>favourably on <span>someone who's <span>given up time to help <span>others.<br/>
🎧 <span>Significantly, most <span>volunteers feel that what they're doing <span>gives them a <span>purpose in their lives.<br/>
🎧 And in my <span>opinion, they're <span>lucky in that <span>respect,<br/>
🎧 as many people don't have that feeling.<br/>
🎧 Now I'd like to tell you what some of our <span>volunteers have said about what they do,<br/>
🎧 to give you an idea of the <span>range of <span>ways in which they can help people.<br/>
🎧 <span>Habib <span>supports an <span>elderly <span>lady who's <span>beginning to show <span>signs of <span>dementia.<br/>
🎧 Once a week they, along with other <span>elderly people, go to the <span>local <span>community <span>centre,<br/>
🎧 where a group of people come in and <span>sing.<br/>
🎧 The <span>songs take the <span>listeners back to their <span>youth,<br/>
🎧 and for a little while they can <span>forget the <span>difficulties that they <span>face now.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>volunteer <span>Consuela is an amazing <span>woman.<br/>
🎧 She has <span>difficulty <span>walking <span>herself, but she doesn't let that <span>stop her.<br/>
🎧 She helps a <span>couple of people with <span>similar <span>difficulties,<br/>
🎧 who had almost <span>stopped <span>walking <span>altogether.<br/>
🎧 By <span>using <span>herself as an example,<br/>
🎧 <span>Consuela <span>encourages them to <span>walk more and more.<br/>
🎧 <span>Minh <span>visits a young man who lives <span>alone and can't leave his home on his own,<br/>
🎧 so he <span>hardly ever saw <span>anyone.<br/>
🎧 But together they go out to the <span>cinema,<br/>
🎧 or to see friends the young man hadn't been able to visit for a long time.<br/>
🎧 <span>Tanya <span>visits an <span>elderly <span>woman once a week.<br/>
🎧 When the <span>woman <span>found out that <span>Tanya is a <span>professional <span>dressmaker, she got interested.<br/>
🎧 <span>Tanya <span>showed her some <span>soft <span>toys she'd made,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>woman <span>decided to try it <span>herself.<br/>
🎧 And now she really <span>enjoys it, and <span>spends hours <span>making <span>toys.<br/>
🎧 They're not <span>perhaps up to <span>Tanya's <span>standard yet,<br/>
🎧 but she <span>gains a lot of <span>pleasure from doing it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Alexei is a <span>volunteer with a <span>family that <span>faces a number of <span>difficulties.<br/>
🎧 By <span>calmly talking over <span>possible <span>solutions with <span>family <span>members,<br/>
🎧 he's <span>helping them to <span>realise that they aren't <span>helpless,<br/>
🎧 and that they can do something <span>themselves to <span>improve their <span>situation.<br/>
🎧 This has been great for their <span>self-esteem.<br/>
🎧 And the last <span>volunteer I'll <span>mention, though there are <span>plenty more, is <span>Juba.<br/>
🎧 She <span>volunteers with a <span>teenage girl with <span>learning <span>difficulties,<br/>
🎧 who wasn't very good at talking to other people.<br/>
🎧 <span>Juba's <span>worked very <span>patiently with her,<br/>
🎧 and now the girl is <span>far better at <span>expressing <span>herself,<br/>
🎧 and at <span>understanding other people.<br/>
🎧 OK, I hope that's <span>given you an idea of what <span>volunteering is all about.<br/>
🎧 Now I'd <span>like…<br/>
<br />

🎧 So how are you getting on with your <span>teaching practice at the High School, <span>Joe?<br/>
🎧 Well I've been put in <span>charge of the school <span>marching <span>band, and it's quite a <span>responsibility.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to talk it over with you.<br/>
🎧 Go ahead.<br/>
🎧 You'd better start by <span>giving me a bit of <span>background.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Well the <span>band has students in it from all years,<br/>
🎧 so they're <span>aged <span>11 to <span>18, and there are about <span>50 of them <span>altogether.<br/>
🎧 It's quite a <span>popular <span>activity <span>within the school.<br/>
🎧 I've never <span>worked with a <span>band of more than <span>20 before, and this is very different.<br/>
🎧 I can <span>imagine.<br/>
🎧 They aren't really good enough to <span>enter <span>national <span>band <span>competitions,<br/>
🎧 but they're in a <span>regional one later in the <span>term.<br/>
🎧 Even if they don't win, and I don't <span>expect them to,<br/>
🎧 <span>hopefully it'll be an <span>incentive for them to try and <span>improve.<br/>
🎧 Yes, <span>hopefully.<br/>
🎧 Well, now the <span>town <span>council's <span>organising a <span>carnival in the <span>summer,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>band has been <span>asked to <span>perform.<br/>
🎧 If you ask me, they aren't really up to it yet,<br/>
🎧 and I need to get them <span>functioning better as a <span>band, and in a very short time.<br/>
🎧 Have you been doing anything with them?<br/>
🎧 <span>Apart from <span>practising the music, I mean.<br/>
🎧 I <span>played a <span>recording I came across,<br/>
🎧 of a <span>drummer talking about how playing in a <span>band had <span>changed his life.<br/>
🎧 I think it was an <span>after-dinner <span>speech.<br/>
🎧 I thought it was <span>pretty <span>inspiring,<br/>
🎧 because being in the <span>band had <span>stopped him from getting <span>involved in <span>crime.<br/>
🎧 The students <span>seemed to find it <span>interesting, too.<br/>
🎧 That's good.<br/>
🎧 I'm planning to show them that old <span>film from the <span>1940s <span>'Strike Up the <span>Band',<br/>
🎧 and talk about it with the students.<br/>
🎧 What do you think?<br/>
🎧 Good idea.<br/>
🎧 As it's about a school <span>band, it might make the students <span>realise how much they can <span>achieve if they work together.<br/>
🎧 That's what I've got in <span>mind.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>hoping I can take some of the <span>band to a <span>parade that's going to take place next month.<br/>
🎧 A <span>couple of <span>marching <span>bands will be <span>performing, and the <span>atmosphere should be quite <span>exciting.<br/>
🎧 It <span>depends on <span>whether I can <span>persuade the school to <span>hire a <span>coach or two to take us there.<br/>
🎧 They sound like good <span>ideas to me.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Can I tell you about a few people in the <span>band who I'm <span>finding it quite <span>difficult to <span>cope with?<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you'll have some <span>ideas about what I can do.<br/>
🎧 Go ahead.<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>flautist who says she <span>loves playing in the <span>band.<br/>
🎧 We <span>rehearse <span>twice a week after school, but she's <span>hardly ever there.<br/>
🎧 Then she looks for me the next day and <span>gives me a very <span>plausible <span>reason <span>-<br/>
🎧 she says she had to help her <span>mother, or she's been <span>ill,<br/>
🎧 but to be <span>honest, I don't <span>believe her.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>dear!<br/>
🎧 Any more students with <span>difficulties?<br/>
🎧 <span>Plenty!<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>trumpeter who <span>thinks she's the best <span>musician in the <span>band, though she <span>certainly isn't.<br/>
🎧 She's always saying what she <span>thinks other people should do, which makes my <span>job <span>pretty <span>difficult.<br/>
🎧 She sounds a bit of a <span>nightmare!<br/>
🎧 You can say that again.<br/>
🎧 <span>Uh... one of the <span>trombonists has got an <span>impressive <span>sense of <span>rhythm,<br/>
🎧 and could be an <span>excellent <span>musician <span>-<br/>
🎧 <span>except that he has <span>breathing <span>difficulties,<br/>
🎧 and he doesn't really have enough <span>breath for the <span>trombone.<br/>
🎧 He'd be much better off playing <span>percussion, for <span>instance, but he <span>refuses to give up.<br/>
🎧 So he <span>ends up only playing <span>half the <span>notes.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose you have to <span>admire his <span>determination.<br/>
🎧 Maybe.<br/>
🎧 One of the <span>percussionists isn't too bad,<br/>
🎧 but he never <span>seems to <span>interact with other people,<br/>
🎧 and he always <span>rushes off as soon as the <span>rehearsal <span>ends.<br/>
🎧 I don't know if there are <span>family <span>reasons, or what.<br/>
🎧 But it isn't good in a <span>band, where people really need to feel they're <span>part of a group.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>others too, but at <span>least that <span>gives you an idea of what I'm up <span>against.<br/>
🎧 Do you have any <span>thoughts about what I can do, <span>Lizzie?<br/>
<br />

🎧 As you all know, the university is planning an <span>arts <span>festival for later this year,<br/>
🎧 and here in the music <span>department we've <span>planned <span>three <span>concerts.<br/>
🎧 These will be <span>public <span>performances, and the <span>programme has just been <span>finalised.<br/>
🎧 The <span>theme of the <span>festival is <span>links between the <span>UK and <span>Australia,<br/>
🎧 and this is <span>reflected in the music:<br/>
🎧 each <span>concert will <span>feature both <span>British and <span>Australian <span>composers.<br/>
🎧 I'll tell you <span>briefly about the <span>Australian music,<br/>
🎧 as you probably won't be <span>familiar with that.<br/>
🎧 The first <span>concert will <span>include music by <span>Liza <span>Lim,<br/>
🎧 who was <span>born in <span>Perth, <span>Western <span>Australia, in <span>1966.<br/>
🎧 As a <span>child, <span>Lim <span>originally <span>learned to play the <span>piano <span>- like so many children <span>-<br/>
🎧 and also the <span>violin.<br/>
🎧 But when she was <span>11 her <span>teachers <span>encouraged her to start <span>composing.<br/>
🎧 She <span>found this was her <span>real <span>strength,<br/>
🎧 and she <span>studied and later <span>taught <span>composition,<br/>
🎧 both in <span>Australia and in other <span>countries.<br/>
🎧 As a <span>composer, she has <span>received <span>commissions from <span>numerous <span>orchestras,<br/>
🎧 other <span>performers and <span>festivals in <span>several <span>countries.<br/>
🎧 <span>Liza <span>Lim's <span>compositions are <span>vibrant and full of <span>energy,<br/>
🎧 and she often <span>explores <span>Asian and <span>Australian <span>Aboriginal <span>cultural <span>sources,<br/>
🎧 <span>including the <span>native <span>instrument, the <span>didgeridoo:<br/>
🎧 this is <span>featured in a work called The <span>Compass.<br/>
🎧 Her music is very <span>expressive,<br/>
🎧 so although it is <span>complex,<br/>
🎧 it has the <span>power of <span>connecting with <span>audiences and <span>performers <span>alike.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>festival we're going to give a <span>semi-staged <span>performance of The <span>Oresteia.<br/>
🎧 This is an <span>opera in <span>seven <span>parts,<br/>
🎧 <span>based on the <span>trilogy of <span>ancient <span>Greek <span>tragedies by <span>Aeschylus.<br/>
🎧 <span>Lim <span>composed this when she was in her <span>mid-20s,<br/>
🎧 and she also <span>wrote the <span>text, along with <span>Barrie <span>Kosky.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>performed by six <span>singers, a <span>dancer,<br/>
🎧 and an <span>orchestra that, as well as <span>standard <span>orchestral <span>instruments, <span>includes <span>electric <span>guitar,<br/>
🎧 and a <span>traditional <span>Turkish <span>stringed <span>instrument.<br/>
🎧 <span>Lim <span>wrote that because the <span>stories in the <span>tragedies are not easy to tell,<br/>
🎧 the sounds she <span>creates are also <span>disturbing,<br/>
🎧 and they <span>include <span>breathing, <span>sobbing, <span>laughing and <span>whistling.<br/>
🎧 The work <span>lasts around <span>75 <span>minutes,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>rest of the <span>concert will <span>consist of <span>orchestral <span>works by the <span>British <span>composers<br/>
🎧 <span>Ralph <span>Vaughan <span>Williams and <span>Frederick <span>Delius.<br/>
🎧 <span>Moving on now to our second <span>concert,<br/>
🎧 this will <span>begin with <span>instrumental music by <span>British <span>composers <span>- <span>Benjamin <span>Britten and <span>Judith <span>Weir.<br/>
🎧 After the <span>interval we'll go to <span>Australia for a <span>piece by <span>Ross <span>Edwards:<br/>
🎧 The <span>Tower of <span>Remoteness.<br/>
🎧 <span>According to <span>Edwards, the <span>inspiration for this <span>piece came from <span>nature,<br/>
🎧 when he was <span>sitting <span>alone in the dry bed of a <span>creek,<br/>
🎧 <span>overshadowed by the leaves of <span>palm <span>trees,<br/>
🎧 <span>listening to the <span>birds and <span>insects.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Tower of <span>Remoteness is <span>scored for <span>piano and <span>clarinet.<br/>
🎧 <span>Edwards says he <span>realised years after <span>writing the <span>piece<br/>
🎧 that he had <span>subconsciously <span>modelled its <span>opening <span>phrase on a <span>bird call.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ross <span>Edwards was <span>born in <span>1943 in <span>Sydney, <span>Australia,<br/>
🎧 and <span>studied at the <span>Sydney <span>Conservatorium of <span>Music<br/>
🎧 and the <span>universities of <span>Adelaide and <span>Sydney.<br/>
🎧 He's well <span>known in <span>Australia,<br/>
🎧 and in <span>fact he's one of the <span>country's most <span>performed <span>composers.<br/>
🎧 He's <span>written a <span>wide <span>range of music,<br/>
🎧 from <span>symphonies and <span>concertos to some <span>composed <span>specifically for children.<br/>
🎧 <span>Edwards's music has been <span>described as being <span>'deeply <span>connected to <span>Australia',<br/>
🎧 and it can be <span>regarded as a <span>celebration of the <span>diversity of <span>cultures that <span>Australia can be <span>proud of.<br/>
🎧 The last of the <span>three <span>Australian <span>composers to be <span>represented in our <span>festival is <span>Carl <span>Vine.<br/>
🎧 <span>Born in <span>1954, <span>Vine, like <span>Liza <span>Lim, comes from <span>Perth, <span>Western <span>Australia.<br/>
🎧 He took up the <span>cornet at the age of <span>five, <span>switching to the <span>piano <span>five years later.<br/>
🎧 <span>However, he went to university to <span>study <span>physics, before <span>changing to <span>composition.<br/>
🎧 After <span>graduating he <span>moved to <span>Sydney and <span>worked as a <span>freelance <span>pianist and <span>composer.<br/>
🎧 Before long he had become <span>prominent in <span>Australia as a <span>composer for <span>dance,<br/>
🎧 and in <span>fact has <span>written <span>25 <span>scores of that <span>type.<br/>
🎧 In our <span>third <span>concert,<br/>
🎧 <span>Vine will be <span>represented by his music for the <span>flag <span>hand-over <span>ceremony of the <span>Olympics <span>held in <span>1996.<br/>
🎧 This <span>seven-minute <span>orchestral <span>piece was of course heard by <span>millions of people <span>worldwide,<br/>
🎧 and we'll hear it <span>alongside <span>works <span>written by <span>British <span>composers <span>Edward <span>Elgar and, more <span>recently, <span>Thomas <span>Adès.<br/>
