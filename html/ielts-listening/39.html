🎧 Hello?<br/>
🎧 Hi, <span>Susie</span>, it's <span>Paul</span> here.<br/>
🎧 How are you?<br/>
🎧 <span>Enjoying</span> your new <span>job</span>?<br/>
🎧 You're working at the <span>library</span>, aren't you?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 I <span>started</span> when the <span>library</span> <span>re-opened</span> a month ago.<br/>
🎧 It's great.<br/>
🎧 Actually <span>Carol</span> and I have been <span>meaning</span> to join for a while.<br/>
🎧 Oh, you should.<br/>
🎧 It doesn't <span>cost</span> anything,<br/>
🎧 and the new <span>library</span> has all <span>sorts</span> of <span>facilities</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's not just a place where you <span>borrow</span> books.<br/>
🎧 For <span>instance</span>, there's an <span>area</span> with <span>comfortable</span> <span>seats</span> where you can sit and read the <span>magazines</span> they have there.<br/>
🎧 Some people <span>spend</span> the whole morning there.<br/>
🎧 Wish I had that amount of time to <span>spend</span>!<br/>
🎧 Yes, you must be <span>pretty</span> <span>busy</span> at <span>present</span>, with the children and everything?<br/>
🎧 We are, yes.<br/>
🎧 But we're <span>hoping</span> to get away this <span>summer</span>.<br/>
🎧 We're thinking of going to <span>Greece</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, we've got a much <span>larger</span> <span>section</span> of the <span>library</span> <span>devoted</span> to travel books now,<br/>
🎧 so you should come and have a look.<br/>
🎧 I can't remember if there's anything <span>specifically</span> on <span>Greece</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I should think so.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Now <span>Carol's</span> <span>organising</span> a <span>project</span> for the <span>history</span> class she <span>teaches</span> at school,<br/>
🎧 it's about life in the <span>town</span> a <span>hundred</span> years ago.<br/>
🎧 Do you have anything that might be useful?<br/>
🎧 Yes, actually we've now got a new <span>section</span> with <span>materials</span> on the <span>history</span> of the <span>town</span> and <span>surrounding</span> <span>region</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right. I'll tell her.<br/>
🎧 You can't always find that <span>sort</span> of thing on the <span>internet</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now in the old <span>library</span> there used to be a <span>separate</span> room with <span>reference</span> books.<br/>
🎧 It was a really nice <span>quiet</span> room.<br/>
🎧 Yes. We've put those books in the <span>main</span> <span>part</span> of the <span>library</span> now,<br/>
🎧 but we do have a room called the <span>community</span> room.<br/>
🎧 It can be <span>hired</span> out for <span>meetings</span>,<br/>
🎧 but at other <span>times</span> people can use it to <span>study</span>.<br/>
🎧 I might use that.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>hard</span> to find <span>anywhere</span> <span>quiet</span> at home sometimes.<br/>
🎧 I can't remember how old your son and <span>daughter</span> <span>are…<br/></span>
🎧 we've <span>introduced</span> a special <span>section</span> of <span>fiction</span> <span>written</span> <span>specially</span> for <span>teenagers</span>,<br/>
🎧 but they might be a bit young for that?<br/>
🎧 Yes, they would be.<br/>
🎧 Well, we do have lots of <span>activities</span> for <span>younger</span> children.<br/>
🎧 Yes?<br/>
🎧 For example we have a <span>Science</span> <span>Club</span>.<br/>
🎧 At the next <span>meeting</span>, they're going to be doing <span>experiments</span> with <span>stuff</span> that everyone has in the <span>kitchen</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>sugar</span> and <span>flour</span> and so on.<br/>
🎧 They might be interested, yes.<br/>
🎧 And we have a <span>competition</span> for children called <span>Reading</span> <span>Challenge</span>.<br/>
🎧 That doesn't <span>begin</span> until after the end of <span>term</span>.<br/>
🎧 They have to read six books,<br/>
🎧 and they get a <span>certificate</span> if they <span>manage</span> it.<br/>
🎧 So that <span>gives</span> them something to do while they're on <span>holiday</span>, <span>instead</span> of getting <span>bored</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's the idea.<br/>
🎧 And there's special <span>activities</span> for <span>adults</span> too.<br/>
🎧 On <span>Friday</span> we have a <span>local</span> <span>author</span> called <span>Tanya</span> <span>Streep</span>,<br/>
🎧 who's going to be talking about her new <span>novel</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's called <span>'Catch</span> the <span>Mouse'<br/></span>
🎧 and she <span>based</span> the <span>story</span> on a <span>crime</span> that actually took place here years ago.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 We're not free on <span>Friday</span>, but I'll look out for the book.<br/>
🎧 Now this probably isn't for you,<br/>
🎧 but we do have IT <span>support</span> <span>available</span> for <span>members</span>.<br/>
🎧 We get quite a few <span>older</span> people <span>coming</span> <span>along<br/></span>
🎧 who are <span>wanting</span> to get up to <span>speed</span> with <span>computer</span> <span>technology</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's on <span>Tuesday</span> <span>mornings</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 they don't need to make an <span>appointment</span> or anything, they just <span>turn</span> up.<br/>
🎧 Well, my <span>mother</span> might be interested,<br/>
🎧 I'll let her know.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And there's another <span>service</span> which you wouldn't <span>expect</span> from a <span>library</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is a free <span>medical</span> <span>check-up</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>hospital</span> <span>arranges</span> for <span>someone</span> to come <span>along<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>measure</span> the <span>level</span> of <span>sugar</span> in your <span>blood</span>,<br/>
🎧 and they check <span>cholesterol</span> <span>levels</span> at the same time.<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 Yes, but that's only for the <span>over-60s</span>,<br/>
🎧 so you wouldn't <span>qualify</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'll tell my <span>mother</span>, she might be interested.<br/>
🎧 What other <span>information…<br/></span>
🎧 well, we do have a little <span>shop</span> with things like <span>wallcharts</span> and <span>greetings</span> <span>cards</span>,<br/>
🎧 and also <span>stamps</span> so you can <span>post</span> the <span>cards</span> <span>straightaway</span>, which is really useful.<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'll <span>bring</span> the children <span>round</span> at the weekend and we'll join.<br/>
🎧 Oh, one more thing <span>-</span> I'll be <span>bringing</span> the car, is there <span>parking</span> <span>available</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, and it's free in the <span>evening</span> and at <span>weekends</span>.<br/>
🎧 Perfect.<br/>
🎧 Well, thanks, <span>Susie..</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 In this <span>session</span> in your <span>training</span> day we're going to look at some of the more <span>specialised</span> <span>holidays</span> we <span>offer</span> at <span>BC</span> Travel.<br/>
🎧 Now, the travel <span>business</span> is very <span>competitive<br/></span>
🎧 and it's important to be <span>aware</span> of how the <span>market's</span> <span>changing</span> and <span>developing</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>terms</span> of age <span>groups</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>over-65s</span> are an important <span>market</span>,<br/>
🎧 and one that's <span>increasing</span> <span>steadily</span> year on year.<br/>
🎧 The <span>fewest</span> <span>holidays</span> are taken by the <span>31</span> to <span>42-year-olds</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that <span>figure</span> <span>shows</span> no <span>sign</span> of <span>rising</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>biggest</span> <span>market</span> at <span>present</span> is still the <span>youngest</span> group,<br/>
🎧 the <span>16</span> to <span>30s</span>,<br/>
🎧 but this <span>group's</span> also <span>seen</span> the <span>biggest</span> <span>drop</span> over the last few years,<br/>
🎧 <span>whereas</span> there's a <span>noticeable</span> <span>growth</span> in the number of <span>holidays</span> taken by the <span>55</span> to <span>64-year-olds</span>.<br/>
🎧 As <span>far</span> as the <span>43</span> to <span>54-year-olds</span> are <span>concerned</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>bookings</span> there are <span>steady</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I have to say we haven't <span>seen</span> the <span>increase</span> we <span>expected</span>.<br/>
🎧 One <span>trend</span> we're <span>noticing</span> with <span>nearly</span> all age <span>groups</span> is the <span>growing</span> <span>popularity</span> of <span>holidays<br/></span>
🎧 in which <span>clients</span> do some kind of <span>specialised</span> <span>activity</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm not talking here about <span>adventure</span> <span>holidays</span>,<br/>
🎧 where <span>clients</span> take <span>part</span> in <span>high-risk</span> <span>activities</span> like <span>white</span> water <span>rafting</span> just for the <span>thrill</span> of it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Activity</span> <span>holidays</span> usually <span>involve</span> rather less <span>high-risk</span> <span>sports</span>, or things like <span>art</span> and music.<br/>
🎧 They're not <span>necessarily</span> <span>cheaper</span> than <span>ordinary</span> <span>holidays</span>, often the <span>opposite</span>, in <span>fact</span>.<br/>
🎧 But they do often take place outside the <span>main</span> <span>tourist</span> <span>centres</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>gives</span> an <span>opportunity</span> for <span>clients</span> to find out more about the <span>local</span> people and <span>customs</span>,<br/>
🎧 and many say this is one of the most <span>positive</span> <span>features</span> of these <span>holidays</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course, they <span>offer</span> the <span>chance</span> to <span>develop</span> a new <span>skill</span> or <span>talent</span>,<br/>
🎧 but <span>clients</span> often say that more than this,<br/>
🎧 it's the <span>chance</span> to <span>create</span> <span>lasting</span> <span>relationships</span> with other <span>like-minded</span> people,<br/>
🎧 that's the <span>main</span> <span>draw</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let me give you some <span>examples</span> of <span>BC</span> Travel <span>activity</span> <span>holidays</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>painting</span> <span>holidays</span> take place in <span>four</span> different <span>centres</span> in <span>France</span> and <span>Italy<br/></span>
🎧 and they're very <span>popular</span> with <span>clients</span> of all <span>abilities</span> from <span>beginners</span> <span>onwards</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've got an <span>excellent</span> <span>team</span> of <span>artists</span> to <span>lead</span> the <span>classes</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 some of them have been with us from the start, and <span>five</span> <span>additional</span> <span>ones</span> will be <span>joining</span> us this <span>year<br/></span>
🎧 so that we can <span>offer</span> a <span>greater</span> number of <span>classes</span> in each <span>centre</span>.<br/>
🎧 As <span>far</span> as cooking <span>holidays</span> are <span>concerned</span>,<br/>
🎧 I know a lot of <span>agents</span> <span>offer</span> <span>holidays</span> where <span>clients</span> <span>cook</span> <span>recipes</span> <span>related</span> to one <span>particular</span> <span>country</span>,<br/>
🎧 usually the one they're <span>staying</span> in, but we focus on <span>dishes</span> from a great many different <span>ones</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Apart</span> from that you'll find the <span>usual</span> <span>emphasis</span> on good <span>quality</span>, <span>organic</span> <span>ingredients</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 that's more or less a <span>given</span> <span>nowadays</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and there are <span>generally</span> some <span>meat-free</span> <span>recipes</span> <span>included</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>photography</span> <span>holidays</span> take place in a <span>wide</span> <span>range</span> of <span>countries</span> from <span>Iceland</span> to <span>Vietnam</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>clients</span> have the <span>opportunity</span> to see some <span>stunning</span> <span>scenery</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Groups</span> are small, no more than <span>eight</span>,<br/>
🎧 so <span>clients</span> can have <span>one-on-one</span> <span>tuition</span> during the <span>holiday</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>excursions</span> are <span>arranged</span> with <span>fully-trained</span> <span>guides</span>.<br/>
🎧 At the end of each <span>holiday</span> an <span>exhibition</span> is <span>held</span> of the <span>photographs</span> <span>taken<br/></span>
🎧 so that <span>clients</span> can see one <span>another's</span> work and <span>receive</span> <span>valuable</span> <span>feedback</span> from the <span>tutor</span>.<br/>
🎧 Finally, let me tell you about our <span>fitness</span> <span>holidays</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>Ireland</span> and <span>Italy</span> we run <span>one-week</span> <span>general</span> <span>fitness</span> <span>classes</span> for all <span>ages</span> and <span>levels</span> of <span>fitness</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Clients</span> start the course with a <span>consultation</span> with a <span>trainer</span>,<br/>
🎧 and together they <span>draw</span> up an <span>individual</span> <span>programme</span>.<br/>
🎧 As well as <span>improving</span> <span>general</span> <span>fitness</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>clients</span> find that they end up <span>losing</span> much of the <span>stress</span> <span>they've</span> <span>built</span> up in their <span>daily</span> lives.<br/>
🎧 In <span>Greece</span>, we have a <span>two-week</span> <span>holiday</span> for <span>clients</span> who want to do something about their <span>weight</span>.<br/>
🎧 This has all the <span>features</span> you'd <span>expect</span>, like a <span>personalised</span> <span>diet</span> <span>programme</span>,<br/>
🎧 but one of its most <span>popular</span> <span>features</span> is that the <span>exercise</span> <span>classes</span> are all <span>held</span> on the <span>beach</span>.<br/>
🎧 People say it's <span>far</span> <span>preferable</span> to being in a gym.<br/>
🎧 Finally, we <span>offer</span> <span>several</span> <span>holidays</span> in <span>Morocco</span>.<br/>
🎧 One very <span>popular</span> one is the <span>mountain</span> <span>biking</span> <span>holiday</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Bikes</span> are <span>provided</span> and there are different <span>routes</span> <span>according</span> to <span>people's</span> <span>ability</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>offer</span> one which is <span>tailored</span> to the needs of <span>families</span>, which is <span>particularly</span> <span>popular</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, so that's about all the time I have today, <span>so..</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 <span>Dave</span>, I'm <span>worried</span> about our case <span>study</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've done a bit of <span>reading</span>, but I'm not sure what's <span>involved</span> in actually <span>writing</span> a case <span>study</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>missed</span> the <span>lecture</span> where <span>Dr</span> <span>Baker</span> <span>talked</span> us through it.<br/>
🎧 OK, well it's quite <span>straightforward</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've got our focus <span>-</span> that's <span>tourism</span> at the <span>Horton</span> <span>Castle</span> <span>site</span>.<br/>
🎧 And you said you'd done some <span>reading</span> about it.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I <span>found</span> some <span>articles</span> and made <span>notes</span> of the <span>main</span> <span>points</span>.<br/>
🎧 Did you remember to keep a <span>record</span> of where you got the <span>information</span> from?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 I know what a <span>pain</span> it is when you <span>forget</span> that.<br/>
🎧 OK, so we can <span>compare</span> what we've read.<br/>
🎧 Then we have to decide on a <span>particular</span> <span>problem</span> or need at our <span>site</span>.<br/>
🎧 And then think about who we're going to <span>interview</span> to get more <span>information</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So who'd that be?<br/>
🎧 The people who work there?<br/>
🎧 And <span>presumably</span> some of the <span>tourists</span> too?<br/>
🎧 Yes, both those <span>groups</span>.<br/>
🎧 So we'll have to go to the <span>site</span> to do that, I <span>suppose</span>.<br/>
🎧 But we might also do some of our <span>interviewing</span> away from the <span>site</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 we could even <span>contact</span> some people here in the <span>city</span>,<br/>
🎧 like <span>administrators</span> <span>involved</span> in <span>overseeing</span> <span>tourism</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK. So we'll need to think about our <span>interview</span> <span>questions</span> <span>and..</span>.<br/>
🎧 fix <span>times</span> and <span>places</span> for the <span>meetings</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's all going to take a lot of time.<br/>
🎧 And if we can, we should ask our <span>interviewees</span> if they can <span>bring</span> along some <span>numerical</span> <span>data<br/></span>
🎧 that we can add to <span>support</span> our <span>findings</span>.<br/>
🎧 And <span>photographs</span>?<br/>
🎧 I think we have <span>plenty</span> of those already.<br/>
🎧 But <span>Dr</span> <span>Baker</span> also <span>said<br/></span>
🎧 we have to <span>establish</span> with our <span>interviewees</span> <span>whether</span> we can <span>identify</span> them in our case <span>study</span>,<br/>
🎧 or <span>whether</span> they want to be <span>anonymous</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I wouldn't have thought of that.<br/>
🎧 OK, once we've got all this <span>information</span>, I <span>suppose</span> we have to <span>analyse</span> it.<br/>
🎧 Yes, put it all together and choose what's <span>relevant</span> to the <span>problem</span> we're <span>focusing</span> on,<br/>
🎧 and <span>analyse</span> that <span>carefully</span> to find out if we can <span>identify</span> any <span>trends</span> or <span>regularities</span> there.<br/>
🎧 That's the <span>main</span> thing at this <span>stage</span>, rather than <span>concentrating</span> on <span>details</span> or lots of <span>facts</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK. And then once we've <span>analysed</span> that, what next?<br/>
🎧 Well, then we need to think about what we do with the <span>data</span> we've <span>selected<br/></span>
🎧 to make it as <span>clear</span> as <span>possible</span> to our <span>readers</span>.<br/>
🎧 Things like <span>graphs</span>, or <span>tables</span>, or <span>charts</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Then the case <span>study</span> <span>itself</span> is <span>mostly</span> quite <span>standard;<br/></span>
🎧 we <span>begin</span> by <span>presenting</span> the <span>problem</span>, and <span>giving</span> some <span>background</span>,<br/>
🎧 then go through the <span>main</span> <span>sections</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the thing that <span>surprised</span> me is that in a <span>normal</span> <span>report<br/></span>
🎧 we'd end with some <span>suggestions</span> to <span>deal</span> with the <span>problem</span> or need we <span>identified</span>,<br/>
🎧 but in a case <span>study</span> we end up with a <span>question</span> or a <span>series</span> of <span>questions</span> to our <span>readers</span>,<br/>
🎧 and they decide what <span>ought</span> to be done.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I hadn't <span>realised</span> that.<br/>
🎧 So <span>basically</span>, the <span>problem</span> we're <span>addressing</span> in our case <span>study</span> of the <span>Horton</span> <span>Castle</span> <span>site<br/></span>
🎧 is why so few <span>tourists</span> are <span>visiting</span> it.<br/>
🎧 And we'll find out more from our <span>interviews</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I did find one <span>report</span> on the <span>internet</span> that <span>suggested</span> that one <span>reason</span> might be <span>because..</span>.<br/>
🎧 as <span>far</span> as <span>transport</span> <span>goes</span>, <span>access</span> is <span>difficult</span>.<br/>
🎧 I read that too, but that <span>report</span> was actually <span>written</span> ten years ago,<br/>
🎧 when the <span>road</span> there was really bad, but that's been <span>improved</span> now.<br/>
🎧 And I think there's <span>plenty</span> of <span>fascinating</span> <span>stuff</span> there for a really good day out,<br/>
🎧 but you'd never <span>realise</span> it from the <span>castle</span> <span>website</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 maybe that's the <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's really dry and <span>boring</span>.<br/>
🎧 I read somewhere a <span>suggestion</span> that what the <span>castle</span> needs is a <span>visitor</span> <span>centre</span>.<br/>
🎧 So we could have a look for some <span>information</span> about that on the <span>internet</span>.<br/>
🎧 What would we need to know?<br/>
🎧 Well, who'd use it for a start.<br/>
🎧 It'd be good to know what <span>categories</span> the <span>visitors</span> <span>fell</span> into too,<br/>
🎧 like school <span>parties</span> or <span>retired</span> people,<br/>
🎧 but I think we'd have to talk to <span>staff</span> to get that <span>information</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK. And as we're thinking of <span>suggesting</span> a <span>visitor</span> <span>centre<br/></span>
🎧 we'd also have to look at <span>potential</span> <span>problems</span>.<br/>
🎧 I mean, <span>obviously</span> it wouldn't be <span>cheap</span> to set up.<br/>
🎧 No, but it could be a really good <span>investment</span>.<br/>
🎧 And as it's on a <span>historical</span> <span>site</span> it'd need to get special planning <span>permission</span>, I <span>expect</span>.<br/>
🎧 That might be <span>hard</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, <span>especially</span> as the only <span>possible</span> place for it would be at the <span>entrance</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that's right in <span>front</span> of the <span>castle</span>.<br/>
🎧 But it could be a good thing for the <span>town</span> of <span>Horton</span>.<br/>
🎧 At <span>present</span> it's a bit of a <span>ghost</span> <span>town</span>.<br/>
🎧 Once <span>they've</span> <span>left</span> school and got any <span>skills</span> or <span>qualifications</span>,<br/>
🎧 the young people all get out as <span>fast</span> as they can to get <span>jobs</span> in the <span>city</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the only people <span>left</span> are children and those who've <span>retired</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Something else we could <span>investigate</span> would be the <span>potential</span> <span>damage</span> that <span>tourists</span> might <span>cause</span> to the <span>castle</span> <span>site</span>,<br/>
🎧 I mean their <span>environmental</span> <span>impact</span>.<br/>
🎧 At <span>present</span> the <span>tourists</span> can just <span>wander</span> <span>round</span> <span>wherever</span> they want,<br/>
🎧 but if <span>numbers</span> <span>increase</span>, there might have to be some <span>restrictions</span>, like <span>sticking</span> to <span>marked</span> <span>ways</span>.<br/>
🎧 And <span>there'd</span> need to be <span>guides</span> and <span>wardens</span> around to make sure these were <span>enforced</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, we could look at that too.<br/>
🎧 OK, <span>well…<br/>

🎧 OK, so we've been looking at how <span>man-made</span> changes in our <span>environment</span> can <span>affect</span> <span>wildlife</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now I'll <span>discuss</span> a <span>particular</span> example.<br/>
🎧 Let's take a look at <span>mercury</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mercury's</span> one of the <span>120</span> or so <span>elements</span> that make up all <span>matter</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it has the <span>symbol</span> <span>Hg</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>shiny</span>, <span>silvery</span> <span>substance</span>.<br/>
🎧 You may have <span>seen</span> it in <span>old-fashioned</span> <span>thermometers</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it's not used much for <span>domestic</span> <span>purposes</span> <span>now<br/></span>
🎧 because it's <span>highly</span> <span>toxic</span>.<br/>
🎧 But the <span>problem</span> is that the amount of <span>mercury</span> in the <span>environment's</span> <span>increasing</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>main</span> <span>reason</span> for this is the <span>power</span> <span>plants</span> used to <span>produce</span> <span>electricity</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>main</span> <span>source</span> of <span>energy</span> that most of them use is still <span>coal</span>,<br/>
🎧 and when it's <span>burned</span> it <span>releases</span> <span>mercury</span> into the <span>atmosphere</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some of this <span>gets</span> <span>deposited</span> into <span>lakes</span> and <span>rivers</span>,<br/>
🎧 and if it's <span>ingested</span> by a <span>fish</span> it's not <span>excreted</span>,<br/>
🎧 it <span>stays</span> in the <span>fish's</span> <span>body</span> and it <span>enters</span> the food <span>chain</span>.<br/>
🎧 So it's been <span>known</span> for some time that <span>birds</span> which eat <span>fish</span> may be <span>affected</span>,<br/>
🎧 but what wasn't <span>known</span> until quite <span>recently</span> is that those that eat <span>insects</span> can also be <span>affected</span>.<br/>
🎧 So a <span>woman</span> called <span>Claire</span> <span>Varian-Ramos</span> is doing some <span>research</span> on how this is <span>affecting</span> <span>birds</span>.<br/>
🎧 And rather than looking at how many <span>birds</span> are actually <span>killed</span> by <span>mercury</span> <span>poisoning</span>,<br/>
🎧 she's looking for more <span>subtle</span> <span>sub-effects</span>.<br/>
🎧 And these may be to do with the <span>behaviour</span> of the <span>birds</span>,<br/>
🎧 or with the <span>effect</span> of <span>mercury</span> on the way their <span>brain</span> <span>works</span>,<br/>
🎧 so <span>whether</span> it <span>leads</span> to <span>problems</span> with <span>memory</span>, for example.<br/>
🎧 And she's <span>particularly</span> <span>focusing</span> on the <span>effects</span> of <span>mercury</span> on <span>bird</span> <span>song</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, the <span>process</span> of <span>song</span> <span>learning</span> <span>happens</span> at a <span>particular</span> <span>stage</span> in the <span>birds'</span> <span>development</span>,<br/>
🎧 and what you may not <span>know<br/></span>
🎧 is that a young <span>bird</span> <span>seems</span> to <span>acquire</span> this <span>skill</span> by <span>listening</span> to the <span>songs</span> <span>produced</span> by its <span>father</span>,<br/>
🎧 rather than by any other <span>bird</span>.<br/>
🎧 And <span>Varian-Ramos</span> has already <span>found</span> in her <span>research<br/></span>
🎧 that if young <span>male</span> <span>birds</span> are <span>exposed</span> to <span>mercury</span>,<br/>
🎧 if they eat food <span>contaminated</span> with <span>mercury</span>,<br/>
🎧 then the <span>songs</span> they <span>produce</span> aren't as <span>complex</span> as those <span>produced</span> by other <span>birds</span>.<br/>
🎧 So quite <span>low-level</span> <span>exposure</span> to <span>mercury</span> is <span>likely</span> to have an <span>impact</span> on <span>male</span> <span>birds</span> in a <span>natural</span> <span>situation</span>,<br/>
🎧 because it can mean that they're less <span>attractive</span> to <span>female</span> <span>birds</span>,<br/>
🎧 and so it can <span>affect</span> their <span>chances</span> of <span>reproduction</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now the way she's <span>carrying</span> out this <span>research</span> is <span>worth</span> thinking about.<br/>
🎧 She's <span>using</span> a <span>mixture</span> of <span>studies</span> <span>using</span> <span>birds</span> <span>kept</span> in <span>laboratories</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>studies</span> <span>carried</span> out <span>outdoors</span> in the <span>wild</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>lab-based</span> <span>studies</span> have the <span>advantage</span> that you don't get all the <span>variables</span> you would in a <span>natural</span> <span>setting</span>,<br/>
🎧 so the <span>experimenter</span> has a much <span>higher</span> <span>level</span> of <span>control</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that <span>means</span> they can be more <span>confident</span> about their <span>results</span> in some <span>ways</span>.<br/>
🎧 And of course they don't have to <span>worry</span> about going out and <span>finding</span> the <span>birds</span> in order to <span>observe</span> them.<br/>
🎧 So what are the <span>implications</span> here for <span>humans</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, because many <span>birds</span> are <span>migratory</span>,<br/>
🎧 they may be <span>transporting</span> <span>mercury</span> <span>far</span> from <span>contaminated</span> <span>sites</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, it's been <span>found</span> that <span>ducks</span> who'd been <span>feeding</span> at a <span>contaminated</span> <span>site<br/></span>
🎧 were later <span>shot</span> by <span>hunters</span> over a <span>thousand</span> <span>kilometres</span> away,<br/>
🎧 and <span>presumably</span> <span>eaten</span>.<br/>
🎧 But these <span>birds</span> <span>likely</span> had <span>mercury</span> <span>levels</span> high enough to <span>warrant</span> <span>concern</span> for <span>human</span> <span>consumption</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>addition</span>, going back to <span>song</span> <span>learning</span> by <span>birds</span>,<br/>
🎧 we saw that this may be <span>affected</span> by <span>mercury</span> <span>contamination</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, we also know that in <span>humans</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>mercury</span> <span>causes</span> <span>developmental</span> <span>delays</span> in the <span>acquisition</span> of <span>language</span>,<br/>
🎧 and in <span>fact</span> this <span>process</span> is very <span>similar</span> in the <span>brain</span> <span>regions</span> it <span>involves<br/></span>
🎧 and even the <span>genes</span> that are <span>involved</span>.<br/>
🎧 But <span>mercury</span> <span>contamination</span> has other important <span>implications</span> for <span>humans</span> as well.<br/>
🎧 It's now <span>known</span> that an <span>unborn</span> <span>child</span> can be <span>affected<br/></span>
🎧 if the food <span>eaten</span> by its <span>mother</span> <span>contains</span> high <span>levels</span> of <span>mercury</span>,<br/>
🎧 and these <span>effects</span> can be quite <span>substantial</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the end, it comes down to <span>whether</span> more <span>value</span> is <span>placed</span> on <span>human</span> <span>economic</span> <span>wellbeing</span> or <span>environmental</span> <span>wellbeing</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>true</span> there are new <span>regulations</span> for <span>mercury</span> <span>emissions</span> from <span>power</span> <span>plants</span>,<br/>
🎧 but these will need <span>billions</span> of <span>dollars</span> to <span>implement</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>increase</span> <span>costs</span> for everyone.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>argue</span> that's too much to pay to <span>protect</span> <span>wildlife</span>.<br/>
🎧 But as we've <span>seen</span>, the issues go <span>beyond</span> that,<br/>
🎧 and I think it's an issue we need to <span>consider</span> very <span>carefully</span>.<br/>
