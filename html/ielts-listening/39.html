🎧 Hello?<br/>
🎧 Hi, <span>Susie, it's <span>Paul here.<br/>
🎧 How are you?<br/>
🎧 <span>Enjoying your new <span>job?<br/>
🎧 You're working at the <span>library, aren't you?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 I <span>started when the <span>library <span>re-opened a month ago.<br/>
🎧 It's great.<br/>
🎧 Actually <span>Carol and I have been <span>meaning to join for a while.<br/>
🎧 Oh, you should.<br/>
🎧 It doesn't <span>cost anything,<br/>
🎧 and the new <span>library has all <span>sorts of <span>facilities.<br/>
🎧 It's not just a place where you <span>borrow books.<br/>
🎧 For <span>instance, there's an <span>area with <span>comfortable <span>seats where you can sit and read the <span>magazines they have there.<br/>
🎧 Some people <span>spend the whole morning there.<br/>
🎧 Wish I had that amount of time to <span>spend!<br/>
🎧 Yes, you must be <span>pretty <span>busy at <span>present, with the children and everything?<br/>
🎧 We are, yes.<br/>
🎧 But we're <span>hoping to get away this <span>summer.<br/>
🎧 We're thinking of going to <span>Greece.<br/>
🎧 Well, we've got a much <span>larger <span>section of the <span>library <span>devoted to travel books now,<br/>
🎧 so you should come and have a look.<br/>
🎧 I can't remember if there's anything <span>specifically on <span>Greece,<br/>
🎧 but I should think so.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Now <span>Carol's <span>organising a <span>project for the <span>history class she <span>teaches at school,<br/>
🎧 it's about life in the <span>town a <span>hundred years ago.<br/>
🎧 Do you have anything that might be useful?<br/>
🎧 Yes, actually we've now got a new <span>section with <span>materials on the <span>history of the <span>town and <span>surrounding <span>region.<br/>
🎧 Right. I'll tell her.<br/>
🎧 You can't always find that <span>sort of thing on the <span>internet.<br/>
🎧 Now in the old <span>library there used to be a <span>separate room with <span>reference books.<br/>
🎧 It was a really nice <span>quiet room.<br/>
🎧 Yes. We've put those books in the <span>main <span>part of the <span>library now,<br/>
🎧 but we do have a room called the <span>community room.<br/>
🎧 It can be <span>hired out for <span>meetings,<br/>
🎧 but at other <span>times people can use it to <span>study.<br/>
🎧 I might use that.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>hard to find <span>anywhere <span>quiet at home sometimes.<br/>
🎧 I can't remember how old your son and <span>daughter <span>are…<br/>
🎧 we've <span>introduced a special <span>section of <span>fiction <span>written <span>specially for <span>teenagers,<br/>
🎧 but they might be a bit young for that?<br/>
🎧 Yes, they would be.<br/>
🎧 Well, we do have lots of <span>activities for <span>younger children.<br/>
🎧 Yes?<br/>
🎧 For example we have a <span>Science <span>Club.<br/>
🎧 At the next <span>meeting, they're going to be doing <span>experiments with <span>stuff that everyone has in the <span>kitchen <span>-<br/>
🎧 <span>sugar and <span>flour and so on.<br/>
🎧 They might be interested, yes.<br/>
🎧 And we have a <span>competition for children called <span>Reading <span>Challenge.<br/>
🎧 That doesn't <span>begin until after the end of <span>term.<br/>
🎧 They have to read six books,<br/>
🎧 and they get a <span>certificate if they <span>manage it.<br/>
🎧 So that <span>gives them something to do while they're on <span>holiday, <span>instead of getting <span>bored.<br/>
🎧 That's the idea.<br/>
🎧 And there's special <span>activities for <span>adults too.<br/>
🎧 On <span>Friday we have a <span>local <span>author called <span>Tanya <span>Streep,<br/>
🎧 who's going to be talking about her new <span>novel.<br/>
🎧 It's called <span>'Catch the <span>Mouse'<br/>
🎧 and she <span>based the <span>story on a <span>crime that actually took place here years ago.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 We're not free on <span>Friday, but I'll look out for the book.<br/>
🎧 Now this probably isn't for you,<br/>
🎧 but we do have IT <span>support <span>available for <span>members.<br/>
🎧 We get quite a few <span>older people <span>coming <span>along<br/>
🎧 who are <span>wanting to get up to <span>speed with <span>computer <span>technology.<br/>
🎧 It's on <span>Tuesday <span>mornings <span>-<br/>
🎧 they don't need to make an <span>appointment or anything, they just <span>turn up.<br/>
🎧 Well, my <span>mother might be interested,<br/>
🎧 I'll let her know.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And there's another <span>service which you wouldn't <span>expect from a <span>library,<br/>
🎧 which is a free <span>medical <span>check-up.<br/>
🎧 The <span>hospital <span>arranges for <span>someone to come <span>along<br/>
🎧 and <span>measure the <span>level of <span>sugar in your <span>blood,<br/>
🎧 and they check <span>cholesterol <span>levels at the same time.<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 Yes, but that's only for the <span>over-60s,<br/>
🎧 so you wouldn't <span>qualify.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'll tell my <span>mother, she might be interested.<br/>
🎧 What other <span>information…<br/>
🎧 well, we do have a little <span>shop with things like <span>wallcharts and <span>greetings <span>cards,<br/>
🎧 and also <span>stamps so you can <span>post the <span>cards <span>straightaway, which is really useful.<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'll <span>bring the children <span>round at the weekend and we'll join.<br/>
🎧 Oh, one more thing <span>- I'll be <span>bringing the car, is there <span>parking <span>available?<br/>
🎧 Yes, and it's free in the <span>evening and at <span>weekends.<br/>
🎧 Perfect.<br/>
🎧 Well, thanks, <span>Susie...<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 In this <span>session in your <span>training day we're going to look at some of the more <span>specialised <span>holidays we <span>offer at <span>BC Travel.<br/>
🎧 Now, the travel <span>business is very <span>competitive<br/>
🎧 and it's important to be <span>aware of how the <span>market's <span>changing and <span>developing.<br/>
🎧 In <span>terms of age <span>groups,<br/>
🎧 the <span>over-65s are an important <span>market,<br/>
🎧 and one that's <span>increasing <span>steadily year on year.<br/>
🎧 The <span>fewest <span>holidays are taken by the <span>31 to <span>42-year-olds,<br/>
🎧 and that <span>figure <span>shows no <span>sign of <span>rising.<br/>
🎧 The <span>biggest <span>market at <span>present is still the <span>youngest group,<br/>
🎧 the <span>16 to <span>30s,<br/>
🎧 but this <span>group's also <span>seen the <span>biggest <span>drop over the last few years,<br/>
🎧 <span>whereas there's a <span>noticeable <span>growth in the number of <span>holidays taken by the <span>55 to <span>64-year-olds.<br/>
🎧 As <span>far as the <span>43 to <span>54-year-olds are <span>concerned,<br/>
🎧 <span>bookings there are <span>steady,<br/>
🎧 but I have to say we haven't <span>seen the <span>increase we <span>expected.<br/>
🎧 One <span>trend we're <span>noticing with <span>nearly all age <span>groups is the <span>growing <span>popularity of <span>holidays<br/>
🎧 in which <span>clients do some kind of <span>specialised <span>activity.<br/>
🎧 I'm not talking here about <span>adventure <span>holidays,<br/>
🎧 where <span>clients take <span>part in <span>high-risk <span>activities like <span>white water <span>rafting just for the <span>thrill of it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Activity <span>holidays usually <span>involve rather less <span>high-risk <span>sports, or things like <span>art and music.<br/>
🎧 They're not <span>necessarily <span>cheaper than <span>ordinary <span>holidays, often the <span>opposite, in <span>fact.<br/>
🎧 But they do often take place outside the <span>main <span>tourist <span>centres,<br/>
🎧 which <span>gives an <span>opportunity for <span>clients to find out more about the <span>local people and <span>customs,<br/>
🎧 and many say this is one of the most <span>positive <span>features of these <span>holidays.<br/>
🎧 Of course, they <span>offer the <span>chance to <span>develop a new <span>skill or <span>talent,<br/>
🎧 but <span>clients often say that more than this,<br/>
🎧 it's the <span>chance to <span>create <span>lasting <span>relationships with other <span>like-minded people,<br/>
🎧 that's the <span>main <span>draw.<br/>
🎧 Let me give you some <span>examples of <span>BC Travel <span>activity <span>holidays.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>painting <span>holidays take place in <span>four different <span>centres in <span>France and <span>Italy<br/>
🎧 and they're very <span>popular with <span>clients of all <span>abilities from <span>beginners <span>onwards.<br/>
🎧 We've got an <span>excellent <span>team of <span>artists to <span>lead the <span>classes <span>-<br/>
🎧 some of them have been with us from the start, and <span>five <span>additional <span>ones will be <span>joining us this <span>year<br/>
🎧 so that we can <span>offer a <span>greater number of <span>classes in each <span>centre.<br/>
🎧 As <span>far as cooking <span>holidays are <span>concerned,<br/>
🎧 I know a lot of <span>agents <span>offer <span>holidays where <span>clients <span>cook <span>recipes <span>related to one <span>particular <span>country,<br/>
🎧 usually the one they're <span>staying in, but we focus on <span>dishes from a great many different <span>ones.<br/>
🎧 <span>Apart from that you'll find the <span>usual <span>emphasis on good <span>quality, <span>organic <span>ingredients <span>-<br/>
🎧 that's more or less a <span>given <span>nowadays <span>-<br/>
🎧 and there are <span>generally some <span>meat-free <span>recipes <span>included.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>photography <span>holidays take place in a <span>wide <span>range of <span>countries from <span>Iceland to <span>Vietnam,<br/>
🎧 and <span>clients have the <span>opportunity to see some <span>stunning <span>scenery.<br/>
🎧 <span>Groups are small, no more than <span>eight,<br/>
🎧 so <span>clients can have <span>one-on-one <span>tuition during the <span>holiday,<br/>
🎧 and <span>excursions are <span>arranged with <span>fully-trained <span>guides.<br/>
🎧 At the end of each <span>holiday an <span>exhibition is <span>held of the <span>photographs <span>taken<br/>
🎧 so that <span>clients can see one <span>another's work and <span>receive <span>valuable <span>feedback from the <span>tutor.<br/>
🎧 Finally, let me tell you about our <span>fitness <span>holidays.<br/>
🎧 In <span>Ireland and <span>Italy we run <span>one-week <span>general <span>fitness <span>classes for all <span>ages and <span>levels of <span>fitness.<br/>
🎧 <span>Clients start the course with a <span>consultation with a <span>trainer,<br/>
🎧 and together they <span>draw up an <span>individual <span>programme.<br/>
🎧 As well as <span>improving <span>general <span>fitness,<br/>
🎧 <span>clients find that they end up <span>losing much of the <span>stress <span>they've <span>built up in their <span>daily lives.<br/>
🎧 In <span>Greece, we have a <span>two-week <span>holiday for <span>clients who want to do something about their <span>weight.<br/>
🎧 This has all the <span>features you'd <span>expect, like a <span>personalised <span>diet <span>programme,<br/>
🎧 but one of its most <span>popular <span>features is that the <span>exercise <span>classes are all <span>held on the <span>beach.<br/>
🎧 People say it's <span>far <span>preferable to being in a gym.<br/>
🎧 Finally, we <span>offer <span>several <span>holidays in <span>Morocco.<br/>
🎧 One very <span>popular one is the <span>mountain <span>biking <span>holiday.<br/>
🎧 <span>Bikes are <span>provided and there are different <span>routes <span>according to <span>people's <span>ability.<br/>
🎧 We <span>offer one which is <span>tailored to the needs of <span>families, which is <span>particularly <span>popular.<br/>
🎧 OK, so that's about all the time I have today, <span>so...<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 <span>Dave, I'm <span>worried about our case <span>study.<br/>
🎧 I've done a bit of <span>reading, but I'm not sure what's <span>involved in actually <span>writing a case <span>study.<br/>
🎧 I <span>missed the <span>lecture where <span>Dr <span>Baker <span>talked us through it.<br/>
🎧 OK, well it's quite <span>straightforward.<br/>
🎧 We've got our focus <span>- that's <span>tourism at the <span>Horton <span>Castle <span>site.<br/>
🎧 And you said you'd done some <span>reading about it.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I <span>found some <span>articles and made <span>notes of the <span>main <span>points.<br/>
🎧 Did you remember to keep a <span>record of where you got the <span>information from?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 I know what a <span>pain it is when you <span>forget that.<br/>
🎧 OK, so we can <span>compare what we've read.<br/>
🎧 Then we have to decide on a <span>particular <span>problem or need at our <span>site.<br/>
🎧 And then think about who we're going to <span>interview to get more <span>information.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So who'd that be?<br/>
🎧 The people who work there?<br/>
🎧 And <span>presumably some of the <span>tourists too?<br/>
🎧 Yes, both those <span>groups.<br/>
🎧 So we'll have to go to the <span>site to do that, I <span>suppose.<br/>
🎧 But we might also do some of our <span>interviewing away from the <span>site <span>-<br/>
🎧 we could even <span>contact some people here in the <span>city,<br/>
🎧 like <span>administrators <span>involved in <span>overseeing <span>tourism.<br/>
🎧 OK. So we'll need to think about our <span>interview <span>questions <span>and...<br/>
🎧 fix <span>times and <span>places for the <span>meetings.<br/>
🎧 It's all going to take a lot of time.<br/>
🎧 And if we can, we should ask our <span>interviewees if they can <span>bring along some <span>numerical <span>data<br/>
🎧 that we can add to <span>support our <span>findings.<br/>
🎧 And <span>photographs?<br/>
🎧 I think we have <span>plenty of those already.<br/>
🎧 But <span>Dr <span>Baker also <span>said<br/>
🎧 we have to <span>establish with our <span>interviewees <span>whether we can <span>identify them in our case <span>study,<br/>
🎧 or <span>whether they want to be <span>anonymous.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I wouldn't have thought of that.<br/>
🎧 OK, once we've got all this <span>information, I <span>suppose we have to <span>analyse it.<br/>
🎧 Yes, put it all together and choose what's <span>relevant to the <span>problem we're <span>focusing on,<br/>
🎧 and <span>analyse that <span>carefully to find out if we can <span>identify any <span>trends or <span>regularities there.<br/>
🎧 That's the <span>main thing at this <span>stage, rather than <span>concentrating on <span>details or lots of <span>facts.<br/>
🎧 OK. And then once we've <span>analysed that, what next?<br/>
🎧 Well, then we need to think about what we do with the <span>data we've <span>selected<br/>
🎧 to make it as <span>clear as <span>possible to our <span>readers.<br/>
🎧 Things like <span>graphs, or <span>tables, or <span>charts.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Then the case <span>study <span>itself is <span>mostly quite <span>standard;<br/>
🎧 we <span>begin by <span>presenting the <span>problem, and <span>giving some <span>background,<br/>
🎧 then go through the <span>main <span>sections,<br/>
🎧 but the thing that <span>surprised me is that in a <span>normal <span>report<br/>
🎧 we'd end with some <span>suggestions to <span>deal with the <span>problem or need we <span>identified,<br/>
🎧 but in a case <span>study we end up with a <span>question or a <span>series of <span>questions to our <span>readers,<br/>
🎧 and they decide what <span>ought to be done.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I hadn't <span>realised that.<br/>
🎧 So <span>basically, the <span>problem we're <span>addressing in our case <span>study of the <span>Horton <span>Castle <span>site<br/>
🎧 is why so few <span>tourists are <span>visiting it.<br/>
🎧 And we'll find out more from our <span>interviews,<br/>
🎧 but I did find one <span>report on the <span>internet that <span>suggested that one <span>reason might be <span>because...<br/>
🎧 as <span>far as <span>transport <span>goes, <span>access is <span>difficult.<br/>
🎧 I read that too, but that <span>report was actually <span>written ten years ago,<br/>
🎧 when the <span>road there was really bad, but that's been <span>improved now.<br/>
🎧 And I think there's <span>plenty of <span>fascinating <span>stuff there for a really good day out,<br/>
🎧 but you'd never <span>realise it from the <span>castle <span>website <span>-<br/>
🎧 maybe that's the <span>problem.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's really dry and <span>boring.<br/>
🎧 I read somewhere a <span>suggestion that what the <span>castle needs is a <span>visitor <span>centre.<br/>
🎧 So we could have a look for some <span>information about that on the <span>internet.<br/>
🎧 What would we need to know?<br/>
🎧 Well, who'd use it for a start.<br/>
🎧 It'd be good to know what <span>categories the <span>visitors <span>fell into too,<br/>
🎧 like school <span>parties or <span>retired people,<br/>
🎧 but I think we'd have to talk to <span>staff to get that <span>information.<br/>
🎧 OK. And as we're thinking of <span>suggesting a <span>visitor <span>centre<br/>
🎧 we'd also have to look at <span>potential <span>problems.<br/>
🎧 I mean, <span>obviously it wouldn't be <span>cheap to set up.<br/>
🎧 No, but it could be a really good <span>investment.<br/>
🎧 And as it's on a <span>historical <span>site it'd need to get special planning <span>permission, I <span>expect.<br/>
🎧 That might be <span>hard.<br/>
🎧 Right, <span>especially as the only <span>possible place for it would be at the <span>entrance,<br/>
🎧 and that's right in <span>front of the <span>castle.<br/>
🎧 But it could be a good thing for the <span>town of <span>Horton.<br/>
🎧 At <span>present it's a bit of a <span>ghost <span>town.<br/>
🎧 Once <span>they've <span>left school and got any <span>skills or <span>qualifications,<br/>
🎧 the young people all get out as <span>fast as they can to get <span>jobs in the <span>city,<br/>
🎧 and the only people <span>left are children and those who've <span>retired.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Something else we could <span>investigate would be the <span>potential <span>damage that <span>tourists might <span>cause to the <span>castle <span>site,<br/>
🎧 I mean their <span>environmental <span>impact.<br/>
🎧 At <span>present the <span>tourists can just <span>wander <span>round <span>wherever they want,<br/>
🎧 but if <span>numbers <span>increase, there might have to be some <span>restrictions, like <span>sticking to <span>marked <span>ways.<br/>
🎧 And <span>there'd need to be <span>guides and <span>wardens around to make sure these were <span>enforced.<br/>
🎧 Yes, we could look at that too.<br/>
🎧 OK, <span>well…<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 OK, so we've been looking at how <span>man-made changes in our <span>environment can <span>affect <span>wildlife.<br/>
🎧 Now I'll <span>discuss a <span>particular example.<br/>
🎧 Let's take a look at <span>mercury.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mercury's one of the <span>120 or so <span>elements that make up all <span>matter,<br/>
🎧 and it has the <span>symbol <span>Hg.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>shiny, <span>silvery <span>substance.<br/>
🎧 You may have <span>seen it in <span>old-fashioned <span>thermometers,<br/>
🎧 but it's not used much for <span>domestic <span>purposes <span>now<br/>
🎧 because it's <span>highly <span>toxic.<br/>
🎧 But the <span>problem is that the amount of <span>mercury in the <span>environment's <span>increasing.<br/>
🎧 The <span>main <span>reason for this is the <span>power <span>plants used to <span>produce <span>electricity.<br/>
🎧 The <span>main <span>source of <span>energy that most of them use is still <span>coal,<br/>
🎧 and when it's <span>burned it <span>releases <span>mercury into the <span>atmosphere.<br/>
🎧 Some of this <span>gets <span>deposited into <span>lakes and <span>rivers,<br/>
🎧 and if it's <span>ingested by a <span>fish it's not <span>excreted,<br/>
🎧 it <span>stays in the <span>fish's <span>body and it <span>enters the food <span>chain.<br/>
🎧 So it's been <span>known for some time that <span>birds which eat <span>fish may be <span>affected,<br/>
🎧 but what wasn't <span>known until quite <span>recently is that those that eat <span>insects can also be <span>affected.<br/>
🎧 So a <span>woman called <span>Claire <span>Varian-Ramos is doing some <span>research on how this is <span>affecting <span>birds.<br/>
🎧 And rather than looking at how many <span>birds are actually <span>killed by <span>mercury <span>poisoning,<br/>
🎧 she's looking for more <span>subtle <span>sub-effects.<br/>
🎧 And these may be to do with the <span>behaviour of the <span>birds,<br/>
🎧 or with the <span>effect of <span>mercury on the way their <span>brain <span>works,<br/>
🎧 so <span>whether it <span>leads to <span>problems with <span>memory, for example.<br/>
🎧 And she's <span>particularly <span>focusing on the <span>effects of <span>mercury on <span>bird <span>song.<br/>
🎧 Now, the <span>process of <span>song <span>learning <span>happens at a <span>particular <span>stage in the <span>birds' <span>development,<br/>
🎧 and what you may not <span>know<br/>
🎧 is that a young <span>bird <span>seems to <span>acquire this <span>skill by <span>listening to the <span>songs <span>produced by its <span>father,<br/>
🎧 rather than by any other <span>bird.<br/>
🎧 And <span>Varian-Ramos has already <span>found in her <span>research<br/>
🎧 that if young <span>male <span>birds are <span>exposed to <span>mercury,<br/>
🎧 if they eat food <span>contaminated with <span>mercury,<br/>
🎧 then the <span>songs they <span>produce aren't as <span>complex as those <span>produced by other <span>birds.<br/>
🎧 So quite <span>low-level <span>exposure to <span>mercury is <span>likely to have an <span>impact on <span>male <span>birds in a <span>natural <span>situation,<br/>
🎧 because it can mean that they're less <span>attractive to <span>female <span>birds,<br/>
🎧 and so it can <span>affect their <span>chances of <span>reproduction.<br/>
🎧 Now the way she's <span>carrying out this <span>research is <span>worth thinking about.<br/>
🎧 She's <span>using a <span>mixture of <span>studies <span>using <span>birds <span>kept in <span>laboratories,<br/>
🎧 and <span>studies <span>carried out <span>outdoors in the <span>wild.<br/>
🎧 The <span>lab-based <span>studies have the <span>advantage that you don't get all the <span>variables you would in a <span>natural <span>setting,<br/>
🎧 so the <span>experimenter has a much <span>higher <span>level of <span>control,<br/>
🎧 and that <span>means they can be more <span>confident about their <span>results in some <span>ways.<br/>
🎧 And of course they don't have to <span>worry about going out and <span>finding the <span>birds in order to <span>observe them.<br/>
🎧 So what are the <span>implications here for <span>humans?<br/>
🎧 Well, because many <span>birds are <span>migratory,<br/>
🎧 they may be <span>transporting <span>mercury <span>far from <span>contaminated <span>sites.<br/>
🎧 For example, it's been <span>found that <span>ducks who'd been <span>feeding at a <span>contaminated <span>site<br/>
🎧 were later <span>shot by <span>hunters over a <span>thousand <span>kilometres away,<br/>
🎧 and <span>presumably <span>eaten.<br/>
🎧 But these <span>birds <span>likely had <span>mercury <span>levels high enough to <span>warrant <span>concern for <span>human <span>consumption.<br/>
🎧 In <span>addition, going back to <span>song <span>learning by <span>birds,<br/>
🎧 we saw that this may be <span>affected by <span>mercury <span>contamination.<br/>
🎧 Well, we also know that in <span>humans,<br/>
🎧 <span>mercury <span>causes <span>developmental <span>delays in the <span>acquisition of <span>language,<br/>
🎧 and in <span>fact this <span>process is very <span>similar in the <span>brain <span>regions it <span>involves<br/>
🎧 and even the <span>genes that are <span>involved.<br/>
🎧 But <span>mercury <span>contamination has other important <span>implications for <span>humans as well.<br/>
🎧 It's now <span>known that an <span>unborn <span>child can be <span>affected<br/>
🎧 if the food <span>eaten by its <span>mother <span>contains high <span>levels of <span>mercury,<br/>
🎧 and these <span>effects can be quite <span>substantial.<br/>
🎧 In the end, it comes down to <span>whether more <span>value is <span>placed on <span>human <span>economic <span>wellbeing or <span>environmental <span>wellbeing.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>true there are new <span>regulations for <span>mercury <span>emissions from <span>power <span>plants,<br/>
🎧 but these will need <span>billions of <span>dollars to <span>implement,<br/>
🎧 and <span>increase <span>costs for everyone.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>argue that's too much to pay to <span>protect <span>wildlife.<br/>
🎧 But as we've <span>seen, the issues go <span>beyond that,<br/>
🎧 and I think it's an issue we need to <span>consider very <span>carefully.<br/>
