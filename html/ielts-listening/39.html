🎧 Hello?<br/>
🎧 Hi, Susie, it's Paul here.<br/>
🎧 How are you?<br/>
🎧 Enjoying your new job?<br/>
🎧 You're working at the library, aren't you?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 I started when the library re-opened a month ago.<br/>
🎧 It's great.<br/>
🎧 Actually Carol and I have been meaning to join for a while.<br/>
🎧 Oh, you should.<br/>
🎧 It doesn't cost anything,<br/>
🎧 and the new library has all sorts of facilities.<br/>
🎧 It's not just a place where you borrow books.<br/>
🎧 For instance, there's an area with comfortable seats where you can sit and read the magazines they have there.<br/>
🎧 Some people spend the whole morning there.<br/>
🎧 Wish I had that amount of time to spend!<br/>
🎧 Yes, you must be pretty busy at present, with the children and everything?<br/>
🎧 We are, yes.<br/>
🎧 But we're hoping to get away this summer.<br/>
🎧 We're thinking of going to Greece.<br/>
🎧 Well, we've got a much larger section of the library devoted to travel books now,<br/>
🎧 so you should come and have a look.<br/>
🎧 I can't remember if there's anything specifically on Greece,<br/>
🎧 but I should think so.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Now Carol's organising a project for the history class she teaches at school,<br/>
🎧 it's about life in the town a hundred years ago.<br/>
🎧 Do you have anything that might be useful?<br/>
🎧 Yes, actually we've now got a new section with materials on the history of the town and surrounding region.<br/>
🎧 Right. I'll tell her.<br/>
🎧 You can't always find that sort of thing on the internet.<br/>
🎧 Now in the old library there used to be a separate room with reference books.<br/>
🎧 It was a really nice quiet room.<br/>
🎧 Yes. We've put those books in the main part of the library now,<br/>
🎧 but we do have a room called the community room.<br/>
🎧 It can be hired out for meetings,<br/>
🎧 but at other times people can use it to study.<br/>
🎧 I might use that.<br/>
🎧 It's hard to find anywhere quiet at home sometimes.<br/>
🎧 I can't remember how old your son and daughter are…<br/>
🎧 we've introduced a special section of fiction written specially for teenagers,<br/>
🎧 but they might be a bit young for that?<br/>
🎧 Yes, they would be.<br/>
🎧 Well, we do have lots of activities for younger children.<br/>
🎧 Yes?<br/>
🎧 For example we have a Science Club.<br/>
🎧 At the next meeting, they're going to be doing experiments with stuff that everyone has in the kitchen -<br/>
🎧 sugar and flour and so on.<br/>
🎧 They might be interested, yes.<br/>
🎧 And we have a competition for children called Reading Challenge.<br/>
🎧 That doesn't begin until after the end of term.<br/>
🎧 They have to read six books,<br/>
🎧 and they get a certificate if they manage it.<br/>
🎧 So that gives them something to do while they're on holiday, instead of getting bored.<br/>
🎧 That's the idea.<br/>
🎧 And there's special activities for adults too.<br/>
🎧 On Friday we have a local author called Tanya Streep,<br/>
🎧 who's going to be talking about her new novel.<br/>
🎧 It's called 'Catch the Mouse'<br/>
🎧 and she based the story on a crime that actually took place here years ago.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 We're not free on Friday, but I'll look out for the book.<br/>
🎧 Now this probably isn't for you,<br/>
🎧 but we do have IT support available for members.<br/>
🎧 We get quite a few older people coming along<br/>
🎧 who are wanting to get up to speed with computer technology.<br/>
🎧 It's on Tuesday mornings -<br/>
🎧 they don't need to make an appointment or anything, they just turn up.<br/>
🎧 Well, my mother might be interested,<br/>
🎧 I'll let her know.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And there's another service which you wouldn't expect from a library,<br/>
🎧 which is a free medical check-up.<br/>
🎧 The hospital arranges for someone to come along<br/>
🎧 and measure the level of sugar in your blood,<br/>
🎧 and they check cholesterol levels at the same time.<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 Yes, but that's only for the over-60s,<br/>
🎧 so you wouldn't qualify.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'll tell my mother, she might be interested.<br/>
🎧 What other information…<br/>
🎧 well, we do have a little shop with things like wallcharts and greetings cards,<br/>
🎧 and also stamps so you can post the cards straightaway, which is really useful.<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'll bring the children round at the weekend and we'll join.<br/>
🎧 Oh, one more thing - I'll be bringing the car, is there parking available?<br/>
🎧 Yes, and it's free in the evening and at weekends.<br/>
🎧 Perfect.<br/>
🎧 Well, thanks, Susie...<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 In this session in your training day we're going to look at some of the more specialised holidays we offer at BC Travel.<br/>
🎧 Now, the travel business is very competitive<br/>
🎧 and it's important to be aware of how the market's changing and developing.<br/>
🎧 In terms of age groups,<br/>
🎧 the over-65s are an important market,<br/>
🎧 and one that's increasing steadily year on year.<br/>
🎧 The fewest holidays are taken by the 31 to 42-year-olds,<br/>
🎧 and that figure shows no sign of rising.<br/>
🎧 The biggest market at present is still the youngest group,<br/>
🎧 the 16 to 30s,<br/>
🎧 but this group's also seen the biggest drop over the last few years,<br/>
🎧 whereas there's a noticeable growth in the number of holidays taken by the 55 to 64-year-olds.<br/>
🎧 As far as the 43 to 54-year-olds are concerned,<br/>
🎧 bookings there are steady,<br/>
🎧 but I have to say we haven't seen the increase we expected.<br/>
🎧 One trend we're noticing with nearly all age groups is the growing popularity of holidays<br/>
🎧 in which clients do some kind of specialised activity.<br/>
🎧 I'm not talking here about adventure holidays,<br/>
🎧 where clients take part in high-risk activities like white water rafting just for the thrill of it.<br/>
🎧 Activity holidays usually involve rather less high-risk sports, or things like art and music.<br/>
🎧 They're not necessarily cheaper than ordinary holidays, often the opposite, in fact.<br/>
🎧 But they do often take place outside the main tourist centres,<br/>
🎧 which gives an opportunity for clients to find out more about the local people and customs,<br/>
🎧 and many say this is one of the most positive features of these holidays.<br/>
🎧 Of course, they offer the chance to develop a new skill or talent,<br/>
🎧 but clients often say that more than this,<br/>
🎧 it's the chance to create lasting relationships with other like-minded people,<br/>
🎧 that's the main draw.<br/>
🎧 Let me give you some examples of BC Travel activity holidays.<br/>
🎧 Our painting holidays take place in four different centres in France and Italy<br/>
🎧 and they're very popular with clients of all abilities from beginners onwards.<br/>
🎧 We've got an excellent team of artists to lead the classes -<br/>
🎧 some of them have been with us from the start, and five additional ones will be joining us this year<br/>
🎧 so that we can offer a greater number of classes in each centre.<br/>
🎧 As far as cooking holidays are concerned,<br/>
🎧 I know a lot of agents offer holidays where clients cook recipes related to one particular country,<br/>
🎧 usually the one they're staying in, but we focus on dishes from a great many different ones.<br/>
🎧 Apart from that you'll find the usual emphasis on good quality, organic ingredients -<br/>
🎧 that's more or less a given nowadays -<br/>
🎧 and there are generally some meat-free recipes included.<br/>
🎧 Our photography holidays take place in a wide range of countries from Iceland to Vietnam,<br/>
🎧 and clients have the opportunity to see some stunning scenery.<br/>
🎧 Groups are small, no more than eight,<br/>
🎧 so clients can have one-on-one tuition during the holiday,<br/>
🎧 and excursions are arranged with fully-trained guides.<br/>
🎧 At the end of each holiday an exhibition is held of the photographs taken<br/>
🎧 so that clients can see one another's work and receive valuable feedback from the tutor.<br/>
🎧 Finally, let me tell you about our fitness holidays.<br/>
🎧 In Ireland and Italy we run one-week general fitness classes for all ages and levels of fitness.<br/>
🎧 Clients start the course with a consultation with a trainer,<br/>
🎧 and together they draw up an individual programme.<br/>
🎧 As well as improving general fitness,<br/>
🎧 clients find that they end up losing much of the stress they've built up in their daily lives.<br/>
🎧 In Greece, we have a two-week holiday for clients who want to do something about their weight.<br/>
🎧 This has all the features you'd expect, like a personalised diet programme,<br/>
🎧 but one of its most popular features is that the exercise classes are all held on the beach.<br/>
🎧 People say it's far preferable to being in a gym.<br/>
🎧 Finally, we offer several holidays in Morocco.<br/>
🎧 One very popular one is the mountain biking holiday.<br/>
🎧 Bikes are provided and there are different routes according to people's ability.<br/>
🎧 We offer one which is tailored to the needs of families, which is particularly popular.<br/>
🎧 OK, so that's about all the time I have today, so...<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Dave, I'm worried about our case study.<br/>
🎧 I've done a bit of reading, but I'm not sure what's involved in actually writing a case study.<br/>
🎧 I missed the lecture where Dr Baker talked us through it.<br/>
🎧 OK, well it's quite straightforward.<br/>
🎧 We've got our focus - that's tourism at the Horton Castle site.<br/>
🎧 And you said you'd done some reading about it.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I found some articles and made notes of the main points.<br/>
🎧 Did you remember to keep a record of where you got the information from?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 I know what a pain it is when you forget that.<br/>
🎧 OK, so we can compare what we've read.<br/>
🎧 Then we have to decide on a particular problem or need at our site.<br/>
🎧 And then think about who we're going to interview to get more information.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So who'd that be?<br/>
🎧 The people who work there?<br/>
🎧 And presumably some of the tourists too?<br/>
🎧 Yes, both those groups.<br/>
🎧 So we'll have to go to the site to do that, I suppose.<br/>
🎧 But we might also do some of our interviewing away from the site -<br/>
🎧 we could even contact some people here in the city,<br/>
🎧 like administrators involved in overseeing tourism.<br/>
🎧 OK. So we'll need to think about our interview questions and...<br/>
🎧 fix times and places for the meetings.<br/>
🎧 It's all going to take a lot of time.<br/>
🎧 And if we can, we should ask our interviewees if they can bring along some numerical data<br/>
🎧 that we can add to support our findings.<br/>
🎧 And photographs?<br/>
🎧 I think we have plenty of those already.<br/>
🎧 But Dr Baker also said<br/>
🎧 we have to establish with our interviewees whether we can identify them in our case study,<br/>
🎧 or whether they want to be anonymous.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I wouldn't have thought of that.<br/>
🎧 OK, once we've got all this information, I suppose we have to analyse it.<br/>
🎧 Yes, put it all together and choose what's relevant to the problem we're focusing on,<br/>
🎧 and analyse that carefully to find out if we can identify any trends or regularities there.<br/>
🎧 That's the main thing at this stage, rather than concentrating on details or lots of facts.<br/>
🎧 OK. And then once we've analysed that, what next?<br/>
🎧 Well, then we need to think about what we do with the data we've selected<br/>
🎧 to make it as clear as possible to our readers.<br/>
🎧 Things like graphs, or tables, or charts.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Then the case study itself is mostly quite standard;<br/>
🎧 we begin by presenting the problem, and giving some background,<br/>
🎧 then go through the main sections,<br/>
🎧 but the thing that surprised me is that in a normal report<br/>
🎧 we'd end with some suggestions to deal with the problem or need we identified,<br/>
🎧 but in a case study we end up with a question or a series of questions to our readers,<br/>
🎧 and they decide what ought to be done.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I hadn't realised that.<br/>
🎧 So basically, the problem we're addressing in our case study of the Horton Castle site<br/>
🎧 is why so few tourists are visiting it.<br/>
🎧 And we'll find out more from our interviews,<br/>
🎧 but I did find one report on the internet that suggested that one reason might be because...<br/>
🎧 as far as transport goes, access is difficult.<br/>
🎧 I read that too, but that report was actually written ten years ago,<br/>
🎧 when the road there was really bad, but that's been improved now.<br/>
🎧 And I think there's plenty of fascinating stuff there for a really good day out,<br/>
🎧 but you'd never realise it from the castle website -<br/>
🎧 maybe that's the problem.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's really dry and boring.<br/>
🎧 I read somewhere a suggestion that what the castle needs is a visitor centre.<br/>
🎧 So we could have a look for some information about that on the internet.<br/>
🎧 What would we need to know?<br/>
🎧 Well, who'd use it for a start.<br/>
🎧 It'd be good to know what categories the visitors fell into too,<br/>
🎧 like school parties or retired people,<br/>
🎧 but I think we'd have to talk to staff to get that information.<br/>
🎧 OK. And as we're thinking of suggesting a visitor centre<br/>
🎧 we'd also have to look at potential problems.<br/>
🎧 I mean, obviously it wouldn't be cheap to set up.<br/>
🎧 No, but it could be a really good investment.<br/>
🎧 And as it's on a historical site it'd need to get special planning permission, I expect.<br/>
🎧 That might be hard.<br/>
🎧 Right, especially as the only possible place for it would be at the entrance,<br/>
🎧 and that's right in front of the castle.<br/>
🎧 But it could be a good thing for the town of Horton.<br/>
🎧 At present it's a bit of a ghost town.<br/>
🎧 Once they've left school and got any skills or qualifications,<br/>
🎧 the young people all get out as fast as they can to get jobs in the city,<br/>
🎧 and the only people left are children and those who've retired.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Something else we could investigate would be the potential damage that tourists might cause to the castle site,<br/>
🎧 I mean their environmental impact.<br/>
🎧 At present the tourists can just wander round wherever they want,<br/>
🎧 but if numbers increase, there might have to be some restrictions, like sticking to marked ways.<br/>
🎧 And there'd need to be guides and wardens around to make sure these were enforced.<br/>
🎧 Yes, we could look at that too.<br/>
🎧 OK, well…<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 OK, so we've been looking at how man-made changes in our environment can affect wildlife.<br/>
🎧 Now I'll discuss a particular example.<br/>
🎧 Let's take a look at mercury.<br/>
🎧 Mercury's one of the 120 or so elements that make up all matter,<br/>
🎧 and it has the symbol Hg.<br/>
🎧 It's a shiny, silvery substance.<br/>
🎧 You may have seen it in old-fashioned thermometers,<br/>
🎧 but it's not used much for domestic purposes now<br/>
🎧 because it's highly toxic.<br/>
🎧 But the problem is that the amount of mercury in the environment's increasing.<br/>
🎧 The main reason for this is the power plants used to produce electricity.<br/>
🎧 The main source of energy that most of them use is still coal,<br/>
🎧 and when it's burned it releases mercury into the atmosphere.<br/>
🎧 Some of this gets deposited into lakes and rivers,<br/>
🎧 and if it's ingested by a fish it's not excreted,<br/>
🎧 it stays in the fish's body and it enters the food chain.<br/>
🎧 So it's been known for some time that birds which eat fish may be affected,<br/>
🎧 but what wasn't known until quite recently is that those that eat insects can also be affected.<br/>
🎧 So a woman called Claire Varian-Ramos is doing some research on how this is affecting birds.<br/>
🎧 And rather than looking at how many birds are actually killed by mercury poisoning,<br/>
🎧 she's looking for more subtle sub-effects.<br/>
🎧 And these may be to do with the behaviour of the birds,<br/>
🎧 or with the effect of mercury on the way their brain works,<br/>
🎧 so whether it leads to problems with memory, for example.<br/>
🎧 And she's particularly focusing on the effects of mercury on bird song.<br/>
🎧 Now, the process of song learning happens at a particular stage in the birds' development,<br/>
🎧 and what you may not know<br/>
🎧 is that a young bird seems to acquire this skill by listening to the songs produced by its father,<br/>
🎧 rather than by any other bird.<br/>
🎧 And Varian-Ramos has already found in her research<br/>
🎧 that if young male birds are exposed to mercury,<br/>
🎧 if they eat food contaminated with mercury,<br/>
🎧 then the songs they produce aren't as complex as those produced by other birds.<br/>
🎧 So quite low-level exposure to mercury is likely to have an impact on male birds in a natural situation,<br/>
🎧 because it can mean that they're less attractive to female birds,<br/>
🎧 and so it can affect their chances of reproduction.<br/>
🎧 Now the way she's carrying out this research is worth thinking about.<br/>
🎧 She's using a mixture of studies using birds kept in laboratories,<br/>
🎧 and studies carried out outdoors in the wild.<br/>
🎧 The lab-based studies have the advantage that you don't get all the variables you would in a natural setting,<br/>
🎧 so the experimenter has a much higher level of control,<br/>
🎧 and that means they can be more confident about their results in some ways.<br/>
🎧 And of course they don't have to worry about going out and finding the birds in order to observe them.<br/>
🎧 So what are the implications here for humans?<br/>
🎧 Well, because many birds are migratory,<br/>
🎧 they may be transporting mercury far from contaminated sites.<br/>
🎧 For example, it's been found that ducks who'd been feeding at a contaminated site<br/>
🎧 were later shot by hunters over a thousand kilometres away,<br/>
🎧 and presumably eaten.<br/>
🎧 But these birds likely had mercury levels high enough to warrant concern for human consumption.<br/>
🎧 In addition, going back to song learning by birds,<br/>
🎧 we saw that this may be affected by mercury contamination.<br/>
🎧 Well, we also know that in humans,<br/>
🎧 mercury causes developmental delays in the acquisition of language,<br/>
🎧 and in fact this process is very similar in the brain regions it involves<br/>
🎧 and even the genes that are involved.<br/>
🎧 But mercury contamination has other important implications for humans as well.<br/>
🎧 It's now known that an unborn child can be affected<br/>
🎧 if the food eaten by its mother contains high levels of mercury,<br/>
🎧 and these effects can be quite substantial.<br/>
🎧 In the end, it comes down to whether more value is placed on human economic wellbeing or environmental wellbeing.<br/>
🎧 It's true there are new regulations for mercury emissions from power plants,<br/>
🎧 but these will need billions of dollars to implement,<br/>
🎧 and increase costs for everyone.<br/>
🎧 Some argue that's too much to pay to protect wildlife.<br/>
🎧 But as we've seen, the issues go beyond that,<br/>
🎧 and I think it's an issue we need to consider very carefully.<br/>
<br/><br/>
