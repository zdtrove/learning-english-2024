🎧 Oh, <span>Peter</span>, there you are.<br/>
🎧 You've been <span>ages</span>. What <span>kept</span> you so long?<br/>
🎧 I'm sorry I'm so <span>late</span>, <span>Sally</span>.<br/>
🎧 Have you been <span>waiting</span> long?<br/>
🎧 Oh, <span>half</span> an <span>hour</span>.<br/>
🎧 But it doesn't <span>matter</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've had a <span>coffee</span> and I've been <span>reading</span> this <span>guidebook</span> for <span>tourists</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sit down.<br/>
🎧 You look very hot and <span>tired</span>.<br/>
🎧 What would you like to drink?<br/>
🎧 I'd love a really <span>chilled</span> <span>mineral</span> water or something.<br/>
🎧 Will you have another <span>coffee</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I will.<br/>
🎧 The <span>waitress</span> will be back in a <span>moment</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why were you so <span>late</span>?<br/>
🎧 Did something <span>happen</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 You know, I went to the <span>bank</span> to <span>cash</span> some <span>travellers</span> <span>cheques</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, the <span>exchange</span> <span>rate</span> was looking <span>healthy</span>, <span>but..</span>.<br/>
🎧 when I went to the <span>teller</span>, they told me the <span>computer</span> <span>system</span> was <span>temporarily</span> down,<br/>
🎧 so they couldn't do any <span>transactions</span>.<br/>
🎧 They said the <span>problem</span> would be <span>fixed</span> in a few <span>minutes</span>, so I <span>waited</span>.<br/>
🎧 And then I <span>started</span> talking to another guy in the <span>bank</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I <span>forgot</span> the time.<br/>
🎧 Oh, really?<br/>
🎧 <span>Someone</span> you <span>met</span> in the <span>bank</span>?<br/>
🎧 Does he work there?<br/>
🎧 No, he was a <span>tourist</span>, from New <span>York</span>.<br/>
🎧 His <span>name's</span> <span>Henry</span>,<br/>
🎧 and he's been here for a week, but he's <span>moving</span> on to <span>Germany</span> <span>tomorrow</span>.<br/>
🎧 He's an <span>architect</span>,<br/>
🎧 and he's spending <span>four</span> <span>weeks</span> <span>travelling</span> around <span>Europe</span>.<br/>
🎧 Just like us!<br/>
🎧 Yeah, just like us.<br/>
🎧 He told me the <span>names</span> of some <span>places</span> where we should eat.<br/>
🎧 Great food, and not too <span>expensive</span>, he said.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and he also gave me this map of the bus <span>system</span>.<br/>
🎧 He said he didn't need it any more.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>useful</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Pity</span> he's <span>moving</span> on <span>tomorrow</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ah, here's the <span>waitress</span>. Let's <span>order</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you want anything to eat, or shall we just have a drink?<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm <span>hungry</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we've got a lot of <span>sightseeing</span> to do, so let's just have a <span>snack</span> and a drink.<br/>
🎧 Sounds good to me!<br/>
🎧 Well, let's decide what we'll see today.<br/>
🎧 I <span>guess</span> the best place to start is the <span>Cathedral</span>,<br/>
🎧 and then the <span>Castle</span>.<br/>
🎧 What are the <span>opening</span> <span>times</span> for those two?<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>according</span> to this <span>guidebook</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>Cathedral</span> is only open from <span>9:30</span> in the morning until <span>midday</span>.<br/>
🎧 No, <span>hang</span> on.<br/>
🎧 That's the <span>Cathedral</span> <span>Museum</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Cathedral</span> <span>itself</span> is open morning and <span>afternoon</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Castle</span> is just open from one to <span>five</span>,<br/>
🎧 so we can't go there until after lunch.<br/>
🎧 I really want to <span>spend</span> some time in the <span>Art</span> <span>Gallery</span>,<br/>
🎧 because <span>they've</span> got this <span>wonderful</span> <span>painting</span> by <span>Rembrandt</span> that I've always wanted to see.<br/>
🎧 What else should we see?<br/>
🎧 Well, the <span>guidebook</span> says the <span>Botanical</span> <span>Gardens</span> are <span>worth</span> spending some time in,<br/>
🎧 and they're open all day, from <span>eight</span> to six, so we can go there any time.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to go to the <span>Markets</span> near the <span>river</span> too, <span>but..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>oh..</span>. no, wait, that's only in the <span>mornings</span>, too.<br/>
🎧 As well as today and <span>tomorrow</span>, we can see some other <span>places</span> on <span>Monday</span>, you know.<br/>
🎧 But I don't think the <span>Markets</span> will be open <span>then:</span> they only open on <span>Thursdays</span>,<br/>
🎧 so we've <span>missed</span> them for this week.<br/>
🎧 Maybe we should go to the <span>Cathedral</span> <span>today<br/></span>
🎧 because it's <span>Sunday</span> <span>tomorrow</span>, and even though it's open every day,<br/>
🎧 it might be more <span>difficult</span> to get in <span>tomorrow</span> because of the <span>church</span> <span>services</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>true</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>Art</span> <span>Gallery</span> isn't open on <span>Sundays</span> at all,<br/>
🎧 so we'll have to go there today.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Castle's</span> open every day <span>except</span> <span>Mondays</span>, so we're okay there,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>Gardens</span> of course only <span>close</span> at <span>night</span>.<br/>
🎧 Are all these <span>places</span> free or do we have to pay to go in?<br/>
🎧 What does the <span>guidebook</span> say?<br/>
🎧 I think there's a <span>charge</span> for all of them <span>except</span> the <span>Botanical</span> <span>Gardens</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and the <span>Markets</span>, of course you don't pay to go in.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Well, it looks like our plan is <span>this:<br/></span>
🎧 we'll go to see the <span>painting</span> you like first, the <span>Rembrandt</span>,<br/>
🎧 then have lunch and go on to the <span>Castle</span> after that, and then the <span>Cathedral</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 It says here that the <span>roof</span> of the <span>Cathedral</span> is really <span>beautiful</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is that right?<br/>
🎧 What I really want to do at the <span>Cathedral</span> is <span>climb</span> the <span>tower</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>view</span> is <span>supposed</span> to be <span>spectacular</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, well, <span>that'll</span> be more than enough for today.<br/>
🎧 Then, <span>tomorrow</span>, let's go to the <span>Botanical</span> <span>Gardens</span> and have a <span>picnic</span>.<br/>
🎧 I want to sit by the <span>river</span> and <span>watch</span> the <span>swans</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>city's</span> famous for them.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 So the <span>counselling</span> <span>services</span> we <span>offer</span> <span>deal</span> with any <span>problems</span> <span>arising</span> from your <span>studies</span>,<br/>
🎧 or in your life outside the <span>university</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's take <span>academic</span> <span>counselling</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you're <span>confused</span> about <span>subjects</span> or how to <span>combine</span> them in your <span>degree</span>,<br/>
🎧 then we can <span>advise</span> you and <span>discuss</span> the <span>career</span> you are <span>aiming</span> for,<br/>
🎧 so that you can see it all in <span>context</span>.<br/>
🎧 We can also <span>chase</span> up your <span>tutor</span> if you're not getting <span>proper</span> <span>feedback</span> on how you are getting on in your <span>subject</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Besides</span> help with <span>academic</span> <span>problems</span>,<br/>
🎧 you may also need <span>personal</span> <span>counselling:<br/></span>
🎧 if you think you're already under <span>stress</span>,<br/>
🎧 well, just wait <span>till</span> <span>classes</span> <span>begin</span> next week.<br/>
🎧 You'll have to start <span>adjusting</span> to <span>teaching</span> and <span>learning</span> <span>methods</span> that may be <span>unfamiliar</span> to you,<br/>
🎧 as well as the <span>mounting</span> <span>pressure</span> as the <span>deadline</span> for that first <span>assignment</span> <span>creeps</span> up on you.<br/>
🎧 And of course, you have to <span>cope</span> with all this without your <span>usual</span> <span>social</span> <span>network</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 you know, the <span>social</span> <span>contacts</span>, <span>family</span> and friends you could <span>normally</span> <span>rely</span> on for help.<br/>
🎧 All of this <span>causes</span> <span>anxiety</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Studying</span> <span>overseas</span> can <span>trigger</span> a <span>personal</span> <span>crisis</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 you may have <span>left</span> a lot of what you might call <span>'unfinished</span> <span>business'</span> back in your own <span>country</span>,<br/>
🎧 or you may have <span>interrupted</span> <span>personal</span> <span>relationships<br/></span>
🎧 or even sometimes have <span>broken</span> them off to come <span>overseas</span>,<br/>
🎧 and so the <span>student</span> often <span>feels</span> <span>lonely</span>, <span>unhappy</span>, <span>unmotivated<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>unable</span> to <span>concentrate</span> on <span>studying</span>.<br/>
🎧 Or there may be other things <span>bothering</span> you.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>resident</span> <span>chaplain</span> can <span>offer</span> you <span>spiritual</span> <span>guidance</span> if that's what you want,<br/>
🎧 or we can put you in touch with <span>community</span> <span>groups</span> that can <span>provide</span> you with <span>social</span> <span>contacts</span> and <span>friendship</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about <span>exam</span> <span>stress</span>?<br/>
🎧 It <span>affects</span> <span>nearly</span> everyone to some <span>extent</span>,<br/>
🎧 but <span>especially</span> <span>overseas</span> <span>students</span> like <span>yourselves</span>.<br/>
🎧 There may be a <span>huge</span> <span>amount</span> of <span>family</span> <span>pressure</span> on you to <span>succeed</span>,<br/>
🎧 and if you <span>fail</span> a <span>subject</span> or <span>drop</span> out of a course because it's too <span>difficult<br/></span>
🎧 then your <span>self-esteem</span> can <span>suffer</span>.<br/>
🎧 But it's not the end of the <span>world</span> if you don't <span>pass</span> an <span>exam</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 I had to <span>resit</span> First Year <span>Anthropology</span>, so I can <span>certainly</span> <span>offer</span> you a <span>sympathetic</span> <span>ear</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, <span>exam</span> <span>failure</span> can <span>lead</span> to <span>worrying</span> changes in the way you <span>normally</span> <span>behave</span>.<br/>
🎧 You may also be off your food,<br/>
🎧 or you may have <span>dietary</span> <span>problems<br/></span>
🎧 because the <span>local</span> food is not to your <span>liking</span> and <span>upsets</span> you,<br/>
🎧 and this can <span>affect</span> your <span>health</span> and <span>studies</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Glenda</span> <span>Roberts</span> is our <span>dietician</span> in the <span>Health</span> <span>Service<br/></span>
🎧 and we can put you on to her.<br/>
🎧 And we all have money <span>problems</span>, don't we?<br/>
🎧 But <span>remember</span>, <span>full-time</span> <span>students</span> can get a <span>low-interest</span> <span>loan</span> of up to six <span>hundred</span> <span>dollars</span> to buy <span>books<br/></span>
🎧 and for <span>similar</span> <span>study-related</span> <span>expenses</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's right,<br/>
🎧 and you can get <span>double</span> that <span>amount</span> if you can't <span>afford</span> an <span>item</span> of <span>equipment</span> you need for your course <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 a <span>musical</span> <span>instrument</span>, for example.<br/>
🎧 And it doesn't <span>stop</span> there.<br/>
🎧 When you move into a <span>flat</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>starting-up</span> <span>expenses</span>, <span>including</span> <span>furniture</span> for it,<br/>
🎧 can be <span>covered</span> by a <span>loan</span> through the <span>Welfare</span> <span>Service</span>.<br/>
🎧 See <span>Jill</span> <span>Freeman</span> for <span>details</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can we help you?<br/>
🎧 Well, last <span>academic</span> year, in <span>spite</span> of <span>staff</span> <span>cuts</span>,<br/>
🎧 we <span>counselled</span> <span>240</span> <span>international</span> <span>students</span> for a <span>total</span> of <span>2600</span> hours <span>counselling</span>,<br/>
🎧 and, <span>finally</span> we <span>won</span> all but just <span>1</span> of the <span>12</span> <span>appeals</span> that we <span>launched</span> on <span>behalf</span> of <span>students</span>.<br/>
🎧 Not too bad for an <span>understaffed</span> <span>service</span>, don't you think?<br/>
🎧 That's all from me.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Oh, there you are, good.<br/>
🎧 Sorry, I'm a bit <span>late</span> <span>-</span> there was a long <span>queue</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, have you <span>worked</span> out how to <span>deal</span> with this <span>assignment</span> then?<br/>
🎧 Not yet, we've only been here a <span>couple</span> of <span>minutes</span> <span>ourselves</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can you just <span>remind</span> me what the <span>task</span> is exactly?<br/>
🎧 Well, there are two, no, <span>three</span>, <span>parts</span> to <span>it:<br/></span>
🎧 first, we've got to <span>write</span> an <span>essay</span> about <span>ways</span> of <span>collecting</span> <span>data</span>.<br/>
🎧 What's the <span>title</span> of the <span>essay</span> exactly?<br/>
🎧 I've got it <span>here:<br/></span>
🎧 <span>'Assess</span> the two <span>main</span> <span>methods</span> of <span>collecting</span> <span>data</span> in <span>social</span> <span>science</span> <span>research'</span>.<br/>
🎧 And how much do we need to <span>write</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Fifteen</span> <span>hundred</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's for the <span>essay</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then, for the <span>second</span> <span>part</span> of the <span>assignment</span>, we have to choose one <span>method</span> of <span>data</span> <span>collection</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>'carry</span> out a <span>small-scale</span> <span>study'</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>'making</span> <span>appropriate</span> use of the <span>method</span> <span>chosen</span> to <span>gather</span> <span>data</span> from at <span>least</span> <span>five</span> <span>subjects'</span>.<br/>
🎧 And then we have to <span>write</span> a <span>report</span> on the <span>study</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's right, of <span>three</span> to <span>four</span> <span>thousand</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 Did you get as <span>far</span> as <span>discussing</span> which <span>form</span> of <span>data</span> <span>collection</span> we should go for <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>questionnaire</span> or <span>interview</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I think we should use a <span>questionnaire</span>.<br/>
🎧 It'll be so much less <span>time-consuming</span> than <span>organising</span> <span>interviews</span>, I <span>reckon</span>.<br/>
🎧 Once we've agreed on the <span>wording</span> of it, we only have to <span>send</span> it out and wait for the <span>responses</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I think it probably would be <span>quicker</span>.<br/>
🎧 But what did that <span>article</span> he gave us last week say about the <span>quality</span> of <span>data</span> from <span>questionnaires</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>pretty</span> sure it <span>recommended</span> <span>questionnaires</span> as a <span>source</span> of <span>'highly</span> <span>reliable</span> <span>data'</span>.<br/>
🎧 As long as you <span>design</span> the <span>questionnaire</span> <span>properly</span> in the first place, the <span>data</span> will be fine.<br/>
🎧 No, I'm sure it <span>talked</span> about <span>drawbacks</span> as well, didn't it?<br/>
🎧 Something about the <span>response</span> <span>rate</span> and the <span>problems</span> you get if it's too low.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, but we only need <span>data</span> from <span>five</span> <span>subjects</span> <span>anyway</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> so.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>drawback</span> I <span>remember</span> it <span>mentioned</span> was <span>that<br/></span>
🎧 <span>questionnaire</span> <span>data</span> <span>tends</span> not to <span>reveal</span> anything <span>unexpected</span>, <span>because..</span>.<br/>
🎧 it is <span>limited</span> to the <span>questions</span> <span>fixed</span> in <span>advance</span> by the <span>researcher</span>.<br/>
🎧 Come on, <span>Rosa</span>. This is only a <span>practice</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's not <span>meant</span> to be <span>real</span> <span>research</span>, is it?<br/>
🎧 Well, not sure about that.<br/>
🎧 Maybe I'd better go through the <span>article</span> again, just to be sure.<br/>
🎧 Can you <span>remember</span> what it was called?<br/>
🎧 <span>Sample</span> <span>Surveys</span> in <span>Social</span> <span>Science</span> <span>Research'</span>, I think.<br/>
🎧 By <span>Mehta</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>MEHTA</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 And he also <span>recommended</span> a more <span>recent</span> book, <span>called..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>'Survey</span> <span>Research'</span>, by <span>Bell</span>, I think.<br/>
🎧 It's in that <span>series</span> <span>published</span> by <span>London</span> <span>University</span>.<br/>
🎧 And if we <span>tried</span> to use <span>interviews</span> <span>instead</span>,<br/>
🎧 I saw a book in the <span>departmental</span> <span>library</span> <span>that'll</span> be <span>helpful:</span> it's called <span>'Interviews</span> That <span>Work'</span>,<br/>
🎧 by <span>Wilson</span>, <span>published</span> in <span>Oxford</span> in <span>1988</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I've got a <span>tutorial</span> now.<br/>
🎧 Can we meet up again later this week?<br/>
🎧 What about <span>Friday</span> morning?<br/>
🎧 <span>Suits</span> me. <span>11</span> <span>o'clock</span>?<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 Before <span>Friday</span>, I think we should all look through the <span>reading</span> <span>list</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 So <span>far</span>, in these <span>lectures</span>, we've been looking at <span>crimes</span> like <span>robbery</span> and <span>murder</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 both from a <span>historical</span> <span>viewpoint</span> and also in <span>contemporary</span> <span>society</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and we've <span>seen</span> that the <span>preoccupation</span> in <span>Western</span> <span>society</span> with <span>crime</span> and with <span>lawlessness<br/></span>
🎧 is <span>part</span> of a long and <span>continuous</span> <span>tradition</span>,<br/>
🎧 rather than something which is new and <span>unique</span> to <span>modern</span> <span>society</span>.<br/>
🎧 But over the <span>past</span> <span>seventy</span> years or so, there has been a <span>massive</span> <span>increase</span> in one <span>type</span> of <span>crime</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is what's <span>known</span> as <span>'corporate</span> <span>crime'</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Corporate</span> <span>crime</span> is <span>crime</span> which, as the name <span>suggests</span>,<br/>
🎧 is <span>connected</span> with <span>companies</span>, with <span>business</span> <span>organisations</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>includes</span> <span>illegal</span> <span>acts</span> of either <span>individuals</span> or a <span>group</span> <span>within</span> the <span>company</span>,<br/>
🎧 but what is <span>important</span> is that these <span>acts</span> are <span>normally</span> in <span>accordance</span> with the <span>goals</span> of the <span>company</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 they're for the good of the <span>company</span> rather than the <span>individual</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's been <span>defined</span> as,<br/>
🎧 <span>quote</span>, <span>'crime</span> which is <span>committed</span> for the <span>corporate</span> <span>organisation'</span> <span>-</span> the <span>company</span> <span>-</span> <span>'not</span> <span>against</span> <span>it'</span>, <span>unquote</span>.<br/>
🎧 So <span>crimes</span> like <span>theft</span> by <span>employees</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 things like <span>embezzlement</span> or <span>fraud</span> <span>against</span> <span>one's</span> <span>actual</span> <span>employer</span> are <span>excluded</span> <span>according</span> to this <span>definition</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>employees</span> may be <span>involved<br/></span>
🎧 but they're <span>acting</span> in the first place for the <span>company</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 they may not even <span>realise</span> they're <span>committing</span> a <span>crime<br/></span>
🎧 or they may <span>realise</span> but they feel it's <span>excusable</span> because it's <span>policy</span>,<br/>
🎧 or because <span>otherwise</span> they may <span>lose</span> their <span>jobs</span>.<br/>
🎧 So here, really, we're talking about the <span>links</span> between <span>power</span> and <span>crime</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, this is one <span>area</span> that much less is <span>generally</span> <span>known</span> about than <span>conventional</span> or <span>traditional</span> <span>crime</span>.<br/>
🎧 It has been <span>relatively</span> <span>ignored</span> by the <span>mass</span> <span>media</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 for example, it <span>tends</span> to be <span>under-reported</span> in <span>comparison</span> with <span>conventional</span> <span>crime</span> in <span>news</span> <span>broadcasts</span>,<br/>
🎧 and in <span>crime</span> <span>serials</span> and <span>films</span> and so on <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 they very <span>rarely</span> <span>deal</span> with <span>corporate</span> <span>crime</span>.<br/>
🎧 And it also <span>tends</span> to be <span>ignored</span> in <span>academic</span> <span>circles</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 there's been <span>far</span> more <span>research</span> on <span>conventional</span> <span>crime</span> and <span>far</span> more <span>data</span> is <span>available</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>several</span> <span>reasons</span> for this <span>lack</span> of <span>interest</span> in <span>corporate</span> <span>crime</span>, <span>compared</span> with other <span>types</span> of <span>crime</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's often very <span>complex</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>whereas</span> with <span>conventional</span> <span>crime</span>, it's usually <span>possible</span> to <span>follow</span> what's going on without <span>specialist</span> <span>knowledge</span>.<br/>
🎧 As well as this, <span>whereas</span> <span>conventional</span> <span>crime</span> usually has a lot of <span>human</span> <span>interest</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>corporate</span> <span>crime</span> often has much less.<br/>
🎧 The <span>third</span> <span>reason</span>, and <span>possibly</span> the most <span>significant</span> one,<br/>
🎧 is that very often the <span>victims</span> are <span>unaware</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 they think their <span>misfortune</span> is an <span>accident<br/></span>
🎧 or that it's the <span>fault</span> of <span>no-one</span> in <span>particular</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're <span>unaware</span> that <span>they've</span> been <span>victims</span> of a <span>crime</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, when we look at the <span>effects</span> of <span>corporate</span> <span>crime</span>,<br/>
🎧 we may find it's very <span>difficult</span> to <span>assess</span> the <span>costs</span>.<br/>
🎧 But these <span>costs</span> can be very <span>considerable</span> in both their <span>economic</span> and <span>social</span> <span>aspects</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's look at the <span>economic</span> <span>costs</span> first.<br/>
🎧 For example, if a <span>company</span> is <span>producing</span> <span>fruit</span> <span>juice<br/></span>
🎧 and it <span>dilutes</span> its <span>product</span> so that it's just a little <span>below</span> the <span>concentration</span> it should be,<br/>
🎧 many <span>millions</span> of people may be <span>paying</span> a small <span>amount</span> <span>extra</span> for their <span>carton</span> of <span>orange</span> <span>juice</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now small <span>amounts</span> like this may <span>seem</span> <span>insignificant</span> for <span>individual</span> <span>customers</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 too small to <span>worry</span> about <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 but for the <span>company</span>, this <span>deception</span> might <span>result</span> in <span>massive</span> <span>illegal</span> <span>profit</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, all <span>studies</span> of <span>corporate</span> <span>crime</span> <span>agree<br/></span>
🎧 that the <span>individuals</span> are in <span>fact</span> <span>deprived</span> of <span>far</span> more money by such <span>crime<br/></span>
🎧 than they are by <span>conventional</span> <span>crime</span> like <span>robbery</span> and <span>theft</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>addition</span> to this, we have to <span>consider</span> the <span>social</span> <span>costs</span> of <span>corporate</span> <span>crime<br/></span>
🎧 and these are again very <span>difficult</span> to <span>assess</span>, but they are <span>considerable</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're <span>important</span> because they can <span>undermine</span> the <span>faith</span> of the <span>public</span> in the <span>business</span> <span>world<br/></span>
🎧 and also, more <span>importantly</span>,<br/>
🎧 because the <span>main</span> <span>group</span> of people they <span>affect</span> are, in <span>fact</span>, not the <span>richer</span> <span>sections</span> of <span>society</span> but the <span>poorer</span>.<br/>
🎧 So here <span>companies</span> are <span>robbing</span> the <span>poor</span> to <span>benefit</span> the <span>rich</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are two more <span>points</span> to do with <span>corporate</span> <span>crime<br/></span>
🎧 that I'd like to <span>illustrate</span> with <span>reference</span> to a <span>specific</span> <span>event<br/></span>
🎧 which <span>occurred</span> <span>several</span> years ago.<br/>
🎧 This was an <span>explosion</span> of a <span>large</span> oil <span>tanker<br/></span>
🎧 which <span>caused</span> the <span>loss</span> of more than <span>fifty</span> lives of the <span>crew</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was an <span>explosion</span> which never should have <span>happened<br/></span>
🎧 and a <span>subsequent</span> <span>inquiry</span> <span>laid</span> the <span>blame</span> not on <span>anyone</span> who had actually been on the <span>tanker</span> at the time,<br/>
🎧 but on the <span>owners</span> of the <span>tanker</span>.<br/>
🎧 They had <span>deliberately</span> <span>decided</span> not to <span>carry</span> out <span>necessary</span> <span>repair</span> work on the <span>tanker</span> as it was <span>due</span> to be <span>sold</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it was this <span>lack</span> of <span>repair</span> work which was <span>directly</span> <span>responsible</span> for the <span>explosion</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now this <span>illustrates</span> two <span>points</span> to do with <span>corporate</span> <span>crime</span>.<br/>
🎧 First of all, that it does not have to be <span>intentional</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>owners</span> of the <span>tanker</span> <span>certainly</span> did not <span>intend</span> it to <span>explode</span>.<br/>
🎧 But very <span>serious</span> <span>consequences</span> can <span>result</span> from people or <span>organisations<br/></span>
🎧 not <span>considering</span> the <span>possible</span> <span>results</span> of their <span>actions</span> <span>seriously</span> enough.<br/>
🎧 The <span>main</span> <span>crime</span> here was <span>indifference</span> to the <span>human</span> <span>results<br/></span>
🎧 rather than <span>actual</span> <span>intention</span> to <span>harm</span> <span>anyone</span>,<br/>
🎧 but that didn't make the <span>results</span> any less <span>tragic</span>.<br/>
🎧 And this <span>leads</span> me to my <span>second</span> <span>point<br/></span>
🎧 that <span>corporate</span> <span>crime</span> can have very <span>severe</span> <span>consequences</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's not just a <span>matter</span> of <span>companies</span> <span>making</span> <span>bigger</span> <span>profits</span> than they should do,<br/>
🎧 but of <span>events</span> which may <span>affect</span> the lives of <span>innocent</span> people,<br/>
🎧 and yet very often, <span>companies</span>, because they say they didn't <span>intend</span> to <span>harm</span> <span>anyone</span>,<br/>
🎧 can <span>avoid</span> taking <span>responsibility</span> for the <span>results</span> of their <span>actions</span>.<br/>
🎧 And that has been a very <span>dangerous</span> <span>loophole</span> in the law.<br/>
🎧 A <span>further</span> example of <span>corporate</span> <span>crime</span> <span>was..</span>.<br/>
