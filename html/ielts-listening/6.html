🎧 Oh, Peter</span>, there you are.<br/>
🎧 You've been ages</span>. What kept</span> you so long?<br/>
🎧 I'm sorry I'm so late</span>, Sally</span>.<br/>
🎧 Have you been waiting</span> long?<br/>
🎧 Oh, half</span> an hour</span>.<br/>
🎧 But it doesn't matter</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've had a coffee</span> and I've been reading</span> this guidebook</span> for tourists</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sit down.<br/>
🎧 You look very hot and tired</span>.<br/>
🎧 What would you like to drink?<br/>
🎧 I'd love a really chilled</span> mineral</span> water or something.<br/>
🎧 Will you have another coffee</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I will.<br/>
🎧 The waitress</span> will be back in a moment</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why were you so late</span>?<br/>
🎧 Did something happen</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 You know, I went to the bank</span> to cash</span> some travellers</span> cheques</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, the exchange</span> rate</span> was looking healthy</span>, but..</span>.<br/>
🎧 when I went to the teller</span>, they told me the computer</span> system</span> was temporarily</span> down,<br/>
🎧 so they couldn't do any transactions</span>.<br/>
🎧 They said the problem</span> would be fixed</span> in a few minutes</span>, so I waited</span>.<br/>
🎧 And then I started</span> talking to another guy in the bank</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I forgot</span> the time.<br/>
🎧 Oh, really?<br/>
🎧 Someone</span> you met</span> in the bank</span>?<br/>
🎧 Does he work there?<br/>
🎧 No, he was a tourist</span>, from New York</span>.<br/>
🎧 His name's</span> Henry</span>,<br/>
🎧 and he's been here for a week, but he's moving</span> on to Germany</span> tomorrow</span>.<br/>
🎧 He's an architect</span>,<br/>
🎧 and he's spending four</span> weeks</span> travelling</span> around Europe</span>.<br/>
🎧 Just like us!<br/>
🎧 Yeah, just like us.<br/>
🎧 He told me the names</span> of some places</span> where we should eat.<br/>
🎧 Great food, and not too expensive</span>, he said.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and he also gave me this map of the bus system</span>.<br/>
🎧 He said he didn't need it any more.<br/>
🎧 That's useful.<br/>
🎧 Pity</span> he's moving</span> on tomorrow</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ah, here's the waitress</span>. Let's order.<br/>
🎧 Do you want anything to eat, or shall we just have a drink?<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm hungry</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we've got a lot of sightseeing</span> to do, so let's just have a snack</span> and a drink.<br/>
🎧 Sounds good to me!<br/>
🎧 Well, let's decide what we'll see today.<br/>
🎧 I guess</span> the best place to start is the Cathedral</span>,<br/>
🎧 and then the Castle</span>.<br/>
🎧 What are the opening</span> times</span> for those two?<br/>
🎧 Well, according</span> to this guidebook</span>,<br/>
🎧 the Cathedral</span> is only open from 9:30</span> in the morning until midday</span>.<br/>
🎧 No, hang</span> on.<br/>
🎧 That's the Cathedral</span> Museum</span>.<br/>
🎧 The Cathedral</span> itself</span> is open morning and afternoon</span>.<br/>
🎧 The Castle</span> is just open from one to five</span>,<br/>
🎧 so we can't go there until after lunch.<br/>
🎧 I really want to spend</span> some time in the Art</span> Gallery</span>,<br/>
🎧 because they've</span> got this wonderful painting</span> by Rembrandt</span> that I've always wanted to see.<br/>
🎧 What else should we see?<br/>
🎧 Well, the guidebook</span> says the Botanical</span> Gardens</span> are worth</span> spending some time in,<br/>
🎧 and they're open all day, from eight</span> to six, so we can go there any time.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to go to the Markets</span> near the river</span> too, but..</span>.<br/>
🎧 oh..</span>. no, wait, that's only in the mornings</span>, too.<br/>
🎧 As well as today and tomorrow</span>, we can see some other places</span> on Monday</span>, you know.<br/>
🎧 But I don't think the Markets</span> will be open then</span>: they only open on Thursdays</span>,<br/>
🎧 so we've missed</span> them for this week.<br/>
🎧 Maybe we should go to the Cathedral</span> today<br/></span>
🎧 because it's Sunday</span> tomorrow</span>, and even though it's open every day,<br/>
🎧 it might be more difficult</span> to get in tomorrow</span> because of the church</span> services</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's true</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the Art</span> Gallery</span> isn't open on Sundays</span> at all,<br/>
🎧 so we'll have to go there today.<br/>
🎧 The Castle's</span> open every day except</span> Mondays</span>, so we're okay there,<br/>
🎧 and the Gardens</span> of course only close</span> at night</span>.<br/>
🎧 Are all these places</span> free or do we have to pay to go in?<br/>
🎧 What does the guidebook</span> say?<br/>
🎧 I think there's a charge</span> for all of them except</span> the Botanical</span> Gardens</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and the Markets</span>, of course you don't pay to go in.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Well, it looks like our plan is this:<br/></span>
🎧 we'll go to see the painting</span> you like first, the Rembrandt</span>,<br/>
🎧 then have lunch and go on to the Castle</span> after that, and then the Cathedral</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 It says here that the roof</span> of the Cathedral</span> is really beautiful</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is that right?<br/>
🎧 What I really want to do at the Cathedral</span> is climb</span> the tower</span>.<br/>
🎧 The view</span> is supposed</span> to be spectacular</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, well, that'll</span> be more than enough for today.<br/>
🎧 Then, tomorrow</span>, let's go to the Botanical</span> Gardens</span> and have a picnic</span>.<br/>
🎧 I want to sit by the river</span> and watch</span> the swans</span>.<br/>
🎧 This city's</span> famous for them.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 So the counselling</span> services</span> we offer</span> deal</span> with any problems</span> arising</span> from your studies</span>,<br/>
🎧 or in your life outside the university.<br/>
🎧 Let's take academic</span> counselling</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you're confused</span> about subjects</span> or how to combine</span> them in your degree</span>,<br/>
🎧 then we can advise</span> you and discuss</span> the career</span> you are aiming</span> for,<br/>
🎧 so that you can see it all in context</span>.<br/>
🎧 We can also chase</span> up your tutor</span> if you're not getting proper</span> feedback</span> on how you are getting on in your subject</span>.<br/>
🎧 Besides</span> help with academic</span> problems</span>,<br/>
🎧 you may also need personal counselling:<br/></span>
🎧 if you think you're already under stress</span>,<br/>
🎧 well, just wait till</span> classes</span> begin</span> next week.<br/>
🎧 You'll have to start adjusting</span> to teaching</span> and learning</span> methods</span> that may be unfamiliar</span> to you,<br/>
🎧 as well as the mounting</span> pressure</span> as the deadline</span> for that first assignment</span> creeps</span> up on you.<br/>
🎧 And of course, you have to cope</span> with all this without your usual</span> social</span> network</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 you know, the social</span> contacts</span>, family</span> and friends you could normally</span> rely</span> on for help.<br/>
🎧 All of this causes</span> anxiety</span>.<br/>
🎧 Studying</span> overseas</span> can trigger</span> a personal crisis</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 you may have left</span> a lot of what you might call 'unfinished</span> business'</span> back in your own country</span>,<br/>
🎧 or you may have interrupted</span> personal relationships<br/></span>
🎧 or even sometimes have broken</span> them off to come overseas</span>,<br/>
🎧 and so the student often feels</span> lonely</span>, unhappy</span>, unmotivated<br/></span>
🎧 and unable</span> to concentrate</span> on studying</span>.<br/>
🎧 Or there may be other things bothering</span> you.<br/>
🎧 Our resident</span> chaplain</span> can offer</span> you spiritual</span> guidance</span> if that's what you want,<br/>
🎧 or we can put you in touch with community</span> groups</span> that can provide</span> you with social</span> contacts</span> and friendship</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about exam</span> stress</span>?<br/>
🎧 It affects</span> nearly</span> everyone to some extent</span>,<br/>
🎧 but especially</span> overseas</span> students like yourselves</span>.<br/>
🎧 There may be a huge</span> amount of family</span> pressure</span> on you to succeed</span>,<br/>
🎧 and if you fail</span> a subject</span> or drop</span> out of a course because it's too difficult<br/></span>
🎧 then your self-esteem</span> can suffer</span>.<br/>
🎧 But it's not the end of the world</span> if you don't pass</span> an exam</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 I had to resit</span> First Year Anthropology</span>, so I can certainly</span> offer</span> you a sympathetic</span> ear</span>!<br/>
🎧 Anyway</span>, exam</span> failure</span> can lead</span> to worrying</span> changes in the way you normally</span> behave</span>.<br/>
🎧 You may also be off your food,<br/>
🎧 or you may have dietary</span> problems<br/></span>
🎧 because the local</span> food is not to your liking</span> and upsets</span> you,<br/>
🎧 and this can affect</span> your health</span> and studies</span>.<br/>
🎧 Glenda</span> Roberts</span> is our dietician</span> in the Health</span> Service<br/></span>
🎧 and we can put you on to her.<br/>
🎧 And we all have money problems</span>, don't we?<br/>
🎧 But remember, full-time</span> students can get a low-interest</span> loan</span> of up to six hundred</span> dollars</span> to buy books<br/></span>
🎧 and for similar</span> study-related</span> expenses</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's right,<br/>
🎧 and you can get double</span> that amount if you can't afford</span> an item</span> of equipment</span> you need for your course -<br/></span>
🎧 a musical</span> instrument</span>, for example.<br/>
🎧 And it doesn't stop</span> there.<br/>
🎧 When you move into a flat</span>,<br/>
🎧 starting-up</span> expenses</span>, including</span> furniture</span> for it,<br/>
🎧 can be covered</span> by a loan</span> through the Welfare</span> Service</span>.<br/>
🎧 See Jill</span> Freeman</span> for details</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can we help you?<br/>
🎧 Well, last academic</span> year, in spite</span> of staff</span> cuts</span>,<br/>
🎧 we counselled</span> 240</span> international</span> students for a total</span> of 2600</span> hours counselling</span>,<br/>
🎧 and, finally we won</span> all but just 1</span> of the 12</span> appeals</span> that we launched</span> on behalf</span> of students.<br/>
🎧 Not too bad for an understaffed</span> service</span>, don't you think?<br/>
🎧 That's all from me.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Oh, there you are, good.<br/>
🎧 Sorry, I'm a bit late</span> -</span> there was a long queue</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, have you worked</span> out how to deal</span> with this assignment</span> then?<br/>
🎧 Not yet, we've only been here a couple</span> of minutes</span> ourselves</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can you just remind</span> me what the task</span> is exactly?<br/>
🎧 Well, there are two, no, three</span>, parts</span> to it:<br/></span>
🎧 first, we've got to write</span> an essay</span> about ways</span> of collecting</span> data</span>.<br/>
🎧 What's the title</span> of the essay</span> exactly?<br/>
🎧 I've got it here:<br/></span>
🎧 'Assess</span> the two main</span> methods</span> of collecting</span> data</span> in social</span> science</span> research'</span>.<br/>
🎧 And how much do we need to write</span>?<br/>
🎧 Fifteen</span> hundred</span> words</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's for the essay</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then, for the second part</span> of the assignment</span>, we have to choose one method</span> of data</span> collection</span>,<br/>
🎧 and 'carry</span> out a small-scale</span> study'</span>,<br/>
🎧 'making</span> appropriate</span> use of the method</span> chosen</span> to gather</span> data</span> from at least</span> five</span> subjects'</span>.<br/>
🎧 And then we have to write</span> a report</span> on the study</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's right, of three</span> to four</span> thousand</span> words</span>.<br/>
🎧 Did you get as far</span> as discussing</span> which form</span> of data</span> collection</span> we should go for -<br/></span>
🎧 questionnaire</span> or interview</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I think we should use a questionnaire</span>.<br/>
🎧 It'll be so much less time-consuming</span> than organising</span> interviews</span>, I reckon</span>.<br/>
🎧 Once we've agreed on the wording</span> of it, we only have to send</span> it out and wait for the responses</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I think it probably would be quicker</span>.<br/>
🎧 But what did that article</span> he gave us last week say about the quality</span> of data</span> from questionnaires</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm pretty</span> sure it recommended</span> questionnaires</span> as a source</span> of 'highly</span> reliable</span> data'</span>.<br/>
🎧 As long as you design</span> the questionnaire</span> properly</span> in the first place, the data</span> will be fine.<br/>
🎧 No, I'm sure it talked</span> about drawbacks</span> as well, didn't it?<br/>
🎧 Something about the response</span> rate</span> and the problems</span> you get if it's too low.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, but we only need data</span> from five</span> subjects</span> anyway</span>.<br/>
🎧 I suppose</span> so.<br/>
🎧 Another drawback</span> I remember it mentioned</span> was that<br/></span>
🎧 questionnaire</span> data</span> tends</span> not to reveal</span> anything unexpected</span>, because..</span>.<br/>
🎧 it is limited</span> to the questions</span> fixed</span> in advance</span> by the researcher</span>.<br/>
🎧 Come on, Rosa</span>. This is only a practice.<br/>
🎧 It's not meant</span> to be real</span> research</span>, is it?<br/>
🎧 Well, not sure about that.<br/>
🎧 Maybe I'd better go through the article</span> again, just to be sure.<br/>
🎧 Can you remember what it was called?<br/>
🎧 Sample</span> Surveys</span> in Social</span> Science</span> Research'</span>, I think.<br/>
🎧 By Mehta</span>.<br/>
🎧 MEHTA</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 And he also recommended</span> a more recent</span> book, called..</span>.<br/>
🎧 'Survey</span> Research'</span>, by Bell</span>, I think.<br/>
🎧 It's in that series</span> published</span> by London</span> University</span>.<br/>
🎧 And if we tried</span> to use interviews</span> instead</span>,<br/>
🎧 I saw a book in the departmental</span> library</span> that'll</span> be helpful</span>: it's called 'Interviews</span> That Work'</span>,<br/>
🎧 by Wilson</span>, published</span> in Oxford</span> in 1988</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I've got a tutorial</span> now.<br/>
🎧 Can we meet up again later this week?<br/>
🎧 What about Friday</span> morning?<br/>
🎧 Suits</span> me. 11</span> o'clock</span>?<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 Before Friday</span>, I think we should all look through the reading</span> list</span>.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 So far</span>, in these lectures</span>, we've been looking at crimes</span> like robbery</span> and murder</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 both from a historical</span> viewpoint</span> and also in contemporary</span> society</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 and we've seen</span> that the preoccupation</span> in Western</span> society</span> with crime</span> and with lawlessness<br/></span>
🎧 is part</span> of a long and continuous</span> tradition</span>,<br/>
🎧 rather than something which is new and unique</span> to modern</span> society</span>.<br/>
🎧 But over the past</span> seventy</span> years or so, there has been a massive</span> increase</span> in one type</span> of crime</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is what's known</span> as 'corporate</span> crime'</span>.<br/>
🎧 Corporate</span> crime</span> is crime</span> which, as the name suggests</span>,<br/>
🎧 is connected</span> with companies</span>, with business</span> organisations</span>.<br/>
🎧 It includes</span> illegal</span> acts</span> of either individuals</span> or a group within</span> the company,<br/>
🎧 but what is important is that these acts</span> are normally</span> in accordance</span> with the goals</span> of the company -<br/></span>
🎧 they're for the good of the company rather than the individual</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's been defined</span> as,<br/>
🎧 quote</span>, 'crime</span> which is committed</span> for the corporate</span> organisation'</span> -</span> the company -</span> 'not</span> against</span> it'</span>, unquote</span>.<br/>
🎧 So crimes</span> like theft</span> by employees</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 things like embezzlement</span> or fraud</span> against</span> one's</span> actual</span> employer</span> are excluded</span> according</span> to this definition</span>.<br/>
🎧 The employees</span> may be involved<br/></span>
🎧 but they're acting</span> in the first place for the company -<br/></span>
🎧 they may not even realise</span> they're committing</span> a crime<br/></span>
🎧 or they may realise</span> but they feel it's excusable</span> because it's policy</span>,<br/>
🎧 or because otherwise</span> they may lose</span> their jobs</span>.<br/>
🎧 So here, really, we're talking about the links</span> between power</span> and crime</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, this is one area</span> that much less is generally</span> known</span> about than conventional</span> or traditional</span> crime</span>.<br/>
🎧 It has been relatively</span> ignored</span> by the mass</span> media</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 for example, it tends</span> to be under-reported</span> in comparison</span> with conventional</span> crime</span> in news</span> broadcasts</span>,<br/>
🎧 and in crime</span> serials</span> and films</span> and so on -<br/></span>
🎧 they very rarely</span> deal</span> with corporate</span> crime</span>.<br/>
🎧 And it also tends</span> to be ignored</span> in academic</span> circles</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 there's been far</span> more research</span> on conventional</span> crime</span> and far</span> more data</span> is available</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are several</span> reasons</span> for this lack</span> of interest</span> in corporate</span> crime</span>, compared</span> with other types</span> of crime</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's often very complex</span>,<br/>
🎧 whereas</span> with conventional</span> crime</span>, it's usually possible</span> to follow</span> what's going on without specialist</span> knowledge</span>.<br/>
🎧 As well as this, whereas</span> conventional</span> crime</span> usually has a lot of human</span> interest</span>,<br/>
🎧 corporate</span> crime</span> often has much less.<br/>
🎧 The third</span> reason</span>, and possibly</span> the most significant</span> one,<br/>
🎧 is that very often the victims</span> are unaware</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 they think their misfortune</span> is an accident<br/></span>
🎧 or that it's the fault</span> of no-one</span> in particular</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're unaware</span> that they've</span> been victims</span> of a crime</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, when we look at the effects</span> of corporate</span> crime</span>,<br/>
🎧 we may find it's very difficult</span> to assess</span> the costs</span>.<br/>
🎧 But these costs</span> can be very considerable</span> in both their economic</span> and social</span> aspects</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's look at the economic</span> costs</span> first.<br/>
🎧 For example, if a company is producing</span> fruit</span> juice<br/></span>
🎧 and it dilutes</span> its product so that it's just a little below</span> the concentration</span> it should be,<br/>
🎧 many millions</span> of people may be paying</span> a small amount extra</span> for their carton</span> of orange</span> juice</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now small amounts</span> like this may seem</span> insignificant</span> for individual</span> customers</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 too small to worry</span> about -<br/></span>
🎧 but for the company, this deception</span> might result</span> in massive</span> illegal</span> profit</span>.<br/>
🎧 However</span>, all studies</span> of corporate</span> crime</span> agree<br/></span>
🎧 that the individuals</span> are in fact</span> deprived</span> of far</span> more money by such crime<br/></span>
🎧 than they are by conventional</span> crime</span> like robbery</span> and theft</span>.<br/>
🎧 In addition</span> to this, we have to consider</span> the social</span> costs</span> of corporate</span> crime<br/></span>
🎧 and these are again very difficult</span> to assess</span>, but they are considerable</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're important because they can undermine</span> the faith</span> of the public</span> in the business</span> world<br/></span>
🎧 and also, more importantly</span>,<br/>
🎧 because the main</span> group of people they affect</span> are, in fact</span>, not the richer</span> sections</span> of society</span> but the poorer</span>.<br/>
🎧 So here companies</span> are robbing</span> the poor</span> to benefit</span> the rich</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are two more points</span> to do with corporate</span> crime<br/></span>
🎧 that I'd like to illustrate</span> with reference</span> to a specific</span> event<br/></span>
🎧 which occurred</span> several</span> years ago.<br/>
🎧 This was an explosion</span> of a large oil tanker<br/></span>
🎧 which caused</span> the loss</span> of more than fifty</span> lives of the crew</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was an explosion</span> which never should have happened<br/></span>
🎧 and a subsequent</span> inquiry</span> laid</span> the blame</span> not on anyone</span> who had actually been on the tanker</span> at the time,<br/>
🎧 but on the owners</span> of the tanker</span>.<br/>
🎧 They had deliberately</span> decided</span> not to carry</span> out necessary</span> repair</span> work on the tanker</span> as it was due</span> to be sold</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it was this lack</span> of repair</span> work which was directly</span> responsible</span> for the explosion</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now this illustrates</span> two points</span> to do with corporate</span> crime</span>.<br/>
🎧 First of all, that it does not have to be intentional</span>.<br/>
🎧 The owners</span> of the tanker</span> certainly</span> did not intend</span> it to explode</span>.<br/>
🎧 But very serious consequences</span> can result</span> from people or organisations<br/></span>
🎧 not considering</span> the possible</span> results</span> of their actions</span> seriously</span> enough.<br/>
🎧 The main</span> crime</span> here was indifference</span> to the human</span> results<br/></span>
🎧 rather than actual</span> intention</span> to harm</span> anyone</span>,<br/>
🎧 but that didn't make the results</span> any less tragic</span>.<br/>
🎧 And this leads</span> me to my second point<br/></span>
🎧 that corporate</span> crime</span> can have very severe</span> consequences</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's not just a matter</span> of companies</span> making</span> bigger</span> profits</span> than they should do,<br/>
🎧 but of events</span> which may affect</span> the lives of innocent</span> people,<br/>
🎧 and yet very often, companies</span>, because they say they didn't intend</span> to harm</span> anyone</span>,<br/>
🎧 can avoid</span> taking responsibility</span> for the results</span> of their actions</span>.<br/>
🎧 And that has been a very dangerous</span> loophole</span> in the law.<br/>
🎧 A further</span> example of corporate</span> crime</span> was..</span>.<br/>
