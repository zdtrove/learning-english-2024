🎧 Oh, Peter, there you are.<br/>
🎧 You've been ages. What kept you so long?<br/>
🎧 I'm sorry I'm so late, Sally.<br/>
🎧 Have you been waiting long?<br/>
🎧 Oh, half an hour.<br/>
🎧 But it doesn't matter.<br/>
🎧 I've had a coffee and I've been reading this guidebook for tourists.<br/>
🎧 Sit down.<br/>
🎧 You look very hot and tired.<br/>
🎧 What would you like to drink?<br/>
🎧 I'd love a really chilled mineral water or something.<br/>
🎧 Will you have another coffee?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I will.<br/>
🎧 The waitress will be back in a moment.<br/>
🎧 Why were you so late?<br/>
🎧 Did something happen?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 You know, I went to the bank to cash some travellers cheques?<br/>
🎧 Well, the exchange rate was looking healthy, but...<br/>
🎧 when I went to the teller, they told me the computer system was temporarily down,<br/>
🎧 so they couldn't do any transactions.<br/>
🎧 They said the problem would be fixed in a few minutes, so I waited.<br/>
🎧 And then I started talking to another guy in the bank,<br/>
🎧 and I forgot the time.<br/>
🎧 Oh, really?<br/>
🎧 Someone you met in the bank?<br/>
🎧 Does he work there?<br/>
🎧 No, he was a tourist, from New York.<br/>
🎧 His name's Henry,<br/>
🎧 and he's been here for a week, but he's moving on to Germany tomorrow.<br/>
🎧 He's an architect,<br/>
🎧 and he's spending four weeks travelling around Europe.<br/>
🎧 Just like us!<br/>
🎧 Yeah, just like us.<br/>
🎧 He told me the names of some places where we should eat.<br/>
🎧 Great food, and not too expensive, he said.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and he also gave me this map of the bus system.<br/>
🎧 He said he didn't need it any more.<br/>
🎧 That's useful.<br/>
🎧 Pity he's moving on tomorrow.<br/>
🎧 Ah, here's the waitress. Let's order.<br/>
🎧 Do you want anything to eat, or shall we just have a drink?<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm hungry,<br/>
🎧 and we've got a lot of sightseeing to do, so let's just have a snack and a drink.<br/>
🎧 Sounds good to me!<br/>
🎧 Well, let's decide what we'll see today.<br/>
🎧 I guess the best place to start is the Cathedral,<br/>
🎧 and then the Castle.<br/>
🎧 What are the opening times for those two?<br/>
🎧 Well, according to this guidebook,<br/>
🎧 the Cathedral is only open from 9:30 in the morning until midday.<br/>
🎧 No, hang on.<br/>
🎧 That's the Cathedral Museum.<br/>
🎧 The Cathedral itself is open morning and afternoon.<br/>
🎧 The Castle is just open from one to five,<br/>
🎧 so we can't go there until after lunch.<br/>
🎧 I really want to spend some time in the Art Gallery,<br/>
🎧 because they've got this wonderful painting by Rembrandt that I've always wanted to see.<br/>
🎧 What else should we see?<br/>
🎧 Well, the guidebook says the Botanical Gardens are worth spending some time in,<br/>
🎧 and they're open all day, from eight to six, so we can go there any time.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to go to the Markets near the river too, but...<br/>
🎧 oh... no, wait, that's only in the mornings, too.<br/>
🎧 As well as today and tomorrow, we can see some other places on Monday, you know.<br/>
🎧 But I don't think the Markets will be open then: they only open on Thursdays,<br/>
🎧 so we've missed them for this week.<br/>
🎧 Maybe we should go to the Cathedral today<br/>
🎧 because it's Sunday tomorrow, and even though it's open every day,<br/>
🎧 it might be more difficult to get in tomorrow because of the church services.<br/>
🎧 That's true,<br/>
🎧 but the Art Gallery isn't open on Sundays at all,<br/>
🎧 so we'll have to go there today.<br/>
🎧 The Castle's open every day except Mondays, so we're okay there,<br/>
🎧 and the Gardens of course only close at night.<br/>
🎧 Are all these places free or do we have to pay to go in?<br/>
🎧 What does the guidebook say?<br/>
🎧 I think there's a charge for all of them except the Botanical Gardens.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and the Markets, of course you don't pay to go in.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Well, it looks like our plan is this:<br/>
🎧 we'll go to see the painting you like first, the Rembrandt,<br/>
🎧 then have lunch and go on to the Castle after that, and then the Cathedral.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 It says here that the roof of the Cathedral is really beautiful.<br/>
🎧 Is that right?<br/>
🎧 What I really want to do at the Cathedral is climb the tower.<br/>
🎧 The view is supposed to be spectacular.<br/>
🎧 Okay, well, that'll be more than enough for today.<br/>
🎧 Then, tomorrow, let's go to the Botanical Gardens and have a picnic.<br/>
🎧 I want to sit by the river and watch the swans.<br/>
🎧 This city's famous for them.<br/>

🎧 So the counselling services we offer deal with any problems arising from your studies,<br/>
🎧 or in your life outside the university.<br/>
🎧 Let's take academic counselling.<br/>
🎧 If you're confused about subjects or how to combine them in your degree,<br/>
🎧 then we can advise you and discuss the career you are aiming for,<br/>
🎧 so that you can see it all in context.<br/>
🎧 We can also chase up your tutor if you're not getting proper feedback on how you are getting on in your subject.<br/>
🎧 Besides help with academic problems,<br/>
🎧 you may also need personal counselling:<br/>
🎧 if you think you're already under stress,<br/>
🎧 well, just wait till classes begin next week.<br/>
🎧 You'll have to start adjusting to teaching and learning methods that may be unfamiliar to you,<br/>
🎧 as well as the mounting pressure as the deadline for that first assignment creeps up on you.<br/>
🎧 And of course, you have to cope with all this without your usual social network -<br/>
🎧 you know, the social contacts, family and friends you could normally rely on for help.<br/>
🎧 All of this causes anxiety.<br/>
🎧 Studying overseas can trigger a personal crisis -<br/>
🎧 you may have left a lot of what you might call 'unfinished business' back in your own country,<br/>
🎧 or you may have interrupted personal relationships<br/>
🎧 or even sometimes have broken them off to come overseas,<br/>
🎧 and so the student often feels lonely, unhappy, unmotivated<br/>
🎧 and unable to concentrate on studying.<br/>
🎧 Or there may be other things bothering you.<br/>
🎧 Our resident chaplain can offer you spiritual guidance if that's what you want,<br/>
🎧 or we can put you in touch with community groups that can provide you with social contacts and friendship.<br/>
🎧 What about exam stress?<br/>
🎧 It affects nearly everyone to some extent,<br/>
🎧 but especially overseas students like yourselves.<br/>
🎧 There may be a huge amount of family pressure on you to succeed,<br/>
🎧 and if you fail a subject or drop out of a course because it's too difficult<br/>
🎧 then your self-esteem can suffer.<br/>
🎧 But it's not the end of the world if you don't pass an exam -<br/>
🎧 I had to resit First Year Anthropology, so I can certainly offer you a sympathetic ear!<br/>
🎧 Anyway, exam failure can lead to worrying changes in the way you normally behave.<br/>
🎧 You may also be off your food,<br/>
🎧 or you may have dietary problems<br/>
🎧 because the local food is not to your liking and upsets you,<br/>
🎧 and this can affect your health and studies.<br/>
🎧 Glenda Roberts is our dietician in the Health Service<br/>
🎧 and we can put you on to her.<br/>
🎧 And we all have money problems, don't we?<br/>
🎧 But remember, full-time students can get a low-interest loan of up to six hundred dollars to buy books<br/>
🎧 and for similar study-related expenses.<br/>
🎧 That's right,<br/>
🎧 and you can get double that amount if you can't afford an item of equipment you need for your course -<br/>
🎧 a musical instrument, for example.<br/>
🎧 And it doesn't stop there.<br/>
🎧 When you move into a flat,<br/>
🎧 starting-up expenses, including furniture for it,<br/>
🎧 can be covered by a loan through the Welfare Service.<br/>
🎧 See Jill Freeman for details.<br/>
🎧 Can we help you?<br/>
🎧 Well, last academic year, in spite of staff cuts,<br/>
🎧 we counselled 240 international students for a total of 2600 hours counselling,<br/>
🎧 and, finally we won all but just 1 of the 12 appeals that we launched on behalf of students.<br/>
🎧 Not too bad for an understaffed service, don't you think?<br/>
🎧 That's all from me.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Oh, there you are, good.<br/>
🎧 Sorry, I'm a bit late - there was a long queue.<br/>
🎧 So, have you worked out how to deal with this assignment then?<br/>
🎧 Not yet, we've only been here a couple of minutes ourselves.<br/>
🎧 Can you just remind me what the task is exactly?<br/>
🎧 Well, there are two, no, three, parts to it:<br/>
🎧 first, we've got to write an essay about ways of collecting data.<br/>
🎧 What's the title of the essay exactly?<br/>
🎧 I've got it here:<br/>
🎧 'Assess the two main methods of collecting data in social science research'.<br/>
🎧 And how much do we need to write?<br/>
🎧 Fifteen hundred words.<br/>
🎧 That's for the essay.<br/>
🎧 Then, for the second part of the assignment, we have to choose one method of data collection,<br/>
🎧 and 'carry out a small-scale study',<br/>
🎧 'making appropriate use of the method chosen to gather data from at least five subjects'.<br/>
🎧 And then we have to write a report on the study?<br/>
🎧 That's right, of three to four thousand words.<br/>
🎧 Did you get as far as discussing which form of data collection we should go for -<br/>
🎧 questionnaire or interview, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I think we should use a questionnaire.<br/>
🎧 It'll be so much less time-consuming than organising interviews, I reckon.<br/>
🎧 Once we've agreed on the wording of it, we only have to send it out and wait for the responses.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I think it probably would be quicker.<br/>
🎧 But what did that article he gave us last week say about the quality of data from questionnaires?<br/>
🎧 I'm pretty sure it recommended questionnaires as a source of 'highly reliable data'.<br/>
🎧 As long as you design the questionnaire properly in the first place, the data will be fine.<br/>
🎧 No, I'm sure it talked about drawbacks as well, didn't it?<br/>
🎧 Something about the response rate and the problems you get if it's too low.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, but we only need data from five subjects anyway.<br/>
🎧 I suppose so.<br/>
🎧 Another drawback I remember it mentioned was that<br/>
🎧 questionnaire data tends not to reveal anything unexpected, because...<br/>
🎧 it is limited to the questions fixed in advance by the researcher.<br/>
🎧 Come on, Rosa. This is only a practice.<br/>
🎧 It's not meant to be real research, is it?<br/>
🎧 Well, not sure about that.<br/>
🎧 Maybe I'd better go through the article again, just to be sure.<br/>
🎧 Can you remember what it was called?<br/>
🎧 Sample Surveys in Social Science Research', I think.<br/>
🎧 By Mehta.<br/>
🎧 MEHTA?<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 And he also recommended a more recent book, called...<br/>
🎧 'Survey Research', by Bell, I think.<br/>
🎧 It's in that series published by London University.<br/>
🎧 And if we tried to use interviews instead,<br/>
🎧 I saw a book in the departmental library that'll be helpful: it's called 'Interviews That Work',<br/>
🎧 by Wilson, published in Oxford in 1988.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I've got a tutorial now.<br/>
🎧 Can we meet up again later this week?<br/>
🎧 What about Friday morning?<br/>
🎧 Suits me. 11 o'clock?<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 Before Friday, I think we should all look through the reading list.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 So far, in these lectures, we've been looking at crimes like robbery and murder -<br/>
🎧 both from a historical viewpoint and also in contemporary society -<br/>
🎧 and we've seen that the preoccupation in Western society with crime and with lawlessness<br/>
🎧 is part of a long and continuous tradition,<br/>
🎧 rather than something which is new and unique to modern society.<br/>
🎧 But over the past seventy years or so, there has been a massive increase in one type of crime,<br/>
🎧 which is what's known as 'corporate crime'.<br/>
🎧 Corporate crime is crime which, as the name suggests,<br/>
🎧 is connected with companies, with business organisations.<br/>
🎧 It includes illegal acts of either individuals or a group within the company,<br/>
🎧 but what is important is that these acts are normally in accordance with the goals of the company -<br/>
🎧 they're for the good of the company rather than the individual.<br/>
🎧 It's been defined as,<br/>
🎧 quote, 'crime which is committed for the corporate organisation' - the company - 'not against it', unquote.<br/>
🎧 So crimes like theft by employees -<br/>
🎧 things like embezzlement or fraud against one's actual employer are excluded according to this definition.<br/>
🎧 The employees may be involved<br/>
🎧 but they're acting in the first place for the company -<br/>
🎧 they may not even realise they're committing a crime<br/>
🎧 or they may realise but they feel it's excusable because it's policy,<br/>
🎧 or because otherwise they may lose their jobs.<br/>
🎧 So here, really, we're talking about the links between power and crime.<br/>
🎧 Now, this is one area that much less is generally known about than conventional or traditional crime.<br/>
🎧 It has been relatively ignored by the mass media -<br/>
🎧 for example, it tends to be under-reported in comparison with conventional crime in news broadcasts,<br/>
🎧 and in crime serials and films and so on -<br/>
🎧 they very rarely deal with corporate crime.<br/>
🎧 And it also tends to be ignored in academic circles -<br/>
🎧 there's been far more research on conventional crime and far more data is available.<br/>
🎧 There are several reasons for this lack of interest in corporate crime, compared with other types of crime.<br/>
🎧 It's often very complex,<br/>
🎧 whereas with conventional crime, it's usually possible to follow what's going on without specialist knowledge.<br/>
🎧 As well as this, whereas conventional crime usually has a lot of human interest,<br/>
🎧 corporate crime often has much less.<br/>
🎧 The third reason, and possibly the most significant one,<br/>
🎧 is that very often the victims are unaware -<br/>
🎧 they think their misfortune is an accident<br/>
🎧 or that it's the fault of no-one in particular.<br/>
🎧 They're unaware that they've been victims of a crime.<br/>
🎧 So, when we look at the effects of corporate crime,<br/>
🎧 we may find it's very difficult to assess the costs.<br/>
🎧 But these costs can be very considerable in both their economic and social aspects.<br/>
🎧 Let's look at the economic costs first.<br/>
🎧 For example, if a company is producing fruit juice<br/>
🎧 and it dilutes its product so that it's just a little below the concentration it should be,<br/>
🎧 many millions of people may be paying a small amount extra for their carton of orange juice.<br/>
🎧 Now small amounts like this may seem insignificant for individual customers -<br/>
🎧 too small to worry about -<br/>
🎧 but for the company, this deception might result in massive illegal profit.<br/>
🎧 However, all studies of corporate crime agree<br/>
🎧 that the individuals are in fact deprived of far more money by such crime<br/>
🎧 than they are by conventional crime like robbery and theft.<br/>
🎧 In addition to this, we have to consider the social costs of corporate crime<br/>
🎧 and these are again very difficult to assess, but they are considerable.<br/>
🎧 They're important because they can undermine the faith of the public in the business world<br/>
🎧 and also, more importantly,<br/>
🎧 because the main group of people they affect are, in fact, not the richer sections of society but the poorer.<br/>
🎧 So here companies are robbing the poor to benefit the rich.<br/>
🎧 There are two more points to do with corporate crime<br/>
🎧 that I'd like to illustrate with reference to a specific event<br/>
🎧 which occurred several years ago.<br/>
🎧 This was an explosion of a large oil tanker<br/>
🎧 which caused the loss of more than fifty lives of the crew.<br/>
🎧 It was an explosion which never should have happened<br/>
🎧 and a subsequent inquiry laid the blame not on anyone who had actually been on the tanker at the time,<br/>
🎧 but on the owners of the tanker.<br/>
🎧 They had deliberately decided not to carry out necessary repair work on the tanker as it was due to be sold,<br/>
🎧 and it was this lack of repair work which was directly responsible for the explosion.<br/>
🎧 Now this illustrates two points to do with corporate crime.<br/>
🎧 First of all, that it does not have to be intentional.<br/>
🎧 The owners of the tanker certainly did not intend it to explode.<br/>
🎧 But very serious consequences can result from people or organisations<br/>
🎧 not considering the possible results of their actions seriously enough.<br/>
🎧 The main crime here was indifference to the human results<br/>
🎧 rather than actual intention to harm anyone,<br/>
🎧 but that didn't make the results any less tragic.<br/>
🎧 And this leads me to my second point<br/>
🎧 that corporate crime can have very severe consequences.<br/>
🎧 It's not just a matter of companies making bigger profits than they should do,<br/>
🎧 but of events which may affect the lives of innocent people,<br/>
🎧 and yet very often, companies, because they say they didn't intend to harm anyone,<br/>
🎧 can avoid taking responsibility for the results of their actions.<br/>
🎧 And that has been a very dangerous loophole in the law.<br/>
🎧 A further example of corporate crime was...<br/>
<br/><br/>
