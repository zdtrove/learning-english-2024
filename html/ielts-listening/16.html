🎧 <span>Conference</span> <span>Centre</span> <span>Reservations</span>. Good morning.<br/>
🎧 Hi. I'm interested in the <span>computing</span> <span>conference</span> next month.<br/>
🎧 Future <span>Directions</span> in <span>Computing</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's right.<br/>
🎧 Could I ask you a few <span>questions</span> about it?<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 I know the <span>conference</span> is for <span>three</span> <span>days<br/></span>
🎧 but actually I want to <span>attend</span> on the <span>Friday</span> and <span>Saturday</span> only.<br/>
🎧 Will that work out to be any <span>cheaper</span>?<br/>
🎧 Let me have a look.<br/>
🎧 Well, you could <span>register</span> for the two <span>days</span> <span>separately</span>,<br/>
🎧 but that wouldn't actually <span>save</span> you very <span>much<br/></span>
🎧 as it still <span>costs</span> <span>£35</span> for each day.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, if you could <span>register</span> for the <span>three</span> <span>days</span>,<br/>
🎧 you also get an <span>invitation</span> to a free dinner on the <span>Saturday</span> <span>night</span>,<br/>
🎧 so that's probably the better option.<br/>
🎧 Right, I'll do that.<br/>
🎧 How much will the <span>fees</span> be in that case?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>£75</span>.<br/>
🎧 All right.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to <span>register</span> for the full <span>three</span> <span>days</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, can I pay that by <span>credit</span> <span>card</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>afraid</span> not.<br/>
🎧 You'll have to <span>send</span> a <span>cheque</span> to us,<br/>
🎧 or you can pay at the <span>conference</span> <span>office</span>.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 So it's probably <span>easiest</span> if I pay by <span>cheque</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now then, what else do I need to <span>arrange</span>?<br/>
🎧 Right. How about <span>accommodation</span>?<br/>
🎧 I <span>guess</span> that's not <span>included</span> in the <span>price</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, I'm sorry, it's not,<br/>
🎧 but we do have a few <span>rooms</span> <span>available</span> for <span>delegates</span> at the <span>conference</span> <span>centre</span> if you'd like.<br/>
🎧 Those are very <span>cheap</span> but if you're interested you'll need to book soon,<br/>
🎧 because there's always a <span>heavy</span> <span>demand</span> for them.<br/>
🎧 They are only <span>£15</span> <span>per</span> <span>night</span>,<br/>
🎧 but they are very <span>basic</span> and you'd have to get your own <span>breakfast</span>,<br/>
🎧 because they don't <span>provide</span> you with that.<br/>
🎧 But it's very <span>convenient</span>,<br/>
🎧 because it's in the same <span>building</span> as the <span>conference</span> <span>rooms</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Uhuh</span>.<br/>
🎧 Or there's a very <span>reasonable</span> <span>guest</span> house which is <span>£25</span> <span>per</span> <span>night</span>.<br/>
🎧 And I think that <span>includes</span> your <span>breakfast</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is it <span>close</span> to the <span>conference</span> <span>centre</span>?<br/>
🎧 It would be about a <span>ten-minute</span> <span>walk</span> away from here.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 That sounds quite <span>reasonable</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>details</span> are all in our <span>conference</span> <span>pack</span>, which I'll <span>send</span> you.<br/>
🎧 Great, thanks.<br/>
🎧 <span>That'll</span> be very useful.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and can you also <span>send</span> me an <span>application</span> <span>form</span>?<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 I'll get that in the <span>post</span> to you <span>straight</span> away.<br/>
🎧 Is there anything else?<br/>
🎧 Yes, actually.<br/>
🎧 Can you tell me where exactly the <span>conference</span> <span>centre</span> is?<br/>
🎧 Well, it's on <span>South</span> <span>Park</span> <span>Road</span> and it's right at the end of the <span>road</span> next to the <span>library</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>ten-minute</span> <span>taxi</span> <span>ride</span> from the <span>station<br/></span>
🎧 and will <span>cost</span> you <span>£5</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Otherwise</span>, you can take the bus which <span>runs</span> every <span>half</span> an <span>hour</span> from the <span>station</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's the <span>21A</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it <span>brings</span> you <span>straight</span> to the <span>conference</span> <span>centre</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, got that.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Good morning and <span>welcome</span>, <span>everybody</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>Jenny</span> <span>Stewart<br/></span>
🎧 and I'm the <span>Staff</span> <span>Manager</span> here at the <span>exhibition</span> <span>centre</span>.<br/>
🎧 We're <span>expecting</span> this <span>year's</span> <span>International</span> Travel <span>Exhibition<br/></span>
🎧 to <span>attract</span> over <span>10,000</span> <span>visitors</span> a day, <span>ladies</span> and <span>gentlemen</span>,<br/>
🎧 and you are <span>among</span> the <span>200</span> <span>extra</span> <span>staff</span> <span>recruited</span> to help look after them.<br/>
🎧 Now, to help things run <span>smoothly</span>,<br/>
🎧 we have <span>divided</span> you into <span>four</span> <span>teams</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>blue</span> <span>team</span>, the <span>green</span> <span>team</span>, the red <span>team</span>, and the <span>yellow</span> <span>team</span>.<br/>
🎧 So first, I'll <span>explain</span> how the <span>teams</span> are <span>divided</span> up,<br/>
🎧 and then we'll be <span>giving</span> you <span>colour-coded</span> <span>T-shirts</span> so we can <span>identify</span> you more <span>easily</span>.<br/>
🎧 First of all, those who will be looking after the <span>phones<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>handling</span> all <span>calls</span> <span>regarding</span> the <span>exhibition</span>,<br/>
🎧 you will be on the red <span>team</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, we've also put the <span>entrance</span> <span>staff</span> on the red <span>team<br/></span>
🎧 and you'll be <span>stamping</span> the <span>entrance</span> <span>tickets</span> and <span>giving</span> out <span>publicity</span> <span>leaflets</span>, okay?<br/>
🎧 Those of you <span>involved</span> in <span>distributing</span> <span>entrance</span> <span>tickets</span> will be on the <span>yellow</span> <span>team<br/></span>
🎧 and we've also put those of you who'll be <span>staffing</span> the <span>information</span> <span>booths</span> around the <span>conference</span> <span>centre</span> on the <span>yellow</span> <span>team</span>, <span>so..</span>.<br/>
🎧 you'll be getting a <span>yellow</span> <span>T-shirt</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, most of the <span>hospitality</span> <span>staff</span> have been put in the <span>blue</span> <span>team</span>,<br/>
🎧 so the <span>chefs</span> <span>among</span> you and the <span>kitchen</span> <span>hands</span> will all need a <span>blue</span> <span>T-shirt</span>, <span>but..</span>.<br/>
🎧 because of the <span>sheer</span> <span>numbers</span>,<br/>
🎧 all <span>waiting</span> <span>staff</span> will be on the <span>yellow</span> <span>team</span>,<br/>
🎧 and this <span>includes</span> the <span>bar</span> <span>staff</span> <span>among</span> you.<br/>
🎧 Those who will be <span>monitoring</span> and <span>directing</span> the <span>traffic</span> in the car <span>parks</span> are on the <span>green</span> <span>team</span>,<br/>
🎧 so you'll need to get a <span>green</span> <span>T-shirt</span>.<br/>
🎧 This year, we've also <span>employed</span> a <span>considerable</span> number of <span>attendants<br/></span>
🎧 to <span>direct</span> the <span>human</span> <span>traffic</span> around the <span>conference</span> <span>centre</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, you'll be working in the <span>exhibition</span> <span>hall</span> at all <span>times</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>giving</span> <span>directions</span> and <span>generally</span> <span>helping</span> people <span>whenever</span> you can,<br/>
🎧 and you will be in the red <span>team</span>, so please <span>collect</span> a red <span>T-shirt</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, now that everyone <span>knows</span> what <span>team</span> they're in,<br/>
🎧 we'll get on with the <span>orientation</span> and <span>training</span> <span>programme<br/></span>
🎧 and first, I'll run through the <span>rest</span> of <span>today's</span> <span>programme</span>,<br/>
🎧 which you should have in <span>front</span> of you,<br/>
🎧 so that you can get a <span>general</span> idea of what else is in <span>store</span> today.<br/>
🎧 This <span>introduction</span> <span>finishes</span> at <span>9.30<br/></span>
🎧 and then you'll be <span>hearing</span> from <span>Anne</span> <span>Smith</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anne</span> <span>works</span> in the <span>accounts</span> <span>department</span> on <span>level</span> <span>two<br/></span>
🎧 and she looks after all <span>temporary</span> <span>staff</span>,<br/>
🎧 and so she is the person to see if you have any <span>problems</span> <span>regarding</span> pay.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anne</span> will be <span>explaining</span> when and how you get this.<br/>
🎧 She will also be <span>handing</span> out your <span>tax</span> <span>forms</span>.<br/>
🎧 And I will just <span>stress</span> that all <span>tax</span> <span>forms</span> must be <span>completed<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>returned</span> to <span>Anne</span> before your pay can be <span>processed</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Following</span> <span>Anne's</span> talk you'll hear from <span>Peter</span> <span>Chen</span>, our <span>Conference</span> <span>Manager</span>,<br/>
🎧 and he will be going over a plan of the <span>conference</span> <span>centre</span> with you,<br/>
🎧 which will help you to <span>orient</span> <span>yourselves</span>.<br/>
🎧 He will also go through the <span>security</span> <span>arrangements</span> with <span>you<br/></span>
🎧 and show you the <span>fire</span> <span>exits</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then at <span>10.30</span>,<br/>
🎧 there will be a <span>coffee</span> <span>break</span> in the <span>staff</span> <span>canteen</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is <span>located</span> down on the <span>ground</span> <span>floor</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, after the <span>break</span>,<br/>
🎧 we'll be <span>moving</span> to a different <span>location</span> for a <span>video</span> <span>presentation</span>,<br/>
🎧 so <span>instead</span> of <span>coming</span> back here,<br/>
🎧 we'd like you all to go to <span>Lecture</span> Room <span>311</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll find it on this same <span>level</span>, just down the <span>hall</span>,<br/>
🎧 and there you will be <span>shown</span> a <span>video</span> about important <span>safety</span> issues in the <span>workplace</span>,<br/>
🎧 called <span>Safety</span> at Work.<br/>
🎧 We'll <span>finish</span> off the morning with lunch,<br/>
🎧 which should give everyone a <span>chance</span> to meet and get to know each other,<br/>
🎧 and we'll be <span>serving</span> you a <span>buffet</span> lunch in the <span>Main</span> <span>Hall</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is on the first <span>floor</span>, from <span>12.00</span> <span>o'clock</span>.<br/>
🎧 After lunch, you'll be <span>divided</span> up into your <span>teams</span> to meet your <span>team</span> <span>leaders<br/></span>
🎧 and we're <span>hoping</span> to be all <span>finished</span> by <span>3.00</span>, <span>so..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I won't <span>delay</span> you any <span>longer..</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Good <span>afternoon</span>. Can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Good <span>afternoon</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I've just <span>transferred</span> to the School of <span>Education</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I'd like <span>information</span> about <span>joining</span> the <span>library</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, the School of <span>Education</span> has <span>libraries</span> on two <span>sites</span>, as I'm sure you know.<br/>
🎧 This one here is the <span>Fordham</span> <span>Site</span>, and the other is on <span>Castle</span> <span>Road</span>.<br/>
🎧 And is there any <span>difference</span> between the two <span>libraries</span>?<br/>
🎧 Not in <span>terms</span> of their <span>facilities</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Access</span> to online <span>databases</span> and the <span>Internet</span> is <span>available</span> at both <span>sites<br/></span>
🎧 and each <span>site</span> has a <span>range</span> of <span>reference</span> <span>materials</span> on <span>education</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes. I see.<br/>
🎧 But the <span>Castle</span> <span>Road</span> <span>site</span> has books on the <span>sociology</span> of <span>education<br/></span>
🎧 and a <span>collection</span> of <span>textbooks</span> and <span>teaching</span> <span>resources<br/></span>
🎧 <span>covering</span> most of the <span>subjects</span> <span>taught</span> in <span>secondary</span> <span>schools</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ah, right,<br/>
🎧 but I'm <span>training</span> to be a <span>primary</span> <span>teacher<br/></span>
🎧 so I need to look at <span>materials</span> for the <span>five</span> to <span>eleven</span> age group.<br/>
🎧 Then you've come to the right place.<br/>
🎧 At <span>Fordham</span> we <span>hold</span> <span>material</span> <span>relating</span> to <span>primary</span> <span>education</span>,<br/>
🎧 as well as special needs,<br/>
🎧 but of course you'll need to <span>familiarise</span> yourself with both <span>sites</span> to make the most of our <span>resources</span>.<br/>
🎧 You haven't <span>mentioned</span> <span>periodicals</span>.<br/>
🎧 Are they <span>held</span> at both <span>sites</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Current</span> issues, yes but if you want to look at back <span>issues<br/></span>
🎧 you'll need to use the <span>CD-ROM</span> <span>databases</span> which are <span>held</span> here at <span>Fordham</span>.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 Now, about <span>borrowing</span> books.<br/>
🎧 I'm living out of <span>town</span>, so I'm <span>hoping</span> I can <span>borrow</span> quite a few <span>items</span>,<br/>
🎧 and cut down on the number of <span>trips</span> I have to make.<br/>
🎧 Right, well, <span>members</span> can <span>borrow</span> two books at a time from each <span>site</span>.<br/>
🎧 Only two books?<br/>
🎧 Only two from each <span>site</span>, but that's <span>four</span> <span>altogether</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh I see,<br/>
🎧 and how long can I <span>hang</span> on to them for?<br/>
🎧 The <span>borrowing</span> <span>period</span> is one month, but of course books can be <span>renewed</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can <span>renew</span> any <span>item</span> a <span>maximum</span> of <span>three</span> <span>times</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do I have to come to the <span>library</span> to do that?<br/>
🎧 No, you can do it by <span>telephone</span> or <span>email</span>,<br/>
🎧 but you can't <span>renew</span> <span>overdue</span> books this way,<br/>
🎧 only before or on the <span>due</span> date <span>stamped</span> in the book.<br/>
🎧 We'll need your full name, your <span>borrower</span> <span>number<br/></span>
🎧 and the name of the <span>site</span> <span>library</span> you <span>borrowed</span> the <span>items</span> from.<br/>
🎧 So <span>theoretically</span> I can <span>borrow</span> books for up to <span>three</span> <span>months</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 is that what you're saying?<br/>
🎧 Yes, <span>provided</span> they're not <span>recalled</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, what <span>happens</span> then?<br/>
🎧 Well, sometimes an <span>item</span> is <span>requested</span> by another <span>borrower</span>,<br/>
🎧 in which case we'd <span>send</span> you a <span>letter</span>,<br/>
🎧 and you'd have to <span>return</span> the book <span>within</span> <span>seven</span> working <span>days</span>.<br/>
🎧 Don't <span>forget</span> we're <span>closed</span> on <span>Sundays</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 I <span>expect</span> it'll take me a while to find what I need.<br/>
🎧 There's such a lot here.<br/>
🎧 Yes, there is,<br/>
🎧 but if you need help getting <span>started</span>,<br/>
🎧 this <span>term</span> we're <span>running</span> <span>three</span> <span>study</span> <span>skills</span> <span>workshops</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh?<br/>
🎧 What are they on?<br/>
🎧 <span>Er</span>, let me see.<br/>
🎧 The first <span>one's</span> on <span>resources..</span>.<br/>
🎧 yes, here it is.<br/>
🎧 How to use the <span>library's</span> <span>resources</span>.<br/>
🎧 That <span>includes</span> everything, not just the <span>print</span> and <span>technical</span> <span>resources</span>.<br/>
🎧 That sounds useful.<br/>
🎧 Is there anything on <span>using</span> the <span>Internet</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Er</span>, let's see.<br/>
🎧 The one on the <span>Internet</span> for <span>beginners</span> was last <span>term</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>term</span> it's <span>finding</span> <span>research</span> <span>materials</span> online.<br/>
🎧 That sounds <span>interesting</span> too,<br/>
🎧 <span>hm</span>, what's the last one?<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>workshop</span> on <span>dissertations</span>.<br/>
🎧 What do you mean? how to <span>write</span> one?<br/>
🎧 <span>Er</span>, no it's more to do with <span>academic</span> <span>writing</span> <span>conventions</span>,<br/>
🎧 you know, <span>writing</span> a <span>bibliography</span> and how to <span>refer</span> to <span>sources</span> in your <span>text</span>.<br/>
🎧 That <span>sort</span> of thing.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, here's a <span>leaflet</span> with <span>information</span> about all <span>three</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks a lot.<br/>
🎧 <span>That'll</span> be very useful.<br/>
🎧 You're <span>welcome</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Well, most people think that <span>lions</span> only come from <span>Africa</span>.<br/>
🎧 And you would be <span>forgiven</span> for thinking this,<br/>
🎧 because in <span>fact</span>, most <span>lions</span> do come from <span>Africa</span>.<br/>
🎧 But this hasn't always been the case.<br/>
🎧 If we go back <span>10,000</span> years, we would find that there were <span>lions</span> <span>roaming</span> <span>vast</span> <span>sections</span> of the <span>globe</span>.<br/>
🎧 But now, <span>unfortunately</span>,<br/>
🎧 only very small <span>sections</span> of the <span>lions'</span> <span>former</span> <span>habitat</span> <span>remain</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>particular</span> <span>interest</span> is <span>Asiatic</span> <span>lions</span>,<br/>
🎧 which are a <span>sub-species</span> of <span>African</span> <span>lions</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's almost <span>100,000</span> years since the <span>Asiatic</span> <span>lions</span> <span>split</span> off and <span>developed</span> as a <span>sub-species</span>.<br/>
🎧 At one time the <span>Asiatic</span> <span>lion</span> was living as <span>far</span> <span>west</span> as <span>Greece<br/></span>
🎧 and they were <span>found</span> from there,<br/>
🎧 in a <span>band</span> that <span>spread</span> <span>east</span> through <span>various</span> <span>countries</span> of the <span>Middle</span> <span>East</span>,<br/>
🎧 all the way to <span>India</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>museums</span>, you can now see <span>Greek</span> <span>coins</span> that have <span>clear</span> <span>images</span> of the <span>Asiatic</span> <span>lion</span> on them.<br/>
🎧 Most of them are <span>dated</span> at around <span>500</span> <span>B.C</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, <span>Europe</span> saw its last <span>Asiatic</span> <span>lion</span> <span>roaming</span> free <span>2000</span> years ago.<br/>
🎧 Over the next <span>nineteen</span> <span>hundred</span> years the <span>numbers</span> of <span>Asiatic</span> <span>lions</span> in the other <span>areas</span> <span>declined</span> <span>steadily</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it was only in the <span>nineteenth</span> <span>century</span> that they <span>disappeared</span> from <span>everywhere</span> but <span>India</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, how can you tell an <span>Asiatic</span> <span>lion</span> from an <span>African</span> <span>lion</span>,<br/>
🎧 with which you're probably more <span>familiar</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, in <span>general</span>, <span>Asiatic</span> <span>lions</span> are not as big as <span>African</span> <span>lions</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>colour</span> is more or less the same, but the <span>appearance</span> of the <span>mane</span> is different <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 that's the <span>hair</span> around the <span>lion's</span> <span>face</span> and <span>neck</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Asiatic</span> <span>lion's</span> <span>mane</span> is <span>noticeably</span> <span>shorter</span> than the <span>African</span> <span>lion's</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Asiatic</span> <span>lions</span> also have a long <span>fold</span> of <span>skin</span> on their <span>undersides</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>whereas</span> not many <span>African</span> <span>lions</span> have this.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'd like to talk to you now about the <span>Gir</span> <span>Sanctuary</span> in <span>India</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's where I've just come back from.<br/>
🎧 The <span>sanctuary</span> was <span>established</span> <span>specifically</span> to <span>protect</span> the <span>Asiatic</span> <span>lion</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>1.450</span> <span>square</span> <span>kilometres</span> in <span>area</span> and most of it is <span>forest</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are now around <span>300</span> <span>Asiatic</span> <span>lions</span> in <span>India<br/></span>
🎧 and almost all of them are in this <span>sanctuary</span>.<br/>
🎧 But <span>despite</span> living in a <span>sanctuary</span>, which makes them <span>safe</span> from <span>hunters</span>,<br/>
🎧 they still <span>face</span> a number of <span>problems</span> that <span>threaten</span> their <span>survival</span>.<br/>
🎧 One of these is the <span>ever-present</span> <span>danger</span> of <span>disease</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is what <span>killed</span> more than a <span>third</span> of <span>Africa's</span> <span>Serengeti</span> <span>lions</span> in <span>1994</span>,<br/>
🎧 and people are <span>fearful</span> that something <span>similar</span> could <span>happen</span> in the <span>Gir</span> <span>Sanctuary<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>kill</span> off many of the <span>Asiatic</span> <span>lions</span> there.<br/>
🎧 <span>India's</span> <span>lions</span> are <span>particularly</span> <span>vulnerable</span> because they have a <span>limited</span> <span>gene</span> <span>pool</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>reason</span> for this is <span>interesting</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it's because all of them are <span>descended</span> from a few <span>dozen</span> <span>lions</span> that were <span>saved</span> by a <span>prince<br/></span>
🎧 who took a <span>particular</span> <span>interest</span> in them.<br/>
🎧 He was very <span>wealthy</span>, and he <span>managed</span> to <span>protect</span> them <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>otherwise</span> they'd probably have <span>died</span> out <span>completely</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you see the <span>Asiatic</span> <span>lion</span> in <span>India</span>,<br/>
🎧 what you <span>sense</span> is <span>enormous</span> <span>vitality</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're very <span>impressive</span> <span>beasts<br/></span>
🎧 and you would never <span>guess</span> that they had this <span>vulnerability</span> when you look at them.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Asiatic</span> <span>lions</span> don't have the <span>Gir</span> <span>Sanctuary</span> to <span>themselves</span>, I should add.<br/>
🎧 They actually share it with about <span>2000</span> <span>farmers</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>significant</span> <span>proportion</span> of the <span>lions'</span> <span>diet</span> is made up of the <span>livestock</span> of these <span>farmers</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>goats</span>, <span>chickens</span> and so on <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 as much as a <span>third</span>, in <span>fact</span>.<br/>
🎧 And <span>they've</span> even been <span>known</span> to <span>attack</span> <span>humans</span>, <span>especially</span> in <span>times</span> of <span>drought</span>.<br/>
🎧 One <span>final</span> <span>piece</span> of <span>interesting</span> <span>information</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 in <span>ancient</span> <span>India</span>, one of the <span>greatest</span> <span>tests</span> of <span>leadership</span> for a man was to <span>fight</span> a <span>lion</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now it <span>seems</span>, in <span>modern</span> <span>India</span> it will be a great <span>test</span> to see if the <span>lion</span> can be <span>saved</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure this is something that all of you will share <span>concern</span> for too.<br/>
