🎧 Conference Centre Reservations. Good morning.<br/>
🎧 Hi. I'm interested in the computing conference next month.<br/>
🎧 Future Directions in Computing?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's right.<br/>
🎧 Could I ask you a few questions about it?<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 I know the conference is for three days<br/>
🎧 but actually I want to attend on the Friday and Saturday only.<br/>
🎧 Will that work out to be any cheaper?<br/>
🎧 Let me have a look.<br/>
🎧 Well, you could register for the two days separately,<br/>
🎧 but that wouldn't actually save you very much<br/>
🎧 as it still costs £35 for each day.<br/>
🎧 In fact, if you could register for the three days,<br/>
🎧 you also get an invitation to a free dinner on the Saturday night,<br/>
🎧 so that's probably the better option.<br/>
🎧 Right, I'll do that.<br/>
🎧 How much will the fees be in that case?<br/>
🎧 It's £75.<br/>
🎧 All right.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to register for the full three days.<br/>
🎧 Now, can I pay that by credit card?<br/>
🎧 I'm afraid not.<br/>
🎧 You'll have to send a cheque to us,<br/>
🎧 or you can pay at the conference office.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 So it's probably easiest if I pay by cheque.<br/>
🎧 Now then, what else do I need to arrange?<br/>
🎧 Right. How about accommodation?<br/>
🎧 I guess that's not included in the price?<br/>
🎧 No, I'm sorry, it's not,<br/>
🎧 but we do have a few rooms available for delegates at the conference centre if you'd like.<br/>
🎧 Those are very cheap but if you're interested you'll need to book soon,<br/>
🎧 because there's always a heavy demand for them.<br/>
🎧 They are only £15 per night,<br/>
🎧 but they are very basic and you'd have to get your own breakfast,<br/>
🎧 because they don't provide you with that.<br/>
🎧 But it's very convenient,<br/>
🎧 because it's in the same building as the conference rooms.<br/>
🎧 Uhuh.<br/>
🎧 Or there's a very reasonable guest house which is £25 per night.<br/>
🎧 And I think that includes your breakfast.<br/>
🎧 Is it close to the conference centre?<br/>
🎧 It would be about a ten-minute walk away from here.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 That sounds quite reasonable.<br/>
🎧 The details are all in our conference pack, which I'll send you.<br/>
🎧 Great, thanks.<br/>
🎧 That'll be very useful.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and can you also send me an application form?<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 I'll get that in the post to you straight away.<br/>
🎧 Is there anything else?<br/>
🎧 Yes, actually.<br/>
🎧 Can you tell me where exactly the conference centre is?<br/>
🎧 Well, it's on South Park Road and it's right at the end of the road next to the library.<br/>
🎧 It's a ten-minute taxi ride from the station<br/>
🎧 and will cost you £5.<br/>
🎧 Otherwise, you can take the bus which runs every half an hour from the station,<br/>
🎧 that's the 21A,<br/>
🎧 and it brings you straight to the conference centre.<br/>
🎧 Right, got that.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Good morning and welcome, everybody.<br/>
🎧 I'm Jenny Stewart<br/>
🎧 and I'm the Staff Manager here at the exhibition centre.<br/>
🎧 We're expecting this year's International Travel Exhibition<br/>
🎧 to attract over 10,000 visitors a day, ladies and gentlemen,<br/>
🎧 and you are among the 200 extra staff recruited to help look after them.<br/>
🎧 Now, to help things run smoothly,<br/>
🎧 we have divided you into four teams -<br/>
🎧 the blue team, the green team, the red team, and the yellow team.<br/>
🎧 So first, I'll explain how the teams are divided up,<br/>
🎧 and then we'll be giving you colour-coded T-shirts so we can identify you more easily.<br/>
🎧 First of all, those who will be looking after the phones<br/>
🎧 and handling all calls regarding the exhibition,<br/>
🎧 you will be on the red team.<br/>
🎧 Now, we've also put the entrance staff on the red team<br/>
🎧 and you'll be stamping the entrance tickets and giving out publicity leaflets, okay?<br/>
🎧 Those of you involved in distributing entrance tickets will be on the yellow team<br/>
🎧 and we've also put those of you who'll be staffing the information booths around the conference centre on the yellow team, so...<br/>
🎧 you'll be getting a yellow T-shirt.<br/>
🎧 Now, most of the hospitality staff have been put in the blue team,<br/>
🎧 so the chefs among you and the kitchen hands will all need a blue T-shirt, but...<br/>
🎧 because of the sheer numbers,<br/>
🎧 all waiting staff will be on the yellow team,<br/>
🎧 and this includes the bar staff among you.<br/>
🎧 Those who will be monitoring and directing the traffic in the car parks are on the green team,<br/>
🎧 so you'll need to get a green T-shirt.<br/>
🎧 This year, we've also employed a considerable number of attendants<br/>
🎧 to direct the human traffic around the conference centre.<br/>
🎧 Now, you'll be working in the exhibition hall at all times,<br/>
🎧 giving directions and generally helping people whenever you can,<br/>
🎧 and you will be in the red team, so please collect a red T-shirt.<br/>
🎧 Right, now that everyone knows what team they're in,<br/>
🎧 we'll get on with the orientation and training programme<br/>
🎧 and first, I'll run through the rest of today's programme,<br/>
🎧 which you should have in front of you,<br/>
🎧 so that you can get a general idea of what else is in store today.<br/>
🎧 This introduction finishes at 9.30<br/>
🎧 and then you'll be hearing from Anne Smith.<br/>
🎧 Anne works in the accounts department on level two<br/>
🎧 and she looks after all temporary staff,<br/>
🎧 and so she is the person to see if you have any problems regarding pay.<br/>
🎧 Anne will be explaining when and how you get this.<br/>
🎧 She will also be handing out your tax forms.<br/>
🎧 And I will just stress that all tax forms must be completed<br/>
🎧 and returned to Anne before your pay can be processed.<br/>
🎧 Following Anne's talk you'll hear from Peter Chen, our Conference Manager,<br/>
🎧 and he will be going over a plan of the conference centre with you,<br/>
🎧 which will help you to orient yourselves.<br/>
🎧 He will also go through the security arrangements with you<br/>
🎧 and show you the fire exits.<br/>
🎧 Then at 10.30,<br/>
🎧 there will be a coffee break in the staff canteen,<br/>
🎧 which is located down on the ground floor.<br/>
🎧 Now, after the break,<br/>
🎧 we'll be moving to a different location for a video presentation,<br/>
🎧 so instead of coming back here,<br/>
🎧 we'd like you all to go to Lecture Room 311.<br/>
🎧 You'll find it on this same level, just down the hall,<br/>
🎧 and there you will be shown a video about important safety issues in the workplace,<br/>
🎧 called Safety at Work.<br/>
🎧 We'll finish off the morning with lunch,<br/>
🎧 which should give everyone a chance to meet and get to know each other,<br/>
🎧 and we'll be serving you a buffet lunch in the Main Hall,<br/>
🎧 which is on the first floor, from 12.00 o'clock.<br/>
🎧 After lunch, you'll be divided up into your teams to meet your team leaders<br/>
🎧 and we're hoping to be all finished by 3.00, so...<br/>
🎧 I won't delay you any longer...<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Good afternoon. Can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Good afternoon.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I've just transferred to the School of Education,<br/>
🎧 and I'd like information about joining the library.<br/>
🎧 Well, the School of Education has libraries on two sites, as I'm sure you know.<br/>
🎧 This one here is the Fordham Site, and the other is on Castle Road.<br/>
🎧 And is there any difference between the two libraries?<br/>
🎧 Not in terms of their facilities.<br/>
🎧 Access to online databases and the Internet is available at both sites<br/>
🎧 and each site has a range of reference materials on education.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes. I see.<br/>
🎧 But the Castle Road site has books on the sociology of education<br/>
🎧 and a collection of textbooks and teaching resources<br/>
🎧 covering most of the subjects taught in secondary schools.<br/>
🎧 Ah, right,<br/>
🎧 but I'm training to be a primary teacher<br/>
🎧 so I need to look at materials for the five to eleven age group.<br/>
🎧 Then you've come to the right place.<br/>
🎧 At Fordham we hold material relating to primary education,<br/>
🎧 as well as special needs,<br/>
🎧 but of course you'll need to familiarise yourself with both sites to make the most of our resources.<br/>
🎧 You haven't mentioned periodicals.<br/>
🎧 Are they held at both sites?<br/>
🎧 Current issues, yes but if you want to look at back issues<br/>
🎧 you'll need to use the CD-ROM databases which are held here at Fordham.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 Now, about borrowing books.<br/>
🎧 I'm living out of town, so I'm hoping I can borrow quite a few items,<br/>
🎧 and cut down on the number of trips I have to make.<br/>
🎧 Right, well, members can borrow two books at a time from each site.<br/>
🎧 Only two books?<br/>
🎧 Only two from each site, but that's four altogether.<br/>
🎧 Oh I see,<br/>
🎧 and how long can I hang on to them for?<br/>
🎧 The borrowing period is one month, but of course books can be renewed.<br/>
🎧 You can renew any item a maximum of three times.<br/>
🎧 Do I have to come to the library to do that?<br/>
🎧 No, you can do it by telephone or email,<br/>
🎧 but you can't renew overdue books this way,<br/>
🎧 only before or on the due date stamped in the book.<br/>
🎧 We'll need your full name, your borrower number<br/>
🎧 and the name of the site library you borrowed the items from.<br/>
🎧 So theoretically I can borrow books for up to three months -<br/>
🎧 is that what you're saying?<br/>
🎧 Yes, provided they're not recalled.<br/>
🎧 So, what happens then?<br/>
🎧 Well, sometimes an item is requested by another borrower,<br/>
🎧 in which case we'd send you a letter,<br/>
🎧 and you'd have to return the book within seven working days.<br/>
🎧 Don't forget we're closed on Sundays.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 I expect it'll take me a while to find what I need.<br/>
🎧 There's such a lot here.<br/>
🎧 Yes, there is,<br/>
🎧 but if you need help getting started,<br/>
🎧 this term we're running three study skills workshops.<br/>
🎧 Oh?<br/>
🎧 What are they on?<br/>
🎧 Er, let me see.<br/>
🎧 The first one's on resources...<br/>
🎧 yes, here it is.<br/>
🎧 How to use the library's resources.<br/>
🎧 That includes everything, not just the print and technical resources.<br/>
🎧 That sounds useful.<br/>
🎧 Is there anything on using the Internet?<br/>
🎧 Er, let's see.<br/>
🎧 The one on the Internet for beginners was last term.<br/>
🎧 This term it's finding research materials online.<br/>
🎧 That sounds interesting too,<br/>
🎧 hm, what's the last one?<br/>
🎧 It's a workshop on dissertations.<br/>
🎧 What do you mean? how to write one?<br/>
🎧 Er, no it's more to do with academic writing conventions,<br/>
🎧 you know, writing a bibliography and how to refer to sources in your text.<br/>
🎧 That sort of thing.<br/>
🎧 Anyway, here's a leaflet with information about all three.<br/>
🎧 Thanks a lot.<br/>
🎧 That'll be very useful.<br/>
🎧 You're welcome.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Well, most people think that lions only come from Africa.<br/>
🎧 And you would be forgiven for thinking this,<br/>
🎧 because in fact, most lions do come from Africa.<br/>
🎧 But this hasn't always been the case.<br/>
🎧 If we go back 10,000 years, we would find that there were lions roaming vast sections of the globe.<br/>
🎧 But now, unfortunately,<br/>
🎧 only very small sections of the lions' former habitat remain.<br/>
🎧 My particular interest is Asiatic lions,<br/>
🎧 which are a sub-species of African lions.<br/>
🎧 It's almost 100,000 years since the Asiatic lions split off and developed as a sub-species.<br/>
🎧 At one time the Asiatic lion was living as far west as Greece<br/>
🎧 and they were found from there,<br/>
🎧 in a band that spread east through various countries of the Middle East,<br/>
🎧 all the way to India.<br/>
🎧 In museums, you can now see Greek coins that have clear images of the Asiatic lion on them.<br/>
🎧 Most of them are dated at around 500 B.C.<br/>
🎧 However, Europe saw its last Asiatic lion roaming free 2000 years ago.<br/>
🎧 Over the next nineteen hundred years the numbers of Asiatic lions in the other areas declined steadily,<br/>
🎧 but it was only in the nineteenth century that they disappeared from everywhere but India.<br/>
🎧 So, how can you tell an Asiatic lion from an African lion,<br/>
🎧 with which you're probably more familiar?<br/>
🎧 Well, in general, Asiatic lions are not as big as African lions.<br/>
🎧 The colour is more or less the same, but the appearance of the mane is different -<br/>
🎧 that's the hair around the lion's face and neck.<br/>
🎧 The Asiatic lion's mane is noticeably shorter than the African lion's.<br/>
🎧 Asiatic lions also have a long fold of skin on their undersides,<br/>
🎧 whereas not many African lions have this.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'd like to talk to you now about the Gir Sanctuary in India.<br/>
🎧 That's where I've just come back from.<br/>
🎧 The sanctuary was established specifically to protect the Asiatic lion.<br/>
🎧 It's 1.450 square kilometres in area and most of it is forest.<br/>
🎧 There are now around 300 Asiatic lions in India<br/>
🎧 and almost all of them are in this sanctuary.<br/>
🎧 But despite living in a sanctuary, which makes them safe from hunters,<br/>
🎧 they still face a number of problems that threaten their survival.<br/>
🎧 One of these is the ever-present danger of disease.<br/>
🎧 This is what killed more than a third of Africa's Serengeti lions in 1994,<br/>
🎧 and people are fearful that something similar could happen in the Gir Sanctuary<br/>
🎧 and kill off many of the Asiatic lions there.<br/>
🎧 India's lions are particularly vulnerable because they have a limited gene pool.<br/>
🎧 The reason for this is interesting -<br/>
🎧 it's because all of them are descended from a few dozen lions that were saved by a prince<br/>
🎧 who took a particular interest in them.<br/>
🎧 He was very wealthy, and he managed to protect them -<br/>
🎧 otherwise they'd probably have died out completely.<br/>
🎧 When you see the Asiatic lion in India,<br/>
🎧 what you sense is enormous vitality.<br/>
🎧 They're very impressive beasts<br/>
🎧 and you would never guess that they had this vulnerability when you look at them.<br/>
🎧 The Asiatic lions don't have the Gir Sanctuary to themselves, I should add.<br/>
🎧 They actually share it with about 2000 farmers.<br/>
🎧 A significant proportion of the lions' diet is made up of the livestock of these farmers -<br/>
🎧 goats, chickens and so on -<br/>
🎧 as much as a third, in fact.<br/>
🎧 And they've even been known to attack humans, especially in times of drought.<br/>
🎧 One final piece of interesting information -<br/>
🎧 in ancient India, one of the greatest tests of leadership for a man was to fight a lion.<br/>
🎧 Now it seems, in modern India it will be a great test to see if the lion can be saved.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure this is something that all of you will share concern for too.<br/>
<br/><br/>
