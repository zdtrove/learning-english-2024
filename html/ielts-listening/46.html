🎧 Hi, come and take a <span>seat.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 My <span>name's <span>Carl <span>Rogers and I'm one of the <span>doctors here at the <span>Total <span>Health <span>Clinic.<br/>
🎧 So I <span>understand this is your first visit to the <span>clinic?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it is.<br/>
🎧 OK, well I hope you'll be very happy with the <span>service you <span>receive here.<br/>
🎧 So if it's alright with you I'll take a few <span>details to help me give you the best <span>possible <span>service.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 So can I check first of all that we have the <span>correct personal <span>details for you?<br/>
🎧 So your full name is <span>Julie <span>Anne <span>Garcia?<br/>
🎧 That's <span>correct.<br/>
🎧 Perfect. And can I have a <span>contact phone number?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>2194429785.<br/>
🎧 OK, and then can I just check that we have the <span>correct date of <span>birth?<br/>
🎧 <span>October <span>10th, <span>1992.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I actually have <span>1991,<br/>
🎧 I'll just <span>correct that now.<br/>
🎧 Right, so that's all good.<br/>
🎧 Now I just need a few more personal <span>details…<br/>
🎧 do you have an <span>occupation, either <span>full-time or <span>part-time?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I work <span>full-time in <span>Esterhazy's <span>-<br/>
🎧 you know, the <span>restaurant <span>chain.<br/>
🎧 I <span>started off as a <span>waitress there a few years ago and I'm a <span>manager now.<br/>
🎧 Oh I know them, yeah, they're down on <span>114th <span>Street, aren't they?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I've been there a few <span>times.<br/>
🎧 I just love their <span>salads.<br/>
🎧 That's good to hear.<br/>
🎧 Right, so one more thing I need to know before we talk about why you're here, <span>Julie,<br/>
🎧 and that's the name of your <span>insurance company.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>Cawley Life <span>Insurance,<br/>
🎧 that's <span>CAWLEY.<br/>
🎧 <span>Excellent, thank you so much.<br/>
🎧 Now <span>Julie, let's look at how we can help you.<br/>
🎧 So tell me a little about what <span>brought you here today.<br/>
🎧 Well, I've been getting a <span>pain in my <span>knee, the <span>left one.<br/>
🎧 Not very serious at first, but it's <span>gotten <span>worse,<br/>
🎧 so I thought I <span>ought to see <span>someone about it.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>certainly the right <span>decision.<br/>
🎧 So how long have you been <span>aware of this <span>pain?<br/>
🎧 Is it just a few <span>days, or is it <span>longer than that?<br/>
🎧 <span>Longer.<br/>
🎧 It's been <span>worse for the last <span>couple of <span>days,<br/>
🎧 but it's <span>three <span>weeks since I first <span>noticed it.<br/>
🎧 It came on quite <span>gradually though, so I kind of <span>ignored it at first.<br/>
🎧 And have you taken any <span>medication yourself, or <span>treated it in any way?<br/>
🎧 <span>Um.. yeah, I've been taking <span>medication to <span>deal with the <span>pain... <span>Tylenol<br/>
🎧 and that <span>works OK for a few hours.<br/>
🎧 But I don't like to keep taking it.<br/>
🎧 OK. And what about <span>heat <span>treatment?<br/>
🎧 Have you <span>tried <span>applying <span>heat at all?<br/>
🎧 No, but I have been <span>using ice on it for the last few <span>days.<br/>
🎧 And does that <span>seem to help the <span>pain at all?<br/>
🎧 A little, yes.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 Now you look as if you're quite fit <span>normally?<br/>
🎧 I am, yes.<br/>
🎧 So do you do any <span>sport on a <span>regular <span>basis?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I play a lot of <span>tennis.<br/>
🎧 I <span>belong to a <span>club so I go there a lot.<br/>
🎧 I'm quite <span>competitive so I enjoy that side of it as well as the <span>exercise.<br/>
🎧 But I haven't <span>gone since this <span>started.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 And do you do any other <span>types of <span>exercise?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I sometimes do a little <span>swimming,<br/>
🎧 but usually just when I'm on <span>vacation.<br/>
🎧 But <span>normally I go <span>running a few <span>times a week, maybe <span>three or <span>four <span>times.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm. So your <span>legs are getting quite a <span>pounding.<br/>
🎧 But you haven't had any <span>problems up to now?<br/>
🎧 No, not with my <span>legs.<br/>
🎧 I did have an <span>accident last year when I <span>slipped and <span>hurt my <span>shoulder,<br/>
🎧 but that's better now.<br/>
🎧 <span>Excellent.<br/>
🎧 And do you have any <span>allergies?<br/>
🎧 No, <span>none that I'm <span>aware of.<br/>
🎧 And do you take any <span>medication on a <span>regular <span>basis?<br/>
🎧 Well, I take <span>vitamins but that's all.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>generally very <span>healthy.<br/>
🎧 OK, well let's have a <span>closer look and see what might be <span>causing this <span>problem.<br/>
🎧 If you can just get <span>up…<br/>
<br />

🎧 We'll be <span>arriving at <span>Branley <span>Castle in about <span>five <span>minutes,<br/>
🎧 but before we get there I'll give you a little <span>information about the <span>castle and what our visit will <span>include.<br/>
🎧 So in <span>fact there's been a <span>castle on this <span>site for over <span>1100 years.<br/>
🎧 The first <span>building was a <span>fort <span>constructed in <span>914 <span>AD<br/>
🎧 for <span>defence <span>against <span>Danish <span>invaders by <span>King <span>Alfred the <span>Great's <span>daughter,<br/>
🎧 who <span>ruled <span>England at the time.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>following <span>century, after the <span>Normans <span>conquered <span>England,<br/>
🎧 the <span>land was <span>given to a <span>nobleman called <span>Richard <span>de <span>Vere,<br/>
🎧 and he <span>built a <span>castle there that <span>stayed in the <span>de <span>Vere <span>family for over <span>400 years.<br/>
🎧 <span>However, when <span>Queen <span>Elizabeth I <span>announced that she was going to visit the <span>castle in <span>1576<br/>
🎧 it was <span>beginning to look a bit run down,<br/>
🎧 and it was <span>decided that rather than <span>repair the <span>guest <span>rooms,<br/>
🎧 they'd make a new house for her out of <span>wood next to the <span>main <span>hall.<br/>
🎧 She <span>stayed there for <span>four <span>nights and <span>apparently it was very <span>luxurious,<br/>
🎧 but <span>unfortunately it was <span>destroyed a few years later by <span>fire.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>seventeenth <span>century the <span>castle <span>belonged to the <span>wealthy <span>Fenys <span>family,<br/>
🎧 who <span>enlarged it and made it more <span>comfortable.<br/>
🎧 <span>However, by <span>1982 the <span>Fenys <span>family could no <span>longer <span>afford to <span>maintain the <span>castle,<br/>
🎧 even though they <span>received <span>government <span>support, and they put it on the <span>market.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>eventually taken over by a company who <span>owned a number of <span>amusement <span>parks,<br/>
🎧 but when we get there I think you'll see that <span>they've <span>managed to <span>retain the <span>original <span>atmosphere of the <span>castle.<br/>
🎧 When you go inside, you'll find that in the <span>state <span>rooms<br/>
🎧 there are <span>life-like <span>moving <span>wax <span>models <span>dressed in <span>costumes of different <span>periods in the <span>past,<br/>
🎧 which even <span>carry on <span>conversations together.<br/>
🎧 As well as that, in every room there are <span>booklets <span>giving <span>information about what the room was used <span>for<br/>
🎧 and the <span>history of the <span>objects and <span>furniture it <span>contains.<br/>
🎧 The <span>castle <span>park's quite <span>extensive.<br/>
🎧 At one time <span>sheep were <span>kept there,<br/>
🎧 and in the <span>nineteenth <span>century the <span>owners had a little zoo with <span>animals like <span>rabbits<br/>
🎧 and even a <span>baby <span>elephant.<br/>
🎧 <span>Nowadays the old zoo <span>buildings are used for <span>public <span>displays of <span>paintings and <span>sculpture.<br/>
🎧 The <span>park also has some <span>beautiful <span>trees,<br/>
🎧 though the <span>oldest of all, which <span>dated back <span>800 years,<br/>
🎧 was <span>sadly <span>blown down in <span>1987.<br/>
🎧 Now, you're free to <span>wander around on your own until <span>4.30<br/>
🎧 but then at the end of our <span>visit<br/>
🎧 we'll all meet together at the <span>bottom of the Great <span>Staircase.<br/>
🎧 We'll then go on to the long <span>gallery,<br/>
🎧 where there's a wonderful <span>collection of <span>photographs <span>showing the <span>family who <span>owned the <span>castle a <span>hundred years <span>ago<br/>
🎧 having tea and <span>cakes in the <span>conservatory <span>-<br/>
🎧 and we'll then take you to the same place,<br/>
🎧 where <span>afternoon tea will be <span>served to you.<br/>
🎧 Now if you can take a look at your <span>plans you'll see <span>Branley <span>Castle has <span>four <span>towers,<br/>
🎧 <span>joined together by a high <span>wall, with the <span>river on two <span>sides.<br/>
🎧 Don't <span>miss <span>seeing the Great <span>Hall.<br/>
🎧 That's near the <span>river in the <span>main <span>tower, the <span>biggest one,<br/>
🎧 which was <span>extended and <span>redesigned in the <span>eighteenth <span>century.<br/>
🎧 If you want to get a good <span>view of the whole <span>castle, you can <span>walk around the <span>walls.<br/>
🎧 The <span>starting <span>point's quite near the <span>main <span>entrance <span>-<br/>
🎧 <span>walk <span>straight down the <span>path until you get to the <span>south <span>gate, and it's just there.<br/>
🎧 Don't go on to the <span>north <span>gate <span>- there's no way up from there.<br/>
🎧 <span>There'll <span>shortly be a show in which you can see <span>archers <span>displaying their <span>skill with a <span>bow and <span>arrow.<br/>
🎧 The <span>quickest way to get there is to take the first <span>left after the <span>main <span>entrance<br/>
🎧 and <span>follow the <span>path <span>past the <span>bridge,<br/>
🎧 then you'll see it in <span>front of you at the end.<br/>
🎧 If you like <span>animals there's also a <span>display of <span>hunting <span>birds <span>-<br/>
🎧 <span>falcons and <span>eagles and so on.<br/>
🎧 If you go from the <span>main <span>entrance in the <span>direction of the <span>south <span>gate,<br/>
🎧 but <span>turn right before you get there <span>instead of going through it,<br/>
🎧 you'll see it on your right <span>past the first <span>tower.<br/>
🎧 At <span>3 pm there's a short <span>performance of <span>traditional <span>dancing on the <span>outdoor <span>stage.<br/>
🎧 That's right at the other side of the <span>castle from the <span>entrance, and over the <span>bridge.<br/>
🎧 It's about ten <span>minutes' <span>walk or so.<br/>
🎧 And finally, the <span>shop<br/>
🎧 It's actually inside one of the <span>towers,<br/>
🎧 but the way in is from the outside.<br/>
🎧 Just take the first <span>left after the <span>main <span>entrance, go down the <span>path and take the first right.<br/>
🎧 It's got some <span>lovely <span>gifts and <span>souvenirs.<br/>
🎧 Right, so we're just <span>arriving…<br/>
<br />

🎧 So, <span>Rosie and <span>Martin,<br/>
🎧 let's look at what you've got for your <span>presentation on <span>woolly <span>mammoths.<br/>
🎧 OK, we've got a short <span>outline here.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 So it's about a <span>research <span>project in <span>North <span>America?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 But we thought we <span>needed something <span>general about <span>woolly <span>mammoths in our <span>introduction,<br/>
🎧 to <span>establish that they were <span>related to our <span>modern <span>elephant,<br/>
🎧 and they <span>lived <span>thousands of years ago in the last ice age.<br/>
🎧 Maybe we could show a <span>video <span>clip of a <span>cartoon about <span>mammoths.<br/>
🎧 But that'd be a bit <span>childish.<br/>
🎧 Or we could have a <span>diagram,<br/>
🎧 it could be a <span>timeline to show when they <span>lived, with <span>illustrations?<br/>
🎧 Or we could just show a <span>drawing of them <span>walking in the ice?<br/>
🎧 No, let's go with your last <span>suggestion.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 Then you're <span>describing the <span>discovery of the <span>mammoth <span>tooth on <span>St <span>Paul's <span>Island in <span>Alaska,<br/>
🎧 and why it was <span>significant.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 The <span>tooth was <span>found by a man called <span>Russell <span>Graham.<br/>
🎧 He <span>picked it up from under a <span>rock in a <span>cave.<br/>
🎧 He <span>knew it was special <span>-<br/>
🎧 for a start it was in really good <span>condition,<br/>
🎧 as if it had been just <span>extracted from the <span>animal's <span>jawbone.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway, they <span>found it was <span>6,500 years old.<br/>
🎧 So why was that <span>significant?<br/>
🎧 Well the <span>mammoth <span>bones <span>previously <span>found on the <span>North <span>American <span>mainland were much less <span>recent than that.<br/>
🎧 So this was really amazing.<br/>
🎧 Then we're <span>making an <span>animated <span>diagram to show the <span>geography of the <span>area in <span>prehistoric <span>times.<br/>
🎧 So <span>originally, <span>St <span>Paul's <span>Island wasn't an <span>island,<br/>
🎧 it was <span>connected to the <span>mainland,<br/>
🎧 and <span>mammoths and other <span>animals like <span>bears were able to <span>roam around the whole <span>area.<br/>
🎧 Then the <span>climate <span>warmed up and the sea <span>level <span>began to <span>rise,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>island got cut off from the <span>mainland.<br/>
🎧 So those <span>mammoths on the <span>island couldn't <span>escape;<br/>
🎧 they had to <span>stay on the <span>island.<br/>
🎧 And in <span>fact the <span>species <span>survived there for <span>thousands of <span>years<br/>
🎧 after they'd become <span>extinct on the <span>mainland.<br/>
🎧 So why do you think they <span>died out on the <span>mainland?<br/>
🎧 No <span>one's sure.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway, next we'll <span>explain how <span>Graham and his <span>team <span>identified the date when the <span>mammoths <span>became <span>extinct on the <span>island.<br/>
🎧 They <span>concluded that the <span>extinction <span>happened <span>5,600 years ago,<br/>
🎧 which is a very <span>precise time for a <span>prehistoric <span>extinction.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>based on <span>samples they took from <span>mud at the <span>bottom of a <span>lake on the <span>island.<br/>
🎧 They <span>analysed it to find out what had <span>fallen in over time <span>-<br/>
🎧 <span>bits of <span>plants, <span>volcanic <span>ash and even <span>DNA from the <span>mammoths <span>themselves.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>standard <span>procedure, but it took <span>nearly two years to do.<br/>
🎧 So why don't you quickly go through the <span>main <span>sections of your <span>presentation<br/>
🎧 and <span>discuss what <span>action's <span>needed for each <span>part?<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So for the <span>introduction, we're <span>using a <span>visual,<br/>
🎧 so once we've <span>prepared that we're done.<br/>
🎧 I'm not sure.<br/>
🎧 I think we need to <span>write down all the <span>ideas we want to <span>include here,<br/>
🎧 not just <span>rely on <span>memory.<br/>
🎧 How we <span>begin the <span>presentation is so <span>important…<br/>
🎧 <span>Umm, you're right.<br/>
🎧 The <span>discovery of the <span>mammoth <span>tooth is probably the most <span>dramatic <span>part,<br/>
🎧 but we don't have that much <span>information,<br/>
🎧 only what we got from the online <span>article.<br/>
🎧 I thought maybe we could get in touch with the <span>researcher who <span>led the <span>team<br/>
🎧 and ask him to tell us a bit more.<br/>
🎧 Great idea.<br/>
🎧 What about the <span>section with the <span>initial <span>questions <span>asked by the <span>researchers?<br/>
🎧 We've got a lot on that but we need to make it <span>interesting.<br/>
🎧 We could ask the <span>audience to <span>suggest some <span>questions about <span>it<br/>
🎧 and then see how many of them we can answer.<br/>
🎧 I don't think it would take too long.<br/>
🎧 Yes that would add a bit of <span>variety.<br/>
🎧 Then the <span>section on <span>further <span>research <span>carried out on the <span>island <span>- <span>analysing the <span>mud in the <span>lake.<br/>
🎧 I <span>wonder if we've actually got too much <span>information here,<br/>
🎧 should we cut some?<br/>
🎧 I don't think so,<br/>
🎧 but it's all a bit <span>muddled at <span>present.<br/>
🎧 Yes, maybe it would be better if it <span>followed a <span>chronological <span>pattern.<br/>
🎧 I think so.<br/>
🎧 The <span>findings and <span>possible <span>explanations <span>section is just about ready,<br/>
🎧 but we need to practice it so we're sure it won't <span>overrun.<br/>
🎧 I think it should be OK,<br/>
🎧 but yes, let's make sure.<br/>
🎧 In the last <span>section, <span>relevance to the <span>present day,<br/>
🎧 you've got some good <span>ideas <span>but...<br/>
🎧 this is where you need to move away from the <span>ideas of <span>others and give your own <span>viewpoint.<br/>
🎧 OK, we'll think about that.<br/>
🎧 Now shall <span>we…<br/>

🎧 In this <span>series of <span>lectures about the <span>history of <span>weather <span>forecasting,<br/>
🎧 I'll start by <span>examining its <span>early <span>history <span>-<br/>
🎧 <span>that'll be the <span>subject of <span>today's talk.<br/>
🎧 Ok, so we'll start by going back <span>thousands of years.<br/>
🎧 Most <span>ancient <span>cultures had <span>weather <span>gods,<br/>
🎧 and <span>weather <span>catastrophes, such as <span>floods,<br/>
🎧 <span>played an important <span>role in many <span>creation <span>myths.<br/>
🎧 <span>Generally, <span>weather was <span>attributed to the <span>whims of the <span>gods,<br/>
🎧 as the <span>wide <span>range of <span>weather <span>gods in <span>various <span>cultures <span>shows.<br/>
🎧 For <span>instance, there's the <span>Egyptian sun <span>god <span>Ra,<br/>
🎧 and <span>Thor, the <span>Norse <span>god of <span>thunder and <span>lightning.<br/>
🎧 Many <span>ancient <span>civilisations <span>developed <span>rites such as <span>dances<br/>
🎧 in order to make the <span>weather <span>gods look <span>kindly on them.<br/>
🎧 But the <span>weather was of <span>daily <span>importance:<br/>
🎧 <span>observing the <span>skies and <span>drawing the <span>correct <span>conclusions from these <span>observations was really important,<br/>
🎧 in <span>fact their <span>survival <span>depended on it.<br/>
🎧 It isn't <span>known when people first <span>started to <span>observe the <span>skies,<br/>
🎧 but at around <span>650 <span>BC,<br/>
🎧 the <span>Babylonians <span>produced the first <span>short-range <span>weather <span>forecasts,<br/>
🎧 <span>based on their <span>observations of <span>clouds and other <span>phenomena.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Chinese also <span>recognised <span>weather <span>patterns,<br/>
🎧 and by <span>300 <span>BC,<br/>
🎧 <span>astronomers had <span>developed a <span>calendar which <span>divided the year into <span>24 <span>festivals,<br/>
🎧 each <span>associated with a different <span>weather <span>phenomenon.<br/>
🎧 The <span>ancient <span>Greeks were the first to <span>develop a more <span>scientific <span>approach to <span>explaining the <span>weather.<br/>
🎧 The work of the <span>philosopher and <span>scientist <span>Aristotle, in the <span>fourth <span>century <span>BC, is <span>especially <span>noteworthy,<br/>
🎧 as his <span>ideas <span>held <span>sway for <span>nearly <span>2,000 years.<br/>
🎧 In <span>340 <span>BC,<br/>
🎧 he <span>wrote a book in which he <span>attempted to <span>account for the <span>formation of <span>rain, <span>clouds, <span>wind and <span>storms.<br/>
🎧 He also <span>described <span>celestial <span>phenomena such as <span>haloes <span>-<br/>
🎧 that is, <span>bright <span>circles of <span>light around the sun, the <span>moon and <span>bright <span>stars <span>- and <span>comets.<br/>
🎧 Many of his <span>observations were <span>surprisingly <span>accurate.<br/>
🎧 For example, he <span>believed that <span>heat could <span>cause water to <span>evaporate.<br/>
🎧 But he also <span>jumped to quite a few wrong <span>conclusions,<br/>
🎧 such as that <span>winds are <span>breathed out by the <span>Earth.<br/>
🎧 <span>Errors like this were <span>rectified from the <span>Renaissance <span>onwards.<br/>
🎧 For <span>nearly <span>2,000 years,<br/>
🎧 <span>Aristotle's work was <span>accepted as the <span>chief <span>authority on <span>weather <span>theory.<br/>
🎧 <span>Alongside this, though, in the <span>Middle <span>Ages,<br/>
🎧 <span>weather <span>observations were <span>passed on in the <span>form of <span>proverbs,<br/>
🎧 such as <span>'Red sky at <span>night, <span>shepherd's <span>delight; red sky in the morning, <span>shepherd's <span>warning'.<br/>
🎧 Many of these are <span>based on very good <span>observations and are <span>accurate,<br/>
🎧 as <span>contemporary <span>meteorologists have <span>discovered.<br/>
🎧 For <span>centuries, any <span>attempt to <span>forecast the <span>weather could only be <span>based on personal <span>observations,<br/>
🎧 but in the <span>fifteenth <span>century <span>scientists <span>began to see the need for <span>instruments.<br/>
🎧 Until then, the only <span>ones <span>available were <span>weathervanes <span>- to <span>determine the <span>wind <span>direction <span>-<br/>
🎧 and <span>early <span>versions of <span>rain <span>gauges.<br/>
🎧 One of the first, <span>invented in the <span>fifteenth <span>century, was a <span>hygrometer, which <span>measured <span>humidity.<br/>
🎧 This was one of many <span>inventions that <span>contributed to the <span>development of <span>weather <span>forecasting.<br/>
🎧 In <span>1592, the <span>Italian <span>scientist and <span>inventor <span>Galileo <span>developed the <span>world's first <span>thermometer.<br/>
🎧 His student <span>Torricelli later <span>invented the <span>barometer,<br/>
🎧 which <span>allowed people to <span>measure <span>atmospheric <span>pressure.<br/>
🎧 In <span>1648, the <span>French <span>philosopher <span>Pascal <span>proved that <span>pressure <span>decreases with <span>altitude.<br/>
🎧 This <span>discovery was <span>verified by English <span>astronomer <span>Halley in <span>1686,<br/>
🎧 and <span>Halley was also the first person to map <span>trade <span>winds.<br/>
🎧 This <span>increasing <span>ability to <span>measure <span>factors <span>related to <span>weather<br/>
🎧 <span>helped <span>scientists to <span>understand the <span>atmosphere and its <span>processes better,<br/>
🎧 and they <span>started <span>collecting <span>weather <span>observation <span>data <span>systematically.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>18th <span>century, the <span>scientist and <span>politician <span>Benjamin <span>Franklin<br/>
🎧 <span>carried out work on <span>electricity and <span>lightning in <span>particular,<br/>
🎧 but he was also very interested in <span>weather and <span>studied it <span>throughout most of his life.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>Franklin who <span>discovered that <span>storms <span>generally travel from <span>west to <span>east.<br/>
🎧 In <span>addition to new <span>meteorological <span>instruments,<br/>
🎧 other <span>developments <span>contributed to our <span>understanding of the <span>atmosphere.<br/>
🎧 People in different <span>locations <span>began to keep <span>records,<br/>
🎧 and in the <span>mid-nineteenth <span>century,<br/>
🎧 the <span>invention of the <span>telegraph made it <span>possible for these <span>records to be <span>collated.<br/>
🎧 This <span>led, by the end of the <span>nineteenth <span>century, to the first <span>weather <span>services.<br/>
🎧 It was not until the <span>early <span>twentieth <span>century that <span>mathematics and <span>physics <span>became <span>part of <span>meteorology,<br/>
🎧 and we'll <span>continue from that <span>point next week.<br/>
