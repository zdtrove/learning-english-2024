🎧 Hi, come and take a seat.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 My name's Carl Rogers and I'm one of the doctors here at the Total Health Clinic.<br/>
🎧 So I understand this is your first visit to the clinic?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it is.<br/>
🎧 OK, well I hope you'll be very happy with the service you receive here.<br/>
🎧 So if it's alright with you I'll take a few details to help me give you the best possible service.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 So can I check first of all that we have the correct personal details for you?<br/>
🎧 So your full name is Julie Anne Garcia?<br/>
🎧 That's correct.<br/>
🎧 Perfect. And can I have a contact phone number?<br/>
🎧 It's 2194429785.<br/>
🎧 OK, and then can I just check that we have the correct date of birth?<br/>
🎧 October 10th, 1992.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I actually have 1991,<br/>
🎧 I'll just correct that now.<br/>
🎧 Right, so that's all good.<br/>
🎧 Now I just need a few more personal details…<br/>
🎧 do you have an occupation, either full-time or part-time?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I work full-time in Esterhazy's -<br/>
🎧 you know, the restaurant chain.<br/>
🎧 I started off as a waitress there a few years ago and I'm a manager now.<br/>
🎧 Oh I know them, yeah, they're down on 114th Street, aren't they?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I've been there a few times.<br/>
🎧 I just love their salads.<br/>
🎧 That's good to hear.<br/>
🎧 Right, so one more thing I need to know before we talk about why you're here, Julie,<br/>
🎧 and that's the name of your insurance company.<br/>
🎧 It's Cawley Life Insurance,<br/>
🎧 that's CAWLEY.<br/>
🎧 Excellent, thank you so much.<br/>
🎧 Now Julie, let's look at how we can help you.<br/>
🎧 So tell me a little about what brought you here today.<br/>
🎧 Well, I've been getting a pain in my knee, the left one.<br/>
🎧 Not very serious at first, but it's gotten worse,<br/>
🎧 so I thought I ought to see someone about it.<br/>
🎧 That's certainly the right decision.<br/>
🎧 So how long have you been aware of this pain?<br/>
🎧 Is it just a few days, or is it longer than that?<br/>
🎧 Longer.<br/>
🎧 It's been worse for the last couple of days,<br/>
🎧 but it's three weeks since I first noticed it.<br/>
🎧 It came on quite gradually though, so I kind of ignored it at first.<br/>
🎧 And have you taken any medication yourself, or treated it in any way?<br/>
🎧 Um.. yeah, I've been taking medication to deal with the pain... Tylenol<br/>
🎧 and that works OK for a few hours.<br/>
🎧 But I don't like to keep taking it.<br/>
🎧 OK. And what about heat treatment?<br/>
🎧 Have you tried applying heat at all?<br/>
🎧 No, but I have been using ice on it for the last few days.<br/>
🎧 And does that seem to help the pain at all?<br/>
🎧 A little, yes.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 Now you look as if you're quite fit normally?<br/>
🎧 I am, yes.<br/>
🎧 So do you do any sport on a regular basis?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I play a lot of tennis.<br/>
🎧 I belong to a club so I go there a lot.<br/>
🎧 I'm quite competitive so I enjoy that side of it as well as the exercise.<br/>
🎧 But I haven't gone since this started.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 And do you do any other types of exercise?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I sometimes do a little swimming,<br/>
🎧 but usually just when I'm on vacation.<br/>
🎧 But normally I go running a few times a week, maybe three or four times.<br/>
🎧 Hmm. So your legs are getting quite a pounding.<br/>
🎧 But you haven't had any problems up to now?<br/>
🎧 No, not with my legs.<br/>
🎧 I did have an accident last year when I slipped and hurt my shoulder,<br/>
🎧 but that's better now.<br/>
🎧 Excellent.<br/>
🎧 And do you have any allergies?<br/>
🎧 No, none that I'm aware of.<br/>
🎧 And do you take any medication on a regular basis?<br/>
🎧 Well, I take vitamins but that's all.<br/>
🎧 I'm generally very healthy.<br/>
🎧 OK, well let's have a closer look and see what might be causing this problem.<br/>
🎧 If you can just get up…<br/>
<br />

🎧 We'll be arriving at Branley Castle in about five minutes,<br/>
🎧 but before we get there I'll give you a little information about the castle and what our visit will include.<br/>
🎧 So in fact there's been a castle on this site for over 1100 years.<br/>
🎧 The first building was a fort constructed in 914 AD<br/>
🎧 for defence against Danish invaders by King Alfred the Great's daughter,<br/>
🎧 who ruled England at the time.<br/>
🎧 In the following century, after the Normans conquered England,<br/>
🎧 the land was given to a nobleman called Richard de Vere,<br/>
🎧 and he built a castle there that stayed in the de Vere family for over 400 years.<br/>
🎧 However, when Queen Elizabeth I announced that she was going to visit the castle in 1576<br/>
🎧 it was beginning to look a bit run down,<br/>
🎧 and it was decided that rather than repair the guest rooms,<br/>
🎧 they'd make a new house for her out of wood next to the main hall.<br/>
🎧 She stayed there for four nights and apparently it was very luxurious,<br/>
🎧 but unfortunately it was destroyed a few years later by fire.<br/>
🎧 In the seventeenth century the castle belonged to the wealthy Fenys family,<br/>
🎧 who enlarged it and made it more comfortable.<br/>
🎧 However, by 1982 the Fenys family could no longer afford to maintain the castle,<br/>
🎧 even though they received government support, and they put it on the market.<br/>
🎧 It was eventually taken over by a company who owned a number of amusement parks,<br/>
🎧 but when we get there I think you'll see that they've managed to retain the original atmosphere of the castle.<br/>
🎧 When you go inside, you'll find that in the state rooms<br/>
🎧 there are life-like moving wax models dressed in costumes of different periods in the past,<br/>
🎧 which even carry on conversations together.<br/>
🎧 As well as that, in every room there are booklets giving information about what the room was used for<br/>
🎧 and the history of the objects and furniture it contains.<br/>
🎧 The castle park's quite extensive.<br/>
🎧 At one time sheep were kept there,<br/>
🎧 and in the nineteenth century the owners had a little zoo with animals like rabbits<br/>
🎧 and even a baby elephant.<br/>
🎧 Nowadays the old zoo buildings are used for public displays of paintings and sculpture.<br/>
🎧 The park also has some beautiful trees,<br/>
🎧 though the oldest of all, which dated back 800 years,<br/>
🎧 was sadly blown down in 1987.<br/>
🎧 Now, you're free to wander around on your own until 4.30<br/>
🎧 but then at the end of our visit<br/>
🎧 we'll all meet together at the bottom of the Great Staircase.<br/>
🎧 We'll then go on to the long gallery,<br/>
🎧 where there's a wonderful collection of photographs showing the family who owned the castle a hundred years ago<br/>
🎧 having tea and cakes in the conservatory -<br/>
🎧 and we'll then take you to the same place,<br/>
🎧 where afternoon tea will be served to you.<br/>
🎧 Now if you can take a look at your plans you'll see Branley Castle has four towers,<br/>
🎧 joined together by a high wall, with the river on two sides.<br/>
🎧 Don't miss seeing the Great Hall.<br/>
🎧 That's near the river in the main tower, the biggest one,<br/>
🎧 which was extended and redesigned in the eighteenth century.<br/>
🎧 If you want to get a good view of the whole castle, you can walk around the walls.<br/>
🎧 The starting point's quite near the main entrance -<br/>
🎧 walk straight down the path until you get to the south gate, and it's just there.<br/>
🎧 Don't go on to the north gate - there's no way up from there.<br/>
🎧 There'll shortly be a show in which you can see archers displaying their skill with a bow and arrow.<br/>
🎧 The quickest way to get there is to take the first left after the main entrance<br/>
🎧 and follow the path past the bridge,<br/>
🎧 then you'll see it in front of you at the end.<br/>
🎧 If you like animals there's also a display of hunting birds -<br/>
🎧 falcons and eagles and so on.<br/>
🎧 If you go from the main entrance in the direction of the south gate,<br/>
🎧 but turn right before you get there instead of going through it,<br/>
🎧 you'll see it on your right past the first tower.<br/>
🎧 At 3 pm there's a short performance of traditional dancing on the outdoor stage.<br/>
🎧 That's right at the other side of the castle from the entrance, and over the bridge.<br/>
🎧 It's about ten minutes' walk or so.<br/>
🎧 And finally, the shop<br/>
🎧 It's actually inside one of the towers,<br/>
🎧 but the way in is from the outside.<br/>
🎧 Just take the first left after the main entrance, go down the path and take the first right.<br/>
🎧 It's got some lovely gifts and souvenirs.<br/>
🎧 Right, so we're just arriving…<br/>
<br />

🎧 So, Rosie and Martin,<br/>
🎧 let's look at what you've got for your presentation on woolly mammoths.<br/>
🎧 OK, we've got a short outline here.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 So it's about a research project in North America?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 But we thought we needed something general about woolly mammoths in our introduction,<br/>
🎧 to establish that they were related to our modern elephant,<br/>
🎧 and they lived thousands of years ago in the last ice age.<br/>
🎧 Maybe we could show a video clip of a cartoon about mammoths.<br/>
🎧 But that'd be a bit childish.<br/>
🎧 Or we could have a diagram,<br/>
🎧 it could be a timeline to show when they lived, with illustrations?<br/>
🎧 Or we could just show a drawing of them walking in the ice?<br/>
🎧 No, let's go with your last suggestion.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 Then you're describing the discovery of the mammoth tooth on St Paul's Island in Alaska,<br/>
🎧 and why it was significant.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 The tooth was found by a man called Russell Graham.<br/>
🎧 He picked it up from under a rock in a cave.<br/>
🎧 He knew it was special -<br/>
🎧 for a start it was in really good condition,<br/>
🎧 as if it had been just extracted from the animal's jawbone.<br/>
🎧 Anyway, they found it was 6,500 years old.<br/>
🎧 So why was that significant?<br/>
🎧 Well the mammoth bones previously found on the North American mainland were much less recent than that.<br/>
🎧 So this was really amazing.<br/>
🎧 Then we're making an animated diagram to show the geography of the area in prehistoric times.<br/>
🎧 So originally, St Paul's Island wasn't an island,<br/>
🎧 it was connected to the mainland,<br/>
🎧 and mammoths and other animals like bears were able to roam around the whole area.<br/>
🎧 Then the climate warmed up and the sea level began to rise,<br/>
🎧 and the island got cut off from the mainland.<br/>
🎧 So those mammoths on the island couldn't escape;<br/>
🎧 they had to stay on the island.<br/>
🎧 And in fact the species survived there for thousands of years<br/>
🎧 after they'd become extinct on the mainland.<br/>
🎧 So why do you think they died out on the mainland?<br/>
🎧 No one's sure.<br/>
🎧 Anyway, next we'll explain how Graham and his team identified the date when the mammoths became extinct on the island.<br/>
🎧 They concluded that the extinction happened 5,600 years ago,<br/>
🎧 which is a very precise time for a prehistoric extinction.<br/>
🎧 It's based on samples they took from mud at the bottom of a lake on the island.<br/>
🎧 They analysed it to find out what had fallen in over time -<br/>
🎧 bits of plants, volcanic ash and even DNA from the mammoths themselves.<br/>
🎧 It's standard procedure, but it took nearly two years to do.<br/>
🎧 So why don't you quickly go through the main sections of your presentation<br/>
🎧 and discuss what action's needed for each part?<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So for the introduction, we're using a visual,<br/>
🎧 so once we've prepared that we're done.<br/>
🎧 I'm not sure.<br/>
🎧 I think we need to write down all the ideas we want to include here,<br/>
🎧 not just rely on memory.<br/>
🎧 How we begin the presentation is so important…<br/>
🎧 Umm, you're right.<br/>
🎧 The discovery of the mammoth tooth is probably the most dramatic part,<br/>
🎧 but we don't have that much information,<br/>
🎧 only what we got from the online article.<br/>
🎧 I thought maybe we could get in touch with the researcher who led the team<br/>
🎧 and ask him to tell us a bit more.<br/>
🎧 Great idea.<br/>
🎧 What about the section with the initial questions asked by the researchers?<br/>
🎧 We've got a lot on that but we need to make it interesting.<br/>
🎧 We could ask the audience to suggest some questions about it<br/>
🎧 and then see how many of them we can answer.<br/>
🎧 I don't think it would take too long.<br/>
🎧 Yes that would add a bit of variety.<br/>
🎧 Then the section on further research carried out on the island - analysing the mud in the lake.<br/>
🎧 I wonder if we've actually got too much information here,<br/>
🎧 should we cut some?<br/>
🎧 I don't think so,<br/>
🎧 but it's all a bit muddled at present.<br/>
🎧 Yes, maybe it would be better if it followed a chronological pattern.<br/>
🎧 I think so.<br/>
🎧 The findings and possible explanations section is just about ready,<br/>
🎧 but we need to practice it so we're sure it won't overrun.<br/>
🎧 I think it should be OK,<br/>
🎧 but yes, let's make sure.<br/>
🎧 In the last section, relevance to the present day,<br/>
🎧 you've got some good ideas but...<br/>
🎧 this is where you need to move away from the ideas of others and give your own viewpoint.<br/>
🎧 OK, we'll think about that.<br/>
🎧 Now shall we…<br/>
<br />

🎧 In this series of lectures about the history of weather forecasting,<br/>
🎧 I'll start by examining its early history -<br/>
🎧 that'll be the subject of today's talk.<br/>
🎧 Ok, so we'll start by going back thousands of years.<br/>
🎧 Most ancient cultures had weather gods,<br/>
🎧 and weather catastrophes, such as floods,<br/>
🎧 played an important role in many creation myths.<br/>
🎧 Generally, weather was attributed to the whims of the gods,<br/>
🎧 as the wide range of weather gods in various cultures shows.<br/>
🎧 For instance, there's the Egyptian sun god Ra,<br/>
🎧 and Thor, the Norse god of thunder and lightning.<br/>
🎧 Many ancient civilisations developed rites such as dances<br/>
🎧 in order to make the weather gods look kindly on them.<br/>
🎧 But the weather was of daily importance:<br/>
🎧 observing the skies and drawing the correct conclusions from these observations was really important,<br/>
🎧 in fact their survival depended on it.<br/>
🎧 It isn't known when people first started to observe the skies,<br/>
🎧 but at around 650 BC,<br/>
🎧 the Babylonians produced the first short-range weather forecasts,<br/>
🎧 based on their observations of clouds and other phenomena.<br/>
🎧 The Chinese also recognised weather patterns,<br/>
🎧 and by 300 BC,<br/>
🎧 astronomers had developed a calendar which divided the year into 24 festivals,<br/>
🎧 each associated with a different weather phenomenon.<br/>
🎧 The ancient Greeks were the first to develop a more scientific approach to explaining the weather.<br/>
🎧 The work of the philosopher and scientist Aristotle, in the fourth century BC, is especially noteworthy,<br/>
🎧 as his ideas held sway for nearly 2,000 years.<br/>
🎧 In 340 BC,<br/>
🎧 he wrote a book in which he attempted to account for the formation of rain, clouds, wind and storms.<br/>
🎧 He also described celestial phenomena such as haloes -<br/>
🎧 that is, bright circles of light around the sun, the moon and bright stars - and comets.<br/>
🎧 Many of his observations were surprisingly accurate.<br/>
🎧 For example, he believed that heat could cause water to evaporate.<br/>
🎧 But he also jumped to quite a few wrong conclusions,<br/>
🎧 such as that winds are breathed out by the Earth.<br/>
🎧 Errors like this were rectified from the Renaissance onwards.<br/>
🎧 For nearly 2,000 years,<br/>
🎧 Aristotle's work was accepted as the chief authority on weather theory.<br/>
🎧 Alongside this, though, in the Middle Ages,<br/>
🎧 weather observations were passed on in the form of proverbs,<br/>
🎧 such as 'Red sky at night, shepherd's delight; red sky in the morning, shepherd's warning'.<br/>
🎧 Many of these are based on very good observations and are accurate,<br/>
🎧 as contemporary meteorologists have discovered.<br/>
🎧 For centuries, any attempt to forecast the weather could only be based on personal observations,<br/>
🎧 but in the fifteenth century scientists began to see the need for instruments.<br/>
🎧 Until then, the only ones available were weathervanes - to determine the wind direction -<br/>
🎧 and early versions of rain gauges.<br/>
🎧 One of the first, invented in the fifteenth century, was a hygrometer, which measured humidity.<br/>
🎧 This was one of many inventions that contributed to the development of weather forecasting.<br/>
🎧 In 1592, the Italian scientist and inventor Galileo developed the world's first thermometer.<br/>
🎧 His student Torricelli later invented the barometer,<br/>
🎧 which allowed people to measure atmospheric pressure.<br/>
🎧 In 1648, the French philosopher Pascal proved that pressure decreases with altitude.<br/>
🎧 This discovery was verified by English astronomer Halley in 1686,<br/>
🎧 and Halley was also the first person to map trade winds.<br/>
🎧 This increasing ability to measure factors related to weather<br/>
🎧 helped scientists to understand the atmosphere and its processes better,<br/>
🎧 and they started collecting weather observation data systematically.<br/>
🎧 In the 18th century, the scientist and politician Benjamin Franklin<br/>
🎧 carried out work on electricity and lightning in particular,<br/>
🎧 but he was also very interested in weather and studied it throughout most of his life.<br/>
🎧 It was Franklin who discovered that storms generally travel from west to east.<br/>
🎧 In addition to new meteorological instruments,<br/>
🎧 other developments contributed to our understanding of the atmosphere.<br/>
🎧 People in different locations began to keep records,<br/>
🎧 and in the mid-nineteenth century,<br/>
🎧 the invention of the telegraph made it possible for these records to be collated.<br/>
🎧 This led, by the end of the nineteenth century, to the first weather services.<br/>
🎧 It was not until the early twentieth century that mathematics and physics became part of meteorology,<br/>
🎧 and we'll continue from that point next week.<br/>
<br/><br/>
