🎧 Hi, come and take a <span>seat</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 My <span>name's</span> <span>Carl</span> <span>Rogers</span> and I'm one of the <span>doctors</span> here at the <span>Total</span> <span>Health</span> <span>Clinic</span>.<br/>
🎧 So I <span>understand</span> this is your first visit to the <span>clinic</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it is.<br/>
🎧 OK, well I hope you'll be very happy with the <span>service</span> you <span>receive</span> here.<br/>
🎧 So if it's alright with you I'll take a few <span>details</span> to help me give you the best <span>possible</span> <span>service</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 So can I check first of all that we have the <span>correct</span> personal <span>details</span> for you?<br/>
🎧 So your full name is <span>Julie</span> <span>Anne</span> <span>Garcia</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's <span>correct</span>.<br/>
🎧 Perfect. And can I have a <span>contact</span> phone number?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>2194429785</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, and then can I just check that we have the <span>correct</span> date of <span>birth</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>October</span> <span>10th</span>, <span>1992</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I actually have <span>1991</span>,<br/>
🎧 I'll just <span>correct</span> that now.<br/>
🎧 Right, so that's all good.<br/>
🎧 Now I just need a few more personal <span>details…<br/></span>
🎧 do you have an <span>occupation</span>, either <span>full-time</span> or <span>part-time</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I work <span>full-time</span> in <span>Esterhazy's</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 you know, the <span>restaurant</span> <span>chain</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>started</span> off as a <span>waitress</span> there a few years ago and I'm a <span>manager</span> now.<br/>
🎧 Oh I know them, yeah, they're down on <span>114th</span> <span>Street</span>, aren't they?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I've been there a few <span>times</span>.<br/>
🎧 I just love their <span>salads</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's good to hear.<br/>
🎧 Right, so one more thing I need to know before we talk about why you're here, <span>Julie</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that's the name of your <span>insurance</span> company.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>Cawley</span> Life <span>Insurance</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's <span>CAWLEY</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Excellent</span>, thank you so much.<br/>
🎧 Now <span>Julie</span>, let's look at how we can help you.<br/>
🎧 So tell me a little about what <span>brought</span> you here today.<br/>
🎧 Well, I've been getting a <span>pain</span> in my <span>knee</span>, the <span>left</span> one.<br/>
🎧 Not very serious at first, but it's <span>gotten</span> <span>worse</span>,<br/>
🎧 so I thought I <span>ought</span> to see <span>someone</span> about it.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>certainly</span> the right <span>decision</span>.<br/>
🎧 So how long have you been <span>aware</span> of this <span>pain</span>?<br/>
🎧 Is it just a few <span>days</span>, or is it <span>longer</span> than that?<br/>
🎧 <span>Longer</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's been <span>worse</span> for the last <span>couple</span> of <span>days</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it's <span>three</span> <span>weeks</span> since I first <span>noticed</span> it.<br/>
🎧 It came on quite <span>gradually</span> though, so I kind of <span>ignored</span> it at first.<br/>
🎧 And have you taken any <span>medication</span> yourself, or <span>treated</span> it in any way?<br/>
🎧 <span>Um.</span>. yeah, I've been taking <span>medication</span> to <span>deal</span> with the <span>pain..</span>. <span>Tylenol<br/></span>
🎧 and that <span>works</span> OK for a few hours.<br/>
🎧 But I don't like to keep taking it.<br/>
🎧 OK. And what about <span>heat</span> <span>treatment</span>?<br/>
🎧 Have you <span>tried</span> <span>applying</span> <span>heat</span> at all?<br/>
🎧 No, but I have been <span>using</span> ice on it for the last few <span>days</span>.<br/>
🎧 And does that <span>seem</span> to help the <span>pain</span> at all?<br/>
🎧 A little, yes.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 Now you look as if you're quite fit <span>normally</span>?<br/>
🎧 I am, yes.<br/>
🎧 So do you do any <span>sport</span> on a <span>regular</span> <span>basis</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I play a lot of <span>tennis</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>belong</span> to a <span>club</span> so I go there a lot.<br/>
🎧 I'm quite <span>competitive</span> so I enjoy that side of it as well as the <span>exercise</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I haven't <span>gone</span> since this <span>started</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 And do you do any other <span>types</span> of <span>exercise</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I sometimes do a little <span>swimming</span>,<br/>
🎧 but usually just when I'm on <span>vacation</span>.<br/>
🎧 But <span>normally</span> I go <span>running</span> a few <span>times</span> a week, maybe <span>three</span> or <span>four</span> <span>times</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>. So your <span>legs</span> are getting quite a <span>pounding</span>.<br/>
🎧 But you haven't had any <span>problems</span> up to now?<br/>
🎧 No, not with my <span>legs</span>.<br/>
🎧 I did have an <span>accident</span> last year when I <span>slipped</span> and <span>hurt</span> my <span>shoulder</span>,<br/>
🎧 but that's better now.<br/>
🎧 <span>Excellent</span>.<br/>
🎧 And do you have any <span>allergies</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, <span>none</span> that I'm <span>aware</span> of.<br/>
🎧 And do you take any <span>medication</span> on a <span>regular</span> <span>basis</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I take <span>vitamins</span> but that's all.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>generally</span> very <span>healthy</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, well let's have a <span>closer</span> look and see what might be <span>causing</span> this <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you can just get <span>up…<br/></span>

🎧 We'll be <span>arriving</span> at <span>Branley</span> <span>Castle</span> in about <span>five</span> <span>minutes</span>,<br/>
🎧 but before we get there I'll give you a little <span>information</span> about the <span>castle</span> and what our visit will <span>include</span>.<br/>
🎧 So in <span>fact</span> there's been a <span>castle</span> on this <span>site</span> for over <span>1100</span> years.<br/>
🎧 The first <span>building</span> was a <span>fort</span> <span>constructed</span> in <span>914</span> <span>AD<br/></span>
🎧 for <span>defence</span> <span>against</span> <span>Danish</span> <span>invaders</span> by <span>King</span> <span>Alfred</span> the <span>Great's</span> <span>daughter</span>,<br/>
🎧 who <span>ruled</span> <span>England</span> at the time.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>following</span> <span>century</span>, after the <span>Normans</span> <span>conquered</span> <span>England</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>land</span> was <span>given</span> to a <span>nobleman</span> called <span>Richard</span> <span>de</span> <span>Vere</span>,<br/>
🎧 and he <span>built</span> a <span>castle</span> there that <span>stayed</span> in the <span>de</span> <span>Vere</span> <span>family</span> for over <span>400</span> years.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, when <span>Queen</span> <span>Elizabeth</span> I <span>announced</span> that she was going to visit the <span>castle</span> in <span>1576<br/></span>
🎧 it was <span>beginning</span> to look a bit run down,<br/>
🎧 and it was <span>decided</span> that rather than <span>repair</span> the <span>guest</span> <span>rooms</span>,<br/>
🎧 they'd make a new house for her out of <span>wood</span> next to the <span>main</span> <span>hall</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>stayed</span> there for <span>four</span> <span>nights</span> and <span>apparently</span> it was very <span>luxurious</span>,<br/>
🎧 but <span>unfortunately</span> it was <span>destroyed</span> a few years later by <span>fire</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>seventeenth</span> <span>century</span> the <span>castle</span> <span>belonged</span> to the <span>wealthy</span> <span>Fenys</span> <span>family</span>,<br/>
🎧 who <span>enlarged</span> it and made it more <span>comfortable</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, by <span>1982</span> the <span>Fenys</span> <span>family</span> could no <span>longer</span> <span>afford</span> to <span>maintain</span> the <span>castle</span>,<br/>
🎧 even though they <span>received</span> <span>government</span> <span>support</span>, and they put it on the <span>market</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>eventually</span> taken over by a company who <span>owned</span> a number of <span>amusement</span> <span>parks</span>,<br/>
🎧 but when we get there I think you'll see that <span>they've</span> <span>managed</span> to <span>retain</span> the <span>original</span> <span>atmosphere</span> of the <span>castle</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you go inside, you'll find that in the <span>state</span> <span>rooms<br/></span>
🎧 there are <span>life-like</span> <span>moving</span> <span>wax</span> <span>models</span> <span>dressed</span> in <span>costumes</span> of different <span>periods</span> in the <span>past</span>,<br/>
🎧 which even <span>carry</span> on <span>conversations</span> together.<br/>
🎧 As well as that, in every room there are <span>booklets</span> <span>giving</span> <span>information</span> about what the room was used <span>for<br/></span>
🎧 and the <span>history</span> of the <span>objects</span> and <span>furniture</span> it <span>contains</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>castle</span> <span>park's</span> quite <span>extensive</span>.<br/>
🎧 At one time <span>sheep</span> were <span>kept</span> there,<br/>
🎧 and in the <span>nineteenth</span> <span>century</span> the <span>owners</span> had a little zoo with <span>animals</span> like <span>rabbits<br/></span>
🎧 and even a <span>baby</span> <span>elephant</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Nowadays</span> the old zoo <span>buildings</span> are used for <span>public</span> <span>displays</span> of <span>paintings</span> and <span>sculpture</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>park</span> also has some <span>beautiful</span> <span>trees</span>,<br/>
🎧 though the <span>oldest</span> of all, which <span>dated</span> back <span>800</span> years,<br/>
🎧 was <span>sadly</span> <span>blown</span> down in <span>1987</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, you're free to <span>wander</span> around on your own until <span>4.30<br/></span>
🎧 but then at the end of our <span>visit<br/></span>
🎧 we'll all meet together at the <span>bottom</span> of the Great <span>Staircase</span>.<br/>
🎧 We'll then go on to the long <span>gallery</span>,<br/>
🎧 where there's a wonderful <span>collection</span> of <span>photographs</span> <span>showing</span> the <span>family</span> who <span>owned</span> the <span>castle</span> a <span>hundred</span> years <span>ago<br/></span>
🎧 having tea and <span>cakes</span> in the <span>conservatory</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and we'll then take you to the same place,<br/>
🎧 where <span>afternoon</span> tea will be <span>served</span> to you.<br/>
🎧 Now if you can take a look at your <span>plans</span> you'll see <span>Branley</span> <span>Castle</span> has <span>four</span> <span>towers</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>joined</span> together by a high <span>wall</span>, with the <span>river</span> on two <span>sides</span>.<br/>
🎧 Don't <span>miss</span> <span>seeing</span> the Great <span>Hall</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's near the <span>river</span> in the <span>main</span> <span>tower</span>, the <span>biggest</span> one,<br/>
🎧 which was <span>extended</span> and <span>redesigned</span> in the <span>eighteenth</span> <span>century</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you want to get a good <span>view</span> of the whole <span>castle</span>, you can <span>walk</span> around the <span>walls</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>starting</span> <span>point's</span> quite near the <span>main</span> <span>entrance</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>walk</span> <span>straight</span> down the <span>path</span> until you get to the <span>south</span> <span>gate</span>, and it's just there.<br/>
🎧 Don't go on to the <span>north</span> <span>gate</span> <span>-</span> there's no way up from there.<br/>
🎧 <span>There'll</span> <span>shortly</span> be a show in which you can see <span>archers</span> <span>displaying</span> their <span>skill</span> with a <span>bow</span> and <span>arrow</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>quickest</span> way to get there is to take the first <span>left</span> after the <span>main</span> <span>entrance<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>follow</span> the <span>path</span> <span>past</span> the <span>bridge</span>,<br/>
🎧 then you'll see it in <span>front</span> of you at the end.<br/>
🎧 If you like <span>animals</span> there's also a <span>display</span> of <span>hunting</span> <span>birds</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>falcons</span> and <span>eagles</span> and so on.<br/>
🎧 If you go from the <span>main</span> <span>entrance</span> in the <span>direction</span> of the <span>south</span> <span>gate</span>,<br/>
🎧 but <span>turn</span> right before you get there <span>instead</span> of going through it,<br/>
🎧 you'll see it on your right <span>past</span> the first <span>tower</span>.<br/>
🎧 At <span>3</span> pm there's a short <span>performance</span> of <span>traditional</span> <span>dancing</span> on the <span>outdoor</span> <span>stage</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's right at the other side of the <span>castle</span> from the <span>entrance</span>, and over the <span>bridge</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's about ten <span>minutes'</span> <span>walk</span> or so.<br/>
🎧 And finally, the <span>shop<br/></span>
🎧 It's actually inside one of the <span>towers</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the way in is from the outside.<br/>
🎧 Just take the first <span>left</span> after the <span>main</span> <span>entrance</span>, go down the <span>path</span> and take the first right.<br/>
🎧 It's got some <span>lovely</span> <span>gifts</span> and <span>souvenirs</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, so we're just <span>arriving…<br/></span>
<br />

🎧 So, <span>Rosie</span> and <span>Martin</span>,<br/>
🎧 let's look at what you've got for your <span>presentation</span> on <span>woolly</span> <span>mammoths</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, we've got a short <span>outline</span> here.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 So it's about a <span>research</span> <span>project</span> in <span>North</span> <span>America</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 But we thought we <span>needed</span> something <span>general</span> about <span>woolly</span> <span>mammoths</span> in our <span>introduction</span>,<br/>
🎧 to <span>establish</span> that they were <span>related</span> to our <span>modern</span> <span>elephant</span>,<br/>
🎧 and they <span>lived</span> <span>thousands</span> of years ago in the last ice age.<br/>
🎧 Maybe we could show a <span>video</span> <span>clip</span> of a <span>cartoon</span> about <span>mammoths</span>.<br/>
🎧 But that'd be a bit <span>childish</span>.<br/>
🎧 Or we could have a <span>diagram</span>,<br/>
🎧 it could be a <span>timeline</span> to show when they <span>lived</span>, with <span>illustrations</span>?<br/>
🎧 Or we could just show a <span>drawing</span> of them <span>walking</span> in the ice?<br/>
🎧 No, let's go with your last <span>suggestion</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 Then you're <span>describing</span> the <span>discovery</span> of the <span>mammoth</span> <span>tooth</span> on <span>St</span> <span>Paul's</span> <span>Island</span> in <span>Alaska</span>,<br/>
🎧 and why it was <span>significant</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 The <span>tooth</span> was <span>found</span> by a man called <span>Russell</span> <span>Graham</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>picked</span> it up from under a <span>rock</span> in a <span>cave</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>knew</span> it was special <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 for a start it was in really good <span>condition</span>,<br/>
🎧 as if it had been just <span>extracted</span> from the <span>animal's</span> <span>jawbone</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, they <span>found</span> it was <span>6,500</span> years old.<br/>
🎧 So why was that <span>significant</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well the <span>mammoth</span> <span>bones</span> <span>previously</span> <span>found</span> on the <span>North</span> <span>American</span> <span>mainland</span> were much less <span>recent</span> than that.<br/>
🎧 So this was really amazing.<br/>
🎧 Then we're <span>making</span> an <span>animated</span> <span>diagram</span> to show the <span>geography</span> of the <span>area</span> in <span>prehistoric</span> <span>times</span>.<br/>
🎧 So <span>originally</span>, <span>St</span> <span>Paul's</span> <span>Island</span> wasn't an <span>island</span>,<br/>
🎧 it was <span>connected</span> to the <span>mainland</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>mammoths</span> and other <span>animals</span> like <span>bears</span> were able to <span>roam</span> around the whole <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then the <span>climate</span> <span>warmed</span> up and the sea <span>level</span> <span>began</span> to <span>rise</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>island</span> got cut off from the <span>mainland</span>.<br/>
🎧 So those <span>mammoths</span> on the <span>island</span> couldn't <span>escape;<br/></span>
🎧 they had to <span>stay</span> on the <span>island</span>.<br/>
🎧 And in <span>fact</span> the <span>species</span> <span>survived</span> there for <span>thousands</span> of <span>years<br/></span>
🎧 after they'd become <span>extinct</span> on the <span>mainland</span>.<br/>
🎧 So why do you think they <span>died</span> out on the <span>mainland</span>?<br/>
🎧 No <span>one's</span> sure.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, next we'll <span>explain</span> how <span>Graham</span> and his <span>team</span> <span>identified</span> the date when the <span>mammoths</span> <span>became</span> <span>extinct</span> on the <span>island</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>concluded</span> that the <span>extinction</span> <span>happened</span> <span>5,600</span> years ago,<br/>
🎧 which is a very <span>precise</span> time for a <span>prehistoric</span> <span>extinction</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>based</span> on <span>samples</span> they took from <span>mud</span> at the <span>bottom</span> of a <span>lake</span> on the <span>island</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>analysed</span> it to find out what had <span>fallen</span> in over time <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>bits</span> of <span>plants</span>, <span>volcanic</span> <span>ash</span> and even <span>DNA</span> from the <span>mammoths</span> <span>themselves</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>standard</span> <span>procedure</span>, but it took <span>nearly</span> two years to do.<br/>
🎧 So why don't you quickly go through the <span>main</span> <span>sections</span> of your <span>presentation<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>discuss</span> what <span>action's</span> <span>needed</span> for each <span>part</span>?<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So for the <span>introduction</span>, we're <span>using</span> a <span>visual</span>,<br/>
🎧 so once we've <span>prepared</span> that we're done.<br/>
🎧 I'm not sure.<br/>
🎧 I think we need to <span>write</span> down all the <span>ideas</span> we want to <span>include</span> here,<br/>
🎧 not just <span>rely</span> on <span>memory</span>.<br/>
🎧 How we <span>begin</span> the <span>presentation</span> is so <span>important…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Umm</span>, you're right.<br/>
🎧 The <span>discovery</span> of the <span>mammoth</span> <span>tooth</span> is probably the most <span>dramatic</span> <span>part</span>,<br/>
🎧 but we don't have that much <span>information</span>,<br/>
🎧 only what we got from the online <span>article</span>.<br/>
🎧 I thought maybe we could get in touch with the <span>researcher</span> who <span>led</span> the <span>team<br/></span>
🎧 and ask him to tell us a bit more.<br/>
🎧 Great idea.<br/>
🎧 What about the <span>section</span> with the <span>initial</span> <span>questions</span> <span>asked</span> by the <span>researchers</span>?<br/>
🎧 We've got a lot on that but we need to make it <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 We could ask the <span>audience</span> to <span>suggest</span> some <span>questions</span> about <span>it<br/></span>
🎧 and then see how many of them we can answer.<br/>
🎧 I don't think it would take too long.<br/>
🎧 Yes that would add a bit of <span>variety</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then the <span>section</span> on <span>further</span> <span>research</span> <span>carried</span> out on the <span>island</span> <span>-</span> <span>analysing</span> the <span>mud</span> in the <span>lake</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>wonder</span> if we've actually got too much <span>information</span> here,<br/>
🎧 should we cut some?<br/>
🎧 I don't think so,<br/>
🎧 but it's all a bit <span>muddled</span> at <span>present</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, maybe it would be better if it <span>followed</span> a <span>chronological</span> <span>pattern</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think so.<br/>
🎧 The <span>findings</span> and <span>possible</span> <span>explanations</span> <span>section</span> is just about ready,<br/>
🎧 but we need to practice it so we're sure it won't <span>overrun</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think it should be OK,<br/>
🎧 but yes, let's make sure.<br/>
🎧 In the last <span>section</span>, <span>relevance</span> to the <span>present</span> day,<br/>
🎧 you've got some good <span>ideas</span> <span>but..</span>.<br/>
🎧 this is where you need to move away from the <span>ideas</span> of <span>others</span> and give your own <span>viewpoint</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, we'll think about that.<br/>
🎧 Now shall <span>we…<br/></span>

🎧 In this <span>series</span> of <span>lectures</span> about the <span>history</span> of <span>weather</span> <span>forecasting</span>,<br/>
🎧 I'll start by <span>examining</span> its <span>early</span> <span>history</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>that'll</span> be the <span>subject</span> of <span>today's</span> talk.<br/>
🎧 Ok, so we'll start by going back <span>thousands</span> of years.<br/>
🎧 Most <span>ancient</span> <span>cultures</span> had <span>weather</span> <span>gods</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>weather</span> <span>catastrophes</span>, such as <span>floods</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>played</span> an important <span>role</span> in many <span>creation</span> <span>myths</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Generally</span>, <span>weather</span> was <span>attributed</span> to the <span>whims</span> of the <span>gods</span>,<br/>
🎧 as the <span>wide</span> <span>range</span> of <span>weather</span> <span>gods</span> in <span>various</span> <span>cultures</span> <span>shows</span>.<br/>
🎧 For <span>instance</span>, there's the <span>Egyptian</span> sun <span>god</span> <span>Ra</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>Thor</span>, the <span>Norse</span> <span>god</span> of <span>thunder</span> and <span>lightning</span>.<br/>
🎧 Many <span>ancient</span> <span>civilisations</span> <span>developed</span> <span>rites</span> such as <span>dances<br/></span>
🎧 in order to make the <span>weather</span> <span>gods</span> look <span>kindly</span> on them.<br/>
🎧 But the <span>weather</span> was of <span>daily</span> <span>importance</span>:<br/>
🎧 <span>observing</span> the <span>skies</span> and <span>drawing</span> the <span>correct</span> <span>conclusions</span> from these <span>observations</span> was really important,<br/>
🎧 in <span>fact</span> their <span>survival</span> <span>depended</span> on it.<br/>
🎧 It isn't <span>known</span> when people first <span>started</span> to <span>observe</span> the <span>skies</span>,<br/>
🎧 but at around <span>650</span> <span>BC</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>Babylonians</span> <span>produced</span> the first <span>short-range</span> <span>weather</span> <span>forecasts</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>based</span> on their <span>observations</span> of <span>clouds</span> and other <span>phenomena</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Chinese</span> also <span>recognised</span> <span>weather</span> <span>patterns</span>,<br/>
🎧 and by <span>300</span> <span>BC</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>astronomers</span> had <span>developed</span> a <span>calendar</span> which <span>divided</span> the year into <span>24</span> <span>festivals</span>,<br/>
🎧 each <span>associated</span> with a different <span>weather</span> <span>phenomenon</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>ancient</span> <span>Greeks</span> were the first to <span>develop</span> a more <span>scientific</span> <span>approach</span> to <span>explaining</span> the <span>weather</span>.<br/>
🎧 The work of the <span>philosopher</span> and <span>scientist</span> <span>Aristotle</span>, in the <span>fourth</span> <span>century</span> <span>BC</span>, is <span>especially</span> <span>noteworthy</span>,<br/>
🎧 as his <span>ideas</span> <span>held</span> <span>sway</span> for <span>nearly</span> <span>2,000</span> years.<br/>
🎧 In <span>340</span> <span>BC</span>,<br/>
🎧 he <span>wrote</span> a book in which he <span>attempted</span> to <span>account</span> for the <span>formation</span> of <span>rain</span>, <span>clouds</span>, <span>wind</span> and <span>storms</span>.<br/>
🎧 He also <span>described</span> <span>celestial</span> <span>phenomena</span> such as <span>haloes</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 that is, <span>bright</span> <span>circles</span> of <span>light</span> around the sun, the <span>moon</span> and <span>bright</span> <span>stars</span> <span>-</span> and <span>comets</span>.<br/>
🎧 Many of his <span>observations</span> were <span>surprisingly</span> <span>accurate</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, he <span>believed</span> that <span>heat</span> could <span>cause</span> water to <span>evaporate</span>.<br/>
🎧 But he also <span>jumped</span> to quite a few wrong <span>conclusions</span>,<br/>
🎧 such as that <span>winds</span> are <span>breathed</span> out by the <span>Earth</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Errors</span> like this were <span>rectified</span> from the <span>Renaissance</span> <span>onwards</span>.<br/>
🎧 For <span>nearly</span> <span>2,000</span> years,<br/>
🎧 <span>Aristotle's</span> work was <span>accepted</span> as the <span>chief</span> <span>authority</span> on <span>weather</span> <span>theory</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Alongside</span> this, though, in the <span>Middle</span> <span>Ages</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>weather</span> <span>observations</span> were <span>passed</span> on in the <span>form</span> of <span>proverbs</span>,<br/>
🎧 such as <span>'Red</span> sky at <span>night</span>, <span>shepherd's</span> <span>delight;</span> red sky in the morning, <span>shepherd's</span> <span>warning'</span>.<br/>
🎧 Many of these are <span>based</span> on very good <span>observations</span> and are <span>accurate</span>,<br/>
🎧 as <span>contemporary</span> <span>meteorologists</span> have <span>discovered</span>.<br/>
🎧 For <span>centuries</span>, any <span>attempt</span> to <span>forecast</span> the <span>weather</span> could only be <span>based</span> on personal <span>observations</span>,<br/>
🎧 but in the <span>fifteenth</span> <span>century</span> <span>scientists</span> <span>began</span> to see the need for <span>instruments</span>.<br/>
🎧 Until then, the only <span>ones</span> <span>available</span> were <span>weathervanes</span> <span>-</span> to <span>determine</span> the <span>wind</span> <span>direction</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>early</span> <span>versions</span> of <span>rain</span> <span>gauges</span>.<br/>
🎧 One of the first, <span>invented</span> in the <span>fifteenth</span> <span>century</span>, was a <span>hygrometer</span>, which <span>measured</span> <span>humidity</span>.<br/>
🎧 This was one of many <span>inventions</span> that <span>contributed</span> to the <span>development</span> of <span>weather</span> <span>forecasting</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>1592</span>, the <span>Italian</span> <span>scientist</span> and <span>inventor</span> <span>Galileo</span> <span>developed</span> the <span>world's</span> first <span>thermometer</span>.<br/>
🎧 His student <span>Torricelli</span> later <span>invented</span> the <span>barometer</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>allowed</span> people to <span>measure</span> <span>atmospheric</span> <span>pressure</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>1648</span>, the <span>French</span> <span>philosopher</span> <span>Pascal</span> <span>proved</span> that <span>pressure</span> <span>decreases</span> with <span>altitude</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>discovery</span> was <span>verified</span> by English <span>astronomer</span> <span>Halley</span> in <span>1686</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>Halley</span> was also the first person to map <span>trade</span> <span>winds</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>increasing</span> <span>ability</span> to <span>measure</span> <span>factors</span> <span>related</span> to <span>weather<br/></span>
🎧 <span>helped</span> <span>scientists</span> to <span>understand</span> the <span>atmosphere</span> and its <span>processes</span> better,<br/>
🎧 and they <span>started</span> <span>collecting</span> <span>weather</span> <span>observation</span> <span>data</span> <span>systematically</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>18th</span> <span>century</span>, the <span>scientist</span> and <span>politician</span> <span>Benjamin</span> <span>Franklin<br/></span>
🎧 <span>carried</span> out work on <span>electricity</span> and <span>lightning</span> in <span>particular</span>,<br/>
🎧 but he was also very interested in <span>weather</span> and <span>studied</span> it <span>throughout</span> most of his life.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>Franklin</span> who <span>discovered</span> that <span>storms</span> <span>generally</span> travel from <span>west</span> to <span>east</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>addition</span> to new <span>meteorological</span> <span>instruments</span>,<br/>
🎧 other <span>developments</span> <span>contributed</span> to our <span>understanding</span> of the <span>atmosphere</span>.<br/>
🎧 People in different <span>locations</span> <span>began</span> to keep <span>records</span>,<br/>
🎧 and in the <span>mid-nineteenth</span> <span>century</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>invention</span> of the <span>telegraph</span> made it <span>possible</span> for these <span>records</span> to be <span>collated</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>led</span>, by the end of the <span>nineteenth</span> <span>century</span>, to the first <span>weather</span> <span>services</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was not until the <span>early</span> <span>twentieth</span> <span>century</span> that <span>mathematics</span> and <span>physics</span> <span>became</span> <span>part</span> of <span>meteorology</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we'll <span>continue</span> from that <span>point</span> next week.<br/>
