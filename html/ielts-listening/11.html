🎧 Good morning, please take a seat.<br/>
🎧 How can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm thinking of buying a new car and I'd like some advice.<br/>
🎧 Sure, yes.<br/>
🎧 Had you got any particular make in mind?<br/>
🎧 I'm interested in a Lida,<br/>
🎧 I've had one before and liked it but haven't really made up my mind.<br/>
🎧 Sure. We've got various models.<br/>
🎧 Umm, right.<br/>
🎧 What about the engine size? Any ideas?<br/>
🎧 Er... the one I've got at the moment's a 1.2 litre engine but<br/>
🎧 I find it a bit slow on long journeys.<br/>
🎧 I'd like a bit more power this time...<br/>
🎧 a 1.4 should do,<br/>
🎧 I don't think I need a 1.6 or anything.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Well, I think the model you're looking at is the Max.<br/>
🎧 Here's a picture.<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes...<br/>
🎧 have you got one in?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 I'll take you to have a look at it in a minute.<br/>
🎧 I'll just get a few more details.<br/>
🎧 Is there anything else to do with the engine?<br/>
🎧 What kind of gear change do you want?<br/>
🎧 I presume you'd want a manual?<br/>
🎧 I'd want automatic -<br/>
🎧 I've never driven a car with manual gears.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Well now, here's the colour chart for the Max.<br/>
🎧 Have you given that any thought?<br/>
🎧 This blue's very popular at the moment.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it is nice, I like blue.<br/>
🎧 Erm... what's it called? 'Royal'?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 But actually, I think I prefer this lighter shade here - 'Sky'.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's popular too.<br/>
🎧 I think I'll go for that.<br/>
🎧 You might have to wait a week or so for that colour,<br/>
🎧 but I assume that'd be okay?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, fine.<br/>
🎧 Well, we can go outside and you can have a good look at one,<br/>
🎧 and perhaps take it out.<br/>
🎧 But first, can I just ask you about finance?<br/>
🎧 The cash price is going to be somewhere in the region of 7500.<br/>
🎧 How would you like to pay?<br/>
🎧 Are you in a position to pay cash, or would you need credit?<br/>
🎧 I'd like credit provided the terms are reasonable.<br/>
🎧 Well you can discuss that with my colleague in a moment;<br/>
🎧 we have various arrangements.<br/>
🎧 And would you be interested in us taking your present car as part exchange?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Okay, fine.<br/>
🎧 So I'll just need some details from you and then we can do a valuation...<br/>
🎧 Is that okay?<br/>
🎧 Fine, yes.<br/>
🎧 Could I have your full name?<br/>
🎧 Wendy Harries,<br/>
🎧 that's HARRIES.<br/>
🎧 And is that Mrs..?. Miss...? Ms...?<br/>
🎧 It's Doctor, actually.<br/>
🎧 Oh, right.<br/>
🎧 And your address?<br/>
🎧 20 Green Banks.<br/>
🎧 Is that 'Green' spelled as in the colour?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's right.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Alton.<br/>
🎧 Is that OLTON?<br/>
🎧 Not quite, it begins with an A, not an O.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, that's in Hampshire isn't it?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 And do you know your postcode?<br/>
🎧 Yes. It's GU89EW.<br/>
🎧 Do you have a daytime phone number?<br/>
🎧 Well, I work at a hospital but it's a bit difficult to get hold of me.<br/>
🎧 I can give you a number just for messages,<br/>
🎧 and then I'll get back to you when I can. Is that okay?<br/>
🎧 That's fine.<br/>
🎧 It's 0798257643.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 And about the car you have now, what make is it?<br/>
🎧 It's a Conti.<br/>
🎧 Do you know the year or the model name?<br/>
🎧 I think it's 1996, and it's called a Lion - like the animal.<br/>
🎧 Then it must be 1994, because they brought out the Fox after that.<br/>
🎧 Oh right, yes.<br/>
🎧 Mileage? Roughly?<br/>
🎧 I'm not sure.<br/>
🎧 I know it's less than 70,000.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 What colour is it?<br/>
🎧 It's grey, metallic grey.<br/>
🎧 Right, and one last thing -<br/>
🎧 what sort of condition would you say it's in?<br/>
🎧 I'd probably describe it as reasonable.<br/>
🎧 Do you need to see it? It's parked outside.<br/>
🎧 Not at the moment, no.<br/>
🎧 Perhaps you could call in one day next week...<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 As I said earlier,<br/>
🎧 there is, I think, at Rexford, an excellent combination of physical and geographical advantages -<br/>
🎧 as well as having a rural setting and still being close to central London,<br/>
🎧 something that will certainly be of interest to you<br/>
🎧 is that Rexford is just 35 minutes from London Airport.<br/>
🎧 At Rexford we have a strong research capability.<br/>
🎧 We came 7th out of 101 universities in last year's research assessment,<br/>
🎧 carried out by a government body<br/>
🎧 and did particularly well in your particular subjects, engineering and science.<br/>
🎧 Actually we got a top research grade of five for engineering, geography and computer sciences.<br/>
🎧 One further point - and I know from talking to you individually<br/>
🎧 that a number of you may be looking for some experience in industry after the course -<br/>
🎧 is that all our science and engineering research departments<br/>
🎧 have unusually close relationships with industry in the area.<br/>
🎧 Anyway, that's enough sales talk from me...<br/>
🎧 I'll just take a sip of this coffee that's just arrived, thank you,<br/>
🎧 and then I'll say something about what actually happens when you apply.<br/>
🎧 Right... Now if you do decide to make an application,<br/>
🎧 what you do is send it directly to me in my department.<br/>
🎧 I will then immediately send confirmation and the application process begins.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to say at this point that you shouldn't worry if this process doesn't work all that quickly -<br/>
🎧 I mean occasionally there are postal problems,<br/>
🎧 but most often, the hold-up is caused by references -<br/>
🎧 the people you give as referees,<br/>
🎧 shall we say, take their time to reply.<br/>
🎧 Anyway, it's absolutely normal for this process to take three to four months.<br/>
🎧 What I do in this period is keep in touch with you<br/>
🎧 and reassure you that things are moving along.<br/>
🎧 One of the ways we've devised to help you decide about applying<br/>
🎧 as well as later when you've been accepted... hopefully...<br/>
🎧 is to put you in contact with, if possible, a student from your own country<br/>
🎧 who is at present studying with us.<br/>
🎧 What you can do is phone them up -<br/>
🎧 we will, of course, liaise between you<br/>
🎧 and discuss your concerns with them.<br/>
🎧 That way you can get an objective opinion of what you can expect<br/>
🎧 if you come to live and study at Rexford -<br/>
🎧 not only the academic atmosphere<br/>
🎧 but important details like what the leisure facilities are like<br/>
🎧 and whether the English weather and food are really as awful as everybody says!<br/>
🎧 If you decide you can face it,<br/>
🎧 the contact can also help you just before you leave,<br/>
🎧 with tips on what to pack and that sort of thing.<br/>
🎧 At the moment I think we've got two second-year students<br/>
🎧 and one postgraduate from this country.<br/>
🎧 Now to move on to the other concerns you expressed earlier.<br/>
🎧 At a UK university - as I'm sure you know -<br/>
🎧 you will be in an environment where independent learning is the norm,<br/>
🎧 which takes most students a while to adjust to,<br/>
🎧 and at a time when you will be separated from your normal surroundings<br/>
🎧 and, in most cases, your family.<br/>
🎧 This can be a difficult time.<br/>
🎧 But remember that something like 25% of our student body<br/>
🎧 are international students like yourselves,<br/>
🎧 and that there are several organisations in the university and city<br/>
🎧 whose main purpose is to offer help<br/>
🎧 and ensure that your time with us is enjoyable and useful.<br/>
🎧 One or two of you touched on the subject of accommodation earlier.<br/>
🎧 So I'll just add a few points:<br/>
🎧 it is the University's policy to give priority in the allocation of residence places to three categories,<br/>
🎧 and those are: visiting students, exchange students and new postgraduate students.<br/>
🎧 However, demand exceeds supply,<br/>
🎧 so there is still a need to put your name down early for campus accommodation,<br/>
🎧 particularly if your family is accompanying you.<br/>
🎧 This means that the earlier you decide whether you want to study with us...<br/>
🎧 and so get the procedure moving, the better it will be for everybody.<br/>
🎧 Erm... Yes?<br/>
🎧 What if you would prefer to live outside the university?<br/>
🎧 If you're planning to live off-campus, you've got to sort things out even earlier.<br/>
🎧 As with everything in short supply,<br/>
🎧 the good accommodation gets snapped up months before the beginning of term -<br/>
🎧 in other words, if you're starting in October,<br/>
🎧 you need to be thinking about it in June or at the very latest July,<br/>
🎧 So you do need to think very carefully about what you need,<br/>
🎧 how much you can afford to pay, well in advance.<br/>
🎧 What you can't do is leave it until a few days before the start of term.<br/>
🎧 The agencies in town are pretty good -<br/>
🎧 it's just a matter of contacting them in good time.<br/>
🎧 Of course, we have a full-time accommodation officer available to help all students.<br/>
🎧 She'll get in touch with you when you're accepted -<br/>
🎧 she's got plenty of contacts in the town and will deal with the agencies on your behalf.<br/>
🎧 One or two of you asked me earlier about your level of spoken English.<br/>
🎧 Obviously most of you have already achieved a lot -<br/>
🎧 I wish I could speak your language half as well.<br/>
🎧 Having said that though,<br/>
🎧 I'm afraid the lecturers will make little or no allowance for the presence of non-native speakers in the audience.<br/>
🎧 So, anything you can do to improve your spoken English -<br/>
🎧 even beyond the pretty high levels most of you have already reached -<br/>
🎧 will help make your stay with us that bit more fun for you.<br/>
🎧 Some extra practice before you arrive is worth more than...<br/>
🎧 for example private lessons afterwards, when you won't really have time.<br/>
🎧 Oh... and one last thing before I invite further questions:<br/>
🎧 it's very important...<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Oh Ben - I just remembered I never filled in that form for Nick.<br/>
🎧 Did you do it?<br/>
🎧 The course feedback form?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 If you want, we can do it together,<br/>
🎧 I've got mine here.<br/>
🎧 Is that OK?<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 Okay, let's have a look then.<br/>
🎧 What do we have to do?<br/>
🎧 Let's fill in the top first,<br/>
🎧 let's see, Course, Course code...<br/>
🎧 Er, it's Communication in Business.<br/>
🎧 Okay, Communication... in.. Business.<br/>
🎧 I do know that, but what's the code?<br/>
🎧 CB16 something,<br/>
🎧 CB162, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Mmm, that's it. Okay and dates.<br/>
🎧 When did we start?<br/>
🎧 I remember, my birthday's on May 4th and it was the day after,<br/>
🎧 it must have been May 5th.<br/>
🎧 Gosh, doesn't seem that long ago, does it?<br/>
🎧 No, and we finish at the end of this week, on Friday, so that's...<br/>
🎧 July 15th?<br/>
🎧 Er 16th, Monday was the 12th.<br/>
🎧 Right, that was the easy bit, now let's have a look -<br/>
🎧 "Please give your comments on the following aspects of the course".<br/>
🎧 Okay, what's the first one?<br/>
🎧 Oh, course organisation.<br/>
🎧 What do you think?<br/>
🎧 Er, clear?<br/>
🎧 It was, wasn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I think the organisation was clear.<br/>
🎧 Okay, anything else for course organisation?<br/>
🎧 Erm... It was a good thing he gave us the course outline at the beginning, in the first session,<br/>
🎧 that was useful, so I'll put that down, shall I?<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 Now, going on to suggestions for improvement,<br/>
🎧 one thing that wasn't so good,<br/>
🎧 I think we could have done a bit more work at the beginning,<br/>
🎧 I mean at the beginning it seemed dead easy.<br/>
🎧 I thought it was going to be really easy<br/>
🎧 and then all of a sudden in the second half of the course, we got a whole load of work,<br/>
🎧 reading to do and essays and things.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, it'd be better if it was more even.<br/>
🎧 Okay, now course delivery,<br/>
🎧 does that mean teaching?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I suppose so.<br/>
🎧 Well, what I thought was really good on this course was the standard of teaching.<br/>
🎧 Actually - I mean some of the teachers were better than others -<br/>
🎧 but the standard generally was fine.<br/>
🎧 Much better than other courses I've been on.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I agree. Let's put that then.<br/>
🎧 What about suggestions for improvement?<br/>
🎧 I didn't think it was all that wonderful when we had great long group discussion sessions that went on for hours and hours.<br/>
🎧 I don't mean we shouldn't have group discussions,<br/>
🎧 just that they shouldn't go on too long.<br/>
🎧 Now, on to materials and equipment.<br/>
🎧 Oh, now what was good about some sessions was the handouts.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I thought all the handouts were good actually, and some were great, with website addresses and everything.<br/>
🎧 One problem though with materials was the key texts.<br/>
🎧 Yes!<br/>
🎧 There just weren't enough copies on reserve in the library.<br/>
🎧 And if you can't get the key texts before the session,<br/>
🎧 how are you supposed to do the reading?<br/>
🎧 And not enough computers.<br/>
🎧 You have to wait ages to get one.<br/>
🎧 OK, testing and evaluation.<br/>
🎧 Well, I don't know, it's hard to say until we've got our written assignments back.<br/>
🎧 Don't talk about it,<br/>
🎧 I only got mine in yesterday, it was a real struggle.<br/>
🎧 I hate to think what mark I'll get.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, but at least we've done the oral presentation.<br/>
🎧 I thought that was good, the way I got my feedback really quickly.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it was.<br/>
🎧 And I liked the way we knew what we'd be evaluated on,<br/>
🎧 we knew the criteria, so we knew we had to think about clarity, organisation, and so on.<br/>
🎧 But I'm not so sure about the written work.<br/>
🎧 One thing I think is that there's just too much, it's really stressful.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, I'd agree<br/>
🎧 and I don't see why they can't let us know the criteria they use for marking.<br/>
🎧 The written assignments?<br/>
🎧 But he told us.<br/>
🎧 No, for the final exams.<br/>
🎧 What are they looking for - what are the criteria?<br/>
🎧 What makes a pass or a fail?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I never thought of that.<br/>
🎧 It'd be really useful.<br/>
🎧 Okay, any other comments?<br/>
🎧 I thought student support was excellent.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, me too.<br/>
🎧 Okay, excellent.<br/>
🎧 Other comments?<br/>
🎧 No. I can't think of anything else.<br/>
🎧 Nor me.<br/>
🎧 Okay, so that's done.<br/>
🎧 Thanks, Ben.<br/>
🎧 No, thank you.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Well, my group has been doing a project on how household waste is recycled in Britain.<br/>
🎧 We were quite shocked to discover that only 9% of people here in the UK<br/>
🎧 make an effort to recycle their household waste.<br/>
🎧 This is a lower figure than in most other European countries,<br/>
🎧 and needs to increase dramatically in the next few years<br/>
🎧 if the government is going to meet its recycling targets.<br/>
🎧 The agreed targets for the UK mean that by 2008 we must reduce our carbon dioxide emissions by 12.5%,<br/>
🎧 compared with 1990.<br/>
🎧 And recycling can help to achieve that goal, in two main ways:<br/>
🎧 the production of recycled glass and paper uses much less energy than producing them from virgin materials,<br/>
🎧 and also recycling reduces greenhouse gas emissions from landfill sites and incineration plants.<br/>
🎧 As part of our project,<br/>
🎧 we carried out a survey of people in the street,<br/>
🎧 and the thing that came up over and over again<br/>
🎧 is that people don't think it's easy enough to recycle their waste.<br/>
🎧 One problem is that there aren't enough 'drop- off' sites,<br/>
🎧 that is, the places where the public are supposed to take their waste.<br/>
🎧 We also discovered that waste that's collected from householders<br/>
🎧 is taken to places called 'bring banks', for sorting and baling into loads.<br/>
🎧 One problem here is taking out everything that shouldn't have been placed in the recycling containers:<br/>
🎧 people put all sorts of things into bottle banks, like plastic bags and even broken umbrellas.<br/>
🎧 All this has to be removed by hand.<br/>
🎧 Another difficulty is that toughened glass used for cooking doesn't fully melt at the temperature required for other glass,<br/>
🎧 and so that also has to be picked out by hand.<br/>
🎧 Glass is easy to recycle because it can be reused over and over again without becoming weaker.<br/>
🎧 Two million tons of glass is thrown away each year,<br/>
🎧 that is, seven billion bottles and jars;<br/>
🎧 but only 500,000 tons of that is collected and recycled.<br/>
🎧 Oddly enough, half the glass that's collected is green,<br/>
🎧 and a lot of that is imported,<br/>
🎧 so more green glass is recycled than the UK needs.<br/>
🎧 As a result, new uses are being developed for recycled glass, particularly green glass,<br/>
🎧 for example, in fibreglass manufacture and water filtration.<br/>
🎧 A company called CLF Aggregates makes a product for roads,<br/>
🎧 and 30% of the material is crushed glass.<br/>
🎧 For recycling paper, Britain comes second in Europe with 40%,<br/>
🎧 behind Germany's amazing 70%.<br/>
🎧 When recycling started, there were quality problems,<br/>
🎧 so it was difficult to use recycled paper in office printers.<br/>
🎧 But these problems have now been solved,<br/>
🎧 and Martin's, based in South London,<br/>
🎧 produces a range of office stationery which is 100% recycled,<br/>
🎧 costs the same as normal paper and is of equally high quality.<br/>
🎧 But this high quality comes at a cost in terms of the waste produced during the process.<br/>
🎧 Over a third of the waste paper that comes in can't be used in the recycled paper,<br/>
🎧 leaving the question of what to do with it.<br/>
🎧 One firm, Papersave, currently sells this to farmers as a soil conditioner,<br/>
🎧 though this practice will soon be banned because of transport costs and the smell,<br/>
🎧 and the company is looking into the possibility of alternative uses.<br/>
🎧 Plastic causes problems, because there are so many different types of plastic in use today,<br/>
🎧 and each one has to be dealt with differently.<br/>
🎧 Pacrite recycles all sorts of things, from bottles to car bumpers,<br/>
🎧 and one of its most successful activities is recycling plastic bottles to make containers<br/>
🎧 which are used all over the country to collect waste.<br/>
🎧 The Save-a-Cup scheme was set up by the vending and plastics industries<br/>
🎧 to recycle as many as possible of the 3.5 billion polystyrene cups used each year.<br/>
🎧 At the moment, 500 million polycups are collected, processed and sold on to other businesses, such as Waterford,<br/>
🎧 which turns the cups into pencils,<br/>
🎧 and Johnson & Jones, a Welsh-based firm,<br/>
🎧 which has developed a wide variety of items, including business cards.<br/>
🎧 Well, to sum up,<br/>
🎧 there seems to be plenty of research going on into how to re-use materials,<br/>
🎧 but the biggest problem is getting people to think about recycling instead of throwing things away.<br/>
🎧 At least doing the research made us much more careful.<br/>
<br/><br/>
