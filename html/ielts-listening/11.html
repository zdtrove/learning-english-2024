🎧 Good morning, please take a <span>seat</span>.<br/>
🎧 How can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm thinking of <span>buying</span> a new car and I'd like some advice.<br/>
🎧 Sure, yes.<br/>
🎧 Had you got any <span>particular</span> make in <span>mind</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm interested in a <span>Lida</span>,<br/>
🎧 I've had one before and <span>liked</span> it but haven't really made up my <span>mind</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sure. We've got <span>various</span> <span>models</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Umm</span>, right.<br/>
🎧 What about the <span>engine</span> size? Any <span>ideas</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Er..</span>. the one I've got at the <span>moment's</span> a <span>1.2</span> <span>litre</span> <span>engine</span> <span>but<br/></span>
🎧 I find it a bit <span>slow</span> on long <span>journeys</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd like a bit more <span>power</span> this <span>time..</span>.<br/>
🎧 a <span>1.4</span> should do,<br/>
🎧 I don't think I need a <span>1.6</span> or anything.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Well, I think the <span>model</span> you're looking at is the <span>Max</span>.<br/>
🎧 Here's a <span>picture</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, <span>yes..</span>.<br/>
🎧 have you got one in?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 I'll take you to have a look at it in a <span>minute</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll just get a few more <span>details</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is there anything else to do with the <span>engine</span>?<br/>
🎧 What kind of <span>gear</span> change do you want?<br/>
🎧 I <span>presume</span> you'd want a <span>manual</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'd want <span>automatic</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 I've never <span>driven</span> a car with <span>manual</span> <span>gears</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Well now, here's the <span>colour</span> <span>chart</span> for the <span>Max</span>.<br/>
🎧 Have you <span>given</span> that any thought?<br/>
🎧 This <span>blue's</span> very <span>popular</span> at the <span>moment</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it is nice, I like <span>blue</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Erm..</span>. what's it called? <span>'Royal'</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 But actually, I think I <span>prefer</span> this <span>lighter</span> <span>shade</span> here <span>-</span> <span>'Sky'</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's <span>popular</span> too.<br/>
🎧 I think I'll go for that.<br/>
🎧 You might have to wait a week or so for that <span>colour</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I <span>assume</span> that'd be okay?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, fine.<br/>
🎧 Well, we can go outside and you can have a good look at one,<br/>
🎧 and <span>perhaps</span> take it out.<br/>
🎧 But first, can I just ask you about <span>finance</span>?<br/>
🎧 The <span>cash</span> <span>price</span> is going to be somewhere in the <span>region</span> of <span>7500</span>.<br/>
🎧 How would you like to pay?<br/>
🎧 Are you in a <span>position</span> to pay <span>cash</span>, or would you need <span>credit</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'd like <span>credit</span> <span>provided</span> the <span>terms</span> are <span>reasonable</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well you can <span>discuss</span> that with my <span>colleague</span> in a <span>moment;<br/></span>
🎧 we have <span>various</span> <span>arrangements</span>.<br/>
🎧 And would you be interested in us taking your <span>present</span> car as <span>part</span> <span>exchange</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Okay, fine.<br/>
🎧 So I'll just need some <span>details</span> from you and then we can do a <span>valuation..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is that okay?<br/>
🎧 Fine, yes.<br/>
🎧 Could I have your full name?<br/>
🎧 <span>Wendy</span> <span>Harries</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's <span>HARRIES</span>.<br/>
🎧 And is that <span>Mrs..?</span>. <span>Miss...</span>? <span>Ms...</span>?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>Doctor</span>, actually.<br/>
🎧 Oh, right.<br/>
🎧 And your <span>address</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>20</span> <span>Green</span> <span>Banks</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is that <span>'Green'</span> <span>spelled</span> as in the <span>colour</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's right.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 <span>Alton</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is that <span>OLTON</span>?<br/>
🎧 Not quite, it <span>begins</span> with an A, not an <span>O</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, that's in <span>Hampshire</span> isn't it?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 And do you know your <span>postcode</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes. It's <span>GU89EW</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you have a <span>daytime</span> phone number?<br/>
🎧 Well, I work at a <span>hospital</span> but it's a bit <span>difficult</span> to get <span>hold</span> of me.<br/>
🎧 I can give you a number just for <span>messages</span>,<br/>
🎧 and then I'll get back to you when I can. Is that okay?<br/>
🎧 That's fine.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>0798257643</span>.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 And about the car you have now, what make is it?<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>Conti</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you know the year or the <span>model</span> name?<br/>
🎧 I think it's <span>1996</span>, and it's called a <span>Lion</span> <span>-</span> like the <span>animal</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then it must be <span>1994</span>, because they <span>brought</span> out the Fox after that.<br/>
🎧 Oh right, yes.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mileage</span>? <span>Roughly</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm not sure.<br/>
🎧 I know it's less than <span>70,000</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 What <span>colour</span> is it?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>grey</span>, <span>metallic</span> <span>grey</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, and one last thing <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 what <span>sort</span> of <span>condition</span> would you say it's in?<br/>
🎧 I'd probably <span>describe</span> it as <span>reasonable</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you need to see it? It's <span>parked</span> outside.<br/>
🎧 Not at the <span>moment</span>, no.<br/>
🎧 <span>Perhaps</span> you could call in one day next <span>week..</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 As I said <span>earlier</span>,<br/>
🎧 there is, I think, at <span>Rexford</span>, an <span>excellent</span> <span>combination</span> of <span>physical</span> and <span>geographical</span> <span>advantages</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 as well as having a <span>rural</span> <span>setting</span> and still being <span>close</span> to <span>central</span> <span>London</span>,<br/>
🎧 something that will <span>certainly</span> be of <span>interest</span> to <span>you<br/></span>
🎧 is that <span>Rexford</span> is just <span>35</span> <span>minutes</span> from <span>London</span> <span>Airport</span>.<br/>
🎧 At <span>Rexford</span> we have a <span>strong</span> <span>research</span> <span>capability</span>.<br/>
🎧 We came <span>7th</span> out of <span>101</span> <span>universities</span> in last <span>year's</span> <span>research</span> <span>assessment</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>carried</span> out by a <span>government</span> <span>body<br/></span>
🎧 and did <span>particularly</span> well in your <span>particular</span> <span>subjects</span>, <span>engineering</span> and <span>science</span>.<br/>
🎧 Actually we got a top <span>research</span> <span>grade</span> of <span>five</span> for <span>engineering</span>, <span>geography</span> and <span>computer</span> <span>sciences</span>.<br/>
🎧 One <span>further</span> <span>point</span> <span>-</span> and I know from talking to you <span>individually<br/></span>
🎧 that a number of you may be looking for some <span>experience</span> in <span>industry</span> after the course <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 is that all our <span>science</span> and <span>engineering</span> <span>research</span> <span>departments<br/></span>
🎧 have <span>unusually</span> <span>close</span> <span>relationships</span> with <span>industry</span> in the <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, that's enough <span>sales</span> talk from <span>me..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll just take a <span>sip</span> of this <span>coffee</span> that's just <span>arrived</span>, thank you,<br/>
🎧 and then I'll say something about what actually <span>happens</span> when you <span>apply</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Right..</span>. Now if you do decide to make an <span>application</span>,<br/>
🎧 what you do is <span>send</span> it <span>directly</span> to me in my <span>department</span>.<br/>
🎧 I will then <span>immediately</span> <span>send</span> <span>confirmation</span> and the <span>application</span> <span>process</span> <span>begins</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to say at this <span>point</span> that you shouldn't <span>worry</span> if this <span>process</span> doesn't work all that quickly <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 I mean <span>occasionally</span> there are <span>postal</span> <span>problems</span>,<br/>
🎧 but most often, the <span>hold-up</span> is <span>caused</span> by <span>references</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 the people you give as <span>referees</span>,<br/>
🎧 shall we say, take their time to <span>reply</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, it's absolutely <span>normal</span> for this <span>process</span> to take <span>three</span> to <span>four</span> <span>months</span>.<br/>
🎧 What I do in this <span>period</span> is keep in touch with <span>you<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>reassure</span> you that things are <span>moving</span> along.<br/>
🎧 One of the <span>ways</span> we've <span>devised</span> to help you decide about <span>applying<br/></span>
🎧 as well as later when you've been <span>accepted..</span>. <span>hopefully..</span>.<br/>
🎧 is to put you in <span>contact</span> with, if <span>possible</span>, a student from your own <span>country<br/></span>
🎧 who is at <span>present</span> <span>studying</span> with us.<br/>
🎧 What you can do is phone them up <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 we will, of course, <span>liaise</span> between <span>you<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>discuss</span> your <span>concerns</span> with them.<br/>
🎧 That way you can get an <span>objective</span> <span>opinion</span> of what you can <span>expect<br/></span>
🎧 if you come to live and <span>study</span> at <span>Rexford</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 not only the <span>academic</span> <span>atmosphere<br/></span>
🎧 but important <span>details</span> like what the <span>leisure</span> <span>facilities</span> are <span>like<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>whether</span> the English <span>weather</span> and food are really as <span>awful</span> as <span>everybody</span> says!<br/>
🎧 If you decide you can <span>face</span> it,<br/>
🎧 the <span>contact</span> can also help you just before you leave,<br/>
🎧 with <span>tips</span> on what to <span>pack</span> and that <span>sort</span> of thing.<br/>
🎧 At the <span>moment</span> I think we've got two <span>second-year</span> <span>students<br/></span>
🎧 and one <span>postgraduate</span> from this <span>country</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now to move on to the other <span>concerns</span> you <span>expressed</span> <span>earlier</span>.<br/>
🎧 At a <span>UK</span> university <span>-</span> as I'm sure you know <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 you will be in an <span>environment</span> where <span>independent</span> <span>learning</span> is the <span>norm</span>,<br/>
🎧 which takes most students a while to <span>adjust</span> to,<br/>
🎧 and at a time when you will be <span>separated</span> from your <span>normal</span> <span>surroundings<br/></span>
🎧 and, in most <span>cases</span>, your <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 This can be a <span>difficult</span> time.<br/>
🎧 But remember that something like <span>25%</span> of our student <span>body<br/></span>
🎧 are <span>international</span> students like <span>yourselves</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that there are <span>several</span> <span>organisations</span> in the university and <span>city<br/></span>
🎧 whose <span>main</span> <span>purpose</span> is to <span>offer</span> <span>help<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>ensure</span> that your time with us is <span>enjoyable</span> and <span>useful</span>.<br/>
🎧 One or two of you <span>touched</span> on the <span>subject</span> of <span>accommodation</span> <span>earlier</span>.<br/>
🎧 So I'll just add a few <span>points:<br/></span>
🎧 it is the <span>University's</span> <span>policy</span> to give <span>priority</span> in the <span>allocation</span> of <span>residence</span> <span>places</span> to <span>three</span> <span>categories</span>,<br/>
🎧 and those <span>are:</span> <span>visiting</span> students, <span>exchange</span> students and new <span>postgraduate</span> students.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, <span>demand</span> <span>exceeds</span> <span>supply</span>,<br/>
🎧 so there is still a need to put your name down <span>early</span> for <span>campus</span> <span>accommodation</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>particularly</span> if your <span>family</span> is <span>accompanying</span> you.<br/>
🎧 This <span>means</span> that the <span>earlier</span> you decide <span>whether</span> you want to <span>study</span> with <span>us..</span>.<br/>
🎧 and so get the <span>procedure</span> <span>moving</span>, the better it will be for <span>everybody</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Erm..</span>. Yes?<br/>
🎧 What if you would <span>prefer</span> to live outside the university?<br/>
🎧 If you're planning to live <span>off-campus</span>, you've got to <span>sort</span> things out even <span>earlier</span>.<br/>
🎧 As with everything in short <span>supply</span>,<br/>
🎧 the good <span>accommodation</span> <span>gets</span> <span>snapped</span> up <span>months</span> before the <span>beginning</span> of <span>term</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 in other <span>words</span>, if you're <span>starting</span> in <span>October</span>,<br/>
🎧 you need to be thinking about it in <span>June</span> or at the very <span>latest</span> <span>July</span>,<br/>
🎧 So you do need to think very <span>carefully</span> about what you need,<br/>
🎧 how much you can <span>afford</span> to pay, well in <span>advance</span>.<br/>
🎧 What you can't do is leave it until a few <span>days</span> before the start of <span>term</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>agencies</span> in <span>town</span> are <span>pretty</span> good <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it's just a <span>matter</span> of <span>contacting</span> them in good time.<br/>
🎧 Of course, we have a <span>full-time</span> <span>accommodation</span> <span>officer</span> <span>available</span> to help all students.<br/>
🎧 She'll get in touch with you when you're <span>accepted</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 she's got <span>plenty</span> of <span>contacts</span> in the <span>town</span> and will <span>deal</span> with the <span>agencies</span> on your <span>behalf</span>.<br/>
🎧 One or two of you <span>asked</span> me <span>earlier</span> about your <span>level</span> of <span>spoken</span> English.<br/>
🎧 <span>Obviously</span> most of you have already <span>achieved</span> a lot <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 I wish I could speak your <span>language</span> <span>half</span> as well.<br/>
🎧 Having said that though,<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>afraid</span> the <span>lecturers</span> will make little or no <span>allowance</span> for the <span>presence</span> of <span>non-native</span> <span>speakers</span> in the <span>audience</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, anything you can do to <span>improve</span> your <span>spoken</span> English <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 even <span>beyond</span> the <span>pretty</span> high <span>levels</span> most of you have already <span>reached</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 will help make your <span>stay</span> with us that bit more fun for you.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>extra</span> practice before you <span>arrive</span> is <span>worth</span> more <span>than..</span>.<br/>
🎧 for example <span>private</span> <span>lessons</span> <span>afterwards</span>, when you won't really have time.<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh..</span>. and one last thing before I <span>invite</span> <span>further</span> <span>questions:<br/></span>
🎧 it's very <span>important..</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>
</span>

🎧 Oh <span>Ben</span> <span>-</span> I just <span>remembered</span> I never <span>filled</span> in that <span>form</span> for <span>Nick</span>.<br/>
🎧 Did you do it?<br/>
🎧 The course <span>feedback</span> <span>form</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 If you want, we can do it together,<br/>
🎧 I've got <span>mine</span> here.<br/>
🎧 Is that OK?<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 Okay, let's have a look then.<br/>
🎧 What do we have to do?<br/>
🎧 Let's <span>fill</span> in the top first,<br/>
🎧 let's see, Course, Course <span>code..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Er</span>, it's <span>Communication</span> in <span>Business</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, <span>Communication..</span>. <span>in.</span>. <span>Business</span>.<br/>
🎧 I do know that, but what's the <span>code</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>CB16</span> something,<br/>
🎧 <span>CB162</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 <span>Mmm</span>, that's it. Okay and <span>dates</span>.<br/>
🎧 When did we start?<br/>
🎧 I remember, my <span>birthday's</span> on May <span>4th</span> and it was the day after,<br/>
🎧 it must have been May <span>5th</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Gosh</span>, doesn't <span>seem</span> that long ago, does it?<br/>
🎧 No, and we <span>finish</span> at the end of this week, on <span>Friday</span>, so <span>that's..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>July</span> <span>15th</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Er</span> <span>16th</span>, <span>Monday</span> was the <span>12th</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, that was the easy bit, now let's have a look <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>"Please</span> give your <span>comments</span> on the <span>following</span> <span>aspects</span> of the <span>course"</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, what's the first one?<br/>
🎧 Oh, course <span>organisation</span>.<br/>
🎧 What do you think?<br/>
🎧 <span>Er</span>, <span>clear</span>?<br/>
🎧 It was, wasn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I think the <span>organisation</span> was <span>clear</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, anything else for course <span>organisation</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Erm..</span>. It was a good thing he gave us the course <span>outline</span> at the <span>beginning</span>, in the first <span>session</span>,<br/>
🎧 that was <span>useful</span>, so I'll put that down, shall I?<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 Now, going on to <span>suggestions</span> for <span>improvement</span>,<br/>
🎧 one thing that wasn't so good,<br/>
🎧 I think we could have done a bit more work at the <span>beginning</span>,<br/>
🎧 I mean at the <span>beginning</span> it <span>seemed</span> <span>dead</span> easy.<br/>
🎧 I thought it was going to be really <span>easy<br/></span>
🎧 and then all of a <span>sudden</span> in the second <span>half</span> of the course, we got a whole <span>load</span> of work,<br/>
🎧 <span>reading</span> to do and <span>essays</span> and things.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, it'd be better if it was more even.<br/>
🎧 Okay, now course <span>delivery</span>,<br/>
🎧 does that mean <span>teaching</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I <span>suppose</span> so.<br/>
🎧 Well, what I thought was really good on this course was the <span>standard</span> of <span>teaching</span>.<br/>
🎧 Actually <span>-</span> I mean some of the <span>teachers</span> were better than <span>others</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 but the <span>standard</span> <span>generally</span> was fine.<br/>
🎧 Much better than other <span>courses</span> I've been on.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I agree. Let's put that then.<br/>
🎧 What about <span>suggestions</span> for <span>improvement</span>?<br/>
🎧 I didn't think it was all that wonderful when we had great long group <span>discussion</span> <span>sessions</span> that went on for hours and hours.<br/>
🎧 I don't mean we shouldn't have group <span>discussions</span>,<br/>
🎧 just that they shouldn't go on too long.<br/>
🎧 Now, on to <span>materials</span> and <span>equipment</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, now what was good about some <span>sessions</span> was the <span>handouts</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I thought all the <span>handouts</span> were good actually, and some were great, with <span>website</span> <span>addresses</span> and everything.<br/>
🎧 One <span>problem</span> though with <span>materials</span> was the key <span>texts</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes!<br/>
🎧 There just weren't enough <span>copies</span> on <span>reserve</span> in the <span>library</span>.<br/>
🎧 And if you can't get the key <span>texts</span> before the <span>session</span>,<br/>
🎧 how are you <span>supposed</span> to do the <span>reading</span>?<br/>
🎧 And not enough <span>computers</span>.<br/>
🎧 You have to wait <span>ages</span> to get one.<br/>
🎧 OK, <span>testing</span> and <span>evaluation</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, I don't know, it's <span>hard</span> to say until we've got our <span>written</span> <span>assignments</span> back.<br/>
🎧 Don't talk about it,<br/>
🎧 I only got <span>mine</span> in <span>yesterday</span>, it was a <span>real</span> <span>struggle</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>hate</span> to think what <span>mark</span> I'll get.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, but at <span>least</span> we've done the <span>oral</span> <span>presentation</span>.<br/>
🎧 I thought that was good, the way I got my <span>feedback</span> really quickly.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it was.<br/>
🎧 And I <span>liked</span> the way we <span>knew</span> what we'd be <span>evaluated</span> on,<br/>
🎧 we <span>knew</span> the <span>criteria</span>, so we <span>knew</span> we had to think about <span>clarity</span>, <span>organisation</span>, and so on.<br/>
🎧 But I'm not so sure about the <span>written</span> work.<br/>
🎧 One thing I think is that there's just too much, it's really <span>stressful</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, I'd <span>agree<br/></span>
🎧 and I don't see why they can't let us know the <span>criteria</span> they use for <span>marking</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>written</span> <span>assignments</span>?<br/>
🎧 But he told us.<br/>
🎧 No, for the <span>final</span> <span>exams</span>.<br/>
🎧 What are they looking for <span>-</span> what are the <span>criteria</span>?<br/>
🎧 What makes a <span>pass</span> or a <span>fail</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I never thought of that.<br/>
🎧 It'd be really <span>useful</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, any other <span>comments</span>?<br/>
🎧 I thought student <span>support</span> was <span>excellent</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, me too.<br/>
🎧 Okay, <span>excellent</span>.<br/>
🎧 Other <span>comments</span>?<br/>
🎧 No. I can't think of anything else.<br/>
🎧 <span>Nor</span> me.<br/>
🎧 Okay, so that's done.<br/>
🎧 Thanks, <span>Ben</span>.<br/>
🎧 No, thank you.<br/>

🎧 Well, my group has been doing a <span>project</span> on how <span>household</span> <span>waste</span> is <span>recycled</span> in <span>Britain</span>.<br/>
🎧 We were quite <span>shocked</span> to <span>discover</span> that only <span>9%</span> of people here in the <span>UK<br/></span>
🎧 make an <span>effort</span> to <span>recycle</span> their <span>household</span> <span>waste</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is a <span>lower</span> <span>figure</span> than in most other <span>European</span> <span>countries</span>,<br/>
🎧 and needs to <span>increase</span> <span>dramatically</span> in the next few <span>years<br/></span>
🎧 if the <span>government</span> is going to meet its <span>recycling</span> <span>targets</span>.<br/>
🎧 The agreed <span>targets</span> for the <span>UK</span> mean that by <span>2008</span> we must <span>reduce</span> our <span>carbon</span> <span>dioxide</span> <span>emissions</span> by <span>12.5%</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>compared</span> with <span>1990</span>.<br/>
🎧 And <span>recycling</span> can help to <span>achieve</span> that <span>goal</span>, in two <span>main</span> <span>ways:<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>production</span> of <span>recycled</span> <span>glass</span> and <span>paper</span> <span>uses</span> much less <span>energy</span> than <span>producing</span> them from <span>virgin</span> <span>materials</span>,<br/>
🎧 and also <span>recycling</span> <span>reduces</span> <span>greenhouse</span> gas <span>emissions</span> from <span>landfill</span> <span>sites</span> and <span>incineration</span> <span>plants</span>.<br/>
🎧 As <span>part</span> of our <span>project</span>,<br/>
🎧 we <span>carried</span> out a <span>survey</span> of people in the <span>street</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the thing that came up over and over <span>again<br/></span>
🎧 is that people don't think it's easy enough to <span>recycle</span> their <span>waste</span>.<br/>
🎧 One <span>problem</span> is that there aren't enough <span>'drop-</span> <span>off'</span> <span>sites</span>,<br/>
🎧 that is, the <span>places</span> where the <span>public</span> are <span>supposed</span> to take their <span>waste</span>.<br/>
🎧 We also <span>discovered</span> that <span>waste</span> that's <span>collected</span> from <span>householders<br/></span>
🎧 is taken to <span>places</span> called <span>'bring</span> <span>banks'</span>, for <span>sorting</span> and <span>baling</span> into <span>loads</span>.<br/>
🎧 One <span>problem</span> here is taking out everything that shouldn't have been <span>placed</span> in the <span>recycling</span> <span>containers:<br/></span>
🎧 people put all <span>sorts</span> of things into <span>bottle</span> <span>banks</span>, like <span>plastic</span> <span>bags</span> and even <span>broken</span> <span>umbrellas</span>.<br/>
🎧 All this has to be <span>removed</span> by <span>hand</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>difficulty</span> is that <span>toughened</span> <span>glass</span> used for cooking doesn't <span>fully</span> <span>melt</span> at the <span>temperature</span> <span>required</span> for other <span>glass</span>,<br/>
🎧 and so that also has to be <span>picked</span> out by <span>hand</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Glass</span> is easy to <span>recycle</span> because it can be <span>reused</span> over and over again without <span>becoming</span> <span>weaker</span>.<br/>
🎧 Two <span>million</span> <span>tons</span> of <span>glass</span> is <span>thrown</span> away each year,<br/>
🎧 that is, <span>seven</span> <span>billion</span> <span>bottles</span> and <span>jars;<br/></span>
🎧 but only <span>500,000</span> <span>tons</span> of that is <span>collected</span> and <span>recycled</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Oddly</span> enough, <span>half</span> the <span>glass</span> that's <span>collected</span> is <span>green</span>,<br/>
🎧 and a lot of that is <span>imported</span>,<br/>
🎧 so more <span>green</span> <span>glass</span> is <span>recycled</span> than the <span>UK</span> needs.<br/>
🎧 As a <span>result</span>, new <span>uses</span> are being <span>developed</span> for <span>recycled</span> <span>glass</span>, <span>particularly</span> <span>green</span> <span>glass</span>,<br/>
🎧 for example, in <span>fibreglass</span> <span>manufacture</span> and water <span>filtration</span>.<br/>
🎧 A company called <span>CLF</span> <span>Aggregates</span> makes a product for <span>roads</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>30%</span> of the <span>material</span> is <span>crushed</span> <span>glass</span>.<br/>
🎧 For <span>recycling</span> <span>paper</span>, <span>Britain</span> comes second in <span>Europe</span> with <span>40%</span>,<br/>
🎧 behind <span>Germany's</span> amazing <span>70%</span>.<br/>
🎧 When <span>recycling</span> <span>started</span>, there were <span>quality</span> <span>problems</span>,<br/>
🎧 so it was <span>difficult</span> to use <span>recycled</span> <span>paper</span> in <span>office</span> <span>printers</span>.<br/>
🎧 But these <span>problems</span> have now been <span>solved</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>Martin's</span>, <span>based</span> in <span>South</span> <span>London</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>produces</span> a <span>range</span> of <span>office</span> <span>stationery</span> which is <span>100%</span> <span>recycled</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>costs</span> the same as <span>normal</span> <span>paper</span> and is of <span>equally</span> high <span>quality</span>.<br/>
🎧 But this high <span>quality</span> comes at a <span>cost</span> in <span>terms</span> of the <span>waste</span> <span>produced</span> during the <span>process</span>.<br/>
🎧 Over a <span>third</span> of the <span>waste</span> <span>paper</span> that comes in can't be used in the <span>recycled</span> <span>paper</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>leaving</span> the <span>question</span> of what to do with it.<br/>
🎧 One <span>firm</span>, <span>Papersave</span>, <span>currently</span> <span>sells</span> this to <span>farmers</span> as a <span>soil</span> <span>conditioner</span>,<br/>
🎧 though this practice will soon be <span>banned</span> because of <span>transport</span> <span>costs</span> and the <span>smell</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the company is looking into the <span>possibility</span> of <span>alternative</span> <span>uses</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Plastic</span> <span>causes</span> <span>problems</span>, because there are so many different <span>types</span> of <span>plastic</span> in use today,<br/>
🎧 and each one has to be <span>dealt</span> with <span>differently</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Pacrite</span> <span>recycles</span> all <span>sorts</span> of things, from <span>bottles</span> to car <span>bumpers</span>,<br/>
🎧 and one of its most <span>successful</span> <span>activities</span> is <span>recycling</span> <span>plastic</span> <span>bottles</span> to make <span>containers<br/></span>
🎧 which are used all over the <span>country</span> to <span>collect</span> <span>waste</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Save-a-Cup</span> <span>scheme</span> was set up by the <span>vending</span> and <span>plastics</span> <span>industries<br/></span>
🎧 to <span>recycle</span> as many as <span>possible</span> of the <span>3.5</span> <span>billion</span> <span>polystyrene</span> <span>cups</span> used each year.<br/>
🎧 At the <span>moment</span>, <span>500</span> <span>million</span> <span>polycups</span> are <span>collected</span>, <span>processed</span> and <span>sold</span> on to other <span>businesses</span>, such as <span>Waterford</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>turns</span> the <span>cups</span> into <span>pencils</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>Johnson</span> <span>&</span> <span>Jones</span>, a <span>Welsh-based</span> <span>firm</span>,<br/>
🎧 which has <span>developed</span> a <span>wide</span> <span>variety</span> of <span>items</span>, <span>including</span> <span>business</span> <span>cards</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, to <span>sum</span> up,<br/>
🎧 there <span>seems</span> to be <span>plenty</span> of <span>research</span> going on into how to <span>re-use</span> <span>materials</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>biggest</span> <span>problem</span> is getting people to think about <span>recycling</span> <span>instead</span> of <span>throwing</span> things away.<br/>
🎧 At <span>least</span> doing the <span>research</span> made us much more <span>careful</span>.<br/>
