🎧 Hello, Junior Cycle camp, Jake speaking.<br/>
🎧 Hi.<br/>
🎧 I'm calling for some information about the cycle camp -<br/>
🎧 I'm thinking of sending my son.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 Well, it's held every weekday morning over the summer vacation<br/>
🎧 and we focus on basic cycling skills and safety.<br/>
🎧 We have eight levels for children from three years upwards.<br/>
🎧 How old's your son?<br/>
🎧 Charlie? He's seven.<br/>
🎧 He can ride a bike,<br/>
🎧 but he needs a little more training before he's safe to go on the road.<br/>
🎧 He'd probably be best in Level 5.<br/>
🎧 They start off practising on the site here,<br/>
🎧 and we aim to get them riding on the road,<br/>
🎧 but first they're taken to ride in the park, away from the traffic.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And can you tell me a bit about the instructors?<br/>
🎧 Well, all our staff wear different coloured shirts.<br/>
🎧 So, we have three supervisors, and they have red shirts.<br/>
🎧 They support the instructors,<br/>
🎧 and they also stand in for me if I'm not around.<br/>
🎧 Then the instructors themselves are in blue shirts,<br/>
🎧 and one of these is responsible for each class.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 In order to be accepted,<br/>
🎧 all our instructors have to submit a reference from someone who's seen them work with children -<br/>
🎧 like if they've worked as a babysitter, for example.<br/>
🎧 Then they have to complete our training course,<br/>
🎧 including how to do lesson plans,<br/>
🎧 and generally care for the well-being of the kids in their class.<br/>
🎧 They do a great job, I have to say.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And tell me a bit about the classes.<br/>
🎧 What size will Charlie's class be?<br/>
🎧 We have a limit of eight children in each class,<br/>
🎧 so their instructor really gets to know them well.<br/>
🎧 They're out riding most of the time<br/>
🎧 but they have quiet times too,<br/>
🎧 where their instructor might tell them a story that's got something to do with cycling,<br/>
🎧 or get them to play a game together.<br/>
🎧 It's a lot of fun.<br/>
🎧 It must be.<br/>
🎧 Now, what happens if there's rain?<br/>
🎧 Do the classes still run?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes.<br/>
🎧 We don't let that put us off -<br/>
🎧 we just put on our waterproofs and keep cycling.<br/>
🎧 And is there anything special Charlie should bring along with him?<br/>
🎧 Well, maybe some spare clothes,<br/>
🎧 especially if the weather's not so good.<br/>
🎧 And a snack for break time.<br/>
🎧 How about a drink?<br/>
🎧 No, we'll provide that.<br/>
🎧 And make sure he has shoes, not sandals.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 And just at present Charlie has to take medication every few hours,<br/>
🎧 so I'll make sure he has that.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely.<br/>
🎧 Just give us details of when he has to take it<br/>
🎧 and we'll make sure he does.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Now, there are a few things you should know about Day 1 of the camp.<br/>
🎧 The classes normally start at 9:30 every morning,<br/>
🎧 but on Day 1, you should aim to get Charlie here by 9:20.<br/>
🎧 The finishing time will be 12:30 as usual.<br/>
🎧 We need the additional time because there are a few extra things to do.<br/>
🎧 The most important is that we have a very careful check to make sure that every child's helmet fits properly.<br/>
🎧 If it doesn't fit, we'll try to adjust it,<br/>
🎧 or we'll find him another one -<br/>
🎧 but he must wear it all the time he's on the bike.<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 Then after that, all the instructors will be waiting to meet their classes,<br/>
🎧 and they'll meet up in the tent -<br/>
🎧 you can't miss it.<br/>
🎧 And each instructor will take their class away and get started.<br/>
🎧 OK. Well that all sounds good.<br/>
🎧 Now, can you tell me how much the camp costs a week?<br/>
🎧 $199.<br/>
🎧 We've managed to keep the price more or less the same as last year -<br/>
🎧 it was 190 then.<br/>
🎧 But the places are filling up quite quickly.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 OK, well I'd like to book for...<br/>

🎧 Hello everyone.<br/>
🎧 My name's Megan Baker<br/>
🎧 and I'm a recruitment consultant at AVT Recruitment specialists.<br/>
🎧 Now, our company specialises in positions that involve working in the agriculture and horticulture sectors,<br/>
🎧 so that's fresh food production, garden and park maintenance and so on.<br/>
🎧 And these sectors do provide some very special career opportunities.<br/>
🎧 For a start, they often offer opportunities for those who don't want to be stuck with a 40-hour week,<br/>
🎧 but need to juggle work with other responsibilities such as child care -<br/>
🎧 and this is very important for many of our recruits.<br/>
🎧 Some people like working in a rural setting,<br/>
🎧 surrounded by plants and trees instead of buildings,<br/>
🎧 although we can't guarantee that.<br/>
🎧 But there are certainly health benefits,<br/>
🎧 especially in jobs where you're not sitting all day looking at a screen -<br/>
🎧 a big plus for many people.<br/>
🎧 Salaries can sometimes be good too,<br/>
🎧 although there's a lot of variety here.<br/>
🎧 And you may have the opportunity in some types of jobs for travel overseas,<br/>
🎧 although that obviously depends on the job,<br/>
🎧 and not everyone is keen to do it.<br/>
🎧 Of course, working outdoors does have its challenges.<br/>
🎧 It's fine in summer, but can be extremely unpleasant when it's cold and windy.<br/>
🎧 You may need to be pretty fit for some jobs,<br/>
🎧 though with modern technology that's not as important as it once was.<br/>
🎧 And standards of health and safety are much higher now than they used to be,<br/>
🎧 so there are fewer work-related accidents.<br/>
🎧 But if you like a lively city environment surrounded by lots of people,<br/>
🎧 these jobs are probably not for you -<br/>
🎧 they're often in pretty remote areas.<br/>
🎧 And some people worry about finding a suitable place to live,<br/>
🎧 but in our experience, this usually turns out fine.<br/>
🎧 Now let me tell you about some of the exciting jobs that we have on our books right now.<br/>
🎧 One is for a fresh food commercial manager.<br/>
🎧 Our client here is a very large fresh food producer supplying a range of top supermarkets.<br/>
🎧 They operate in a very fast-paced environment with low profit margins -<br/>
🎧 the staff there work hard,<br/>
🎧 but they play hard as well,<br/>
🎧 so if you've a sociable personality this may be for you.<br/>
🎧 We have an exciting post as an agronomist advising farmers on issues such as crop nutrition,<br/>
🎧 protection against pests,<br/>
🎧 and the latest legislation on farming and agricultural practices.<br/>
🎧 There are good opportunities for the right person to quickly make their way up the career ladder,<br/>
🎧 but a deep knowledge of the agricultural sector is expected of applicants.<br/>
🎧 A leading supermarket is looking for a fresh produce buyer<br/>
🎧 who is available for a 12-month maternity cover contract.<br/>
🎧 You need to have experience in administration,<br/>
🎧 planning and buying in the fresh produce industry,<br/>
🎧 and in return will receive a very competitive salary.<br/>
🎧 We've also received a request for a sales manager for a chain of garden centres.<br/>
🎧 You will be visiting centres in the region<br/>
🎧 to ensure their high levels of customer service are maintained.<br/>
🎧 This post is only suitable for someone who is prepared to live in the region.<br/>
🎧 There is also a vacancy for a tree technician to carry out tree cutting,<br/>
🎧 forestry and conservation work.<br/>
🎧 Candidates must have a clean driving licence<br/>
🎧 and have training in safety procedures.<br/>
🎧 A year's experience would be preferred<br/>
🎧 but the company might be prepared to consider someone who has just completed an appropriate training course.<br/>
🎧 Finally, we have a position for a farm worker.<br/>
🎧 This will involve a wide range of farm duties<br/>
🎧 including crop sowing and harvesting,<br/>
🎧 machine maintenance and animal care.<br/>
🎧 Perks of the job include the possibility of renting a small cottage on the estate,<br/>
🎧 and the chance to earn a competitive salary.<br/>
🎧 A driving licence and tractor driving experience are essential.<br/>

🎧 OK Rosie, shall we try to get some ideas together for our presentation on diet and obesity?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 I can talk about the experiment I did to see if people can tell the difference between real sugar and artificial sweeteners.<br/>
🎧 Where you gave people drinks with either sugar or artificial sweeteners<br/>
🎧 and they had to say which they thought it was?<br/>
🎧 Yeah. It took me ages to decide exactly how I'd organise it,<br/>
🎧 especially how I could make sure that people didn't know which drink I was giving them.<br/>
🎧 It was hard to keep track of it all,<br/>
🎧 especially as I had so many people doing it -<br/>
🎧 I had to make sure I kept a proper record of what each person had had.<br/>
🎧 So could most people tell the difference?<br/>
🎧 Yeah - I hadn't thought that they would be able to, but most people could.<br/>
🎧 Then there's that experiment I did measuring the fat content of nuts,<br/>
🎧 to see if the nutritional information given on the packet was accurate.<br/>
🎧 The one where you ground up the nuts and mixed them with a chemical to absorb the fat?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 My results were a bit problematic -<br/>
🎧 the fat content for that type of nut seemed much lower than it said on the package.<br/>
🎧 But I reckon the package information was right.<br/>
🎧 I think I should probably have ground up the nuts more than I did.<br/>
🎧 It's possible that the scales for weighing the fat weren't accurate enough, too.<br/>
🎧 I'd really like to try the experiment again some time.<br/>
🎧 So what can we say about helping people to lose weight?<br/>
🎧 There's a lot we could say about what restaurants could do to reduce obesity.<br/>
🎧 I read that the items at the start of a menu and the items at the end of a menu<br/>
🎧 are much more likely to be chosen than the items in the middle.<br/>
🎧 So, if you put the low-calorie items at the beginning and end of the menu,<br/>
🎧 people will probably go for the food with fewer calories, without even realising what they're doing.<br/>
🎧 I think food manufacturers could do more to encourage healthy eating.<br/>
🎧 How?<br/>
🎧 Well, when manufacturers put calorie counts of a food on the label,<br/>
🎧 they're sometimes really confusing and I suspect they do it on purpose.<br/>
🎧 Because food that's high in calories tastes better, and so they'll sell more.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, so if you look at the amount of calories in a pizza,<br/>
🎧 they'll give you the calories per quarter pizza and you think, oh that's not too bad.<br/>
🎧 But who's going to eat a quarter pizza?<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 I suppose another approach to this problem is to get people to exercise more.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 In England, the current guidelines are for at least 30 minutes of brisk walking, five days a week.<br/>
🎧 Now when you ask them, about 40% of men<br/>
🎧 and 30% of women say they do this,<br/>
🎧 but when you objectively measure the amount of walking they do with motion sensors,<br/>
🎧 you find that only 6% of men and 4% of women do the recommended amount of exercise.<br/>
🎧 So you can see why obesity is growing.<br/>
🎧 So how can people be encouraged to take more exercise?<br/>
🎧 Well, for example, think of the location of stairs in a train station.<br/>
🎧 if people reach the stairs before they reach the escalator when they're leaving the station,<br/>
🎧 they're more likely to take the stairs.<br/>
🎧 And if you increase the width of the stairs,<br/>
🎧 you'll get more people using them at the same time.<br/>
🎧 It's an unconscious process and influenced by minor modifications in their environment.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And it might not be a big change,<br/>
🎧 but if it happens every day, it all adds up.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 But actually, I'm not sure if we should be talking about exercise in our presentation.<br/>
🎧 Well, we've done quite a bit of reading about it.<br/>
🎧 I know, but it's going to mean we have a very wide focus,<br/>
🎧 and our tutor did say that we need to focus on causes and solutions in terms of nutrition.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I suppose so.<br/>
🎧 And we've got plenty of information about that.<br/>
🎧 OK, well that will be simpler.<br/>
🎧 So what shall we do now?<br/>
🎧 We've still got half an hour before our next lecture.<br/>
🎧 Let's think about what we're going to include and what will go where.<br/>
🎧 Then we can decide what slides we need.<br/>
🎧 OK, fine.<br/>

🎧 Good morning everyone.<br/>
🎧 So today we're going to look at an important creative activity<br/>
🎧 and that's hand knitting.<br/>
🎧 Ancient knitted garments have been found in many different countries,<br/>
🎧 showing that knitting is a global activity with a long history.<br/>
🎧 When someone says the word 'knitting'<br/>
🎧 we might well picture an elderly person -<br/>
🎧 a grandmother perhaps -<br/>
🎧 sitting by the fire knitting garments for themselves or other members of the family.<br/>
🎧 It's a homely image,<br/>
🎧 but one that may lead you to feel that knitting is an activity of the past -<br/>
🎧 and, indeed, during the previous decade,<br/>
🎧 it was one of the skills that was predicted to vanish from everyday life.<br/>
🎧 For although humans have sewn and knitted their own clothing for a very long time,<br/>
🎧 many of these craft-based skills went into decline<br/>
🎧 when industrial machines took over -<br/>
🎧 mainly because they were no longer passed down from one generation to another.<br/>
🎧 However, that's all changing<br/>
🎧 and interest in knitting classes in many countries is actually rising,<br/>
🎧 as more and more people are seeking formal instruction in the skill.<br/>
🎧 With that trend, we're also seeing an increase in the sales figures for knitting equipment.<br/>
🎧 So why do people want to be taught to knit<br/>
🎧 at a time when a machine can readily do the job for them?<br/>
🎧 The answer is that knitting, as a handicraft,<br/>
🎧 has numerous benefits for those doing it.<br/>
🎧 Let's consider what some of these might be.<br/>
🎧 While many people knitted garments in the past<br/>
🎧 because they couldn't afford to buy clothes,<br/>
🎧 it's still true today that knitting can be helpful<br/>
🎧 if you're experiencing economic hardship.<br/>
🎧 If you have several children who all need warm winter clothes,<br/>
🎧 knitting may save you a lot of money.<br/>
🎧 And the results of knitting your own clothes can be very rewarding,<br/>
🎧 even though the skills you need to get going are really quite basic<br/>
🎧 and the financial outlay is minimal.<br/>
🎧 But the more significant benefits in today's world are to do with well-being.<br/>
🎧 In a world where it's estimated that we spend up to nine hours a day online,<br/>
🎧 doing something with our hands that is craft-based makes us feel good.<br/>
🎧 It releases us from the stress of a technological, fast-paced life.<br/>
🎧 Now, let's look back a bit to early knitting activities.<br/>
🎧 In fact, no one really knows when knitting first began,<br/>
🎧 but archaeological remains have disclosed plenty of information for us to think about.<br/>
🎧 One of the interesting things about knitting<br/>
🎧 is that the earliest pieces of clothing that have been found<br/>
🎧 suggest that most of the items produced were round rather than flat.<br/>
🎧 Discoveries from the 3rd and 4th centuries in Egypt<br/>
🎧 show that things like socks and gloves,<br/>
🎧 that were needed to keep hands and feet warm,<br/>
🎧 were knitted in one piece using four or five needles.<br/>
🎧 That's very different from most knitting patterns today,<br/>
🎧 which only require two.<br/>
🎧 What's more, the very first needles people used were hand carved out of wood<br/>
🎧 and other natural materials, like bone,<br/>
🎧 whereas today's needles are largely made of steel or plastic<br/>
🎧 and make that characteristic clicking sound when someone's using them.<br/>
🎧 Ancient people knitted using yarns made from linen,<br/>
🎧 hemp, cotton and wool,<br/>
🎧 and these were often very rough on the skin.<br/>
🎧 The spinning wheel, which allowed people to make finer yarns<br/>
🎧 and produce much greater quantities of them,<br/>
🎧 led to the dominance of wool in the knitting industry -<br/>
🎧 often favoured for its warmth.<br/>
🎧 Another interesting fact about knitting<br/>
🎧 is that because it was practised in so many parts of the world<br/>
🎧 for so many purposes,<br/>
🎧 regional differences in style developed.<br/>
🎧 This visual identity has allowed researchers to match bits of knitted clothing<br/>
🎧 that have been unearthed over time to the region from which the wearer came<br/>
🎧 or the job that he or she did.<br/>
🎧 As I've mentioned,<br/>
🎧 knitting offered people from poor communities a way of making extra money<br/>
🎧 while doing other tasks.<br/>
🎧 For many centuries, it seems,<br/>
🎧 men, women and children took every opportunity to knit,<br/>
🎧 for example, while watching over sheep,<br/>
🎧 walking to market or riding in boats.<br/>
🎧 So, let's move on...<br/>
<br/><br/>
