🎧 Hello, <span>Junior</span> <span>Cycle</span> <span>camp</span>, <span>Jake</span> <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hi.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>calling</span> for some <span>information</span> about the <span>cycle</span> <span>camp</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 I'm thinking of <span>sending</span> my son.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 Well, it's <span>held</span> every <span>weekday</span> morning over the <span>summer</span> <span>vacation<br/></span>
🎧 and we focus on <span>basic</span> <span>cycling</span> <span>skills</span> and <span>safety</span>.<br/>
🎧 We have <span>eight</span> <span>levels</span> for children from <span>three</span> years <span>upwards</span>.<br/>
🎧 How <span>old's</span> your son?<br/>
🎧 <span>Charlie</span>? He's <span>seven</span>.<br/>
🎧 He can <span>ride</span> a <span>bike</span>,<br/>
🎧 but he needs a little more <span>training</span> before he's <span>safe</span> to go on the <span>road</span>.<br/>
🎧 He'd probably be best in <span>Level</span> <span>5</span>.<br/>
🎧 They start off <span>practising</span> on the <span>site</span> here,<br/>
🎧 and we <span>aim</span> to get them <span>riding</span> on the <span>road</span>,<br/>
🎧 but first they're taken to <span>ride</span> in the <span>park</span>, away from the <span>traffic</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And can you tell me a bit about the <span>instructors</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, all our <span>staff</span> <span>wear</span> different <span>coloured</span> <span>shirts</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, we have <span>three</span> <span>supervisors</span>, and they have red <span>shirts</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>support</span> the <span>instructors</span>,<br/>
🎧 and they also <span>stand</span> in for me if I'm not around.<br/>
🎧 Then the <span>instructors</span> <span>themselves</span> are in <span>blue</span> <span>shirts</span>,<br/>
🎧 and one of these is <span>responsible</span> for each class.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 In order to be <span>accepted</span>,<br/>
🎧 all our <span>instructors</span> have to <span>submit</span> a <span>reference</span> from <span>someone</span> who's <span>seen</span> them work with children <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 like if <span>they've</span> <span>worked</span> as a <span>babysitter</span>, for example.<br/>
🎧 Then they have to <span>complete</span> our <span>training</span> course,<br/>
🎧 <span>including</span> how to do <span>lesson</span> <span>plans</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>generally</span> <span>care</span> for the <span>well-being</span> of the <span>kids</span> in their class.<br/>
🎧 They do a great <span>job</span>, I have to say.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And tell me a bit about the <span>classes</span>.<br/>
🎧 What size will <span>Charlie's</span> class be?<br/>
🎧 We have a <span>limit</span> of <span>eight</span> children in each class,<br/>
🎧 so their <span>instructor</span> really <span>gets</span> to know them well.<br/>
🎧 They're out <span>riding</span> most of the <span>time<br/></span>
🎧 but they have <span>quiet</span> <span>times</span> too,<br/>
🎧 where their <span>instructor</span> might tell them a <span>story</span> that's got something to do with <span>cycling</span>,<br/>
🎧 or get them to play a game together.<br/>
🎧 It's a lot of fun.<br/>
🎧 It must be.<br/>
🎧 Now, what <span>happens</span> if there's <span>rain</span>?<br/>
🎧 Do the <span>classes</span> still run?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes.<br/>
🎧 We don't let that put us off <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 we just put on our <span>waterproofs</span> and keep <span>cycling</span>.<br/>
🎧 And is there anything special <span>Charlie</span> should <span>bring</span> along with him?<br/>
🎧 Well, maybe some <span>spare</span> <span>clothes</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>especially</span> if the <span>weather's</span> not so good.<br/>
🎧 And a <span>snack</span> for <span>break</span> time.<br/>
🎧 How about a drink?<br/>
🎧 No, we'll <span>provide</span> that.<br/>
🎧 And make sure he has <span>shoes</span>, not <span>sandals</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 And just at <span>present</span> <span>Charlie</span> has to take <span>medication</span> every few hours,<br/>
🎧 so I'll make sure he has that.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely.<br/>
🎧 Just give us <span>details</span> of when he has to take <span>it<br/></span>
🎧 and we'll make sure he does.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Now, there are a few things you should know about Day <span>1</span> of the <span>camp</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>classes</span> <span>normally</span> start at <span>9:30</span> every morning,<br/>
🎧 but on Day <span>1</span>, you should <span>aim</span> to get <span>Charlie</span> here by <span>9:20</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>finishing</span> time will be <span>12:30</span> as <span>usual</span>.<br/>
🎧 We need the <span>additional</span> time because there are a few <span>extra</span> things to do.<br/>
🎧 The most important is that we have a very <span>careful</span> check to make sure that every <span>child's</span> <span>helmet</span> <span>fits</span> <span>properly</span>.<br/>
🎧 If it doesn't fit, we'll try to <span>adjust</span> it,<br/>
🎧 or we'll find him another one <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 but he must <span>wear</span> it all the time he's on the <span>bike</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 Then after that, all the <span>instructors</span> will be <span>waiting</span> to meet their <span>classes</span>,<br/>
🎧 and they'll meet up in the <span>tent</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 you can't <span>miss</span> it.<br/>
🎧 And each <span>instructor</span> will take their class away and get <span>started</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK. Well that all sounds good.<br/>
🎧 Now, can you tell me how much the <span>camp</span> <span>costs</span> a week?<br/>
🎧 <span>$199</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've <span>managed</span> to keep the <span>price</span> more or less the same as last year <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it was <span>190</span> then.<br/>
🎧 But the <span>places</span> are <span>filling</span> up quite quickly.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 OK, well I'd like to book <span>for..</span>.<br/>

🎧 Hello everyone.<br/>
🎧 My <span>name's</span> <span>Megan</span> <span>Baker<br/></span>
🎧 and I'm a <span>recruitment</span> <span>consultant</span> at <span>AVT</span> <span>Recruitment</span> <span>specialists</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, our company <span>specialises</span> in <span>positions</span> that <span>involve</span> working in the <span>agriculture</span> and <span>horticulture</span> <span>sectors</span>,<br/>
🎧 so that's <span>fresh</span> food <span>production</span>, garden and <span>park</span> <span>maintenance</span> and so on.<br/>
🎧 And these <span>sectors</span> do <span>provide</span> some very special <span>career</span> <span>opportunities</span>.<br/>
🎧 For a start, they often <span>offer</span> <span>opportunities</span> for those who don't want to be <span>stuck</span> with a <span>40-hour</span> week,<br/>
🎧 but need to <span>juggle</span> work with other <span>responsibilities</span> such as <span>child</span> <span>care</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and this is very important for many of our <span>recruits</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some people like working in a <span>rural</span> <span>setting</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>surrounded</span> by <span>plants</span> and <span>trees</span> <span>instead</span> of <span>buildings</span>,<br/>
🎧 although we can't <span>guarantee</span> that.<br/>
🎧 But there are <span>certainly</span> <span>health</span> <span>benefits</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>especially</span> in <span>jobs</span> where you're not <span>sitting</span> all day looking at a <span>screen</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 a big <span>plus</span> for many people.<br/>
🎧 <span>Salaries</span> can sometimes be good too,<br/>
🎧 although there's a lot of <span>variety</span> here.<br/>
🎧 And you may have the <span>opportunity</span> in some <span>types</span> of <span>jobs</span> for travel <span>overseas</span>,<br/>
🎧 although that <span>obviously</span> <span>depends</span> on the <span>job</span>,<br/>
🎧 and not everyone is <span>keen</span> to do it.<br/>
🎧 Of course, working <span>outdoors</span> does have its <span>challenges</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's fine in <span>summer</span>, but can be <span>extremely</span> <span>unpleasant</span> when it's <span>cold</span> and <span>windy</span>.<br/>
🎧 You may need to be <span>pretty</span> fit for some <span>jobs</span>,<br/>
🎧 though with <span>modern</span> <span>technology</span> that's not as important as it once was.<br/>
🎧 And <span>standards</span> of <span>health</span> and <span>safety</span> are much <span>higher</span> now than they used to be,<br/>
🎧 so there are <span>fewer</span> <span>work-related</span> <span>accidents</span>.<br/>
🎧 But if you like a <span>lively</span> <span>city</span> <span>environment</span> <span>surrounded</span> by lots of people,<br/>
🎧 these <span>jobs</span> are probably not for you <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 they're often in <span>pretty</span> <span>remote</span> <span>areas</span>.<br/>
🎧 And some people <span>worry</span> about <span>finding</span> a <span>suitable</span> place to live,<br/>
🎧 but in our <span>experience</span>, this usually <span>turns</span> out fine.<br/>
🎧 Now let me tell you about some of the <span>exciting</span> <span>jobs</span> that we have on our books right now.<br/>
🎧 One is for a <span>fresh</span> food <span>commercial</span> <span>manager</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>client</span> here is a very large <span>fresh</span> food <span>producer</span> <span>supplying</span> a <span>range</span> of top <span>supermarkets</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>operate</span> in a very <span>fast-paced</span> <span>environment</span> with low <span>profit</span> <span>margins</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>staff</span> there work <span>hard</span>,<br/>
🎧 but they play <span>hard</span> as well,<br/>
🎧 so if you've a <span>sociable</span> <span>personality</span> this may be for you.<br/>
🎧 We have an <span>exciting</span> <span>post</span> as an <span>agronomist</span> <span>advising</span> <span>farmers</span> on issues such as <span>crop</span> <span>nutrition</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>protection</span> <span>against</span> <span>pests</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>latest</span> <span>legislation</span> on <span>farming</span> and <span>agricultural</span> <span>practices</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are good <span>opportunities</span> for the right person to quickly make their way up the <span>career</span> <span>ladder</span>,<br/>
🎧 but a <span>deep</span> <span>knowledge</span> of the <span>agricultural</span> <span>sector</span> is <span>expected</span> of <span>applicants</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>leading</span> <span>supermarket</span> is looking for a <span>fresh</span> <span>produce</span> <span>buyer<br/></span>
🎧 who is <span>available</span> for a <span>12-month</span> <span>maternity</span> <span>cover</span> <span>contract</span>.<br/>
🎧 You need to have <span>experience</span> in <span>administration</span>,<br/>
🎧 planning and <span>buying</span> in the <span>fresh</span> <span>produce</span> <span>industry</span>,<br/>
🎧 and in <span>return</span> will <span>receive</span> a very <span>competitive</span> <span>salary</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've also <span>received</span> a <span>request</span> for a <span>sales</span> <span>manager</span> for a <span>chain</span> of garden <span>centres</span>.<br/>
🎧 You will be <span>visiting</span> <span>centres</span> in the <span>region<br/></span>
🎧 to <span>ensure</span> their high <span>levels</span> of <span>customer</span> <span>service</span> are <span>maintained</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>post</span> is only <span>suitable</span> for <span>someone</span> who is <span>prepared</span> to live in the <span>region</span>.<br/>
🎧 There is also a <span>vacancy</span> for a <span>tree</span> <span>technician</span> to <span>carry</span> out <span>tree</span> <span>cutting</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>forestry</span> and <span>conservation</span> work.<br/>
🎧 <span>Candidates</span> must have a <span>clean</span> driving <span>licence<br/></span>
🎧 and have <span>training</span> in <span>safety</span> <span>procedures</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>year's</span> <span>experience</span> would be <span>preferred<br/></span>
🎧 but the company might be <span>prepared</span> to <span>consider</span> <span>someone</span> who has just <span>completed</span> an <span>appropriate</span> <span>training</span> course.<br/>
🎧 Finally, we have a <span>position</span> for a <span>farm</span> <span>worker</span>.<br/>
🎧 This will <span>involve</span> a <span>wide</span> <span>range</span> of <span>farm</span> <span>duties<br/></span>
🎧 <span>including</span> <span>crop</span> <span>sowing</span> and <span>harvesting</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>machine</span> <span>maintenance</span> and <span>animal</span> <span>care</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Perks</span> of the <span>job</span> <span>include</span> the <span>possibility</span> of <span>renting</span> a small <span>cottage</span> on the <span>estate</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>chance</span> to <span>earn</span> a <span>competitive</span> <span>salary</span>.<br/>
🎧 A driving <span>licence</span> and <span>tractor</span> driving <span>experience</span> are <span>essential</span>.<br/>

🎧 OK <span>Rosie</span>, shall we try to get some <span>ideas</span> together for our <span>presentation</span> on <span>diet</span> and <span>obesity</span>?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 I can talk about the <span>experiment</span> I did to see if people can tell the <span>difference</span> between <span>real</span> <span>sugar</span> and <span>artificial</span> <span>sweeteners</span>.<br/>
🎧 Where you gave people <span>drinks</span> with either <span>sugar</span> or <span>artificial</span> <span>sweeteners<br/></span>
🎧 and they had to say which they thought it was?<br/>
🎧 Yeah. It took me <span>ages</span> to decide exactly how I'd <span>organise</span> it,<br/>
🎧 <span>especially</span> how I could make sure that people didn't know which drink I was <span>giving</span> them.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>hard</span> to keep <span>track</span> of it all,<br/>
🎧 <span>especially</span> as I had so many people doing it <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 I had to make sure I <span>kept</span> a <span>proper</span> <span>record</span> of what each person had had.<br/>
🎧 So could most people tell the <span>difference</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah <span>-</span> I hadn't thought that they would be able to, but most people could.<br/>
🎧 Then there's that <span>experiment</span> I did <span>measuring</span> the fat <span>content</span> of <span>nuts</span>,<br/>
🎧 to see if the <span>nutritional</span> <span>information</span> <span>given</span> on the <span>packet</span> was <span>accurate</span>.<br/>
🎧 The one where you <span>ground</span> up the <span>nuts</span> and <span>mixed</span> them with a <span>chemical</span> to <span>absorb</span> the fat?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 My <span>results</span> were a bit <span>problematic</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 the fat <span>content</span> for that <span>type</span> of <span>nut</span> <span>seemed</span> much <span>lower</span> than it said on the <span>package</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I <span>reckon</span> the <span>package</span> <span>information</span> was right.<br/>
🎧 I think I should probably have <span>ground</span> up the <span>nuts</span> more than I did.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>possible</span> that the <span>scales</span> for <span>weighing</span> the fat weren't <span>accurate</span> enough, too.<br/>
🎧 I'd really like to try the <span>experiment</span> again some time.<br/>
🎧 So what can we say about <span>helping</span> people to <span>lose</span> <span>weight</span>?<br/>
🎧 There's a lot we could say about what <span>restaurants</span> could do to <span>reduce</span> <span>obesity</span>.<br/>
🎧 I read that the <span>items</span> at the start of a <span>menu</span> and the <span>items</span> at the end of a <span>menu<br/></span>
🎧 are much more <span>likely</span> to be <span>chosen</span> than the <span>items</span> in the <span>middle</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, if you put the <span>low-calorie</span> <span>items</span> at the <span>beginning</span> and end of the <span>menu</span>,<br/>
🎧 people will probably go for the food with <span>fewer</span> <span>calories</span>, without even <span>realising</span> what they're doing.<br/>
🎧 I think food <span>manufacturers</span> could do more to <span>encourage</span> <span>healthy</span> <span>eating</span>.<br/>
🎧 How?<br/>
🎧 Well, when <span>manufacturers</span> put <span>calorie</span> <span>counts</span> of a food on the <span>label</span>,<br/>
🎧 they're sometimes really <span>confusing</span> and I <span>suspect</span> they do it on <span>purpose</span>.<br/>
🎧 Because food that's high in <span>calories</span> <span>tastes</span> better, and so they'll sell more.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, so if you look at the amount of <span>calories</span> in a <span>pizza</span>,<br/>
🎧 they'll give you the <span>calories</span> <span>per</span> <span>quarter</span> <span>pizza</span> and you think, oh that's not too bad.<br/>
🎧 But who's going to eat a <span>quarter</span> <span>pizza</span>?<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> another <span>approach</span> to this <span>problem</span> is to get people to <span>exercise</span> more.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 In <span>England</span>, the <span>current</span> <span>guidelines</span> are for at <span>least</span> <span>30</span> <span>minutes</span> of <span>brisk</span> <span>walking</span>, <span>five</span> <span>days</span> a week.<br/>
🎧 Now when you ask them, about <span>40%</span> of <span>men<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>30%</span> of <span>women</span> say they do this,<br/>
🎧 but when you <span>objectively</span> <span>measure</span> the amount of <span>walking</span> they do with <span>motion</span> <span>sensors</span>,<br/>
🎧 you find that only <span>6%</span> of men and <span>4%</span> of <span>women</span> do the <span>recommended</span> amount of <span>exercise</span>.<br/>
🎧 So you can see why <span>obesity</span> is <span>growing</span>.<br/>
🎧 So how can people be <span>encouraged</span> to take more <span>exercise</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, for example, think of the <span>location</span> of <span>stairs</span> in a <span>train</span> <span>station</span>.<br/>
🎧 if people <span>reach</span> the <span>stairs</span> before they <span>reach</span> the <span>escalator</span> when they're <span>leaving</span> the <span>station</span>,<br/>
🎧 they're more <span>likely</span> to take the <span>stairs</span>.<br/>
🎧 And if you <span>increase</span> the <span>width</span> of the <span>stairs</span>,<br/>
🎧 you'll get more people <span>using</span> them at the same time.<br/>
🎧 It's an <span>unconscious</span> <span>process</span> and <span>influenced</span> by <span>minor</span> <span>modifications</span> in their <span>environment</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And it might not be a big change,<br/>
🎧 but if it <span>happens</span> every day, it all <span>adds</span> up.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 But actually, I'm not sure if we should be talking about <span>exercise</span> in our <span>presentation</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, we've done quite a bit of <span>reading</span> about it.<br/>
🎧 I know, but it's going to mean we have a very <span>wide</span> focus,<br/>
🎧 and our <span>tutor</span> did say that we need to focus on <span>causes</span> and <span>solutions</span> in <span>terms</span> of <span>nutrition</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I <span>suppose</span> so.<br/>
🎧 And we've got <span>plenty</span> of <span>information</span> about that.<br/>
🎧 OK, well that will be <span>simpler</span>.<br/>
🎧 So what shall we do now?<br/>
🎧 We've still got <span>half</span> an <span>hour</span> before our next <span>lecture</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's think about what we're going to <span>include</span> and what will go where.<br/>
🎧 Then we can decide what <span>slides</span> we need.<br/>
🎧 OK, fine.<br/>

🎧 Good morning everyone.<br/>
🎧 So today we're going to look at an important <span>creative</span> <span>activity<br/></span>
🎧 and that's <span>hand</span> <span>knitting</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ancient</span> <span>knitted</span> <span>garments</span> have been <span>found</span> in many different <span>countries</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>showing</span> that <span>knitting</span> is a <span>global</span> <span>activity</span> with a long <span>history</span>.<br/>
🎧 When <span>someone</span> says the <span>word</span> <span>'knitting'<br/></span>
🎧 we might well <span>picture</span> an <span>elderly</span> person <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 a <span>grandmother</span> <span>perhaps</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>sitting</span> by the <span>fire</span> <span>knitting</span> <span>garments</span> for <span>themselves</span> or other <span>members</span> of the <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>homely</span> <span>image</span>,<br/>
🎧 but one that may <span>lead</span> you to feel that <span>knitting</span> is an <span>activity</span> of the <span>past</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and, <span>indeed</span>, during the <span>previous</span> <span>decade</span>,<br/>
🎧 it was one of the <span>skills</span> that was <span>predicted</span> to <span>vanish</span> from everyday life.<br/>
🎧 For although <span>humans</span> have <span>sewn</span> and <span>knitted</span> their own <span>clothing</span> for a very long time,<br/>
🎧 many of these <span>craft-based</span> <span>skills</span> went into <span>decline<br/></span>
🎧 when <span>industrial</span> <span>machines</span> took over <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>mainly</span> because they were no <span>longer</span> <span>passed</span> down from one <span>generation</span> to another.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, that's all <span>changing<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>interest</span> in <span>knitting</span> <span>classes</span> in many <span>countries</span> is actually <span>rising</span>,<br/>
🎧 as more and more people are <span>seeking</span> <span>formal</span> <span>instruction</span> in the <span>skill</span>.<br/>
🎧 With that <span>trend</span>, we're also <span>seeing</span> an <span>increase</span> in the <span>sales</span> <span>figures</span> for <span>knitting</span> <span>equipment</span>.<br/>
🎧 So why do people want to be <span>taught</span> to <span>knit<br/></span>
🎧 at a time when a <span>machine</span> can <span>readily</span> do the <span>job</span> for them?<br/>
🎧 The answer is that <span>knitting</span>, as a <span>handicraft</span>,<br/>
🎧 has <span>numerous</span> <span>benefits</span> for those doing it.<br/>
🎧 Let's <span>consider</span> what some of these might be.<br/>
🎧 While many people <span>knitted</span> <span>garments</span> in the <span>past<br/></span>
🎧 because they couldn't <span>afford</span> to buy <span>clothes</span>,<br/>
🎧 it's still <span>true</span> today that <span>knitting</span> can be <span>helpful<br/></span>
🎧 if you're <span>experiencing</span> <span>economic</span> <span>hardship</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you have <span>several</span> children who all need <span>warm</span> <span>winter</span> <span>clothes</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>knitting</span> may <span>save</span> you a lot of money.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>results</span> of <span>knitting</span> your own <span>clothes</span> can be very <span>rewarding</span>,<br/>
🎧 even though the <span>skills</span> you need to get going are really quite <span>basic<br/></span>
🎧 and the <span>financial</span> <span>outlay</span> is <span>minimal</span>.<br/>
🎧 But the more <span>significant</span> <span>benefits</span> in <span>today's</span> <span>world</span> are to do with <span>well-being</span>.<br/>
🎧 In a <span>world</span> where it's <span>estimated</span> that we <span>spend</span> up to <span>nine</span> hours a day online,<br/>
🎧 doing something with our <span>hands</span> that is <span>craft-based</span> makes us feel good.<br/>
🎧 It <span>releases</span> us from the <span>stress</span> of a <span>technological</span>, <span>fast-paced</span> life.<br/>
🎧 Now, let's look back a bit to <span>early</span> <span>knitting</span> <span>activities</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, no one really <span>knows</span> when <span>knitting</span> first <span>began</span>,<br/>
🎧 but <span>archaeological</span> <span>remains</span> have <span>disclosed</span> <span>plenty</span> of <span>information</span> for us to think about.<br/>
🎧 One of the <span>interesting</span> things about <span>knitting<br/></span>
🎧 is that the <span>earliest</span> <span>pieces</span> of <span>clothing</span> that have been <span>found<br/></span>
🎧 <span>suggest</span> that most of the <span>items</span> <span>produced</span> were <span>round</span> rather than <span>flat</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Discoveries</span> from the <span>3rd</span> and <span>4th</span> <span>centuries</span> in <span>Egypt<br/></span>
🎧 show that things like <span>socks</span> and <span>gloves</span>,<br/>
🎧 that were <span>needed</span> to keep <span>hands</span> and <span>feet</span> <span>warm</span>,<br/>
🎧 were <span>knitted</span> in one <span>piece</span> <span>using</span> <span>four</span> or <span>five</span> <span>needles</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's very different from most <span>knitting</span> <span>patterns</span> today,<br/>
🎧 which only <span>require</span> two.<br/>
🎧 What's more, the very first <span>needles</span> people used were <span>hand</span> <span>carved</span> out of <span>wood<br/></span>
🎧 and other <span>natural</span> <span>materials</span>, like <span>bone</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>whereas</span> <span>today's</span> <span>needles</span> are <span>largely</span> made of <span>steel</span> or <span>plastic<br/></span>
🎧 and make that <span>characteristic</span> <span>clicking</span> sound when <span>someone's</span> <span>using</span> them.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ancient</span> people <span>knitted</span> <span>using</span> <span>yarns</span> made from <span>linen</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>hemp</span>, <span>cotton</span> and <span>wool</span>,<br/>
🎧 and these were often very <span>rough</span> on the <span>skin</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>spinning</span> <span>wheel</span>, which <span>allowed</span> people to make <span>finer</span> <span>yarns<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>produce</span> much <span>greater</span> <span>quantities</span> of them,<br/>
🎧 <span>led</span> to the <span>dominance</span> of <span>wool</span> in the <span>knitting</span> <span>industry</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 often <span>favoured</span> for its <span>warmth</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>interesting</span> <span>fact</span> about <span>knitting<br/></span>
🎧 is that because it was <span>practised</span> in so many <span>parts</span> of the <span>world<br/></span>
🎧 for so many <span>purposes</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>regional</span> <span>differences</span> in <span>style</span> <span>developed</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>visual</span> <span>identity</span> has <span>allowed</span> <span>researchers</span> to <span>match</span> <span>bits</span> of <span>knitted</span> <span>clothing<br/></span>
🎧 that have been <span>unearthed</span> over time to the <span>region</span> from which the <span>wearer</span> <span>came<br/></span>
🎧 or the <span>job</span> that he or she did.<br/>
🎧 As I've <span>mentioned</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>knitting</span> <span>offered</span> people from <span>poor</span> <span>communities</span> a way of <span>making</span> <span>extra</span> <span>money<br/></span>
🎧 while doing other <span>tasks</span>.<br/>
🎧 For many <span>centuries</span>, it <span>seems</span>,<br/>
🎧 men, <span>women</span> and children took every <span>opportunity</span> to <span>knit</span>,<br/>
🎧 for example, while watching over <span>sheep</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>walking</span> to <span>market</span> or <span>riding</span> in <span>boats</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, let's move <span>on..</span>.<br/>
