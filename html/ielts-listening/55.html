🎧 Hello, Junior</span> Cycle</span> camp</span>, Jake</span> speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hi.<br/>
🎧 I'm calling</span> for some information</span> about the cycle</span> camp</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 I'm thinking of sending</span> my son.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 Well, it's held</span> every weekday</span> morning over the summer</span> vacation<br/></span>
🎧 and we focus on basic</span> cycling</span> skills</span> and safety</span>.<br/>
🎧 We have eight</span> levels</span> for children from three</span> years upwards</span>.<br/>
🎧 How old's</span> your son?<br/>
🎧 Charlie</span>? He's seven</span>.<br/>
🎧 He can ride</span> a bike</span>,<br/>
🎧 but he needs a little more training</span> before he's safe</span> to go on the road</span>.<br/>
🎧 He'd probably be best in Level</span> 5</span>.<br/>
🎧 They start off practising</span> on the site</span> here,<br/>
🎧 and we aim</span> to get them riding</span> on the road</span>,<br/>
🎧 but first they're taken to ride</span> in the park</span>, away from the traffic</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And can you tell me a bit about the instructors</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, all our staff</span> wear</span> different coloured</span> shirts</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, we have three</span> supervisors</span>, and they have red shirts</span>.<br/>
🎧 They support</span> the instructors</span>,<br/>
🎧 and they also stand</span> in for me if I'm not around.<br/>
🎧 Then the instructors</span> themselves</span> are in blue</span> shirts</span>,<br/>
🎧 and one of these is responsible</span> for each class.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 In order to be accepted</span>,<br/>
🎧 all our instructors</span> have to submit</span> a reference</span> from someone</span> who's seen</span> them work with children -<br/></span>
🎧 like if they've</span> worked</span> as a babysitter</span>, for example.<br/>
🎧 Then they have to complete</span> our training</span> course,<br/>
🎧 including</span> how to do lesson</span> plans</span>,<br/>
🎧 and generally</span> care</span> for the well-being</span> of the kids</span> in their class.<br/>
🎧 They do a great job</span>, I have to say.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And tell me a bit about the classes</span>.<br/>
🎧 What size will Charlie's</span> class be?<br/>
🎧 We have a limit</span> of eight</span> children in each class,<br/>
🎧 so their instructor</span> really gets</span> to know them well.<br/>
🎧 They're out riding</span> most of the time<br/></span>
🎧 but they have quiet</span> times</span> too,<br/>
🎧 where their instructor</span> might tell them a story</span> that's got something to do with cycling</span>,<br/>
🎧 or get them to play a game together.<br/>
🎧 It's a lot of fun.<br/>
🎧 It must be.<br/>
🎧 Now, what happens</span> if there's rain</span>?<br/>
🎧 Do the classes</span> still run?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes.<br/>
🎧 We don't let that put us off -<br/></span>
🎧 we just put on our waterproofs</span> and keep cycling</span>.<br/>
🎧 And is there anything special Charlie</span> should bring</span> along with him?<br/>
🎧 Well, maybe some spare</span> clothes</span>,<br/>
🎧 especially</span> if the weather's</span> not so good.<br/>
🎧 And a snack</span> for break</span> time.<br/>
🎧 How about a drink?<br/>
🎧 No, we'll provide</span> that.<br/>
🎧 And make sure he has shoes</span>, not sandals</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 And just at present</span> Charlie</span> has to take medication</span> every few hours,<br/>
🎧 so I'll make sure he has that.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely.<br/>
🎧 Just give us details</span> of when he has to take it<br/></span>
🎧 and we'll make sure he does.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Now, there are a few things you should know about Day 1</span> of the camp</span>.<br/>
🎧 The classes</span> normally</span> start at 9:30</span> every morning,<br/>
🎧 but on Day 1</span>, you should aim</span> to get Charlie</span> here by 9:20</span>.<br/>
🎧 The finishing</span> time will be 12:30</span> as usual</span>.<br/>
🎧 We need the additional</span> time because there are a few extra</span> things to do.<br/>
🎧 The most important is that we have a very careful</span> check to make sure that every child's</span> helmet</span> fits</span> properly</span>.<br/>
🎧 If it doesn't fit, we'll try to adjust</span> it,<br/>
🎧 or we'll find him another one -<br/></span>
🎧 but he must wear</span> it all the time he's on the bike</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 Then after that, all the instructors</span> will be waiting</span> to meet their classes</span>,<br/>
🎧 and they'll meet up in the tent</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 you can't miss</span> it.<br/>
🎧 And each instructor</span> will take their class away and get started</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK. Well that all sounds good.<br/>
🎧 Now, can you tell me how much the camp</span> costs</span> a week?<br/>
🎧 $199</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've managed</span> to keep the price</span> more or less the same as last year -<br/></span>
🎧 it was 190</span> then.<br/>
🎧 But the places</span> are filling</span> up quite quickly.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 OK, well I'd like to book for..</span>.<br/>

🎧 Hello everyone.<br/>
🎧 My name's</span> Megan</span> Baker<br/></span>
🎧 and I'm a recruitment</span> consultant</span> at AVT</span> Recruitment</span> specialists</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, our company specialises</span> in positions</span> that involve</span> working in the agriculture</span> and horticulture</span> sectors</span>,<br/>
🎧 so that's fresh</span> food production</span>, garden and park</span> maintenance</span> and so on.<br/>
🎧 And these sectors</span> do provide</span> some very special career</span> opportunities</span>.<br/>
🎧 For a start, they often offer</span> opportunities</span> for those who don't want to be stuck</span> with a 40-hour</span> week,<br/>
🎧 but need to juggle</span> work with other responsibilities</span> such as child</span> care</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 and this is very important for many of our recruits</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some people like working in a rural</span> setting</span>,<br/>
🎧 surrounded</span> by plants</span> and trees</span> instead</span> of buildings</span>,<br/>
🎧 although we can't guarantee</span> that.<br/>
🎧 But there are certainly</span> health</span> benefits</span>,<br/>
🎧 especially</span> in jobs</span> where you're not sitting</span> all day looking at a screen</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 a big plus</span> for many people.<br/>
🎧 Salaries</span> can sometimes be good too,<br/>
🎧 although there's a lot of variety</span> here.<br/>
🎧 And you may have the opportunity</span> in some types</span> of jobs</span> for travel overseas</span>,<br/>
🎧 although that obviously</span> depends</span> on the job</span>,<br/>
🎧 and not everyone is keen</span> to do it.<br/>
🎧 Of course, working outdoors</span> does have its challenges</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's fine in summer</span>, but can be extremely</span> unpleasant</span> when it's cold</span> and windy</span>.<br/>
🎧 You may need to be pretty</span> fit for some jobs</span>,<br/>
🎧 though with modern</span> technology</span> that's not as important as it once was.<br/>
🎧 And standards</span> of health</span> and safety</span> are much higher</span> now than they used to be,<br/>
🎧 so there are fewer</span> work-related</span> accidents</span>.<br/>
🎧 But if you like a lively</span> city</span> environment</span> surrounded</span> by lots of people,<br/>
🎧 these jobs</span> are probably not for you -<br/></span>
🎧 they're often in pretty</span> remote</span> areas</span>.<br/>
🎧 And some people worry</span> about finding</span> a suitable</span> place to live,<br/>
🎧 but in our experience</span>, this usually turns</span> out fine.<br/>
🎧 Now let me tell you about some of the exciting</span> jobs</span> that we have on our books right now.<br/>
🎧 One is for a fresh</span> food commercial</span> manager</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our client</span> here is a very large fresh</span> food producer</span> supplying</span> a range</span> of top supermarkets</span>.<br/>
🎧 They operate</span> in a very fast-paced</span> environment</span> with low profit</span> margins</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 the staff</span> there work hard</span>,<br/>
🎧 but they play hard</span> as well,<br/>
🎧 so if you've a sociable</span> personality</span> this may be for you.<br/>
🎧 We have an exciting</span> post</span> as an agronomist</span> advising</span> farmers</span> on issues such as crop</span> nutrition</span>,<br/>
🎧 protection</span> against</span> pests</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the latest</span> legislation</span> on farming</span> and agricultural</span> practices</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are good opportunities</span> for the right person to quickly make their way up the career</span> ladder</span>,<br/>
🎧 but a deep</span> knowledge</span> of the agricultural</span> sector</span> is expected</span> of applicants</span>.<br/>
🎧 A leading</span> supermarket</span> is looking for a fresh</span> produce</span> buyer<br/></span>
🎧 who is available</span> for a 12-month</span> maternity</span> cover</span> contract</span>.<br/>
🎧 You need to have experience</span> in administration</span>,<br/>
🎧 planning and buying</span> in the fresh</span> produce</span> industry</span>,<br/>
🎧 and in return</span> will receive</span> a very competitive</span> salary</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've also received</span> a request</span> for a sales</span> manager</span> for a chain</span> of garden centres</span>.<br/>
🎧 You will be visiting</span> centres</span> in the region<br/></span>
🎧 to ensure</span> their high levels</span> of customer</span> service</span> are maintained</span>.<br/>
🎧 This post</span> is only suitable</span> for someone</span> who is prepared</span> to live in the region</span>.<br/>
🎧 There is also a vacancy</span> for a tree</span> technician</span> to carry</span> out tree</span> cutting</span>,<br/>
🎧 forestry</span> and conservation</span> work.<br/>
🎧 Candidates</span> must have a clean</span> driving licence<br/></span>
🎧 and have training</span> in safety</span> procedures</span>.<br/>
🎧 A year's</span> experience</span> would be preferred<br/></span>
🎧 but the company might be prepared</span> to consider</span> someone</span> who has just completed</span> an appropriate</span> training</span> course.<br/>
🎧 Finally, we have a position</span> for a farm</span> worker</span>.<br/>
🎧 This will involve</span> a wide</span> range</span> of farm</span> duties<br/></span>
🎧 including</span> crop</span> sowing</span> and harvesting</span>,<br/>
🎧 machine</span> maintenance</span> and animal</span> care</span>.<br/>
🎧 Perks</span> of the job</span> include</span> the possibility</span> of renting</span> a small cottage</span> on the estate</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the chance</span> to earn</span> a competitive</span> salary</span>.<br/>
🎧 A driving licence</span> and tractor</span> driving experience</span> are essential</span>.<br/>

🎧 OK Rosie</span>, shall we try to get some ideas</span> together for our presentation</span> on diet</span> and obesity</span>?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 I can talk about the experiment</span> I did to see if people can tell the difference</span> between real</span> sugar</span> and artificial</span> sweeteners</span>.<br/>
🎧 Where you gave people drinks</span> with either sugar</span> or artificial</span> sweeteners<br/></span>
🎧 and they had to say which they thought it was?<br/>
🎧 Yeah. It took me ages</span> to decide exactly how I'd organise</span> it,<br/>
🎧 especially</span> how I could make sure that people didn't know which drink I was giving</span> them.<br/>
🎧 It was hard</span> to keep track</span> of it all,<br/>
🎧 especially</span> as I had so many people doing it -<br/></span>
🎧 I had to make sure I kept</span> a proper</span> record</span> of what each person had had.<br/>
🎧 So could most people tell the difference</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah -</span> I hadn't thought that they would be able to, but most people could.<br/>
🎧 Then there's that experiment</span> I did measuring</span> the fat content</span> of nuts</span>,<br/>
🎧 to see if the nutritional</span> information</span> given</span> on the packet</span> was accurate</span>.<br/>
🎧 The one where you ground</span> up the nuts</span> and mixed</span> them with a chemical</span> to absorb</span> the fat?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 My results</span> were a bit problematic</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 the fat content</span> for that type</span> of nut</span> seemed</span> much lower</span> than it said on the package</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I reckon</span> the package</span> information</span> was right.<br/>
🎧 I think I should probably have ground</span> up the nuts</span> more than I did.<br/>
🎧 It's possible</span> that the scales</span> for weighing</span> the fat weren't accurate</span> enough, too.<br/>
🎧 I'd really like to try the experiment</span> again some time.<br/>
🎧 So what can we say about helping</span> people to lose</span> weight</span>?<br/>
🎧 There's a lot we could say about what restaurants</span> could do to reduce</span> obesity</span>.<br/>
🎧 I read that the items</span> at the start of a menu</span> and the items</span> at the end of a menu<br/></span>
🎧 are much more likely</span> to be chosen</span> than the items</span> in the middle</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, if you put the low-calorie</span> items</span> at the beginning</span> and end of the menu</span>,<br/>
🎧 people will probably go for the food with fewer</span> calories</span>, without even realising</span> what they're doing.<br/>
🎧 I think food manufacturers</span> could do more to encourage</span> healthy</span> eating</span>.<br/>
🎧 How?<br/>
🎧 Well, when manufacturers</span> put calorie</span> counts</span> of a food on the label</span>,<br/>
🎧 they're sometimes really confusing</span> and I suspect</span> they do it on purpose</span>.<br/>
🎧 Because food that's high in calories</span> tastes</span> better, and so they'll sell more.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, so if you look at the amount of calories</span> in a pizza</span>,<br/>
🎧 they'll give you the calories</span> per</span> quarter</span> pizza</span> and you think, oh that's not too bad.<br/>
🎧 But who's going to eat a quarter</span> pizza</span>?<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 I suppose</span> another approach</span> to this problem</span> is to get people to exercise</span> more.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 In England</span>, the current</span> guidelines</span> are for at least</span> 30</span> minutes</span> of brisk</span> walking</span>, five</span> days</span> a week.<br/>
🎧 Now when you ask them, about 40%</span> of men<br/></span>
🎧 and 30%</span> of women</span> say they do this,<br/>
🎧 but when you objectively</span> measure</span> the amount of walking</span> they do with motion</span> sensors</span>,<br/>
🎧 you find that only 6%</span> of men and 4%</span> of women</span> do the recommended</span> amount of exercise</span>.<br/>
🎧 So you can see why obesity</span> is growing</span>.<br/>
🎧 So how can people be encouraged</span> to take more exercise</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, for example, think of the location</span> of stairs</span> in a train</span> station</span>.<br/>
🎧 if people reach</span> the stairs</span> before they reach</span> the escalator</span> when they're leaving</span> the station</span>,<br/>
🎧 they're more likely</span> to take the stairs</span>.<br/>
🎧 And if you increase</span> the width</span> of the stairs</span>,<br/>
🎧 you'll get more people using</span> them at the same time.<br/>
🎧 It's an unconscious</span> process</span> and influenced</span> by minor</span> modifications</span> in their environment</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And it might not be a big change,<br/>
🎧 but if it happens</span> every day, it all adds</span> up.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 But actually, I'm not sure if we should be talking about exercise</span> in our presentation</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, we've done quite a bit of reading</span> about it.<br/>
🎧 I know, but it's going to mean we have a very wide</span> focus,<br/>
🎧 and our tutor</span> did say that we need to focus on causes</span> and solutions</span> in terms</span> of nutrition</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I suppose</span> so.<br/>
🎧 And we've got plenty</span> of information</span> about that.<br/>
🎧 OK, well that will be simpler</span>.<br/>
🎧 So what shall we do now?<br/>
🎧 We've still got half</span> an hour</span> before our next lecture</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's think about what we're going to include</span> and what will go where.<br/>
🎧 Then we can decide what slides</span> we need.<br/>
🎧 OK, fine.<br/>

🎧 Good morning everyone.<br/>
🎧 So today we're going to look at an important creative</span> activity<br/></span>
🎧 and that's hand</span> knitting</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ancient</span> knitted</span> garments</span> have been found</span> in many different countries</span>,<br/>
🎧 showing</span> that knitting</span> is a global</span> activity</span> with a long history</span>.<br/>
🎧 When someone</span> says the word</span> 'knitting'<br/></span>
🎧 we might well picture</span> an elderly</span> person -<br/></span>
🎧 a grandmother</span> perhaps</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 sitting</span> by the fire</span> knitting</span> garments</span> for themselves</span> or other members</span> of the family</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a homely</span> image</span>,<br/>
🎧 but one that may lead</span> you to feel that knitting</span> is an activity</span> of the past</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 and, indeed</span>, during the previous</span> decade</span>,<br/>
🎧 it was one of the skills</span> that was predicted</span> to vanish</span> from everyday life.<br/>
🎧 For although humans</span> have sewn</span> and knitted</span> their own clothing</span> for a very long time,<br/>
🎧 many of these craft-based</span> skills</span> went into decline<br/></span>
🎧 when industrial</span> machines</span> took over -<br/></span>
🎧 mainly</span> because they were no longer</span> passed</span> down from one generation</span> to another.<br/>
🎧 However</span>, that's all changing<br/></span>
🎧 and interest</span> in knitting</span> classes</span> in many countries</span> is actually rising</span>,<br/>
🎧 as more and more people are seeking</span> formal</span> instruction</span> in the skill</span>.<br/>
🎧 With that trend</span>, we're also seeing</span> an increase</span> in the sales</span> figures</span> for knitting</span> equipment</span>.<br/>
🎧 So why do people want to be taught</span> to knit<br/></span>
🎧 at a time when a machine</span> can readily</span> do the job</span> for them?<br/>
🎧 The answer is that knitting</span>, as a handicraft</span>,<br/>
🎧 has numerous</span> benefits</span> for those doing it.<br/>
🎧 Let's consider</span> what some of these might be.<br/>
🎧 While many people knitted</span> garments</span> in the past<br/></span>
🎧 because they couldn't afford</span> to buy clothes</span>,<br/>
🎧 it's still true</span> today that knitting</span> can be helpful<br/></span>
🎧 if you're experiencing</span> economic</span> hardship</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you have several</span> children who all need warm</span> winter</span> clothes</span>,<br/>
🎧 knitting</span> may save</span> you a lot of money.<br/>
🎧 And the results</span> of knitting</span> your own clothes</span> can be very rewarding</span>,<br/>
🎧 even though the skills</span> you need to get going are really quite basic<br/></span>
🎧 and the financial</span> outlay</span> is minimal</span>.<br/>
🎧 But the more significant</span> benefits</span> in today's</span> world</span> are to do with well-being</span>.<br/>
🎧 In a world</span> where it's estimated</span> that we spend</span> up to nine</span> hours a day online,<br/>
🎧 doing something with our hands</span> that is craft-based</span> makes us feel good.<br/>
🎧 It releases</span> us from the stress</span> of a technological</span>, fast-paced</span> life.<br/>
🎧 Now, let's look back a bit to early</span> knitting</span> activities</span>.<br/>
🎧 In fact</span>, no one really knows</span> when knitting</span> first began</span>,<br/>
🎧 but archaeological</span> remains</span> have disclosed</span> plenty</span> of information</span> for us to think about.<br/>
🎧 One of the interesting</span> things about knitting<br/></span>
🎧 is that the earliest</span> pieces</span> of clothing</span> that have been found<br/></span>
🎧 suggest</span> that most of the items</span> produced</span> were round</span> rather than flat</span>.<br/>
🎧 Discoveries</span> from the 3rd</span> and 4th</span> centuries</span> in Egypt<br/></span>
🎧 show that things like socks</span> and gloves</span>,<br/>
🎧 that were needed</span> to keep hands</span> and feet</span> warm</span>,<br/>
🎧 were knitted</span> in one piece</span> using</span> four</span> or five</span> needles</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's very different from most knitting</span> patterns</span> today,<br/>
🎧 which only require</span> two.<br/>
🎧 What's more, the very first needles</span> people used were hand</span> carved</span> out of wood<br/></span>
🎧 and other natural</span> materials</span>, like bone</span>,<br/>
🎧 whereas</span> today's</span> needles</span> are largely</span> made of steel</span> or plastic<br/></span>
🎧 and make that characteristic</span> clicking</span> sound when someone's</span> using</span> them.<br/>
🎧 Ancient</span> people knitted</span> using</span> yarns</span> made from linen</span>,<br/>
🎧 hemp</span>, cotton</span> and wool</span>,<br/>
🎧 and these were often very rough</span> on the skin</span>.<br/>
🎧 The spinning</span> wheel</span>, which allowed</span> people to make finer</span> yarns<br/></span>
🎧 and produce</span> much greater</span> quantities</span> of them,<br/>
🎧 led</span> to the dominance</span> of wool</span> in the knitting</span> industry</span> -<br/></span>
