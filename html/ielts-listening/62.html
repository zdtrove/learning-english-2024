🎧 So, I understand</span> you're interested in restaurant</span> work?<br/>
🎧 Yes. I've got a bit of experience</span> and I can provide</span> references</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's good. I can check all that later.<br/>
🎧 Now, Milo's</span> Restaurants</span> have some vacancies</span> at the moment</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're a really good company to work for.<br/>
🎧 Lots of benefits</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh right.<br/>
🎧 Yes. They've</span> got a very good reputation</span> for looking after staff</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, all employees</span> get training</span>, even temporary</span> staff</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh really? That's quite unusual</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Certainly</span> is.<br/>
🎧 And do staff</span> get free uniforms</span> too?<br/>
🎧 Um..</span>. you just need to wear</span> a white</span> T-shirt</span> and black</span> trousers</span>, it says here.<br/>
🎧 So I guess</span> not..</span>.<br/>
🎧 But another benefit</span> of working for a big company like this<br/></span>
🎧 is that you can get a discount</span> at any of their restaurants</span>.<br/>
🎧 Even at weekends</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, but you'll be working then anyway</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes. I suppose</span> so.<br/>
🎧 Um..</span>. most of their restaurants</span> are in the city</span> centre</span>, aren't they?<br/>
🎧 So, easy to get to by bus?<br/>
🎧 Yes. That's right.<br/>
🎧 But if you have to do a late</span> shift</span> and finish</span> work after midnight</span>,<br/>
🎧 the company will pay for you to get a taxi</span> home.<br/>
🎧 I probably won't need one. I think I'd use my bike</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Now, they do have some quite specific</span> requirements</span> for the kind of person they're looking for.<br/>
🎧 Milo's</span> is a young, dynamic</span> company<br/></span>
🎧 and they're really keen</span> on creating</span> a strong</span> team</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's really important that you can fit in and get on well with everyone.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. I've got no problem</span> with that.<br/>
🎧 It sounds good, actually.<br/>
🎧 The last place I worked</span> for was quite demanding</span> too.<br/>
🎧 We had to make sure we gave a really high level</span> of service</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's good to hear because that will be equally</span> important at Milo's</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know they want people who have an eye for detail</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's fine. I'm very used to working in that kind of environment</span>.<br/>
🎧 Perfect.<br/>
🎧 So the only other thing that's required</span> is good communication</span> skills</span>,<br/>
🎧 so you'll need to have a certificate</span> in English.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 OK. Let's have a look at the current</span> job</span> vacancies</span> at Milo's</span>.<br/>
🎧 The first one is in Wivenhoe</span> Street</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sorry, where?<br/>
🎧 Wivenhoe</span>.<br/>
🎧 W-I-V-E-N-H-O-E</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's quite central</span>, just off Cork</span> Street</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh right.<br/>
🎧 They're looking for a breakfast</span> supervisor</span>.<br/>
🎧 That would be OK.<br/>
🎧 So you're probably familiar</span> with the kind of responsibilities</span> involved</span>.<br/>
🎧 Obviously</span> checking</span> that all the portions</span> are correct</span>, etc.</span>,<br/>
🎧 and then things like checking</span> all the procedures</span> for cleaning</span> the equipment</span> are being followed</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And what about the salary</span>?<br/>
🎧 In my last job</span> I was getting £9.50</span> per</span> hour</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was hoping</span> to get a bit more than that.<br/>
🎧 Well, to begin</span> with, you'd be getting £9.75<br/></span>
🎧 but that goes</span> up to £11.25</span> after three</span> months</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's not too bad.<br/>
🎧 And I suppose</span> it's a very early</span> start?<br/>
🎧 That's the only unattractive</span> thing about this job</span>.<br/>
🎧 But then you have the afternoons</span> and evenings</span> free.<br/>
🎧 So the restaurant</span> starts</span> serving</span> breakfast</span> from 7</span> a.m</span>.<br/>
🎧 And you'd have to be there at 5.30</span> to set everything up.<br/>
🎧 But you'd be finished</span> at 12.30</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, as you say, there are advantages</span> to that.<br/>
🎧 Now, you might also be interested in the job</span> at the City</span> Road</span> branch</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's for a junior</span> chef</span>, so again a position</span> of responsibility</span>.<br/>
🎧 I might prefer</span> that, actually.<br/>
🎧 Right, well obviously</span> this role</span> would involve</span> supporting</span> the sous</span> chef</span> and other senior</span> staff</span>.<br/>
🎧 And you'd be responsible</span> for making</span> sure there's enough stock</span> each week<br/></span>
🎧 and sorting</span> out all the deliveries</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've never done that before,<br/>
🎧 but I imagine</span> it's fairly</span> straightforward</span>, once you get the hang</span> of it.<br/>
🎧 Yes, and you'd be working alongside</span> more experienced</span> staff</span> to begin</span> with,<br/>
🎧 so I'm sure it wouldn't be a problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 The salary's</span> slightly</span> higher</span> here.<br/>
🎧 It's an annual</span> salary</span> of £23,000</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I know that if they like you, it's likely</span> you'll be promoted</span> quite quickly.<br/>
🎧 So that's worth</span> thinking about.<br/>
🎧 Yes. It does sound interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 What are the hours like?<br/>
🎧 The usual</span>, I think.<br/>
🎧 There's a lot of evening</span> and weekend work, but they're closed</span> on Mondays</span>.<br/>
🎧 But you do get one Sunday</span> off every four</span> weeks</span>.<br/>
🎧 So would you like me to send</span> off your..</span>.<br/>

🎧 Hello everyone.<br/>
🎧 It's good to see that so many members</span> of the public</span> have shown</span> up for our presentation<br/></span>
🎧 on the new housing</span> development</span> planned</span> on the outskirts</span> of Nunston</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm Mark</span> Reynolds</span> and I'm Communications</span> Manager</span> at the development</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll start by giving</span> you a brief</span> overview</span> of our plans</span> for the development</span>.<br/>
🎧 So one thing I'm sure you'll want to know is why we've selected</span> this particular</span> site</span> for a housing</span> development</span>.<br/>
🎧 At present</span> it's being used for farming</span>,<br/>
🎧 like much of the land</span> around Nunston</span>.<br/>
🎧 But because of the new industrial</span> centre</span> in Nunston</span>,<br/>
🎧 there's a lot of demand</span> for housing</span> for employees</span> in the region</span>,<br/>
🎧 as many employees</span> are having to commute</span> long distances</span> at present</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course, there's also the fact</span> that we have an international</span> airport</span> just 20</span> minutes'</span> drive away,<br/>
🎧 but although that's certainly</span> convenient</span>,<br/>
🎧 it wasn't one of our major</span> criteria</span> for choosing</span> the site</span>.<br/>
🎧 We were more interested in the fact</span> that there's an excellent</span> hospital</span> just 15</span> kilometres</span> away,<br/>
🎧 and a large secondary</span> school even closer</span> than that.<br/>
🎧 One drawback</span> to the site</span> is that it's on quite a steep</span> slope</span>,<br/>
🎧 but we've taken account</span> of that in our planning<br/></span>
🎧 so it shouldn't be a major</span> problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've had a lot of positive</span> feedback</span> about the plans</span>.<br/>
🎧 People like the wide</span> variety</span> of accommodation</span> types</span> and prices</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the fact</span> that it's only a short drive to get out into the countryside</span> from the development</span>.<br/>
🎧 We were particularly</span> pleased</span> that so many people liked</span> the designs</span> for the layout</span> of the development</span>,<br/>
🎧 with the majority</span> of people saying it generally</span> made a good impression<br/></span>
🎧 and blended</span> in well with the natural</span> features</span> of the landscape</span>,<br/>
🎧 with provision</span> made for protecting</span> trees</span> and wildlife</span> on the site</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some people have mentioned</span> that they'd like to see more facilities</span> for cyclists</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we'll look at that,<br/>
🎧 but the overall</span> feedback</span> has been that the design</span> and facilities</span> of the development<br/></span>
🎧 make it seem</span> a place where people of all ages</span> can live together happily</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK. So I'll put a map of the proposed</span> development</span> up on the screen</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll see it's bounded</span> on the south</span> side by the main</span> road</span>,<br/>
🎧 which then goes</span> on to Nunston</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another boundary</span> is formed</span> by London</span> Road</span>, on the western</span> side of the development</span>.<br/>
🎧 Inside the development</span>, there'll</span> be about 400</span> houses</span> and 3</span> apartment</span> blocks</span>.<br/>
🎧 There'll</span> also be a school for children up to 11</span> years old.<br/>
🎧 If you look at the South</span> Entrance</span> at the bottom</span> of the map,<br/>
🎧 there's a road</span> from there that goes</span> right up through the development</span>.<br/>
🎧 The school will be on that road</span>, at the corner</span> of the second turning</span> to the left</span>.<br/>
🎧 A large sports</span> centre</span> is planned</span> with facilities</span> for indoor</span> and outdoor</span> activities</span>.<br/>
🎧 This will be on the western</span> side of the development</span>,<br/>
🎧 just below</span> the road</span> that branches</span> off from London</span> Road</span>.<br/>
🎧 There'll</span> be a clinic</span> where residents</span> can go if they have any health</span> problems</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can you see the lake</span> towards</span> the top of the map?<br/>
🎧 The clinic</span> will be just below</span> this, to the right of a street</span> of houses</span>.<br/>
🎧 There'll</span> also be a community</span> centre</span> for people of all ages</span>.<br/>
🎧 On the northeast</span> side of the development</span>,<br/>
🎧 there'll</span> be a row of specially</span> designed</span> houses</span> specifically</span> for residents</span> over 65</span>.<br/>
🎧 And the community</span> centre</span> will be adjoining</span> this.<br/>
🎧 We haven't forgotten</span> about shopping</span>.<br/>
🎧 There'll</span> be a supermarket</span> between the two entrances</span> to the development</span>.<br/>
🎧 We're planning to leave the three</span> large trees</span> near London</span> Road</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it'll be just to the south</span> of these.<br/>
🎧 It's planned</span> to have a playground</span> for younger</span> children.<br/>
🎧 If you look at the road</span> that goes</span> up from the South</span> Entrance</span>,<br/>
🎧 you'll see it curves</span> round</span> to the left</span> at the top,<br/>
🎧 and the playground</span> will be in that curve</span>, with nice views</span> of the lake</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, so now..</span>.<br/>

🎧 So, Michelle</span>, shall we make a start on our presentation</span>?<br/>
🎧 We haven't got that much time left</span>.<br/>
🎧 No, Adam</span>.<br/>
🎧 But at least</span> we've done all the background</span> reading</span>.<br/>
🎧 I found</span> it really interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd never even heard of the Laki</span> eruption</span> before this.<br/>
🎧 Me neither</span>.<br/>
🎧 I suppose</span> 1783</span> is a long time ago.<br/>
🎧 But it was a huge</span> eruption<br/></span>
🎧 and it had such devastating</span> consequences</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 It was great there were so many primary</span> sources</span> to look at.<br/>
🎧 It really gives</span> you a sense</span> of how catastrophic</span> the volcano</span> was.<br/>
🎧 People were really trying to make sense</span> of the science</span> for the first time.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 But what I found</span> more significant</span> was how it impacted</span> directly</span> and indirectly</span> on political</span> events</span>,<br/>
🎧 as well as having massive</span> social</span> and economic</span> consequences</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 That should be the main</span> focus of our presentation</span>.<br/>
🎧 The observations</span> made by people at the time were interesting</span>, weren't they?<br/>
🎧 I mean, they all gave a pretty</span> consistent</span> account</span> of what happened</span>,<br/>
🎧 even if they didn't always use the same terminology</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 I was surprised</span> there were so many weather</span> stations</span> established</span> by that time,<br/>
🎧 so, you know, you can see how the weather</span> changed</span>, often by the hour</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Writers</span> at the time talked</span> about the Laki</span> haze</span> to describe</span> the volcanic</span> fog that spread</span> across Europe</span>.<br/>
🎧 They all realised</span> that this wasn't the sort</span> of fog they were used to,<br/>
🎧 and of course this was in pre-industrial</span> times</span>,<br/>
🎧 so they hadn't experienced</span> sulphur-smelling</span> fog before.<br/>
🎧 No, that's true</span>.<br/>
🎧 Reports</span> from the period</span> blamed</span> the haze</span> for an increase</span> in headaches</span>,<br/>
🎧 respiratory</span> issues and asthma</span> attacks</span>.<br/>
🎧 And they all describe</span> how it covered</span> the sun and made it look a strange</span> red colour</span>.<br/>
🎧 Must have been very weird</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's interesting</span> that Benjamin</span> Franklin</span> wrote</span> about the haze</span>.<br/>
🎧 Did you read that?<br/>
🎧 He was the American</span> ambassador</span> in Paris</span> at the time.<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 At first no one realised</span> that the haze</span> was caused</span> by the volcanic</span> eruption</span> in Iceland</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was Benjamin</span> Franklin</span> who realised</span> that before anyone</span> else.<br/>
🎧 He's often credited</span> with that, apparently</span>.<br/>
🎧 But a French</span> naturalist</span> beat</span> him to it. I can't remember his name.<br/>
🎧 I'd have to look it up.<br/>
🎧 Then other naturalists</span> had the same idea,<br/>
🎧 all independently</span> of each other.<br/>
🎧 Oh right.<br/>
🎧 We should talk about the immediate</span> impact</span> of the eruption</span>, which was obviously</span> enormous</span>,<br/>
🎧 especially</span> in Iceland</span>, where so many people died</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'd expect</span> that.<br/>
🎧 And the fact</span> that the volcanic</span> ash</span> drifted</span> so swiftly<br/></span>
🎧 but not that the effects</span> would go on for so long.<br/>
🎧 Or that two years after the eruption</span>,<br/>
🎧 strange</span> weather</span> events</span> were being reported</span> as far</span> away as North</span> America</span> and North</span> Africa</span>.<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 I found</span> all that hard</span> to believe</span> too.<br/>
🎧 It must have been terrible<br/></span>
🎧 and there was nothing</span> anyone</span> could do about it,<br/>
🎧 even if they knew</span> the ash</span> cloud</span> was coming</span> in their direction</span>.<br/>
🎧 We should run through some of the terrible</span> consequences</span> of the eruption</span> experienced</span> in different countries</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's quite a varied</span> range</span>.<br/>
🎧 Starting</span> with Iceland</span>, where the impact</span> on farming</span> was devastating</span>.<br/>
🎧 One of the most dramatic</span> things there was the effect</span> on livestock</span> as they grazed</span> in the fields</span>.<br/>
🎧 They were poisoned</span> because they ate</span> vegetation</span> that had been contaminated</span> with fluorine<br/></span>
🎧 as a result</span> of the volcanic</span> fallout</span>.<br/>
🎧 That was horrible</span>.<br/>
🎧 In Egypt</span>, the bizarre</span> weather</span> patterns</span> led</span> to a severe</span> drought<br/></span>
🎧 and as a result</span> the Nile</span> didn't flood</span>,<br/>
🎧 which meant</span> the crops</span> all failed</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's so far</span> from where the eruption</span> happened<br/></span>
🎧 and yet the famine</span> there led</span> to more people dying</span> than any other country</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was worse</span> than the plague</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Then in the UK</span> the mortality</span> rate</span> went up a lot, presumably</span> from respiratory</span> illnesses</span>.<br/>
🎧 According</span> to one report</span> it was about double</span> the usual</span> number<br/></span>
🎧 and included</span> an unusually</span> high percentage</span> of people under the age of 25</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think people will be surprised</span> to hear that the weather</span> in the USA</span> was badly</span> affected</span> too.<br/>
🎧 George</span> Washington</span> even makes a note</span> in his diary</span> that they were snowbound</span> until March</span> in Virginia</span>.<br/>
🎧 That was before he became</span> president</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, and there was ice floating</span> down the Mississippi</span>, which was unprecedented</span>.<br/>
🎧 Astonishing</span>, really.<br/>
🎧 Anyway</span>, what do you think..</span>.<br/>

🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 Now, we've been asked</span> to choose an aspect</span> of European</span> clothing</span> or fashion<br/></span>
🎧 and to talk about its development</span> over time.<br/>
🎧 I decided</span> to focus on a rather small area</span> of clothing</span> and that's pockets</span>.<br/>
🎧 I chose</span> pockets</span> for two reasons</span>, really.<br/>
🎧 We all have them -</span> in jeans</span>, jackets</span>, coats</span>, for example -<br/></span>
🎧 and even though we often carry</span> bags</span> or briefcases</span> as well,<br/>
🎧 nothing</span> is quite as convenient</span> as being able to pop your phone or credit</span> card</span> into your pocket</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yet, I suspect</span> that, other than that, people don't really think about pockets</span> too much<br/></span>
🎧 and they're rather overlooked</span> as a fashion</span> item</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's certainly</span> very interesting</span> to go back in time<br/></span>
🎧 and see how pockets</span> developed</span> for men and women</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the 18th</span> century</span>,<br/>
🎧 fashions</span> were quite different from the way they are now,<br/>
🎧 and pockets</span> were too.<br/>
🎧 If we think about male</span> fashion</span> first..</span>.<br/>
🎧 that was the time when suits</span> became</span> popular</span>.<br/>
🎧 Trousers</span> were knee-length</span> only and referred</span> to as 'breeches'</span>,<br/>
🎧 the waistcoats</span> were short and the jackets</span> were long,<br/>
🎧 but all three</span> garments</span> were lined</span> with material<br/></span>
🎧 and pockets</span> were sewn</span> into this cloth</span> by whichever</span> tailor</span> the customer</span> used.<br/>
🎧 The wearer</span> could then carry</span> small objects</span> such as pencils</span> or coins</span> on their person<br/></span>
🎧 and reach</span> them through a gap</span> in the lining</span>.<br/>
🎧 Coat</span> pockets</span> became</span> increasingly</span> decorative</span> on the outside for men who wanted to look stylish</span>,<br/>
🎧 but they were often larger</span> but plainer<br/></span>
🎧 if the wearer</span> was someone</span> with a profession</span> who needed</span> to carry</span> medical</span> instruments</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 a doctor</span> or physician</span>, for example.<br/>
🎧 The development</span> of women's</span> pockets</span> was a little different.<br/>
🎧 For one thing, they weren't nearly</span> as visible</span> or as easy to reach</span> as men's</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the 18th</span> and 19th</span> centuries</span>,<br/>
🎧 women</span> carried</span> numerous</span> possessions</span> on their person<br/></span>
🎧 and some of these could be worth</span> a lot of money.<br/>
🎧 Women</span> were more vulnerable</span> to theft</span> and wealthy</span> women</span>, in particular</span>, worried</span> constantly</span> about pickpockets</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, what they did was to have a pair</span> of pockets</span> made that were tied</span> together with string</span>.<br/>
🎧 The pockets</span> were made of fabric</span>,<br/>
🎧 which might be recycled</span> cloth</span> if the wearer</span> had little money<br/></span>
🎧 or something more expensive</span>, such as linen</span>,<br/>
🎧 sometimes featuring</span> very delicate</span> embroidery</span>.<br/>
🎧 Women</span> tied</span> the pockets</span> around their waist</span> so that they hung</span> beneath</span> their clothes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Remember, skirts</span> were long then<br/></span>
🎧 and there was plenty</span> of room to hide</span> a whole range</span> of small possessions</span> between the layers</span> of petticoats</span> that were commonly</span> worn</span>.<br/>
🎧 They would have an opening</span> in the folds</span> of their skirts</span>,<br/>
🎧 through which they could reach</span> whatever they needed</span>, like their perfume</span>.<br/>
🎧 Working women</span>, of course, also needed</span> to carry</span> around items</span> that they might use for whatever job</span> or trade</span> they were involved</span> in,<br/>
🎧 but their pairs</span> of pockets</span> still remained</span> on the inside of their clothing</span>,<br/>
🎧 they just got bigger</span> or longer</span>,<br/>
🎧 sometimes reaching</span> down to their knees</span>!<br/>
🎧 So, the tie on pockets</span> went well into the 19th</span> century<br/></span>
🎧 and only changed</span> when fashion</span> altered</span> towards</span> the end of that period</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's when dresses</span> became</span> tighter</span> and less bulky</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the pairs</span> of pockets</span> became</span> very noticeable</span>.<br/>
🎧 They stood</span> out too much and detracted</span> from the woman's</span> image</span>.<br/>
🎧 Women</span> who had been used to carrying</span> around a range</span> of personal possessions</span> -</span> and still wanted to -<br/></span>
🎧 needed</span> somewhere to carry</span> these items</span> about their person.<br/>
🎧 That was when small bags</span>, or pouches</span> as they were known</span>, came into fashion<br/></span>
🎧 and, of course, they inevitably</span> led</span> on to the handbag</span> of more modern</span> times</span>,<br/>
🎧 particularly</span> when fashion</span> removed</span> pockets</span> altogether</span>.<br/>
