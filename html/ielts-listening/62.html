🎧 So, I <span>understand</span> you're interested in <span>restaurant</span> work?<br/>
🎧 Yes. I've got a bit of <span>experience</span> and I can <span>provide</span> <span>references</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's good. I can check all that later.<br/>
🎧 Now, <span>Milo's</span> <span>Restaurants</span> have some <span>vacancies</span> at the <span>moment</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're a really good company to work for.<br/>
🎧 Lots of <span>benefits</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh right.<br/>
🎧 Yes. <span>They've</span> got a very good <span>reputation</span> for looking after <span>staff</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, all <span>employees</span> get <span>training</span>, even <span>temporary</span> <span>staff</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh really? That's quite <span>unusual</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 <span>Certainly</span> is.<br/>
🎧 And do <span>staff</span> get free <span>uniforms</span> too?<br/>
🎧 <span>Um..</span>. you just need to <span>wear</span> a <span>white</span> <span>T-shirt</span> and <span>black</span> <span>trousers</span>, it says here.<br/>
🎧 So I <span>guess</span> <span>not..</span>.<br/>
🎧 But another <span>benefit</span> of working for a big company like <span>this<br/></span>
🎧 is that you can get a <span>discount</span> at any of their <span>restaurants</span>.<br/>
🎧 Even at <span>weekends</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, but you'll be working then <span>anyway</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes. I <span>suppose</span> so.<br/>
🎧 <span>Um..</span>. most of their <span>restaurants</span> are in the <span>city</span> <span>centre</span>, aren't they?<br/>
🎧 So, easy to get to by bus?<br/>
🎧 Yes. That's right.<br/>
🎧 But if you have to do a <span>late</span> <span>shift</span> and <span>finish</span> work after <span>midnight</span>,<br/>
🎧 the company will pay for you to get a <span>taxi</span> home.<br/>
🎧 I probably won't need one. I think I'd use my <span>bike</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Now, they do have some quite <span>specific</span> <span>requirements</span> for the kind of person they're looking for.<br/>
🎧 <span>Milo's</span> is a young, <span>dynamic</span> <span>company<br/></span>
🎧 and they're really <span>keen</span> on <span>creating</span> a <span>strong</span> <span>team</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's really important that you can fit in and get on well with everyone.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. I've got no <span>problem</span> with that.<br/>
🎧 It sounds good, actually.<br/>
🎧 The last place I <span>worked</span> for was quite <span>demanding</span> too.<br/>
🎧 We had to make sure we gave a really high <span>level</span> of <span>service</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's good to hear because that will be <span>equally</span> important at <span>Milo's</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know they want people who have an eye for <span>detail</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's fine. I'm very used to working in that kind of <span>environment</span>.<br/>
🎧 Perfect.<br/>
🎧 So the only other thing that's <span>required</span> is good <span>communication</span> <span>skills</span>,<br/>
🎧 so you'll need to have a <span>certificate</span> in English.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 OK. Let's have a look at the <span>current</span> <span>job</span> <span>vacancies</span> at <span>Milo's</span>.<br/>
🎧 The first one is in <span>Wivenhoe</span> <span>Street</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sorry, where?<br/>
🎧 <span>Wivenhoe</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>W-I-V-E-N-H-O-E</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's quite <span>central</span>, just off <span>Cork</span> <span>Street</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh right.<br/>
🎧 They're looking for a <span>breakfast</span> <span>supervisor</span>.<br/>
🎧 That would be OK.<br/>
🎧 So you're probably <span>familiar</span> with the kind of <span>responsibilities</span> <span>involved</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Obviously</span> <span>checking</span> that all the <span>portions</span> are <span>correct</span>, <span>etc.</span>,<br/>
🎧 and then things like <span>checking</span> all the <span>procedures</span> for <span>cleaning</span> the <span>equipment</span> are being <span>followed</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And what about the <span>salary</span>?<br/>
🎧 In my last <span>job</span> I was getting <span>£9.50</span> <span>per</span> <span>hour</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>hoping</span> to get a bit more than that.<br/>
🎧 Well, to <span>begin</span> with, you'd be getting <span>£9.75<br/></span>
🎧 but that <span>goes</span> up to <span>£11.25</span> after <span>three</span> <span>months</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's not too bad.<br/>
🎧 And I <span>suppose</span> it's a very <span>early</span> start?<br/>
🎧 That's the only <span>unattractive</span> thing about this <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 But then you have the <span>afternoons</span> and <span>evenings</span> free.<br/>
🎧 So the <span>restaurant</span> <span>starts</span> <span>serving</span> <span>breakfast</span> from <span>7</span> <span>a.m</span>.<br/>
🎧 And you'd have to be there at <span>5.30</span> to set everything up.<br/>
🎧 But you'd be <span>finished</span> at <span>12.30</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, as you say, there are <span>advantages</span> to that.<br/>
🎧 Now, you might also be interested in the <span>job</span> at the <span>City</span> <span>Road</span> <span>branch</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's for a <span>junior</span> <span>chef</span>, so again a <span>position</span> of <span>responsibility</span>.<br/>
🎧 I might <span>prefer</span> that, actually.<br/>
🎧 Right, well <span>obviously</span> this <span>role</span> would <span>involve</span> <span>supporting</span> the <span>sous</span> <span>chef</span> and other <span>senior</span> <span>staff</span>.<br/>
🎧 And you'd be <span>responsible</span> for <span>making</span> sure there's enough <span>stock</span> each <span>week<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>sorting</span> out all the <span>deliveries</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've never done that before,<br/>
🎧 but I <span>imagine</span> it's <span>fairly</span> <span>straightforward</span>, once you get the <span>hang</span> of it.<br/>
🎧 Yes, and you'd be working <span>alongside</span> more <span>experienced</span> <span>staff</span> to <span>begin</span> with,<br/>
🎧 so I'm sure it wouldn't be a <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>salary's</span> <span>slightly</span> <span>higher</span> here.<br/>
🎧 It's an <span>annual</span> <span>salary</span> of <span>£23,000</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I know that if they like you, it's <span>likely</span> you'll be <span>promoted</span> quite quickly.<br/>
🎧 So that's <span>worth</span> thinking about.<br/>
🎧 Yes. It does sound <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 What are the hours like?<br/>
🎧 The <span>usual</span>, I think.<br/>
🎧 There's a lot of <span>evening</span> and weekend work, but they're <span>closed</span> on <span>Mondays</span>.<br/>
🎧 But you do get one <span>Sunday</span> off every <span>four</span> <span>weeks</span>.<br/>
🎧 So would you like me to <span>send</span> off <span>your..</span>.<br/>

🎧 Hello everyone.<br/>
🎧 It's good to see that so many <span>members</span> of the <span>public</span> have <span>shown</span> up for our <span>presentation<br/></span>
🎧 on the new <span>housing</span> <span>development</span> <span>planned</span> on the <span>outskirts</span> of <span>Nunston</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>Mark</span> <span>Reynolds</span> and I'm <span>Communications</span> <span>Manager</span> at the <span>development</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll start by <span>giving</span> you a <span>brief</span> <span>overview</span> of our <span>plans</span> for the <span>development</span>.<br/>
🎧 So one thing I'm sure you'll want to know is why we've <span>selected</span> this <span>particular</span> <span>site</span> for a <span>housing</span> <span>development</span>.<br/>
🎧 At <span>present</span> it's being used for <span>farming</span>,<br/>
🎧 like much of the <span>land</span> around <span>Nunston</span>.<br/>
🎧 But because of the new <span>industrial</span> <span>centre</span> in <span>Nunston</span>,<br/>
🎧 there's a lot of <span>demand</span> for <span>housing</span> for <span>employees</span> in the <span>region</span>,<br/>
🎧 as many <span>employees</span> are having to <span>commute</span> long <span>distances</span> at <span>present</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course, there's also the <span>fact</span> that we have an <span>international</span> <span>airport</span> just <span>20</span> <span>minutes'</span> drive away,<br/>
🎧 but although that's <span>certainly</span> <span>convenient</span>,<br/>
🎧 it wasn't one of our <span>major</span> <span>criteria</span> for <span>choosing</span> the <span>site</span>.<br/>
🎧 We were more interested in the <span>fact</span> that there's an <span>excellent</span> <span>hospital</span> just <span>15</span> <span>kilometres</span> away,<br/>
🎧 and a large <span>secondary</span> school even <span>closer</span> than that.<br/>
🎧 One <span>drawback</span> to the <span>site</span> is that it's on quite a <span>steep</span> <span>slope</span>,<br/>
🎧 but we've taken <span>account</span> of that in our <span>planning<br/></span>
🎧 so it shouldn't be a <span>major</span> <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've had a lot of <span>positive</span> <span>feedback</span> about the <span>plans</span>.<br/>
🎧 People like the <span>wide</span> <span>variety</span> of <span>accommodation</span> <span>types</span> and <span>prices</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>fact</span> that it's only a short drive to get out into the <span>countryside</span> from the <span>development</span>.<br/>
🎧 We were <span>particularly</span> <span>pleased</span> that so many people <span>liked</span> the <span>designs</span> for the <span>layout</span> of the <span>development</span>,<br/>
🎧 with the <span>majority</span> of people saying it <span>generally</span> made a good <span>impression<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>blended</span> in well with the <span>natural</span> <span>features</span> of the <span>landscape</span>,<br/>
🎧 with <span>provision</span> made for <span>protecting</span> <span>trees</span> and <span>wildlife</span> on the <span>site</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some people have <span>mentioned</span> that they'd like to see more <span>facilities</span> for <span>cyclists</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we'll look at that,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>overall</span> <span>feedback</span> has been that the <span>design</span> and <span>facilities</span> of the <span>development<br/></span>
🎧 make it <span>seem</span> a place where people of all <span>ages</span> can live together <span>happily</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK. So I'll put a map of the <span>proposed</span> <span>development</span> up on the <span>screen</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll see it's <span>bounded</span> on the <span>south</span> side by the <span>main</span> <span>road</span>,<br/>
🎧 which then <span>goes</span> on to <span>Nunston</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>boundary</span> is <span>formed</span> by <span>London</span> <span>Road</span>, on the <span>western</span> side of the <span>development</span>.<br/>
🎧 Inside the <span>development</span>, <span>there'll</span> be about <span>400</span> <span>houses</span> and <span>3</span> <span>apartment</span> <span>blocks</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>There'll</span> also be a school for children up to <span>11</span> years old.<br/>
🎧 If you look at the <span>South</span> <span>Entrance</span> at the <span>bottom</span> of the map,<br/>
🎧 there's a <span>road</span> from there that <span>goes</span> right up through the <span>development</span>.<br/>
🎧 The school will be on that <span>road</span>, at the <span>corner</span> of the second <span>turning</span> to the <span>left</span>.<br/>
🎧 A large <span>sports</span> <span>centre</span> is <span>planned</span> with <span>facilities</span> for <span>indoor</span> and <span>outdoor</span> <span>activities</span>.<br/>
🎧 This will be on the <span>western</span> side of the <span>development</span>,<br/>
🎧 just <span>below</span> the <span>road</span> that <span>branches</span> off from <span>London</span> <span>Road</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>There'll</span> be a <span>clinic</span> where <span>residents</span> can go if they have any <span>health</span> <span>problems</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can you see the <span>lake</span> <span>towards</span> the top of the map?<br/>
🎧 The <span>clinic</span> will be just <span>below</span> this, to the right of a <span>street</span> of <span>houses</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>There'll</span> also be a <span>community</span> <span>centre</span> for people of all <span>ages</span>.<br/>
🎧 On the <span>northeast</span> side of the <span>development</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>there'll</span> be a row of <span>specially</span> <span>designed</span> <span>houses</span> <span>specifically</span> for <span>residents</span> over <span>65</span>.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>community</span> <span>centre</span> will be <span>adjoining</span> this.<br/>
🎧 We haven't <span>forgotten</span> about <span>shopping</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>There'll</span> be a <span>supermarket</span> between the two <span>entrances</span> to the <span>development</span>.<br/>
🎧 We're planning to leave the <span>three</span> large <span>trees</span> near <span>London</span> <span>Road</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it'll be just to the <span>south</span> of these.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>planned</span> to have a <span>playground</span> for <span>younger</span> children.<br/>
🎧 If you look at the <span>road</span> that <span>goes</span> up from the <span>South</span> <span>Entrance</span>,<br/>
🎧 you'll see it <span>curves</span> <span>round</span> to the <span>left</span> at the top,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>playground</span> will be in that <span>curve</span>, with nice <span>views</span> of the <span>lake</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, so <span>now..</span>.<br/>

🎧 So, <span>Michelle</span>, shall we make a start on our <span>presentation</span>?<br/>
🎧 We haven't got that much time <span>left</span>.<br/>
🎧 No, <span>Adam</span>.<br/>
🎧 But at <span>least</span> we've done all the <span>background</span> <span>reading</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>found</span> it really <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd never even heard of the <span>Laki</span> <span>eruption</span> before this.<br/>
🎧 Me <span>neither</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> <span>1783</span> is a long time ago.<br/>
🎧 But it was a <span>huge</span> <span>eruption<br/></span>
🎧 and it had such <span>devastating</span> <span>consequences</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 It was great there were so many <span>primary</span> <span>sources</span> to look at.<br/>
🎧 It really <span>gives</span> you a <span>sense</span> of how <span>catastrophic</span> the <span>volcano</span> was.<br/>
🎧 People were really trying to make <span>sense</span> of the <span>science</span> for the first time.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 But what I <span>found</span> more <span>significant</span> was how it <span>impacted</span> <span>directly</span> and <span>indirectly</span> on <span>political</span> <span>events</span>,<br/>
🎧 as well as having <span>massive</span> <span>social</span> and <span>economic</span> <span>consequences</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 That should be the <span>main</span> focus of our <span>presentation</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>observations</span> made by people at the time were <span>interesting</span>, weren't they?<br/>
🎧 I mean, they all gave a <span>pretty</span> <span>consistent</span> <span>account</span> of what <span>happened</span>,<br/>
🎧 even if they didn't always use the same <span>terminology</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>surprised</span> there were so many <span>weather</span> <span>stations</span> <span>established</span> by that time,<br/>
🎧 so, you know, you can see how the <span>weather</span> <span>changed</span>, often by the <span>hour</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 <span>Writers</span> at the time <span>talked</span> about the <span>Laki</span> <span>haze</span> to <span>describe</span> the <span>volcanic</span> fog that <span>spread</span> across <span>Europe</span>.<br/>
🎧 They all <span>realised</span> that this wasn't the <span>sort</span> of fog they were used to,<br/>
🎧 and of course this was in <span>pre-industrial</span> <span>times</span>,<br/>
🎧 so they hadn't <span>experienced</span> <span>sulphur-smelling</span> fog before.<br/>
🎧 No, that's <span>true</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Reports</span> from the <span>period</span> <span>blamed</span> the <span>haze</span> for an <span>increase</span> in <span>headaches</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>respiratory</span> issues and <span>asthma</span> <span>attacks</span>.<br/>
🎧 And they all <span>describe</span> how it <span>covered</span> the sun and made it look a <span>strange</span> red <span>colour</span>.<br/>
🎧 Must have been very <span>weird</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>interesting</span> that <span>Benjamin</span> <span>Franklin</span> <span>wrote</span> about the <span>haze</span>.<br/>
🎧 Did you read that?<br/>
🎧 He was the <span>American</span> <span>ambassador</span> in <span>Paris</span> at the time.<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 At first no one <span>realised</span> that the <span>haze</span> was <span>caused</span> by the <span>volcanic</span> <span>eruption</span> in <span>Iceland</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>Benjamin</span> <span>Franklin</span> who <span>realised</span> that before <span>anyone</span> else.<br/>
🎧 He's often <span>credited</span> with that, <span>apparently</span>.<br/>
🎧 But a <span>French</span> <span>naturalist</span> <span>beat</span> him to it. I can't remember his name.<br/>
🎧 I'd have to look it up.<br/>
🎧 Then other <span>naturalists</span> had the same idea,<br/>
🎧 all <span>independently</span> of each other.<br/>
🎧 Oh right.<br/>
🎧 We should talk about the <span>immediate</span> <span>impact</span> of the <span>eruption</span>, which was <span>obviously</span> <span>enormous</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>especially</span> in <span>Iceland</span>, where so many people <span>died</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'd <span>expect</span> that.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>fact</span> that the <span>volcanic</span> <span>ash</span> <span>drifted</span> so <span>swiftly<br/></span>
🎧 but not that the <span>effects</span> would go on for so long.<br/>
🎧 Or that two years after the <span>eruption</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>strange</span> <span>weather</span> <span>events</span> were being <span>reported</span> as <span>far</span> away as <span>North</span> <span>America</span> and <span>North</span> <span>Africa</span>.<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 I <span>found</span> all that <span>hard</span> to <span>believe</span> too.<br/>
🎧 It must have been <span>terrible<br/></span>
🎧 and there was <span>nothing</span> <span>anyone</span> could do about it,<br/>
🎧 even if they <span>knew</span> the <span>ash</span> <span>cloud</span> was <span>coming</span> in their <span>direction</span>.<br/>
🎧 We should run through some of the <span>terrible</span> <span>consequences</span> of the <span>eruption</span> <span>experienced</span> in different <span>countries</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's quite a <span>varied</span> <span>range</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Starting</span> with <span>Iceland</span>, where the <span>impact</span> on <span>farming</span> was <span>devastating</span>.<br/>
🎧 One of the most <span>dramatic</span> things there was the <span>effect</span> on <span>livestock</span> as they <span>grazed</span> in the <span>fields</span>.<br/>
🎧 They were <span>poisoned</span> because they <span>ate</span> <span>vegetation</span> that had been <span>contaminated</span> with <span>fluorine<br/></span>
🎧 as a <span>result</span> of the <span>volcanic</span> <span>fallout</span>.<br/>
🎧 That was <span>horrible</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>Egypt</span>, the <span>bizarre</span> <span>weather</span> <span>patterns</span> <span>led</span> to a <span>severe</span> <span>drought<br/></span>
🎧 and as a <span>result</span> the <span>Nile</span> didn't <span>flood</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>meant</span> the <span>crops</span> all <span>failed</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's so <span>far</span> from where the <span>eruption</span> <span>happened<br/></span>
🎧 and yet the <span>famine</span> there <span>led</span> to more people <span>dying</span> than any other <span>country</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>worse</span> than the <span>plague</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Then in the <span>UK</span> the <span>mortality</span> <span>rate</span> went up a lot, <span>presumably</span> from <span>respiratory</span> <span>illnesses</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>According</span> to one <span>report</span> it was about <span>double</span> the <span>usual</span> <span>number<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>included</span> an <span>unusually</span> high <span>percentage</span> of people under the age of <span>25</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think people will be <span>surprised</span> to hear that the <span>weather</span> in the <span>USA</span> was <span>badly</span> <span>affected</span> too.<br/>
🎧 <span>George</span> <span>Washington</span> even makes a <span>note</span> in his <span>diary</span> that they were <span>snowbound</span> until <span>March</span> in <span>Virginia</span>.<br/>
🎧 That was before he <span>became</span> <span>president</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, and there was ice <span>floating</span> down the <span>Mississippi</span>, which was <span>unprecedented</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Astonishing</span>, really.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, what do you <span>think..</span>.<br/>

🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 Now, we've been <span>asked</span> to choose an <span>aspect</span> of <span>European</span> <span>clothing</span> or <span>fashion<br/></span>
🎧 and to talk about its <span>development</span> over time.<br/>
🎧 I <span>decided</span> to focus on a rather small <span>area</span> of <span>clothing</span> and that's <span>pockets</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>chose</span> <span>pockets</span> for two <span>reasons</span>, really.<br/>
🎧 We all have them <span>-</span> in <span>jeans</span>, <span>jackets</span>, <span>coats</span>, for example <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and even though we often <span>carry</span> <span>bags</span> or <span>briefcases</span> as well,<br/>
🎧 <span>nothing</span> is quite as <span>convenient</span> as being able to pop your phone or <span>credit</span> <span>card</span> into your <span>pocket</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yet, I <span>suspect</span> that, other than that, people don't really think about <span>pockets</span> too <span>much<br/></span>
🎧 and they're rather <span>overlooked</span> as a <span>fashion</span> <span>item</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>certainly</span> very <span>interesting</span> to go back in <span>time<br/></span>
🎧 and see how <span>pockets</span> <span>developed</span> for men and <span>women</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>18th</span> <span>century</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>fashions</span> were quite different from the way they are now,<br/>
🎧 and <span>pockets</span> were too.<br/>
🎧 If we think about <span>male</span> <span>fashion</span> <span>first..</span>.<br/>
🎧 that was the time when <span>suits</span> <span>became</span> <span>popular</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trousers</span> were <span>knee-length</span> only and <span>referred</span> to as <span>'breeches'</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>waistcoats</span> were short and the <span>jackets</span> were long,<br/>
🎧 but all <span>three</span> <span>garments</span> were <span>lined</span> with <span>material<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>pockets</span> were <span>sewn</span> into this <span>cloth</span> by <span>whichever</span> <span>tailor</span> the <span>customer</span> used.<br/>
🎧 The <span>wearer</span> could then <span>carry</span> small <span>objects</span> such as <span>pencils</span> or <span>coins</span> on their <span>person<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>reach</span> them through a <span>gap</span> in the <span>lining</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Coat</span> <span>pockets</span> <span>became</span> <span>increasingly</span> <span>decorative</span> on the outside for men who wanted to look <span>stylish</span>,<br/>
🎧 but they were often <span>larger</span> but <span>plainer<br/></span>
🎧 if the <span>wearer</span> was <span>someone</span> with a <span>profession</span> who <span>needed</span> to <span>carry</span> <span>medical</span> <span>instruments</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 a <span>doctor</span> or <span>physician</span>, for example.<br/>
🎧 The <span>development</span> of <span>women's</span> <span>pockets</span> was a little different.<br/>
🎧 For one thing, they weren't <span>nearly</span> as <span>visible</span> or as easy to <span>reach</span> as <span>men's</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>18th</span> and <span>19th</span> <span>centuries</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>women</span> <span>carried</span> <span>numerous</span> <span>possessions</span> on their <span>person<br/></span>
🎧 and some of these could be <span>worth</span> a lot of money.<br/>
🎧 <span>Women</span> were more <span>vulnerable</span> to <span>theft</span> and <span>wealthy</span> <span>women</span>, in <span>particular</span>, <span>worried</span> <span>constantly</span> about <span>pickpockets</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, what they did was to have a <span>pair</span> of <span>pockets</span> made that were <span>tied</span> together with <span>string</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>pockets</span> were made of <span>fabric</span>,<br/>
🎧 which might be <span>recycled</span> <span>cloth</span> if the <span>wearer</span> had little <span>money<br/></span>
🎧 or something more <span>expensive</span>, such as <span>linen</span>,<br/>
🎧 sometimes <span>featuring</span> very <span>delicate</span> <span>embroidery</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Women</span> <span>tied</span> the <span>pockets</span> around their <span>waist</span> so that they <span>hung</span> <span>beneath</span> their <span>clothes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Remember, <span>skirts</span> were long <span>then<br/></span>
🎧 and there was <span>plenty</span> of room to <span>hide</span> a whole <span>range</span> of small <span>possessions</span> between the <span>layers</span> of <span>petticoats</span> that were <span>commonly</span> <span>worn</span>.<br/>
🎧 They would have an <span>opening</span> in the <span>folds</span> of their <span>skirts</span>,<br/>
🎧 through which they could <span>reach</span> whatever they <span>needed</span>, like their <span>perfume</span>.<br/>
🎧 Working <span>women</span>, of course, also <span>needed</span> to <span>carry</span> around <span>items</span> that they might use for whatever <span>job</span> or <span>trade</span> they were <span>involved</span> in,<br/>
🎧 but their <span>pairs</span> of <span>pockets</span> still <span>remained</span> on the inside of their <span>clothing</span>,<br/>
🎧 they just got <span>bigger</span> or <span>longer</span>,<br/>
🎧 sometimes <span>reaching</span> down to their <span>knees</span>!<br/>
🎧 So, the tie on <span>pockets</span> went well into the <span>19th</span> <span>century<br/></span>
🎧 and only <span>changed</span> when <span>fashion</span> <span>altered</span> <span>towards</span> the end of that <span>period</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's when <span>dresses</span> <span>became</span> <span>tighter</span> and less <span>bulky</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>pairs</span> of <span>pockets</span> <span>became</span> very <span>noticeable</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>stood</span> out too much and <span>detracted</span> from the <span>woman's</span> <span>image</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Women</span> who had been used to <span>carrying</span> around a <span>range</span> of personal <span>possessions</span> <span>-</span> and still wanted to <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>needed</span> somewhere to <span>carry</span> these <span>items</span> about their person.<br/>
🎧 That was when small <span>bags</span>, or <span>pouches</span> as they were <span>known</span>, came into <span>fashion<br/></span>
🎧 and, of course, they <span>inevitably</span> <span>led</span> on to the <span>handbag</span> of more <span>modern</span> <span>times</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>particularly</span> when <span>fashion</span> <span>removed</span> <span>pockets</span> <span>altogether</span>.<br/>
