🎧 Good morning, <span>Kenton</span> <span>Festival</span> box <span>office</span>. How can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Oh, good morning.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>coming</span> to <span>Kenton</span> for a few <span>days'</span> <span>holiday</span> next month,<br/>
🎧 and a friend told me there's a <span>festival</span>.<br/>
🎧 She gave me this number to find out about it.<br/>
🎧 That's right, the <span>festival</span> <span>begins</span> on the <span>16th</span> of May and <span>goes</span> on <span>till</span> the <span>19th</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's great.<br/>
🎧 I'll be there from the <span>15th</span> <span>till</span> the <span>19th</span>.<br/>
🎧 So could you tell me the <span>programme</span>, please?<br/>
🎧 Well, on the first day, there's the <span>opening</span> <span>ceremony</span>, in the <span>town</span> <span>centre</span>.<br/>
🎧 People start <span>gathering</span> around <span>2</span> <span>o'clock</span>, to get a good place to see from,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>events</span> will start at <span>2.45</span>, and <span>finish</span> about <span>5.30</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, thanks. I'll make sure I get there <span>early</span> to get a good <span>spot</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>festival</span> will be <span>officially</span> <span>opened</span> by the <span>mayor</span>.<br/>
🎧 He'll just speak for a few <span>minutes</span>, <span>welcoming</span> everyone to the <span>festival</span>.<br/>
🎧 All the <span>town</span> <span>councillors</span> will be there, and of course lots of other people.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Then <span>there'll</span> be a <span>performance</span> by a <span>band</span>.<br/>
🎧 Most years we have a <span>children's</span> <span>choir</span>,<br/>
🎧 but this year the <span>local</span> <span>army</span> <span>cadets</span> <span>offered</span> to <span>perform</span>,<br/>
🎧 and they're very good.<br/>
🎧 After that, a <span>community</span> group from the <span>town</span> will <span>perform</span> a play <span>they've</span> <span>written</span> <span>themselves</span>, just a short one.<br/>
🎧 It's about <span>Helen</span> <span>Tungate</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't know if you've heard of her?<br/>
🎧 I <span>certainly</span> have.<br/>
🎧 She was a <span>scientist</span> years ago.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 She was <span>born</span> in <span>Kenton</span> exactly <span>100</span> years ago,<br/>
🎧 so we're <span>celebrating</span> her <span>centenary</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm a <span>biologist</span>, so I've always been interested in her,<br/>
🎧 I didn't <span>realise</span> she came from <span>Kenton</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Well, all that will take place in the <span>afternoon</span>,<br/>
🎧 and later, as the sun <span>sets</span>, <span>there'll</span> be a <span>firework</span> <span>display</span>.<br/>
🎧 You should go to the <span>park</span> to <span>watch</span>, as you'll get the best <span>view</span> from there,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>display</span> takes place on the <span>opposite</span> side of the <span>river</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's always one of the most <span>popular</span> <span>events</span> in the <span>festival</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sounds great.<br/>
🎧 And what's <span>happening</span> on the other <span>days</span>?<br/>
🎧 There are <span>several</span> <span>events</span> that go on the whole time.<br/>
🎧 For example, the students of the <span>art</span> <span>college</span> have <span>produced</span> a number of <span>videos</span>,<br/>
🎧 all <span>connected</span> with <span>relationships</span> between children and their <span>grandparents</span>.<br/>
🎧 That sounds <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 It makes a change from children and <span>parents</span>, doesn't it!<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 Because the <span>art</span> <span>college</span> is in use for <span>classes</span>, <span>throughout</span> the <span>festival</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>videos</span> are being <span>shown</span> in <span>Handsworth</span> House.<br/>
🎧 How do you <span>spell</span> the name?<br/>
🎧 <span>H-A-N-D-S-W-O-R-T-H</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Handsworth</span> House.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>close</span> to the <span>Town</span> <span>Hall</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Now let me see, what else can I tell you about?<br/>
🎧 Are there any <span>displays</span> of <span>ballet</span> <span>dancing</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>particularly</span> interested in that as I do it as a hobby.<br/>
🎧 There isn't any <span>ballet</span>, I'm <span>afraid</span>,<br/>
🎧 but <span>there'll</span> be a <span>demonstration</span> of <span>traditional</span> <span>dances</span> from all <span>round</span> the <span>country</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that'd be nice.<br/>
🎧 Where's that being <span>held</span>?<br/>
🎧 It's in the <span>market</span> in the <span>town</span> <span>centre</span> <span>-</span> the <span>outdoor</span> one, not the <span>covered</span> <span>market</span>.<br/>
🎧 And it's on at <span>2</span> and <span>5</span> every <span>afternoon</span> of the <span>festival</span>, <span>apart</span> from the first day.<br/>
🎧 <span>Lovely</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm interested in all <span>kinds</span> of <span>dancing</span>, so I'm sure I'll enjoy that!<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you will.<br/>
🎧 And I'd really like to go to some <span>concerts</span>, if there are any.<br/>
🎧 Yes, there are <span>several</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Three</span> <span>performed</span> by <span>professionals</span>, and one by <span>local</span> children.<br/>
🎧 And where is it being <span>held</span>?<br/>
🎧 It's in the <span>library</span>, which is in <span>Part</span> <span>Street</span>.<br/>
🎧 On the <span>18th</span>, at <span>6.30</span> in the <span>evening</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>presume</span> I'll need <span>tickets</span> for that.<br/>
🎧 Yes, you can book online,<br/>
🎧 or you can buy them when you <span>arrive</span> in <span>Kenton</span>,<br/>
🎧 either at the <span>festival</span> box <span>office</span>, or from any <span>shops</span> <span>displaying</span> our <span>logo</span> in the <span>windows</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, I think <span>that'll</span> keep me <span>busy</span> for the whole of my <span>stay</span> in <span>Kenton</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you so much for all your help.<br/>
🎧 You're <span>welcome</span>. I hope you enjoy your <span>stay</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you. <span>Goodbye</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Right. I've now almost <span>succeeded</span> in <span>finalising</span> <span>plans</span> for our <span>tour</span>,<br/>
🎧 so I'll <span>bring</span> you up to date with what I know.<br/>
🎧 As you know, we're <span>flying</span> first to <span>Munich</span>, on <span>Monday</span> the <span>4th</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>flight</span> is at <span>11.30</span>,<br/>
🎧 so it's too <span>early</span> to have lunch at the <span>airport</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suggest</span> we meet there for <span>coffee</span> at <span>10</span>,<br/>
🎧 which should give us <span>plenty</span> of time for <span>breakfast</span> before we leave home.<br/>
🎧 When we <span>arrive</span> in <span>Munich</span>, we'll be <span>met</span> at the <span>airport</span> by <span>Claus</span> <span>Bauer</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Claus</span> <span>works</span> for a <span>tour</span> <span>operator</span>, and he'll look after us for the time we'll be in <span>Germany</span>.<br/>
🎧 He's already <span>liaised</span> with the <span>managers</span> of the <span>theatres</span> we're going to visit,<br/>
🎧 and he's also <span>arranged</span> for an <span>officer</span> of the <span>National</span> <span>Theatre</span> in <span>Munich<br/></span>
🎧 to show us <span>round</span> the <span>theatre</span> one <span>afternoon</span> during our <span>stay</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now last time we <span>discussed</span> this <span>trip</span>,<br/>
🎧 I didn't have the <span>precise</span> <span>cost</span> for <span>hotel</span> <span>rooms</span>, but now I have.<br/>
🎧 The <span>normal</span> <span>rate</span> at the <span>hotel</span> where we're <span>staying</span> is <span>150</span> <span>euros</span> a <span>night</span> for a <span>double</span> room.<br/>
🎧 I'd <span>hoped</span> to get that down to <span>120</span> <span>euros</span>,<br/>
🎧 but in <span>fact</span> I've been able to <span>negotiate</span> a <span>rate</span> of <span>110</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>That'll</span> be <span>reflected</span> in the <span>final</span> <span>payment</span> which you'll need to make by the end of this week.<br/>
🎧 On <span>Tuesday</span>, the day after our <span>arrival</span>,<br/>
🎧 I had <span>hoped</span> we could sit in on a <span>rehearsal</span> at one of the <span>theatres</span>,<br/>
🎧 but <span>unfortunately</span> that's <span>proved</span> very <span>difficult</span> to <span>arrange</span>,<br/>
🎧 so <span>instead</span> we'll have a <span>coach</span> <span>trip</span> to one of the amazing <span>castles</span> in the <span>mountains</span> <span>south</span> of <span>Munich</span>.<br/>
🎧 On <span>Tuesday</span> <span>evening</span>, we'll all have dinner together in a <span>restaurant</span> near our <span>hotel</span>.<br/>
🎧 From talking to you all about your <span>preferences</span>,<br/>
🎧 it was <span>clear</span> that a <span>typical</span> <span>local</span> <span>restaurant</span> would be too <span>meat-oriented</span> for some of you.<br/>
🎧 Some of you <span>suggested</span> an <span>Italian</span> <span>restaurant</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I must <span>confess</span> that I <span>decided</span> to book a <span>Lebanese</span> one,<br/>
🎧 as we have <span>plenty</span> of <span>opportunities</span> to go to an <span>Italian</span> <span>restaurant</span> at home.<br/>
🎧 On <span>Wednesday</span> <span>afternoon</span>, the <span>director</span> of the play we're going to see that <span>evening</span> will talk to us at the <span>theatre</span>.<br/>
🎧 She'll <span>describe</span> the whole <span>process</span> of <span>producing</span> a play,<br/>
🎧 <span>including</span> how she <span>chose</span> the <span>actors</span>,<br/>
🎧 and, as the play we're going to see is a <span>modern</span> one, how she <span>worked</span> with the <span>playwright</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Now I'd just like to make a few <span>points</span> about the <span>plays</span> we're going to see,<br/>
🎧 <span>partly</span> because it might <span>influence</span> your <span>choice</span> of <span>clothes</span> to take with you!<br/>
🎧 The play we're <span>seeing</span> on <span>Wednesday</span> <span>evening</span> is a <span>modern</span> one,<br/>
🎧 and we're going to the <span>premiere</span>, so it'll be quite a <span>dressy</span> <span>occasion</span>,<br/>
🎧 though of course you don't have to <span>dress</span> <span>formally</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>gather</span> it's rather a <span>multimedia</span> <span>production</span>,<br/>
🎧 with amazing <span>lighting</span> <span>effects</span> and a <span>soundtrack</span> of <span>electronic</span> music,<br/>
🎧 though <span>unfortunately</span> the <span>playwright</span> is <span>ill</span> and is <span>unlikely</span> to be able to <span>attend</span>.<br/>
🎧 On <span>Thursday</span> we're <span>seeing</span> a play that was first <span>performed</span> last year,<br/>
🎧 when it was <span>commissioned</span> to <span>mark</span> a <span>hundred</span> years since the <span>birth</span> in the <span>town</span> of a <span>well-known</span> <span>scientist</span>.<br/>
🎧 We're going to see a <span>revival</span> of that <span>production</span>, which <span>aroused</span> a lot of <span>interest</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Friday's</span> play will really make you think <span>hard</span> about what <span>clothes</span> to <span>pack</span>,<br/>
🎧 as it'll be in the garden of a <span>palace</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>beautiful</span> <span>setting</span>, but I'd better <span>warn</span> you, there won't be much <span>protection</span> from the <span>wind</span>.<br/>
🎧 On <span>Saturday</span>, we're going by <span>coach</span> to a <span>theatre</span> in another <span>town</span>, not <span>far</span> from <span>Munich</span>.<br/>
🎧 This will be the <span>opening</span> of a <span>drama</span> <span>festival</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>mayor</span> and all the other <span>dignitaries</span> of the <span>town</span> will be <span>attending</span>.<br/>
🎧 After the <span>performance</span>, the <span>mayor</span> is <span>hosting</span> a <span>reception</span> for all the <span>audience</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>there'll</span> be a <span>band</span> playing <span>traditional</span> music of the <span>region</span>.<br/>
🎧 And after having a day off on <span>Sunday</span>, our <span>final</span> play is on <span>Monday</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it's in the <span>stunning</span> <span>setting</span> of the old <span>Town</span> <span>Hall</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>dates</span> back to the <span>14th</span> <span>century</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>performance</span> <span>marks</span> the <span>fifty</span> years that the <span>lead</span> <span>actor</span> has been on <span>stage</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the play is the one where he made his first <span>professional</span> <span>appearance</span>, all those years ago.<br/>
🎧 And the day after that, we'll be <span>flying</span> back home.<br/>
🎧 Now have you got any <span>questions..</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Oh good morning. You must be <span>James</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>Beth</span> <span>Cartwright</span> <span>-</span> please call me <span>Beth</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Now as this is your first <span>tutorial</span> since you <span>started</span> on the <span>Scandinavian</span> <span>Studies</span> course,<br/>
🎧 I'd like to find out something about you.<br/>
🎧 Why did you decide to take this course?<br/>
🎧 Well, my <span>mother</span> is <span>Danish</span>, and although we always <span>lived</span> in <span>England</span>, she used to talk about her home a lot,<br/>
🎧 and that made me want to visit <span>Denmark</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>hardly</span> ever did, though <span>-</span> my <span>mother</span> usually went on her own.<br/>
🎧 But <span>whenever</span> her <span>relations</span> or friends were in <span>England</span> they always came to see us.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 So I <span>assume</span> you already speak <span>Danish</span>, one of the <span>languages</span> you'll be <span>studying</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can get by when I talk to people, though I'm not <span>terribly</span> <span>accurate</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now you probably know that you'll <span>spend</span> the <span>third</span> year of the course <span>abroad</span>.<br/>
🎧 Have you had any <span>thoughts</span> about that?<br/>
🎧 I'm really looking forward to it.<br/>
🎧 And although <span>Denmark</span> <span>seems</span> the <span>obvious</span> place to go, because of my <span>family</span> <span>connections</span>,<br/>
🎧 I'd love to <span>spend</span> the time in <span>Iceland</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I'm sure it can be <span>arranged</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you have any <span>plans</span> for when you <span>graduate</span>?<br/>
🎧 A lot of students go on to take a <span>master's</span> <span>degree</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think the <span>four</span> years of the <span>undergraduate</span> course will be enough for me.<br/>
🎧 I'm interested in <span>journalism</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I quite like the idea of <span>moving</span> to <span>Scandinavia</span> and <span>writing</span> for <span>magazines</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd find that more <span>creative</span> than <span>translating</span>, which I <span>suppose</span> most <span>graduates</span> do.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Now how are you <span>finding</span> the <span>courses</span> you're taking this <span>term</span>, <span>James</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm really <span>enjoying</span> the one on <span>Swedish</span> <span>cinema</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>That'll</span> <span>continue</span> next <span>term</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the one on <span>Scandinavian</span> <span>literature</span> that's <span>running</span> at the <span>moment</span> will be <span>replaced</span> by more <span>specialised</span> <span>courses</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and by the way, if you're interested in watching <span>Danish</span> <span>television</span> <span>programmes</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 there's going to be a course on that the <span>term</span> after next.<br/>
🎧 That sounds good.<br/>
🎧 Have you <span>started</span> thinking about the <span>literature</span> <span>paper</span> that you have to <span>write</span> in the next few <span>weeks</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, my first <span>choice</span> would be to do something on the <span>Icelandic</span> <span>sagas</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>trouble</span> with that is that a lot of people choose that <span>topic</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it can be <span>difficult</span> to get <span>hold</span> of the books you'll need.<br/>
🎧 Why not leave that for another time?<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 You might find <span>modern</span> <span>novels</span> or <span>19th</span> <span>century</span> <span>playwrights</span> <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've read or <span>seen</span> <span>several</span> <span>plays</span> in <span>translation</span>, so that would be a good idea.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 I'll put you down for that <span>topic</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right. So what would you <span>advise</span> me to <span>aim</span> at in the <span>paper</span>?<br/>
🎧 First I <span>suggest</span> you <span>avoid</span> taking one <span>writer</span> and going into a great <span>deal</span> of <span>detail</span>.<br/>
🎧 That <span>approach</span> <span>certainly</span> has its place,<br/>
🎧 but I think you first need to get an <span>understanding</span> of the <span>literature</span> in the <span>context</span> of the <span>society</span> in which it was <span>produced</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 who it was <span>written</span> for, how it was <span>published</span>, and so on.<br/>
🎧 I also think that's more <span>fruitful</span> than <span>placing</span> it <span>within</span> the <span>history</span> of the <span>genre</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, that sounds <span>reasonable</span>.<br/>
🎧 Could I ask for some advice about <span>writing</span> the <span>paper</span> I'm working on about the <span>Vikings</span>?<br/>
🎧 I have to do that this week, and I'm a bit <span>stuck</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 Have you <span>decided</span> yet what to <span>write</span> about?<br/>
🎧 No, I haven't.<br/>
🎧 There's so much that <span>seems</span> <span>interesting</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Viking</span> <span>settlement</span> in other <span>countries</span>, <span>trade</span>, <span>mythology…<br/></span>
🎧 Well, what I <span>suggest</span> is that you read an <span>assignment</span> a student <span>wrote</span> last year, which is <span>kept</span> in the <span>library</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's short and well <span>focused</span>, and I'm sure you'll find it <span>helpful</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll give you the <span>details</span> in a <span>moment</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Textbooks</span> usually <span>cover</span> so many <span>topics</span>, it can be very <span>difficult</span> to choose just one.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 I've got a <span>DVD</span> of the <span>film</span> about the <span>Vikings</span> that came out <span>earlier</span> this year.<br/>
🎧 Should I <span>watch</span> that again?<br/>
🎧 If it's the one I am thinking of, <span>hmm</span>, I'd <span>ignore</span> it <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it's more <span>fantasy</span> than <span>reality</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I've got a <span>recording</span> of a <span>documentary</span> that you should <span>watch</span>.<br/>
🎧 It makes some <span>interesting</span> and <span>provocative</span> <span>points</span>, which I think will help you to focus your <span>topic</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So then should I work out an <span>outline</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes. Just <span>headings</span> for different <span>sections</span>, at this <span>stage</span>.<br/>
🎧 And then you should start looking for <span>suitable</span> <span>articles</span> and books to <span>draw</span> on,<br/>
🎧 and take <span>notes</span> which you <span>organise</span> <span>according</span> to those <span>headings</span>.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 Then put short <span>phrases</span> and <span>sentences</span> as <span>bullet</span> <span>points</span> under each <span>heading</span>.<br/>
🎧 Make sure that this <span>skeleton</span> makes <span>sense</span> and <span>flows</span> <span>properly</span>, before <span>writing</span> up the <span>paper</span> in full.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Thanks, that's very <span>helpful</span>.<br/>

🎧 Over the years, <span>attitudes</span> <span>towards</span> <span>workers</span> have <span>changed</span> <span>considerably</span>.<br/>
🎧 After all, there was a time when <span>workers</span> had no <span>rights</span> at all, and <span>laboured</span> in <span>appalling</span> <span>conditions</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Conditions</span> have <span>improved</span> a lot, but <span>conflict</span> in the <span>workplace</span> is still <span>common</span>.<br/>
🎧 And <span>human</span> <span>resources</span> <span>managers</span> <span>nowadays</span> need to be able to <span>deal</span> with it when <span>necessary</span>.<br/>
🎧 What is <span>conflict</span> in the <span>workplace</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Definitions</span> <span>vary</span>, but I'm taking it to <span>refer</span> to a whole <span>range</span> of <span>behaviours</span> that the <span>victim</span> <span>finds</span> <span>unacceptable</span>,<br/>
🎧 from <span>minor</span>, <span>harmless</span> <span>arguments</span> to <span>-</span> at the <span>opposite</span> <span>extreme</span> <span>-</span> <span>physical</span> <span>violence</span>.<br/>
🎧 Much of this is <span>covered</span> by the <span>term</span> <span>bullying</span>,<br/>
🎧 by which I mean one or more people <span>behaving</span> <span>abusively</span> or <span>aggressively</span> <span>against</span> another who is in a <span>weaker</span> <span>position</span>.<br/>
🎧 Although all <span>behaviour</span> like this is a <span>form</span> of <span>conflict</span>, not all <span>conflict</span> can be <span>described</span> in these <span>terms</span>.<br/>
🎧 As with all <span>human</span> <span>behaviour</span>, there are <span>numerous</span> <span>reasons</span> for it.<br/>
🎧 But often it's <span>caused</span> by <span>someone</span> who <span>feels</span> the need to show their <span>superiority</span> over <span>someone</span> else,<br/>
🎧 in order to feel that they aren't at the <span>lowest</span> <span>level</span> in a <span>hierarchy</span> or a group of people.<br/>
🎧 In some <span>cases</span> one person <span>simply</span> <span>dislikes</span> the other,<br/>
🎧 on the <span>basis</span> that the <span>personality</span> of one is in some way <span>incompatible</span> with that of the other person.<br/>
🎧 A <span>general</span> <span>habit</span> of <span>optimism</span> in one person could make them <span>intolerant</span> of a <span>colleague</span> who's <span>constantly</span> <span>pessimistic</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 not that that <span>justifies</span> <span>treating</span> them <span>badly</span>, of course.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>conflicts</span> <span>arise</span> when people are more interested in <span>promoting</span> <span>themselves</span> and their <span>team</span> than in the company as a whole.<br/>
🎧 These <span>conflicts</span> are called <span>'structural'</span>,<br/>
🎧 and could come about, for example, when a <span>sales</span> <span>team</span> <span>believe</span> they are the only people in the <span>business</span> who do any useful work,<br/>
🎧 and look down on <span>behind-the-scenes</span> <span>administrators</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Conflict</span> <span>obviously</span> <span>affects</span> the <span>individuals</span> <span>concerned</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>situation</span> is <span>likely</span> to be very <span>stressful</span> for <span>victims</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>resulting</span> in their <span>absence</span> from work, <span>possibly</span> for <span>months</span>.<br/>
🎧 For the company, if no <span>effort</span> is made to <span>deal</span> with <span>conflict</span>,<br/>
🎧 it can <span>spiral</span> out of <span>control</span>, and even <span>lead</span> to the <span>breakdown</span> of the <span>business</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>interesting</span> work with <span>chief</span> <span>executives</span> <span>-</span> <span>CEOs</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 has <span>uncovered</span> some of the <span>reasons</span> why they may <span>treat</span> <span>colleagues</span> <span>badly</span>.<br/>
🎧 Many <span>CEOs</span> <span>combine</span> two <span>opposing</span> <span>characteristics:<br/></span>
🎧 <span>confidence</span> <span>-</span> that is, the <span>belief</span> that they're <span>capable</span> of great <span>achievements</span> <span>-</span> with a high <span>level</span> of <span>anxiety</span>,<br/>
🎧 a <span>fear</span> of <span>missing</span> <span>targets</span>, <span>whether</span> set by <span>themselves</span> or by the <span>directors</span> of the company.<br/>
🎧 This <span>combination</span> can make them <span>respond</span> <span>badly</span> to <span>anyone</span> who <span>questions</span> their <span>decisions</span>.<br/>
🎧 In a high <span>pressure</span> work <span>environment</span>, such <span>characteristics</span> become <span>problematic</span>.<br/>
🎧 And it's <span>particularly</span> <span>difficult</span> to <span>tackle</span> the <span>situation<br/></span>
🎧 where <span>colleagues</span>, <span>managers</span> and <span>board</span> <span>members</span> are all trying to <span>achieve</span> their own <span>visions</span>.<br/>
🎧 When they can't agree on <span>strategic</span> issues and on where they see the <span>business</span> going,<br/>
🎧 there are <span>real</span> <span>problems</span>.<br/>
🎧 For <span>managers</span> at <span>lower</span> <span>levels</span> <span>within</span> the <span>organisation</span>,<br/>
🎧 it might <span>seem</span> that an <span>autocratic</span> <span>form</span> of <span>management</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 where the <span>chief</span> <span>executive</span> <span>gives</span> <span>orders</span> and everyone else has to <span>obey</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 would see more <span>conflict</span> than <span>others</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Interestingly</span>, though, a company with a more <span>democratic</span> <span>business</span> <span>model</span>, can <span>suffer</span> more,<br/>
🎧 when <span>uncertainty</span> about who to <span>report</span> to <span>leads</span> to <span>conflicting</span> <span>demands</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now I'll say a little about <span>dealing</span> with the <span>type</span> of <span>conflict</span> that has <span>harmful</span> <span>effects</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course the <span>ideal</span> is to <span>prevent</span> it <span>arising</span> in the first place.<br/>
🎧 A good <span>manager</span>, at any <span>level</span>, will make <span>efforts</span> to <span>earn</span> the <span>respect</span> of the people they work with,<br/>
🎧 <span>particularly</span> those who <span>report</span> to them.<br/>
🎧 That will <span>involve</span> <span>politeness</span> in all <span>communications</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>treating</span> them as <span>equals</span> who <span>happen</span> to have a different <span>role</span> <span>within</span> the <span>organisation</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes, of course, <span>conflict</span> does <span>occur</span>, and can get out of <span>hand</span>.<br/>
🎧 In such <span>cases</span> the <span>human</span> <span>resources</span> <span>department</span> often <span>gets</span> <span>involved</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, if one of the <span>parties</span> in a <span>conflict</span> <span>sees</span> <span>human</span> <span>resources</span> as <span>simply</span> a <span>mouthpiece</span> for the <span>chief</span> <span>executive</span>,<br/>
🎧 then an <span>external</span> <span>mediator</span> might be able to help.<br/>
🎧 By talking to both <span>sides</span>, and trying to find the <span>truth</span> of what's been <span>happening</span>,<br/>
🎧 they can <span>build</span> a <span>clear</span> <span>picture</span> of the <span>situation</span>,<br/>
🎧 and give <span>feedback</span> that both <span>sides</span> will <span>accept</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>precisely</span> because they're <span>independent</span>.<br/>
