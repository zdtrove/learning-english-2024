🎧 Good morning, <span>Kenton <span>Festival box <span>office. How can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Oh, good morning.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>coming to <span>Kenton for a few <span>days' <span>holiday next month,<br/>
🎧 and a friend told me there's a <span>festival.<br/>
🎧 She gave me this number to find out about it.<br/>
🎧 That's right, the <span>festival <span>begins on the <span>16th of May and <span>goes on <span>till the <span>19th.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's great.<br/>
🎧 I'll be there from the <span>15th <span>till the <span>19th.<br/>
🎧 So could you tell me the <span>programme, please?<br/>
🎧 Well, on the first day, there's the <span>opening <span>ceremony, in the <span>town <span>centre.<br/>
🎧 People start <span>gathering around <span>2 <span>o'clock, to get a good place to see from,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>events will start at <span>2.45, and <span>finish about <span>5.30.<br/>
🎧 OK, thanks. I'll make sure I get there <span>early to get a good <span>spot.<br/>
🎧 The <span>festival will be <span>officially <span>opened by the <span>mayor.<br/>
🎧 He'll just speak for a few <span>minutes, <span>welcoming everyone to the <span>festival.<br/>
🎧 All the <span>town <span>councillors will be there, and of course lots of other people.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Then <span>there'll be a <span>performance by a <span>band.<br/>
🎧 Most years we have a <span>children's <span>choir,<br/>
🎧 but this year the <span>local <span>army <span>cadets <span>offered to <span>perform,<br/>
🎧 and they're very good.<br/>
🎧 After that, a <span>community group from the <span>town will <span>perform a play <span>they've <span>written <span>themselves, just a short one.<br/>
🎧 It's about <span>Helen <span>Tungate.<br/>
🎧 I don't know if you've heard of her?<br/>
🎧 I <span>certainly have.<br/>
🎧 She was a <span>scientist years ago.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 She was <span>born in <span>Kenton exactly <span>100 years ago,<br/>
🎧 so we're <span>celebrating her <span>centenary.<br/>
🎧 I'm a <span>biologist, so I've always been interested in her,<br/>
🎧 I didn't <span>realise she came from <span>Kenton.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Well, all that will take place in the <span>afternoon,<br/>
🎧 and later, as the sun <span>sets, <span>there'll be a <span>firework <span>display.<br/>
🎧 You should go to the <span>park to <span>watch, as you'll get the best <span>view from there,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>display takes place on the <span>opposite side of the <span>river.<br/>
🎧 It's always one of the most <span>popular <span>events in the <span>festival.<br/>
🎧 Sounds great.<br/>
🎧 And what's <span>happening on the other <span>days?<br/>
🎧 There are <span>several <span>events that go on the whole time.<br/>
🎧 For example, the students of the <span>art <span>college have <span>produced a number of <span>videos,<br/>
🎧 all <span>connected with <span>relationships between children and their <span>grandparents.<br/>
🎧 That sounds <span>interesting.<br/>
🎧 It makes a change from children and <span>parents, doesn't it!<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 Because the <span>art <span>college is in use for <span>classes, <span>throughout the <span>festival,<br/>
🎧 the <span>videos are being <span>shown in <span>Handsworth House.<br/>
🎧 How do you <span>spell the name?<br/>
🎧 <span>H-A-N-D-S-W-O-R-T-H.<br/>
🎧 <span>Handsworth House.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>close to the <span>Town <span>Hall.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Now let me see, what else can I tell you about?<br/>
🎧 Are there any <span>displays of <span>ballet <span>dancing?<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>particularly interested in that as I do it as a hobby.<br/>
🎧 There isn't any <span>ballet, I'm <span>afraid,<br/>
🎧 but <span>there'll be a <span>demonstration of <span>traditional <span>dances from all <span>round the <span>country.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that'd be nice.<br/>
🎧 Where's that being <span>held?<br/>
🎧 It's in the <span>market in the <span>town <span>centre <span>- the <span>outdoor one, not the <span>covered <span>market.<br/>
🎧 And it's on at <span>2 and <span>5 every <span>afternoon of the <span>festival, <span>apart from the first day.<br/>
🎧 <span>Lovely.<br/>
🎧 I'm interested in all <span>kinds of <span>dancing, so I'm sure I'll enjoy that!<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you will.<br/>
🎧 And I'd really like to go to some <span>concerts, if there are any.<br/>
🎧 Yes, there are <span>several.<br/>
🎧 <span>Three <span>performed by <span>professionals, and one by <span>local children.<br/>
🎧 And where is it being <span>held?<br/>
🎧 It's in the <span>library, which is in <span>Part <span>Street.<br/>
🎧 On the <span>18th, at <span>6.30 in the <span>evening.<br/>
🎧 I <span>presume I'll need <span>tickets for that.<br/>
🎧 Yes, you can book online,<br/>
🎧 or you can buy them when you <span>arrive in <span>Kenton,<br/>
🎧 either at the <span>festival box <span>office, or from any <span>shops <span>displaying our <span>logo in the <span>windows.<br/>
🎧 Well, I think <span>that'll keep me <span>busy for the whole of my <span>stay in <span>Kenton.<br/>
🎧 Thank you so much for all your help.<br/>
🎧 You're <span>welcome. I hope you enjoy your <span>stay.<br/>
🎧 Thank you. <span>Goodbye.<br/>

🎧 Right. I've now almost <span>succeeded in <span>finalising <span>plans for our <span>tour,<br/>
🎧 so I'll <span>bring you up to date with what I know.<br/>
🎧 As you know, we're <span>flying first to <span>Munich, on <span>Monday the <span>4th.<br/>
🎧 The <span>flight is at <span>11.30,<br/>
🎧 so it's too <span>early to have lunch at the <span>airport.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suggest we meet there for <span>coffee at <span>10,<br/>
🎧 which should give us <span>plenty of time for <span>breakfast before we leave home.<br/>
🎧 When we <span>arrive in <span>Munich, we'll be <span>met at the <span>airport by <span>Claus <span>Bauer.<br/>
🎧 <span>Claus <span>works for a <span>tour <span>operator, and he'll look after us for the time we'll be in <span>Germany.<br/>
🎧 He's already <span>liaised with the <span>managers of the <span>theatres we're going to visit,<br/>
🎧 and he's also <span>arranged for an <span>officer of the <span>National <span>Theatre in <span>Munich<br/>
🎧 to show us <span>round the <span>theatre one <span>afternoon during our <span>stay.<br/>
🎧 Now last time we <span>discussed this <span>trip,<br/>
🎧 I didn't have the <span>precise <span>cost for <span>hotel <span>rooms, but now I have.<br/>
🎧 The <span>normal <span>rate at the <span>hotel where we're <span>staying is <span>150 <span>euros a <span>night for a <span>double room.<br/>
🎧 I'd <span>hoped to get that down to <span>120 <span>euros,<br/>
🎧 but in <span>fact I've been able to <span>negotiate a <span>rate of <span>110.<br/>
🎧 <span>That'll be <span>reflected in the <span>final <span>payment which you'll need to make by the end of this week.<br/>
🎧 On <span>Tuesday, the day after our <span>arrival,<br/>
🎧 I had <span>hoped we could sit in on a <span>rehearsal at one of the <span>theatres,<br/>
🎧 but <span>unfortunately that's <span>proved very <span>difficult to <span>arrange,<br/>
🎧 so <span>instead we'll have a <span>coach <span>trip to one of the amazing <span>castles in the <span>mountains <span>south of <span>Munich.<br/>
🎧 On <span>Tuesday <span>evening, we'll all have dinner together in a <span>restaurant near our <span>hotel.<br/>
🎧 From talking to you all about your <span>preferences,<br/>
🎧 it was <span>clear that a <span>typical <span>local <span>restaurant would be too <span>meat-oriented for some of you.<br/>
🎧 Some of you <span>suggested an <span>Italian <span>restaurant,<br/>
🎧 but I must <span>confess that I <span>decided to book a <span>Lebanese one,<br/>
🎧 as we have <span>plenty of <span>opportunities to go to an <span>Italian <span>restaurant at home.<br/>
🎧 On <span>Wednesday <span>afternoon, the <span>director of the play we're going to see that <span>evening will talk to us at the <span>theatre.<br/>
🎧 She'll <span>describe the whole <span>process of <span>producing a play,<br/>
🎧 <span>including how she <span>chose the <span>actors,<br/>
🎧 and, as the play we're going to see is a <span>modern one, how she <span>worked with the <span>playwright.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Now I'd just like to make a few <span>points about the <span>plays we're going to see,<br/>
🎧 <span>partly because it might <span>influence your <span>choice of <span>clothes to take with you!<br/>
🎧 The play we're <span>seeing on <span>Wednesday <span>evening is a <span>modern one,<br/>
🎧 and we're going to the <span>premiere, so it'll be quite a <span>dressy <span>occasion,<br/>
🎧 though of course you don't have to <span>dress <span>formally.<br/>
🎧 I <span>gather it's rather a <span>multimedia <span>production,<br/>
🎧 with amazing <span>lighting <span>effects and a <span>soundtrack of <span>electronic music,<br/>
🎧 though <span>unfortunately the <span>playwright is <span>ill and is <span>unlikely to be able to <span>attend.<br/>
🎧 On <span>Thursday we're <span>seeing a play that was first <span>performed last year,<br/>
🎧 when it was <span>commissioned to <span>mark a <span>hundred years since the <span>birth in the <span>town of a <span>well-known <span>scientist.<br/>
🎧 We're going to see a <span>revival of that <span>production, which <span>aroused a lot of <span>interest.<br/>
🎧 <span>Friday's play will really make you think <span>hard about what <span>clothes to <span>pack,<br/>
🎧 as it'll be in the garden of a <span>palace.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>beautiful <span>setting, but I'd better <span>warn you, there won't be much <span>protection from the <span>wind.<br/>
🎧 On <span>Saturday, we're going by <span>coach to a <span>theatre in another <span>town, not <span>far from <span>Munich.<br/>
🎧 This will be the <span>opening of a <span>drama <span>festival,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>mayor and all the other <span>dignitaries of the <span>town will be <span>attending.<br/>
🎧 After the <span>performance, the <span>mayor is <span>hosting a <span>reception for all the <span>audience,<br/>
🎧 and <span>there'll be a <span>band playing <span>traditional music of the <span>region.<br/>
🎧 And after having a day off on <span>Sunday, our <span>final play is on <span>Monday,<br/>
🎧 and it's in the <span>stunning <span>setting of the old <span>Town <span>Hall,<br/>
🎧 which <span>dates back to the <span>14th <span>century.<br/>
🎧 The <span>performance <span>marks the <span>fifty years that the <span>lead <span>actor has been on <span>stage,<br/>
🎧 and the play is the one where he made his first <span>professional <span>appearance, all those years ago.<br/>
🎧 And the day after that, we'll be <span>flying back home.<br/>
🎧 Now have you got any <span>questions...<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Oh good morning. You must be <span>James.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>Beth <span>Cartwright <span>- please call me <span>Beth.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Now as this is your first <span>tutorial since you <span>started on the <span>Scandinavian <span>Studies course,<br/>
🎧 I'd like to find out something about you.<br/>
🎧 Why did you decide to take this course?<br/>
🎧 Well, my <span>mother is <span>Danish, and although we always <span>lived in <span>England, she used to talk about her home a lot,<br/>
🎧 and that made me want to visit <span>Denmark.<br/>
🎧 We <span>hardly ever did, though <span>- my <span>mother usually went on her own.<br/>
🎧 But <span>whenever her <span>relations or friends were in <span>England they always came to see us.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 So I <span>assume you already speak <span>Danish, one of the <span>languages you'll be <span>studying.<br/>
🎧 I can get by when I talk to people, though I'm not <span>terribly <span>accurate.<br/>
🎧 Now you probably know that you'll <span>spend the <span>third year of the course <span>abroad.<br/>
🎧 Have you had any <span>thoughts about that?<br/>
🎧 I'm really looking forward to it.<br/>
🎧 And although <span>Denmark <span>seems the <span>obvious place to go, because of my <span>family <span>connections,<br/>
🎧 I'd love to <span>spend the time in <span>Iceland.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I'm sure it can be <span>arranged.<br/>
🎧 Do you have any <span>plans for when you <span>graduate?<br/>
🎧 A lot of students go on to take a <span>master's <span>degree.<br/>
🎧 I think the <span>four years of the <span>undergraduate course will be enough for me.<br/>
🎧 I'm interested in <span>journalism,<br/>
🎧 and I quite like the idea of <span>moving to <span>Scandinavia and <span>writing for <span>magazines.<br/>
🎧 I'd find that more <span>creative than <span>translating, which I <span>suppose most <span>graduates do.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Now how are you <span>finding the <span>courses you're taking this <span>term, <span>James?<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm really <span>enjoying the one on <span>Swedish <span>cinema.<br/>
🎧 <span>That'll <span>continue next <span>term,<br/>
🎧 but the one on <span>Scandinavian <span>literature that's <span>running at the <span>moment will be <span>replaced by more <span>specialised <span>courses.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and by the way, if you're interested in watching <span>Danish <span>television <span>programmes <span>-<br/>
🎧 there's going to be a course on that the <span>term after next.<br/>
🎧 That sounds good.<br/>
🎧 Have you <span>started thinking about the <span>literature <span>paper that you have to <span>write in the next few <span>weeks?<br/>
🎧 Yes, my first <span>choice would be to do something on the <span>Icelandic <span>sagas.<br/>
🎧 The <span>trouble with that is that a lot of people choose that <span>topic,<br/>
🎧 and it can be <span>difficult to get <span>hold of the books you'll need.<br/>
🎧 Why not leave that for another time?<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 You might find <span>modern <span>novels or <span>19th <span>century <span>playwrights <span>interesting.<br/>
🎧 I've read or <span>seen <span>several <span>plays in <span>translation, so that would be a good idea.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 I'll put you down for that <span>topic.<br/>
🎧 Right. So what would you <span>advise me to <span>aim at in the <span>paper?<br/>
🎧 First I <span>suggest you <span>avoid taking one <span>writer and going into a great <span>deal of <span>detail.<br/>
🎧 That <span>approach <span>certainly has its place,<br/>
🎧 but I think you first need to get an <span>understanding of the <span>literature in the <span>context of the <span>society in which it was <span>produced <span>-<br/>
🎧 who it was <span>written for, how it was <span>published, and so on.<br/>
🎧 I also think that's more <span>fruitful than <span>placing it <span>within the <span>history of the <span>genre.<br/>
🎧 OK, that sounds <span>reasonable.<br/>
🎧 Could I ask for some advice about <span>writing the <span>paper I'm working on about the <span>Vikings?<br/>
🎧 I have to do that this week, and I'm a bit <span>stuck.<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 Have you <span>decided yet what to <span>write about?<br/>
🎧 No, I haven't.<br/>
🎧 There's so much that <span>seems <span>interesting <span>-<br/>
🎧 <span>Viking <span>settlement in other <span>countries, <span>trade, <span>mythology…<br/>
🎧 Well, what I <span>suggest is that you read an <span>assignment a student <span>wrote last year, which is <span>kept in the <span>library.<br/>
🎧 It's short and well <span>focused, and I'm sure you'll find it <span>helpful.<br/>
🎧 I'll give you the <span>details in a <span>moment.<br/>
🎧 <span>Textbooks usually <span>cover so many <span>topics, it can be very <span>difficult to choose just one.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 I've got a <span>DVD of the <span>film about the <span>Vikings that came out <span>earlier this year.<br/>
🎧 Should I <span>watch that again?<br/>
🎧 If it's the one I am thinking of, <span>hmm, I'd <span>ignore it <span>-<br/>
🎧 it's more <span>fantasy than <span>reality.<br/>
🎧 But I've got a <span>recording of a <span>documentary that you should <span>watch.<br/>
🎧 It makes some <span>interesting and <span>provocative <span>points, which I think will help you to focus your <span>topic.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So then should I work out an <span>outline?<br/>
🎧 Yes. Just <span>headings for different <span>sections, at this <span>stage.<br/>
🎧 And then you should start looking for <span>suitable <span>articles and books to <span>draw on,<br/>
🎧 and take <span>notes which you <span>organise <span>according to those <span>headings.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 Then put short <span>phrases and <span>sentences as <span>bullet <span>points under each <span>heading.<br/>
🎧 Make sure that this <span>skeleton makes <span>sense and <span>flows <span>properly, before <span>writing up the <span>paper in full.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Thanks, that's very <span>helpful.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Over the years, <span>attitudes <span>towards <span>workers have <span>changed <span>considerably.<br/>
🎧 After all, there was a time when <span>workers had no <span>rights at all, and <span>laboured in <span>appalling <span>conditions.<br/>
🎧 <span>Conditions have <span>improved a lot, but <span>conflict in the <span>workplace is still <span>common.<br/>
🎧 And <span>human <span>resources <span>managers <span>nowadays need to be able to <span>deal with it when <span>necessary.<br/>
🎧 What is <span>conflict in the <span>workplace?<br/>
🎧 <span>Definitions <span>vary, but I'm taking it to <span>refer to a whole <span>range of <span>behaviours that the <span>victim <span>finds <span>unacceptable,<br/>
🎧 from <span>minor, <span>harmless <span>arguments to <span>- at the <span>opposite <span>extreme <span>- <span>physical <span>violence.<br/>
🎧 Much of this is <span>covered by the <span>term <span>bullying,<br/>
🎧 by which I mean one or more people <span>behaving <span>abusively or <span>aggressively <span>against another who is in a <span>weaker <span>position.<br/>
🎧 Although all <span>behaviour like this is a <span>form of <span>conflict, not all <span>conflict can be <span>described in these <span>terms.<br/>
🎧 As with all <span>human <span>behaviour, there are <span>numerous <span>reasons for it.<br/>
🎧 But often it's <span>caused by <span>someone who <span>feels the need to show their <span>superiority over <span>someone else,<br/>
🎧 in order to feel that they aren't at the <span>lowest <span>level in a <span>hierarchy or a group of people.<br/>
🎧 In some <span>cases one person <span>simply <span>dislikes the other,<br/>
🎧 on the <span>basis that the <span>personality of one is in some way <span>incompatible with that of the other person.<br/>
🎧 A <span>general <span>habit of <span>optimism in one person could make them <span>intolerant of a <span>colleague who's <span>constantly <span>pessimistic <span>-<br/>
🎧 not that that <span>justifies <span>treating them <span>badly, of course.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>conflicts <span>arise when people are more interested in <span>promoting <span>themselves and their <span>team than in the company as a whole.<br/>
🎧 These <span>conflicts are called <span>'structural',<br/>
🎧 and could come about, for example, when a <span>sales <span>team <span>believe they are the only people in the <span>business who do any useful work,<br/>
🎧 and look down on <span>behind-the-scenes <span>administrators.<br/>
🎧 <span>Conflict <span>obviously <span>affects the <span>individuals <span>concerned <span>-<br/>
🎧 the <span>situation is <span>likely to be very <span>stressful for <span>victims,<br/>
🎧 <span>resulting in their <span>absence from work, <span>possibly for <span>months.<br/>
🎧 For the company, if no <span>effort is made to <span>deal with <span>conflict,<br/>
🎧 it can <span>spiral out of <span>control, and even <span>lead to the <span>breakdown of the <span>business.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>interesting work with <span>chief <span>executives <span>- <span>CEOs <span>-<br/>
🎧 has <span>uncovered some of the <span>reasons why they may <span>treat <span>colleagues <span>badly.<br/>
🎧 Many <span>CEOs <span>combine two <span>opposing <span>characteristics:<br/>
🎧 <span>confidence <span>- that is, the <span>belief that they're <span>capable of great <span>achievements <span>- with a high <span>level of <span>anxiety,<br/>
🎧 a <span>fear of <span>missing <span>targets, <span>whether set by <span>themselves or by the <span>directors of the company.<br/>
🎧 This <span>combination can make them <span>respond <span>badly to <span>anyone who <span>questions their <span>decisions.<br/>
🎧 In a high <span>pressure work <span>environment, such <span>characteristics become <span>problematic.<br/>
🎧 And it's <span>particularly <span>difficult to <span>tackle the <span>situation<br/>
🎧 where <span>colleagues, <span>managers and <span>board <span>members are all trying to <span>achieve their own <span>visions.<br/>
🎧 When they can't agree on <span>strategic issues and on where they see the <span>business going,<br/>
🎧 there are <span>real <span>problems.<br/>
🎧 For <span>managers at <span>lower <span>levels <span>within the <span>organisation,<br/>
🎧 it might <span>seem that an <span>autocratic <span>form of <span>management <span>-<br/>
🎧 where the <span>chief <span>executive <span>gives <span>orders and everyone else has to <span>obey <span>-<br/>
🎧 would see more <span>conflict than <span>others.<br/>
🎧 <span>Interestingly, though, a company with a more <span>democratic <span>business <span>model, can <span>suffer more,<br/>
🎧 when <span>uncertainty about who to <span>report to <span>leads to <span>conflicting <span>demands.<br/>
🎧 Now I'll say a little about <span>dealing with the <span>type of <span>conflict that has <span>harmful <span>effects.<br/>
🎧 Of course the <span>ideal is to <span>prevent it <span>arising in the first place.<br/>
🎧 A good <span>manager, at any <span>level, will make <span>efforts to <span>earn the <span>respect of the people they work with,<br/>
🎧 <span>particularly those who <span>report to them.<br/>
🎧 That will <span>involve <span>politeness in all <span>communications,<br/>
🎧 and <span>treating them as <span>equals who <span>happen to have a different <span>role <span>within the <span>organisation.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes, of course, <span>conflict does <span>occur, and can get out of <span>hand.<br/>
🎧 In such <span>cases the <span>human <span>resources <span>department often <span>gets <span>involved.<br/>
🎧 <span>However, if one of the <span>parties in a <span>conflict <span>sees <span>human <span>resources as <span>simply a <span>mouthpiece for the <span>chief <span>executive,<br/>
🎧 then an <span>external <span>mediator might be able to help.<br/>
🎧 By talking to both <span>sides, and trying to find the <span>truth of what's been <span>happening,<br/>
🎧 they can <span>build a <span>clear <span>picture of the <span>situation,<br/>
🎧 and give <span>feedback that both <span>sides will <span>accept,<br/>
🎧 <span>precisely because they're <span>independent.<br/>
