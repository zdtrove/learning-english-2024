🎧 Good morning, Kenton Festival box office. How can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Oh, good morning.<br/>
🎧 I'm coming to Kenton for a few days' holiday next month,<br/>
🎧 and a friend told me there's a festival.<br/>
🎧 She gave me this number to find out about it.<br/>
🎧 That's right, the festival begins on the 16th of May and goes on till the 19th.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's great.<br/>
🎧 I'll be there from the 15th till the 19th.<br/>
🎧 So could you tell me the programme, please?<br/>
🎧 Well, on the first day, there's the opening ceremony, in the town centre.<br/>
🎧 People start gathering around 2 o'clock, to get a good place to see from,<br/>
🎧 and the events will start at 2.45, and finish about 5.30.<br/>
🎧 OK, thanks. I'll make sure I get there early to get a good spot.<br/>
🎧 The festival will be officially opened by the mayor.<br/>
🎧 He'll just speak for a few minutes, welcoming everyone to the festival.<br/>
🎧 All the town councillors will be there, and of course lots of other people.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Then there'll be a performance by a band.<br/>
🎧 Most years we have a children's choir,<br/>
🎧 but this year the local army cadets offered to perform,<br/>
🎧 and they're very good.<br/>
🎧 After that, a community group from the town will perform a play they've written themselves, just a short one.<br/>
🎧 It's about Helen Tungate.<br/>
🎧 I don't know if you've heard of her?<br/>
🎧 I certainly have.<br/>
🎧 She was a scientist years ago.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 She was born in Kenton exactly 100 years ago,<br/>
🎧 so we're celebrating her centenary.<br/>
🎧 I'm a biologist, so I've always been interested in her,<br/>
🎧 I didn't realise she came from Kenton.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Well, all that will take place in the afternoon,<br/>
🎧 and later, as the sun sets, there'll be a firework display.<br/>
🎧 You should go to the park to watch, as you'll get the best view from there,<br/>
🎧 and the display takes place on the opposite side of the river.<br/>
🎧 It's always one of the most popular events in the festival.<br/>
🎧 Sounds great.<br/>
🎧 And what's happening on the other days?<br/>
🎧 There are several events that go on the whole time.<br/>
🎧 For example, the students of the art college have produced a number of videos,<br/>
🎧 all connected with relationships between children and their grandparents.<br/>
🎧 That sounds interesting.<br/>
🎧 It makes a change from children and parents, doesn't it!<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 Because the art college is in use for classes, throughout the festival,<br/>
🎧 the videos are being shown in Handsworth House.<br/>
🎧 How do you spell the name?<br/>
🎧 H-A-N-D-S-W-O-R-T-H.<br/>
🎧 Handsworth House.<br/>
🎧 It's close to the Town Hall.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Now let me see, what else can I tell you about?<br/>
🎧 Are there any displays of ballet dancing?<br/>
🎧 I'm particularly interested in that as I do it as a hobby.<br/>
🎧 There isn't any ballet, I'm afraid,<br/>
🎧 but there'll be a demonstration of traditional dances from all round the country.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that'd be nice.<br/>
🎧 Where's that being held?<br/>
🎧 It's in the market in the town centre - the outdoor one, not the covered market.<br/>
🎧 And it's on at 2 and 5 every afternoon of the festival, apart from the first day.<br/>
🎧 Lovely.<br/>
🎧 I'm interested in all kinds of dancing, so I'm sure I'll enjoy that!<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you will.<br/>
🎧 And I'd really like to go to some concerts, if there are any.<br/>
🎧 Yes, there are several.<br/>
🎧 Three performed by professionals, and one by local children.<br/>
🎧 And where is it being held?<br/>
🎧 It's in the library, which is in Part Street.<br/>
🎧 On the 18th, at 6.30 in the evening.<br/>
🎧 I presume I'll need tickets for that.<br/>
🎧 Yes, you can book online,<br/>
🎧 or you can buy them when you arrive in Kenton,<br/>
🎧 either at the festival box office, or from any shops displaying our logo in the windows.<br/>
🎧 Well, I think that'll keep me busy for the whole of my stay in Kenton.<br/>
🎧 Thank you so much for all your help.<br/>
🎧 You're welcome. I hope you enjoy your stay.<br/>
🎧 Thank you. Goodbye.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Right. I've now almost succeeded in finalising plans for our tour,<br/>
🎧 so I'll bring you up to date with what I know.<br/>
🎧 As you know, we're flying first to Munich, on Monday the 4th.<br/>
🎧 The flight is at 11.30,<br/>
🎧 so it's too early to have lunch at the airport.<br/>
🎧 I suggest we meet there for coffee at 10,<br/>
🎧 which should give us plenty of time for breakfast before we leave home.<br/>
🎧 When we arrive in Munich, we'll be met at the airport by Claus Bauer.<br/>
🎧 Claus works for a tour operator, and he'll look after us for the time we'll be in Germany.<br/>
🎧 He's already liaised with the managers of the theatres we're going to visit,<br/>
🎧 and he's also arranged for an officer of the National Theatre in Munich<br/>
🎧 to show us round the theatre one afternoon during our stay.<br/>
🎧 Now last time we discussed this trip,<br/>
🎧 I didn't have the precise cost for hotel rooms, but now I have.<br/>
🎧 The normal rate at the hotel where we're staying is 150 euros a night for a double room.<br/>
🎧 I'd hoped to get that down to 120 euros,<br/>
🎧 but in fact I've been able to negotiate a rate of 110.<br/>
🎧 That'll be reflected in the final payment which you'll need to make by the end of this week.<br/>
🎧 On Tuesday, the day after our arrival,<br/>
🎧 I had hoped we could sit in on a rehearsal at one of the theatres,<br/>
🎧 but unfortunately that's proved very difficult to arrange,<br/>
🎧 so instead we'll have a coach trip to one of the amazing castles in the mountains south of Munich.<br/>
🎧 On Tuesday evening, we'll all have dinner together in a restaurant near our hotel.<br/>
🎧 From talking to you all about your preferences,<br/>
🎧 it was clear that a typical local restaurant would be too meat-oriented for some of you.<br/>
🎧 Some of you suggested an Italian restaurant,<br/>
🎧 but I must confess that I decided to book a Lebanese one,<br/>
🎧 as we have plenty of opportunities to go to an Italian restaurant at home.<br/>
🎧 On Wednesday afternoon, the director of the play we're going to see that evening will talk to us at the theatre.<br/>
🎧 She'll describe the whole process of producing a play,<br/>
🎧 including how she chose the actors,<br/>
🎧 and, as the play we're going to see is a modern one, how she worked with the playwright.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Now I'd just like to make a few points about the plays we're going to see,<br/>
🎧 partly because it might influence your choice of clothes to take with you!<br/>
🎧 The play we're seeing on Wednesday evening is a modern one,<br/>
🎧 and we're going to the premiere, so it'll be quite a dressy occasion,<br/>
🎧 though of course you don't have to dress formally.<br/>
🎧 I gather it's rather a multimedia production,<br/>
🎧 with amazing lighting effects and a soundtrack of electronic music,<br/>
🎧 though unfortunately the playwright is ill and is unlikely to be able to attend.<br/>
🎧 On Thursday we're seeing a play that was first performed last year,<br/>
🎧 when it was commissioned to mark a hundred years since the birth in the town of a well-known scientist.<br/>
🎧 We're going to see a revival of that production, which aroused a lot of interest.<br/>
🎧 Friday's play will really make you think hard about what clothes to pack,<br/>
🎧 as it'll be in the garden of a palace.<br/>
🎧 It's a beautiful setting, but I'd better warn you, there won't be much protection from the wind.<br/>
🎧 On Saturday, we're going by coach to a theatre in another town, not far from Munich.<br/>
🎧 This will be the opening of a drama festival,<br/>
🎧 and the mayor and all the other dignitaries of the town will be attending.<br/>
🎧 After the performance, the mayor is hosting a reception for all the audience,<br/>
🎧 and there'll be a band playing traditional music of the region.<br/>
🎧 And after having a day off on Sunday, our final play is on Monday,<br/>
🎧 and it's in the stunning setting of the old Town Hall,<br/>
🎧 which dates back to the 14th century.<br/>
🎧 The performance marks the fifty years that the lead actor has been on stage,<br/>
🎧 and the play is the one where he made his first professional appearance, all those years ago.<br/>
🎧 And the day after that, we'll be flying back home.<br/>
🎧 Now have you got any questions...<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Oh good morning. You must be James.<br/>
🎧 I'm Beth Cartwright - please call me Beth.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Now as this is your first tutorial since you started on the Scandinavian Studies course,<br/>
🎧 I'd like to find out something about you.<br/>
🎧 Why did you decide to take this course?<br/>
🎧 Well, my mother is Danish, and although we always lived in England, she used to talk about her home a lot,<br/>
🎧 and that made me want to visit Denmark.<br/>
🎧 We hardly ever did, though - my mother usually went on her own.<br/>
🎧 But whenever her relations or friends were in England they always came to see us.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 So I assume you already speak Danish, one of the languages you'll be studying.<br/>
🎧 I can get by when I talk to people, though I'm not terribly accurate.<br/>
🎧 Now you probably know that you'll spend the third year of the course abroad.<br/>
🎧 Have you had any thoughts about that?<br/>
🎧 I'm really looking forward to it.<br/>
🎧 And although Denmark seems the obvious place to go, because of my family connections,<br/>
🎧 I'd love to spend the time in Iceland.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I'm sure it can be arranged.<br/>
🎧 Do you have any plans for when you graduate?<br/>
🎧 A lot of students go on to take a master's degree.<br/>
🎧 I think the four years of the undergraduate course will be enough for me.<br/>
🎧 I'm interested in journalism,<br/>
🎧 and I quite like the idea of moving to Scandinavia and writing for magazines.<br/>
🎧 I'd find that more creative than translating, which I suppose most graduates do.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Now how are you finding the courses you're taking this term, James?<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm really enjoying the one on Swedish cinema.<br/>
🎧 That'll continue next term,<br/>
🎧 but the one on Scandinavian literature that's running at the moment will be replaced by more specialised courses.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and by the way, if you're interested in watching Danish television programmes -<br/>
🎧 there's going to be a course on that the term after next.<br/>
🎧 That sounds good.<br/>
🎧 Have you started thinking about the literature paper that you have to write in the next few weeks?<br/>
🎧 Yes, my first choice would be to do something on the Icelandic sagas.<br/>
🎧 The trouble with that is that a lot of people choose that topic,<br/>
🎧 and it can be difficult to get hold of the books you'll need.<br/>
🎧 Why not leave that for another time?<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 You might find modern novels or 19th century playwrights interesting.<br/>
🎧 I've read or seen several plays in translation, so that would be a good idea.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 I'll put you down for that topic.<br/>
🎧 Right. So what would you advise me to aim at in the paper?<br/>
🎧 First I suggest you avoid taking one writer and going into a great deal of detail.<br/>
🎧 That approach certainly has its place,<br/>
🎧 but I think you first need to get an understanding of the literature in the context of the society in which it was produced -<br/>
🎧 who it was written for, how it was published, and so on.<br/>
🎧 I also think that's more fruitful than placing it within the history of the genre.<br/>
🎧 OK, that sounds reasonable.<br/>
🎧 Could I ask for some advice about writing the paper I'm working on about the Vikings?<br/>
🎧 I have to do that this week, and I'm a bit stuck.<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 Have you decided yet what to write about?<br/>
🎧 No, I haven't.<br/>
🎧 There's so much that seems interesting -<br/>
🎧 Viking settlement in other countries, trade, mythology…<br/>
🎧 Well, what I suggest is that you read an assignment a student wrote last year, which is kept in the library.<br/>
🎧 It's short and well focused, and I'm sure you'll find it helpful.<br/>
🎧 I'll give you the details in a moment.<br/>
🎧 Textbooks usually cover so many topics, it can be very difficult to choose just one.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 I've got a DVD of the film about the Vikings that came out earlier this year.<br/>
🎧 Should I watch that again?<br/>
🎧 If it's the one I am thinking of, hmm, I'd ignore it -<br/>
🎧 it's more fantasy than reality.<br/>
🎧 But I've got a recording of a documentary that you should watch.<br/>
🎧 It makes some interesting and provocative points, which I think will help you to focus your topic.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So then should I work out an outline?<br/>
🎧 Yes. Just headings for different sections, at this stage.<br/>
🎧 And then you should start looking for suitable articles and books to draw on,<br/>
🎧 and take notes which you organise according to those headings.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 Then put short phrases and sentences as bullet points under each heading.<br/>
🎧 Make sure that this skeleton makes sense and flows properly, before writing up the paper in full.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Thanks, that's very helpful.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Over the years, attitudes towards workers have changed considerably.<br/>
🎧 After all, there was a time when workers had no rights at all, and laboured in appalling conditions.<br/>
🎧 Conditions have improved a lot, but conflict in the workplace is still common.<br/>
🎧 And human resources managers nowadays need to be able to deal with it when necessary.<br/>
🎧 What is conflict in the workplace?<br/>
🎧 Definitions vary, but I'm taking it to refer to a whole range of behaviours that the victim finds unacceptable,<br/>
🎧 from minor, harmless arguments to - at the opposite extreme - physical violence.<br/>
🎧 Much of this is covered by the term bullying,<br/>
🎧 by which I mean one or more people behaving abusively or aggressively against another who is in a weaker position.<br/>
🎧 Although all behaviour like this is a form of conflict, not all conflict can be described in these terms.<br/>
🎧 As with all human behaviour, there are numerous reasons for it.<br/>
🎧 But often it's caused by someone who feels the need to show their superiority over someone else,<br/>
🎧 in order to feel that they aren't at the lowest level in a hierarchy or a group of people.<br/>
🎧 In some cases one person simply dislikes the other,<br/>
🎧 on the basis that the personality of one is in some way incompatible with that of the other person.<br/>
🎧 A general habit of optimism in one person could make them intolerant of a colleague who's constantly pessimistic -<br/>
🎧 not that that justifies treating them badly, of course.<br/>
🎧 Some conflicts arise when people are more interested in promoting themselves and their team than in the company as a whole.<br/>
🎧 These conflicts are called 'structural',<br/>
🎧 and could come about, for example, when a sales team believe they are the only people in the business who do any useful work,<br/>
🎧 and look down on behind-the-scenes administrators.<br/>
🎧 Conflict obviously affects the individuals concerned -<br/>
🎧 the situation is likely to be very stressful for victims,<br/>
🎧 resulting in their absence from work, possibly for months.<br/>
🎧 For the company, if no effort is made to deal with conflict,<br/>
🎧 it can spiral out of control, and even lead to the breakdown of the business.<br/>
🎧 Some interesting work with chief executives - CEOs -<br/>
🎧 has uncovered some of the reasons why they may treat colleagues badly.<br/>
🎧 Many CEOs combine two opposing characteristics:<br/>
🎧 confidence - that is, the belief that they're capable of great achievements - with a high level of anxiety,<br/>
🎧 a fear of missing targets, whether set by themselves or by the directors of the company.<br/>
🎧 This combination can make them respond badly to anyone who questions their decisions.<br/>
🎧 In a high pressure work environment, such characteristics become problematic.<br/>
🎧 And it's particularly difficult to tackle the situation<br/>
🎧 where colleagues, managers and board members are all trying to achieve their own visions.<br/>
🎧 When they can't agree on strategic issues and on where they see the business going,<br/>
🎧 there are real problems.<br/>
🎧 For managers at lower levels within the organisation,<br/>
🎧 it might seem that an autocratic form of management -<br/>
🎧 where the chief executive gives orders and everyone else has to obey -<br/>
🎧 would see more conflict than others.<br/>
🎧 Interestingly, though, a company with a more democratic business model, can suffer more,<br/>
🎧 when uncertainty about who to report to leads to conflicting demands.<br/>
🎧 Now I'll say a little about dealing with the type of conflict that has harmful effects.<br/>
🎧 Of course the ideal is to prevent it arising in the first place.<br/>
🎧 A good manager, at any level, will make efforts to earn the respect of the people they work with,<br/>
🎧 particularly those who report to them.<br/>
🎧 That will involve politeness in all communications,<br/>
🎧 and treating them as equals who happen to have a different role within the organisation.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes, of course, conflict does occur, and can get out of hand.<br/>
🎧 In such cases the human resources department often gets involved.<br/>
🎧 However, if one of the parties in a conflict sees human resources as simply a mouthpiece for the chief executive,<br/>
🎧 then an external mediator might be able to help.<br/>
🎧 By talking to both sides, and trying to find the truth of what's been happening,<br/>
🎧 they can build a clear picture of the situation,<br/>
🎧 and give feedback that both sides will accept,<br/>
🎧 precisely because they're independent.<br/>
<br/><br/>
