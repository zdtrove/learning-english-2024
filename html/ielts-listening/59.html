🎧 Jack</span>, I'm thinking of taking the kids</span> to the seaside</span> on a surfing</span> holiday</span> this summer<br/></span>
🎧 and I wanted to ask your advice<br/></span>
🎧 as I know you're such an expert</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, I don't know about that,<br/>
🎧 but yes, I've done a bit of surfing</span> over the years.<br/>
🎧 I'd thoroughly</span> recommend</span> it.<br/>
🎧 I think it's the kind of holiday</span> all the family</span> can enjoy together.<br/>
🎧 The thing about surfing</span> is that it's great for all ages</span> and all abilities</span>.<br/>
🎧 My youngest</span> started</span> when he was only three</span>!<br/>
🎧 Wow!<br/>
🎧 But it's quite physically</span> demanding</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 I've heard you need to be pretty</span> fit.<br/>
🎧 Yes. You'll certainly</span> learn more quickly and won't tire</span> as easily</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well -</span> that should be OK for us.<br/>
🎧 You've been surfing</span> a few times</span> in Ireland</span>, haven't you?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 There's some great surfing</span> there, which people don't always realise</span>.<br/>
🎧 And which locations</span> would you recommend</span>?<br/>
🎧 There seem</span> to be quite a few.<br/>
🎧 Yes, there are loads</span>.<br/>
🎧 Last year we went to County</span> Donegal</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are several</span> great places</span> to surf</span> there.<br/>
🎧 What about in County</span> Clare</span>?<br/>
🎧 I read that's also really good for surfing</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it is.<br/>
🎧 I've been there a few times</span>.<br/>
🎧 Most people go to Lahinch</span>.<br/>
🎧 My kids</span> love it there.<br/>
🎧 The waves</span> aren't too challenging</span> and the town</span> is very lively</span>.<br/>
🎧 Are there good hotels</span> there?<br/>
🎧 Yes -</span> some very nice ones<br/></span>
🎧 and there are also a few basic</span> hostels</span> and campsites</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's great if you need lessons</span> as the surf</span> schools</span> are excellent</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sounds good.<br/>
🎧 Yes and there's lots to see in the area</span>,<br/>
🎧 like those well-known</span> cliffs..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've forgotten</span> the name of them..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh don't worry</span> -</span> I can look them up.<br/>
🎧 I've also been surfing</span> in County</span> Mayo</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is less well-known</span> for surfing</span>, but we had a really good time.<br/>
🎧 That was a few years ago when the kids</span> were younger</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's a good surf</span> school at Carrowniskey</span> beach</span>.<br/>
🎧 How do you spell</span> that?<br/>
🎧 Carrowniskey<br/></span>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 I put the kids</span> into the surf</span> camp</span> they run during the summer</span> for 10-16</span> year olds<br/></span>
🎧 Oh right.<br/>
🎧 How long was that for?<br/>
🎧 Three</span> hours every day for a week.<br/>
🎧 It was perfect.<br/>
🎧 They were so tired</span> out after that.<br/>
🎧 I can imagine</span>.<br/>
🎧 One thing we did while the kids</span> were surfing<br/></span>
🎧 was to rent</span> some kayaks</span> to have a look around the bay</span> which is nearby</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's really beautiful</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I'd love to do that.<br/>
🎧 Now the only time I went to Ireland</span> it rained</span> practically</span> every day.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that can be a problem</span>,<br/>
🎧 but you can surf</span> in the rain</span>, you know.<br/>
🎧 It doesn't have the same appeal</span>, somehow</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, the weather's</span> been fine the last couple</span> of years when I've been there,<br/>
🎧 but actually, it tends</span> to rain</span> more in August</span> than in the spring</span> or autumn</span>.<br/>
🎧 September's</span> my favourite</span> month because the water is warmer</span> then.<br/>
🎧 The only problem</span> is that the kids</span> are back to school then.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 But one good thing about Irish</span> summers</span> is that it doesn't get too hot.<br/>
🎧 The average</span> temperature</span> is about 19</span> degrees<br/></span>
🎧 and it usually doesn't go above</span> 25</span> degrees</span>.<br/>
🎧 That sounds alright.<br/>
🎧 Now what about costs</span>?<br/>
🎧 Surfing</span> is a pretty</span> cheap</span> holiday</span> really,<br/>
🎧 the only cost</span> is the hire</span> of equipment</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can expect</span> to pay a daily</span> rate</span> of about 30</span> euros</span> for the hire</span> of a wetsuit</span> and board</span>,<br/>
🎧 but you can save</span> about 40</span> euros</span> if you hire</span> by the week.<br/>
🎧 That's not too bad.<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 It's important to make sure you get good quality</span> wetsuits</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll all get too cold</span> if you don't.<br/>
🎧 And make sure you also get boots</span>.<br/>
🎧 They keep your feet</span> warm</span> and it's easier</span> to surf</span> with them on too.<br/>
🎧 OK. Well, thanks very much..</span>.<br/>

🎧 Good afternoon</span>.<br/>
🎧 My name's</span> Mrs</span> Carter<br/></span>
🎧 and I run the before and after school extended</span> hours childcare</span> service</span>.<br/>
🎧 I hope you've had a chance</span> to have a good look around the school and talk to staff</span> and pupils</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know that many of you are interested in using</span> our childcare</span> service<br/></span>
🎧 when your child</span> joins</span> the school,<br/>
🎧 and perhaps</span> you already know something about it,<br/>
🎧 but for those that don't, I'll go through the main</span> details</span> now.<br/>
🎧 We offer</span> childcare</span> for children from the ages</span> of four</span> to eleven<br/></span>
🎧 both before and after school.<br/>
🎧 I know that many parents</span> who work find this service</span> invaluable</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can leave your child</span> with us safe</span> in the knowledge</span> that they will be extremely</span> well cared</span> for.<br/>
🎧 We are insured</span> to provide</span> care</span> for up to 70</span> children,<br/>
🎧 although we rarely</span> have this many attending</span> at any one session</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think we generally</span> expect</span> around 50</span> to 60</span> children for the afternoon</span> sessions<br/></span>
🎧 and about half</span> that number for the breakfast</span> sessions</span>.<br/>
🎧 Although we currently</span> do have 70</span> children registered</span> with us,<br/>
🎧 not all of these attend</span> every day.<br/>
🎧 It's ten years since we began</span> offering</span> an extended</span> hours service<br/></span>
🎧 and we've come a long way during that time.<br/>
🎧 When we first opened</span>, we only had about 20</span> children attending</span> regularly</span>.<br/>
🎧 We try to keep our costs</span> as low as we can<br/></span>
🎧 and we think we provide</span> very good value</span> for money.<br/>
🎧 For the afternoon</span> sessions</span>, which run from 3:30</span> until 6</span> p.m.</span>,<br/>
🎧 it's £7.20</span>.<br/>
🎧 But if you prefer</span>, you can pay for one hour</span> only,<br/>
🎧 which costs</span> £3.50<br/></span>
🎧 or two hours which costs</span> £5.70</span>.<br/>
🎧 The cost</span> of the childcare</span> includes</span> food and snacks</span>.<br/>
🎧 They'll be given</span> breakfast</span> in the morning<br/></span>
🎧 and in the afternoon</span>, a healthy</span> snack</span> as soon as they finish</span> school.<br/>
🎧 At 5</span> p.m</span>. children are given</span> something more substantial</span>,<br/>
🎧 such as pasta</span> or a casserole</span>.<br/>
🎧 Please inform</span> us of any allergies</span> that your child</span> might have<br/></span>
🎧 and we'll make sure they're offered</span> a suitable</span> alternative</span>.<br/>
🎧 As you may know,<br/>
🎧 the childcare</span> service</span> runs</span> through the school holidays</span> from 8</span> a.m</span>. to 6</span> p.m</span>.<br/>
🎧 We offer</span> a really varied</span> and exciting</span> programme</span> to keep the children entertained</span>,<br/>
🎧 we don't want them to feel as if they are still at school!<br/>
🎧 It will also feel different<br/></span>
🎧 because they'll get the chance</span> to make new friends with children from other schools</span>.<br/>
🎧 Spaces</span> are available</span> for them<br/></span>
🎧 because a lot of our term-time</span> children don't always attend</span> during the holiday</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the past</span>,<br/>
🎧 parents</span> have asked</span> if children over the age of 11</span> are allowed</span> to come with their younger</span> brothers</span> and sisters</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I'm afraid</span> we're unable</span> to do this<br/></span>
🎧 because of the type</span> of insurance</span> we have.<br/>
🎧 So now let me tell you about some of the activities</span> that your child</span> can do during the after-school</span> sessions</span>.<br/>
🎧 As well as being able to use the playground</span> equipment</span>, computers</span> and the library</span>,<br/>
🎧 there is usually at least</span> one 'special'</span> activity</span> that children can do each day.<br/>
🎧 For example, Spanish</span>.<br/>
🎧 We have a specialist</span> teacher</span> coming</span> in every Thursday<br/></span>
🎧 to give a basic</span> introduction</span> to the language</span> through games</span> and songs</span>.<br/>
🎧 She does two sessions</span>:<br/>
🎧 one for the over 8s</span> and one for the younger</span> children.<br/>
🎧 This is the only activity</span> which we have to make an extra</span> charge</span> for<br/></span>
🎧 but it's well worth</span> it.<br/>
🎧 Once a week the children have the opportunity</span> to do some music.<br/>
🎧 We're very lucky</span> that one of our staff</span> is a member</span> of a folk</span> band</span>.<br/>
🎧 On Mondays</span>, she teaches</span> singing</span> and percussion</span> to groups</span> of children.<br/>
🎧 We do rely</span> on parental</span> support</span> for this,<br/>
🎧 so if any of you sing</span> or play an instrument<br/></span>
🎧 and would be prepared</span> to help out at these sessions</span>, we'd be delighted</span>.<br/>
🎧 Painting</span> continues</span> to be one of the most popular</span> activities</span>.<br/>
🎧 To begin</span> with we weren't keen</span> on offering</span> this because of the extra</span> mess</span> involved</span>,<br/>
🎧 but children kept</span> asking</span> if they could do some art<br/></span>
🎧 and so we finally gave in.<br/>
🎧 Art</span> is great for helping</span> the children to relax</span> after working hard</span> at school all day.<br/>
🎧 Yoga</span> is something that we've been meaning</span> to introduce</span> for some time<br/></span>
🎧 but haven't been able to find anyone</span> available</span> to teach</span> it,<br/>
🎧 until now that is.<br/>
🎧 So we'll see how this goes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hopefully</span>, children will benefit</span> in all sorts</span> of ways</span> from this.<br/>
🎧 Cooking is another popular</span> activity</span>.<br/>
🎧 They make a different sort</span> of cake</span>, or pizza</span> or bread</span> each week.<br/>
🎧 Although the younger</span> children love doing it,<br/>
🎧 we found</span> that the mess</span> was just too much,<br/>
🎧 so we've decided</span> to restrict</span> this to the over 8s</span>,<br/>
🎧 as they are better able to clean</span> up after themselves</span>.<br/>

🎧 Hello Dr</span> Green</span>,<br/>
🎧 I'm here to talk to you about my work placement</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, it's Holly</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 So, which work placement</span> have you chosen</span>?<br/>
🎧 I decided</span> to go for the Orion</span> Stadium</span> placement</span>.<br/>
🎧 The event</span> I'll be managing</span> is one where I'm helping</span> to set up a sports</span> competition</span> for primary</span> school children.<br/>
🎧 Yup</span>. That's always a popular</span> placement</span>,<br/>
🎧 even though it can be tougher</span> than you think working with children.<br/>
🎧 I know, but it's the fresh</span> air that attracts</span> me,<br/>
🎧 organising</span> something indoors</span> doesn't have the same appeal</span>,<br/>
🎧 even though it might be fun.<br/>
🎧 OK, so obviously</span> safety's</span> going to be one of your key concerns</span> for this event</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I've already thought about that.<br/>
🎧 I'll need to make sure none</span> of the equipment's</span> damaged</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ah well, you'll be working with schools</span>, so the equipment</span> will be their responsibility</span>.<br/>
🎧 However</span>, the grounds</span> and what goes</span> on there will be yours</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh I see,<br/>
🎧 that'll</span> include</span> keeping</span> everyone within</span> the boundary</span> once they're in their kit</span> and on the field</span>?<br/>
🎧 Exactly,<br/>
🎧 you'll need to inspect</span> areas</span> like changing</span> rooms</span> as well for anything someone</span> can trip</span> over,<br/>
🎧 but your main</span> priority</span> will be not to lose</span> anyone</span>!<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I'll need staff</span> to help with that.<br/>
🎧 And don't forget</span> about the spectators</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was thinking that many of them will be parents</span>, who could help run the event</span>.<br/>
🎧 I wouldn't rely</span> on that.<br/>
🎧 They'll be more interested in filming</span> their children than volunteering</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll need to make sure they don't interfere</span> with events</span> doing that!<br/>
🎧 And that's not always easy,<br/>
🎧 especially</span> when a proud</span> parent's</span> trying to get a snap</span> of their child<br/></span>
🎧 and you want them to move elsewhere</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 What about the scheduling</span>?<br/>
🎧 With sporting</span> events</span> there are all sorts</span> of things that can alter</span> the timetable</span>,<br/>
🎧 like rain</span>, for instance</span>, though so far</span>, we've always been lucky</span> with that.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, and I was thinking about what to do if someone</span> got hurt</span> as well.<br/>
🎧 I know that last year that caused</span> a terrible</span> delay</span>.<br/>
🎧 You have to be prepared</span> for such things.<br/>
🎧 Oh. What if a match</span> ends</span> in a draw</span>,<br/>
🎧 do you let the teams</span> keep going until someone</span> wins</span>?<br/>
🎧 That'll</span> be up to you,<br/>
🎧 and again, you need to plan for it.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Now, the aim</span> of your work placement</span> is to give you the opportunity</span> to develop</span> the skills</span> that an events</span> manager</span> needs.<br/>
🎧 So, let's talk about those a bit.<br/>
🎧 Well, I think my communication</span> skills</span> are pretty</span> good.<br/>
🎧 I can talk on the phone to people and book venues</span> and that kind of thing.<br/>
🎧 Good, just remember it isn't only about what you say.<br/>
🎧 If you meet someone</span> face-to-face</span> and want to persuade</span> them to be a sponsor</span>, for example…<br/></span>
🎧 Oh, I'll dress</span> up for that! Sure.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 Let's go on to think about your organisational</span> skills</span>.<br/>
🎧 You're working in a very people-based</span> industry<br/></span>
🎧 and that means</span> things won't always go to plan.<br/>
🎧 I guess</span> it's being prepared</span> to make changes that matters</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 You may have to make an on-the-spot</span> change to a timetable</span> because of a problem</span> you hadn't anticipated..</span>.<br/>
🎧 ...just</span> do it! OK<br/></span>
🎧 How's your time management</span> these days</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm working on it,<br/>
🎧 I'm certainly</span> better when I have a deadline</span>, which is why this work suits</span> me.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but it's how you respond</span> as that deadline</span> approaches</span>!<br/>
🎧 I know I've got to look calm</span> even if I'm in a panic</span>.<br/>
🎧 Just think to yourself,<br/>
🎧 no one must know I'm under pressure</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, even though I'm multi-tasking</span> like crazy</span>!<br/>
🎧 Another skill</span> that events</span> managers</span> need is creativity</span>.<br/>
🎧 Often your client</span> has what we call the 'big</span> picture'</span> idea,<br/>
🎧 but it's up to the events</span> manager</span> to think of all the fine points</span> that go to making</span> it work.<br/>
🎧 Right, so I need to listen carefully</span> to that idea and then fill</span> in all the gaps</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 And you'll have a team</span> working under you,<br/>
🎧 so another key skill</span> is leadership</span>.<br/>
🎧 Your team</span> may have lots of ideas</span> too,<br/>
🎧 but you've got to make the ultimate</span> choices</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do we have refreshments</span> inside or out, for example?<br/>
🎧 Isn't it better to be democratic</span>?<br/>
🎧 It's a nice idea, but you have the ultimate</span> responsibility</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, believe</span> in what you think best.<br/>
🎧 Be prepared</span> to say 'yes'</span>, that's a good idea but it won't work here.<br/>
🎧 I see what you mean.<br/>
🎧 What about the networking</span> side of things?<br/>
🎧 I know it's an area</span> that a lot of students worry</span> about<br/></span>
🎧 because we don't have much experience</span> to offer</span> others</span>.<br/>
🎧 But even without it, you can still be an interesting</span> person with useful</span> ideas</span>.<br/>
🎧 And the more people you impress</span>, the better.<br/>
🎧 I guess</span> that will help me when I apply</span> for a real</span> job</span>.<br/>
🎧 Exactly, think ahead, remember what your ambitions</span> are and keep them in mind</span>.<br/>
🎧 Definitely.<br/>

🎧 Scientists</span> believe</span> that a majority</span> of the earth's</span> bird</span> population</span> migrate</span> in some fashion</span> or other.<br/>
🎧 Some travel seasonally</span> for relatively</span> short distances</span>,<br/>
🎧 such as birds</span> that move from their winter</span> habitats</span> in lowlands</span> to mountain</span> tops</span> for the summers</span>.<br/>
🎧 Others</span>, like the Arctic</span> Tern</span>,<br/>
🎧 travel more than 25,000</span> miles</span> seasonally</span> between the northern</span> and southern</span> poles</span>.<br/>
🎧 Bird</span> migration</span> has been studied</span> over many centuries</span> through a variety</span> of observations</span>.<br/>
🎧 But until relatively</span> recently</span>,<br/>
🎧 where birds</span> went to in the winter</span> was considered</span> something of a mystery</span>.<br/>
🎧 The lack</span> of modern</span> science</span> and technology</span> led</span> to many theories</span> that we now recognize</span> as error-filled<br/></span>
🎧 and even somewhat</span> amusing</span>.<br/>
🎧 Take hibernation</span> theory</span> for example,<br/>
🎧 2000</span> years ago, it was commonly</span> believed</span> that when birds</span> left</span> an area</span>,<br/>
🎧 they went underwater</span> to hibernate</span> in the seas</span> and oceans</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another theory</span> for the regular</span> appearance</span> and disappearance</span> of birds<br/></span>
🎧 was that they spend</span> winter</span> hidden</span> in mud</span> till</span> the weather</span> changed</span> and food became</span> abundant</span> again.<br/>
🎧 The theory</span> that some birds</span> hibernate</span> persisted</span> until experiments</span> were done on caged</span> birds</span> in the 1940s<br/></span>
🎧 which demonstrated</span> that birds</span> have no hibernation</span> instinct</span>.<br/>
🎧 One of the earliest</span> naturalists</span> and philosophers</span> from ancient</span> Greece</span> was Aristotle<br/></span>
🎧 who was the first writer</span> to discuss</span> the disappearance</span> and reappearance</span> of some bird</span> species</span> at certain</span> times</span> of year.<br/>
🎧 He developed</span> the theory</span> of transmutation</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 the seasonal</span> change of one species</span> into another -<br/></span>
🎧 by observing</span> redstarts</span> and robins</span>.<br/>
🎧 He observed</span> that in the autumn</span>,<br/>
🎧 small birds</span> called 'redstarts'</span> began</span> to lose</span> their feathers</span>,<br/>
🎧 which convinced</span> Aristotle</span> that they changed</span> into robins</span> for the winter</span>,<br/>
🎧 and back into redstarts</span> in the summer</span>.<br/>
🎧 These assumptions</span> are understandable</span> given</span> that this pair</span> of species</span> are similar</span> in shape</span>,<br/>
🎧 but are a classic</span> example of an incorrect</span> interpretation</span> based</span> on correct</span> observations</span>.<br/>
🎧 The most bizarre</span> theory</span> was put forward by an English amateur</span> scientist</span>,<br/>
🎧 Charles</span> Morton</span>, in the seventeenth</span> century</span>.<br/>
🎧 He wrote</span> a surprisingly</span> well-regarded</span> paper<br/></span>
🎧 claiming</span> that birds</span> migrate</span> to the moon</span> and back every year.<br/>
🎧 He came to this conclusion</span> as the only logical</span> explanation</span> for the total</span> disappearance</span> of some species</span>.<br/>
🎧 One of the key moments</span> in the development</span> of migration</span> theory</span> came in 1822<br/></span>
🎧 when a white</span> stork</span> was shot</span> in Germany</span>.<br/>
🎧 This particular</span> stork</span> made history</span> because of the long spear</span> in its neck<br/></span>
🎧 which incredibly</span> had not killed</span> it,<br/>
🎧 everyone immediately</span> realised</span> this spear</span> was definitely not European</span>.<br/>
🎧 It turned</span> out to be a spear</span> from a tribe</span> in Central</span> Africa</span>.<br/>
🎧 This was a truly</span> defining</span> moment</span> in the history</span> of ornithology<br/></span>
🎧 because it was the first evidence</span> that storks</span> spend</span> their winters</span> in sub-Saharan</span> Africa</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can still see the 'arrow</span> stork'</span> in the Zoological</span> Collection</span> of the University of Rostock</span> in Germany</span>.<br/>
🎧 People gradually</span> became</span> aware</span> that European</span> birds</span> moved</span> south</span> in autumn</span> and north</span> in summer<br/></span>
🎧 but didn't know much about it until the practice of catching</span> birds</span> and putting</span> rings</span> on their legs</span> became</span> established</span>.<br/>
🎧 Before this, very little information</span> was available</span> about the actual</span> destinations</span> of particular</span> species<br/></span>
🎧 and how they travelled</span> there.<br/>
🎧 People speculated</span> that larger</span> birds</span> provided</span> a kind of taxi</span> service</span> for smaller</span> birds<br/></span>
🎧 by carrying</span> them on their backs</span>.<br/>
🎧 This idea came about<br/></span>
🎧 because it seemed</span> impossible</span> that small birds</span> weighing</span> only a few grams</span> could fly over vast</span> oceans</span>.<br/>
🎧 This idea was supported</span> by observations</span> of bird</span> behaviour<br/></span>
🎧 such as the harassment</span> of larger</span> birds</span> by smaller</span> birds</span>.<br/>
🎧 The development</span> of bird</span> ringing</span>, by a Danish</span> schoolteacher</span>,<br/>
🎧 Hans</span> Christian</span> Cornelius</span> Mortensen</span>,<br/>
🎧 made many discoveries</span> possible</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is still common</span> practice today and relies</span> upon</span> what is known</span> as 'recovery'</span>,<br/>
🎧 this is when ringed</span> birds</span> are found</span> dead</span> in the place they have migrated</span> to, and identified</span>.<br/>
🎧 Huge</span> amounts</span> of data</span> were gathered</span> in the early</span> part</span> of the twentieth</span> century<br/></span>
🎧 and for the first time in history</span> people understood</span> where birds</span> actually went to in winter</span>.<br/>
🎧 In 1931</span>, an atlas</span> was published</span> showing</span> where the most common</span> species</span> of European</span> birds</span> migrated</span> to.<br/>
