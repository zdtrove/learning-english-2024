🎧 <span>Jack</span>, I'm thinking of taking the <span>kids</span> to the <span>seaside</span> on a <span>surfing</span> <span>holiday</span> this <span>summer<br/></span>
🎧 and I wanted to ask your <span>advice<br/></span>
🎧 as I know you're such an <span>expert</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, I don't know about that,<br/>
🎧 but yes, I've done a bit of <span>surfing</span> over the years.<br/>
🎧 I'd <span>thoroughly</span> <span>recommend</span> it.<br/>
🎧 I think it's the kind of <span>holiday</span> all the <span>family</span> can enjoy together.<br/>
🎧 The thing about <span>surfing</span> is that it's great for all <span>ages</span> and all <span>abilities</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>youngest</span> <span>started</span> when he was only <span>three</span>!<br/>
🎧 Wow!<br/>
🎧 But it's quite <span>physically</span> <span>demanding</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 I've heard you need to be <span>pretty</span> fit.<br/>
🎧 Yes. You'll <span>certainly</span> learn more quickly and won't <span>tire</span> as <span>easily</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well <span>-</span> that should be OK for us.<br/>
🎧 You've been <span>surfing</span> a few <span>times</span> in <span>Ireland</span>, haven't you?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 There's some great <span>surfing</span> there, which people don't always <span>realise</span>.<br/>
🎧 And which <span>locations</span> would you <span>recommend</span>?<br/>
🎧 There <span>seem</span> to be quite a few.<br/>
🎧 Yes, there are <span>loads</span>.<br/>
🎧 Last year we went to <span>County</span> <span>Donegal</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>several</span> great <span>places</span> to <span>surf</span> there.<br/>
🎧 What about in <span>County</span> <span>Clare</span>?<br/>
🎧 I read that's also really good for <span>surfing</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it is.<br/>
🎧 I've been there a few <span>times</span>.<br/>
🎧 Most people go to <span>Lahinch</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>kids</span> love it there.<br/>
🎧 The <span>waves</span> aren't too <span>challenging</span> and the <span>town</span> is very <span>lively</span>.<br/>
🎧 Are there good <span>hotels</span> there?<br/>
🎧 Yes <span>-</span> some very nice <span>ones<br/></span>
🎧 and there are also a few <span>basic</span> <span>hostels</span> and <span>campsites</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's great if you need <span>lessons</span> as the <span>surf</span> <span>schools</span> are <span>excellent</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sounds good.<br/>
🎧 Yes and there's lots to see in the <span>area</span>,<br/>
🎧 like those <span>well-known</span> <span>cliffs..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've <span>forgotten</span> the name of <span>them..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh don't <span>worry</span> <span>-</span> I can look them up.<br/>
🎧 I've also been <span>surfing</span> in <span>County</span> <span>Mayo</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is less <span>well-known</span> for <span>surfing</span>, but we had a really good time.<br/>
🎧 That was a few years ago when the <span>kids</span> were <span>younger</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's a good <span>surf</span> school at <span>Carrowniskey</span> <span>beach</span>.<br/>
🎧 How do you <span>spell</span> that?<br/>
🎧 <span>Carrowniskey<br/></span>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 I put the <span>kids</span> into the <span>surf</span> <span>camp</span> they run during the <span>summer</span> for <span>10-16</span> year <span>olds<br/></span>
🎧 Oh right.<br/>
🎧 How long was that for?<br/>
🎧 <span>Three</span> hours every day for a week.<br/>
🎧 It was perfect.<br/>
🎧 They were so <span>tired</span> out after that.<br/>
🎧 I can <span>imagine</span>.<br/>
🎧 One thing we did while the <span>kids</span> were <span>surfing<br/></span>
🎧 was to <span>rent</span> some <span>kayaks</span> to have a look around the <span>bay</span> which is <span>nearby</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's really <span>beautiful</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I'd love to do that.<br/>
🎧 Now the only time I went to <span>Ireland</span> it <span>rained</span> <span>practically</span> every day.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that can be a <span>problem</span>,<br/>
🎧 but you can <span>surf</span> in the <span>rain</span>, you know.<br/>
🎧 It doesn't have the same <span>appeal</span>, <span>somehow</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, the <span>weather's</span> been fine the last <span>couple</span> of years when I've been there,<br/>
🎧 but actually, it <span>tends</span> to <span>rain</span> more in <span>August</span> than in the <span>spring</span> or <span>autumn</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>September's</span> my <span>favourite</span> month because the water is <span>warmer</span> then.<br/>
🎧 The only <span>problem</span> is that the <span>kids</span> are back to school then.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 But one good thing about <span>Irish</span> <span>summers</span> is that it doesn't get too hot.<br/>
🎧 The <span>average</span> <span>temperature</span> is about <span>19</span> <span>degrees<br/></span>
🎧 and it usually doesn't go <span>above</span> <span>25</span> <span>degrees</span>.<br/>
🎧 That sounds alright.<br/>
🎧 Now what about <span>costs</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Surfing</span> is a <span>pretty</span> <span>cheap</span> <span>holiday</span> really,<br/>
🎧 the only <span>cost</span> is the <span>hire</span> of <span>equipment</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can <span>expect</span> to pay a <span>daily</span> <span>rate</span> of about <span>30</span> <span>euros</span> for the <span>hire</span> of a <span>wetsuit</span> and <span>board</span>,<br/>
🎧 but you can <span>save</span> about <span>40</span> <span>euros</span> if you <span>hire</span> by the week.<br/>
🎧 That's not too bad.<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 It's important to make sure you get good <span>quality</span> <span>wetsuits</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll all get too <span>cold</span> if you don't.<br/>
🎧 And make sure you also get <span>boots</span>.<br/>
🎧 They keep your <span>feet</span> <span>warm</span> and it's <span>easier</span> to <span>surf</span> with them on too.<br/>
🎧 OK. Well, thanks very <span>much..</span>.<br/>

🎧 Good <span>afternoon</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>name's</span> <span>Mrs</span> <span>Carter<br/></span>
🎧 and I run the before and after school <span>extended</span> hours <span>childcare</span> <span>service</span>.<br/>
🎧 I hope you've had a <span>chance</span> to have a good look around the school and talk to <span>staff</span> and <span>pupils</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know that many of you are interested in <span>using</span> our <span>childcare</span> <span>service<br/></span>
🎧 when your <span>child</span> <span>joins</span> the school,<br/>
🎧 and <span>perhaps</span> you already know something about it,<br/>
🎧 but for those that don't, I'll go through the <span>main</span> <span>details</span> now.<br/>
🎧 We <span>offer</span> <span>childcare</span> for children from the <span>ages</span> of <span>four</span> to <span>eleven<br/></span>
🎧 both before and after school.<br/>
🎧 I know that many <span>parents</span> who work find this <span>service</span> <span>invaluable</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can leave your <span>child</span> with us <span>safe</span> in the <span>knowledge</span> that they will be <span>extremely</span> well <span>cared</span> for.<br/>
🎧 We are <span>insured</span> to <span>provide</span> <span>care</span> for up to <span>70</span> children,<br/>
🎧 although we <span>rarely</span> have this many <span>attending</span> at any one <span>session</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think we <span>generally</span> <span>expect</span> around <span>50</span> to <span>60</span> children for the <span>afternoon</span> <span>sessions<br/></span>
🎧 and about <span>half</span> that number for the <span>breakfast</span> <span>sessions</span>.<br/>
🎧 Although we <span>currently</span> do have <span>70</span> children <span>registered</span> with us,<br/>
🎧 not all of these <span>attend</span> every day.<br/>
🎧 It's ten years since we <span>began</span> <span>offering</span> an <span>extended</span> hours <span>service<br/></span>
🎧 and we've come a long way during that time.<br/>
🎧 When we first <span>opened</span>, we only had about <span>20</span> children <span>attending</span> <span>regularly</span>.<br/>
🎧 We try to keep our <span>costs</span> as low as we <span>can<br/></span>
🎧 and we think we <span>provide</span> very good <span>value</span> for money.<br/>
🎧 For the <span>afternoon</span> <span>sessions</span>, which run from <span>3:30</span> until <span>6</span> <span>p.m.</span>,<br/>
🎧 it's <span>£7.20</span>.<br/>
🎧 But if you <span>prefer</span>, you can pay for one <span>hour</span> only,<br/>
🎧 which <span>costs</span> <span>£3.50<br/></span>
🎧 or two hours which <span>costs</span> <span>£5.70</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>cost</span> of the <span>childcare</span> <span>includes</span> food and <span>snacks</span>.<br/>
🎧 They'll be <span>given</span> <span>breakfast</span> in the <span>morning<br/></span>
🎧 and in the <span>afternoon</span>, a <span>healthy</span> <span>snack</span> as soon as they <span>finish</span> school.<br/>
🎧 At <span>5</span> <span>p.m</span>. children are <span>given</span> something more <span>substantial</span>,<br/>
🎧 such as <span>pasta</span> or a <span>casserole</span>.<br/>
🎧 Please <span>inform</span> us of any <span>allergies</span> that your <span>child</span> might <span>have<br/></span>
🎧 and we'll make sure they're <span>offered</span> a <span>suitable</span> <span>alternative</span>.<br/>
🎧 As you may know,<br/>
🎧 the <span>childcare</span> <span>service</span> <span>runs</span> through the school <span>holidays</span> from <span>8</span> <span>a.m</span>. to <span>6</span> <span>p.m</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>offer</span> a really <span>varied</span> and <span>exciting</span> <span>programme</span> to keep the children <span>entertained</span>,<br/>
🎧 we don't want them to feel as if they are still at school!<br/>
🎧 It will also feel <span>different<br/></span>
🎧 because they'll get the <span>chance</span> to make new friends with children from other <span>schools</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Spaces</span> are <span>available</span> for <span>them<br/></span>
🎧 because a lot of our <span>term-time</span> children don't always <span>attend</span> during the <span>holiday</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>past</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>parents</span> have <span>asked</span> if children over the age of <span>11</span> are <span>allowed</span> to come with their <span>younger</span> <span>brothers</span> and <span>sisters</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I'm <span>afraid</span> we're <span>unable</span> to do <span>this<br/></span>
🎧 because of the <span>type</span> of <span>insurance</span> we have.<br/>
🎧 So now let me tell you about some of the <span>activities</span> that your <span>child</span> can do during the <span>after-school</span> <span>sessions</span>.<br/>
🎧 As well as being able to use the <span>playground</span> <span>equipment</span>, <span>computers</span> and the <span>library</span>,<br/>
🎧 there is usually at <span>least</span> one <span>'special'</span> <span>activity</span> that children can do each day.<br/>
🎧 For example, <span>Spanish</span>.<br/>
🎧 We have a <span>specialist</span> <span>teacher</span> <span>coming</span> in every <span>Thursday<br/></span>
🎧 to give a <span>basic</span> <span>introduction</span> to the <span>language</span> through <span>games</span> and <span>songs</span>.<br/>
🎧 She does two <span>sessions</span>:<br/>
🎧 one for the over <span>8s</span> and one for the <span>younger</span> children.<br/>
🎧 This is the only <span>activity</span> which we have to make an <span>extra</span> <span>charge</span> <span>for<br/></span>
🎧 but it's well <span>worth</span> it.<br/>
🎧 Once a week the children have the <span>opportunity</span> to do some music.<br/>
🎧 We're very <span>lucky</span> that one of our <span>staff</span> is a <span>member</span> of a <span>folk</span> <span>band</span>.<br/>
🎧 On <span>Mondays</span>, she <span>teaches</span> <span>singing</span> and <span>percussion</span> to <span>groups</span> of children.<br/>
🎧 We do <span>rely</span> on <span>parental</span> <span>support</span> for this,<br/>
🎧 so if any of you <span>sing</span> or play an <span>instrument<br/></span>
🎧 and would be <span>prepared</span> to help out at these <span>sessions</span>, we'd be <span>delighted</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Painting</span> <span>continues</span> to be one of the most <span>popular</span> <span>activities</span>.<br/>
🎧 To <span>begin</span> with we weren't <span>keen</span> on <span>offering</span> this because of the <span>extra</span> <span>mess</span> <span>involved</span>,<br/>
🎧 but children <span>kept</span> <span>asking</span> if they could do some <span>art<br/></span>
🎧 and so we finally gave in.<br/>
🎧 <span>Art</span> is great for <span>helping</span> the children to <span>relax</span> after working <span>hard</span> at school all day.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yoga</span> is something that we've been <span>meaning</span> to <span>introduce</span> for some <span>time<br/></span>
🎧 but haven't been able to find <span>anyone</span> <span>available</span> to <span>teach</span> it,<br/>
🎧 until now that is.<br/>
🎧 So we'll see how this <span>goes</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hopefully</span>, children will <span>benefit</span> in all <span>sorts</span> of <span>ways</span> from this.<br/>
🎧 Cooking is another <span>popular</span> <span>activity</span>.<br/>
🎧 They make a different <span>sort</span> of <span>cake</span>, or <span>pizza</span> or <span>bread</span> each week.<br/>
🎧 Although the <span>younger</span> children love doing it,<br/>
🎧 we <span>found</span> that the <span>mess</span> was just too much,<br/>
🎧 so we've <span>decided</span> to <span>restrict</span> this to the over <span>8s</span>,<br/>
🎧 as they are better able to <span>clean</span> up after <span>themselves</span>.<br/>

🎧 Hello <span>Dr</span> <span>Green</span>,<br/>
🎧 I'm here to talk to you about my work <span>placement</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, it's <span>Holly</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 So, which work <span>placement</span> have you <span>chosen</span>?<br/>
🎧 I <span>decided</span> to go for the <span>Orion</span> <span>Stadium</span> <span>placement</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>event</span> I'll be <span>managing</span> is one where I'm <span>helping</span> to set up a <span>sports</span> <span>competition</span> for <span>primary</span> school children.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yup</span>. That's always a <span>popular</span> <span>placement</span>,<br/>
🎧 even though it can be <span>tougher</span> than you think working with children.<br/>
🎧 I know, but it's the <span>fresh</span> air that <span>attracts</span> me,<br/>
🎧 <span>organising</span> something <span>indoors</span> doesn't have the same <span>appeal</span>,<br/>
🎧 even though it might be fun.<br/>
🎧 OK, so <span>obviously</span> <span>safety's</span> going to be one of your key <span>concerns</span> for this <span>event</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I've already thought about that.<br/>
🎧 I'll need to make sure <span>none</span> of the <span>equipment's</span> <span>damaged</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ah well, you'll be working with <span>schools</span>, so the <span>equipment</span> will be their <span>responsibility</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, the <span>grounds</span> and what <span>goes</span> on there will be <span>yours</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh I see,<br/>
🎧 <span>that'll</span> <span>include</span> <span>keeping</span> everyone <span>within</span> the <span>boundary</span> once they're in their <span>kit</span> and on the <span>field</span>?<br/>
🎧 Exactly,<br/>
🎧 you'll need to <span>inspect</span> <span>areas</span> like <span>changing</span> <span>rooms</span> as well for anything <span>someone</span> can <span>trip</span> over,<br/>
🎧 but your <span>main</span> <span>priority</span> will be not to <span>lose</span> <span>anyone</span>!<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I'll need <span>staff</span> to help with that.<br/>
🎧 And don't <span>forget</span> about the <span>spectators</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was thinking that many of them will be <span>parents</span>, who could help run the <span>event</span>.<br/>
🎧 I wouldn't <span>rely</span> on that.<br/>
🎧 They'll be more interested in <span>filming</span> their children than <span>volunteering</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll need to make sure they don't <span>interfere</span> with <span>events</span> doing that!<br/>
🎧 And that's not always easy,<br/>
🎧 <span>especially</span> when a <span>proud</span> <span>parent's</span> trying to get a <span>snap</span> of their <span>child<br/></span>
🎧 and you want them to move <span>elsewhere</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 What about the <span>scheduling</span>?<br/>
🎧 With <span>sporting</span> <span>events</span> there are all <span>sorts</span> of things that can <span>alter</span> the <span>timetable</span>,<br/>
🎧 like <span>rain</span>, for <span>instance</span>, though so <span>far</span>, we've always been <span>lucky</span> with that.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, and I was thinking about what to do if <span>someone</span> got <span>hurt</span> as well.<br/>
🎧 I know that last year that <span>caused</span> a <span>terrible</span> <span>delay</span>.<br/>
🎧 You have to be <span>prepared</span> for such things.<br/>
🎧 Oh. What if a <span>match</span> <span>ends</span> in a <span>draw</span>,<br/>
🎧 do you let the <span>teams</span> keep going until <span>someone</span> <span>wins</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>That'll</span> be up to you,<br/>
🎧 and again, you need to plan for it.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Now, the <span>aim</span> of your work <span>placement</span> is to give you the <span>opportunity</span> to <span>develop</span> the <span>skills</span> that an <span>events</span> <span>manager</span> needs.<br/>
🎧 So, let's talk about those a bit.<br/>
🎧 Well, I think my <span>communication</span> <span>skills</span> are <span>pretty</span> good.<br/>
🎧 I can talk on the phone to people and book <span>venues</span> and that kind of thing.<br/>
🎧 Good, just remember it isn't only about what you say.<br/>
🎧 If you meet <span>someone</span> <span>face-to-face</span> and want to <span>persuade</span> them to be a <span>sponsor</span>, for <span>example…<br/></span>
🎧 Oh, I'll <span>dress</span> up for that! Sure.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 Let's go on to think about your <span>organisational</span> <span>skills</span>.<br/>
🎧 You're working in a very <span>people-based</span> <span>industry<br/></span>
🎧 and that <span>means</span> things won't always go to plan.<br/>
🎧 I <span>guess</span> it's being <span>prepared</span> to make changes that <span>matters</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 You may have to make an <span>on-the-spot</span> change to a <span>timetable</span> because of a <span>problem</span> you hadn't <span>anticipated..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>...just</span> do it! <span>OK<br/></span>
🎧 How's your time <span>management</span> these <span>days</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm working on it,<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>certainly</span> better when I have a <span>deadline</span>, which is why this work <span>suits</span> me.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but it's how you <span>respond</span> as that <span>deadline</span> <span>approaches</span>!<br/>
🎧 I know I've got to look <span>calm</span> even if I'm in a <span>panic</span>.<br/>
🎧 Just think to yourself,<br/>
🎧 no one must know I'm under <span>pressure</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, even though I'm <span>multi-tasking</span> like <span>crazy</span>!<br/>
🎧 Another <span>skill</span> that <span>events</span> <span>managers</span> need is <span>creativity</span>.<br/>
🎧 Often your <span>client</span> has what we call the <span>'big</span> <span>picture'</span> idea,<br/>
🎧 but it's up to the <span>events</span> <span>manager</span> to think of all the fine <span>points</span> that go to <span>making</span> it work.<br/>
🎧 Right, so I need to listen <span>carefully</span> to that idea and then <span>fill</span> in all the <span>gaps</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 And you'll have a <span>team</span> working under you,<br/>
🎧 so another key <span>skill</span> is <span>leadership</span>.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>team</span> may have lots of <span>ideas</span> too,<br/>
🎧 but you've got to make the <span>ultimate</span> <span>choices</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do we have <span>refreshments</span> inside or out, for example?<br/>
🎧 Isn't it better to be <span>democratic</span>?<br/>
🎧 It's a nice idea, but you have the <span>ultimate</span> <span>responsibility</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, <span>believe</span> in what you think best.<br/>
🎧 Be <span>prepared</span> to say <span>'yes'</span>, that's a good idea but it won't work here.<br/>
🎧 I see what you mean.<br/>
🎧 What about the <span>networking</span> side of things?<br/>
🎧 I know it's an <span>area</span> that a lot of students <span>worry</span> <span>about<br/></span>
🎧 because we don't have much <span>experience</span> to <span>offer</span> <span>others</span>.<br/>
🎧 But even without it, you can still be an <span>interesting</span> person with <span>useful</span> <span>ideas</span>.<br/>
🎧 And the more people you <span>impress</span>, the better.<br/>
🎧 I <span>guess</span> that will help me when I <span>apply</span> for a <span>real</span> <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 Exactly, think ahead, remember what your <span>ambitions</span> are and keep them in <span>mind</span>.<br/>
🎧 Definitely.<br/>

🎧 <span>Scientists</span> <span>believe</span> that a <span>majority</span> of the <span>earth's</span> <span>bird</span> <span>population</span> <span>migrate</span> in some <span>fashion</span> or other.<br/>
🎧 Some travel <span>seasonally</span> for <span>relatively</span> short <span>distances</span>,<br/>
🎧 such as <span>birds</span> that move from their <span>winter</span> <span>habitats</span> in <span>lowlands</span> to <span>mountain</span> <span>tops</span> for the <span>summers</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Others</span>, like the <span>Arctic</span> <span>Tern</span>,<br/>
🎧 travel more than <span>25,000</span> <span>miles</span> <span>seasonally</span> between the <span>northern</span> and <span>southern</span> <span>poles</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Bird</span> <span>migration</span> has been <span>studied</span> over many <span>centuries</span> through a <span>variety</span> of <span>observations</span>.<br/>
🎧 But until <span>relatively</span> <span>recently</span>,<br/>
🎧 where <span>birds</span> went to in the <span>winter</span> was <span>considered</span> something of a <span>mystery</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>lack</span> of <span>modern</span> <span>science</span> and <span>technology</span> <span>led</span> to many <span>theories</span> that we now <span>recognize</span> as <span>error-filled<br/></span>
🎧 and even <span>somewhat</span> <span>amusing</span>.<br/>
🎧 Take <span>hibernation</span> <span>theory</span> for example,<br/>
🎧 <span>2000</span> years ago, it was <span>commonly</span> <span>believed</span> that when <span>birds</span> <span>left</span> an <span>area</span>,<br/>
🎧 they went <span>underwater</span> to <span>hibernate</span> in the <span>seas</span> and <span>oceans</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>theory</span> for the <span>regular</span> <span>appearance</span> and <span>disappearance</span> of <span>birds<br/></span>
🎧 was that they <span>spend</span> <span>winter</span> <span>hidden</span> in <span>mud</span> <span>till</span> the <span>weather</span> <span>changed</span> and food <span>became</span> <span>abundant</span> again.<br/>
🎧 The <span>theory</span> that some <span>birds</span> <span>hibernate</span> <span>persisted</span> until <span>experiments</span> were done on <span>caged</span> <span>birds</span> in the <span>1940s<br/></span>
🎧 which <span>demonstrated</span> that <span>birds</span> have no <span>hibernation</span> <span>instinct</span>.<br/>
🎧 One of the <span>earliest</span> <span>naturalists</span> and <span>philosophers</span> from <span>ancient</span> <span>Greece</span> was <span>Aristotle<br/></span>
🎧 who was the first <span>writer</span> to <span>discuss</span> the <span>disappearance</span> and <span>reappearance</span> of some <span>bird</span> <span>species</span> at <span>certain</span> <span>times</span> of year.<br/>
🎧 He <span>developed</span> the <span>theory</span> of <span>transmutation</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>seasonal</span> change of one <span>species</span> into another <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 by <span>observing</span> <span>redstarts</span> and <span>robins</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>observed</span> that in the <span>autumn</span>,<br/>
🎧 small <span>birds</span> called <span>'redstarts'</span> <span>began</span> to <span>lose</span> their <span>feathers</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>convinced</span> <span>Aristotle</span> that they <span>changed</span> into <span>robins</span> for the <span>winter</span>,<br/>
🎧 and back into <span>redstarts</span> in the <span>summer</span>.<br/>
🎧 These <span>assumptions</span> are <span>understandable</span> <span>given</span> that this <span>pair</span> of <span>species</span> are <span>similar</span> in <span>shape</span>,<br/>
🎧 but are a <span>classic</span> example of an <span>incorrect</span> <span>interpretation</span> <span>based</span> on <span>correct</span> <span>observations</span>.<br/>
🎧 The most <span>bizarre</span> <span>theory</span> was put forward by an English <span>amateur</span> <span>scientist</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>Charles</span> <span>Morton</span>, in the <span>seventeenth</span> <span>century</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>wrote</span> a <span>surprisingly</span> <span>well-regarded</span> <span>paper<br/></span>
🎧 <span>claiming</span> that <span>birds</span> <span>migrate</span> to the <span>moon</span> and back every year.<br/>
🎧 He came to this <span>conclusion</span> as the only <span>logical</span> <span>explanation</span> for the <span>total</span> <span>disappearance</span> of some <span>species</span>.<br/>
🎧 One of the key <span>moments</span> in the <span>development</span> of <span>migration</span> <span>theory</span> came in <span>1822<br/></span>
🎧 when a <span>white</span> <span>stork</span> was <span>shot</span> in <span>Germany</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>particular</span> <span>stork</span> made <span>history</span> because of the long <span>spear</span> in its <span>neck<br/></span>
🎧 which <span>incredibly</span> had not <span>killed</span> it,<br/>
🎧 everyone <span>immediately</span> <span>realised</span> this <span>spear</span> was definitely not <span>European</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>turned</span> out to be a <span>spear</span> from a <span>tribe</span> in <span>Central</span> <span>Africa</span>.<br/>
🎧 This was a <span>truly</span> <span>defining</span> <span>moment</span> in the <span>history</span> of <span>ornithology<br/></span>
🎧 because it was the first <span>evidence</span> that <span>storks</span> <span>spend</span> their <span>winters</span> in <span>sub-Saharan</span> <span>Africa</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can still see the <span>'arrow</span> <span>stork'</span> in the <span>Zoological</span> <span>Collection</span> of the University of <span>Rostock</span> in <span>Germany</span>.<br/>
🎧 People <span>gradually</span> <span>became</span> <span>aware</span> that <span>European</span> <span>birds</span> <span>moved</span> <span>south</span> in <span>autumn</span> and <span>north</span> in <span>summer<br/></span>
🎧 but didn't know much about it until the practice of <span>catching</span> <span>birds</span> and <span>putting</span> <span>rings</span> on their <span>legs</span> <span>became</span> <span>established</span>.<br/>
🎧 Before this, very little <span>information</span> was <span>available</span> about the <span>actual</span> <span>destinations</span> of <span>particular</span> <span>species<br/></span>
🎧 and how they <span>travelled</span> there.<br/>
🎧 People <span>speculated</span> that <span>larger</span> <span>birds</span> <span>provided</span> a kind of <span>taxi</span> <span>service</span> for <span>smaller</span> <span>birds<br/></span>
🎧 by <span>carrying</span> them on their <span>backs</span>.<br/>
🎧 This idea came <span>about<br/></span>
🎧 because it <span>seemed</span> <span>impossible</span> that small <span>birds</span> <span>weighing</span> only a few <span>grams</span> could fly over <span>vast</span> <span>oceans</span>.<br/>
🎧 This idea was <span>supported</span> by <span>observations</span> of <span>bird</span> <span>behaviour<br/></span>
🎧 such as the <span>harassment</span> of <span>larger</span> <span>birds</span> by <span>smaller</span> <span>birds</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>development</span> of <span>bird</span> <span>ringing</span>, by a <span>Danish</span> <span>schoolteacher</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>Hans</span> <span>Christian</span> <span>Cornelius</span> <span>Mortensen</span>,<br/>
🎧 made many <span>discoveries</span> <span>possible</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is still <span>common</span> practice today and <span>relies</span> <span>upon</span> what is <span>known</span> as <span>'recovery'</span>,<br/>
🎧 this is when <span>ringed</span> <span>birds</span> are <span>found</span> <span>dead</span> in the place they have <span>migrated</span> to, and <span>identified</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Huge</span> <span>amounts</span> of <span>data</span> were <span>gathered</span> in the <span>early</span> <span>part</span> of the <span>twentieth</span> <span>century<br/></span>
🎧 and for the first time in <span>history</span> people <span>understood</span> where <span>birds</span> actually went to in <span>winter</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>1931</span>, an <span>atlas</span> was <span>published</span> <span>showing</span> where the most <span>common</span> <span>species</span> of <span>European</span> <span>birds</span> <span>migrated</span> to.<br/>
