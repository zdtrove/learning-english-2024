🎧 Good morning, <span>Clare House <span>Hotel.<br/>
🎧 <span>Andrew <span>speaking.<br/>
🎧 I'm the <span>Events <span>Manager.<br/>
🎧 Good morning, <span>Andrew.<br/>
🎧 My <span>name's <span>Samantha.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>arranging a <span>party for my <span>parents' <span>fiftieth <span>wedding <span>anniversary,<br/>
🎧 and I'm <span>ringing to ask about <span>hiring a room some time next <span>September.<br/>
🎧 Also my <span>parents and <span>several of the <span>guests will need <span>accommodation.<br/>
🎧 OK, I'm sure we can help you with that.<br/>
🎧 Will you be having a <span>sit-down <span>meal or a <span>buffet?<br/>
🎧 Probably a <span>sit-down.<br/>
🎧 And do you know how many people <span>there'll be?<br/>
🎧 Around <span>eighty, I think.<br/>
🎧 Well we have two <span>rooms that can <span>hold that number.<br/>
🎧 One is the <span>Adelphi Room.<br/>
🎧 That can <span>seat <span>85, or <span>hold over a <span>hundred if people are <span>standing for a <span>buffet.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 If you have live music, there's room for <span>four or <span>five <span>musicians in the <span>gallery <span>overlooking the room.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>guests usually <span>appreciate the <span>fact that the music can be <span>loud enough for <span>dancing,<br/>
🎧 but not too <span>loud for <span>conversation.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I really don't like it when you can't talk.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 Now the <span>Adelphi Room is at the back of the <span>hotel,<br/>
🎧 and there are <span>French <span>windows <span>leading out <span>onto the <span>terrace.<br/>
🎧 This has a <span>beautiful <span>display of <span>pots of <span>roses at that time of the year.<br/>
🎧 Which <span>direction does it <span>face?<br/>
🎧 <span>Southwest,<br/>
🎧 so that side of the <span>hotel <span>gets the sun in the <span>afternoon and <span>early <span>evening.<br/>
🎧 Very nice.<br/>
🎧 From the <span>terrace you can see the <span>area of <span>trees <span>within the <span>grounds of the <span>hotel,<br/>
🎧 or you can <span>stroll through there to the <span>river <span>- that's on the <span>far side,<br/>
🎧 so it isn't <span>visible from the <span>hotel.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Then another option is the <span>Carlton Room.<br/>
🎧 This is a bit <span>bigger <span>- it can <span>hold up to <span>110 <span>people<br/>
🎧 and it has the <span>advantage of a <span>stage, which is <span>useful if you have any <span>entertainment,<br/>
🎧 or <span>indeed a small <span>band can fit <span>onto it.<br/>
🎧 And can you go outside from the room?<br/>
🎧 No, the <span>Carlton Room is on the first <span>floor,<br/>
🎧 but on one side the <span>windows look out <span>onto the <span>lake.<br/>
🎧 <span>Lovely.<br/>
🎧 I think either of those <span>rooms would be <span>suitable.<br/>
🎧 Can I tell you about some of the options we <span>offer in <span>addition?<br/>
🎧 Please do.<br/>
🎧 As well as a <span>meal, you can have an <span>MC, a <span>Master of <span>Ceremonies,<br/>
🎧 who'll be with you <span>throughout the <span>party.<br/>
🎧 What exactly is the <span>MC's <span>function?<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose they make a <span>speech during the <span>meal if we need one, do they?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 All our <span>MCs are <span>trained as <span>public <span>speakers,<br/>
🎧 so they can <span>easily get <span>people's <span>attention <span>-<br/>
🎧 many <span>guests are glad to have <span>someone who can make <span>themselves heard <span>above the <span>chatter!<br/>
🎧 And they're also your <span>support <span>-<br/>
🎧 if anything <span>goes wrong, the <span>MC will <span>deal with it, so you can <span>relax.<br/>
🎧 Great!<br/>
🎧 I'll need to ask you about food,<br/>
🎧 but something else that's important is <span>accommodation.<br/>
🎧 You <span>obviously have <span>rooms in the <span>hotel,<br/>
🎧 but do you also have any other <span>accommodation, like <span>cabins, for example?<br/>
🎧 Yes, there are <span>five in the <span>grounds, all <span>self-contained.<br/>
🎧 They each <span>sleep two to <span>four people and have their own living room, <span>bathroom and small <span>kitchen.<br/>
🎧 That sounds perfect for what we'll need.<br/>
🎧 Now you have <span>various <span>facilities, don't you?<br/>
🎧 Are they all <span>included in the <span>price of <span>hiring the room?<br/>
🎧 The <span>pool, for <span>instance.<br/>
🎧 <span>Normally you'd be able to use it,<br/>
🎧 but it'll be <span>closed <span>throughout <span>September for <span>refurbishment, I'm <span>afraid.<br/>
🎧 The gym will be <span>available, though, at no <span>extra <span>charge.<br/>
🎧 That's open all day, from six in the morning until <span>midnight.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>tennis <span>courts, but there is a small <span>additional <span>payment for those.<br/>
🎧 We have <span>four <span>courts, and it's <span>worth <span>booking in <span>advance if you <span>possibly can,<br/>
🎧 as there can be quite a long <span>waiting <span>list for them!<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Now could we <span>discuss the food?<br/>
🎧 This would be dinner, around <span>seven <span>o'clock…<br/>
<br />

🎧 Hello everyone.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>Jake <span>Stevens and I'm your <span>rep here at the <span>hotel.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you'll all have a great time here.<br/>
🎧 So let me tell you a bit about what's on <span>offer.<br/>
🎧 I'll start by <span>telling you about some of the <span>excursions that are <span>available for <span>guests.<br/>
🎧 One thing you have to do while you're here is go <span>dolphin watching.<br/>
🎧 On our <span>boat <span>trips, we <span>pretty well <span>guarantee you'll see <span>dolphins <span>-<br/>
🎧 if you don't you can <span>repeat the <span>trip free of <span>charge.<br/>
🎧 We <span>organise <span>daily <span>trips for just <span>35 <span>euros.<br/>
🎧 <span>Unfortunately there aren't any <span>places <span>left for this <span>afternoon's <span>trip,<br/>
🎧 but come and see me to book for later in the week.<br/>
🎧 If you're <span>energetic, I'd <span>recommend our <span>forest <span>walk.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>guided <span>walk of about <span>seven <span>kilometres.<br/>
🎧 <span>There'll be a <span>stop <span>half way, and you'll be <span>provided with a drink and <span>sandwiches.<br/>
🎧 There's some <span>fairly <span>steep <span>climbs up the <span>hills,<br/>
🎧 so you need to be <span>reasonably fit for this one,<br/>
🎧 with good <span>shoes, and <span>bring a <span>waterproof in case it <span>rains.<br/>
🎧 It's just <span>25 <span>euros all <span>inclusive, and it's every <span>Wednesday.<br/>
🎧 Then on <span>Thursdays we <span>organise a <span>cycle <span>trip,<br/>
🎧 which will give you all the fun of <span>biking without the <span>effort.<br/>
🎧 We'll take you and your <span>bike up to the top of <span>Mount <span>Larna,<br/>
🎧 and leave you to <span>bike back <span>-<br/>
🎧 it's a <span>700-metre <span>drop in just <span>20 <span>kilometres<br/>
🎧 so this isn't really for <span>inexperienced <span>cyclists as you'll be going <span>pretty <span>fast.<br/>
🎧 And if it's a <span>clear day, you'll have <span>fantastic <span>views.<br/>
🎧 On our <span>local <span>craft <span>tour you can find out about the <span>traditional <span>activities in the <span>island.<br/>
🎧 And the best thing about this <span>trip is that it's <span>completely free.<br/>
🎧 You'll be taken to a <span>factory where <span>jewellery is made, and also a <span>ceramics <span>centre.<br/>
🎧 If you want, you can buy some of the <span>products but that's <span>entirely up to you.<br/>
🎧 The <span>trip <span>starts after lunch on <span>Thursday, and you'll <span>return by <span>6 pm.<br/>
🎧 If you're interested in <span>astronomy you may already know that the <span>island's one of the best <span>places in the <span>world to <span>observe the <span>night sky.<br/>
🎧 We can <span>offer <span>trips to the <span>observatory on <span>Friday for those who are interested.<br/>
🎧 They <span>cost <span>90 <span>euros <span>per <span>person<br/>
🎧 and you'll be <span>shown the <span>huge <span>telescopes and have a talk from an <span>expert,<br/>
🎧 who'll <span>explain all about how they work.<br/>
🎧 <span>Afterwards we'll <span>head down to <span>Sunset <span>Beach,<br/>
🎧 where you can have a <span>dip in the <span>ocean if you want before we <span>head off back to the <span>hotel.<br/>
🎧 Finally, there's <span>horse <span>riding.<br/>
🎧 This is <span>organised by the <span>Equestrian <span>Centre over near <span>Playa <span>Cortino<br/>
🎧 and it's a great <span>experience if you're a <span>keen <span>horseback <span>rider,<br/>
🎧 or even if you've never been on a <span>horse before.<br/>
🎧 They take you down to the <span>beach,<br/>
🎧 and you can <span>canter along the <span>sand and through the <span>waves.<br/>
🎧 It <span>costs <span>35 <span>euros and it's <span>available every day.<br/>
🎧 So there's <span>plenty to do in the <span>daytime, but what about <span>night life?<br/>
🎧 Well, the number one <span>attraction's called <span>'Musical <span>Favourites'.<br/>
🎧 <span>Guests enjoy a <span>three-course <span>meal and <span>unlimited free <span>drinks, and <span>watch a <span>fantastic show,<br/>
🎧 <span>starting with <span>musicals set in <span>Paris and then <span>crossing the <span>Atlantic to <span>Las <span>Vegas<br/>
🎧 and finally <span>Copacabana.<br/>
🎧 At the end the <span>cast <span>members come down from the <span>stage, still in their <span>stunning <span>costumes,<br/>
🎧 and you'll have a <span>chance to <span>chat with them.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>hugely <span>popular, so let me know now if you're interested because it's no good <span>leaving it until the last <span>minute.<br/>
🎧 It's on <span>Friday <span>night.<br/>
🎧 <span>Tickets are just <span>50 <span>euros each, but for an <span>extra <span>10 <span>euros you can have a <span>table right by the <span>stage.<br/>
🎧 If you'd like to go back in time, there's the <span>Castle <span>Feast on <span>Saturday <span>evening.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>held in a <span>twelfth-century <span>castle, and you eat in the great <span>courtyard,<br/>
🎧 with <span>ladies in long <span>gowns <span>serving your food.<br/>
🎧 You're <span>given a whole <span>chicken each, which you eat in the <span>medieval way, <span>using your <span>hands <span>instead of <span>cutlery,<br/>
🎧 and you're <span>entertained by <span>competitions where the <span>horseback <span>riders <span>attempt to <span>knock one another off their <span>horses.<br/>
🎧 Then you can <span>watch the <span>dancers in the <span>ballroom and join in as well if you want.<br/>
🎧 OK, so now if <span>anyone…<br/>

🎧 Hello, <span>Trevor.<br/>
🎧 Hello, <span>Stephanie.<br/>
🎧 You said you wanted to talk about the course I'm taking on <span>literature for children.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 I'm thinking of doing it next year, but I'd like to find out more about it first.<br/>
🎧 OK, well, as you probably know, it's a <span>one-year course.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>divided into six <span>modules, and you have to take all of them.<br/>
🎧 One of the most <span>interesting <span>ones, for me, at <span>least,<br/>
🎧 was about the <span>purpose of <span>children's <span>literature.<br/>
🎧 You mean, <span>whether it should just <span>entertain children or should be <span>educational, as well.<br/>
🎧 Right, and <span>whether the <span>teaching should be <span>factual <span>- <span>giving them <span>information about the <span>world <span>- or <span>ethical, <span>teaching them <span>values.<br/>
🎧 What's <span>fascinating is that the <span>writer isn't <span>necessarily <span>conscious of the <span>message they're <span>conveying.<br/>
🎧 For <span>instance, a <span>story might show a <span>child who has a <span>problem as a <span>result of not doing what an <span>adult has told them to do,<br/>
🎧 <span>implying that children should always <span>obey <span>adults.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ah... I see what you mean.<br/>
🎧 That <span>module made me <span>realise how important <span>stories are <span>-<br/>
🎧 they can have a <span>significant <span>effect on children as they <span>grow up.<br/>
🎧 Actually, it <span>inspired me to have a go at it myself, just for my own <span>interest.<br/>
🎧 I know I can't <span>compete with the really <span>popular <span>stories, like the <span>Harry <span>Potter books <span>- they're very good,<br/>
🎧 and even young <span>kids like my <span>seven-year-old <span>niece love <span>reading them.<br/>
🎧 I'm very interested in <span>illustrations in <span>stories.<br/>
🎧 Is that <span>covered in the course?<br/>
🎧 Yes, there's a <span>module on <span>pictures,<br/>
🎧 and how they're sometimes <span>central to the <span>story.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mm.. that's good.<br/>
🎧 I remember some <span>frightening <span>ones I saw as a <span>child and I can still see them <span>vividly in my <span>mind, years later!<br/>
🎧 <span>Pictures can be so <span>powerful, just as <span>powerful as <span>words.<br/>
🎧 I've always <span>enjoyed <span>drawing, so that's the <span>field I want to go into when I <span>finish the course.<br/>
🎧 I bet that <span>module will be really <span>helpful.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure it will.<br/>
🎧 We also <span>studied <span>comics in that <span>module,<br/>
🎧 but I'm not <span>convinced of their <span>value, not <span>compared with books.<br/>
🎧 One of the great things about <span>words is that you use your <span>imagination,<br/>
🎧 but with a <span>comic you don't have to.<br/>
🎧 But children are so used to <span>visual <span>input <span>- on <span>TV, <span>video <span>games, and so on.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>plenty of <span>kids who wouldn't even try to read a book,<br/>
🎧 so I think <span>comics can <span>serve a really <span>useful <span>purpose.<br/>
🎧 You mean, it's better to read a <span>comic than not to read at all?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I <span>suppose you're right.<br/>
🎧 I just think its sad when children don't read books.<br/>
🎧 What about books for girls and books for <span>boys?<br/>
🎧 Does the course go into that?<br/>
🎧 Yes, there's a <span>module on it.<br/>
🎧 For years, lots of <span>stories, in English, at <span>least, <span>assumed that <span>boys went out and did <span>adventurous <span>things<br/>
🎧 and girls <span>stayed at home and <span>played with <span>dolls.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>amazed how many books were <span>targeted at just one <span>sex or the other.<br/>
🎧 Of course this <span>reflects <span>society as it is when the books are <span>written.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>true.<br/>
🎧 So it sounds as though you think it's a good course.<br/>
🎧 Definitely.<br/>
🎧 Have you been <span>reading lots of <span>children's <span>stories, to help you decide <span>whether to take the course?<br/>
🎧 Yeah. I've <span>gone as <span>far back as the <span>late <span>seventeenth <span>century,<br/>
🎧 though I know there were <span>earlier <span>children's <span>stories.<br/>
🎧 So does that mean you've read <span>Perrault's <span>fairy <span>tales?<br/>
🎧 <span>Cinderella, The <span>Sleeping <span>Beauty, and so on.<br/>
🎧 Yes!<br/>
🎧 They must be important, because no <span>stories of that <span>type had been <span>written before,<br/>
🎧 these were the first.<br/>
🎧 Then there's The <span>Swiss <span>Family <span>Robinson.<br/>
🎧 I haven't read that.<br/>
🎧 The English name makes it sound as though <span>Robinson is the <span>family's <span>surname,<br/>
🎧 but a more <span>accurate <span>translation would be The <span>Swiss <span>Robinsons,<br/>
🎧 because it's about a <span>Swiss <span>family who are <span>shipwrecked,<br/>
🎧 like <span>Robinson <span>Crusoe in the <span>novel of a <span>century <span>earlier.<br/>
🎧 Well I never <span>knew that!<br/>
🎧 Have you read <span>Hoffmann's The <span>Nutcracker and the <span>Mouse <span>King?<br/>
🎧 Wasn't that the <span>basis for <span>Tchaikovsky's <span>ballet The <span>Nutcracker?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 It has some quite <span>bizarre <span>elements.<br/>
🎧 I hope you've read <span>Oscar <span>Wilde's The Happy <span>Prince.<br/>
🎧 It's probably my <span>favourite <span>children's <span>story of all time.<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh.. <span>mine too!<br/>
🎧 And it's so <span>surprising, because <span>Wilde is best <span>known for his <span>plays,<br/>
🎧 and most of them are very <span>witty, but The Happy <span>Prince is really <span>moving.<br/>
🎧 I <span>struggled with <span>Tolkien's The <span>Lord of the <span>Rings...<br/>
🎧 <span>three long books, and I gave up after one.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>extremely <span>popular, though.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, but <span>whereas something like The Happy <span>Prince just <span>carried me along with it,<br/>
🎧 The <span>Lord of the <span>Rings took more <span>effort than I was <span>prepared to give it.<br/>
🎧 I didn't find that <span>- I love it.<br/>
🎧 Another one I've read is War <span>Horse.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes. It's about the First <span>World War, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 <span>Hardly what you'd <span>expect for a <span>children's <span>story.<br/>
🎧 Exactly, but it's been very <span>successful.<br/>
🎧 Have you read <span>any…<br/>
<br />

🎧 In <span>today's class I'm going to talk about <span>marine <span>archaeology,<br/>
🎧 the <span>branch of <span>archaeology <span>focusing on <span>human <span>interaction with the sea, <span>lakes and <span>rivers.<br/>
🎧 It's the <span>study of <span>ships, <span>cargoes, <span>shipping <span>facilities, and other <span>physical <span>remains.<br/>
🎧 I'll give you an example,<br/>
🎧 then go on to show how this <span>type of <span>research is being <span>transformed by the use of the <span>latest <span>technology.<br/>
🎧 <span>Atlit-Yam was a <span>village on the <span>coast of the <span>eastern <span>Mediterranean,<br/>
🎧 which <span>seems to have been <span>thriving until around <span>7,000 <span>BC.<br/>
🎧 The <span>residents <span>kept <span>cattle, <span>caught <span>fish and <span>stored <span>grain.<br/>
🎧 They had <span>wells for <span>fresh water,<br/>
🎧 many of their <span>houses were <span>built around a <span>courtyard and were <span>constructed of <span>stone.<br/>
🎧 The <span>village <span>contained an <span>impressive <span>monument:<br/>
🎧 <span>seven <span>half-tonne <span>stones <span>standing in a <span>semicircle around a <span>spring,<br/>
🎧 that might have been used for <span>ceremonial <span>purposes.<br/>
🎧 <span>Atlit-Yam may have been <span>destroyed <span>swiftly by a <span>tsunami,<br/>
🎧 or <span>climate change may have <span>caused <span>glaciers to <span>melt and sea <span>levels to <span>rise, <span>flooding the <span>village <span>gradually.<br/>
🎧 Whatever the <span>cause, it now <span>lies ten <span>metres <span>below the <span>surface of the <span>Mediterranean,<br/>
🎧 <span>buried under <span>sand at the <span>bottom of the sea.<br/>
🎧 It's been <span>described as the <span>largest and best <span>preserved <span>prehistoric <span>settlement ever <span>found on the <span>seabed.<br/>
🎧 For <span>marine <span>archaeologists, <span>Atlit-Yam is a <span>treasure <span>trove.<br/>
🎧 <span>Research on the <span>buildings, <span>tools and the <span>human <span>remains has <span>revealed how the <span>bustling <span>village once <span>functioned,<br/>
🎧 and even what <span>diseases some of its <span>residents <span>suffered from.<br/>
🎧 But of course this is only one small <span>village, one <span>window into a <span>lost <span>world.<br/>
🎧 For a <span>fuller <span>picture, <span>researchers need more <span>sunken <span>settlements,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>hard <span>part is <span>finding them.<br/>
🎧 <span>Underwater <span>research used to <span>require <span>divers to find <span>shipwrecks or <span>artefacts,<br/>
🎧 but in the second <span>half of the <span>twentieth <span>century, <span>various <span>types of <span>underwater <span>vehicles were <span>developed,<br/>
🎧 some <span>controlled from a <span>ship on the <span>surface, and some of them <span>autonomous,<br/>
🎧 which <span>means they don't need to be <span>operated by a person.<br/>
🎧 <span>Autonomous <span>underwater <span>vehicles, or <span>AUVs,<br/>
🎧 are used in the oil <span>industry, for <span>instance, to <span>create <span>maps of the <span>seabed before <span>rigs and <span>pipelines are <span>installed.<br/>
🎧 To <span>navigate they use <span>sensors, such as <span>compasses and <span>sonar.<br/>
🎧 Until <span>relatively <span>recently they were very <span>expensive, and so <span>heavy that they had to be <span>launched from a large <span>vessel with a <span>winch.<br/>
🎧 But the <span>latest <span>AUVs are much <span>easier to <span>manoeuvre <span>-<br/>
🎧 they can be <span>launched from the <span>shore or a small <span>ship.<br/>
🎧 And they're much <span>cheaper, which makes them more <span>accessible to <span>research <span>teams.<br/>
🎧 They're also very <span>sophisticated.<br/>
🎧 They can <span>communicate with each other and, for example,<br/>
🎧 work out the most <span>efficient way to <span>survey a <span>site,<br/>
🎧 or to find <span>particular <span>objects on the <span>seabed.<br/>
🎧 <span>Field <span>tests show the <span>approach can work.<br/>
🎧 For example, in a <span>trial in <span>2015,<br/>
🎧 <span>three <span>AUVs <span>searched for <span>wrecks at <span>Marzamemi, off the <span>coast of <span>Sicily.<br/>
🎧 The <span>site is the <span>final <span>resting place of an <span>ancient <span>Roman <span>ship,<br/>
🎧 which <span>sank in the <span>sixth <span>century <span>AD<br/>
🎧 while <span>ferrying <span>prefabricated <span>marble <span>elements for the <span>construction of an <span>early <span>church.<br/>
🎧 The <span>AUVs <span>mapped the <span>area in <span>detail, <span>finding other <span>ships <span>carrying <span>columns of the same <span>material.<br/>
🎧 <span>Creating an <span>internet in the sea for <span>AUVs to <span>communicate is no easy <span>matter.<br/>
🎧 <span>Wifi <span>networks on <span>land use <span>electromagnetic <span>waves,<br/>
🎧 but in water these will only travel a few <span>centimetres.<br/>
🎧 <span>Instead, a more <span>complex mix of <span>technologies is <span>required.<br/>
🎧 For short <span>distances, <span>AUVs can share <span>data <span>using <span>light,<br/>
🎧 while <span>acoustic <span>waves are used to <span>communicate over long <span>distances.<br/>
🎧 But more <span>creative <span>solutions are also being <span>developed,<br/>
🎧 where an <span>AUV working on the <span>seabed <span>offloads <span>data to a second <span>AUV,<br/>
🎧 which then <span>surfaces and <span>beams the <span>data home to the <span>research <span>team <span>using a <span>satellite.<br/>
🎧 There's also a <span>system that <span>enables <span>AUVs to share <span>information from <span>seabed <span>scans, and other <span>data.<br/>
🎧 So if an <span>AUV <span>surveying the <span>seabed <span>finds an <span>intriguing <span>object,<br/>
🎧 it can share the <span>coordinates of the <span>object <span>- that is, its <span>position <span>-<br/>
🎧 with a <span>nearby <span>AUV that <span>carries <span>superior <span>cameras,<br/>
🎧 and <span>arrange for that <span>AUV to make a <span>closer <span>inspection of the <span>object.<br/>
🎧 <span>Marine <span>archaeologists are <span>excited about the <span>huge <span>potential of these <span>AUVs for their <span>discipline.<br/>
🎧 One <span>site where they're going to be <span>deployed is the <span>Gulf of <span>Baratti, off the <span>Italian <span>coast.<br/>
🎧 In <span>1974, a <span>2,000-year-old <span>Roman <span>vessel was <span>discovered here, in <span>18 <span>metres of water.<br/>
🎧 When it <span>sank, it was <span>carrying <span>medical <span>goods, in <span>wooden or <span>tin <span>receptacles.<br/>
🎧 Its <span>cargo <span>gives us <span>insight into the <span>treatments <span>available all those years ago,<br/>
🎧 <span>including <span>tablets that are thought to have been <span>dissolved to <span>form a <span>cleansing <span>liquid for the <span>eyes.<br/>
🎧 Other <span>Roman <span>ships went down <span>nearby, taking their <span>cargoes with them.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>held <span>huge <span>pots made of <span>terracotta.<br/>
🎧 Some were used for <span>transporting <span>cargoes of <span>olive oil, and <span>others <span>held <span>wine.<br/>
🎧 In many <span>cases it's only these <span>containers that <span>remain,<br/>
🎧 while the <span>wooden <span>ships have been <span>buried under <span>silt on the <span>seabed.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>project...<br/>
