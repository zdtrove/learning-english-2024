🎧 Good morning, Clare House Hotel.<br/>
🎧 Andrew speaking.<br/>
🎧 I'm the Events Manager.<br/>
🎧 Good morning, Andrew.<br/>
🎧 My name's Samantha.<br/>
🎧 I'm arranging a party for my parents' fiftieth wedding anniversary,<br/>
🎧 and I'm ringing to ask about hiring a room some time next September.<br/>
🎧 Also my parents and several of the guests will need accommodation.<br/>
🎧 OK, I'm sure we can help you with that.<br/>
🎧 Will you be having a sit-down meal or a buffet?<br/>
🎧 Probably a sit-down.<br/>
🎧 And do you know how many people there'll be?<br/>
🎧 Around eighty, I think.<br/>
🎧 Well we have two rooms that can hold that number.<br/>
🎧 One is the Adelphi Room.<br/>
🎧 That can seat 85, or hold over a hundred if people are standing for a buffet.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 If you have live music, there's room for four or five musicians in the gallery overlooking the room.<br/>
🎧 Our guests usually appreciate the fact that the music can be loud enough for dancing,<br/>
🎧 but not too loud for conversation.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I really don't like it when you can't talk.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 Now the Adelphi Room is at the back of the hotel,<br/>
🎧 and there are French windows leading out onto the terrace.<br/>
🎧 This has a beautiful display of pots of roses at that time of the year.<br/>
🎧 Which direction does it face?<br/>
🎧 Southwest,<br/>
🎧 so that side of the hotel gets the sun in the afternoon and early evening.<br/>
🎧 Very nice.<br/>
🎧 From the terrace you can see the area of trees within the grounds of the hotel,<br/>
🎧 or you can stroll through there to the river - that's on the far side,<br/>
🎧 so it isn't visible from the hotel.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Then another option is the Carlton Room.<br/>
🎧 This is a bit bigger - it can hold up to 110 people<br/>
🎧 and it has the advantage of a stage, which is useful if you have any entertainment,<br/>
🎧 or indeed a small band can fit onto it.<br/>
🎧 And can you go outside from the room?<br/>
🎧 No, the Carlton Room is on the first floor,<br/>
🎧 but on one side the windows look out onto the lake.<br/>
🎧 Lovely.<br/>
🎧 I think either of those rooms would be suitable.<br/>
🎧 Can I tell you about some of the options we offer in addition?<br/>
🎧 Please do.<br/>
🎧 As well as a meal, you can have an MC, a Master of Ceremonies,<br/>
🎧 who'll be with you throughout the party.<br/>
🎧 What exactly is the MC's function?<br/>
🎧 I suppose they make a speech during the meal if we need one, do they?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 All our MCs are trained as public speakers,<br/>
🎧 so they can easily get people's attention -<br/>
🎧 many guests are glad to have someone who can make themselves heard above the chatter!<br/>
🎧 And they're also your support -<br/>
🎧 if anything goes wrong, the MC will deal with it, so you can relax.<br/>
🎧 Great!<br/>
🎧 I'll need to ask you about food,<br/>
🎧 but something else that's important is accommodation.<br/>
🎧 You obviously have rooms in the hotel,<br/>
🎧 but do you also have any other accommodation, like cabins, for example?<br/>
🎧 Yes, there are five in the grounds, all self-contained.<br/>
🎧 They each sleep two to four people and have their own living room, bathroom and small kitchen.<br/>
🎧 That sounds perfect for what we'll need.<br/>
🎧 Now you have various facilities, don't you?<br/>
🎧 Are they all included in the price of hiring the room?<br/>
🎧 The pool, for instance.<br/>
🎧 Normally you'd be able to use it,<br/>
🎧 but it'll be closed throughout September for refurbishment, I'm afraid.<br/>
🎧 The gym will be available, though, at no extra charge.<br/>
🎧 That's open all day, from six in the morning until midnight.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And the tennis courts, but there is a small additional payment for those.<br/>
🎧 We have four courts, and it's worth booking in advance if you possibly can,<br/>
🎧 as there can be quite a long waiting list for them!<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Now could we discuss the food?<br/>
🎧 This would be dinner, around seven o'clock…<br/>
<br />

🎧 Hello everyone.<br/>
🎧 I'm Jake Stevens and I'm your rep here at the hotel.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you'll all have a great time here.<br/>
🎧 So let me tell you a bit about what's on offer.<br/>
🎧 I'll start by telling you about some of the excursions that are available for guests.<br/>
🎧 One thing you have to do while you're here is go dolphin watching.<br/>
🎧 On our boat trips, we pretty well guarantee you'll see dolphins -<br/>
🎧 if you don't you can repeat the trip free of charge.<br/>
🎧 We organise daily trips for just 35 euros.<br/>
🎧 Unfortunately there aren't any places left for this afternoon's trip,<br/>
🎧 but come and see me to book for later in the week.<br/>
🎧 If you're energetic, I'd recommend our forest walk.<br/>
🎧 It's a guided walk of about seven kilometres.<br/>
🎧 There'll be a stop half way, and you'll be provided with a drink and sandwiches.<br/>
🎧 There's some fairly steep climbs up the hills,<br/>
🎧 so you need to be reasonably fit for this one,<br/>
🎧 with good shoes, and bring a waterproof in case it rains.<br/>
🎧 It's just 25 euros all inclusive, and it's every Wednesday.<br/>
🎧 Then on Thursdays we organise a cycle trip,<br/>
🎧 which will give you all the fun of biking without the effort.<br/>
🎧 We'll take you and your bike up to the top of Mount Larna,<br/>
🎧 and leave you to bike back -<br/>
🎧 it's a 700-metre drop in just 20 kilometres<br/>
🎧 so this isn't really for inexperienced cyclists as you'll be going pretty fast.<br/>
🎧 And if it's a clear day, you'll have fantastic views.<br/>
🎧 On our local craft tour you can find out about the traditional activities in the island.<br/>
🎧 And the best thing about this trip is that it's completely free.<br/>
🎧 You'll be taken to a factory where jewellery is made, and also a ceramics centre.<br/>
🎧 If you want, you can buy some of the products but that's entirely up to you.<br/>
🎧 The trip starts after lunch on Thursday, and you'll return by 6 pm.<br/>
🎧 If you're interested in astronomy you may already know that the island's one of the best places in the world to observe the night sky.<br/>
🎧 We can offer trips to the observatory on Friday for those who are interested.<br/>
🎧 They cost 90 euros per person<br/>
🎧 and you'll be shown the huge telescopes and have a talk from an expert,<br/>
🎧 who'll explain all about how they work.<br/>
🎧 Afterwards we'll head down to Sunset Beach,<br/>
🎧 where you can have a dip in the ocean if you want before we head off back to the hotel.<br/>
🎧 Finally, there's horse riding.<br/>
🎧 This is organised by the Equestrian Centre over near Playa Cortino<br/>
🎧 and it's a great experience if you're a keen horseback rider,<br/>
🎧 or even if you've never been on a horse before.<br/>
🎧 They take you down to the beach,<br/>
🎧 and you can canter along the sand and through the waves.<br/>
🎧 It costs 35 euros and it's available every day.<br/>
🎧 So there's plenty to do in the daytime, but what about night life?<br/>
🎧 Well, the number one attraction's called 'Musical Favourites'.<br/>
🎧 Guests enjoy a three-course meal and unlimited free drinks, and watch a fantastic show,<br/>
🎧 starting with musicals set in Paris and then crossing the Atlantic to Las Vegas<br/>
🎧 and finally Copacabana.<br/>
🎧 At the end the cast members come down from the stage, still in their stunning costumes,<br/>
🎧 and you'll have a chance to chat with them.<br/>
🎧 It's hugely popular, so let me know now if you're interested because it's no good leaving it until the last minute.<br/>
🎧 It's on Friday night.<br/>
🎧 Tickets are just 50 euros each, but for an extra 10 euros you can have a table right by the stage.<br/>
🎧 If you'd like to go back in time, there's the Castle Feast on Saturday evening.<br/>
🎧 It's held in a twelfth-century castle, and you eat in the great courtyard,<br/>
🎧 with ladies in long gowns serving your food.<br/>
🎧 You're given a whole chicken each, which you eat in the medieval way, using your hands instead of cutlery,<br/>
🎧 and you're entertained by competitions where the horseback riders attempt to knock one another off their horses.<br/>
🎧 Then you can watch the dancers in the ballroom and join in as well if you want.<br/>
🎧 OK, so now if anyone…<br/>
<br />

🎧 Hello, Trevor.<br/>
🎧 Hello, Stephanie.<br/>
🎧 You said you wanted to talk about the course I'm taking on literature for children.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 I'm thinking of doing it next year, but I'd like to find out more about it first.<br/>
🎧 OK, well, as you probably know, it's a one-year course.<br/>
🎧 It's divided into six modules, and you have to take all of them.<br/>
🎧 One of the most interesting ones, for me, at least,<br/>
🎧 was about the purpose of children's literature.<br/>
🎧 You mean, whether it should just entertain children or should be educational, as well.<br/>
🎧 Right, and whether the teaching should be factual - giving them information about the world - or ethical, teaching them values.<br/>
🎧 What's fascinating is that the writer isn't necessarily conscious of the message they're conveying.<br/>
🎧 For instance, a story might show a child who has a problem as a result of not doing what an adult has told them to do,<br/>
🎧 implying that children should always obey adults.<br/>
🎧 Ah... I see what you mean.<br/>
🎧 That module made me realise how important stories are -<br/>
🎧 they can have a significant effect on children as they grow up.<br/>
🎧 Actually, it inspired me to have a go at it myself, just for my own interest.<br/>
🎧 I know I can't compete with the really popular stories, like the Harry Potter books - they're very good,<br/>
🎧 and even young kids like my seven-year-old niece love reading them.<br/>
🎧 I'm very interested in illustrations in stories.<br/>
🎧 Is that covered in the course?<br/>
🎧 Yes, there's a module on pictures,<br/>
🎧 and how they're sometimes central to the story.<br/>
🎧 Mm.. that's good.<br/>
🎧 I remember some frightening ones I saw as a child and I can still see them vividly in my mind, years later!<br/>
🎧 Pictures can be so powerful, just as powerful as words.<br/>
🎧 I've always enjoyed drawing, so that's the field I want to go into when I finish the course.<br/>
🎧 I bet that module will be really helpful.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure it will.<br/>
🎧 We also studied comics in that module,<br/>
🎧 but I'm not convinced of their value, not compared with books.<br/>
🎧 One of the great things about words is that you use your imagination,<br/>
🎧 but with a comic you don't have to.<br/>
🎧 But children are so used to visual input - on TV, video games, and so on.<br/>
🎧 There are plenty of kids who wouldn't even try to read a book,<br/>
🎧 so I think comics can serve a really useful purpose.<br/>
🎧 You mean, it's better to read a comic than not to read at all?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I suppose you're right.<br/>
🎧 I just think its sad when children don't read books.<br/>
🎧 What about books for girls and books for boys?<br/>
🎧 Does the course go into that?<br/>
🎧 Yes, there's a module on it.<br/>
🎧 For years, lots of stories, in English, at least, assumed that boys went out and did adventurous things<br/>
🎧 and girls stayed at home and played with dolls.<br/>
🎧 I was amazed how many books were targeted at just one sex or the other.<br/>
🎧 Of course this reflects society as it is when the books are written.<br/>
🎧 That's true.<br/>
🎧 So it sounds as though you think it's a good course.<br/>
🎧 Definitely.<br/>
🎧 Have you been reading lots of children's stories, to help you decide whether to take the course?<br/>
🎧 Yeah. I've gone as far back as the late seventeenth century,<br/>
🎧 though I know there were earlier children's stories.<br/>
🎧 So does that mean you've read Perrault's fairy tales?<br/>
🎧 Cinderella, The Sleeping Beauty, and so on.<br/>
🎧 Yes!<br/>
🎧 They must be important, because no stories of that type had been written before,<br/>
🎧 these were the first.<br/>
🎧 Then there's The Swiss Family Robinson.<br/>
🎧 I haven't read that.<br/>
🎧 The English name makes it sound as though Robinson is the family's surname,<br/>
🎧 but a more accurate translation would be The Swiss Robinsons,<br/>
🎧 because it's about a Swiss family who are shipwrecked,<br/>
🎧 like Robinson Crusoe in the novel of a century earlier.<br/>
🎧 Well I never knew that!<br/>
🎧 Have you read Hoffmann's The Nutcracker and the Mouse King?<br/>
🎧 Wasn't that the basis for Tchaikovsky's ballet The Nutcracker?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 It has some quite bizarre elements.<br/>
🎧 I hope you've read Oscar Wilde's The Happy Prince.<br/>
🎧 It's probably my favourite children's story of all time.<br/>
🎧 Oh.. mine too!<br/>
🎧 And it's so surprising, because Wilde is best known for his plays,<br/>
🎧 and most of them are very witty, but The Happy Prince is really moving.<br/>
🎧 I struggled with Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings...<br/>
🎧 three long books, and I gave up after one.<br/>
🎧 It's extremely popular, though.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, but whereas something like The Happy Prince just carried me along with it,<br/>
🎧 The Lord of the Rings took more effort than I was prepared to give it.<br/>
🎧 I didn't find that - I love it.<br/>
🎧 Another one I've read is War Horse.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes. It's about the First World War, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Hardly what you'd expect for a children's story.<br/>
🎧 Exactly, but it's been very successful.<br/>
🎧 Have you read any…<br/>
<br />

🎧 In today's class I'm going to talk about marine archaeology,<br/>
🎧 the branch of archaeology focusing on human interaction with the sea, lakes and rivers.<br/>
🎧 It's the study of ships, cargoes, shipping facilities, and other physical remains.<br/>
🎧 I'll give you an example,<br/>
🎧 then go on to show how this type of research is being transformed by the use of the latest technology.<br/>
🎧 Atlit-Yam was a village on the coast of the eastern Mediterranean,<br/>
🎧 which seems to have been thriving until around 7,000 BC.<br/>
🎧 The residents kept cattle, caught fish and stored grain.<br/>
🎧 They had wells for fresh water,<br/>
🎧 many of their houses were built around a courtyard and were constructed of stone.<br/>
🎧 The village contained an impressive monument:<br/>
🎧 seven half-tonne stones standing in a semicircle around a spring,<br/>
🎧 that might have been used for ceremonial purposes.<br/>
🎧 Atlit-Yam may have been destroyed swiftly by a tsunami,<br/>
🎧 or climate change may have caused glaciers to melt and sea levels to rise, flooding the village gradually.<br/>
🎧 Whatever the cause, it now lies ten metres below the surface of the Mediterranean,<br/>
🎧 buried under sand at the bottom of the sea.<br/>
🎧 It's been described as the largest and best preserved prehistoric settlement ever found on the seabed.<br/>
🎧 For marine archaeologists, Atlit-Yam is a treasure trove.<br/>
🎧 Research on the buildings, tools and the human remains has revealed how the bustling village once functioned,<br/>
🎧 and even what diseases some of its residents suffered from.<br/>
🎧 But of course this is only one small village, one window into a lost world.<br/>
🎧 For a fuller picture, researchers need more sunken settlements,<br/>
🎧 but the hard part is finding them.<br/>
🎧 Underwater research used to require divers to find shipwrecks or artefacts,<br/>
🎧 but in the second half of the twentieth century, various types of underwater vehicles were developed,<br/>
🎧 some controlled from a ship on the surface, and some of them autonomous,<br/>
🎧 which means they don't need to be operated by a person.<br/>
🎧 Autonomous underwater vehicles, or AUVs,<br/>
🎧 are used in the oil industry, for instance, to create maps of the seabed before rigs and pipelines are installed.<br/>
🎧 To navigate they use sensors, such as compasses and sonar.<br/>
🎧 Until relatively recently they were very expensive, and so heavy that they had to be launched from a large vessel with a winch.<br/>
🎧 But the latest AUVs are much easier to manoeuvre -<br/>
🎧 they can be launched from the shore or a small ship.<br/>
🎧 And they're much cheaper, which makes them more accessible to research teams.<br/>
🎧 They're also very sophisticated.<br/>
🎧 They can communicate with each other and, for example,<br/>
🎧 work out the most efficient way to survey a site,<br/>
🎧 or to find particular objects on the seabed.<br/>
🎧 Field tests show the approach can work.<br/>
🎧 For example, in a trial in 2015,<br/>
🎧 three AUVs searched for wrecks at Marzamemi, off the coast of Sicily.<br/>
🎧 The site is the final resting place of an ancient Roman ship,<br/>
🎧 which sank in the sixth century AD<br/>
🎧 while ferrying prefabricated marble elements for the construction of an early church.<br/>
🎧 The AUVs mapped the area in detail, finding other ships carrying columns of the same material.<br/>
🎧 Creating an internet in the sea for AUVs to communicate is no easy matter.<br/>
🎧 Wifi networks on land use electromagnetic waves,<br/>
🎧 but in water these will only travel a few centimetres.<br/>
🎧 Instead, a more complex mix of technologies is required.<br/>
🎧 For short distances, AUVs can share data using light,<br/>
🎧 while acoustic waves are used to communicate over long distances.<br/>
🎧 But more creative solutions are also being developed,<br/>
🎧 where an AUV working on the seabed offloads data to a second AUV,<br/>
🎧 which then surfaces and beams the data home to the research team using a satellite.<br/>
🎧 There's also a system that enables AUVs to share information from seabed scans, and other data.<br/>
🎧 So if an AUV surveying the seabed finds an intriguing object,<br/>
🎧 it can share the coordinates of the object - that is, its position -<br/>
🎧 with a nearby AUV that carries superior cameras,<br/>
🎧 and arrange for that AUV to make a closer inspection of the object.<br/>
🎧 Marine archaeologists are excited about the huge potential of these AUVs for their discipline.<br/>
🎧 One site where they're going to be deployed is the Gulf of Baratti, off the Italian coast.<br/>
🎧 In 1974, a 2,000-year-old Roman vessel was discovered here, in 18 metres of water.<br/>
🎧 When it sank, it was carrying medical goods, in wooden or tin receptacles.<br/>
🎧 Its cargo gives us insight into the treatments available all those years ago,<br/>
🎧 including tablets that are thought to have been dissolved to form a cleansing liquid for the eyes.<br/>
🎧 Other Roman ships went down nearby, taking their cargoes with them.<br/>
🎧 Some held huge pots made of terracotta.<br/>
🎧 Some were used for transporting cargoes of olive oil, and others held wine.<br/>
🎧 In many cases it's only these containers that remain,<br/>
🎧 while the wooden ships have been buried under silt on the seabed.<br/>
🎧 Another project...<br/>
<br/><br/>
