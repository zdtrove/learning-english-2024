🎧 Good morning, <span>Clare</span> House <span>Hotel</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Andrew</span> <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm the <span>Events</span> <span>Manager</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good morning, <span>Andrew</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>name's</span> <span>Samantha</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>arranging</span> a <span>party</span> for my <span>parents'</span> <span>fiftieth</span> <span>wedding</span> <span>anniversary</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I'm <span>ringing</span> to ask about <span>hiring</span> a room some time next <span>September</span>.<br/>
🎧 Also my <span>parents</span> and <span>several</span> of the <span>guests</span> will need <span>accommodation</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, I'm sure we can help you with that.<br/>
🎧 Will you be having a <span>sit-down</span> <span>meal</span> or a <span>buffet</span>?<br/>
🎧 Probably a <span>sit-down</span>.<br/>
🎧 And do you know how many people <span>there'll</span> be?<br/>
🎧 Around <span>eighty</span>, I think.<br/>
🎧 Well we have two <span>rooms</span> that can <span>hold</span> that number.<br/>
🎧 One is the <span>Adelphi</span> Room.<br/>
🎧 That can <span>seat</span> <span>85</span>, or <span>hold</span> over a <span>hundred</span> if people are <span>standing</span> for a <span>buffet</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 If you have live music, there's room for <span>four</span> or <span>five</span> <span>musicians</span> in the <span>gallery</span> <span>overlooking</span> the room.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>guests</span> usually <span>appreciate</span> the <span>fact</span> that the music can be <span>loud</span> enough for <span>dancing</span>,<br/>
🎧 but not too <span>loud</span> for <span>conversation</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I really don't like it when you can't talk.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 Now the <span>Adelphi</span> Room is at the back of the <span>hotel</span>,<br/>
🎧 and there are <span>French</span> <span>windows</span> <span>leading</span> out <span>onto</span> the <span>terrace</span>.<br/>
🎧 This has a <span>beautiful</span> <span>display</span> of <span>pots</span> of <span>roses</span> at that time of the year.<br/>
🎧 Which <span>direction</span> does it <span>face</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Southwest</span>,<br/>
🎧 so that side of the <span>hotel</span> <span>gets</span> the sun in the <span>afternoon</span> and <span>early</span> <span>evening</span>.<br/>
🎧 Very nice.<br/>
🎧 From the <span>terrace</span> you can see the <span>area</span> of <span>trees</span> <span>within</span> the <span>grounds</span> of the <span>hotel</span>,<br/>
🎧 or you can <span>stroll</span> through there to the <span>river</span> <span>-</span> that's on the <span>far</span> side,<br/>
🎧 so it isn't <span>visible</span> from the <span>hotel</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Then another option is the <span>Carlton</span> Room.<br/>
🎧 This is a bit <span>bigger</span> <span>-</span> it can <span>hold</span> up to <span>110</span> <span>people<br/></span>
🎧 and it has the <span>advantage</span> of a <span>stage</span>, which is <span>useful</span> if you have any <span>entertainment</span>,<br/>
🎧 or <span>indeed</span> a small <span>band</span> can fit <span>onto</span> it.<br/>
🎧 And can you go outside from the room?<br/>
🎧 No, the <span>Carlton</span> Room is on the first <span>floor</span>,<br/>
🎧 but on one side the <span>windows</span> look out <span>onto</span> the <span>lake</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Lovely</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think either of those <span>rooms</span> would be <span>suitable</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can I tell you about some of the options we <span>offer</span> in <span>addition</span>?<br/>
🎧 Please do.<br/>
🎧 As well as a <span>meal</span>, you can have an <span>MC</span>, a <span>Master</span> of <span>Ceremonies</span>,<br/>
🎧 who'll be with you <span>throughout</span> the <span>party</span>.<br/>
🎧 What exactly is the <span>MC's</span> <span>function</span>?<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> they make a <span>speech</span> during the <span>meal</span> if we need one, do they?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 All our <span>MCs</span> are <span>trained</span> as <span>public</span> <span>speakers</span>,<br/>
🎧 so they can <span>easily</span> get <span>people's</span> <span>attention</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 many <span>guests</span> are glad to have <span>someone</span> who can make <span>themselves</span> heard <span>above</span> the <span>chatter</span>!<br/>
🎧 And they're also your <span>support</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 if anything <span>goes</span> wrong, the <span>MC</span> will <span>deal</span> with it, so you can <span>relax</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great!<br/>
🎧 I'll need to ask you about food,<br/>
🎧 but something else that's important is <span>accommodation</span>.<br/>
🎧 You <span>obviously</span> have <span>rooms</span> in the <span>hotel</span>,<br/>
🎧 but do you also have any other <span>accommodation</span>, like <span>cabins</span>, for example?<br/>
🎧 Yes, there are <span>five</span> in the <span>grounds</span>, all <span>self-contained</span>.<br/>
🎧 They each <span>sleep</span> two to <span>four</span> people and have their own living room, <span>bathroom</span> and small <span>kitchen</span>.<br/>
🎧 That sounds perfect for what we'll need.<br/>
🎧 Now you have <span>various</span> <span>facilities</span>, don't you?<br/>
🎧 Are they all <span>included</span> in the <span>price</span> of <span>hiring</span> the room?<br/>
🎧 The <span>pool</span>, for <span>instance</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Normally</span> you'd be able to use it,<br/>
🎧 but it'll be <span>closed</span> <span>throughout</span> <span>September</span> for <span>refurbishment</span>, I'm <span>afraid</span>.<br/>
🎧 The gym will be <span>available</span>, though, at no <span>extra</span> <span>charge</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's open all day, from six in the morning until <span>midnight</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>tennis</span> <span>courts</span>, but there is a small <span>additional</span> <span>payment</span> for those.<br/>
🎧 We have <span>four</span> <span>courts</span>, and it's <span>worth</span> <span>booking</span> in <span>advance</span> if you <span>possibly</span> can,<br/>
🎧 as there can be quite a long <span>waiting</span> <span>list</span> for them!<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Now could we <span>discuss</span> the food?<br/>
🎧 This would be dinner, around <span>seven</span> <span>o'clock…<br/></span>
<br />

🎧 Hello everyone.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>Jake</span> <span>Stevens</span> and I'm your <span>rep</span> here at the <span>hotel</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you'll all have a great time here.<br/>
🎧 So let me tell you a bit about what's on <span>offer</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll start by <span>telling</span> you about some of the <span>excursions</span> that are <span>available</span> for <span>guests</span>.<br/>
🎧 One thing you have to do while you're here is go <span>dolphin</span> watching.<br/>
🎧 On our <span>boat</span> <span>trips</span>, we <span>pretty</span> well <span>guarantee</span> you'll see <span>dolphins</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 if you don't you can <span>repeat</span> the <span>trip</span> free of <span>charge</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>organise</span> <span>daily</span> <span>trips</span> for just <span>35</span> <span>euros</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Unfortunately</span> there aren't any <span>places</span> <span>left</span> for this <span>afternoon's</span> <span>trip</span>,<br/>
🎧 but come and see me to book for later in the week.<br/>
🎧 If you're <span>energetic</span>, I'd <span>recommend</span> our <span>forest</span> <span>walk</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>guided</span> <span>walk</span> of about <span>seven</span> <span>kilometres</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>There'll</span> be a <span>stop</span> <span>half</span> way, and you'll be <span>provided</span> with a drink and <span>sandwiches</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's some <span>fairly</span> <span>steep</span> <span>climbs</span> up the <span>hills</span>,<br/>
🎧 so you need to be <span>reasonably</span> fit for this one,<br/>
🎧 with good <span>shoes</span>, and <span>bring</span> a <span>waterproof</span> in case it <span>rains</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's just <span>25</span> <span>euros</span> all <span>inclusive</span>, and it's every <span>Wednesday</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then on <span>Thursdays</span> we <span>organise</span> a <span>cycle</span> <span>trip</span>,<br/>
🎧 which will give you all the fun of <span>biking</span> without the <span>effort</span>.<br/>
🎧 We'll take you and your <span>bike</span> up to the top of <span>Mount</span> <span>Larna</span>,<br/>
🎧 and leave you to <span>bike</span> back <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it's a <span>700-metre</span> <span>drop</span> in just <span>20</span> <span>kilometres<br/></span>
🎧 so this isn't really for <span>inexperienced</span> <span>cyclists</span> as you'll be going <span>pretty</span> <span>fast</span>.<br/>
🎧 And if it's a <span>clear</span> day, you'll have <span>fantastic</span> <span>views</span>.<br/>
🎧 On our <span>local</span> <span>craft</span> <span>tour</span> you can find out about the <span>traditional</span> <span>activities</span> in the <span>island</span>.<br/>
🎧 And the best thing about this <span>trip</span> is that it's <span>completely</span> free.<br/>
🎧 You'll be taken to a <span>factory</span> where <span>jewellery</span> is made, and also a <span>ceramics</span> <span>centre</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you want, you can buy some of the <span>products</span> but that's <span>entirely</span> up to you.<br/>
🎧 The <span>trip</span> <span>starts</span> after lunch on <span>Thursday</span>, and you'll <span>return</span> by <span>6</span> pm.<br/>
🎧 If you're interested in <span>astronomy</span> you may already know that the <span>island's</span> one of the best <span>places</span> in the <span>world</span> to <span>observe</span> the <span>night</span> sky.<br/>
🎧 We can <span>offer</span> <span>trips</span> to the <span>observatory</span> on <span>Friday</span> for those who are interested.<br/>
🎧 They <span>cost</span> <span>90</span> <span>euros</span> <span>per</span> <span>person<br/></span>
🎧 and you'll be <span>shown</span> the <span>huge</span> <span>telescopes</span> and have a talk from an <span>expert</span>,<br/>
🎧 who'll <span>explain</span> all about how they work.<br/>
🎧 <span>Afterwards</span> we'll <span>head</span> down to <span>Sunset</span> <span>Beach</span>,<br/>
🎧 where you can have a <span>dip</span> in the <span>ocean</span> if you want before we <span>head</span> off back to the <span>hotel</span>.<br/>
🎧 Finally, there's <span>horse</span> <span>riding</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is <span>organised</span> by the <span>Equestrian</span> <span>Centre</span> over near <span>Playa</span> <span>Cortino<br/></span>
🎧 and it's a great <span>experience</span> if you're a <span>keen</span> <span>horseback</span> <span>rider</span>,<br/>
🎧 or even if you've never been on a <span>horse</span> before.<br/>
🎧 They take you down to the <span>beach</span>,<br/>
🎧 and you can <span>canter</span> along the <span>sand</span> and through the <span>waves</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>costs</span> <span>35</span> <span>euros</span> and it's <span>available</span> every day.<br/>
🎧 So there's <span>plenty</span> to do in the <span>daytime</span>, but what about <span>night</span> life?<br/>
🎧 Well, the number one <span>attraction's</span> called <span>'Musical</span> <span>Favourites'</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Guests</span> enjoy a <span>three-course</span> <span>meal</span> and <span>unlimited</span> free <span>drinks</span>, and <span>watch</span> a <span>fantastic</span> show,<br/>
🎧 <span>starting</span> with <span>musicals</span> set in <span>Paris</span> and then <span>crossing</span> the <span>Atlantic</span> to <span>Las</span> <span>Vegas<br/></span>
🎧 and finally <span>Copacabana</span>.<br/>
🎧 At the end the <span>cast</span> <span>members</span> come down from the <span>stage</span>, still in their <span>stunning</span> <span>costumes</span>,<br/>
🎧 and you'll have a <span>chance</span> to <span>chat</span> with them.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>hugely</span> <span>popular</span>, so let me know now if you're interested because it's no good <span>leaving</span> it until the last <span>minute</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's on <span>Friday</span> <span>night</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Tickets</span> are just <span>50</span> <span>euros</span> each, but for an <span>extra</span> <span>10</span> <span>euros</span> you can have a <span>table</span> right by the <span>stage</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you'd like to go back in time, there's the <span>Castle</span> <span>Feast</span> on <span>Saturday</span> <span>evening</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>held</span> in a <span>twelfth-century</span> <span>castle</span>, and you eat in the great <span>courtyard</span>,<br/>
🎧 with <span>ladies</span> in long <span>gowns</span> <span>serving</span> your food.<br/>
🎧 You're <span>given</span> a whole <span>chicken</span> each, which you eat in the <span>medieval</span> way, <span>using</span> your <span>hands</span> <span>instead</span> of <span>cutlery</span>,<br/>
🎧 and you're <span>entertained</span> by <span>competitions</span> where the <span>horseback</span> <span>riders</span> <span>attempt</span> to <span>knock</span> one another off their <span>horses</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then you can <span>watch</span> the <span>dancers</span> in the <span>ballroom</span> and join in as well if you want.<br/>
🎧 OK, so now if <span>anyone…<br/></span>
<br />

🎧 Hello, <span>Trevor</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hello, <span>Stephanie</span>.<br/>
🎧 You said you wanted to talk about the course I'm taking on <span>literature</span> for children.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 I'm thinking of doing it next year, but I'd like to find out more about it first.<br/>
🎧 OK, well, as you probably know, it's a <span>one-year</span> course.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>divided</span> into six <span>modules</span>, and you have to take all of them.<br/>
🎧 One of the most <span>interesting</span> <span>ones</span>, for me, at <span>least</span>,<br/>
🎧 was about the <span>purpose</span> of <span>children's</span> <span>literature</span>.<br/>
🎧 You mean, <span>whether</span> it should just <span>entertain</span> children or should be <span>educational</span>, as well.<br/>
🎧 Right, and <span>whether</span> the <span>teaching</span> should be <span>factual</span> <span>-</span> <span>giving</span> them <span>information</span> about the <span>world</span> <span>-</span> or <span>ethical</span>, <span>teaching</span> them <span>values</span>.<br/>
🎧 What's <span>fascinating</span> is that the <span>writer</span> isn't <span>necessarily</span> <span>conscious</span> of the <span>message</span> they're <span>conveying</span>.<br/>
🎧 For <span>instance</span>, a <span>story</span> might show a <span>child</span> who has a <span>problem</span> as a <span>result</span> of not doing what an <span>adult</span> has told them to do,<br/>
🎧 <span>implying</span> that children should always <span>obey</span> <span>adults</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ah..</span>. I see what you mean.<br/>
🎧 That <span>module</span> made me <span>realise</span> how important <span>stories</span> are <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 they can have a <span>significant</span> <span>effect</span> on children as they <span>grow</span> up.<br/>
🎧 Actually, it <span>inspired</span> me to have a go at it myself, just for my own <span>interest</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know I can't <span>compete</span> with the really <span>popular</span> <span>stories</span>, like the <span>Harry</span> <span>Potter</span> books <span>-</span> they're very good,<br/>
🎧 and even young <span>kids</span> like my <span>seven-year-old</span> <span>niece</span> love <span>reading</span> them.<br/>
🎧 I'm very interested in <span>illustrations</span> in <span>stories</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is that <span>covered</span> in the course?<br/>
🎧 Yes, there's a <span>module</span> on <span>pictures</span>,<br/>
🎧 and how they're sometimes <span>central</span> to the <span>story</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mm.</span>. that's good.<br/>
🎧 I remember some <span>frightening</span> <span>ones</span> I saw as a <span>child</span> and I can still see them <span>vividly</span> in my <span>mind</span>, years later!<br/>
🎧 <span>Pictures</span> can be so <span>powerful</span>, just as <span>powerful</span> as <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've always <span>enjoyed</span> <span>drawing</span>, so that's the <span>field</span> I want to go into when I <span>finish</span> the course.<br/>
🎧 I bet that <span>module</span> will be really <span>helpful</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure it will.<br/>
🎧 We also <span>studied</span> <span>comics</span> in that <span>module</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I'm not <span>convinced</span> of their <span>value</span>, not <span>compared</span> with books.<br/>
🎧 One of the great things about <span>words</span> is that you use your <span>imagination</span>,<br/>
🎧 but with a <span>comic</span> you don't have to.<br/>
🎧 But children are so used to <span>visual</span> <span>input</span> <span>-</span> on <span>TV</span>, <span>video</span> <span>games</span>, and so on.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>plenty</span> of <span>kids</span> who wouldn't even try to read a book,<br/>
🎧 so I think <span>comics</span> can <span>serve</span> a really <span>useful</span> <span>purpose</span>.<br/>
🎧 You mean, it's better to read a <span>comic</span> than not to read at all?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I <span>suppose</span> you're right.<br/>
🎧 I just think its sad when children don't read books.<br/>
🎧 What about books for girls and books for <span>boys</span>?<br/>
🎧 Does the course go into that?<br/>
🎧 Yes, there's a <span>module</span> on it.<br/>
🎧 For years, lots of <span>stories</span>, in English, at <span>least</span>, <span>assumed</span> that <span>boys</span> went out and did <span>adventurous</span> <span>things<br/></span>
🎧 and girls <span>stayed</span> at home and <span>played</span> with <span>dolls</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>amazed</span> how many books were <span>targeted</span> at just one <span>sex</span> or the other.<br/>
🎧 Of course this <span>reflects</span> <span>society</span> as it is when the books are <span>written</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>true</span>.<br/>
🎧 So it sounds as though you think it's a good course.<br/>
🎧 Definitely.<br/>
🎧 Have you been <span>reading</span> lots of <span>children's</span> <span>stories</span>, to help you decide <span>whether</span> to take the course?<br/>
🎧 Yeah. I've <span>gone</span> as <span>far</span> back as the <span>late</span> <span>seventeenth</span> <span>century</span>,<br/>
🎧 though I know there were <span>earlier</span> <span>children's</span> <span>stories</span>.<br/>
🎧 So does that mean you've read <span>Perrault's</span> <span>fairy</span> <span>tales</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Cinderella</span>, The <span>Sleeping</span> <span>Beauty</span>, and so on.<br/>
🎧 Yes!<br/>
🎧 They must be important, because no <span>stories</span> of that <span>type</span> had been <span>written</span> before,<br/>
🎧 these were the first.<br/>
🎧 Then there's The <span>Swiss</span> <span>Family</span> <span>Robinson</span>.<br/>
🎧 I haven't read that.<br/>
🎧 The English name makes it sound as though <span>Robinson</span> is the <span>family's</span> <span>surname</span>,<br/>
🎧 but a more <span>accurate</span> <span>translation</span> would be The <span>Swiss</span> <span>Robinsons</span>,<br/>
🎧 because it's about a <span>Swiss</span> <span>family</span> who are <span>shipwrecked</span>,<br/>
🎧 like <span>Robinson</span> <span>Crusoe</span> in the <span>novel</span> of a <span>century</span> <span>earlier</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well I never <span>knew</span> that!<br/>
🎧 Have you read <span>Hoffmann's</span> The <span>Nutcracker</span> and the <span>Mouse</span> <span>King</span>?<br/>
🎧 Wasn't that the <span>basis</span> for <span>Tchaikovsky's</span> <span>ballet</span> The <span>Nutcracker</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 It has some quite <span>bizarre</span> <span>elements</span>.<br/>
🎧 I hope you've read <span>Oscar</span> <span>Wilde's</span> The Happy <span>Prince</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's probably my <span>favourite</span> <span>children's</span> <span>story</span> of all time.<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh.</span>. <span>mine</span> too!<br/>
🎧 And it's so <span>surprising</span>, because <span>Wilde</span> is best <span>known</span> for his <span>plays</span>,<br/>
🎧 and most of them are very <span>witty</span>, but The Happy <span>Prince</span> is really <span>moving</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>struggled</span> with <span>Tolkien's</span> The <span>Lord</span> of the <span>Rings..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>three</span> long books, and I gave up after one.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>extremely</span> <span>popular</span>, though.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, but <span>whereas</span> something like The Happy <span>Prince</span> just <span>carried</span> me along with it,<br/>
🎧 The <span>Lord</span> of the <span>Rings</span> took more <span>effort</span> than I was <span>prepared</span> to give it.<br/>
🎧 I didn't find that <span>-</span> I love it.<br/>
🎧 Another one I've read is War <span>Horse</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes. It's about the First <span>World</span> War, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 <span>Hardly</span> what you'd <span>expect</span> for a <span>children's</span> <span>story</span>.<br/>
🎧 Exactly, but it's been very <span>successful</span>.<br/>
🎧 Have you read <span>any…<br/></span>

🎧 In <span>today's</span> class I'm going to talk about <span>marine</span> <span>archaeology</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>branch</span> of <span>archaeology</span> <span>focusing</span> on <span>human</span> <span>interaction</span> with the sea, <span>lakes</span> and <span>rivers</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's the <span>study</span> of <span>ships</span>, <span>cargoes</span>, <span>shipping</span> <span>facilities</span>, and other <span>physical</span> <span>remains</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll give you an example,<br/>
🎧 then go on to show how this <span>type</span> of <span>research</span> is being <span>transformed</span> by the use of the <span>latest</span> <span>technology</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Atlit-Yam</span> was a <span>village</span> on the <span>coast</span> of the <span>eastern</span> <span>Mediterranean</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>seems</span> to have been <span>thriving</span> until around <span>7,000</span> <span>BC</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>residents</span> <span>kept</span> <span>cattle</span>, <span>caught</span> <span>fish</span> and <span>stored</span> <span>grain</span>.<br/>
🎧 They had <span>wells</span> for <span>fresh</span> water,<br/>
🎧 many of their <span>houses</span> were <span>built</span> around a <span>courtyard</span> and were <span>constructed</span> of <span>stone</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>village</span> <span>contained</span> an <span>impressive</span> <span>monument</span>:<br/>
🎧 <span>seven</span> <span>half-tonne</span> <span>stones</span> <span>standing</span> in a <span>semicircle</span> around a <span>spring</span>,<br/>
🎧 that might have been used for <span>ceremonial</span> <span>purposes</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Atlit-Yam</span> may have been <span>destroyed</span> <span>swiftly</span> by a <span>tsunami</span>,<br/>
🎧 or <span>climate</span> change may have <span>caused</span> <span>glaciers</span> to <span>melt</span> and sea <span>levels</span> to <span>rise</span>, <span>flooding</span> the <span>village</span> <span>gradually</span>.<br/>
🎧 Whatever the <span>cause</span>, it now <span>lies</span> ten <span>metres</span> <span>below</span> the <span>surface</span> of the <span>Mediterranean</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>buried</span> under <span>sand</span> at the <span>bottom</span> of the sea.<br/>
🎧 It's been <span>described</span> as the <span>largest</span> and best <span>preserved</span> <span>prehistoric</span> <span>settlement</span> ever <span>found</span> on the <span>seabed</span>.<br/>
🎧 For <span>marine</span> <span>archaeologists</span>, <span>Atlit-Yam</span> is a <span>treasure</span> <span>trove</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Research</span> on the <span>buildings</span>, <span>tools</span> and the <span>human</span> <span>remains</span> has <span>revealed</span> how the <span>bustling</span> <span>village</span> once <span>functioned</span>,<br/>
🎧 and even what <span>diseases</span> some of its <span>residents</span> <span>suffered</span> from.<br/>
🎧 But of course this is only one small <span>village</span>, one <span>window</span> into a <span>lost</span> <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 For a <span>fuller</span> <span>picture</span>, <span>researchers</span> need more <span>sunken</span> <span>settlements</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>hard</span> <span>part</span> is <span>finding</span> them.<br/>
🎧 <span>Underwater</span> <span>research</span> used to <span>require</span> <span>divers</span> to find <span>shipwrecks</span> or <span>artefacts</span>,<br/>
🎧 but in the second <span>half</span> of the <span>twentieth</span> <span>century</span>, <span>various</span> <span>types</span> of <span>underwater</span> <span>vehicles</span> were <span>developed</span>,<br/>
🎧 some <span>controlled</span> from a <span>ship</span> on the <span>surface</span>, and some of them <span>autonomous</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>means</span> they don't need to be <span>operated</span> by a person.<br/>
🎧 <span>Autonomous</span> <span>underwater</span> <span>vehicles</span>, or <span>AUVs</span>,<br/>
🎧 are used in the oil <span>industry</span>, for <span>instance</span>, to <span>create</span> <span>maps</span> of the <span>seabed</span> before <span>rigs</span> and <span>pipelines</span> are <span>installed</span>.<br/>
🎧 To <span>navigate</span> they use <span>sensors</span>, such as <span>compasses</span> and <span>sonar</span>.<br/>
🎧 Until <span>relatively</span> <span>recently</span> they were very <span>expensive</span>, and so <span>heavy</span> that they had to be <span>launched</span> from a large <span>vessel</span> with a <span>winch</span>.<br/>
🎧 But the <span>latest</span> <span>AUVs</span> are much <span>easier</span> to <span>manoeuvre</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 they can be <span>launched</span> from the <span>shore</span> or a small <span>ship</span>.<br/>
🎧 And they're much <span>cheaper</span>, which makes them more <span>accessible</span> to <span>research</span> <span>teams</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're also very <span>sophisticated</span>.<br/>
🎧 They can <span>communicate</span> with each other and, for example,<br/>
🎧 work out the most <span>efficient</span> way to <span>survey</span> a <span>site</span>,<br/>
🎧 or to find <span>particular</span> <span>objects</span> on the <span>seabed</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Field</span> <span>tests</span> show the <span>approach</span> can work.<br/>
🎧 For example, in a <span>trial</span> in <span>2015</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>three</span> <span>AUVs</span> <span>searched</span> for <span>wrecks</span> at <span>Marzamemi</span>, off the <span>coast</span> of <span>Sicily</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>site</span> is the <span>final</span> <span>resting</span> place of an <span>ancient</span> <span>Roman</span> <span>ship</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>sank</span> in the <span>sixth</span> <span>century</span> <span>AD<br/></span>
🎧 while <span>ferrying</span> <span>prefabricated</span> <span>marble</span> <span>elements</span> for the <span>construction</span> of an <span>early</span> <span>church</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>AUVs</span> <span>mapped</span> the <span>area</span> in <span>detail</span>, <span>finding</span> other <span>ships</span> <span>carrying</span> <span>columns</span> of the same <span>material</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Creating</span> an <span>internet</span> in the sea for <span>AUVs</span> to <span>communicate</span> is no easy <span>matter</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Wifi</span> <span>networks</span> on <span>land</span> use <span>electromagnetic</span> <span>waves</span>,<br/>
🎧 but in water these will only travel a few <span>centimetres</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Instead</span>, a more <span>complex</span> mix of <span>technologies</span> is <span>required</span>.<br/>
🎧 For short <span>distances</span>, <span>AUVs</span> can share <span>data</span> <span>using</span> <span>light</span>,<br/>
🎧 while <span>acoustic</span> <span>waves</span> are used to <span>communicate</span> over long <span>distances</span>.<br/>
🎧 But more <span>creative</span> <span>solutions</span> are also being <span>developed</span>,<br/>
🎧 where an <span>AUV</span> working on the <span>seabed</span> <span>offloads</span> <span>data</span> to a second <span>AUV</span>,<br/>
🎧 which then <span>surfaces</span> and <span>beams</span> the <span>data</span> home to the <span>research</span> <span>team</span> <span>using</span> a <span>satellite</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's also a <span>system</span> that <span>enables</span> <span>AUVs</span> to share <span>information</span> from <span>seabed</span> <span>scans</span>, and other <span>data</span>.<br/>
🎧 So if an <span>AUV</span> <span>surveying</span> the <span>seabed</span> <span>finds</span> an <span>intriguing</span> <span>object</span>,<br/>
🎧 it can share the <span>coordinates</span> of the <span>object</span> <span>-</span> that is, its <span>position</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 with a <span>nearby</span> <span>AUV</span> that <span>carries</span> <span>superior</span> <span>cameras</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>arrange</span> for that <span>AUV</span> to make a <span>closer</span> <span>inspection</span> of the <span>object</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Marine</span> <span>archaeologists</span> are <span>excited</span> about the <span>huge</span> <span>potential</span> of these <span>AUVs</span> for their <span>discipline</span>.<br/>
🎧 One <span>site</span> where they're going to be <span>deployed</span> is the <span>Gulf</span> of <span>Baratti</span>, off the <span>Italian</span> <span>coast</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>1974</span>, a <span>2,000-year-old</span> <span>Roman</span> <span>vessel</span> was <span>discovered</span> here, in <span>18</span> <span>metres</span> of water.<br/>
🎧 When it <span>sank</span>, it was <span>carrying</span> <span>medical</span> <span>goods</span>, in <span>wooden</span> or <span>tin</span> <span>receptacles</span>.<br/>
🎧 Its <span>cargo</span> <span>gives</span> us <span>insight</span> into the <span>treatments</span> <span>available</span> all those years ago,<br/>
🎧 <span>including</span> <span>tablets</span> that are thought to have been <span>dissolved</span> to <span>form</span> a <span>cleansing</span> <span>liquid</span> for the <span>eyes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Other <span>Roman</span> <span>ships</span> went down <span>nearby</span>, taking their <span>cargoes</span> with them.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>held</span> <span>huge</span> <span>pots</span> made of <span>terracotta</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some were used for <span>transporting</span> <span>cargoes</span> of <span>olive</span> oil, and <span>others</span> <span>held</span> <span>wine</span>.<br/>
🎧 In many <span>cases</span> it's only these <span>containers</span> that <span>remain</span>,<br/>
🎧 while the <span>wooden</span> <span>ships</span> have been <span>buried</span> under <span>silt</span> on the <span>seabed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>project..</span>.<br/>
