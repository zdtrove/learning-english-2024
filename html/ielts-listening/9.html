🎧 Good afternoon, Dreamtime Travel.<br/>
🎧 How can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Oh hello.<br/>
🎧 I'm interested in the holidays you offer along the coast near here.<br/>
🎧 Yes. We operate several tours up the coast.<br/>
🎧 Where in particular did you want to go?<br/>
🎧 Well, I like the sound of the holiday that mentioned whales.<br/>
🎧 Was it 'Whale Watching"?<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's our Whale Watch Experience.<br/>
🎧 It's very popular<br/>
🎧 and it's based in a lovely little town with nice beaches.<br/>
🎧 Oh right, and how long does it last?<br/>
🎧 It's two days<br/>
🎧 that includes four hours' travel time each way from here.<br/>
🎧 Good, I don't want to be away any longer than that.<br/>
🎧 So is that by coach?<br/>
🎧 Actually it's by minibus.<br/>
🎧 We like to keep those tours small and personal so we don't take a whole coachload of people.<br/>
🎧 In fact, we only take up to fifteen people on this tour,<br/>
🎧 although we do run it with just twelve or thirteen.<br/>
🎧 Oh, right.<br/>
🎧 So do you run these tours often?<br/>
🎧 Well, it depends on the time of year.<br/>
🎧 Of course in peak times like the summer holidays, we do them every weekend,<br/>
🎧 but at the moment, it's usually once a month at most.<br/>
🎧 And when is the next one going?<br/>
🎧 Mmm, let me see.<br/>
🎧 Um, there's one in three weeks' time which is April the 18th,<br/>
🎧 and then we don't have another one until June the 2nd.<br/>
🎧 And is April a good time to go?<br/>
🎧 Pretty good.<br/>
🎧 Though the really good time is later in the year.<br/>
🎧 I have to say though that the whale sighting is only one of the many things offered.<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 The hotel itself where you stay has great facilities.<br/>
🎧 It's called The Pallisades.<br/>
🎧 The Paris what?<br/>
🎧 No, it's actually The Pallisades,<br/>
🎧 PALLISADES.<br/>
🎧 It's right on the main beach there.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I see.<br/>
🎧 All of the rooms have nice views and the food is really good there too.<br/>
🎧 Oh right.<br/>
🎧 And what about the other things?<br/>
🎧 You know, that are included in the price.<br/>
🎧 Oh, there are lots of things.<br/>
🎧 If you don't want to do the whale watch cruise,<br/>
🎧 your guide will take anyone who is interested either on a bushwalk through the national park near the hotel,<br/>
🎧 and there's no extra charge for that,<br/>
🎧 or on a fishing trip.<br/>
🎧 That's an extra $12 I think.<br/>
🎧 And there's also a reptile park in town -<br/>
🎧 that costs more or less the same.<br/>
🎧 No, I think I'd prefer whales to snakes.<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 And if you just want to relax, you are free to sit by the hotel pool or go down the beach.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and they also have tennis courts at the hotel,<br/>
🎧 but you have to pay for those by the hour.<br/>
🎧 But there are table tennis tables downstairs<br/>
🎧 and they're part of the accommodation package.<br/>
🎧 Just speak to your guide.<br/>
🎧 Well, that sounds good.<br/>
🎧 So how much is the basic tour price?<br/>
🎧 At this time of year, it's usually around $300 but...<br/>
🎧 let me check.<br/>
🎧 Oh, it's actually $280.<br/>
🎧 And the next tour, are there any places on that one?<br/>
🎧 How many people is it for?<br/>
🎧 There are two of us.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that should be fine.<br/>
🎧 Can I just mention that we require all bookings to be made at least 14 days before you travel<br/>
🎧 to avoid cancellations of tours.<br/>
🎧 And if you cancel within seven days of departure,<br/>
🎧 you will have to pay 50% of your total booking.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 And you also need to pay a 20% deposit at the time of booking.<br/>
🎧 Can I pay that by credit card?<br/>
🎧 Yes, you can.<br/>
🎧 All right, what I'll do is I'll talk to my partner and get back to you.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 So, I'll make a provisional booking, shall I?<br/>
🎧 Two for the Whale Watch Experience.<br/>
🎧 Let me issue you with a customer reference number for when you call back.<br/>
🎧 Do you have a pen?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 OK, it's 39745T.<br/>
🎧 That's T for tango.<br/>
🎧 When you call back, ask to speak to the Tour Manager, that's me, Tracy.<br/>
🎧 Fine, I will.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Hello and welcome to today's 'Buyer Beware' programme,<br/>
🎧 where we give you some tips on how to spend your money wisely.<br/>
🎧 Now, in today's show we're looking at beds for children and babies.<br/>
🎧 Let's start by looking at baby cots,<br/>
🎧 that's for children of up to three years old.<br/>
🎧 We tested three different cots all in the budget price range and, as usual,<br/>
🎧 we will feature the good points, the problems and our verdict.<br/>
🎧 The first cot we looked at was by Baby Safe<br/>
🎧 and it had several good points to recommend it.<br/>
🎧 Our testers liked the fact that it had four wheels,<br/>
🎧 so it was easy to move around.<br/>
🎧 The only slight problems with this cot were that it had no brakes,<br/>
🎧 but they didn't think that mattered too much.<br/>
🎧 At first they were a bit concerned about the side bar,<br/>
🎧 because they felt babies could trap their fingers in it,<br/>
🎧 but our testers felt that this was unlikely to happen,<br/>
🎧 so they have given this one a verdict of 'satisfactory'.<br/>
🎧 The next cot was by Choice Cots<br/>
🎧 and this time our testers were pleased to find a cot which is simple to put together -<br/>
🎧 unlike others we looked at.<br/>
🎧 On the minus side, our testers did not like the fact that the side of the cot did not drop down,<br/>
🎧 making it difficult to pick up newborn babies.<br/>
🎧 However, the real problem with this cot was the space between the bars;<br/>
🎧 our testers found they were too wide<br/>
🎧 and a baby could easily trap his head.<br/>
🎧 We felt this was a real safety hazard<br/>
🎧 and so we have labelled this one dangerous, I'm afraid.<br/>
🎧 And finally better news for the Mother's Choice cot.<br/>
🎧 This cot was slightly different in that, although the side bar did not drop down,<br/>
🎧 the base could be raised or lowered into two different positions<br/>
🎧 making it safe as well as convenient.<br/>
🎧 The negatives for this one were quite minor;<br/>
🎧 the only niggle everyone had was the fact that it has no wheels<br/>
🎧 and the only other problem anyone could find was that there were pictures<br/>
🎧 which were simply stuck on and so could easily become detached.<br/>
🎧 The makers have now promised to discontinue this practice.<br/>
🎧 As this cot will then be safe in every way,<br/>
🎧 we have made the Mother's Choice cot our best buy,<br/>
🎧 Congratulations Mother's Choice!<br/>
🎧 So, what features should you look for in a baby's cot?<br/>
🎧 Well obviously safety is a very important factor as well as comfort and convenience.<br/>
🎧 We recommend that, if you are buying a cot,<br/>
🎧 do make sure that any metal present is not rusted or bent in any way.<br/>
🎧 You should ensure your cot has only rounded or smooth edging without any sharp edges,<br/>
🎧 this is especially important for wooden cots.<br/>
🎧 And now on to beds...<br/>

🎧 Excuse me, I was told to come here for advice about...<br/>
🎧 Management Diploma courses?<br/>
🎧 You've certainly come to the right place.<br/>
🎧 Hi, my name is Monica.<br/>
🎧 Nice to meet you.<br/>
🎧 My name is Andrew, Andrew Harris.<br/>
🎧 So, Andrew, have you seen our diploma course prospectus yet?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I've already looked at it.<br/>
🎧 In fact, I thought the information on course content was really useful,<br/>
🎧 but I'm afraid I'm a bit confused by all the different ways you can do the course:<br/>
🎧 full-time intensive, part-time and so on.<br/>
🎧 Well, let's see if I can help.<br/>
🎧 I think each course type has its advantages and disadvantages, so it really depends on you -<br/>
🎧 your own study habits, and your financial circumstances, of course.<br/>
🎧 Are you working at the moment?<br/>
🎧 Yes. I've been working in the administration section of the local hospital for the last three years.<br/>
🎧 And before that I worked in the office of a computer engineering company for two years.<br/>
🎧 So, I've got about five years of relevant work experience.<br/>
🎧 And what I'm hoping to focus on is Personnel Management.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 And are you planning to leave your current job to study,<br/>
🎧 or are you thinking about just taking a year off?<br/>
🎧 I want to know what my options are, really.<br/>
🎧 I don't want to quit my job or anything<br/>
🎧 and my employers are keen for me to get some more qualifications<br/>
🎧 but obviously, it would be better if I could do a course without taking too much time away from work.<br/>
🎧 Right, so you don't really want to do the full-time course, then?<br/>
🎧 No, not really.<br/>
🎧 It's also a question of finances.<br/>
🎧 You see, my office have agreed to pay the cost of the course itself,<br/>
🎧 but I would have to take unpaid leave if I want to study full-time and, well...<br/>
🎧 I don't think I could afford to support myself with no salary for a whole year.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Well, you have two other possibilities:<br/>
🎧 you could either do the part-time course -<br/>
🎧 that would be over two years and you wouldn't have to take any time off work -<br/>
🎧 or you could do what we call a 'modular' course.<br/>
🎧 You could do that in eighteen months if you wanted or longer,<br/>
🎧 it's quite flexible and it would be up to you.<br/>
🎧 So what does the part-time course involve?<br/>
🎧 For that you would join an evening class and have a lecture twice a week.<br/>
🎧 Then, you'd have to attend a seminar or discussion workshop one weekend a month.<br/>
🎧 What kind of coursework would I have to do?<br/>
🎧 Well, it's a mixture.<br/>
🎧 You'd be expected to write an essay each month, which counts towards your final assessment.<br/>
🎧 You have a case study to do by the end of the course,<br/>
🎧 which might involve doing a survey or something like that,<br/>
🎧 and also you need to hand in a short report every four weeks.<br/>
🎧 So, that's quite a lot of work, then, on top of working every day.<br/>
🎧 It sounds like a lot of studying and really tiring.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, you certainly wouldn't have much free time!<br/>
🎧 What about the 'modular' course?<br/>
🎧 What would I have to do for that?<br/>
🎧 That's where you get the opportunity to study full-time for short periods.<br/>
🎧 That way you can cover a lot of coursework<br/>
🎧 and attend lectures and seminars during the day.<br/>
🎧 And each module lasts for one term, say, about twelve weeks at a time.<br/>
🎧 There are obvious advantages in this -<br/>
🎧 the main one being that you can study in a much more intensive way,<br/>
🎧 which suits some people much better.<br/>
🎧 And how many of these 'modules' would I have to do to get the diploma?<br/>
🎧 The current programme is two modules -<br/>
🎧 and then you have to choose a topic to work in more depth -<br/>
🎧 but you can base that on your job,<br/>
🎧 and so you don't need to be away from the office,<br/>
🎧 and how long it takes is up to you.<br/>
🎧 The important thing is that you don't have to study and work.<br/>
🎧 You can focus on one thing at a time.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I can see that.<br/>
🎧 It certainly sounds attractive!<br/>
🎧 It would be more expensive, though.<br/>
🎧 I mean, I'd have to support myself without pay for each module.<br/>
🎧 That's true, so that might be a problem for you.<br/>
🎧 Look, why don't you talk this over with your employers...<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Okay, so we've been looking at the attitudes of various social and cultural groups towards the management of their personal finances -<br/>
🎧 how important they feel it is to save money,<br/>
🎧 and what they save their money for.<br/>
🎧 One aspect that we haven't yet considered is gender.<br/>
🎧 So if we consider gender issues,<br/>
🎧 we're basically asking whether men and women have different attitudes towards saving money,<br/>
🎧 and whether they save money for different things.<br/>
🎧 Back in 1928 the British writer George Bernard Shaw<br/>
🎧 wrote in his Intelligent Women's Guide to Socialism and Capitalism<br/>
🎧 that 'a man is supposed to understand politics. economics and finance'<br/>
🎧 'and is therefore unwilling to accept essential instruction.'<br/>
🎧 He also said, 'A woman, having fewer pretensions, is far more willing to learn'.<br/>
🎧 Now, though these days people might question a lot of the assumptions contained in those statements,<br/>
🎧 recent research does suggest that there are some quite fundamental differences between men and women<br/>
🎧 in their attitudes to economic matters.<br/>
🎧 Let's look at what men and women actually save for.<br/>
🎧 Research studies of women in North America have found that...<br/>
🎧 women are far more likely to save for their children's education<br/>
🎧 and they are also more likely to save up in order to buy a house one day.<br/>
🎧 The same studies have found that men, on the other hand,<br/>
🎧 tend to save for a car,<br/>
🎧 which, by the way, takes a surprisingly large amount of the household budget in North America.<br/>
🎧 But the other main priority for men when saving money is their retirement.<br/>
🎧 When they're earning, they're far more likely to put money aside for their old age than women are.<br/>
🎧 Now, this is rather disturbing,<br/>
🎧 because in fact the need for women to save for their old age is far greater than for men.<br/>
🎧 Let's consider this for a moment.<br/>
🎧 To start with, it is a fact that throughout the world,<br/>
🎧 women are likely to live many years longer than men,<br/>
🎧 so they need money to support them during this time.<br/>
🎧 Since women are likely to be the ones left without a partner in old age,<br/>
🎧 they may therefore have to pay for nursing care,<br/>
🎧 because they don't have a spouse to look after them.<br/>
🎧 Furthermore the high divorce rates in North America are creating a poverty cycle for women.<br/>
🎧 It is the divorced women who will most often have to look after the children<br/>
🎧 and thus they need more money to look after not just themselves but others.<br/>
🎧 So what can be done about this situation?<br/>
🎧 The population in North America is likely to contain an increasing number of elderly women.<br/>
🎧 The research indicates that at present<br/>
🎧 for women, it takes a crisis to make them think about their future financial situation.<br/>
🎧 But of course, this is the very worst time for anyone to make important decisions.<br/>
🎧 Women today need to look ahead, think ahead -<br/>
🎧 not wait until they're under pressure.<br/>
🎧 Even women in their early twenties need to think about pensions, for example,<br/>
🎧 and with increasing numbers of women in professional positions,<br/>
🎧 there are signs that this is beginning to happen.<br/>
🎧 Then research also suggests that<br/>
🎧 women avoid dealing effectively with their economic situation<br/>
🎧 because of a lack of confidence.<br/>
🎧 The best way for them to overcome this<br/>
🎧 is by getting themselves properly informed<br/>
🎧 so they are less dependent on other people's advice.<br/>
🎧 A number of initiatives have been set up to help them do this.<br/>
🎧 This College, for example, is one of the educational institutions<br/>
🎧 which offers night classes in Money Management,<br/>
🎧 and increasing numbers of women are enrolling on such courses.<br/>
🎧 Here, they can be given advice on different ways of saving.<br/>
🎧 Many women are unwilling to invest in stocks and shares, for instance,<br/>
🎧 but these can be extremely profitable.<br/>
🎧 It is usually advised that at least 70% of a person's savings should be in low-risk investments<br/>
🎧 but for the rest, financial advisors often advise taking some well-informed risks.<br/>
🎧 Initiatives such as this can give women the economic skills and knowledge they need<br/>
🎧 for a comfortable, independent retirement.<br/>
🎧 The increasing proportion of elderly women in the population...<br/>
<br/><br/>
