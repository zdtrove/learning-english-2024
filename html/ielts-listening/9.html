🎧 Good afternoon</span>, Dreamtime</span> Travel.<br/>
🎧 How can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Oh hello.<br/>
🎧 I'm interested in the holidays</span> you offer</span> along the coast</span> near here.<br/>
🎧 Yes. We operate</span> several</span> tours</span> up the coast</span>.<br/>
🎧 Where in particular</span> did you want to go?<br/>
🎧 Well, I like the sound of the holiday</span> that mentioned</span> whales</span>.<br/>
🎧 Was it 'Whale</span> Watching"</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's our Whale</span> Watch</span> Experience</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's very popular<br/></span>
🎧 and it's based</span> in a lovely</span> little town</span> with nice beaches</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh right, and how long does it last?<br/>
🎧 It's two days<br/></span>
🎧 that includes</span> four</span> hours'</span> travel time each way from here.<br/>
🎧 Good, I don't want to be away any longer</span> than that.<br/>
🎧 So is that by coach</span>?<br/>
🎧 Actually it's by minibus</span>.<br/>
🎧 We like to keep those tours</span> small and personal so we don't take a whole coachload</span> of people.<br/>
🎧 In fact</span>, we only take up to fifteen</span> people on this tour</span>,<br/>
🎧 although we do run it with just twelve</span> or thirteen</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, right.<br/>
🎧 So do you run these tours</span> often?<br/>
🎧 Well, it depends</span> on the time of year.<br/>
🎧 Of course in peak</span> times</span> like the summer</span> holidays</span>, we do them every weekend,<br/>
🎧 but at the moment</span>, it's usually once a month at most.<br/>
🎧 And when is the next one going?<br/>
🎧 Mmm</span>, let me see.<br/>
🎧 Um</span>, there's one in three</span> weeks'</span> time which is April</span> the 18th</span>,<br/>
🎧 and then we don't have another one until June</span> the 2nd</span>.<br/>
🎧 And is April</span> a good time to go?<br/>
🎧 Pretty</span> good.<br/>
🎧 Though the really good time is later in the year.<br/>
🎧 I have to say though that the whale</span> sighting</span> is only one of the many things offered</span>.<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 The hotel</span> itself</span> where you stay</span> has great facilities</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's called The Pallisades</span>.<br/>
🎧 The Paris</span> what?<br/>
🎧 No, it's actually The Pallisades</span>,<br/>
🎧 PALLISADES</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's right on the main</span> beach</span> there.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I see.<br/>
🎧 All of the rooms</span> have nice views</span> and the food is really good there too.<br/>
🎧 Oh right.<br/>
🎧 And what about the other things?<br/>
🎧 You know, that are included</span> in the price</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, there are lots of things.<br/>
🎧 If you don't want to do the whale</span> watch</span> cruise</span>,<br/>
🎧 your guide</span> will take anyone</span> who is interested either on a bushwalk</span> through the national</span> park</span> near the hotel</span>,<br/>
🎧 and there's no extra</span> charge</span> for that,<br/>
🎧 or on a fishing</span> trip</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's an extra</span> $12</span> I think.<br/>
🎧 And there's also a reptile</span> park</span> in town</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 that costs</span> more or less the same.<br/>
🎧 No, I think I'd prefer</span> whales</span> to snakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 And if you just want to relax</span>, you are free to sit by the hotel</span> pool</span> or go down the beach</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and they also have tennis</span> courts</span> at the hotel</span>,<br/>
🎧 but you have to pay for those by the hour</span>.<br/>
🎧 But there are table</span> tennis</span> tables</span> downstairs<br/></span>
🎧 and they're part</span> of the accommodation</span> package</span>.<br/>
🎧 Just speak to your guide</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, that sounds good.<br/>
🎧 So how much is the basic</span> tour</span> price</span>?<br/>
🎧 At this time of year, it's usually around $300</span> but..</span>.<br/>
🎧 let me check.<br/>
🎧 Oh, it's actually $280</span>.<br/>
🎧 And the next tour</span>, are there any places</span> on that one?<br/>
🎧 How many people is it for?<br/>
🎧 There are two of us.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that should be fine.<br/>
🎧 Can I just mention</span> that we require</span> all bookings</span> to be made at least</span> 14</span> days</span> before you travel<br/></span>
🎧 to avoid</span> cancellations</span> of tours</span>.<br/>
🎧 And if you cancel</span> within</span> seven</span> days</span> of departure</span>,<br/>
🎧 you will have to pay 50%</span> of your total</span> booking</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 And you also need to pay a 20%</span> deposit</span> at the time of booking</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can I pay that by credit</span> card</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, you can.<br/>
🎧 All right, what I'll do is I'll talk to my partner</span> and get back to you.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 So, I'll make a provisional</span> booking</span>, shall I?<br/>
🎧 Two for the Whale</span> Watch</span> Experience</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let me issue you with a customer</span> reference</span> number for when you call back.<br/>
🎧 Do you have a pen?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 OK, it's 39745T</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's T</span> for tango</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you call back, ask to speak to the Tour</span> Manager</span>, that's me, Tracy</span>.<br/>
🎧 Fine, I will.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Hello and welcome</span> to today's</span> 'Buyer</span> Beware'</span> programme</span>,<br/>
🎧 where we give you some tips</span> on how to spend</span> your money wisely</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, in today's</span> show we're looking at beds</span> for children and babies</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's start by looking at baby</span> cots</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's for children of up to three</span> years old.<br/>
🎧 We tested</span> three</span> different cots</span> all in the budget</span> price</span> range</span> and, as usual</span>,<br/>
🎧 we will feature</span> the good points</span>, the problems</span> and our verdict</span>.<br/>
🎧 The first cot</span> we looked</span> at was by Baby</span> Safe<br/></span>
🎧 and it had several</span> good points</span> to recommend</span> it.<br/>
🎧 Our testers</span> liked</span> the fact</span> that it had four</span> wheels</span>,<br/>
🎧 so it was easy to move around.<br/>
🎧 The only slight</span> problems</span> with this cot</span> were that it had no brakes</span>,<br/>
🎧 but they didn't think that mattered</span> too much.<br/>
🎧 At first they were a bit concerned</span> about the side bar</span>,<br/>
🎧 because they felt</span> babies</span> could trap</span> their fingers</span> in it,<br/>
🎧 but our testers</span> felt</span> that this was unlikely</span> to happen</span>,<br/>
🎧 so they have given</span> this one a verdict</span> of 'satisfactory'</span>.<br/>
🎧 The next cot</span> was by Choice</span> Cots<br/></span>
🎧 and this time our testers</span> were pleased</span> to find a cot</span> which is simple to put together -<br/></span>
🎧 unlike</span> others</span> we looked</span> at.<br/>
🎧 On the minus</span> side, our testers</span> did not like the fact</span> that the side of the cot</span> did not drop</span> down,<br/>
🎧 making</span> it difficult</span> to pick</span> up newborn</span> babies</span>.<br/>
🎧 However</span>, the real</span> problem</span> with this cot</span> was the space</span> between the bars;<br/></span>
🎧 our testers</span> found</span> they were too wide<br/></span>
🎧 and a baby</span> could easily</span> trap</span> his head</span>.<br/>
🎧 We felt</span> this was a real</span> safety</span> hazard<br/></span>
🎧 and so we have labelled</span> this one dangerous</span>, I'm afraid</span>.<br/>
🎧 And finally better news</span> for the Mother's</span> Choice</span> cot</span>.<br/>
🎧 This cot</span> was slightly</span> different in that, although the side bar</span> did not drop</span> down,<br/>
🎧 the base</span> could be raised</span> or lowered</span> into two different positions<br/></span>
🎧 making</span> it safe</span> as well as convenient</span>.<br/>
🎧 The negatives</span> for this one were quite minor;<br/></span>
🎧 the only niggle</span> everyone had was the fact</span> that it has no wheels<br/></span>
🎧 and the only other problem</span> anyone</span> could find was that there were pictures<br/></span>
🎧 which were simply</span> stuck</span> on and so could easily</span> become detached</span>.<br/>
🎧 The makers</span> have now promised</span> to discontinue</span> this practice.<br/>
🎧 As this cot</span> will then be safe</span> in every way,<br/>
🎧 we have made the Mother's</span> Choice</span> cot</span> our best buy,<br/>
🎧 Congratulations</span> Mother's</span> Choice</span>!<br/>
🎧 So, what features</span> should you look for in a baby's</span> cot</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well obviously</span> safety</span> is a very important factor</span> as well as comfort</span> and convenience</span>.<br/>
🎧 We recommend</span> that, if you are buying</span> a cot</span>,<br/>
🎧 do make sure that any metal</span> present</span> is not rusted</span> or bent</span> in any way.<br/>
🎧 You should ensure</span> your cot</span> has only rounded</span> or smooth</span> edging</span> without any sharp</span> edges</span>,<br/>
🎧 this is especially</span> important for wooden</span> cots</span>.<br/>
🎧 And now on to beds..</span>.<br/>

🎧 Excuse</span> me, I was told to come here for advice about..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Management</span> Diploma</span> courses</span>?<br/>
🎧 You've certainly</span> come to the right place.<br/>
🎧 Hi, my name is Monica</span>.<br/>
🎧 Nice to meet you.<br/>
🎧 My name is Andrew</span>, Andrew</span> Harris</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, Andrew</span>, have you seen</span> our diploma</span> course prospectus</span> yet?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I've already looked</span> at it.<br/>
🎧 In fact</span>, I thought the information</span> on course content</span> was really useful,<br/>
🎧 but I'm afraid</span> I'm a bit confused</span> by all the different ways</span> you can do the course:<br/></span>
🎧 full-time</span> intensive</span>, part-time</span> and so on.<br/>
🎧 Well, let's see if I can help.<br/>
🎧 I think each course type</span> has its advantages</span> and disadvantages</span>, so it really depends</span> on you -<br/></span>
🎧 your own study</span> habits</span>, and your financial</span> circumstances</span>, of course.<br/>
🎧 Are you working at the moment</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes. I've been working in the administration</span> section</span> of the local</span> hospital</span> for the last three</span> years.<br/>
🎧 And before that I worked</span> in the office</span> of a computer</span> engineering</span> company for two years.<br/>
🎧 So, I've got about five</span> years of relevant</span> work experience</span>.<br/>
🎧 And what I'm hoping</span> to focus on is Personnel</span> Management</span>.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 And are you planning to leave your current</span> job</span> to study</span>,<br/>
🎧 or are you thinking about just taking a year off?<br/>
🎧 I want to know what my options are, really.<br/>
🎧 I don't want to quit</span> my job</span> or anything<br/></span>
🎧 and my employers</span> are keen</span> for me to get some more qualifications<br/></span>
🎧 but obviously</span>, it would be better if I could do a course without taking too much time away from work.<br/>
🎧 Right, so you don't really want to do the full-time</span> course, then?<br/>
🎧 No, not really.<br/>
🎧 It's also a question</span> of finances</span>.<br/>
🎧 You see, my office</span> have agreed to pay the cost</span> of the course itself</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I would have to take unpaid</span> leave if I want to study</span> full-time</span> and, well..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't think I could afford</span> to support</span> myself with no salary</span> for a whole year.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Well, you have two other possibilities:<br/></span>
🎧 you could either do the part-time</span> course -<br/></span>
🎧 that would be over two years and you wouldn't have to take any time off work -<br/></span>
🎧 or you could do what we call a 'modular'</span> course.<br/>
🎧 You could do that in eighteen</span> months</span> if you wanted or longer</span>,<br/>
🎧 it's quite flexible</span> and it would be up to you.<br/>
🎧 So what does the part-time</span> course involve</span>?<br/>
🎧 For that you would join an evening</span> class and have a lecture</span> twice</span> a week.<br/>
🎧 Then, you'd have to attend</span> a seminar</span> or discussion</span> workshop</span> one weekend a month.<br/>
🎧 What kind of coursework</span> would I have to do?<br/>
🎧 Well, it's a mixture</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'd be expected</span> to write</span> an essay</span> each month, which counts</span> towards</span> your final</span> assessment</span>.<br/>
🎧 You have a case study</span> to do by the end of the course,<br/>
🎧 which might involve</span> doing a survey</span> or something like that,<br/>
🎧 and also you need to hand</span> in a short report</span> every four</span> weeks</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, that's quite a lot of work, then, on top of working every day.<br/>
🎧 It sounds like a lot of studying</span> and really tiring</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, you certainly</span> wouldn't have much free time!<br/>
🎧 What about the 'modular'</span> course?<br/>
🎧 What would I have to do for that?<br/>
🎧 That's where you get the opportunity</span> to study</span> full-time</span> for short periods</span>.<br/>
🎧 That way you can cover</span> a lot of coursework<br/></span>
🎧 and attend</span> lectures</span> and seminars</span> during the day.<br/>
🎧 And each module</span> lasts</span> for one term</span>, say, about twelve</span> weeks</span> at a time.<br/>
🎧 There are obvious</span> advantages</span> in this -<br/></span>
🎧 the main</span> one being that you can study</span> in a much more intensive</span> way,<br/>
🎧 which suits</span> some people much better.<br/>
🎧 And how many of these 'modules'</span> would I have to do to get the diploma</span>?<br/>
🎧 The current</span> programme</span> is two modules</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 and then you have to choose a topic</span> to work in more depth</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 but you can base</span> that on your job</span>,<br/>
🎧 and so you don't need to be away from the office</span>,<br/>
🎧 and how long it takes is up to you.<br/>
🎧 The important thing is that you don't have to study</span> and work.<br/>
🎧 You can focus on one thing at a time.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I can see that.<br/>
🎧 It certainly</span> sounds attractive</span>!<br/>
🎧 It would be more expensive</span>, though.<br/>
🎧 I mean, I'd have to support</span> myself without pay for each module</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's true</span>, so that might be a problem</span> for you.<br/>
🎧 Look, why don't you talk this over with your employers..</span>.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Okay, so we've been looking at the attitudes</span> of various</span> social</span> and cultural</span> groups</span> towards</span> the management</span> of their personal finances</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 how important they feel it is to save</span> money,<br/>
🎧 and what they save</span> their money for.<br/>
🎧 One aspect</span> that we haven't yet considered</span> is gender</span>.<br/>
🎧 So if we consider</span> gender</span> issues,<br/>
🎧 we're basically</span> asking</span> whether</span> men and women</span> have different attitudes</span> towards</span> saving</span> money,<br/>
🎧 and whether</span> they save</span> money for different things.<br/>
🎧 Back in 1928</span> the British</span> writer</span> George</span> Bernard</span> Shaw<br/></span>
🎧 wrote</span> in his Intelligent</span> Women's</span> Guide</span> to Socialism</span> and Capitalism<br/></span>
🎧 that 'a</span> man is supposed</span> to understand</span> politics</span>. economics</span> and finance'<br/></span>
🎧 'and</span> is therefore</span> unwilling</span> to accept</span> essential</span> instruction.'<br/></span>
🎧 He also said, 'A</span> woman</span>, having fewer</span> pretensions</span>, is far</span> more willing</span> to learn'</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, though these days</span> people might question</span> a lot of the assumptions</span> contained</span> in those statements</span>,<br/>
🎧 recent</span> research</span> does suggest</span> that there are some quite fundamental</span> differences</span> between men and women<br/></span>
🎧 in their attitudes</span> to economic</span> matters</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's look at what men and women</span> actually save</span> for.<br/>
🎧 Research</span> studies</span> of women</span> in North</span> America</span> have found</span> that..</span>.<br/>
🎧 women</span> are far</span> more likely</span> to save</span> for their children's</span> education<br/></span>
🎧 and they are also more likely</span> to save</span> up in order to buy a house one day.<br/>
🎧 The same studies</span> have found</span> that men, on the other hand</span>,<br/>
🎧 tend</span> to save</span> for a car,<br/>
🎧 which, by the way, takes a surprisingly</span> large amount of the household</span> budget</span> in North</span> America</span>.<br/>
🎧 But the other main</span> priority</span> for men when saving</span> money is their retirement</span>.<br/>
🎧 When they're earning</span>, they're far</span> more likely</span> to put money aside</span> for their old age than women</span> are.<br/>
🎧 Now, this is rather disturbing</span>,<br/>
🎧 because in fact</span> the need for women</span> to save</span> for their old age is far</span> greater</span> than for men.<br/>
🎧 Let's consider</span> this for a moment</span>.<br/>
🎧 To start with, it is a fact</span> that throughout</span> the world</span>,<br/>
🎧 women</span> are likely</span> to live many years longer</span> than men,<br/>
🎧 so they need money to support</span> them during this time.<br/>
🎧 Since women</span> are likely</span> to be the ones</span> left</span> without a partner</span> in old age,<br/>
🎧 they may therefore</span> have to pay for nursing</span> care</span>,<br/>
🎧 because they don't have a spouse</span> to look after them.<br/>
🎧 Furthermore</span> the high divorce</span> rates</span> in North</span> America</span> are creating</span> a poverty</span> cycle</span> for women</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is the divorced</span> women</span> who will most often have to look after the children<br/></span>
🎧 and thus</span> they need more money to look after not just themselves</span> but others</span>.<br/>
🎧 So what can be done about this situation</span>?<br/>
🎧 The population</span> in North</span> America</span> is likely</span> to contain</span> an increasing</span> number of elderly</span> women</span>.<br/>
🎧 The research</span> indicates</span> that at present<br/></span>
🎧 for women</span>, it takes a crisis</span> to make them think about their future financial</span> situation</span>.<br/>
🎧 But of course, this is the very worst</span> time for anyone</span> to make important decisions</span>.<br/>
🎧 Women</span> today need to look ahead, think ahead -<br/></span>
🎧 not wait until they're under pressure</span>.<br/>
🎧 Even women</span> in their early</span> twenties</span> need to think about pensions</span>, for example,<br/>
🎧 and with increasing</span> numbers</span> of women</span> in professional</span> positions</span>,<br/>
🎧 there are signs</span> that this is beginning</span> to happen</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then research</span> also suggests</span> that<br/></span>
🎧 women</span> avoid</span> dealing</span> effectively</span> with their economic</span> situation<br/></span>
🎧 because of a lack</span> of confidence</span>.<br/>
🎧 The best way for them to overcome</span> this<br/></span>
🎧 is by getting themselves</span> properly</span> informed<br/></span>
🎧 so they are less dependent</span> on other people's</span> advice.<br/>
🎧 A number of initiatives</span> have been set up to help them do this.<br/>
🎧 This College</span>, for example, is one of the educational</span> institutions<br/></span>
🎧 which offers</span> night</span> classes</span> in Money Management</span>,<br/>
🎧 and increasing</span> numbers</span> of women</span> are enrolling</span> on such courses</span>.<br/>
🎧 Here, they can be given</span> advice on different ways</span> of saving</span>.<br/>
🎧 Many women</span> are unwilling</span> to invest</span> in stocks</span> and shares</span>, for instance</span>,<br/>
🎧 but these can be extremely</span> profitable</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is usually advised</span> that at least</span> 70%</span> of a person's</span> savings</span> should be in low-risk</span> investments<br/></span>
🎧 but for the rest</span>, financial</span> advisors</span> often advise</span> taking some well-informed</span> risks</span>.<br/>
🎧 Initiatives</span> such as this can give women</span> the economic</span> skills</span> and knowledge</span> they need<br/></span>
🎧 for a comfortable</span>, independent</span> retirement</span>.<br/>
🎧 The increasing</span> proportion</span> of elderly</span> women</span> in the population..</span>.<br/>
<br/><br/>
