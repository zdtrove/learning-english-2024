🎧 Good <span>afternoon</span>, <span>Dreamtime</span> Travel.<br/>
🎧 How can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Oh hello.<br/>
🎧 I'm interested in the <span>holidays</span> you <span>offer</span> along the <span>coast</span> near here.<br/>
🎧 Yes. We <span>operate</span> <span>several</span> <span>tours</span> up the <span>coast</span>.<br/>
🎧 Where in <span>particular</span> did you want to go?<br/>
🎧 Well, I like the sound of the <span>holiday</span> that <span>mentioned</span> <span>whales</span>.<br/>
🎧 Was it <span>'Whale</span> <span>Watching"</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's our <span>Whale</span> <span>Watch</span> <span>Experience</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's very <span>popular<br/></span>
🎧 and it's <span>based</span> in a <span>lovely</span> little <span>town</span> with nice <span>beaches</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh right, and how long does it last?<br/>
🎧 It's two <span>days<br/></span>
🎧 that <span>includes</span> <span>four</span> <span>hours'</span> travel time each way from here.<br/>
🎧 Good, I don't want to be away any <span>longer</span> than that.<br/>
🎧 So is that by <span>coach</span>?<br/>
🎧 Actually it's by <span>minibus</span>.<br/>
🎧 We like to keep those <span>tours</span> small and personal so we don't take a whole <span>coachload</span> of people.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, we only take up to <span>fifteen</span> people on this <span>tour</span>,<br/>
🎧 although we do run it with just <span>twelve</span> or <span>thirteen</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, right.<br/>
🎧 So do you run these <span>tours</span> often?<br/>
🎧 Well, it <span>depends</span> on the time of year.<br/>
🎧 Of course in <span>peak</span> <span>times</span> like the <span>summer</span> <span>holidays</span>, we do them every weekend,<br/>
🎧 but at the <span>moment</span>, it's usually once a month at most.<br/>
🎧 And when is the next one going?<br/>
🎧 <span>Mmm</span>, let me see.<br/>
🎧 <span>Um</span>, there's one in <span>three</span> <span>weeks'</span> time which is <span>April</span> the <span>18th</span>,<br/>
🎧 and then we don't have another one until <span>June</span> the <span>2nd</span>.<br/>
🎧 And is <span>April</span> a good time to go?<br/>
🎧 <span>Pretty</span> good.<br/>
🎧 Though the really good time is later in the year.<br/>
🎧 I have to say though that the <span>whale</span> <span>sighting</span> is only one of the many things <span>offered</span>.<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 The <span>hotel</span> <span>itself</span> where you <span>stay</span> has great <span>facilities</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's called The <span>Pallisades</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Paris</span> what?<br/>
🎧 No, it's actually The <span>Pallisades</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>PALLISADES</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's right on the <span>main</span> <span>beach</span> there.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I see.<br/>
🎧 All of the <span>rooms</span> have nice <span>views</span> and the food is really good there too.<br/>
🎧 Oh right.<br/>
🎧 And what about the other things?<br/>
🎧 You know, that are <span>included</span> in the <span>price</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, there are lots of things.<br/>
🎧 If you don't want to do the <span>whale</span> <span>watch</span> <span>cruise</span>,<br/>
🎧 your <span>guide</span> will take <span>anyone</span> who is interested either on a <span>bushwalk</span> through the <span>national</span> <span>park</span> near the <span>hotel</span>,<br/>
🎧 and there's no <span>extra</span> <span>charge</span> for that,<br/>
🎧 or on a <span>fishing</span> <span>trip</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's an <span>extra</span> <span>$12</span> I think.<br/>
🎧 And there's also a <span>reptile</span> <span>park</span> in <span>town</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 that <span>costs</span> more or less the same.<br/>
🎧 No, I think I'd <span>prefer</span> <span>whales</span> to <span>snakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 And if you just want to <span>relax</span>, you are free to sit by the <span>hotel</span> <span>pool</span> or go down the <span>beach</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and they also have <span>tennis</span> <span>courts</span> at the <span>hotel</span>,<br/>
🎧 but you have to pay for those by the <span>hour</span>.<br/>
🎧 But there are <span>table</span> <span>tennis</span> <span>tables</span> <span>downstairs<br/></span>
🎧 and they're <span>part</span> of the <span>accommodation</span> <span>package</span>.<br/>
🎧 Just speak to your <span>guide</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, that sounds good.<br/>
🎧 So how much is the <span>basic</span> <span>tour</span> <span>price</span>?<br/>
🎧 At this time of year, it's usually around <span>$300</span> <span>but..</span>.<br/>
🎧 let me check.<br/>
🎧 Oh, it's actually <span>$280</span>.<br/>
🎧 And the next <span>tour</span>, are there any <span>places</span> on that one?<br/>
🎧 How many people is it for?<br/>
🎧 There are two of us.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that should be fine.<br/>
🎧 Can I just <span>mention</span> that we <span>require</span> all <span>bookings</span> to be made at <span>least</span> <span>14</span> <span>days</span> before you <span>travel<br/></span>
🎧 to <span>avoid</span> <span>cancellations</span> of <span>tours</span>.<br/>
🎧 And if you <span>cancel</span> <span>within</span> <span>seven</span> <span>days</span> of <span>departure</span>,<br/>
🎧 you will have to pay <span>50%</span> of your <span>total</span> <span>booking</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 And you also need to pay a <span>20%</span> <span>deposit</span> at the time of <span>booking</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can I pay that by <span>credit</span> <span>card</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, you can.<br/>
🎧 All right, what I'll do is I'll talk to my <span>partner</span> and get back to you.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 So, I'll make a <span>provisional</span> <span>booking</span>, shall I?<br/>
🎧 Two for the <span>Whale</span> <span>Watch</span> <span>Experience</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let me issue you with a <span>customer</span> <span>reference</span> number for when you call back.<br/>
🎧 Do you have a pen?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 OK, it's <span>39745T</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>T</span> for <span>tango</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you call back, ask to speak to the <span>Tour</span> <span>Manager</span>, that's me, <span>Tracy</span>.<br/>
🎧 Fine, I will.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Hello and <span>welcome</span> to <span>today's</span> <span>'Buyer</span> <span>Beware'</span> <span>programme</span>,<br/>
🎧 where we give you some <span>tips</span> on how to <span>spend</span> your money <span>wisely</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, in <span>today's</span> show we're looking at <span>beds</span> for children and <span>babies</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's start by looking at <span>baby</span> <span>cots</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's for children of up to <span>three</span> years old.<br/>
🎧 We <span>tested</span> <span>three</span> different <span>cots</span> all in the <span>budget</span> <span>price</span> <span>range</span> and, as <span>usual</span>,<br/>
🎧 we will <span>feature</span> the good <span>points</span>, the <span>problems</span> and our <span>verdict</span>.<br/>
🎧 The first <span>cot</span> we <span>looked</span> at was by <span>Baby</span> <span>Safe<br/></span>
🎧 and it had <span>several</span> good <span>points</span> to <span>recommend</span> it.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>testers</span> <span>liked</span> the <span>fact</span> that it had <span>four</span> <span>wheels</span>,<br/>
🎧 so it was easy to move around.<br/>
🎧 The only <span>slight</span> <span>problems</span> with this <span>cot</span> were that it had no <span>brakes</span>,<br/>
🎧 but they didn't think that <span>mattered</span> too much.<br/>
🎧 At first they were a bit <span>concerned</span> about the side <span>bar</span>,<br/>
🎧 because they <span>felt</span> <span>babies</span> could <span>trap</span> their <span>fingers</span> in it,<br/>
🎧 but our <span>testers</span> <span>felt</span> that this was <span>unlikely</span> to <span>happen</span>,<br/>
🎧 so they have <span>given</span> this one a <span>verdict</span> of <span>'satisfactory'</span>.<br/>
🎧 The next <span>cot</span> was by <span>Choice</span> <span>Cots<br/></span>
🎧 and this time our <span>testers</span> were <span>pleased</span> to find a <span>cot</span> which is simple to put together <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>unlike</span> <span>others</span> we <span>looked</span> at.<br/>
🎧 On the <span>minus</span> side, our <span>testers</span> did not like the <span>fact</span> that the side of the <span>cot</span> did not <span>drop</span> down,<br/>
🎧 <span>making</span> it <span>difficult</span> to <span>pick</span> up <span>newborn</span> <span>babies</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, the <span>real</span> <span>problem</span> with this <span>cot</span> was the <span>space</span> between the <span>bars;<br/></span>
🎧 our <span>testers</span> <span>found</span> they were too <span>wide<br/></span>
🎧 and a <span>baby</span> could <span>easily</span> <span>trap</span> his <span>head</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>felt</span> this was a <span>real</span> <span>safety</span> <span>hazard<br/></span>
🎧 and so we have <span>labelled</span> this one <span>dangerous</span>, I'm <span>afraid</span>.<br/>
🎧 And finally better <span>news</span> for the <span>Mother's</span> <span>Choice</span> <span>cot</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>cot</span> was <span>slightly</span> different in that, although the side <span>bar</span> did not <span>drop</span> down,<br/>
🎧 the <span>base</span> could be <span>raised</span> or <span>lowered</span> into two different <span>positions<br/></span>
🎧 <span>making</span> it <span>safe</span> as well as <span>convenient</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>negatives</span> for this one were quite <span>minor;<br/></span>
🎧 the only <span>niggle</span> everyone had was the <span>fact</span> that it has no <span>wheels<br/></span>
🎧 and the only other <span>problem</span> <span>anyone</span> could find was that there were <span>pictures<br/></span>
🎧 which were <span>simply</span> <span>stuck</span> on and so could <span>easily</span> become <span>detached</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>makers</span> have now <span>promised</span> to <span>discontinue</span> this practice.<br/>
🎧 As this <span>cot</span> will then be <span>safe</span> in every way,<br/>
🎧 we have made the <span>Mother's</span> <span>Choice</span> <span>cot</span> our best buy,<br/>
🎧 <span>Congratulations</span> <span>Mother's</span> <span>Choice</span>!<br/>
🎧 So, what <span>features</span> should you look for in a <span>baby's</span> <span>cot</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well <span>obviously</span> <span>safety</span> is a very important <span>factor</span> as well as <span>comfort</span> and <span>convenience</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>recommend</span> that, if you are <span>buying</span> a <span>cot</span>,<br/>
🎧 do make sure that any <span>metal</span> <span>present</span> is not <span>rusted</span> or <span>bent</span> in any way.<br/>
🎧 You should <span>ensure</span> your <span>cot</span> has only <span>rounded</span> or <span>smooth</span> <span>edging</span> without any <span>sharp</span> <span>edges</span>,<br/>
🎧 this is <span>especially</span> important for <span>wooden</span> <span>cots</span>.<br/>
🎧 And now on to <span>beds..</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>Excuse</span> me, I was told to come here for advice <span>about..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Management</span> <span>Diploma</span> <span>courses</span>?<br/>
🎧 You've <span>certainly</span> come to the right place.<br/>
🎧 Hi, my name is <span>Monica</span>.<br/>
🎧 Nice to meet you.<br/>
🎧 My name is <span>Andrew</span>, <span>Andrew</span> <span>Harris</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, <span>Andrew</span>, have you <span>seen</span> our <span>diploma</span> course <span>prospectus</span> yet?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I've already <span>looked</span> at it.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, I thought the <span>information</span> on course <span>content</span> was really useful,<br/>
🎧 but I'm <span>afraid</span> I'm a bit <span>confused</span> by all the different <span>ways</span> you can do the <span>course:<br/></span>
🎧 <span>full-time</span> <span>intensive</span>, <span>part-time</span> and so on.<br/>
🎧 Well, let's see if I can help.<br/>
🎧 I think each course <span>type</span> has its <span>advantages</span> and <span>disadvantages</span>, so it really <span>depends</span> on you <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 your own <span>study</span> <span>habits</span>, and your <span>financial</span> <span>circumstances</span>, of course.<br/>
🎧 Are you working at the <span>moment</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes. I've been working in the <span>administration</span> <span>section</span> of the <span>local</span> <span>hospital</span> for the last <span>three</span> years.<br/>
🎧 And before that I <span>worked</span> in the <span>office</span> of a <span>computer</span> <span>engineering</span> company for two years.<br/>
🎧 So, I've got about <span>five</span> years of <span>relevant</span> work <span>experience</span>.<br/>
🎧 And what I'm <span>hoping</span> to focus on is <span>Personnel</span> <span>Management</span>.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 And are you planning to leave your <span>current</span> <span>job</span> to <span>study</span>,<br/>
🎧 or are you thinking about just taking a year off?<br/>
🎧 I want to know what my options are, really.<br/>
🎧 I don't want to <span>quit</span> my <span>job</span> or <span>anything<br/></span>
🎧 and my <span>employers</span> are <span>keen</span> for me to get some more <span>qualifications<br/></span>
🎧 but <span>obviously</span>, it would be better if I could do a course without taking too much time away from work.<br/>
🎧 Right, so you don't really want to do the <span>full-time</span> course, then?<br/>
🎧 No, not really.<br/>
🎧 It's also a <span>question</span> of <span>finances</span>.<br/>
🎧 You see, my <span>office</span> have agreed to pay the <span>cost</span> of the course <span>itself</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I would have to take <span>unpaid</span> leave if I want to <span>study</span> <span>full-time</span> and, <span>well..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't think I could <span>afford</span> to <span>support</span> myself with no <span>salary</span> for a whole year.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Well, you have two other <span>possibilities:<br/></span>
🎧 you could either do the <span>part-time</span> course <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 that would be over two years and you wouldn't have to take any time off work <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 or you could do what we call a <span>'modular'</span> course.<br/>
🎧 You could do that in <span>eighteen</span> <span>months</span> if you wanted or <span>longer</span>,<br/>
🎧 it's quite <span>flexible</span> and it would be up to you.<br/>
🎧 So what does the <span>part-time</span> course <span>involve</span>?<br/>
🎧 For that you would join an <span>evening</span> class and have a <span>lecture</span> <span>twice</span> a week.<br/>
🎧 Then, you'd have to <span>attend</span> a <span>seminar</span> or <span>discussion</span> <span>workshop</span> one weekend a month.<br/>
🎧 What kind of <span>coursework</span> would I have to do?<br/>
🎧 Well, it's a <span>mixture</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'd be <span>expected</span> to <span>write</span> an <span>essay</span> each month, which <span>counts</span> <span>towards</span> your <span>final</span> <span>assessment</span>.<br/>
🎧 You have a case <span>study</span> to do by the end of the course,<br/>
🎧 which might <span>involve</span> doing a <span>survey</span> or something like that,<br/>
🎧 and also you need to <span>hand</span> in a short <span>report</span> every <span>four</span> <span>weeks</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, that's quite a lot of work, then, on top of working every day.<br/>
🎧 It sounds like a lot of <span>studying</span> and really <span>tiring</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, you <span>certainly</span> wouldn't have much free time!<br/>
🎧 What about the <span>'modular'</span> course?<br/>
🎧 What would I have to do for that?<br/>
🎧 That's where you get the <span>opportunity</span> to <span>study</span> <span>full-time</span> for short <span>periods</span>.<br/>
🎧 That way you can <span>cover</span> a lot of <span>coursework<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>attend</span> <span>lectures</span> and <span>seminars</span> during the day.<br/>
🎧 And each <span>module</span> <span>lasts</span> for one <span>term</span>, say, about <span>twelve</span> <span>weeks</span> at a time.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>obvious</span> <span>advantages</span> in this <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>main</span> one being that you can <span>study</span> in a much more <span>intensive</span> way,<br/>
🎧 which <span>suits</span> some people much better.<br/>
🎧 And how many of these <span>'modules'</span> would I have to do to get the <span>diploma</span>?<br/>
🎧 The <span>current</span> <span>programme</span> is two <span>modules</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and then you have to choose a <span>topic</span> to work in more <span>depth</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 but you can <span>base</span> that on your <span>job</span>,<br/>
🎧 and so you don't need to be away from the <span>office</span>,<br/>
🎧 and how long it takes is up to you.<br/>
🎧 The important thing is that you don't have to <span>study</span> and work.<br/>
🎧 You can focus on one thing at a time.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I can see that.<br/>
🎧 It <span>certainly</span> sounds <span>attractive</span>!<br/>
🎧 It would be more <span>expensive</span>, though.<br/>
🎧 I mean, I'd have to <span>support</span> myself without pay for each <span>module</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>true</span>, so that might be a <span>problem</span> for you.<br/>
🎧 Look, why don't you talk this over with your <span>employers..</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Okay, so we've been looking at the <span>attitudes</span> of <span>various</span> <span>social</span> and <span>cultural</span> <span>groups</span> <span>towards</span> the <span>management</span> of their personal <span>finances</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 how important they feel it is to <span>save</span> money,<br/>
🎧 and what they <span>save</span> their money for.<br/>
🎧 One <span>aspect</span> that we haven't yet <span>considered</span> is <span>gender</span>.<br/>
🎧 So if we <span>consider</span> <span>gender</span> issues,<br/>
🎧 we're <span>basically</span> <span>asking</span> <span>whether</span> men and <span>women</span> have different <span>attitudes</span> <span>towards</span> <span>saving</span> money,<br/>
🎧 and <span>whether</span> they <span>save</span> money for different things.<br/>
🎧 Back in <span>1928</span> the <span>British</span> <span>writer</span> <span>George</span> <span>Bernard</span> <span>Shaw<br/></span>
🎧 <span>wrote</span> in his <span>Intelligent</span> <span>Women's</span> <span>Guide</span> to <span>Socialism</span> and <span>Capitalism<br/></span>
🎧 that <span>'a</span> man is <span>supposed</span> to <span>understand</span> <span>politics</span>. <span>economics</span> and <span>finance'<br/></span>
🎧 <span>'and</span> is <span>therefore</span> <span>unwilling</span> to <span>accept</span> <span>essential</span> <span>instruction.'<br/></span>
🎧 He also said, <span>'A</span> <span>woman</span>, having <span>fewer</span> <span>pretensions</span>, is <span>far</span> more <span>willing</span> to <span>learn'</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, though these <span>days</span> people might <span>question</span> a lot of the <span>assumptions</span> <span>contained</span> in those <span>statements</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>recent</span> <span>research</span> does <span>suggest</span> that there are some quite <span>fundamental</span> <span>differences</span> between men and <span>women<br/></span>
🎧 in their <span>attitudes</span> to <span>economic</span> <span>matters</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's look at what men and <span>women</span> actually <span>save</span> for.<br/>
🎧 <span>Research</span> <span>studies</span> of <span>women</span> in <span>North</span> <span>America</span> have <span>found</span> <span>that..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>women</span> are <span>far</span> more <span>likely</span> to <span>save</span> for their <span>children's</span> <span>education<br/></span>
🎧 and they are also more <span>likely</span> to <span>save</span> up in order to buy a house one day.<br/>
🎧 The same <span>studies</span> have <span>found</span> that men, on the other <span>hand</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>tend</span> to <span>save</span> for a car,<br/>
🎧 which, by the way, takes a <span>surprisingly</span> large amount of the <span>household</span> <span>budget</span> in <span>North</span> <span>America</span>.<br/>
🎧 But the other <span>main</span> <span>priority</span> for men when <span>saving</span> money is their <span>retirement</span>.<br/>
🎧 When they're <span>earning</span>, they're <span>far</span> more <span>likely</span> to put money <span>aside</span> for their old age than <span>women</span> are.<br/>
🎧 Now, this is rather <span>disturbing</span>,<br/>
🎧 because in <span>fact</span> the need for <span>women</span> to <span>save</span> for their old age is <span>far</span> <span>greater</span> than for men.<br/>
🎧 Let's <span>consider</span> this for a <span>moment</span>.<br/>
🎧 To start with, it is a <span>fact</span> that <span>throughout</span> the <span>world</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>women</span> are <span>likely</span> to live many years <span>longer</span> than men,<br/>
🎧 so they need money to <span>support</span> them during this time.<br/>
🎧 Since <span>women</span> are <span>likely</span> to be the <span>ones</span> <span>left</span> without a <span>partner</span> in old age,<br/>
🎧 they may <span>therefore</span> have to pay for <span>nursing</span> <span>care</span>,<br/>
🎧 because they don't have a <span>spouse</span> to look after them.<br/>
🎧 <span>Furthermore</span> the high <span>divorce</span> <span>rates</span> in <span>North</span> <span>America</span> are <span>creating</span> a <span>poverty</span> <span>cycle</span> for <span>women</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is the <span>divorced</span> <span>women</span> who will most often have to look after the <span>children<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>thus</span> they need more money to look after not just <span>themselves</span> but <span>others</span>.<br/>
🎧 So what can be done about this <span>situation</span>?<br/>
🎧 The <span>population</span> in <span>North</span> <span>America</span> is <span>likely</span> to <span>contain</span> an <span>increasing</span> number of <span>elderly</span> <span>women</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>research</span> <span>indicates</span> that at <span>present<br/></span>
🎧 for <span>women</span>, it takes a <span>crisis</span> to make them think about their future <span>financial</span> <span>situation</span>.<br/>
🎧 But of course, this is the very <span>worst</span> time for <span>anyone</span> to make important <span>decisions</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Women</span> today need to look <span>ahead</span>, think <span>ahead</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 not wait until they're under <span>pressure</span>.<br/>
🎧 Even <span>women</span> in their <span>early</span> <span>twenties</span> need to think about <span>pensions</span>, for example,<br/>
🎧 and with <span>increasing</span> <span>numbers</span> of <span>women</span> in <span>professional</span> <span>positions</span>,<br/>
🎧 there are <span>signs</span> that this is <span>beginning</span> to <span>happen</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then <span>research</span> also <span>suggests</span> <span>that<br/></span>
🎧 <span>women</span> <span>avoid</span> <span>dealing</span> <span>effectively</span> with their <span>economic</span> <span>situation<br/></span>
🎧 because of a <span>lack</span> of <span>confidence</span>.<br/>
🎧 The best way for them to <span>overcome</span> <span>this<br/></span>
🎧 is by getting <span>themselves</span> <span>properly</span> <span>informed<br/></span>
🎧 so they are less <span>dependent</span> on other <span>people's</span> advice.<br/>
🎧 A number of <span>initiatives</span> have been set up to help them do this.<br/>
🎧 This <span>College</span>, for example, is one of the <span>educational</span> <span>institutions<br/></span>
🎧 which <span>offers</span> <span>night</span> <span>classes</span> in Money <span>Management</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>increasing</span> <span>numbers</span> of <span>women</span> are <span>enrolling</span> on such <span>courses</span>.<br/>
🎧 Here, they can be <span>given</span> advice on different <span>ways</span> of <span>saving</span>.<br/>
🎧 Many <span>women</span> are <span>unwilling</span> to <span>invest</span> in <span>stocks</span> and <span>shares</span>, for <span>instance</span>,<br/>
🎧 but these can be <span>extremely</span> <span>profitable</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is usually <span>advised</span> that at <span>least</span> <span>70%</span> of a <span>person's</span> <span>savings</span> should be in <span>low-risk</span> <span>investments<br/></span>
🎧 but for the <span>rest</span>, <span>financial</span> <span>advisors</span> often <span>advise</span> taking some <span>well-informed</span> <span>risks</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Initiatives</span> such as this can give <span>women</span> the <span>economic</span> <span>skills</span> and <span>knowledge</span> they <span>need<br/></span>
🎧 for a <span>comfortable</span>, <span>independent</span> <span>retirement</span>.<br/>
