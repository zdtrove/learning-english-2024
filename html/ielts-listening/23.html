🎧 Good morning. How can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Hello. I'm interested in <span>renting</span> a house somewhere in the <span>town</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Could I have your name please?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's <span>Steven</span> <span>Godfrey</span>.<br/>
🎧 And tell me how many <span>bedrooms</span> you're looking for.<br/>
🎧 Well, we'd need <span>4</span>, because I'm going to share the house with <span>3</span> friends.<br/>
🎧 Okay, there are <span>several</span> of that size on our books.<br/>
🎧 They <span>mostly</span> <span>belong</span> to <span>families</span> who are working <span>abroad</span> at the <span>moment</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about the <span>location</span>?<br/>
🎧 It'd be nice to be <span>central</span>.<br/>
🎧 That might be <span>difficult</span>, as most <span>houses</span> of that size are in the <span>suburbs</span>.<br/>
🎧 Still, there are a few.<br/>
🎧 What's your <span>upper</span> <span>limit</span> for the <span>rent</span>?<br/>
🎧 We'd like something around <span>£500</span> a month,<br/>
🎧 but we could go up to <span>£600</span> if we have to.<br/>
🎧 But we can't go <span>beyond</span> that.<br/>
🎧 Do you know how long you want to <span>rent</span> the house for?<br/>
🎧 The <span>minimum</span> let is <span>6</span> <span>months</span>, as you probably <span>realise</span>.<br/>
🎧 We're at <span>college</span> here for two years,<br/>
🎧 and we don't want to have to move during that time if we can <span>avoid</span> it.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And how soon do you want to move in?<br/>
🎧 All our <span>lets</span> start on the first of the month.<br/>
🎧 Well, as soon as <span>possible</span>, really, so that <span>means</span> <span>September</span> <span>1st</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, let me have a look at what we've <span>got…</span>.<br/>
🎧 We have <span>photographs</span> of all the <span>houses</span> on our books, so you can get an idea of what they're like.<br/>
🎧 There's this one in <span>Oakington</span> <span>Avenue</span>, at <span>£550</span> a month.<br/>
🎧 <span>Combined</span> living room and <span>dining</span> room, with a <span>separate</span> <span>kitchen</span>.<br/>
🎧 It doesn't have a <span>garage</span>, though you can <span>park</span> in the <span>road</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ah, we'd <span>prefer</span> to have one, if <span>possible</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Then have a look at this house, in <span>Mead</span> <span>Street</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's got a very large living room and <span>kitchen</span>, <span>bathroom</span>, <span>cloakroom..</span>.<br/>
🎧 How much is it?<br/>
🎧 That <span>one's</span> <span>580</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's very well <span>furnished</span> and <span>equipped</span>.<br/>
🎧 It also has <span>plenty</span> of <span>space</span> for <span>parking</span>, and it's <span>available</span> for a <span>minimum</span> of a year.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and there's a big garden.<br/>
🎧 I don't think we could <span>cope</span> with that, to be <span>honest</span>.<br/>
🎧 We'll be too <span>busy</span> to look after it.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Then there's this <span>older</span> house in <span>Hamilton</span> <span>Road:<br/></span>
🎧 living room, <span>kitchen-diner</span>, and it has a <span>study</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>550</span> a month.<br/>
🎧 That looks rather nice.<br/>
🎧 But <span>whereabouts</span> in <span>Hamilton</span> <span>Road</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Towards</span> the <span>western</span> end.<br/>
🎧 Oh, <span>that'll</span> be very <span>noisy</span>. I know the <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's <span>pretty</span> <span>lively</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some people like it, though.<br/>
🎧 Well, what about this house in <span>Devon</span> <span>Close</span>?<br/>
🎧 That looks <span>lovely</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's a big <span>demand</span> for <span>houses</span> in that <span>area</span>, so <span>prices</span> <span>tend</span> to be quite high.<br/>
🎧 But this one hasn't been <span>decorated</span> for a few years, which has <span>kept</span> the <span>rent</span> down a bit.<br/>
🎧 It's got a living room, <span>dining</span> room and small <span>kitchen</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it's <span>595</span> a month.<br/>
🎧 I think it would <span>suit</span> you, from what you've said.<br/>
🎧 It sounds fine.<br/>
🎧 Why's that <span>part</span> of <span>town</span> so <span>popular</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, there's a big <span>scheme</span> to <span>improve</span> the <span>district</span>, and it'll soon have the best <span>facilities</span> for <span>miles</span> around.<br/>
🎧 What <span>sort</span> of thing?<br/>
🎧 There's a big <span>sports</span> <span>centre</span> under <span>construction</span>, which will be very <span>impressive</span> when it's <span>finished</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, the <span>swimming</span> <span>pool's</span> already <span>opened</span>, <span>ahead</span> of <span>schedule</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it's <span>attracting</span> a lot of people.<br/>
🎧 What about <span>cinemas:</span> are there any in the <span>area</span>?<br/>
🎧 The only one <span>closed</span> down last year,<br/>
🎧 and it's now in the <span>process</span> of being <span>converted</span> into a <span>film</span> <span>museum</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>local</span> people are trying to get a new <span>cinema</span> <span>added</span> to the <span>scheme</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think I heard something about a plan to <span>replace</span> the <span>existing</span> <span>concert</span> <span>hall</span> with a <span>larger</span> one.<br/>
🎧 Ah, that's <span>due</span> to start next year.<br/>
🎧 Well, it sounds an <span>interesting</span> <span>area</span> to live in.<br/>
🎧 Could I go and see the house, please?<br/>
🎧 Yes, of course.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Hello, and <span>welcome</span> to <span>"Focus</span> on the <span>Arts"</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm your <span>host</span> <span>-</span> <span>Dave</span> <span>Green</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and this is your very own <span>local</span> <span>radio</span> <span>programme</span>.<br/>
🎧 Every <span>Friday</span> <span>evening</span> we put the <span>spotlight</span> on different <span>arts</span> and <span>culture</span> <span>facilities</span>,<br/>
🎧 and look at the <span>shows</span> and <span>events</span> that are on <span>offer</span> in the <span>coming</span> week.<br/>
🎧 And today the focus is on The <span>National</span> <span>Arts</span> <span>Centre</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, if you don't already know it yourself,<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you've all heard of it.<br/>
🎧 It's famous <span>throughout</span> the <span>world</span> as one of the <span>major</span> <span>venues</span> for <span>classical</span> music.<br/>
🎧 But did you know that it is actually much more than just a place to hear <span>concerts</span>?<br/>
🎧 The <span>Centre</span> <span>itself</span> is a <span>huge</span> <span>complex</span> that <span>caters</span> for a great <span>range</span> of <span>arts</span>.<br/>
🎧 Under a <span>single</span> <span>roof</span> it <span>houses</span> <span>concert</span> <span>rooms</span>, <span>theatres</span>, <span>cinemas</span>, <span>art</span> <span>galleries<br/></span>
🎧 and a wonderful <span>public</span> <span>library</span>,<br/>
🎧 as well as <span>service</span> <span>facilities</span> <span>including</span> <span>three</span> <span>restaurants</span> and a <span>bookshop</span>.<br/>
🎧 So at any one time, the <span>choice</span> of <span>entertainment</span> there is <span>simply</span> <span>enormous</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, how did they <span>manage</span> to <span>build</span> such a big <span>arts</span> <span>complex</span> right in the <span>heart</span> of the <span>city</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, the <span>area</span> was <span>completely</span> <span>destroyed</span> by <span>bombs</span> during the war in <span>1940</span>.<br/>
🎧 So the <span>opportunity</span> was taken to <span>create</span> a <span>cultural</span> <span>centre</span> that would <span>be..</span>.<br/>
🎧 what they <span>called:</span> <span>'The</span> <span>City's</span> <span>gift</span> to the <span>Nation'</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course, it took a while for such a big <span>project</span> to get <span>started</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it was <span>planned</span> in the <span>60s</span>, <span>built</span> in the <span>70s<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>eventually</span> <span>opened</span> to the <span>public</span> in <span>1983</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ever since then, it has <span>proved</span> to be a great success.<br/>
🎧 It is not <span>privately</span> <span>owned</span>, like many <span>arts</span> <span>centres</span>,<br/>
🎧 but is still in <span>public</span> <span>hands</span> <span>-</span> it's run by the <span>City</span> <span>Council</span>.<br/>
🎧 Both our <span>National</span> <span>Symphony</span> <span>Orchestra</span> and <span>National</span> <span>Theater</span> Company were <span>involved</span> in the planning of the <span>project</span>,<br/>
🎧 and they are now <span>based</span> there <span>-</span> <span>giving</span> <span>regular</span> <span>performances</span> every week <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and as the <span>Centre</span> is open <span>363</span> <span>days</span> of the year,<br/>
🎧 there are <span>plenty</span> of <span>performances</span> to choose from.<br/>
🎧 So, to give you some idea of what's on,<br/>
🎧 and to help you choose from the many <span>possibilities</span>,<br/>
🎧 we've made a <span>selection</span> of the <span>star</span> <span>attractions</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you're interested in <span>classical</span> music,<br/>
🎧 then we <span>recommend</span> you go along to the <span>National</span> on either <span>Monday</span> or <span>Tuesday</span> <span>evening</span> at <span>7.30<br/></span>
🎧 for a <span>spectacular</span> <span>production</span> of <span>'The</span> <span>Magic</span> <span>Flute'</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 probably the most <span>popular</span> of all <span>Mozart's</span> <span>operas</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's in the Garden <span>Hall</span> and <span>tickets</span> start at only <span>£8</span>,<br/>
🎧 but you'll have to be <span>early</span> if you want to get them that <span>cheap</span>!<br/>
🎧 And remember, it's only on for those two <span>evenings</span>.<br/>
🎧 For those more interested in the <span>cinema</span>,<br/>
🎧 you might like to see the new <span>Canadian</span> <span>film<br/></span>
🎧 which is <span>showing</span> on <span>Wednesday</span> <span>evening</span> at <span>8</span> pm in <span>Cinema</span> <span>2</span>.<br/>
🎧 And that's called <span>'Three</span> <span>Lives'</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's had <span>fantastic</span> <span>reviews<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>tickets</span> <span>cost</span> just <span>£4.50</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is a <span>reduction</span> on the <span>usual</span> <span>price</span> of <span>£5.50</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, it's really good <span>value</span>, <span>especially</span> for such a great movie.<br/>
🎧 But you can see the <span>centre's</span> <span>main</span> <span>attraction</span> at the weekend,<br/>
🎧 because on <span>Saturday</span> and <span>Sunday</span>, <span>11</span> am to <span>10</span> pm,<br/>
🎧 they're <span>showing</span> a wonderful new <span>exhibition</span> that hasn't been <span>seen</span> <span>anywhere</span> else in <span>Europe</span> yet.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>collection</span> of <span>Chinese</span> <span>Art</span> called <span>'Faces</span> of <span>China'</span> <span>-</span> that's in <span>Gallery</span> <span>1</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and it has some really <span>fascinating</span> <span>paintings</span> and <span>sculptures</span> by <span>leading</span> <span>artists</span> from all over <span>China</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and the good <span>news</span> is that it's <span>completely</span> free, so don't <span>miss</span> it!<br/>
🎧 So why not go along to the <span>National</span> <span>Art</span> <span>Centre</span> next week for one <span>-</span> or all <span>-</span> of these great <span>events</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and you can always <span>pick</span> up a <span>programme<br/></span>
🎧 and check out all the other <span>performances</span> and <span>exhibitions</span> on <span>offer</span>, or <span>coming</span> soon,<br/>
🎧 on almost every day of the year.<br/>
🎧 Next week, we'll be looking at the new <span>Museum</span> of <span>Science…<br/>
</span> <span><br/>

🎧 I've been <span>reading</span> your personal <span>statement</span>, <span>Paul</span>.<br/>
🎧 First, let's talk about your work <span>experience</span> in <span>South</span> <span>America</span>.<br/>
🎧 What took you there?<br/>
🎧 Was it to <span>gain</span> more <span>fluency</span> in <span>Spanish</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, as I'm <span>combining</span> <span>Spanish</span> with <span>Latin</span> <span>American</span> <span>studies</span>,<br/>
🎧 my <span>main</span> idea was to find out more about the way people <span>lived</span> there.<br/>
🎧 My <span>spoken</span> <span>Spanish</span> was already <span>pretty</span> good in <span>fact</span>.<br/>
🎧 So you weren't too <span>worried</span> about <span>language</span> <span>barriers</span>?<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, I <span>ended</span> up <span>teaching</span> English there,<br/>
🎧 although that wasn't my <span>original</span> <span>choice</span> of work.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 How did you find out about all this?<br/>
🎧 I <span>found</span> an <span>agency</span> that <span>runs</span> all <span>kinds</span> of <span>voluntary</span> <span>projects</span> in <span>South</span> <span>America</span>.<br/>
🎧 What kind of work?<br/>
🎧 Well, there were <span>several</span> <span>possibilities</span>.<br/>
🎧 You mean <span>construction</span>? <span>Engineering</span> work?<br/>
🎧 Yes, getting <span>involved</span> in <span>building</span> <span>projects</span> was an option.<br/>
🎧 Then there was <span>tourism</span> <span>-</span> taking <span>tourists</span> for <span>walks</span> around the <span>volcanoes</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 which I actually <span>chose</span> to do,<br/>
🎧 and then there was work with <span>local</span> <span>farmers</span>.<br/>
🎧 But you didn't <span>continue</span> with that <span>project</span>. Why not?<br/>
🎧 Because I never really <span>knew</span> <span>whether</span> I'd be <span>needed</span> or not.<br/>
🎧 I'd thought it might be <span>difficult</span> <span>physically</span>, but I was <span>certainly</span> fit <span>enough…<br/></span>
🎧 now, I wanted to do something that had more of a <span>proper</span> <span>structure</span> to it, I <span>suppose</span>,<br/>
🎧 I get <span>demotivated</span> <span>otherwise</span>.<br/>
🎧 What do you think you <span>learned</span> from your <span>experience</span>?<br/>
🎧 It must have been a great <span>opportunity</span> to <span>examine</span> <span>community</span> life.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but it was <span>difficult</span> at first to be <span>accepted</span> by the <span>locals</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was a very <span>remote</span> <span>village<br/></span>
🎧 and some of them were <span>reluctant</span> to speak to me <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 although they were always interested in my <span>clothes</span> and how much I'd had to pay for them.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's <span>understandable</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but things soon <span>improved</span>.<br/>
🎧 What <span>struck</span> me was that when people <span>became</span> more <span>comfortable</span> with me and less <span>suspicious</span>,<br/>
🎧 we really <span>connected</span> with each other in a <span>meaningful</span> way.<br/>
🎧 You made good friends?<br/>
🎧 Yes, with two of the <span>families</span> in <span>particular</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 What about <span>management</span>.<br/>
🎧 Did you have a <span>project</span> <span>manager</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, and he gave me lots of advice and <span>guidance</span>.<br/>
🎧 And was he good at <span>managing</span> too?<br/>
🎧 That wasn't his <span>strong</span> <span>point</span>!<br/>
🎧 I think he was often more interested in the <span>academic</span> side of things than <span>filling</span> <span>reports</span>.<br/>
🎧 He was a bit of a <span>dreamer</span>.<br/>
🎧 And did you have a <span>contract</span>?<br/>
🎧 I had to <span>stay</span> for a <span>minimum</span> of <span>three</span> <span>months</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>parents</span> were <span>surprised</span> when I <span>asked</span> to <span>stay</span> <span>longer</span> <span>-</span> six <span>months</span> in the end.<br/>
🎧 I was so happy there.<br/>
🎧 And did anything on the <span>administration</span> side of things <span>surprise</span> you?<br/>
🎧 What was the food and <span>lodging</span> like?<br/>
🎧 <span>Simple…</span> but there was <span>plenty</span> to eat and I only <span>paid</span> <span>$7</span> a day for that, which was amazing really.<br/>
🎧 And they gave me all the <span>equipment</span> I <span>needed…</span> even a <span>laptop</span>.<br/>
🎧 You didn't <span>expect</span> that then?<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'll look forward to <span>hearing</span> more.<br/>
🎧 But now let's look at these <span>modules</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll need to start thinking about which <span>ones</span> you'll definitely want to <span>study</span>.<br/>
🎧 The first one here is <span>Gender</span> <span>Studies</span> in <span>Latin</span> <span>America</span>.<br/>
🎧 It looks at how <span>gender</span> <span>analysis</span> is <span>reconfiguring</span> <span>civil</span> <span>society</span> in <span>Latin</span> <span>America</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Women</span> are <span>increasingly</span> <span>occupying</span> <span>positions</span> in <span>government<br/></span>
🎧 and in other <span>elected</span> <span>leadership</span> <span>positions</span> in <span>Latin</span> <span>America</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think you'd find it <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 If it was to do with people in the <span>villages</span> rather than those in the <span>public</span> <span>sphere</span>, I would.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 What about Second <span>Language</span> <span>Acquisition</span>?<br/>
🎧 Do you think I'd find that <span>useful</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, you've had some <span>practical</span> <span>experience</span> in the <span>field</span>, I think it would be.<br/>
🎧 I hadn't thought about that.<br/>
🎧 I'll put that down as a <span>definite</span>, then.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 What about <span>indigenous</span> <span>Women's</span> Lives.<br/>
🎧 That sounds <span>appropriate</span>.<br/>
🎧 I thought so too, but I <span>looked</span> at last <span>year's</span> <span>exam</span> <span>questions</span> and that <span>changed</span> my <span>mind</span>.<br/>
🎧 Don't <span>judge</span> the <span>value</span> of the course on that.<br/>
🎧 Maybe talk to some other students first and we can talk about it again later.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Yes, and <span>lastly</span>, will you <span>sign</span> up for <span>Portuguese</span> <span>lessons</span>?<br/>
🎧 My <span>Spanish</span> is good, so would I find that <span>module</span> easy?<br/>
🎧 Not <span>necessarily</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some people find that <span>Spanish</span> <span>interferes</span> with <span>learning</span> <span>Portuguese…<br/></span>
🎧 getting the <span>accent</span> right too.<br/>
🎧 It's quite different in a lot of <span>ways</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'd much <span>sooner</span> do something else, then.<br/>
🎧 Alright.<br/>
🎧 Now, what we need to <span>do..</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 In the last few <span>lectures</span>, I've been <span>dealing</span> with <span>business</span> <span>finance</span>,<br/>
🎧 but now I'm going to move on to <span>business</span> <span>systems</span>.<br/>
🎧 And in <span>today's</span> <span>lecture</span>,<br/>
🎧 I'm going to talk about what can go wrong when <span>businesses</span> try to <span>copy</span> their own best <span>practices</span>.<br/>
🎧 Once a <span>business</span> has <span>successfully</span> <span>introduced</span> a new <span>process</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>managing</span> a <span>branch</span> <span>bank</span>, say, or <span>selling</span> a new product <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>parent</span> <span>organisation</span> <span>naturally</span> <span>wants</span> to <span>repeat</span> that success,<br/>
🎧 and <span>capture</span> it if <span>possible</span> on a <span>bigger</span> <span>scale</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>goal</span>, then, is to <span>utilise</span> <span>existing</span> <span>knowledge<br/></span>
🎧 and not to <span>generate</span> new <span>knowledge</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a less <span>glamorous</span> <span>activity</span> than <span>pure</span> <span>innovation</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it actually <span>happens</span> more often, as a <span>matter</span> of <span>fact</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, <span>surprisingly</span>,<br/>
🎧 getting things right the second time is not <span>necessarily</span> any <span>simpler</span> than it was the first time.<br/>
🎧 Now, there's been a lot of <span>research</span> into how <span>companies</span> can <span>repeat</span> their <span>previous</span> <span>successes</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it <span>certainly</span> hasn't been <span>confined</span> to the <span>United</span> <span>States</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>seems</span> that most large <span>industries</span> are trying to <span>repeat</span> their own <span>successes</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>manage</span> the <span>knowledge</span> <span>they've</span> <span>acquired</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 but even so, it has been <span>shown</span> that the <span>overwhelming</span> <span>majority</span> of <span>attempts</span> <span>fail</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>host</span> of <span>studies</span> <span>confirm</span> this,<br/>
🎧 <span>covering</span> a <span>wide</span> <span>range</span> of <span>business</span> <span>settings:<br/></span>
🎧 <span>branch</span> <span>banks</span>, <span>retail</span> <span>stores</span>, <span>real</span> <span>estate</span> <span>agencies</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>factories</span>, call <span>centres..</span>. to name but a few.<br/>
🎧 So why do so few <span>managers</span> get things right the second or <span>third</span> time?<br/>
🎧 Let's <span>consider</span> one <span>reason</span> for <span>failure</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>placing</span> too much <span>trust</span> in the people who are <span>running</span> the <span>successful</span> <span>operation</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>'experts'</span> shall we say.<br/>
🎧 <span>Managers</span> who want to <span>apply</span> <span>existing</span> <span>knowledge</span> <span>typically</span> start off by going to an <span>expert</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 such as the person who <span>designed</span> and is <span>running</span> a <span>successful</span> <span>department</span> <span>store</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>picking</span> their <span>brains</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, this <span>approach</span> can be used if you want to <span>gain</span> a <span>rough</span> <span>understanding</span> of a <span>particular</span> <span>system</span>,<br/>
🎧 or <span>understand</span> <span>smaller</span>, <span>isolated</span> <span>problems</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>trouble</span> is, even the <span>expert</span> doesn't <span>fully</span> <span>grasp</span> the whole <span>thing<br/></span>
🎧 because when it comes to <span>complex</span> <span>systems</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>individual</span> <span>components</span> of the <span>process</span> are <span>interwoven</span> with one another.<br/>
🎧 The <span>expert</span> never has <span>complete</span> <span>access</span> to the <span>necessary</span> <span>information</span>.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>situation's</span> <span>complicated</span> even <span>further<br/></span>
🎧 by the <span>fact</span> that <span>experts</span> are usually not <span>aware</span> of their own <span>ignorance</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>ignorance</span> can take <span>various</span> <span>forms</span>.<br/>
🎧 For <span>instance</span>, a lot of <span>details</span> of the <span>system</span> are <span>invisible</span> to <span>managers</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some may be <span>difficult</span> to <span>describe</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>learned</span> on the <span>job</span> and well <span>known</span> by <span>workers</span> <span>perhaps</span>,<br/>
🎧 but <span>impossible</span> to <span>describe</span> in a way that's <span>helpful</span>.<br/>
🎧 And there are some things that people know or do that they're not even <span>aware</span> of.<br/>
🎧 Now, let's <span>consider</span> two <span>types</span> of <span>mistake<br/></span>
🎧 that can <span>occur</span> when a <span>manager</span> actually <span>starts</span> to set up a <span>duplicate</span> <span>system</span> to <span>replicate</span> a <span>successful</span> <span>process</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Firstly</span>, <span>perhaps</span> he <span>forgets</span> that he was just trying to <span>copy</span> another <span>process</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>starts</span> trying to <span>improve</span> on it.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>mistake</span> is trying to use the best <span>parts</span> of <span>various</span> different <span>systems</span>,<br/>
🎧 in the hope of <span>creating</span> the perfect <span>combination</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Unfortunately</span>, <span>attempts</span> like these usually <span>turn</span> out to be <span>misguided</span> and <span>lead</span> to <span>problems</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why?<br/>
🎧 Well, for <span>various</span> <span>reasons</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Perhaps</span> there weren't really any <span>advantages</span> after all,<br/>
🎧 because the <span>information</span> wasn't <span>accurate</span>.<br/>
🎧 Or <span>perhaps</span> the <span>business</span> <span>settings</span> weren't really <span>comparable</span>.<br/>
🎧 More <span>typically</span>, the <span>advantages</span> are <span>real</span> enough,<br/>
🎧 but there are also <span>disadvantages</span> that have been <span>overlooked</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, the <span>modifications</span> might <span>compromise</span> <span>safety</span> in some way.<br/>
🎧 So, what's the <span>solution</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I don't <span>intend</span> to <span>suggest</span> that it's easy to get things right the second <span>time..</span>.<br/>
🎧 it's not.<br/>
🎧 But the <span>underlying</span> <span>problem</span> has more to do with <span>attitudes</span> than the <span>actual</span> <span>difficulty</span> of the <span>task</span>,<br/>
🎧 and there are <span>ways</span> of getting it right.<br/>
🎧 These <span>involve</span> <span>adjusting</span> <span>attitudes</span>, first of <span>all..</span>.<br/>
🎧 being more <span>realistic</span> and <span>cautious</span> really.<br/>
🎧 <span>Secondly</span>, they <span>involve</span> <span>exerting</span> <span>strict</span> <span>controls</span> on the <span>organisational</span> and <span>operational</span> <span>systems</span>.<br/>
🎧 And this, in <span>turn</span>, <span>means</span> <span>copying</span> the <span>original</span> as <span>closely</span> as <span>possible</span>.<br/>
🎧 Not <span>merely</span> <span>duplicating</span> the <span>physical</span> <span>characteristics</span> of the <span>factory</span>,<br/>
🎧 but also <span>duplicating</span> the <span>skills</span> that the <span>original</span> <span>employees</span> had.<br/>
🎧 <span>Reliance</span> on a <span>template</span> like this <span>offers</span> the <span>huge</span> <span>advantage</span> of <span>built-in</span> <span>consistency</span>.<br/>
