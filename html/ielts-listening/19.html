🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 Oh, good morning.<br/>
🎧 Is this… er… er… room number 26?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's right.<br/>
🎧 So, is this the Student Job Centre?<br/>
🎧 It certainly is.<br/>
🎧 How can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Well, actually I'm looking for a job - a part-time job.<br/>
🎧 Do you have anything available at the moment?<br/>
🎧 Ah, yes… Are you a registered student?<br/>
🎧 I'm afraid this service is only available to full-time students.<br/>
🎧 Yes… I am.<br/>
🎧 I'm doing a degree in Business Studies.<br/>
🎧 Here's my student card.<br/>
🎧 Which year are you in?<br/>
🎧 Well… I've been at uni for four years but...<br/>
🎧 I'm in the third year because I took last year off.<br/>
🎧 Right… well...<br/>
🎧 let's just have a look at what positions are available at the moment.<br/>
🎧 There's a job working at the reception desk at the Sports Centre, for three evenings a week -<br/>
🎧 that's Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays.<br/>
🎧 That sounds like fun but...<br/>
🎧 unfortunately I have evening lectures - so that's not possible, I'm afraid.<br/>
🎧 Is there anything during the day?<br/>
🎧 OK, that's no good then.<br/>
🎧 Um... What about cleaning?<br/>
🎧 There's a position for a cleaner at the Child Care Centre.<br/>
🎧 But you'd need to be there at 6 am.<br/>
🎧 Does that appeal?<br/>
🎧 Six o'clock in the morning!<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's far too early for me, I'm afraid...<br/>
🎧 I'd never make it that early in the morning.<br/>
🎧 Well, there was a position going in the Computer Lab for three days a week that might be okay.<br/>
🎧 Ah, here it is!<br/>
🎧 No, it's in the library, not the lab,<br/>
🎧 Ah... Clerical Assistant required -<br/>
🎧 I think it mostly involves putting the books back on the shelves.<br/>
🎧 Oh no, hang on.<br/>
🎧 It's for Wednesday and Friday evenings again.<br/>
🎧 No, I can't manage that because of the lectures.<br/>
🎧 OK, I'm getting the idea.<br/>
🎧 Ah... look, I'll just get a few details from you anyway,<br/>
🎧 and then we can check through the list and see what comes up.<br/>
🎧 We'll fill in the personal details on this application form first, if that's okay?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's fine.<br/>
🎧 Now, what's your name again?<br/>
🎧 Anita Newman -<br/>
🎧 that's NEWMAN.<br/>
🎧 And your address, Anita?<br/>
🎧 I'm in one of the Halls of Residence for post-graduate students,<br/>
🎧 you know, International House.<br/>
🎧 Okay, that's easy.<br/>
🎧 Er... what's your room number there?<br/>
🎧 Room B569.<br/>
🎧 Er... No, sorry, B659.<br/>
🎧 I always get that wrong. I haven't been living there very long.<br/>
🎧 Do you have any other skills?<br/>
🎧 Typing, languages, that sort of thing?<br/>
🎧 Well, I speak some Japanese.<br/>
🎧 Right, I'll make a note of that.<br/>
🎧 Now, let's see what else is available.<br/>
🎧 What do you think of administrative work?<br/>
🎧 There is a position for an Office Assistant at the English Language Centre.<br/>
🎧 That sounds interesting.<br/>
🎧 It's for 3 days a week -<br/>
🎧 Monday, Friday and Saturday mornings.<br/>
🎧 Interested?<br/>
🎧 Mmm... I was hoping to have Saturdays free.<br/>
🎧 But I need the work so…<br/>
🎧 can you tell me what the job involves?<br/>
🎧 Yup, sure.<br/>
🎧 It says here that you'll be required to deal with student enquiries and answer the phone.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I'm sure I can handle all that without a problem.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 Well, would you like me to arrange an interview for you?<br/>
🎧 Say, Friday morning, around ten?<br/>
🎧 Oh... Ah... Could we make it a bit later?<br/>
🎧 Unfortunately, I've got something to do at ten.<br/>
🎧 Would that be okay?<br/>
🎧 Not a problem.<br/>
🎧 How about eleven thirty?<br/>
🎧 Hope it works out for you Anita.<br/>
🎧 Me too. And thanks for all your help.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 I'm very pleased to have been invited along to your club to talk about our Charity Sponsored Walking Holiday for Education Aid.<br/>
🎧 I'll start by giving you a brief overview of what it entails.<br/>
🎧 First of all, let me explain what we mean by 'sponsored' here.<br/>
🎧 This is where people promise to donate money to the charity if you achieve your goal,<br/>
🎧 in this case, to walk a certain number of miles.<br/>
🎧 Basically we are organizing a ten-day holiday,<br/>
🎧 from the sixth to the sixteenth of November,<br/>
🎧 with eight days actual walking, trekking in the Semira Mountains.<br/>
🎧 Let's have a look at some of the details.<br/>
🎧 We require you to raise sponsorship money of at least $3,200,<br/>
🎧 paying $250 of it upfront as a deposit<br/>
🎧 and the rest in stages throughout the year.<br/>
🎧 Out of this about thirty-five percent will go on your expenses,<br/>
🎧 and that leaves sixty-five percent guaranteed to go to the charity.<br/>
🎧 Which brings me to the most important part.<br/>
🎧 This trek is being specifically organized to help education in the Semira region.<br/>
🎧 Last year we helped train teachers for the disabled,<br/>
🎧 and this year we're focusing on the pupils.<br/>
🎧 Each of the walkers' sponsorship money will go to help an individual special needs pupil in one of the mountain schools.<br/>
🎧 In the second part of the talk, I'll be giving you a lot more details,<br/>
🎧 but back to the basic information.<br/>
🎧 Age limits.<br/>
🎧 This is the second time we have run this kind of holiday and...<br/>
🎧 on the first we even had an eighty-year old,<br/>
🎧 but we found it was wise to establish limits this time.<br/>
🎧 You have to be at least eighteen and the top limit is now seventy,<br/>
🎧 though you need to obtain a health certificate from your doctor if you are over sixty years old.<br/>
🎧 Now, the Semira Mountains are among the highest in the world<br/>
🎧 but you mustn't be too daunted,<br/>
🎧 we will mainly be trekking in the foothills only,<br/>
🎧 although there will be spectacular views even in the foothills.<br/>
🎧 However, you will need to be extremely fit<br/>
🎧 if you aren't now and you're interested in coming with us.<br/>
🎧 You have plenty of time to get into shape.<br/>
🎧 You will be sleeping in tents so you must have quite a bit of equipment with you<br/>
🎧 but you will be helped by local assistants.<br/>
🎧 Your bedding and so forth will be carried by them.<br/>
🎧 We ask that you only walk with a small rucksack with needs for the day.<br/>
🎧 I don't think I've really said enough about the marvelous area you'll be walking in.<br/>
🎧 Let's have a look at some of the sights you'll be seeing.<br/>
🎧 Apart from these spectacular snow-covered peaks and valleys,<br/>
🎧 there are marvelous historic villages.<br/>
🎧 The area has been famous for centuries for making beautiful carpets,<br/>
🎧 although recently there has been a trend to move into weaving blankets and wood carving.<br/>
🎧 The people are extremely friendly and welcoming.<br/>
🎧 We deliberately keep the parties small in size to minimize disruption to people and landscape.<br/>
🎧 I hope that there are still some people interested.<br/>
🎧 I will be distributing leaflets at the end where you can find out more information,<br/>
🎧 but just for the moment I'll outline the itinerary,<br/>
🎧 the main high points of the holiday.<br/>
🎧 Obviously, you'll start by flying out to Kishba, the capital city, on Day One.<br/>
🎧 After a couple of days to acclimatize yourself,<br/>
🎧 you'll start the trek on Day Three walking through the enormous Katiba Forest<br/>
🎧 which will take the whole of the day.<br/>
🎧 Day Four takes us higher up, going through the foothills past a number of villages<br/>
🎧 and visiting a school for the disabled in Sohan.<br/>
🎧 Then you have a rest day, that's Day Five,<br/>
🎧 before going to the spectacular Kumi Temple<br/>
🎧 with twelfth-century carvings, set in a small forest by a lake<br/>
🎧 and that's Day Six, the highlight for many.<br/>
🎧 We stay near there for Day Seven because then comes the hardest day,<br/>
🎧 walking through very mountainous country,<br/>
🎧 but culminating in a swim in the Parteh Falls.<br/>
🎧 This is the highest waterfall in the region.<br/>
🎧 Day Nine is much easier, with part of the day spent in a village where they make some of the gorgeous red blankets.<br/>
🎧 Then back down to Kishba and the journey home.<br/>
🎧 So, you can see it's a pretty packed timetable…<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Thanks to all of you for coming along today to hear about how the robotic float project is helping with ocean research.<br/>
🎧 Well, first of all, we'll look at what a robotic float does and its use.<br/>
🎧 So let's start with the device itself.<br/>
🎧 It looks a bit like a cigar and it's about one and a half meters long.<br/>
🎧 More importantly, it's full of equipment that's designed to collect data.<br/>
🎧 So, it can help us in building up a profile of different factors<br/>
🎧 which work together within the world's oceans.<br/>
🎧 Sounds like a big project - isn't it too big for one country to undertake?<br/>
🎧 That's quite true but this project is a really good example of international co-operation.<br/>
🎧 Over the last five years, scientists from thirteen countries have been taking part in the project<br/>
🎧 and launching floats in their area of ocean control.<br/>
🎧 And next year this number will rise to fourteen when Indonesia joins the project.<br/>
🎧 That's impressive.<br/>
🎧 But let's move onto how floats work.<br/>
🎧 The operational cycle goes like this.<br/>
🎧 Each of the floats is dropped in the ocean from a boat at a set point and activated from a satellite.<br/>
🎧 Then the float immediately sinks about 2,000 meters…<br/>
🎧 that's two whole kilometers down in the water.<br/>
🎧 It stays at this depth for about 10 days<br/>
🎧 and is carried around by the currents which operate in the ocean at this level.<br/>
🎧 During this time it's possible for it to cover quite large distances<br/>
🎧 but the average is fifty kilometers.<br/>
🎧 So, what is it actually recording?<br/>
🎧 Well, at this stage, nothing,<br/>
🎧 but as it rises to the surface, it collects all sorts of data,<br/>
🎧 most importantly variations in salinity,<br/>
🎧 that's salt levels, and the changes in temperature,<br/>
🎧 a bit like underwater weather balloons.<br/>
🎧 Then, when it gets back to the surface all the data it's collected is beamed up to the satellite.<br/>
🎧 After about five hours on the surface,<br/>
🎧 the float automatically sinks, beginning the whole process again.<br/>
🎧 What happens to the data?<br/>
🎧 Well the information is transferred direct to onshore meteorological stations…<br/>
🎧 like our one in Hobart…<br/>
🎧 and within four hours the findings can be on computers<br/>
🎧 and they can be mapped and analysed.<br/>
🎧 You say you're building models of the world's ocean systems but...<br/>
🎧 how're they going to be used, and more importantly, when?<br/>
🎧 Some of the data has already helped in completing projects.<br/>
🎧 For example, our understanding of the underlying causes of El Nino events is being confirmed by float data.<br/>
🎧 Another way we're using float data is to help us to understand the mechanics of climate change,<br/>
🎧 like global warming and ozone depletion.<br/>
🎧 That's part of an ongoing variability study but the results are still a long way off.<br/>
🎧 However, this is not the case with our ocean weather forecasting.<br/>
🎧 Because we know from the floats what the prevailing weather conditions will be in certain parts of the ocean,<br/>
🎧 we can advise the navy on search and rescue missions.<br/>
🎧 That's happening right now<br/>
🎧 and many yachtsmen owe their lives to the success of this project.<br/>
🎧 In addition, the float data can help us to look at the biological implications of ocean processes.<br/>
🎧 Would that help with preserving fish stocks?<br/>
🎧 Yes, and advising governments on fisheries legislation.<br/>
🎧 We're well on the way to completing a project on this.<br/>
🎧 We hope it will help to bring about more sustainable fishing practices.<br/>
🎧 We'll be seeing the results of that quite soon.<br/>
🎧 It sounds like the data from floats has lots of applications.<br/>
🎧 Yes it does.<br/>
🎧 It's also a powerful agricultural tool.<br/>
🎧 If we were aware of what the weather would be like, say, next year,<br/>
🎧 we could make sure that the farmers planted appropriate grain varieties to produce the best yield from the available rainfall.<br/>
🎧 That sounds a bit like science fiction,<br/>
🎧 especially when now we can't even tell them when a drought will break.<br/>
🎧 I agree that this concept is still a long way in the future,<br/>
🎧 but it will come eventually<br/>
🎧 and the float data will have made a contribution.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Good morning everyone.<br/>
🎧 Today's lecture forms part of the Hospitality and Tourism module.<br/>
🎧 Last week I looked at the economy end of the hotel business;<br/>
🎧 this week I'm going to discuss the luxury end of the market.<br/>
🎧 Let's consider the following scenario…<br/>
🎧 You wake up in the middle of the night in a strange hotel miles away from home,<br/>
🎧 disoriented most probably from jet lag,<br/>
🎧 when even the most expensive surroundings can seem empty and dispiriting.<br/>
🎧 You have paid a great deal of money to stay in this first-class hotel with its contemporary technology,<br/>
🎧 but according to recent research carried out by an international travel and public relations company,<br/>
🎧 all is not well.<br/>
🎧 The research suggests that even the most opulent, luxurious hotels seem to have underestimated the most basic needs of their customers -<br/>
🎧 be they travelling for work or pleasure:<br/>
🎧 the need to feel at home in surroundings which are both familiar and inviting.<br/>
🎧 Do these findings, however, apply only to hotels situated in particular areas?<br/>
🎧 Is it possible that the external environment can affect a guest's well-being?<br/>
🎧 The company's research covered a whole range of different hotel types,<br/>
🎧 both independent hotels and those which are part of large chains.<br/>
🎧 They investigated chic so-called boutique hotels in the heart of downtown business districts,<br/>
🎧 stately mansions located in the depths of beautiful countryside,<br/>
🎧 and plush hotels built at the edge of tropical beaches surrounded by palm trees and idyllic blue ocean.<br/>
🎧 And the research concluded that what was outside the hotel building simply didn't matter.<br/>
🎧 This is a fascinating revelation<br/>
🎧 and those of you hoping to move into careers in the travel and leisure industry<br/>
🎧 would be well advised to look at the findings in more detail.<br/>
🎧 But back to the main point of this lecture… the need to feel at home.<br/>
🎧 What can the hotel industry do about it?<br/>
🎧 And is the very idea so subjective that it's impossible to do anything about it on a global basis?<br/>
🎧 However, nothing stands still in this world.<br/>
🎧 One company has come up with the slogan 'Take Your Home With You',<br/>
🎧 and aims to provide clients with luxury serviced apartments.<br/>
🎧 Those in the business travel industry maintain that these serviced apartments<br/>
🎧 dispense with all the unwanted and expensive hotel services that business travellers don't want,<br/>
🎧 while maximising the facilities they do want.<br/>
🎧 For example, not only sleeping and living accommodation,<br/>
🎧 but also a sleek modern kitchen<br/>
🎧 that allows guests to cook and entertain if they wish,<br/>
🎧 at no additional cost.<br/>
🎧 The attractions of such facilities are obvious<br/>
🎧 and it'll be interesting to see whether the company manages to establish a trend all over the world<br/>
🎧 and make a lasting impact on the luxury accommodation market.<br/>
🎧 Now, finally I want to consider the psychology underpinning the traditional holiday hotel industry.<br/>
🎧 As a hotelier, how do you go about attracting people to give up the security of their own home<br/>
🎧 and entrust themselves to staying in a completely strange place<br/>
🎧 and sleeping in an unfamiliar bed?<br/>
🎧 Firstly, hotels exploit people's need to escape the predictability of their everyday lives.<br/>
🎧 For a few days people can pretend they are free of responsibilities<br/>
🎧 and can indulge themselves.<br/>
🎧 Secondly, there is something very powerful in our need to be pampered and looked after,<br/>
🎧 it's almost as if we return to being a baby,<br/>
🎧 when everything was done for us and we felt safe and secure.<br/>
🎧 And not far removed from this is the pleasure in being spoilt and given little treats -<br/>
🎧 like the miniscule bottles of shampoo and tiny bars of soap,<br/>
🎧 the chocolate on your pillow at night -<br/>
🎧 and we actually forget that we are paying for it all!<br/>
🎧 Next week, I'm going to look at eco-hotels, a fairly new phenomenon but increasingly popular…<br/>
<br/><br/>
