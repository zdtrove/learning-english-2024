🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 Oh, good morning.<br/>
🎧 Is <span>this…</span> <span>er…</span> <span>er…</span> room number <span>26</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's right.<br/>
🎧 So, is this the Student <span>Job</span> <span>Centre</span>?<br/>
🎧 It <span>certainly</span> is.<br/>
🎧 How can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Well, actually I'm looking for a <span>job</span> <span>-</span> a <span>part-time</span> <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you have anything <span>available</span> at the <span>moment</span>?<br/>
🎧 Ah, <span>yes…</span> Are you a <span>registered</span> student?<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>afraid</span> this <span>service</span> is only <span>available</span> to <span>full-time</span> students.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yes…</span> I am.<br/>
🎧 I'm doing a <span>degree</span> in <span>Business</span> <span>Studies</span>.<br/>
🎧 Here's my student <span>card</span>.<br/>
🎧 Which year are you in?<br/>
🎧 <span>Well…</span> I've been at <span>uni</span> for <span>four</span> years <span>but..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm in the <span>third</span> year because I took last year off.<br/>
🎧 <span>Right…</span> <span>well..</span>.<br/>
🎧 let's just have a look at what <span>positions</span> are <span>available</span> at the <span>moment</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>job</span> working at the <span>reception</span> <span>desk</span> at the <span>Sports</span> <span>Centre</span>, for <span>three</span> <span>evenings</span> a week <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 that's <span>Wednesdays</span>, <span>Thursdays</span> and <span>Fridays</span>.<br/>
🎧 That sounds like fun <span>but..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>unfortunately</span> I have <span>evening</span> <span>lectures</span> <span>-</span> so that's not <span>possible</span>, I'm <span>afraid</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is there anything during the day?<br/>
🎧 OK, that's no good then.<br/>
🎧 <span>Um..</span>. What about <span>cleaning</span>?<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>position</span> for a <span>cleaner</span> at the <span>Child</span> <span>Care</span> <span>Centre</span>.<br/>
🎧 But you'd need to be there at <span>6</span> am.<br/>
🎧 Does that <span>appeal</span>?<br/>
🎧 Six <span>o'clock</span> in the morning!<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's <span>far</span> too <span>early</span> for me, I'm <span>afraid..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd never make it that <span>early</span> in the morning.<br/>
🎧 Well, there was a <span>position</span> going in the <span>Computer</span> <span>Lab</span> for <span>three</span> <span>days</span> a week that might be okay.<br/>
🎧 Ah, here it is!<br/>
🎧 No, it's in the <span>library</span>, not the <span>lab</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>Ah..</span>. <span>Clerical</span> <span>Assistant</span> <span>required</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 I think it <span>mostly</span> <span>involves</span> <span>putting</span> the books back on the <span>shelves</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh no, <span>hang</span> on.<br/>
🎧 It's for <span>Wednesday</span> and <span>Friday</span> <span>evenings</span> again.<br/>
🎧 No, I can't <span>manage</span> that because of the <span>lectures</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, I'm getting the idea.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ah..</span>. look, I'll just get a few <span>details</span> from you <span>anyway</span>,<br/>
🎧 and then we can check through the <span>list</span> and see what comes up.<br/>
🎧 We'll <span>fill</span> in the personal <span>details</span> on this <span>application</span> <span>form</span> first, if that's okay?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's fine.<br/>
🎧 Now, what's your name again?<br/>
🎧 <span>Anita</span> <span>Newman</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 that's <span>NEWMAN</span>.<br/>
🎧 And your <span>address</span>, <span>Anita</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm in one of the <span>Halls</span> of <span>Residence</span> for <span>post-graduate</span> students,<br/>
🎧 you know, <span>International</span> House.<br/>
🎧 Okay, that's easy.<br/>
🎧 <span>Er..</span>. what's your room number there?<br/>
🎧 Room <span>B569</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Er..</span>. No, sorry, <span>B659</span>.<br/>
🎧 I always get that wrong. I haven't been living there very long.<br/>
🎧 Do you have any other <span>skills</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Typing</span>, <span>languages</span>, that <span>sort</span> of thing?<br/>
🎧 Well, I speak some <span>Japanese</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, I'll make a <span>note</span> of that.<br/>
🎧 Now, let's see what else is <span>available</span>.<br/>
🎧 What do you think of <span>administrative</span> work?<br/>
🎧 There is a <span>position</span> for an <span>Office</span> <span>Assistant</span> at the English <span>Language</span> <span>Centre</span>.<br/>
🎧 That sounds <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's for <span>3</span> <span>days</span> a week <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Monday</span>, <span>Friday</span> and <span>Saturday</span> <span>mornings</span>.<br/>
🎧 Interested?<br/>
🎧 <span>Mmm..</span>. I was <span>hoping</span> to have <span>Saturdays</span> free.<br/>
🎧 But I need the work <span>so…<br/></span>
🎧 can you tell me what the <span>job</span> <span>involves</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Yup</span>, sure.<br/>
🎧 It says here that you'll be <span>required</span> to <span>deal</span> with student <span>enquiries</span> and answer the phone.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I'm sure I can <span>handle</span> all that without a <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 Well, would you like me to <span>arrange</span> an <span>interview</span> for you?<br/>
🎧 Say, <span>Friday</span> morning, around ten?<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh..</span>. <span>Ah..</span>. Could we make it a bit later?<br/>
🎧 <span>Unfortunately</span>, I've got something to do at ten.<br/>
🎧 Would that be okay?<br/>
🎧 Not a <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 How about <span>eleven</span> <span>thirty</span>?<br/>
🎧 Hope it <span>works</span> out for you <span>Anita</span>.<br/>
🎧 Me too. And thanks for all your help.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 I'm very <span>pleased</span> to have been <span>invited</span> along to your <span>club</span> to talk about our <span>Charity</span> <span>Sponsored</span> <span>Walking</span> <span>Holiday</span> for <span>Education</span> <span>Aid</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll start by <span>giving</span> you a <span>brief</span> <span>overview</span> of what it <span>entails</span>.<br/>
🎧 First of all, let me <span>explain</span> what we mean by <span>'sponsored'</span> here.<br/>
🎧 This is where people <span>promise</span> to <span>donate</span> money to the <span>charity</span> if you <span>achieve</span> your <span>goal</span>,<br/>
🎧 in this case, to <span>walk</span> a <span>certain</span> number of <span>miles</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Basically</span> we are <span>organizing</span> a <span>ten-day</span> <span>holiday</span>,<br/>
🎧 from the <span>sixth</span> to the <span>sixteenth</span> of <span>November</span>,<br/>
🎧 with <span>eight</span> <span>days</span> <span>actual</span> <span>walking</span>, <span>trekking</span> in the <span>Semira</span> <span>Mountains</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's have a look at some of the <span>details</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>require</span> you to <span>raise</span> <span>sponsorship</span> money of at <span>least</span> <span>$3,200</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>paying</span> <span>$250</span> of it <span>upfront</span> as a <span>deposit<br/></span>
🎧 and the <span>rest</span> in <span>stages</span> <span>throughout</span> the year.<br/>
🎧 Out of this about <span>thirty-five</span> <span>percent</span> will go on your <span>expenses</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that leaves <span>sixty-five</span> <span>percent</span> <span>guaranteed</span> to go to the <span>charity</span>.<br/>
🎧 Which <span>brings</span> me to the most important <span>part</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>trek</span> is being <span>specifically</span> <span>organized</span> to help <span>education</span> in the <span>Semira</span> <span>region</span>.<br/>
🎧 Last year we <span>helped</span> <span>train</span> <span>teachers</span> for the <span>disabled</span>,<br/>
🎧 and this year we're <span>focusing</span> on the <span>pupils</span>.<br/>
🎧 Each of the <span>walkers'</span> <span>sponsorship</span> money will go to help an <span>individual</span> special needs <span>pupil</span> in one of the <span>mountain</span> <span>schools</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the second <span>part</span> of the talk, I'll be <span>giving</span> you a lot more <span>details</span>,<br/>
🎧 but back to the <span>basic</span> <span>information</span>.<br/>
🎧 Age <span>limits</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is the second time we have run this kind of <span>holiday</span> <span>and..</span>.<br/>
🎧 on the first we even had an <span>eighty-year</span> old,<br/>
🎧 but we <span>found</span> it was <span>wise</span> to <span>establish</span> <span>limits</span> this time.<br/>
🎧 You have to be at <span>least</span> <span>eighteen</span> and the top <span>limit</span> is now <span>seventy</span>,<br/>
🎧 though you need to <span>obtain</span> a <span>health</span> <span>certificate</span> from your <span>doctor</span> if you are over <span>sixty</span> years old.<br/>
🎧 Now, the <span>Semira</span> <span>Mountains</span> are <span>among</span> the <span>highest</span> in the <span>world<br/></span>
🎧 but you mustn't be too <span>daunted</span>,<br/>
🎧 we will <span>mainly</span> be <span>trekking</span> in the <span>foothills</span> only,<br/>
🎧 although there will be <span>spectacular</span> <span>views</span> even in the <span>foothills</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, you will need to be <span>extremely</span> <span>fit<br/></span>
🎧 if you aren't now and you're interested in <span>coming</span> with us.<br/>
🎧 You have <span>plenty</span> of time to get into <span>shape</span>.<br/>
🎧 You will be <span>sleeping</span> in <span>tents</span> so you must have quite a bit of <span>equipment</span> with <span>you<br/></span>
🎧 but you will be <span>helped</span> by <span>local</span> <span>assistants</span>.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>bedding</span> and so <span>forth</span> will be <span>carried</span> by them.<br/>
🎧 We ask that you only <span>walk</span> with a small <span>rucksack</span> with needs for the day.<br/>
🎧 I don't think I've really said enough about the <span>marvelous</span> <span>area</span> you'll be <span>walking</span> in.<br/>
🎧 Let's have a look at some of the <span>sights</span> you'll be <span>seeing</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Apart</span> from these <span>spectacular</span> <span>snow-covered</span> <span>peaks</span> and <span>valleys</span>,<br/>
🎧 there are <span>marvelous</span> <span>historic</span> <span>villages</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>area</span> has been famous for <span>centuries</span> for <span>making</span> <span>beautiful</span> <span>carpets</span>,<br/>
🎧 although <span>recently</span> there has been a <span>trend</span> to move into <span>weaving</span> <span>blankets</span> and <span>wood</span> <span>carving</span>.<br/>
🎧 The people are <span>extremely</span> <span>friendly</span> and <span>welcoming</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>deliberately</span> keep the <span>parties</span> small in size to <span>minimize</span> <span>disruption</span> to people and <span>landscape</span>.<br/>
🎧 I hope that there are still some people interested.<br/>
🎧 I will be <span>distributing</span> <span>leaflets</span> at the end where you can find out more <span>information</span>,<br/>
🎧 but just for the <span>moment</span> I'll <span>outline</span> the <span>itinerary</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>main</span> high <span>points</span> of the <span>holiday</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Obviously</span>, you'll start by <span>flying</span> out to <span>Kishba</span>, the <span>capital</span> <span>city</span>, on Day One.<br/>
🎧 After a <span>couple</span> of <span>days</span> to <span>acclimatize</span> yourself,<br/>
🎧 you'll start the <span>trek</span> on Day <span>Three</span> <span>walking</span> through the <span>enormous</span> <span>Katiba</span> <span>Forest<br/></span>
🎧 which will take the whole of the day.<br/>
🎧 Day <span>Four</span> takes us <span>higher</span> up, going through the <span>foothills</span> <span>past</span> a number of <span>villages<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>visiting</span> a school for the <span>disabled</span> in <span>Sohan</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then you have a <span>rest</span> day, that's Day <span>Five</span>,<br/>
🎧 before going to the <span>spectacular</span> <span>Kumi</span> <span>Temple<br/></span>
🎧 with <span>twelfth-century</span> <span>carvings</span>, set in a small <span>forest</span> by a <span>lake<br/></span>
🎧 and that's Day Six, the <span>highlight</span> for many.<br/>
🎧 We <span>stay</span> near there for Day <span>Seven</span> because then comes the <span>hardest</span> day,<br/>
🎧 <span>walking</span> through very <span>mountainous</span> <span>country</span>,<br/>
🎧 but <span>culminating</span> in a <span>swim</span> in the <span>Parteh</span> <span>Falls</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is the <span>highest</span> <span>waterfall</span> in the <span>region</span>.<br/>
🎧 Day <span>Nine</span> is much <span>easier</span>, with <span>part</span> of the day <span>spent</span> in a <span>village</span> where they make some of the <span>gorgeous</span> red <span>blankets</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then back down to <span>Kishba</span> and the <span>journey</span> home.<br/>
🎧 So, you can see it's a <span>pretty</span> <span>packed</span> <span>timetable…<br/>
</span> <span><br/>

🎧 Thanks to all of you for <span>coming</span> along today to hear about how the <span>robotic</span> <span>float</span> <span>project</span> is <span>helping</span> with <span>ocean</span> <span>research</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, first of all, we'll look at what a <span>robotic</span> <span>float</span> does and its use.<br/>
🎧 So let's start with the <span>device</span> <span>itself</span>.<br/>
🎧 It looks a bit like a <span>cigar</span> and it's about one and a <span>half</span> <span>meters</span> long.<br/>
🎧 More <span>importantly</span>, it's full of <span>equipment</span> that's <span>designed</span> to <span>collect</span> <span>data</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, it can help us in <span>building</span> up a <span>profile</span> of different <span>factors<br/></span>
🎧 which work together <span>within</span> the <span>world's</span> <span>oceans</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sounds like a big <span>project</span> <span>-</span> isn't it too big for one <span>country</span> to <span>undertake</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's quite <span>true</span> but this <span>project</span> is a really good example of <span>international</span> <span>co-operation</span>.<br/>
🎧 Over the last <span>five</span> years, <span>scientists</span> from <span>thirteen</span> <span>countries</span> have been taking <span>part</span> in the <span>project<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>launching</span> <span>floats</span> in their <span>area</span> of <span>ocean</span> <span>control</span>.<br/>
🎧 And next year this number will <span>rise</span> to <span>fourteen</span> when <span>Indonesia</span> <span>joins</span> the <span>project</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>impressive</span>.<br/>
🎧 But let's move <span>onto</span> how <span>floats</span> work.<br/>
🎧 The <span>operational</span> <span>cycle</span> <span>goes</span> like this.<br/>
🎧 Each of the <span>floats</span> is <span>dropped</span> in the <span>ocean</span> from a <span>boat</span> at a set <span>point</span> and <span>activated</span> from a <span>satellite</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then the <span>float</span> <span>immediately</span> <span>sinks</span> about <span>2,000</span> <span>meters…<br/></span>
🎧 that's two whole <span>kilometers</span> down in the water.<br/>
🎧 It <span>stays</span> at this <span>depth</span> for about <span>10</span> <span>days<br/></span>
🎧 and is <span>carried</span> around by the <span>currents</span> which <span>operate</span> in the <span>ocean</span> at this <span>level</span>.<br/>
🎧 During this time it's <span>possible</span> for it to <span>cover</span> quite large <span>distances<br/></span>
🎧 but the <span>average</span> is <span>fifty</span> <span>kilometers</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, what is it actually <span>recording</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, at this <span>stage</span>, <span>nothing</span>,<br/>
🎧 but as it <span>rises</span> to the <span>surface</span>, it <span>collects</span> all <span>sorts</span> of <span>data</span>,<br/>
🎧 most <span>importantly</span> <span>variations</span> in <span>salinity</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's <span>salt</span> <span>levels</span>, and the changes in <span>temperature</span>,<br/>
🎧 a bit like <span>underwater</span> <span>weather</span> <span>balloons</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then, when it <span>gets</span> back to the <span>surface</span> all the <span>data</span> it's <span>collected</span> is <span>beamed</span> up to the <span>satellite</span>.<br/>
🎧 After about <span>five</span> hours on the <span>surface</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>float</span> <span>automatically</span> <span>sinks</span>, <span>beginning</span> the whole <span>process</span> again.<br/>
🎧 What <span>happens</span> to the <span>data</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well the <span>information</span> is <span>transferred</span> <span>direct</span> to <span>onshore</span> <span>meteorological</span> <span>stations…<br/></span>
🎧 like our one in <span>Hobart…<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>within</span> <span>four</span> hours the <span>findings</span> can be on <span>computers<br/></span>
🎧 and they can be <span>mapped</span> and <span>analysed</span>.<br/>
🎧 You say you're <span>building</span> <span>models</span> of the <span>world's</span> <span>ocean</span> <span>systems</span> <span>but..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>how're</span> they going to be used, and more <span>importantly</span>, when?<br/>
🎧 Some of the <span>data</span> has already <span>helped</span> in <span>completing</span> <span>projects</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, our <span>understanding</span> of the <span>underlying</span> <span>causes</span> of <span>El</span> <span>Nino</span> <span>events</span> is being <span>confirmed</span> by <span>float</span> <span>data</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another way we're <span>using</span> <span>float</span> <span>data</span> is to help us to <span>understand</span> the <span>mechanics</span> of <span>climate</span> change,<br/>
🎧 like <span>global</span> <span>warming</span> and <span>ozone</span> <span>depletion</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>part</span> of an <span>ongoing</span> <span>variability</span> <span>study</span> but the <span>results</span> are still a long way off.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, this is not the case with our <span>ocean</span> <span>weather</span> <span>forecasting</span>.<br/>
🎧 Because we know from the <span>floats</span> what the <span>prevailing</span> <span>weather</span> <span>conditions</span> will be in <span>certain</span> <span>parts</span> of the <span>ocean</span>,<br/>
🎧 we can <span>advise</span> the <span>navy</span> on <span>search</span> and <span>rescue</span> <span>missions</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>happening</span> right <span>now<br/></span>
🎧 and many <span>yachtsmen</span> <span>owe</span> their lives to the success of this <span>project</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>addition</span>, the <span>float</span> <span>data</span> can help us to look at the <span>biological</span> <span>implications</span> of <span>ocean</span> <span>processes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Would that help with <span>preserving</span> <span>fish</span> <span>stocks</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, and <span>advising</span> <span>governments</span> on <span>fisheries</span> <span>legislation</span>.<br/>
🎧 We're well on the way to <span>completing</span> a <span>project</span> on this.<br/>
🎧 We hope it will help to <span>bring</span> about more <span>sustainable</span> <span>fishing</span> <span>practices</span>.<br/>
🎧 We'll be <span>seeing</span> the <span>results</span> of that quite soon.<br/>
🎧 It sounds like the <span>data</span> from <span>floats</span> has lots of <span>applications</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes it does.<br/>
🎧 It's also a <span>powerful</span> <span>agricultural</span> <span>tool</span>.<br/>
🎧 If we were <span>aware</span> of what the <span>weather</span> would be like, say, next year,<br/>
🎧 we could make sure that the <span>farmers</span> <span>planted</span> <span>appropriate</span> <span>grain</span> <span>varieties</span> to <span>produce</span> the best <span>yield</span> from the <span>available</span> <span>rainfall</span>.<br/>
🎧 That sounds a bit like <span>science</span> <span>fiction</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>especially</span> when now we can't even tell them when a <span>drought</span> will <span>break</span>.<br/>
🎧 I agree that this <span>concept</span> is still a long way in the future,<br/>
🎧 but it will come <span>eventually<br/></span>
🎧 and the <span>float</span> <span>data</span> will have made a <span>contribution</span>.<br/>

🎧 Good morning everyone.<br/>
🎧 <span>Today's</span> <span>lecture</span> <span>forms</span> <span>part</span> of the <span>Hospitality</span> and <span>Tourism</span> <span>module</span>.<br/>
🎧 Last week I <span>looked</span> at the <span>economy</span> end of the <span>hotel</span> <span>business;<br/></span>
🎧 this week I'm going to <span>discuss</span> the <span>luxury</span> end of the <span>market</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's <span>consider</span> the <span>following</span> <span>scenario…<br/></span>
🎧 You <span>wake</span> up in the <span>middle</span> of the <span>night</span> in a <span>strange</span> <span>hotel</span> <span>miles</span> away from home,<br/>
🎧 <span>disoriented</span> most probably from <span>jet</span> <span>lag</span>,<br/>
🎧 when even the most <span>expensive</span> <span>surroundings</span> can <span>seem</span> empty and <span>dispiriting</span>.<br/>
🎧 You have <span>paid</span> a great <span>deal</span> of money to <span>stay</span> in this <span>first-class</span> <span>hotel</span> with its <span>contemporary</span> <span>technology</span>,<br/>
🎧 but <span>according</span> to <span>recent</span> <span>research</span> <span>carried</span> out by an <span>international</span> travel and <span>public</span> <span>relations</span> company,<br/>
🎧 all is not well.<br/>
🎧 The <span>research</span> <span>suggests</span> that even the most <span>opulent</span>, <span>luxurious</span> <span>hotels</span> <span>seem</span> to have <span>underestimated</span> the most <span>basic</span> needs of their <span>customers</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 be they <span>travelling</span> for work or <span>pleasure:<br/></span>
🎧 the need to feel at home in <span>surroundings</span> which are both <span>familiar</span> and <span>inviting</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do these <span>findings</span>, <span>however</span>, <span>apply</span> only to <span>hotels</span> <span>situated</span> in <span>particular</span> <span>areas</span>?<br/>
🎧 Is it <span>possible</span> that the <span>external</span> <span>environment</span> can <span>affect</span> a <span>guest's</span> <span>well-being</span>?<br/>
🎧 The <span>company's</span> <span>research</span> <span>covered</span> a whole <span>range</span> of different <span>hotel</span> <span>types</span>,<br/>
🎧 both <span>independent</span> <span>hotels</span> and those which are <span>part</span> of large <span>chains</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>investigated</span> <span>chic</span> <span>so-called</span> <span>boutique</span> <span>hotels</span> in the <span>heart</span> of <span>downtown</span> <span>business</span> <span>districts</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>stately</span> <span>mansions</span> <span>located</span> in the <span>depths</span> of <span>beautiful</span> <span>countryside</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>plush</span> <span>hotels</span> <span>built</span> at the <span>edge</span> of <span>tropical</span> <span>beaches</span> <span>surrounded</span> by <span>palm</span> <span>trees</span> and <span>idyllic</span> <span>blue</span> <span>ocean</span>.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>research</span> <span>concluded</span> that what was outside the <span>hotel</span> <span>building</span> <span>simply</span> didn't <span>matter</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is a <span>fascinating</span> <span>revelation<br/></span>
🎧 and those of you <span>hoping</span> to move into <span>careers</span> in the travel and <span>leisure</span> <span>industry<br/></span>
🎧 would be well <span>advised</span> to look at the <span>findings</span> in more <span>detail</span>.<br/>
🎧 But back to the <span>main</span> <span>point</span> of this <span>lecture…</span> the need to feel at home.<br/>
🎧 What can the <span>hotel</span> <span>industry</span> do about it?<br/>
🎧 And is the very idea so <span>subjective</span> that it's <span>impossible</span> to do anything about it on a <span>global</span> <span>basis</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, <span>nothing</span> <span>stands</span> still in this <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 One company has come up with the <span>slogan</span> <span>'Take</span> Your Home With <span>You'</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>aims</span> to <span>provide</span> <span>clients</span> with <span>luxury</span> <span>serviced</span> <span>apartments</span>.<br/>
🎧 Those in the <span>business</span> travel <span>industry</span> <span>maintain</span> that these <span>serviced</span> <span>apartments<br/></span>
🎧 <span>dispense</span> with all the <span>unwanted</span> and <span>expensive</span> <span>hotel</span> <span>services</span> that <span>business</span> <span>travellers</span> don't want,<br/>
🎧 while <span>maximising</span> the <span>facilities</span> they do want.<br/>
🎧 For example, not only <span>sleeping</span> and living <span>accommodation</span>,<br/>
🎧 but also a <span>sleek</span> <span>modern</span> <span>kitchen<br/></span>
🎧 that <span>allows</span> <span>guests</span> to <span>cook</span> and <span>entertain</span> if they wish,<br/>
🎧 at no <span>additional</span> <span>cost</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>attractions</span> of such <span>facilities</span> are <span>obvious<br/></span>
🎧 and it'll be <span>interesting</span> to see <span>whether</span> the company <span>manages</span> to <span>establish</span> a <span>trend</span> all over the <span>world<br/></span>
🎧 and make a <span>lasting</span> <span>impact</span> on the <span>luxury</span> <span>accommodation</span> <span>market</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, finally I want to <span>consider</span> the <span>psychology</span> <span>underpinning</span> the <span>traditional</span> <span>holiday</span> <span>hotel</span> <span>industry</span>.<br/>
🎧 As a <span>hotelier</span>, how do you go about <span>attracting</span> people to give up the <span>security</span> of their own <span>home<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>entrust</span> <span>themselves</span> to <span>staying</span> in a <span>completely</span> <span>strange</span> <span>place<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>sleeping</span> in an <span>unfamiliar</span> bed?<br/>
🎧 <span>Firstly</span>, <span>hotels</span> <span>exploit</span> <span>people's</span> need to <span>escape</span> the <span>predictability</span> of their everyday lives.<br/>
🎧 For a few <span>days</span> people can <span>pretend</span> they are free of <span>responsibilities<br/></span>
🎧 and can <span>indulge</span> <span>themselves</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Secondly</span>, there is something very <span>powerful</span> in our need to be <span>pampered</span> and <span>looked</span> after,<br/>
🎧 it's almost as if we <span>return</span> to being a <span>baby</span>,<br/>
🎧 when everything was done for us and we <span>felt</span> <span>safe</span> and <span>secure</span>.<br/>
🎧 And not <span>far</span> <span>removed</span> from this is the <span>pleasure</span> in being <span>spoilt</span> and <span>given</span> little <span>treats</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 like the <span>miniscule</span> <span>bottles</span> of <span>shampoo</span> and <span>tiny</span> <span>bars</span> of <span>soap</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>chocolate</span> on your <span>pillow</span> at <span>night</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and we actually <span>forget</span> that we are <span>paying</span> for it all!<br/>
🎧 Next week, I'm going to look at <span>eco-hotels</span>, a <span>fairly</span> new <span>phenomenon</span> but <span>increasingly</span> <span>popular…<br/>
