🎧 Hello, <span>South</span> <span>City</span> <span>Cycling</span> <span>Club</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, hi.<br/>
🎧 I want to find out about <span>joining</span> the <span>club</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right. I can help you there.<br/>
🎧 I'm the <span>club</span> <span>secretary</span> and my <span>name's</span> <span>Jim</span> <span>Hunter</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, hi <span>Jim</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, are you interested in <span>membership</span> for yourself?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 OK. Well there are <span>basically</span> two <span>types</span> of <span>adult</span> <span>membership</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you're <span>pretty</span> serious about <span>cycling</span>, there's the Full <span>membership</span>.<br/>
🎧 That <span>costs</span> <span>$260<br/></span>
🎧 and that <span>covers</span> you not just for <span>ordinary</span> <span>cycling<br/></span>
🎧 but also for <span>races</span> both here in the <span>city</span> and also in other <span>parts</span> of <span>Australia</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right. Well, I'm not really up to that <span>standard</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was more interested in just <span>joining</span> a group to do some <span>cycling</span> in my free time.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 That's why most people join.<br/>
🎧 So, in that case you'd be better with the <span>Recreational</span> <span>membership</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>$108</span> if you're over <span>19</span>, and <span>$95</span> if you're under.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>25</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>paid</span> <span>quarterly</span>, and you can <span>upgrade</span> it later to the Full <span>membership</span> if you want to, of course.<br/>
🎧 Now both <span>types</span> of <span>membership</span> <span>include</span> the <span>club</span> <span>fee</span> of <span>$20</span>.<br/>
🎧 They also <span>provide</span> <span>insurance</span> in case you have an <span>accident</span>, though we hope you won't need that, of course.<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 OK, well, I'll go with the <span>Recreational</span> <span>membership</span>, I think.<br/>
🎧 And that <span>allows</span> me to join in the <span>club</span> <span>activities</span>, and so on?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 And once you're a <span>member</span> of the <span>club</span>, you're also <span>permitted</span> to <span>wear</span> our <span>kit</span> when you're out <span>cycling</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>green</span> and <span>white</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I've <span>seen</span> <span>cyclists</span> <span>wearing</span> it.<br/>
🎧 So, can I buy that at the <span>club</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Ah.</span>. no, it's made to order by a company in <span>Brisbane</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can find them online: they're called <span>Jerriz</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>J-E-R-R-I-Z</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can use your <span>membership</span> number to put in an order on their <span>website</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Now, can you tell me a bit about the <span>rides</span> I can do?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 So we have <span>training</span> <span>rides</span> <span>pretty</span> well every morning,<br/>
🎧 and they're a really good way of <span>improving</span> your <span>cycling</span> <span>skills</span> as well as your <span>general</span> <span>level</span> of <span>fitness</span>,<br/>
🎧 but they're different <span>levels</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Level</span> A is <span>pretty</span> <span>fast</span> <span>-</span> you're looking at about <span>30</span> or <span>35</span> <span>kilometres</span> an <span>hour</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you can do about <span>25</span> <span>kilometres</span> an <span>hour</span>, you'd probably be <span>level</span> <span>B</span>,<br/>
🎧 and then <span>level</span> <span>C</span> are the <span>novices</span>, who <span>stay</span> at about <span>15</span> <span>kilometres</span> <span>per</span> <span>hour</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Well I <span>reckon</span> I'd be <span>level</span> <span>B</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, when are the <span>sessions</span> for that <span>level</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Ah..</span>. there are a <span>couple</span> each week.<br/>
🎧 They're both <span>early</span> morning <span>sessions</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's one on <span>Tuesdays</span>, and for that one you meet at <span>5.30</span> am,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>meeting</span> <span>point's</span> the <span>stadium</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you know where that is?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's quite near my home, in <span>fact</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, and how about the other one?<br/>
🎧 That's on <span>Thursdays</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>starts</span> at the same time, but they meet at the <span>main</span> <span>gate</span> to the <span>park</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is that the one just <span>past</span> the <span>shopping</span> <span>mall</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's it.<br/>
🎧 So how long are the <span>rides</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Ah.</span>. they're about an <span>hour</span> and a <span>half</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, if you have a <span>job</span> it's easy to fit in before you go to work.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>members</span> often go somewhere for <span>coffee</span> <span>afterwards</span>, so it's quite a <span>social</span> <span>event</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK. That sounds good.<br/>
🎧 I've only just <span>moved</span> to the <span>city</span> so I don't actually know many people yet.<br/>
🎧 Well, it's a great way to meet people.<br/>
🎧 And does each <span>ride</span> have a <span>leader</span>?<br/>
🎧 Sometimes, but not always.<br/>
🎧 But you don't really need <span>one;</span> the group <span>members</span> on the <span>ride</span> <span>support</span> one another, <span>anyway</span>.<br/>
🎧 How would we know where to go?<br/>
🎧 If you check the <span>club</span> <span>website</span>, you'll see that the <span>route</span> for each <span>ride</span> is <span>clearly</span> <span>marked</span>.<br/>
🎧 So you can just <span>print</span> that out and take it along with you.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>similar</span> from one week to another, but it's not always exactly the same.<br/>
🎧 And what do I need to <span>bring</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>bring</span> a <span>bottle</span> of water, and your phone.<br/>
🎧 You shouldn't use it while you're <span>cycling</span>, but have it with you.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And in <span>winter</span>, it's well before <span>sunrise</span> when we set out,<br/>
🎧 so you need to make sure your <span>bike's</span> got <span>lights</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's OK.<br/>
🎧 Well, thanks <span>Jim</span>. I'd definitely like to join.<br/>
🎧 So what's the best way of going about it?<br/>
🎧 <span>Ah.</span>. you <span>can…<br/></span><br />

🎧 Thanks for <span>coming</span> everyone.<br/>
🎧 OK, so this <span>meeting</span> is for new <span>staff</span> and <span>staff</span> who haven't been <span>involved</span> with our <span>volunteering</span> <span>projects</span> yet.<br/>
🎧 So <span>basically</span>, the idea is that we <span>allow</span> <span>staff</span> to give up some of their work <span>time<br/></span>
🎧 to help on <span>various</span> <span>charity</span> <span>projects</span> to <span>benefit</span> the <span>local</span> <span>community</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've been doing this for the last <span>five</span> years and it's been very <span>successful</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Participating</span> doesn't <span>necessarily</span> <span>involve</span> a <span>huge</span> time <span>commitment</span>.<br/>
🎧 The company will pay for <span>eight</span> hours of your time.<br/>
🎧 That can be used over one or two <span>days</span> all at once,<br/>
🎧 or <span>spread</span> over <span>several</span> <span>months</span> <span>throughout</span> the year.<br/>
🎧 There are some <span>staff</span> who enjoy <span>volunteering</span> so <span>much<br/></span>
🎧 they also give up their own free time for a <span>couple</span> of hours every week.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>completely</span> up to you.<br/>
🎧 <span>Obviously</span>, many people will have <span>family</span> <span>commitments</span> and aren't as <span>available</span> as other <span>members</span> of <span>staff</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Feedback</span> from <span>staff</span> has been <span>overwhelmingly</span> <span>positive</span>.<br/>
🎧 Because they <span>felt</span> they were doing something really <span>useful</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>nearly</span> everyone agreed that <span>volunteering</span> made them feel more <span>motivated</span> at work.<br/>
🎧 They also <span>liked</span> <span>building</span> <span>relationships</span> with the people in the <span>local</span> <span>community</span> and <span>felt</span> <span>valued</span> by them.<br/>
🎧 One or two people also said it was a good thing to have on their <span>CVs</span>.<br/>
🎧 One <span>particularly</span> <span>successful</span> <span>project</span> last year was the Get Working <span>Project</span>.<br/>
🎧 This was <span>aimed</span> at <span>helping</span> <span>unemployed</span> people in the <span>area</span> get back to work.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>staff</span> were able to help them <span>improve</span> their <span>telephone</span> <span>skills</span>,<br/>
🎧 such as <span>writing</span> down <span>messages</span> and <span>speaking</span> with <span>confidence</span> to <span>potential</span> <span>customers</span>,<br/>
🎧 which they had <span>found</span> quite <span>difficult</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is something many <span>employers</span> look for in <span>job</span> <span>applicants</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and something we all do without even thinking about, every day at work.<br/>
🎧 We've got an <span>exciting</span> new <span>project</span> <span>starting</span> this year.<br/>
🎧 Up until now, we've <span>mainly</span> <span>focused</span> on <span>projects</span> to do with <span>education</span> and <span>training</span>.<br/>
🎧 And we'll <span>continue</span> with our <span>reading</span> <span>project</span> in <span>schools</span> and our work with <span>local</span> <span>charities</span>.<br/>
🎧 But we've also agreed to help out on a <span>conservation</span> <span>project</span> in <span>Redfern</span> <span>Park</span>.<br/>
🎧 So if any of you <span>fancy</span> being outside and getting your <span>hands</span> <span>dirty</span>, this is the <span>project</span> for you.<br/>
🎧 I also want to <span>mention</span> the <span>annual</span> <span>Digital</span> <span>Inclusion</span> Day, which is <span>coming</span> up next month.<br/>
🎧 The <span>aim</span> of this is to help <span>older</span> people keep up with <span>technology</span>.<br/>
🎧 And this year, <span>instead</span> of <span>hosting</span> the <span>event</span> in our own <span>training</span> <span>facility</span>,<br/>
🎧 we're <span>using</span> the <span>ICT</span> <span>suite</span> at <span>Hill</span> <span>College</span>,<br/>
🎧 as it can <span>hold</span> <span>far</span> more people.<br/>
🎧 We've <span>invited</span> over <span>60</span> people from the <span>Silver</span> Age <span>Community</span> <span>Centre</span> to take <span>part</span>,<br/>
🎧 so we'll need a lot of <span>volunteers</span> to help with this <span>event</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you're interested in taking <span>part</span>,<br/>
🎧 please go to the <span>volunteering</span> <span>section</span> of our <span>website</span> and <span>complete</span> the <span>relevant</span> <span>form</span>.<br/>
🎧 We won't be <span>providing</span> any <span>training</span> for <span>this<br/></span>
🎧 but you'll be <span>paired</span> with an <span>experienced</span> <span>volunteer</span> if you've never done it before.<br/>
🎧 By the way, don't <span>forget</span> to tell your <span>manager</span> about any <span>volunteering</span> <span>activities</span> you decide to do.<br/>
🎧 The <span>participants</span> on the <span>Digital</span> <span>Inclusion</span> Day really <span>benefited</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>majority</span> were in their <span>seventies</span>,<br/>
🎧 though some were <span>younger</span> and a few were even in their <span>nineties</span>!<br/>
🎧 Quite a few <span>owned</span> both a <span>computer</span> and a <span>mobile</span> phone,<br/>
🎧 but these <span>tended</span> to be <span>outdated</span> <span>models</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>generally</span> <span>knew</span> how to do simple things, like <span>send</span> <span>texts</span>,<br/>
🎧 but weren't <span>aware</span> of <span>recent</span> <span>developments</span> in <span>mobile</span> phone <span>technology</span>.<br/>
🎧 A few were <span>keen</span> to learn but most were quite <span>dismissive</span> at first <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 they couldn't see the <span>point</span> of <span>updating</span> their <span>skills</span>.<br/>
🎧 But that soon <span>changed</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>feedback</span> was very <span>positive</span>.<br/>
🎧 The really <span>encouraging</span> thing was that <span>participants</span> all <span>said<br/></span>
🎧 they <span>felt</span> much more <span>confident</span> about <span>using</span> <span>social</span> <span>media</span> to keep in touch with their <span>grandchildren</span>,<br/>
🎧 who <span>prefer</span> this <span>form</span> of <span>communication</span> to <span>phoning</span> or <span>sending</span> <span>emails</span>.<br/>
🎧 A lot of them also said playing online <span>games</span> would help them make new friends and keep their <span>brains</span> <span>active</span>.<br/>
🎧 They weren't that <span>impressed</span> with being able to order their <span>groceries</span> online,<br/>
🎧 as they <span>liked</span> going out to the <span>shops</span>,<br/>
🎧 but some said it would come in <span>handy</span> if they were <span>ill</span> or the <span>weather</span> was really bad.<br/>
🎧 One thing they <span>asked</span> about was <span>using</span> <span>tablets</span> for things like <span>reading</span> <span>newspapers</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 some people had been <span>given</span> <span>tablets</span> as <span>presents</span> but had never used them,<br/>
🎧 so that's something we'll make sure we <span>include</span> this <span>time…<br/></span><br />

🎧 <span>Ah…</span> come in, <span>Russ</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Now you wanted to <span>consult</span> me about your class <span>presentation</span> on <span>nanotechnology</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 you're <span>due</span> to give it in next week, aren't you?<br/>
🎧 That's right. And I'm really <span>struggling</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>chose</span> the <span>topic</span> because I didn't know much about it and wanted to learn more,<br/>
🎧 but now I've read so much about it, in a way there's too much to say <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 I could talk for much <span>longer</span> than the <span>twenty</span> <span>minutes</span> I've been <span>allocated</span>.<br/>
🎧 Should I <span>assume</span> the other students don't know much, and give them a kind of <span>general</span> <span>introduction</span>,<br/>
🎧 or should I try and make them share my <span>fascination</span> with a <span>particular</span> <span>aspect</span>?<br/>
🎧 You could do either,<br/>
🎧 but you'll need to have it <span>clear</span> in your own <span>mind</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then I think I'll give an <span>overview</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Now, one way of <span>approaching</span> this is to work through <span>developments</span> in <span>chronological</span> order.<br/>
🎧 On the other <span>hand</span>, you could talk about the <span>numerous</span> <span>ways</span> that <span>nanotechnology</span> is being <span>applied</span>.<br/>
🎧 You mean things like <span>thin</span> <span>films</span> on <span>camera</span> <span>displays</span> to make them <span>water-repellent</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>additives</span> to make <span>motorcycle</span> <span>helmets</span> <span>stronger</span> and <span>lighter</span>.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 Or another way would be to focus on its <span>impact</span> in one <span>particular</span> <span>area</span>,<br/>
🎧 say <span>medicine</span>, or <span>space</span> <span>exploration</span>.<br/>
🎧 That would make it <span>easier</span> to focus.<br/>
🎧 <span>Perhaps</span> I should do that.<br/>
🎧 I think that would be a good idea.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 How important is it to <span>include</span> <span>slides</span> in the <span>presentation</span>?<br/>
🎧 They aren't <span>essential</span>, by any <span>means</span>.<br/>
🎧 And there's a <span>danger</span> of <span>tailoring</span> what you say to fit whatever <span>slides</span> you can find.<br/>
🎧 While it can be good to <span>include</span> <span>slides</span>,<br/>
🎧 you could end up spending too long looking for <span>suitable</span> <span>ones</span>.<br/>
🎧 You might find it better to leave them out.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 Another thing I was <span>wondering</span> about was how to start.<br/>
🎧 I know <span>presentations</span> often <span>begin</span> <span>with<br/></span>
🎧 <span>'First</span> I'm going to talk about this, and then I'll talk about <span>that'</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I thought about <span>asking</span> the <span>audience</span> what they know about <span>nanotechnology</span>.<br/>
🎧 That would be fine if you had an <span>hour</span> or two for the <span>presentation</span>,<br/>
🎧 but you might find that you can't do anything with the <span>answers</span> you get,<br/>
🎧 and it <span>simply</span> <span>eats</span> into the short time that's <span>available</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, maybe I should <span>mention</span> a <span>particular</span> way that <span>nanotechnology</span> is used, to focus <span>people's</span> <span>attention</span>.<br/>
🎧 That sounds <span>sensible</span>.<br/>
🎧 What do you think I should do next?<br/>
🎧 I really have to plan the <span>presentation</span> today and <span>tomorrow</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>initially</span> I think you should <span>ignore</span> all the <span>notes</span> you've made,<br/>
🎧 take a small <span>piece</span> of <span>paper</span>, and <span>write</span> a <span>single</span> short <span>sentence</span> that <span>ties</span> together the whole <span>presentation</span>:<br/>
🎧 it can be something as simple as <span>'Nanotechnology</span> is already <span>improving</span> our <span>lives'</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then start planning the <span>content</span> around that.<br/>
🎧 You can always <span>modify</span> that <span>sentence</span> later, if you need to.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 OK, now let's think about actually <span>giving</span> the <span>presentation</span>.<br/>
🎧 You've only <span>given</span> one before, if I remember <span>correctly</span>,<br/>
🎧 about an <span>experiment</span> you'd been <span>involved</span> in.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>pretty</span> <span>rubbish</span>!<br/>
🎧 Let's say it was better in some <span>respects</span> than in <span>others</span>.<br/>
🎧 With <span>regard</span> to the <span>structure</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>felt</span> that you <span>ended</span> rather <span>abruptly</span>, without <span>rounding</span> it off.<br/>
🎧 Be <span>careful</span> not to do that in next <span>week's</span> <span>presentation</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And you made very little eye <span>contact</span> with the <span>audience</span>,<br/>
🎧 because you were looking down at your <span>notes</span> most of the time.<br/>
🎧 You need to be looking at the <span>audience</span> and only <span>occasionally</span> <span>glancing</span> at your <span>notes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>body</span> <span>language</span> was a little <span>odd</span>.<br/>
🎧 Every time you <span>showed</span> a <span>slide</span>, you <span>turned</span> your back on the <span>audience</span> so you could look at it <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 you should have been looking at your <span>laptop</span>.<br/>
🎧 And you <span>kept</span> <span>scratching</span> your <span>head</span>,<br/>
🎧 so I <span>found</span> myself <span>wondering</span> when you were next going to do that,<br/>
🎧 <span>instead</span> of <span>listening</span> to what you were saying!<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>dear</span>.<br/>
🎧 What did you think of the <span>language</span>?<br/>
🎧 I <span>knew</span> that not everyone was <span>familiar</span> with the <span>subject</span>,<br/>
🎧 so I <span>tried</span> to make it as simple as I could.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that came across.<br/>
🎧 You used a few <span>words</span> that are <span>specific</span> to the <span>field</span>,<br/>
🎧 but you always <span>explained</span> what they <span>meant</span>,<br/>
🎧 so the <span>audience</span> wouldn't have had any <span>difficulty</span> <span>understanding</span>.<br/>
🎧 I must say the <span>handouts</span> you <span>prepared</span> were well thought out.<br/>
🎧 They were a good <span>summary</span> of your <span>presentation</span>,<br/>
🎧 which people would have been able to <span>refer</span> to later on.<br/>
🎧 So well done on that.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Well, I hope that helps you with next <span>week's</span> <span>presentation</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it will. Thanks a lot.<br/>
🎧 I'll look forward to <span>seeing</span> a big <span>improvement</span>, then.<br/><br />

🎧 Today, we'll be <span>continuing</span> the <span>series</span> of <span>lectures</span> on <span>memory<br/></span>
🎧 by <span>focusing</span> on what is called <span>episodic</span> <span>memory<br/></span>
🎧 and what can <span>happen</span> if this is not working <span>properly</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Episodic</span> <span>memory</span> <span>refers</span> to the <span>memory</span> of an <span>event</span> or <span>'episode'</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Episodic</span> <span>memories</span> <span>allow</span> us to <span>mentally</span> travel back in time to an <span>event</span> from the <span>past</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Episodic</span> <span>memories</span> <span>include</span> <span>various</span> <span>details</span> about these <span>events</span>,<br/>
🎧 for example, when an <span>event</span> <span>happened<br/></span>
🎧 and other <span>information</span> such as the <span>location</span>.<br/>
🎧 To help <span>understand</span> this <span>concept</span>,<br/>
🎧 try to remember the last time you <span>ate</span> dinner at a <span>restaurant</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>ability</span> to remember where you <span>ate</span>,<br/>
🎧 who you were with and the <span>items</span> you <span>ordered</span> are all <span>features</span> of an <span>episodic</span> <span>memory</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Episodic</span> <span>memory</span> is <span>distinct</span> from another <span>type</span> of <span>memory</span> called <span>semantic</span> <span>memory</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is the <span>type</span> of <span>factual</span> <span>memory</span> that we have in <span>common</span> with everyone else <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 that is your <span>general</span> <span>knowledge</span> of the <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 To <span>build</span> <span>upon</span> a <span>previous</span> example,<br/>
🎧 <span>remembering</span> where you <span>parked</span> your car is an example of <span>episodic</span> <span>memory</span>,<br/>
🎧 but your <span>understanding</span> of what a car <span>is<br/></span>
🎧 and how an <span>engine</span> <span>works</span> are <span>examples</span> of <span>semantic</span> <span>memory</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Unlike</span> <span>episodic</span> <span>memory</span>, <span>semantic</span> <span>memory</span> isn't <span>dependent</span> on <span>recalling</span> personal <span>experiences</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Episodic</span> <span>memory</span> can be thought of as a <span>process</span> with <span>several</span> different <span>steps</span> of <span>memory</span> <span>processing</span>:<br/>
🎧 <span>encoding</span>, <span>consolidation</span> and <span>retrieval</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>initial</span> <span>step</span> is called <span>encoding</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>involves</span> the <span>process</span> of <span>receiving</span> and <span>registering</span> <span>information</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is <span>necessary</span> for <span>creating</span> <span>memories</span> of <span>information</span> or <span>events</span> that you <span>experience</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>degree</span> to which you can <span>successfully</span> <span>encode</span> <span>information<br/></span>
🎧 <span>depends</span> on the <span>level</span> of <span>attention</span> you give to an <span>event</span> while it's actually <span>happening</span>.<br/>
🎧 Being <span>distracted</span> can make <span>effective</span> <span>encoding</span> very <span>difficult</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Encoding</span> of <span>episodic</span> <span>memories</span> is also <span>influenced</span> by how you <span>process</span> the <span>event</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, if you were <span>introduced</span> to <span>someone</span> called <span>Charlie</span>,<br/>
🎧 you might make the <span>connection</span> that your <span>uncle</span> has the same name.<br/>
🎧 Future <span>recollection</span> of <span>Charlie's</span> name is much <span>easier<br/></span>
🎧 if you have a <span>strategy</span> to help you <span>encode</span> it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Memory</span> <span>consolidation</span>, the next <span>step</span> in <span>forming</span> an <span>episodic</span> <span>memory</span>,<br/>
🎧 is the <span>process</span> by which <span>memories</span> of <span>encoded</span> <span>information</span> are <span>strengthened</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>stabilised</span> and <span>stored</span> to <span>facilitate</span> later <span>retrieval</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Consolidation</span> is most <span>effective</span> when the <span>information</span> being <span>stored<br/></span>
🎧 can be <span>linked</span> to an <span>existing</span> <span>network</span> of <span>information</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Consolidation</span> makes it <span>possible</span> for you to <span>store</span> <span>memories</span> for later <span>retrieval</span> <span>indefinitely</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Forming</span> <span>strong</span> <span>memories</span> <span>depends</span> on the <span>frequency</span> with which you try to <span>retrieve</span> them.<br/>
🎧 <span>Memories</span> can <span>fade</span> or become <span>harder</span> to <span>retrieve</span> if they aren't used very often.<br/>
🎧 The last <span>step</span> in <span>forming</span> <span>episodic</span> <span>memories</span> is called <span>retrieval</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is the <span>conscious</span> <span>recollection</span> of <span>encoded</span> <span>information</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Retrieving</span> <span>information</span> from <span>episodic</span> <span>memory</span> <span>depends</span> <span>upon<br/></span>
🎧 <span>semantic</span>, <span>olfactory</span>, <span>auditory</span> and <span>visual</span> <span>factors</span>.<br/>
🎧 These help <span>episodic</span> <span>memory</span> <span>retrieval</span> by <span>acting</span> as a <span>prompt</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, when <span>recalling</span> where you <span>parked</span> your <span>car<br/></span>
🎧 you may use the <span>colour</span> of a <span>sign</span> <span>close</span> to where you <span>parked</span>.<br/>
🎧 You actually have to <span>mentally</span> travel back to the <span>moment</span> you <span>parked</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are a <span>wide</span> <span>range</span> of <span>neurological</span> <span>diseases<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>conditions</span> that can <span>affect</span> <span>episodic</span> <span>memory</span>.<br/>
🎧 These <span>range</span> from <span>Alzheimer's</span> to <span>schizophrenia</span> to <span>autism</span>.<br/>
🎧 An <span>impairment</span> of <span>episodic</span> <span>memory</span> can have a <span>profound</span> <span>effect</span> on <span>individuals'</span> lives.<br/>
🎧 For example, the <span>symptoms</span> of <span>schizophrenia</span> can be <span>reasonably</span> well <span>controlled</span> by <span>medication;<br/></span>
🎧 <span>however</span>, <span>patients'</span> <span>episodic</span> <span>memory</span> may still be <span>impaired<br/></span>
🎧 and so they are often <span>unable</span> to <span>return</span> to university or work.<br/>
🎧 <span>Recent</span> <span>studies</span> have <span>shown</span> that <span>computer-assisted</span> <span>games</span> <span>designed</span> to keep the <span>brain</span> <span>active<br/></span>
🎧 can help <span>improve</span> their <span>episodic</span> <span>memory</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Episodic</span> <span>memories</span> can help people <span>connect</span> with <span>others</span>,<br/>
🎧 for <span>instance</span> by <span>sharing</span> <span>intimate</span> <span>details</span> about their <span>past;<br/></span>
🎧 something <span>individuals</span> with <span>autism</span> often have <span>problems</span> with.<br/>
🎧 This may be <span>caused</span> by an <span>absence</span> of a <span>sense</span> of <span>self</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is <span>essential</span> for the <span>storage</span> of <span>episodic</span> <span>memory</span>,<br/>
🎧 and has been <span>found</span> to be <span>impaired</span> in children with <span>autism</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Research</span> has <span>shown</span> that <span>treatments</span> that <span>improve</span> <span>memory<br/></span>
🎧 may also have a <span>positive</span> <span>impact</span> on <span>children's</span> <span>social</span> <span>development</span>.<br/>
