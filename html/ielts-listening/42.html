🎧 Hello, South City Cycling Club.<br/>
🎧 Oh, hi.<br/>
🎧 I want to find out about joining the club.<br/>
🎧 Right. I can help you there.<br/>
🎧 I'm the club secretary and my name's Jim Hunter.<br/>
🎧 Oh, hi Jim.<br/>
🎧 So, are you interested in membership for yourself?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 OK. Well there are basically two types of adult membership.<br/>
🎧 If you're pretty serious about cycling, there's the Full membership.<br/>
🎧 That costs $260<br/>
🎧 and that covers you not just for ordinary cycling<br/>
🎧 but also for races both here in the city and also in other parts of Australia.<br/>
🎧 Right. Well, I'm not really up to that standard.<br/>
🎧 I was more interested in just joining a group to do some cycling in my free time.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 That's why most people join.<br/>
🎧 So, in that case you'd be better with the Recreational membership.<br/>
🎧 That's $108 if you're over 19, and $95 if you're under.<br/>
🎧 I'm 25.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 It's paid quarterly, and you can upgrade it later to the Full membership if you want to, of course.<br/>
🎧 Now both types of membership include the club fee of $20.<br/>
🎧 They also provide insurance in case you have an accident, though we hope you won't need that, of course.<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 OK, well, I'll go with the Recreational membership, I think.<br/>
🎧 And that allows me to join in the club activities, and so on?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 And once you're a member of the club, you're also permitted to wear our kit when you're out cycling.<br/>
🎧 It's green and white.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I've seen cyclists wearing it.<br/>
🎧 So, can I buy that at the club?<br/>
🎧 Ah.. no, it's made to order by a company in Brisbane.<br/>
🎧 You can find them online: they're called Jerriz.<br/>
🎧 That's J-E-R-R-I-Z.<br/>
🎧 You can use your membership number to put in an order on their website.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Now, can you tell me a bit about the rides I can do?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 So we have training rides pretty well every morning,<br/>
🎧 and they're a really good way of improving your cycling skills as well as your general level of fitness,<br/>
🎧 but they're different levels.<br/>
🎧 Level A is pretty fast - you're looking at about 30 or 35 kilometres an hour.<br/>
🎧 If you can do about 25 kilometres an hour, you'd probably be level B,<br/>
🎧 and then level C are the novices, who stay at about 15 kilometres per hour.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Well I reckon I'd be level B.<br/>
🎧 So, when are the sessions for that level?<br/>
🎧 Ah... there are a couple each week.<br/>
🎧 They're both early morning sessions.<br/>
🎧 There's one on Tuesdays, and for that one you meet at 5.30 am,<br/>
🎧 and the meeting point's the stadium.<br/>
🎧 Do you know where that is?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's quite near my home, in fact.<br/>
🎧 OK, and how about the other one?<br/>
🎧 That's on Thursdays.<br/>
🎧 It starts at the same time, but they meet at the main gate to the park.<br/>
🎧 Is that the one just past the shopping mall?<br/>
🎧 That's it.<br/>
🎧 So how long are the rides?<br/>
🎧 Ah.. they're about an hour and a half.<br/>
🎧 So, if you have a job it's easy to fit in before you go to work.<br/>
🎧 And the members often go somewhere for coffee afterwards, so it's quite a social event.<br/>
🎧 OK. That sounds good.<br/>
🎧 I've only just moved to the city so I don't actually know many people yet.<br/>
🎧 Well, it's a great way to meet people.<br/>
🎧 And does each ride have a leader?<br/>
🎧 Sometimes, but not always.<br/>
🎧 But you don't really need one; the group members on the ride support one another, anyway.<br/>
🎧 How would we know where to go?<br/>
🎧 If you check the club website, you'll see that the route for each ride is clearly marked.<br/>
🎧 So you can just print that out and take it along with you.<br/>
🎧 It's similar from one week to another, but it's not always exactly the same.<br/>
🎧 And what do I need to bring?<br/>
🎧 Well, bring a bottle of water, and your phone.<br/>
🎧 You shouldn't use it while you're cycling, but have it with you.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And in winter, it's well before sunrise when we set out,<br/>
🎧 so you need to make sure your bike's got lights.<br/>
🎧 That's OK.<br/>
🎧 Well, thanks Jim. I'd definitely like to join.<br/>
🎧 So what's the best way of going about it?<br/>
🎧 Ah.. you can…<br/><br />

🎧 Thanks for coming everyone.<br/>
🎧 OK, so this meeting is for new staff and staff who haven't been involved with our volunteering projects yet.<br/>
🎧 So basically, the idea is that we allow staff to give up some of their work time<br/>
🎧 to help on various charity projects to benefit the local community.<br/>
🎧 We've been doing this for the last five years and it's been very successful.<br/>
🎧 Participating doesn't necessarily involve a huge time commitment.<br/>
🎧 The company will pay for eight hours of your time.<br/>
🎧 That can be used over one or two days all at once,<br/>
🎧 or spread over several months throughout the year.<br/>
🎧 There are some staff who enjoy volunteering so much<br/>
🎧 they also give up their own free time for a couple of hours every week.<br/>
🎧 It's completely up to you.<br/>
🎧 Obviously, many people will have family commitments and aren't as available as other members of staff.<br/>
🎧 Feedback from staff has been overwhelmingly positive.<br/>
🎧 Because they felt they were doing something really useful,<br/>
🎧 nearly everyone agreed that volunteering made them feel more motivated at work.<br/>
🎧 They also liked building relationships with the people in the local community and felt valued by them.<br/>
🎧 One or two people also said it was a good thing to have on their CVs.<br/>
🎧 One particularly successful project last year was the Get Working Project.<br/>
🎧 This was aimed at helping unemployed people in the area get back to work.<br/>
🎧 Our staff were able to help them improve their telephone skills,<br/>
🎧 such as writing down messages and speaking with confidence to potential customers,<br/>
🎧 which they had found quite difficult.<br/>
🎧 This is something many employers look for in job applicants -<br/>
🎧 and something we all do without even thinking about, every day at work.<br/>
🎧 We've got an exciting new project starting this year.<br/>
🎧 Up until now, we've mainly focused on projects to do with education and training.<br/>
🎧 And we'll continue with our reading project in schools and our work with local charities.<br/>
🎧 But we've also agreed to help out on a conservation project in Redfern Park.<br/>
🎧 So if any of you fancy being outside and getting your hands dirty, this is the project for you.<br/>
🎧 I also want to mention the annual Digital Inclusion Day, which is coming up next month.<br/>
🎧 The aim of this is to help older people keep up with technology.<br/>
🎧 And this year, instead of hosting the event in our own training facility,<br/>
🎧 we're using the ICT suite at Hill College,<br/>
🎧 as it can hold far more people.<br/>
🎧 We've invited over 60 people from the Silver Age Community Centre to take part,<br/>
🎧 so we'll need a lot of volunteers to help with this event.<br/>
🎧 If you're interested in taking part,<br/>
🎧 please go to the volunteering section of our website and complete the relevant form.<br/>
🎧 We won't be providing any training for this<br/>
🎧 but you'll be paired with an experienced volunteer if you've never done it before.<br/>
🎧 By the way, don't forget to tell your manager about any volunteering activities you decide to do.<br/>
🎧 The participants on the Digital Inclusion Day really benefited.<br/>
🎧 The majority were in their seventies,<br/>
🎧 though some were younger and a few were even in their nineties!<br/>
🎧 Quite a few owned both a computer and a mobile phone,<br/>
🎧 but these tended to be outdated models.<br/>
🎧 They generally knew how to do simple things, like send texts,<br/>
🎧 but weren't aware of recent developments in mobile phone technology.<br/>
🎧 A few were keen to learn but most were quite dismissive at first -<br/>
🎧 they couldn't see the point of updating their skills.<br/>
🎧 But that soon changed.<br/>
🎧 The feedback was very positive.<br/>
🎧 The really encouraging thing was that participants all said<br/>
🎧 they felt much more confident about using social media to keep in touch with their grandchildren,<br/>
🎧 who prefer this form of communication to phoning or sending emails.<br/>
🎧 A lot of them also said playing online games would help them make new friends and keep their brains active.<br/>
🎧 They weren't that impressed with being able to order their groceries online,<br/>
🎧 as they liked going out to the shops,<br/>
🎧 but some said it would come in handy if they were ill or the weather was really bad.<br/>
🎧 One thing they asked about was using tablets for things like reading newspapers -<br/>
🎧 some people had been given tablets as presents but had never used them,<br/>
🎧 so that's something we'll make sure we include this time…<br/><br />

🎧 Ah… come in, Russ.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Now you wanted to consult me about your class presentation on nanotechnology -<br/>
🎧 you're due to give it in next week, aren't you?<br/>
🎧 That's right. And I'm really struggling.<br/>
🎧 I chose the topic because I didn't know much about it and wanted to learn more,<br/>
🎧 but now I've read so much about it, in a way there's too much to say -<br/>
🎧 I could talk for much longer than the twenty minutes I've been allocated.<br/>
🎧 Should I assume the other students don't know much, and give them a kind of general introduction,<br/>
🎧 or should I try and make them share my fascination with a particular aspect?<br/>
🎧 You could do either,<br/>
🎧 but you'll need to have it clear in your own mind.<br/>
🎧 Then I think I'll give an overview.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Now, one way of approaching this is to work through developments in chronological order.<br/>
🎧 On the other hand, you could talk about the numerous ways that nanotechnology is being applied.<br/>
🎧 You mean things like thin films on camera displays to make them water-repellent,<br/>
🎧 and additives to make motorcycle helmets stronger and lighter.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 Or another way would be to focus on its impact in one particular area,<br/>
🎧 say medicine, or space exploration.<br/>
🎧 That would make it easier to focus.<br/>
🎧 Perhaps I should do that.<br/>
🎧 I think that would be a good idea.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 How important is it to include slides in the presentation?<br/>
🎧 They aren't essential, by any means.<br/>
🎧 And there's a danger of tailoring what you say to fit whatever slides you can find.<br/>
🎧 While it can be good to include slides,<br/>
🎧 you could end up spending too long looking for suitable ones.<br/>
🎧 You might find it better to leave them out.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 Another thing I was wondering about was how to start.<br/>
🎧 I know presentations often begin with<br/>
🎧 'First I'm going to talk about this, and then I'll talk about that',<br/>
🎧 but I thought about asking the audience what they know about nanotechnology.<br/>
🎧 That would be fine if you had an hour or two for the presentation,<br/>
🎧 but you might find that you can't do anything with the answers you get,<br/>
🎧 and it simply eats into the short time that's available.<br/>
🎧 So, maybe I should mention a particular way that nanotechnology is used, to focus people's attention.<br/>
🎧 That sounds sensible.<br/>
🎧 What do you think I should do next?<br/>
🎧 I really have to plan the presentation today and tomorrow.<br/>
🎧 Well, initially I think you should ignore all the notes you've made,<br/>
🎧 take a small piece of paper, and write a single short sentence that ties together the whole presentation:<br/>
🎧 it can be something as simple as 'Nanotechnology is already improving our lives'.<br/>
🎧 Then start planning the content around that.<br/>
🎧 You can always modify that sentence later, if you need to.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 OK, now let's think about actually giving the presentation.<br/>
🎧 You've only given one before, if I remember correctly,<br/>
🎧 about an experiment you'd been involved in.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 It was pretty rubbish!<br/>
🎧 Let's say it was better in some respects than in others.<br/>
🎧 With regard to the structure.<br/>
🎧 I felt that you ended rather abruptly, without rounding it off.<br/>
🎧 Be careful not to do that in next week's presentation.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And you made very little eye contact with the audience,<br/>
🎧 because you were looking down at your notes most of the time.<br/>
🎧 You need to be looking at the audience and only occasionally glancing at your notes.<br/>
🎧 Your body language was a little odd.<br/>
🎧 Every time you showed a slide, you turned your back on the audience so you could look at it -<br/>
🎧 you should have been looking at your laptop.<br/>
🎧 And you kept scratching your head,<br/>
🎧 so I found myself wondering when you were next going to do that,<br/>
🎧 instead of listening to what you were saying!<br/>
🎧 Oh dear.<br/>
🎧 What did you think of the language?<br/>
🎧 I knew that not everyone was familiar with the subject,<br/>
🎧 so I tried to make it as simple as I could.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that came across.<br/>
🎧 You used a few words that are specific to the field,<br/>
🎧 but you always explained what they meant,<br/>
🎧 so the audience wouldn't have had any difficulty understanding.<br/>
🎧 I must say the handouts you prepared were well thought out.<br/>
🎧 They were a good summary of your presentation,<br/>
🎧 which people would have been able to refer to later on.<br/>
🎧 So well done on that.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Well, I hope that helps you with next week's presentation.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it will. Thanks a lot.<br/>
🎧 I'll look forward to seeing a big improvement, then.<br/><br />

🎧 Today, we'll be continuing the series of lectures on memory<br/>
🎧 by focusing on what is called episodic memory<br/>
🎧 and what can happen if this is not working properly.<br/>
🎧 Episodic memory refers to the memory of an event or 'episode'.<br/>
🎧 Episodic memories allow us to mentally travel back in time to an event from the past.<br/>
🎧 Episodic memories include various details about these events,<br/>
🎧 for example, when an event happened<br/>
🎧 and other information such as the location.<br/>
🎧 To help understand this concept,<br/>
🎧 try to remember the last time you ate dinner at a restaurant.<br/>
🎧 The ability to remember where you ate,<br/>
🎧 who you were with and the items you ordered are all features of an episodic memory.<br/>
🎧 Episodic memory is distinct from another type of memory called semantic memory.<br/>
🎧 This is the type of factual memory that we have in common with everyone else -<br/>
🎧 that is your general knowledge of the world.<br/>
🎧 To build upon a previous example,<br/>
🎧 remembering where you parked your car is an example of episodic memory,<br/>
🎧 but your understanding of what a car is<br/>
🎧 and how an engine works are examples of semantic memory.<br/>
🎧 Unlike episodic memory, semantic memory isn't dependent on recalling personal experiences.<br/>
🎧 Episodic memory can be thought of as a process with several different steps of memory processing:<br/>
🎧 encoding, consolidation and retrieval.<br/>
🎧 The initial step is called encoding.<br/>
🎧 This involves the process of receiving and registering information,<br/>
🎧 which is necessary for creating memories of information or events that you experience.<br/>
🎧 The degree to which you can successfully encode information<br/>
🎧 depends on the level of attention you give to an event while it's actually happening.<br/>
🎧 Being distracted can make effective encoding very difficult.<br/>
🎧 Encoding of episodic memories is also influenced by how you process the event.<br/>
🎧 For example, if you were introduced to someone called Charlie,<br/>
🎧 you might make the connection that your uncle has the same name.<br/>
🎧 Future recollection of Charlie's name is much easier<br/>
🎧 if you have a strategy to help you encode it.<br/>
🎧 Memory consolidation, the next step in forming an episodic memory,<br/>
🎧 is the process by which memories of encoded information are strengthened,<br/>
🎧 stabilised and stored to facilitate later retrieval.<br/>
🎧 Consolidation is most effective when the information being stored<br/>
🎧 can be linked to an existing network of information.<br/>
🎧 Consolidation makes it possible for you to store memories for later retrieval indefinitely.<br/>
🎧 Forming strong memories depends on the frequency with which you try to retrieve them.<br/>
🎧 Memories can fade or become harder to retrieve if they aren't used very often.<br/>
🎧 The last step in forming episodic memories is called retrieval,<br/>
🎧 which is the conscious recollection of encoded information.<br/>
🎧 Retrieving information from episodic memory depends upon<br/>
🎧 semantic, olfactory, auditory and visual factors.<br/>
🎧 These help episodic memory retrieval by acting as a prompt.<br/>
🎧 For example, when recalling where you parked your car<br/>
🎧 you may use the colour of a sign close to where you parked.<br/>
🎧 You actually have to mentally travel back to the moment you parked.<br/>
🎧 There are a wide range of neurological diseases<br/>
🎧 and conditions that can affect episodic memory.<br/>
🎧 These range from Alzheimer's to schizophrenia to autism.<br/>
🎧 An impairment of episodic memory can have a profound effect on individuals' lives.<br/>
🎧 For example, the symptoms of schizophrenia can be reasonably well controlled by medication;<br/>
🎧 however, patients' episodic memory may still be impaired<br/>
🎧 and so they are often unable to return to university or work.<br/>
🎧 Recent studies have shown that computer-assisted games designed to keep the brain active<br/>
🎧 can help improve their episodic memory.<br/>
🎧 Episodic memories can help people connect with others,<br/>
🎧 for instance by sharing intimate details about their past;<br/>
🎧 something individuals with autism often have problems with.<br/>
🎧 This may be caused by an absence of a sense of self.<br/>
🎧 This is essential for the storage of episodic memory,<br/>
🎧 and has been found to be impaired in children with autism.<br/>
🎧 Research has shown that treatments that improve memory<br/>
🎧 may also have a positive impact on children's social development.<br/>
🎧 One study...<br/>
<br/><br/>
