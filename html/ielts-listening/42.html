🎧 Hello, <span>South <span>City <span>Cycling <span>Club.<br/>
🎧 Oh, hi.<br/>
🎧 I want to find out about <span>joining the <span>club.<br/>
🎧 Right. I can help you there.<br/>
🎧 I'm the <span>club <span>secretary and my <span>name's <span>Jim <span>Hunter.<br/>
🎧 Oh, hi <span>Jim.<br/>
🎧 So, are you interested in <span>membership for yourself?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 OK. Well there are <span>basically two <span>types of <span>adult <span>membership.<br/>
🎧 If you're <span>pretty serious about <span>cycling, there's the Full <span>membership.<br/>
🎧 That <span>costs <span>$260<br/>
🎧 and that <span>covers you not just for <span>ordinary <span>cycling<br/>
🎧 but also for <span>races both here in the <span>city and also in other <span>parts of <span>Australia.<br/>
🎧 Right. Well, I'm not really up to that <span>standard.<br/>
🎧 I was more interested in just <span>joining a group to do some <span>cycling in my free time.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 That's why most people join.<br/>
🎧 So, in that case you'd be better with the <span>Recreational <span>membership.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>$108 if you're over <span>19, and <span>$95 if you're under.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>25.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>paid <span>quarterly, and you can <span>upgrade it later to the Full <span>membership if you want to, of course.<br/>
🎧 Now both <span>types of <span>membership <span>include the <span>club <span>fee of <span>$20.<br/>
🎧 They also <span>provide <span>insurance in case you have an <span>accident, though we hope you won't need that, of course.<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 OK, well, I'll go with the <span>Recreational <span>membership, I think.<br/>
🎧 And that <span>allows me to join in the <span>club <span>activities, and so on?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 And once you're a <span>member of the <span>club, you're also <span>permitted to <span>wear our <span>kit when you're out <span>cycling.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>green and <span>white.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I've <span>seen <span>cyclists <span>wearing it.<br/>
🎧 So, can I buy that at the <span>club?<br/>
🎧 <span>Ah.. no, it's made to order by a company in <span>Brisbane.<br/>
🎧 You can find them online: they're called <span>Jerriz.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>J-E-R-R-I-Z.<br/>
🎧 You can use your <span>membership number to put in an order on their <span>website.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Now, can you tell me a bit about the <span>rides I can do?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 So we have <span>training <span>rides <span>pretty well every morning,<br/>
🎧 and they're a really good way of <span>improving your <span>cycling <span>skills as well as your <span>general <span>level of <span>fitness,<br/>
🎧 but they're different <span>levels.<br/>
🎧 <span>Level A is <span>pretty <span>fast <span>- you're looking at about <span>30 or <span>35 <span>kilometres an <span>hour.<br/>
🎧 If you can do about <span>25 <span>kilometres an <span>hour, you'd probably be <span>level <span>B,<br/>
🎧 and then <span>level <span>C are the <span>novices, who <span>stay at about <span>15 <span>kilometres <span>per <span>hour.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Well I <span>reckon I'd be <span>level <span>B.<br/>
🎧 So, when are the <span>sessions for that <span>level?<br/>
🎧 <span>Ah... there are a <span>couple each week.<br/>
🎧 They're both <span>early morning <span>sessions.<br/>
🎧 There's one on <span>Tuesdays, and for that one you meet at <span>5.30 am,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>meeting <span>point's the <span>stadium.<br/>
🎧 Do you know where that is?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's quite near my home, in <span>fact.<br/>
🎧 OK, and how about the other one?<br/>
🎧 That's on <span>Thursdays.<br/>
🎧 It <span>starts at the same time, but they meet at the <span>main <span>gate to the <span>park.<br/>
🎧 Is that the one just <span>past the <span>shopping <span>mall?<br/>
🎧 That's it.<br/>
🎧 So how long are the <span>rides?<br/>
🎧 <span>Ah.. they're about an <span>hour and a <span>half.<br/>
🎧 So, if you have a <span>job it's easy to fit in before you go to work.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>members often go somewhere for <span>coffee <span>afterwards, so it's quite a <span>social <span>event.<br/>
🎧 OK. That sounds good.<br/>
🎧 I've only just <span>moved to the <span>city so I don't actually know many people yet.<br/>
🎧 Well, it's a great way to meet people.<br/>
🎧 And does each <span>ride have a <span>leader?<br/>
🎧 Sometimes, but not always.<br/>
🎧 But you don't really need <span>one; the group <span>members on the <span>ride <span>support one another, <span>anyway.<br/>
🎧 How would we know where to go?<br/>
🎧 If you check the <span>club <span>website, you'll see that the <span>route for each <span>ride is <span>clearly <span>marked.<br/>
🎧 So you can just <span>print that out and take it along with you.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>similar from one week to another, but it's not always exactly the same.<br/>
🎧 And what do I need to <span>bring?<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>bring a <span>bottle of water, and your phone.<br/>
🎧 You shouldn't use it while you're <span>cycling, but have it with you.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And in <span>winter, it's well before <span>sunrise when we set out,<br/>
🎧 so you need to make sure your <span>bike's got <span>lights.<br/>
🎧 That's OK.<br/>
🎧 Well, thanks <span>Jim. I'd definitely like to join.<br/>
🎧 So what's the best way of going about it?<br/>
🎧 <span>Ah.. you <span>can…<br/><br />

🎧 Thanks for <span>coming everyone.<br/>
🎧 OK, so this <span>meeting is for new <span>staff and <span>staff who haven't been <span>involved with our <span>volunteering <span>projects yet.<br/>
🎧 So <span>basically, the idea is that we <span>allow <span>staff to give up some of their work <span>time<br/>
🎧 to help on <span>various <span>charity <span>projects to <span>benefit the <span>local <span>community.<br/>
🎧 We've been doing this for the last <span>five years and it's been very <span>successful.<br/>
🎧 <span>Participating doesn't <span>necessarily <span>involve a <span>huge time <span>commitment.<br/>
🎧 The company will pay for <span>eight hours of your time.<br/>
🎧 That can be used over one or two <span>days all at once,<br/>
🎧 or <span>spread over <span>several <span>months <span>throughout the year.<br/>
🎧 There are some <span>staff who enjoy <span>volunteering so <span>much<br/>
🎧 they also give up their own free time for a <span>couple of hours every week.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>completely up to you.<br/>
🎧 <span>Obviously, many people will have <span>family <span>commitments and aren't as <span>available as other <span>members of <span>staff.<br/>
🎧 <span>Feedback from <span>staff has been <span>overwhelmingly <span>positive.<br/>
🎧 Because they <span>felt they were doing something really <span>useful,<br/>
🎧 <span>nearly everyone agreed that <span>volunteering made them feel more <span>motivated at work.<br/>
🎧 They also <span>liked <span>building <span>relationships with the people in the <span>local <span>community and <span>felt <span>valued by them.<br/>
🎧 One or two people also said it was a good thing to have on their <span>CVs.<br/>
🎧 One <span>particularly <span>successful <span>project last year was the Get Working <span>Project.<br/>
🎧 This was <span>aimed at <span>helping <span>unemployed people in the <span>area get back to work.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>staff were able to help them <span>improve their <span>telephone <span>skills,<br/>
🎧 such as <span>writing down <span>messages and <span>speaking with <span>confidence to <span>potential <span>customers,<br/>
🎧 which they had <span>found quite <span>difficult.<br/>
🎧 This is something many <span>employers look for in <span>job <span>applicants <span>-<br/>
🎧 and something we all do without even thinking about, every day at work.<br/>
🎧 We've got an <span>exciting new <span>project <span>starting this year.<br/>
🎧 Up until now, we've <span>mainly <span>focused on <span>projects to do with <span>education and <span>training.<br/>
🎧 And we'll <span>continue with our <span>reading <span>project in <span>schools and our work with <span>local <span>charities.<br/>
🎧 But we've also agreed to help out on a <span>conservation <span>project in <span>Redfern <span>Park.<br/>
🎧 So if any of you <span>fancy being outside and getting your <span>hands <span>dirty, this is the <span>project for you.<br/>
🎧 I also want to <span>mention the <span>annual <span>Digital <span>Inclusion Day, which is <span>coming up next month.<br/>
🎧 The <span>aim of this is to help <span>older people keep up with <span>technology.<br/>
🎧 And this year, <span>instead of <span>hosting the <span>event in our own <span>training <span>facility,<br/>
🎧 we're <span>using the <span>ICT <span>suite at <span>Hill <span>College,<br/>
🎧 as it can <span>hold <span>far more people.<br/>
🎧 We've <span>invited over <span>60 people from the <span>Silver Age <span>Community <span>Centre to take <span>part,<br/>
🎧 so we'll need a lot of <span>volunteers to help with this <span>event.<br/>
🎧 If you're interested in taking <span>part,<br/>
🎧 please go to the <span>volunteering <span>section of our <span>website and <span>complete the <span>relevant <span>form.<br/>
🎧 We won't be <span>providing any <span>training for <span>this<br/>
🎧 but you'll be <span>paired with an <span>experienced <span>volunteer if you've never done it before.<br/>
🎧 By the way, don't <span>forget to tell your <span>manager about any <span>volunteering <span>activities you decide to do.<br/>
🎧 The <span>participants on the <span>Digital <span>Inclusion Day really <span>benefited.<br/>
🎧 The <span>majority were in their <span>seventies,<br/>
🎧 though some were <span>younger and a few were even in their <span>nineties!<br/>
🎧 Quite a few <span>owned both a <span>computer and a <span>mobile phone,<br/>
🎧 but these <span>tended to be <span>outdated <span>models.<br/>
🎧 They <span>generally <span>knew how to do simple things, like <span>send <span>texts,<br/>
🎧 but weren't <span>aware of <span>recent <span>developments in <span>mobile phone <span>technology.<br/>
🎧 A few were <span>keen to learn but most were quite <span>dismissive at first <span>-<br/>
🎧 they couldn't see the <span>point of <span>updating their <span>skills.<br/>
🎧 But that soon <span>changed.<br/>
🎧 The <span>feedback was very <span>positive.<br/>
🎧 The really <span>encouraging thing was that <span>participants all <span>said<br/>
🎧 they <span>felt much more <span>confident about <span>using <span>social <span>media to keep in touch with their <span>grandchildren,<br/>
🎧 who <span>prefer this <span>form of <span>communication to <span>phoning or <span>sending <span>emails.<br/>
🎧 A lot of them also said playing online <span>games would help them make new friends and keep their <span>brains <span>active.<br/>
🎧 They weren't that <span>impressed with being able to order their <span>groceries online,<br/>
🎧 as they <span>liked going out to the <span>shops,<br/>
🎧 but some said it would come in <span>handy if they were <span>ill or the <span>weather was really bad.<br/>
🎧 One thing they <span>asked about was <span>using <span>tablets for things like <span>reading <span>newspapers <span>-<br/>
🎧 some people had been <span>given <span>tablets as <span>presents but had never used them,<br/>
🎧 so that's something we'll make sure we <span>include this <span>time…<br/><br />

🎧 <span>Ah… come in, <span>Russ.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Now you wanted to <span>consult me about your class <span>presentation on <span>nanotechnology <span>-<br/>
🎧 you're <span>due to give it in next week, aren't you?<br/>
🎧 That's right. And I'm really <span>struggling.<br/>
🎧 I <span>chose the <span>topic because I didn't know much about it and wanted to learn more,<br/>
🎧 but now I've read so much about it, in a way there's too much to say <span>-<br/>
🎧 I could talk for much <span>longer than the <span>twenty <span>minutes I've been <span>allocated.<br/>
🎧 Should I <span>assume the other students don't know much, and give them a kind of <span>general <span>introduction,<br/>
🎧 or should I try and make them share my <span>fascination with a <span>particular <span>aspect?<br/>
🎧 You could do either,<br/>
🎧 but you'll need to have it <span>clear in your own <span>mind.<br/>
🎧 Then I think I'll give an <span>overview.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Now, one way of <span>approaching this is to work through <span>developments in <span>chronological order.<br/>
🎧 On the other <span>hand, you could talk about the <span>numerous <span>ways that <span>nanotechnology is being <span>applied.<br/>
🎧 You mean things like <span>thin <span>films on <span>camera <span>displays to make them <span>water-repellent,<br/>
🎧 and <span>additives to make <span>motorcycle <span>helmets <span>stronger and <span>lighter.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 Or another way would be to focus on its <span>impact in one <span>particular <span>area,<br/>
🎧 say <span>medicine, or <span>space <span>exploration.<br/>
🎧 That would make it <span>easier to focus.<br/>
🎧 <span>Perhaps I should do that.<br/>
🎧 I think that would be a good idea.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 How important is it to <span>include <span>slides in the <span>presentation?<br/>
🎧 They aren't <span>essential, by any <span>means.<br/>
🎧 And there's a <span>danger of <span>tailoring what you say to fit whatever <span>slides you can find.<br/>
🎧 While it can be good to <span>include <span>slides,<br/>
🎧 you could end up spending too long looking for <span>suitable <span>ones.<br/>
🎧 You might find it better to leave them out.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 Another thing I was <span>wondering about was how to start.<br/>
🎧 I know <span>presentations often <span>begin <span>with<br/>
🎧 <span>'First I'm going to talk about this, and then I'll talk about <span>that',<br/>
🎧 but I thought about <span>asking the <span>audience what they know about <span>nanotechnology.<br/>
🎧 That would be fine if you had an <span>hour or two for the <span>presentation,<br/>
🎧 but you might find that you can't do anything with the <span>answers you get,<br/>
🎧 and it <span>simply <span>eats into the short time that's <span>available.<br/>
🎧 So, maybe I should <span>mention a <span>particular way that <span>nanotechnology is used, to focus <span>people's <span>attention.<br/>
🎧 That sounds <span>sensible.<br/>
🎧 What do you think I should do next?<br/>
🎧 I really have to plan the <span>presentation today and <span>tomorrow.<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>initially I think you should <span>ignore all the <span>notes you've made,<br/>
🎧 take a small <span>piece of <span>paper, and <span>write a <span>single short <span>sentence that <span>ties together the whole <span>presentation:<br/>
🎧 it can be something as simple as <span>'Nanotechnology is already <span>improving our <span>lives'.<br/>
🎧 Then start planning the <span>content around that.<br/>
🎧 You can always <span>modify that <span>sentence later, if you need to.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 OK, now let's think about actually <span>giving the <span>presentation.<br/>
🎧 You've only <span>given one before, if I remember <span>correctly,<br/>
🎧 about an <span>experiment you'd been <span>involved in.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>pretty <span>rubbish!<br/>
🎧 Let's say it was better in some <span>respects than in <span>others.<br/>
🎧 With <span>regard to the <span>structure.<br/>
🎧 I <span>felt that you <span>ended rather <span>abruptly, without <span>rounding it off.<br/>
🎧 Be <span>careful not to do that in next <span>week's <span>presentation.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And you made very little eye <span>contact with the <span>audience,<br/>
🎧 because you were looking down at your <span>notes most of the time.<br/>
🎧 You need to be looking at the <span>audience and only <span>occasionally <span>glancing at your <span>notes.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>body <span>language was a little <span>odd.<br/>
🎧 Every time you <span>showed a <span>slide, you <span>turned your back on the <span>audience so you could look at it <span>-<br/>
🎧 you should have been looking at your <span>laptop.<br/>
🎧 And you <span>kept <span>scratching your <span>head,<br/>
🎧 so I <span>found myself <span>wondering when you were next going to do that,<br/>
🎧 <span>instead of <span>listening to what you were saying!<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>dear.<br/>
🎧 What did you think of the <span>language?<br/>
🎧 I <span>knew that not everyone was <span>familiar with the <span>subject,<br/>
🎧 so I <span>tried to make it as simple as I could.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that came across.<br/>
🎧 You used a few <span>words that are <span>specific to the <span>field,<br/>
🎧 but you always <span>explained what they <span>meant,<br/>
🎧 so the <span>audience wouldn't have had any <span>difficulty <span>understanding.<br/>
🎧 I must say the <span>handouts you <span>prepared were well thought out.<br/>
🎧 They were a good <span>summary of your <span>presentation,<br/>
🎧 which people would have been able to <span>refer to later on.<br/>
🎧 So well done on that.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Well, I hope that helps you with next <span>week's <span>presentation.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it will. Thanks a lot.<br/>
🎧 I'll look forward to <span>seeing a big <span>improvement, then.<br/><br />

🎧 Today, we'll be <span>continuing the <span>series of <span>lectures on <span>memory<br/>
🎧 by <span>focusing on what is called <span>episodic <span>memory<br/>
🎧 and what can <span>happen if this is not working <span>properly.<br/>
🎧 <span>Episodic <span>memory <span>refers to the <span>memory of an <span>event or <span>'episode'.<br/>
🎧 <span>Episodic <span>memories <span>allow us to <span>mentally travel back in time to an <span>event from the <span>past.<br/>
🎧 <span>Episodic <span>memories <span>include <span>various <span>details about these <span>events,<br/>
🎧 for example, when an <span>event <span>happened<br/>
🎧 and other <span>information such as the <span>location.<br/>
🎧 To help <span>understand this <span>concept,<br/>
🎧 try to remember the last time you <span>ate dinner at a <span>restaurant.<br/>
🎧 The <span>ability to remember where you <span>ate,<br/>
🎧 who you were with and the <span>items you <span>ordered are all <span>features of an <span>episodic <span>memory.<br/>
🎧 <span>Episodic <span>memory is <span>distinct from another <span>type of <span>memory called <span>semantic <span>memory.<br/>
🎧 This is the <span>type of <span>factual <span>memory that we have in <span>common with everyone else <span>-<br/>
🎧 that is your <span>general <span>knowledge of the <span>world.<br/>
🎧 To <span>build <span>upon a <span>previous example,<br/>
🎧 <span>remembering where you <span>parked your car is an example of <span>episodic <span>memory,<br/>
🎧 but your <span>understanding of what a car <span>is<br/>
🎧 and how an <span>engine <span>works are <span>examples of <span>semantic <span>memory.<br/>
🎧 <span>Unlike <span>episodic <span>memory, <span>semantic <span>memory isn't <span>dependent on <span>recalling personal <span>experiences.<br/>
🎧 <span>Episodic <span>memory can be thought of as a <span>process with <span>several different <span>steps of <span>memory <span>processing:<br/>
🎧 <span>encoding, <span>consolidation and <span>retrieval.<br/>
🎧 The <span>initial <span>step is called <span>encoding.<br/>
🎧 This <span>involves the <span>process of <span>receiving and <span>registering <span>information,<br/>
🎧 which is <span>necessary for <span>creating <span>memories of <span>information or <span>events that you <span>experience.<br/>
🎧 The <span>degree to which you can <span>successfully <span>encode <span>information<br/>
🎧 <span>depends on the <span>level of <span>attention you give to an <span>event while it's actually <span>happening.<br/>
🎧 Being <span>distracted can make <span>effective <span>encoding very <span>difficult.<br/>
🎧 <span>Encoding of <span>episodic <span>memories is also <span>influenced by how you <span>process the <span>event.<br/>
🎧 For example, if you were <span>introduced to <span>someone called <span>Charlie,<br/>
🎧 you might make the <span>connection that your <span>uncle has the same name.<br/>
🎧 Future <span>recollection of <span>Charlie's name is much <span>easier<br/>
🎧 if you have a <span>strategy to help you <span>encode it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Memory <span>consolidation, the next <span>step in <span>forming an <span>episodic <span>memory,<br/>
🎧 is the <span>process by which <span>memories of <span>encoded <span>information are <span>strengthened,<br/>
🎧 <span>stabilised and <span>stored to <span>facilitate later <span>retrieval.<br/>
🎧 <span>Consolidation is most <span>effective when the <span>information being <span>stored<br/>
🎧 can be <span>linked to an <span>existing <span>network of <span>information.<br/>
🎧 <span>Consolidation makes it <span>possible for you to <span>store <span>memories for later <span>retrieval <span>indefinitely.<br/>
🎧 <span>Forming <span>strong <span>memories <span>depends on the <span>frequency with which you try to <span>retrieve them.<br/>
🎧 <span>Memories can <span>fade or become <span>harder to <span>retrieve if they aren't used very often.<br/>
🎧 The last <span>step in <span>forming <span>episodic <span>memories is called <span>retrieval,<br/>
🎧 which is the <span>conscious <span>recollection of <span>encoded <span>information.<br/>
🎧 <span>Retrieving <span>information from <span>episodic <span>memory <span>depends <span>upon<br/>
🎧 <span>semantic, <span>olfactory, <span>auditory and <span>visual <span>factors.<br/>
🎧 These help <span>episodic <span>memory <span>retrieval by <span>acting as a <span>prompt.<br/>
🎧 For example, when <span>recalling where you <span>parked your <span>car<br/>
🎧 you may use the <span>colour of a <span>sign <span>close to where you <span>parked.<br/>
🎧 You actually have to <span>mentally travel back to the <span>moment you <span>parked.<br/>
🎧 There are a <span>wide <span>range of <span>neurological <span>diseases<br/>
🎧 and <span>conditions that can <span>affect <span>episodic <span>memory.<br/>
🎧 These <span>range from <span>Alzheimer's to <span>schizophrenia to <span>autism.<br/>
🎧 An <span>impairment of <span>episodic <span>memory can have a <span>profound <span>effect on <span>individuals' lives.<br/>
🎧 For example, the <span>symptoms of <span>schizophrenia can be <span>reasonably well <span>controlled by <span>medication;<br/>
🎧 <span>however, <span>patients' <span>episodic <span>memory may still be <span>impaired<br/>
🎧 and so they are often <span>unable to <span>return to university or work.<br/>
🎧 <span>Recent <span>studies have <span>shown that <span>computer-assisted <span>games <span>designed to keep the <span>brain <span>active<br/>
🎧 can help <span>improve their <span>episodic <span>memory.<br/>
🎧 <span>Episodic <span>memories can help people <span>connect with <span>others,<br/>
🎧 for <span>instance by <span>sharing <span>intimate <span>details about their <span>past;<br/>
🎧 something <span>individuals with <span>autism often have <span>problems with.<br/>
🎧 This may be <span>caused by an <span>absence of a <span>sense of <span>self.<br/>
🎧 This is <span>essential for the <span>storage of <span>episodic <span>memory,<br/>
🎧 and has been <span>found to be <span>impaired in children with <span>autism.<br/>
🎧 <span>Research has <span>shown that <span>treatments that <span>improve <span>memory<br/>
🎧 may also have a <span>positive <span>impact on <span>children's <span>social <span>development.<br/>
