🎧 Good morning. I'd like to open a <span>bank</span> <span>account</span>, please.<br/>
🎧 <span>Certainly</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you'd like to take a <span>seat</span>, I'll just get some <span>details</span> from you.<br/>
🎧 It won't take long.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Is it a <span>current</span> <span>account</span> or a <span>deposit</span> <span>account</span> you wanted?<br/>
🎧 A <span>current</span> <span>account</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I've got the <span>application</span> <span>form</span> here then.<br/>
🎧 We have different <span>types</span> <span>-</span> I see you've got our <span>leaflet</span> there.<br/>
🎧 I've <span>decided</span> on the one called <span>'Select.'<br/></span>
🎧 Right, that's fine, so, first of all, can I have your full name please?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's <span>Pieter</span> <span>Henes</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>PIETER</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is it <span>HENNES</span>?<br/>
🎧 Uh, only one <span>N</span> actually. It's a less <span>common</span> <span>spelling</span> of the name.<br/>
🎧 Oh, right. Okay.<br/>
🎧 And what's your date of <span>birth</span> please?<br/>
🎧 The <span>27th</span> of the first, <span>1973</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And will this be a <span>joint</span> <span>account</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, just myself.<br/>
🎧 Okay, fine.<br/>
🎧 And where are you living, Mr <span>Henes</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>15</span>, <span>Riverside</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is that all one <span>word</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 <span>Exeter</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 How long have you been at your <span>present</span> <span>address</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Er</span>, is it more than two years?<br/>
🎧 Ah, just two <span>weeks</span> actually.<br/>
🎧 I only <span>arrived</span> in the <span>country</span> a month ago.<br/>
🎧 I'm from <span>Holland</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's fine.<br/>
🎧 But we <span>normally</span> ask for a <span>previous</span> <span>address</span> in that case.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, well, it's <span>Rielsdorf</span> <span>2</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>RIELSDORF</span> <span>2</span>, <span>Utrecht</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Holland</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay. Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Do you have a <span>daytime</span> <span>telephone</span> number?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I think the number at my <span>office</span> is <span>606295</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Um</span>, just a <span>minute</span>, I'd better check.<br/>
🎧 Oh, no, sorry, <span>616</span>. I'm not used to it yet.<br/>
🎧 Would you like my home number too?<br/>
🎧 Yes please.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>796431</span>.<br/>
🎧 Are they both <span>local</span> <span>numbers</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 <span>﻿Right</span>. And your <span>occupation</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm in <span>Britain</span> as a <span>project</span> <span>manager</span>, but that's not my <span>main</span> <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm an <span>engineer</span> by <span>profession</span>.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 I think I'll put that then. It's <span>shorter</span>!<br/>
🎧 Now, we usually ask for a <span>piece</span> of <span>information</span> which we can use to check your <span>identity</span>, for <span>security</span> <span>reasons</span>.<br/>
🎧 You know, if you phone us.<br/>
🎧 Like, <span>erm</span>, my <span>wife's</span> first name?<br/>
🎧 <span>Mother's</span> might be better. It's less <span>likely</span> to be <span>known</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay. <span>Hers</span> is <span>Siti</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Siti</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, <span>SITI</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>Indonesian</span>.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 And how much would you like to open your <span>account</span> with?<br/>
🎧 We usually ask for a <span>minimum</span> <span>sum</span> of <span>£50</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's about <span>€75</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm going to <span>transfer</span> <span>€2,000</span> from my <span>Dutch</span> <span>account</span>, just <span>till</span> I get <span>paid</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, I wanted to ask you about that.<br/>
🎧 What's the best way to do it?<br/>
🎧 It <span>depends</span> which <span>bank</span> you're with.<br/>
🎧 It's the <span>Fransen</span> <span>Bank</span> in <span>Utrecht</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, fine. I'll check that in a <span>minute</span>.<br/>
🎧 If we have <span>links</span> with them we can do a <span>direct</span> <span>transfer</span>. But it's not a big <span>problem</span> either way.<br/>
🎧 <span>Um</span>, let's see.<br/>
🎧 How often would you like to <span>receive</span> <span>statements</span>?<br/>
🎧 I haven't really thought.<br/>
🎧 What's the <span>usual</span> thing?<br/>
🎧 It's up to you. Some people like them <span>weekly</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, no, that's too often.<br/>
🎧 Can I have them <span>sent</span>, <span>um</span>, once a month?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's fine.<br/>
🎧 Is there anything else?<br/>
🎧 I was thinking of <span>registering</span> for your <span>internet</span> <span>service</span> at some <span>stage</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes.<br/>
🎧 Would you like me to <span>send</span> you <span>information</span> about that?<br/>
🎧 Please, yes.<br/>
🎧 And would you like to <span>receive</span> <span>information</span> about the <span>bank's</span> other <span>services</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>insurance</span>, <span>loans</span>, anything like that?<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, I don't think so, thanks.<br/>
🎧 That's okay then.<br/>
🎧 And one last thing, if you <span>agree..</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 <span>Welcome</span>, <span>everybody</span>, to the <span>lovely</span> house and <span>gardens</span> of <span>Rosewood</span>,<br/>
🎧 once the home of the famous <span>writer</span>, <span>Sebastian</span> <span>George</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>bought</span> the house in <span>1902<br/></span>
🎧 although he had first <span>seen</span> it two years <span>earlier</span>.<br/>
🎧 At that time, the <span>owners</span> let it out to a <span>tenant<br/></span>
🎧 because <span>George</span> was too <span>slow</span> <span>making</span> up his <span>mind</span> to buy it.<br/>
🎧 When it came back on the <span>market</span>, there was no <span>hesitation<br/></span>
🎧 and he <span>bought</span> it <span>immediately</span>, for <span>£9,300</span>,<br/>
🎧 even though the house had no <span>bathroom</span>, no <span>running</span> water <span>upstairs</span>, and no <span>electricity</span>.<br/>
🎧 When he came here, he'd been <span>married</span> for ten years.<br/>
🎧 During that time, he'd become one of the most famous <span>writers</span> in the <span>English-speaking</span> <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 His <span>professional</span> success was <span>enormous</span>,<br/>
🎧 but his personal life wasn't as <span>successful</span>.<br/>
🎧 He was no <span>longer</span> on <span>speaking</span> <span>terms</span> with his <span>brother<br/></span>
🎧 and had been <span>devastated</span> by the <span>death</span> at the age of <span>seven</span> of his <span>elder</span> <span>daughter</span>, <span>Josephine</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Moving</span> to <span>Rosewood</span> <span>allowed</span> the <span>family</span> to start a new life.<br/>
🎧 <span>George</span> <span>regarded</span> <span>Rosewood</span> as a <span>pure</span> example of a <span>traditional</span> <span>country</span> house of this <span>part</span> of <span>England<br/></span>
🎧 and did some of his most <span>successful</span> <span>writing</span> here.<br/>
🎧 The house and its <span>grounds</span> <span>became</span> the <span>family</span> <span>haven<br/></span>
🎧 and their <span>escape</span> to <span>privacy</span> and <span>quiet</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>walls</span>, and the <span>mullioned</span> <span>windows</span> were <span>built</span> of the <span>local</span> <span>sandstone</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>tiles</span> on the <span>roofs</span> and the <span>bricks</span> of the <span>chimney</span> <span>stack</span> were <span>baked</span> from <span>local</span> <span>clay</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>wooden</span> <span>structures</span> inside came from <span>oak</span> <span>trees</span> which <span>grow</span> around here.<br/>
🎧 Now, please look at the map I've <span>given</span> you of the house and <span>gardens</span>.<br/>
🎧 We're here at the <span>Information</span> <span>Centre</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Follow</span> the <span>path</span> <span>marked</span> with the <span>arrow<br/></span>
🎧 and the first <span>area</span> you come to is the <span>orchard</span> on your <span>left</span>.<br/>
🎧 As you go <span>further</span> down the <span>path</span>, there's the <span>kitchen</span> garden on the <span>right<br/></span>
🎧 and as you go <span>round</span> the first <span>sharp</span> <span>corner<br/></span>
🎧 you will find, to your <span>left</span>, an <span>area</span> where different <span>types</span> of <span>pear</span> <span>tree</span> have been <span>planted<br/></span>
🎧 as well as some <span>lovely</span> <span>flowers</span>,<br/>
🎧 and this is <span>known</span> as <span>Pear</span> <span>Alley</span> <span>-</span> <span>designed</span> by <span>George</span> <span>himself</span>.<br/>
🎧 Next to this is the <span>greenhouse<br/></span>
🎧 where some <span>exotic</span> <span>plants</span> and <span>fruits</span> are <span>grown</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Follow</span> the <span>path</span> <span>round</span> the second <span>corner<br/></span>
🎧 and on your right you will see the <span>entrance</span> to the <span>Mulberry</span> <span>Garden<br/></span>
🎧 with its <span>500-year-old</span> <span>tree</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Past</span> the <span>Mulberry</span> Garden, <span>follow</span> the <span>path</span> until you <span>reach</span> the <span>front</span> of the house.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suggest</span> you <span>spend</span> a good <span>hour</span> <span>wandering</span> around this <span>lovely</span> <span>building</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>guide</span> takes <span>visitor</span> <span>groups</span> <span>round</span> every two hours.<br/>
🎧 If you would like to <span>purchase</span> any of <span>George's</span> books or other <span>souvenirs</span>,<br/>
🎧 then leave the house by the side <span>entrance</span>,<br/>
🎧 where you will find our <span>shop</span>, which is <span>situated</span> between the house and the <span>garage<br/></span>
🎧 which <span>contains</span> the <span>magnificent</span> old <span>Rolls-Royce</span> <span>car<br/></span>
🎧 which used to <span>belong</span> to <span>George</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>expect</span> by this time you may also be in need of a <span>rest</span> and some <span>refreshment</span>.<br/>
🎧 Most <span>visitors</span> are, so why don't you visit the tea room on the <span>far</span> side of the <span>garage</span>?<br/>
🎧 If you have time, there is a <span>lovely</span> <span>walk</span> down <span>towards</span> the <span>River</span> <span>Dudwell</span>.<br/>
🎧 For me, this is the best <span>part</span> of the <span>estate</span>.<br/>
🎧 This isn't on the map but it is all <span>clearly</span> <span>signposted</span>.<br/>
🎧 You <span>cross</span> the <span>field</span> which <span>spreads</span> along the <span>banks</span> of the <span>river</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>spring</span>, this <span>area</span> is well <span>worth</span> a visit.<br/>
🎧 <span>Spend</span> a <span>minute</span> or two watching the water <span>pass</span> by <span>underneath</span> as you <span>cross</span> the <span>footbridge</span>,<br/>
🎧 and then <span>continue</span> along the <span>River</span> <span>Walk</span> through the <span>woodland</span>.<br/>
🎧 On a hot <span>summer's</span> day the <span>trees</span> along this <span>path</span> <span>provide</span> <span>welcome</span> <span>shade</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Eventually</span>, you come to the water <span>mill<br/></span>
🎧 which used to <span>provide</span> the <span>electricity</span> for the house <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 only about <span>four</span> hours every <span>evening</span> <span>-</span> in <span>George's</span> time.<br/>
🎧 And, finally, for those of you who would like to see <span>stunning</span> <span>views</span> of the <span>surrounding</span> <span>countryside<br/></span>
🎧 and who are a little bit more <span>energetic</span>,<br/>
🎧 when you <span>return</span> from the <span>mill</span>, take the first <span>turning</span> on your <span>left<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>climb</span> up to the <span>viewpoint</span>.<br/>
🎧 You won't <span>regret</span> it.<br/>
🎧 Enjoy your visit!<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 <span>Lucy</span>, we really need to get working on this <span>marketing</span> <span>assignment</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've only got <span>five</span> <span>weeks</span> <span>left</span> to the end of <span>term</span> to <span>design</span> it,<br/>
🎧 <span>carry</span> it out, and then <span>write</span> up the <span>results</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sure. Well, let's get <span>started</span> right now.<br/>
🎧 Let's go over the <span>instructions</span>.<br/>
🎧 What exactly do we have to do?<br/>
🎧 Well, it says here we have to look at one <span>area</span> of the <span>entertainment</span> <span>industry</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>list</span> of the different <span>types</span>.<br/>
🎧 What are they?<br/>
🎧 Music, <span>cinema</span>, <span>theatre</span>, <span>sport</span>, and <span>eating</span> out.<br/>
🎧 Is that all?<br/>
🎧 Looks like it.<br/>
🎧 So we choose one <span>branch</span> of the <span>industry<br/></span>
🎧 and then we look at how two different <span>groups</span> of people use it?<br/>
🎧 Is that right?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 And do we have to use any <span>particular</span> <span>method</span> to get our <span>data</span>?<br/>
🎧 Can we <span>mail</span> out a <span>questionnaire</span>, or do <span>face-to-face</span> <span>interviews</span>, or maybe even <span>observations</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well actually, it looks like we don't have a <span>choice</span>.<br/>
🎧 We have to do <span>telephone</span> <span>interviews</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, so at <span>least</span> we don't have to <span>waste</span> time <span>deciding</span> between the different <span>methods</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, that's right.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and the other <span>requirement</span> is the number of <span>interviewees</span>.<br/>
🎧 Not too many, I hope. Ten? <span>Twenty</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, we have to do two <span>groups</span>, remember,<br/>
🎧 and it looks like we have to <span>interview</span> <span>fifteen</span> for each group.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>thirty</span> <span>altogether</span> then.<br/>
🎧 It's going to take <span>ages</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but remember we're working on this together,<br/>
🎧 so we'll only have to do <span>fifteen</span> each.<br/>
🎧 Okay, so those are all the <span>requirements</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, looks like it.<br/>
🎧 So, first, which <span>area</span> are we going to choose?<br/>
🎧 My <span>preference</span> would be <span>cinema</span>, since that's where I <span>spend</span> most of my money.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, I don't think that's such a good idea.<br/>
🎧 I don't think there are <span>huge</span> <span>differences</span> in the <span>market</span> there.<br/>
🎧 I mean, you get young and old, <span>male</span> and <span>female</span>, <span>rich</span> and <span>poor..</span>.<br/>
🎧 all going to the same <span>movies</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, maybe you're right.<br/>
🎧 Let's make it music then.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So, what two <span>groups</span> will we <span>compare</span> and <span>contrast</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Male</span> and <span>female</span>?<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 Most of my <span>female</span> friends like the same music as me.<br/>
🎧 Different age <span>groups</span> would be much more <span>likely</span> to show up <span>differences</span>, I think.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I <span>suppose</span> you're right again.<br/>
🎧 I'll take some <span>notes</span>, shall I?<br/>
🎧 <span>So..</span>. Age <span>Groups</span>.<br/>
🎧 What do you think?<br/>
🎧 Maybe <span>25</span> or under for one group, and <span>45</span> or over for the other group?<br/>
🎧 That should show up <span>differences</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Okay. Next.<br/>
🎧 How about the kind of music they like? Let's give them some <span>choices</span> and then we can just <span>tick</span> <span>boxes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay. Let's have pop, <span>jazz</span>, <span>folk</span>, easy <span>listening..</span>.<br/>
🎧 What else?<br/>
🎧 Well, we should <span>include</span> <span>classical</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some people like it, you know.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 And then we should have how they listen to music.<br/>
🎧 The <span>medium</span>. Right. Let's <span>include</span> <span>radio</span>, <span>CD..</span>.<br/>
🎧 and then I <span>guess</span> there's <span>TV</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about <span>concerts</span>? You know, in <span>pubs</span> and <span>halls</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh yeah, we should <span>include</span> live music of course.<br/>
🎧 Okay, we're on a <span>roll</span> now!<br/>
🎧 Next <span>point</span> could be about where they actually get their music.<br/>
🎧 You mean like, do they buy it in music <span>shops</span>, or <span>department</span> <span>stores</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, or <span>download</span> it from the <span>Internet</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right. That could be for <span>recorded</span> music.<br/>
🎧 Then we need another <span>section</span> for live music.<br/>
🎧 Where do they go for that?<br/>
🎧 Okay. Let's say <span>disco</span>, pub, <span>club</span>, <span>concert</span> <span>hall..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Or <span>opera</span> house!<br/>
🎧 And I <span>guess</span> we should <span>include</span> <span>karaoke</span> <span>bars</span>.<br/>
🎧 Not many of them in this <span>city</span>!<br/>
🎧 Okay. We'll leave that out then.<br/>
🎧 So, what's <span>left</span> to do?<br/>
🎧 That's it.<br/>
🎧 Well, now we can make a <span>time-scale</span> for doing it.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Good morning everyone.<br/>
🎧 Last week we were looking at the <span>hunter-gatherers</span> in <span>Ireland</span>,<br/>
🎧 across the <span>Irish</span> Sea from <span>England</span>.<br/>
🎧 Today, we're going to move on to the <span>period</span> between <span>4</span> and <span>6000</span> years ago,<br/>
🎧 <span>known</span> as the <span>Neolithic</span> <span>period</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is when a <span>total</span> <span>farming</span> <span>economy</span> was <span>introduced</span> in <span>Ireland</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, there are <span>several</span> <span>hypotheses</span> about the <span>origins</span> of the first <span>Neolithic</span> <span>settlers</span> in <span>Ireland</span>,<br/>
🎧 but most of these <span>contain</span> <span>problems</span>.<br/>
🎧 For <span>instance</span>, there are <span>considerable</span> <span>archaeological</span> <span>difficulties</span> about the <span>theory</span> that they came from <span>England</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>evidence</span> doesn't really add up.<br/>
🎧 But there are even <span>greater</span> <span>practical</span> <span>problems</span> about the <span>theory</span> that they came <span>directly</span> from <span>continental</span> <span>Europe</span>.<br/>
🎧 For one thing, it's not <span>clear</span> just how <span>sufficient</span> <span>numbers</span> of men and <span>women</span> could have been <span>transported</span> to <span>Ireland<br/></span>
🎧 to <span>establish</span> a <span>viable</span> <span>population</span>.<br/>
🎧 As you know, the <span>hunter-gatherer</span> <span>economy</span> which <span>existed</span> <span>beforehand</span> was <span>based</span> on small <span>scattered</span> <span>groups</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>farming</span> <span>economy</span> would almost <span>certainly</span> have <span>required</span> much <span>larger</span> <span>communities<br/></span>
🎧 to do all the work <span>needed</span> to <span>plant</span> and <span>tend</span> <span>sufficient</span> <span>crops</span> to <span>sustain</span> them through the year.<br/>
🎧 The <span>early</span> <span>farmers</span> <span>kept</span> <span>various</span> <span>animals</span>, <span>including</span> <span>cattle</span> and <span>sheep</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's also <span>evidence</span> of <span>pigs</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it is <span>possible</span> that these could have been <span>descended</span> from the <span>native</span> <span>wild</span> <span>species</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, we know from <span>modern</span> <span>farming</span> that if the <span>level</span> of <span>breeding</span> <span>stock</span> <span>falls</span> <span>below</span> about <span>300</span> <span>females</span>,<br/>
🎧 the future of the <span>species</span> <span>locally</span> is at <span>risk</span>.<br/>
🎧 So we must <span>assume</span> that from the <span>beginnings</span> of <span>Neolithic</span> <span>farming</span>,<br/>
🎧 the number of <span>breeding</span> <span>sheep</span> would have <span>considerably</span> <span>exceeded</span> <span>300</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>national</span> <span>cattle</span> <span>herd</span> must have been of a <span>similar</span> size.<br/>
🎧 The <span>question</span> is how these were <span>brought</span> to the <span>area</span> and where they came from.<br/>
🎧 It's usually <span>suggested</span> that the <span>Neolithic</span> <span>settlers</span> used <span>skin-covered</span> <span>boats</span> to <span>transport</span> <span>livestock</span>.<br/>
🎧 But this <span>method</span> would have <span>severely</span> <span>restricted</span> the <span>range</span> of the <span>colonising</span> <span>fleets</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>sheer</span> <span>volume</span> of <span>animal</span> <span>transport</span> <span>necessary<br/></span>
🎧 <span>means</span> it's <span>unlikely</span> that this <span>livestock</span> could have been <span>brought</span> from <span>anywhere</span> <span>further</span> than <span>England</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about <span>crops</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, two <span>main</span> <span>cereal</span> <span>crops</span> were <span>introduced</span> to <span>Ireland</span> during this <span>time:<br/></span>
🎧 <span>wheat</span> and <span>barley</span>, both in <span>several</span> <span>varieties</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>main</span> <span>evidence</span> for their <span>presence</span> <span>consists</span> of <span>impressions</span> on <span>pottery</span>,<br/>
🎧 where a <span>cereal</span> <span>grain</span> <span>accidentally</span> <span>became</span> <span>embedded</span> in the <span>surface</span> of a pot before it was <span>fired</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>grain</span> <span>itself</span> was <span>destroyed</span> by the <span>firing</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it <span>left</span> an <span>impression</span> on the <span>pot<br/></span>
🎧 which could be <span>studied</span> and <span>identified</span> by <span>botanists</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's <span>turn</span> our <span>attention</span> now to the <span>farming</span> <span>technology</span> <span>available</span> at that time.<br/>
🎧 Before the <span>cereal</span> <span>crops</span> could be <span>planted</span>,<br/>
🎧 it would have been <span>necessary</span> to <span>clear</span> the <span>forest</span> and to <span>break</span> the <span>ground</span> by <span>ploughing</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>stone</span> <span>blade</span> of a <span>plough</span> has been <span>discovered</span> during <span>excavation</span> in <span>County</span> <span>Mayo</span> in <span>western</span> <span>Ireland</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>body</span> of the <span>plough</span> would have been of <span>wood<br/></span>
🎧 and could have been <span>drawn</span> by people,<br/>
🎧 but it's also <span>likely</span> that <span>cattle</span> were used.<br/>
🎧 Now, the <span>cultivation</span> of <span>crops</span> and the <span>husbandry</span> of <span>livestock</span> <span>brought</span> about changes in <span>people's</span> <span>lifestyle<br/></span>
🎧 such as the <span>type</span> of <span>shelters</span> they made.<br/>
🎧 For one thing, <span>instead</span> of <span>moving</span> from place to <span>place<br/></span>
🎧 they <span>needed</span> <span>permanent</span> <span>dwellings</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>stone</span> <span>axes</span> used to <span>chop</span> down <span>trees</span> to make these <span>dwellings<br/></span>
🎧 were <span>far</span> <span>superior</span> to any that the <span>Stone</span> Age <span>hunter-gatherers</span> used.<br/>
🎧 To make the <span>axes</span>, <span>sources</span> of <span>suitable</span> <span>stone</span> had to be <span>found</span> and <span>systematically</span> <span>exploited</span>.<br/>
🎧 These <span>so-called</span> <span>'axe</span> <span>factories'</span> were really <span>quarries</span> rather than <span>factories</span>,<br/>
🎧 as the <span>manufacture</span> of the <span>axes</span> wasn't <span>regularly</span> <span>performed</span> on the <span>quarry</span> <span>site</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, after the <span>axe</span> had been <span>chipped</span> into <span>shape</span>,<br/>
🎧 they <span>needed</span> water and <span>sand</span> for <span>grinding</span> and <span>polishing</span>,<br/>
🎧 so a high <span>mountainside</span> wouldn't have been an <span>appropriate</span> place for this.<br/>
🎧 So this <span>final</span> <span>stage</span> of the <span>manufacture</span> must have been <span>carried</span> out <span>close</span> to <span>water<br/></span>
🎧 and sure enough, there's <span>ample</span> <span>evidence</span> of this at <span>coastal</span> <span>sites</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now it's <span>clear</span> that these <span>Neolithic</span> <span>axes</span> were <span>transported</span> all over <span>Ireland</span>,<br/>
🎧 as well as to <span>Scotland</span> and the <span>south</span> of <span>England</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's not really <span>surprising</span> that <span>axes</span> from <span>'axe</span> <span>factories'</span> in <span>England</span> have also been <span>found</span> in <span>Ireland</span>.<br/>
🎧 At the very <span>least</span>, this <span>indicates</span> that there was a <span>link</span> between the two <span>islands</span> during that <span>period</span>.<br/>
🎧 One of the most <span>useful</span> <span>innovations</span> of the <span>colonisers</span> was <span>pottery</span> <span>making</span>,<br/>
🎧 which was quite <span>unknown</span> to <span>Irish</span> <span>hunter-gatherers</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>pottery</span> was probably made by <span>shaping</span> <span>clay</span> into a <span>ball</span> with the <span>hand</span>,<br/>
🎧 and then <span>hollowing</span> it until the <span>walls</span> were the right <span>thickness</span>.<br/>
🎧 After <span>firing</span>, the outside was often <span>polished</span>.<br/>
🎧 This would have <span>helped</span> the <span>pots</span> to <span>retain</span> water, as they weren't <span>glazed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now we know that the <span>clay</span> used usually came from <span>local</span> <span>sources</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>suggests</span> that <span>manufacture</span> was on a <span>fairly</span> small <span>scale</span>,<br/>
🎧 even though <span>thousands</span> of <span>fragments</span> are usually <span>found</span> at <span>Neolithic</span> <span>sites</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the course of time <span>decoration</span> <span>began</span> to <span>appear</span>.<br/>
🎧 At first this <span>looked</span> like a <span>series</span> of <span>stitches</span> and was just around the <span>tops</span> of the <span>pots</span>.<br/>
🎧 This could have been an <span>imitation</span> of <span>earlier</span> <span>vessels</span> which were made of <span>leather</span> <span>sewn</span> <span>onto</span> <span>wood</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then <span>eventually</span> <span>pots</span> with <span>decoration..</span>.<br/>
