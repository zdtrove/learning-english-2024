🎧 Good morning. I'd like to open a bank account, please.<br/>
🎧 Certainly.<br/>
🎧 If you'd like to take a seat, I'll just get some details from you.<br/>
🎧 It won't take long.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Is it a current account or a deposit account you wanted?<br/>
🎧 A current account.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I've got the application form here then.<br/>
🎧 We have different types - I see you've got our leaflet there.<br/>
🎧 I've decided on the one called 'Select.'<br/>
🎧 Right, that's fine, so, first of all, can I have your full name please?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's Pieter Henes.<br/>
🎧 That's PIETER.<br/>
🎧 Is it HENNES?<br/>
🎧 Uh, only one N actually. It's a less common spelling of the name.<br/>
🎧 Oh, right. Okay.<br/>
🎧 And what's your date of birth please?<br/>
🎧 The 27th of the first, 1973.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And will this be a joint account?<br/>
🎧 No, just myself.<br/>
🎧 Okay, fine.<br/>
🎧 And where are you living, Mr Henes?<br/>
🎧 15, Riverside.<br/>
🎧 Is that all one word?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Exeter?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 How long have you been at your present address?<br/>
🎧 Er, is it more than two years?<br/>
🎧 Ah, just two weeks actually.<br/>
🎧 I only arrived in the country a month ago.<br/>
🎧 I'm from Holland.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's fine.<br/>
🎧 But we normally ask for a previous address in that case.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, well, it's Rielsdorf 2.<br/>
🎧 That's RIELSDORF 2, Utrecht.<br/>
🎧 Holland.<br/>
🎧 Okay. Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Do you have a daytime telephone number?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I think the number at my office is 606295.<br/>
🎧 Um, just a minute, I'd better check.<br/>
🎧 Oh, no, sorry, 616. I'm not used to it yet.<br/>
🎧 Would you like my home number too?<br/>
🎧 Yes please.<br/>
🎧 It's 796431.<br/>
🎧 Are they both local numbers?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 ﻿Right. And your occupation?<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm in Britain as a project manager, but that's not my main job.<br/>
🎧 I'm an engineer by profession.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 I think I'll put that then. It's shorter!<br/>
🎧 Now, we usually ask for a piece of information which we can use to check your identity, for security reasons.<br/>
🎧 You know, if you phone us.<br/>
🎧 Like, erm, my wife's first name?<br/>
🎧 Mother's might be better. It's less likely to be known.<br/>
🎧 Okay. Hers is Siti.<br/>
🎧 Siti?<br/>
🎧 Yes, SITI.<br/>
🎧 It's Indonesian.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 And how much would you like to open your account with?<br/>
🎧 We usually ask for a minimum sum of £50.<br/>
🎧 That's about €75.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm going to transfer €2,000 from my Dutch account, just till I get paid.<br/>
🎧 In fact, I wanted to ask you about that.<br/>
🎧 What's the best way to do it?<br/>
🎧 It depends which bank you're with.<br/>
🎧 It's the Fransen Bank in Utrecht.<br/>
🎧 OK, fine. I'll check that in a minute.<br/>
🎧 If we have links with them we can do a direct transfer. But it's not a big problem either way.<br/>
🎧 Um, let's see.<br/>
🎧 How often would you like to receive statements?<br/>
🎧 I haven't really thought.<br/>
🎧 What's the usual thing?<br/>
🎧 It's up to you. Some people like them weekly.<br/>
🎧 Oh, no, that's too often.<br/>
🎧 Can I have them sent, um, once a month?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's fine.<br/>
🎧 Is there anything else?<br/>
🎧 I was thinking of registering for your internet service at some stage.<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes.<br/>
🎧 Would you like me to send you information about that?<br/>
🎧 Please, yes.<br/>
🎧 And would you like to receive information about the bank's other services -<br/>
🎧 insurance, loans, anything like that?<br/>
🎧 Hmm, I don't think so, thanks.<br/>
🎧 That's okay then.<br/>
🎧 And one last thing, if you agree...<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Welcome, everybody, to the lovely house and gardens of Rosewood,<br/>
🎧 once the home of the famous writer, Sebastian George.<br/>
🎧 He bought the house in 1902<br/>
🎧 although he had first seen it two years earlier.<br/>
🎧 At that time, the owners let it out to a tenant<br/>
🎧 because George was too slow making up his mind to buy it.<br/>
🎧 When it came back on the market, there was no hesitation<br/>
🎧 and he bought it immediately, for £9,300,<br/>
🎧 even though the house had no bathroom, no running water upstairs, and no electricity.<br/>
🎧 When he came here, he'd been married for ten years.<br/>
🎧 During that time, he'd become one of the most famous writers in the English-speaking world.<br/>
🎧 His professional success was enormous,<br/>
🎧 but his personal life wasn't as successful.<br/>
🎧 He was no longer on speaking terms with his brother<br/>
🎧 and had been devastated by the death at the age of seven of his elder daughter, Josephine.<br/>
🎧 Moving to Rosewood allowed the family to start a new life.<br/>
🎧 George regarded Rosewood as a pure example of a traditional country house of this part of England<br/>
🎧 and did some of his most successful writing here.<br/>
🎧 The house and its grounds became the family haven<br/>
🎧 and their escape to privacy and quiet.<br/>
🎧 The walls, and the mullioned windows were built of the local sandstone,<br/>
🎧 the tiles on the roofs and the bricks of the chimney stack were baked from local clay,<br/>
🎧 and the wooden structures inside came from oak trees which grow around here.<br/>
🎧 Now, please look at the map I've given you of the house and gardens.<br/>
🎧 We're here at the Information Centre.<br/>
🎧 Follow the path marked with the arrow<br/>
🎧 and the first area you come to is the orchard on your left.<br/>
🎧 As you go further down the path, there's the kitchen garden on the right<br/>
🎧 and as you go round the first sharp corner<br/>
🎧 you will find, to your left, an area where different types of pear tree have been planted<br/>
🎧 as well as some lovely flowers,<br/>
🎧 and this is known as Pear Alley - designed by George himself.<br/>
🎧 Next to this is the greenhouse<br/>
🎧 where some exotic plants and fruits are grown.<br/>
🎧 Follow the path round the second corner<br/>
🎧 and on your right you will see the entrance to the Mulberry Garden<br/>
🎧 with its 500-year-old tree.<br/>
🎧 Past the Mulberry Garden, follow the path until you reach the front of the house.<br/>
🎧 I suggest you spend a good hour wandering around this lovely building.<br/>
🎧 A guide takes visitor groups round every two hours.<br/>
🎧 If you would like to purchase any of George's books or other souvenirs,<br/>
🎧 then leave the house by the side entrance,<br/>
🎧 where you will find our shop, which is situated between the house and the garage<br/>
🎧 which contains the magnificent old Rolls-Royce car<br/>
🎧 which used to belong to George.<br/>
🎧 I expect by this time you may also be in need of a rest and some refreshment.<br/>
🎧 Most visitors are, so why don't you visit the tea room on the far side of the garage?<br/>
🎧 If you have time, there is a lovely walk down towards the River Dudwell.<br/>
🎧 For me, this is the best part of the estate.<br/>
🎧 This isn't on the map but it is all clearly signposted.<br/>
🎧 You cross the field which spreads along the banks of the river.<br/>
🎧 In spring, this area is well worth a visit.<br/>
🎧 Spend a minute or two watching the water pass by underneath as you cross the footbridge,<br/>
🎧 and then continue along the River Walk through the woodland.<br/>
🎧 On a hot summer's day the trees along this path provide welcome shade.<br/>
🎧 Eventually, you come to the water mill<br/>
🎧 which used to provide the electricity for the house -<br/>
🎧 only about four hours every evening - in George's time.<br/>
🎧 And, finally, for those of you who would like to see stunning views of the surrounding countryside<br/>
🎧 and who are a little bit more energetic,<br/>
🎧 when you return from the mill, take the first turning on your left<br/>
🎧 and climb up to the viewpoint.<br/>
🎧 You won't regret it.<br/>
🎧 Enjoy your visit!<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Lucy, we really need to get working on this marketing assignment.<br/>
🎧 We've only got five weeks left to the end of term to design it,<br/>
🎧 carry it out, and then write up the results.<br/>
🎧 Sure. Well, let's get started right now.<br/>
🎧 Let's go over the instructions.<br/>
🎧 What exactly do we have to do?<br/>
🎧 Well, it says here we have to look at one area of the entertainment industry.<br/>
🎧 There's a list of the different types.<br/>
🎧 What are they?<br/>
🎧 Music, cinema, theatre, sport, and eating out.<br/>
🎧 Is that all?<br/>
🎧 Looks like it.<br/>
🎧 So we choose one branch of the industry<br/>
🎧 and then we look at how two different groups of people use it?<br/>
🎧 Is that right?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 And do we have to use any particular method to get our data?<br/>
🎧 Can we mail out a questionnaire, or do face-to-face interviews, or maybe even observations?<br/>
🎧 Well actually, it looks like we don't have a choice.<br/>
🎧 We have to do telephone interviews.<br/>
🎧 Okay, so at least we don't have to waste time deciding between the different methods.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, that's right.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and the other requirement is the number of interviewees.<br/>
🎧 Not too many, I hope. Ten? Twenty?<br/>
🎧 Well, we have to do two groups, remember,<br/>
🎧 and it looks like we have to interview fifteen for each group.<br/>
🎧 That's thirty altogether then.<br/>
🎧 It's going to take ages.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but remember we're working on this together,<br/>
🎧 so we'll only have to do fifteen each.<br/>
🎧 Okay, so those are all the requirements?<br/>
🎧 Yes, looks like it.<br/>
🎧 So, first, which area are we going to choose?<br/>
🎧 My preference would be cinema, since that's where I spend most of my money.<br/>
🎧 Hmm, I don't think that's such a good idea.<br/>
🎧 I don't think there are huge differences in the market there.<br/>
🎧 I mean, you get young and old, male and female, rich and poor...<br/>
🎧 all going to the same movies.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, maybe you're right.<br/>
🎧 Let's make it music then.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So, what two groups will we compare and contrast?<br/>
🎧 Male and female?<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 Most of my female friends like the same music as me.<br/>
🎧 Different age groups would be much more likely to show up differences, I think.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I suppose you're right again.<br/>
🎧 I'll take some notes, shall I?<br/>
🎧 So... Age Groups.<br/>
🎧 What do you think?<br/>
🎧 Maybe 25 or under for one group, and 45 or over for the other group?<br/>
🎧 That should show up differences.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Okay. Next.<br/>
🎧 How about the kind of music they like? Let's give them some choices and then we can just tick boxes.<br/>
🎧 Okay. Let's have pop, jazz, folk, easy listening...<br/>
🎧 What else?<br/>
🎧 Well, we should include classical.<br/>
🎧 Some people like it, you know.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 And then we should have how they listen to music.<br/>
🎧 The medium. Right. Let's include radio, CD...<br/>
🎧 and then I guess there's TV.<br/>
🎧 What about concerts? You know, in pubs and halls.<br/>
🎧 Oh yeah, we should include live music of course.<br/>
🎧 Okay, we're on a roll now!<br/>
🎧 Next point could be about where they actually get their music.<br/>
🎧 You mean like, do they buy it in music shops, or department stores?<br/>
🎧 Yes, or download it from the Internet.<br/>
🎧 Right. That could be for recorded music.<br/>
🎧 Then we need another section for live music.<br/>
🎧 Where do they go for that?<br/>
🎧 Okay. Let's say disco, pub, club, concert hall...<br/>
🎧 Or opera house!<br/>
🎧 And I guess we should include karaoke bars.<br/>
🎧 Not many of them in this city!<br/>
🎧 Okay. We'll leave that out then.<br/>
🎧 So, what's left to do?<br/>
🎧 That's it.<br/>
🎧 Well, now we can make a time-scale for doing it.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Good morning everyone.<br/>
🎧 Last week we were looking at the hunter-gatherers in Ireland,<br/>
🎧 across the Irish Sea from England.<br/>
🎧 Today, we're going to move on to the period between 4 and 6000 years ago,<br/>
🎧 known as the Neolithic period,<br/>
🎧 which is when a total farming economy was introduced in Ireland.<br/>
🎧 Now, there are several hypotheses about the origins of the first Neolithic settlers in Ireland,<br/>
🎧 but most of these contain problems.<br/>
🎧 For instance, there are considerable archaeological difficulties about the theory that they came from England.<br/>
🎧 The evidence doesn't really add up.<br/>
🎧 But there are even greater practical problems about the theory that they came directly from continental Europe.<br/>
🎧 For one thing, it's not clear just how sufficient numbers of men and women could have been transported to Ireland<br/>
🎧 to establish a viable population.<br/>
🎧 As you know, the hunter-gatherer economy which existed beforehand was based on small scattered groups.<br/>
🎧 The farming economy would almost certainly have required much larger communities<br/>
🎧 to do all the work needed to plant and tend sufficient crops to sustain them through the year.<br/>
🎧 The early farmers kept various animals, including cattle and sheep.<br/>
🎧 There's also evidence of pigs,<br/>
🎧 but it is possible that these could have been descended from the native wild species.<br/>
🎧 Now, we know from modern farming that if the level of breeding stock falls below about 300 females,<br/>
🎧 the future of the species locally is at risk.<br/>
🎧 So we must assume that from the beginnings of Neolithic farming,<br/>
🎧 the number of breeding sheep would have considerably exceeded 300,<br/>
🎧 and the national cattle herd must have been of a similar size.<br/>
🎧 The question is how these were brought to the area and where they came from.<br/>
🎧 It's usually suggested that the Neolithic settlers used skin-covered boats to transport livestock.<br/>
🎧 But this method would have severely restricted the range of the colonising fleets.<br/>
🎧 The sheer volume of animal transport necessary<br/>
🎧 means it's unlikely that this livestock could have been brought from anywhere further than England.<br/>
🎧 What about crops?<br/>
🎧 Well, two main cereal crops were introduced to Ireland during this time:<br/>
🎧 wheat and barley, both in several varieties.<br/>
🎧 The main evidence for their presence consists of impressions on pottery,<br/>
🎧 where a cereal grain accidentally became embedded in the surface of a pot before it was fired.<br/>
🎧 The grain itself was destroyed by the firing,<br/>
🎧 but it left an impression on the pot<br/>
🎧 which could be studied and identified by botanists.<br/>
🎧 Let's turn our attention now to the farming technology available at that time.<br/>
🎧 Before the cereal crops could be planted,<br/>
🎧 it would have been necessary to clear the forest and to break the ground by ploughing.<br/>
🎧 The stone blade of a plough has been discovered during excavation in County Mayo in western Ireland.<br/>
🎧 The body of the plough would have been of wood<br/>
🎧 and could have been drawn by people,<br/>
🎧 but it's also likely that cattle were used.<br/>
🎧 Now, the cultivation of crops and the husbandry of livestock brought about changes in people's lifestyle<br/>
🎧 such as the type of shelters they made.<br/>
🎧 For one thing, instead of moving from place to place<br/>
🎧 they needed permanent dwellings.<br/>
🎧 The stone axes used to chop down trees to make these dwellings<br/>
🎧 were far superior to any that the Stone Age hunter-gatherers used.<br/>
🎧 To make the axes, sources of suitable stone had to be found and systematically exploited.<br/>
🎧 These so-called 'axe factories' were really quarries rather than factories,<br/>
🎧 as the manufacture of the axes wasn't regularly performed on the quarry site.<br/>
🎧 However, after the axe had been chipped into shape,<br/>
🎧 they needed water and sand for grinding and polishing,<br/>
🎧 so a high mountainside wouldn't have been an appropriate place for this.<br/>
🎧 So this final stage of the manufacture must have been carried out close to water<br/>
🎧 and sure enough, there's ample evidence of this at coastal sites.<br/>
🎧 Now it's clear that these Neolithic axes were transported all over Ireland,<br/>
🎧 as well as to Scotland and the south of England.<br/>
🎧 It's not really surprising that axes from 'axe factories' in England have also been found in Ireland.<br/>
🎧 At the very least, this indicates that there was a link between the two islands during that period.<br/>
🎧 One of the most useful innovations of the colonisers was pottery making,<br/>
🎧 which was quite unknown to Irish hunter-gatherers.<br/>
🎧 The pottery was probably made by shaping clay into a ball with the hand,<br/>
🎧 and then hollowing it until the walls were the right thickness.<br/>
🎧 After firing, the outside was often polished.<br/>
🎧 This would have helped the pots to retain water, as they weren't glazed.<br/>
🎧 Now we know that the clay used usually came from local sources,<br/>
🎧 which suggests that manufacture was on a fairly small scale,<br/>
🎧 even though thousands of fragments are usually found at Neolithic sites.<br/>
🎧 In the course of time decoration began to appear.<br/>
🎧 At first this looked like a series of stitches and was just around the tops of the pots.<br/>
🎧 This could have been an imitation of earlier vessels which were made of leather sewn onto wood.<br/>
🎧 Then eventually pots with decoration...<br/>
<br/><br/>
