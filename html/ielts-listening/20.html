🎧 <span>Welcome</span> to all of you.<br/>
🎧 Can <span>everybody</span> see and hear me?<br/>
🎧 Good. I'm <span>Sally</span>, your <span>guide</span> for this <span>tour</span> of the <span>Bicentennial</span> <span>Park</span>.<br/>
🎧 I hope that you're all <span>wearing</span> your most <span>comfortable</span> <span>shoes</span> and that you can keep up the <span>pace</span>.<br/>
🎧 So let's get under way on our <span>tour</span> around this wonderful <span>park</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll start today with some <span>general</span> <span>background</span> <span>information</span>.<br/>
🎧 There used to be a lot of <span>factories</span> in this <span>area</span> until the <span>1960s</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Creating</span> the <span>park</span> <span>required</span> the <span>demolition</span> of lots of <span>derelict</span> <span>buildings</span> on the <span>site</span>,<br/>
🎧 so most of the <span>exciting</span> <span>park</span> <span>space</span> all around you was <span>originally</span> <span>warehouses</span> and <span>storehouses</span>.<br/>
🎧 The idea of <span>building</span> a <span>public</span> <span>park</span> <span>here<br/></span>
🎧 was first <span>discussed</span> when a <span>property</span> <span>developer</span> <span>proposed</span> a <span>high-rise</span> <span>housing</span> <span>development</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>local</span> <span>community</span> wasn't happy.<br/>
🎧 If the <span>land</span> was to be <span>cleaned</span> up,<br/>
🎧 they wanted to use the <span>site</span> for <span>recreation</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Residents</span> wanted open <span>space</span> for <span>outdoor</span> <span>activities</span>,<br/>
🎧 rather than <span>housing</span> or even an <span>indoor</span> <span>sports</span> <span>complex</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, to the <span>Bicentennial</span> <span>Park</span> <span>itself</span>.<br/>
🎧 It has two <span>areas</span>,<br/>
🎧 a <span>nature</span> <span>reserve</span> and a <span>formal</span> <span>park</span> with <span>man-made</span> <span>features</span> and <span>gardens</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>tall</span> <span>blue-and-white</span> <span>building</span> in <span>front</span> of us is called The <span>Tower<br/></span>
🎧 and is the <span>centre</span> <span>point</span> for the <span>formal</span> <span>gardens</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>stands</span> <span>twelve</span> <span>metres</span> high,<br/>
🎧 so, <span>follow</span> me up the <span>stairs</span> to where we can take <span>advantage</span> of the <span>fantastic</span> <span>views</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, here we are at the top of The <span>Tower</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we're going to look at the <span>view</span> from each <span>direction</span>.<br/>
🎧 Out to the <span>east</span>, the large <span>buildings</span> about a <span>kilometre</span> away are on the <span>Olympic</span> <span>site</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's an <span>indoor</span> <span>arena</span> for <span>gymnastics</span>,<br/>
🎧 a <span>stadium</span> for <span>track</span> and <span>field<br/></span>
🎧 and a <span>swimming</span> <span>pool</span> for <span>races</span> and <span>synchronised</span> <span>swimming</span> and also <span>diving</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you look <span>carefully</span> down there,<br/>
🎧 you can see the <span>train</span> <span>lines</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Olympic</span> <span>site</span> has its own <span>station</span> to <span>encourage</span> the use of <span>public</span> <span>transport</span>.<br/>
🎧 There is also a car <span>park</span>, but it only <span>holds</span> a <span>limited</span> number of <span>cars</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>formal</span> <span>park</span> has some <span>specially-created</span> water <span>features</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you look out here to the <span>south</span>, you can see a <span>circular</span> <span>ornamental</span> <span>pond</span>.<br/>
🎧 And around to the <span>west</span>,<br/>
🎧 you can <span>relax</span> and sit on a <span>bench</span> to <span>smell</span> the <span>flowers</span> in the <span>rose</span> garden,<br/>
🎧 and finally up to the <span>north</span>, if you look in <span>front</span> of you now,<br/>
🎧 there's a <span>lake</span> with a small <span>island</span> in the <span>centre</span>,<br/>
🎧 you can <span>hire</span> <span>rowing</span> <span>boats</span> at the <span>boat</span> <span>shed</span>, which you can't see from here,<br/>
🎧 but if you look through the <span>trees</span>, you can see the <span>café</span>,<br/>
🎧 which has <span>lovely</span> <span>views</span> across the water.<br/>
🎧 Okay, let's <span>climb</span> down now.<br/>
🎧 We will go now and have a look at the <span>nature</span> <span>reserve</span> <span>section</span> of the <span>park</span>,<br/>
🎧 which has <span>opened</span> up <span>natural</span> <span>wetland</span> to the <span>public</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Mangroves</span> have been made more <span>accessible</span> to <span>visitors</span> by the <span>boardwalk</span> <span>built</span> during the <span>park's</span> <span>upgrade</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'd think that people would come here to look at the <span>unusual</span> <span>plant</span> life of the <span>area</span>,<br/>
🎧 but in <span>fact</span>, it's more often used for <span>cycling</span> and is very <span>popular</span> with the <span>local</span> <span>clubs</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is the <span>far</span> end of the <span>park<br/></span>
🎧 and over there you can see the <span>Frog</span> <span>Pond</span>,<br/>
🎧 a <span>natural</span> <span>feature</span> here long before the <span>park</span> was <span>designed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Just next to it we have our <span>outdoor</span> <span>classroom</span>,<br/>
🎧 a <span>favourite</span> <span>spot</span> for school <span>parties</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>area</span> is now most often used by <span>primary</span> <span>schools</span> for <span>biology</span> <span>lessons</span>.<br/>
🎧 And finally let's <span>pass</span> by the <span>Waterbird</span> <span>Refuge</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>area</span> is in a <span>sheltered</span> <span>part</span> of the <span>estuary</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's why the <span>park's</span> <span>viewing</span> <span>shelter</span> is a <span>favourite</span> <span>spot</span> for <span>bird</span> <span>watchers</span> who can use it to <span>spy</span> through <span>binoculars</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can <span>watch</span> a <span>variety</span> of water <span>birds</span>,<br/>
🎧 but most <span>visitors</span> <span>expect</span> to see <span>black</span> <span>swans</span> when they come to the <span>shelter</span>.<br/>
🎧 You might <span>spot</span> one yourself right now!<br/>
🎧 Well, here we are back at our <span>starting</span> <span>point..</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 <span>Remind</span> me, <span>Trevor</span>, how long is the <span>presentation</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Dr</span> <span>White</span> said <span>three</span> <span>per</span> <span>hour</span>.<br/>
🎧 So about <span>twenty</span> <span>minutes</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Well…</span> it'll be <span>fifteen</span> <span>minutes</span> <span>per</span> <span>presentation</span>.<br/>
🎧 And <span>five</span> <span>minutes</span> for <span>questions</span>.<br/>
🎧 And is this one going to be <span>assessed</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, not this time <span>round<br/></span>
🎧 because it's the first <span>one…</span> you know.<br/>
🎧 Oh, good <span>news</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>Trevor</span>, what are we going to <span>include</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, do you think we <span>ought</span> to give some <span>historical</span> <span>background</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh no, definitely not, we won't have time!<br/>
🎧 <span>OK…<br/></span>
🎧 but I think we <span>ought</span> to say something about the <span>geographical</span> <span>location<br/></span>
🎧 <span>cos</span> not a lot of people know where the <span>islands</span> are.<br/>
🎧 Yes, <span>okay…<br/></span>
🎧 I'll take <span>notes</span>, shall I?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, <span>that'll</span> be a help.<br/>
🎧 So, <span>geographical</span> <span>location…<br/></span>
🎧 Then we <span>ought</span> to give an <span>overview</span> of the whole <span>education</span> <span>system</span>.<br/>
🎧 Shouldn't we say something about the <span>economy</span>,<br/>
🎧 you know <span>agricultural</span> <span>produce</span>, <span>minerals</span> and so <span>forth</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>Dr</span> <span>White</span> said we shouldn't go into that <span>sort</span> of <span>detail</span>.<br/>
🎧 But it's <span>pretty</span> important when you think about it,<br/>
🎧 you know, because it does <span>influence</span> the <span>education</span> <span>system</span>.<br/>
🎧 Look, let's think about that one later shall we?<br/>
🎧 Let's see how we're doing for time.<br/>
🎧 Okay, <span>so…</span> <span>general</span> <span>overview</span> of <span>education</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of <span>course…</span> and then the <span>role</span> of English <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm..</span>. <span>Nope</span>, that <span>goes</span> in the <span>Language</span> <span>Policy</span> <span>Seminar</span>, don't you remember?<br/>
🎧 Are you sure?<br/>
🎧 <span>Positive</span>.<br/>
🎧 Alright.<br/>
🎧 so those are the <span>topics</span> we're going to <span>be…</span> to be <span>covering</span>.<br/>
🎧 We need to think about what to <span>prepare…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Dr</span> <span>White</span> said he wanted us to use <span>plenty</span> of <span>visuals</span> and things <span>and..</span>.<br/>
🎧 we might as well try them out when we're not being <span>assessed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, the most important thing is the <span>overhead</span> <span>projector</span>.<br/>
🎧 No <span>problem</span>, we'll get that from the <span>media</span> room.<br/>
🎧 Must remember to book it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Well…</span> we'll need a map of course.<br/>
🎧 Probably <span>two…</span> one of the <span>islands…</span> large <span>scale</span>.<br/>
🎧 And one of <span>West</span> <span>Africa</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, the <span>West</span> <span>African</span> one is no <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's one in the <span>Resources</span> Room.<br/>
🎧 Oh yeah, of course, the <span>resources</span> <span>room;<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>islands</span> are going to be more of a <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 Tell you what, there's a very <span>clear</span> map of <span>Santiago</span> in that <span>tourist</span> <span>brochure</span> I <span>showed</span> you last week.<br/>
🎧 Don't you remember it?<br/>
🎧 Oh yeah, that's <span>right;<br/></span>
🎧 we can just use the <span>tourist</span> <span>brochure</span>.<br/>
🎧 We also need <span>statistics</span> on <span>several</span> different things.<br/>
🎧 <span>Literacy</span> <span>rates</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, and school <span>places</span>.<br/>
🎧 How about the <span>encyclopedia</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Nah…</span> not <span>up-to-date</span> enough!<br/>
🎧 <span>Mmm…</span> why don't we call the <span>embassy</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh…</span> <span>someone's</span> <span>enthusiastic</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Well…</span> if <span>something's</span> <span>worth</span> <span>doing…<br/></span>
🎧 I <span>know…</span> it's <span>worth</span> doing <span>well…</span> okay.<br/>
🎧 We can find out <span>statistics</span> on school <span>places</span> from them as well.<br/>
🎧 Might as well.<br/>
🎧 Look, <span>Julie</span>, it's almost time for our <span>tutorials</span>.<br/>
🎧 We can meet again on <span>Monday<br/></span>
🎧 but we need to <span>prepare..</span>.<br/>

🎧 In <span>today's</span> <span>lecture</span>, I'm going to talk about <span>Monosodium</span> <span>Glutamate</span>,<br/>
🎧 or <span>MSG</span>, as it's more <span>commonly</span> <span>known</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, <span>MSG</span> as you probably know, is a <span>flavour</span> <span>enhancer<br/></span>
🎧 which is used <span>particularly</span> in <span>Chinese</span> and <span>Japanese</span> cooking.<br/>
🎧 Today, I am going to <span>explore</span> why it is so <span>popular</span> in these <span>cuisines<br/></span>
🎧 and, more <span>importantly</span>, how does it <span>enhance</span> the <span>flavour</span> of food?<br/>
🎧 The <span>main</span> <span>reason</span> why <span>MSG</span> is more <span>commonly</span> used in <span>Japanese</span> <span>meals</span> is <span>tradition</span>.<br/>
🎧 For many <span>thousands</span> of years,<br/>
🎧 the <span>Japanese</span> have <span>incorporated</span> a <span>type</span> of <span>seaweed</span> <span>known</span> as <span>kombu</span> in their cooking,<br/>
🎧 as they <span>discovered</span> it had the <span>ability</span> to make food <span>taste</span> better.<br/>
🎧 But it wasn't until <span>1908<br/></span>
🎧 that the <span>ingredient</span> in <span>kombu</span>, which was <span>responsible</span> for the <span>improvement</span> in <span>flavour</span>,<br/>
🎧 was actually <span>discovered</span> to be <span>glutamate</span> by <span>scientists</span> working there.<br/>
🎧 From <span>1908</span> until <span>1956</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>glutamate</span> was <span>produced</span> <span>commercially</span> in <span>Japan<br/></span>
🎧 by a very <span>slow</span> and <span>expensive</span> <span>means</span> of <span>extraction</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was in <span>1956</span> that the <span>speed</span> of the <span>process</span> was <span>improved</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>industrial</span> <span>production</span> <span>increased</span> <span>dramatically<br/></span>
🎧 and still <span>continues</span> to <span>increase</span> to this day.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, <span>hundreds</span> of <span>thousands</span> of <span>tonnes</span> of <span>MSG</span> are <span>produced</span> all over the <span>world</span> today.<br/>
🎧 So what exactly is <span>MSG</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>Monosodium</span> <span>Glutamate</span> <span>contains</span> <span>78.2%</span> <span>glutamate</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>12.2%</span> <span>sodium<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>9.6%</span> water.<br/>
🎧 <span>Glutamate</span> is an <span>amino</span> <span>acid</span> that can be <span>found</span> <span>naturally</span> in all <span>protein-containing</span> <span>foods</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>erm</span>, so this <span>includes</span> food such as <span>meat</span> and <span>cheese</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is <span>widely</span> <span>known</span> that <span>Chinese</span> and <span>Japanese</span> food <span>contains</span> <span>MSG<br/></span>
🎧 but many people don't <span>seem</span> to be <span>aware</span> that it is also used in <span>foods</span> in other <span>parts</span> of the <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, it is <span>found</span> in <span>commercially</span> made <span>Italian</span> <span>pizzas</span>,<br/>
🎧 in <span>American</span> <span>fast</span> food and in <span>Britain</span>, <span>MSG</span> is used in things like <span>potato</span> <span>crisps</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, how exactly does <span>MSG</span> work?<br/>
🎧 Well, in the <span>Western</span> <span>world</span>, we <span>commonly</span> talk of <span>four</span> <span>'tastes'</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I'm sure you're all <span>familiar</span> with the <span>concepts</span> of <span>sweet</span>, <span>sour</span>, <span>bitter</span> and <span>salt</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, in <span>1908</span>, <span>Kikunae</span> <span>Ikeda</span> <span>identified</span> a <span>fifth</span> <span>'taste'</span>.<br/>
🎧 And it is thought that <span>MSG</span> <span>intensifies</span> this <span>naturally</span> <span>occurring</span> <span>'taste'</span> in some food.<br/>
🎧 It does make perfect <span>evolutionary</span> <span>sense</span> that we should have the <span>ability</span> to <span>detect</span> or <span>taste</span> <span>glutamate<br/></span>
🎧 because it is the <span>amino</span> <span>acid</span> which is most <span>common</span> in <span>natural</span> <span>foods</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>John</span> <span>Prescott</span>, an <span>associate</span> <span>professor</span> at the University of <span>Chicago</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>suggests</span> that this <span>fifth</span> <span>taste</span> <span>serves</span> a <span>purpose</span> just as the other <span>tastes</span> do.<br/>
🎧 He <span>suggests</span> that it <span>signals</span> to us the <span>presence</span> of <span>protein</span> in food,<br/>
🎧 in the same way that <span>sweetness</span> <span>indicates</span> that a food <span>contains</span> <span>energy-giving</span> <span>carbohydrates</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Bitterness</span>, he says, <span>alerts</span> us to <span>toxins</span> in the food,<br/>
🎧 while <span>sourness</span> <span>warns</span> us of <span>spoilage<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>saltiness</span> <span>signals</span> the <span>presence</span> of <span>minerals</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, what else do we know <span>about..</span>.<br/>
