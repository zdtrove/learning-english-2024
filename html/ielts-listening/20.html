🎧 Welcome to all of you.<br/>
🎧 Can everybody see and hear me?<br/>
🎧 Good. I'm Sally, your guide for this tour of the Bicentennial Park.<br/>
🎧 I hope that you're all wearing your most comfortable shoes and that you can keep up the pace.<br/>
🎧 So let's get under way on our tour around this wonderful park.<br/>
🎧 I'll start today with some general background information.<br/>
🎧 There used to be a lot of factories in this area until the 1960s.<br/>
🎧 Creating the park required the demolition of lots of derelict buildings on the site,<br/>
🎧 so most of the exciting park space all around you was originally warehouses and storehouses.<br/>
🎧 The idea of building a public park here<br/>
🎧 was first discussed when a property developer proposed a high-rise housing development,<br/>
🎧 but the local community wasn't happy.<br/>
🎧 If the land was to be cleaned up,<br/>
🎧 they wanted to use the site for recreation.<br/>
🎧 Residents wanted open space for outdoor activities,<br/>
🎧 rather than housing or even an indoor sports complex.<br/>
🎧 Now, to the Bicentennial Park itself.<br/>
🎧 It has two areas,<br/>
🎧 a nature reserve and a formal park with man-made features and gardens.<br/>
🎧 The tall blue-and-white building in front of us is called The Tower<br/>
🎧 and is the centre point for the formal gardens.<br/>
🎧 It stands twelve metres high,<br/>
🎧 so, follow me up the stairs to where we can take advantage of the fantastic views.<br/>
🎧 Well, here we are at the top of The Tower,<br/>
🎧 and we're going to look at the view from each direction.<br/>
🎧 Out to the east, the large buildings about a kilometre away are on the Olympic site.<br/>
🎧 There's an indoor arena for gymnastics,<br/>
🎧 a stadium for track and field<br/>
🎧 and a swimming pool for races and synchronised swimming and also diving.<br/>
🎧 If you look carefully down there,<br/>
🎧 you can see the train lines.<br/>
🎧 The Olympic site has its own station to encourage the use of public transport.<br/>
🎧 There is also a car park, but it only holds a limited number of cars.<br/>
🎧 The formal park has some specially-created water features.<br/>
🎧 If you look out here to the south, you can see a circular ornamental pond.<br/>
🎧 And around to the west,<br/>
🎧 you can relax and sit on a bench to smell the flowers in the rose garden,<br/>
🎧 and finally up to the north, if you look in front of you now,<br/>
🎧 there's a lake with a small island in the centre,<br/>
🎧 you can hire rowing boats at the boat shed, which you can't see from here,<br/>
🎧 but if you look through the trees, you can see the café,<br/>
🎧 which has lovely views across the water.<br/>
🎧 Okay, let's climb down now.<br/>
🎧 We will go now and have a look at the nature reserve section of the park,<br/>
🎧 which has opened up natural wetland to the public.<br/>
🎧 The Mangroves have been made more accessible to visitors by the boardwalk built during the park's upgrade.<br/>
🎧 You'd think that people would come here to look at the unusual plant life of the area,<br/>
🎧 but in fact, it's more often used for cycling and is very popular with the local clubs.<br/>
🎧 This is the far end of the park<br/>
🎧 and over there you can see the Frog Pond,<br/>
🎧 a natural feature here long before the park was designed.<br/>
🎧 Just next to it we have our outdoor classroom,<br/>
🎧 a favourite spot for school parties.<br/>
🎧 The area is now most often used by primary schools for biology lessons.<br/>
🎧 And finally let's pass by the Waterbird Refuge.<br/>
🎧 This area is in a sheltered part of the estuary,<br/>
🎧 that's why the park's viewing shelter is a favourite spot for bird watchers who can use it to spy through binoculars.<br/>
🎧 You can watch a variety of water birds,<br/>
🎧 but most visitors expect to see black swans when they come to the shelter.<br/>
🎧 You might spot one yourself right now!<br/>
🎧 Well, here we are back at our starting point...<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Remind me, Trevor, how long is the presentation?<br/>
🎧 Dr White said three per hour.<br/>
🎧 So about twenty minutes?<br/>
🎧 Well… it'll be fifteen minutes per presentation.<br/>
🎧 And five minutes for questions.<br/>
🎧 And is this one going to be assessed?<br/>
🎧 No, not this time round<br/>
🎧 because it's the first one… you know.<br/>
🎧 Oh, good news.<br/>
🎧 Well, Trevor, what are we going to include?<br/>
🎧 Well, do you think we ought to give some historical background?<br/>
🎧 Oh no, definitely not, we won't have time!<br/>
🎧 OK…<br/>
🎧 but I think we ought to say something about the geographical location<br/>
🎧 cos not a lot of people know where the islands are.<br/>
🎧 Yes, okay…<br/>
🎧 I'll take notes, shall I?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, that'll be a help.<br/>
🎧 So, geographical location…<br/>
🎧 Then we ought to give an overview of the whole education system.<br/>
🎧 Shouldn't we say something about the economy,<br/>
🎧 you know agricultural produce, minerals and so forth?<br/>
🎧 Well, Dr White said we shouldn't go into that sort of detail.<br/>
🎧 But it's pretty important when you think about it,<br/>
🎧 you know, because it does influence the education system.<br/>
🎧 Look, let's think about that one later shall we?<br/>
🎧 Let's see how we're doing for time.<br/>
🎧 Okay, so… general overview of education.<br/>
🎧 Of course… and then the role of English language.<br/>
🎧 Hmm... Nope, that goes in the Language Policy Seminar, don't you remember?<br/>
🎧 Are you sure?<br/>
🎧 Positive.<br/>
🎧 Alright.<br/>
🎧 so those are the topics we're going to be… to be covering.<br/>
🎧 We need to think about what to prepare…<br/>
🎧 Dr White said he wanted us to use plenty of visuals and things and...<br/>
🎧 we might as well try them out when we're not being assessed.<br/>
🎧 Well, the most important thing is the overhead projector.<br/>
🎧 No problem, we'll get that from the media room.<br/>
🎧 Must remember to book it.<br/>
🎧 Well… we'll need a map of course.<br/>
🎧 Probably two… one of the islands… large scale.<br/>
🎧 And one of West Africa.<br/>
🎧 Well, the West African one is no problem.<br/>
🎧 There's one in the Resources Room.<br/>
🎧 Oh yeah, of course, the resources room;<br/>
🎧 the islands are going to be more of a problem.<br/>
🎧 Tell you what, there's a very clear map of Santiago in that tourist brochure I showed you last week.<br/>
🎧 Don't you remember it?<br/>
🎧 Oh yeah, that's right;<br/>
🎧 we can just use the tourist brochure.<br/>
🎧 We also need statistics on several different things.<br/>
🎧 Literacy rates.<br/>
🎧 Yes, and school places.<br/>
🎧 How about the encyclopedia?<br/>
🎧 Nah… not up-to-date enough!<br/>
🎧 Mmm… why don't we call the embassy?<br/>
🎧 Oh… someone's enthusiastic!<br/>
🎧 Well… if something's worth doing…<br/>
🎧 I know… it's worth doing well… okay.<br/>
🎧 We can find out statistics on school places from them as well.<br/>
🎧 Might as well.<br/>
🎧 Look, Julie, it's almost time for our tutorials.<br/>
🎧 We can meet again on Monday<br/>
🎧 but we need to prepare...<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 In today's lecture, I'm going to talk about Monosodium Glutamate,<br/>
🎧 or MSG, as it's more commonly known.<br/>
🎧 Now, MSG as you probably know, is a flavour enhancer<br/>
🎧 which is used particularly in Chinese and Japanese cooking.<br/>
🎧 Today, I am going to explore why it is so popular in these cuisines<br/>
🎧 and, more importantly, how does it enhance the flavour of food?<br/>
🎧 The main reason why MSG is more commonly used in Japanese meals is tradition.<br/>
🎧 For many thousands of years,<br/>
🎧 the Japanese have incorporated a type of seaweed known as kombu in their cooking,<br/>
🎧 as they discovered it had the ability to make food taste better.<br/>
🎧 But it wasn't until 1908<br/>
🎧 that the ingredient in kombu, which was responsible for the improvement in flavour,<br/>
🎧 was actually discovered to be glutamate by scientists working there.<br/>
🎧 From 1908 until 1956,<br/>
🎧 glutamate was produced commercially in Japan<br/>
🎧 by a very slow and expensive means of extraction.<br/>
🎧 It was in 1956 that the speed of the process was improved,<br/>
🎧 and industrial production increased dramatically<br/>
🎧 and still continues to increase to this day.<br/>
🎧 In fact, hundreds of thousands of tonnes of MSG are produced all over the world today.<br/>
🎧 So what exactly is MSG?<br/>
🎧 Well, Monosodium Glutamate contains 78.2% glutamate,<br/>
🎧 12.2% sodium<br/>
🎧 and 9.6% water.<br/>
🎧 Glutamate is an amino acid that can be found naturally in all protein-containing foods,<br/>
🎧 erm, so this includes food such as meat and cheese.<br/>
🎧 It is widely known that Chinese and Japanese food contains MSG<br/>
🎧 but many people don't seem to be aware that it is also used in foods in other parts of the world.<br/>
🎧 For example, it is found in commercially made Italian pizzas,<br/>
🎧 in American fast food and in Britain, MSG is used in things like potato crisps.<br/>
🎧 So, how exactly does MSG work?<br/>
🎧 Well, in the Western world, we commonly talk of four 'tastes',<br/>
🎧 and I'm sure you're all familiar with the concepts of sweet, sour, bitter and salt.<br/>
🎧 Well, in 1908, Kikunae Ikeda identified a fifth 'taste'.<br/>
🎧 And it is thought that MSG intensifies this naturally occurring 'taste' in some food.<br/>
🎧 It does make perfect evolutionary sense that we should have the ability to detect or taste glutamate<br/>
🎧 because it is the amino acid which is most common in natural foods.<br/>
🎧 John Prescott, an associate professor at the University of Chicago,<br/>
🎧 suggests that this fifth taste serves a purpose just as the other tastes do.<br/>
🎧 He suggests that it signals to us the presence of protein in food,<br/>
🎧 in the same way that sweetness indicates that a food contains energy-giving carbohydrates.<br/>
🎧 Bitterness, he says, alerts us to toxins in the food,<br/>
🎧 while sourness warns us of spoilage<br/>
🎧 and saltiness signals the presence of minerals.<br/>
🎧 So, what else do we know about...<br/>
<br/><br/>
