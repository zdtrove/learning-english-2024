🎧 Hello, Picturerep</span>. Can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Oh, hi.<br/>
🎧 I saw your advertisement</span> about copying</span> pictures</span> to disk<br/></span>
🎧 and I'd like a bit more information</span> about what you do.<br/>
🎧 Sure. What would you like to know?<br/>
🎧 Well, I've got a box full of old family</span> photos</span> that's been up in the attic</span> for years,<br/>
🎧 some of them must be 50</span> or 60</span> years old,<br/>
🎧 and I'd like to get them converted</span> to digital</span> format</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sure, we can do that for you.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And what about size?<br/>
🎧 The photos</span> are all sorts</span> of sizes</span> -</span> are there any restrictions</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well the maximum</span> size of photo</span> we can do with our normal</span> service</span> is 30</span> centimetres</span>.<br/>
🎧 And each picture</span> must be at least</span> 4</span> centimetres</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's the minimum</span> we can cope</span> with.<br/>
🎧 That should be fine.<br/>
🎧 And some of them are in a frame</span>,<br/>
🎧 should I take them out before I send</span> them?<br/>
🎧 Yes please, we can't copy</span> them otherwise</span>.<br/>
🎧 And also the photos</span> must all be separate</span>,<br/>
🎧 they mustn't be stuck</span> into an album</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, that's not a problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 So can you give me an idea of how much this will cost</span>?<br/>
🎧 I've got about 360</span> photos</span> I think.<br/>
🎧 We charge</span> £195</span> for 300</span> to 400</span> photos</span> for the basic</span> service</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK. And does that include</span> the disk</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, one disk</span>.<br/>
🎧 But you can get extra</span> ones</span> for £5</span> each.<br/>
🎧 That's good.<br/>
🎧 So do I need to pay when I send</span> you the photos</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, we won't need anything until we've actually copied</span> the pictures</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then we'll let you know how much it is,<br/>
🎧 and once we've received</span> the payments</span>, we'll send</span> the parcel</span> off to you.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Is there anything else you'd like to ask about our services</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 I've roughly</span> sorted</span> out the photos</span> into groups</span>, according</span> to what they're about.<br/>
🎧 So can you keep them in those groups</span> when you copy</span> them?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 We'll save</span> each group in a different folder</span> on the disk</span> and if you like, you can suggest</span> a name for each folder</span>.<br/>
🎧 So I could have one called 'Grandparents'</span> for instance</span>?<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 And do you do anything besides</span> scan</span> the photos</span>?<br/>
🎧 Like, can you make any improvements</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, in the standard</span> service</span> each photo</span> is checked</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we can sometimes touch up the colour</span> a bit, or improve</span> the contrast</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 that can make a big difference</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And some of the photos</span> are actually quite fragile</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 they won't get damaged</span> in the process</span>, will they?<br/>
🎧 No, if any look particularly</span> fragile</span>, we'd do them by hand</span>.<br/>
🎧 We do realise</span> how precious</span> these old photos</span> can be.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 And another thing is we can make changes to a photo</span> if you want -<br/></span>
🎧 so if you want to remove</span> an object</span> from a photo</span>,<br/>
🎧 or maybe alter</span> the background</span>, we can do that.<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 I might be interested in that.<br/>
🎧 I'll have a look through the photos</span> and see.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and talking of fixing</span> photos</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 I've got a few that aren't properly</span> in focus.<br/>
🎧 Can you do anything to make that better?<br/>
🎧 No, I'm afraid</span> that's one thing we can't do.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Any other information</span> I can give you?<br/>
🎧 ...oh</span>, how long will it all take?<br/>
🎧 We aim</span> to get the copying</span> done in ten days</span>.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 Right, well I'll get the photos</span> packed</span> up in a box and post</span> them off to you.<br/>
🎧 Right. If you've got a strong</span> cardboard</span> box, that's best.<br/>
🎧 We've found</span> that plastic</span> ones</span> sometimes break</span> in the post</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Right, thanks for your help. Bye.<br/>
🎧 Bye.<br/>

🎧 Good morning and thank you for coming</span> here today.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to bring</span> you up to date with changes in the school that will affect</span> your children.<br/>
🎧 As you know, the school buildings</span> date from various</span> times</span>:<br/>
🎧 some from the 1970s</span>, some from the last five</span> years,<br/>
🎧 and of course Dartfield</span> House is over a century</span> old.<br/>
🎧 It was commissioned</span> by a businessman</span>.<br/>
🎧 Neville</span> Richards</span>, and intended</span> as his family</span> home,<br/>
🎧 but he died</span> before it was completed</span>.<br/>
🎧 His heir</span> chose</span> to sell it to the local</span> council</span>, who turned</span> it into offices</span>.<br/>
🎧 A later plan to convert</span> it into a tourist</span> information</span> centre</span> didn't come about, through lack</span> of money,<br/>
🎧 and instead</span> it formed</span> the nucleus</span> of this school when it opened</span> 40</span> years ago.<br/>
🎧 The school has grown</span> as the local</span> population</span> has increased</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I can now give you some news</span> about the lower</span> school site</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is separated</span> from the main</span> site</span> by a road</span>.<br/>
🎧 Planning permission</span> has been granted</span> for development</span> of both sites</span>.<br/>
🎧 The lower</span> school will move to new buildings</span> that will be constructed</span> on the main</span> site</span>.<br/>
🎧 Developers</span> will construct</span> houses</span> on the existing</span> lower</span> school site</span>.<br/>
🎧 Work on the new school buildings</span> should start within</span> the next few months</span>.<br/>
🎧 A more imminent</span> change concerns</span> the catering</span> facilities</span> and the canteen</span>.<br/>
🎧 The canteen</span> is always very busy</span> throughout</span> the lunch period</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 in fact</span> it's often full to capacity</span>,<br/>
🎧 because a lot of our pupils</span> like the food that's on offer</span> there.<br/>
🎧 But there's only one serving</span> point</span>,<br/>
🎧 so most pupils</span> have to wait a considerable</span> time to be served</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is obviously</span> unsatisfactory</span>,<br/>
🎧 as they may have hardly</span> finished</span> their lunch before afternoon</span> lessons</span> start.<br/>
🎧 So we've had a new Food Hall</span> built</span>,<br/>
🎧 and this will come into use next week.<br/>
🎧 It'll have several</span> serving</span> areas</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I'll give you more details</span> about those in a minute</span>,<br/>
🎧 but one thing we ask you to do, to help in the smooth</span> running</span> of the Food Hall</span>,<br/>
🎧 is to discuss</span> with your children each morning which type</span> of food they want to eat that day,<br/>
🎧 so they can go straight</span> to the relevant</span> serving</span> point</span>.<br/>
🎧 There won't be any junk</span> food -</span> everything on offer</span> will be healthy</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 and there's no change to the current</span> system</span> of paying</span> for lunches</span> by topping</span> up your child's</span> electronic</span> payment</span> card</span> online.<br/>
🎧 You may be wondering</span> what will happen</span> to the old canteen</span>.<br/>
🎧 We'll still have tables</span> and chairs</span> in there,<br/>
🎧 and pupils</span> can eat food from the Food Hall</span> or lunch they've</span> brought</span> from home.<br/>
🎧 Eventually</span> we may use part</span> of the canteen</span> for storage</span>,<br/>
🎧 but first we'll see how many pupils</span> go in there at lunchtime</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, back to the serving</span> points</span> in the Food Hall</span>,<br/>
🎧 which will all have side dishes</span>, desserts</span> and drinks</span> on sale</span>,<br/>
🎧 as well as main</span> courses</span>.<br/>
🎧 One serving</span> point</span> we call World</span> Adventures</span>.<br/>
🎧 This will serve</span> a different country's</span> cuisine</span> each day,<br/>
🎧 maybe Chinese</span> one day and Lebanese</span> the next.<br/>
🎧 The menus</span> will be planned</span> for a week at a time,<br/>
🎧 so pupils</span> will know what's going to be available</span> the whole of that week.<br/>
🎧 Street</span> Life is also international</span>, with food from three</span> particular</span> cultures</span>.<br/>
🎧 We'll ask pupils</span> to make suggestions</span>,<br/>
🎧 so perhaps</span> sometimes there'll</span> be food from Thailand</span>, Ethiopia</span> and Mexico</span>,<br/>
🎧 and then one of them will be replaced</span> by Jamaican</span> food for a week or two.<br/>
🎧 The Speedy</span> Italian</span> serving</span> point</span> will cater</span> particularly</span> for the many pupils</span> who don't eat meat</span> or fish</span>:<br/>
🎧 they can be sure that all the food served</span> there is suitable</span> for them.<br/>
🎧 There'll</span> be plenty</span> of variety</span>, so they shouldn't get bored</span> with the food.<br/>
🎧 OK, that's all on the new Food Hall</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now after-school</span> lessons</span>.<br/>
🎧 These are very popular</span> with pupils</span>, particularly</span> swimming</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 in fact</span> there's a waiting</span> list</span> for lessons</span>.<br/>
🎧 Cycling</span> is another favourite</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I'm delighted</span> that dozens</span> of pupils</span> make use of the chance</span> to learn to ride</span> in off-road</span> conditions</span>.<br/>
🎧 It means</span> that more and more cycle</span> to and from school every day.<br/>
🎧 As you know, we have a well-equipped</span> performance</span> centre</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we're going to start drama</span> classes</span> in there, too.<br/>
🎧 Pupils</span> will be able to join in just for fun or work up to taking part</span> in a play -<br/></span>
🎧 we hope to put on at least</span> one a year.<br/>
🎧 We already teach</span> a number of pupils</span> to use the sound and lighting</span> systems</span> in the centre</span>.<br/>
🎧 And a former</span> pupil</span> has given</span> a magnificent</span> grand</span> piano</span> to the school,<br/>
🎧 so a few pupils</span> will be able to learn at the school<br/></span>
🎧 instead</span> of going to the local</span> college</span>, as many of them do at the moment</span>.<br/>

🎧 So Luke</span>, for our next psychology</span> assignment</span> we have to do something on sleep</span> and dreams</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I've just read an article</span> suggesting</span> why we tend</span> to forget</span> most of our dreams</span> soon after we wake</span> up.<br/>
🎧 I mean, most of my dreams</span> aren't that interesting</span> anyway</span>,<br/>
🎧 but what it said was that if we remembered</span> everything,<br/>
🎧 we might get mixed</span> up about what actually happened</span> and what we dreamed</span>.<br/>
🎧 So it's a sort</span> of protection</span>.<br/>
🎧 I hadn't heard that idea before.<br/>
🎧 I'd always assumed</span> that it was just that we didn't have room in our memories</span> for all that stuff</span>.<br/>
🎧 Me too.<br/>
🎧 What do you think about the idea that our dreams</span> may predict</span> the future?<br/>
🎧 It's a belief</span> that you get all over the world</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, lots of people have a story</span> of it happening</span> to them,<br/>
🎧 but the explanation</span> I've read is that for each dream</span> that comes true</span>,<br/>
🎧 we have thousands</span> that don't, but we don't notice</span> those,<br/>
🎧 we don't even remember them.<br/>
🎧 We just remember the ones</span> where something in the real</span> world</span>,<br/>
🎧 like a view</span> or an action</span>, happens</span> to trigger</span> a dream</span> memory</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So it's just a coincidence</span> really.<br/>
🎧 Something else I read about is what they call segmented</span> sleeping</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's a theory</span> that hundreds</span> of years ago,<br/>
🎧 people used to get up in the middle</span> of the night</span> and have a chat</span> or something to eat,<br/>
🎧 then go back to bed.<br/>
🎧 So I tried</span> it myself.<br/>
🎧 Why?<br/>
🎧 Well it's meant</span> to make you more creative</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't know why.<br/>
🎧 But I gave it up after a week.<br/>
🎧 It just didn't fit in with my lifestyle</span>.<br/>
🎧 But most pre-school</span> children have a short sleep</span> in the day don't they?<br/>
🎧 There was an experiment</span> some students did here last term</span> to see at what age kids</span> should stop</span> having naps</span>.<br/>
🎧 But they didn't really find an answer.<br/>
🎧 They spent</span> a lot of time working out the most appropriate</span> methodology</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the results</span> didn't seem</span> to show any obvious</span> patterns</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Anyway</span>, let's think about our assignment</span>.<br/>
🎧 Last time I had problems</span> with the final</span> stage</span>,<br/>
🎧 where we had to describe</span> and justify</span> how successful</span> we thought we'd been.<br/>
🎧 I struggled</span> a bit with the action</span> plan too.<br/>
🎧 I was OK with the planning,<br/>
🎧 but I got marked</span> down for the self-assessment</span> as well.<br/>
🎧 And I had big problems</span> with the statistical</span> stuff</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's where I really lost</span> marks</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So shall we plan what we have to do for this assignment</span>?<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 First, we have to decide on our research</span> question</span>.<br/>
🎧 So how about 'Is</span> there a relationship</span> between hours of sleep</span> and number of dreams?'<br/></span>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Then we need to think about who we'll do the study</span> on.<br/>
🎧 About 12</span> people?<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And shall we use other psychology</span> students?<br/>
🎧 Let's use people from a different department</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about history</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, they might have interesting</span> dreams</span>!<br/>
🎧 Or literature</span> students?<br/>
🎧 I don't really know any.<br/>
🎧 OK, forget</span> that idea.<br/>
🎧 Then we have to think about our methodology</span>.<br/>
🎧 So we could use observation</span>,<br/>
🎧 but that doesn't seem</span> appropriate</span>.<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 it needs to be self-reporting</span> I think.<br/>
🎧 And we could ask them to answer questions</span> online.<br/>
🎧 But in this case, paper</span> might be better<br/></span>
🎧 as they'll be doing it straight</span> after they wake</span> up..</span>.<br/>
🎧 in fact</span> while they're still half-asleep</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And we'll have to check the ethical</span> guidelines</span> for this sort</span> of research</span>.<br/>
🎧 Because our experiment</span> involves</span> humans</span>, so there are special regulations</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes,<br/>
🎧 I had a look at those for another assignment</span> I did.<br/>
🎧 There's a whole section</span> on risk</span> assessment</span>,<br/>
🎧 and another section</span> on making</span> sure they aren't put under any unnecessary</span> stress</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's hope they don't have any bad dreams</span>!<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 Then when we've collected</span> all our data</span> we have to analyse</span> it<br/></span>
🎧 and calculate</span> the correlation</span> between our two variables</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's time sleeping</span> and number of dreams<br/></span>
🎧 and then present</span> our results</span> visually</span> in a graph</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right. And the final</span> thing is to think about our research</span> and evaluate</span> it.<br/>
🎧 So that seems</span> quite straightforward</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. So now let's..</span>.<br/>

🎧 Dancing</span> is something that humans</span> do when they want to have a good time.<br/>
🎧 It's a universal</span> response</span> to music, found</span> in all cultures</span>.<br/>
🎧 But what's only been discovered</span> recently</span> is that dancing</span> not only makes us feel good,<br/>
🎧 it's also extremely</span> good for our health</span>.<br/>
🎧 Dancing</span>, like other forms</span> of exercise</span>, releases</span> hormones</span>, such as dopamine</span>,<br/>
🎧 which make us feel relaxed</span> and happy.<br/>
🎧 And it also reduces</span> feelings</span> of stress</span> or anxiety</span>.<br/>
🎧 Dancing</span> is also a sociable</span> activity</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is another reason</span> it makes us feel good.<br/>
🎧 One study</span> compared</span> people's</span> enjoyment</span> of dancing</span> at home in front</span> of a video</span> with dancing</span> in a group in a studio</span>.<br/>
🎧 The people dancing</span> in a group reported</span> feeling happier</span>,<br/>
🎧 whereas</span> those dancing</span> alone</span> did not.<br/>
🎧 In another experiment</span>, university researchers</span> at York</span> and Sheffield<br/></span>
🎧 took a group of students and sent</span> each of them into a lab</span> where music was played</span> for five</span> minutes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Each had to choose from three</span> options:<br/>
🎧 to sit and listen quietly</span> to the music,<br/>
🎧 to cycle</span> on an exercise</span> bike</span> while they listened</span>,<br/>
🎧 or to get up and dance</span>.<br/>
🎧 All were given</span> cognitive</span> tasks</span> to perform</span> before and after.<br/>
🎧 The result</span> showed</span> that those who chose</span> to dance</span> showed</span> much more creativity</span> when doing problem-solving</span> tasks</span>.<br/>
🎧 Doctor</span> Lovatt</span> at the University of Hertfordshire<br/></span>
🎧 believes</span> dance</span> could be a very useful</span> way to help people suffering</span> from mental</span> health</span> problems</span>.<br/>
🎧 He thinks</span> dance</span> should be prescribed</span> as therapy<br/></span>
🎧 to help people overcome</span> issues such as depression</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's well established</span> that dance</span> is a good way of encouraging</span> adolescent</span> girls to take exercise<br/></span>
🎧 but what about older</span> people?<br/>
🎧 Studies</span> have shown</span> that there are enormous</span> benefits</span> for people in their 60s</span> and beyond</span>.<br/>
🎧 One of the great things about dance</span> is that there are no barriers</span> to participation</span>.<br/>
🎧 Anyone</span> can have a go,<br/>
🎧 even those whose standard</span> of fitness</span> is quite low.<br/>
🎧 Dance</span> can be especially</span> beneficial</span> for older</span> adults<br/></span>
🎧 who can't run or do more intense</span> workouts</span>,<br/>
🎧 or for those who don't want to.<br/>
🎧 One 2015</span> study</span> found</span> that even a gentle</span> dance</span> workout</span> helps to promote</span> a healthy</span> heart</span>.<br/>
🎧 And there's plenty</span> of evidence</span> which suggests</span> that dancing</span> lowers</span> the risk</span> of falls</span>,<br/>
🎧 which could result</span> in a broken</span> hip</span>, for example, by helping</span> people to improve</span> their balance</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are some less obvious</span> benefits</span> of dance</span> for older</span> people too.<br/>
🎧 One thing I hadn't realised</span> before researching</span> this topic<br/></span>
🎧 was that dance</span> isn't just a physical</span> challenge</span>.<br/>
🎧 It also requires</span> a lot of concentration<br/></span>
🎧 because you need to remember different steps</span> and routines</span>.<br/>
🎧 For older</span> people, this kind of activity</span> is especially</span> important<br/></span>
🎧 because it forces</span> their brain</span> to process</span> things more quickly<br/></span>
🎧 and to retain</span> more information</span>.<br/>
🎧 Current</span> research</span> also shows</span> that dance</span> promotes</span> a general</span> sense</span> of well-being</span> in older</span> participants</span>,<br/>
🎧 which can last up to a week after a class.<br/>
🎧 Participants</span> report</span> feeling less tired</span> and having greater</span> motivation</span> to be more active<br/></span>
🎧 and do daily</span> activities</span> such as gardening</span> or walking</span> to the shops</span> or a park</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ballroom</span> or country</span> dancing</span>, both popular</span> with older</span> people, have to be done in groups</span>.<br/>
🎧 They require</span> collaboration</span> and often involve</span> touching</span> a dance</span> partner</span>,<br/>
🎧 all of which encourages</span> interaction</span> on the dance</span> floor</span>.<br/>
🎧 This helps to develop</span> new relationships<br/></span>
🎧 and can reduce</span> older</span> people's</span> sense</span> of isolation</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is a huge</span> problem</span> in many countries</span>.<br/>
🎧 I also looked</span> at the benefits</span> of Zumba</span>.<br/>
🎧 Fifteen</span> million</span> people in 180</span> countries</span> now regularly</span> take a Zumba</span> class,<br/>
🎧 an aerobic</span> workout</span> based</span> on Latin</span> American</span> dance</span> moves</span>.<br/>
🎧 John</span> Porcari</span>, a professor</span> of exercise</span> and sport</span> science</span> at the University of Wisconsin</span>,<br/>
🎧 analysed</span> a group of women</span> who were Zumba</span> regulars<br/></span>
🎧 and found</span> that a class lasting</span> 40</span> minutes</span> burns</span> about 370</span> calories</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is similar</span> to moderately</span> intense</span> exercises</span> like step</span> aerobics</span> or kickboxing</span>.<br/>
🎧 A study</span> in the American</span> Journal</span> of Health</span> Behavior<br/></span>
🎧 showed</span> that when women</span> with obesity</span> did Zumba</span> three</span> times</span> a week for 16</span> weeks</span>,<br/>
🎧 they lost</span> an average</span> of 1.2</span> kilos<br/></span>
🎧 and lowered</span> their percentage</span> of body</span> fat by 1%</span>.<br/>
🎧 More importantly</span>, the women</span> enjoyed</span> the class so much<br/></span>
🎧 that they made it a habit</span> and continued</span> to attend</span> classes</span> at least</span> once a week -<br/></span>
🎧 very unusual</span> for an aerobic</span> exercise</span> programme</span>.<br/>
🎧 Dance</span> is never going to compete</span> with high-intensity</span> workouts<br/></span>
🎧 when it comes to physical</span> fitness</span> gains</span>,<br/>
🎧 but its popularity</span> is likely</span> to keep on rising<br/></span>
🎧 because it's such a fun way to keep fit.<br/>
