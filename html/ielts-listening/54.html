🎧 Hello, Picturerep. Can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Oh, hi.<br/>
🎧 I saw your advertisement about copying pictures to disk<br/>
🎧 and I'd like a bit more information about what you do.<br/>
🎧 Sure. What would you like to know?<br/>
🎧 Well, I've got a box full of old family photos that's been up in the attic for years,<br/>
🎧 some of them must be 50 or 60 years old,<br/>
🎧 and I'd like to get them converted to digital format.<br/>
🎧 Sure, we can do that for you.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And what about size?<br/>
🎧 The photos are all sorts of sizes - are there any restrictions?<br/>
🎧 Well the maximum size of photo we can do with our normal service is 30 centimetres.<br/>
🎧 And each picture must be at least 4 centimetres,<br/>
🎧 that's the minimum we can cope with.<br/>
🎧 That should be fine.<br/>
🎧 And some of them are in a frame,<br/>
🎧 should I take them out before I send them?<br/>
🎧 Yes please, we can't copy them otherwise.<br/>
🎧 And also the photos must all be separate,<br/>
🎧 they mustn't be stuck into an album.<br/>
🎧 OK, that's not a problem.<br/>
🎧 So can you give me an idea of how much this will cost?<br/>
🎧 I've got about 360 photos I think.<br/>
🎧 We charge £195 for 300 to 400 photos for the basic service.<br/>
🎧 OK. And does that include the disk?<br/>
🎧 Yes, one disk.<br/>
🎧 But you can get extra ones for £5 each.<br/>
🎧 That's good.<br/>
🎧 So do I need to pay when I send you the photos?<br/>
🎧 No, we won't need anything until we've actually copied the pictures.<br/>
🎧 Then we'll let you know how much it is,<br/>
🎧 and once we've received the payments, we'll send the parcel off to you.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Is there anything else you'd like to ask about our services?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 I've roughly sorted out the photos into groups, according to what they're about.<br/>
🎧 So can you keep them in those groups when you copy them?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 We'll save each group in a different folder on the disk and if you like, you can suggest a name for each folder.<br/>
🎧 So I could have one called 'Grandparents' for instance?<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 And do you do anything besides scan the photos?<br/>
🎧 Like, can you make any improvements?<br/>
🎧 Yes, in the standard service each photo is checked,<br/>
🎧 and we can sometimes touch up the colour a bit, or improve the contrast -<br/>
🎧 that can make a big difference.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And some of the photos are actually quite fragile -<br/>
🎧 they won't get damaged in the process, will they?<br/>
🎧 No, if any look particularly fragile, we'd do them by hand.<br/>
🎧 We do realise how precious these old photos can be.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 And another thing is we can make changes to a photo if you want -<br/>
🎧 so if you want to remove an object from a photo,<br/>
🎧 or maybe alter the background, we can do that.<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 I might be interested in that.<br/>
🎧 I'll have a look through the photos and see.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and talking of fixing photos -<br/>
🎧 I've got a few that aren't properly in focus.<br/>
🎧 Can you do anything to make that better?<br/>
🎧 No, I'm afraid that's one thing we can't do.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Any other information I can give you?<br/>
🎧 ...oh, how long will it all take?<br/>
🎧 We aim to get the copying done in ten days.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 Right, well I'll get the photos packed up in a box and post them off to you.<br/>
🎧 Right. If you've got a strong cardboard box, that's best.<br/>
🎧 We've found that plastic ones sometimes break in the post.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Right, thanks for your help. Bye.<br/>
🎧 Bye.<br/>

🎧 Good morning and thank you for coming here today.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to bring you up to date with changes in the school that will affect your children.<br/>
🎧 As you know, the school buildings date from various times:<br/>
🎧 some from the 1970s, some from the last five years,<br/>
🎧 and of course Dartfield House is over a century old.<br/>
🎧 It was commissioned by a businessman.<br/>
🎧 Neville Richards, and intended as his family home,<br/>
🎧 but he died before it was completed.<br/>
🎧 His heir chose to sell it to the local council, who turned it into offices.<br/>
🎧 A later plan to convert it into a tourist information centre didn't come about, through lack of money,<br/>
🎧 and instead it formed the nucleus of this school when it opened 40 years ago.<br/>
🎧 The school has grown as the local population has increased,<br/>
🎧 and I can now give you some news about the lower school site,<br/>
🎧 which is separated from the main site by a road.<br/>
🎧 Planning permission has been granted for development of both sites.<br/>
🎧 The lower school will move to new buildings that will be constructed on the main site.<br/>
🎧 Developers will construct houses on the existing lower school site.<br/>
🎧 Work on the new school buildings should start within the next few months.<br/>
🎧 A more imminent change concerns the catering facilities and the canteen.<br/>
🎧 The canteen is always very busy throughout the lunch period -<br/>
🎧 in fact it's often full to capacity,<br/>
🎧 because a lot of our pupils like the food that's on offer there.<br/>
🎧 But there's only one serving point,<br/>
🎧 so most pupils have to wait a considerable time to be served.<br/>
🎧 This is obviously unsatisfactory,<br/>
🎧 as they may have hardly finished their lunch before afternoon lessons start.<br/>
🎧 So we've had a new Food Hall built,<br/>
🎧 and this will come into use next week.<br/>
🎧 It'll have several serving areas,<br/>
🎧 and I'll give you more details about those in a minute,<br/>
🎧 but one thing we ask you to do, to help in the smooth running of the Food Hall,<br/>
🎧 is to discuss with your children each morning which type of food they want to eat that day,<br/>
🎧 so they can go straight to the relevant serving point.<br/>
🎧 There won't be any junk food - everything on offer will be healthy -<br/>
🎧 and there's no change to the current system of paying for lunches by topping up your child's electronic payment card online.<br/>
🎧 You may be wondering what will happen to the old canteen.<br/>
🎧 We'll still have tables and chairs in there,<br/>
🎧 and pupils can eat food from the Food Hall or lunch they've brought from home.<br/>
🎧 Eventually we may use part of the canteen for storage,<br/>
🎧 but first we'll see how many pupils go in there at lunchtime.<br/>
🎧 OK, back to the serving points in the Food Hall,<br/>
🎧 which will all have side dishes, desserts and drinks on sale,<br/>
🎧 as well as main courses.<br/>
🎧 One serving point we call World Adventures.<br/>
🎧 This will serve a different country's cuisine each day,<br/>
🎧 maybe Chinese one day and Lebanese the next.<br/>
🎧 The menus will be planned for a week at a time,<br/>
🎧 so pupils will know what's going to be available the whole of that week.<br/>
🎧 Street Life is also international, with food from three particular cultures.<br/>
🎧 We'll ask pupils to make suggestions,<br/>
🎧 so perhaps sometimes there'll be food from Thailand, Ethiopia and Mexico,<br/>
🎧 and then one of them will be replaced by Jamaican food for a week or two.<br/>
🎧 The Speedy Italian serving point will cater particularly for the many pupils who don't eat meat or fish:<br/>
🎧 they can be sure that all the food served there is suitable for them.<br/>
🎧 There'll be plenty of variety, so they shouldn't get bored with the food.<br/>
🎧 OK, that's all on the new Food Hall.<br/>
🎧 Now after-school lessons.<br/>
🎧 These are very popular with pupils, particularly swimming -<br/>
🎧 in fact there's a waiting list for lessons.<br/>
🎧 Cycling is another favourite,<br/>
🎧 and I'm delighted that dozens of pupils make use of the chance to learn to ride in off-road conditions.<br/>
🎧 It means that more and more cycle to and from school every day.<br/>
🎧 As you know, we have a well-equipped performance centre,<br/>
🎧 and we're going to start drama classes in there, too.<br/>
🎧 Pupils will be able to join in just for fun or work up to taking part in a play -<br/>
🎧 we hope to put on at least one a year.<br/>
🎧 We already teach a number of pupils to use the sound and lighting systems in the centre.<br/>
🎧 And a former pupil has given a magnificent grand piano to the school,<br/>
🎧 so a few pupils will be able to learn at the school<br/>
🎧 instead of going to the local college, as many of them do at the moment.<br/>

🎧 So Luke, for our next psychology assignment we have to do something on sleep and dreams.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I've just read an article suggesting why we tend to forget most of our dreams soon after we wake up.<br/>
🎧 I mean, most of my dreams aren't that interesting anyway,<br/>
🎧 but what it said was that if we remembered everything,<br/>
🎧 we might get mixed up about what actually happened and what we dreamed.<br/>
🎧 So it's a sort of protection.<br/>
🎧 I hadn't heard that idea before.<br/>
🎧 I'd always assumed that it was just that we didn't have room in our memories for all that stuff.<br/>
🎧 Me too.<br/>
🎧 What do you think about the idea that our dreams may predict the future?<br/>
🎧 It's a belief that you get all over the world.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, lots of people have a story of it happening to them,<br/>
🎧 but the explanation I've read is that for each dream that comes true,<br/>
🎧 we have thousands that don't, but we don't notice those,<br/>
🎧 we don't even remember them.<br/>
🎧 We just remember the ones where something in the real world,<br/>
🎧 like a view or an action, happens to trigger a dream memory.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So it's just a coincidence really.<br/>
🎧 Something else I read about is what they call segmented sleeping.<br/>
🎧 That's a theory that hundreds of years ago,<br/>
🎧 people used to get up in the middle of the night and have a chat or something to eat,<br/>
🎧 then go back to bed.<br/>
🎧 So I tried it myself.<br/>
🎧 Why?<br/>
🎧 Well it's meant to make you more creative.<br/>
🎧 I don't know why.<br/>
🎧 But I gave it up after a week.<br/>
🎧 It just didn't fit in with my lifestyle.<br/>
🎧 But most pre-school children have a short sleep in the day don't they?<br/>
🎧 There was an experiment some students did here last term to see at what age kids should stop having naps.<br/>
🎧 But they didn't really find an answer.<br/>
🎧 They spent a lot of time working out the most appropriate methodology,<br/>
🎧 but the results didn't seem to show any obvious patterns.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Anyway, let's think about our assignment.<br/>
🎧 Last time I had problems with the final stage,<br/>
🎧 where we had to describe and justify how successful we thought we'd been.<br/>
🎧 I struggled a bit with the action plan too.<br/>
🎧 I was OK with the planning,<br/>
🎧 but I got marked down for the self-assessment as well.<br/>
🎧 And I had big problems with the statistical stuff,<br/>
🎧 that's where I really lost marks.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So shall we plan what we have to do for this assignment?<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 First, we have to decide on our research question.<br/>
🎧 So how about 'Is there a relationship between hours of sleep and number of dreams?'<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Then we need to think about who we'll do the study on.<br/>
🎧 About 12 people?<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And shall we use other psychology students?<br/>
🎧 Let's use people from a different department.<br/>
🎧 What about history?<br/>
🎧 Yes, they might have interesting dreams!<br/>
🎧 Or literature students?<br/>
🎧 I don't really know any.<br/>
🎧 OK, forget that idea.<br/>
🎧 Then we have to think about our methodology.<br/>
🎧 So we could use observation,<br/>
🎧 but that doesn't seem appropriate.<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 it needs to be self-reporting I think.<br/>
🎧 And we could ask them to answer questions online.<br/>
🎧 But in this case, paper might be better<br/>
🎧 as they'll be doing it straight after they wake up...<br/>
🎧 in fact while they're still half-asleep.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And we'll have to check the ethical guidelines for this sort of research.<br/>
🎧 Because our experiment involves humans, so there are special regulations.<br/>
🎧 Yes,<br/>
🎧 I had a look at those for another assignment I did.<br/>
🎧 There's a whole section on risk assessment,<br/>
🎧 and another section on making sure they aren't put under any unnecessary stress.<br/>
🎧 Let's hope they don't have any bad dreams!<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 Then when we've collected all our data we have to analyse it<br/>
🎧 and calculate the correlation between our two variables,<br/>
🎧 that's time sleeping and number of dreams<br/>
🎧 and then present our results visually in a graph.<br/>
🎧 Right. And the final thing is to think about our research and evaluate it.<br/>
🎧 So that seems quite straightforward.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. So now let's...<br/>

🎧 Dancing is something that humans do when they want to have a good time.<br/>
🎧 It's a universal response to music, found in all cultures.<br/>
🎧 But what's only been discovered recently is that dancing not only makes us feel good,<br/>
🎧 it's also extremely good for our health.<br/>
🎧 Dancing, like other forms of exercise, releases hormones, such as dopamine,<br/>
🎧 which make us feel relaxed and happy.<br/>
🎧 And it also reduces feelings of stress or anxiety.<br/>
🎧 Dancing is also a sociable activity,<br/>
🎧 which is another reason it makes us feel good.<br/>
🎧 One study compared people's enjoyment of dancing at home in front of a video with dancing in a group in a studio.<br/>
🎧 The people dancing in a group reported feeling happier,<br/>
🎧 whereas those dancing alone did not.<br/>
🎧 In another experiment, university researchers at York and Sheffield<br/>
🎧 took a group of students and sent each of them into a lab where music was played for five minutes.<br/>
🎧 Each had to choose from three options:<br/>
🎧 to sit and listen quietly to the music,<br/>
🎧 to cycle on an exercise bike while they listened,<br/>
🎧 or to get up and dance.<br/>
🎧 All were given cognitive tasks to perform before and after.<br/>
🎧 The result showed that those who chose to dance showed much more creativity when doing problem-solving tasks.<br/>
🎧 Doctor Lovatt at the University of Hertfordshire<br/>
🎧 believes dance could be a very useful way to help people suffering from mental health problems.<br/>
🎧 He thinks dance should be prescribed as therapy<br/>
🎧 to help people overcome issues such as depression.<br/>
🎧 It's well established that dance is a good way of encouraging adolescent girls to take exercise<br/>
🎧 but what about older people?<br/>
🎧 Studies have shown that there are enormous benefits for people in their 60s and beyond.<br/>
🎧 One of the great things about dance is that there are no barriers to participation.<br/>
🎧 Anyone can have a go,<br/>
🎧 even those whose standard of fitness is quite low.<br/>
🎧 Dance can be especially beneficial for older adults<br/>
🎧 who can't run or do more intense workouts,<br/>
🎧 or for those who don't want to.<br/>
🎧 One 2015 study found that even a gentle dance workout helps to promote a healthy heart.<br/>
🎧 And there's plenty of evidence which suggests that dancing lowers the risk of falls,<br/>
🎧 which could result in a broken hip, for example, by helping people to improve their balance.<br/>
🎧 There are some less obvious benefits of dance for older people too.<br/>
🎧 One thing I hadn't realised before researching this topic<br/>
🎧 was that dance isn't just a physical challenge.<br/>
🎧 It also requires a lot of concentration<br/>
🎧 because you need to remember different steps and routines.<br/>
🎧 For older people, this kind of activity is especially important<br/>
🎧 because it forces their brain to process things more quickly<br/>
🎧 and to retain more information.<br/>
🎧 Current research also shows that dance promotes a general sense of well-being in older participants,<br/>
🎧 which can last up to a week after a class.<br/>
🎧 Participants report feeling less tired and having greater motivation to be more active<br/>
🎧 and do daily activities such as gardening or walking to the shops or a park.<br/>
🎧 Ballroom or country dancing, both popular with older people, have to be done in groups.<br/>
🎧 They require collaboration and often involve touching a dance partner,<br/>
🎧 all of which encourages interaction on the dance floor.<br/>
🎧 This helps to develop new relationships<br/>
🎧 and can reduce older people's sense of isolation,<br/>
🎧 which is a huge problem in many countries.<br/>
🎧 I also looked at the benefits of Zumba.<br/>
🎧 Fifteen million people in 180 countries now regularly take a Zumba class,<br/>
🎧 an aerobic workout based on Latin American dance moves.<br/>
🎧 John Porcari, a professor of exercise and sport science at the University of Wisconsin,<br/>
🎧 analysed a group of women who were Zumba regulars<br/>
🎧 and found that a class lasting 40 minutes burns about 370 calories.<br/>
🎧 This is similar to moderately intense exercises like step aerobics or kickboxing.<br/>
🎧 A study in the American Journal of Health Behavior<br/>
🎧 showed that when women with obesity did Zumba three times a week for 16 weeks,<br/>
🎧 they lost an average of 1.2 kilos<br/>
🎧 and lowered their percentage of body fat by 1%.<br/>
🎧 More importantly, the women enjoyed the class so much<br/>
🎧 that they made it a habit and continued to attend classes at least once a week -<br/>
🎧 very unusual for an aerobic exercise programme.<br/>
🎧 Dance is never going to compete with high-intensity workouts<br/>
🎧 when it comes to physical fitness gains,<br/>
🎧 but its popularity is likely to keep on rising<br/>
🎧 because it's such a fun way to keep fit.<br/>
<br/><br/>
