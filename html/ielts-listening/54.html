🎧 Hello, <span>Picturerep</span>. Can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Oh, hi.<br/>
🎧 I saw your <span>advertisement</span> about <span>copying</span> <span>pictures</span> to <span>disk<br/></span>
🎧 and I'd like a bit more <span>information</span> about what you do.<br/>
🎧 Sure. What would you like to know?<br/>
🎧 Well, I've got a box full of old <span>family</span> <span>photos</span> that's been up in the <span>attic</span> for years,<br/>
🎧 some of them must be <span>50</span> or <span>60</span> years old,<br/>
🎧 and I'd like to get them <span>converted</span> to <span>digital</span> <span>format</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sure, we can do that for you.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And what about size?<br/>
🎧 The <span>photos</span> are all <span>sorts</span> of <span>sizes</span> <span>-</span> are there any <span>restrictions</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well the <span>maximum</span> size of <span>photo</span> we can do with our <span>normal</span> <span>service</span> is <span>30</span> <span>centimetres</span>.<br/>
🎧 And each <span>picture</span> must be at <span>least</span> <span>4</span> <span>centimetres</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's the <span>minimum</span> we can <span>cope</span> with.<br/>
🎧 That should be fine.<br/>
🎧 And some of them are in a <span>frame</span>,<br/>
🎧 should I take them out before I <span>send</span> them?<br/>
🎧 Yes please, we can't <span>copy</span> them <span>otherwise</span>.<br/>
🎧 And also the <span>photos</span> must all be <span>separate</span>,<br/>
🎧 they mustn't be <span>stuck</span> into an <span>album</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, that's not a <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 So can you give me an idea of how much this will <span>cost</span>?<br/>
🎧 I've got about <span>360</span> <span>photos</span> I think.<br/>
🎧 We <span>charge</span> <span>£195</span> for <span>300</span> to <span>400</span> <span>photos</span> for the <span>basic</span> <span>service</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK. And does that <span>include</span> the <span>disk</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, one <span>disk</span>.<br/>
🎧 But you can get <span>extra</span> <span>ones</span> for <span>£5</span> each.<br/>
🎧 That's good.<br/>
🎧 So do I need to pay when I <span>send</span> you the <span>photos</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, we won't need anything until we've actually <span>copied</span> the <span>pictures</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then we'll let you know how much it is,<br/>
🎧 and once we've <span>received</span> the <span>payments</span>, we'll <span>send</span> the <span>parcel</span> off to you.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Is there anything else you'd like to ask about our <span>services</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 I've <span>roughly</span> <span>sorted</span> out the <span>photos</span> into <span>groups</span>, <span>according</span> to what they're about.<br/>
🎧 So can you keep them in those <span>groups</span> when you <span>copy</span> them?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 We'll <span>save</span> each group in a different <span>folder</span> on the <span>disk</span> and if you like, you can <span>suggest</span> a name for each <span>folder</span>.<br/>
🎧 So I could have one called <span>'Grandparents'</span> for <span>instance</span>?<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 And do you do anything <span>besides</span> <span>scan</span> the <span>photos</span>?<br/>
🎧 Like, can you make any <span>improvements</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, in the <span>standard</span> <span>service</span> each <span>photo</span> is <span>checked</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we can sometimes touch up the <span>colour</span> a bit, or <span>improve</span> the <span>contrast</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 that can make a big <span>difference</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And some of the <span>photos</span> are actually quite <span>fragile</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 they won't get <span>damaged</span> in the <span>process</span>, will they?<br/>
🎧 No, if any look <span>particularly</span> <span>fragile</span>, we'd do them by <span>hand</span>.<br/>
🎧 We do <span>realise</span> how <span>precious</span> these old <span>photos</span> can be.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 And another thing is we can make changes to a <span>photo</span> if you want <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 so if you want to <span>remove</span> an <span>object</span> from a <span>photo</span>,<br/>
🎧 or maybe <span>alter</span> the <span>background</span>, we can do that.<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 I might be interested in that.<br/>
🎧 I'll have a look through the <span>photos</span> and see.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and talking of <span>fixing</span> <span>photos</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 I've got a few that aren't <span>properly</span> in focus.<br/>
🎧 Can you do anything to make that better?<br/>
🎧 No, I'm <span>afraid</span> that's one thing we can't do.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Any other <span>information</span> I can give you?<br/>
🎧 <span>...oh</span>, how long will it all take?<br/>
🎧 We <span>aim</span> to get the <span>copying</span> done in ten <span>days</span>.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 Right, well I'll get the <span>photos</span> <span>packed</span> up in a box and <span>post</span> them off to you.<br/>
🎧 Right. If you've got a <span>strong</span> <span>cardboard</span> box, that's best.<br/>
🎧 We've <span>found</span> that <span>plastic</span> <span>ones</span> sometimes <span>break</span> in the <span>post</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Right, thanks for your help. Bye.<br/>
🎧 Bye.<br/>

🎧 Good morning and thank you for <span>coming</span> here today.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to <span>bring</span> you up to date with changes in the school that will <span>affect</span> your children.<br/>
🎧 As you know, the school <span>buildings</span> date from <span>various</span> <span>times</span>:<br/>
🎧 some from the <span>1970s</span>, some from the last <span>five</span> years,<br/>
🎧 and of course <span>Dartfield</span> House is over a <span>century</span> old.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>commissioned</span> by a <span>businessman</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Neville</span> <span>Richards</span>, and <span>intended</span> as his <span>family</span> home,<br/>
🎧 but he <span>died</span> before it was <span>completed</span>.<br/>
🎧 His <span>heir</span> <span>chose</span> to sell it to the <span>local</span> <span>council</span>, who <span>turned</span> it into <span>offices</span>.<br/>
🎧 A later plan to <span>convert</span> it into a <span>tourist</span> <span>information</span> <span>centre</span> didn't come about, through <span>lack</span> of money,<br/>
🎧 and <span>instead</span> it <span>formed</span> the <span>nucleus</span> of this school when it <span>opened</span> <span>40</span> years ago.<br/>
🎧 The school has <span>grown</span> as the <span>local</span> <span>population</span> has <span>increased</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I can now give you some <span>news</span> about the <span>lower</span> school <span>site</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is <span>separated</span> from the <span>main</span> <span>site</span> by a <span>road</span>.<br/>
🎧 Planning <span>permission</span> has been <span>granted</span> for <span>development</span> of both <span>sites</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>lower</span> school will move to new <span>buildings</span> that will be <span>constructed</span> on the <span>main</span> <span>site</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Developers</span> will <span>construct</span> <span>houses</span> on the <span>existing</span> <span>lower</span> school <span>site</span>.<br/>
🎧 Work on the new school <span>buildings</span> should start <span>within</span> the next few <span>months</span>.<br/>
🎧 A more <span>imminent</span> change <span>concerns</span> the <span>catering</span> <span>facilities</span> and the <span>canteen</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>canteen</span> is always very <span>busy</span> <span>throughout</span> the lunch <span>period</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 in <span>fact</span> it's often full to <span>capacity</span>,<br/>
🎧 because a lot of our <span>pupils</span> like the food that's on <span>offer</span> there.<br/>
🎧 But there's only one <span>serving</span> <span>point</span>,<br/>
🎧 so most <span>pupils</span> have to wait a <span>considerable</span> time to be <span>served</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is <span>obviously</span> <span>unsatisfactory</span>,<br/>
🎧 as they may have <span>hardly</span> <span>finished</span> their lunch before <span>afternoon</span> <span>lessons</span> start.<br/>
🎧 So we've had a new Food <span>Hall</span> <span>built</span>,<br/>
🎧 and this will come into use next week.<br/>
🎧 It'll have <span>several</span> <span>serving</span> <span>areas</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I'll give you more <span>details</span> about those in a <span>minute</span>,<br/>
🎧 but one thing we ask you to do, to help in the <span>smooth</span> <span>running</span> of the Food <span>Hall</span>,<br/>
🎧 is to <span>discuss</span> with your children each morning which <span>type</span> of food they want to eat that day,<br/>
🎧 so they can go <span>straight</span> to the <span>relevant</span> <span>serving</span> <span>point</span>.<br/>
🎧 There won't be any <span>junk</span> food <span>-</span> everything on <span>offer</span> will be <span>healthy</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and there's no change to the <span>current</span> <span>system</span> of <span>paying</span> for <span>lunches</span> by <span>topping</span> up your <span>child's</span> <span>electronic</span> <span>payment</span> <span>card</span> online.<br/>
🎧 You may be <span>wondering</span> what will <span>happen</span> to the old <span>canteen</span>.<br/>
🎧 We'll still have <span>tables</span> and <span>chairs</span> in there,<br/>
🎧 and <span>pupils</span> can eat food from the Food <span>Hall</span> or lunch <span>they've</span> <span>brought</span> from home.<br/>
🎧 <span>Eventually</span> we may use <span>part</span> of the <span>canteen</span> for <span>storage</span>,<br/>
🎧 but first we'll see how many <span>pupils</span> go in there at <span>lunchtime</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, back to the <span>serving</span> <span>points</span> in the Food <span>Hall</span>,<br/>
🎧 which will all have side <span>dishes</span>, <span>desserts</span> and <span>drinks</span> on <span>sale</span>,<br/>
🎧 as well as <span>main</span> <span>courses</span>.<br/>
🎧 One <span>serving</span> <span>point</span> we call <span>World</span> <span>Adventures</span>.<br/>
🎧 This will <span>serve</span> a different <span>country's</span> <span>cuisine</span> each day,<br/>
🎧 maybe <span>Chinese</span> one day and <span>Lebanese</span> the next.<br/>
🎧 The <span>menus</span> will be <span>planned</span> for a week at a time,<br/>
🎧 so <span>pupils</span> will know what's going to be <span>available</span> the whole of that week.<br/>
🎧 <span>Street</span> Life is also <span>international</span>, with food from <span>three</span> <span>particular</span> <span>cultures</span>.<br/>
🎧 We'll ask <span>pupils</span> to make <span>suggestions</span>,<br/>
🎧 so <span>perhaps</span> sometimes <span>there'll</span> be food from <span>Thailand</span>, <span>Ethiopia</span> and <span>Mexico</span>,<br/>
🎧 and then one of them will be <span>replaced</span> by <span>Jamaican</span> food for a week or two.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Speedy</span> <span>Italian</span> <span>serving</span> <span>point</span> will <span>cater</span> <span>particularly</span> for the many <span>pupils</span> who don't eat <span>meat</span> or <span>fish</span>:<br/>
🎧 they can be sure that all the food <span>served</span> there is <span>suitable</span> for them.<br/>
🎧 <span>There'll</span> be <span>plenty</span> of <span>variety</span>, so they shouldn't get <span>bored</span> with the food.<br/>
🎧 OK, that's all on the new Food <span>Hall</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now <span>after-school</span> <span>lessons</span>.<br/>
🎧 These are very <span>popular</span> with <span>pupils</span>, <span>particularly</span> <span>swimming</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 in <span>fact</span> there's a <span>waiting</span> <span>list</span> for <span>lessons</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Cycling</span> is another <span>favourite</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I'm <span>delighted</span> that <span>dozens</span> of <span>pupils</span> make use of the <span>chance</span> to learn to <span>ride</span> in <span>off-road</span> <span>conditions</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>means</span> that more and more <span>cycle</span> to and from school every day.<br/>
🎧 As you know, we have a <span>well-equipped</span> <span>performance</span> <span>centre</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we're going to start <span>drama</span> <span>classes</span> in there, too.<br/>
🎧 <span>Pupils</span> will be able to join in just for fun or work up to taking <span>part</span> in a play <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 we hope to put on at <span>least</span> one a year.<br/>
🎧 We already <span>teach</span> a number of <span>pupils</span> to use the sound and <span>lighting</span> <span>systems</span> in the <span>centre</span>.<br/>
🎧 And a <span>former</span> <span>pupil</span> has <span>given</span> a <span>magnificent</span> <span>grand</span> <span>piano</span> to the school,<br/>
🎧 so a few <span>pupils</span> will be able to learn at the <span>school<br/></span>
🎧 <span>instead</span> of going to the <span>local</span> <span>college</span>, as many of them do at the <span>moment</span>.<br/>

🎧 So <span>Luke</span>, for our next <span>psychology</span> <span>assignment</span> we have to do something on <span>sleep</span> and <span>dreams</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I've just read an <span>article</span> <span>suggesting</span> why we <span>tend</span> to <span>forget</span> most of our <span>dreams</span> soon after we <span>wake</span> up.<br/>
🎧 I mean, most of my <span>dreams</span> aren't that <span>interesting</span> <span>anyway</span>,<br/>
🎧 but what it said was that if we <span>remembered</span> everything,<br/>
🎧 we might get <span>mixed</span> up about what actually <span>happened</span> and what we <span>dreamed</span>.<br/>
🎧 So it's a <span>sort</span> of <span>protection</span>.<br/>
🎧 I hadn't heard that idea before.<br/>
🎧 I'd always <span>assumed</span> that it was just that we didn't have room in our <span>memories</span> for all that <span>stuff</span>.<br/>
🎧 Me too.<br/>
🎧 What do you think about the idea that our <span>dreams</span> may <span>predict</span> the future?<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>belief</span> that you get all over the <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, lots of people have a <span>story</span> of it <span>happening</span> to them,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>explanation</span> I've read is that for each <span>dream</span> that comes <span>true</span>,<br/>
🎧 we have <span>thousands</span> that don't, but we don't <span>notice</span> those,<br/>
🎧 we don't even remember them.<br/>
🎧 We just remember the <span>ones</span> where something in the <span>real</span> <span>world</span>,<br/>
🎧 like a <span>view</span> or an <span>action</span>, <span>happens</span> to <span>trigger</span> a <span>dream</span> <span>memory</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So it's just a <span>coincidence</span> really.<br/>
🎧 Something else I read about is what they call <span>segmented</span> <span>sleeping</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's a <span>theory</span> that <span>hundreds</span> of years ago,<br/>
🎧 people used to get up in the <span>middle</span> of the <span>night</span> and have a <span>chat</span> or something to eat,<br/>
🎧 then go back to bed.<br/>
🎧 So I <span>tried</span> it myself.<br/>
🎧 Why?<br/>
🎧 Well it's <span>meant</span> to make you more <span>creative</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't know why.<br/>
🎧 But I gave it up after a week.<br/>
🎧 It just didn't fit in with my <span>lifestyle</span>.<br/>
🎧 But most <span>pre-school</span> children have a short <span>sleep</span> in the day don't they?<br/>
🎧 There was an <span>experiment</span> some students did here last <span>term</span> to see at what age <span>kids</span> should <span>stop</span> having <span>naps</span>.<br/>
🎧 But they didn't really find an answer.<br/>
🎧 They <span>spent</span> a lot of time working out the most <span>appropriate</span> <span>methodology</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>results</span> didn't <span>seem</span> to show any <span>obvious</span> <span>patterns</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, let's think about our <span>assignment</span>.<br/>
🎧 Last time I had <span>problems</span> with the <span>final</span> <span>stage</span>,<br/>
🎧 where we had to <span>describe</span> and <span>justify</span> how <span>successful</span> we thought we'd been.<br/>
🎧 I <span>struggled</span> a bit with the <span>action</span> plan too.<br/>
🎧 I was OK with the planning,<br/>
🎧 but I got <span>marked</span> down for the <span>self-assessment</span> as well.<br/>
🎧 And I had big <span>problems</span> with the <span>statistical</span> <span>stuff</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's where I really <span>lost</span> <span>marks</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So shall we plan what we have to do for this <span>assignment</span>?<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 First, we have to decide on our <span>research</span> <span>question</span>.<br/>
🎧 So how about <span>'Is</span> there a <span>relationship</span> between hours of <span>sleep</span> and number of <span>dreams?'<br/></span>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Then we need to think about who we'll do the <span>study</span> on.<br/>
🎧 About <span>12</span> people?<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And shall we use other <span>psychology</span> students?<br/>
🎧 Let's use people from a different <span>department</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about <span>history</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, they might have <span>interesting</span> <span>dreams</span>!<br/>
🎧 Or <span>literature</span> students?<br/>
🎧 I don't really know any.<br/>
🎧 OK, <span>forget</span> that idea.<br/>
🎧 Then we have to think about our <span>methodology</span>.<br/>
🎧 So we could use <span>observation</span>,<br/>
🎧 but that doesn't <span>seem</span> <span>appropriate</span>.<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 it needs to be <span>self-reporting</span> I think.<br/>
🎧 And we could ask them to answer <span>questions</span> online.<br/>
🎧 But in this case, <span>paper</span> might be <span>better<br/></span>
🎧 as they'll be doing it <span>straight</span> after they <span>wake</span> <span>up..</span>.<br/>
🎧 in <span>fact</span> while they're still <span>half-asleep</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And we'll have to check the <span>ethical</span> <span>guidelines</span> for this <span>sort</span> of <span>research</span>.<br/>
🎧 Because our <span>experiment</span> <span>involves</span> <span>humans</span>, so there are special <span>regulations</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes,<br/>
🎧 I had a look at those for another <span>assignment</span> I did.<br/>
🎧 There's a whole <span>section</span> on <span>risk</span> <span>assessment</span>,<br/>
🎧 and another <span>section</span> on <span>making</span> sure they aren't put under any <span>unnecessary</span> <span>stress</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's hope they don't have any bad <span>dreams</span>!<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 Then when we've <span>collected</span> all our <span>data</span> we have to <span>analyse</span> <span>it<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>calculate</span> the <span>correlation</span> between our two <span>variables</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's time <span>sleeping</span> and number of <span>dreams<br/></span>
🎧 and then <span>present</span> our <span>results</span> <span>visually</span> in a <span>graph</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right. And the <span>final</span> thing is to think about our <span>research</span> and <span>evaluate</span> it.<br/>
🎧 So that <span>seems</span> quite <span>straightforward</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. So now <span>let's..</span>.<br/>

🎧 It's a <span>universal</span> <span>response</span> to music, <span>found</span> in all <span>cultures</span>.<br/>
🎧 But what's only been <span>discovered</span> <span>recently</span> is that <span>dancing</span> not only makes us feel good,<br/>
🎧 it's also <span>extremely</span> good for our <span>health</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Dancing</span>, like other <span>forms</span> of <span>exercise</span>, <span>releases</span> <span>hormones</span>, such as <span>dopamine</span>,<br/>
🎧 which make us feel <span>relaxed</span> and happy.<br/>
🎧 And it also <span>reduces</span> <span>feelings</span> of <span>stress</span> or <span>anxiety</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Dancing</span> is also a <span>sociable</span> <span>activity</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is another <span>reason</span> it makes us feel good.<br/>
🎧 One <span>study</span> <span>compared</span> <span>people's</span> <span>enjoyment</span> of <span>dancing</span> at home in <span>front</span> of a <span>video</span> with <span>dancing</span> in a group in a <span>studio</span>.<br/>
🎧 The people <span>dancing</span> in a group <span>reported</span> feeling <span>happier</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>whereas</span> those <span>dancing</span> <span>alone</span> did not.<br/>
🎧 In another <span>experiment</span>, university <span>researchers</span> at <span>York</span> and <span>Sheffield<br/></span>
🎧 took a group of students and <span>sent</span> each of them into a <span>lab</span> where music was <span>played</span> for <span>five</span> <span>minutes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Each had to choose from <span>three</span> options:<br/>
🎧 to sit and listen <span>quietly</span> to the music,<br/>
🎧 to <span>cycle</span> on an <span>exercise</span> <span>bike</span> while they <span>listened</span>,<br/>
🎧 or to get up and <span>dance</span>.<br/>
🎧 All were <span>given</span> <span>cognitive</span> <span>tasks</span> to <span>perform</span> before and after.<br/>
🎧 The <span>result</span> <span>showed</span> that those who <span>chose</span> to <span>dance</span> <span>showed</span> much more <span>creativity</span> when doing <span>problem-solving</span> <span>tasks</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Doctor</span> <span>Lovatt</span> at the University of <span>Hertfordshire<br/></span>
🎧 <span>believes</span> <span>dance</span> could be a very <span>useful</span> way to help people <span>suffering</span> from <span>mental</span> <span>health</span> <span>problems</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>thinks</span> <span>dance</span> should be <span>prescribed</span> as <span>therapy<br/></span>
🎧 to help people <span>overcome</span> issues such as <span>depression</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's well <span>established</span> that <span>dance</span> is a good way of <span>encouraging</span> <span>adolescent</span> girls to take <span>exercise<br/></span>
🎧 but what about <span>older</span> people?<br/>
🎧 <span>Studies</span> have <span>shown</span> that there are <span>enormous</span> <span>benefits</span> for people in their <span>60s</span> and <span>beyond</span>.<br/>
🎧 One of the great things about <span>dance</span> is that there are no <span>barriers</span> to <span>participation</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyone</span> can have a go,<br/>
🎧 even those whose <span>standard</span> of <span>fitness</span> is quite low.<br/>
🎧 <span>Dance</span> can be <span>especially</span> <span>beneficial</span> for <span>older</span> <span>adults<br/></span>
🎧 who can't run or do more <span>intense</span> <span>workouts</span>,<br/>
🎧 or for those who don't want to.<br/>
🎧 One <span>2015</span> <span>study</span> <span>found</span> that even a <span>gentle</span> <span>dance</span> <span>workout</span> helps to <span>promote</span> a <span>healthy</span> <span>heart</span>.<br/>
🎧 And there's <span>plenty</span> of <span>evidence</span> which <span>suggests</span> that <span>dancing</span> <span>lowers</span> the <span>risk</span> of <span>falls</span>,<br/>
🎧 which could <span>result</span> in a <span>broken</span> <span>hip</span>, for example, by <span>helping</span> people to <span>improve</span> their <span>balance</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are some less <span>obvious</span> <span>benefits</span> of <span>dance</span> for <span>older</span> people too.<br/>
🎧 One thing I hadn't <span>realised</span> before <span>researching</span> this <span>topic<br/></span>
🎧 was that <span>dance</span> isn't just a <span>physical</span> <span>challenge</span>.<br/>
🎧 It also <span>requires</span> a lot of <span>concentration<br/></span>
🎧 because you need to remember different <span>steps</span> and <span>routines</span>.<br/>
🎧 For <span>older</span> people, this kind of <span>activity</span> is <span>especially</span> <span>important<br/></span>
🎧 because it <span>forces</span> their <span>brain</span> to <span>process</span> things more <span>quickly<br/></span>
🎧 and to <span>retain</span> more <span>information</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Current</span> <span>research</span> also <span>shows</span> that <span>dance</span> <span>promotes</span> a <span>general</span> <span>sense</span> of <span>well-being</span> in <span>older</span> <span>participants</span>,<br/>
🎧 which can last up to a week after a class.<br/>
🎧 <span>Participants</span> <span>report</span> feeling less <span>tired</span> and having <span>greater</span> <span>motivation</span> to be more <span>active<br/></span>
🎧 and do <span>daily</span> <span>activities</span> such as <span>gardening</span> or <span>walking</span> to the <span>shops</span> or a <span>park</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ballroom</span> or <span>country</span> <span>dancing</span>, both <span>popular</span> with <span>older</span> people, have to be done in <span>groups</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>require</span> <span>collaboration</span> and often <span>involve</span> <span>touching</span> a <span>dance</span> <span>partner</span>,<br/>
🎧 all of which <span>encourages</span> <span>interaction</span> on the <span>dance</span> <span>floor</span>.<br/>
🎧 This helps to <span>develop</span> new <span>relationships<br/></span>
🎧 and can <span>reduce</span> <span>older</span> <span>people's</span> <span>sense</span> of <span>isolation</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is a <span>huge</span> <span>problem</span> in many <span>countries</span>.<br/>
🎧 I also <span>looked</span> at the <span>benefits</span> of <span>Zumba</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Fifteen</span> <span>million</span> people in <span>180</span> <span>countries</span> now <span>regularly</span> take a <span>Zumba</span> class,<br/>
🎧 an <span>aerobic</span> <span>workout</span> <span>based</span> on <span>Latin</span> <span>American</span> <span>dance</span> <span>moves</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>John</span> <span>Porcari</span>, a <span>professor</span> of <span>exercise</span> and <span>sport</span> <span>science</span> at the University of <span>Wisconsin</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>analysed</span> a group of <span>women</span> who were <span>Zumba</span> <span>regulars<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>found</span> that a class <span>lasting</span> <span>40</span> <span>minutes</span> <span>burns</span> about <span>370</span> <span>calories</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is <span>similar</span> to <span>moderately</span> <span>intense</span> <span>exercises</span> like <span>step</span> <span>aerobics</span> or <span>kickboxing</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>study</span> in the <span>American</span> <span>Journal</span> of <span>Health</span> <span>Behavior<br/></span>
🎧 <span>showed</span> that when <span>women</span> with <span>obesity</span> did <span>Zumba</span> <span>three</span> <span>times</span> a week for <span>16</span> <span>weeks</span>,<br/>
🎧 they <span>lost</span> an <span>average</span> of <span>1.2</span> <span>kilos<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>lowered</span> their <span>percentage</span> of <span>body</span> fat by <span>1%</span>.<br/>
🎧 More <span>importantly</span>, the <span>women</span> <span>enjoyed</span> the class so <span>much<br/></span>
🎧 that they made it a <span>habit</span> and <span>continued</span> to <span>attend</span> <span>classes</span> at <span>least</span> once a week <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 very <span>unusual</span> for an <span>aerobic</span> <span>exercise</span> <span>programme</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Dance</span> is never going to <span>compete</span> with <span>high-intensity</span> <span>workouts<br/></span>
🎧 when it comes to <span>physical</span> <span>fitness</span> <span>gains</span>,<br/>
🎧 but its <span>popularity</span> is <span>likely</span> to keep on <span>rising<br/></span>
🎧 because it's such a fun way to keep fit.<br/>
