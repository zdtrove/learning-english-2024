🎧 Hello, this is <span>Land</span> <span>Transport</span> <span>Information</span> at <span>Toronto</span> <span>Airport</span>.<br/>
🎧 How may I help you?<br/>
🎧 Oh, good morning.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>flying</span> to <span>Toronto</span> <span>Airport</span> next week, and I need to get to a <span>town</span> called <span>um</span>, <span>Milton</span>.<br/>
🎧 Could you tell me how I can get there?<br/>
🎧 <span>Milton</span>, did you say?<br/>
🎧 Let me see.<br/>
🎧 I think that's about <span>150</span> <span>miles</span> <span>southwest</span> of here.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, it's <span>147</span> <span>miles</span> to be <span>exact</span>,<br/>
🎧 so it'll take you at <span>least</span> <span>-</span> say, <span>three</span> to <span>four</span> hours by <span>road</span>.<br/>
🎧 Wow! Is it as <span>far</span> as that?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I'm <span>afraid</span> so.<br/>
🎧 But you have a number of options to get you <span>there<br/></span>
🎧 and you can always <span>rent</span> a car right here at the <span>airport</span>, of course.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Well, I don't really want to drive myself, <span>so..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd like more <span>information</span> about <span>public</span> <span>transport</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 In that case the <span>quickest</span> and most <span>comfortable</span> is a <span>cab<br/></span>
🎧 and of course there are always <span>plenty</span> <span>available</span>.<br/>
🎧 But it'll <span>cost</span> you.<br/>
🎧 You can also take a <span>Greyhound</span> bus or there's an <span>Airport</span> <span>Shuttle</span> <span>Service</span> to <span>Milton</span>.<br/>
🎧 Uh, I think for that kind of <span>distance</span> a <span>cab</span> would be way <span>beyond</span> my <span>budget</span>.<br/>
🎧 But the bus sounds OK.<br/>
🎧 Can you tell me how much that would <span>cost</span>?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 Let's see, that would be <span>$15</span> one way,<br/>
🎧 or <span>27.50</span> <span>return..</span>.<br/>
🎧 that's on the <span>Greyhound</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's quite <span>cheap</span> <span>-</span> great!<br/>
🎧 <span>Uh..</span>. but <span>whereabouts</span> does it <span>stop</span> in <span>Milton</span>?<br/>
🎧 It <span>goes</span> <span>directly</span> from the <span>airport</span> here to the <span>City</span> <span>Centre</span>, and it's <span>pretty</span> <span>fast</span>.<br/>
🎧 But you have to <span>bear</span> in <span>mind</span> that there is only one <span>departure</span> a day,<br/>
🎧 so it <span>depends</span> what time your <span>flight</span> <span>gets</span> in.<br/>
🎧 Oh, of course.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hang</span> on, we're <span>due</span> to get there at <span>11.30</span> am.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmmm</span>, too bad,<br/>
🎧 the bus leaves at <span>3.45</span>,<br/>
🎧 so you would have quite a wait <span>-</span> more than <span>4</span> hours.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I see.<br/>
🎧 Well, what about the <span>shuttle</span> you <span>mentioned</span>?<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 That's the <span>Airport</span> <span>Shuttle</span> that will take you from the <span>airport</span> right to your <span>hotel</span> or <span>private</span> <span>address</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>door-to-door</span> <span>service</span> and it would <span>suit</span> you much better, because there's one every two hours.<br/>
🎧 So how much does that <span>cost</span>?<br/>
🎧 Let's see.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, that's <span>$35</span> one way, <span>$65</span> <span>return</span>,<br/>
🎧 so I <span>guess</span> it's a bit more <span>expensive</span> than the <span>Greyhound</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that doesn't sound too bad,<br/>
🎧 <span>especially</span> if it'll take me <span>straight</span> to the <span>hotel</span>.<br/>
🎧 But you do need to <span>reserve</span> a <span>seat</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK,<br/>
🎧 is it <span>possible</span> to make a <span>booking</span> right now? Through you?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 OK, I just have to <span>fill</span> this <span>form</span> out for you.<br/>
🎧 So what date do you want to book this for?<br/>
🎧 The <span>16th</span> of <span>October</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, oh, no, sorry, that's my <span>departure</span> date.<br/>
🎧 I <span>arrive</span> on the <span>17th</span>, so book it for then, please.<br/>
🎧 So, that's the <span>Toronto</span> <span>Airport</span> <span>Shuttle</span> to <span>Milton</span>.<br/>
🎧 And this is for just one person <span>or…</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, just me, please.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And you said your <span>expected</span> time of <span>arrival</span> was <span>11.30</span>?<br/>
🎧 So if I book your <span>Shuttle</span> for after <span>12.00</span> <span>-</span> let's say <span>12.30</span>,<br/>
🎧 that should give you <span>plenty</span> of time to, you know, <span>collect</span> your <span>baggage</span>, maybe <span>grab</span> a <span>coffee</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, that sounds fine, as long as we <span>land</span> on time!<br/>
🎧 Well, we'll take your <span>flight</span> <span>details</span> so you don't need to <span>worry</span> too much about that.<br/>
🎧 Now, what about the <span>fare</span>?<br/>
🎧 What <span>sort</span> of <span>ticket</span> do you want?<br/>
🎧 One way <span>or…</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, <span>that'll</span> be fine, <span>provided</span> I can book the <span>return</span> <span>trip</span> once I'm there.<br/>
🎧 No <span>problem</span> <span>-</span> just <span>allow</span> a <span>couple</span> of <span>days</span> in <span>advance</span> to make sure you get a <span>seat</span>.<br/>
🎧 And what is your name, please?<br/>
🎧 <span>Janet</span>, <span>Janet</span> <span>Thomson</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is that <span>Thompson</span> <span>spelt</span> with a <span>'p'</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, it's <span>THOMSON</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And you'll be <span>coming</span> from the <span>UK</span>?<br/>
🎧 What <span>flight</span> will you be <span>traveling</span> on?<br/>
🎧 Oh, it's Air <span>Canada</span> <span>flight</span> number <span>AC936</span>, from <span>London</span> <span>Heathrow</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Now, do you know where you'll be <span>staying</span>?<br/>
🎧 We need to give the <span>driver</span> an <span>address</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's called the <span>Vacation</span> <span>Motel<br/></span>
🎧 and I think it's near the <span>town</span> <span>centre</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, the <span>address</span> is <span>24</span>, <span>Kitchener</span> <span>Street</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 that's <span>KITCHENER</span> <span>Street</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's fine.<br/>
🎧 Right, so that's <span>$35</span> to pay, please. Have you got your <span>credit</span> <span>card</span> number there?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's a <span>VISA</span> <span>card</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the number is <span>3303</span> <span>8450</span> <span>2045</span> <span>6837</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK. Well, that <span>seems</span> to be everything.<br/>
🎧 Have a good <span>trip</span> and we'll see you in <span>Toronto</span> next week!<br/>
🎧 Yes, bye. Oh, thanks for your help!<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Thank you all for <span>coming</span> to my talk this <span>evening</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's nice to see so many people in the <span>audience</span>.<br/>
🎧 For those of you who don't know very much about <span>PS</span> <span>Camping</span>,<br/>
🎧 let me start by <span>giving</span> you some <span>background</span> <span>information</span> about the company.<br/>
🎧 The company <span>started</span> <span>25</span> years ago.<br/>
🎧 It actually <span>opened</span> as a <span>retail</span> <span>chain</span> <span>selling</span> <span>camping</span> <span>equipment</span>,<br/>
🎧 and then <span>20</span> years ago, it <span>bought</span> a small number of <span>campsites</span> in the <span>UK</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>began</span> <span>offering</span> <span>camping</span> <span>holidays</span>.<br/>
🎧 The company <span>grew</span> <span>rapidly<br/></span>
🎧 and has been <span>providing</span> <span>holidays</span> in <span>continental</span> <span>Europe</span> for the last <span>15</span> years.<br/>
🎧 If you book a <span>camping</span> <span>holiday</span> with us,<br/>
🎧 you'll have a <span>choice</span> of over <span>300</span> <span>sites</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>Italy</span>, we now have some <span>64</span> <span>sites</span> that we either own, or have <span>exclusive</span> use of.<br/>
🎧 <span>France</span> is where we have the <span>majority</span> of <span>sites</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we <span>currently</span> have a <span>project</span> to <span>expand</span> into <span>Switzerland</span>.<br/>
🎧 We also have a number of <span>sites</span> in <span>Northern</span> <span>Spain</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>particularly</span> in the <span>mountainous</span> <span>region</span> of <span>Picos</span> <span>de</span> <span>Europa</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've <span>upgraded</span> all these <span>Spanish</span> <span>sites</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>improved</span> them <span>considerably</span> from their <span>original</span> <span>three-star</span> <span>rating</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>believe</span> our <span>holidays</span> <span>offer</span> <span>superb</span> <span>facilities</span> for the whole <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Parents</span> who want their children to be <span>fully</span> <span>occupied</span> for all or <span>part</span> of the <span>day<br/></span>
🎧 can take <span>advantage</span> of our <span>children's</span> <span>activities</span>.<br/>
🎧 These are <span>organised</span> by our <span>well-qualified</span> and <span>enthusiastic</span> <span>staff</span>.<br/>
🎧 Each day <span>kicks</span> off with a <span>sports</span> <span>match</span>, <span>perhaps</span> <span>football</span>, or <span>volleyball</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>followed</span> by an <span>hour</span> of <span>drama</span> for everyone.<br/>
🎧 This may <span>include</span> <span>singing</span> or <span>dancing</span>, <span>mime</span> or other <span>activities</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>afternoon</span>, there's a different <span>art</span> <span>activity</span> for each day of the <span>week<br/></span>
🎧 <span>including</span> a <span>poster</span> <span>competition</span> or <span>model</span> <span>making</span>.<br/>
🎧 What's more, our <span>sites</span> are <span>truly</span> <span>child-friendly</span>,<br/>
🎧 and, with this in <span>mind</span>, we <span>operate</span> a <span>no-noise</span> <span>rule</span> in the <span>evenings</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Children's</span> <span>evening</span> <span>activities</span> usually <span>finish</span> at <span>9.30</span>, or <span>occasionally</span> <span>10</span>,<br/>
🎧 and from <span>10.30</span> <span>holiday-makers</span> are <span>expected</span> to be <span>quiet</span> in the <span>areas</span> where there are <span>tents</span>.<br/>
🎧 We want <span>nothing</span> to go wrong on a <span>PS</span> <span>Camping</span> <span>holiday</span>,<br/>
🎧 but if it does, we also want all our <span>customers</span> to be <span>insured</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you haven't <span>organised</span> an <span>annual</span> <span>insurance</span> <span>policy</span> of your <span>own<br/></span>
🎧 you'll need to take out the <span>low-cost</span> <span>cover</span> we <span>offer<br/></span>
🎧 and we <span>require</span> that you <span>arrange</span> this when you make your <span>holiday</span> <span>reservation</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are many <span>advantages</span> to <span>choosing</span> <span>PS</span> <span>Camping</span>, and to <span>recommending</span> it to <span>others</span>.<br/>
🎧 As a <span>regular</span> <span>customer</span>, you'll be <span>kept</span> <span>informed</span> of special <span>offers</span>,<br/>
🎧 and your friends can <span>benefit</span> from <span>10%</span> off their <span>holiday</span>,<br/>
🎧 or book a <span>luxury</span> <span>tent</span> for the <span>price</span> of a <span>standard</span> one.<br/>
🎧 In <span>return</span>, we'll <span>send</span> you a <span>thank-you</span> <span>present</span>,<br/>
🎧 which you can choose from a <span>list</span> of <span>high-quality</span> <span>items</span>.<br/>
🎧 When it comes to our <span>tents</span>, these are <span>equipped</span> to the <span>highest</span> <span>standard</span>.<br/>
🎧 We really do think of every <span>essential</span> <span>detail</span>,<br/>
🎧 from an <span>oven</span> and cooking <span>rings</span> <span>fuelled</span> by <span>bottled</span> gas,<br/>
🎧 to <span>mirrors</span> in the <span>bedroom</span> <span>areas</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you don't want to <span>cook</span> <span>indoors</span>,<br/>
🎧 you can <span>borrow</span> a <span>barbecue</span> if you ask in <span>advance</span> for one to be made <span>available</span>,<br/>
🎧 and there's even a <span>picnic</span> <span>blanket</span> to sit on outside your <span>tent</span>.<br/>
🎧 Inside, a box of <span>games</span> and <span>toys</span> can be <span>found</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>children's</span> <span>tents</span> can be <span>hired</span> if <span>required</span>.<br/>
🎧 All <span>tents</span> have a <span>fridge</span>,<br/>
🎧 and if you want to <span>spend</span> the day on the <span>beach</span>, for example,<br/>
🎧 ask for a <span>specially</span> <span>designed</span> <span>PS</span> <span>Camping</span> <span>cool</span> box,<br/>
🎧 which will keep your food and <span>drinks</span> <span>chilled</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>excellent</span> <span>washing</span> <span>facilities</span> at all our <span>sites</span>,<br/>
🎧 with <span>washing</span> <span>machines</span> and <span>clothes</span> <span>lines</span> in the <span>central</span> <span>areas</span>,<br/>
🎧 along with <span>mops</span> and <span>buckets</span> in case your <span>tent</span> needs <span>cleaning</span> during your <span>stay</span>.<br/>
🎧 All <span>sites</span> have a <span>cafe</span> <span>and/or</span> a <span>shop<br/></span>
🎧 for those who'd rather <span>'eat</span> <span>in'</span> than <span>dine</span> at a <span>local</span> <span>restaurant</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Well, you've both been looking at different <span>styles</span> of <span>managing</span> <span>individuals</span> in <span>companies</span> and the <span>workplace</span>.<br/>
🎧 How's the <span>research</span> going, <span>Philip</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I've been looking at why <span>individualism..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I mean <span>individual</span> <span>differences</span>, are such an important <span>area</span> of <span>management</span> <span>studies</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you think about any <span>organization</span>,<br/>
🎧 be it a <span>family</span> <span>business</span> or a <span>multinational</span> company,<br/>
🎧 they're all <span>fundamentally</span> a group of people working together.<br/>
🎧 But it's what these <span>individuals</span> <span>contribute</span> to their <span>places</span> of work that makes you <span>realize</span> how important they are.<br/>
🎧 Of course they <span>bring</span> different <span>ideas</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it's also their <span>attitudes</span> and their <span>experiences</span> of <span>learning</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Diversity</span> is important in these <span>areas</span> too.<br/>
🎧 So why do people <span>behave</span> so <span>differently</span> from one another at work?<br/>
🎧 There are lots of <span>reasons<br/></span>
🎧 but <span>research</span> has <span>shown</span> that a lot of it comes down to <span>personality</span>.<br/>
🎧 And the other <span>factor</span> is <span>gender</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a well <span>known</span> <span>fact</span> that men and <span>women</span> do lots of things in different <span>ways</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>workplace</span> is no different.<br/>
🎧 Did you look at the <span>effects</span> of this <span>variation</span> on <span>companies</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I did.<br/>
🎧 On the <span>positive</span> side,<br/>
🎧 <span>exposure</span> to such <span>diversity</span> helps <span>encourage</span> <span>creativity<br/></span>
🎧 which is <span>generally</span> an <span>asset</span> to a company.<br/>
🎧 But <span>unfortunately</span> <span>individual</span> <span>differences</span> are also the <span>root</span> of <span>conflict</span> between <span>staff<br/></span>
🎧 and they can <span>lead</span> to <span>difficulties</span> for <span>management</span>, which can sometimes be serious.<br/>
🎧 Thanks, <span>Philip</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, now, I <span>guess</span> the two <span>main</span> things to remember here are to <span>identify</span> <span>individual</span> <span>talent</span> and then to <span>utilize</span> it.<br/>
🎧 So, <span>Janice</span>, you were looking at <span>identifying</span> different <span>talents</span> in <span>workers</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you think this is easy for <span>managers</span> to do?<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>currently</span> <span>teamwork</span> is in <span>fashion</span> in the <span>workplace<br/></span>
🎧 and in my <span>opinion</span> the <span>importance</span> of the <span>individual</span> is <span>generally</span> <span>neglected</span>.<br/>
🎧 What <span>managers</span> should be <span>targeting</span> is those <span>employees</span> who can take the <span>lead</span> in a <span>situation<br/></span>
🎧 and are not <span>afraid</span> to <span>accept</span> the idea of <span>responsibility</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>true</span> <span>Janice</span> <span>but..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>unfortunately</span>, many <span>managers</span> think the <span>entire</span> <span>notion</span> of <span>encouraging</span> <span>individuality</span> <span>amongst</span> their <span>staff</span> is <span>far</span> too <span>hard</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that may be <span>true<br/></span>
🎧 but I think one of the most important <span>tasks</span> of <span>managers</span> is to <span>consider</span> the needs of the <span>individual</span> on one <span>hand<br/></span>
🎧 and group <span>co-operation</span> and <span>conformity</span> on the other.<br/>
🎧 It <span>requires</span> <span>creative</span> thinking on the <span>part</span> of <span>management</span> to <span>avoid</span> <span>tension</span>.<br/>
🎧 So <span>Janice</span>, what kind of people do you think <span>companies</span> should be looking for?<br/>
🎧 Well, it has to start from the very <span>beginning<br/></span>
🎧 when <span>companies</span> are looking for new <span>employees</span>.<br/>
🎧 When the <span>personnel</span> <span>department</span> is <span>choosing</span> between <span>applicants<br/></span>
🎧 they need to look for <span>someone</span> who's <span>broken</span> the <span>mould</span> and can think for <span>themselves</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Instead</span>, people <span>making</span> these <span>decisions</span> often use a <span>range</span> of <span>psychological</span> <span>tests<br/></span>
🎧 to see if a person is a <span>problem</span> <span>solver</span>, or will do as they're told.<br/>
🎧 I'm not <span>convinced</span> these <span>qualities</span> are actually the most important.<br/>
🎧 So, do you think being a good <span>team</span> <span>player</span> is <span>overrated</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, it's not <span>overrated</span>.<br/>
🎧 You do need to learn the <span>rules</span> and learn them <span>fast</span>.<br/>
🎧 No <span>individual</span> can get around this if you're working in an <span>organization</span>.<br/>
🎧 So how should <span>managers</span> <span>deal</span> with this?<br/>
🎧 <span>Rewards</span>.<br/>
🎧 When an <span>individual</span> <span>demonstrates</span> the <span>behaviour</span> the <span>organisation</span> <span>expects</span>,<br/>
🎧 some kind of <span>incentive</span> can be <span>given</span>.<br/>
🎧 What's important here is that this <span>happens</span> right at the <span>beginning<br/></span>
🎧 so new <span>recruits</span> learn the <span>rules</span> of the <span>system</span> <span>immediately</span>.<br/>
🎧 Also the <span>incentive</span> should be something the <span>individual</span> actually <span>wants</span>,<br/>
🎧 and this isn't always just money.<br/>
🎧 To come back to you, <span>Philip</span>.<br/>
🎧 You were saying that <span>recognition</span> of good <span>performers</span> is <span>essential</span>.<br/>
🎧 What else should <span>managers</span> be looking for?<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>managing</span> people <span>means</span> you not only have an <span>understanding</span> of your <span>employees</span>,<br/>
🎧 but you also <span>recognise</span> the <span>culture</span> of the <span>organization</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, for some <span>organizations</span>, <span>creativity</span> and <span>individuality</span> may be the last thing they want to see during working hours!<br/>
🎧 Very <span>true</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but <span>managing</span> people isn't as easy as it looks.<br/>
🎧 For example, change in the <span>workplace</span> can be quite <span>tricky</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>especially</span> if there's a need to <span>increase</span> <span>profit</span>.<br/>
🎧 And at <span>times</span> like these,<br/>
🎧 <span>managers</span> may have to give <span>priority</span> to <span>profit</span> rather than <span>individual</span> <span>staff</span> needs.<br/>
🎧 Yes, and that <span>creates</span> <span>difficult</span> <span>situations</span> for people.<br/>
🎧 Yes but what's important is that <span>managers</span> are able to <span>deal</span> with quite high <span>levels</span> of personal <span>stress</span>.<br/>
🎧 During <span>times</span> of change,<br/>
🎧 they should be thinking not only about the <span>strain</span> on their <span>staff<br/></span>
🎧 but take time out to think of <span>themselves</span>.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely.<br/>
🎧 So what are the <span>implications…<br/>

🎧 Good <span>afternoon</span>, everyone!<br/>
🎧 This is the first <span>seminar</span> in <span>preparation</span> for our <span>archaeological</span> <span>fieldwork</span> in <span>Namibia;<br/></span>
🎧 we are <span>fantastically</span> <span>lucky</span> to have <span>received</span> <span>partial</span> <span>research</span> <span>funding</span> for this <span>trip</span> from our <span>Institute</span>,<br/>
🎧 so I shall <span>expect</span> <span>200%</span> <span>attention</span> and <span>participation</span> from you all.<br/>
🎧 First in this <span>seminar</span>, I'm going to give a <span>brief</span> <span>introduction</span> to <span>contemporary</span> <span>research</span> on <span>rock</span> <span>art</span>,<br/>
🎧 and in the second <span>part</span> I'm going to give you some <span>do's</span> and <span>don'ts</span> for our <span>fieldwork</span> <span>trip</span> in <span>April</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 so please listen very <span>carefully</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm first going to focus on the <span>interpretation</span> of <span>rock</span> <span>art</span> in <span>Namibia</span>.<br/>
🎧 We are very <span>fortunate</span> to be going to an <span>area</span> where you can find some of the most important <span>sites</span> in the <span>entire</span> <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 And I hope to show you how easy it is for everyone to make <span>mistakes</span> in looking at <span>cultures</span> which are different from our own <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 the first and most important <span>lesson</span> we have to learn.<br/>
🎧 In <span>Namibia</span>, there are both <span>paintings</span> and <span>engravings</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 that's where the <span>surface</span> of the <span>rock</span> is cut out.<br/>
🎧 Many of the <span>engravings</span> show <span>footprints</span> of <span>animals<br/></span>
🎧 and most <span>scholars</span> used to think that the <span>purpose</span> of these was simple and <span>obvious:<br/></span>
🎧 this <span>rock</span> <span>art</span> was like a school book with <span>pictures</span> to <span>teach</span> children about <span>tracks</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 which <span>track</span> <span>belonged</span> to which <span>animal</span> <span>-</span> <span>giraffe</span>, <span>lion</span> and so on.<br/>
🎧 But there were some <span>mysteries</span>.<br/>
🎧 First, when you look at a <span>typical</span> <span>Namibian</span> <span>painting</span> or <span>engraving</span>,<br/>
🎧 you see the <span>tracks</span> are <span>repeated</span>, there are <span>dozens</span> of <span>tracks</span> for the same <span>animal</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'd <span>expect</span> just one <span>clear</span> <span>illustration</span> if the <span>reason..</span>. the <span>aim</span> was to <span>teach</span> <span>tracking</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, there were two more <span>problems</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why are some of the <span>engravings</span> of <span>animals</span> very <span>accurate</span> as you'd <span>expect</span> <span>-</span> all <span>clearly</span> <span>identifiable</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>others</span> quite <span>unrealistic</span>?<br/>
🎧 And another <span>mystery:<br/></span>
🎧 some of these <span>unrealistic</span> <span>animals</span> that's in the <span>engravings</span> <span>seem</span> to be <span>half</span> <span>human</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some, for example, have got <span>human</span> <span>faces</span>.<br/>
🎧 Many <span>researchers</span> now think that these were <span>pictures</span> the <span>wise</span> men <span>engraved</span> of <span>themselves</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>believed</span> they could use <span>magic</span> to <span>control</span> the <span>animals</span> they had <span>drawn</span>,<br/>
🎧 so the <span>hunters</span> could then catch them for food.<br/>
🎧 This <span>shows</span> you some of the <span>dangers</span> of <span>coming</span> from one <span>culture</span> to another,<br/>
🎧 as we'll be doing, without <span>understanding</span> it <span>fully</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Scholars</span> <span>imagined</span> that children <span>looked</span> at <span>rock</span> <span>art</span> <span>pictures</span> to learn to <span>track<br/></span>
🎧 just because they <span>themselves</span> had <span>learnt</span> <span>skills</span> from <span>pictures;<br/></span>
🎧 many <span>researchers</span> now <span>believe</span> that <span>rock</span> <span>art</span> had a much more <span>complex</span> <span>purpose</span>.<br/>
🎧 And we'll talk more about it next week!<br/>
🎧 Now, before I <span>invite</span> you to join in a <span>discussion</span> in this second <span>part</span> of the <span>seminar</span>,<br/>
🎧 I'd like to make some very important <span>points</span> about our <span>fieldwork<br/></span>
🎧 and in <span>fact</span>, any <span>field</span> <span>trip</span> to look at <span>rock</span> <span>art</span>.<br/>
🎧 We're going to a number of <span>sites</span>, and we won't always be together.<br/>
🎧 The <span>single</span> <span>largest</span> <span>problem</span> <span>faced</span> by people who <span>manage</span> the <span>sites</span> <span>is..</span>.<br/>
🎧 yes, I'm sure you've <span>guessed</span> <span>-</span> <span>damage</span> <span>caused</span> by <span>visitors</span>,<br/>
🎧 even though it's usually <span>unintentional</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Whenever</span> you do go to a <span>site</span>,<br/>
🎧 don't <span>forget</span> you can learn many things from <span>observing</span> at a <span>distance</span> <span>instead</span> of <span>walking</span> all over it.<br/>
🎧 This can really help to <span>reduce</span> <span>visitor</span> <span>pressure</span>.<br/>
🎧 People often say, <span>'Well</span>, there's only two of us and just this one <span>time'</span>,<br/>
🎧 but maybe <span>thousands</span> of people are saying the same thing.<br/>
🎧 And then some <span>basic</span> <span>rules</span> to <span>guide</span> <span>you:<br/></span>
🎧 we'll have our own <span>camp</span> near a <span>village</span>,<br/>
🎧 but remember, never to <span>camp</span> on a <span>site</span> if you go on your own.<br/>
🎧 It may be <span>disrespectful</span> to the people of that <span>culture</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>certainly</span> don't make <span>fires</span>, <span>however</span> <span>romantic</span> it may <span>seem</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's really <span>dangerous</span> in dry <span>areas</span>,<br/>
🎧 and you can <span>easily</span> <span>burn</span> <span>priceless</span> <span>undiscovered</span> <span>material</span> by doing so.<br/>
🎧 So, how are we going to enjoy the <span>rock</span> <span>art</span> on our <span>field</span> <span>trip</span>?<br/>
🎧 By looking at it, <span>drawing</span> it and <span>photographing</span> it,<br/>
🎧 never by <span>touching</span> it or even <span>tracing</span> it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Rock</span> <span>art</span> is <span>fragile</span> and <span>precious</span>.<br/>
🎧 Remember that <span>climbing</span> on <span>rocks</span> and in <span>caves</span> can <span>destroy</span> in a <span>moment</span> what has <span>lasted</span> for <span>centuries</span>.<br/>
🎧 So no <span>heroics</span> in <span>Namibia</span>, please!<br/>
🎧 Try to be <span>extra</span> <span>careful</span> and help <span>others</span> to be too.<br/>
🎧 And <span>lastly</span>, please don't even move <span>rocks</span> or <span>branches</span> to take <span>photographs</span>.<br/>
🎧 You should leave the <span>site</span> <span>intact</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure I can <span>rely</span> on you to do that.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's about all I want to say before <span>today's</span> first <span>discussion</span>,<br/>
🎧 but if you have any <span>questions</span>, please ask them <span>now<br/></span>
🎧 oh, and, don't <span>forget</span> you'll find some <span>fascinating</span> <span>information</span> about <span>world-wide</span> <span>sites</span> on the <span>Internet</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, first <span>question</span> then?<br/>
