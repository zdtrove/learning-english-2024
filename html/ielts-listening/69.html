🎧 Well, we have this school excursion planned, but when exactly is it?<br/>
🎧 Is it this Tuesday or Wednesday?<br/>
🎧 Well it can't be Tuesday, with the English tests taking place.<br/>
🎧 Ah, right. Not Tuesday, but Wednesday.<br/>
🎧 That's right - all day Wednesday - taking a bus outside the city.<br/>
🎧 And where are we going?<br/>
🎧 Ah, last month we went to Arthur Island,<br/>
🎧 so this time we're going to the... Animal Park<br/> 
🎧 Arthur Island was okay, but it was too cold.<br/>
🎧 Let's hope the weather for this week's excursion is better.<br/>
🎧 I don't suppose animals care about bad weather, but I certainly do.<br/>
🎧 Have you heard the forecast?<br/>
🎧 Yes, and it's not too bad.<br/>
🎧 Basically, they're saying Monday will be sunny.<br/>
🎧 Good...<br/>
🎧 But then the weather will change.<br/>
🎧 Not so good.<br/>
🎧 Yes, Tuesday we'll have some showers,<br/>
🎧 but by Wednesday, the day of our excursion, it will be...<br/>
🎧 well, their words are "cold and cloudy".<br/>
🎧 Cold and cloudy. Well, as long as it isn't 'wet and rainy', I'm happy enough.<br/>
🎧 We won't need umbrellas, just warm clothing.<br/>
🎧 And what time will we get there?<br/>
🎧 Let's see. The bus picks us up at 8:30 am,<br/>
🎧 and then it's an hour and a half on the road, so we arrive at 10 a.m...<br/>
🎧 sorry, with the 15-minute break, that will actually be 10:15 a.m.<br/>
🎧 That's early enough.<br/>
🎧 Then all our students can see the animals, have their fun, and do whatever they want to do.<br/>
🎧 Well, one fun event planned that day is 'Birds of Prey'.<br/>
🎧 What's that?<br/>
🎧 That's when they bring out several birds of prey:<br/>
🎧 eagles, falcons, kites, those sorts of birds,<br/>
🎧 and throw pieces of meat into the air,<br/>
🎧 and the birds swoop down and eat them.<br/>
🎧 It's quite impressive.<br/>
🎧 Sounds great. 'Birds of Prey'.<br/>
🎧 Are there any other activities?<br/>
🎧 There's a catered lunch, at the park restaurant.<br/>
🎧 We've already paid for that, and in the afternoon there's...<br/>
🎧 well, I had a choice between the 'Reptile Display' and the 'Koala Handling'.<br/>
🎧 In the reptile display, the students can handle live pythons and various other snakes.<br/>
🎧 Surely they'd rather hold koalas?<br/>
🎧 I'm sure, but the koalas can't be handled unless the weather's sunny, and given the forecast,<br/>
🎧 I thought it better to choose the reptile display.<br/>
🎧 Ummm, that's a shame.<br/>
🎧 These Asian students would love the 'Koala Handling'.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I know, but we can't control the weather.<br/>
🎧 And, then we get back. What time will that be?<br/>
🎧 We leave the park at 4:30, but then we face traffic,<br/>
🎧 so we won't get back until well after 6 pm.<br/>
🎧 It will most likely be 6:30.<br/>
🎧 But that's better than the last trip: we didn't get home until 8:30 that time.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that was a bit too late, wasn't it?<br/>
🎧 Andrew, I understand you've been doing some research regarding the breakdown, by nationality of our student body.<br/>
🎧 That must've produced some interesting results.<br/>
🎧 You're right. I got some statistics from head office.<br/>
🎧 I would imagine that most of our students are either Japanese or Chinese.<br/>
🎧 You imagine right.<br/>
🎧 But it's the Chinese who constitute the majority, but only just.<br/>
🎧 I had thought Koreans might be second,<br/>
🎧 but it's actually the Japanese, quite close behind.<br/>
🎧 It's somewhat surprising, but obviously all those Study Tours that our university markets in Japan are bringing in students.<br/>
🎧 What's the breakdown exactly?<br/>
🎧 Japanese are a quarter of the whole, which is considerable.<br/>
🎧 Last year they were only 16%, so that market has grown nicely.<br/>
🎧 Ah, the only other proportions of some weight are the Indonesians and Koreans - about the same.<br/>
🎧 Indonesians at 15%, and...<br/>
🎧 the Koreans are a little higher -<br/> 
🎧 not like last year when they were less than 10%.<br/>
🎧 I thought we'd have more Indonesians than Koreans?<br/>
🎧 Well, as I said, they're about the same<br/> 
🎧 just like the Saudi and Thai student numbers, almost the same also -<br/> 
🎧 both just under 10.<br/>
🎧 Which one is bigger?<br/>
🎧 Thai students number just a fraction more.<br/>
🎧 As for the other nationalities, collectively they're only 3%,<br/>
🎧 so it wasn't worth giving each of them a separate category.<br/>
🎧 I just grouped them under 'other'<br/> 
🎧 that's Vietnamese, South American, a couple of Russians, and so on.<br/>
<br/><br/>

🎧 Hello everyone.<br/>
🎧 Now, you're here because you're interested in travel, right?<br/>
🎧 And you're in the right place,<br/>
🎧 for at EasyTravel, we have the best deals for the best locations.<br/>
🎧 We specialise in eco-travel,<br/>
🎧 or holidays designed to get you amongst nature,<br/>
🎧 ignoring the hustle and bustle of big cities.<br/>
🎧 So, whether you want to hike in Nepal, as many people do,<br/>
🎧 or follow some jungle paths in the rainforests of Queensland,<br/>
🎧 we can give you the best deal.<br/>
🎧 If you look at our office here, you'll see our overseas consultants.<br/>
🎧 That's for trips overseas, obviously, to Europe, to North America,<br/>
🎧 but primarily for the Asian market,<br/>
🎧 which is generally more popular in this part of the world.<br/>
🎧 Most people like that touch of the Orient, right?<br/>
🎧 But they also like the domestic market,<br/>
🎧 since this country offers its fair share of beautiful natural vistas.<br/>
🎧 What about the deserts, anyone?<br/>
🎧 What about some striking red-rock gorges?<br/>
🎧 Then, talk to our domestic consultants, who can arrange anything you want.<br/>
🎧 But they deal with the accounts in the morning,<br/>
🎧 so you'll need to talk to them in the afternoon.<br/>
🎧 And remember, our office doesn't open at night, sorry to say.<br/>
🎧 Now, around the outskirts and outer regions of this city,<br/>
🎧 there are many beautiful places that you might not be aware of.<br/>
🎧 And the advantages of these regional locations are many.<br/>
🎧 Mostly, by being closer, some of them can be done in a day tour.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's fast and convenient, with none of those long-haul bus trips<br/> 
🎧 which often leave you cramped and uncomfortable,<br/>
🎧 and stuffing heavy suitcases into luggage racks.<br/>
🎧 But, I should tell you about our buses,<br/>
🎧 those that are needed for the somewhat more distant holiday destinations.<br/>
🎧 They definitely do not suffer from those problems I just mentioned.<br/>
🎧 We use the services of the famous Sleek Line Company,<br/>
🎧 whose buses are known as the very best.<br/>
🎧 Yes, they are big, yes, they are comfortable,<br/>
🎧 but what makes them especially different is the personal attendant,<br/>
🎧 who accompanies the driver, ready and willing to serve you,<br/>
🎧 and ensure that your trip is the very best.<br/>
🎧 So, whether it's overseas or local, we can certainly give you what you want.<br/>
🎧 Now, do you have any questions?<br/>
🎧 Right, let me orient you to our main EasyTravel office here.<br/>
🎧 On this table right beside us are travel magazines for you to browse through,<br/>
🎧 and on the wall next to that are many more, for all parts of the world.<br/>
🎧 Our four travel consultants sit over there, on the other side of that long counter.<br/>
🎧 That's right, four of them, side by side,<br/>
🎧 all serving various regions.<br/>
🎧 Now, let me tell you their specific functions.<br/>
🎧 Firstly, the consultant on the left, next to the plant,<br/>
🎧 is the 'Local Tours' consultant,<br/>
🎧 serving tours in the immediate vicinity of this city.<br/>
🎧 Next to her is what we call 'Regional Tours',<br/>
🎧 targeting the state-wide options.<br/>
🎧 Next- to her is the 'Interstate-Tours',<br/>
🎧 and that can involve either buses or planes,<br/>
🎧 in the former case, utilising the SleekLine Bus service, as you know.<br/>
🎧 And finally, next to her, in the corner, is 'General Enquiries',<br/>
🎧 which is self-explanatory.<br/>
🎧 If you have questions of a general nature,<br/>
🎧 rather than one relating to specific destinations, you can go there.<br/>
🎧 Now, as I said, we can do international tours,<br/>
🎧 and for that you need our big office, just through that door -<br/> 
🎧 the one between those two plants.<br/>
🎧 However, if your international tour is in the Asian region,<br/>
🎧 which is generally our most popular option,<br/>
🎧 then we deal with that in a separate room<br/> 
🎧 the one opposite International Tours, but not; the corner one.<br/>
🎧 Just go through that door on the left - the one next to that cupboard.<br/>
🎧 The door next to that is, in fact, our General Office,<br/>
🎧 so please don't go through there.<br/>
🎧 That's reserved for staff members only.<br/>

🎧 Hi Liz. How do you feel about starting university here?<br/>
🎧 A little bit nervous, but I'm confident I can handle it.<br/>
🎧 This orientation program seems like it will help us a lot.<br/>
🎧 Sure. I'm looking at the timetable here myself.<br/>
🎧 It seems that there are choices available.<br/>
🎧 I can see.<br/>
🎧 So, what are you going to do Monday afternoon?<br/>
🎧 In the morning we all have the opening lecture,<br/>
🎧 but it looks like we have a choice later that day, as you said.<br/>
🎧 Well, the 'Careers Lecture' might be helpful,<br/>
🎧 but I am interested in the 'Uni Tour'.<br/>
🎧 It's probably too early to be thinking of careers now, anyway,<br/>
🎧 and I want to know what's what at this new university, so I'm doing the tour.<br/>
🎧 Alright. I'll come along with you.<br/>
🎧 Might learn something interesting.<br/>
🎧 After all, we haven't seen much of this place yet,<br/>
🎧 and we will be spending four years here.<br/>
🎧 Tuesday is another full day, too.<br/>
🎧 In the afternoon there's a lecture about study skills,<br/>
🎧 but that morning offers another choice.<br/>
🎧 'Library Tour' or 'Student Union Induction'.<br/>
🎧 What do you think?<br/>
🎧 I think the student union is very important,<br/>
🎧 but we can go there any time, right,<br/>
🎧 so we should take advantage of the library tour while it's being offered.<br/>
🎧 Maybe the week after, you and I can go to the student union.<br/>
🎧 Library it is, then.<br/>
🎧 Now, Wednesday has a free session in the morning,<br/>
🎧 but after lunch there's a choice between visiting the computer lab,<br/>
🎧 or attending a lecture on our legal rights.<br/>
🎧 Well, law and rights are important,<br/>
🎧 but computers are the basis of everything these days,<br/>
🎧 so I'm going to the computer lab.<br/>
🎧 Don't you think knowing our legal rights is equally, if not more, important?<br/>
🎧 We live in a very litigious and complex society now.<br/>
🎧 Sure, but it's something we can pick up later,<br/>
🎧 so let's leave that one out.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Let me see the timetable.<br/>
🎧 Thursday is a free day, and the week winds up with some celebrations on Friday afternoon.<br/>
🎧 It looks like a fun choice, too.<br/>
🎧 There's either a BBQ on the main lawn, or the dance.<br/>
🎧 I never pass up the chance to eat something. What about you?<br/>
🎧 If I can get a free meal, I'll take it any day,<br/>
🎧 and I'm not good at dancing anyway.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's that decided. Right?<br/>
🎧 Right!<br/>
🎧 Guess what Liz?<br/>
🎧 There's another interesting thing in this orientation booklet,<br/>
🎧 and it looks important - about a 'style guide'.<br/>
🎧 What's that?<br/>
🎧 Take a look yourself.<br/>
🎧 It seems to be a set of rules regarding how to present written work -<br/> 
🎧 essays, and that sort of thing - to the lecturers.<br/>
🎧 They want a uniform style of presentation.<br/>
🎧 I can see. So, everything we hand in must have a header and a footer.<br/>
🎧 A what?<br/>
🎧 A header and a footer.<br/>
🎧 The footer is at the bottom of the page, and the header is at the very top.<br/>
🎧 That's why they call it a 'header', you know,<br/>
🎧 that little bit of writing giving details about the work.<br/>
🎧 And they also want the word count.<br/>
🎧 Why do they need that?<br/>
🎧 I guess because the lecturers will specify the number of words they want for their assignment,<br/>
🎧 and they want to be sure students follow this.<br/>
🎧 And even the heading on the page has to be a specific dimension.<br/>
🎧 16 points, and bold print, and underlined.<br/>
🎧 And subheadings are 14 points, and the font has to be Arial for everything.<br/>
🎧 Yes, the main text is Arial, too, as you said, and the size is 12 points,<br/>
🎧 with the header and footer being slightly smaller, at 10 points each.<br/>
🎧 Well, it seems logical.<br/>
🎧 The size of everything is in proportion to its importance,<br/>
🎧 but why do they need the spacing of the main text to be one and a half?<br/>
🎧 The header and footer are different.<br/>
🎧 They're only single-spaced.<br/>
🎧 Probably to allow the teacher to insert comments, or corrections,<br/>
🎧 or just to make it all more readable, I suppose.<br/>
🎧 And we need wide margins on the left, right, top, and bottom,<br/>
🎧 probably for the same reason.<br/>
🎧 Lots of space to allow the addition of comments.<br/>
🎧 That's a bit scary, actually.<br/>
🎧 It seems to assume we will be making mistakes.<br/>
🎧 And look what they want in the header and footer.<br/>
🎧 The header has the name of the work.<br/>
🎧 Not the name of the teacher?<br/>
🎧 No, the work, but surely the teacher's name must go somewhere.<br/>
🎧 Ah, here it is. It goes in the footer.<br/>
🎧 Okay, I'd say this is all logical.<br/>
🎧 If a page is lost, say, falls to the floor,<br/>
🎧 then with all this information, it can always be traced back to the teacher involved.<br/>
🎧 Right - as you say, all very logical.<br/>

🎧 Most of us are familiar with a local park.<br/>
🎧 We spend time there, play there, and have some of our best memories in these places.<br/>
🎧 But what is a park?<br/>
🎧 Basically, it can be defined as a natural, or at least semi-natural, piece of land,<br/>
🎧 planted with a variety of trees, bushes, and flowers,<br/>
🎧 protected and reserved for the enjoyment of all citizens.<br/>
🎧 There are usually regulations about the sorts of behaviour that can take place within.<br/>
🎧 And sometimes there are facilities such as children's playgrounds,<br/>
🎧 or fields for ball games and other sorts of activities.<br/>
🎧 For this reason, if there is grass, it is kept short,<br/>
🎧 and this also discourages the breeding of insect pests.<br/>
🎧 A well-maintained park actually needs a lot of people to look after it,<br/>
🎧 and more so if the park showcases special plants,<br/>
🎧 flowers, or trees, in which case it is called a 'botanic garden'.<br/>
🎧 In complete contrast, if the park is big and remote enough,<br/>
🎧 it is sometimes designated as a wilderness park,<br/>
🎧 to be left completely alone and untouched,<br/>
🎧 protected from all development in order to allow wild species,<br/>
🎧 both plant and animal, to live undisturbed.<br/>
🎧 But it is the urban park - the sort of park that most people are familiar with,<br/>
🎧 that I want to talk about now.<br/>
🎧 These preserve natural landscapes for the pleasure of the urban population,<br/>
🎧 most commonly just for passive recreation<br/> 
🎧 in other words, allowing people just to observe the trees, and lie in the grass,<br/>
🎧 and such passive recreation is certainly needed.<br/>
🎧 Continuing on the subject of parks,<br/>
🎧 it might surprise you to know that once there were none.<br/>
🎧 A thousand years ago, there was no need,<br/>
🎧 since there were already extensive open spaces,<br/>
🎧 forests, and wilderness surrounding most cities and towns - for example, in Europe.<br/>
🎧 These dark dank forests were large and even dangerous,<br/>
🎧 full of wild animals and with the potentially fatal result of getting lost.<br/>
🎧 Hence, fairy tales evolved about witches living in these areas,<br/>
🎧 and the wolves and bears, which could threaten young children.<br/>
🎧 However, with the rapidly increasing human population,<br/>
🎧 the original wilderness and natural open spaces were intruded upon.<br/>
🎧 Forests were cut down as populations spread,<br/>
🎧 and with them, urban pollution and further deforestation.<br/>
🎧 But it was only with the advent of the Industrial Revolution<br/> 
🎧 that people realised natural areas needed to be preserved,<br/>
🎧 to give the populace access to the sort of nature that was fast disappearing<br/> 
🎧 due to the uncontrolled development and demand for resources.<br/>
🎧 The first park, expressly designed for that purpose,<br/>
🎧 is usually considered to be Princes Park in Liverpool.<br/>
🎧 This was in 1841, on land donated to the public by a rich iron merchant.<br/>
🎧 With such a generous donation (worth about £50,000),<br/>
🎧 the council decided to invest £5,000 of its own money in making it look good.<br/>
🎧 Consequently, they hired a landscape designer, Joseph Paxton,<br/>
🎧 who designed twisting turning pathways among shade-giving trees,<br/>
🎧 all based around a central lake.<br/>
🎧 In many ways, it became the prototype for all later large parks,<br/>
🎧 including the famous Central Park in New York.<br/>
🎧 But, if we were to pick the park that most people are familiar with,<br/>
🎧 it would be the much smaller neighbourhood park.<br/>
🎧 These can be tiny, but, by being in the midst of extensive development and dense populations,<br/>
🎧 they are increasingly seen as a refuge,<br/>
🎧 where one can get a glimpse of true nature.<br/>
🎧 Many psychologists now maintain that this glimpse is necessary,<br/>
🎧 for ultimately, as a species, we have an innate affinity for nature,<br/>
🎧 and the concrete urban zoo clashes with our inner being.<br/>
🎧 This has seen the rejuvenation of many urban parks that were once left to decay,<br/>
🎧 for example, in New York or London,<br/>
🎧 and indeed, some cities, such as Melbourne,<br/>
🎧 are known all over the world for their abundance of carefully maintained parks,<br/>
🎧 including a world famous botanic garden.<br/>
