🎧 Well, we have this school excursion</span> planned</span>, but when exactly is it?<br/>
🎧 Is it this Tuesday</span> or Wednesday</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well it can't</span> be Tuesday</span>, with the English tests</span> taking place.<br/>
🎧 Ah, right. Not Tuesday</span>, but Wednesday</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's</span> right -</span> all day Wednesday</span> -</span> taking a bus outside the city</span>.<br/>
🎧 And where are we going?<br/>
🎧 Ah, last month we went to Arthur</span> Island</span>,<br/>
🎧 so this time we're</span> going to the..</span>. Animal</span> Park<br/></span> 
🎧 Arthur</span> Island</span> was okay, but it was too cold</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's</span> hope the weather</span> for this week's</span> excursion</span> is better.<br/>
🎧 I don't</span> suppose</span> animals</span> care</span> about bad weather</span>, but I certainly</span> do.<br/>
🎧 Have you heard the forecast</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, and it's</span> not too bad.<br/>
🎧 Basically</span>, they're</span> saying Monday</span> will be sunny</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good..</span>.<br/>
🎧 But then the weather</span> will change.<br/>
🎧 Not so good.<br/>
🎧 Yes, Tuesday</span> we'll have some showers</span>,<br/>
🎧 but by Wednesday</span>, the day of our excursion</span>, it will be..</span>.<br/>
🎧 well, their words</span> are "cold</span> and cloudy"</span>.<br/>
🎧 Cold</span> and cloudy</span>. Well, as long as it isn't</span> 'wet</span> and rainy'</span>, I'm</span> happy enough.<br/>
🎧 We won't</span> need umbrellas</span>, just warm</span> clothing</span>.<br/>
🎧 And what time will we get there?<br/>
🎧 Let's</span> see. The bus picks</span> us up at 8:30</span> am,<br/>
🎧 and then it's</span> an hour</span> and a half</span> on the road</span>, so we arrive</span> at 10</span> a.m..</span>.<br/>
🎧 sorry, with the 15-minute</span> break</span>, that will actually be 10:15</span> a.m</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's</span> early</span> enough.<br/>
🎧 Then all our students can see the animals</span>, have their fun, and do whatever they want to do.<br/>
🎧 Well, one fun event</span> planned</span> that day is 'Birds</span> of Prey'</span>.<br/>
🎧 What's</span> that?<br/>
🎧 That's</span> when they bring</span> out several</span> birds</span> of prey</span>:<br/>
🎧 eagles</span>, falcons</span>, kites</span>, those sorts</span> of birds</span>,<br/>
🎧 and throw</span> pieces</span> of meat</span> into the air,<br/>
🎧 and the birds</span> swoop</span> down and eat them.<br/>
🎧 It's</span> quite impressive</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sounds great. 'Birds</span> of Prey'</span>.<br/>
🎧 Are there any other activities</span>?<br/>
🎧 There's</span> a catered</span> lunch, at the park</span> restaurant</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've</span> already paid</span> for that, and in the afternoon</span> there's..</span>.<br/>
🎧 well, I had a choice</span> between the 'Reptile</span> Display'</span> and the 'Koala</span> Handling'</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the reptile</span> display</span>, the students can handle</span> live pythons</span> and various</span> other snakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Surely</span> they'd</span> rather hold</span> koalas</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm</span> sure, but the koalas</span> can't</span> be handled</span> unless</span> the weather's</span> sunny</span>, and given</span> the forecast</span>,<br/>
🎧 I thought it better to choose the reptile</span> display</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ummm</span>, that's</span> a shame</span>.<br/>
🎧 These Asian</span> students would love the 'Koala</span> Handling'</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I know, but we can't</span> control</span> the weather</span>.<br/>
🎧 And, then we get back. What time will that be?<br/>
🎧 We leave the park</span> at 4:30</span>, but then we face</span> traffic</span>,<br/>
🎧 so we won't</span> get back until well after 6</span> pm.<br/>
🎧 It will most likely</span> be 6:30</span>.<br/>
🎧 But that's</span> better than the last trip</span>: we didn't</span> get home until 8:30</span> that time.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that was a bit too late</span>, wasn't</span> it?<br/>
🎧 Andrew</span>, I understand</span> you've</span> been doing some research</span> regarding</span> the breakdown</span>, by nationality</span> of our student body</span>.<br/>
🎧 That must've produced</span> some interesting</span> results</span>.<br/>
🎧 You're</span> right. I got some statistics</span> from head</span> office</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would imagine</span> that most of our students are either Japanese</span> or Chinese</span>.<br/>
🎧 You imagine</span> right.<br/>
🎧 But it's</span> the Chinese</span> who constitute</span> the majority</span>, but only just.<br/>
🎧 I had thought Koreans</span> might be second,<br/>
🎧 but it's</span> actually the Japanese</span>, quite close</span> behind.<br/>
🎧 It's</span> somewhat</span> surprising</span>, but obviously</span> all those Study</span> Tours</span> that our university markets</span> in Japan</span> are bringing</span> in students.<br/>
🎧 What's</span> the breakdown</span> exactly?<br/>
🎧 Japanese</span> are a quarter</span> of the whole, which is considerable</span>.<br/>
🎧 Last year they were only 16%</span>, so that market</span> has grown</span> nicely</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ah, the only other proportions</span> of some weight</span> are the Indonesians</span> and Koreans</span> -</span> about the same.<br/>
🎧 Indonesians</span> at 15%</span>, and..</span>.<br/>
🎧 the Koreans</span> are a little higher</span> -<br/></span> 
🎧 not like last year when they were less than 10%</span>.<br/>
🎧 I thought we'd</span> have more Indonesians</span> than Koreans</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, as I said, they're</span> about the same<br/></span> 
🎧 just like the Saudi</span> and Thai</span> student numbers</span>, almost the same also -<br/></span> 
🎧 both just under 10</span>.<br/>
🎧 Which one is bigger</span>?<br/>
🎧 Thai</span> students number just a fraction</span> more.<br/>
🎧 As for the other nationalities</span>, collectively</span> they're</span> only 3%</span>,<br/>
🎧 so it wasn't</span> worth</span> giving</span> each of them a separate</span> category</span>.<br/>
🎧 I just grouped</span> them under 'other'<br/></span> 
🎧 that's</span> Vietnamese</span>, South</span> American</span>, a couple</span> of Russians</span>, and so on.<br/>
<br/><br/>

🎧 Hello everyone.<br/>
🎧 Now, you're</span> here because you're</span> interested in travel, right?<br/>
🎧 And you're</span> in the right place,<br/>
🎧 for at EasyTravel</span>, we have the best deals</span> for the best locations</span>.<br/>
🎧 We specialise</span> in eco-travel</span>,<br/>
🎧 or holidays</span> designed</span> to get you amongst</span> nature</span>,<br/>
🎧 ignoring</span> the hustle</span> and bustle</span> of big cities</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, whether</span> you want to hike</span> in Nepal</span>, as many people do,<br/>
🎧 or follow</span> some jungle</span> paths</span> in the rainforests</span> of Queensland</span>,<br/>
🎧 we can give you the best deal</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you look at our office</span> here, you'll</span> see our overseas</span> consultants</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's</span> for trips</span> overseas</span>, obviously</span>, to Europe</span>, to North</span> America</span>,<br/>
🎧 but primarily</span> for the Asian</span> market</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is generally</span> more popular</span> in this part</span> of the world</span>.<br/>
🎧 Most people like that touch of the Orient</span>, right?<br/>
🎧 But they also like the domestic</span> market</span>,<br/>
🎧 since this country</span> offers</span> its fair</span> share of beautiful</span> natural</span> vistas</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about the deserts</span>, anyone</span>?<br/>
🎧 What about some striking</span> red-rock</span> gorges</span>?<br/>
🎧 Then, talk to our domestic</span> consultants</span>, who can arrange</span> anything you want.<br/>
🎧 But they deal</span> with the accounts</span> in the morning,<br/>
🎧 so you'll</span> need to talk to them in the afternoon</span>.<br/>
🎧 And remember, our office</span> doesn't</span> open at night</span>, sorry to say.<br/>
🎧 Now, around the outskirts</span> and outer</span> regions</span> of this city</span>,<br/>
🎧 there are many beautiful</span> places</span> that you might not be aware</span> of.<br/>
🎧 And the advantages</span> of these regional</span> locations</span> are many.<br/>
🎧 Mostly</span>, by being closer</span>, some of them can be done in a day tour</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's</span> fast</span> and convenient</span>, with none</span> of those long-haul</span> bus trips<br/></span> 
🎧 which often leave you cramped</span> and uncomfortable</span>,<br/>
🎧 and stuffing</span> heavy</span> suitcases</span> into luggage</span> racks</span>.<br/>
🎧 But, I should tell you about our buses</span>,<br/>
🎧 those that are needed</span> for the somewhat</span> more distant</span> holiday</span> destinations</span>.<br/>
🎧 They definitely do not suffer</span> from those problems</span> I just mentioned</span>.<br/>
🎧 We use the services</span> of the famous Sleek</span> Line</span> Company,<br/>
🎧 whose buses</span> are known</span> as the very best.<br/>
🎧 Yes, they are big, yes, they are comfortable</span>,<br/>
🎧 but what makes them especially</span> different is the personal attendant</span>,<br/>
🎧 who accompanies</span> the driver</span>, ready and willing</span> to serve</span> you,<br/>
🎧 and ensure</span> that your trip</span> is the very best.<br/>
🎧 So, whether</span> it's</span> overseas</span> or local</span>, we can certainly</span> give you what you want.<br/>
🎧 Now, do you have any questions</span>?<br/>
🎧 Right, let me orient</span> you to our main</span> EasyTravel</span> office</span> here.<br/>
🎧 On this table</span> right beside</span> us are travel magazines</span> for you to browse</span> through,<br/>
🎧 and on the wall</span> next to that are many more, for all parts</span> of the world</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our four</span> travel consultants</span> sit over there, on the other side of that long counter</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's</span> right, four</span> of them, side by side,<br/>
🎧 all serving</span> various</span> regions</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, let me tell you their specific</span> functions</span>.<br/>
🎧 Firstly</span>, the consultant</span> on the left</span>, next to the plant</span>,<br/>
🎧 is the 'Local</span> Tours'</span> consultant</span>,<br/>
🎧 serving</span> tours</span> in the immediate</span> vicinity</span> of this city</span>.<br/>
🎧 Next to her is what we call 'Regional</span> Tours'</span>,<br/>
🎧 targeting</span> the state-wide</span> options.<br/>
🎧 Next-</span> to her is the 'Interstate-Tours'</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that can involve</span> either buses</span> or planes</span>,<br/>
🎧 in the former</span> case, utilising</span> the SleekLine</span> Bus service</span>, as you know.<br/>
🎧 And finally, next to her, in the corner</span>, is 'General</span> Enquiries'</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is self-explanatory</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you have questions</span> of a general</span> nature</span>,<br/>
🎧 rather than one relating</span> to specific</span> destinations</span>, you can go there.<br/>
🎧 Now, as I said, we can do international</span> tours</span>,<br/>
🎧 and for that you need our big office</span>, just through that door</span> -<br/></span> 
🎧 the one between those two plants</span>.<br/>
🎧 However</span>, if your international</span> tour</span> is in the Asian</span> region</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is generally</span> our most popular</span> option,<br/>
🎧 then we deal</span> with that in a separate</span> room<br/></span> 
🎧 the one opposite</span> International</span> Tours</span>, but not;</span> the corner</span> one.<br/>
🎧 Just go through that door</span> on the left</span> -</span> the one next to that cupboard</span>.<br/>
🎧 The door</span> next to that is, in fact</span>, our General</span> Office</span>,<br/>
🎧 so please don't</span> go through there.<br/>
🎧 That's</span> reserved</span> for staff</span> members</span> only.<br/>

🎧 Hi Liz</span>. How do you feel about starting</span> university here?<br/>
🎧 A little bit nervous</span>, but I'm</span> confident</span> I can handle</span> it.<br/>
🎧 This orientation</span> program</span> seems</span> like it will help us a lot.<br/>
🎧 Sure. I'm</span> looking at the timetable</span> here myself.<br/>
🎧 It seems</span> that there are choices</span> available</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can see.<br/>
🎧 So, what are you going to do Monday</span> afternoon</span>?<br/>
🎧 In the morning we all have the opening</span> lecture</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it looks like we have a choice</span> later that day, as you said.<br/>
🎧 Well, the 'Careers</span> Lecture'</span> might be helpful</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I am interested in the 'Uni</span> Tour'</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's</span> probably too early</span> to be thinking of careers</span> now, anyway</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I want to know what's</span> what at this new university, so I'm</span> doing the tour</span>.<br/>
🎧 Alright. I'll</span> come along with you.<br/>
🎧 Might learn something interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 After all, we haven't</span> seen</span> much of this place yet,<br/>
🎧 and we will be spending four</span> years here.<br/>
🎧 Tuesday</span> is another full day, too.<br/>
🎧 In the afternoon</span> there's</span> a lecture</span> about study</span> skills</span>,<br/>
🎧 but that morning offers</span> another choice</span>.<br/>
🎧 'Library</span> Tour'</span> or 'Student</span> Union</span> Induction'</span>.<br/>
🎧 What do you think?<br/>
🎧 I think the student union</span> is very important,<br/>
🎧 but we can go there any time, right,<br/>
🎧 so we should take advantage</span> of the library</span> tour</span> while it's</span> being offered</span>.<br/>
🎧 Maybe the week after, you and I can go to the student union</span>.<br/>
🎧 Library</span> it is, then.<br/>
🎧 Now, Wednesday</span> has a free session</span> in the morning,<br/>
🎧 but after lunch there's</span> a choice</span> between visiting</span> the computer</span> lab</span>,<br/>
🎧 or attending</span> a lecture</span> on our legal</span> rights</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, law and rights</span> are important,<br/>
🎧 but computers</span> are the basis</span> of everything these days</span>,<br/>
🎧 so I'm</span> going to the computer</span> lab</span>.<br/>
🎧 Don't</span> you think knowing</span> our legal</span> rights</span> is equally</span>, if not more, important?<br/>
🎧 We live in a very litigious</span> and complex</span> society</span> now.<br/>
🎧 Sure, but it's</span> something we can pick</span> up later,<br/>
🎧 so let's</span> leave that one out.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Let me see the timetable</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thursday</span> is a free day, and the week winds</span> up with some celebrations</span> on Friday</span> afternoon</span>.<br/>
🎧 It looks like a fun choice</span>, too.<br/>
🎧 There's</span> either a BBQ</span> on the main</span> lawn</span>, or the dance</span>.<br/>
🎧 I never pass</span> up the chance</span> to eat something. What about you?<br/>
🎧 If I can get a free meal</span>, I'll</span> take it any day,<br/>
🎧 and I'm</span> not good at dancing</span> anyway</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's</span> that decided</span>. Right?<br/>
🎧 Right!<br/>
🎧 Guess</span> what Liz</span>?<br/>
🎧 There's</span> another interesting</span> thing in this orientation</span> booklet</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it looks important -</span> about a 'style</span> guide'</span>.<br/>
🎧 What's</span> that?<br/>
🎧 Take a look yourself.<br/>
🎧 It seems</span> to be a set of rules</span> regarding</span> how to present</span> written</span> work -<br/></span> 
🎧 essays</span>, and that sort</span> of thing -</span> to the lecturers</span>.<br/>
🎧 They want a uniform</span> style</span> of presentation</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can see. So, everything we hand</span> in must have a header</span> and a footer</span>.<br/>
🎧 A what?<br/>
🎧 A header</span> and a footer</span>.<br/>
🎧 The footer</span> is at the bottom</span> of the page</span>, and the header</span> is at the very top.<br/>
🎧 That's</span> why they call it a 'header'</span>, you know,<br/>
🎧 that little bit of writing</span> giving</span> details</span> about the work.<br/>
🎧 And they also want the word</span> count</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why do they need that?<br/>
🎧 I guess</span> because the lecturers</span> will specify</span> the number of words</span> they want for their assignment</span>,<br/>
🎧 and they want to be sure students follow</span> this.<br/>
🎧 And even the heading</span> on the page</span> has to be a specific</span> dimension</span>.<br/>
🎧 16</span> points</span>, and bold</span> print</span>, and underlined</span>.<br/>
🎧 And subheadings</span> are 14</span> points</span>, and the font</span> has to be Arial</span> for everything.<br/>
🎧 Yes, the main</span> text</span> is Arial</span>, too, as you said, and the size is 12</span> points</span>,<br/>
🎧 with the header</span> and footer</span> being slightly</span> smaller</span>, at 10</span> points</span> each.<br/>
🎧 Well, it seems</span> logical</span>.<br/>
🎧 The size of everything is in proportion</span> to its importance</span>,<br/>
🎧 but why do they need the spacing</span> of the main</span> text</span> to be one and a half</span>?<br/>
🎧 The header</span> and footer</span> are different.<br/>
🎧 They're</span> only single-spaced</span>.<br/>
🎧 Probably to allow</span> the teacher</span> to insert</span> comments</span>, or corrections</span>,<br/>
🎧 or just to make it all more readable</span>, I suppose</span>.<br/>
🎧 And we need wide</span> margins</span> on the left</span>, right, top, and bottom</span>,<br/>
🎧 probably for the same reason</span>.<br/>
🎧 Lots of space</span> to allow</span> the addition</span> of comments</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's</span> a bit scary</span>, actually.<br/>
🎧 It seems</span> to assume</span> we will be making</span> mistakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 And look what they want in the header</span> and footer</span>.<br/>
🎧 The header</span> has the name of the work.<br/>
🎧 Not the name of the teacher</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, the work, but surely</span> the teacher's</span> name must go somewhere.<br/>
🎧 Ah, here it is. It goes</span> in the footer</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, I'd</span> say this is all logical</span>.<br/>
🎧 If a page</span> is lost</span>, say, falls</span> to the floor</span>,<br/>
🎧 then with all this information</span>, it can always be traced</span> back to the teacher</span> involved</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right -</span> as you say, all very logical</span>.<br/>

🎧 Most of us are familiar</span> with a local</span> park</span>.<br/>
🎧 We spend</span> time there, play there, and have some of our best memories</span> in these places</span>.<br/>
🎧 But what is a park</span>?<br/>
🎧 Basically</span>, it can be defined</span> as a natural</span>, or at least</span> semi-natural</span>, piece</span> of land</span>,<br/>
🎧 planted</span> with a variety</span> of trees</span>, bushes</span>, and flowers</span>,<br/>
🎧 protected</span> and reserved</span> for the enjoyment</span> of all citizens</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are usually regulations</span> about the sorts</span> of behaviour</span> that can take place within</span>.<br/>
🎧 And sometimes there are facilities</span> such as children's</span> playgrounds</span>,<br/>
🎧 or fields</span> for ball</span> games</span> and other sorts</span> of activities</span>.<br/>
🎧 For this reason</span>, if there is grass</span>, it is kept</span> short,<br/>
🎧 and this also discourages</span> the breeding</span> of insect</span> pests</span>.<br/>
🎧 A well-maintained</span> park</span> actually needs a lot of people to look after it,<br/>
🎧 and more so if the park</span> showcases</span> special plants</span>,<br/>
🎧 flowers</span>, or trees</span>, in which case it is called a 'botanic</span> garden'</span>.<br/>
🎧 In complete</span> contrast</span>, if the park</span> is big and remote</span> enough,<br/>
🎧 it is sometimes designated</span> as a wilderness</span> park</span>,<br/>
🎧 to be left</span> completely</span> alone</span> and untouched</span>,<br/>
🎧 protected</span> from all development</span> in order to allow</span> wild</span> species</span>,<br/>
🎧 both plant</span> and animal</span>, to live undisturbed</span>.<br/>
🎧 But it is the urban</span> park</span> -</span> the sort</span> of park</span> that most people are familiar</span> with,<br/>
🎧 that I want to talk about now.<br/>
🎧 These preserve</span> natural</span> landscapes</span> for the pleasure</span> of the urban</span> population</span>,<br/>
🎧 most commonly</span> just for passive</span> recreation<br/></span> 
🎧 in other words</span>, allowing</span> people just to observe</span> the trees</span>, and lie</span> in the grass</span>,<br/>
🎧 and such passive</span> recreation</span> is certainly</span> needed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Continuing</span> on the subject</span> of parks</span>,<br/>
🎧 it might surprise</span> you to know that once there were none</span>.<br/>
🎧 A thousand</span> years ago, there was no need,<br/>
🎧 since there were already extensive</span> open spaces</span>,<br/>
🎧 forests</span>, and wilderness</span> surrounding</span> most cities</span> and towns</span> -</span> for example, in Europe</span>.<br/>
🎧 These dark</span> dank</span> forests</span> were large and even dangerous</span>,<br/>
🎧 full of wild</span> animals</span> and with the potentially</span> fatal</span> result</span> of getting lost</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hence</span>, fairy</span> tales</span> evolved</span> about witches</span> living in these areas</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the wolves</span> and bears</span>, which could threaten</span> young children.<br/>
🎧 However</span>, with the rapidly</span> increasing</span> human</span> population</span>,<br/>
🎧 the original</span> wilderness</span> and natural</span> open spaces</span> were intruded</span> upon</span>.<br/>
🎧 Forests</span> were cut down as populations</span> spread</span>,<br/>
🎧 and with them, urban</span> pollution</span> and further</span> deforestation</span>.<br/>
🎧 But it was only with the advent</span> of the Industrial</span> Revolution<br/></span> 
🎧 that people realised</span> natural</span> areas</span> needed</span> to be preserved</span>,<br/>
🎧 to give the populace</span> access</span> to the sort</span> of nature</span> that was fast</span> disappearing<br/></span> 
🎧 due</span> to the uncontrolled</span> development</span> and demand</span> for resources</span>.<br/>
🎧 The first park</span>, expressly</span> designed</span> for that purpose</span>,<br/>
🎧 is usually considered</span> to be Princes</span> Park</span> in Liverpool</span>.<br/>
🎧 This was in 1841</span>, on land</span> donated</span> to the public</span> by a rich</span> iron</span> merchant</span>.<br/>
🎧 With such a generous</span> donation</span> (worth</span> about £50,000)</span>,<br/>
🎧 the council</span> decided</span> to invest</span> £5,000</span> of its own money in making</span> it look good.<br/>
🎧 Consequently</span>, they hired</span> a landscape</span> designer</span>, Joseph</span> Paxton</span>,<br/>
🎧 who designed</span> twisting</span> turning</span> pathways</span> among</span> shade-giving</span> trees</span>,<br/>
🎧 all based</span> around a central</span> lake</span>.<br/>
🎧 In many ways</span>, it became</span> the prototype</span> for all later large parks</span>,<br/>
🎧 including</span> the famous Central</span> Park</span> in New York</span>.<br/>
🎧 But, if we were to pick</span> the park</span> that most people are familiar</span> with,<br/>
🎧 it would be the much smaller</span> neighbourhood</span> park</span>.<br/>
🎧 These can be tiny</span>, but, by being in the midst</span> of extensive</span> development</span> and dense</span> populations</span>,<br/>
🎧 they are increasingly</span> seen</span> as a refuge</span>,<br/>
🎧 where one can get a glimpse</span> of true</span> nature</span>.<br/>
🎧 Many psychologists</span> now maintain</span> that this glimpse</span> is necessary</span>,<br/>
🎧 for ultimately</span>, as a species</span>, we have an innate</span> affinity</span> for nature</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the concrete</span> urban</span> zoo clashes</span> with our inner</span> being.<br/>
🎧 This has seen</span> the rejuvenation</span> of many urban</span> parks</span> that were once left</span> to decay</span>,<br/>
🎧 for example, in New York</span> or London</span>,<br/>
🎧 and indeed</span>, some cities</span>, such as Melbourne</span>,<br/>
🎧 are known</span> all over the world</span> for their abundance</span> of carefully</span> maintained</span> parks</span>,<br/>
🎧 including</span> a world</span> famous botanic</span> garden.<br/>
