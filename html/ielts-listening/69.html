🎧 Well, we have this school <span>excursion</span> <span>planned</span>, but when exactly is it?<br/>
🎧 Is it this <span>Tuesday</span> or <span>Wednesday</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well it <span>can't</span> be <span>Tuesday</span>, with the English <span>tests</span> taking place.<br/>
🎧 Ah, right. Not <span>Tuesday</span>, but <span>Wednesday</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>That's</span> right <span>-</span> all day <span>Wednesday</span> <span>-</span> taking a bus outside the <span>city</span>.<br/>
🎧 And where are we going?<br/>
🎧 Ah, last month we went to <span>Arthur</span> <span>Island</span>,<br/>
🎧 so this time <span>we're</span> going to <span>the..</span>. <span>Animal</span> <span>Park<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Arthur</span> <span>Island</span> was okay, but it was too <span>cold</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Let's</span> hope the <span>weather</span> for this <span>week's</span> <span>excursion</span> is better.<br/>
🎧 I <span>don't</span> <span>suppose</span> <span>animals</span> <span>care</span> about bad <span>weather</span>, but I <span>certainly</span> do.<br/>
🎧 Have you heard the <span>forecast</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, and <span>it's</span> not too bad.<br/>
🎧 <span>Basically</span>, <span>they're</span> saying <span>Monday</span> will be <span>sunny</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Good..</span>.<br/>
🎧 But then the <span>weather</span> will change.<br/>
🎧 Not so good.<br/>
🎧 Yes, <span>Tuesday</span> we'll have some <span>showers</span>,<br/>
🎧 but by <span>Wednesday</span>, the day of our <span>excursion</span>, it will <span>be..</span>.<br/>
🎧 well, their <span>words</span> are <span>"cold</span> and <span>cloudy"</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Cold</span> and <span>cloudy</span>. Well, as long as it <span>isn't</span> <span>'wet</span> and <span>rainy'</span>, <span>I'm</span> happy enough.<br/>
🎧 We <span>won't</span> need <span>umbrellas</span>, just <span>warm</span> <span>clothing</span>.<br/>
🎧 And what time will we get there?<br/>
🎧 <span>Let's</span> see. The bus <span>picks</span> us up at <span>8:30</span> am,<br/>
🎧 and then <span>it's</span> an <span>hour</span> and a <span>half</span> on the <span>road</span>, so we <span>arrive</span> at <span>10</span> <span>a.m..</span>.<br/>
🎧 sorry, with the <span>15-minute</span> <span>break</span>, that will actually be <span>10:15</span> <span>a.m</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>That's</span> <span>early</span> enough.<br/>
🎧 Then all our students can see the <span>animals</span>, have their fun, and do whatever they want to do.<br/>
🎧 Well, one fun <span>event</span> <span>planned</span> that day is <span>'Birds</span> of <span>Prey'</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>What's</span> that?<br/>
🎧 <span>That's</span> when they <span>bring</span> out <span>several</span> <span>birds</span> of <span>prey</span>:<br/>
🎧 <span>eagles</span>, <span>falcons</span>, <span>kites</span>, those <span>sorts</span> of <span>birds</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>throw</span> <span>pieces</span> of <span>meat</span> into the air,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>birds</span> <span>swoop</span> down and eat them.<br/>
🎧 <span>It's</span> quite <span>impressive</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sounds great. <span>'Birds</span> of <span>Prey'</span>.<br/>
🎧 Are there any other <span>activities</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>There's</span> a <span>catered</span> lunch, at the <span>park</span> <span>restaurant</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>We've</span> already <span>paid</span> for that, and in the <span>afternoon</span> <span>there's..</span>.<br/>
🎧 well, I had a <span>choice</span> between the <span>'Reptile</span> <span>Display'</span> and the <span>'Koala</span> <span>Handling'</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>reptile</span> <span>display</span>, the students can <span>handle</span> live <span>pythons</span> and <span>various</span> other <span>snakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Surely</span> <span>they'd</span> rather <span>hold</span> <span>koalas</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>I'm</span> sure, but the <span>koalas</span> <span>can't</span> be <span>handled</span> <span>unless</span> the <span>weather's</span> <span>sunny</span>, and <span>given</span> the <span>forecast</span>,<br/>
🎧 I thought it better to choose the <span>reptile</span> <span>display</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ummm</span>, <span>that's</span> a <span>shame</span>.<br/>
🎧 These <span>Asian</span> students would love the <span>'Koala</span> <span>Handling'</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I know, but we <span>can't</span> <span>control</span> the <span>weather</span>.<br/>
🎧 And, then we get back. What time will that be?<br/>
🎧 We leave the <span>park</span> at <span>4:30</span>, but then we <span>face</span> <span>traffic</span>,<br/>
🎧 so we <span>won't</span> get back until well after <span>6</span> pm.<br/>
🎧 It will most <span>likely</span> be <span>6:30</span>.<br/>
🎧 But <span>that's</span> better than the last <span>trip</span>: we <span>didn't</span> get home until <span>8:30</span> that time.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that was a bit too <span>late</span>, <span>wasn't</span> it?<br/>
🎧 <span>Andrew</span>, I <span>understand</span> <span>you've</span> been doing some <span>research</span> <span>regarding</span> the <span>breakdown</span>, by <span>nationality</span> of our student <span>body</span>.<br/>
🎧 That must've <span>produced</span> some <span>interesting</span> <span>results</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>You're</span> right. I got some <span>statistics</span> from <span>head</span> <span>office</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would <span>imagine</span> that most of our students are either <span>Japanese</span> or <span>Chinese</span>.<br/>
🎧 You <span>imagine</span> right.<br/>
🎧 But <span>it's</span> the <span>Chinese</span> who <span>constitute</span> the <span>majority</span>, but only just.<br/>
🎧 I had thought <span>Koreans</span> might be second,<br/>
🎧 but <span>it's</span> actually the <span>Japanese</span>, quite <span>close</span> behind.<br/>
🎧 <span>It's</span> <span>somewhat</span> <span>surprising</span>, but <span>obviously</span> all those <span>Study</span> <span>Tours</span> that our university <span>markets</span> in <span>Japan</span> are <span>bringing</span> in students.<br/>
🎧 <span>What's</span> the <span>breakdown</span> exactly?<br/>
🎧 <span>Japanese</span> are a <span>quarter</span> of the whole, which is <span>considerable</span>.<br/>
🎧 Last year they were only <span>16%</span>, so that <span>market</span> has <span>grown</span> <span>nicely</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ah, the only other <span>proportions</span> of some <span>weight</span> are the <span>Indonesians</span> and <span>Koreans</span> <span>-</span> about the same.<br/>
🎧 <span>Indonesians</span> at <span>15%</span>, <span>and..</span>.<br/>
🎧 the <span>Koreans</span> are a little <span>higher</span> <span>-<br/></span> 
🎧 not like last year when they were less than <span>10%</span>.<br/>
🎧 I thought <span>we'd</span> have more <span>Indonesians</span> than <span>Koreans</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, as I said, <span>they're</span> about the <span>same<br/></span> 
🎧 just like the <span>Saudi</span> and <span>Thai</span> student <span>numbers</span>, almost the same also <span>-<br/></span> 
🎧 both just under <span>10</span>.<br/>
🎧 Which one is <span>bigger</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Thai</span> students number just a <span>fraction</span> more.<br/>
🎧 As for the other <span>nationalities</span>, <span>collectively</span> <span>they're</span> only <span>3%</span>,<br/>
🎧 so it <span>wasn't</span> <span>worth</span> <span>giving</span> each of them a <span>separate</span> <span>category</span>.<br/>
🎧 I just <span>grouped</span> them under <span>'other'<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>that's</span> <span>Vietnamese</span>, <span>South</span> <span>American</span>, a <span>couple</span> of <span>Russians</span>, and so on.<br/>

🎧 Hello everyone.<br/>
🎧 Now, <span>you're</span> here because <span>you're</span> interested in travel, right?<br/>
🎧 And <span>you're</span> in the right place,<br/>
🎧 for at <span>EasyTravel</span>, we have the best <span>deals</span> for the best <span>locations</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>specialise</span> in <span>eco-travel</span>,<br/>
🎧 or <span>holidays</span> <span>designed</span> to get you <span>amongst</span> <span>nature</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>ignoring</span> the <span>hustle</span> and <span>bustle</span> of big <span>cities</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, <span>whether</span> you want to <span>hike</span> in <span>Nepal</span>, as many people do,<br/>
🎧 or <span>follow</span> some <span>jungle</span> <span>paths</span> in the <span>rainforests</span> of <span>Queensland</span>,<br/>
🎧 we can give you the best <span>deal</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you look at our <span>office</span> here, <span>you'll</span> see our <span>overseas</span> <span>consultants</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>That's</span> for <span>trips</span> <span>overseas</span>, <span>obviously</span>, to <span>Europe</span>, to <span>North</span> <span>America</span>,<br/>
🎧 but <span>primarily</span> for the <span>Asian</span> <span>market</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is <span>generally</span> more <span>popular</span> in this <span>part</span> of the <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 Most people like that touch of the <span>Orient</span>, right?<br/>
🎧 But they also like the <span>domestic</span> <span>market</span>,<br/>
🎧 since this <span>country</span> <span>offers</span> its <span>fair</span> share of <span>beautiful</span> <span>natural</span> <span>vistas</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about the <span>deserts</span>, <span>anyone</span>?<br/>
🎧 What about some <span>striking</span> <span>red-rock</span> <span>gorges</span>?<br/>
🎧 Then, talk to our <span>domestic</span> <span>consultants</span>, who can <span>arrange</span> anything you want.<br/>
🎧 But they <span>deal</span> with the <span>accounts</span> in the morning,<br/>
🎧 so <span>you'll</span> need to talk to them in the <span>afternoon</span>.<br/>
🎧 And remember, our <span>office</span> <span>doesn't</span> open at <span>night</span>, sorry to say.<br/>
🎧 Now, around the <span>outskirts</span> and <span>outer</span> <span>regions</span> of this <span>city</span>,<br/>
🎧 there are many <span>beautiful</span> <span>places</span> that you might not be <span>aware</span> of.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>advantages</span> of these <span>regional</span> <span>locations</span> are many.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mostly</span>, by being <span>closer</span>, some of them can be done in a day <span>tour</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, <span>it's</span> <span>fast</span> and <span>convenient</span>, with <span>none</span> of those <span>long-haul</span> bus <span>trips<br/></span> 
🎧 which often leave you <span>cramped</span> and <span>uncomfortable</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>stuffing</span> <span>heavy</span> <span>suitcases</span> into <span>luggage</span> <span>racks</span>.<br/>
🎧 But, I should tell you about our <span>buses</span>,<br/>
🎧 those that are <span>needed</span> for the <span>somewhat</span> more <span>distant</span> <span>holiday</span> <span>destinations</span>.<br/>
🎧 They definitely do not <span>suffer</span> from those <span>problems</span> I just <span>mentioned</span>.<br/>
🎧 We use the <span>services</span> of the famous <span>Sleek</span> <span>Line</span> Company,<br/>
🎧 whose <span>buses</span> are <span>known</span> as the very best.<br/>
🎧 Yes, they are big, yes, they are <span>comfortable</span>,<br/>
🎧 but what makes them <span>especially</span> different is the personal <span>attendant</span>,<br/>
🎧 who <span>accompanies</span> the <span>driver</span>, ready and <span>willing</span> to <span>serve</span> you,<br/>
🎧 and <span>ensure</span> that your <span>trip</span> is the very best.<br/>
🎧 So, <span>whether</span> <span>it's</span> <span>overseas</span> or <span>local</span>, we can <span>certainly</span> give you what you want.<br/>
🎧 Now, do you have any <span>questions</span>?<br/>
🎧 Right, let me <span>orient</span> you to our <span>main</span> <span>EasyTravel</span> <span>office</span> here.<br/>
🎧 On this <span>table</span> right <span>beside</span> us are travel <span>magazines</span> for you to <span>browse</span> through,<br/>
🎧 and on the <span>wall</span> next to that are many more, for all <span>parts</span> of the <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>four</span> travel <span>consultants</span> sit over there, on the other side of that long <span>counter</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>That's</span> right, <span>four</span> of them, side by side,<br/>
🎧 all <span>serving</span> <span>various</span> <span>regions</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, let me tell you their <span>specific</span> <span>functions</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Firstly</span>, the <span>consultant</span> on the <span>left</span>, next to the <span>plant</span>,<br/>
🎧 is the <span>'Local</span> <span>Tours'</span> <span>consultant</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>serving</span> <span>tours</span> in the <span>immediate</span> <span>vicinity</span> of this <span>city</span>.<br/>
🎧 Next to her is what we call <span>'Regional</span> <span>Tours'</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>targeting</span> the <span>state-wide</span> options.<br/>
🎧 <span>Next-</span> to her is the <span>'Interstate-Tours'</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that can <span>involve</span> either <span>buses</span> or <span>planes</span>,<br/>
🎧 in the <span>former</span> case, <span>utilising</span> the <span>SleekLine</span> Bus <span>service</span>, as you know.<br/>
🎧 And finally, next to her, in the <span>corner</span>, is <span>'General</span> <span>Enquiries'</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is <span>self-explanatory</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you have <span>questions</span> of a <span>general</span> <span>nature</span>,<br/>
🎧 rather than one <span>relating</span> to <span>specific</span> <span>destinations</span>, you can go there.<br/>
🎧 Now, as I said, we can do <span>international</span> <span>tours</span>,<br/>
🎧 and for that you need our big <span>office</span>, just through that <span>door</span> <span>-<br/></span> 
🎧 the one between those two <span>plants</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, if your <span>international</span> <span>tour</span> is in the <span>Asian</span> <span>region</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is <span>generally</span> our most <span>popular</span> option,<br/>
🎧 then we <span>deal</span> with that in a <span>separate</span> <span>room<br/></span> 
🎧 the one <span>opposite</span> <span>International</span> <span>Tours</span>, but <span>not;</span> the <span>corner</span> one.<br/>
🎧 Just go through that <span>door</span> on the <span>left</span> <span>-</span> the one next to that <span>cupboard</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>door</span> next to that is, in <span>fact</span>, our <span>General</span> <span>Office</span>,<br/>
🎧 so please <span>don't</span> go through there.<br/>
🎧 <span>That's</span> <span>reserved</span> for <span>staff</span> <span>members</span> only.<br/>

🎧 Hi <span>Liz</span>. How do you feel about <span>starting</span> university here?<br/>
🎧 A little bit <span>nervous</span>, but <span>I'm</span> <span>confident</span> I can <span>handle</span> it.<br/>
🎧 This <span>orientation</span> <span>program</span> <span>seems</span> like it will help us a lot.<br/>
🎧 Sure. <span>I'm</span> looking at the <span>timetable</span> here myself.<br/>
🎧 It <span>seems</span> that there are <span>choices</span> <span>available</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can see.<br/>
🎧 So, what are you going to do <span>Monday</span> <span>afternoon</span>?<br/>
🎧 In the morning we all have the <span>opening</span> <span>lecture</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it looks like we have a <span>choice</span> later that day, as you said.<br/>
🎧 Well, the <span>'Careers</span> <span>Lecture'</span> might be <span>helpful</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I am interested in the <span>'Uni</span> <span>Tour'</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>It's</span> probably too <span>early</span> to be thinking of <span>careers</span> now, <span>anyway</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I want to know <span>what's</span> what at this new university, so <span>I'm</span> doing the <span>tour</span>.<br/>
🎧 Alright. <span>I'll</span> come along with you.<br/>
🎧 Might learn something <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 After all, we <span>haven't</span> <span>seen</span> much of this place yet,<br/>
🎧 and we will be spending <span>four</span> years here.<br/>
🎧 <span>Tuesday</span> is another full day, too.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>afternoon</span> <span>there's</span> a <span>lecture</span> about <span>study</span> <span>skills</span>,<br/>
🎧 but that morning <span>offers</span> another <span>choice</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>'Library</span> <span>Tour'</span> or <span>'Student</span> <span>Union</span> <span>Induction'</span>.<br/>
🎧 What do you think?<br/>
🎧 I think the student <span>union</span> is very important,<br/>
🎧 but we can go there any time, right,<br/>
🎧 so we should take <span>advantage</span> of the <span>library</span> <span>tour</span> while <span>it's</span> being <span>offered</span>.<br/>
🎧 Maybe the week after, you and I can go to the student <span>union</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Library</span> it is, then.<br/>
🎧 Now, <span>Wednesday</span> has a free <span>session</span> in the morning,<br/>
🎧 but after lunch <span>there's</span> a <span>choice</span> between <span>visiting</span> the <span>computer</span> <span>lab</span>,<br/>
🎧 or <span>attending</span> a <span>lecture</span> on our <span>legal</span> <span>rights</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, law and <span>rights</span> are important,<br/>
🎧 but <span>computers</span> are the <span>basis</span> of everything these <span>days</span>,<br/>
🎧 so <span>I'm</span> going to the <span>computer</span> <span>lab</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Don't</span> you think <span>knowing</span> our <span>legal</span> <span>rights</span> is <span>equally</span>, if not more, important?<br/>
🎧 We live in a very <span>litigious</span> and <span>complex</span> <span>society</span> now.<br/>
🎧 Sure, but <span>it's</span> something we can <span>pick</span> up later,<br/>
🎧 so <span>let's</span> leave that one out.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Let me see the <span>timetable</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Thursday</span> is a free day, and the week <span>winds</span> up with some <span>celebrations</span> on <span>Friday</span> <span>afternoon</span>.<br/>
🎧 It looks like a fun <span>choice</span>, too.<br/>
🎧 <span>There's</span> either a <span>BBQ</span> on the <span>main</span> <span>lawn</span>, or the <span>dance</span>.<br/>
🎧 I never <span>pass</span> up the <span>chance</span> to eat something. What about you?<br/>
🎧 If I can get a free <span>meal</span>, <span>I'll</span> take it any day,<br/>
🎧 and <span>I'm</span> not good at <span>dancing</span> <span>anyway</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>that's</span> that <span>decided</span>. Right?<br/>
🎧 Right!<br/>
🎧 <span>Guess</span> what <span>Liz</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>There's</span> another <span>interesting</span> thing in this <span>orientation</span> <span>booklet</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it looks important <span>-</span> about a <span>'style</span> <span>guide'</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>What's</span> that?<br/>
🎧 Take a look yourself.<br/>
🎧 It <span>seems</span> to be a set of <span>rules</span> <span>regarding</span> how to <span>present</span> <span>written</span> work <span>-<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>essays</span>, and that <span>sort</span> of thing <span>-</span> to the <span>lecturers</span>.<br/>
🎧 They want a <span>uniform</span> <span>style</span> of <span>presentation</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can see. So, everything we <span>hand</span> in must have a <span>header</span> and a <span>footer</span>.<br/>
🎧 A what?<br/>
🎧 A <span>header</span> and a <span>footer</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>footer</span> is at the <span>bottom</span> of the <span>page</span>, and the <span>header</span> is at the very top.<br/>
🎧 <span>That's</span> why they call it a <span>'header'</span>, you know,<br/>
🎧 that little bit of <span>writing</span> <span>giving</span> <span>details</span> about the work.<br/>
🎧 And they also want the <span>word</span> <span>count</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why do they need that?<br/>
🎧 I <span>guess</span> because the <span>lecturers</span> will <span>specify</span> the number of <span>words</span> they want for their <span>assignment</span>,<br/>
🎧 and they want to be sure students <span>follow</span> this.<br/>
🎧 And even the <span>heading</span> on the <span>page</span> has to be a <span>specific</span> <span>dimension</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>16</span> <span>points</span>, and <span>bold</span> <span>print</span>, and <span>underlined</span>.<br/>
🎧 And <span>subheadings</span> are <span>14</span> <span>points</span>, and the <span>font</span> has to be <span>Arial</span> for everything.<br/>
🎧 Yes, the <span>main</span> <span>text</span> is <span>Arial</span>, too, as you said, and the size is <span>12</span> <span>points</span>,<br/>
🎧 with the <span>header</span> and <span>footer</span> being <span>slightly</span> <span>smaller</span>, at <span>10</span> <span>points</span> each.<br/>
🎧 Well, it <span>seems</span> <span>logical</span>.<br/>
🎧 The size of everything is in <span>proportion</span> to its <span>importance</span>,<br/>
🎧 but why do they need the <span>spacing</span> of the <span>main</span> <span>text</span> to be one and a <span>half</span>?<br/>
🎧 The <span>header</span> and <span>footer</span> are different.<br/>
🎧 <span>They're</span> only <span>single-spaced</span>.<br/>
🎧 Probably to <span>allow</span> the <span>teacher</span> to <span>insert</span> <span>comments</span>, or <span>corrections</span>,<br/>
🎧 or just to make it all more <span>readable</span>, I <span>suppose</span>.<br/>
🎧 And we need <span>wide</span> <span>margins</span> on the <span>left</span>, right, top, and <span>bottom</span>,<br/>
🎧 probably for the same <span>reason</span>.<br/>
🎧 Lots of <span>space</span> to <span>allow</span> the <span>addition</span> of <span>comments</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>That's</span> a bit <span>scary</span>, actually.<br/>
🎧 It <span>seems</span> to <span>assume</span> we will be <span>making</span> <span>mistakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 And look what they want in the <span>header</span> and <span>footer</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>header</span> has the name of the work.<br/>
🎧 Not the name of the <span>teacher</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, the work, but <span>surely</span> the <span>teacher's</span> name must go somewhere.<br/>
🎧 Ah, here it is. It <span>goes</span> in the <span>footer</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, <span>I'd</span> say this is all <span>logical</span>.<br/>
🎧 If a <span>page</span> is <span>lost</span>, say, <span>falls</span> to the <span>floor</span>,<br/>
🎧 then with all this <span>information</span>, it can always be <span>traced</span> back to the <span>teacher</span> <span>involved</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right <span>-</span> as you say, all very <span>logical</span>.<br/>

🎧 Most of us are <span>familiar</span> with a <span>local</span> <span>park</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>spend</span> time there, play there, and have some of our best <span>memories</span> in these <span>places</span>.<br/>
🎧 But what is a <span>park</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Basically</span>, it can be <span>defined</span> as a <span>natural</span>, or at <span>least</span> <span>semi-natural</span>, <span>piece</span> of <span>land</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>planted</span> with a <span>variety</span> of <span>trees</span>, <span>bushes</span>, and <span>flowers</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>protected</span> and <span>reserved</span> for the <span>enjoyment</span> of all <span>citizens</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are usually <span>regulations</span> about the <span>sorts</span> of <span>behaviour</span> that can take place <span>within</span>.<br/>
🎧 And sometimes there are <span>facilities</span> such as <span>children's</span> <span>playgrounds</span>,<br/>
🎧 or <span>fields</span> for <span>ball</span> <span>games</span> and other <span>sorts</span> of <span>activities</span>.<br/>
🎧 For this <span>reason</span>, if there is <span>grass</span>, it is <span>kept</span> short,<br/>
🎧 and this also <span>discourages</span> the <span>breeding</span> of <span>insect</span> <span>pests</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>well-maintained</span> <span>park</span> actually needs a lot of people to look after it,<br/>
🎧 and more so if the <span>park</span> <span>showcases</span> special <span>plants</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>flowers</span>, or <span>trees</span>, in which case it is called a <span>'botanic</span> <span>garden'</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>complete</span> <span>contrast</span>, if the <span>park</span> is big and <span>remote</span> enough,<br/>
🎧 it is sometimes <span>designated</span> as a <span>wilderness</span> <span>park</span>,<br/>
🎧 to be <span>left</span> <span>completely</span> <span>alone</span> and <span>untouched</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>protected</span> from all <span>development</span> in order to <span>allow</span> <span>wild</span> <span>species</span>,<br/>
🎧 both <span>plant</span> and <span>animal</span>, to live <span>undisturbed</span>.<br/>
🎧 But it is the <span>urban</span> <span>park</span> <span>-</span> the <span>sort</span> of <span>park</span> that most people are <span>familiar</span> with,<br/>
🎧 that I want to talk about now.<br/>
🎧 These <span>preserve</span> <span>natural</span> <span>landscapes</span> for the <span>pleasure</span> of the <span>urban</span> <span>population</span>,<br/>
🎧 most <span>commonly</span> just for <span>passive</span> <span>recreation<br/></span> 
🎧 in other <span>words</span>, <span>allowing</span> people just to <span>observe</span> the <span>trees</span>, and <span>lie</span> in the <span>grass</span>,<br/>
🎧 and such <span>passive</span> <span>recreation</span> is <span>certainly</span> <span>needed</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Continuing</span> on the <span>subject</span> of <span>parks</span>,<br/>
🎧 it might <span>surprise</span> you to know that once there were <span>none</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>thousand</span> years ago, there was no need,<br/>
🎧 since there were already <span>extensive</span> open <span>spaces</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>forests</span>, and <span>wilderness</span> <span>surrounding</span> most <span>cities</span> and <span>towns</span> <span>-</span> for example, in <span>Europe</span>.<br/>
🎧 These <span>dark</span> <span>dank</span> <span>forests</span> were large and even <span>dangerous</span>,<br/>
🎧 full of <span>wild</span> <span>animals</span> and with the <span>potentially</span> <span>fatal</span> <span>result</span> of getting <span>lost</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hence</span>, <span>fairy</span> <span>tales</span> <span>evolved</span> about <span>witches</span> living in these <span>areas</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>wolves</span> and <span>bears</span>, which could <span>threaten</span> young children.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, with the <span>rapidly</span> <span>increasing</span> <span>human</span> <span>population</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>original</span> <span>wilderness</span> and <span>natural</span> open <span>spaces</span> were <span>intruded</span> <span>upon</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Forests</span> were cut down as <span>populations</span> <span>spread</span>,<br/>
🎧 and with them, <span>urban</span> <span>pollution</span> and <span>further</span> <span>deforestation</span>.<br/>
🎧 But it was only with the <span>advent</span> of the <span>Industrial</span> <span>Revolution<br/></span> 
🎧 that people <span>realised</span> <span>natural</span> <span>areas</span> <span>needed</span> to be <span>preserved</span>,<br/>
🎧 to give the <span>populace</span> <span>access</span> to the <span>sort</span> of <span>nature</span> that was <span>fast</span> <span>disappearing<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>due</span> to the <span>uncontrolled</span> <span>development</span> and <span>demand</span> for <span>resources</span>.<br/>
🎧 The first <span>park</span>, <span>expressly</span> <span>designed</span> for that <span>purpose</span>,<br/>
🎧 is usually <span>considered</span> to be <span>Princes</span> <span>Park</span> in <span>Liverpool</span>.<br/>
🎧 This was in <span>1841</span>, on <span>land</span> <span>donated</span> to the <span>public</span> by a <span>rich</span> <span>iron</span> <span>merchant</span>.<br/>
🎧 With such a <span>generous</span> <span>donation</span> <span>(worth</span> about <span>£50,000)</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>council</span> <span>decided</span> to <span>invest</span> <span>£5,000</span> of its own money in <span>making</span> it look good.<br/>
🎧 <span>Consequently</span>, they <span>hired</span> a <span>landscape</span> <span>designer</span>, <span>Joseph</span> <span>Paxton</span>,<br/>
🎧 who <span>designed</span> <span>twisting</span> <span>turning</span> <span>pathways</span> <span>among</span> <span>shade-giving</span> <span>trees</span>,<br/>
🎧 all <span>based</span> around a <span>central</span> <span>lake</span>.<br/>
🎧 In many <span>ways</span>, it <span>became</span> the <span>prototype</span> for all later large <span>parks</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>including</span> the famous <span>Central</span> <span>Park</span> in New <span>York</span>.<br/>
🎧 But, if we were to <span>pick</span> the <span>park</span> that most people are <span>familiar</span> with,<br/>
🎧 it would be the much <span>smaller</span> <span>neighbourhood</span> <span>park</span>.<br/>
🎧 These can be <span>tiny</span>, but, by being in the <span>midst</span> of <span>extensive</span> <span>development</span> and <span>dense</span> <span>populations</span>,<br/>
🎧 they are <span>increasingly</span> <span>seen</span> as a <span>refuge</span>,<br/>
🎧 where one can get a <span>glimpse</span> of <span>true</span> <span>nature</span>.<br/>
🎧 Many <span>psychologists</span> now <span>maintain</span> that this <span>glimpse</span> is <span>necessary</span>,<br/>
🎧 for <span>ultimately</span>, as a <span>species</span>, we have an <span>innate</span> <span>affinity</span> for <span>nature</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>concrete</span> <span>urban</span> zoo <span>clashes</span> with our <span>inner</span> being.<br/>
🎧 This has <span>seen</span> the <span>rejuvenation</span> of many <span>urban</span> <span>parks</span> that were once <span>left</span> to <span>decay</span>,<br/>
🎧 for example, in New <span>York</span> or <span>London</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>indeed</span>, some <span>cities</span>, such as <span>Melbourne</span>,<br/>
🎧 are <span>known</span> all over the <span>world</span> for their <span>abundance</span> of <span>carefully</span> <span>maintained</span> <span>parks</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>including</span> a <span>world</span> famous <span>botanic</span> garden.<br/>
