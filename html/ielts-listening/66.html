🎧 Hi Coleman</span>, how are you?<br/>
🎧 Good, thanks.<br/>
🎧 I wanted to have a chat</span> with you<br/></span>
🎧 because our friend Josh</span> told me that you've joined</span> a guitar</span> group<br/></span>
🎧 and it sounds interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd really like to learn myself.<br/>
🎧 Why don't you come along?<br/>
🎧 I'm sure there's room for another person.<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 So..</span>. who runs</span> the classes</span>?<br/>
🎧 He's called a 'coordinator'</span>,<br/>
🎧 his name's</span> Gary</span> Mathieson</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let me note</span> that down.<br/>
🎧 Gary...</span>.<br/>
🎧 How do you spell</span> his surname</span>?<br/>
🎧 It's Mathieson</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, thanks.<br/>
🎧 He's retired</span>, actually, but he's a really nice guy<br/></span>
🎧 and he used to play in a lot of bands</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 So how long have you been going?<br/>
🎧 About a month now.<br/>
🎧 And could you play anything before you started</span>?<br/>
🎧 I knew</span> a few chords</span>, but that's all.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure everyone will be better than me.<br/>
🎧 That's what I thought, too.<br/>
🎧 When I first spoke</span> to Gary</span> on the phone,<br/>
🎧 he said it was a class for beginners</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I was still worried</span> that everyone would be better than me,<br/>
🎧 but we were all equally</span> hopeless</span>!<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's reassuring</span>.<br/>
🎧 So where do you meet?<br/>
🎧 Well, when I joined</span> the group, they were meeting</span> in Gary's</span> home,<br/>
🎧 but as the group got bigger</span>, he decided</span> to book a room at the college</span> in town</span>.<br/>
🎧 I prefer</span> going there.<br/>
🎧 I know that place.<br/>
🎧 I used to go to tap dancing</span> classes</span> there when I was at secondary</span> school.<br/>
🎧 I haven't been since, though and I can't remember what road</span> it's in..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is it Lock</span> Street</span>?<br/>
🎧 It's just beyond</span> there at the bottom</span> of New Street</span> near the city</span> roundabout</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, of course.<br/>
🎧 The guitar</span> club</span> is on the first floor</span> in Room T347</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And when do you meet?<br/>
🎧 Is it at the weekend?<br/>
🎧 We meet on Thursdays</span>.<br/>
🎧 It used to be 10.30</span> and that suited</span> me well,<br/>
🎧 but now we meet at 11</span>.<br/>
🎧 The class that's in there before us asked</span> if they could have the room for another 30</span> minutes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I see.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'd love to come, but I don't have a guitar</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, you can always buy a second-hand</span> one.<br/>
🎧 There's a website</span> called 'The</span> perfect instrument'</span> that sells</span> all kinds</span> of guitars</span>, violins</span> and so on.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you'll find something there.<br/>
🎧 So what's a typical</span> lesson</span> like with Gary</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, he always starts</span> by getting us to tune</span> our guitars</span>.<br/>
🎧 That takes about five</span> minutes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Uhuh..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some people have an app</span> they use, but others</span> do it by ear</span>.<br/>
🎧 Gary</span> goes</span> round</span> and helps them.<br/>
🎧 And while he's doing that, he tells us what he's going to do during the lesson</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 First, we usually spend</span> about ten minutes</span> doing some strumming</span>.<br/>
🎧 So is that using..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh..</span>. what are they called..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Plectrums</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, we just use our thumbs</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh..</span>. much easier</span>.<br/>
🎧 Gary</span> reminds</span> us where to put our fingers</span> for each chord</span> and then we play them together.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes we all just start laughing</span> because we're so bad at keeping</span> time,<br/>
🎧 so Gary</span> starts</span> clapping</span> to help us.<br/>
🎧 Do you learn to play any songs</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, we do at least</span> one song</span> with words</span> and chords</span>.<br/>
🎧 I mean that's harder</span> than you think.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I'm sure it is!<br/>
🎧 That part</span> of the lesson</span> takes about 15</span> minutes</span>.<br/>
🎧 He often brings</span> a recording</span> of the song</span> and plays</span> it to us first.<br/>
🎧 Then he hands</span> out the song</span> and if there's a new chord</span> in it,<br/>
🎧 we practise</span> that before we play it together, but really slowly</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you do any finger</span> picking</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's the last ten minutes</span> of the lesson</span>,<br/>
🎧 when we pick</span> out the individual</span> notes</span> from a tune</span> he's made up.<br/>
🎧 It's always quite simple.<br/>
🎧 That must be hard</span>, though.<br/>
🎧 It is.<br/>
🎧 But people like it because they can really concentrate<br/></span>
🎧 and if we're all playing well, it sounds quite impressive</span>.<br/>
🎧 The only trouble</span> is that he sometimes gets</span> us to play one at a time, you know, alone</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh..</span>. that's scary</span>.<br/>
🎧 Um..</span>. it is, but I've got used to it now.<br/>
🎧 At the end he spends</span> about five</span> minutes</span> telling</span> us what to practise</span> for the following</span> week.<br/>
🎧 Well, thanks Coleman</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll go and have a look at that website</span>, I think.<br/>

🎧 I never really planned</span> to be a lifeboat</span> volunteer</span> when I came to live in Northsea</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd been working in London</span> as a website</span> designer</span>,<br/>
🎧 but although that was interesting</span>, I didn't like city</span> life.<br/>
🎧 I'd been really keen</span> on boats</span> as a teenager</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I thought if I went to live by the sea.<br/>
🎧 I might be able to pursue</span> that interest</span> a bit more in my free time.<br/>
🎧 Then I found</span> that the Lifeboat</span> Institution</span> was looking for volunteers</span>,<br/>
🎧 so I decided</span> to apply</span>.<br/>
🎧 The Lifeboat</span> Institution</span> building</span> here in Northsea's</span> hard</span> to miss</span>,<br/>
🎧 it's one of the largest</span> in the country</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was built</span> 15</span> years ago with funds</span> provided</span> by a generous</span> member</span> of the public</span> who'd lived</span> here all her life.<br/>
🎧 As the Lifeboat</span> Institution</span> is a charity</span> that relies</span> on that kind of donation</span>,<br/>
🎧 rather than funding</span> provided</span> by the government</span>,<br/>
🎧 that was a huge</span> help to us.<br/>
🎧 When I applied</span>, I had to have a health</span> assessment</span>.<br/>
🎧 The doctors</span> were particularly</span> interested in my vision</span>.<br/>
🎧 I used to be short-sighted</span>,<br/>
🎧 so I'd had to wear</span> glasses</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I'd had laser</span> eye surgery</span> two years earlier</span> so that was okay.<br/>
🎧 They gave me tests</span> for colour</span> blindness<br/></span>
🎧 and they thought I might have a problem</span> there,<br/>
🎧 but it turned</span> out I was okay.<br/>
🎧 When the coastguard</span> gets</span> an alert</span>,<br/>
🎧 all the volunteers</span> are contacted</span> and rush</span> to the lifeboat</span> station</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our target's</span> to get there in five</span> minutes</span>,<br/>
🎧 then we try to get the boat</span> off the dock</span> and out to sea in another six to eight</span> minutes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our team's</span> proud</span> that we usually achieve</span> that.<br/>
🎧 The average</span> time across the country's</span> 8.5</span> minutes</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've recently</span> qualified</span> as what's called a 'helmsman'</span>,<br/>
🎧 which means</span> I have the ultimate</span> responsibility</span> for the lifeboat</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have to check that the equipment</span> we use is in working order,<br/>
🎧 the crew</span> have special life jackets</span> that can support</span> up to four</span> people in the water.<br/>
🎧 And it's ultimately</span> my decision</span> whether</span> it's safe</span> to launch</span> the boat</span>.<br/>
🎧 But it's very rare</span> not to launch</span> it, even in the worst</span> weather</span>.<br/>
🎧 As well as going out on the lifeboat</span>, my work involves</span> other things too.<br/>
🎧 A lot of people underestimate</span> how quickly conditions</span> can change at sea,<br/>
🎧 so I speak to youth</span> groups</span> and sailing</span> clubs</span> in the area<br/></span>
🎧 about the sorts</span> of problems</span> that sailors</span> and swimmers</span> can have if the weather</span> suddenly</span> gets</span> bad.<br/>
🎧 We also have a lot of volunteers</span> who organise</span> activities</span> to raise</span> money for us,<br/>
🎧 and we couldn't manage</span> without them.<br/>
🎧 The training</span> we get is a continuous</span> process</span>,<br/>
🎧 focusing</span> on technical</span> competence</span> and safe</span> handling</span> techniques</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it's given</span> me the confidence</span> to deal</span> with extreme</span> situations</span> without panicking</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was glad I'd done a first aid</span> course before I started</span>,<br/>
🎧 as that's a big help with the casualty</span> care</span> activities</span> we do.<br/>
🎧 We've done a lot on how to deal</span> with ropes</span> and tie knots</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's an essential</span> skill</span>.<br/>
🎧 After a year, I did a one-week</span> residential</span> course, led</span> by specialists</span>.<br/>
🎧 They had a wave-tank</span> where they could create</span> extreme</span> weather</span> conditions</span>,<br/>
🎧 so we could get experience</span> of what to do if the boat</span> turned</span> over in a storm</span> at night</span>, for example.<br/>
🎧 Since I started</span>, I've had to deal</span> with a range</span> of emergency</span> situations</span>.<br/>
🎧 But the work's</span> hugely</span> motivating</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's not just about saving</span> lives.<br/>
🎧 I've learned</span> a lot about the technology</span> involved</span>.<br/>
🎧 My background</span> in IT's been useful</span> here,<br/>
🎧 and I can use my expertise</span> to help other volunteers</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're a great group, we're like a family</span> really,<br/>
🎧 which helps when you're dragging</span> yourself out of bed on a cold</span> stormy</span> night</span>.<br/>
🎧 But actually, it's the colder</span> months</span> that can be the most rewarding</span> time.<br/>
🎧 That's when the incidents</span> tend</span> to be more serious,<br/>
🎧 and you realise</span> that you can make a huge</span> difference</span> to the outcome</span>.<br/>
🎧 So if any of you listeners</span> are interested...</span>.<br/>

🎧 Hi Don</span>.<br/>
🎧 Did you get the copy</span> of the article</span> on recycling</span> footwear</span> that I emailed</span> you?<br/>
🎧 Yeah it's here..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've had a look at it.<br/>
🎧 So do you think it's a good topic</span> for our presentation</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, before I started</span> reading</span> it, I thought recycling</span> footwear..</span>.<br/>
🎧 well, although it's quite interesting</span>, perhaps</span> there isn't enough to say about it,<br/>
🎧 cos</span> we put shoes</span> in recycling</span> bins</span>, they go to charity</span> shops</span> and that's about it.<br/>
🎧 But there's much more to it than that.<br/>
🎧 I realise</span> that now and I'm keen</span> to research</span> the topic</span> more.<br/>
🎧 That's great.<br/>
🎧 One of the things I didn't realise</span> until I read the article</span> was just how many pairs</span> of trainers</span> get recycled</span>!<br/>
🎧 Well, a lot of young people wear</span> them all the time now.<br/>
🎧 They've</span> become more popular</span> than ordinary</span> shoes</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 I guess</span> they are very hard-wearing</span>,<br/>
🎧 but don't they look a bit casual</span> for school uniform</span>?<br/>
🎧 I don't think they're right for that.<br/>
🎧 Actually, I think some of them look quite smart</span> on pupils..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Better than a scruffy</span> old pair</span> of shoes</span>.<br/>
🎧 So do you keep shoes</span> a long time?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Though I do tend</span> to wear</span> my old pairs</span> for doing dirty</span> jobs</span> like cleaning</span> my bike</span>.<br/>
🎧 I must admit</span>,<br/>
🎧 I've recycled</span> some perfectly</span> good shoes</span>, that haven't gone</span> out of fashion</span> and still fit,<br/>
🎧 just because they don't look great on me anymore</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's awful</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 I think it's common</span> because there's so much choice</span>.<br/>
🎧 The article</span> did say that recent</span> sales</span> of footwear</span> have increased</span> enormously</span>.<br/>
🎧 That didn't surprise</span> me.<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 But then it said that the amount of recycled</span> footwear</span> has fallen</span>:<br/>
🎧 it's 6%</span> now compared</span> to a previous</span> level</span> of 11%</span>.<br/>
🎧 That doesn't seem</span> to make sense</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's because not everything goes</span> through the recycling</span> process</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some footwear</span> just isn't good enough to re-sell</span>, for one reason</span> or another, and gets</span> rejected</span>.<br/>
🎧 So let's find some examples</span> in the article</span> of footwear</span> that was rejected</span> for recycling</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 I think there are some in the interview</span> with the recycling</span> manager</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah..</span>. here it is.<br/>
🎧 Let's start with the ladies'</span> high-heeled</span> shoes</span>.<br/>
🎧 What did he say about those?<br/>
🎧 He said they were probably expensive</span>.<br/>
🎧 The material</span> was suede</span> and they were beige</span> in colour</span>.<br/>
🎧 It looked</span> like someone</span> had only worn</span> them once, but in a very wet field<br/></span>
🎧 so the heels</span> were too stained</span> with mud</span> and grass</span> to re-sell</span> them.<br/>
🎧 Okay..</span>.<br/>
🎧 And the leather</span> ankle</span> boots</span>.<br/>
🎧 What was wrong with them?<br/>
🎧 Apparently</span>, the heels</span> were worn<br/></span>
🎧 but that wasn't the problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 One of the shoes</span> was a much lighter</span> shade</span> than the other one.<br/>
🎧 It'd obviously</span> been left</span> in the sun.<br/>
🎧 I suppose</span> even second-hand</span> shoes</span> should look the same!<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 Then there were the red baby</span> shoes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes..</span>.<br/>
🎧 we're told to tie shoes</span> together when we put them in a recycling</span> bin</span>,<br/>
🎧 but people often don't bother</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'd think it would have been easy to find the other, but it wasn't.<br/>
🎧 That was a shame</span> because they were obviously</span> new.<br/>
🎧 The trainers</span> were interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 He said they looked</span> like they'd been worn</span> by a marathon</span> runner</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah..</span>. weren't they split</span>?<br/>
🎧 Not exactly.<br/>
🎧 One of the soles</span> was so worn</span> under the foot</span> that you could put your finger</span> through it.<br/>
🎧 Well, we could certainly</span> use some of those examples</span> in our presentation</span> to explain</span> why 90%</span> of shoes</span> that people take to recycling</span> centres</span> or bins</span> get thrown</span> into landfill</span>.<br/>
🎧 What did you think about the project</span> his team</span> set up to avoid</span> this by making</span> new shoes</span> out of the good parts</span> of old shoes</span>?<br/>
🎧 It sounded</span> like a good idea.<br/>
🎧 They get so many shoes</span>, they should be able to match</span> parts</span>.<br/>
🎧 I wasn't surprised</span> that it failed</span>, though.<br/>
🎧 I mean who wants</span> to buy second-hand</span> shoes</span> really?<br/>
🎧 Think of all the germs</span> you could catch!<br/>
🎧 Well, people didn't refuse</span> them for that reason</span>, did they?<br/>
🎧 It was because the pairs</span> of shoes</span> weren't identical</span>.<br/>
🎧 They still managed</span> to ship</span> them overseas</span>, though.<br/>
🎧 That's another area</span> we need to discuss</span>.<br/>
🎧 You know I used to consider</span> this topic</span> just from my own perspective</span>,<br/>
🎧 by thinking about my own recycling</span> behaviour</span> without looking at the bigger</span> picture</span>.<br/>
🎧 So much happens</span> once shoes</span> leave the recycling</span> area</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's not as simple as you first think,<br/>
🎧 and we can show that by taking a very different approach</span> to it.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely.<br/>
🎧 So let's discuss..</span>.<br/>

🎧 For my project</span> on invertebrates</span>, I chose</span> to study</span> tardigrades</span>.<br/>
🎧 These are microscopic</span>, or to be more precise</span>, near-microscopic</span> animals</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are well over a thousand</span> known</span> species</span> of these tiny</span> animals</span>,<br/>
🎧 which belong</span> to the phylum</span> Tardigrada</span>.<br/>
🎧 Most tardigrades</span> range</span> in length</span> from 0.05</span> to 1</span> millimetre</span>,<br/>
🎧 though the largest</span> species</span> can grow</span> to be 1.2</span> millimetres</span> in length</span>.<br/>
🎧 They are also sometimes called 'water</span> bears'</span>:<br/>
🎧 'water'</span> because that's where they thrive</span> best,<br/>
🎧 and 'bear'</span> because of the way they move.<br/>
🎧 'Moss</span> piglet'</span> is another name for tardigrades<br/></span>
🎧 because of the way they look when viewed</span> from the front</span>.<br/>
🎧 They were first discovered</span> in Germany</span> in 1773</span> by Johann</span> Goeze</span>,<br/>
🎧 who coined</span> the name Tardigrada</span>.<br/>
🎧 As I say, there are many different species</span> of tardigrade</span>,<br/>
🎧 too many to describe</span> here, but generally</span> speaking</span>, the different species</span> share similar</span> physical</span> traits</span>.<br/>
🎧 They have a body</span> which is short, and also rounded</span>, a bit like a barrel</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the body</span> comprises</span> four</span> segments</span>.<br/>
🎧 Each segment</span> has a pair</span> of legs</span>,<br/>
🎧 at the end of which are between four</span> and eight</span> sharp</span> claws</span>.<br/>
🎧 I should also say that some species</span> don't have any claws;<br/></span>
🎧 what they have are discs</span>,<br/>
🎧 and these work by means</span> of suction</span>.<br/>
🎧 They enable</span> the tardigrade</span> to cling</span> on to surfaces</span> or to grip</span> its prey</span>.<br/>
🎧 Within</span> the body</span>, there are no lungs</span>, or any organs</span> for breathing</span> at all.<br/>
🎧 Instead</span>, oxygen</span> and also blood</span> are transported</span> in a fluid</span> that fills</span> the cavity</span> of the body</span>.<br/>
🎧 As far</span> as the tardigrade's</span> head</span> is concerned</span>,<br/>
🎧 the best way I can describe</span> this is that it looks rather strange</span>, a bit squashed</span> even,<br/>
🎧 though many of the websites</span> I looked</span> at described</span> its appearance</span> as cute</span>,<br/>
🎧 which isn't exactly very scientific</span>.<br/>
🎧 The tardigrade's</span> mouth</span> is a kind of tube<br/></span>
🎧 that can open outwards</span> to reveal</span> teeth-like</span> structures</span> known</span> as 'stylets'</span>.<br/>
🎧 These are sharp</span> enough to pierce</span> plant</span> or animal</span> cells</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, where are tardigrades</span> found</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, they live in every part</span> of the world</span>,<br/>
🎧 in a variety</span> of habitats</span>: most commonly</span>, on the bed of a lake</span>,<br/>
🎧 or on many kinds</span> of plants</span> or in very wet environments</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's been some interesting</span> research</span> which has found</span> that tardigrades</span> are capable</span> of surviving</span> radiation<br/></span>
🎧 and very high pressure</span>,<br/>
🎧 and they're also able to withstand</span> temperatures</span> as cold</span> as -200</span> degrees</span> centigrade</span>,<br/>
🎧 or highs</span> of more than 148</span> degrees</span> centigrade</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is incredibly</span> hot.<br/>
🎧 It has been said that tardigrades</span> could survive</span> long after human</span> beings</span> have been wiped</span> out,<br/>
🎧 even in the event</span> of an asteroid</span> hitting</span> the earth</span>.<br/>
🎧 If conditions</span> become too extreme</span> and tardigrades</span> are at risk</span> of drying</span> out,<br/>
🎧 they enter</span> a state</span> called cryptobiosis</span>.<br/>
🎧 They curl</span> into a ball</span>, called a tun</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's T-U-N-</span> by retracting</span> their head</span> and legs</span>,<br/>
🎧 and their metabolism</span> drops</span> to less than one percent</span> of normal</span> levels</span>.<br/>
🎧 They can remain</span> like this until they are re-introduced</span> to water,<br/>
🎧 when they will come back to life in a matter</span> of a few hours.<br/>
🎧 While in a state</span> of cryptobiosis</span>, tardigrades</span> produce</span> a protein</span> that protects</span> their DNA</span>.<br/>
🎧 In 2016</span>, scientists</span> revived</span> two tardigrades</span> that had been tuns</span> for more than 30</span> years.<br/>
🎧 There was a report</span> that, in 1948</span>,<br/>
🎧 a 120-year-old</span> tun</span> was revived</span>,<br/>
🎧 but this experiment</span> has never been repeated</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are currently</span> several</span> tests</span> taking place in space</span>,<br/>
🎧 to determine</span> how long tardigrades</span> might be able to survive</span> there.<br/>
🎧 I believe</span> the record</span> so far</span> is 10</span> days</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, erm</span>, moving</span> on.<br/>
🎧 In terms</span> of their diet</span>, tardigrades</span> consume</span> liquids</span> in order to survive</span>.<br/>
🎧 Although they have teeth</span>, they don't use these for chewing</span>.<br/>
🎧 They suck</span> the juices</span> from moss</span>, or extract</span> fluid</span> from seaweed</span>,<br/>
🎧 but some species</span> prey</span> on other tardigrades</span>,<br/>
🎧 from other species</span> or within</span> their own.<br/>
🎧 I suppose</span> this isn't surprising</span>, given</span> that tardigrades</span> are mainly</span> comprised</span> of liquid</span> and are coated</span> with a type</span> of gel</span>.<br/>
🎧 Finally, I'd like to mention</span> the conservation</span> status</span> of tardigrades</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is estimated</span> that they have been in existence</span> for approximately</span> half</span> a billion</span> years<br/></span>
🎧 and, in that time, they have survived</span> five</span> mass</span> extinctions</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, it will probably come as no surprise</span> to you,<br/>
🎧 that tardigrades</span> have not been evaluated</span> by the International</span> Union</span> for Conservation</span> of Nature<br/></span>
🎧 and are not on any endangered</span> list</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some researchers</span> have described</span> them as thriving</span>.<br/>
🎧 Does anyone</span> have any questions</span> they'd like to ask?<br/>
