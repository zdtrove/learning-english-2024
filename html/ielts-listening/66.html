🎧 Hi <span>Coleman</span>, how are you?<br/>
🎧 Good, thanks.<br/>
🎧 I wanted to have a <span>chat</span> with <span>you<br/></span>
🎧 because our friend <span>Josh</span> told me that you've <span>joined</span> a <span>guitar</span> <span>group<br/></span>
🎧 and it sounds <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd really like to learn myself.<br/>
🎧 Why don't you come along?<br/>
🎧 I'm sure there's room for another person.<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 <span>So..</span>. who <span>runs</span> the <span>classes</span>?<br/>
🎧 He's called a <span>'coordinator'</span>,<br/>
🎧 his <span>name's</span> <span>Gary</span> <span>Mathieson</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let me <span>note</span> that down.<br/>
🎧 <span>Gary...</span>.<br/>
🎧 How do you <span>spell</span> his <span>surname</span>?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>Mathieson</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, thanks.<br/>
🎧 He's <span>retired</span>, actually, but he's a really nice <span>guy<br/></span>
🎧 and he used to play in a lot of <span>bands</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 So how long have you been going?<br/>
🎧 About a month now.<br/>
🎧 And could you play anything before you <span>started</span>?<br/>
🎧 I <span>knew</span> a few <span>chords</span>, but that's all.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure everyone will be better than me.<br/>
🎧 That's what I thought, too.<br/>
🎧 When I first <span>spoke</span> to <span>Gary</span> on the phone,<br/>
🎧 he said it was a class for <span>beginners</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I was still <span>worried</span> that everyone would be better than me,<br/>
🎧 but we were all <span>equally</span> <span>hopeless</span>!<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's <span>reassuring</span>.<br/>
🎧 So where do you meet?<br/>
🎧 Well, when I <span>joined</span> the group, they were <span>meeting</span> in <span>Gary's</span> home,<br/>
🎧 but as the group got <span>bigger</span>, he <span>decided</span> to book a room at the <span>college</span> in <span>town</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>prefer</span> going there.<br/>
🎧 I know that place.<br/>
🎧 I used to go to tap <span>dancing</span> <span>classes</span> there when I was at <span>secondary</span> school.<br/>
🎧 I haven't been since, though and I can't remember what <span>road</span> it's <span>in..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is it <span>Lock</span> <span>Street</span>?<br/>
🎧 It's just <span>beyond</span> there at the <span>bottom</span> of New <span>Street</span> near the <span>city</span> <span>roundabout</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, of course.<br/>
🎧 The <span>guitar</span> <span>club</span> is on the first <span>floor</span> in Room <span>T347</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And when do you meet?<br/>
🎧 Is it at the weekend?<br/>
🎧 We meet on <span>Thursdays</span>.<br/>
🎧 It used to be <span>10.30</span> and that <span>suited</span> me well,<br/>
🎧 but now we meet at <span>11</span>.<br/>
🎧 The class that's in there before us <span>asked</span> if they could have the room for another <span>30</span> <span>minutes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I see.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'd love to come, but I don't have a <span>guitar</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, you can always buy a <span>second-hand</span> one.<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>website</span> called <span>'The</span> perfect <span>instrument'</span> that <span>sells</span> all <span>kinds</span> of <span>guitars</span>, <span>violins</span> and so on.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you'll find something there.<br/>
🎧 So what's a <span>typical</span> <span>lesson</span> like with <span>Gary</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, he always <span>starts</span> by getting us to <span>tune</span> our <span>guitars</span>.<br/>
🎧 That takes about <span>five</span> <span>minutes</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Uhuh..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some people have an <span>app</span> they use, but <span>others</span> do it by <span>ear</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Gary</span> <span>goes</span> <span>round</span> and helps them.<br/>
🎧 And while he's doing that, he tells us what he's going to do during the <span>lesson</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 First, we usually <span>spend</span> about ten <span>minutes</span> doing some <span>strumming</span>.<br/>
🎧 So is that <span>using..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh..</span>. what are they <span>called..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Plectrums</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, we just use our <span>thumbs</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh..</span>. much <span>easier</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Gary</span> <span>reminds</span> us where to put our <span>fingers</span> for each <span>chord</span> and then we play them together.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes we all just start <span>laughing</span> because we're so bad at <span>keeping</span> time,<br/>
🎧 so <span>Gary</span> <span>starts</span> <span>clapping</span> to help us.<br/>
🎧 Do you learn to play any <span>songs</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, we do at <span>least</span> one <span>song</span> with <span>words</span> and <span>chords</span>.<br/>
🎧 I mean that's <span>harder</span> than you think.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I'm sure it is!<br/>
🎧 That <span>part</span> of the <span>lesson</span> takes about <span>15</span> <span>minutes</span>.<br/>
🎧 He often <span>brings</span> a <span>recording</span> of the <span>song</span> and <span>plays</span> it to us first.<br/>
🎧 Then he <span>hands</span> out the <span>song</span> and if there's a new <span>chord</span> in it,<br/>
🎧 we <span>practise</span> that before we play it together, but really <span>slowly</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you do any <span>finger</span> <span>picking</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's the last ten <span>minutes</span> of the <span>lesson</span>,<br/>
🎧 when we <span>pick</span> out the <span>individual</span> <span>notes</span> from a <span>tune</span> he's made up.<br/>
🎧 It's always quite simple.<br/>
🎧 That must be <span>hard</span>, though.<br/>
🎧 It is.<br/>
🎧 But people like it because they can really <span>concentrate<br/></span>
🎧 and if we're all playing well, it sounds quite <span>impressive</span>.<br/>
🎧 The only <span>trouble</span> is that he sometimes <span>gets</span> us to play one at a time, you know, <span>alone</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh..</span>. that's <span>scary</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Um..</span>. it is, but I've got used to it now.<br/>
🎧 At the end he <span>spends</span> about <span>five</span> <span>minutes</span> <span>telling</span> us what to <span>practise</span> for the <span>following</span> week.<br/>
🎧 Well, thanks <span>Coleman</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll go and have a look at that <span>website</span>, I think.<br/>

🎧 I never really <span>planned</span> to be a <span>lifeboat</span> <span>volunteer</span> when I came to live in <span>Northsea</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd been working in <span>London</span> as a <span>website</span> <span>designer</span>,<br/>
🎧 but although that was <span>interesting</span>, I didn't like <span>city</span> life.<br/>
🎧 I'd been really <span>keen</span> on <span>boats</span> as a <span>teenager</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I thought if I went to live by the sea.<br/>
🎧 I might be able to <span>pursue</span> that <span>interest</span> a bit more in my free time.<br/>
🎧 Then I <span>found</span> that the <span>Lifeboat</span> <span>Institution</span> was looking for <span>volunteers</span>,<br/>
🎧 so I <span>decided</span> to <span>apply</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Lifeboat</span> <span>Institution</span> <span>building</span> here in <span>Northsea's</span> <span>hard</span> to <span>miss</span>,<br/>
🎧 it's one of the <span>largest</span> in the <span>country</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>built</span> <span>15</span> years ago with <span>funds</span> <span>provided</span> by a <span>generous</span> <span>member</span> of the <span>public</span> who'd <span>lived</span> here all her life.<br/>
🎧 As the <span>Lifeboat</span> <span>Institution</span> is a <span>charity</span> that <span>relies</span> on that kind of <span>donation</span>,<br/>
🎧 rather than <span>funding</span> <span>provided</span> by the <span>government</span>,<br/>
🎧 that was a <span>huge</span> help to us.<br/>
🎧 When I <span>applied</span>, I had to have a <span>health</span> <span>assessment</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>doctors</span> were <span>particularly</span> interested in my <span>vision</span>.<br/>
🎧 I used to be <span>short-sighted</span>,<br/>
🎧 so I'd had to <span>wear</span> <span>glasses</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I'd had <span>laser</span> eye <span>surgery</span> two years <span>earlier</span> so that was okay.<br/>
🎧 They gave me <span>tests</span> for <span>colour</span> <span>blindness<br/></span>
🎧 and they thought I might have a <span>problem</span> there,<br/>
🎧 but it <span>turned</span> out I was okay.<br/>
🎧 When the <span>coastguard</span> <span>gets</span> an <span>alert</span>,<br/>
🎧 all the <span>volunteers</span> are <span>contacted</span> and <span>rush</span> to the <span>lifeboat</span> <span>station</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>target's</span> to get there in <span>five</span> <span>minutes</span>,<br/>
🎧 then we try to get the <span>boat</span> off the <span>dock</span> and out to sea in another six to <span>eight</span> <span>minutes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>team's</span> <span>proud</span> that we usually <span>achieve</span> that.<br/>
🎧 The <span>average</span> time across the <span>country's</span> <span>8.5</span> <span>minutes</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've <span>recently</span> <span>qualified</span> as what's called a <span>'helmsman'</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>means</span> I have the <span>ultimate</span> <span>responsibility</span> for the <span>lifeboat</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have to check that the <span>equipment</span> we use is in working order,<br/>
🎧 the <span>crew</span> have special life <span>jackets</span> that can <span>support</span> up to <span>four</span> people in the water.<br/>
🎧 And it's <span>ultimately</span> my <span>decision</span> <span>whether</span> it's <span>safe</span> to <span>launch</span> the <span>boat</span>.<br/>
🎧 But it's very <span>rare</span> not to <span>launch</span> it, even in the <span>worst</span> <span>weather</span>.<br/>
🎧 As well as going out on the <span>lifeboat</span>, my work <span>involves</span> other things too.<br/>
🎧 A lot of people <span>underestimate</span> how quickly <span>conditions</span> can change at sea,<br/>
🎧 so I speak to <span>youth</span> <span>groups</span> and <span>sailing</span> <span>clubs</span> in the <span>area<br/></span>
🎧 about the <span>sorts</span> of <span>problems</span> that <span>sailors</span> and <span>swimmers</span> can have if the <span>weather</span> <span>suddenly</span> <span>gets</span> bad.<br/>
🎧 We also have a lot of <span>volunteers</span> who <span>organise</span> <span>activities</span> to <span>raise</span> money for us,<br/>
🎧 and we couldn't <span>manage</span> without them.<br/>
🎧 The <span>training</span> we get is a <span>continuous</span> <span>process</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>focusing</span> on <span>technical</span> <span>competence</span> and <span>safe</span> <span>handling</span> <span>techniques</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it's <span>given</span> me the <span>confidence</span> to <span>deal</span> with <span>extreme</span> <span>situations</span> without <span>panicking</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was glad I'd done a first <span>aid</span> course before I <span>started</span>,<br/>
🎧 as that's a big help with the <span>casualty</span> <span>care</span> <span>activities</span> we do.<br/>
🎧 We've done a lot on how to <span>deal</span> with <span>ropes</span> and tie <span>knots</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's an <span>essential</span> <span>skill</span>.<br/>
🎧 After a year, I did a <span>one-week</span> <span>residential</span> course, <span>led</span> by <span>specialists</span>.<br/>
🎧 They had a <span>wave-tank</span> where they could <span>create</span> <span>extreme</span> <span>weather</span> <span>conditions</span>,<br/>
🎧 so we could get <span>experience</span> of what to do if the <span>boat</span> <span>turned</span> over in a <span>storm</span> at <span>night</span>, for example.<br/>
🎧 Since I <span>started</span>, I've had to <span>deal</span> with a <span>range</span> of <span>emergency</span> <span>situations</span>.<br/>
🎧 But the <span>work's</span> <span>hugely</span> <span>motivating</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's not just about <span>saving</span> lives.<br/>
🎧 I've <span>learned</span> a lot about the <span>technology</span> <span>involved</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>background</span> in IT's been <span>useful</span> here,<br/>
🎧 and I can use my <span>expertise</span> to help other <span>volunteers</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're a great group, we're like a <span>family</span> really,<br/>
🎧 which helps when you're <span>dragging</span> yourself out of bed on a <span>cold</span> <span>stormy</span> <span>night</span>.<br/>
🎧 But actually, it's the <span>colder</span> <span>months</span> that can be the most <span>rewarding</span> time.<br/>
🎧 That's when the <span>incidents</span> <span>tend</span> to be more serious,<br/>
🎧 and you <span>realise</span> that you can make a <span>huge</span> <span>difference</span> to the <span>outcome</span>.<br/>
🎧 So if any of you <span>listeners</span> are <span>interested...</span>.<br/>

🎧 Hi <span>Don</span>.<br/>
🎧 Did you get the <span>copy</span> of the <span>article</span> on <span>recycling</span> <span>footwear</span> that I <span>emailed</span> you?<br/>
🎧 Yeah it's <span>here..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've had a look at it.<br/>
🎧 So do you think it's a good <span>topic</span> for our <span>presentation</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, before I <span>started</span> <span>reading</span> it, I thought <span>recycling</span> <span>footwear..</span>.<br/>
🎧 well, although it's quite <span>interesting</span>, <span>perhaps</span> there isn't enough to say about it,<br/>
🎧 <span>cos</span> we put <span>shoes</span> in <span>recycling</span> <span>bins</span>, they go to <span>charity</span> <span>shops</span> and that's about it.<br/>
🎧 But there's much more to it than that.<br/>
🎧 I <span>realise</span> that now and I'm <span>keen</span> to <span>research</span> the <span>topic</span> more.<br/>
🎧 That's great.<br/>
🎧 One of the things I didn't <span>realise</span> until I read the <span>article</span> was just how many <span>pairs</span> of <span>trainers</span> get <span>recycled</span>!<br/>
🎧 Well, a lot of young people <span>wear</span> them all the time now.<br/>
🎧 <span>They've</span> become more <span>popular</span> than <span>ordinary</span> <span>shoes</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 I <span>guess</span> they are very <span>hard-wearing</span>,<br/>
🎧 but don't they look a bit <span>casual</span> for school <span>uniform</span>?<br/>
🎧 I don't think they're right for that.<br/>
🎧 Actually, I think some of them look quite <span>smart</span> on <span>pupils..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Better than a <span>scruffy</span> old <span>pair</span> of <span>shoes</span>.<br/>
🎧 So do you keep <span>shoes</span> a long time?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Though I do <span>tend</span> to <span>wear</span> my old <span>pairs</span> for doing <span>dirty</span> <span>jobs</span> like <span>cleaning</span> my <span>bike</span>.<br/>
🎧 I must <span>admit</span>,<br/>
🎧 I've <span>recycled</span> some <span>perfectly</span> good <span>shoes</span>, that haven't <span>gone</span> out of <span>fashion</span> and still fit,<br/>
🎧 just because they don't look great on me <span>anymore</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>awful</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 I think it's <span>common</span> because there's so much <span>choice</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>article</span> did say that <span>recent</span> <span>sales</span> of <span>footwear</span> have <span>increased</span> <span>enormously</span>.<br/>
🎧 That didn't <span>surprise</span> me.<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 But then it said that the amount of <span>recycled</span> <span>footwear</span> has <span>fallen</span>:<br/>
🎧 it's <span>6%</span> now <span>compared</span> to a <span>previous</span> <span>level</span> of <span>11%</span>.<br/>
🎧 That doesn't <span>seem</span> to make <span>sense</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's because not everything <span>goes</span> through the <span>recycling</span> <span>process</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>footwear</span> just isn't good enough to <span>re-sell</span>, for one <span>reason</span> or another, and <span>gets</span> <span>rejected</span>.<br/>
🎧 So let's find some <span>examples</span> in the <span>article</span> of <span>footwear</span> that was <span>rejected</span> for <span>recycling</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 I think there are some in the <span>interview</span> with the <span>recycling</span> <span>manager</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yeah..</span>. here it is.<br/>
🎧 Let's start with the <span>ladies'</span> <span>high-heeled</span> <span>shoes</span>.<br/>
🎧 What did he say about those?<br/>
🎧 He said they were probably <span>expensive</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>material</span> was <span>suede</span> and they were <span>beige</span> in <span>colour</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>looked</span> like <span>someone</span> had only <span>worn</span> them once, but in a very wet <span>field<br/></span>
🎧 so the <span>heels</span> were too <span>stained</span> with <span>mud</span> and <span>grass</span> to <span>re-sell</span> them.<br/>
🎧 <span>Okay..</span>.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>leather</span> <span>ankle</span> <span>boots</span>.<br/>
🎧 What was wrong with them?<br/>
🎧 <span>Apparently</span>, the <span>heels</span> were <span>worn<br/></span>
🎧 but that wasn't the <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 One of the <span>shoes</span> was a much <span>lighter</span> <span>shade</span> than the other one.<br/>
🎧 It'd <span>obviously</span> been <span>left</span> in the sun.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> even <span>second-hand</span> <span>shoes</span> should look the same!<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 Then there were the red <span>baby</span> <span>shoes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>yes..</span>.<br/>
🎧 we're told to tie <span>shoes</span> together when we put them in a <span>recycling</span> <span>bin</span>,<br/>
🎧 but people often don't <span>bother</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'd think it would have been easy to find the other, but it wasn't.<br/>
🎧 That was a <span>shame</span> because they were <span>obviously</span> new.<br/>
🎧 The <span>trainers</span> were <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 He said they <span>looked</span> like they'd been <span>worn</span> by a <span>marathon</span> <span>runner</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yeah..</span>. weren't they <span>split</span>?<br/>
🎧 Not exactly.<br/>
🎧 One of the <span>soles</span> was so <span>worn</span> under the <span>foot</span> that you could put your <span>finger</span> through it.<br/>
🎧 Well, we could <span>certainly</span> use some of those <span>examples</span> in our <span>presentation</span> to <span>explain</span> why <span>90%</span> of <span>shoes</span> that people take to <span>recycling</span> <span>centres</span> or <span>bins</span> get <span>thrown</span> into <span>landfill</span>.<br/>
🎧 What did you think about the <span>project</span> his <span>team</span> set up to <span>avoid</span> this by <span>making</span> new <span>shoes</span> out of the good <span>parts</span> of old <span>shoes</span>?<br/>
🎧 It <span>sounded</span> like a good idea.<br/>
🎧 They get so many <span>shoes</span>, they should be able to <span>match</span> <span>parts</span>.<br/>
🎧 I wasn't <span>surprised</span> that it <span>failed</span>, though.<br/>
🎧 I mean who <span>wants</span> to buy <span>second-hand</span> <span>shoes</span> really?<br/>
🎧 Think of all the <span>germs</span> you could catch!<br/>
🎧 Well, people didn't <span>refuse</span> them for that <span>reason</span>, did they?<br/>
🎧 It was because the <span>pairs</span> of <span>shoes</span> weren't <span>identical</span>.<br/>
🎧 They still <span>managed</span> to <span>ship</span> them <span>overseas</span>, though.<br/>
🎧 That's another <span>area</span> we need to <span>discuss</span>.<br/>
🎧 You know I used to <span>consider</span> this <span>topic</span> just from my own <span>perspective</span>,<br/>
🎧 by thinking about my own <span>recycling</span> <span>behaviour</span> without looking at the <span>bigger</span> <span>picture</span>.<br/>
🎧 So much <span>happens</span> once <span>shoes</span> leave the <span>recycling</span> <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's not as simple as you first think,<br/>
🎧 and we can show that by taking a very different <span>approach</span> to it.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely.<br/>
🎧 So let's <span>discuss..</span>.<br/>

🎧 For my <span>project</span> on <span>invertebrates</span>, I <span>chose</span> to <span>study</span> <span>tardigrades</span>.<br/>
🎧 These are <span>microscopic</span>, or to be more <span>precise</span>, <span>near-microscopic</span> <span>animals</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are well over a <span>thousand</span> <span>known</span> <span>species</span> of these <span>tiny</span> <span>animals</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>belong</span> to the <span>phylum</span> <span>Tardigrada</span>.<br/>
🎧 Most <span>tardigrades</span> <span>range</span> in <span>length</span> from <span>0.05</span> to <span>1</span> <span>millimetre</span>,<br/>
🎧 though the <span>largest</span> <span>species</span> can <span>grow</span> to be <span>1.2</span> <span>millimetres</span> in <span>length</span>.<br/>
🎧 They are also sometimes called <span>'water</span> <span>bears'</span>:<br/>
🎧 <span>'water'</span> because that's where they <span>thrive</span> best,<br/>
🎧 and <span>'bear'</span> because of the way they move.<br/>
🎧 <span>'Moss</span> <span>piglet'</span> is another name for <span>tardigrades<br/></span>
🎧 because of the way they look when <span>viewed</span> from the <span>front</span>.<br/>
🎧 They were first <span>discovered</span> in <span>Germany</span> in <span>1773</span> by <span>Johann</span> <span>Goeze</span>,<br/>
🎧 who <span>coined</span> the name <span>Tardigrada</span>.<br/>
🎧 As I say, there are many different <span>species</span> of <span>tardigrade</span>,<br/>
🎧 too many to <span>describe</span> here, but <span>generally</span> <span>speaking</span>, the different <span>species</span> share <span>similar</span> <span>physical</span> <span>traits</span>.<br/>
🎧 They have a <span>body</span> which is short, and also <span>rounded</span>, a bit like a <span>barrel</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>body</span> <span>comprises</span> <span>four</span> <span>segments</span>.<br/>
🎧 Each <span>segment</span> has a <span>pair</span> of <span>legs</span>,<br/>
🎧 at the end of which are between <span>four</span> and <span>eight</span> <span>sharp</span> <span>claws</span>.<br/>
🎧 I should also say that some <span>species</span> don't have any <span>claws;<br/></span>
🎧 what they have are <span>discs</span>,<br/>
🎧 and these work by <span>means</span> of <span>suction</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>enable</span> the <span>tardigrade</span> to <span>cling</span> on to <span>surfaces</span> or to <span>grip</span> its <span>prey</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Within</span> the <span>body</span>, there are no <span>lungs</span>, or any <span>organs</span> for <span>breathing</span> at all.<br/>
🎧 <span>Instead</span>, <span>oxygen</span> and also <span>blood</span> are <span>transported</span> in a <span>fluid</span> that <span>fills</span> the <span>cavity</span> of the <span>body</span>.<br/>
🎧 As <span>far</span> as the <span>tardigrade's</span> <span>head</span> is <span>concerned</span>,<br/>
🎧 the best way I can <span>describe</span> this is that it looks rather <span>strange</span>, a bit <span>squashed</span> even,<br/>
🎧 though many of the <span>websites</span> I <span>looked</span> at <span>described</span> its <span>appearance</span> as <span>cute</span>,<br/>
🎧 which isn't exactly very <span>scientific</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>tardigrade's</span> <span>mouth</span> is a kind of <span>tube<br/></span>
🎧 that can open <span>outwards</span> to <span>reveal</span> <span>teeth-like</span> <span>structures</span> <span>known</span> as <span>'stylets'</span>.<br/>
🎧 These are <span>sharp</span> enough to <span>pierce</span> <span>plant</span> or <span>animal</span> <span>cells</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, where are <span>tardigrades</span> <span>found</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, they live in every <span>part</span> of the <span>world</span>,<br/>
🎧 in a <span>variety</span> of <span>habitats</span>: most <span>commonly</span>, on the bed of a <span>lake</span>,<br/>
🎧 or on many <span>kinds</span> of <span>plants</span> or in very wet <span>environments</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's been some <span>interesting</span> <span>research</span> which has <span>found</span> that <span>tardigrades</span> are <span>capable</span> of <span>surviving</span> <span>radiation<br/></span>
🎧 and very high <span>pressure</span>,<br/>
🎧 and they're also able to <span>withstand</span> <span>temperatures</span> as <span>cold</span> as <span>-200</span> <span>degrees</span> <span>centigrade</span>,<br/>
🎧 or <span>highs</span> of more than <span>148</span> <span>degrees</span> <span>centigrade</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is <span>incredibly</span> hot.<br/>
🎧 It has been said that <span>tardigrades</span> could <span>survive</span> long after <span>human</span> <span>beings</span> have been <span>wiped</span> out,<br/>
🎧 even in the <span>event</span> of an <span>asteroid</span> <span>hitting</span> the <span>earth</span>.<br/>
🎧 If <span>conditions</span> become too <span>extreme</span> and <span>tardigrades</span> are at <span>risk</span> of <span>drying</span> out,<br/>
🎧 they <span>enter</span> a <span>state</span> called <span>cryptobiosis</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>curl</span> into a <span>ball</span>, called a <span>tun</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's <span>T-U-N-</span> by <span>retracting</span> their <span>head</span> and <span>legs</span>,<br/>
🎧 and their <span>metabolism</span> <span>drops</span> to less than one <span>percent</span> of <span>normal</span> <span>levels</span>.<br/>
🎧 They can <span>remain</span> like this until they are <span>re-introduced</span> to water,<br/>
🎧 when they will come back to life in a <span>matter</span> of a few hours.<br/>
🎧 While in a <span>state</span> of <span>cryptobiosis</span>, <span>tardigrades</span> <span>produce</span> a <span>protein</span> that <span>protects</span> their <span>DNA</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>2016</span>, <span>scientists</span> <span>revived</span> two <span>tardigrades</span> that had been <span>tuns</span> for more than <span>30</span> years.<br/>
🎧 There was a <span>report</span> that, in <span>1948</span>,<br/>
🎧 a <span>120-year-old</span> <span>tun</span> was <span>revived</span>,<br/>
🎧 but this <span>experiment</span> has never been <span>repeated</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>currently</span> <span>several</span> <span>tests</span> taking place in <span>space</span>,<br/>
🎧 to <span>determine</span> how long <span>tardigrades</span> might be able to <span>survive</span> there.<br/>
🎧 I <span>believe</span> the <span>record</span> so <span>far</span> is <span>10</span> <span>days</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, <span>erm</span>, <span>moving</span> on.<br/>
🎧 In <span>terms</span> of their <span>diet</span>, <span>tardigrades</span> <span>consume</span> <span>liquids</span> in order to <span>survive</span>.<br/>
🎧 Although they have <span>teeth</span>, they don't use these for <span>chewing</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>suck</span> the <span>juices</span> from <span>moss</span>, or <span>extract</span> <span>fluid</span> from <span>seaweed</span>,<br/>
🎧 but some <span>species</span> <span>prey</span> on other <span>tardigrades</span>,<br/>
🎧 from other <span>species</span> or <span>within</span> their own.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> this isn't <span>surprising</span>, <span>given</span> that <span>tardigrades</span> are <span>mainly</span> <span>comprised</span> of <span>liquid</span> and are <span>coated</span> with a <span>type</span> of <span>gel</span>.<br/>
🎧 Finally, I'd like to <span>mention</span> the <span>conservation</span> <span>status</span> of <span>tardigrades</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is <span>estimated</span> that they have been in <span>existence</span> for <span>approximately</span> <span>half</span> a <span>billion</span> <span>years<br/></span>
🎧 and, in that time, they have <span>survived</span> <span>five</span> <span>mass</span> <span>extinctions</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, it will probably come as no <span>surprise</span> to you,<br/>
🎧 that <span>tardigrades</span> have not been <span>evaluated</span> by the <span>International</span> <span>Union</span> for <span>Conservation</span> of <span>Nature<br/></span>
🎧 and are not on any <span>endangered</span> <span>list</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>researchers</span> have <span>described</span> them as <span>thriving</span>.<br/>
🎧 Does <span>anyone</span> have any <span>questions</span> they'd like to ask?<br/>
