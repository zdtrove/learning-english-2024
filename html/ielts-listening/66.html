🎧 Hi Coleman, how are you?<br/>
🎧 Good, thanks.<br/>
🎧 I wanted to have a chat with you<br/>
🎧 because our friend Josh told me that you've joined a guitar group<br/>
🎧 and it sounds interesting.<br/>
🎧 I'd really like to learn myself.<br/>
🎧 Why don't you come along?<br/>
🎧 I'm sure there's room for another person.<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 So... who runs the classes?<br/>
🎧 He's called a 'coordinator',<br/>
🎧 his name's Gary Mathieson.<br/>
🎧 Let me note that down.<br/>
🎧 Gary....<br/>
🎧 How do you spell his surname?<br/>
🎧 It's Mathieson.<br/>
🎧 Right, thanks.<br/>
🎧 He's retired, actually, but he's a really nice guy<br/>
🎧 and he used to play in a lot of bands.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 So how long have you been going?<br/>
🎧 About a month now.<br/>
🎧 And could you play anything before you started?<br/>
🎧 I knew a few chords, but that's all.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure everyone will be better than me.<br/>
🎧 That's what I thought, too.<br/>
🎧 When I first spoke to Gary on the phone,<br/>
🎧 he said it was a class for beginners,<br/>
🎧 but I was still worried that everyone would be better than me,<br/>
🎧 but we were all equally hopeless!<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's reassuring.<br/>
🎧 So where do you meet?<br/>
🎧 Well, when I joined the group, they were meeting in Gary's home,<br/>
🎧 but as the group got bigger, he decided to book a room at the college in town.<br/>
🎧 I prefer going there.<br/>
🎧 I know that place.<br/>
🎧 I used to go to tap dancing classes there when I was at secondary school.<br/>
🎧 I haven't been since, though and I can't remember what road it's in...<br/>
🎧 Is it Lock Street?<br/>
🎧 It's just beyond there at the bottom of New Street near the city roundabout.<br/>
🎧 Yes, of course.<br/>
🎧 The guitar club is on the first floor in Room T347.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And when do you meet?<br/>
🎧 Is it at the weekend?<br/>
🎧 We meet on Thursdays.<br/>
🎧 It used to be 10.30 and that suited me well,<br/>
🎧 but now we meet at 11.<br/>
🎧 The class that's in there before us asked if they could have the room for another 30 minutes.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I see.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'd love to come, but I don't have a guitar.<br/>
🎧 Well, you can always buy a second-hand one.<br/>
🎧 There's a website called 'The perfect instrument' that sells all kinds of guitars, violins and so on.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you'll find something there.<br/>
🎧 So what's a typical lesson like with Gary?<br/>
🎧 Well, he always starts by getting us to tune our guitars.<br/>
🎧 That takes about five minutes.<br/>
🎧 Uhuh...<br/>
🎧 Some people have an app they use, but others do it by ear.<br/>
🎧 Gary goes round and helps them.<br/>
🎧 And while he's doing that, he tells us what he's going to do during the lesson.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 First, we usually spend about ten minutes doing some strumming.<br/>
🎧 So is that using...<br/>
🎧 Oh... what are they called...<br/>
🎧 Plectrums?<br/>
🎧 No, we just use our thumbs.<br/>
🎧 Oh... much easier.<br/>
🎧 Gary reminds us where to put our fingers for each chord and then we play them together.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes we all just start laughing because we're so bad at keeping time,<br/>
🎧 so Gary starts clapping to help us.<br/>
🎧 Do you learn to play any songs?<br/>
🎧 Yes, we do at least one song with words and chords.<br/>
🎧 I mean that's harder than you think.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I'm sure it is!<br/>
🎧 That part of the lesson takes about 15 minutes.<br/>
🎧 He often brings a recording of the song and plays it to us first.<br/>
🎧 Then he hands out the song and if there's a new chord in it,<br/>
🎧 we practise that before we play it together, but really slowly.<br/>
🎧 Do you do any finger picking?<br/>
🎧 That's the last ten minutes of the lesson,<br/>
🎧 when we pick out the individual notes from a tune he's made up.<br/>
🎧 It's always quite simple.<br/>
🎧 That must be hard, though.<br/>
🎧 It is.<br/>
🎧 But people like it because they can really concentrate<br/>
🎧 and if we're all playing well, it sounds quite impressive.<br/>
🎧 The only trouble is that he sometimes gets us to play one at a time, you know, alone.<br/>
🎧 Oh... that's scary.<br/>
🎧 Um... it is, but I've got used to it now.<br/>
🎧 At the end he spends about five minutes telling us what to practise for the following week.<br/>
🎧 Well, thanks Coleman.<br/>
🎧 I'll go and have a look at that website, I think.<br/>

🎧 I never really planned to be a lifeboat volunteer when I came to live in Northsea.<br/>
🎧 I'd been working in London as a website designer,<br/>
🎧 but although that was interesting, I didn't like city life.<br/>
🎧 I'd been really keen on boats as a teenager,<br/>
🎧 and I thought if I went to live by the sea.<br/>
🎧 I might be able to pursue that interest a bit more in my free time.<br/>
🎧 Then I found that the Lifeboat Institution was looking for volunteers,<br/>
🎧 so I decided to apply.<br/>
🎧 The Lifeboat Institution building here in Northsea's hard to miss,<br/>
🎧 it's one of the largest in the country.<br/>
🎧 It was built 15 years ago with funds provided by a generous member of the public who'd lived here all her life.<br/>
🎧 As the Lifeboat Institution is a charity that relies on that kind of donation,<br/>
🎧 rather than funding provided by the government,<br/>
🎧 that was a huge help to us.<br/>
🎧 When I applied, I had to have a health assessment.<br/>
🎧 The doctors were particularly interested in my vision.<br/>
🎧 I used to be short-sighted,<br/>
🎧 so I'd had to wear glasses,<br/>
🎧 but I'd had laser eye surgery two years earlier so that was okay.<br/>
🎧 They gave me tests for colour blindness<br/>
🎧 and they thought I might have a problem there,<br/>
🎧 but it turned out I was okay.<br/>
🎧 When the coastguard gets an alert,<br/>
🎧 all the volunteers are contacted and rush to the lifeboat station.<br/>
🎧 Our target's to get there in five minutes,<br/>
🎧 then we try to get the boat off the dock and out to sea in another six to eight minutes.<br/>
🎧 Our team's proud that we usually achieve that.<br/>
🎧 The average time across the country's 8.5 minutes.<br/>
🎧 I've recently qualified as what's called a 'helmsman',<br/>
🎧 which means I have the ultimate responsibility for the lifeboat.<br/>
🎧 I have to check that the equipment we use is in working order,<br/>
🎧 the crew have special life jackets that can support up to four people in the water.<br/>
🎧 And it's ultimately my decision whether it's safe to launch the boat.<br/>
🎧 But it's very rare not to launch it, even in the worst weather.<br/>
🎧 As well as going out on the lifeboat, my work involves other things too.<br/>
🎧 A lot of people underestimate how quickly conditions can change at sea,<br/>
🎧 so I speak to youth groups and sailing clubs in the area<br/>
🎧 about the sorts of problems that sailors and swimmers can have if the weather suddenly gets bad.<br/>
🎧 We also have a lot of volunteers who organise activities to raise money for us,<br/>
🎧 and we couldn't manage without them.<br/>
🎧 The training we get is a continuous process,<br/>
🎧 focusing on technical competence and safe handling techniques,<br/>
🎧 and it's given me the confidence to deal with extreme situations without panicking.<br/>
🎧 I was glad I'd done a first aid course before I started,<br/>
🎧 as that's a big help with the casualty care activities we do.<br/>
🎧 We've done a lot on how to deal with ropes and tie knots,<br/>
🎧 that's an essential skill.<br/>
🎧 After a year, I did a one-week residential course, led by specialists.<br/>
🎧 They had a wave-tank where they could create extreme weather conditions,<br/>
🎧 so we could get experience of what to do if the boat turned over in a storm at night, for example.<br/>
🎧 Since I started, I've had to deal with a range of emergency situations.<br/>
🎧 But the work's hugely motivating.<br/>
🎧 It's not just about saving lives.<br/>
🎧 I've learned a lot about the technology involved.<br/>
🎧 My background in IT's been useful here,<br/>
🎧 and I can use my expertise to help other volunteers.<br/>
🎧 They're a great group, we're like a family really,<br/>
🎧 which helps when you're dragging yourself out of bed on a cold stormy night.<br/>
🎧 But actually, it's the colder months that can be the most rewarding time.<br/>
🎧 That's when the incidents tend to be more serious,<br/>
🎧 and you realise that you can make a huge difference to the outcome.<br/>
🎧 So if any of you listeners are interested....<br/>

🎧 Hi Don.<br/>
🎧 Did you get the copy of the article on recycling footwear that I emailed you?<br/>
🎧 Yeah it's here...<br/>
🎧 I've had a look at it.<br/>
🎧 So do you think it's a good topic for our presentation?<br/>
🎧 Well, before I started reading it, I thought recycling footwear...<br/>
🎧 well, although it's quite interesting, perhaps there isn't enough to say about it,<br/>
🎧 cos we put shoes in recycling bins, they go to charity shops and that's about it.<br/>
🎧 But there's much more to it than that.<br/>
🎧 I realise that now and I'm keen to research the topic more.<br/>
🎧 That's great.<br/>
🎧 One of the things I didn't realise until I read the article was just how many pairs of trainers get recycled!<br/>
🎧 Well, a lot of young people wear them all the time now.<br/>
🎧 They've become more popular than ordinary shoes.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 I guess they are very hard-wearing,<br/>
🎧 but don't they look a bit casual for school uniform?<br/>
🎧 I don't think they're right for that.<br/>
🎧 Actually, I think some of them look quite smart on pupils...<br/>
🎧 Better than a scruffy old pair of shoes.<br/>
🎧 So do you keep shoes a long time?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Though I do tend to wear my old pairs for doing dirty jobs like cleaning my bike.<br/>
🎧 I must admit,<br/>
🎧 I've recycled some perfectly good shoes, that haven't gone out of fashion and still fit,<br/>
🎧 just because they don't look great on me anymore.<br/>
🎧 That's awful, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 I think it's common because there's so much choice.<br/>
🎧 The article did say that recent sales of footwear have increased enormously.<br/>
🎧 That didn't surprise me.<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 But then it said that the amount of recycled footwear has fallen:<br/>
🎧 it's 6% now compared to a previous level of 11%.<br/>
🎧 That doesn't seem to make sense.<br/>
🎧 That's because not everything goes through the recycling process.<br/>
🎧 Some footwear just isn't good enough to re-sell, for one reason or another, and gets rejected.<br/>
🎧 So let's find some examples in the article of footwear that was rejected for recycling.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 I think there are some in the interview with the recycling manager.<br/>
🎧 Yeah... here it is.<br/>
🎧 Let's start with the ladies' high-heeled shoes.<br/>
🎧 What did he say about those?<br/>
🎧 He said they were probably expensive.<br/>
🎧 The material was suede and they were beige in colour.<br/>
🎧 It looked like someone had only worn them once, but in a very wet field<br/>
🎧 so the heels were too stained with mud and grass to re-sell them.<br/>
🎧 Okay...<br/>
🎧 And the leather ankle boots.<br/>
🎧 What was wrong with them?<br/>
🎧 Apparently, the heels were worn<br/>
🎧 but that wasn't the problem.<br/>
🎧 One of the shoes was a much lighter shade than the other one.<br/>
🎧 It'd obviously been left in the sun.<br/>
🎧 I suppose even second-hand shoes should look the same!<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 Then there were the red baby shoes.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes...<br/>
🎧 we're told to tie shoes together when we put them in a recycling bin,<br/>
🎧 but people often don't bother.<br/>
🎧 You'd think it would have been easy to find the other, but it wasn't.<br/>
🎧 That was a shame because they were obviously new.<br/>
🎧 The trainers were interesting.<br/>
🎧 He said they looked like they'd been worn by a marathon runner.<br/>
🎧 Yeah... weren't they split?<br/>
🎧 Not exactly.<br/>
🎧 One of the soles was so worn under the foot that you could put your finger through it.<br/>
🎧 Well, we could certainly use some of those examples in our presentation to explain why 90% of shoes that people take to recycling centres or bins get thrown into landfill.<br/>
🎧 What did you think about the project his team set up to avoid this by making new shoes out of the good parts of old shoes?<br/>
🎧 It sounded like a good idea.<br/>
🎧 They get so many shoes, they should be able to match parts.<br/>
🎧 I wasn't surprised that it failed, though.<br/>
🎧 I mean who wants to buy second-hand shoes really?<br/>
🎧 Think of all the germs you could catch!<br/>
🎧 Well, people didn't refuse them for that reason, did they?<br/>
🎧 It was because the pairs of shoes weren't identical.<br/>
🎧 They still managed to ship them overseas, though.<br/>
🎧 That's another area we need to discuss.<br/>
🎧 You know I used to consider this topic just from my own perspective,<br/>
🎧 by thinking about my own recycling behaviour without looking at the bigger picture.<br/>
🎧 So much happens once shoes leave the recycling area.<br/>
🎧 It's not as simple as you first think,<br/>
🎧 and we can show that by taking a very different approach to it.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely.<br/>
🎧 So let's discuss...<br/>

🎧 For my project on invertebrates, I chose to study tardigrades.<br/>
🎧 These are microscopic, or to be more precise, near-microscopic animals.<br/>
🎧 There are well over a thousand known species of these tiny animals,<br/>
🎧 which belong to the phylum Tardigrada.<br/>
🎧 Most tardigrades range in length from 0.05 to 1 millimetre,<br/>
🎧 though the largest species can grow to be 1.2 millimetres in length.<br/>
🎧 They are also sometimes called 'water bears':<br/>
🎧 'water' because that's where they thrive best,<br/>
🎧 and 'bear' because of the way they move.<br/>
🎧 'Moss piglet' is another name for tardigrades<br/>
🎧 because of the way they look when viewed from the front.<br/>
🎧 They were first discovered in Germany in 1773 by Johann Goeze,<br/>
🎧 who coined the name Tardigrada.<br/>
🎧 As I say, there are many different species of tardigrade,<br/>
🎧 too many to describe here, but generally speaking, the different species share similar physical traits.<br/>
🎧 They have a body which is short, and also rounded, a bit like a barrel,<br/>
🎧 and the body comprises four segments.<br/>
🎧 Each segment has a pair of legs,<br/>
🎧 at the end of which are between four and eight sharp claws.<br/>
🎧 I should also say that some species don't have any claws;<br/>
🎧 what they have are discs,<br/>
🎧 and these work by means of suction.<br/>
🎧 They enable the tardigrade to cling on to surfaces or to grip its prey.<br/>
🎧 Within the body, there are no lungs, or any organs for breathing at all.<br/>
🎧 Instead, oxygen and also blood are transported in a fluid that fills the cavity of the body.<br/>
🎧 As far as the tardigrade's head is concerned,<br/>
🎧 the best way I can describe this is that it looks rather strange, a bit squashed even,<br/>
🎧 though many of the websites I looked at described its appearance as cute,<br/>
🎧 which isn't exactly very scientific.<br/>
🎧 The tardigrade's mouth is a kind of tube<br/>
🎧 that can open outwards to reveal teeth-like structures known as 'stylets'.<br/>
🎧 These are sharp enough to pierce plant or animal cells.<br/>
🎧 So, where are tardigrades found?<br/>
🎧 Well, they live in every part of the world,<br/>
🎧 in a variety of habitats: most commonly, on the bed of a lake,<br/>
🎧 or on many kinds of plants or in very wet environments.<br/>
🎧 There's been some interesting research which has found that tardigrades are capable of surviving radiation<br/>
🎧 and very high pressure,<br/>
🎧 and they're also able to withstand temperatures as cold as -200 degrees centigrade,<br/>
🎧 or highs of more than 148 degrees centigrade,<br/>
🎧 which is incredibly hot.<br/>
🎧 It has been said that tardigrades could survive long after human beings have been wiped out,<br/>
🎧 even in the event of an asteroid hitting the earth.<br/>
🎧 If conditions become too extreme and tardigrades are at risk of drying out,<br/>
🎧 they enter a state called cryptobiosis.<br/>
🎧 They curl into a ball, called a tun,<br/>
🎧 that's T-U-N- by retracting their head and legs,<br/>
🎧 and their metabolism drops to less than one percent of normal levels.<br/>
🎧 They can remain like this until they are re-introduced to water,<br/>
🎧 when they will come back to life in a matter of a few hours.<br/>
🎧 While in a state of cryptobiosis, tardigrades produce a protein that protects their DNA.<br/>
🎧 In 2016, scientists revived two tardigrades that had been tuns for more than 30 years.<br/>
🎧 There was a report that, in 1948,<br/>
🎧 a 120-year-old tun was revived,<br/>
🎧 but this experiment has never been repeated.<br/>
🎧 There are currently several tests taking place in space,<br/>
🎧 to determine how long tardigrades might be able to survive there.<br/>
🎧 I believe the record so far is 10 days.<br/>
🎧 So, erm, moving on.<br/>
🎧 In terms of their diet, tardigrades consume liquids in order to survive.<br/>
🎧 Although they have teeth, they don't use these for chewing.<br/>
🎧 They suck the juices from moss, or extract fluid from seaweed,<br/>
🎧 but some species prey on other tardigrades,<br/>
🎧 from other species or within their own.<br/>
🎧 I suppose this isn't surprising, given that tardigrades are mainly comprised of liquid and are coated with a type of gel.<br/>
🎧 Finally, I'd like to mention the conservation status of tardigrades.<br/>
🎧 It is estimated that they have been in existence for approximately half a billion years<br/>
🎧 and, in that time, they have survived five mass extinctions.<br/>
🎧 So, it will probably come as no surprise to you,<br/>
🎧 that tardigrades have not been evaluated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature<br/>
🎧 and are not on any endangered list.<br/>
🎧 Some researchers have described them as thriving.<br/>
🎧 Does anyone have any questions they'd like to ask?<br/>
<br/><br/>
