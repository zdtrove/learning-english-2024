🎧 Good evening. King's Restaurant.<br/>
🎧 Good evening.<br/>
🎧 I'm ringing about the job I understand you have vacant.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to find out a few more details, if i may.<br/>
🎧 Yes, of course. Can i take your name?<br/>
🎧 It's Peter Chin.<br/>
🎧 Okay Peter.<br/>
🎧 Well, if you want to ask about the job and then if we're both still interested,<br/>
🎧 we could arrange for you to come for an interview.<br/>
🎧 Great, thanks.<br/>
🎧 I'm afraid i missed the advert for the job but heard about it from a friend.<br/>
🎧 That's no problem at all.<br/>
🎧 What would you like to know?<br/>
🎧 Well, um, what sort of work is it? Washing up?<br/>
🎧 It's answering the phone.<br/>
🎧 Oh, right, fine.<br/>
🎧 And not waiting at table.<br/>
🎧 That'd be good.<br/>
🎧 And how many nights a week would it be?<br/>
🎧 Well, we're really only busy at the weekend.<br/>
🎧 So two nights?<br/>
🎧 Three actually, so it would work out at twelve hours a week.<br/>
🎧 That'd be fine.<br/>
🎧 It wouldn't interfere with my studies.<br/>
🎧 Are you at the university?<br/>
🎧 Yes. First year Physics student.<br/>
🎧 Oh right.<br/>
🎧 Um, and because I'm not an EU national, would I need a work permit?<br/>
🎧 Yes you would.<br/>
🎧 Just get your tutor to sign it.<br/>
🎧 That wouldn't be a problem, if i were to get the job.<br/>
🎧 Um, where exactly is the restaurant?<br/>
🎧 Well, we have two branches -<br/>
🎧 the one we're recruiting for is in Hillsdunne Road.<br/>
🎧 I don't know that.<br/>
🎧 How do you spell it please?<br/>
🎧 It's HILLSDUNNE Road.<br/>
🎧 Got that. Thanks.<br/>
🎧 is it near a bus stop?<br/>
🎧 Yes. The nearest one would probably be just beside the library.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, I know it. That'd be fine for me.<br/>
🎧 And could I ask about the pay?<br/>
🎧 We're offering £4.45 an hour.<br/>
🎧 That's very good.<br/>
🎧 My last job was £3.95 an hour.<br/>
🎧 We feel it's pretty good and we also offer some good fringe benefits.<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 Well, we give you a free dinner, so you eat well.<br/>
🎧 Right, better than hostel food!<br/>
🎧 We certainly hope so!<br/>
🎧 And we also offer extra pay for working on national holidays.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's a really good perk, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yes, we think so.<br/>
🎧 And then because of the difficulties of getting public transport,<br/>
🎧 if you're working after 11 o'clock we drive you home.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's good to know.<br/>
🎧 Well, we'd certainly be interested in inviting you for an interview, if you're still interested?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, certainly.<br/>
🎧 Could I just also ask what qualities you're looking for?<br/>
🎧 Well, for this particular job we want a clear voice, which you obviously do have!<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 And you must be able to think quickly, you know.<br/>
🎧 Well, I hope I'd...<br/>
🎧 So, when could you come in for an interview?<br/>
🎧 We're actually quite quiet tonight?<br/>
🎧 Sorry, I couldn't come tonight...<br/>
🎧 or tomorrow, I'm afraid.<br/>
🎧 Thursday's okay, that'd be 22nd of October.<br/>
🎧 Fine, after 5 p.m?<br/>
🎧 Yes, fine. Would 6 o'clock be okay?<br/>
🎧 Perfect.<br/>
🎧 And could you bring along the names of two referees?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's fine, no problem.<br/>
🎧 Good, I look forward to seeing you.<br/>
🎧 Oh, by the way, who should i ask for?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, of course, sorry.<br/>

🎧 MANUJA.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 I've got that. Thanks very much.<br/>
🎧 Look forward to seeing you later on then.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Now we go to Jane who is going to tell us about what's happening in town this weekend.<br/>
🎧 Right, thanks Andrew,<br/>
🎧 and now on to what's new,<br/>
🎧 and do we really need yet another sports shop in Bradcaster?<br/>
🎧 Well, most of you probably know Sports World -<br/>
🎧 the branch of a Danish sports goods company that opened a few years ago -<br/>
🎧 it's attracted a lot of custom,<br/>
🎧 and so the company has now decided to open another branch in the area.<br/>
🎧 It's going to be in the shopping centre to the west of Bradcaster.<br/>
🎧 So that will be good news for all of you who found the original shop in the north of the town hard to get to.<br/>
🎧 I was invited to a special preview<br/>
🎧 and I can promise you, this is the ultimate in sports retailing.<br/>
🎧 The whole place has been given a new minimalist look<br/>
🎧 with the company's signature colours of black and red.<br/>
🎧 The first three floors have a huge range of sports clothing as well as equipment,<br/>
🎧 and on the top floor, there's a cafe and a book and DVD section.<br/>
🎧 You'll find all the well-known names as well as some less well-known ones.<br/>
🎧 If they haven't got exactly what you want in stock,<br/>
🎧 they promise to get it for you in ten days.<br/>
🎧 Unlike the other store, where it can take up to fourteen days.<br/>
🎧 They cover all the major sports, including football, tennis and swimming,<br/>
🎧 but they particularly focus on running.<br/>
🎧 and they claim to have the widest range of equipment in the country.<br/>
🎧 As well as that, a whole section of the third floor is devoted to sports bags,<br/>
🎧 including the latest designs from the States.<br/>
🎧 If you can't find what you want here, it doesn't exist!<br/>
🎧 The shop will be open from 9.00 am this Saturday<br/>
🎧 and if you go along to the opening<br/>
🎧 then you'll have the chance to meet the national 400 metres running champion - Paul King,<br/>
🎧 who's coming along to open the shop,<br/>
🎧 and he will be staying around until about midday<br/>
🎧 to chat to any fans who want to meet him and sign autographs.<br/>
🎧 Then there will be a whole range of special attractions all weekend.<br/>
🎧 There will be free tickets for local sporting events for the first 50 customers,<br/>
🎧 and also a special competition open to all.<br/>
🎧 Just answer fifteen out of twenty sports questions correctly<br/>
🎧 to win a signed copy of Paul King's DVD - 'Spring Tips',<br/>
🎧 while the first person to get all the questions correct gets a year's free membership of the Bradcaster Gym.<br/>
🎧 All entrants will receive a special Sports calendar<br/>
🎧 with details of all Bradcaster fixtures in the coming year.<br/>
🎧 One of the special opening offers is a fitness test -<br/>
🎧 a complete review of your cardiac fitness and muscle tone,<br/>
🎧 actually done in the shop by qualified staff.<br/>
🎧 This would normally cost £30<br/>
🎧 but is available at half price for this month only.<br/>
🎧 There are only a limited number of places available for this,<br/>
🎧 so to make a booking, phone 560341.<br/>
🎧 In addition, if you open an account you get lots more special offers<br/>
🎧 including the chance to try out equipment...<br/>

🎧 Before we start, Spiros and Hiroko,<br/>
🎧 thanks for coming in today to talk about your recent study experiences<br/>
🎧 and congratulations to you both in doing so well in your first semester exams!<br/>
🎧 I'd like to discuss with you the value of the English for Academic Purposes course you did here last year<br/>
🎧 before starting your university course.<br/>
🎧 Spiros, if I could start with you,<br/>
🎧 what parts of the programme have now proved to be particularly valuable to you?<br/>
🎧 Um... I think that having to do a seminar presentation really helped me.<br/>
🎧 For example, a couple of weeks ago in our marketing subject,<br/>
🎧 when it was my turn to give a presentation I felt quite confident.<br/>
🎧 Of course, I was still nervous but...<br/>
🎧 because I had done one before, I knew what to expect.<br/>
🎧 Also, I know I was well-prepared and I had practised my timing.<br/>
🎧 In fact, I think that in relation to some of the other people in my group,<br/>
🎧 I did quite a good job because my overall style was quite professional.<br/>
🎧 What about you, Hiroko?<br/>
🎧 Mmm, that's interesting.<br/>
🎧 In my group, I was really surprised by the way the students did their presentations -<br/>
🎧 they just read their notes aloud!<br/>
🎧 Can you believe that?<br/>
🎧 They didn't worry about their presentation style or keeping eye contact with their audience<br/>
🎧 and I remember that these things were really stressed to us in the course here.<br/>
🎧 So, how did you approach your presentation, Hiroko?<br/>
🎧 Well, to speak frankly, I read my notes too!<br/>
🎧 At the time, it was a relief to do it this way, but...<br/>
🎧 actually, when I had finished, I didn't feel any real sense of satisfaction.<br/>
🎧 I didn't feel positive about the experience at all.<br/>
🎧 That's a pity.<br/>
🎧 You know, although I was pleased with my presentation,<br/>
🎧 I am not so pleased with my actual performance right now in the tutorials -<br/>
🎧 during the whole semester, I've not said anything in our tutorial discussions.<br/>
🎧 Not a word.<br/>
🎧 Really, Spiros?<br/>
🎧 Why's that?<br/>
🎧 Do the other students talk too much?<br/>
🎧 It's partly that,<br/>
🎧 but it's mostly because I have had no confidence to speak out.<br/>
🎧 Their style of speaking is so different.<br/>
🎧 It's not the style we were used to during the course.<br/>
🎧 They use so many colloquialisms,<br/>
🎧 they're not very polite and sometimes there seems to be no order in their discussion.<br/>
🎧 Also, they are very familiar with each other,<br/>
🎧 so because they know each other's habits,<br/>
🎧 they can let each other into the discussion.<br/>
🎧 You're right, Spiros, I've experienced that too.<br/>
🎧 For most of this semester, I've said absolutely nothing in tutorials.<br/>
🎧 But recently, I've been trying to speak up more and I just jump in,<br/>
🎧 and I've noticed an interesting thing.<br/>
🎧 I've noticed that if they thought my point was interesting or new,<br/>
🎧 then the next time they actually asked for my opinion,<br/>
🎧 and then it was much easier for me to be part of the discussion.<br/>
🎧 That's great, Hiroko!<br/>
🎧 I hope that happens for me next semester.<br/>
🎧 I'll have to work hard to find some interesting points.<br/>
🎧 What helped you to find these ideas?<br/>
🎧 I think that one thing that helped me with this was the reading.<br/>
🎧 I've had to do so much reading this semester just to help me make sense of the lectures.<br/>
🎧 At first, I couldn't understand what the lecturers were talking about,<br/>
🎧 so I had to turn to the books and journals.<br/>
🎧 Every night I read for hours,<br/>
🎧 using the lists of references that were given, and I made pages of notes.<br/>
🎧 At breakfast, I read and read my notes again.<br/>
🎧 This habit has helped me to follow the ideas in the lectures,<br/>
🎧 and it's also given me some ideas to use in the tutorials.<br/>
🎧 But i did so much reading anyway.<br/>
🎧 I don't think there's any time left over for anything extra.<br/>
🎧 My reading speed is still quite slow,<br/>
🎧 though I'm much better at dealing with vocabulary than I used to be.<br/>
🎧 What else do you think we could add to the course program to help with this reading problem?<br/>
🎧 There's not really anything because it's my problem.<br/>
🎧 I remember we were given long articles to read.<br/>
🎧 We didn't like that but now I realise that reading those long articles was good preparation for the things I need to read now.<br/>
🎧 Also, in class, we regularly had speed-reading tasks to do,<br/>
🎧 and we kept a record of our reading speed,<br/>
🎧 so the teachers were encouraging us to work on that.<br/>
🎧 That's true, Spiros,<br/>
🎧 but what we read could have been different.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes in the English class, I felt frustrated when I had to read articles about the environment or health or education,<br/>
🎧 because I wanted to concentrate on my own field,<br/>
🎧 but we didn't read anything about engineering.<br/>
🎧 So, I think I wasted some time learning vocabulary I didn't need.<br/>
🎧 Hmm... but surely the strategies you were taught for dealing with that vocabulary were helpful.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but psychologically speaking,<br/>
🎧 I would have felt much better working on reading from my own field.<br/>
🎧 What do you think Spiros?<br/>
🎧 Oh, I agree, that would have helped my confidence too<br/>
🎧 and I would have been more motivated.<br/>
🎧 It was good though that we could work on our own topics when we wrote the research assignments.<br/>
🎧 Okay, let's move on to writing now...<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Good afternoon everyone.<br/>
🎧 Well, with some of you about to go out on field work<br/>
🎧 it's timely that in this afternoon's session I'll be sharing some ideas about the reasons why groups of whales and dolphins<br/>
🎧 sometimes swim ashore from the sea right onto the beach and...<br/>
🎧 most often, die in what are known as 'mass strandings'.<br/>
🎧 Unfortunately, this type of event is a frequent occurrence in some of the locations that you'll be travelling to,<br/>
🎧 where sometimes the tide goes out suddenly, confusing the animals.<br/>
🎧 However, there are many other theories about the causes of mass strandings.<br/>
🎧 The first is that the behaviour is linked to parasites.<br/>
🎧 It's often found that stranded animals were infested with large numbers of parasites.<br/>
🎧 For instance, a type of worm is commonly found in the ears of dead whales.<br/>
🎧 Since marine animals rely heavily on their hearing to navigate,<br/>
🎧 this type of infestation has the potential to be very harmful.<br/>
🎧 Another theory is related to toxins, or poisons.<br/>
🎧 These have also been found to contribute to the death of many marine animals.<br/>
🎧 Many toxins, as I'm sure you're aware, originate from plants, or animals.<br/>
🎧 The whale ingests these toxins in its normal feeding behaviour<br/>
🎧 but whether these poisons directly or indirectly lead to stranding and death<br/>
🎧 seems to depend upon the toxin involved.<br/>
🎧 In 1988, for example,<br/>
🎧 14 humpback whales examined after stranding along the beaches of Cape Cod<br/>
🎧 were found to have been poisoned after eating tuna that contained saxitoxin,<br/>
🎧 the same toxin that can be fatal in humans.<br/>
🎧 Alternatively, it has also been suggested that some animals strand accidentally by following their prey ashore in the confusion of the chase.<br/>
🎧 In 1995, David Thurston monitored pilot whales that beached after following squid ashore.<br/>
🎧 However, this idea does not seem to hold true for the majority of mass strandings<br/>
🎧 because examination of the animals' stomach contents reveal that most had not been feeding as they stranded.<br/>
🎧 There are also some new theories which link strandings to humans.<br/>
🎧 A growing concern is that loud noises in the ocean cause strandings.<br/>
🎧 Noises such as those caused by military exercises are of particular concern<br/>
🎧 and have been pinpointed as the cause of some strandings of late.<br/>
🎧 One of these, a mass stranding of whales in 2000 in the Bahamas<br/>
🎧 coincided closely with experiments using a new submarine detection system.<br/>
🎧 There were several factors that made this stranding stand out as different from previous strandings.<br/>
🎧 This led researchers to look for a new cause.<br/>
🎧 For one, all the stranded animals were healthy.<br/>
🎧 In addition, the animals were spread out along 38 kilometres of coast,<br/>
🎧 whereas it's more common for the animals to be found in a group when mass strandings occur.<br/>
🎧 A final theory is related to group behaviour,<br/>
🎧 and suggests that sea mammals cannot distinguish between sick and healthy leaders<br/>
🎧 and will follow sick leaders, even to an inevitable death.<br/>
🎧 This is a particularly interesting theory<br/>
🎧 since the whales that are thought to be most social - the toothed whales -<br/>
🎧 are the group that strand the most frequently.<br/>
🎧 The theory is also supported by evidence from a dolphin stranding in 1994.<br/>
🎧 Examination of the dead animals revealed that apart from the leader,<br/>
🎧 all the others had been healthy at the time of their death.<br/>
🎧 Without one consistent theory however,<br/>
🎧 it is very hard for us to do anything about this phenomenon<br/>
🎧 except to assist animals where and when we can.<br/>
🎧 Stranding networks have been established around the world<br/>
🎧 to aid in rescuing animals and collecting samples from those that could not be helped.<br/>
🎧 I recommend John Connor's Marine Mammals Ashore as an excellent starting point<br/>
🎧 if you're interested in finding out more about these networks, or establishing one yourself.<br/>
<br/><br/>
