🎧 Good <span>evening</span>. <span>King's</span> <span>Restaurant</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good <span>evening</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>ringing</span> about the <span>job</span> I <span>understand</span> you have <span>vacant</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to find out a few more <span>details</span>, if i may.<br/>
🎧 Yes, of course. Can i take your name?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>Peter</span> <span>Chin</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay <span>Peter</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, if you want to ask about the <span>job</span> and then if we're both still interested,<br/>
🎧 we could <span>arrange</span> for you to come for an <span>interview</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great, thanks.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>afraid</span> i <span>missed</span> the <span>advert</span> for the <span>job</span> but heard about it from a friend.<br/>
🎧 That's no <span>problem</span> at all.<br/>
🎧 What would you like to know?<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>um</span>, what <span>sort</span> of work is it? <span>Washing</span> up?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>answering</span> the phone.<br/>
🎧 Oh, right, fine.<br/>
🎧 And not <span>waiting</span> at <span>table</span>.<br/>
🎧 That'd be good.<br/>
🎧 And how many <span>nights</span> a week would it be?<br/>
🎧 Well, we're really only <span>busy</span> at the weekend.<br/>
🎧 So two <span>nights</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Three</span> actually, so it would work out at <span>twelve</span> hours a week.<br/>
🎧 That'd be fine.<br/>
🎧 It wouldn't <span>interfere</span> with my <span>studies</span>.<br/>
🎧 Are you at the university?<br/>
🎧 Yes. First year <span>Physics</span> student.<br/>
🎧 Oh right.<br/>
🎧 <span>Um</span>, and because I'm not an <span>EU</span> <span>national</span>, would I need a work <span>permit</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes you would.<br/>
🎧 Just get your <span>tutor</span> to <span>sign</span> it.<br/>
🎧 That wouldn't be a <span>problem</span>, if i were to get the <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Um</span>, where exactly is the <span>restaurant</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, we have two <span>branches</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 the one we're <span>recruiting</span> for is in <span>Hillsdunne</span> <span>Road</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't know that.<br/>
🎧 How do you <span>spell</span> it please?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>HILLSDUNNE</span> <span>Road</span>.<br/>
🎧 Got that. Thanks.<br/>
🎧 is it near a bus <span>stop</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes. The <span>nearest</span> one would probably be just <span>beside</span> the <span>library</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, I know it. That'd be fine for me.<br/>
🎧 And could I ask about the pay?<br/>
🎧 We're <span>offering</span> <span>£4.45</span> an <span>hour</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's very good.<br/>
🎧 My last <span>job</span> was <span>£3.95</span> an <span>hour</span>.<br/>
🎧 We feel it's <span>pretty</span> good and we also <span>offer</span> some good <span>fringe</span> <span>benefits</span>.<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 Well, we give you a free dinner, so you eat well.<br/>
🎧 Right, better than <span>hostel</span> food!<br/>
🎧 We <span>certainly</span> hope so!<br/>
🎧 And we also <span>offer</span> <span>extra</span> pay for working on <span>national</span> <span>holidays</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's a really good <span>perk</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yes, we think so.<br/>
🎧 And then because of the <span>difficulties</span> of getting <span>public</span> <span>transport</span>,<br/>
🎧 if you're working after <span>11</span> <span>o'clock</span> we drive you home.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's good to know.<br/>
🎧 Well, we'd <span>certainly</span> be interested in <span>inviting</span> you for an <span>interview</span>, if you're still interested?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, <span>certainly</span>.<br/>
🎧 Could I just also ask what <span>qualities</span> you're looking for?<br/>
🎧 Well, for this <span>particular</span> <span>job</span> we want a <span>clear</span> <span>voice</span>, which you <span>obviously</span> do have!<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 And you must be able to think quickly, you know.<br/>
🎧 Well, I hope <span>I'd..</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, when could you come in for an <span>interview</span>?<br/>
🎧 We're actually quite <span>quiet</span> <span>tonight</span>?<br/>
🎧 Sorry, I couldn't come <span>tonight..</span>.<br/>
🎧 or <span>tomorrow</span>, I'm <span>afraid</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Thursday's</span> okay, that'd be <span>22nd</span> of <span>October</span>.<br/>
🎧 Fine, after <span>5</span> <span>p.m</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, fine. Would <span>6</span> <span>o'clock</span> be okay?<br/>
🎧 Perfect.<br/>
🎧 And could you <span>bring</span> along the <span>names</span> of two <span>referees</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's fine, no <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good, I look forward to <span>seeing</span> you.<br/>
🎧 Oh, by the way, who should i ask for?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, of course, sorry.<br/>
🎧 My name is <span>Samira</span> <span>Manuja</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can you <span>spell</span> that, please?<br/>
🎧 <span>MANUJA</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 I've got that. Thanks very much.<br/>
🎧 Look forward to <span>seeing</span> you later on then.<br/>

🎧 Now we go to <span>Jane</span> who is going to tell us about what's <span>happening</span> in <span>town</span> this weekend.<br/>
🎧 Right, thanks <span>Andrew</span>,<br/>
🎧 and now on to what's new,<br/>
🎧 and do we really need yet another <span>sports</span> <span>shop</span> in <span>Bradcaster</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, most of you probably know <span>Sports</span> <span>World</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>branch</span> of a <span>Danish</span> <span>sports</span> <span>goods</span> company that <span>opened</span> a few years ago <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it's <span>attracted</span> a lot of <span>custom</span>,<br/>
🎧 and so the company has now <span>decided</span> to open another <span>branch</span> in the <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's going to be in the <span>shopping</span> <span>centre</span> to the <span>west</span> of <span>Bradcaster</span>.<br/>
🎧 So that will be good <span>news</span> for all of you who <span>found</span> the <span>original</span> <span>shop</span> in the <span>north</span> of the <span>town</span> <span>hard</span> to get to.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>invited</span> to a special <span>preview<br/></span>
🎧 and I can <span>promise</span> you, this is the <span>ultimate</span> in <span>sports</span> <span>retailing</span>.<br/>
🎧 The whole place has been <span>given</span> a new <span>minimalist</span> <span>look<br/></span>
🎧 with the <span>company's</span> <span>signature</span> <span>colours</span> of <span>black</span> and red.<br/>
🎧 The first <span>three</span> <span>floors</span> have a <span>huge</span> <span>range</span> of <span>sports</span> <span>clothing</span> as well as <span>equipment</span>,<br/>
🎧 and on the top <span>floor</span>, there's a <span>cafe</span> and a book and <span>DVD</span> <span>section</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll find all the <span>well-known</span> <span>names</span> as well as some less <span>well-known</span> <span>ones</span>.<br/>
🎧 If they haven't got exactly what you want in <span>stock</span>,<br/>
🎧 they <span>promise</span> to get it for you in ten <span>days</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Unlike</span> the other <span>store</span>, where it can take up to <span>fourteen</span> <span>days</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>cover</span> all the <span>major</span> <span>sports</span>, <span>including</span> <span>football</span>, <span>tennis</span> and <span>swimming</span>,<br/>
🎧 but they <span>particularly</span> focus on <span>running</span>.<br/>
🎧 and they <span>claim</span> to have the <span>widest</span> <span>range</span> of <span>equipment</span> in the <span>country</span>.<br/>
🎧 As well as that, a whole <span>section</span> of the <span>third</span> <span>floor</span> is <span>devoted</span> to <span>sports</span> <span>bags</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>including</span> the <span>latest</span> <span>designs</span> from the <span>States</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you can't find what you want here, it doesn't <span>exist</span>!<br/>
🎧 The <span>shop</span> will be open from <span>9.00</span> am this <span>Saturday<br/></span>
🎧 and if you go along to the <span>opening<br/></span>
🎧 then you'll have the <span>chance</span> to meet the <span>national</span> <span>400</span> <span>metres</span> <span>running</span> <span>champion</span> <span>-</span> <span>Paul</span> <span>King</span>,<br/>
🎧 who's <span>coming</span> along to open the <span>shop</span>,<br/>
🎧 and he will be <span>staying</span> around until about <span>midday<br/></span>
🎧 to <span>chat</span> to any <span>fans</span> who want to meet him and <span>sign</span> <span>autographs</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then there will be a whole <span>range</span> of special <span>attractions</span> all weekend.<br/>
🎧 There will be free <span>tickets</span> for <span>local</span> <span>sporting</span> <span>events</span> for the first <span>50</span> <span>customers</span>,<br/>
🎧 and also a special <span>competition</span> open to all.<br/>
🎧 Just answer <span>fifteen</span> out of <span>twenty</span> <span>sports</span> <span>questions</span> <span>correctly<br/></span>
🎧 to win a <span>signed</span> <span>copy</span> of <span>Paul</span> <span>King's</span> <span>DVD</span> <span>-</span> <span>'Spring</span> <span>Tips'</span>,<br/>
🎧 while the first person to get all the <span>questions</span> <span>correct</span> <span>gets</span> a <span>year's</span> free <span>membership</span> of the <span>Bradcaster</span> Gym.<br/>
🎧 All <span>entrants</span> will <span>receive</span> a special <span>Sports</span> <span>calendar<br/></span>
🎧 with <span>details</span> of all <span>Bradcaster</span> <span>fixtures</span> in the <span>coming</span> year.<br/>
🎧 One of the special <span>opening</span> <span>offers</span> is a <span>fitness</span> <span>test</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 a <span>complete</span> <span>review</span> of your <span>cardiac</span> <span>fitness</span> and <span>muscle</span> <span>tone</span>,<br/>
🎧 actually done in the <span>shop</span> by <span>qualified</span> <span>staff</span>.<br/>
🎧 This would <span>normally</span> <span>cost</span> <span>£30<br/></span>
🎧 but is <span>available</span> at <span>half</span> <span>price</span> for this month only.<br/>
🎧 There are only a <span>limited</span> number of <span>places</span> <span>available</span> for this,<br/>

🎧 Before we start, <span>Spiros</span> and <span>Hiroko</span>,<br/>
🎧 thanks for <span>coming</span> in today to talk about your <span>recent</span> <span>study</span> <span>experiences<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>congratulations</span> to you both in doing so well in your first <span>semester</span> <span>exams</span>!<br/>
🎧 I'd like to <span>discuss</span> with you the <span>value</span> of the English for <span>Academic</span> <span>Purposes</span> course you did here last <span>year<br/></span>
🎧 before <span>starting</span> your university course.<br/>
🎧 <span>Spiros</span>, if I could start with you,<br/>
🎧 what <span>parts</span> of the <span>programme</span> have now <span>proved</span> to be <span>particularly</span> <span>valuable</span> to you?<br/>
🎧 <span>Um..</span>. I think that having to do a <span>seminar</span> <span>presentation</span> really <span>helped</span> me.<br/>
🎧 For example, a <span>couple</span> of <span>weeks</span> ago in our <span>marketing</span> <span>subject</span>,<br/>
🎧 when it was my <span>turn</span> to give a <span>presentation</span> I <span>felt</span> quite <span>confident</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course, I was still <span>nervous</span> <span>but..</span>.<br/>
🎧 because I had done one before, I <span>knew</span> what to <span>expect</span>.<br/>
🎧 Also, I know I was <span>well-prepared</span> and I had <span>practised</span> my <span>timing</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, I think that in <span>relation</span> to some of the other people in my group,<br/>
🎧 I did quite a good <span>job</span> because my <span>overall</span> <span>style</span> was quite <span>professional</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about you, <span>Hiroko</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Mmm</span>, that's <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 In my group, I was really <span>surprised</span> by the way the students did their <span>presentations</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 they just read their <span>notes</span> <span>aloud</span>!<br/>
🎧 Can you <span>believe</span> that?<br/>
🎧 They didn't <span>worry</span> about their <span>presentation</span> <span>style</span> or <span>keeping</span> eye <span>contact</span> with their <span>audience<br/></span>
🎧 and I remember that these things were really <span>stressed</span> to us in the course here.<br/>
🎧 So, how did you <span>approach</span> your <span>presentation</span>, <span>Hiroko</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, to speak <span>frankly</span>, I read my <span>notes</span> too!<br/>
🎧 At the time, it was a <span>relief</span> to do it this way, <span>but..</span>.<br/>
🎧 actually, when I had <span>finished</span>, I didn't feel any <span>real</span> <span>sense</span> of <span>satisfaction</span>.<br/>
🎧 I didn't feel <span>positive</span> about the <span>experience</span> at all.<br/>
🎧 That's a <span>pity</span>.<br/>
🎧 You know, although I was <span>pleased</span> with my <span>presentation</span>,<br/>
🎧 I am not so <span>pleased</span> with my <span>actual</span> <span>performance</span> right now in the <span>tutorials</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 during the whole <span>semester</span>, I've not said anything in our <span>tutorial</span> <span>discussions</span>.<br/>
🎧 Not a <span>word</span>.<br/>
🎧 Really, <span>Spiros</span>?<br/>
🎧 Why's that?<br/>
🎧 Do the other students talk too much?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>partly</span> that,<br/>
🎧 but it's <span>mostly</span> because I have had no <span>confidence</span> to speak out.<br/>
🎧 Their <span>style</span> of <span>speaking</span> is so different.<br/>
🎧 It's not the <span>style</span> we were used to during the course.<br/>
🎧 They use so many <span>colloquialisms</span>,<br/>
🎧 they're not very <span>polite</span> and sometimes there <span>seems</span> to be no order in their <span>discussion</span>.<br/>
🎧 Also, they are very <span>familiar</span> with each other,<br/>
🎧 so because they know each <span>other's</span> <span>habits</span>,<br/>
🎧 they can let each other into the <span>discussion</span>.<br/>
🎧 You're right, <span>Spiros</span>, I've <span>experienced</span> that too.<br/>
🎧 For most of this <span>semester</span>, I've said absolutely <span>nothing</span> in <span>tutorials</span>.<br/>
🎧 But <span>recently</span>, I've been trying to speak up more and I just <span>jump</span> in,<br/>
🎧 and I've <span>noticed</span> an <span>interesting</span> thing.<br/>
🎧 I've <span>noticed</span> that if they thought my <span>point</span> was <span>interesting</span> or new,<br/>
🎧 then the next time they actually <span>asked</span> for my <span>opinion</span>,<br/>
🎧 and then it was much <span>easier</span> for me to be <span>part</span> of the <span>discussion</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's great, <span>Hiroko</span>!<br/>
🎧 I hope that <span>happens</span> for me next <span>semester</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll have to work <span>hard</span> to find some <span>interesting</span> <span>points</span>.<br/>
🎧 What <span>helped</span> you to find these <span>ideas</span>?<br/>
🎧 I think that one thing that <span>helped</span> me with this was the <span>reading</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've had to do so much <span>reading</span> this <span>semester</span> just to help me make <span>sense</span> of the <span>lectures</span>.<br/>
🎧 At first, I couldn't <span>understand</span> what the <span>lecturers</span> were talking about,<br/>
🎧 so I had to <span>turn</span> to the books and <span>journals</span>.<br/>
🎧 Every <span>night</span> I read for hours,<br/>
🎧 <span>using</span> the <span>lists</span> of <span>references</span> that were <span>given</span>, and I made <span>pages</span> of <span>notes</span>.<br/>
🎧 At <span>breakfast</span>, I read and read my <span>notes</span> again.<br/>
🎧 This <span>habit</span> has <span>helped</span> me to <span>follow</span> the <span>ideas</span> in the <span>lectures</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it's also <span>given</span> me some <span>ideas</span> to use in the <span>tutorials</span>.<br/>
🎧 But i did so much <span>reading</span> <span>anyway</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't think there's any time <span>left</span> over for anything <span>extra</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>reading</span> <span>speed</span> is still quite <span>slow</span>,<br/>
🎧 though I'm much better at <span>dealing</span> with <span>vocabulary</span> than I used to be.<br/>
🎧 What else do you think we could add to the course <span>program</span> to help with this <span>reading</span> <span>problem</span>?<br/>
🎧 There's not really anything because it's my <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 I remember we were <span>given</span> long <span>articles</span> to read.<br/>
🎧 We didn't like that but now I <span>realise</span> that <span>reading</span> those long <span>articles</span> was good <span>preparation</span> for the things I need to read now.<br/>
🎧 Also, in class, we <span>regularly</span> had <span>speed-reading</span> <span>tasks</span> to do,<br/>
🎧 and we <span>kept</span> a <span>record</span> of our <span>reading</span> <span>speed</span>,<br/>
🎧 so the <span>teachers</span> were <span>encouraging</span> us to work on that.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>true</span>, <span>Spiros</span>,<br/>
🎧 but what we read could have been different.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes in the English class, I <span>felt</span> <span>frustrated</span> when I had to read <span>articles</span> about the <span>environment</span> or <span>health</span> or <span>education</span>,<br/>
🎧 because I wanted to <span>concentrate</span> on my own <span>field</span>,<br/>
🎧 but we didn't read anything about <span>engineering</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, I think I <span>wasted</span> some time <span>learning</span> <span>vocabulary</span> I didn't need.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm..</span>. but <span>surely</span> the <span>strategies</span> you were <span>taught</span> for <span>dealing</span> with that <span>vocabulary</span> were <span>helpful</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but <span>psychologically</span> <span>speaking</span>,<br/>
🎧 I would have <span>felt</span> much better working on <span>reading</span> from my own <span>field</span>.<br/>
🎧 What do you think <span>Spiros</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh, I agree, that would have <span>helped</span> my <span>confidence</span> <span>too<br/></span>
🎧 and I would have been more <span>motivated</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was good though that we could work on our own <span>topics</span> when we <span>wrote</span> the <span>research</span> <span>assignments</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, let's move on to <span>writing</span> <span>now..</span>.<br/>

🎧 Good <span>afternoon</span> everyone.<br/>
🎧 Well, with some of you about to go out on <span>field</span> <span>work<br/></span>
🎧 it's <span>timely</span> that in this <span>afternoon's</span> <span>session</span> I'll be <span>sharing</span> some <span>ideas</span> about the <span>reasons</span> why <span>groups</span> of <span>whales</span> and <span>dolphins<br/></span>
🎧 sometimes <span>swim</span> <span>ashore</span> from the sea right <span>onto</span> the <span>beach</span> <span>and..</span>.<br/>
🎧 most often, <span>die</span> in what are <span>known</span> as <span>'mass</span> <span>strandings'</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Unfortunately</span>, this <span>type</span> of <span>event</span> is a <span>frequent</span> <span>occurrence</span> in some of the <span>locations</span> that you'll be <span>travelling</span> to,<br/>
🎧 where sometimes the <span>tide</span> <span>goes</span> out <span>suddenly</span>, <span>confusing</span> the <span>animals</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, there are many other <span>theories</span> about the <span>causes</span> of <span>mass</span> <span>strandings</span>.<br/>
🎧 The first is that the <span>behaviour</span> is <span>linked</span> to <span>parasites</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's often <span>found</span> that <span>stranded</span> <span>animals</span> were <span>infested</span> with large <span>numbers</span> of <span>parasites</span>.<br/>
🎧 For <span>instance</span>, a <span>type</span> of <span>worm</span> is <span>commonly</span> <span>found</span> in the <span>ears</span> of <span>dead</span> <span>whales</span>.<br/>
🎧 Since <span>marine</span> <span>animals</span> <span>rely</span> <span>heavily</span> on their <span>hearing</span> to <span>navigate</span>,<br/>
🎧 this <span>type</span> of <span>infestation</span> has the <span>potential</span> to be very <span>harmful</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>theory</span> is <span>related</span> to <span>toxins</span>, or <span>poisons</span>.<br/>
🎧 These have also been <span>found</span> to <span>contribute</span> to the <span>death</span> of many <span>marine</span> <span>animals</span>.<br/>
🎧 Many <span>toxins</span>, as I'm sure you're <span>aware</span>, <span>originate</span> from <span>plants</span>, or <span>animals</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>whale</span> <span>ingests</span> these <span>toxins</span> in its <span>normal</span> <span>feeding</span> <span>behaviour<br/></span>
🎧 but <span>whether</span> these <span>poisons</span> <span>directly</span> or <span>indirectly</span> <span>lead</span> to <span>stranding</span> and <span>death<br/></span>
🎧 <span>seems</span> to <span>depend</span> <span>upon</span> the <span>toxin</span> <span>involved</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>1988</span>, for example,<br/>
🎧 <span>14</span> <span>humpback</span> <span>whales</span> <span>examined</span> after <span>stranding</span> along the <span>beaches</span> of <span>Cape</span> <span>Cod<br/></span>
🎧 were <span>found</span> to have been <span>poisoned</span> after <span>eating</span> <span>tuna</span> that <span>contained</span> <span>saxitoxin</span>,<br/>
🎧 the same <span>toxin</span> that can be <span>fatal</span> in <span>humans</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Alternatively</span>, it has also been <span>suggested</span> that some <span>animals</span> <span>strand</span> <span>accidentally</span> by <span>following</span> their <span>prey</span> <span>ashore</span> in the <span>confusion</span> of the <span>chase</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>1995</span>, <span>David</span> <span>Thurston</span> <span>monitored</span> <span>pilot</span> <span>whales</span> that <span>beached</span> after <span>following</span> <span>squid</span> <span>ashore</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, this idea does not <span>seem</span> to <span>hold</span> <span>true</span> for the <span>majority</span> of <span>mass</span> <span>strandings<br/></span>
🎧 because <span>examination</span> of the <span>animals'</span> <span>stomach</span> <span>contents</span> <span>reveal</span> that most had not been <span>feeding</span> as they <span>stranded</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are also some new <span>theories</span> which <span>link</span> <span>strandings</span> to <span>humans</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>growing</span> <span>concern</span> is that <span>loud</span> <span>noises</span> in the <span>ocean</span> <span>cause</span> <span>strandings</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Noises</span> such as those <span>caused</span> by <span>military</span> <span>exercises</span> are of <span>particular</span> <span>concern<br/></span>
🎧 and have been <span>pinpointed</span> as the <span>cause</span> of some <span>strandings</span> of <span>late</span>.<br/>
🎧 One of these, a <span>mass</span> <span>stranding</span> of <span>whales</span> in <span>2000</span> in the <span>Bahamas<br/></span>
🎧 <span>coincided</span> <span>closely</span> with <span>experiments</span> <span>using</span> a new <span>submarine</span> <span>detection</span> <span>system</span>.<br/>
🎧 There were <span>several</span> <span>factors</span> that made this <span>stranding</span> <span>stand</span> out as different from <span>previous</span> <span>strandings</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>led</span> <span>researchers</span> to look for a new <span>cause</span>.<br/>
🎧 For one, all the <span>stranded</span> <span>animals</span> were <span>healthy</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>addition</span>, the <span>animals</span> were <span>spread</span> out along <span>38</span> <span>kilometres</span> of <span>coast</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>whereas</span> it's more <span>common</span> for the <span>animals</span> to be <span>found</span> in a group when <span>mass</span> <span>strandings</span> <span>occur</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>final</span> <span>theory</span> is <span>related</span> to group <span>behaviour</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>suggests</span> that sea <span>mammals</span> <span>cannot</span> <span>distinguish</span> between <span>sick</span> and <span>healthy</span> <span>leaders<br/></span>
🎧 and will <span>follow</span> <span>sick</span> <span>leaders</span>, even to an <span>inevitable</span> <span>death</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is a <span>particularly</span> <span>interesting</span> <span>theory<br/></span>
🎧 since the <span>whales</span> that are thought to be most <span>social</span> <span>-</span> the <span>toothed</span> <span>whales</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 are the group that <span>strand</span> the most <span>frequently</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>theory</span> is also <span>supported</span> by <span>evidence</span> from a <span>dolphin</span> <span>stranding</span> in <span>1994</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Examination</span> of the <span>dead</span> <span>animals</span> <span>revealed</span> that <span>apart</span> from the <span>leader</span>,<br/>
🎧 all the <span>others</span> had been <span>healthy</span> at the time of their <span>death</span>.<br/>
🎧 Without one <span>consistent</span> <span>theory</span> <span>however</span>,<br/>
🎧 it is very <span>hard</span> for us to do anything about this <span>phenomenon<br/></span>
🎧 <span>except</span> to <span>assist</span> <span>animals</span> where and when we can.<br/>
🎧 <span>Stranding</span> <span>networks</span> have been <span>established</span> around the <span>world<br/></span>
🎧 to <span>aid</span> in <span>rescuing</span> <span>animals</span> and <span>collecting</span> <span>samples</span> from those that could not be <span>helped</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>recommend</span> <span>John</span> <span>Connor's</span> <span>Marine</span> <span>Mammals</span> <span>Ashore</span> as an <span>excellent</span> <span>starting</span> <span>point<br/></span>
🎧 if you're interested in <span>finding</span> out more about these <span>networks</span>, or <span>establishing</span> one yourself.<br/>
