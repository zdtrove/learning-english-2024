🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 How can I help you?<br/>
🎧 I <span>understand</span> that the school <span>organises..</span>. <span>um</span>, <span>trips</span> to <span>different..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, we run <span>five</span> every <span>month:<br/></span>
🎧 <span>three</span> during <span>weekends</span> and two <span>Wednesday</span> <span>afternoon</span> <span>trips</span>.<br/>
🎧 What <span>sort</span> of <span>places</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>obviously</span> it <span>varies</span>,<br/>
🎧 but always <span>places</span> of <span>historical</span> <span>interest<br/></span>
🎧 and also which <span>offer</span> a <span>variety</span> of <span>shopping</span>, because our students always ask about <span>that..</span>.<br/>
🎧 and then we go for <span>ones</span> where we know there are <span>guided</span> <span>tours</span>,<br/>
🎧 because this <span>gives</span> a good focus for the visit.<br/>
🎧 Do you travel <span>far</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, we're <span>lucky</span> here, <span>obviously</span>,<br/>
🎧 because we're able to say that all our <span>visits</span> are less than <span>three</span> hours drive.<br/>
🎧 How much do they <span>cost</span>?<br/>
🎧 Again, it <span>varies</span>,<br/>
🎧 between <span>five</span> and <span>fifteen</span> <span>pounds</span> a <span>head</span>, <span>depending</span> on <span>distance</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and we do <span>offer</span> to <span>arrange</span> special <span>trips</span> if, you know, there are more than <span>twelve</span> people.<br/>
🎧 Oh right, I'll keep that in <span>mind</span>.<br/>
🎧 And what are the <span>times</span> <span>normally</span>?<br/>
🎧 We try to keep it <span>pretty</span> <span>fixed</span> so that, that students get to know the <span>pattern</span>.<br/>
🎧 We leave at <span>8.30</span> <span>a.m</span>. and <span>return</span> at <span>6</span> <span>p.m</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>figure</span> it's best to keep the day <span>fairly</span> short.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes. And, <span>um</span>, how do we <span>reserve</span> a place?<br/>
🎧 You <span>sign</span> your name on the <span>notice</span> <span>board</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you know where it is?<br/>
🎧 Ah <span>ha</span>. I saw it this morning.<br/>
🎧 And we do ask that you <span>sign</span> up <span>three</span> <span>days</span> in <span>advance<br/></span>
🎧 so we know we've got enough people interested to run it,<br/>
🎧 and we can <span>cancel</span> if <span>necessary</span>, with full <span>refund</span> of course.<br/>
🎧 That's fine, thanks.<br/>
🎧 And what <span>visits</span> are <span>planned</span> for this <span>term</span>?<br/>
🎧 Right, well, I'm <span>afraid</span> the <span>schedule</span> hasn't been <span>printed</span> out yet,<br/>
🎧 but, <span>uh..</span>. we have <span>confirmed</span> the <span>dates</span> and <span>planned</span> the <span>optional</span> <span>extra</span> <span>visits<br/></span>
🎧 which you can also book in <span>advance</span> if you want to.<br/>
🎧 Oh that's all right.<br/>
🎧 If you can just give some idea of the weekend <span>ones<br/></span>
🎧 so I can, you know, work out when to see friends, <span>etcetera</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh sure.<br/>
🎧 Well, the first one is <span>St</span> <span>Ives</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's on the <span>13th</span> of <span>February<br/></span>
🎧 and we'll have only <span>sixteen</span> <span>places</span> <span>available</span> <span>'cos</span> we're going by <span>minibus</span>.<br/>
🎧 And that's a day in <span>town</span> with the <span>optional</span> <span>extra</span> of <span>visiting</span> the <span>Hepworth</span> <span>Museum</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>right..</span>. <span>yeah..</span>. that sounds good.<br/>
🎧 Then there's a <span>London</span> <span>trip</span> on the <span>sixteenth</span> of <span>February<br/></span>
🎧 and we'll be taking a <span>medium-sized</span> <span>coach</span> so <span>there'll</span> be <span>45</span> <span>places</span> on that,<br/>
🎧 and, let's see, the <span>optional</span> <span>extra</span> is the <span>Tower</span> of <span>London</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I've already been there.<br/>
🎧 After that there's <span>Bristol</span> on the <span>3rd</span> of <span>March</span>.<br/>
🎧 Where?<br/>
🎧 <span>Bristol..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>BRISTOL</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Okay..</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's in a different <span>minibus</span> with <span>18</span> <span>places</span> <span>available</span>,<br/>
🎧 oh, and the <span>optional</span> <span>extra</span> is a visit to the <span>S.S</span>. Great <span>Britain</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Okay..</span>.<br/>
🎧 We're going to <span>Salisbury</span> on the <span>eighteenth</span> of <span>March<br/></span>
🎧 and that's always a <span>popular</span> one because the <span>optional</span> <span>extra</span> is <span>Stonehenge</span>,<br/>
🎧 so we're taking the large <span>coach</span> with <span>fifty</span> <span>seats..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh good.<br/>
🎧 And then the last one is to <span>Bath</span> on the <span>23rd</span> of <span>March</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes. Is <span>Bath</span> the <span>Roman</span> <span>city</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's right,<br/>
🎧 and that's in the <span>sixteen-seater</span> <span>minibus</span>.<br/>
🎧 And where's the <span>optional</span> visit?<br/>
🎧 It's to the <span>American</span> <span>Museum</span> <span>-</span> well <span>worth</span> a visit.<br/>
🎧 Okay, well that's great, thanks for all <span>that..</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>pleasure</span>.<br/>

🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Or, have a <span>word</span> with my <span>assistant;<br/></span>
🎧 her name is <span>Jane</span> <span>Yentob</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 that's <span>YENTOB</span>.<br/>

🎧 Good <span>afternoon</span> <span>everybody<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>welcome</span> to <span>Riverside</span> <span>Industrial</span> <span>Village</span>.<br/>
🎧 To start your visit, I'm just going to give you a <span>brief</span> <span>account</span> of the <span>history</span> of the <span>museum<br/></span>
🎧 before <span>letting</span> you <span>roam</span> about on your own.<br/>
🎧 I won't keep you long. Okay?<br/>
🎧 Now, from where we're <span>standing<br/></span>
🎧 you've got a good <span>view</span> of the <span>river</span> over there.<br/>
🎧 And it was because of this <span>fast-flowing</span> <span>water<br/></span>
🎧 that this <span>site</span> was a <span>natural</span> place for <span>manufacturing</span> <span>works</span>.<br/>
🎧 The water and the <span>availability</span> of raw <span>materials</span> in the <span>area</span>, like <span>minerals</span> and <span>iron</span> <span>ore</span>,<br/>
🎧 and also the <span>abundance</span> of <span>local</span> <span>fuels</span>, like <span>coal</span> and <span>firewood</span>,<br/>
🎧 all made this <span>site</span> <span>suitable</span> for <span>industry</span> from a very <span>early</span> time.<br/>
🎧 Water was the <span>main</span> <span>source</span> of <span>power</span> for the <span>early</span> <span>industries<br/></span>
🎧 and some of the water <span>wheels</span> were first <span>established</span> in the <span>12th</span> <span>century</span>, would you <span>believe</span>?<br/>
🎧 At that time, <span>local</span> <span>craftsmen</span> first <span>built</span> an <span>iron</span> <span>forge<br/></span>
🎧 just behind the <span>village</span> here, on the <span>bend</span> in the <span>river</span>.<br/>
🎧 By the <span>17th</span> and <span>18th</span> <span>centuries</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>region's</span> <span>rivers</span> <span>supported</span> more than <span>160</span> water <span>mills</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and many of these <span>continued</span> to <span>operate</span> well into the <span>19th</span> <span>century</span>.<br/>
🎧 But then, the <span>steam</span> <span>engine</span> was <span>invented<br/></span>
🎧 and then the <span>railways</span> <span>came<br/></span>
🎧 and the <span>centres</span> of <span>industry</span> were able to move away from the <span>rivers</span> and the <span>countryside</span> and into the <span>towns</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, <span>industrial</span> <span>villages</span> like this one <span>became</span> very <span>rare</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, that's the <span>history</span> for you.<br/>
🎧 If you'd like any more <span>information</span>, you can ask me some <span>questions</span>,<br/>
🎧 or you can read <span>further</span> in our <span>excellent</span> <span>guide</span> book.<br/>
🎧 Now I'm going to give you a plan of the <span>site<br/></span>
🎧 and I'd just like to <span>point</span> out where everything <span>is<br/></span>
🎧 and then you can take a look at everything for yourself.<br/>
🎧 I've already <span>pointed</span> out the <span>river</span>, which is on the <span>left</span>.<br/>
🎧 And of course, <span>running</span> along the <span>bottom</span> is <span>Woodside</span> <span>Road</span>,<br/>
🎧 got it?<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Now, we're <span>standing</span> at the <span>entrance</span>,<br/>
🎧 see it at the <span>bottom</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>immediately</span> to our right is the <span>Ticket</span> <span>Office</span>.<br/>
🎧 You won't need that because you've got your group <span>booking</span>,<br/>
🎧 but just <span>past</span> it are the <span>toilets</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 always good to know where they are.<br/>
🎧 In <span>front</span> of us is the car <span>park</span>, as you can see,<br/>
🎧 and to the <span>left</span>, by the <span>entry</span> <span>gate</span> is the <span>Gift</span> <span>Shop</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's where you can get <span>copies</span> of the <span>guide</span>, like this one here.<br/>
🎧 Now, <span>beyond</span> the car <span>park</span>,<br/>
🎧 all the <span>buildings</span> are <span>arranged</span> in a <span>half</span> <span>circle</span> with a <span>yard</span> in the <span>middle</span>.<br/>
🎧 The big, <span>stone</span> <span>building</span> at the top is the <span>main</span> <span>Workshop</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's where the <span>furnace</span> <span>is<br/></span>
🎧 and where all the <span>metal</span> was <span>smelted</span> and the <span>tools</span> were <span>cast</span>,<br/>
🎧 as you'll be able to see.<br/>
🎧 Now, in the top <span>right-hand</span> <span>corner</span>,<br/>
🎧 that <span>building</span> with <span>bigger</span> <span>windows</span> is the <span>Showroom</span>,<br/>
🎧 where <span>samples</span> of all the <span>tools</span> that were made through the <span>ages</span> are on <span>display</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the top <span>left</span> <span>corner</span> is the <span>Grinding</span> <span>Shop</span>,<br/>
🎧 where the <span>tools</span> were <span>sharpened</span> and <span>finished</span>.<br/>
🎧 And on one side of that you can see the <span>Engine</span> <span>Room<br/></span>
🎧 and on the other is the <span>Café</span>,<br/>
🎧 which isn't an <span>antique</span>, you'll be <span>pleased</span> to know,<br/>
🎧 though they do <span>serve</span> very nice <span>old-fashioned</span> <span>teas</span>.<br/>
🎧 The row of <span>buildings</span> you can see on the <span>left</span> are the <span>cottages</span>.<br/>
🎧 These were <span>built</span> for the <span>workers</span> <span>towards</span> the end of the <span>18th</span> <span>century<br/></span>
🎧 and they're still <span>furnished</span> from that <span>period<br/></span>
🎧 so you can get a good idea of <span>ordinary</span> <span>people's</span> living <span>conditions</span>.<br/>
🎧 Across the <span>yard</span> from them,<br/>
🎧 you can see the <span>stables</span> where the <span>horses</span> were <span>kept</span> for <span>transporting</span> the <span>products</span>.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>separate</span> <span>building</span> in <span>front</span> of them is the <span>Works</span> <span>Office<br/></span>
🎧 and that still has some of the old <span>accounts</span> on <span>display</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, if <span>anyone</span> <span>wants</span> a <span>guided</span> <span>tour</span> then I'm <span>starting</span> at the <span>Engine</span> Room.<br/>
🎧 If you'd like to come along, this way please, <span>ladies</span> and <span>gentlemen</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 <span>Excuse</span> me, <span>Dr</span> <span>Johnson</span>.<br/>
🎧 May I speak to you for a <span>minute</span>?<br/>
🎧 Sure. Come in.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>Melanie</span> <span>Griffin</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm taking your course in <span>Population</span> <span>Studies</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right. Well, <span>Melanie</span>, how can I help you?<br/>
🎧 I'm having a bit of <span>trouble</span> with the second <span>assignment</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it's <span>due</span> in <span>12</span> <span>days</span>.<br/>
🎧 What <span>sort</span> of <span>trouble</span> are you having?<br/>
🎧 Is the <span>assignment</span> <span>question</span> a <span>problem</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, that's <span>part</span> of the <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm also having <span>-</span> been having <span>trouble</span> getting <span>hold</span> of the books.<br/>
🎧 I've been to the <span>library</span> <span>several</span> <span>times</span>, and all the books are out.<br/>
🎧 Sounds like you should have <span>started</span> <span>borrowing</span> books a bit <span>earlier</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, I had a really big <span>assignment</span> <span>due</span> in for another course, <span>and..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've been spending all my time on that, and I <span>thought..</span>.<br/>
🎧 You might get an <span>extension</span> of time to <span>finish</span> your <span>assignment</span> for me?<br/>
🎧 If that's <span>possible</span>, but I don't <span>know..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, yes, it is <span>possible</span>, <span>but..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>extensions</span> are <span>normally</span> <span>given</span> only for <span>medical</span> or <span>compassionate</span> <span>reasons</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>otherwise</span>, it's really a <span>question</span> of <span>organising</span> your <span>study</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we don't like <span>giving</span> <span>extensions</span> to students who <span>simply</span> didn't plan their work <span>properly</span>.<br/>
🎧 What did you get for your first <span>assignment</span>?<br/>
🎧 I got <span>87%</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, you did very well <span>indeed</span>,<br/>
🎧 so <span>obviously</span>, you can <span>produce</span> good work.<br/>
🎧 I don't think I'll need too much <span>extra</span> time,<br/>
🎧 as long as I can get <span>hold</span> of some of the important <span>references</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, since you did so well in your first <span>assignment</span>,<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>prepared</span> to give you an <span>extra</span> two <span>weeks</span> for this one,<br/>
🎧 so <span>that'll</span> mean you'll need to <span>submit</span> it about a month from now.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Now, what about the <span>reading</span> <span>materials</span>?<br/>
🎧 Have you <span>checked</span> out the <span>journal</span> <span>articles</span> in the <span>list</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Umm</span>, no, not yet,<br/>
🎧 there were about <span>20</span> of them, <span>and..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I wasn't sure which <span>ones</span> would be most useful or important.<br/>
🎧 Well, they're all useful,<br/>
🎧 but I don't <span>expect</span> <span>anyone</span> to read them all, because a number of them <span>deal</span> with the same issues.<br/>
🎧 Let me give you some <span>suggestions</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>article</span> by <span>Anderson</span> and <span>Hawker</span> is really <span>worth</span> <span>reading</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, I'll read that one.<br/>
🎧 You should also read the <span>article</span> by <span>Jackson</span>,<br/>
🎧 but just look at the <span>part</span> on the <span>research</span> <span>methodology</span> <span>-</span> how they did it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Okay..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Jackson</span>, got <span>that..</span>.<br/>
🎧 And if you have time, the one by <span>Roberts</span> says very <span>relevant</span> things,<br/>
🎧 although it's not <span>essential</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, if it's useful, I'll try and read that <span>one..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, the one by <span>Morris</span>.<br/>
🎧 I wouldn't <span>bother</span> with that at this <span>stage</span>, if I were you.<br/>
🎧 Okay, I won't <span>bother</span> with <span>Morris</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, now, <span>someone</span> told me the <span>article</span> by <span>Cooper</span> is important.<br/>
🎧 Well, yes, in a way,<br/>
🎧 but just look at the last <span>part</span>, where he <span>discusses</span> the <span>research</span> <span>results</span>.<br/>
🎧 And <span>lastly</span>, there's <span>Forster</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 I can't think why I <span>included</span> that one.<br/>
🎧 It's not bad and could be of some help, but not that much.<br/>
🎧 Now, let's <span>deal</span> with the <span>assignment</span> <span>question</span>.<br/>
🎧 What's the <span>problem</span> there?<br/>
🎧 It's the <span>graph</span> on <span>page</span> two.<br/>
🎧 What <span>seems</span> to be the <span>problem</span>? It's just the <span>bar</span> <span>graph</span> <span>showing</span> <span>reasons</span> why people change where they live.<br/>
🎧 Well, I've got a <span>photocopy</span> but the <span>reasons</span> at the <span>bottom</span> are <span>missing</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ah, okay.<br/>
🎧 Look at the first <span>bar</span> on the <span>graph</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 now that <span>indicates</span> the number of people who move because they want more <span>space</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh I <span>see..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>bar</span> <span>one..</span>. <span>okay..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now what about the next <span>bar</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Bar</span> two is to do with the people living <span>nearby</span> <span>disturbing</span> them,<br/>
🎧 so they <span>chose</span> to move away to somewhere <span>quieter</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now let's look at <span>bar</span> number <span>three..</span>.<br/>
🎧 another <span>reason</span> people change their place of <span>living<br/></span>
🎧 is because they want to be <span>closer</span> to the <span>city</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 <span>Proximity</span> to the <span>city</span> is an <span>issue..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, <span>bar</span> number <span>four</span> <span>refers</span> to <span>problems</span> when the <span>owner</span> of the <span>property</span> won't help fix things that go wrong.<br/>
🎧 In other <span>words</span>, the <span>owner</span> is not <span>helpful</span> and so the <span>tenants</span> move out.<br/>
🎧 <span>Okay..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now what about <span>bar</span> <span>five</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Bar</span> <span>five</span> is about those people who move <span>because..</span>.<br/>
🎧 they need a bus or <span>train</span> to get them into the <span>city</span> or to go to work.<br/>
🎧 <span>Okay..</span>.<br/>
🎧 And <span>bar</span> six?<br/>
🎧 <span>Bar</span> number six is <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 That <span>reason</span> was <span>given</span> quite a lot <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 people <span>moving</span> because they wanted to be in a more <span>attractive</span> <span>neighbourhood</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes, thank you very much.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Good day, <span>ladies</span> and <span>gentlemen</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have been <span>asked</span> today to talk to you about the <span>urban</span> <span>landscape</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are two <span>major</span> <span>areas</span> that I will focus on in my <span>talk:<br/></span>
🎧 how <span>vegetation</span> can have a <span>significant</span> <span>effect</span> on <span>urban</span> <span>climate</span>,<br/>
🎧 and how we can better plan our <span>cities</span> <span>using</span> <span>trees<br/></span>
🎧 to <span>provide</span> a more <span>comfortable</span> <span>environment</span> for us to live in.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trees</span> can have a <span>significant</span> <span>impact</span> on our <span>cities</span>.<br/>
🎧 They can make a <span>city</span>, as a whole, a bit less <span>windy<br/></span>
🎧 or a bit more <span>windy</span>, if that's what you want.<br/>
🎧 They can make it a bit <span>cooler</span> if it's a hot <span>summer</span> day in an <span>Australian</span> <span>city</span>,<br/>
🎧 or they can make it a bit more <span>humid</span> if it's a dry <span>inland</span> <span>city</span>.<br/>
🎧 On the <span>local</span> <span>scale</span> <span>-</span> that is, in <span>particular</span> <span>areas</span> <span>within</span> the <span>city</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>trees</span> can make the <span>local</span> <span>area</span> more <span>shady</span>, <span>cooler</span>,<br/>
🎧 more <span>humid</span> and much less <span>windy</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, <span>trees</span> and <span>planting</span> of <span>various</span> <span>kinds<br/></span>
🎧 can be used to make <span>city</span> <span>streets</span> actually less <span>dangerous</span> in <span>particular</span> <span>areas</span>.<br/>
🎧 How do <span>trees</span> do all that, you ask?<br/>
🎧 Well, the <span>main</span> <span>difference</span> between a <span>tree</span> and a <span>building<br/></span>
🎧 is a <span>tree</span> has got an <span>internal</span> <span>mechanism</span> to keep the <span>temperature</span> <span>regulated</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>evaporates</span> water through its <span>leaves<br/></span>
🎧 and that <span>means</span> that the <span>temperature</span> of the leaves is never very <span>far</span> from our own <span>body</span> <span>temperature</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>temperature</span> of a <span>building</span> <span>surface</span> on a hot <span>sunny</span> <span>day<br/></span>
🎧 can <span>easily</span> be <span>twenty</span> <span>degrees</span> more than our <span>temperature</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trees</span>, on the other <span>hand</span>, <span>remain</span> <span>cooler</span> than <span>buildings</span> because they <span>sweat</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>means</span> that they can <span>humidify</span> the air and <span>cool</span> it <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 a <span>property</span> which can be <span>exploited</span> to <span>improve</span> the <span>local</span> <span>climate</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trees</span> can also help <span>break</span> the <span>force</span> of <span>winds</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>reason</span> that high <span>buildings</span> make it <span>windier</span> at <span>ground</span> <span>level</span> is that,<br/>
🎧 as the <span>wind</span> <span>goes</span> <span>higher</span> and <span>higher</span>, it <span>goes</span> <span>faster</span> and <span>faster</span>.<br/>
🎧 When the <span>wind</span> <span>hits</span> the <span>building</span>, it has to go somewhere.<br/>
🎧 Some of it <span>goes</span> over the top and some <span>goes</span> around the <span>sides</span> of the <span>building</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>forcing</span> those high <span>level</span> <span>winds</span> down to <span>ground</span> <span>level</span>.<br/>
🎧 That doesn't <span>happen</span> when you have <span>trees</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trees</span> <span>filter</span> the <span>wind</span> and <span>considerably</span> <span>reduce</span> it.<br/>
🎧 <span>preventing</span> those very large <span>strong</span> <span>gusts<br/></span>
🎧 that you so often find around <span>tall</span> <span>buildings</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>problem</span> in <span>built-up</span> <span>areas<br/></span>
🎧 is that <span>traffic</span> <span>noise</span> is <span>intensified</span> by <span>tall</span> <span>buildings</span>.<br/>
🎧 By <span>planting</span> a <span>belt</span> of <span>trees</span> at the side of the <span>road</span>,<br/>
🎧 you can make things a little <span>quieter</span>,<br/>
🎧 but much of the <span>vehicle</span> <span>noise</span> still <span>goes</span> through the <span>trees</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trees</span> can also help <span>reduce</span> the amount of <span>noise</span> in the <span>surroundings</span>,<br/>
🎧 although the <span>effect</span> is not as large as people like to think.<br/>
🎧 <span>Low-</span> <span>frequency</span> <span>noise</span>, in <span>particular</span>, just <span>goes</span> through the <span>trees</span> as though they aren't there.<br/>
🎧 Although <span>trees</span> can <span>significantly</span> <span>improve</span> the <span>local</span> <span>climate</span>,<br/>
🎧 they do <span>however</span> take up a lot of <span>space</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>root</span> <span>systems</span> to <span>consider<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>branches</span> <span>blocking</span> <span>windows</span> and so on.<br/>
🎧 It may <span>therefore</span> be <span>difficult</span> to fit <span>trees</span> into the <span>local</span> <span>landscape</span>.<br/>
🎧 There is not a great <span>deal</span> you can do if you have what we call a <span>street</span> <span>canyon</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 a whole set of <span>high-rises</span> <span>enclosed</span> in a <span>narrow</span> <span>street</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trees</span> need water to <span>grow</span>.<br/>
🎧 They also need some <span>sunlight</span> to <span>grow<br/></span>
🎧 and you need room to put them.<br/>
🎧 If you have the <span>chance</span> of <span>knocking</span> <span>buildings</span> down and <span>replacing</span> them,<br/>
🎧 then <span>suddenly</span> you can start looking at different <span>ways</span> to <span>design</span> the <span>streets</span> and to <span>introduce..</span>.<br/>
