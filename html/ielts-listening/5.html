🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 How can I help you?<br/>
🎧 I understand that the school organises... um, trips to different...<br/>
🎧 Yes, we run five every month:<br/>
🎧 three during weekends and two Wednesday afternoon trips.<br/>
🎧 What sort of places?<br/>
🎧 Well, obviously it varies,<br/>
🎧 but always places of historical interest<br/>
🎧 and also which offer a variety of shopping, because our students always ask about that...<br/>
🎧 and then we go for ones where we know there are guided tours,<br/>
🎧 because this gives a good focus for the visit.<br/>
🎧 Do you travel far?<br/>
🎧 Well, we're lucky here, obviously,<br/>
🎧 because we're able to say that all our visits are less than three hours drive.<br/>
🎧 How much do they cost?<br/>
🎧 Again, it varies,<br/>
🎧 between five and fifteen pounds a head, depending on distance.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and we do offer to arrange special trips if, you know, there are more than twelve people.<br/>
🎧 Oh right, I'll keep that in mind.<br/>
🎧 And what are the times normally?<br/>
🎧 We try to keep it pretty fixed so that, that students get to know the pattern.<br/>
🎧 We leave at 8.30 a.m. and return at 6 p.m.<br/>
🎧 We figure it's best to keep the day fairly short.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes. And, um, how do we reserve a place?<br/>
🎧 You sign your name on the notice board.<br/>
🎧 Do you know where it is?<br/>
🎧 Ah ha. I saw it this morning.<br/>
🎧 And we do ask that you sign up three days in advance<br/>
🎧 so we know we've got enough people interested to run it,<br/>
🎧 and we can cancel if necessary, with full refund of course.<br/>
🎧 That's fine, thanks.<br/>
🎧 And what visits are planned for this term?<br/>
🎧 Right, well, I'm afraid the schedule hasn't been printed out yet,<br/>
🎧 but, uh... we have confirmed the dates and planned the optional extra visits<br/>
🎧 which you can also book in advance if you want to.<br/>
🎧 Oh that's all right.<br/>
🎧 If you can just give some idea of the weekend ones<br/>
🎧 so I can, you know, work out when to see friends, etcetera.<br/>
🎧 Oh sure.<br/>
🎧 Well, the first one is St Ives.<br/>
🎧 That's on the 13th of February<br/>
🎧 and we'll have only sixteen places available 'cos we're going by minibus.<br/>
🎧 And that's a day in town with the optional extra of visiting the Hepworth Museum.<br/>
🎧 Oh right... yeah... that sounds good.<br/>
🎧 Then there's a London trip on the sixteenth of February<br/>
🎧 and we'll be taking a medium-sized coach so there'll be 45 places on that,<br/>
🎧 and, let's see, the optional extra is the Tower of London.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I've already been there.<br/>
🎧 After that there's Bristol on the 3rd of March.<br/>
🎧 Where?<br/>
🎧 Bristol...<br/>
🎧 BRISTOL.<br/>
🎧 Okay...<br/>
🎧 That's in a different minibus with 18 places available,<br/>
🎧 oh, and the optional extra is a visit to the S.S. Great <span>Britain.<br/>
🎧 <span>Okay...<br/>
🎧 We're going to <span>Salisbury on the <span>eighteenth of <span>March<br/>
🎧 and that's always a <span>popular one because the <span>optional <span>extra is <span>Stonehenge,<br/>
🎧 so we're taking the large <span>coach with <span>fifty <span>seats...<br/>
🎧 Oh good.<br/>
🎧 And then the last one is to <span>Bath on the <span>23rd of <span>March.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes. Is <span>Bath the <span>Roman <span>city?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's right,<br/>
🎧 and that's in the <span>sixteen-seater <span>minibus.<br/>
🎧 And where's the <span>optional visit?<br/>
🎧 It's to the <span>American <span>Museum <span>- well <span>worth a visit.<br/>
🎧 Okay, well that's great, thanks for all <span>that...<br/>
🎧 My <span>pleasure.<br/>
🎧 By the way, if you want more <span>information about any of the <span>trips,<br/>
🎧 have a look in the student <span>newspaper.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Or, have a <span>word with my <span>assistant;<br/>
🎧 her name is <span>Jane <span>Yentob <span>-<br/>
🎧 that's <span>YENTOB.<br/>
🎧 Right, I've got that.<br/>
🎧 Thank you very much for all your help.<br/>
🎧 You're very <span>welcome.<br/>
🎧 I hope you enjoy the <span>trips.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Good <span>afternoon <span>everybody<br/>
🎧 and <span>welcome to <span>Riverside <span>Industrial <span>Village.<br/>
🎧 To start your visit, I'm just going to give you a <span>brief <span>account of the <span>history of the <span>museum<br/>
🎧 before <span>letting you <span>roam about on your own.<br/>
🎧 I won't keep you long. Okay?<br/>
🎧 Now, from where we're <span>standing<br/>
🎧 you've got a good <span>view of the <span>river over there.<br/>
🎧 And it was because of this <span>fast-flowing <span>water<br/>
🎧 that this <span>site was a <span>natural place for <span>manufacturing <span>works.<br/>
🎧 The water and the <span>availability of raw <span>materials in the <span>area, like <span>minerals and <span>iron <span>ore,<br/>
🎧 and also the <span>abundance of <span>local <span>fuels, like <span>coal and <span>firewood,<br/>
🎧 all made this <span>site <span>suitable for <span>industry from a very <span>early time.<br/>
🎧 Water was the <span>main <span>source of <span>power for the <span>early <span>industries<br/>
🎧 and some of the water <span>wheels were first <span>established in the <span>12th <span>century, would you <span>believe?<br/>
🎧 At that time, <span>local <span>craftsmen first <span>built an <span>iron <span>forge<br/>
🎧 just behind the <span>village here, on the <span>bend in the <span>river.<br/>
🎧 By the <span>17th and <span>18th <span>centuries,<br/>
🎧 the <span>region's <span>rivers <span>supported more than <span>160 water <span>mills <span>-<br/>
🎧 and many of these <span>continued to <span>operate well into the <span>19th <span>century.<br/>
🎧 But then, the <span>steam <span>engine was <span>invented<br/>
🎧 and then the <span>railways <span>came<br/>
🎧 and the <span>centres of <span>industry were able to move away from the <span>rivers and the <span>countryside and into the <span>towns.<br/>
🎧 So, <span>industrial <span>villages like this one <span>became very <span>rare.<br/>
🎧 So, that's the <span>history for you.<br/>
🎧 If you'd like any more <span>information, you can ask me some <span>questions,<br/>
🎧 or you can read <span>further in our <span>excellent <span>guide book.<br/>
🎧 Now I'm going to give you a plan of the <span>site<br/>
🎧 and I'd just like to <span>point out where everything <span>is<br/>
🎧 and then you can take a look at everything for yourself.<br/>
🎧 I've already <span>pointed out the <span>river, which is on the <span>left.<br/>
🎧 And of course, <span>running along the <span>bottom is <span>Woodside <span>Road,<br/>
🎧 got it?<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Now, we're <span>standing at the <span>entrance,<br/>
🎧 see it at the <span>bottom,<br/>
🎧 and <span>immediately to our right is the <span>Ticket <span>Office.<br/>
🎧 You won't need that because you've got your group <span>booking,<br/>
🎧 but just <span>past it are the <span>toilets <span>-<br/>
🎧 always good to know where they are.<br/>
🎧 In <span>front of us is the car <span>park, as you can see,<br/>
🎧 and to the <span>left, by the <span>entry <span>gate is the <span>Gift <span>Shop.<br/>
🎧 That's where you can get <span>copies of the <span>guide, like this one here.<br/>
🎧 Now, <span>beyond the car <span>park,<br/>
🎧 all the <span>buildings are <span>arranged in a <span>half <span>circle with a <span>yard in the <span>middle.<br/>
🎧 The big, <span>stone <span>building at the top is the <span>main <span>Workshop.<br/>
🎧 That's where the <span>furnace <span>is<br/>
🎧 and where all the <span>metal was <span>smelted and the <span>tools were <span>cast,<br/>
🎧 as you'll be able to see.<br/>
🎧 Now, in the top <span>right-hand <span>corner,<br/>
🎧 that <span>building with <span>bigger <span>windows is the <span>Showroom,<br/>
🎧 where <span>samples of all the <span>tools that were made through the <span>ages are on <span>display.<br/>
🎧 In the top <span>left <span>corner is the <span>Grinding <span>Shop,<br/>
🎧 where the <span>tools were <span>sharpened and <span>finished.<br/>
🎧 And on one side of that you can see the <span>Engine <span>Room<br/>
🎧 and on the other is the <span>Café,<br/>
🎧 which isn't an <span>antique, you'll be <span>pleased to know,<br/>
🎧 though they do <span>serve very nice <span>old-fashioned <span>teas.<br/>
🎧 The row of <span>buildings you can see on the <span>left are the <span>cottages.<br/>
🎧 These were <span>built for the <span>workers <span>towards the end of the <span>18th <span>century<br/>
🎧 and they're still <span>furnished from that <span>period<br/>
🎧 so you can get a good idea of <span>ordinary <span>people's living <span>conditions.<br/>
🎧 Across the <span>yard from them,<br/>
🎧 you can see the <span>stables where the <span>horses were <span>kept for <span>transporting the <span>products.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>separate <span>building in <span>front of them is the <span>Works <span>Office<br/>
🎧 and that still has some of the old <span>accounts on <span>display.<br/>
🎧 Right, if <span>anyone <span>wants a <span>guided <span>tour then I'm <span>starting at the <span>Engine Room.<br/>
🎧 If you'd like to come along, this way please, <span>ladies and <span>gentlemen.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 <span>Excuse me, <span>Dr <span>Johnson.<br/>
🎧 May I speak to you for a <span>minute?<br/>
🎧 Sure. Come in.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>Melanie <span>Griffin.<br/>
🎧 I'm taking your course in <span>Population <span>Studies.<br/>
🎧 Right. Well, <span>Melanie, how can I help you?<br/>
🎧 I'm having a bit of <span>trouble with the second <span>assignment,<br/>
🎧 and it's <span>due in <span>12 <span>days.<br/>
🎧 What <span>sort of <span>trouble are you having?<br/>
🎧 Is the <span>assignment <span>question a <span>problem?<br/>
🎧 Well, that's <span>part of the <span>problem.<br/>
🎧 I'm also having <span>- been having <span>trouble getting <span>hold of the books.<br/>
🎧 I've been to the <span>library <span>several <span>times, and all the books are out.<br/>
🎧 Sounds like you should have <span>started <span>borrowing books a bit <span>earlier.<br/>
🎧 Well, I had a really big <span>assignment <span>due in for another course, <span>and...<br/>
🎧 I've been spending all my time on that, and I <span>thought...<br/>
🎧 You might get an <span>extension of time to <span>finish your <span>assignment for me?<br/>
🎧 If that's <span>possible, but I don't <span>know...<br/>
🎧 Well, yes, it is <span>possible, <span>but...<br/>
🎧 <span>extensions are <span>normally <span>given only for <span>medical or <span>compassionate <span>reasons,<br/>
🎧 <span>otherwise, it's really a <span>question of <span>organising your <span>study,<br/>
🎧 and we don't like <span>giving <span>extensions to students who <span>simply didn't plan their work <span>properly.<br/>
🎧 What did you get for your first <span>assignment?<br/>
🎧 I got <span>87%.<br/>
🎧 Yes, you did very well <span>indeed,<br/>
🎧 so <span>obviously, you can <span>produce good work.<br/>
🎧 I don't think I'll need too much <span>extra time,<br/>
🎧 as long as I can get <span>hold of some of the important <span>references.<br/>
🎧 Well, since you did so well in your first <span>assignment,<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>prepared to give you an <span>extra two <span>weeks for this one,<br/>
🎧 so <span>that'll mean you'll need to <span>submit it about a month from now.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Now, what about the <span>reading <span>materials?<br/>
🎧 Have you <span>checked out the <span>journal <span>articles in the <span>list?<br/>
🎧 <span>Umm, no, not yet,<br/>
🎧 there were about <span>20 of them, <span>and...<br/>
🎧 I wasn't sure which <span>ones would be most useful or important.<br/>
🎧 Well, they're all useful,<br/>
🎧 but I don't <span>expect <span>anyone to read them all, because a number of them <span>deal with the same issues.<br/>
🎧 Let me give you some <span>suggestions.<br/>
🎧 The <span>article by <span>Anderson and <span>Hawker is really <span>worth <span>reading.<br/>
🎧 Right, I'll read that one.<br/>
🎧 You should also read the <span>article by <span>Jackson,<br/>
🎧 but just look at the <span>part on the <span>research <span>methodology <span>- how they did it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Okay...<br/>
🎧 <span>Jackson, got <span>that...<br/>
🎧 And if you have time, the one by <span>Roberts says very <span>relevant things,<br/>
🎧 although it's not <span>essential.<br/>
🎧 Okay, if it's useful, I'll try and read that <span>one...<br/>
🎧 Now, the one by <span>Morris.<br/>
🎧 I wouldn't <span>bother with that at this <span>stage, if I were you.<br/>
🎧 Okay, I won't <span>bother with <span>Morris.<br/>
🎧 Oh, now, <span>someone told me the <span>article by <span>Cooper is important.<br/>
🎧 Well, yes, in a way,<br/>
🎧 but just look at the last <span>part, where he <span>discusses the <span>research <span>results.<br/>
🎧 And <span>lastly, there's <span>Forster <span>-<br/>
🎧 I can't think why I <span>included that one.<br/>
🎧 It's not bad and could be of some help, but not that much.<br/>
🎧 Now, let's <span>deal with the <span>assignment <span>question.<br/>
🎧 What's the <span>problem there?<br/>
🎧 It's the <span>graph on <span>page two.<br/>
🎧 What <span>seems to be the <span>problem? It's just the <span>bar <span>graph <span>showing <span>reasons why people change where they live.<br/>
🎧 Well, I've got a <span>photocopy but the <span>reasons at the <span>bottom are <span>missing.<br/>
🎧 Ah, okay.<br/>
🎧 Look at the first <span>bar on the <span>graph <span>-<br/>
🎧 now that <span>indicates the number of people who move because they want more <span>space.<br/>
🎧 Oh I <span>see...<br/>
🎧 <span>bar <span>one... <span>okay...<br/>
🎧 Now what about the next <span>bar?<br/>
🎧 <span>Bar two is to do with the people living <span>nearby <span>disturbing them,<br/>
🎧 so they <span>chose to move away to somewhere <span>quieter.<br/>
🎧 Now let's look at <span>bar number <span>three...<br/>
🎧 another <span>reason people change their place of <span>living<br/>
🎧 is because they want to be <span>closer to the <span>city.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 <span>Proximity to the <span>city is an <span>issue...<br/>
🎧 Now, <span>bar number <span>four <span>refers to <span>problems when the <span>owner of the <span>property won't help fix things that go wrong.<br/>
🎧 In other <span>words, the <span>owner is not <span>helpful and so the <span>tenants move out.<br/>
🎧 <span>Okay...<br/>
🎧 Now what about <span>bar <span>five?<br/>
🎧 <span>Bar <span>five is about those people who move <span>because...<br/>
🎧 they need a bus or <span>train to get them into the <span>city or to go to work.<br/>
🎧 <span>Okay...<br/>
🎧 And <span>bar six?<br/>
🎧 <span>Bar number six is <span>interesting.<br/>
🎧 That <span>reason was <span>given quite a lot <span>-<br/>
🎧 people <span>moving because they wanted to be in a more <span>attractive <span>neighbourhood.<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes, thank you very much.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Good day, <span>ladies and <span>gentlemen.<br/>
🎧 I have been <span>asked today to talk to you about the <span>urban <span>landscape.<br/>
🎧 There are two <span>major <span>areas that I will focus on in my <span>talk:<br/>
🎧 how <span>vegetation can have a <span>significant <span>effect on <span>urban <span>climate,<br/>
🎧 and how we can better plan our <span>cities <span>using <span>trees<br/>
🎧 to <span>provide a more <span>comfortable <span>environment for us to live in.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trees can have a <span>significant <span>impact on our <span>cities.<br/>
🎧 They can make a <span>city, as a whole, a bit less <span>windy<br/>
🎧 or a bit more <span>windy, if that's what you want.<br/>
🎧 They can make it a bit <span>cooler if it's a hot <span>summer day in an <span>Australian <span>city,<br/>
🎧 or they can make it a bit more <span>humid if it's a dry <span>inland <span>city.<br/>
🎧 On the <span>local <span>scale <span>- that is, in <span>particular <span>areas <span>within the <span>city <span>-<br/>
🎧 <span>trees can make the <span>local <span>area more <span>shady, <span>cooler,<br/>
🎧 more <span>humid and much less <span>windy.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact, <span>trees and <span>planting of <span>various <span>kinds<br/>
🎧 can be used to make <span>city <span>streets actually less <span>dangerous in <span>particular <span>areas.<br/>
🎧 How do <span>trees do all that, you ask?<br/>
🎧 Well, the <span>main <span>difference between a <span>tree and a <span>building<br/>
🎧 is a <span>tree has got an <span>internal <span>mechanism to keep the <span>temperature <span>regulated.<br/>
🎧 It <span>evaporates water through its <span>leaves<br/>
🎧 and that <span>means that the <span>temperature of the leaves is never very <span>far from our own <span>body <span>temperature.<br/>
🎧 The <span>temperature of a <span>building <span>surface on a hot <span>sunny <span>day<br/>
🎧 can <span>easily be <span>twenty <span>degrees more than our <span>temperature.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trees, on the other <span>hand, <span>remain <span>cooler than <span>buildings because they <span>sweat.<br/>
🎧 This <span>means that they can <span>humidify the air and <span>cool it <span>-<br/>
🎧 a <span>property which can be <span>exploited to <span>improve the <span>local <span>climate.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trees can also help <span>break the <span>force of <span>winds.<br/>
🎧 The <span>reason that high <span>buildings make it <span>windier at <span>ground <span>level is that,<br/>
🎧 as the <span>wind <span>goes <span>higher and <span>higher, it <span>goes <span>faster and <span>faster.<br/>
🎧 When the <span>wind <span>hits the <span>building, it has to go somewhere.<br/>
🎧 Some of it <span>goes over the top and some <span>goes around the <span>sides of the <span>building,<br/>
🎧 <span>forcing those high <span>level <span>winds down to <span>ground <span>level.<br/>
🎧 That doesn't <span>happen when you have <span>trees.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trees <span>filter the <span>wind and <span>considerably <span>reduce it.<br/>
🎧 <span>preventing those very large <span>strong <span>gusts<br/>
🎧 that you so often find around <span>tall <span>buildings.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>problem in <span>built-up <span>areas<br/>
🎧 is that <span>traffic <span>noise is <span>intensified by <span>tall <span>buildings.<br/>
🎧 By <span>planting a <span>belt of <span>trees at the side of the <span>road,<br/>
🎧 you can make things a little <span>quieter,<br/>
🎧 but much of the <span>vehicle <span>noise still <span>goes through the <span>trees.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trees can also help <span>reduce the amount of <span>noise in the <span>surroundings,<br/>
🎧 although the <span>effect is not as large as people like to think.<br/>
🎧 <span>Low- <span>frequency <span>noise, in <span>particular, just <span>goes through the <span>trees as though they aren't there.<br/>
🎧 Although <span>trees can <span>significantly <span>improve the <span>local <span>climate,<br/>
🎧 they do <span>however take up a lot of <span>space.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>root <span>systems to <span>consider<br/>
🎧 and <span>branches <span>blocking <span>windows and so on.<br/>
🎧 It may <span>therefore be <span>difficult to fit <span>trees into the <span>local <span>landscape.<br/>
🎧 There is not a great <span>deal you can do if you have what we call a <span>street <span>canyon <span>-<br/>
🎧 a whole set of <span>high-rises <span>enclosed in a <span>narrow <span>street.<br/>
🎧 <span>Trees need water to <span>grow.<br/>
🎧 They also need some <span>sunlight to <span>grow<br/>
🎧 and you need room to put them.<br/>
🎧 If you have the <span>chance of <span>knocking <span>buildings down and <span>replacing them,<br/>
🎧 then <span>suddenly you can start looking at different <span>ways to <span>design the <span>streets and to <span>introduce...<br/>
<br/><br/>
