🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 How can I help you?<br/>
🎧 I understand that the school organises... um, trips to different...<br/>
🎧 Yes, we run five every month:<br/>
🎧 three during weekends and two Wednesday afternoon trips.<br/>
🎧 What sort of places?<br/>
🎧 Well, obviously it varies,<br/>
🎧 but always places of historical interest<br/>
🎧 and also which offer a variety of shopping, because our students always ask about that...<br/>
🎧 and then we go for ones where we know there are guided tours,<br/>
🎧 because this gives a good focus for the visit.<br/>
🎧 Do you travel far?<br/>
🎧 Well, we're lucky here, obviously,<br/>
🎧 because we're able to say that all our visits are less than three hours drive.<br/>
🎧 How much do they cost?<br/>
🎧 Again, it varies,<br/>
🎧 between five and fifteen pounds a head, depending on distance.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and we do offer to arrange special trips if, you know, there are more than twelve people.<br/>
🎧 Oh right, I'll keep that in mind.<br/>
🎧 And what are the times normally?<br/>
🎧 We try to keep it pretty fixed so that, that students get to know the pattern.<br/>
🎧 We leave at 8.30 a.m. and return at 6 p.m.<br/>
🎧 We figure it's best to keep the day fairly short.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes. And, um, how do we reserve a place?<br/>
🎧 You sign your name on the notice board.<br/>
🎧 Do you know where it is?<br/>
🎧 Ah ha. I saw it this morning.<br/>
🎧 And we do ask that you sign up three days in advance<br/>
🎧 so we know we've got enough people interested to run it,<br/>
🎧 and we can cancel if necessary, with full refund of course.<br/>
🎧 That's fine, thanks.<br/>
🎧 And what visits are planned for this term?<br/>
🎧 Right, well, I'm afraid the schedule hasn't been printed out yet,<br/>
🎧 but, uh... we have confirmed the dates and planned the optional extra visits<br/>
🎧 which you can also book in advance if you want to.<br/>
🎧 Oh that's all right.<br/>
🎧 If you can just give some idea of the weekend ones<br/>
🎧 so I can, you know, work out when to see friends, etcetera.<br/>
🎧 Oh sure.<br/>
🎧 Well, the first one is St Ives.<br/>
🎧 That's on the 13th of February<br/>
🎧 and we'll have only sixteen places available 'cos we're going by minibus.<br/>
🎧 And that's a day in town with the optional extra of visiting the Hepworth Museum.<br/>
🎧 Oh right... yeah... that sounds good.<br/>
🎧 Then there's a London trip on the sixteenth of February<br/>
🎧 and we'll be taking a medium-sized coach so there'll be 45 places on that,<br/>
🎧 and, let's see, the optional extra is the Tower of London.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I've already been there.<br/>
🎧 After that there's Bristol on the 3rd of March.<br/>
🎧 Where?<br/>
🎧 Bristol...<br/>
🎧 BRISTOL.<br/>
🎧 Okay...<br/>
🎧 That's in a different minibus with 18 places available,<br/>
🎧 oh, and the optional extra is a visit to the S.S. Great Britain.<br/>
🎧 Okay...<br/>
🎧 We're going to Salisbury on the eighteenth of March<br/>
🎧 and that's always a popular one because the optional extra is Stonehenge,<br/>
🎧 so we're taking the large coach with fifty seats...<br/>
🎧 Oh good.<br/>
🎧 And then the last one is to Bath on the 23rd of March.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes. Is Bath the Roman city?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's right,<br/>
🎧 and that's in the sixteen-seater minibus.<br/>
🎧 And where's the optional visit?<br/>
🎧 It's to the American Museum - well worth a visit.<br/>
🎧 Okay, well that's great, thanks for all that...<br/>
🎧 My pleasure.<br/>
🎧 By the way, if you want more information about any of the trips,<br/>
🎧 have a look in the student newspaper.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Or, have a word with my assistant;<br/>
🎧 her name is Jane Yentob -<br/>
🎧 that's YENTOB.<br/>
🎧 Right, I've got that.<br/>
🎧 Thank you very much for all your help.<br/>
🎧 You're very welcome.<br/>
🎧 I hope you enjoy the trips.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Good afternoon everybody<br/>
🎧 and welcome to Riverside Industrial Village.<br/>
🎧 To start your visit, I'm just going to give you a brief account of the history of the museum<br/>
🎧 before letting you roam about on your own.<br/>
🎧 I won't keep you long. Okay?<br/>
🎧 Now, from where we're standing<br/>
🎧 you've got a good view of the river over there.<br/>
🎧 And it was because of this fast-flowing water<br/>
🎧 that this site was a natural place for manufacturing works.<br/>
🎧 The water and the availability of raw materials in the area, like minerals and iron ore,<br/>
🎧 and also the abundance of local fuels, like coal and firewood,<br/>
🎧 all made this site suitable for industry from a very early time.<br/>
🎧 Water was the main source of power for the early industries<br/>
🎧 and some of the water wheels were first established in the 12th century, would you believe?<br/>
🎧 At that time, local craftsmen first built an iron forge<br/>
🎧 just behind the village here, on the bend in the river.<br/>
🎧 By the 17th and 18th centuries,<br/>
🎧 the region's rivers supported more than 160 water mills -<br/>
🎧 and many of these continued to operate well into the 19th century.<br/>
🎧 But then, the steam engine was invented<br/>
🎧 and then the railways came<br/>
🎧 and the centres of industry were able to move away from the rivers and the countryside and into the towns.<br/>
🎧 So, industrial villages like this one became very rare.<br/>
🎧 So, that's the history for you.<br/>
🎧 If you'd like any more information, you can ask me some questions,<br/>
🎧 or you can read further in our excellent guide book.<br/>
🎧 Now I'm going to give you a plan of the site<br/>
🎧 and I'd just like to point out where everything is<br/>
🎧 and then you can take a look at everything for yourself.<br/>
🎧 I've already pointed out the river, which is on the left.<br/>
🎧 And of course, running along the bottom is Woodside Road,<br/>
🎧 got it?<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Now, we're standing at the entrance,<br/>
🎧 see it at the bottom,<br/>
🎧 and immediately to our right is the Ticket Office.<br/>
🎧 You won't need that because you've got your group booking,<br/>
🎧 but just past it are the toilets -<br/>
🎧 always good to know where they are.<br/>
🎧 In front of us is the car park, as you can see,<br/>
🎧 and to the left, by the entry gate is the Gift Shop.<br/>
🎧 That's where you can get copies of the guide, like this one here.<br/>
🎧 Now, beyond the car park,<br/>
🎧 all the buildings are arranged in a half circle with a yard in the middle.<br/>
🎧 The big, stone building at the top is the main Workshop.<br/>
🎧 That's where the furnace is<br/>
🎧 and where all the metal was smelted and the tools were cast,<br/>
🎧 as you'll be able to see.<br/>
🎧 Now, in the top right-hand corner,<br/>
🎧 that building with bigger windows is the Showroom,<br/>
🎧 where samples of all the tools that were made through the ages are on display.<br/>
🎧 In the top left corner is the Grinding Shop,<br/>
🎧 where the tools were sharpened and finished.<br/>
🎧 And on one side of that you can see the Engine Room<br/>
🎧 and on the other is the Café,<br/>
🎧 which isn't an antique, you'll be pleased to know,<br/>
🎧 though they do serve very nice old-fashioned teas.<br/>
🎧 The row of buildings you can see on the left are the cottages.<br/>
🎧 These were built for the workers towards the end of the 18th century<br/>
🎧 and they're still furnished from that period<br/>
🎧 so you can get a good idea of ordinary people's living conditions.<br/>
🎧 Across the yard from them,<br/>
🎧 you can see the stables where the horses were kept for transporting the products.<br/>
🎧 And the separate building in front of them is the Works Office<br/>
🎧 and that still has some of the old accounts on display.<br/>
🎧 Right, if anyone wants a guided tour then I'm starting at the Engine Room.<br/>
🎧 If you'd like to come along, this way please, ladies and gentlemen.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Excuse me, Dr Johnson.<br/>
🎧 May I speak to you for a minute?<br/>
🎧 Sure. Come in.<br/>
🎧 I'm Melanie Griffin.<br/>
🎧 I'm taking your course in Population Studies.<br/>
🎧 Right. Well, Melanie, how can I help you?<br/>
🎧 I'm having a bit of trouble with the second assignment,<br/>
🎧 and it's due in 12 days.<br/>
🎧 What sort of trouble are you having?<br/>
🎧 Is the assignment question a problem?<br/>
🎧 Well, that's part of the problem.<br/>
🎧 I'm also having - been having trouble getting hold of the books.<br/>
🎧 I've been to the library several times, and all the books are out.<br/>
🎧 Sounds like you should have started borrowing books a bit earlier.<br/>
🎧 Well, I had a really big assignment due in for another course, and...<br/>
🎧 I've been spending all my time on that, and I thought...<br/>
🎧 You might get an extension of time to finish your assignment for me?<br/>
🎧 If that's possible, but I don't know...<br/>
🎧 Well, yes, it is possible, but...<br/>
🎧 extensions are normally given only for medical or compassionate reasons,<br/>
🎧 otherwise, it's really a question of organising your study,<br/>
🎧 and we don't like giving extensions to students who simply didn't plan their work properly.<br/>
🎧 What did you get for your first assignment?<br/>
🎧 I got 87%.<br/>
🎧 Yes, you did very well indeed,<br/>
🎧 so obviously, you can produce good work.<br/>
🎧 I don't think I'll need too much extra time,<br/>
🎧 as long as I can get hold of some of the important references.<br/>
🎧 Well, since you did so well in your first assignment,<br/>
🎧 I'm prepared to give you an extra two weeks for this one,<br/>
🎧 so that'll mean you'll need to submit it about a month from now.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Now, what about the reading materials?<br/>
🎧 Have you checked out the journal articles in the list?<br/>
🎧 Umm, no, not yet,<br/>
🎧 there were about 20 of them, and...<br/>
🎧 I wasn't sure which ones would be most useful or important.<br/>
🎧 Well, they're all useful,<br/>
🎧 but I don't expect anyone to read them all, because a number of them deal with the same issues.<br/>
🎧 Let me give you some suggestions.<br/>
🎧 The article by Anderson and Hawker is really worth reading.<br/>
🎧 Right, I'll read that one.<br/>
🎧 You should also read the article by Jackson,<br/>
🎧 but just look at the part on the research methodology - how they did it.<br/>
🎧 Okay...<br/>
🎧 Jackson, got that...<br/>
🎧 And if you have time, the one by Roberts says very relevant things,<br/>
🎧 although it's not essential.<br/>
🎧 Okay, if it's useful, I'll try and read that one...<br/>
🎧 Now, the one by Morris.<br/>
🎧 I wouldn't bother with that at this stage, if I were you.<br/>
🎧 Okay, I won't bother with Morris.<br/>
🎧 Oh, now, someone told me the article by Cooper is important.<br/>
🎧 Well, yes, in a way,<br/>
🎧 but just look at the last part, where he discusses the research results.<br/>
🎧 And lastly, there's Forster -<br/>
🎧 I can't think why I included that one.<br/>
🎧 It's not bad and could be of some help, but not that much.<br/>
🎧 Now, let's deal with the assignment question.<br/>
🎧 What's the problem there?<br/>
🎧 It's the graph on page two.<br/>
🎧 What seems to be the problem? It's just the bar graph showing reasons why people change where they live.<br/>
🎧 Well, I've got a photocopy but the reasons at the bottom are missing.<br/>
🎧 Ah, okay.<br/>
🎧 Look at the first bar on the graph -<br/>
🎧 now that indicates the number of people who move because they want more space.<br/>
🎧 Oh I see...<br/>
🎧 bar one... okay...<br/>
🎧 Now what about the next bar?<br/>
🎧 Bar two is to do with the people living nearby disturbing them,<br/>
🎧 so they chose to move away to somewhere quieter.<br/>
🎧 Now let's look at bar number three...<br/>
🎧 another reason people change their place of living<br/>
🎧 is because they want to be closer to the city.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Proximity to the city is an issue...<br/>
🎧 Now, bar number four refers to problems when the owner of the property won't help fix things that go wrong.<br/>
🎧 In other words, the owner is not helpful and so the tenants move out.<br/>
🎧 Okay...<br/>
🎧 Now what about bar five?<br/>
🎧 Bar five is about those people who move because...<br/>
🎧 they need a bus or train to get them into the city or to go to work.<br/>
🎧 Okay...<br/>
🎧 And bar six?<br/>
🎧 Bar number six is interesting.<br/>
🎧 That reason was given quite a lot -<br/>
🎧 people moving because they wanted to be in a more attractive neighbourhood.<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes, thank you very much.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Good day, ladies and gentlemen.<br/>
🎧 I have been asked today to talk to you about the urban landscape.<br/>
🎧 There are two major areas that I will focus on in my talk:<br/>
🎧 how vegetation can have a significant effect on urban climate,<br/>
🎧 and how we can better plan our cities using trees<br/>
🎧 to provide a more comfortable environment for us to live in.<br/>
🎧 Trees can have a significant impact on our cities.<br/>
🎧 They can make a city, as a whole, a bit less windy<br/>
🎧 or a bit more windy, if that's what you want.<br/>
🎧 They can make it a bit cooler if it's a hot summer day in an Australian city,<br/>
🎧 or they can make it a bit more humid if it's a dry inland city.<br/>
🎧 On the local scale - that is, in particular areas within the city -<br/>
🎧 trees can make the local area more shady, cooler,<br/>
🎧 more humid and much less windy.<br/>
🎧 In fact, trees and planting of various kinds<br/>
🎧 can be used to make city streets actually less dangerous in particular areas.<br/>
🎧 How do trees do all that, you ask?<br/>
🎧 Well, the main difference between a tree and a building<br/>
🎧 is a tree has got an internal mechanism to keep the temperature regulated.<br/>
🎧 It evaporates water through its leaves<br/>
🎧 and that means that the temperature of the leaves is never very far from our own body temperature.<br/>
🎧 The temperature of a building surface on a hot sunny day<br/>
🎧 can easily be twenty degrees more than our temperature.<br/>
🎧 Trees, on the other hand, remain cooler than buildings because they sweat.<br/>
🎧 This means that they can humidify the air and cool it -<br/>
🎧 a property which can be exploited to improve the local climate.<br/>
🎧 Trees can also help break the force of winds.<br/>
🎧 The reason that high buildings make it windier at ground level is that,<br/>
🎧 as the wind goes higher and higher, it goes faster and faster.<br/>
🎧 When the wind hits the building, it has to go somewhere.<br/>
🎧 Some of it goes over the top and some goes around the sides of the building,<br/>
🎧 forcing those high level winds down to ground level.<br/>
🎧 That doesn't happen when you have trees.<br/>
🎧 Trees filter the wind and considerably reduce it.<br/>
🎧 preventing those very large strong gusts<br/>
🎧 that you so often find around tall buildings.<br/>
🎧 Another problem in built-up areas<br/>
🎧 is that traffic noise is intensified by tall buildings.<br/>
🎧 By planting a belt of trees at the side of the road,<br/>
🎧 you can make things a little quieter,<br/>
🎧 but much of the vehicle noise still goes through the trees.<br/>
🎧 Trees can also help reduce the amount of noise in the surroundings,<br/>
🎧 although the effect is not as large as people like to think.<br/>
🎧 Low- frequency noise, in particular, just goes through the trees as though they aren't there.<br/>
🎧 Although trees can significantly improve the local climate,<br/>
🎧 they do however take up a lot of space.<br/>
🎧 There are root systems to consider<br/>
🎧 and branches blocking windows and so on.<br/>
🎧 It may therefore be difficult to fit trees into the local landscape.<br/>
🎧 There is not a great deal you can do if you have what we call a street canyon -<br/>
🎧 a whole set of high-rises enclosed in a narrow street.<br/>
🎧 Trees need water to grow.<br/>
🎧 They also need some sunlight to grow<br/>
🎧 and you need room to put them.<br/>
🎧 If you have the chance of knocking buildings down and replacing them,<br/>
🎧 then suddenly you can start looking at different ways to design the streets and to introduce...<br/>
<br/><br/>
