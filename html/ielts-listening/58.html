🎧 Hello, Jane</span> Fairbanks</span> speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, good morning.<br/>
🎧 My name's</span> Frank</span> Pritchard</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've just retired</span> and moved</span> to Southoe</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to become a volunteer</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I gather</span> you co-ordinate</span> voluntary</span> work in the village</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 What sort</span> of thing could I do?<br/>
🎧 Well, we need help with the village</span> library</span>.<br/>
🎧 We borrow</span> books from the town</span> library</span>,<br/>
🎧 and individuals</span> also donate</span> them.<br/>
🎧 So, one thing you could do is get involved</span> in collecting</span> them,<br/>
🎧 if you've got a car, that is.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's no problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 The times</span> are pretty</span> flexible</span> so we can arrange</span> it to suit</span> you.<br/>
🎧 Oh, another thing is the records</span> that we keep of the books we're given</span>,<br/>
🎧 and those we borrow</span> and need to return</span> to the town</span> library</span>.<br/>
🎧 It would be very useful</span> to have another person to help keep them up to date.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I'm used to working on a computer</span>.<br/>
🎧 I presume</span> they're computerised</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes.<br/>
🎧 Is the library</span> purpose-built</span>?<br/>
🎧 I haven't noticed</span> it when I've walked</span> round</span> the village</span>.<br/>
🎧 No, we simply</span> have the use of a room in the village</span> hall</span>,<br/>
🎧 the West</span> Room.<br/>
🎧 It's on the left</span> as you go in.<br/>
🎧 I must go and have a look inside the hall</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's a nice building</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you run a lunch club</span> in the village</span> for elderly</span> people?<br/>
🎧 I know a lot of places</span> do.<br/>
🎧 Yes, we have a very successful</span> club</span>.<br/>
🎧 I could help with transport</span>, if that's of any use.<br/>
🎧 Oh definitely!<br/>
🎧 People come to the club</span> from neighbouring</span> villages</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we're always in need of more drivers</span>.<br/>
🎧 And does the club</span> have groups</span> that focus on a particular</span> hobby, too?<br/>
🎧 I could get involved</span> in one or two,<br/>
🎧 particularly</span> if there are any art</span> groups</span>.<br/>
🎧 Excellent</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll find out where we need help and get back to you.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 What about help for individual</span> residents</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you arrange</span> that at all?<br/>
🎧 Yes, we do it as a one-off</span>.<br/>
🎧 In fact</span>, there's Mrs</span> Carroll</span>.<br/>
🎧 She needs a lift</span> to the hospital</span> next week,<br/>
🎧 and we're struggling</span> to find someone</span>.<br/>
🎧 When's her appointment</span>?<br/>
🎧 On Tuesday</span>. It would take the whole morning.<br/>
🎧 I could do that.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that would be great. Thank you.<br/>
🎧 And also, next week,<br/>
🎧 we're arranging</span> to have some work done to Mr Selsbury's</span> house before he moves</span>,<br/>
🎧 as he isn't healthy</span> enough to do it himself</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've got some people to decorate</span> his kitchen</span>,<br/>
🎧 but if you could do some weeding</span> in his garden,<br/>
🎧 that would be wonderful.<br/>
🎧 OK. I'd enjoy that.<br/>
🎧 And presumably</span> the day and time are flexible</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes. Just say when would suit</span> you best, and we'll let Mr Selsbury</span> know.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 The volunteers</span> group also organises</span> monthly</span> social</span> events</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is a great way to meet other people, of course.<br/>
🎧 So next month, on the 19th</span> of October</span>,<br/>
🎧 we're holding</span> a quiz</span>,<br/>
🎧 a couple</span> of residents</span> are great at planning unusual</span> ones</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we always fill</span> the village</span> hall</span>.<br/>
🎧 That sounds like fun.<br/>
🎧 Can I do anything to help?<br/>
🎧 Well, because of the number of people,<br/>
🎧 we need plenty</span> of refreshments</span> for halfway</span> through.<br/>
🎧 So, if you could provide</span> any, we'd be grateful</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure I could.<br/>
🎧 I'll think about what to make, and let you know.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Then on November</span> the 18th</span>,<br/>
🎧 we're holding</span> a dance</span>, also in the village</span> hall</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've booked</span> a band</span> that specialises</span> in music of the 1930s</span>,<br/>
🎧 they've</span> been before, and we've had a lot of requests</span> to bring</span> them back.<br/>
🎧 I'm not really a dancer</span>, but I'd like to do something to help.<br/>
🎧 Well, we sell tickets</span> in advance</span>,<br/>
🎧 and having an extra</span> person to check them at the door</span>, as people arrive</span>, would be good,<br/>
🎧 it can be quite a bottleneck</span> if everyone arrives</span> at once!<br/>
🎧 OK, I'm happy with that.<br/>
🎧 Oh, we're also arranging</span> a New Year's</span> Eve</span> party</span>.<br/>
🎧 We're expecting</span> that to be a really big event</span>,<br/>
🎧 so instead</span> of the village</span> hall</span>, it'll be held</span> in the Mountfort</span> Hotel</span>.<br/>
🎧 The...</span>?<br/>
🎧 Mountfort</span>.<br/>
🎧 Mountfort</span> Hotel</span>.<br/>
🎧 It isn't in Southoe</span> itself</span>, but it's only a couple</span> of miles</span> away.<br/>
🎧 The hotel</span> will be providing</span> dinner and we've booked</span> a band</span>.<br/>
🎧 The one thing we haven't got yet is a poster</span>.<br/>
🎧 That isn't something you could do, by any chance</span>, is it?<br/>
🎧 Well actually, yes.<br/>
🎧 Before I retired</span> I was a graphic</span> designer</span>, so that's right up my street</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh perfect!<br/>
🎧 I'll give you the details</span>,<br/>
🎧 and then perhaps</span> you could send</span> me a draft..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>

🎧 Good morning, and welcome</span> to Oniton</span> Hall</span>,<br/>
🎧 one of the largest</span> estates</span> in the area</span>.<br/>
🎧 My name's</span> Nick</span>, and I'm one of the guides</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll give you a brief</span> introduction</span> to the estate</span> while you're sitting</span> down,<br/>
🎧 and then we'll walk</span> round</span>.<br/>
🎧 The estate</span> consists</span> of the house, gardens</span>, parkland</span> and farm</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it dates</span> back to the fourteenth</span> century</span>.<br/>
🎧 The original</span> house was replaced</span> in the late</span> seventeenth</span> century</span>,<br/>
🎧 and of course it has had a large number of owners</span>.<br/>
🎧 Almost all of them have left</span> their mark</span>,<br/>
🎧 generally</span> by adding</span> new rooms</span>, like the ballroom</span> and conservatory</span>,<br/>
🎧 or by demolishing</span> others</span>.<br/>
🎧 The farm</span> looks much as it's always done,<br/>
🎧 although the current</span> owner</span> has done a great deal</span> of work to the flower</span> beds</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the seventeenth</span> century</span>, the estate</span> was owned</span> by a very wealthy</span> man called Sir Edward</span> Downes</span>.<br/>
🎧 His intention</span> was to escape</span> from the world</span> of politics</span>,<br/>
🎧 after years as an active</span> politician</span>,<br/>
🎧 and to build</span> a new house worthy</span> of his big collection</span> of books, paintings</span> and sculptures</span>.<br/>
🎧 He broke</span> off contact</span> with his former</span> political</span> allies</span>,<br/>
🎧 and hosted</span> meetings</span> of creative</span> and literary</span> people, like painters</span> and poets</span>.<br/>
🎧 Unusually</span> for his time, he didn't care</span> whether</span> his guests</span> were rich</span> or poor</span>,<br/>
🎧 as long as they had talent</span>.<br/>
🎧 Big houses</span> like Oniton</span> had dozens</span> of servants</span> until the 1920s</span> or 30s</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we've tried</span> to show what their working lives were like.<br/>
🎧 Photographs</span> of course don't give much of an idea,<br/>
🎧 so instead</span>, as you go round</span> the house,<br/>
🎧 you'll see volunteers</span> dressed</span> up as nineteenth-century</span> servants</span>, going about their work.<br/>
🎧 They'll explain</span> what they're doing,<br/>
🎧 and tell you their recipes</span>, or what tools</span> they're using</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've just introduced</span> this feature</span> to replace</span> the audio</span> guide</span> we used to have available</span>.<br/>
🎧 I see there are a number of children here with you today.<br/>
🎧 Well, we have several</span> activities</span> specially</span> for children,<br/>
🎧 like dressing</span> up in the sorts</span> of clothes</span> that children wore</span> in the past</span>,<br/>
🎧 and as it's a fine day, some of you will probably want to play in the adventure</span> playground</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our latest</span> addition</span> is child-sized</span> tractors</span>, that you can drive around the grounds</span>.<br/>
🎧 We'll also be going into the farm</span> that's part</span> of the estate</span>, where there's plenty</span> to do.<br/>
🎧 Most of the buildings</span> date from the eighteenth</span> century</span>,<br/>
🎧 so you can really step</span> back into an agricultural</span> past</span>.<br/>
🎧 Until recently</span>, the dairy</span> was where milk</span> from the cows</span> was turned</span> into cheese</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's now the place to go for lunch, or afternoon</span> tea,<br/>
🎧 or just a cup of coffee</span> and a slice</span> of homemade</span> cake</span>.<br/>
🎧 The big stone</span> building</span> that dominates</span> the farm</span> is the large barn</span>,<br/>
🎧 and in here is our collection</span> of agricultural</span> tools</span>.<br/>
🎧 These were used in the past</span> to plough</span> the earth</span>, sow</span> seeds</span>, make gates</span>, and much more.<br/>
🎧 There's a small barn</span>, also made of stone</span>,<br/>
🎧 where you can groom</span> the donkeys</span> and horses</span>, to keep their coats</span> clean</span>.<br/>
🎧 They really seem</span> to enjoy having it done,<br/>
🎧 and children love grooming</span> them.<br/>
🎧 The horses</span> no longer</span> live in the stables</span>,<br/>
🎧 which instead</span> is the place to go to buy gifts</span>, books,<br/>
🎧 our own jams</span> and pickles</span>, and clothes</span> and blankets</span> made of wool</span> from our sheep</span>.<br/>
🎧 Outside the shed</span>, which is the only brick</span> building</span>,<br/>
🎧 you can climb</span> into a horse-drawn</span> carriage</span> for a lovely</span>, relaxing</span> tour</span> of the park</span> and farm</span>.<br/>
🎧 The carriages</span> are well over a hundred</span> years old.<br/>
🎧 And finally, the parkland</span>, which was laid</span> out in the eighteenth</span> century</span>,<br/>
🎧 with a lake</span> and trees</span> that are now well established</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll see types</span> of cattle</span> and sheep</span> that are hardly</span> ever found</span> on farms</span> these days</span>.<br/>
🎧 We're helping</span> to preserve</span> them, to stop</span> their numbers</span> falling</span> further</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, well, if you'd like to come with me, we will start..</span>.<br/>

🎧 Did you make notes</span> while you were watching the performances</span> of Romeo</span> and Juliet</span>, Gemma</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I did. I found</span> it quite hard</span> though.<br/>
🎧 I kept</span> getting too involved</span> in the play.<br/>
🎧 Me too.<br/>
🎧 I ended</span> up not taking notes</span>.<br/>
🎧 I wrote</span> down my impressions</span> when I got home.<br/>
🎧 Do you mind</span> if I check a few things with you?<br/>
🎧 In case I've missed</span> anything.<br/>
🎧 And I've also got some questions</span> about our assignment</span>.<br/>
🎧 No, it's good to talk things through.<br/>
🎧 I may have missed</span> things too.<br/>
🎧 OK great.<br/>
🎧 So first of all,<br/>
🎧 I'm not sure how much information</span> we should include</span> in our reviews</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right. Well, I don't think we need to describe</span> what happens</span>.<br/>
🎧 Especially</span> as Romeo</span> and Juliet</span> is one of Shakespeare's</span> most well-known</span> plays</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, everyone knows</span> the story</span>.<br/>
🎧 In an essay</span> we'd focus on the poetry</span> and Shakespeare's</span> use of imagery</span> etc.</span>,<br/>
🎧 but that isn't really relevant</span> in a review</span>.<br/>
🎧 We're supposed</span> to focus on how effective</span> this particular</span> production</span> is.<br/>
🎧 We should say what made it a success or a failure</span>.<br/>
🎧 And part</span> of that means</span> talking about the emotional</span> impact</span> the performance</span> had on us.<br/>
🎧 I think that's important.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 And we should definitely mention</span> how well the director</span> handled</span> important bits</span> of the play -<br/></span>
🎧 like when Romeo</span> climbs</span> onto</span> Juliet's</span> balcony</span>.<br/>
🎧 And the fight</span> between Mercutio</span> and Tybalt</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 It would also be interesting</span> to mention</span> the theatre</span> space<br/></span>
🎧 and how the director</span> used it<br/></span>
🎧 but I don't think we'll have space</span> in 800</span> words</span>.<br/>
🎧 No. OK.<br/>
🎧 That all sounds quite straightforward</span>.<br/>
🎧 So what about The Emporium</span> Theatre's</span> production</span> of the play?<br/>
🎧 I thought some things worked</span> really well but there were some problems</span> too.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. What about the set, for example?<br/>
🎧 I think it was visually</span> really stunning</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd say that was probably the most memorable</span> thing about this production</span>.<br/>
🎧 You're right. The set design</span> was really amazing,<br/>
🎧 but actually I have seen</span> similar</span> ideas</span> used in other productions</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about the lighting</span>?<br/>
🎧 Some of the scenes</span> were so dimly</span> lit</span> it was quite hard</span> to see.<br/>
🎧 I didn't dislike</span> it.<br/>
🎧 It helped</span> to change the mood</span> of the quieter</span> scenes</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's a good point</span>.<br/>
🎧 What did you think of the costumes</span>?<br/>
🎧 I was a bit surprised</span> by the contemporary</span> dress</span>, I must say.<br/>
🎧 Yeah -</span> I think it worked</span> well, but I had assumed</span> it would be more conventional</span>.<br/>
🎧 Me too.<br/>
🎧 I liked</span> the music at the beginning</span> and I thought the musicians</span> were brilliant</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I thought they were wasted</span> because the music didn't have much impact</span> in Acts</span> 2</span> and 3</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes -</span> that was a shame</span>.<br/>
🎧 One problem</span> with this production</span> was that the actors</span> didn't deliver</span> the lines</span> that well.<br/>
🎧 They were speaking</span> too fast</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was a problem</span> I agree,<br/>
🎧 but I thought it was because they weren't speaking</span> loudly</span> enough,<br/>
🎧 especially</span> at key points</span> in the play.<br/>
🎧 I actually didn't have a problem</span> with that.<br/>
🎧 It's been an interesting</span> experience</span> watching different versions</span> of Romeo</span> and Juliet</span>, hasn't it?<br/>
🎧 Definitely.<br/>
🎧 It's made me realise</span> how relevant</span> the play still is.<br/>
🎧 Right. I mean a lot's</span> changed</span> since Shakespeare's</span> time,<br/>
🎧 but in many ways</span> nothing's</span> changed</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are always disagreements</span> and tension</span> between teenagers</span> and their parents</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's something all young people can relate</span> to -<br/></span>
🎧 more than the violence</span> and the extreme</span> emotions</span> in the play.<br/>
🎧 How did you find watching it in translation</span>?<br/>
🎧 Really interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 I expected</span> to find it more challenging</span>, but I could follow</span> the story</span> pretty</span> well.<br/>
🎧 I stopped</span> worrying</span> about not being able to understand</span> all the words</span> and focused</span> on the actors'</span> expressions</span>.<br/>
🎧 The ending</span> was pretty</span> powerful</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes. That somehow</span> intensified</span> the emotion</span> for me.<br/>
🎧 Did you know Shakespeare's</span> been translated</span> into more languages</span> than any other writer</span>?<br/>
🎧 What's the reason</span> for his international</span> appeal</span>, do you think?<br/>
🎧 I was reading</span> that it's because his plays</span> are about basic</span> themes</span> that people everywhere</span> are familiar</span> with.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, and they can also be understood</span> on different levels</span>.<br/>
🎧 The characters</span> have such depth</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right -</span> which allows</span> directors</span> to experiment</span> and find new angles</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's really important..</span>.<br/>

🎧 Right, everyone, let's make a start.<br/>
🎧 Over the past</span> few sessions</span>,<br/>
🎧 we've been considering</span> the reasons</span> why some world</span> languages</span> are in decline</span>,<br/>
🎧 and today I'm going to introduce</span> another factor</span> that affects</span> languages</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the speakers</span> of those languages</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that's technology</span>, and, in particular</span>, digital</span> technology</span>.<br/>
🎧 In order to illustrate</span> its effect</span>,<br/>
🎧 I'm going to focus on the Icelandic</span> language</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is spoken</span> by around 321,000</span> people,<br/>
🎧 most of whom live in Iceland</span> -</span> an island</span> in the North</span> Atlantic</span> Ocean</span>.<br/>
🎧 The problem</span> for this language</span> is not the number of speakers</span>,<br/>
🎧 even though this number is small.<br/>
🎧 Nor</span> is it about losing</span> words</span> to other languages</span>, such as English.<br/>
🎧 In fact</span>, the vocabulary</span> of Icelandic</span> is continually</span> increasing<br/></span>
🎧 because when speakers</span> need a new word</span> for something,<br/>
🎧 they tend</span> to create</span> one, rather than borrowing</span> from another language</span>.<br/>
🎧 All this makes Icelandic</span> quite a special language</span>,<br/>
🎧 it's changed</span> very little in the past</span> millennium</span>,<br/>
🎧 yet it can handle</span> twenty-first-century</span> concepts</span> related</span> to the use of computers</span> and digital</span> technology</span>.<br/>
🎧 Take, for example, the word</span> for web browser..</span>.<br/>
🎧 this is vafri</span> in Icelandic</span>,<br/>
🎧 which comes from the verb</span> 'to</span> wander'</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can't think of a more appropriate</span> term</span> because that's exactly what you do mentally</span> when you browse</span> the internet</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then there's an Icelandic</span> word</span> for podcast</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is too hard</span> to pronounce</span>!<br/>
🎧 And so on.<br/>
🎧 Icelandic</span>, then, is alive</span> and growing</span>, but -</span> and it's a big but,<br/>
🎧 young Icelanders</span> spend</span> a great deal</span> of time in the digital</span> world<br/></span>
🎧 and this world</span> is predominantly</span> English.<br/>
🎧 Think about smartphones</span>.<br/>
🎧 They didn't even exist</span> until comparatively</span> recently</span>,<br/>
🎧 but today young people use them all the time to read books, watch</span> TV</span> or films</span>,<br/>
🎧 play games</span>, listen to music, and so on.<br/>
🎧 Obviously</span>, this is a good thing in many respects</span> because it promotes</span> their bilingual</span> skills</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the extent</span> of the influence</span> of English in the virtual</span> world</span> is staggering<br/></span>
🎧 and it's all happening</span> really fast</span>.<br/>
🎧 For their parents</span> and grandparents</span>,<br/>
🎧 the change is less concerning</span> because they already have their native-speaker</span> skills</span> in Icelandic</span>.<br/>
🎧 But for young speakers</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 well, the outcome</span> is a little troubling</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, teachers</span> have found</span> that playground</span> conversations</span> in Icelandic</span> secondary</span> schools<br/></span>
🎧 can be conducted</span> entirely</span> in English,<br/>
🎧 while teachers</span> of much younger</span> children have reported</span> situations<br/></span>
🎧 where their classes</span> find it easier</span> to say what is in a picture</span> using</span> English, rather than Icelandic</span>.<br/>
🎧 The very real</span> and worrying</span> consequence</span> of all this<br/></span>
🎧 is that the young generation</span> in Iceland</span> is at risk</span> of losing</span> its mother</span> tongue</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course, this is happening</span> to other European</span> languages</span> too,<br/>
🎧 but while internet</span> companies</span> might be willing</span> to offer</span>, say, French</span> options in their systems</span>,<br/>
🎧 it's much harder</span> for them to justify</span> the expense</span> of doing the same for a language<br/></span>
🎧 that has a population</span> the size of a French</span> town</span>, such as Nice.<br/>
🎧 The other drawback</span> of Icelandic</span> is the grammar</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is significantly</span> more complex</span> than in most languages</span>.<br/>
🎧 At the moment</span>, the tech</span> giants</span> are simply</span> not interested in tackling</span> this.<br/>
🎧 So, what is the Icelandic</span> government</span> doing about this?<br/>
🎧 Well, large sums</span> of money are being allocated</span> to a language</span> technology</span> fund<br/></span>
🎧 that it is hoped</span> will lead</span> to the development</span> of Icelandic</span> sourced</span> apps<br/></span>
🎧 and other social</span> media</span> and digital</span> systems</span>,<br/>
🎧 but clearly</span> this is going to be an uphill</span> struggle</span>.<br/>
🎧 On the positive</span> side,<br/>
🎧 they know that Icelandic</span> is still the official</span> language</span> of education</span> and government</span>.<br/>
🎧 It has survived</span> for well over a thousand</span> years<br/></span>
🎧 and the experts</span> predict</span> that its future in this nation</span> state</span> is sound and will continue</span> to be so.<br/>
🎧 However</span>, there's no doubt</span> that it's becoming</span> an inevitable</span> second choice</span> in young people's</span> lives.<br/>
🎧 This raises</span> important questions</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you consider</span> how much of the past</span> is tied</span> up in a language</span>,<br/>
🎧 will young Icelanders</span> lose</span> their sense</span> of their own identity</span>?<br/>
🎧 Another issue that concerns</span> the government</span> of Iceland</span> is this.<br/>
🎧 If children are learning</span> two languages</span> through different routes</span>,<br/>
🎧 neither</span> of which they are fully</span> fluent</span> in,<br/>
🎧 will they be able to express</span> themselves</span> properly</span>?<br/>
