🎧 Hello, <span>Jane</span> <span>Fairbanks</span> <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, good morning.<br/>
🎧 My <span>name's</span> <span>Frank</span> <span>Pritchard</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've just <span>retired</span> and <span>moved</span> to <span>Southoe</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to become a <span>volunteer</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I <span>gather</span> you <span>co-ordinate</span> <span>voluntary</span> work in the <span>village</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 What <span>sort</span> of thing could I do?<br/>
🎧 Well, we need help with the <span>village</span> <span>library</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>borrow</span> books from the <span>town</span> <span>library</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>individuals</span> also <span>donate</span> them.<br/>
🎧 So, one thing you could do is get <span>involved</span> in <span>collecting</span> them,<br/>
🎧 if you've got a car, that is.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's no <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>times</span> are <span>pretty</span> <span>flexible</span> so we can <span>arrange</span> it to <span>suit</span> you.<br/>
🎧 Oh, another thing is the <span>records</span> that we keep of the books we're <span>given</span>,<br/>
🎧 and those we <span>borrow</span> and need to <span>return</span> to the <span>town</span> <span>library</span>.<br/>
🎧 It would be very <span>useful</span> to have another person to help keep them up to date.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I'm used to working on a <span>computer</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>presume</span> they're <span>computerised</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes.<br/>
🎧 Is the <span>library</span> <span>purpose-built</span>?<br/>
🎧 I haven't <span>noticed</span> it when I've <span>walked</span> <span>round</span> the <span>village</span>.<br/>
🎧 No, we <span>simply</span> have the use of a room in the <span>village</span> <span>hall</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>West</span> Room.<br/>
🎧 It's on the <span>left</span> as you go in.<br/>
🎧 I must go and have a look inside the <span>hall</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's a nice <span>building</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you run a lunch <span>club</span> in the <span>village</span> for <span>elderly</span> people?<br/>
🎧 I know a lot of <span>places</span> do.<br/>
🎧 Yes, we have a very <span>successful</span> <span>club</span>.<br/>
🎧 I could help with <span>transport</span>, if that's of any use.<br/>
🎧 Oh definitely!<br/>
🎧 People come to the <span>club</span> from <span>neighbouring</span> <span>villages</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we're always in need of more <span>drivers</span>.<br/>
🎧 And does the <span>club</span> have <span>groups</span> that focus on a <span>particular</span> hobby, too?<br/>
🎧 I could get <span>involved</span> in one or two,<br/>
🎧 <span>particularly</span> if there are any <span>art</span> <span>groups</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Excellent</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll find out where we need help and get back to you.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 What about help for <span>individual</span> <span>residents</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you <span>arrange</span> that at all?<br/>
🎧 Yes, we do it as a <span>one-off</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, there's <span>Mrs</span> <span>Carroll</span>.<br/>
🎧 She needs a <span>lift</span> to the <span>hospital</span> next week,<br/>
🎧 and we're <span>struggling</span> to find <span>someone</span>.<br/>
🎧 When's her <span>appointment</span>?<br/>
🎧 On <span>Tuesday</span>. It would take the whole morning.<br/>
🎧 I could do that.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that would be great. Thank you.<br/>
🎧 And also, next week,<br/>
🎧 we're <span>arranging</span> to have some work done to Mr <span>Selsbury's</span> house before he <span>moves</span>,<br/>
🎧 as he isn't <span>healthy</span> enough to do it <span>himself</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've got some people to <span>decorate</span> his <span>kitchen</span>,<br/>
🎧 but if you could do some <span>weeding</span> in his garden,<br/>
🎧 that would be wonderful.<br/>
🎧 OK. I'd enjoy that.<br/>
🎧 And <span>presumably</span> the day and time are <span>flexible</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes. Just say when would <span>suit</span> you best, and we'll let Mr <span>Selsbury</span> know.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 The <span>volunteers</span> group also <span>organises</span> <span>monthly</span> <span>social</span> <span>events</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is a great way to meet other people, of course.<br/>
🎧 So next month, on the <span>19th</span> of <span>October</span>,<br/>
🎧 we're <span>holding</span> a <span>quiz</span>,<br/>
🎧 a <span>couple</span> of <span>residents</span> are great at planning <span>unusual</span> <span>ones</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we always <span>fill</span> the <span>village</span> <span>hall</span>.<br/>
🎧 That sounds like fun.<br/>
🎧 Can I do anything to help?<br/>
🎧 Well, because of the number of people,<br/>
🎧 we need <span>plenty</span> of <span>refreshments</span> for <span>halfway</span> through.<br/>
🎧 So, if you could <span>provide</span> any, we'd be <span>grateful</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure I could.<br/>
🎧 I'll think about what to make, and let you know.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Then on <span>November</span> the <span>18th</span>,<br/>
🎧 we're <span>holding</span> a <span>dance</span>, also in the <span>village</span> <span>hall</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've <span>booked</span> a <span>band</span> that <span>specialises</span> in music of the <span>1930s</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>they've</span> been before, and we've had a lot of <span>requests</span> to <span>bring</span> them back.<br/>
🎧 I'm not really a <span>dancer</span>, but I'd like to do something to help.<br/>
🎧 Well, we sell <span>tickets</span> in <span>advance</span>,<br/>
🎧 and having an <span>extra</span> person to check them at the <span>door</span>, as people <span>arrive</span>, would be good,<br/>
🎧 it can be quite a <span>bottleneck</span> if everyone <span>arrives</span> at once!<br/>
🎧 OK, I'm happy with that.<br/>
🎧 Oh, we're also <span>arranging</span> a New <span>Year's</span> <span>Eve</span> <span>party</span>.<br/>
🎧 We're <span>expecting</span> that to be a really big <span>event</span>,<br/>
🎧 so <span>instead</span> of the <span>village</span> <span>hall</span>, it'll be <span>held</span> in the <span>Mountfort</span> <span>Hotel</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>The...</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Mountfort</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mountfort</span> <span>Hotel</span>.<br/>
🎧 It isn't in <span>Southoe</span> <span>itself</span>, but it's only a <span>couple</span> of <span>miles</span> away.<br/>
🎧 The <span>hotel</span> will be <span>providing</span> dinner and we've <span>booked</span> a <span>band</span>.<br/>
🎧 The one thing we haven't got yet is a <span>poster</span>.<br/>
🎧 That isn't something you could do, by any <span>chance</span>, is it?<br/>
🎧 Well actually, yes.<br/>
🎧 Before I <span>retired</span> I was a <span>graphic</span> <span>designer</span>, so that's right up my <span>street</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh perfect!<br/>
🎧 I'll give you the <span>details</span>,<br/>
🎧 and then <span>perhaps</span> you could <span>send</span> me a <span>draft..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>

🎧 Good morning, and <span>welcome</span> to <span>Oniton</span> <span>Hall</span>,<br/>
🎧 one of the <span>largest</span> <span>estates</span> in the <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>name's</span> <span>Nick</span>, and I'm one of the <span>guides</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll give you a <span>brief</span> <span>introduction</span> to the <span>estate</span> while you're <span>sitting</span> down,<br/>
🎧 and then we'll <span>walk</span> <span>round</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>estate</span> <span>consists</span> of the house, <span>gardens</span>, <span>parkland</span> and <span>farm</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it <span>dates</span> back to the <span>fourteenth</span> <span>century</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>original</span> house was <span>replaced</span> in the <span>late</span> <span>seventeenth</span> <span>century</span>,<br/>
🎧 and of course it has had a large number of <span>owners</span>.<br/>
🎧 Almost all of them have <span>left</span> their <span>mark</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>generally</span> by <span>adding</span> new <span>rooms</span>, like the <span>ballroom</span> and <span>conservatory</span>,<br/>
🎧 or by <span>demolishing</span> <span>others</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>farm</span> looks much as it's always done,<br/>
🎧 although the <span>current</span> <span>owner</span> has done a great <span>deal</span> of work to the <span>flower</span> <span>beds</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>seventeenth</span> <span>century</span>, the <span>estate</span> was <span>owned</span> by a very <span>wealthy</span> man called Sir <span>Edward</span> <span>Downes</span>.<br/>
🎧 His <span>intention</span> was to <span>escape</span> from the <span>world</span> of <span>politics</span>,<br/>
🎧 after years as an <span>active</span> <span>politician</span>,<br/>
🎧 and to <span>build</span> a new house <span>worthy</span> of his big <span>collection</span> of books, <span>paintings</span> and <span>sculptures</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>broke</span> off <span>contact</span> with his <span>former</span> <span>political</span> <span>allies</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>hosted</span> <span>meetings</span> of <span>creative</span> and <span>literary</span> people, like <span>painters</span> and <span>poets</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Unusually</span> for his time, he didn't <span>care</span> <span>whether</span> his <span>guests</span> were <span>rich</span> or <span>poor</span>,<br/>
🎧 as long as they had <span>talent</span>.<br/>
🎧 Big <span>houses</span> like <span>Oniton</span> had <span>dozens</span> of <span>servants</span> until the <span>1920s</span> or <span>30s</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we've <span>tried</span> to show what their working lives were like.<br/>
🎧 <span>Photographs</span> of course don't give much of an idea,<br/>
🎧 so <span>instead</span>, as you go <span>round</span> the house,<br/>
🎧 you'll see <span>volunteers</span> <span>dressed</span> up as <span>nineteenth-century</span> <span>servants</span>, going about their work.<br/>
🎧 They'll <span>explain</span> what they're doing,<br/>
🎧 and tell you their <span>recipes</span>, or what <span>tools</span> they're <span>using</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've just <span>introduced</span> this <span>feature</span> to <span>replace</span> the <span>audio</span> <span>guide</span> we used to have <span>available</span>.<br/>
🎧 I see there are a number of children here with you today.<br/>
🎧 Well, we have <span>several</span> <span>activities</span> <span>specially</span> for children,<br/>
🎧 like <span>dressing</span> up in the <span>sorts</span> of <span>clothes</span> that children <span>wore</span> in the <span>past</span>,<br/>
🎧 and as it's a fine day, some of you will probably want to play in the <span>adventure</span> <span>playground</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>latest</span> <span>addition</span> is <span>child-sized</span> <span>tractors</span>, that you can drive around the <span>grounds</span>.<br/>
🎧 We'll also be going into the <span>farm</span> that's <span>part</span> of the <span>estate</span>, where there's <span>plenty</span> to do.<br/>
🎧 Most of the <span>buildings</span> date from the <span>eighteenth</span> <span>century</span>,<br/>
🎧 so you can really <span>step</span> back into an <span>agricultural</span> <span>past</span>.<br/>
🎧 Until <span>recently</span>, the <span>dairy</span> was where <span>milk</span> from the <span>cows</span> was <span>turned</span> into <span>cheese</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's now the place to go for lunch, or <span>afternoon</span> tea,<br/>
🎧 or just a cup of <span>coffee</span> and a <span>slice</span> of <span>homemade</span> <span>cake</span>.<br/>
🎧 The big <span>stone</span> <span>building</span> that <span>dominates</span> the <span>farm</span> is the large <span>barn</span>,<br/>
🎧 and in here is our <span>collection</span> of <span>agricultural</span> <span>tools</span>.<br/>
🎧 These were used in the <span>past</span> to <span>plough</span> the <span>earth</span>, <span>sow</span> <span>seeds</span>, make <span>gates</span>, and much more.<br/>
🎧 There's a small <span>barn</span>, also made of <span>stone</span>,<br/>
🎧 where you can <span>groom</span> the <span>donkeys</span> and <span>horses</span>, to keep their <span>coats</span> <span>clean</span>.<br/>
🎧 They really <span>seem</span> to enjoy having it done,<br/>
🎧 and children love <span>grooming</span> them.<br/>
🎧 The <span>horses</span> no <span>longer</span> live in the <span>stables</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>instead</span> is the place to go to buy <span>gifts</span>, books,<br/>
🎧 our own <span>jams</span> and <span>pickles</span>, and <span>clothes</span> and <span>blankets</span> made of <span>wool</span> from our <span>sheep</span>.<br/>
🎧 Outside the <span>shed</span>, which is the only <span>brick</span> <span>building</span>,<br/>
🎧 you can <span>climb</span> into a <span>horse-drawn</span> <span>carriage</span> for a <span>lovely</span>, <span>relaxing</span> <span>tour</span> of the <span>park</span> and <span>farm</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>carriages</span> are well over a <span>hundred</span> years old.<br/>
🎧 And finally, the <span>parkland</span>, which was <span>laid</span> out in the <span>eighteenth</span> <span>century</span>,<br/>
🎧 with a <span>lake</span> and <span>trees</span> that are now well <span>established</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll see <span>types</span> of <span>cattle</span> and <span>sheep</span> that are <span>hardly</span> ever <span>found</span> on <span>farms</span> these <span>days</span>.<br/>
🎧 We're <span>helping</span> to <span>preserve</span> them, to <span>stop</span> their <span>numbers</span> <span>falling</span> <span>further</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, well, if you'd like to come with me, we will <span>start..</span>.<br/>

🎧 Did you make <span>notes</span> while you were watching the <span>performances</span> of <span>Romeo</span> and <span>Juliet</span>, <span>Gemma</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I did. I <span>found</span> it quite <span>hard</span> though.<br/>
🎧 I <span>kept</span> getting too <span>involved</span> in the play.<br/>
🎧 Me too.<br/>
🎧 I <span>ended</span> up not taking <span>notes</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>wrote</span> down my <span>impressions</span> when I got home.<br/>
🎧 Do you <span>mind</span> if I check a few things with you?<br/>
🎧 In case I've <span>missed</span> anything.<br/>
🎧 And I've also got some <span>questions</span> about our <span>assignment</span>.<br/>
🎧 No, it's good to talk things through.<br/>
🎧 I may have <span>missed</span> things too.<br/>
🎧 OK great.<br/>
🎧 So first of all,<br/>
🎧 I'm not sure how much <span>information</span> we should <span>include</span> in our <span>reviews</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right. Well, I don't think we need to <span>describe</span> what <span>happens</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Especially</span> as <span>Romeo</span> and <span>Juliet</span> is one of <span>Shakespeare's</span> most <span>well-known</span> <span>plays</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, everyone <span>knows</span> the <span>story</span>.<br/>
🎧 In an <span>essay</span> we'd focus on the <span>poetry</span> and <span>Shakespeare's</span> use of <span>imagery</span> <span>etc.</span>,<br/>
🎧 but that isn't really <span>relevant</span> in a <span>review</span>.<br/>
🎧 We're <span>supposed</span> to focus on how <span>effective</span> this <span>particular</span> <span>production</span> is.<br/>
🎧 We should say what made it a success or a <span>failure</span>.<br/>
🎧 And <span>part</span> of that <span>means</span> talking about the <span>emotional</span> <span>impact</span> the <span>performance</span> had on us.<br/>
🎧 I think that's important.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 And we should definitely <span>mention</span> how well the <span>director</span> <span>handled</span> important <span>bits</span> of the play <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 like when <span>Romeo</span> <span>climbs</span> <span>onto</span> <span>Juliet's</span> <span>balcony</span>.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>fight</span> between <span>Mercutio</span> and <span>Tybalt</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 It would also be <span>interesting</span> to <span>mention</span> the <span>theatre</span> <span>space<br/></span>
🎧 and how the <span>director</span> used <span>it<br/></span>
🎧 but I don't think we'll have <span>space</span> in <span>800</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 No. OK.<br/>
🎧 That all sounds quite <span>straightforward</span>.<br/>
🎧 So what about The <span>Emporium</span> <span>Theatre's</span> <span>production</span> of the play?<br/>
🎧 I thought some things <span>worked</span> really well but there were some <span>problems</span> too.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. What about the set, for example?<br/>
🎧 I think it was <span>visually</span> really <span>stunning</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd say that was probably the most <span>memorable</span> thing about this <span>production</span>.<br/>
🎧 You're right. The set <span>design</span> was really amazing,<br/>
🎧 but actually I have <span>seen</span> <span>similar</span> <span>ideas</span> used in other <span>productions</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about the <span>lighting</span>?<br/>
🎧 Some of the <span>scenes</span> were so <span>dimly</span> <span>lit</span> it was quite <span>hard</span> to see.<br/>
🎧 I didn't <span>dislike</span> it.<br/>
🎧 It <span>helped</span> to change the <span>mood</span> of the <span>quieter</span> <span>scenes</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's a good <span>point</span>.<br/>
🎧 What did you think of the <span>costumes</span>?<br/>
🎧 I was a bit <span>surprised</span> by the <span>contemporary</span> <span>dress</span>, I must say.<br/>
🎧 Yeah <span>-</span> I think it <span>worked</span> well, but I had <span>assumed</span> it would be more <span>conventional</span>.<br/>
🎧 Me too.<br/>
🎧 I <span>liked</span> the music at the <span>beginning</span> and I thought the <span>musicians</span> were <span>brilliant</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I thought they were <span>wasted</span> because the music didn't have much <span>impact</span> in <span>Acts</span> <span>2</span> and <span>3</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes <span>-</span> that was a <span>shame</span>.<br/>
🎧 One <span>problem</span> with this <span>production</span> was that the <span>actors</span> didn't <span>deliver</span> the <span>lines</span> that well.<br/>
🎧 They were <span>speaking</span> too <span>fast</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was a <span>problem</span> I agree,<br/>
🎧 but I thought it was because they weren't <span>speaking</span> <span>loudly</span> enough,<br/>
🎧 <span>especially</span> at key <span>points</span> in the play.<br/>
🎧 I actually didn't have a <span>problem</span> with that.<br/>
🎧 It's been an <span>interesting</span> <span>experience</span> watching different <span>versions</span> of <span>Romeo</span> and <span>Juliet</span>, hasn't it?<br/>
🎧 Definitely.<br/>
🎧 It's made me <span>realise</span> how <span>relevant</span> the play still is.<br/>
🎧 Right. I mean a <span>lot's</span> <span>changed</span> since <span>Shakespeare's</span> time,<br/>
🎧 but in many <span>ways</span> <span>nothing's</span> <span>changed</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are always <span>disagreements</span> and <span>tension</span> between <span>teenagers</span> and their <span>parents</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's something all young people can <span>relate</span> to <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 more than the <span>violence</span> and the <span>extreme</span> <span>emotions</span> in the play.<br/>
🎧 How did you find watching it in <span>translation</span>?<br/>
🎧 Really <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>expected</span> to find it more <span>challenging</span>, but I could <span>follow</span> the <span>story</span> <span>pretty</span> well.<br/>
🎧 I <span>stopped</span> <span>worrying</span> about not being able to <span>understand</span> all the <span>words</span> and <span>focused</span> on the <span>actors'</span> <span>expressions</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>ending</span> was <span>pretty</span> <span>powerful</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes. That <span>somehow</span> <span>intensified</span> the <span>emotion</span> for me.<br/>
🎧 Did you know <span>Shakespeare's</span> been <span>translated</span> into more <span>languages</span> than any other <span>writer</span>?<br/>
🎧 What's the <span>reason</span> for his <span>international</span> <span>appeal</span>, do you think?<br/>
🎧 I was <span>reading</span> that it's because his <span>plays</span> are about <span>basic</span> <span>themes</span> that people <span>everywhere</span> are <span>familiar</span> with.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, and they can also be <span>understood</span> on different <span>levels</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>characters</span> have such <span>depth</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right <span>-</span> which <span>allows</span> <span>directors</span> to <span>experiment</span> and find new <span>angles</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's really <span>important..</span>.<br/>

🎧 Right, everyone, let's make a start.<br/>
🎧 Over the <span>past</span> few <span>sessions</span>,<br/>
🎧 we've been <span>considering</span> the <span>reasons</span> why some <span>world</span> <span>languages</span> are in <span>decline</span>,<br/>
🎧 and today I'm going to <span>introduce</span> another <span>factor</span> that <span>affects</span> <span>languages</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>speakers</span> of those <span>languages</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that's <span>technology</span>, and, in <span>particular</span>, <span>digital</span> <span>technology</span>.<br/>
🎧 In order to <span>illustrate</span> its <span>effect</span>,<br/>
🎧 I'm going to focus on the <span>Icelandic</span> <span>language</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is <span>spoken</span> by around <span>321,000</span> people,<br/>
🎧 most of whom live in <span>Iceland</span> <span>-</span> an <span>island</span> in the <span>North</span> <span>Atlantic</span> <span>Ocean</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>problem</span> for this <span>language</span> is not the number of <span>speakers</span>,<br/>
🎧 even though this number is small.<br/>
🎧 <span>Nor</span> is it about <span>losing</span> <span>words</span> to other <span>languages</span>, such as English.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, the <span>vocabulary</span> of <span>Icelandic</span> is <span>continually</span> <span>increasing<br/></span>
🎧 because when <span>speakers</span> need a new <span>word</span> for something,<br/>
🎧 they <span>tend</span> to <span>create</span> one, rather than <span>borrowing</span> from another <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 All this makes <span>Icelandic</span> quite a special <span>language</span>,<br/>
🎧 it's <span>changed</span> very little in the <span>past</span> <span>millennium</span>,<br/>
🎧 yet it can <span>handle</span> <span>twenty-first-century</span> <span>concepts</span> <span>related</span> to the use of <span>computers</span> and <span>digital</span> <span>technology</span>.<br/>
🎧 Take, for example, the <span>word</span> for web <span>browser..</span>.<br/>
🎧 this is <span>vafri</span> in <span>Icelandic</span>,<br/>
🎧 which comes from the <span>verb</span> <span>'to</span> <span>wander'</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can't think of a more <span>appropriate</span> <span>term</span> because that's exactly what you do <span>mentally</span> when you <span>browse</span> the <span>internet</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then there's an <span>Icelandic</span> <span>word</span> for <span>podcast</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is too <span>hard</span> to <span>pronounce</span>!<br/>
🎧 And so on.<br/>
🎧 <span>Icelandic</span>, then, is <span>alive</span> and <span>growing</span>, but <span>-</span> and it's a big but,<br/>
🎧 young <span>Icelanders</span> <span>spend</span> a great <span>deal</span> of time in the <span>digital</span> <span>world<br/></span>
🎧 and this <span>world</span> is <span>predominantly</span> English.<br/>
🎧 Think about <span>smartphones</span>.<br/>
🎧 They didn't even <span>exist</span> until <span>comparatively</span> <span>recently</span>,<br/>
🎧 but today young people use them all the time to read books, <span>watch</span> <span>TV</span> or <span>films</span>,<br/>
🎧 play <span>games</span>, listen to music, and so on.<br/>
🎧 <span>Obviously</span>, this is a good thing in many <span>respects</span> because it <span>promotes</span> their <span>bilingual</span> <span>skills</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>extent</span> of the <span>influence</span> of English in the <span>virtual</span> <span>world</span> is <span>staggering<br/></span>
🎧 and it's all <span>happening</span> really <span>fast</span>.<br/>
🎧 For their <span>parents</span> and <span>grandparents</span>,<br/>
🎧 the change is less <span>concerning</span> because they already have their <span>native-speaker</span> <span>skills</span> in <span>Icelandic</span>.<br/>
🎧 But for young <span>speakers</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 well, the <span>outcome</span> is a little <span>troubling</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, <span>teachers</span> have <span>found</span> that <span>playground</span> <span>conversations</span> in <span>Icelandic</span> <span>secondary</span> <span>schools<br/></span>
🎧 can be <span>conducted</span> <span>entirely</span> in English,<br/>
🎧 while <span>teachers</span> of much <span>younger</span> children have <span>reported</span> <span>situations<br/></span>
🎧 where their <span>classes</span> find it <span>easier</span> to say what is in a <span>picture</span> <span>using</span> English, rather than <span>Icelandic</span>.<br/>
🎧 The very <span>real</span> and <span>worrying</span> <span>consequence</span> of all <span>this<br/></span>
🎧 is that the young <span>generation</span> in <span>Iceland</span> is at <span>risk</span> of <span>losing</span> its <span>mother</span> <span>tongue</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course, this is <span>happening</span> to other <span>European</span> <span>languages</span> too,<br/>
🎧 but while <span>internet</span> <span>companies</span> might be <span>willing</span> to <span>offer</span>, say, <span>French</span> options in their <span>systems</span>,<br/>
🎧 it's much <span>harder</span> for them to <span>justify</span> the <span>expense</span> of doing the same for a <span>language<br/></span>
🎧 that has a <span>population</span> the size of a <span>French</span> <span>town</span>, such as Nice.<br/>
🎧 The other <span>drawback</span> of <span>Icelandic</span> is the <span>grammar</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is <span>significantly</span> more <span>complex</span> than in most <span>languages</span>.<br/>
🎧 At the <span>moment</span>, the <span>tech</span> <span>giants</span> are <span>simply</span> not interested in <span>tackling</span> this.<br/>
🎧 So, what is the <span>Icelandic</span> <span>government</span> doing about this?<br/>
🎧 Well, large <span>sums</span> of money are being <span>allocated</span> to a <span>language</span> <span>technology</span> <span>fund<br/></span>
🎧 that it is <span>hoped</span> will <span>lead</span> to the <span>development</span> of <span>Icelandic</span> <span>sourced</span> <span>apps<br/></span>
🎧 and other <span>social</span> <span>media</span> and <span>digital</span> <span>systems</span>,<br/>
🎧 but <span>clearly</span> this is going to be an <span>uphill</span> <span>struggle</span>.<br/>
🎧 On the <span>positive</span> side,<br/>
🎧 they know that <span>Icelandic</span> is still the <span>official</span> <span>language</span> of <span>education</span> and <span>government</span>.<br/>
🎧 It has <span>survived</span> for well over a <span>thousand</span> <span>years<br/></span>
🎧 and the <span>experts</span> <span>predict</span> that its future in this <span>nation</span> <span>state</span> is sound and will <span>continue</span> to be so.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, there's no <span>doubt</span> that it's <span>becoming</span> an <span>inevitable</span> second <span>choice</span> in young <span>people's</span> lives.<br/>
🎧 This <span>raises</span> important <span>questions</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you <span>consider</span> how much of the <span>past</span> is <span>tied</span> up in a <span>language</span>,<br/>
🎧 will young <span>Icelanders</span> <span>lose</span> their <span>sense</span> of their own <span>identity</span>?<br/>
🎧 Another issue that <span>concerns</span> the <span>government</span> of <span>Iceland</span> is this.<br/>
🎧 If children are <span>learning</span> two <span>languages</span> through different <span>routes</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>neither</span> of which they are <span>fully</span> <span>fluent</span> in,<br/>
🎧 will they be able to <span>express</span> <span>themselves</span> <span>properly</span>?<br/>
