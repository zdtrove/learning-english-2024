🎧 Hello, Jane Fairbanks speaking.<br/>
🎧 Oh, good morning.<br/>
🎧 My name's Frank Pritchard.<br/>
🎧 I've just retired and moved to Southoe.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to become a volunteer,<br/>
🎧 and I gather you co-ordinate voluntary work in the village.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 What sort of thing could I do?<br/>
🎧 Well, we need help with the village library.<br/>
🎧 We borrow books from the town library,<br/>
🎧 and individuals also donate them.<br/>
🎧 So, one thing you could do is get involved in collecting them,<br/>
🎧 if you've got a car, that is.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's no problem.<br/>
🎧 The times are pretty flexible so we can arrange it to suit you.<br/>
🎧 Oh, another thing is the records that we keep of the books we're given,<br/>
🎧 and those we borrow and need to return to the town library.<br/>
🎧 It would be very useful to have another person to help keep them up to date.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I'm used to working on a computer.<br/>
🎧 I presume they're computerised?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes.<br/>
🎧 Is the library purpose-built?<br/>
🎧 I haven't noticed it when I've walked round the village.<br/>
🎧 No, we simply have the use of a room in the village hall,<br/>
🎧 the West Room.<br/>
🎧 It's on the left as you go in.<br/>
🎧 I must go and have a look inside the hall.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's a nice building.<br/>
🎧 Do you run a lunch club in the village for elderly people?<br/>
🎧 I know a lot of places do.<br/>
🎧 Yes, we have a very successful club.<br/>
🎧 I could help with transport, if that's of any use.<br/>
🎧 Oh definitely!<br/>
🎧 People come to the club from neighbouring villages,<br/>
🎧 and we're always in need of more drivers.<br/>
🎧 And does the club have groups that focus on a particular hobby, too?<br/>
🎧 I could get involved in one or two,<br/>
🎧 particularly if there are any art groups.<br/>
🎧 Excellent.<br/>
🎧 I'll find out where we need help and get back to you.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 What about help for individual residents.<br/>
🎧 Do you arrange that at all?<br/>
🎧 Yes, we do it as a one-off.<br/>
🎧 In fact, there's Mrs Carroll.<br/>
🎧 She needs a lift to the hospital next week,<br/>
🎧 and we're struggling to find someone.<br/>
🎧 When's her appointment?<br/>
🎧 On Tuesday. It would take the whole morning.<br/>
🎧 I could do that.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that would be great. Thank you.<br/>
🎧 And also, next week,<br/>
🎧 we're arranging to have some work done to Mr Selsbury's house before he moves,<br/>
🎧 as he isn't healthy enough to do it himself.<br/>
🎧 We've got some people to decorate his kitchen,<br/>
🎧 but if you could do some weeding in his garden,<br/>
🎧 that would be wonderful.<br/>
🎧 OK. I'd enjoy that.<br/>
🎧 And presumably the day and time are flexible.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes. Just say when would suit you best, and we'll let Mr Selsbury know.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 The volunteers group also organises monthly social events,<br/>
🎧 which is a great way to meet other people, of course.<br/>
🎧 So next month, on the 19th of October,<br/>
🎧 we're holding a quiz,<br/>
🎧 a couple of residents are great at planning unusual ones,<br/>
🎧 and we always fill the village hall.<br/>
🎧 That sounds like fun.<br/>
🎧 Can I do anything to help?<br/>
🎧 Well, because of the number of people,<br/>
🎧 we need plenty of refreshments for halfway through.<br/>
🎧 So, if you could provide any, we'd be grateful.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure I could.<br/>
🎧 I'll think about what to make, and let you know.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Then on November the 18th,<br/>
🎧 we're holding a dance, also in the village hall.<br/>
🎧 We've booked a band that specialises in music of the 1930s,<br/>
🎧 they've been before, and we've had a lot of requests to bring them back.<br/>
🎧 I'm not really a dancer, but I'd like to do something to help.<br/>
🎧 Well, we sell tickets in advance,<br/>
🎧 and having an extra person to check them at the door, as people arrive, would be good,<br/>
🎧 it can be quite a bottleneck if everyone arrives at once!<br/>
🎧 OK, I'm happy with that.<br/>
🎧 Oh, we're also arranging a New Year's Eve party.<br/>
🎧 We're expecting that to be a really big event,<br/>
🎧 so instead of the village hall, it'll be held in the Mountfort Hotel.<br/>
🎧 The...?<br/>
🎧 Mountfort.<br/>
🎧 Mountfort Hotel.<br/>
🎧 It isn't in Southoe itself, but it's only a couple of miles away.<br/>
🎧 The hotel will be providing dinner and we've booked a band.<br/>
🎧 The one thing we haven't got yet is a poster.<br/>
🎧 That isn't something you could do, by any chance, is it?<br/>
🎧 Well actually, yes.<br/>
🎧 Before I retired I was a graphic designer, so that's right up my street.<br/>
🎧 Oh perfect!<br/>
🎧 I'll give you the details,<br/>
🎧 and then perhaps you could send me a draft...<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>

🎧 Good morning, and welcome to Oniton Hall,<br/>
🎧 one of the largest estates in the area.<br/>
🎧 My name's Nick, and I'm one of the guides.<br/>
🎧 I'll give you a brief introduction to the estate while you're sitting down,<br/>
🎧 and then we'll walk round.<br/>
🎧 The estate consists of the house, gardens, parkland and farm,<br/>
🎧 and it dates back to the fourteenth century.<br/>
🎧 The original house was replaced in the late seventeenth century,<br/>
🎧 and of course it has had a large number of owners.<br/>
🎧 Almost all of them have left their mark,<br/>
🎧 generally by adding new rooms, like the ballroom and conservatory,<br/>
🎧 or by demolishing others.<br/>
🎧 The farm looks much as it's always done,<br/>
🎧 although the current owner has done a great deal of work to the flower beds.<br/>
🎧 In the seventeenth century, the estate was owned by a very wealthy man called Sir Edward Downes.<br/>
🎧 His intention was to escape from the world of politics,<br/>
🎧 after years as an active politician,<br/>
🎧 and to build a new house worthy of his big collection of books, paintings and sculptures.<br/>
🎧 He broke off contact with his former political allies,<br/>
🎧 and hosted meetings of creative and literary people, like painters and poets.<br/>
🎧 Unusually for his time, he didn't care whether his guests were rich or poor,<br/>
🎧 as long as they had talent.<br/>
🎧 Big houses like Oniton had dozens of servants until the 1920s or 30s,<br/>
🎧 and we've tried to show what their working lives were like.<br/>
🎧 Photographs of course don't give much of an idea,<br/>
🎧 so instead, as you go round the house,<br/>
🎧 you'll see volunteers dressed up as nineteenth-century servants, going about their work.<br/>
🎧 They'll explain what they're doing,<br/>
🎧 and tell you their recipes, or what tools they're using.<br/>
🎧 We've just introduced this feature to replace the audio guide we used to have available.<br/>
🎧 I see there are a number of children here with you today.<br/>
🎧 Well, we have several activities specially for children,<br/>
🎧 like dressing up in the sorts of clothes that children wore in the past,<br/>
🎧 and as it's a fine day, some of you will probably want to play in the adventure playground.<br/>
🎧 Our latest addition is child-sized tractors, that you can drive around the grounds.<br/>
🎧 We'll also be going into the farm that's part of the estate, where there's plenty to do.<br/>
🎧 Most of the buildings date from the eighteenth century,<br/>
🎧 so you can really step back into an agricultural past.<br/>
🎧 Until recently, the dairy was where milk from the cows was turned into cheese.<br/>
🎧 It's now the place to go for lunch, or afternoon tea,<br/>
🎧 or just a cup of coffee and a slice of homemade cake.<br/>
🎧 The big stone building that dominates the farm is the large barn,<br/>
🎧 and in here is our collection of agricultural tools.<br/>
🎧 These were used in the past to plough the earth, sow seeds, make gates, and much more.<br/>
🎧 There's a small barn, also made of stone,<br/>
🎧 where you can groom the donkeys and horses, to keep their coats clean.<br/>
🎧 They really seem to enjoy having it done,<br/>
🎧 and children love grooming them.<br/>
🎧 The horses no longer live in the stables,<br/>
🎧 which instead is the place to go to buy gifts, books,<br/>
🎧 our own jams and pickles, and clothes and blankets made of wool from our sheep.<br/>
🎧 Outside the shed, which is the only brick building,<br/>
🎧 you can climb into a horse-drawn carriage for a lovely, relaxing tour of the park and farm.<br/>
🎧 The carriages are well over a hundred years old.<br/>
🎧 And finally, the parkland, which was laid out in the eighteenth century,<br/>
🎧 with a lake and trees that are now well established.<br/>
🎧 You'll see types of cattle and sheep that are hardly ever found on farms these days.<br/>
🎧 We're helping to preserve them, to stop their numbers falling further.<br/>
🎧 OK, well, if you'd like to come with me, we will start...<br/>

🎧 Did you make notes while you were watching the performances of Romeo and Juliet, Gemma?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I did. I found it quite hard though.<br/>
🎧 I kept getting too involved in the play.<br/>
🎧 Me too.<br/>
🎧 I ended up not taking notes.<br/>
🎧 I wrote down my impressions when I got home.<br/>
🎧 Do you mind if I check a few things with you?<br/>
🎧 In case I've missed anything.<br/>
🎧 And I've also got some questions about our assignment.<br/>
🎧 No, it's good to talk things through.<br/>
🎧 I may have missed things too.<br/>
🎧 OK great.<br/>
🎧 So first of all,<br/>
🎧 I'm not sure how much information we should include in our reviews.<br/>
🎧 Right. Well, I don't think we need to describe what happens.<br/>
🎧 Especially as Romeo and Juliet is one of Shakespeare's most well-known plays.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, everyone knows the story.<br/>
🎧 In an essay we'd focus on the poetry and Shakespeare's use of imagery etc.,<br/>
🎧 but that isn't really relevant in a review.<br/>
🎧 We're supposed to focus on how effective this particular production is.<br/>
🎧 We should say what made it a success or a failure.<br/>
🎧 And part of that means talking about the emotional impact the performance had on us.<br/>
🎧 I think that's important.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 And we should definitely mention how well the director handled important bits of the play -<br/>
🎧 like when Romeo climbs onto Juliet's balcony.<br/>
🎧 And the fight between Mercutio and Tybalt.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 It would also be interesting to mention the theatre space<br/>
🎧 and how the director used it<br/>
🎧 but I don't think we'll have space in 800 words.<br/>
🎧 No. OK.<br/>
🎧 That all sounds quite straightforward.<br/>
🎧 So what about The Emporium Theatre's production of the play?<br/>
🎧 I thought some things worked really well but there were some problems too.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. What about the set, for example?<br/>
🎧 I think it was visually really stunning.<br/>
🎧 I'd say that was probably the most memorable thing about this production.<br/>
🎧 You're right. The set design was really amazing,<br/>
🎧 but actually I have seen similar ideas used in other productions.<br/>
🎧 What about the lighting?<br/>
🎧 Some of the scenes were so dimly lit it was quite hard to see.<br/>
🎧 I didn't dislike it.<br/>
🎧 It helped to change the mood of the quieter scenes.<br/>
🎧 That's a good point.<br/>
🎧 What did you think of the costumes?<br/>
🎧 I was a bit surprised by the contemporary dress, I must say.<br/>
🎧 Yeah - I think it worked well, but I had assumed it would be more conventional.<br/>
🎧 Me too.<br/>
🎧 I liked the music at the beginning and I thought the musicians were brilliant,<br/>
🎧 but I thought they were wasted because the music didn't have much impact in Acts 2 and 3.<br/>
🎧 Yes - that was a shame.<br/>
🎧 One problem with this production was that the actors didn't deliver the lines that well.<br/>
🎧 They were speaking too fast.<br/>
🎧 It was a problem I agree,<br/>
🎧 but I thought it was because they weren't speaking loudly enough,<br/>
🎧 especially at key points in the play.<br/>
🎧 I actually didn't have a problem with that.<br/>
🎧 It's been an interesting experience watching different versions of Romeo and Juliet, hasn't it?<br/>
🎧 Definitely.<br/>
🎧 It's made me realise how relevant the play still is.<br/>
🎧 Right. I mean a lot's changed since Shakespeare's time,<br/>
🎧 but in many ways nothing's changed.<br/>
🎧 There are always disagreements and tension between teenagers and their parents.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's something all young people can relate to -<br/>
🎧 more than the violence and the extreme emotions in the play.<br/>
🎧 How did you find watching it in translation?<br/>
🎧 Really interesting.<br/>
🎧 I expected to find it more challenging, but I could follow the story pretty well.<br/>
🎧 I stopped worrying about not being able to understand all the words and focused on the actors' expressions.<br/>
🎧 The ending was pretty powerful.<br/>
🎧 Yes. That somehow intensified the emotion for me.<br/>
🎧 Did you know Shakespeare's been translated into more languages than any other writer?<br/>
🎧 What's the reason for his international appeal, do you think?<br/>
🎧 I was reading that it's because his plays are about basic themes that people everywhere are familiar with.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, and they can also be understood on different levels.<br/>
🎧 The characters have such depth.<br/>
🎧 Right - which allows directors to experiment and find new angles.<br/>
🎧 That's really important...<br/>

🎧 Right, everyone, let's make a start.<br/>
🎧 Over the past few sessions,<br/>
🎧 we've been considering the reasons why some world languages are in decline,<br/>
🎧 and today I'm going to introduce another factor that affects languages,<br/>
🎧 and the speakers of those languages,<br/>
🎧 and that's technology, and, in particular, digital technology.<br/>
🎧 In order to illustrate its effect,<br/>
🎧 I'm going to focus on the Icelandic language,<br/>
🎧 which is spoken by around 321,000 people,<br/>
🎧 most of whom live in Iceland - an island in the North Atlantic Ocean.<br/>
🎧 The problem for this language is not the number of speakers,<br/>
🎧 even though this number is small.<br/>
🎧 Nor is it about losing words to other languages, such as English.<br/>
🎧 In fact, the vocabulary of Icelandic is continually increasing<br/>
🎧 because when speakers need a new word for something,<br/>
🎧 they tend to create one, rather than borrowing from another language.<br/>
🎧 All this makes Icelandic quite a special language,<br/>
🎧 it's changed very little in the past millennium,<br/>
🎧 yet it can handle twenty-first-century concepts related to the use of computers and digital technology.<br/>
🎧 Take, for example, the word for web browser...<br/>
🎧 this is vafri in Icelandic,<br/>
🎧 which comes from the verb 'to wander'.<br/>
🎧 I can't think of a more appropriate term because that's exactly what you do mentally when you browse the internet.<br/>
🎧 Then there's an Icelandic word for podcast,<br/>
🎧 which is too hard to pronounce!<br/>
🎧 And so on.<br/>
🎧 Icelandic, then, is alive and growing, but - and it's a big but,<br/>
🎧 young Icelanders spend a great deal of time in the digital world<br/>
🎧 and this world is predominantly English.<br/>
🎧 Think about smartphones.<br/>
🎧 They didn't even exist until comparatively recently,<br/>
🎧 but today young people use them all the time to read books, watch TV or films,<br/>
🎧 play games, listen to music, and so on.<br/>
🎧 Obviously, this is a good thing in many respects because it promotes their bilingual skills,<br/>
🎧 but the extent of the influence of English in the virtual world is staggering<br/>
🎧 and it's all happening really fast.<br/>
🎧 For their parents and grandparents,<br/>
🎧 the change is less concerning because they already have their native-speaker skills in Icelandic.<br/>
🎧 But for young speakers -<br/>
🎧 well, the outcome is a little troubling.<br/>
🎧 For example, teachers have found that playground conversations in Icelandic secondary schools<br/>
🎧 can be conducted entirely in English,<br/>
🎧 while teachers of much younger children have reported situations<br/>
🎧 where their classes find it easier to say what is in a picture using English, rather than Icelandic.<br/>
🎧 The very real and worrying consequence of all this<br/>
🎧 is that the young generation in Iceland is at risk of losing its mother tongue.<br/>
🎧 Of course, this is happening to other European languages too,<br/>
🎧 but while internet companies might be willing to offer, say, French options in their systems,<br/>
🎧 it's much harder for them to justify the expense of doing the same for a language<br/>
🎧 that has a population the size of a French town, such as Nice.<br/>
🎧 The other drawback of Icelandic is the grammar,<br/>
🎧 which is significantly more complex than in most languages.<br/>
🎧 At the moment, the tech giants are simply not interested in tackling this.<br/>
🎧 So, what is the Icelandic government doing about this?<br/>
🎧 Well, large sums of money are being allocated to a language technology fund<br/>
🎧 that it is hoped will lead to the development of Icelandic sourced apps<br/>
🎧 and other social media and digital systems,<br/>
🎧 but clearly this is going to be an uphill struggle.<br/>
🎧 On the positive side,<br/>
🎧 they know that Icelandic is still the official language of education and government.<br/>
🎧 It has survived for well over a thousand years<br/>
🎧 and the experts predict that its future in this nation state is sound and will continue to be so.<br/>
🎧 However, there's no doubt that it's becoming an inevitable second choice in young people's lives.<br/>
🎧 This raises important questions.<br/>
🎧 When you consider how much of the past is tied up in a language,<br/>
🎧 will young Icelanders lose their sense of their own identity?<br/>
🎧 Another issue that concerns the government of Iceland is this.<br/>
🎧 If children are learning two languages through different routes,<br/>
🎧 neither of which they are fully fluent in,<br/>
🎧 will they be able to express themselves properly?<br/>
<br/><br/>
