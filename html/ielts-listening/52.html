🎧 Hello. Do you <span>mind</span> if I ask you some <span>questions</span> about your <span>journey</span> today?<br/>
🎧 We're doing a <span>customer</span> <span>satisfaction</span> <span>survey</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes. OK. I've got about ten <span>minutes</span> before my <span>train</span> home leaves.<br/>
🎧 I'm on a day <span>trip</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great. Thank you.<br/>
🎧 So first of all, could you tell me your name?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>Sophie</span> <span>Bird</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 And would you <span>mind</span> <span>telling</span> me what you do?<br/>
🎧 I'm a <span>journalist</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh really? That must be <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes. It is.<br/>
🎧 So was the <span>reason</span> for your visit here today work?<br/>
🎧 Actually, it's my day off.<br/>
🎧 I came here to do some <span>shopping</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh right.<br/>
🎧 But I do sometimes come here for work.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Now I'd like to ask some <span>questions</span> about your <span>journey</span> today, if that's OK.<br/>
🎧 Yes. No <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, so can you tell me which <span>station</span> you're <span>travelling</span> back to?<br/>
🎧 <span>Staunfirth</span>, where I live.<br/>
🎧 Ah, can I just check the <span>spelling</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>STAUNFIRTH</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 And you <span>travelled</span> from there this morning?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 OK, good.<br/>
🎧 Next, can I ask what kind of <span>ticket</span> you <span>bought</span>?<br/>
🎧 I <span>assume</span> it wasn't a <span>season</span> <span>ticket</span>, as you don't travel every day.<br/>
🎧 That's right. No, I just got a <span>normal</span> <span>return</span> <span>ticket</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't have a <span>rail</span> <span>card</span> so I didn't get any <span>discount</span>.<br/>
🎧 I keep <span>meaning</span> to get one because it's a lot <span>cheaper</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes <span>-</span> you'd have <span>saved</span> <span>20%</span> on your <span>ticket</span> today.<br/>
🎧 So you <span>paid</span> the full <span>price</span> for your <span>ticket</span>?<br/>
🎧 I <span>paid</span> <span>£23.70</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Do you think that's good <span>value</span> for money?<br/>
🎧 Not really.<br/>
🎧 I think it's too much for a <span>journey</span> that only takes <span>45</span> <span>minutes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's one of the <span>main</span> <span>complaints</span> we get.<br/>
🎧 So, you didn't buy your <span>ticket</span> in <span>advance</span>?<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 I know it's <span>cheaper</span> if you buy a week in <span>advance</span> but I didn't know I was <span>coming</span> then.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 You can't always plan ahead, <span>so..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>er.</span>. did you buy it this morning?<br/>
🎧 No, it was <span>yesterday</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And do you usually buy your <span>tickets</span> at the <span>station</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I do usually but the <span>ticket</span> <span>office</span> <span>closes</span> <span>early</span> and I <span>hate</span> <span>using</span> <span>ticket</span> <span>machines</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think <span>ticket</span> <span>offices</span> should be open for <span>longer</span> hours.<br/>
🎧 There's always a <span>queue</span> for the <span>machines</span> and they're often out of order.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm..</span>. A lot of <span>customers</span> are saying the same thing.<br/>
🎧 So to answer your <span>question…</span> I got an <span>e-ticket</span> online.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Now I'd like to ask you about your <span>satisfaction</span> with your <span>journey</span>.<br/>
🎧 So what would you say you were most <span>satisfied</span> with today?<br/>
🎧 Well, I like the <span>wifi</span> on the <span>train</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>improved</span> a lot.<br/>
🎧 It makes it <span>easier</span> for me to work if I want to.<br/>
🎧 That's the first time today <span>anyone's</span> <span>mentioned</span> that.<br/>
🎧 It's good to get some <span>positive</span> <span>feedback</span> on that.<br/>
🎧 And, <span>um..</span>. is there anything you weren't <span>satisfied</span> with?<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>normally</span>, the <span>trains</span> run on time and are <span>pretty</span> <span>reliable<br/></span>
🎧 but today there was a <span>delay;<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>train</span> was about <span>15</span> <span>minutes</span> behind <span>schedule</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK. I'll put that down.<br/>
🎧 Now I'd also like to ask about the <span>facilities</span> at this <span>station</span>.<br/>
🎧 You've probably <span>noticed</span> that the whole <span>station's</span> been <span>upgraded</span>.<br/>
🎧 What are you most <span>satisfied</span> with?<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh..</span>. I think the best thing is that <span>they've</span> <span>improved</span> the amount of <span>information</span> about <span>train</span> <span>times</span> <span>etc</span>. that's <span>given</span> to <span>passengers</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it's much <span>clearer</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 before there was only one <span>board</span> and I couldn't always see it <span>properly</span>,<br/>
🎧 which was <span>frustrating</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's good.<br/>
🎧 And is there anything you're not <span>satisfied</span> with?<br/>
🎧 Let's <span>see…<br/></span>
🎧 I think things have <span>generally</span> <span>improved</span> a lot.<br/>
🎧 The <span>trains</span> are much more <span>modern</span> and I like the new <span>café</span>.<br/>
🎧 But one thing is that there aren't enough <span>places</span> to sit down,<br/>
🎧 <span>especially</span> on the <span>platforms</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK,<br/>
🎧 so I'll put <span>'seating'</span> down, shall I, as the thing you're <span>least</span> <span>satisfied</span> with?<br/>
🎧 Yes, OK.<br/>
🎧 Can I ask your <span>opinion</span> about some of the other <span>facilities</span>?<br/>
🎧 We'd like <span>feedback</span> on <span>whether</span> people are <span>satisfied</span>, <span>dissatisfied</span> or <span>neither</span> <span>satisfied</span> <span>nor</span> <span>dissatisfied</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 What about the <span>parking</span> at the <span>station</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well to be <span>honest</span>, I don't really have an <span>opinion</span> as I never use it.<br/>
🎧 So, <span>neither</span> <span>satisfied</span> <span>nor</span> <span>dissatisfied</span> for that then.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I <span>suppose</span> <span>so…<br/></span>
🎧 OK, and what <span>about…<br/></span>
<br />

🎧 As <span>chair</span> of the <span>town</span> <span>council</span> <span>subcommittee</span> on <span>park</span> <span>facilities</span>,<br/>
🎧 I'd like to <span>bring</span> you up to date on some of the changes that have been made <span>recently</span> to the <span>Croft</span> <span>Valley</span> <span>Park</span>.<br/>
🎧 So if you could just take a look at the map I <span>handed</span> out,<br/>
🎧 let's <span>begin</span> with a <span>general</span> <span>overview</span>.<br/>
🎧 So the <span>basic</span> <span>arrangement</span> of the <span>park</span> hasn't <span>changed</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it still has two <span>gates</span>, <span>north</span> and <span>south</span>, and a <span>lake</span> in the <span>middle</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>café</span> <span>continues</span> to <span>serve</span> an <span>assortment</span> of <span>drinks</span> and <span>snacks<br/></span>
🎧 and is still in the same place,<br/>
🎧 looking out over the <span>lake</span> and next to the old <span>museum</span>.<br/>
🎧 We're <span>hoping</span> to change the <span>location</span> of the <span>toilets</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>bring</span> them <span>nearer</span> to the <span>centre</span> of the <span>park<br/></span>
🎧 as they're a bit out of the way at <span>present</span>, near the <span>adventure</span> <span>playground</span>, in the <span>corner</span> of your map.<br/>
🎧 The <span>formal</span> <span>gardens</span> have been <span>replanted</span> and should be at their best in a month or two.<br/>
🎧 They used to be behind the old <span>museum</span>,<br/>
🎧 but we've now used the <span>space</span> near the <span>south</span> <span>gate</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 between the <span>park</span> <span>boundary</span> and the <span>path</span> that <span>goes</span> <span>past</span> the <span>lake</span> <span>towards</span> the old <span>museum</span>.<br/>
🎧 We have a new <span>outdoor</span> gym for <span>adults</span> and children,<br/>
🎧 which is already <span>proving</span> very <span>popular</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's by the <span>glass</span> <span>houses</span>, just to the right of the <span>path</span> from the <span>south</span> <span>gate</span>.<br/>
🎧 You have to look for it as it's a bit <span>hidden</span> in the <span>trees</span>.<br/>
🎧 One very <span>successful</span> <span>introduction</span> has been our <span>skateboard</span> <span>ramp</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's in <span>constant</span> use during the <span>evenings</span> and <span>holidays</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's near the old <span>museum</span>,<br/>
🎧 at the end of a little <span>path</span> that <span>leads</span> off from the <span>main</span> <span>path</span> between the <span>lake</span> and the <span>museum</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've also <span>introduced</span> a new <span>area</span> for <span>wild</span> <span>flowers</span>, to <span>attract</span> <span>bees</span> and <span>butterflies</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's on a <span>bend</span> in the <span>path</span> that <span>goes</span> <span>round</span> the <span>east</span> side of the <span>lake</span>,<br/>
🎧 just <span>south</span> of the <span>adventure</span> <span>playground</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now let me tell you a bit more about some of the changes to <span>Croft</span> <span>Valley</span> <span>Park</span>.<br/>
🎧 One of our most <span>exciting</span> <span>developments</span> has been the <span>adventure</span> <span>playground</span>.<br/>
🎧 We were <span>aware</span> that we had <span>nowhere</span> for children to let off <span>steam</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>decided</span> to use our <span>available</span> <span>funds<br/></span>
🎧 to set up a <span>completely</span> new <span>facility</span> in a large <span>space</span> to the <span>north</span> of the <span>park</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's open <span>year-round</span>, though it <span>closes</span> <span>early</span> in the <span>winter</span> <span>months</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>entrance</span> is <span>completely</span> free.<br/>
🎧 Children can choose whatever <span>activities</span> they want to do, <span>irrespective</span> of their age,<br/>
🎧 but we do ask <span>adults</span> not to leave them on their own there.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>plenty</span> of <span>seats</span> where <span>parents</span> can <span>relax</span> and keep an eye on their children at the same time.<br/>
🎧 <span>Lastly</span>, the <span>glass</span> <span>houses</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>huge</span> amount of work has been done on <span>them<br/></span>
🎧 to <span>repair</span> the <span>damage</span> <span>following</span> the <span>disastrous</span> <span>fire</span> that <span>recently</span> <span>destroyed</span> their <span>western</span> side.<br/>
🎧 Over <span>£80,000</span> was <span>spent</span> on <span>replacing</span> the <span>glass</span> <span>walls</span> and the <span>metal</span> <span>supports</span>,<br/>
🎧 as well as the <span>plants</span> that had been <span>destroyed</span>,<br/>
🎧 although <span>unfortunately</span> the <span>collection</span> of <span>tropical</span> <span>palm</span> <span>trees</span> has <span>proved</span> too <span>expensive</span> to <span>replace</span> up to now.<br/>
🎧 At <span>present</span> the <span>glass</span> <span>houses</span> are open from <span>10</span> am to <span>3</span> pm <span>Mondays</span> to <span>Thursdays</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it's <span>hoped</span> to <span>extend</span> this to the weekend soon.<br/>
🎧 We're <span>grateful</span> to all those who <span>helped</span> us by <span>contributing</span> their time and money to this <span>achievement</span>.<br/>
<br />

🎧 OK, <span>Jack</span>. Before we plan our <span>presentation</span> about <span>refrigeration</span>,<br/>
🎧 let's <span>discuss</span> what we've <span>discovered</span> so <span>far</span>.<br/>
🎧 Fine, <span>Annie</span>.<br/>
🎧 Though I have to <span>admit</span> I haven't done much <span>research</span> yet.<br/>
🎧 <span>Nor</span> me.<br/>
🎧 But I <span>found</span> an <span>interesting</span> <span>article</span> about <span>icehouses</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd <span>seen</span> some <span>18th-</span> and <span>19th-century</span> <span>ones</span> here in the <span>UK</span>,<br/>
🎧 so I <span>knew</span> they were often <span>built</span> in a <span>shady</span> <span>area</span> or <span>underground</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>close</span> to <span>lakes</span> that might <span>freeze</span> in the <span>winter</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then <span>blocks</span> of ice could be cut and <span>stored</span> in the <span>icehouse</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I didn't <span>realise</span> that <span>insulating</span> the <span>blocks</span> with <span>straw</span> or <span>sawdust</span> <span>meant</span> they didn't <span>melt</span> for <span>months</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>ancient</span> <span>Romans</span> had <span>refrigeration</span>, too.<br/>
🎧 I didn't know that.<br/>
🎧 Yes, <span>pits</span> were <span>dug</span> in the <span>ground</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>snow</span> was <span>imported</span> from the <span>mountains</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 even though they were at quite a <span>distance</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>snow</span> was <span>stored</span> in the <span>pits</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ice <span>formed</span> at the <span>bottom</span> of it.<br/>
🎧 Both the ice and the <span>snow</span> were then <span>sold</span>.<br/>
🎧 The ice <span>cost</span> more than the <span>snow<br/></span>
🎧 and my <span>guess</span> is that only the <span>wealthy</span> <span>members</span> of <span>society</span> could <span>afford</span> it.<br/>
🎧 I wouldn't be <span>surprised</span>.<br/>
🎧 I also came across an <span>article</span> about <span>modern</span> <span>domestic</span> <span>fridges</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Several</span> different <span>technologies</span> are used,<br/>
🎧 but they were too <span>complex</span> for me to <span>understand</span>.<br/>
🎧 You have to <span>wonder</span> what <span>happens</span> when people get rid of old <span>ones</span>.<br/>
🎧 You mean because the <span>gases</span> in them are <span>harmful</span> for the <span>environment</span>?<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 At <span>least</span> there are now <span>plenty</span> of <span>organisations</span> that will <span>recycle</span> most of the <span>components</span> <span>safely</span>,<br/>
🎧 but of course some people just <span>dump</span> old <span>fridges</span> in the <span>countryside</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>hard</span> to see how they can be <span>stopped</span> <span>unfortunately</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>UK</span> we get rid of <span>three</span> <span>million</span> a year <span>altogether</span>!<br/>
🎧 That sounds a lot, <span>especially</span> because <span>fridges</span> <span>hardly</span> ever <span>break</span> down.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 In this <span>country</span> we keep <span>domestic</span> <span>fridges</span> for <span>11</span> years on <span>average</span>,<br/>
🎧 and a lot last for <span>20</span> or more.<br/>
🎧 So if you <span>divide</span> the <span>cost</span> by the number of years you can use a <span>fridge</span>, they're not <span>expensive</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>compared</span> with some <span>household</span> <span>appliances</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>True</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> <span>manufacturers</span> <span>encourage</span> people to <span>spend</span> more by <span>making</span> them different <span>colours</span> and <span>designs</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure when my <span>parents</span> <span>bought</span> their first <span>fridge</span> they had <span>hardly</span> any <span>choice</span>!<br/>
🎧 Yes, there's been quite a change.<br/>
🎧 Right, let's make a <span>list</span> of <span>topics</span> to <span>cover</span> in our <span>presentation</span>,<br/>
🎧 and decide who's going to do more <span>research</span> on them.<br/>
🎧 Then later, we can get together and plan the next <span>step</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 How about <span>starting</span> with how <span>useful</span> <span>refrigeration</span> is,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>range</span> of <span>goods</span> that are <span>refrigerated</span> <span>nowadays</span>?<br/>
🎧 Because of course it's not just food and <span>drinks</span>.<br/>
🎧 No, I <span>suppose</span> <span>flowers</span> and <span>medicines</span> are <span>refrigerated</span>, too.<br/>
🎧 And <span>computers</span>.<br/>
🎧 I could do that, <span>unless</span> you <span>particularly</span> want to.<br/>
🎧 No, that's fine by me.<br/>
🎧 What about the <span>effects</span> of <span>refrigeration</span> on <span>people's</span> <span>health</span>?<br/>
🎧 After all, some of the <span>chemicals</span> used in the <span>19th</span> <span>century</span> were <span>pretty</span> <span>harmful</span>,<br/>
🎧 but there have been lots of <span>benefits</span> too,<br/>
🎧 like always having <span>access</span> to <span>fresh</span> food.<br/>
🎧 Do you <span>fancy</span> <span>dealing</span> with that?<br/>
🎧 I'm not <span>terribly</span> <span>keen</span>, to be <span>honest</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Nor</span> me.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mind</span> just <span>goes</span> <span>blank</span> when I read anything about <span>chemicals</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, all right then, I'll do you a <span>favour</span>.<br/>
🎧 But you <span>owe</span> me, <span>Jack</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 What about the <span>effects</span> on food <span>producers</span>,<br/>
🎧 like <span>farmers</span> in <span>poorer</span> <span>countries</span> being able to <span>export</span> their <span>produce</span> to <span>developed</span> <span>countries</span>?<br/>
🎧 Something for you, maybe?<br/>
🎧 I don't <span>mind</span>. It should be quite <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think we should also look at how <span>refrigeration</span> has <span>helped</span> whole <span>cities</span> <span>-</span> like <span>Las</span> <span>Vegas</span>,<br/>
🎧 which couldn't <span>exist</span> without <span>refrigeration<br/></span>
🎧 because it's in the <span>middle</span> of a <span>desert</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I had a <span>quick</span> look at an <span>economics</span> book in the <span>library</span> that's got a <span>chapter</span> about this <span>sort</span> of thing.<br/>
🎧 I could give you the <span>title</span>, if you want to do this <span>section</span>.<br/>
🎧 Not <span>particularly</span>, to be <span>honest</span>.<br/>
🎧 I find <span>economics</span> books <span>pretty</span> <span>heavy</span> going, as a <span>rule</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, leave it to me, then.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Then there's <span>transport</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>difference</span> that <span>refrigerated</span> <span>trucks</span> have made.<br/>
🎧 I wouldn't <span>mind</span> having a go at that.<br/>
🎧 Don't <span>forget</span> <span>trains</span>, too.<br/>
🎧 I read something about <span>milk</span> and <span>butter</span> being <span>transported</span> in <span>refrigerated</span> <span>railroad</span> <span>cars</span> in the <span>USA</span>,<br/>
🎧 right back in the <span>1840s</span>.<br/>
🎧 I hadn't thought of <span>trains</span>. Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Shall we have a <span>separate</span> <span>section</span> on <span>domestic</span> <span>fridges</span>?<br/>
🎧 After all, they're something <span>everyone's</span> <span>familiar</span> with.<br/>
🎧 What about <span>splitting</span> it into two?<br/>
🎧 You could <span>investigate</span> <span>19th-</span> and <span>20th-century</span> <span>fridges</span>,<br/>

🎧 Hi everyone,<br/>
🎧 in this <span>session</span> I'll be <span>presenting</span> my <span>research</span> about the <span>social</span> <span>history</span> of <span>Britain</span> during the <span>Industrial</span> <span>Revolution</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>particularly</span> <span>looked</span> at how <span>ordinary</span> lives were <span>affected</span> by changes that <span>happened</span> at that time.<br/>
🎧 This was a time that saw the <span>beginning</span> of a new <span>phenomenon;</span> <span>consumerism</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 where <span>buying</span> and <span>selling</span> <span>goods</span> <span>became</span> a <span>major</span> <span>part</span> of <span>ordinary</span> <span>people's</span> lives.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, it was in the <span>19th</span> <span>century</span> that the <span>quantity</span> and <span>quality</span> of <span>people's</span> <span>possessions<br/></span>
🎧 was used as an <span>indication</span> of the <span>wealth</span> of the <span>country</span>.<br/>
🎧 Before this, the <span>vast</span> <span>majority</span> of people had very few <span>possessions</span>,<br/>
🎧 but all that was <span>changed</span> by the <span>Industrial</span> <span>Revolution</span>.<br/>
🎧 This was the era from the <span>mid-18th</span> to the <span>late</span> <span>19th</span> <span>century</span>,<br/>
🎧 when <span>improvements</span> in how <span>goods</span> were <span>made<br/></span>
🎧 as well as in <span>technology</span> <span>triggered</span> <span>massive</span> <span>social</span> <span>changes<br/></span>
🎧 that <span>transformed</span> life for just about <span>everybody</span> in <span>several</span> key <span>areas</span>.<br/>
🎧 First let's look at <span>manufacturing</span>.<br/>
🎧 When it comes to <span>manufacturing</span>,<br/>
🎧 we <span>tend</span> to think of the <span>Industrial</span> <span>Revolution</span> in <span>images</span> of <span>steam</span> <span>engines</span> and <span>coal</span>.<br/>
🎧 And it's <span>true</span> that the <span>Industrial</span> <span>Revolution</span> couldn't have taken place at <span>all<br/></span>
🎧 if it weren't for these new <span>sources</span> of <span>power</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>marked</span> an important <span>shift</span> away from the <span>traditional</span> <span>watermills</span> and <span>windmills<br/></span>
🎧 that had <span>dominated</span> before this.<br/>
🎧 The most <span>advanced</span> <span>industry</span> for much of the <span>19th</span> <span>century</span> was <span>textiles</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>meant</span> that <span>fashionable</span> <span>fabrics</span>, and <span>lace</span> and <span>ribbons</span> were made <span>available</span> to everyone.<br/>
🎧 Before the <span>Industrial</span> <span>Revolution</span>, most people made <span>goods</span> to sell in small <span>workshops</span>,<br/>
🎧 often in their own <span>homes</span>.<br/>
🎧 But <span>enormous</span> new <span>machines</span> were now being <span>created<br/></span>
🎧 that could <span>produce</span> the <span>goods</span> <span>faster</span> and on a <span>larger</span> <span>scale</span>,<br/>
🎧 and these <span>required</span> a lot more <span>space</span>.<br/>
🎧 So large <span>factories</span> were <span>built</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>replacing</span> the <span>workshops</span>, and <span>forcing</span> <span>workers</span> to travel to work.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, large <span>numbers</span> of people <span>migrated</span> from <span>villages</span> into <span>towns</span> as a <span>result</span>.<br/>
🎧 As well as <span>manufacturing</span>, there were new <span>technologies</span> in <span>transport</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>contributing</span> to the <span>growth</span> of <span>consumerism</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>horse-drawn</span> <span>stagecoaches</span> and <span>carts</span> of the <span>18th</span> <span>century</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>carried</span> very few people and <span>goods</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>travelled</span> <span>slowly</span> along <span>poorly</span> <span>surfaced</span> <span>roads</span>,<br/>
🎧 were <span>gradually</span> <span>replaced</span> by the <span>numerous</span> <span>canals</span> that were <span>constructed</span>.<br/>
🎧 These were <span>particularly</span> important for the <span>transportation</span> of <span>goods</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>canals</span> <span>gradually</span> <span>fell</span> out of use, though, as <span>railways</span> were <span>developed</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>becoming</span> the <span>main</span> way of <span>moving</span> <span>goods</span> and people from one end of the <span>country</span> to the other.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>goods</span> they <span>moved</span> weren't just <span>coal</span>, <span>iron</span>, <span>clothes</span>, and so on <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>significantly</span>, they <span>included</span> <span>newspapers</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>meant</span> that <span>thousands</span> of people were not only more <span>knowledgeable</span> about what was going on in the <span>country</span>,<br/>
🎧 but could also read about what was <span>available</span> in the <span>shops</span>.<br/>
🎧 And that <span>encouraged</span> them to buy more.<br/>
🎧 so <span>faster</span> <span>forms</span> of <span>transport</span> <span>resulted</span> in <span>distribution</span> <span>becoming</span> <span>far</span> more <span>efficient</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>goods</span> could now be <span>sold</span> all over the <span>country</span>, <span>instead</span> of just in the <span>local</span> <span>market</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>third</span> <span>main</span> <span>area</span> that saw changes that <span>contributed</span> to <span>consumerism</span> was <span>retailing</span>.<br/>
🎧 The number and <span>quality</span> of <span>shops</span> <span>grew</span> <span>rapidly</span>,<br/>
🎧 and in <span>particular</span>, small <span>shops</span> <span>suffered</span> as <span>customers</span> <span>flocked</span> to the <span>growing</span> number of <span>department</span> <span>stores</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 a <span>form</span> of <span>retailing</span> that was new in the <span>19th</span> <span>century</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>entrepreneurs</span> who <span>opened</span> these <span>found</span> new <span>ways</span> to <span>stock</span> them with <span>goods</span>,<br/>
🎧 and to <span>attract</span> <span>customers</span>:<br/>
🎧 for <span>instance</span>, <span>improved</span> <span>lighting</span> inside <span>greatly</span> <span>increased</span> the <span>visibility</span> of the <span>goods</span> for <span>sale</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>development</span> that made <span>goods</span> more <span>visible</span> from outside <span>resulted</span> from the use of <span>plate</span> <span>glass</span>,<br/>
🎧 which made it <span>possible</span> for <span>windows</span> to be much <span>larger</span> than <span>previously</span>.<br/>
🎧 New <span>ways</span> of <span>promoting</span> <span>goods</span> were <span>introduced</span>, too.<br/>
🎧 <span>Previously</span>, the focus had been on <span>informing</span> <span>potential</span> <span>customers</span> about the <span>availability</span> of <span>goods;<br/></span>
🎧 now there was an <span>explosion</span> in <span>advertising</span> trying to <span>persuade</span> people to go <span>shopping</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Flanders</span> <span>claims</span> that one of the great <span>effects</span> of the <span>Industrial</span> <span>Revolution</span> was that it <span>created</span> <span>choice</span>.<br/>
🎧 All <span>sorts</span> of things that had <span>previously</span> been <span>luxuries</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 from <span>sugar</span> to <span>cutlery</span> <span>-</span> <span>became</span> <span>conveniences</span>,<br/>
🎧 and before long they'd <span>turned</span> into <span>necessities</span>:<br/>
🎧 life without <span>sugar</span> or <span>cutlery</span> was <span>unimaginable</span>.<br/>
🎧 Rather like <span>mobile</span> <span>phones</span> these <span>days</span>!<br/>
