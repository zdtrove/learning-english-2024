🎧 Hello. Do you mind</span> if I ask you some questions</span> about your journey</span> today?<br/>
🎧 We're doing a customer</span> satisfaction</span> survey</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes. OK. I've got about ten minutes</span> before my train</span> home leaves.<br/>
🎧 I'm on a day trip</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great. Thank you.<br/>
🎧 So first of all, could you tell me your name?<br/>
🎧 It's Sophie</span> Bird</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 And would you mind</span> telling</span> me what you do?<br/>
🎧 I'm a journalist</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh really? That must be interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes. It is.<br/>
🎧 So was the reason</span> for your visit here today work?<br/>
🎧 Actually, it's my day off.<br/>
🎧 I came here to do some shopping</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh right.<br/>
🎧 But I do sometimes come here for work.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Now I'd like to ask some questions</span> about your journey</span> today, if that's OK.<br/>
🎧 Yes. No problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, so can you tell me which station</span> you're travelling</span> back to?<br/>
🎧 Staunfirth</span>, where I live.<br/>
🎧 Ah, can I just check the spelling</span>?<br/>
🎧 STAUNFIRTH</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 And you travelled</span> from there this morning?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 OK, good.<br/>
🎧 Next, can I ask what kind of ticket</span> you bought</span>?<br/>
🎧 I assume</span> it wasn't a season</span> ticket</span>, as you don't travel every day.<br/>
🎧 That's right. No, I just got a normal</span> return</span> ticket</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't have a rail</span> card</span> so I didn't get any discount</span>.<br/>
🎧 I keep meaning</span> to get one because it's a lot cheaper</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes -</span> you'd have saved</span> 20%</span> on your ticket</span> today.<br/>
🎧 So you paid</span> the full price</span> for your ticket</span>?<br/>
🎧 I paid</span> £23.70</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Do you think that's good value</span> for money?<br/>
🎧 Not really.<br/>
🎧 I think it's too much for a journey</span> that only takes 45</span> minutes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's one of the main</span> complaints</span> we get.<br/>
🎧 So, you didn't buy your ticket</span> in advance</span>?<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 I know it's cheaper</span> if you buy a week in advance</span> but I didn't know I was coming</span> then.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 You can't always plan ahead, so..</span>.<br/>
🎧 er.</span>. did you buy it this morning?<br/>
🎧 No, it was yesterday</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And do you usually buy your tickets</span> at the station</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I do usually but the ticket</span> office</span> closes</span> early</span> and I hate</span> using</span> ticket</span> machines</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think ticket</span> offices</span> should be open for longer</span> hours.<br/>
🎧 There's always a queue</span> for the machines</span> and they're often out of order.<br/>
🎧 Hmm..</span>. A lot of customers</span> are saying the same thing.<br/>
🎧 So to answer your question…</span> I got an e-ticket</span> online.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Now I'd like to ask you about your satisfaction</span> with your journey</span>.<br/>
🎧 So what would you say you were most satisfied</span> with today?<br/>
🎧 Well, I like the wifi</span> on the train</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's improved</span> a lot.<br/>
🎧 It makes it easier</span> for me to work if I want to.<br/>
🎧 That's the first time today anyone's</span> mentioned</span> that.<br/>
🎧 It's good to get some positive</span> feedback</span> on that.<br/>
🎧 And, um..</span>. is there anything you weren't satisfied</span> with?<br/>
🎧 Well, normally</span>, the trains</span> run on time and are pretty</span> reliable<br/></span>
🎧 but today there was a delay;<br/></span>
🎧 the train</span> was about 15</span> minutes</span> behind schedule</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK. I'll put that down.<br/>
🎧 Now I'd also like to ask about the facilities</span> at this station</span>.<br/>
🎧 You've probably noticed</span> that the whole station's</span> been upgraded</span>.<br/>
🎧 What are you most satisfied</span> with?<br/>
🎧 Oh..</span>. I think the best thing is that they've</span> improved</span> the amount of information</span> about train</span> times</span> etc</span>. that's given</span> to passengers</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 it's much clearer</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 before there was only one board</span> and I couldn't always see it properly</span>,<br/>
🎧 which was frustrating</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's good.<br/>
🎧 And is there anything you're not satisfied</span> with?<br/>
🎧 Let's see…<br/></span>
🎧 I think things have generally</span> improved</span> a lot.<br/>
🎧 The trains</span> are much more modern</span> and I like the new café</span>.<br/>
🎧 But one thing is that there aren't enough places</span> to sit down,<br/>
🎧 especially</span> on the platforms</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK,<br/>
🎧 so I'll put 'seating'</span> down, shall I, as the thing you're least</span> satisfied</span> with?<br/>
🎧 Yes, OK.<br/>
🎧 Can I ask your opinion</span> about some of the other facilities</span>?<br/>
🎧 We'd like feedback</span> on whether</span> people are satisfied</span>, dissatisfied</span> or neither</span> satisfied</span> nor</span> dissatisfied</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 What about the parking</span> at the station</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well to be honest</span>, I don't really have an opinion</span> as I never use it.<br/>
🎧 So, neither</span> satisfied</span> nor</span> dissatisfied</span> for that then.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I suppose</span> so…<br/></span>
🎧 OK, and what about…<br/></span>
<br />

🎧 As chair</span> of the town</span> council</span> subcommittee</span> on park</span> facilities</span>,<br/>
🎧 I'd like to bring</span> you up to date on some of the changes that have been made recently</span> to the Croft</span> Valley</span> Park</span>.<br/>
🎧 So if you could just take a look at the map I handed</span> out,<br/>
🎧 let's begin</span> with a general</span> overview</span>.<br/>
🎧 So the basic</span> arrangement</span> of the park</span> hasn't changed</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 it still has two gates</span>, north</span> and south</span>, and a lake</span> in the middle</span>.<br/>
🎧 The café</span> continues</span> to serve</span> an assortment</span> of drinks</span> and snacks<br/></span>
🎧 and is still in the same place,<br/>
🎧 looking out over the lake</span> and next to the old museum</span>.<br/>
🎧 We're hoping</span> to change the location</span> of the toilets</span>,<br/>
🎧 and bring</span> them nearer</span> to the centre</span> of the park<br/></span>
🎧 as they're a bit out of the way at present</span>, near the adventure</span> playground</span>, in the corner</span> of your map.<br/>
🎧 The formal</span> gardens</span> have been replanted</span> and should be at their best in a month or two.<br/>
🎧 They used to be behind the old museum</span>,<br/>
🎧 but we've now used the space</span> near the south</span> gate</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 between the park</span> boundary</span> and the path</span> that goes</span> past</span> the lake</span> towards</span> the old museum</span>.<br/>
🎧 We have a new outdoor</span> gym for adults</span> and children,<br/>
🎧 which is already proving</span> very popular</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's by the glass</span> houses</span>, just to the right of the path</span> from the south</span> gate</span>.<br/>
🎧 You have to look for it as it's a bit hidden</span> in the trees</span>.<br/>
🎧 One very successful</span> introduction</span> has been our skateboard</span> ramp</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's in constant</span> use during the evenings</span> and holidays</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's near the old museum</span>,<br/>
🎧 at the end of a little path</span> that leads</span> off from the main</span> path</span> between the lake</span> and the museum</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've also introduced</span> a new area</span> for wild</span> flowers</span>, to attract</span> bees</span> and butterflies</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's on a bend</span> in the path</span> that goes</span> round</span> the east</span> side of the lake</span>,<br/>
🎧 just south</span> of the adventure</span> playground</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now let me tell you a bit more about some of the changes to Croft</span> Valley</span> Park</span>.<br/>
🎧 One of our most exciting</span> developments</span> has been the adventure</span> playground</span>.<br/>
🎧 We were aware</span> that we had nowhere</span> for children to let off steam</span>,<br/>
🎧 and decided</span> to use our available</span> funds<br/></span>
🎧 to set up a completely</span> new facility</span> in a large space</span> to the north</span> of the park</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's open year-round</span>, though it closes</span> early</span> in the winter</span> months</span>,<br/>
🎧 and entrance</span> is completely</span> free.<br/>
🎧 Children can choose whatever activities</span> they want to do, irrespective</span> of their age,<br/>
🎧 but we do ask adults</span> not to leave them on their own there.<br/>
🎧 There are plenty</span> of seats</span> where parents</span> can relax</span> and keep an eye on their children at the same time.<br/>
🎧 Lastly</span>, the glass</span> houses</span>.<br/>
🎧 A huge</span> amount of work has been done on them<br/></span>
🎧 to repair</span> the damage</span> following</span> the disastrous</span> fire</span> that recently</span> destroyed</span> their western</span> side.<br/>
🎧 Over £80,000</span> was spent</span> on replacing</span> the glass</span> walls</span> and the metal</span> supports</span>,<br/>
🎧 as well as the plants</span> that had been destroyed</span>,<br/>
🎧 although unfortunately</span> the collection</span> of tropical</span> palm</span> trees</span> has proved</span> too expensive</span> to replace</span> up to now.<br/>
🎧 At present</span> the glass</span> houses</span> are open from 10</span> am to 3</span> pm Mondays</span> to Thursdays</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it's hoped</span> to extend</span> this to the weekend soon.<br/>
🎧 We're grateful</span> to all those who helped</span> us by contributing</span> their time and money to this achievement</span>.<br/>
<br />

🎧 OK, Jack</span>. Before we plan our presentation</span> about refrigeration</span>,<br/>
🎧 let's discuss</span> what we've discovered</span> so far</span>.<br/>
🎧 Fine, Annie</span>.<br/>
🎧 Though I have to admit</span> I haven't done much research</span> yet.<br/>
🎧 Nor</span> me.<br/>
🎧 But I found</span> an interesting</span> article</span> about icehouses</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd seen</span> some 18th-</span> and 19th-century</span> ones</span> here in the UK</span>,<br/>
🎧 so I knew</span> they were often built</span> in a shady</span> area</span> or underground</span>,<br/>
🎧 close</span> to lakes</span> that might freeze</span> in the winter</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then blocks</span> of ice could be cut and stored</span> in the icehouse</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I didn't realise</span> that insulating</span> the blocks</span> with straw</span> or sawdust</span> meant</span> they didn't melt</span> for months</span>.<br/>
🎧 The ancient</span> Romans</span> had refrigeration</span>, too.<br/>
🎧 I didn't know that.<br/>
🎧 Yes, pits</span> were dug</span> in the ground</span>,<br/>
🎧 and snow</span> was imported</span> from the mountains</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 even though they were at quite a distance</span>.<br/>
🎧 The snow</span> was stored</span> in the pits</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ice formed</span> at the bottom</span> of it.<br/>
🎧 Both the ice and the snow</span> were then sold</span>.<br/>
🎧 The ice cost</span> more than the snow<br/></span>
🎧 and my guess</span> is that only the wealthy</span> members</span> of society</span> could afford</span> it.<br/>
🎧 I wouldn't be surprised</span>.<br/>
🎧 I also came across an article</span> about modern</span> domestic</span> fridges</span>.<br/>
🎧 Several</span> different technologies</span> are used,<br/>
🎧 but they were too complex</span> for me to understand</span>.<br/>
🎧 You have to wonder</span> what happens</span> when people get rid of old ones</span>.<br/>
🎧 You mean because the gases</span> in them are harmful</span> for the environment</span>?<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 At least</span> there are now plenty</span> of organisations</span> that will recycle</span> most of the components</span> safely</span>,<br/>
🎧 but of course some people just dump</span> old fridges</span> in the countryside</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's hard</span> to see how they can be stopped</span> unfortunately</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the UK</span> we get rid of three</span> million</span> a year altogether</span>!<br/>
🎧 That sounds a lot, especially</span> because fridges</span> hardly</span> ever break</span> down.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 In this country</span> we keep domestic</span> fridges</span> for 11</span> years on average</span>,<br/>
🎧 and a lot last for 20</span> or more.<br/>
🎧 So if you divide</span> the cost</span> by the number of years you can use a fridge</span>, they're not expensive</span>,<br/>
🎧 compared</span> with some household</span> appliances</span>.<br/>
🎧 True</span>.<br/>
🎧 I suppose</span> manufacturers</span> encourage</span> people to spend</span> more by making</span> them different colours</span> and designs</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure when my parents</span> bought</span> their first fridge</span> they had hardly</span> any choice</span>!<br/>
🎧 Yes, there's been quite a change.<br/>
🎧 Right, let's make a list</span> of topics</span> to cover</span> in our presentation</span>,<br/>
🎧 and decide who's going to do more research</span> on them.<br/>
🎧 Then later, we can get together and plan the next step</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 How about starting</span> with how useful</span> refrigeration</span> is,<br/>
🎧 and the range</span> of goods</span> that are refrigerated</span> nowadays</span>?<br/>
🎧 Because of course it's not just food and drinks</span>.<br/>
🎧 No, I suppose</span> flowers</span> and medicines</span> are refrigerated</span>, too.<br/>
🎧 And computers</span>.<br/>
🎧 I could do that, unless</span> you particularly</span> want to.<br/>
🎧 No, that's fine by me.<br/>
🎧 What about the effects</span> of refrigeration</span> on people's</span> health</span>?<br/>
🎧 After all, some of the chemicals</span> used in the 19th</span> century</span> were pretty</span> harmful</span>,<br/>
🎧 but there have been lots of benefits</span> too,<br/>
🎧 like always having access</span> to fresh</span> food.<br/>
🎧 Do you fancy</span> dealing</span> with that?<br/>
🎧 I'm not terribly</span> keen</span>, to be honest</span>.<br/>
🎧 Nor</span> me.<br/>
🎧 My mind</span> just goes</span> blank</span> when I read anything about chemicals</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, all right then, I'll do you a favour</span>.<br/>
🎧 But you owe</span> me, Jack</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 What about the effects</span> on food producers</span>,<br/>
🎧 like farmers</span> in poorer</span> countries</span> being able to export</span> their produce</span> to developed</span> countries</span>?<br/>
🎧 Something for you, maybe?<br/>
🎧 I don't mind</span>. It should be quite interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think we should also look at how refrigeration</span> has helped</span> whole cities</span> -</span> like Las</span> Vegas</span>,<br/>
🎧 which couldn't exist</span> without refrigeration<br/></span>
🎧 because it's in the middle</span> of a desert</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I had a quick</span> look at an economics</span> book in the library</span> that's got a chapter</span> about this sort</span> of thing.<br/>
🎧 I could give you the title</span>, if you want to do this section</span>.<br/>
🎧 Not particularly</span>, to be honest</span>.<br/>
🎧 I find economics</span> books pretty</span> heavy</span> going, as a rule</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, leave it to me, then.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Then there's transport</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the difference</span> that refrigerated</span> trucks</span> have made.<br/>
🎧 I wouldn't mind</span> having a go at that.<br/>
🎧 Don't forget</span> trains</span>, too.<br/>
🎧 I read something about milk</span> and butter</span> being transported</span> in refrigerated</span> railroad</span> cars</span> in the USA</span>,<br/>
🎧 right back in the 1840s</span>.<br/>
🎧 I hadn't thought of trains</span>. Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Shall we have a separate</span> section</span> on domestic</span> fridges</span>?<br/>
🎧 After all, they're something everyone's</span> familiar</span> with.<br/>
🎧 What about splitting</span> it into two?<br/>
🎧 You could investigate</span> 19th-</span> and 20th-century</span> fridges</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I'll concentrate</span> on what's available</span> these days</span>,<br/>
🎧 and how manufacturers</span> differentiate</span> their products</span> from those of their competitors</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, that'd suit</span> me.<br/>
<br />

🎧 Hi everyone,<br/>
🎧 in this session</span> I'll be presenting</span> my research</span> about the social</span> history</span> of Britain</span> during the Industrial</span> Revolution</span>.<br/>
🎧 I particularly</span> looked</span> at how ordinary</span> lives were affected</span> by changes that happened</span> at that time.<br/>
🎧 This was a time that saw the beginning</span> of a new phenomenon;</span> consumerism</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 where buying</span> and selling</span> goods</span> became</span> a major</span> part</span> of ordinary</span> people's</span> lives.<br/>
🎧 In fact</span>, it was in the 19th</span> century</span> that the quantity</span> and quality</span> of people's</span> possessions<br/></span>
🎧 was used as an indication</span> of the wealth</span> of the country</span>.<br/>
🎧 Before this, the vast</span> majority</span> of people had very few possessions</span>,<br/>
🎧 but all that was changed</span> by the Industrial</span> Revolution</span>.<br/>
🎧 This was the era from the mid-18th</span> to the late</span> 19th</span> century</span>,<br/>
🎧 when improvements</span> in how goods</span> were made<br/></span>
🎧 as well as in technology</span> triggered</span> massive</span> social</span> changes<br/></span>
🎧 that transformed</span> life for just about everybody</span> in several</span> key areas</span>.<br/>
🎧 First let's look at manufacturing</span>.<br/>
🎧 When it comes to manufacturing</span>,<br/>
🎧 we tend</span> to think of the Industrial</span> Revolution</span> in images</span> of steam</span> engines</span> and coal</span>.<br/>
🎧 And it's true</span> that the Industrial</span> Revolution</span> couldn't have taken place at all<br/></span>
🎧 if it weren't for these new sources</span> of power</span>.<br/>
🎧 They marked</span> an important shift</span> away from the traditional</span> watermills</span> and windmills<br/></span>
🎧 that had dominated</span> before this.<br/>
🎧 The most advanced</span> industry</span> for much of the 19th</span> century</span> was textiles</span>.<br/>
🎧 This meant</span> that fashionable</span> fabrics</span>, and lace</span> and ribbons</span> were made available</span> to everyone.<br/>
🎧 Before the Industrial</span> Revolution</span>, most people made goods</span> to sell in small workshops</span>,<br/>
🎧 often in their own homes</span>.<br/>
🎧 But enormous</span> new machines</span> were now being created<br/></span>
🎧 that could produce</span> the goods</span> faster</span> and on a larger</span> scale</span>,<br/>
🎧 and these required</span> a lot more space</span>.<br/>
🎧 So large factories</span> were built</span>,<br/>
🎧 replacing</span> the workshops</span>, and forcing</span> workers</span> to travel to work.<br/>
🎧 In fact</span>, large numbers</span> of people migrated</span> from villages</span> into towns</span> as a result</span>.<br/>
🎧 As well as manufacturing</span>, there were new technologies</span> in transport</span>,<br/>
🎧 contributing</span> to the growth</span> of consumerism</span>.<br/>
🎧 The horse-drawn</span> stagecoaches</span> and carts</span> of the 18th</span> century</span>,<br/>
🎧 which carried</span> very few people and goods</span>,<br/>
🎧 and travelled</span> slowly</span> along poorly</span> surfaced</span> roads</span>,<br/>
🎧 were gradually</span> replaced</span> by the numerous</span> canals</span> that were constructed</span>.<br/>
🎧 These were particularly</span> important for the transportation</span> of goods</span>.<br/>
🎧 The canals</span> gradually</span> fell</span> out of use, though, as railways</span> were developed</span>,<br/>
🎧 becoming</span> the main</span> way of moving</span> goods</span> and people from one end of the country</span> to the other.<br/>
🎧 And the goods</span> they moved</span> weren't just coal</span>, iron</span>, clothes</span>, and so on -<br/></span>
🎧 significantly</span>, they included</span> newspapers</span>,<br/>
🎧 which meant</span> that thousands</span> of people were not only more knowledgeable</span> about what was going on in the country</span>,<br/>
🎧 but could also read about what was available</span> in the shops</span>.<br/>
🎧 And that encouraged</span> them to buy more.<br/>
🎧 so faster</span> forms</span> of transport</span> resulted</span> in distribution</span> becoming</span> far</span> more efficient</span> -<br/></span>
