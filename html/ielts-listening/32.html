🎧 <span>Thorndyke's<br/>
🎧 Good morning. Is that Mr <span>Thorndyke?<br/>
🎧 <span>Speaking.<br/>
🎧 How can I help?<br/>
🎧 I've got quite a few things which need <span>painting and <span>fixing in the <span>flat<br/>
🎧 and I <span>wonder <span>whether you'd be able to do the work.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure I'd be able to help but let me take down a few <span>details.<br/>
🎧 Yes, of course.<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>firstly, how did you hear about us?<br/>
🎧 It was my friend May <span>Hampton…<br/>
🎧 you did some <span>excellent work for her a <span>couple of years ago.<br/>
🎧 Do you remember?<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes, that was in <span>West <span>Park <span>Flats, <span>lovely <span>lady.<br/>
🎧 Yes, she is.<br/>
🎧 And what's your name, please?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>Edith <span>Pargetter.<br/>
🎧 can you <span>spell your <span>surname, please?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>P-A-R-G-E-T-T-E-R.<br/>
🎧 <span>Double <span>T, right.<br/>
🎧 And do you live in <span>West <span>Park <span>Flats as well?<br/>
🎧 No, actually it's <span>East <span>Park, <span>Flat <span>4.<br/>
🎧 Oh, right, that's over the <span>road, I <span>seem to remember <span>- quite <span>difficult to get to.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's at the back of the <span>library.<br/>
🎧 Right, I know.<br/>
🎧 And what's your phone number?<br/>
🎧 <span>875934<br/>
🎧 but I'm out a great <span>deal in the <span>afternoons and <span>evenings.<br/>
🎧 So would the best time to <span>ring you be in the morning?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Fine. I've made a <span>note of that.<br/>
🎧 Can I just ask, I'll be in a <span>van and I know <span>parking's rather <span>difficult <span>round your <span>flats.<br/>
🎧 Where would you <span>recommend?<br/>
🎧 Well, I always tell people in <span>larger <span>vehicles to <span>park by the <span>postbox on the other side of the <span>road from the <span>entrance.<br/>
🎧 Good, thanks.<br/>
🎧 And will you be able to give me a full <span>itemised <span>quote?<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes, I'll <span>list all the <span>jobs <span>separately with <span>individual <span>prices.<br/>
🎧 That'd be a great help.<br/>
🎧 No <span>problem.<br/>
🎧 Now, what would you like me to do?<br/>
🎧 <span>Firstly and most <span>urgently is in the <span>kitchen.<br/>
🎧 With all the <span>weather <span>damage, the <span>glass in the <span>door has <span>cracked and I'd need that <span>fixing…<br/>
🎧 I <span>presume you mean <span>replacing?<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes. And as soon as <span>possible…<br/>
🎧 What I'll do is come <span>round <span>tomorrow morning and do that <span>immediately.<br/>
🎧 Oh, thank you so much.<br/>
🎧 The other things aren't so <span>urgent <span>but…<br/>
🎧 Now, I'll make a <span>note of everything you want doing.<br/>
🎧 Well, in the <span>kitchen I'd like some <span>painting doing.<br/>
🎧 All the <span>kitchen <span>walls?<br/>
🎧 Just the <span>area over the <span>cooker.<br/>
🎧 It's very <span>greasy…<br/>
🎧 <span>Right… it does <span>tend to get that way!<br/>
🎧 Yes!<br/>
🎧 Well, if you want a <span>proper <span>job done what I'd need to do is <span>strip the old <span>paint and <span>plaster it about a week before I <span>paint it.<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 Now, May tells me you also do work in the garden.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'd like you to <span>replace a <span>fence.<br/>
🎧 Just one?<br/>
🎧 Yes, at the <span>far end.<br/>
🎧 Fine. Shouldn't be a <span>problem.<br/>
🎧 And that's the lot.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, as I say I can come <span>round <span>tomorrow morning to look over things with you.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's great, thank you.<br/>
🎧 So, I'll look forward to <span>seeing you <span>tomorrow <span>at…<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 <span>Welcome to <span>Manham <span>Port, where a <span>thousand years of <span>history are <span>brought to life.<br/>
🎧 All the <span>family can enjoy a day out at <span>Manham:<br/>
🎧 visit our <span>copper <span>mine, see <span>models of the <span>machinery it used,<br/>
🎧 have your <span>photo taken in <span>nineteenth <span>century <span>costume,<br/>
🎧 <span>experience at first <span>hand how people <span>lived at different <span>stages <span>throughout <span>history,<br/>
🎧 and <span>especially how children <span>studied, <span>worked and <span>played.<br/>
🎧 The <span>port of <span>Manham is <span>located in <span>beautiful and <span>peaceful <span>countryside,<br/>
🎧 on a <span>bend in the great <span>River <span>Avon,<br/>
🎧 and <span>developed here because it's the <span>highest <span>navigable <span>point of the <span>Avon <span>-<br/>
🎧 <span>boats can go no <span>higher up this <span>river <span>-<br/>
🎧 and <span>proved a <span>handy place to <span>load and <span>unload <span>cargo to and from the sea,<br/>
🎧 which is over <span>23 <span>miles away.<br/>
🎧 A small <span>port was already <span>established here when, about <span>900 years ago, <span>tin was <span>discovered <span>nearby,<br/>
🎧 though it wasn't until the <span>Industrial <span>Revolution, when a <span>tremendous need for <span>metals of all <span>kinds <span>developed,<br/>
🎧 that <span>Manham <span>expanded to become one of the <span>busiest <span>ports in the <span>country.<br/>
🎧 And because it was already so <span>busy, <span>prospectors <span>began to look for other <span>minerals,<br/>
🎧 and by the end of the <span>nineteenth <span>century, <span>lead, <span>copper, <span>manganese and <span>arsenic were <span>added to the <span>cargos <span>leaving <span>Manham.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>early <span>days, the <span>ores had been <span>smelted <span>- or <span>processed <span>- in the same <span>area they were <span>mined.<br/>
🎧 But, as <span>demand <span>grew, the <span>smelting <span>process <span>required <span>huge <span>factory <span>furnaces or <span>fires to <span>melt the <span>metal from the <span>rock<br/>
🎧 and there was not enough <span>coal in the <span>local <span>area, so the <span>rocks <span>containing <span>minerals had to be <span>shipped long <span>distances.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sadly, in the <span>twentieth <span>century, the great <span>port of <span>Manham <span>declined,<br/>
🎧 and <span>thousands of <span>workers were <span>forced to <span>emigrate out of the <span>area.<br/>
🎧 The <span>building at the <span>port <span>fell into <span>disrepair,<br/>
🎧 and the place <span>became almost <span>forgotten.<br/>
🎧 But then, the <span>Manham <span>Trust was <span>formed to <span>conserve the <span>historical <span>resources of the <span>area.<br/>
🎧 It <span>organised <span>scores of <span>local <span>volunteers to <span>remove <span>undergrowth to find the <span>original <span>outlines of the <span>installations.<br/>
🎧 It then <span>brought in <span>paid <span>professionals to <span>match <span>installations with <span>maps of the <span>original <span>port <span>complex<br/>
🎧 and to set about <span>reconstructing it.<br/>
🎧 Today you can see the <span>results of this <span>ambitious <span>programme of <span>restoration.<br/>
🎧 The <span>intention, and we <span>believe this will be <span>realised before the end of the year,<br/>
🎧 is to <span>return <span>Manham <span>Port to the <span>condition it <span>reached at its <span>peak as <span>'the <span>greatest <span>copper <span>port in the <span>country'.<br/>
🎧 But what can you do and see on your visit today?<br/>
🎧 Here are just a few <span>highlights.<br/>
🎧 We <span>suggest you start with the visit to the <span>copper <span>mine.<br/>
🎧 Travel on <span>converted <span>mining <span>trains and <span>journey into the <span>depths of the <span>mountain along <span>seams once <span>worked by <span>hundreds of <span>miners.<br/>
🎧 <span>Watch out <span>especially for the great <span>pumping <span>machines which rid the <span>mine of water.<br/>
🎧 But please be <span>warned that, like all <span>mines, <span>ours is very <span>dark and <span>closed <span>in<br/>
🎧 and we do say that children under <span>five and also <span>dogs should NOT be taken into the <span>mine.<br/>
🎧 The next <span>recommended visit is to the <span>village school.<br/>
🎧 While looking <span>round the <span>classrooms, take a special look at our <span>display of <span>games, which is one of the <span>largest in the <span>world.<br/>
🎧 And it's <span>recommended that you time your visit to <span>coincide with a <span>guided <span>tour.<br/>
🎧 This will give you the <span>opportunity to ask lots of <span>questions.<br/>
🎧 Near the school is the <span>beautiful old <span>sailing <span>ketch called <span>'The <span>George'.<br/>
🎧 You are <span>welcome to <span>board the <span>boat and look <span>round the <span>cabins.<br/>
🎧 Look out for the <span>ship's <span>wheel which was <span>missing until only <span>five years <span>ago<br/>
🎧 when it was <span>dredged out of the <span>silt by a <span>local <span>fisherman.<br/>
🎧 We have no idea how it got <span>there<br/>
🎧 but it's been <span>polished and <span>proudly <span>restored to its <span>original place on the <span>boat.<br/>
🎧 Please take <span>care going down the <span>ladders if you wish to visit the <span>lower <span>deck <span>-<br/>
🎧 we don't <span>recommend you <span>allow young children to use them.<br/>
🎧 So we hope you have a <span>memorable visit to <span>Manham <span>Port<br/>
🎧 and will tell your friends all about us.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Hi, <span>Laura <span>- could you <span>spare a few <span>minutes to talk about the work <span>placement you did last <span>summer?<br/>
🎧 I'm thinking of doing one <span>myself…<br/>
🎧 Hi, <span>Tim. Sure.<br/>
🎧 Didn't you do <span>yours at an <span>environmental <span>services company?<br/>
🎧 That's <span>right…<br/>
🎧 It's only a very small <span>company<br/>
🎧 and they <span>needed <span>someone to <span>produce a company <span>brochure,<br/>
🎧 and I wanted to get some <span>business <span>experience<br/>
🎧 because I'm interested in a <span>career in <span>occupational <span>psychology in a <span>business <span>environment.<br/>
🎧 It was good because I had <span>overall <span>responsibility for the <span>project.<br/>
🎧 What kind of <span>skills do you think you <span>developed on the <span>placement?<br/>
🎧 I mean, <span>apart from the <span>ones you already <span>had…<br/>
🎧 Did you have to do all the <span>artwork for the <span>brochure, the <span>layout and everything?<br/>
🎧 We <span>hired the <span>services of a <span>professional <span>photographer for that.<br/>
🎧 I did have to use my IT <span>skills to a <span>certain <span>extent<br/>
🎧 because I cut and <span>pasted <span>text from <span>marketing <span>leaflets,<br/>
🎧 but that didn't <span>involve anything I hadn't done before.<br/>
🎧 Do you think you got any better at <span>managing your time and <span>prioritizing things?<br/>
🎧 You always used to say you had <span>trouble with <span>that…<br/>
🎧 Oh, definitely.<br/>
🎧 There was so much <span>pressure to meet the <span>project <span>deadline.<br/>
🎧 And I also got better at <span>explaining things and <span>asserting my <span>opinions,<br/>
🎧 because I had to have <span>weekly <span>consultations with the <span>marketing <span>manager and give him a <span>progress <span>report.<br/>
🎧 It sounds as if you got a lot out of it then.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely.<br/>
🎧 It was really <span>worthwhile…<br/>
🎧 But you know, the company <span>benefited <span>too…<br/>
🎧 Yes, they must have done.<br/>
🎧 After all, if they'd used a <span>professional <span>advertising <span>agency to <span>produce their <span>brochure <span>instead of doing it <span>in-house,<br/>
🎧 <span>presumably they'd have <span>paid a lot more?<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes.<br/>
🎧 I <span>worked it out <span>-<br/>
🎧 it would have been <span>250% more.<br/>
🎧 And I thought the end <span>result was good,<br/>
🎧 even though we did everything on <span>site.<br/>
🎧 The company has quite a <span>powerful <span>computer<br/>
🎧 and I <span>managed to <span>borrow some <span>scanning <span>software from the university.<br/>
🎧 The new <span>brochure looks really <span>professional;<br/>
🎧 it <span>enhances the <span>image of the company <span>straight away.<br/>
🎧 So in the long run it should help them to <span>attract <span>clients, and <span>improve their <span>sales <span>figures?<br/>
🎧 That's the idea. Yeah.<br/>
🎧 Well, all in all it sounds very <span>positive <span>-<br/>
🎧 I think I will go ahead and <span>apply for a <span>placement myself.<br/>
🎧 How do I go about it?<br/>
🎧 It's easy enough to do,<br/>
🎧 because there's a <span>government <span>agency called <span>STEP<br/>
🎧 <span>- <span>S-T-E-P<br/>
🎧 <span>- that <span>organises <span>placements for students.<br/>
🎧 You should start by getting their <span>booklet with all the <span>details <span>-<br/>
🎧 I <span>expect you can <span>download one from their <span>website.<br/>
🎧 Actually, <span>they've got <span>copies in the <span>psychology <span>department <span>-<br/>
🎧 I've <span>seen them there.<br/>
🎧 I'll just go to the <span>office and <span>pick one up.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And then if I were you, after I'd <span>looked at it I'd go over all the options with <span>someone…<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose I should ask my <span>tutor's advice.<br/>
🎧 He <span>knows more about me than <span>anyone.<br/>
🎧 One of the <span>career <span>officers would be better,<br/>
🎧 <span>they've got more <span>knowledge about the <span>jobs <span>market than your personal <span>tutor would have.<br/>
🎧 <span>OK…<br/>
🎧 And then when you know what you want you can <span>register with <span>STEP <span>-<br/>
🎧 you'll find their <span>address in the <span>booklet.<br/>
🎧 And once you've <span>registered they <span>assign you to a <span>mentor who looks after your <span>application.<br/>
🎧 And then I <span>suppose you just sit back and wait <span>till you hear something?<br/>
🎧 They told me at the <span>careers <span>office that it's best to be <span>proactive, and get <span>updates <span>yourself<br/>
🎧 by <span>checking the <span>website for new <span>placement <span>alerts.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>mentor is <span>supposed to keep you <span>informed, but you can't <span>rely on that.<br/>
🎧 I don't <span>suppose it's a good idea to get in touch with <span>companies <span>directly, is it?<br/>
🎧 Not <span>really…<br/>
🎧 But it is the company who <span>notifies you if they want you to go for an <span>interview.<br/>
🎧 You get a <span>letter of <span>invitation or an <span>email from <span>personnel <span>departments.<br/>
🎧 And do I <span>reply <span>directly to them?<br/>
🎧 Yes, you do.<br/>
🎧 <span>STEP only <span>gets <span>involved again once you've been made a <span>job <span>offer.<br/>
🎧 <span>Right…<br/>
🎧 So, once you've had an <span>interview you should let your <span>mentor know what the <span>outcome is?<br/>
🎧 I mean <span>whether you're <span>offered a <span>job, and <span>whether you've <span>decided to <span>accept it?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 They'll <span>inform the <span>careers <span>office once a <span>placement has been agreed,<br/>
🎧 so you don't have to do that.<br/>
🎧 Is that all then?<br/>
🎧 More or less.<br/>
🎧 Only once you've <span>accepted an <span>offer you'll probably have to <span>supply a <span>reference,<br/>
🎧 because the <span>placement will be <span>conditional on that.<br/>
🎧 And that's something you should ask your own <span>tutor to <span>provide.<br/>
🎧 He <span>knows about your <span>academic <span>ability and also about your <span>qualities, like <span>reliability.<br/>
🎧 Well, thanks very much for the <span>information <span>-<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>starting to <span>look…<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Today we're going to look at an important <span>area of <span>science, <span>namely <span>nanotechnology.<br/>
🎧 So what is it?<br/>
🎧 <span>Nano <span>means <span>tiny,<br/>
🎧 so it's <span>science and <span>engineering on the <span>scale of <span>atoms and <span>molecules.<br/>
🎧 The idea is that by <span>controlling and <span>rearranging <span>atoms, you can <span>literally <span>create anything.<br/>
🎧 <span>However, as we'll see, the <span>science of the small has some big <span>implications <span>affecting us in many <span>ways.<br/>
🎧 There's no <span>doubt that <span>nanotechnology <span>promises so much for <span>civilisation.<br/>
🎧 <span>However, all new <span>technologies have their <span>teething <span>problems.<br/>
🎧 And with <span>nanotechnology, <span>society often <span>gets the wrong idea about its <span>capabilities.<br/>
🎧 <span>Numerous <span>science-fiction books and <span>movies have <span>raised <span>people's <span>fears about <span>nanotechnology <span>-<br/>
🎧 with <span>scenarios such as <span>inserting little <span>nano-robots into your <span>body that <span>monitor everything you do without you <span>realising it,<br/>
🎧 or <span>self-replicating <span>nano-robots that <span>eventually take over the <span>world.<br/>
🎧 So how do we <span>safeguard such a <span>potentially <span>powerful <span>technology?<br/>
🎧 Some <span>scientists <span>recommend that <span>nano-particles be <span>treated as new <span>chemicals with <span>separate <span>safety <span>tests and <span>clear <span>labelling.<br/>
🎧 They <span>believe that <span>greater <span>care should also be taken with <span>nano-particles in <span>laboratories and <span>factories.<br/>
🎧 <span>Others have called for a <span>withdrawal of new <span>nano <span>products such as <span>cosmetics<br/>
🎧 and a <span>temporary <span>halt to many <span>kinds of <span>nanotech <span>research.<br/>
🎧 But as <span>far as I'm <span>concerned there's a need to <span>plough ahead with the <span>discoveries and <span>applications of <span>nanotechnology.<br/>
🎧 I really <span>believe that most <span>scientists would <span>welcome a way to <span>guard <span>against <span>unethical <span>uses of such <span>technology.<br/>
🎧 We can't go around thinking that all <span>innovation is bad, all <span>advancement is bad.<br/>
🎧 As with the <span>debate about any new <span>technology, it is how you use it that's important.<br/>
🎧 So let's look at some of its <span>possible <span>uses.<br/>
🎧 Thanks to <span>nanotechnology, there could be a <span>major <span>breakthrough in the <span>field of <span>transportation<br/>
🎧 with the <span>production of more <span>durable <span>metals.<br/>
🎧 These could be <span>virtually <span>unbreakable, <span>lighter and much more <span>pliable<br/>
🎧 <span>leading to <span>planes that are <span>50 <span>times <span>lighter than at <span>present.<br/>
🎧 Those same <span>improved <span>capabilities will <span>dramatically <span>reduce the <span>cost of <span>travelling into <span>space<br/>
🎧 <span>making it more <span>accessible to <span>ordinary people and <span>opening up a <span>totally new <span>holiday <span>destination.<br/>
🎧 In <span>terms of <span>technology, the <span>computer <span>industry will be able to <span>shrink <span>computer <span>parts down to <span>minute <span>sizes.<br/>
🎧 We need <span>nanotechnology in order to <span>create a new <span>generation of <span>computers<br/>
🎧 that will work even <span>faster and will have a <span>million <span>times more <span>memory<br/>
🎧 but will be about the size of a <span>sugar <span>cube.<br/>
🎧 <span>Nanotechnology could also <span>revolutionise the way that we <span>generate <span>power.<br/>
🎧 The <span>cost of <span>solar <span>cells will be <span>drastically <span>reduced<br/>
🎧 so <span>harnessing this <span>energy will be <span>far more <span>economical than at <span>present.<br/>
🎧 But <span>nanotechnology has much <span>wider <span>applications than <span>this<br/>
🎧 and could have an <span>enormous <span>impact on our <span>environment.<br/>
🎧 For <span>instance, <span>tiny <span>airborne <span>nano-robots could be <span>programmed to actually <span>rebuild the <span>ozone <span>layer,<br/>
🎧 which could <span>lessen the <span>impact of <span>global <span>warming on our <span>planet.<br/>
🎧 That's a <span>pretty amazing thought, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 On a more <span>local <span>scale,<br/>
🎧 this new <span>technology could help with the <span>clean-up of <span>environmental <span>disasters<br/>
🎧 as <span>nanotechnology will <span>allow us to <span>remove oil and other <span>contaminants from the water <span>far more <span>effectively.<br/>
🎧 And, if <span>nanotechnology <span>progresses as <span>expected <span>-<br/>
🎧 as a <span>sort of <span>building <span>block set of about <span>90 <span>atoms <span>-<br/>
🎧 then you could <span>build anything you wanted from the <span>bottom up.<br/>
🎧 In <span>terms of <span>production, this <span>means that you only use what you <span>need<br/>
🎧 and so there wouldn't be any <span>waste.<br/>
🎧 The <span>notion that you could <span>create anything at all has <span>major <span>implications for our <span>health.<br/>
🎧 It <span>means that we'll <span>eventually be able to <span>replicate anything.<br/>
🎧 This would have a <span>phenomenal <span>effect on our <span>society.<br/>
🎧 In time it could even <span>lead to the <span>eradication of <span>famine<br/>
🎧 through the <span>introduction of <span>machines that <span>produce food to <span>feed the <span>hungry.<br/>
🎧 But it's in the <span>area of <span>medicine that <span>nanotechnology may have its <span>biggest <span>impact.<br/>
🎧 How we <span>detect <span>disease will change as <span>tiny <span>biosensors are <span>developed to <span>analyse <span>tests in <span>minutes rather than <span>days.<br/>
🎧 There's even <span>speculation <span>nano-robots could be used to <span>slow the <span>ageing <span>process, <span>lengthening life <span>expectancy.<br/>
🎧 As you can see, I'm very <span>excited by the <span>implications that could be <span>available to us in the next few <span>decades.<br/>
🎧 Just how long it'll take, I <span>honestly don't know.<br/>
