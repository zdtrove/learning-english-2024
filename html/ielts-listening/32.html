🎧 Thorndyke's<br/>
🎧 Good morning. Is that Mr Thorndyke?<br/>
🎧 Speaking.<br/>
🎧 How can I help?<br/>
🎧 I've got quite a few things which need painting and fixing in the flat<br/>
🎧 and I wonder whether you'd be able to do the work.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure I'd be able to help but let me take down a few details.<br/>
🎧 Yes, of course.<br/>
🎧 Well, firstly, how did you hear about us?<br/>
🎧 It was my friend May Hampton…<br/>
🎧 you did some excellent work for her a couple of years ago.<br/>
🎧 Do you remember?<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes, that was in West Park Flats, lovely lady.<br/>
🎧 Yes, she is.<br/>
🎧 And what's your name, please?<br/>
🎧 It's Edith Pargetter.<br/>
🎧 can you spell your surname, please?<br/>
🎧 It's P-A-R-G-E-T-T-E-R.<br/>
🎧 Double T, right.<br/>
🎧 And do you live in West Park Flats as well?<br/>
🎧 No, actually it's East Park, Flat 4.<br/>
🎧 Oh, right, that's over the road, I seem to remember - quite difficult to get to.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's at the back of the library.<br/>
🎧 Right, I know.<br/>
🎧 And what's your phone number?<br/>
🎧 875934<br/>
🎧 but I'm out a great deal in the afternoons and evenings.<br/>
🎧 So would the best time to ring you be in the morning?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Fine. I've made a note of that.<br/>
🎧 Can I just ask, I'll be in a van and I know parking's rather difficult round your flats.<br/>
🎧 Where would you recommend?<br/>
🎧 Well, I always tell people in larger vehicles to park by the postbox on the other side of the road from the entrance.<br/>
🎧 Good, thanks.<br/>
🎧 And will you be able to give me a full itemised quote?<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes, I'll list all the jobs separately with individual prices.<br/>
🎧 That'd be a great help.<br/>
🎧 No problem.<br/>
🎧 Now, what would you like me to do?<br/>
🎧 Firstly and most urgently is in the kitchen.<br/>
🎧 With all the weather damage, the glass in the door has cracked and I'd need that fixing…<br/>
🎧 I presume you mean replacing?<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes. And as soon as possible…<br/>
🎧 What I'll do is come round tomorrow morning and do that immediately.<br/>
🎧 Oh, thank you so much.<br/>
🎧 The other things aren't so urgent but…<br/>
🎧 Now, I'll make a note of everything you want doing.<br/>
🎧 Well, in the kitchen I'd like some painting doing.<br/>
🎧 All the kitchen walls?<br/>
🎧 Just the area over the cooker.<br/>
🎧 It's very greasy…<br/>
🎧 Right… it does tend to get that way!<br/>
🎧 Yes!<br/>
🎧 Well, if you want a proper job done what I'd need to do is strip the old paint and plaster it about a week before I paint it.<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 Now, May tells me you also do work in the garden.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'd like you to replace a fence.<br/>
🎧 Just one?<br/>
🎧 Yes, at the far end.<br/>
🎧 Fine. Shouldn't be a problem.<br/>
🎧 And that's the lot.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, as I say I can come round tomorrow morning to look over things with you.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's great, thank you.<br/>
🎧 So, I'll look forward to seeing you tomorrow at…<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Welcome to Manham Port, where a thousand years of history are brought to life.<br/>
🎧 All the family can enjoy a day out at Manham:<br/>
🎧 visit our copper mine, see models of the machinery it used,<br/>
🎧 have your photo taken in nineteenth century costume,<br/>
🎧 experience at first hand how people lived at different stages throughout history,<br/>
🎧 and especially how children studied, worked and played.<br/>
🎧 The port of Manham is located in beautiful and peaceful countryside,<br/>
🎧 on a bend in the great River Avon,<br/>
🎧 and developed here because it's the highest navigable point of the Avon -<br/>
🎧 boats can go no higher up this river -<br/>
🎧 and proved a handy place to load and unload cargo to and from the sea,<br/>
🎧 which is over 23 miles away.<br/>
🎧 A small port was already established here when, about 900 years ago, tin was discovered nearby,<br/>
🎧 though it wasn't until the Industrial Revolution, when a tremendous need for metals of all kinds developed,<br/>
🎧 that Manham expanded to become one of the busiest ports in the country.<br/>
🎧 And because it was already so busy, prospectors began to look for other minerals,<br/>
🎧 and by the end of the nineteenth century, lead, copper, manganese and arsenic were added to the cargos leaving Manham.<br/>
🎧 In the early days, the ores had been smelted - or processed - in the same area they were mined.<br/>
🎧 But, as demand grew, the smelting process required huge factory furnaces or fires to melt the metal from the rock<br/>
🎧 and there was not enough coal in the local area, so the rocks containing minerals had to be shipped long distances.<br/>
🎧 Sadly, in the twentieth century, the great port of Manham declined,<br/>
🎧 and thousands of workers were forced to emigrate out of the area.<br/>
🎧 The building at the port fell into disrepair,<br/>
🎧 and the place became almost forgotten.<br/>
🎧 But then, the Manham Trust was formed to conserve the historical resources of the area.<br/>
🎧 It organised scores of local volunteers to remove undergrowth to find the original outlines of the installations.<br/>
🎧 It then brought in paid professionals to match installations with maps of the original port complex<br/>
🎧 and to set about reconstructing it.<br/>
🎧 Today you can see the results of this ambitious programme of restoration.<br/>
🎧 The intention, and we believe this will be realised before the end of the year,<br/>
🎧 is to return Manham Port to the condition it reached at its peak as 'the greatest copper port in the country'.<br/>
🎧 But what can you do and see on your visit today?<br/>
🎧 Here are just a few highlights.<br/>
🎧 We suggest you start with the visit to the copper mine.<br/>
🎧 Travel on converted mining trains and journey into the depths of the mountain along seams once worked by hundreds of miners.<br/>
🎧 Watch out especially for the great pumping machines which rid the mine of water.<br/>
🎧 But please be warned that, like all mines, ours is very dark and closed in<br/>
🎧 and we do say that children under five and also dogs should NOT be taken into the mine.<br/>
🎧 The next recommended visit is to the village school.<br/>
🎧 While looking round the classrooms, take a special look at our display of games, which is one of the largest in the world.<br/>
🎧 And it's recommended that you time your visit to coincide with a guided tour.<br/>
🎧 This will give you the opportunity to ask lots of questions.<br/>
🎧 Near the school is the beautiful old sailing ketch called 'The George'.<br/>
🎧 You are welcome to board the boat and look round the cabins.<br/>
🎧 Look out for the ship's wheel which was missing until only five years ago<br/>
🎧 when it was dredged out of the silt by a local fisherman.<br/>
🎧 We have no idea how it got there<br/>
🎧 but it's been polished and proudly restored to its original place on the boat.<br/>
🎧 Please take care going down the ladders if you wish to visit the lower deck -<br/>
🎧 we don't recommend you allow young children to use them.<br/>
🎧 So we hope you have a memorable visit to Manham Port<br/>
🎧 and will tell your friends all about us.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Hi, Laura - could you spare a few minutes to talk about the work placement you did last summer?<br/>
🎧 I'm thinking of doing one myself…<br/>
🎧 Hi, Tim. Sure.<br/>
🎧 Didn't you do yours at an environmental services company?<br/>
🎧 That's right…<br/>
🎧 It's only a very small company<br/>
🎧 and they needed someone to produce a company brochure,<br/>
🎧 and I wanted to get some business experience<br/>
🎧 because I'm interested in a career in occupational psychology in a business environment.<br/>
🎧 It was good because I had overall responsibility for the project.<br/>
🎧 What kind of skills do you think you developed on the placement?<br/>
🎧 I mean, apart from the ones you already had…<br/>
🎧 Did you have to do all the artwork for the brochure, the layout and everything?<br/>
🎧 We hired the services of a professional photographer for that.<br/>
🎧 I did have to use my IT skills to a certain extent<br/>
🎧 because I cut and pasted text from marketing leaflets,<br/>
🎧 but that didn't involve anything I hadn't done before.<br/>
🎧 Do you think you got any better at managing your time and prioritizing things?<br/>
🎧 You always used to say you had trouble with that…<br/>
🎧 Oh, definitely.<br/>
🎧 There was so much pressure to meet the project deadline.<br/>
🎧 And I also got better at explaining things and asserting my opinions,<br/>
🎧 because I had to have weekly consultations with the marketing manager and give him a progress report.<br/>
🎧 It sounds as if you got a lot out of it then.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely.<br/>
🎧 It was really worthwhile…<br/>
🎧 But you know, the company benefited too…<br/>
🎧 Yes, they must have done.<br/>
🎧 After all, if they'd used a professional advertising agency to produce their brochure instead of doing it in-house,<br/>
🎧 presumably they'd have paid a lot more?<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes.<br/>
🎧 I worked it out -<br/>
🎧 it would have been 250% more.<br/>
🎧 And I thought the end result was good,<br/>
🎧 even though we did everything on site.<br/>
🎧 The company has quite a powerful computer<br/>
🎧 and I managed to borrow some scanning software from the university.<br/>
🎧 The new brochure looks really professional;<br/>
🎧 it enhances the image of the company straight away.<br/>
🎧 So in the long run it should help them to attract clients, and improve their sales figures?<br/>
🎧 That's the idea. Yeah.<br/>
🎧 Well, all in all it sounds very positive -<br/>
🎧 I think I will go ahead and apply for a placement myself.<br/>
🎧 How do I go about it?<br/>
🎧 It's easy enough to do,<br/>
🎧 because there's a government agency called STEP<br/>
🎧 - S-T-E-P<br/>
🎧 - that organises placements for students.<br/>
🎧 You should start by getting their booklet with all the details -<br/>
🎧 I expect you can download one from their website.<br/>
🎧 Actually, they've got copies in the psychology department -<br/>
🎧 I've seen them there.<br/>
🎧 I'll just go to the office and pick one up.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And then if I were you, after I'd looked at it I'd go over all the options with someone…<br/>
🎧 I suppose I should ask my tutor's advice.<br/>
🎧 He knows more about me than anyone.<br/>
🎧 One of the career officers would be better,<br/>
🎧 they've got more knowledge about the jobs market than your personal tutor would have.<br/>
🎧 OK…<br/>
🎧 And then when you know what you want you can register with STEP -<br/>
🎧 you'll find their address in the booklet.<br/>
🎧 And once you've registered they assign you to a mentor who looks after your application.<br/>
🎧 And then I suppose you just sit back and wait till you hear something?<br/>
🎧 They told me at the careers office that it's best to be proactive, and get updates yourself<br/>
🎧 by checking the website for new placement alerts.<br/>
🎧 Your mentor is supposed to keep you informed, but you can't rely on that.<br/>
🎧 I don't suppose it's a good idea to get in touch with companies directly, is it?<br/>
🎧 Not really…<br/>
🎧 But it is the company who notifies you if they want you to go for an interview.<br/>
🎧 You get a letter of invitation or an email from personnel departments.<br/>
🎧 And do I reply directly to them?<br/>
🎧 Yes, you do.<br/>
🎧 STEP only gets involved again once you've been made a job offer.<br/>
🎧 Right…<br/>
🎧 So, once you've had an interview you should let your mentor know what the outcome is?<br/>
🎧 I mean whether you're offered a job, and whether you've decided to accept it?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 They'll inform the careers office once a placement has been agreed,<br/>
🎧 so you don't have to do that.<br/>
🎧 Is that all then?<br/>
🎧 More or less.<br/>
🎧 Only once you've accepted an offer you'll probably have to supply a reference,<br/>
🎧 because the placement will be conditional on that.<br/>
🎧 And that's something you should ask your own tutor to provide.<br/>
🎧 He knows about your academic ability and also about your qualities, like reliability.<br/>
🎧 Well, thanks very much for the information -<br/>
🎧 I'm starting to look…<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Today we're going to look at an important area of science, namely nanotechnology.<br/>
🎧 So what is it?<br/>
🎧 Nano means tiny,<br/>
🎧 so it's science and engineering on the scale of atoms and molecules.<br/>
🎧 The idea is that by controlling and rearranging atoms, you can literally create anything.<br/>
🎧 However, as we'll see, the science of the small has some big implications affecting us in many ways.<br/>
🎧 There's no doubt that nanotechnology promises so much for civilisation.<br/>
🎧 However, all new technologies have their teething problems.<br/>
🎧 And with nanotechnology, society often gets the wrong idea about its capabilities.<br/>
🎧 Numerous science-fiction books and movies have raised people's fears about nanotechnology -<br/>
🎧 with scenarios such as inserting little nano-robots into your body that monitor everything you do without you realising it,<br/>
🎧 or self-replicating nano-robots that eventually take over the world.<br/>
🎧 So how do we safeguard such a potentially powerful technology?<br/>
🎧 Some scientists recommend that nano-particles be treated as new chemicals with separate safety tests and clear labelling.<br/>
🎧 They believe that greater care should also be taken with nano-particles in laboratories and factories.<br/>
🎧 Others have called for a withdrawal of new nano products such as cosmetics<br/>
🎧 and a temporary halt to many kinds of nanotech research.<br/>
🎧 But as far as I'm concerned there's a need to plough ahead with the discoveries and applications of nanotechnology.<br/>
🎧 I really believe that most scientists would welcome a way to guard against unethical uses of such technology.<br/>
🎧 We can't go around thinking that all innovation is bad, all advancement is bad.<br/>
🎧 As with the debate about any new technology, it is how you use it that's important.<br/>
🎧 So let's look at some of its possible uses.<br/>
🎧 Thanks to nanotechnology, there could be a major breakthrough in the field of transportation<br/>
🎧 with the production of more durable metals.<br/>
🎧 These could be virtually unbreakable, lighter and much more pliable<br/>
🎧 leading to planes that are 50 times lighter than at present.<br/>
🎧 Those same improved capabilities will dramatically reduce the cost of travelling into space<br/>
🎧 making it more accessible to ordinary people and opening up a totally new holiday destination.<br/>
🎧 In terms of technology, the computer industry will be able to shrink computer parts down to minute sizes.<br/>
🎧 We need nanotechnology in order to create a new generation of computers<br/>
🎧 that will work even faster and will have a million times more memory<br/>
🎧 but will be about the size of a sugar cube.<br/>
🎧 Nanotechnology could also revolutionise the way that we generate power.<br/>
🎧 The cost of solar cells will be drastically reduced<br/>
🎧 so harnessing this energy will be far more economical than at present.<br/>
🎧 But nanotechnology has much wider applications than this<br/>
🎧 and could have an enormous impact on our environment.<br/>
🎧 For instance, tiny airborne nano-robots could be programmed to actually rebuild the ozone layer,<br/>
🎧 which could lessen the impact of global warming on our planet.<br/>
🎧 That's a pretty amazing thought, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 On a more local scale,<br/>
🎧 this new technology could help with the clean-up of environmental disasters<br/>
🎧 as nanotechnology will allow us to remove oil and other contaminants from the water far more effectively.<br/>
🎧 And, if nanotechnology progresses as expected -<br/>
🎧 as a sort of building block set of about 90 atoms -<br/>
🎧 then you could build anything you wanted from the bottom up.<br/>
🎧 In terms of production, this means that you only use what you need<br/>
🎧 and so there wouldn't be any waste.<br/>
🎧 The notion that you could create anything at all has major implications for our health.<br/>
🎧 It means that we'll eventually be able to replicate anything.<br/>
🎧 This would have a phenomenal effect on our society.<br/>
🎧 In time it could even lead to the eradication of famine<br/>
🎧 through the introduction of machines that produce food to feed the hungry.<br/>
🎧 But it's in the area of medicine that nanotechnology may have its biggest impact.<br/>
🎧 How we detect disease will change as tiny biosensors are developed to analyse tests in minutes rather than days.<br/>
🎧 There's even speculation nano-robots could be used to slow the ageing process, lengthening life expectancy.<br/>
🎧 As you can see, I'm very excited by the implications that could be available to us in the next few decades.<br/>
🎧 Just how long it'll take, I honestly don't know.<br/>
<br/><br/>
