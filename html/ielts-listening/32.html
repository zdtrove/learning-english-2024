🎧 <span>Thorndyke's<br/></span>
🎧 Good morning. Is that Mr <span>Thorndyke</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 How can I help?<br/>
🎧 I've got quite a few things which need <span>painting</span> and <span>fixing</span> in the <span>flat<br/></span>
🎧 and I <span>wonder</span> <span>whether</span> you'd be able to do the work.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure I'd be able to help but let me take down a few <span>details</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, of course.<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>firstly</span>, how did you hear about us?<br/>
🎧 It was my friend May <span>Hampton…<br/></span>
🎧 you did some <span>excellent</span> work for her a <span>couple</span> of years ago.<br/>
🎧 Do you remember?<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes, that was in <span>West</span> <span>Park</span> <span>Flats</span>, <span>lovely</span> <span>lady</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, she is.<br/>
🎧 And what's your name, please?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>Edith</span> <span>Pargetter</span>.<br/>
🎧 can you <span>spell</span> your <span>surname</span>, please?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>P-A-R-G-E-T-T-E-R</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Double</span> <span>T</span>, right.<br/>
🎧 And do you live in <span>West</span> <span>Park</span> <span>Flats</span> as well?<br/>
🎧 No, actually it's <span>East</span> <span>Park</span>, <span>Flat</span> <span>4</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, right, that's over the <span>road</span>, I <span>seem</span> to remember <span>-</span> quite <span>difficult</span> to get to.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's at the back of the <span>library</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, I know.<br/>
🎧 And what's your phone number?<br/>
🎧 <span>875934<br/></span>
🎧 but I'm out a great <span>deal</span> in the <span>afternoons</span> and <span>evenings</span>.<br/>
🎧 So would the best time to <span>ring</span> you be in the morning?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Fine. I've made a <span>note</span> of that.<br/>
🎧 Can I just ask, I'll be in a <span>van</span> and I know <span>parking's</span> rather <span>difficult</span> <span>round</span> your <span>flats</span>.<br/>
🎧 Where would you <span>recommend</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I always tell people in <span>larger</span> <span>vehicles</span> to <span>park</span> by the <span>postbox</span> on the other side of the <span>road</span> from the <span>entrance</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good, thanks.<br/>
🎧 And will you be able to give me a full <span>itemised</span> <span>quote</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes, I'll <span>list</span> all the <span>jobs</span> <span>separately</span> with <span>individual</span> <span>prices</span>.<br/>
🎧 That'd be a great help.<br/>
🎧 No <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, what would you like me to do?<br/>
🎧 <span>Firstly</span> and most <span>urgently</span> is in the <span>kitchen</span>.<br/>
🎧 With all the <span>weather</span> <span>damage</span>, the <span>glass</span> in the <span>door</span> has <span>cracked</span> and I'd need that <span>fixing…<br/></span>
🎧 I <span>presume</span> you mean <span>replacing</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes. And as soon as <span>possible…<br/></span>
🎧 What I'll do is come <span>round</span> <span>tomorrow</span> morning and do that <span>immediately</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, thank you so much.<br/>
🎧 The other things aren't so <span>urgent</span> <span>but…<br/></span>
🎧 Now, I'll make a <span>note</span> of everything you want doing.<br/>
🎧 Well, in the <span>kitchen</span> I'd like some <span>painting</span> doing.<br/>
🎧 All the <span>kitchen</span> <span>walls</span>?<br/>
🎧 Just the <span>area</span> over the <span>cooker</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's very <span>greasy…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Right…</span> it does <span>tend</span> to get that way!<br/>
🎧 Yes!<br/>
🎧 Well, if you want a <span>proper</span> <span>job</span> done what I'd need to do is <span>strip</span> the old <span>paint</span> and <span>plaster</span> it about a week before I <span>paint</span> it.<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 Now, May tells me you also do work in the garden.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'd like you to <span>replace</span> a <span>fence</span>.<br/>
🎧 Just one?<br/>
🎧 Yes, at the <span>far</span> end.<br/>
🎧 Fine. Shouldn't be a <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 And that's the lot.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, as I say I can come <span>round</span> <span>tomorrow</span> morning to look over things with you.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's great, thank you.<br/>
🎧 So, I'll look forward to <span>seeing</span> you <span>tomorrow</span> <span>at…<br/>
</span> <span><br/>

🎧 <span>Welcome</span> to <span>Manham</span> <span>Port</span>, where a <span>thousand</span> years of <span>history</span> are <span>brought</span> to life.<br/>
🎧 All the <span>family</span> can enjoy a day out at <span>Manham:<br/></span>
🎧 visit our <span>copper</span> <span>mine</span>, see <span>models</span> of the <span>machinery</span> it used,<br/>
🎧 have your <span>photo</span> taken in <span>nineteenth</span> <span>century</span> <span>costume</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>experience</span> at first <span>hand</span> how people <span>lived</span> at different <span>stages</span> <span>throughout</span> <span>history</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>especially</span> how children <span>studied</span>, <span>worked</span> and <span>played</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>port</span> of <span>Manham</span> is <span>located</span> in <span>beautiful</span> and <span>peaceful</span> <span>countryside</span>,<br/>
🎧 on a <span>bend</span> in the great <span>River</span> <span>Avon</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>developed</span> here because it's the <span>highest</span> <span>navigable</span> <span>point</span> of the <span>Avon</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>boats</span> can go no <span>higher</span> up this <span>river</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>proved</span> a <span>handy</span> place to <span>load</span> and <span>unload</span> <span>cargo</span> to and from the sea,<br/>
🎧 which is over <span>23</span> <span>miles</span> away.<br/>
🎧 A small <span>port</span> was already <span>established</span> here when, about <span>900</span> years ago, <span>tin</span> was <span>discovered</span> <span>nearby</span>,<br/>
🎧 though it wasn't until the <span>Industrial</span> <span>Revolution</span>, when a <span>tremendous</span> need for <span>metals</span> of all <span>kinds</span> <span>developed</span>,<br/>
🎧 that <span>Manham</span> <span>expanded</span> to become one of the <span>busiest</span> <span>ports</span> in the <span>country</span>.<br/>
🎧 And because it was already so <span>busy</span>, <span>prospectors</span> <span>began</span> to look for other <span>minerals</span>,<br/>
🎧 and by the end of the <span>nineteenth</span> <span>century</span>, <span>lead</span>, <span>copper</span>, <span>manganese</span> and <span>arsenic</span> were <span>added</span> to the <span>cargos</span> <span>leaving</span> <span>Manham</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>early</span> <span>days</span>, the <span>ores</span> had been <span>smelted</span> <span>-</span> or <span>processed</span> <span>-</span> in the same <span>area</span> they were <span>mined</span>.<br/>
🎧 But, as <span>demand</span> <span>grew</span>, the <span>smelting</span> <span>process</span> <span>required</span> <span>huge</span> <span>factory</span> <span>furnaces</span> or <span>fires</span> to <span>melt</span> the <span>metal</span> from the <span>rock<br/></span>
🎧 and there was not enough <span>coal</span> in the <span>local</span> <span>area</span>, so the <span>rocks</span> <span>containing</span> <span>minerals</span> had to be <span>shipped</span> long <span>distances</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sadly</span>, in the <span>twentieth</span> <span>century</span>, the great <span>port</span> of <span>Manham</span> <span>declined</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>thousands</span> of <span>workers</span> were <span>forced</span> to <span>emigrate</span> out of the <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>building</span> at the <span>port</span> <span>fell</span> into <span>disrepair</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the place <span>became</span> almost <span>forgotten</span>.<br/>
🎧 But then, the <span>Manham</span> <span>Trust</span> was <span>formed</span> to <span>conserve</span> the <span>historical</span> <span>resources</span> of the <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>organised</span> <span>scores</span> of <span>local</span> <span>volunteers</span> to <span>remove</span> <span>undergrowth</span> to find the <span>original</span> <span>outlines</span> of the <span>installations</span>.<br/>
🎧 It then <span>brought</span> in <span>paid</span> <span>professionals</span> to <span>match</span> <span>installations</span> with <span>maps</span> of the <span>original</span> <span>port</span> <span>complex<br/></span>
🎧 and to set about <span>reconstructing</span> it.<br/>
🎧 Today you can see the <span>results</span> of this <span>ambitious</span> <span>programme</span> of <span>restoration</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>intention</span>, and we <span>believe</span> this will be <span>realised</span> before the end of the year,<br/>
🎧 is to <span>return</span> <span>Manham</span> <span>Port</span> to the <span>condition</span> it <span>reached</span> at its <span>peak</span> as <span>'the</span> <span>greatest</span> <span>copper</span> <span>port</span> in the <span>country'</span>.<br/>
🎧 But what can you do and see on your visit today?<br/>
🎧 Here are just a few <span>highlights</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>suggest</span> you start with the visit to the <span>copper</span> <span>mine</span>.<br/>
🎧 Travel on <span>converted</span> <span>mining</span> <span>trains</span> and <span>journey</span> into the <span>depths</span> of the <span>mountain</span> along <span>seams</span> once <span>worked</span> by <span>hundreds</span> of <span>miners</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Watch</span> out <span>especially</span> for the great <span>pumping</span> <span>machines</span> which rid the <span>mine</span> of water.<br/>
🎧 But please be <span>warned</span> that, like all <span>mines</span>, <span>ours</span> is very <span>dark</span> and <span>closed</span> <span>in<br/></span>
🎧 and we do say that children under <span>five</span> and also <span>dogs</span> should NOT be taken into the <span>mine</span>.<br/>
🎧 The next <span>recommended</span> visit is to the <span>village</span> school.<br/>
🎧 While looking <span>round</span> the <span>classrooms</span>, take a special look at our <span>display</span> of <span>games</span>, which is one of the <span>largest</span> in the <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 And it's <span>recommended</span> that you time your visit to <span>coincide</span> with a <span>guided</span> <span>tour</span>.<br/>
🎧 This will give you the <span>opportunity</span> to ask lots of <span>questions</span>.<br/>
🎧 Near the school is the <span>beautiful</span> old <span>sailing</span> <span>ketch</span> called <span>'The</span> <span>George'</span>.<br/>
🎧 You are <span>welcome</span> to <span>board</span> the <span>boat</span> and look <span>round</span> the <span>cabins</span>.<br/>
🎧 Look out for the <span>ship's</span> <span>wheel</span> which was <span>missing</span> until only <span>five</span> years <span>ago<br/></span>
🎧 when it was <span>dredged</span> out of the <span>silt</span> by a <span>local</span> <span>fisherman</span>.<br/>
🎧 We have no idea how it got <span>there<br/></span>
🎧 but it's been <span>polished</span> and <span>proudly</span> <span>restored</span> to its <span>original</span> place on the <span>boat</span>.<br/>
🎧 Please take <span>care</span> going down the <span>ladders</span> if you wish to visit the <span>lower</span> <span>deck</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 we don't <span>recommend</span> you <span>allow</span> young children to use them.<br/>
🎧 So we hope you have a <span>memorable</span> visit to <span>Manham</span> <span>Port<br/></span>
🎧 and will tell your friends all about us.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Hi, <span>Laura</span> <span>-</span> could you <span>spare</span> a few <span>minutes</span> to talk about the work <span>placement</span> you did last <span>summer</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm thinking of doing one <span>myself…<br/></span>
🎧 Hi, <span>Tim</span>. Sure.<br/>
🎧 Didn't you do <span>yours</span> at an <span>environmental</span> <span>services</span> company?<br/>
🎧 That's <span>right…<br/></span>
🎧 It's only a very small <span>company<br/></span>
🎧 and they <span>needed</span> <span>someone</span> to <span>produce</span> a company <span>brochure</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I wanted to get some <span>business</span> <span>experience<br/></span>
🎧 because I'm interested in a <span>career</span> in <span>occupational</span> <span>psychology</span> in a <span>business</span> <span>environment</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was good because I had <span>overall</span> <span>responsibility</span> for the <span>project</span>.<br/>
🎧 What kind of <span>skills</span> do you think you <span>developed</span> on the <span>placement</span>?<br/>
🎧 I mean, <span>apart</span> from the <span>ones</span> you already <span>had…<br/></span>
🎧 Did you have to do all the <span>artwork</span> for the <span>brochure</span>, the <span>layout</span> and everything?<br/>
🎧 We <span>hired</span> the <span>services</span> of a <span>professional</span> <span>photographer</span> for that.<br/>
🎧 I did have to use my IT <span>skills</span> to a <span>certain</span> <span>extent<br/></span>
🎧 because I cut and <span>pasted</span> <span>text</span> from <span>marketing</span> <span>leaflets</span>,<br/>
🎧 but that didn't <span>involve</span> anything I hadn't done before.<br/>
🎧 Do you think you got any better at <span>managing</span> your time and <span>prioritizing</span> things?<br/>
🎧 You always used to say you had <span>trouble</span> with <span>that…<br/></span>
🎧 Oh, definitely.<br/>
🎧 There was so much <span>pressure</span> to meet the <span>project</span> <span>deadline</span>.<br/>
🎧 And I also got better at <span>explaining</span> things and <span>asserting</span> my <span>opinions</span>,<br/>
🎧 because I had to have <span>weekly</span> <span>consultations</span> with the <span>marketing</span> <span>manager</span> and give him a <span>progress</span> <span>report</span>.<br/>
🎧 It sounds as if you got a lot out of it then.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely.<br/>
🎧 It was really <span>worthwhile…<br/></span>
🎧 But you know, the company <span>benefited</span> <span>too…<br/></span>
🎧 Yes, they must have done.<br/>
🎧 After all, if they'd used a <span>professional</span> <span>advertising</span> <span>agency</span> to <span>produce</span> their <span>brochure</span> <span>instead</span> of doing it <span>in-house</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>presumably</span> they'd have <span>paid</span> a lot more?<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes.<br/>
🎧 I <span>worked</span> it out <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it would have been <span>250%</span> more.<br/>
🎧 And I thought the end <span>result</span> was good,<br/>
🎧 even though we did everything on <span>site</span>.<br/>
🎧 The company has quite a <span>powerful</span> <span>computer<br/></span>
🎧 and I <span>managed</span> to <span>borrow</span> some <span>scanning</span> <span>software</span> from the university.<br/>
🎧 The new <span>brochure</span> looks really <span>professional;<br/></span>
🎧 it <span>enhances</span> the <span>image</span> of the company <span>straight</span> away.<br/>
🎧 So in the long run it should help them to <span>attract</span> <span>clients</span>, and <span>improve</span> their <span>sales</span> <span>figures</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's the idea. Yeah.<br/>
🎧 Well, all in all it sounds very <span>positive</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 I think I will go <span>ahead</span> and <span>apply</span> for a <span>placement</span> myself.<br/>
🎧 How do I go about it?<br/>
🎧 It's easy enough to do,<br/>
🎧 because there's a <span>government</span> <span>agency</span> called <span>STEP<br/></span>
🎧 <span>-</span> <span>S-T-E-P<br/></span>
🎧 <span>-</span> that <span>organises</span> <span>placements</span> for students.<br/>
🎧 You should start by getting their <span>booklet</span> with all the <span>details</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 I <span>expect</span> you can <span>download</span> one from their <span>website</span>.<br/>
🎧 Actually, <span>they've</span> got <span>copies</span> in the <span>psychology</span> <span>department</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 I've <span>seen</span> them there.<br/>
🎧 I'll just go to the <span>office</span> and <span>pick</span> one up.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And then if I were you, after I'd <span>looked</span> at it I'd go over all the options with <span>someone…<br/></span>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> I should ask my <span>tutor's</span> advice.<br/>
🎧 He <span>knows</span> more about me than <span>anyone</span>.<br/>
🎧 One of the <span>career</span> <span>officers</span> would be better,<br/>
🎧 <span>they've</span> got more <span>knowledge</span> about the <span>jobs</span> <span>market</span> than your personal <span>tutor</span> would have.<br/>
🎧 <span>OK…<br/></span>
🎧 And then when you know what you want you can <span>register</span> with <span>STEP</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 you'll find their <span>address</span> in the <span>booklet</span>.<br/>
🎧 And once you've <span>registered</span> they <span>assign</span> you to a <span>mentor</span> who looks after your <span>application</span>.<br/>
🎧 And then I <span>suppose</span> you just sit back and wait <span>till</span> you hear something?<br/>
🎧 They told me at the <span>careers</span> <span>office</span> that it's best to be <span>proactive</span>, and get <span>updates</span> <span>yourself<br/></span>
🎧 by <span>checking</span> the <span>website</span> for new <span>placement</span> <span>alerts</span>.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>mentor</span> is <span>supposed</span> to keep you <span>informed</span>, but you can't <span>rely</span> on that.<br/>
🎧 I don't <span>suppose</span> it's a good idea to get in touch with <span>companies</span> <span>directly</span>, is it?<br/>
🎧 Not <span>really…<br/></span>
🎧 But it is the company who <span>notifies</span> you if they want you to go for an <span>interview</span>.<br/>
🎧 You get a <span>letter</span> of <span>invitation</span> or an <span>email</span> from <span>personnel</span> <span>departments</span>.<br/>
🎧 And do I <span>reply</span> <span>directly</span> to them?<br/>
🎧 Yes, you do.<br/>
🎧 <span>STEP</span> only <span>gets</span> <span>involved</span> again once you've been made a <span>job</span> <span>offer</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Right…<br/></span>
🎧 So, once you've had an <span>interview</span> you should let your <span>mentor</span> know what the <span>outcome</span> is?<br/>
🎧 I mean <span>whether</span> you're <span>offered</span> a <span>job</span>, and <span>whether</span> you've <span>decided</span> to <span>accept</span> it?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 They'll <span>inform</span> the <span>careers</span> <span>office</span> once a <span>placement</span> has been agreed,<br/>
🎧 so you don't have to do that.<br/>
🎧 Is that all then?<br/>
🎧 More or less.<br/>
🎧 Only once you've <span>accepted</span> an <span>offer</span> you'll probably have to <span>supply</span> a <span>reference</span>,<br/>
🎧 because the <span>placement</span> will be <span>conditional</span> on that.<br/>
🎧 And that's something you should ask your own <span>tutor</span> to <span>provide</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>knows</span> about your <span>academic</span> <span>ability</span> and also about your <span>qualities</span>, like <span>reliability</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, thanks very much for the <span>information</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 I'm <span>starting</span> to <span>look…<br/>
</span> <span><br/>

🎧 Today we're going to look at an important <span>area</span> of <span>science</span>, <span>namely</span> <span>nanotechnology</span>.<br/>
🎧 So what is it?<br/>
🎧 <span>Nano</span> <span>means</span> <span>tiny</span>,<br/>
🎧 so it's <span>science</span> and <span>engineering</span> on the <span>scale</span> of <span>atoms</span> and <span>molecules</span>.<br/>
🎧 The idea is that by <span>controlling</span> and <span>rearranging</span> <span>atoms</span>, you can <span>literally</span> <span>create</span> anything.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, as we'll see, the <span>science</span> of the small has some big <span>implications</span> <span>affecting</span> us in many <span>ways</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's no <span>doubt</span> that <span>nanotechnology</span> <span>promises</span> so much for <span>civilisation</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, all new <span>technologies</span> have their <span>teething</span> <span>problems</span>.<br/>
🎧 And with <span>nanotechnology</span>, <span>society</span> often <span>gets</span> the wrong idea about its <span>capabilities</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Numerous</span> <span>science-fiction</span> books and <span>movies</span> have <span>raised</span> <span>people's</span> <span>fears</span> about <span>nanotechnology</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 with <span>scenarios</span> such as <span>inserting</span> little <span>nano-robots</span> into your <span>body</span> that <span>monitor</span> everything you do without you <span>realising</span> it,<br/>
🎧 or <span>self-replicating</span> <span>nano-robots</span> that <span>eventually</span> take over the <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 So how do we <span>safeguard</span> such a <span>potentially</span> <span>powerful</span> <span>technology</span>?<br/>
🎧 Some <span>scientists</span> <span>recommend</span> that <span>nano-particles</span> be <span>treated</span> as new <span>chemicals</span> with <span>separate</span> <span>safety</span> <span>tests</span> and <span>clear</span> <span>labelling</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>believe</span> that <span>greater</span> <span>care</span> should also be taken with <span>nano-particles</span> in <span>laboratories</span> and <span>factories</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Others</span> have called for a <span>withdrawal</span> of new <span>nano</span> <span>products</span> such as <span>cosmetics<br/></span>
🎧 and a <span>temporary</span> <span>halt</span> to many <span>kinds</span> of <span>nanotech</span> <span>research</span>.<br/>
🎧 But as <span>far</span> as I'm <span>concerned</span> there's a need to <span>plough</span> <span>ahead</span> with the <span>discoveries</span> and <span>applications</span> of <span>nanotechnology</span>.<br/>
🎧 I really <span>believe</span> that most <span>scientists</span> would <span>welcome</span> a way to <span>guard</span> <span>against</span> <span>unethical</span> <span>uses</span> of such <span>technology</span>.<br/>
🎧 We can't go around thinking that all <span>innovation</span> is bad, all <span>advancement</span> is bad.<br/>
🎧 As with the <span>debate</span> about any new <span>technology</span>, it is how you use it that's important.<br/>
🎧 So let's look at some of its <span>possible</span> <span>uses</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks to <span>nanotechnology</span>, there could be a <span>major</span> <span>breakthrough</span> in the <span>field</span> of <span>transportation<br/></span>
🎧 with the <span>production</span> of more <span>durable</span> <span>metals</span>.<br/>
🎧 These could be <span>virtually</span> <span>unbreakable</span>, <span>lighter</span> and much more <span>pliable<br/></span>
🎧 <span>leading</span> to <span>planes</span> that are <span>50</span> <span>times</span> <span>lighter</span> than at <span>present</span>.<br/>
🎧 Those same <span>improved</span> <span>capabilities</span> will <span>dramatically</span> <span>reduce</span> the <span>cost</span> of <span>travelling</span> into <span>space<br/></span>
🎧 <span>making</span> it more <span>accessible</span> to <span>ordinary</span> people and <span>opening</span> up a <span>totally</span> new <span>holiday</span> <span>destination</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>terms</span> of <span>technology</span>, the <span>computer</span> <span>industry</span> will be able to <span>shrink</span> <span>computer</span> <span>parts</span> down to <span>minute</span> <span>sizes</span>.<br/>
🎧 We need <span>nanotechnology</span> in order to <span>create</span> a new <span>generation</span> of <span>computers<br/></span>
🎧 that will work even <span>faster</span> and will have a <span>million</span> <span>times</span> more <span>memory<br/></span>
🎧 but will be about the size of a <span>sugar</span> <span>cube</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Nanotechnology</span> could also <span>revolutionise</span> the way that we <span>generate</span> <span>power</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>cost</span> of <span>solar</span> <span>cells</span> will be <span>drastically</span> <span>reduced<br/></span>
🎧 so <span>harnessing</span> this <span>energy</span> will be <span>far</span> more <span>economical</span> than at <span>present</span>.<br/>
🎧 But <span>nanotechnology</span> has much <span>wider</span> <span>applications</span> than <span>this<br/></span>
🎧 and could have an <span>enormous</span> <span>impact</span> on our <span>environment</span>.<br/>
🎧 For <span>instance</span>, <span>tiny</span> <span>airborne</span> <span>nano-robots</span> could be <span>programmed</span> to actually <span>rebuild</span> the <span>ozone</span> <span>layer</span>,<br/>
🎧 which could <span>lessen</span> the <span>impact</span> of <span>global</span> <span>warming</span> on our <span>planet</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's a <span>pretty</span> amazing thought, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 On a more <span>local</span> <span>scale</span>,<br/>
🎧 this new <span>technology</span> could help with the <span>clean-up</span> of <span>environmental</span> <span>disasters<br/></span>
🎧 as <span>nanotechnology</span> will <span>allow</span> us to <span>remove</span> oil and other <span>contaminants</span> from the water <span>far</span> more <span>effectively</span>.<br/>
🎧 And, if <span>nanotechnology</span> <span>progresses</span> as <span>expected</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 as a <span>sort</span> of <span>building</span> <span>block</span> set of about <span>90</span> <span>atoms</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 then you could <span>build</span> anything you wanted from the <span>bottom</span> up.<br/>
🎧 In <span>terms</span> of <span>production</span>, this <span>means</span> that you only use what you <span>need<br/></span>
🎧 and so there wouldn't be any <span>waste</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>notion</span> that you could <span>create</span> anything at all has <span>major</span> <span>implications</span> for our <span>health</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>means</span> that we'll <span>eventually</span> be able to <span>replicate</span> anything.<br/>
🎧 This would have a <span>phenomenal</span> <span>effect</span> on our <span>society</span>.<br/>
🎧 In time it could even <span>lead</span> to the <span>eradication</span> of <span>famine<br/></span>
🎧 through the <span>introduction</span> of <span>machines</span> that <span>produce</span> food to <span>feed</span> the <span>hungry</span>.<br/>
🎧 But it's in the <span>area</span> of <span>medicine</span> that <span>nanotechnology</span> may have its <span>biggest</span> <span>impact</span>.<br/>
🎧 How we <span>detect</span> <span>disease</span> will change as <span>tiny</span> <span>biosensors</span> are <span>developed</span> to <span>analyse</span> <span>tests</span> in <span>minutes</span> rather than <span>days</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's even <span>speculation</span> <span>nano-robots</span> could be used to <span>slow</span> the <span>ageing</span> <span>process</span>, <span>lengthening</span> life <span>expectancy</span>.<br/>
🎧 As you can see, I'm very <span>excited</span> by the <span>implications</span> that could be <span>available</span> to us in the next few <span>decades</span>.<br/>
🎧 Just how long it'll take, I <span>honestly</span> don't know.<br/>
