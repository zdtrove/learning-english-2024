🎧 Good morning, oh sorry, it's gone 12, I'll start again,<br/>
🎧 good afternoon, Kingswell Sports Club, how can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Oh, good afternoon.<br/>
🎧 I was wondering if you could give me some information about membership and facilities.<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 What would you like to know?<br/>
🎧 Do you have tennis courts, for example?<br/>
🎧 No, I'm afraid we don't.<br/>
🎧 We're primarily a golf club.<br/>
🎧 What about football?<br/>
🎧 I heard you had a team.<br/>
🎧 No, I'm sorry.<br/>
🎧 Perhaps you're thinking about Fresham Sports Centre.<br/>
🎧 Oh, right.<br/>
🎧 I know it.<br/>
🎧 I've played badminton there.<br/>
🎧 Have you?<br/>
🎧 They've got a lot of facilities we don't have and vice versa.<br/>
🎧 We do have a keep-fit studio, which is very popular with members,<br/>
🎧 and then as well as that there's swimming, of course.<br/>
🎧 That's good. I like to swim every day.<br/>
🎧 We have a range of classes too.<br/>
🎧 Do you have judo classes?<br/>
🎧 I'm keen to learn.<br/>
🎧 Well, at the moment, we offer kick-boxing.<br/>
🎧 We're planning to add judo and stretch classes soon.<br/>
🎧 We're currently running a range of yoga classes, too.<br/>
🎧 What about relaxing after exercise?<br/>
🎧 I assume you have a restaurant or something.<br/>
🎧 At the moment, we've got a salad bar which is very popular.<br/>
🎧 We'll also have a fully-licensed restaurant by the end of the year.<br/>
🎧 Sounds good!<br/>
🎧 What kind of membership are you interested in?<br/>
🎧 Um... I'm not really sure.<br/>
🎧 What are the options?<br/>
🎧 Well, there are three different membership schemes.<br/>
🎧 I see. What's the difference?<br/>
🎧 Well, the first one's called Gold,<br/>
🎧 and you can use all the facilities at any time of the day or week.<br/>
🎧 You can also join in as many classes as you like for free.<br/>
🎧 That sounds good.<br/>
🎧 Is it very expensive?<br/>
🎧 Well, you pay a £250 joining fee<br/>
🎧 and then it's 450 - oh no, I'm sorry,<br/>
🎧 it's just gone up by £50, sorry about that -<br/>
🎧 it's now £500 for the annual subscription fee.<br/>
🎧 Right, got that.<br/>
🎧 And what's the next type?<br/>
🎧 Well, that's Silver -<br/>
🎧 it's the same as Gold except you have to pay a small fee of £1.00 per lesson for any you do<br/>
🎧 and you can only use the centre at certain times.<br/>
🎧 I see. So when exactly?<br/>
🎧 You can only use the facilities between 10 am and 4.30 pm.<br/>
🎧 So I couldn't use the pool at 8 in the morning or evening, then?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 Okay. And the price for that?<br/>
🎧 Is the joining fee the same as for Gold?<br/>
🎧 Actually, it's slightly less than the £250 -<br/>
🎧 it's £225,<br/>
🎧 but the annual fee is only £300.<br/>
🎧 Does that sound more like what you want?<br/>
🎧 Well, it's still rather more expensive than I thought.<br/>
🎧 I'm a student here in England and I'm only here for six months.<br/>
🎧 Ah, then the Bronze scheme would probably suit you best.<br/>
🎧 How is that different?<br/>
🎧 Well, some of the facilities have restricted use.<br/>
🎧 And do I have to pay for classes?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's £3 for each class you join.<br/>
🎧 I see. And what are the hours then?<br/>
🎧 Between 10.30 and 3.30 weekdays only<br/>
🎧 and you pay a £50 joining fee.<br/>
🎧 The annual fee is £180 -<br/>
🎧 it works out at £15 a month, so...<br/>
🎧 that would be quite a lot cheaper.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that should be all right.<br/>
🎧 I could come in my free periods.<br/>
🎧 What do I have to do if I want to join?<br/>
🎧 Well, we book you in for an assessment with an instructor,<br/>
🎧 who will show you how to use all the equipment.<br/>
🎧 If you want to organise a trial session and look around the centre,<br/>
🎧 you'll need to speak to David Kynchley.<br/>
🎧 Could you spell that please?<br/>
🎧 Yes, David KYNCHLEY.<br/>
🎧 I'll give you his direct line number.<br/>
🎧 It's 045895311.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Thank you for calling Kingswell Sports Club.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 And here on Radio Rivenden we have Lynne Rawley, the Public Relations Officer of our own Rivenden City Theatre.<br/>
🎧 Hello, Lynne.<br/>
🎧 Hello.<br/>
🎧 Now, the theatre is reopening soon after its three-year redevelopment programme, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 That's right, and there are a lot of improvements.<br/>
🎧 The first thing people will see when they go in<br/>
🎧 is that the foyer has been repainted in the original green and gold.<br/>
🎧 Then the box office has been reoriented, with its own access from the side of the building instead of through the foyer,<br/>
🎧 which means it can be open longer hours, and has more space, too.<br/>
🎧 The shop that used to be in the foyer, which sold books and CDs,<br/>
🎧 is the one part of the redevelopment which isn't yet complete.<br/>
🎧 The plan is to find new premises for it near the theatre,<br/>
🎧 and we've had difficulty finding somewhere suitable.<br/>
🎧 We hope to reopen the shop in the next few months.<br/>
🎧 Will audiences find any difference in the auditorium?<br/>
🎧 Yes, we've increased the leg-room between the rows.<br/>
🎧 This means that there are now fewer seats<br/>
🎧 but we're sure audiences will be much happier.<br/>
🎧 And we've installed air conditioning, so it won't get so hot and stuffy.<br/>
🎧 We already had a few seats which were suitable for wheelchair users,<br/>
🎧 and now there are twice as many, which we hope will meet demand.<br/>
🎧 Something else that will benefit audiences is the new lifts.<br/>
🎧 The two we used to have were very small and slow.<br/>
🎧 They've now gone, and we've got much more efficient ones.<br/>
🎧 Anything for the performers?<br/>
🎧 Yes, we've made a number of improvements backstage.<br/>
🎧 The small, dark dressing rooms we used to have have been converted into two large airy rooms,<br/>
🎧 so they're much more comfortable now.<br/>
🎧 And the state-of-the-art electronic sound and lighting systems have been installed.<br/>
🎧 Okay, so what's the first play that audiences can see when the theatre reopens?<br/>
🎧 We've got a very exciting production of Peter Shaffer's Royal Hunt of the Sun, which is currently touring the country.<br/>
🎧 That starts on October the 13th and runs till the 19th.<br/>
🎧 We're experimenting a bit with the time the curtain goes up.<br/>
🎧 We used to start all our performances at 7.30,<br/>
🎧 but that made it difficult for people to go home by public transport,<br/>
🎧 so instead, we're beginning at 7,<br/>
🎧 because at 9.45, when it finishes, there are still buses running.<br/>
🎧 Tickets are already selling fast.<br/>
🎧 The Friday and Saturday performances sold out almost immediately<br/>
🎧 and, in fact, now there are only tickets for Monday and Thursday.<br/>
🎧 How much are they?<br/>
🎧 We've introduced a simpler price structure.<br/>
🎧 Ticket prices used to range from £6 to £30<br/>
🎧 but now they're all £18.<br/>
🎧 They're available from the box office, in person, by phone, fax or post, or online.<br/>
🎧 Okay, Lynne, now if you'd like to give the contact details...<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Hi, can I help you?<br/>
🎧 I was told to come here, because I'd like to talk to someone about taking a management course.<br/>
🎧 Right. I'm one of the tutors, so I should be able to help you.<br/>
🎧 Oh, good.<br/>
🎧 My name's Brian Ardley.<br/>
🎧 I've decided to enroll on a part time management course.<br/>
🎧 A friend of mine took one last year, and recommended it to me.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Is there anything I should do before the course, like reading or anything?<br/>
🎧 We prefer to integrate reading with the course,<br/>
🎧 so we don't give out a reading list in advance.<br/>
🎧 But we like people to write a case study, describing an organisation they know.<br/>
🎧 I've already done that, as my friends told me you wanted one.<br/>
🎧 But would it be possible to sit in on a teaching session, to see what it's like?<br/>
🎧 I haven't been a student for quite a while.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 Just let me know which date, and I'll arrange it with the tutor.<br/>
🎧 Now, could I ask you about the college facilities, please?<br/>
🎧 Anything in particular?<br/>
🎧 Well, the course is one day a week, all day, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 So presumably it's possible to buy food?<br/>
🎧 Yes, the refectory's open all day.<br/>
🎧 Does it cater for special diets? I have some food allergies.<br/>
🎧 Provided you warn the refectory in advance, it won't be a problem.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 What about facilities for young children?<br/>
🎧 I'd like to bring my daughter here while I'm studying.<br/>
🎧 How old is she?<br/>
🎧 Three.<br/>
🎧 Then she's eligible to join the nursery,<br/>
🎧 which is supervised by a qualified Nursery Nurse.<br/>
🎧 The waiting list for a place is quite long though, so you ought to apply now.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 I don't know if our careers advice service would be of any interest to you?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it might help me decide how to develop my career after the course.<br/>
🎧 The centre has a lot of reference materials, and staff qualified to give guidance on a one-to-one basis.<br/>
🎧 I noticed a fitness centre next to the college.<br/>
🎧 Is that for students?<br/>
🎧 It's open to everyone, but students pay an annual fee that's much less than the general public pay.<br/>
🎧 And presumably the college library stocks newspapers and journals, as well as books?<br/>
🎧 Yes, and there's also an audio-visual room, for viewing and listening to videos, cassettes, and so on.<br/>
🎧 Is there also access to computers?<br/>
🎧 Yes, your tutor will need to arrange with the technical support team for you to get a password,<br/>
🎧 so ask him or her about it when you start the course.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 By the way, do you know about our Business Centre?<br/>
🎧 No, What's that?<br/>
🎧 It's a training resource - a collection of materials for people to study on their own, or use in their own organisations.<br/>
🎧 You mean books and videos?<br/>
🎧 Yes, and manuals for self-study.<br/>
🎧 Plus a lot of computer-based materials, so people can work through them at their own speed,<br/>
🎧 and repeat anything they aren't sure about.<br/>
🎧 And you can hire laptops to use in your own home or workplace<br/>
🎧 as well as printers that you can take away.<br/>
🎧 Does it have anything that I could use to improve my study skills?<br/>
🎧 I don't have much idea about report writing,<br/>
🎧 and I'm sure I'll need it on the course.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, there's plenty of useful material. Just ask one of the staff.<br/>
🎧 Does the centre cover all the main areas of business?<br/>
🎧 Yes, topics like finance, and of course marketing - that's a popular one.<br/>
🎧 Local managers seem to queue up to borrow the videos!<br/>
🎧 So it isn't just for students, then?<br/>
🎧 No, it's for members only, but anyone can join.<br/>
🎧 How much does it cost?<br/>
🎧 £100 a year for a company,<br/>
🎧 and £50 for an individual, with no discount for students, I'm afraid.<br/>
🎧 That's very helpful.<br/>
🎧 Well, I think that's all.<br/>
🎧 I'd better go home and fill in the enrollment form.<br/>
🎧 Thanks for all your help.<br/>
🎧 You're welcome.<br/>
🎧 Goodbye.<br/>
🎧 Goodbye.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 In the last few weeks, we've been looking at various aspects of the social history of London,<br/>
🎧 and this morning we're continuing with a look at life in the area called the East End.<br/>
🎧 I'll start with a brief history of the district,<br/>
🎧 and then focus on life in the first half of the twentieth century.<br/>
🎧 Back in the first to the fourth centuries AD,<br/>
🎧 when the Romans controlled England,<br/>
🎧 London grew into a town of 45,000 people,<br/>
🎧 and what's now the East End -<br/>
🎧 the area by the river Thames, and along the road heading north-east from London to the coast -<br/>
🎧 consisted of farmland with crops and livestock<br/>
🎧 which helped to feed that population.<br/>
🎧 The Romans left in 410, at the beginning of the fifth century,<br/>
🎧 and from then onwards, the country suffered a series of invasions by tribes from present-day Germany and Denmark,<br/>
🎧 the Angles, Saxons and Jutes, many of whom settled in the East End.<br/>
🎧 The technology they introduced meant that metal and leather goods were produced there for the first time.<br/>
🎧 And as the East End was by the river,<br/>
🎧 ships could transport goods between there and foreign markets.<br/>
🎧 In the 11th century, in 1066 to be precise,<br/>
🎧 the Normans conquered England,<br/>
🎧 and during the next few centuries London became one of the most powerful and prosperous cities in Europe.<br/>
🎧 The East End benefited from this,<br/>
🎧 and because there were fewer restrictions there than in the city itself,<br/>
🎧 plenty of newcomers settled there from abroad,<br/>
🎧 bringing their skills as workers, merchants or money-lenders during the next few hundred years.<br/>
🎧 In the 16th century, the first dock was dug<br/>
🎧 where ships were constructed, eventually making the East End the focus of massive international trade.<br/>
🎧 And in the late 16th century,<br/>
🎧 when much of the rest of England was suffering economically,<br/>
🎧 a lot of agricultural workers came to the East End to look for alternative work.<br/>
🎧 In the seventeenth century, the East End was still a series of separate, semi-rural settlements.<br/>
🎧 There was a shortage of accommodation,<br/>
🎧 so marshland was drained and built on to house the large numbers of people now living there.<br/>
🎧 By the 19th century, London was the busiest port in the world,<br/>
🎧 and this became the main source of employment in the East End.<br/>
🎧 Those who could afford to live in more pleasant surroundings moved out,<br/>
🎧 and the area became one where the vast majority of people lived in extreme poverty,<br/>
🎧 and suffered from appalling sanitary conditions.<br/>
🎧 That brief outline takes us to the beginning of the 20th century,<br/>
🎧 and now we'll turn to housing.<br/>
🎧 At the beginning of the century,<br/>
🎧 living conditions for the majority of working people in East London were very basic indeed.<br/>
🎧 Houses were crowded closely together<br/>
🎧 and usually very badly built, because there was no regulation.<br/>
🎧 But the poor and needy were attracted by the possibility of work,<br/>
🎧 and they had to be housed.<br/>
🎧 It was the availability, rather than the condition, of the housing<br/>
🎧 that was the major concern for tenants and landlords alike.<br/>
🎧 Few houses had electricity at this time,<br/>
🎧 so other sources of power were used, like coal for the fires which heated perhaps just one room.<br/>
🎧 Of course, the smoke from these contributed a great deal to the air pollution<br/>
🎧 for which London used to be famous.<br/>
🎧 A tiny, damp, unhealthy house like this might well be occupied by two full families,<br/>
🎧 possibly including several children, grandparents, aunts and uncles.<br/>
🎧 Now, before I go on to health implications of this way of life,<br/>
🎧 I'll say something about food and nutrition.<br/>
<br/><br/>
