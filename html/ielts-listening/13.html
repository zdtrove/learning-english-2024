🎧 Good morning, oh sorry, it's <span>gone</span> <span>12</span>, I'll start again,<br/>
🎧 good <span>afternoon</span>, <span>Kingswell</span> <span>Sports</span> <span>Club</span>, how can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Oh, good <span>afternoon</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>wondering</span> if you could give me some <span>information</span> about <span>membership</span> and <span>facilities</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 What would you like to know?<br/>
🎧 Do you have <span>tennis</span> <span>courts</span>, for example?<br/>
🎧 No, I'm <span>afraid</span> we don't.<br/>
🎧 We're <span>primarily</span> a <span>golf</span> <span>club</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about <span>football</span>?<br/>
🎧 I heard you had a <span>team</span>.<br/>
🎧 No, I'm sorry.<br/>
🎧 <span>Perhaps</span> you're thinking about <span>Fresham</span> <span>Sports</span> <span>Centre</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, right.<br/>
🎧 I know it.<br/>
🎧 I've <span>played</span> <span>badminton</span> there.<br/>
🎧 Have you?<br/>
🎧 <span>They've</span> got a lot of <span>facilities</span> we don't have and <span>vice</span> <span>versa</span>.<br/>
🎧 We do have a <span>keep-fit</span> <span>studio</span>, which is very <span>popular</span> with <span>members</span>,<br/>
🎧 and then as well as that there's <span>swimming</span>, of course.<br/>
🎧 That's good. I like to <span>swim</span> every day.<br/>
🎧 We have a <span>range</span> of <span>classes</span> too.<br/>
🎧 Do you have <span>judo</span> <span>classes</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>keen</span> to learn.<br/>
🎧 Well, at the <span>moment</span>, we <span>offer</span> <span>kick-boxing</span>.<br/>
🎧 We're planning to add <span>judo</span> and <span>stretch</span> <span>classes</span> soon.<br/>
🎧 We're <span>currently</span> <span>running</span> a <span>range</span> of <span>yoga</span> <span>classes</span>, too.<br/>
🎧 What about <span>relaxing</span> after <span>exercise</span>?<br/>
🎧 I <span>assume</span> you have a <span>restaurant</span> or something.<br/>
🎧 At the <span>moment</span>, we've got a <span>salad</span> <span>bar</span> which is very <span>popular</span>.<br/>
🎧 We'll also have a <span>fully-licensed</span> <span>restaurant</span> by the end of the year.<br/>
🎧 Sounds good!<br/>
🎧 What kind of <span>membership</span> are you interested in?<br/>
🎧 <span>Um..</span>. I'm not really sure.<br/>
🎧 What are the options?<br/>
🎧 Well, there are <span>three</span> different <span>membership</span> <span>schemes</span>.<br/>
🎧 I see. What's the <span>difference</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, the first <span>one's</span> called <span>Gold</span>,<br/>
🎧 and you can use all the <span>facilities</span> at any time of the day or week.<br/>
🎧 You can also join in as many <span>classes</span> as you like for free.<br/>
🎧 That sounds good.<br/>
🎧 Is it very <span>expensive</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, you pay a <span>£250</span> <span>joining</span> <span>fee<br/></span>
🎧 and then it's <span>450</span> <span>-</span> oh no, I'm sorry,<br/>
🎧 it's just <span>gone</span> up by <span>£50</span>, sorry about that <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it's now <span>£500</span> for the <span>annual</span> <span>subscription</span> <span>fee</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, got that.<br/>
🎧 And what's the next <span>type</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, that's <span>Silver</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it's the same as <span>Gold</span> <span>except</span> you have to pay a small <span>fee</span> of <span>£1.00</span> <span>per</span> <span>lesson</span> for any you <span>do<br/></span>
🎧 and you can only use the <span>centre</span> at <span>certain</span> <span>times</span>.<br/>
🎧 I see. So when exactly?<br/>
🎧 You can only use the <span>facilities</span> between <span>10</span> am and <span>4.30</span> pm.<br/>
🎧 So I couldn't use the <span>pool</span> at <span>8</span> in the morning or <span>evening</span>, then?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 Okay. And the <span>price</span> for that?<br/>
🎧 Is the <span>joining</span> <span>fee</span> the same as for <span>Gold</span>?<br/>
🎧 Actually, it's <span>slightly</span> less than the <span>£250</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it's <span>£225</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>annual</span> <span>fee</span> is only <span>£300</span>.<br/>
🎧 Does that sound more like what you want?<br/>
🎧 Well, it's still rather more <span>expensive</span> than I thought.<br/>
🎧 I'm a student here in <span>England</span> and I'm only here for six <span>months</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ah, then the <span>Bronze</span> <span>scheme</span> would probably <span>suit</span> you best.<br/>
🎧 How is that different?<br/>
🎧 Well, some of the <span>facilities</span> have <span>restricted</span> use.<br/>
🎧 And do I have to pay for <span>classes</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's <span>£3</span> for each class you join.<br/>
🎧 I see. And what are the hours then?<br/>
🎧 Between <span>10.30</span> and <span>3.30</span> <span>weekdays</span> <span>only<br/></span>
🎧 and you pay a <span>£50</span> <span>joining</span> <span>fee</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>annual</span> <span>fee</span> is <span>£180</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it <span>works</span> out at <span>£15</span> a month, <span>so..</span>.<br/>
🎧 that would be quite a lot <span>cheaper</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that should be all right.<br/>
🎧 I could come in my free <span>periods</span>.<br/>
🎧 What do I have to do if I want to join?<br/>
🎧 Well, we book you in for an <span>assessment</span> with an <span>instructor</span>,<br/>
🎧 who will show you how to use all the <span>equipment</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you want to <span>organise</span> a <span>trial</span> <span>session</span> and look around the <span>centre</span>,<br/>
🎧 you'll need to speak to <span>David</span> <span>Kynchley</span>.<br/>
🎧 Could you <span>spell</span> that please?<br/>
🎧 Yes, <span>David</span> <span>KYNCHLEY</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll give you his <span>direct</span> <span>line</span> number.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>045895311</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Thank you for <span>calling</span> <span>Kingswell</span> <span>Sports</span> <span>Club</span>.<br/>

🎧 And here on <span>Radio</span> <span>Rivenden</span> we have <span>Lynne</span> <span>Rawley</span>, the <span>Public</span> <span>Relations</span> <span>Officer</span> of our own <span>Rivenden</span> <span>City</span> <span>Theatre</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hello, <span>Lynne</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hello.<br/>
🎧 Now, the <span>theatre</span> is <span>reopening</span> soon after its <span>three-year</span> <span>redevelopment</span> <span>programme</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 That's right, and there are a lot of <span>improvements</span>.<br/>
🎧 The first thing people will see when they go <span>in<br/></span>
🎧 is that the <span>foyer</span> has been <span>repainted</span> in the <span>original</span> <span>green</span> and <span>gold</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then the box <span>office</span> has been <span>reoriented</span>, with its own <span>access</span> from the side of the <span>building</span> <span>instead</span> of through the <span>foyer</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>means</span> it can be open <span>longer</span> hours, and has more <span>space</span>, too.<br/>
🎧 The <span>shop</span> that used to be in the <span>foyer</span>, which <span>sold</span> books and <span>CDs</span>,<br/>
🎧 is the one <span>part</span> of the <span>redevelopment</span> which isn't yet <span>complete</span>.<br/>
🎧 The plan is to find new <span>premises</span> for it near the <span>theatre</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we've had <span>difficulty</span> <span>finding</span> somewhere <span>suitable</span>.<br/>
🎧 We hope to <span>reopen</span> the <span>shop</span> in the next few <span>months</span>.<br/>
🎧 Will <span>audiences</span> find any <span>difference</span> in the <span>auditorium</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, we've <span>increased</span> the <span>leg-room</span> between the <span>rows</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>means</span> that there are now <span>fewer</span> <span>seats<br/></span>
🎧 but we're sure <span>audiences</span> will be much <span>happier</span>.<br/>
🎧 And we've <span>installed</span> air <span>conditioning</span>, so it won't get so hot and <span>stuffy</span>.<br/>
🎧 We already had a few <span>seats</span> which were <span>suitable</span> for <span>wheelchair</span> <span>users</span>,<br/>
🎧 and now there are <span>twice</span> as many, which we hope will meet <span>demand</span>.<br/>
🎧 Something else that will <span>benefit</span> <span>audiences</span> is the new <span>lifts</span>.<br/>
🎧 The two we used to have were very small and <span>slow</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>They've</span> now <span>gone</span>, and we've got much more <span>efficient</span> <span>ones</span>.<br/>
🎧 Anything for the <span>performers</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, we've made a number of <span>improvements</span> <span>backstage</span>.<br/>
🎧 The small, <span>dark</span> <span>dressing</span> <span>rooms</span> we used to have have been <span>converted</span> into two large <span>airy</span> <span>rooms</span>,<br/>
🎧 so they're much more <span>comfortable</span> now.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>state-of-the-art</span> <span>electronic</span> sound and <span>lighting</span> <span>systems</span> have been <span>installed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, so what's the first play that <span>audiences</span> can see when the <span>theatre</span> <span>reopens</span>?<br/>
🎧 We've got a very <span>exciting</span> <span>production</span> of <span>Peter</span> <span>Shaffer's</span> <span>Royal</span> <span>Hunt</span> of the Sun, which is <span>currently</span> <span>touring</span> the <span>country</span>.<br/>
🎧 That <span>starts</span> on <span>October</span> the <span>13th</span> and <span>runs</span> <span>till</span> the <span>19th</span>.<br/>
🎧 We're <span>experimenting</span> a bit with the time the <span>curtain</span> <span>goes</span> up.<br/>
🎧 We used to start all our <span>performances</span> at <span>7.30</span>,<br/>
🎧 but that made it <span>difficult</span> for people to go home by <span>public</span> <span>transport</span>,<br/>
🎧 so <span>instead</span>, we're <span>beginning</span> at <span>7</span>,<br/>
🎧 because at <span>9.45</span>, when it <span>finishes</span>, there are still <span>buses</span> <span>running</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Tickets</span> are already <span>selling</span> <span>fast</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Friday</span> and <span>Saturday</span> <span>performances</span> <span>sold</span> out almost <span>immediately<br/></span>
🎧 and, in <span>fact</span>, now there are only <span>tickets</span> for <span>Monday</span> and <span>Thursday</span>.<br/>
🎧 How much are they?<br/>
🎧 We've <span>introduced</span> a <span>simpler</span> <span>price</span> <span>structure</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ticket</span> <span>prices</span> used to <span>range</span> from <span>£6</span> to <span>£30<br/></span>
🎧 but now they're all <span>£18</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're <span>available</span> from the box <span>office</span>, in person, by phone, fax or <span>post</span>, or online.<br/>
🎧 Okay, <span>Lynne</span>, now if you'd like to give the <span>contact</span> <span>details..</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Hi, can I help you?<br/>
🎧 I was told to come here, because I'd like to talk to <span>someone</span> about taking a <span>management</span> course.<br/>
🎧 Right. I'm one of the <span>tutors</span>, so I should be able to help you.<br/>
🎧 Oh, good.<br/>
🎧 My <span>name's</span> <span>Brian</span> <span>Ardley</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've <span>decided</span> to <span>enroll</span> on a <span>part</span> time <span>management</span> course.<br/>
🎧 A friend of <span>mine</span> took one last year, and <span>recommended</span> it to me.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Is there anything I should do before the course, like <span>reading</span> or anything?<br/>
🎧 We <span>prefer</span> to <span>integrate</span> <span>reading</span> with the course,<br/>
🎧 so we don't give out a <span>reading</span> <span>list</span> in <span>advance</span>.<br/>
🎧 But we like people to <span>write</span> a case <span>study</span>, <span>describing</span> an <span>organisation</span> they know.<br/>
🎧 I've already done that, as my friends told me you wanted one.<br/>
🎧 But would it be <span>possible</span> to sit in on a <span>teaching</span> <span>session</span>, to see what it's like?<br/>
🎧 I haven't been a student for quite a while.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 Just let me know which date, and I'll <span>arrange</span> it with the <span>tutor</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, could I ask you about the <span>college</span> <span>facilities</span>, please?<br/>
🎧 Anything in <span>particular</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, the course is one day a week, all day, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 So <span>presumably</span> it's <span>possible</span> to buy food?<br/>
🎧 Yes, the <span>refectory's</span> open all day.<br/>
🎧 Does it <span>cater</span> for special <span>diets</span>? I have some food <span>allergies</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Provided</span> you <span>warn</span> the <span>refectory</span> in <span>advance</span>, it won't be a <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 What about <span>facilities</span> for young children?<br/>
🎧 I'd like to <span>bring</span> my <span>daughter</span> here while I'm <span>studying</span>.<br/>
🎧 How old is she?<br/>
🎧 <span>Three</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then she's <span>eligible</span> to join the <span>nursery</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is <span>supervised</span> by a <span>qualified</span> <span>Nursery</span> <span>Nurse</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>waiting</span> <span>list</span> for a place is quite long though, so you <span>ought</span> to <span>apply</span> now.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 I don't know if our <span>careers</span> advice <span>service</span> would be of any <span>interest</span> to you?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it might help me decide how to <span>develop</span> my <span>career</span> after the course.<br/>
🎧 The <span>centre</span> has a lot of <span>reference</span> <span>materials</span>, and <span>staff</span> <span>qualified</span> to give <span>guidance</span> on a <span>one-to-one</span> <span>basis</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>noticed</span> a <span>fitness</span> <span>centre</span> next to the <span>college</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is that for students?<br/>
🎧 It's open to everyone, but students pay an <span>annual</span> <span>fee</span> that's much less than the <span>general</span> <span>public</span> pay.<br/>
🎧 And <span>presumably</span> the <span>college</span> <span>library</span> <span>stocks</span> <span>newspapers</span> and <span>journals</span>, as well as books?<br/>
🎧 Yes, and there's also an <span>audio-visual</span> room, for <span>viewing</span> and <span>listening</span> to <span>videos</span>, <span>cassettes</span>, and so on.<br/>
🎧 Is there also <span>access</span> to <span>computers</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, your <span>tutor</span> will need to <span>arrange</span> with the <span>technical</span> <span>support</span> <span>team</span> for you to get a <span>password</span>,<br/>
🎧 so ask him or her about it when you start the course.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 By the way, do you know about our <span>Business</span> <span>Centre</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, What's that?<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>training</span> <span>resource</span> <span>-</span> a <span>collection</span> of <span>materials</span> for people to <span>study</span> on their own, or use in their own <span>organisations</span>.<br/>
🎧 You mean books and <span>videos</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, and <span>manuals</span> for <span>self-study</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Plus</span> a lot of <span>computer-based</span> <span>materials</span>, so people can work through them at their own <span>speed</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>repeat</span> anything they aren't sure about.<br/>
🎧 And you can <span>hire</span> <span>laptops</span> to use in your own home or <span>workplace<br/></span>
🎧 as well as <span>printers</span> that you can take away.<br/>
🎧 Does it have anything that I could use to <span>improve</span> my <span>study</span> <span>skills</span>?<br/>
🎧 I don't have much idea about <span>report</span> <span>writing</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I'm sure I'll need it on the course.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, there's <span>plenty</span> of <span>useful</span> <span>material</span>. Just ask one of the <span>staff</span>.<br/>
🎧 Does the <span>centre</span> <span>cover</span> all the <span>main</span> <span>areas</span> of <span>business</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, <span>topics</span> like <span>finance</span>, and of course <span>marketing</span> <span>-</span> that's a <span>popular</span> one.<br/>
🎧 <span>Local</span> <span>managers</span> <span>seem</span> to <span>queue</span> up to <span>borrow</span> the <span>videos</span>!<br/>
🎧 So it isn't just for students, then?<br/>
🎧 No, it's for <span>members</span> only, but <span>anyone</span> can join.<br/>
🎧 How much does it <span>cost</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>£100</span> a year for a company,<br/>
🎧 and <span>£50</span> for an <span>individual</span>, with no <span>discount</span> for students, I'm <span>afraid</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's very <span>helpful</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, I think that's all.<br/>
🎧 I'd better go home and <span>fill</span> in the <span>enrollment</span> <span>form</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks for all your help.<br/>
🎧 You're <span>welcome</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Goodbye</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Goodbye</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 In the last few <span>weeks</span>, we've been looking at <span>various</span> <span>aspects</span> of the <span>social</span> <span>history</span> of <span>London</span>,<br/>
🎧 and this morning we're <span>continuing</span> with a look at life in the <span>area</span> called the <span>East</span> End.<br/>
🎧 I'll start with a <span>brief</span> <span>history</span> of the <span>district</span>,<br/>
🎧 and then focus on life in the first <span>half</span> of the <span>twentieth</span> <span>century</span>.<br/>
🎧 Back in the first to the <span>fourth</span> <span>centuries</span> <span>AD</span>,<br/>
🎧 when the <span>Romans</span> <span>controlled</span> <span>England</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>London</span> <span>grew</span> into a <span>town</span> of <span>45,000</span> people,<br/>
🎧 and what's now the <span>East</span> End <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>area</span> by the <span>river</span> <span>Thames</span>, and along the <span>road</span> <span>heading</span> <span>north-east</span> from <span>London</span> to the <span>coast</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>consisted</span> of <span>farmland</span> with <span>crops</span> and <span>livestock<br/></span>
🎧 which <span>helped</span> to <span>feed</span> that <span>population</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Romans</span> <span>left</span> in <span>410</span>, at the <span>beginning</span> of the <span>fifth</span> <span>century</span>,<br/>
🎧 and from then <span>onwards</span>, the <span>country</span> <span>suffered</span> a <span>series</span> of <span>invasions</span> by <span>tribes</span> from <span>present-day</span> <span>Germany</span> and <span>Denmark</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>Angles</span>, <span>Saxons</span> and <span>Jutes</span>, many of whom <span>settled</span> in the <span>East</span> End.<br/>
🎧 The <span>technology</span> they <span>introduced</span> <span>meant</span> that <span>metal</span> and <span>leather</span> <span>goods</span> were <span>produced</span> there for the first time.<br/>
🎧 And as the <span>East</span> End was by the <span>river</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>ships</span> could <span>transport</span> <span>goods</span> between there and <span>foreign</span> <span>markets</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>11th</span> <span>century</span>, in <span>1066</span> to be <span>precise</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>Normans</span> <span>conquered</span> <span>England</span>,<br/>
🎧 and during the next few <span>centuries</span> <span>London</span> <span>became</span> one of the most <span>powerful</span> and <span>prosperous</span> <span>cities</span> in <span>Europe</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>East</span> End <span>benefited</span> from this,<br/>
🎧 and because there were <span>fewer</span> <span>restrictions</span> there than in the <span>city</span> <span>itself</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>plenty</span> of <span>newcomers</span> <span>settled</span> there from <span>abroad</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>bringing</span> their <span>skills</span> as <span>workers</span>, <span>merchants</span> or <span>money-lenders</span> during the next few <span>hundred</span> years.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>16th</span> <span>century</span>, the first <span>dock</span> was <span>dug<br/></span>
🎧 where <span>ships</span> were <span>constructed</span>, <span>eventually</span> <span>making</span> the <span>East</span> End the focus of <span>massive</span> <span>international</span> <span>trade</span>.<br/>
🎧 And in the <span>late</span> <span>16th</span> <span>century</span>,<br/>
🎧 when much of the <span>rest</span> of <span>England</span> was <span>suffering</span> <span>economically</span>,<br/>
🎧 a lot of <span>agricultural</span> <span>workers</span> came to the <span>East</span> End to look for <span>alternative</span> work.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>seventeenth</span> <span>century</span>, the <span>East</span> End was still a <span>series</span> of <span>separate</span>, <span>semi-rural</span> <span>settlements</span>.<br/>
🎧 There was a <span>shortage</span> of <span>accommodation</span>,<br/>
🎧 so <span>marshland</span> was <span>drained</span> and <span>built</span> on to house the large <span>numbers</span> of people now living there.<br/>
🎧 By the <span>19th</span> <span>century</span>, <span>London</span> was the <span>busiest</span> <span>port</span> in the <span>world</span>,<br/>
🎧 and this <span>became</span> the <span>main</span> <span>source</span> of <span>employment</span> in the <span>East</span> End.<br/>
🎧 Those who could <span>afford</span> to live in more <span>pleasant</span> <span>surroundings</span> <span>moved</span> out,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>area</span> <span>became</span> one where the <span>vast</span> <span>majority</span> of people <span>lived</span> in <span>extreme</span> <span>poverty</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>suffered</span> from <span>appalling</span> <span>sanitary</span> <span>conditions</span>.<br/>
🎧 That <span>brief</span> <span>outline</span> takes us to the <span>beginning</span> of the <span>20th</span> <span>century</span>,<br/>
🎧 and now we'll <span>turn</span> to <span>housing</span>.<br/>
🎧 At the <span>beginning</span> of the <span>century</span>,<br/>
🎧 living <span>conditions</span> for the <span>majority</span> of working people in <span>East</span> <span>London</span> were very <span>basic</span> <span>indeed</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Houses</span> were <span>crowded</span> <span>closely</span> <span>together<br/></span>
🎧 and usually very <span>badly</span> <span>built</span>, because there was no <span>regulation</span>.<br/>
🎧 But the <span>poor</span> and <span>needy</span> were <span>attracted</span> by the <span>possibility</span> of work,<br/>
🎧 and they had to be <span>housed</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was the <span>availability</span>, rather than the <span>condition</span>, of the <span>housing<br/></span>
🎧 that was the <span>major</span> <span>concern</span> for <span>tenants</span> and <span>landlords</span> <span>alike</span>.<br/>
🎧 Few <span>houses</span> had <span>electricity</span> at this time,<br/>
🎧 so other <span>sources</span> of <span>power</span> were used, like <span>coal</span> for the <span>fires</span> which <span>heated</span> <span>perhaps</span> just one room.<br/>
🎧 Of course, the <span>smoke</span> from these <span>contributed</span> a great <span>deal</span> to the air <span>pollution<br/></span>
🎧 for which <span>London</span> used to be famous.<br/>
🎧 A <span>tiny</span>, <span>damp</span>, <span>unhealthy</span> house like this might well be <span>occupied</span> by two full <span>families</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>possibly</span> <span>including</span> <span>several</span> children, <span>grandparents</span>, <span>aunts</span> and <span>uncles</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, before I go on to <span>health</span> <span>implications</span> of this way of life,<br/>
🎧 I'll say something about food and <span>nutrition</span>.<br/>
