🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 Thanks for coming</span> in to see us here at the agency</span>, Joe</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm one of the agency</span> representatives</span>, and my name's</span> Sally</span> Baker</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hi Sally</span>. I think we spoke</span> on the phone, didn't we?<br/>
🎧 That's right, we did.<br/>
🎧 So thank you for sending</span> in your CV</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've had quite a careful</span> look at it<br/></span>
🎧 and I think we have two jobs</span> that might be suitable</span> for you.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 The first one is in a company based</span> in North</span> London</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're looking for an administrative</span> assistant</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 What sort</span> of company is it?<br/>
🎧 They're called Home Solutions<br/></span>
🎧 and they design</span> and make furniture</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I don't know much about that,<br/>
🎧 but it sounds interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, well as I said, they want someone</span> in their office</span>,<br/>
🎧 and looking at your past</span> experience<br/></span>
🎧 it does look as if you fit quite a few of the requirements</span>.<br/>
🎧 So on your CV</span> it appears</span> you've done some data</span> entry</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 So that's one skill</span> they want.<br/>
🎧 Then they expect</span> the person they appoint</span> to attend</span> meetings</span> and take notes</span> there…<br/></span>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 I've done that before, yes.<br/>
🎧 And you'd need to be able to cope</span> with general</span> admin</span>.<br/>
🎧 Filing</span>, and keeping</span> records</span> and so on?<br/>
🎧 That should be OK.<br/>
🎧 And in my last job</span> I also had to manage</span> the diary</span>.<br/>
🎧 Excellent</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's something they want here too.<br/>
🎧 I'd suggest</span> you add it to your CV</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't think you mentioned</span> that, did you?<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 So as far</span> as the requirements</span> go, they want good computer</span> skills</span>, of course,<br/>
🎧 and they particularly</span> mention</span> spreadsheets</span>.<br/>
🎧 That should be fine.<br/>
🎧 And interpersonal</span> skills</span>,<br/>
🎧 which would be something they'd check with your references</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think that should be OK, yes.<br/>
🎧 Then they mention</span> that they want someone</span> who is careful</span> and takes care</span> with details</span>.<br/>
🎧 Just looking at your CV</span>, I'd say you're probably alright there.<br/>
🎧 I think so, yes.<br/>
🎧 Do they want any special experience</span>?<br/>
🎧 I think they wanted some experience</span> of teleconferencing</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've got three</span> years'</span> experience</span> of that.<br/>
🎧 Let's see, yes, good.<br/>
🎧 In fact</span> they're only asking</span> for at least</span> one year, so that's great.<br/>
🎧 So is that something that might interest</span> you?<br/>
🎧 It is, yes.<br/>
🎧 The only thing is, you said they were in North</span> London<br/></span>
🎧 so it would be quite a long commute</span> for me.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So the second position</span> might suit</span> you better as far</span> as the location</span> goes;<br/></span>
🎧 that's for a warehouse</span> assistant</span> and that's in South</span> London</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that would be a lot closer</span>.<br/>
🎧 And you've worked</span> in a warehouse</span> before, haven't you?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 So as far</span> as the responsibilities</span> for this position</span> go,<br/>
🎧 they want someone</span> who can manage</span> the stock</span>, obviously</span>, and also deliveries</span>.<br/>
🎧 That should be OK.<br/>
🎧 You've got to keep track</span> of stuff</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I've always been quite good with numbers</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good, that's their first requirement</span>.<br/>
🎧 And they want someone</span> who's computer</span> literate</span>, which we know you are.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 Then they mention</span> organisational</span> skills</span>.<br/>
🎧 They want someone</span> who's well organised</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I think I am.<br/>
🎧 And tidy</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, they go together really, don't they?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 Then the usual</span> stuff;</span> they want someone</span> who can communicate</span> well both orally</span> and in writing</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And for the last warehouse</span> job</span> I had,<br/>
🎧 one of the things I enjoyed</span> most was being part</span> of a team</span>.<br/>
🎧 I found</span> that was really essential</span> for the job</span>.<br/>
🎧 Excellent</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, they do mention</span> that they want someone</span> who's used to that, yes.<br/>
🎧 Now when you were working in a warehouse</span> last time,<br/>
🎧 what sorts</span> of items</span> were you dealing</span> with?<br/>
🎧 It was mostly</span> bathroom</span> and kitchen</span> equipment</span>,<br/>
🎧 sinks</span> and stoves</span> and fridges</span>.<br/>
🎧 So you're OK moving</span> heavy</span> things?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 I'm quite strong</span>, and I've had the training</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 Now as far</span> as experience</span> goes</span>, they mention</span> they want someone</span> with a licence</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that you have experience</span> of driving in London</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 so you can cope</span> with the traffic</span> and so on.<br/>
🎧 Yes, no problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 And you've got experience</span> of warehouse</span> work…<br/></span>
🎧 and the final</span> thing they mention</span> is customer</span> service</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think looking at your CV</span> you're OK there.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So what about pay?<br/>
🎧 Can you tell me a bit more about that, please…<br/></span>
<br />

🎧 My guest</span> on the show today is Alice</span> Riches<br/></span>
🎧 who started</span> the Street</span> Play Scheme</span> where she lives in Beechwood</span> Road</span>.<br/>
🎧 For those of you that don't already know,<br/>
🎧 Street</span> Play involves</span> local</span> residents</span> closing</span> off their street</span> for a few hours<br/></span>
🎧 so that children have a chance</span> to play in the street</span> safely</span>.<br/>
🎧 She started</span> it in her own street</span>, Beechwood</span> Road</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the idea caught</span> on,<br/>
🎧 and there are now Street</span> Play Schemes</span> all over the city</span>.<br/>
🎧 So when did you actually start the scheme</span>, Alice</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I first had the idea when my oldest</span> child</span> was still a toddler</span>,<br/>
🎧 so that's about six years ago now,<br/>
🎧 but it took at least</span> two years of campaigning</span> before we were actually able to make it happen</span>.<br/>
🎧 So the scheme's</span> been up and running</span> for three</span> years now.<br/>
🎧 We'd love to be able to close</span> our road</span> for longer</span>,<br/>
🎧 for the whole weekend, from Saturday</span> morning until Sunday</span> evening</span>, for example.<br/>
🎧 At the moment</span> it's just once a week.<br/>
🎧 But when we started</span> it was only once a month.<br/>
🎧 But we're working on it.<br/>
🎧 So what actually happens</span> when Beechwood</span> Road</span> is closed</span>?<br/>
🎧 We have volunteer</span> wardens</span>,<br/>
🎧 mostly</span> parents</span> but some elderly</span> residents</span> too,<br/>
🎧 who block</span> off our road</span> at either end.<br/>
🎧 The council</span> have provided</span> special signs<br/></span>
🎧 but there's always a volunteer</span> there to explain</span> what's happening</span> to any motorists</span>.<br/>
🎧 Generally</span>, they're fine about it,<br/>
🎧 we've only had to get the police</span> involved</span> once or twice</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now I should explain</span> that the road</span> isn't completely</span> closed</span> to cars</span>.<br/>
🎧 But only residents'</span> cars</span> are allowed</span>.<br/>
🎧 If people really need to get in or out of Beechwood</span> Road</span>,<br/>
🎧 it's not a problem</span>,<br/>
🎧 as long as they drive at under 20</span> kilometres</span> per</span> hour</span>.<br/>
🎧 But most people just decide not to use their cars</span> during this time,<br/>
🎧 or they park</span> in another street</span>.<br/>
🎧 The wardens</span> are only there to stop</span> through traffic</span>.<br/>
🎧 So can anyone</span> apply</span> to get involved</span> in Street</span> Play?<br/>
🎧 Absolutely!<br/>
🎧 We want to include</span> all kids</span> in the city</span>,<br/>
🎧 especially</span> those who live on busy</span> roads</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's here that demand</span> is greatest</span>.<br/>
🎧 Obviously</span>, there isn't such demand</span> in wealthier</span> areas<br/></span>
🎧 where the children have access</span> to parks</span> or large gardens</span>,<br/>
🎧 or in the suburbs</span> where there are usually more places</span> for children to play outside.<br/>
🎧 I'd recommend</span> that anyone</span> listening</span> who likes the idea should just give it a go.<br/>
🎧 We've been surprised</span> by the positive</span> reaction</span> of residents</span> all over the city</span>.<br/>
🎧 And that's not just parents</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are always a few who complain</span> but they're a tiny</span> minority</span>.<br/>
🎧 On the whole everyone is very supportive<br/></span>
🎧 and say they're very happy to see children out on the street</span>,<br/>
🎧 even if it does get quite noisy</span>.<br/>
🎧 There have been so many benefits</span> of Street</span> Play for the kids</span>.<br/>
🎧 Parents</span> really like the fact</span> that the kids</span> are getting fresh</span> air<br/></span>
🎧 instead</span> of sitting</span> staring</span> at a computer</span> screen</span>,<br/>
🎧 even if they're not doing anything particularly</span> energetic</span>.<br/>
🎧 And of course it's great that kids</span> can play with their friends outside without being supervised</span> by their parents</span>,<br/>
🎧 but for me the biggest</span> advantage</span> is that kids</span> develop</span> confidence</span> in themselves</span> to be outside without their parents</span>.<br/>
🎧 The other really fantastic</span> thing is that children get to know the adults</span> in the street</span>,<br/>
🎧 it's like having a big extended</span> family</span>.<br/>
🎧 It certainly</span> does have a lot of benefits</span>.<br/>
🎧 I want to move on now and ask you about a related</span> project</span> in King</span> Street</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Well this was an experiment</span> I was involved</span> in<br/></span>
🎧 where local</span> residents</span> decided</span> to try and reduce</span> the traffic</span> along King</span> Street</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is the busiest</span> main</span> road</span> in our area</span>,<br/>
🎧 by persuading</span> people not to use their cars</span> for one day.<br/>
🎧 We thought about making</span> people pay more for parking</span>,<br/>
🎧 but we decided</span> that would be really unpopular</span>,<br/>
🎧 so instead</span> we just stopped</span> people from parking</span> on King</span> Street<br/></span>
🎧 but left</span> the other car parks</span> open.<br/>
🎧 It was surprising</span> how much of a difference</span> all this made.<br/>
🎧 As we'd predicted</span>, air quality</span> was significantly</span> better<br/></span>
🎧 but what I hadn't expected</span> was how much quieter</span> it would be,<br/>
🎧 even with the buses</span> still running</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course everyone said they felt</span> safer<br/></span>
🎧 but we were actually amazed</span> that sales</span> in the shops</span> went up considerably</span> that day,<br/>
🎧 we thought there'd</span> be fewer</span> people out shopping</span>, not more.<br/>
🎧 That's really interesting..</span>.<br/>
<br />

🎧 Tom</span>, could I ask you for some advice, please?<br/>
🎧 Yes of course, if you think I can help.<br/>
🎧 What's it about?<br/>
🎧 It's my first media</span> studies</span> assignment</span>, and I'm not sure how to go about it.<br/>
🎧 You must have done it last year.<br/>
🎧 Is that the one comparing</span> the coverage</span> of a particular</span> story</span> in a range</span> of newspapers</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, I really enjoyed</span> writing</span> it.<br/>
🎧 So what sort</span> of things do I need to compare</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, there are several</span> things.<br/>
🎧 For example, there's the question</span> of which page</span> of the newspaper</span> the item</span> appears</span> on.<br/>
🎧 You mean, because there's a big difference</span> between having it on the front</span> page</span> and the bottom</span> of page</span> ten, for instance</span>?<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 And that shows</span> how important the editor</span> thinks</span> the story</span> is.<br/>
🎧 Then there's the size:<br/>
🎧 how many column</span> inches</span> the story</span> is given</span>,<br/>
🎧 how many columns</span> it spreads</span> over.<br/>
🎧 And I suppose</span> that includes</span> the headline</span>.<br/>
🎧 It certainly</span> does.<br/>
🎧 It's all part</span> of attracting</span> the reader's</span> attention</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about graphics</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 whether</span> there's anything visual</span> in addition</span> to the text</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, you need to consider</span> those, too,<br/>
🎧 because they can have a big effect</span> on the reader's</span> understanding</span> of the story</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 sometimes a bigger</span> effect</span> than the text</span> itself</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then you'll need to look at how the item</span> is put together:<br/>
🎧 what structure</span> is it given</span>?<br/>
🎧 Bear</span> in mind</span> that not many people read beyond</span> the first paragraph</span>,<br/>
🎧 so what has the journalist</span> put at the beginning</span>?<br/>
🎧 And if, say, there are conflicting</span> opinions</span> about something,<br/>
🎧 does one appear</span> near the end, where people probably won't read it?<br/>
🎧 And newspapers</span> sometimes give wrong or misleading</span> information</span>, don't they?<br/>
🎧 Either deliberately</span> or by accident</span>.<br/>
🎧 Should I be looking at that, too?<br/>
🎧 Yes, if you can.<br/>
🎧 Compare</span> what's in different versions</span>, and as far</span> as possible</span>,<br/>
🎧 try and work out what's true</span> and what isn't.<br/>
🎧 And that relates</span> to a very important point</span>:<br/>
🎧 what's the writer's</span> purpose</span>,<br/>
🎧 or at least</span> the most important one, if they have several</span>.<br/>
🎧 It may seem</span> to be to inform</span> the public</span>,<br/>
🎧 but often it's that they want to create</span> fear</span>, or controversy</span>,<br/>
🎧 or to make somebody</span> look ridiculous</span>.<br/>
🎧 Gosh</span>, I see what you mean.<br/>
🎧 I suppose</span> the writer</span> may make assumptions</span> about the reader</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's right -</span> about their knowledge</span> of the subject</span>, their attitudes</span>, and their level</span> of education</span>,<br/>
🎧 which means</span> writing</span> so that the readers</span> understand</span> without feeling patronised</span>.<br/>
🎧 All of that will make a difference</span> to how the story</span> is presented</span>.<br/>
🎧 Does it matter</span> what type</span> of story</span> I write</span> about?<br/>
🎧 No, national</span> or international</span> politics</span>, the arts…</span> anything,<br/>
🎧 as long as it's covered</span> in two or three</span> newspapers</span>.<br/>
🎧 Though of course it'll be easier</span> and more fun if it's something you're interested in and know something about.<br/>
🎧 And on that basis</span> a national</span> news</span> item</span> would be worth</span> analysing</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 I'm quite keen</span> on politics</span>, so I'll try and find a suitable</span> topic</span>.<br/>
🎧 What did you choose for your analysis</span>, Tom</span>?<br/>
🎧 I was interested in how newspapers</span> express</span> their opinions</span> explicitly</span>,<br/>
🎧 so I wanted to compare</span> editorials</span> in different papers</span>,<br/>
🎧 but when I started</span> looking,<br/>
🎧 I couldn't find two on the same topic</span> that I felt</span> like analysing</span>.<br/>
🎧 In that case, I won't even bother</span> to look.<br/>
🎧 So in the end I chose</span> a human</span> interest</span> story</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 a terribly</span> emotional</span> story</span> about a young girl who was very ill</span>,<br/>
🎧 and lots of other people -</span> mostly</span> strangers</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 raised</span> money so she could go abroad</span> for treatment</span>.<br/>
🎧 Actually, I was surprised</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 some papers</span> just wrote</span> about how wonderful everyone was,<br/>
🎧 but others</span> considered</span> the broader</span> picture</span>,<br/>
🎧 like why treatment</span> wasn't available</span> here.<br/>
🎧 Hmm</span>, I usually find stories</span> like that raise</span> quite strong</span> feelings</span> in me!<br/>
🎧 I'll avoid</span> that.<br/>
🎧 Perhaps</span> I'll choose an arts</span> topic</span>,<br/>
🎧 like different reviews</span> of a film</span>, or something about funding</span> for the arts</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 I'll think about that.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that might be interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, well thanks a lot for your help, Tom</span>. It's been really useful</span>.<br/>
🎧 You're welcome</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good luck</span> with the assignment</span>, Hazel</span>.<br/>
<br />

🎧 Nowadays</span>, we use different products</span> for personal cleanliness</span>, laundry</span>, dishwashing</span> and household</span> cleaning</span>,<br/>
🎧 but this is very much a 20th-century</span> development</span>.<br/>
🎧 The origins</span> of cleanliness</span> date back to prehistoric</span> times</span>.<br/>
🎧 Since water is essential</span> for life,<br/>
🎧 the earliest</span> people lived</span> near water and knew</span> something about its cleansing</span> properties</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 at least</span> that it rinsed</span> mud</span> off their hands</span>.<br/>
🎧 During the excavation</span> of ancient</span> Babylon</span>,<br/>
🎧 evidence</span> was found</span> that soapmaking</span> was known</span> as early</span> as 2800</span> BC</span>.<br/>
🎧 Archaeologists</span> discovered</span> cylinders</span> made of clay</span>,<br/>
🎧 with inscriptions</span> on them saying that fats</span> were boiled</span> with ashes</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is a method</span> of making</span> soap</span>,<br/>
🎧 though there's no reference</span> to the purpose</span> of this material</span>.<br/>
🎧 The early</span> Greeks</span> bathed</span> for aesthetic</span> reasons</span> and apparently</span> didn't use soap</span>.<br/>
🎧 Instead</span>, they cleaned</span> their bodies</span> with blocks</span> of sand</span>, pumice</span> and ashes</span>,<br/>
🎧 then anointed</span> themselves</span> with oil,<br/>
🎧 and scraped</span> off the oil and dirt</span> with a metal</span> instrument</span> known</span> as a strigil</span>.<br/>
🎧 They also used oil mixed</span> with ashes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Clothes</span> were washed</span> without soap</span> in streams</span>.<br/>
🎧 The ancient</span> Germans</span> and Gauls</span> are also credited</span> with discovering</span> how to make a substance</span> called 'soap'</span>,<br/>
🎧 made of melted</span> animal</span> fat and ashes</span>.<br/>
🎧 They used this mixture</span> to tint</span> their hair</span> red.<br/>
🎧 Soap</span> got its name, according</span> to an ancient</span> Roman</span> legend</span>, from Mount</span> Sapo</span>,<br/>
🎧 where animals</span> were sacrificed</span>, leaving</span> deposits</span> of animal</span> fat.<br/>
🎧 Rain</span> washed</span> these deposits</span>, along with wood</span> ashes</span>,<br/>
🎧 down into the clay</span> soil</span> along the River</span> Tiber</span>.<br/>
🎧 Women</span> found</span> that this mixture</span> greatly</span> reduced</span> the effort</span> required</span> to wash</span> their clothes</span>.<br/>
🎧 As Roman</span> civilisation</span> advanced</span>, so did bathing</span>.<br/>
🎧 The first of the famous Roman</span> baths</span>, supplied</span> with water from their aqueducts</span>,<br/>
🎧 was built</span> around 312</span> BC</span>.<br/>
🎧 The baths</span> were luxurious</span>, and bathing</span> became</span> very popular</span>.<br/>
🎧 And by the second century</span> AD</span>,<br/>
🎧 the Greek</span> physician</span> Galen</span> recommended</span> soap</span> for both medicinal</span> and cleansing</span> purposes</span>.<br/>
🎧 After the fall</span> of Rome</span> in 467</span> AD<br/></span>
🎧 and the resulting</span> decline</span> in bathing</span> habits</span>,<br/>
🎧 much of Europe</span> felt</span> the impact</span> of filth</span> on public</span> health</span>.<br/>
🎧 This lack</span> of personal cleanliness</span> and related</span> unsanitary</span> living conditions<br/></span>
🎧 were major</span> factors</span> in the outbreaks</span> of disease</span> in the Middle</span> Ages</span>,<br/>
🎧 and especially</span> the Black</span> Death</span> of the 14th</span> century</span>.<br/>
🎧 Nevertheless</span>, soapmaking</span> became</span> an established</span> craft</span> in Europe</span>,<br/>
🎧 and associations</span> of soapmakers</span> guarded</span> their trade</span> secrets</span> closely</span>.<br/>
🎧 Vegetable</span> and animal</span> oils</span> were used with ashes</span> of plants</span>,<br/>
🎧 along with perfume</span>, apparently</span> for the first time.<br/>
🎧 Gradually</span> more varieties</span> of soap</span> became</span> available</span> for shaving</span> and shampooing</span>,<br/>
🎧 as well as bathing</span> and laundering</span>.<br/>
🎧 A major</span> step</span> toward</span> large-scale</span> commercial</span> soapmaking</span> occurred</span> in 1791</span>,<br/>
🎧 when a French</span> chemist</span>, Nicholas</span> Leblanc</span>, patented</span> a process</span> for turning</span> salt</span> into soda</span> ash</span>,<br/>
🎧 or sodium</span> carbonate</span>.<br/>
🎧 Soda</span> ash</span> is the alkali</span> obtained</span> from ashes</span> that combines</span> with fat to form</span> soap</span>.<br/>
🎧 The Leblanc</span> process</span> yielded</span> quantities</span> of good-quality</span>, inexpensive</span> soda</span> ash</span>.<br/>
🎧 Modern</span> soapmaking</span> was born</span> some 20</span> years later,<br/>
🎧 in the early</span> 19th</span> century</span>,<br/>
🎧 with the discovery</span> by Michel</span> Eugene</span> Chevreul</span>, another French</span> chemist</span>,<br/>
🎧 of the chemical</span> nature</span> and relationship</span> of fats</span>, glycerine</span> and fatty</span> acids</span>.<br/>
🎧 His studies</span> established</span> the basis</span> for both fat and soap</span> chemistry</span>,<br/>
🎧 and soapmaking</span> became</span> a science</span>.<br/>
🎧 Further</span> developments</span> during the 19th</span> century</span> made it easier</span> and cheaper</span> to manufacture</span> soap</span>.<br/>
🎧 Until the 19th</span> century</span>, soap</span> was regarded</span> as a luxury</span> item</span>,<br/>
🎧 and was heavily</span> taxed</span> in several</span> countries</span>.<br/>
🎧 As it became</span> more readily</span> available</span>, it became</span> an everyday necessity</span>,<br/>
🎧 a development</span> that was reinforced</span> when the high tax</span> was removed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Soap</span> was then something ordinary</span> people could afford</span>,<br/>
🎧 and cleanliness</span> standards</span> improved</span>.<br/>
🎧 With this widespread</span> use came the development</span> of milder</span> soaps</span> for bathing<br/></span>
🎧 and soaps</span> for use in the washing</span> machines</span> that were available</span> to consumers</span> by the turn</span> of the 20th</span> century</span>.<br/>
