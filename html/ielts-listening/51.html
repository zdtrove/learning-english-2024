🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 Thanks for <span>coming</span> in to see us here at the <span>agency</span>, <span>Joe</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm one of the <span>agency</span> <span>representatives</span>, and my <span>name's</span> <span>Sally</span> <span>Baker</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hi <span>Sally</span>. I think we <span>spoke</span> on the phone, didn't we?<br/>
🎧 That's right, we did.<br/>
🎧 So thank you for <span>sending</span> in your <span>CV</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've had quite a <span>careful</span> look at <span>it<br/></span>
🎧 and I think we have two <span>jobs</span> that might be <span>suitable</span> for you.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 The first one is in a company <span>based</span> in <span>North</span> <span>London</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're looking for an <span>administrative</span> <span>assistant</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 What <span>sort</span> of company is it?<br/>
🎧 They're called Home <span>Solutions<br/></span>
🎧 and they <span>design</span> and make <span>furniture</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I don't know much about that,<br/>
🎧 but it sounds <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, well as I said, they want <span>someone</span> in their <span>office</span>,<br/>
🎧 and looking at your <span>past</span> <span>experience<br/></span>
🎧 it does look as if you fit quite a few of the <span>requirements</span>.<br/>
🎧 So on your <span>CV</span> it <span>appears</span> you've done some <span>data</span> <span>entry</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 So that's one <span>skill</span> they want.<br/>
🎧 Then they <span>expect</span> the person they <span>appoint</span> to <span>attend</span> <span>meetings</span> and take <span>notes</span> <span>there…<br/></span>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 I've done that before, yes.<br/>
🎧 And you'd need to be able to <span>cope</span> with <span>general</span> <span>admin</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Filing</span>, and <span>keeping</span> <span>records</span> and so on?<br/>
🎧 That should be OK.<br/>
🎧 And in my last <span>job</span> I also had to <span>manage</span> the <span>diary</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Excellent</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's something they want here too.<br/>
🎧 I'd <span>suggest</span> you add it to your <span>CV</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't think you <span>mentioned</span> that, did you?<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 So as <span>far</span> as the <span>requirements</span> go, they want good <span>computer</span> <span>skills</span>, of course,<br/>
🎧 and they <span>particularly</span> <span>mention</span> <span>spreadsheets</span>.<br/>
🎧 That should be fine.<br/>
🎧 And <span>interpersonal</span> <span>skills</span>,<br/>
🎧 which would be something they'd check with your <span>references</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think that should be OK, yes.<br/>
🎧 Then they <span>mention</span> that they want <span>someone</span> who is <span>careful</span> and takes <span>care</span> with <span>details</span>.<br/>
🎧 Just looking at your <span>CV</span>, I'd say you're probably alright there.<br/>
🎧 I think so, yes.<br/>
🎧 Do they want any special <span>experience</span>?<br/>
🎧 I think they wanted some <span>experience</span> of <span>teleconferencing</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've got <span>three</span> <span>years'</span> <span>experience</span> of that.<br/>
🎧 Let's see, yes, good.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span> they're only <span>asking</span> for at <span>least</span> one year, so that's great.<br/>
🎧 So is that something that might <span>interest</span> you?<br/>
🎧 It is, yes.<br/>
🎧 The only thing is, you said they were in <span>North</span> <span>London<br/></span>
🎧 so it would be quite a long <span>commute</span> for me.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So the second <span>position</span> might <span>suit</span> you better as <span>far</span> as the <span>location</span> <span>goes;<br/></span>
🎧 that's for a <span>warehouse</span> <span>assistant</span> and that's in <span>South</span> <span>London</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that would be a lot <span>closer</span>.<br/>
🎧 And you've <span>worked</span> in a <span>warehouse</span> before, haven't you?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 So as <span>far</span> as the <span>responsibilities</span> for this <span>position</span> go,<br/>
🎧 they want <span>someone</span> who can <span>manage</span> the <span>stock</span>, <span>obviously</span>, and also <span>deliveries</span>.<br/>
🎧 That should be OK.<br/>
🎧 You've got to keep <span>track</span> of <span>stuff</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I've always been quite good with <span>numbers</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good, that's their first <span>requirement</span>.<br/>
🎧 And they want <span>someone</span> who's <span>computer</span> <span>literate</span>, which we know you are.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 Then they <span>mention</span> <span>organisational</span> <span>skills</span>.<br/>
🎧 They want <span>someone</span> who's well <span>organised</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I think I am.<br/>
🎧 And <span>tidy</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, they go together really, don't they?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 Then the <span>usual</span> <span>stuff;</span> they want <span>someone</span> who can <span>communicate</span> well both <span>orally</span> and in <span>writing</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And for the last <span>warehouse</span> <span>job</span> I had,<br/>
🎧 one of the things I <span>enjoyed</span> most was being <span>part</span> of a <span>team</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>found</span> that was really <span>essential</span> for the <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Excellent</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, they do <span>mention</span> that they want <span>someone</span> who's used to that, yes.<br/>
🎧 Now when you were working in a <span>warehouse</span> last time,<br/>
🎧 what <span>sorts</span> of <span>items</span> were you <span>dealing</span> with?<br/>
🎧 It was <span>mostly</span> <span>bathroom</span> and <span>kitchen</span> <span>equipment</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>sinks</span> and <span>stoves</span> and <span>fridges</span>.<br/>
🎧 So you're OK <span>moving</span> <span>heavy</span> things?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 I'm quite <span>strong</span>, and I've had the <span>training</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 Now as <span>far</span> as <span>experience</span> <span>goes</span>, they <span>mention</span> they want <span>someone</span> with a <span>licence</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that you have <span>experience</span> of driving in <span>London</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 so you can <span>cope</span> with the <span>traffic</span> and so on.<br/>
🎧 Yes, no <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 And you've got <span>experience</span> of <span>warehouse</span> <span>work…<br/></span>
🎧 and the <span>final</span> thing they <span>mention</span> is <span>customer</span> <span>service</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think looking at your <span>CV</span> you're OK there.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So what about pay?<br/>
🎧 Can you tell me a bit more about that, <span>please…<br/></span>
<br />

🎧 My <span>guest</span> on the show today is <span>Alice</span> <span>Riches<br/></span>
🎧 who <span>started</span> the <span>Street</span> Play <span>Scheme</span> where she lives in <span>Beechwood</span> <span>Road</span>.<br/>
🎧 For those of you that don't already know,<br/>
🎧 <span>Street</span> Play <span>involves</span> <span>local</span> <span>residents</span> <span>closing</span> off their <span>street</span> for a few <span>hours<br/></span>
🎧 so that children have a <span>chance</span> to play in the <span>street</span> <span>safely</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>started</span> it in her own <span>street</span>, <span>Beechwood</span> <span>Road</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the idea <span>caught</span> on,<br/>
🎧 and there are now <span>Street</span> Play <span>Schemes</span> all over the <span>city</span>.<br/>
🎧 So when did you actually start the <span>scheme</span>, <span>Alice</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I first had the idea when my <span>oldest</span> <span>child</span> was still a <span>toddler</span>,<br/>
🎧 so that's about six years ago now,<br/>
🎧 but it took at <span>least</span> two years of <span>campaigning</span> before we were actually able to make it <span>happen</span>.<br/>
🎧 So the <span>scheme's</span> been up and <span>running</span> for <span>three</span> years now.<br/>
🎧 We'd love to be able to <span>close</span> our <span>road</span> for <span>longer</span>,<br/>
🎧 for the whole weekend, from <span>Saturday</span> morning until <span>Sunday</span> <span>evening</span>, for example.<br/>
🎧 At the <span>moment</span> it's just once a week.<br/>
🎧 But when we <span>started</span> it was only once a month.<br/>
🎧 But we're working on it.<br/>
🎧 So what actually <span>happens</span> when <span>Beechwood</span> <span>Road</span> is <span>closed</span>?<br/>
🎧 We have <span>volunteer</span> <span>wardens</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>mostly</span> <span>parents</span> but some <span>elderly</span> <span>residents</span> too,<br/>
🎧 who <span>block</span> off our <span>road</span> at either end.<br/>
🎧 The <span>council</span> have <span>provided</span> special <span>signs<br/></span>
🎧 but there's always a <span>volunteer</span> there to <span>explain</span> what's <span>happening</span> to any <span>motorists</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Generally</span>, they're fine about it,<br/>
🎧 we've only had to get the <span>police</span> <span>involved</span> once or <span>twice</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now I should <span>explain</span> that the <span>road</span> isn't <span>completely</span> <span>closed</span> to <span>cars</span>.<br/>
🎧 But only <span>residents'</span> <span>cars</span> are <span>allowed</span>.<br/>
🎧 If people really need to get in or out of <span>Beechwood</span> <span>Road</span>,<br/>
🎧 it's not a <span>problem</span>,<br/>
🎧 as long as they drive at under <span>20</span> <span>kilometres</span> <span>per</span> <span>hour</span>.<br/>
🎧 But most people just decide not to use their <span>cars</span> during this time,<br/>
🎧 or they <span>park</span> in another <span>street</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>wardens</span> are only there to <span>stop</span> through <span>traffic</span>.<br/>
🎧 So can <span>anyone</span> <span>apply</span> to get <span>involved</span> in <span>Street</span> Play?<br/>
🎧 Absolutely!<br/>
🎧 We want to <span>include</span> all <span>kids</span> in the <span>city</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>especially</span> those who live on <span>busy</span> <span>roads</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's here that <span>demand</span> is <span>greatest</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Obviously</span>, there isn't such <span>demand</span> in <span>wealthier</span> <span>areas<br/></span>
🎧 where the children have <span>access</span> to <span>parks</span> or large <span>gardens</span>,<br/>
🎧 or in the <span>suburbs</span> where there are usually more <span>places</span> for children to play outside.<br/>
🎧 I'd <span>recommend</span> that <span>anyone</span> <span>listening</span> who likes the idea should just give it a go.<br/>
🎧 We've been <span>surprised</span> by the <span>positive</span> <span>reaction</span> of <span>residents</span> all over the <span>city</span>.<br/>
🎧 And that's not just <span>parents</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are always a few who <span>complain</span> but they're a <span>tiny</span> <span>minority</span>.<br/>
🎧 On the whole everyone is very <span>supportive<br/></span>
🎧 and say they're very happy to see children out on the <span>street</span>,<br/>
🎧 even if it does get quite <span>noisy</span>.<br/>
🎧 There have been so many <span>benefits</span> of <span>Street</span> Play for the <span>kids</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Parents</span> really like the <span>fact</span> that the <span>kids</span> are getting <span>fresh</span> <span>air<br/></span>
🎧 <span>instead</span> of <span>sitting</span> <span>staring</span> at a <span>computer</span> <span>screen</span>,<br/>
🎧 even if they're not doing anything <span>particularly</span> <span>energetic</span>.<br/>
🎧 And of course it's great that <span>kids</span> can play with their friends outside without being <span>supervised</span> by their <span>parents</span>,<br/>
🎧 but for me the <span>biggest</span> <span>advantage</span> is that <span>kids</span> <span>develop</span> <span>confidence</span> in <span>themselves</span> to be outside without their <span>parents</span>.<br/>
🎧 The other really <span>fantastic</span> thing is that children get to know the <span>adults</span> in the <span>street</span>,<br/>
🎧 it's like having a big <span>extended</span> <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>certainly</span> does have a lot of <span>benefits</span>.<br/>
🎧 I want to move on now and ask you about a <span>related</span> <span>project</span> in <span>King</span> <span>Street</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Well this was an <span>experiment</span> I was <span>involved</span> <span>in<br/></span>
🎧 where <span>local</span> <span>residents</span> <span>decided</span> to try and <span>reduce</span> the <span>traffic</span> along <span>King</span> <span>Street</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is the <span>busiest</span> <span>main</span> <span>road</span> in our <span>area</span>,<br/>
🎧 by <span>persuading</span> people not to use their <span>cars</span> for one day.<br/>
🎧 We thought about <span>making</span> people pay more for <span>parking</span>,<br/>
🎧 but we <span>decided</span> that would be really <span>unpopular</span>,<br/>
🎧 so <span>instead</span> we just <span>stopped</span> people from <span>parking</span> on <span>King</span> <span>Street<br/></span>
🎧 but <span>left</span> the other car <span>parks</span> open.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>surprising</span> how much of a <span>difference</span> all this made.<br/>
🎧 As we'd <span>predicted</span>, air <span>quality</span> was <span>significantly</span> <span>better<br/></span>
🎧 but what I hadn't <span>expected</span> was how much <span>quieter</span> it would be,<br/>
🎧 even with the <span>buses</span> still <span>running</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course everyone said they <span>felt</span> <span>safer<br/></span>
🎧 but we were actually <span>amazed</span> that <span>sales</span> in the <span>shops</span> went up <span>considerably</span> that day,<br/>
🎧 we thought <span>there'd</span> be <span>fewer</span> people out <span>shopping</span>, not more.<br/>
🎧 That's really <span>interesting..</span>.<br/>
<br />

🎧 <span>Tom</span>, could I ask you for some advice, please?<br/>
🎧 Yes of course, if you think I can help.<br/>
🎧 What's it about?<br/>
🎧 It's my first <span>media</span> <span>studies</span> <span>assignment</span>, and I'm not sure how to go about it.<br/>
🎧 You must have done it last year.<br/>
🎧 Is that the one <span>comparing</span> the <span>coverage</span> of a <span>particular</span> <span>story</span> in a <span>range</span> of <span>newspapers</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, I really <span>enjoyed</span> <span>writing</span> it.<br/>
🎧 So what <span>sort</span> of things do I need to <span>compare</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, there are <span>several</span> things.<br/>
🎧 For example, there's the <span>question</span> of which <span>page</span> of the <span>newspaper</span> the <span>item</span> <span>appears</span> on.<br/>
🎧 You mean, because there's a big <span>difference</span> between having it on the <span>front</span> <span>page</span> and the <span>bottom</span> of <span>page</span> ten, for <span>instance</span>?<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 And that <span>shows</span> how important the <span>editor</span> <span>thinks</span> the <span>story</span> is.<br/>
🎧 Then there's the size:<br/>
🎧 how many <span>column</span> <span>inches</span> the <span>story</span> is <span>given</span>,<br/>
🎧 how many <span>columns</span> it <span>spreads</span> over.<br/>
🎧 And I <span>suppose</span> that <span>includes</span> the <span>headline</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>certainly</span> does.<br/>
🎧 It's all <span>part</span> of <span>attracting</span> the <span>reader's</span> <span>attention</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about <span>graphics</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>whether</span> there's anything <span>visual</span> in <span>addition</span> to the <span>text</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, you need to <span>consider</span> those, too,<br/>
🎧 because they can have a big <span>effect</span> on the <span>reader's</span> <span>understanding</span> of the <span>story</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 sometimes a <span>bigger</span> <span>effect</span> than the <span>text</span> <span>itself</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then you'll need to look at how the <span>item</span> is put together:<br/>
🎧 what <span>structure</span> is it <span>given</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Bear</span> in <span>mind</span> that not many people read <span>beyond</span> the first <span>paragraph</span>,<br/>
🎧 so what has the <span>journalist</span> put at the <span>beginning</span>?<br/>
🎧 And if, say, there are <span>conflicting</span> <span>opinions</span> about something,<br/>
🎧 does one <span>appear</span> near the end, where people probably won't read it?<br/>
🎧 And <span>newspapers</span> sometimes give wrong or <span>misleading</span> <span>information</span>, don't they?<br/>
🎧 Either <span>deliberately</span> or by <span>accident</span>.<br/>
🎧 Should I be looking at that, too?<br/>
🎧 Yes, if you can.<br/>
🎧 <span>Compare</span> what's in different <span>versions</span>, and as <span>far</span> as <span>possible</span>,<br/>
🎧 try and work out what's <span>true</span> and what isn't.<br/>
🎧 And that <span>relates</span> to a very important <span>point</span>:<br/>
🎧 what's the <span>writer's</span> <span>purpose</span>,<br/>
🎧 or at <span>least</span> the most important one, if they have <span>several</span>.<br/>
🎧 It may <span>seem</span> to be to <span>inform</span> the <span>public</span>,<br/>
🎧 but often it's that they want to <span>create</span> <span>fear</span>, or <span>controversy</span>,<br/>
🎧 or to make <span>somebody</span> look <span>ridiculous</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Gosh</span>, I see what you mean.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> the <span>writer</span> may make <span>assumptions</span> about the <span>reader</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's right <span>-</span> about their <span>knowledge</span> of the <span>subject</span>, their <span>attitudes</span>, and their <span>level</span> of <span>education</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>means</span> <span>writing</span> so that the <span>readers</span> <span>understand</span> without feeling <span>patronised</span>.<br/>
🎧 All of that will make a <span>difference</span> to how the <span>story</span> is <span>presented</span>.<br/>
🎧 Does it <span>matter</span> what <span>type</span> of <span>story</span> I <span>write</span> about?<br/>
🎧 No, <span>national</span> or <span>international</span> <span>politics</span>, the <span>arts…</span> anything,<br/>
🎧 as long as it's <span>covered</span> in two or <span>three</span> <span>newspapers</span>.<br/>
🎧 Though of course it'll be <span>easier</span> and more fun if it's something you're interested in and know something about.<br/>
🎧 And on that <span>basis</span> a <span>national</span> <span>news</span> <span>item</span> would be <span>worth</span> <span>analysing</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 I'm quite <span>keen</span> on <span>politics</span>, so I'll try and find a <span>suitable</span> <span>topic</span>.<br/>
🎧 What did you choose for your <span>analysis</span>, <span>Tom</span>?<br/>
🎧 I was interested in how <span>newspapers</span> <span>express</span> their <span>opinions</span> <span>explicitly</span>,<br/>
🎧 so I wanted to <span>compare</span> <span>editorials</span> in different <span>papers</span>,<br/>
🎧 but when I <span>started</span> looking,<br/>
🎧 I couldn't find two on the same <span>topic</span> that I <span>felt</span> like <span>analysing</span>.<br/>
🎧 In that case, I won't even <span>bother</span> to look.<br/>
🎧 So in the end I <span>chose</span> a <span>human</span> <span>interest</span> <span>story</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 a <span>terribly</span> <span>emotional</span> <span>story</span> about a young girl who was very <span>ill</span>,<br/>
🎧 and lots of other people <span>-</span> <span>mostly</span> <span>strangers</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>raised</span> money so she could go <span>abroad</span> for <span>treatment</span>.<br/>
🎧 Actually, I was <span>surprised</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 some <span>papers</span> just <span>wrote</span> about how wonderful everyone was,<br/>
🎧 but <span>others</span> <span>considered</span> the <span>broader</span> <span>picture</span>,<br/>
🎧 like why <span>treatment</span> wasn't <span>available</span> here.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, I usually find <span>stories</span> like that <span>raise</span> quite <span>strong</span> <span>feelings</span> in me!<br/>
🎧 I'll <span>avoid</span> that.<br/>
🎧 <span>Perhaps</span> I'll choose an <span>arts</span> <span>topic</span>,<br/>
🎧 like different <span>reviews</span> of a <span>film</span>, or something about <span>funding</span> for the <span>arts</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 I'll think about that.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that might be <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, well thanks a lot for your help, <span>Tom</span>. It's been really <span>useful</span>.<br/>
🎧 You're <span>welcome</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good <span>luck</span> with the <span>assignment</span>, <span>Hazel</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>Nowadays</span>, we use different <span>products</span> for personal <span>cleanliness</span>, <span>laundry</span>, <span>dishwashing</span> and <span>household</span> <span>cleaning</span>,<br/>
🎧 but this is very much a <span>20th-century</span> <span>development</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>origins</span> of <span>cleanliness</span> date back to <span>prehistoric</span> <span>times</span>.<br/>
🎧 Since water is <span>essential</span> for life,<br/>
🎧 the <span>earliest</span> people <span>lived</span> near water and <span>knew</span> something about its <span>cleansing</span> <span>properties</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 at <span>least</span> that it <span>rinsed</span> <span>mud</span> off their <span>hands</span>.<br/>
🎧 During the <span>excavation</span> of <span>ancient</span> <span>Babylon</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>evidence</span> was <span>found</span> that <span>soapmaking</span> was <span>known</span> as <span>early</span> as <span>2800</span> <span>BC</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Archaeologists</span> <span>discovered</span> <span>cylinders</span> made of <span>clay</span>,<br/>
🎧 with <span>inscriptions</span> on them saying that <span>fats</span> were <span>boiled</span> with <span>ashes</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is a <span>method</span> of <span>making</span> <span>soap</span>,<br/>
🎧 though there's no <span>reference</span> to the <span>purpose</span> of this <span>material</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>early</span> <span>Greeks</span> <span>bathed</span> for <span>aesthetic</span> <span>reasons</span> and <span>apparently</span> didn't use <span>soap</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Instead</span>, they <span>cleaned</span> their <span>bodies</span> with <span>blocks</span> of <span>sand</span>, <span>pumice</span> and <span>ashes</span>,<br/>
🎧 then <span>anointed</span> <span>themselves</span> with oil,<br/>
🎧 and <span>scraped</span> off the oil and <span>dirt</span> with a <span>metal</span> <span>instrument</span> <span>known</span> as a <span>strigil</span>.<br/>
🎧 They also used oil <span>mixed</span> with <span>ashes</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Clothes</span> were <span>washed</span> without <span>soap</span> in <span>streams</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>ancient</span> <span>Germans</span> and <span>Gauls</span> are also <span>credited</span> with <span>discovering</span> how to make a <span>substance</span> called <span>'soap'</span>,<br/>
🎧 made of <span>melted</span> <span>animal</span> fat and <span>ashes</span>.<br/>
🎧 They used this <span>mixture</span> to <span>tint</span> their <span>hair</span> red.<br/>
🎧 <span>Soap</span> got its name, <span>according</span> to an <span>ancient</span> <span>Roman</span> <span>legend</span>, from <span>Mount</span> <span>Sapo</span>,<br/>
🎧 where <span>animals</span> were <span>sacrificed</span>, <span>leaving</span> <span>deposits</span> of <span>animal</span> fat.<br/>
🎧 <span>Rain</span> <span>washed</span> these <span>deposits</span>, along with <span>wood</span> <span>ashes</span>,<br/>
🎧 down into the <span>clay</span> <span>soil</span> along the <span>River</span> <span>Tiber</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Women</span> <span>found</span> that this <span>mixture</span> <span>greatly</span> <span>reduced</span> the <span>effort</span> <span>required</span> to <span>wash</span> their <span>clothes</span>.<br/>
🎧 As <span>Roman</span> <span>civilisation</span> <span>advanced</span>, so did <span>bathing</span>.<br/>
🎧 The first of the famous <span>Roman</span> <span>baths</span>, <span>supplied</span> with water from their <span>aqueducts</span>,<br/>
🎧 was <span>built</span> around <span>312</span> <span>BC</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>baths</span> were <span>luxurious</span>, and <span>bathing</span> <span>became</span> very <span>popular</span>.<br/>
🎧 And by the second <span>century</span> <span>AD</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>Greek</span> <span>physician</span> <span>Galen</span> <span>recommended</span> <span>soap</span> for both <span>medicinal</span> and <span>cleansing</span> <span>purposes</span>.<br/>
🎧 After the <span>fall</span> of <span>Rome</span> in <span>467</span> <span>AD<br/></span>
🎧 and the <span>resulting</span> <span>decline</span> in <span>bathing</span> <span>habits</span>,<br/>
🎧 much of <span>Europe</span> <span>felt</span> the <span>impact</span> of <span>filth</span> on <span>public</span> <span>health</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>lack</span> of personal <span>cleanliness</span> and <span>related</span> <span>unsanitary</span> living <span>conditions<br/></span>
🎧 were <span>major</span> <span>factors</span> in the <span>outbreaks</span> of <span>disease</span> in the <span>Middle</span> <span>Ages</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>especially</span> the <span>Black</span> <span>Death</span> of the <span>14th</span> <span>century</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Nevertheless</span>, <span>soapmaking</span> <span>became</span> an <span>established</span> <span>craft</span> in <span>Europe</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>associations</span> of <span>soapmakers</span> <span>guarded</span> their <span>trade</span> <span>secrets</span> <span>closely</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Vegetable</span> and <span>animal</span> <span>oils</span> were used with <span>ashes</span> of <span>plants</span>,<br/>
🎧 along with <span>perfume</span>, <span>apparently</span> for the first time.<br/>
🎧 <span>Gradually</span> more <span>varieties</span> of <span>soap</span> <span>became</span> <span>available</span> for <span>shaving</span> and <span>shampooing</span>,<br/>
🎧 as well as <span>bathing</span> and <span>laundering</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>major</span> <span>step</span> <span>toward</span> <span>large-scale</span> <span>commercial</span> <span>soapmaking</span> <span>occurred</span> in <span>1791</span>,<br/>
🎧 when a <span>French</span> <span>chemist</span>, <span>Nicholas</span> <span>Leblanc</span>, <span>patented</span> a <span>process</span> for <span>turning</span> <span>salt</span> into <span>soda</span> <span>ash</span>,<br/>
🎧 or <span>sodium</span> <span>carbonate</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Soda</span> <span>ash</span> is the <span>alkali</span> <span>obtained</span> from <span>ashes</span> that <span>combines</span> with fat to <span>form</span> <span>soap</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Leblanc</span> <span>process</span> <span>yielded</span> <span>quantities</span> of <span>good-quality</span>, <span>inexpensive</span> <span>soda</span> <span>ash</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Modern</span> <span>soapmaking</span> was <span>born</span> some <span>20</span> years later,<br/>
🎧 in the <span>early</span> <span>19th</span> <span>century</span>,<br/>
🎧 with the <span>discovery</span> by <span>Michel</span> <span>Eugene</span> <span>Chevreul</span>, another <span>French</span> <span>chemist</span>,<br/>
🎧 of the <span>chemical</span> <span>nature</span> and <span>relationship</span> of <span>fats</span>, <span>glycerine</span> and <span>fatty</span> <span>acids</span>.<br/>
🎧 His <span>studies</span> <span>established</span> the <span>basis</span> for both fat and <span>soap</span> <span>chemistry</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>soapmaking</span> <span>became</span> a <span>science</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Further</span> <span>developments</span> during the <span>19th</span> <span>century</span> made it <span>easier</span> and <span>cheaper</span> to <span>manufacture</span> <span>soap</span>.<br/>
🎧 Until the <span>19th</span> <span>century</span>, <span>soap</span> was <span>regarded</span> as a <span>luxury</span> <span>item</span>,<br/>
🎧 and was <span>heavily</span> <span>taxed</span> in <span>several</span> <span>countries</span>.<br/>
🎧 As it <span>became</span> more <span>readily</span> <span>available</span>, it <span>became</span> an everyday <span>necessity</span>,<br/>
🎧 a <span>development</span> that was <span>reinforced</span> when the high <span>tax</span> was <span>removed</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Soap</span> was then something <span>ordinary</span> people could <span>afford</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>cleanliness</span> <span>standards</span> <span>improved</span>.<br/>
🎧 With this <span>widespread</span> use came the <span>development</span> of <span>milder</span> <span>soaps</span> for <span>bathing<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>soaps</span> for use in the <span>washing</span> <span>machines</span> that were <span>available</span> to <span>consumers</span> by the <span>turn</span> of the <span>20th</span> <span>century</span>.<br/>
