🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 Thanks for coming in to see us here at the agency, Joe.<br/>
🎧 I'm one of the agency representatives, and my name's Sally Baker.<br/>
🎧 Hi Sally. I think we spoke on the phone, didn't we?<br/>
🎧 That's right, we did.<br/>
🎧 So thank you for sending in your CV.<br/>
🎧 We've had quite a careful look at it<br/>
🎧 and I think we have two jobs that might be suitable for you.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 The first one is in a company based in North London.<br/>
🎧 They're looking for an administrative assistant.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 What sort of company is it?<br/>
🎧 They're called Home Solutions<br/>
🎧 and they design and make furniture.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I don't know much about that,<br/>
🎧 but it sounds interesting.<br/>
🎧 Yes, well as I said, they want someone in their office,<br/>
🎧 and looking at your past experience<br/>
🎧 it does look as if you fit quite a few of the requirements.<br/>
🎧 So on your CV it appears you've done some data entry?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 So that's one skill they want.<br/>
🎧 Then they expect the person they appoint to attend meetings and take notes there…<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 I've done that before, yes.<br/>
🎧 And you'd need to be able to cope with general admin.<br/>
🎧 Filing, and keeping records and so on?<br/>
🎧 That should be OK.<br/>
🎧 And in my last job I also had to manage the diary.<br/>
🎧 Excellent.<br/>
🎧 That's something they want here too.<br/>
🎧 I'd suggest you add it to your CV.<br/>
🎧 I don't think you mentioned that, did you?<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 So as far as the requirements go, they want good computer skills, of course,<br/>
🎧 and they particularly mention spreadsheets.<br/>
🎧 That should be fine.<br/>
🎧 And interpersonal skills,<br/>
🎧 which would be something they'd check with your references.<br/>
🎧 I think that should be OK, yes.<br/>
🎧 Then they mention that they want someone who is careful and takes care with details.<br/>
🎧 Just looking at your CV, I'd say you're probably alright there.<br/>
🎧 I think so, yes.<br/>
🎧 Do they want any special experience?<br/>
🎧 I think they wanted some experience of teleconferencing.<br/>
🎧 I've got three years' experience of that.<br/>
🎧 Let's see, yes, good.<br/>
🎧 In fact they're only asking for at least one year, so that's great.<br/>
🎧 So is that something that might interest you?<br/>
🎧 It is, yes.<br/>
🎧 The only thing is, you said they were in North London<br/>
🎧 so it would be quite a long commute for me.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So the second position might suit you better as far as the location goes;<br/>
🎧 that's for a warehouse assistant and that's in South London.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that would be a lot closer.<br/>
🎧 And you've worked in a warehouse before, haven't you?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 So as far as the responsibilities for this position go,<br/>
🎧 they want someone who can manage the stock, obviously, and also deliveries.<br/>
🎧 That should be OK.<br/>
🎧 You've got to keep track of stuff,<br/>
🎧 but I've always been quite good with numbers.<br/>
🎧 Good, that's their first requirement.<br/>
🎧 And they want someone who's computer literate, which we know you are.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 Then they mention organisational skills.<br/>
🎧 They want someone who's well organised.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I think I am.<br/>
🎧 And tidy?<br/>
🎧 Yes, they go together really, don't they?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 Then the usual stuff; they want someone who can communicate well both orally and in writing.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And for the last warehouse job I had,<br/>
🎧 one of the things I enjoyed most was being part of a team.<br/>
🎧 I found that was really essential for the job.<br/>
🎧 Excellent.<br/>
🎧 Yes, they do mention that they want someone who's used to that, yes.<br/>
🎧 Now when you were working in a warehouse last time,<br/>
🎧 what sorts of items were you dealing with?<br/>
🎧 It was mostly bathroom and kitchen equipment,<br/>
🎧 sinks and stoves and fridges.<br/>
🎧 So you're OK moving heavy things?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 I'm quite strong, and I've had the training.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 Now as far as experience goes, they mention they want someone with a licence,<br/>
🎧 and that you have experience of driving in London -<br/>
🎧 so you can cope with the traffic and so on.<br/>
🎧 Yes, no problem.<br/>
🎧 And you've got experience of warehouse work…<br/>
🎧 and the final thing they mention is customer service.<br/>
🎧 I think looking at your CV you're OK there.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So what about pay?<br/>
🎧 Can you tell me a bit more about that, please…<br/>
<br />

🎧 My guest on the show today is Alice Riches<br/>
🎧 who started the Street Play Scheme where she lives in Beechwood Road.<br/>
🎧 For those of you that don't already know,<br/>
🎧 Street Play involves local residents closing off their street for a few hours<br/>
🎧 so that children have a chance to play in the street safely.<br/>
🎧 She started it in her own street, Beechwood Road,<br/>
🎧 and the idea caught on,<br/>
🎧 and there are now Street Play Schemes all over the city.<br/>
🎧 So when did you actually start the scheme, Alice?<br/>
🎧 Well, I first had the idea when my oldest child was still a toddler,<br/>
🎧 so that's about six years ago now,<br/>
🎧 but it took at least two years of campaigning before we were actually able to make it happen.<br/>
🎧 So the scheme's been up and running for three years now.<br/>
🎧 We'd love to be able to close our road for longer,<br/>
🎧 for the whole weekend, from Saturday morning until Sunday evening, for example.<br/>
🎧 At the moment it's just once a week.<br/>
🎧 But when we started it was only once a month.<br/>
🎧 But we're working on it.<br/>
🎧 So what actually happens when Beechwood Road is closed?<br/>
🎧 We have volunteer wardens,<br/>
🎧 mostly parents but some elderly residents too,<br/>
🎧 who block off our road at either end.<br/>
🎧 The council have provided special signs<br/>
🎧 but there's always a volunteer there to explain what's happening to any motorists.<br/>
🎧 Generally, they're fine about it,<br/>
🎧 we've only had to get the police involved once or twice.<br/>
🎧 Now I should explain that the road isn't completely closed to cars.<br/>
🎧 But only residents' cars are allowed.<br/>
🎧 If people really need to get in or out of Beechwood Road,<br/>
🎧 it's not a problem,<br/>
🎧 as long as they drive at under 20 kilometres per hour.<br/>
🎧 But most people just decide not to use their cars during this time,<br/>
🎧 or they park in another street.<br/>
🎧 The wardens are only there to stop through traffic.<br/>
🎧 So can anyone apply to get involved in Street Play?<br/>
🎧 Absolutely!<br/>
🎧 We want to include all kids in the city,<br/>
🎧 especially those who live on busy roads.<br/>
🎧 It's here that demand is greatest.<br/>
🎧 Obviously, there isn't such demand in wealthier areas<br/>
🎧 where the children have access to parks or large gardens,<br/>
🎧 or in the suburbs where there are usually more places for children to play outside.<br/>
🎧 I'd recommend that anyone listening who likes the idea should just give it a go.<br/>
🎧 We've been surprised by the positive reaction of residents all over the city.<br/>
🎧 And that's not just parents.<br/>
🎧 There are always a few who complain but they're a tiny minority.<br/>
🎧 On the whole everyone is very supportive<br/>
🎧 and say they're very happy to see children out on the street,<br/>
🎧 even if it does get quite noisy.<br/>
🎧 There have been so many benefits of Street Play for the kids.<br/>
🎧 Parents really like the fact that the kids are getting fresh air<br/>
🎧 instead of sitting staring at a computer screen,<br/>
🎧 even if they're not doing anything particularly energetic.<br/>
🎧 And of course it's great that kids can play with their friends outside without being supervised by their parents,<br/>
🎧 but for me the biggest advantage is that kids develop confidence in themselves to be outside without their parents.<br/>
🎧 The other really fantastic thing is that children get to know the adults in the street,<br/>
🎧 it's like having a big extended family.<br/>
🎧 It certainly does have a lot of benefits.<br/>
🎧 I want to move on now and ask you about a related project in King Street.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Well this was an experiment I was involved in<br/>
🎧 where local residents decided to try and reduce the traffic along King Street,<br/>
🎧 which is the busiest main road in our area,<br/>
🎧 by persuading people not to use their cars for one day.<br/>
🎧 We thought about making people pay more for parking,<br/>
🎧 but we decided that would be really unpopular,<br/>
🎧 so instead we just stopped people from parking on King Street<br/>
🎧 but left the other car parks open.<br/>
🎧 It was surprising how much of a difference all this made.<br/>
🎧 As we'd predicted, air quality was significantly better<br/>
🎧 but what I hadn't expected was how much quieter it would be,<br/>
🎧 even with the buses still running.<br/>
🎧 Of course everyone said they felt safer<br/>
🎧 but we were actually amazed that sales in the shops went up considerably that day,<br/>
🎧 we thought there'd be fewer people out shopping, not more.<br/>
🎧 That's really interesting...<br/>
<br />

🎧 Tom, could I ask you for some advice, please?<br/>
🎧 Yes of course, if you think I can help.<br/>
🎧 What's it about?<br/>
🎧 It's my first media studies assignment, and I'm not sure how to go about it.<br/>
🎧 You must have done it last year.<br/>
🎧 Is that the one comparing the coverage of a particular story in a range of newspapers?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, I really enjoyed writing it.<br/>
🎧 So what sort of things do I need to compare?<br/>
🎧 Well, there are several things.<br/>
🎧 For example, there's the question of which page of the newspaper the item appears on.<br/>
🎧 You mean, because there's a big difference between having it on the front page and the bottom of page ten, for instance?<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 And that shows how important the editor thinks the story is.<br/>
🎧 Then there's the size:<br/>
🎧 how many column inches the story is given,<br/>
🎧 how many columns it spreads over.<br/>
🎧 And I suppose that includes the headline.<br/>
🎧 It certainly does.<br/>
🎧 It's all part of attracting the reader's attention.<br/>
🎧 What about graphics -<br/>
🎧 whether there's anything visual in addition to the text?<br/>
🎧 Yes, you need to consider those, too,<br/>
🎧 because they can have a big effect on the reader's understanding of the story -<br/>
🎧 sometimes a bigger effect than the text itself.<br/>
🎧 Then you'll need to look at how the item is put together:<br/>
🎧 what structure is it given?<br/>
🎧 Bear in mind that not many people read beyond the first paragraph,<br/>
🎧 so what has the journalist put at the beginning?<br/>
🎧 And if, say, there are conflicting opinions about something,<br/>
🎧 does one appear near the end, where people probably won't read it?<br/>
🎧 And newspapers sometimes give wrong or misleading information, don't they?<br/>
🎧 Either deliberately or by accident.<br/>
🎧 Should I be looking at that, too?<br/>
🎧 Yes, if you can.<br/>
🎧 Compare what's in different versions, and as far as possible,<br/>
🎧 try and work out what's true and what isn't.<br/>
🎧 And that relates to a very important point:<br/>
🎧 what's the writer's purpose,<br/>
🎧 or at least the most important one, if they have several.<br/>
🎧 It may seem to be to inform the public,<br/>
🎧 but often it's that they want to create fear, or controversy,<br/>
🎧 or to make somebody look ridiculous.<br/>
🎧 Gosh, I see what you mean.<br/>
🎧 I suppose the writer may make assumptions about the reader.<br/>
🎧 That's right - about their knowledge of the subject, their attitudes, and their level of education,<br/>
🎧 which means writing so that the readers understand without feeling patronised.<br/>
🎧 All of that will make a difference to how the story is presented.<br/>
🎧 Does it matter what type of story I write about?<br/>
🎧 No, national or international politics, the arts… anything,<br/>
🎧 as long as it's covered in two or three newspapers.<br/>
🎧 Though of course it'll be easier and more fun if it's something you're interested in and know something about.<br/>
🎧 And on that basis a national news item would be worth analysing -<br/>
🎧 I'm quite keen on politics, so I'll try and find a suitable topic.<br/>
🎧 What did you choose for your analysis, Tom?<br/>
🎧 I was interested in how newspapers express their opinions explicitly,<br/>
🎧 so I wanted to compare editorials in different papers,<br/>
🎧 but when I started looking,<br/>
🎧 I couldn't find two on the same topic that I felt like analysing.<br/>
🎧 In that case, I won't even bother to look.<br/>
🎧 So in the end I chose a human interest story -<br/>
🎧 a terribly emotional story about a young girl who was very ill,<br/>
🎧 and lots of other people - mostly strangers -<br/>
🎧 raised money so she could go abroad for treatment.<br/>
🎧 Actually, I was surprised -<br/>
🎧 some papers just wrote about how wonderful everyone was,<br/>
🎧 but others considered the broader picture,<br/>
🎧 like why treatment wasn't available here.<br/>
🎧 Hmm, I usually find stories like that raise quite strong feelings in me!<br/>
🎧 I'll avoid that.<br/>
🎧 Perhaps I'll choose an arts topic,<br/>
🎧 like different reviews of a film, or something about funding for the arts -<br/>
🎧 I'll think about that.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that might be interesting.<br/>
🎧 OK, well thanks a lot for your help, Tom. It's been really useful.<br/>
🎧 You're welcome.<br/>
🎧 Good luck with the assignment, Hazel.<br/>
<br />

🎧 Nowadays, we use different products for personal cleanliness, laundry, dishwashing and household cleaning,<br/>
🎧 but this is very much a 20th-century development.<br/>
🎧 The origins of cleanliness date back to prehistoric times.<br/>
🎧 Since water is essential for life,<br/>
🎧 the earliest people lived near water and knew something about its cleansing properties -<br/>
🎧 at least that it rinsed mud off their hands.<br/>
🎧 During the excavation of ancient Babylon,<br/>
🎧 evidence was found that soapmaking was known as early as 2800 BC.<br/>
🎧 Archaeologists discovered cylinders made of clay,<br/>
🎧 with inscriptions on them saying that fats were boiled with ashes.<br/>
🎧 This is a method of making soap,<br/>
🎧 though there's no reference to the purpose of this material.<br/>
🎧 The early Greeks bathed for aesthetic reasons and apparently didn't use soap.<br/>
🎧 Instead, they cleaned their bodies with blocks of sand, pumice and ashes,<br/>
🎧 then anointed themselves with oil,<br/>
🎧 and scraped off the oil and dirt with a metal instrument known as a strigil.<br/>
🎧 They also used oil mixed with ashes.<br/>
🎧 Clothes were washed without soap in streams.<br/>
🎧 The ancient Germans and Gauls are also credited with discovering how to make a substance called 'soap',<br/>
🎧 made of melted animal fat and ashes.<br/>
🎧 They used this mixture to tint their hair red.<br/>
🎧 Soap got its name, according to an ancient Roman legend, from Mount Sapo,<br/>
🎧 where animals were sacrificed, leaving deposits of animal fat.<br/>
🎧 Rain washed these deposits, along with wood ashes,<br/>
🎧 down into the clay soil along the River Tiber.<br/>
🎧 Women found that this mixture greatly reduced the effort required to wash their clothes.<br/>
🎧 As Roman civilisation advanced, so did bathing.<br/>
🎧 The first of the famous Roman baths, supplied with water from their aqueducts,<br/>
🎧 was built around 312 BC.<br/>
🎧 The baths were luxurious, and bathing became very popular.<br/>
🎧 And by the second century AD,<br/>
🎧 the Greek physician Galen recommended soap for both medicinal and cleansing purposes.<br/>
🎧 After the fall of Rome in 467 AD<br/>
🎧 and the resulting decline in bathing habits,<br/>
🎧 much of Europe felt the impact of filth on public health.<br/>
🎧 This lack of personal cleanliness and related unsanitary living conditions<br/>
🎧 were major factors in the outbreaks of disease in the Middle Ages,<br/>
🎧 and especially the Black Death of the 14th century.<br/>
🎧 Nevertheless, soapmaking became an established craft in Europe,<br/>
🎧 and associations of soapmakers guarded their trade secrets closely.<br/>
🎧 Vegetable and animal oils were used with ashes of plants,<br/>
🎧 along with perfume, apparently for the first time.<br/>
🎧 Gradually more varieties of soap became available for shaving and shampooing,<br/>
🎧 as well as bathing and laundering.<br/>
🎧 A major step toward large-scale commercial soapmaking occurred in 1791,<br/>
🎧 when a French chemist, Nicholas Leblanc, patented a process for turning salt into soda ash,<br/>
🎧 or sodium carbonate.<br/>
🎧 Soda ash is the alkali obtained from ashes that combines with fat to form soap.<br/>
🎧 The Leblanc process yielded quantities of good-quality, inexpensive soda ash.<br/>
🎧 Modern soapmaking was born some 20 years later,<br/>
🎧 in the early 19th century,<br/>
🎧 with the discovery by Michel Eugene Chevreul, another French chemist,<br/>
🎧 of the chemical nature and relationship of fats, glycerine and fatty acids.<br/>
🎧 His studies established the basis for both fat and soap chemistry,<br/>
🎧 and soapmaking became a science.<br/>
🎧 Further developments during the 19th century made it easier and cheaper to manufacture soap.<br/>
🎧 Until the 19th century, soap was regarded as a luxury item,<br/>
🎧 and was heavily taxed in several countries.<br/>
🎧 As it became more readily available, it became an everyday necessity,<br/>
🎧 a development that was reinforced when the high tax was removed.<br/>
🎧 Soap was then something ordinary people could afford,<br/>
🎧 and cleanliness standards improved.<br/>
🎧 With this widespread use came the development of milder soaps for bathing<br/>
🎧 and soaps for use in the washing machines that were available to consumers by the turn of the 20th century.<br/>
<br/><br/>
