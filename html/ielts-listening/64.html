🎧 Hello?<br/>
🎧 Oh, hello. Is that <span>Julie</span> <span>Davison</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 This is <span>Greg</span> <span>Preston</span> from the <span>Employment</span> <span>Agency</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>met</span> last week when you came in to <span>enquire</span> about <span>office</span> work.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's right.<br/>
🎧 Now we've just had some <span>details</span> come in of a <span>job</span> which might <span>interest</span> you.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So this is a <span>position</span> for a <span>receptionist</span>,<br/>
🎧 I <span>believe</span> you've done that <span>sort</span> of work before?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I have,<br/>
🎧 I <span>worked</span> in a <span>sports</span> <span>centre</span> for a <span>couple</span> of years before I got <span>married</span> and had the children.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Well, this <span>job's</span> in <span>Fordham</span>, so not too <span>far</span> away for you,<br/>
🎧 and it's at the <span>medical</span> <span>centre</span> there.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So where exactly is that?<br/>
🎧 It's quite near the <span>station</span>, on <span>Chastons</span> <span>Road</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sorry?<br/>
🎧 <span>Chastons</span> <span>Road</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's <span>C-H-A-S-T-O-N-S</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, thanks.<br/>
🎧 So what would the work <span>involve</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Dealing</span> with <span>enquiries</span> from <span>patients</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes,<br/>
🎧 and you'd also be <span>involved</span> in <span>making</span> <span>appointments</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>whether</span> <span>face</span> to <span>face</span> or on the phone.<br/>
🎧 And <span>rescheduling</span> them if <span>necessary</span>.<br/>
🎧 Fine, that shouldn't be a <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 And another of your <span>duties</span> would be <span>keeping</span> the <span>centre's</span> <span>database</span> <span>up-to-date</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then you might have other <span>general</span> <span>administrative</span> <span>duties</span> as well,<br/>
🎧 but those would be the <span>main</span> <span>ones</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Now when the <span>details</span> came in, I <span>immediately</span> thought of <span>you<br/></span>
🎧 because one thing they do <span>require</span> is <span>someone</span> with <span>experience</span>,<br/>
🎧 and you did <span>mention</span> your work at the <span>sports</span> <span>centre</span> when you came in to see us.<br/>
🎧 Yes, in <span>fact</span> I <span>enjoyed</span> that <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is there anything else they're looking for?<br/>
🎧 Well, they say it's quite a <span>high-pressure</span> <span>environment</span>,<br/>
🎧 they're always very <span>busy</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>patients</span> are often under <span>stress</span>,<br/>
🎧 so they want <span>someone</span> who can <span>cope</span> with that and <span>stay</span> <span>calm</span>,<br/>
🎧 and at the same time be <span>confident</span> when <span>interacting</span> with the <span>public</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, after <span>dealing</span> with <span>three</span> children all under <span>five</span>,<br/>
🎧 I <span>reckon</span> I can <span>cope</span> with that.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you can.<br/>
🎧 And then another thing they <span>mention</span> is that they're looking for <span>someone</span> with good IT <span>skills..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Not a <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 So you'd be interested in <span>following</span> this up?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 When would it start?<br/>
🎧 Well, they're looking for <span>someone</span> from the <span>beginning</span> of next month,<br/>
🎧 but I should tell you that this isn't a <span>permanent</span> <span>job</span>,<br/>
🎧 it's <span>temporary</span>, so the <span>contract</span> would be just to the end of <span>September</span>.<br/>
🎧 But they do say that there could be <span>further</span> <span>opportunities</span> after that.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And what would the hours be?<br/>
🎧 Well, they want <span>someone</span> who can start at <span>7:45</span> in the morning.<br/>
🎧 Could you <span>manage</span> that?<br/>
🎧 Yes, my <span>husband</span> would have to get the <span>kids</span> up and off to my <span>mother's</span>,<br/>
🎧 she's going to be looking after them while I'm at work.<br/>
🎧 What time would I <span>finish</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>1:15<br/></span>
🎧 That should work out all right.<br/>
🎧 I can <span>pick</span> the <span>kids</span> up on my way home,<br/>
🎧 and then I'll have the <span>afternoon</span> with them.<br/>
🎧 Oh, one <span>thing..</span>.<br/>
🎧 is there <span>parking</span> <span>available</span> for <span>staff</span> at the <span>centre</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, there is.<br/>
🎧 and it's also on a bus <span>route</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Well, I <span>expect</span> I'll have the car but it's good to know that.<br/>
🎧 OK, so where do I go from here?<br/>
🎧 Well, if you're happy for me to do so,<br/>
🎧 I'll forward your <span>CV</span> and <span>references</span>,<br/>
🎧 and then the best thing would probably be for you to phone <span>them<br/></span>
🎧 so they can <span>arrange</span> for an <span>interview</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great. Well thank you very much.<br/>
🎧 You're <span>welcome</span>. Bye now.<br/>
🎧 Bye.<br/>

🎧 Good morning everyone, and <span>welcome</span> to the <span>Museum</span> of <span>Farming</span> Life.<br/>
🎧 I <span>understand</span> it's your first visit here,<br/>
🎧 so I'd like to give you some <span>background</span> <span>information</span> about the <span>museum<br/></span>
🎧 and then <span>explain</span> a little about what you can see during your visit.<br/>
🎧 So, where we're <span>standing</span> at the <span>moment</span> is the <span>entrance</span> to a large <span>building<br/></span>
🎧 that was <span>constructed</span> in <span>1880<br/></span>
🎧 as the home of a <span>local</span> <span>businessman</span>, <span>Alfred</span> <span>Palmer</span>, of the <span>Palmer</span> <span>biscuit</span> <span>factory</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was later <span>sold</span> and <span>became</span> a <span>hall</span> of <span>residence</span> for students in <span>1911</span>,<br/>
🎧 and a <span>museum</span> in <span>1951</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>2005</span>, a <span>modern</span> <span>extension</span> was <span>built</span> to <span>accommodate</span> the <span>museum's</span> <span>collections</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>museum's</span> <span>owned</span> by the university,<br/>
🎧 and <span>apart</span> from two <span>rooms</span> that are our <span>offices</span>,<br/>
🎧 the university <span>uses</span> the <span>main</span> <span>part</span> of the <span>building</span>.<br/>
🎧 You may see students going into the <span>building</span> for <span>lessons</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it's not open to <span>museum</span> <span>visitors</span>, I'm <span>afraid</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>shame</span> because the <span>interior</span> <span>architectural</span> <span>features</span> are <span>outstanding</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>especially</span> the room that used to be the <span>library</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Luckily</span>, we've <span>managed</span> to keep <span>entry</span> to the <span>museum</span> free.<br/>
🎧 This <span>includes</span> <span>access</span> to all the <span>galleries</span>, <span>outdoor</span> <span>areas</span> and the <span>rooms</span> for special <span>exhibitions</span>.<br/>
🎧 We run <span>activities</span> for children and students,<br/>
🎧 such as the <span>museum</span> <span>club</span>, for which there's no <span>charge</span>.<br/>
🎧 We do have a <span>donation</span> box just over <span>there<br/></span>
🎧 so feel free to give whatever amount you <span>consider</span> <span>appropriate</span>.<br/>
🎧 We do have a <span>cloakroom</span>,<br/>
🎧 if you'd like to leave your <span>coats</span> and <span>bags</span> somewhere.<br/>
🎧 <span>Unlike</span> other <span>museums</span>, <span>photography</span> is <span>allowed</span> here,<br/>
🎧 so you might like to keep your <span>cameras</span> with you.<br/>
🎧 You might be more <span>comfortable</span> not <span>carrying</span> around <span>heavy</span> <span>rucksacks</span>,<br/>
🎧 though keep your <span>coats</span> and <span>jackets</span> on as it's quite <span>cold</span> in the <span>museum</span> garden today.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to tell you about the different <span>areas</span> of the <span>museum</span>.<br/>
🎧 Just inside, and outside the <span>main</span> <span>gallery</span>,<br/>
🎧 we have an <span>area</span> called <span>Four</span> <span>Seasons</span>.<br/>
🎧 Here you can <span>watch</span> a <span>four-minute</span> <span>animation</span> of a <span>woodland</span> <span>scene</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>designed</span> <span>especially</span> for the <span>museum<br/></span>
🎧 by a group of young people on a <span>film</span> <span>studies</span> course, and it's <span>beautiful</span>.<br/>
🎧 Children absolutely love it, but then, so do <span>adults</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>main</span> <span>gallery's</span> called <span>Town</span> and <span>Country</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>includes</span> a <span>photographic</span> <span>collection</span> of <span>prize-winning</span> <span>sheep</span> and <span>shepherds</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Leaving</span> <span>Town</span> and <span>Country</span>, you <span>enter</span> <span>Farmhouse</span> <span>Kitchen</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>is..</span>. well, <span>self-explanatory</span>.<br/>
🎧 Here we have the <span>oldest</span> <span>collection</span> of <span>equipment</span> for <span>making</span> <span>butter</span> and <span>cheese</span> in the <span>country</span>.<br/>
🎧 And this morning, a <span>specialist</span> <span>cheesemaker</span> will be <span>giving</span> <span>demonstrations</span> of how it's <span>produced</span>.<br/>
🎧 You may even get to try some.<br/>
🎧 After that, you can go in two <span>directions</span>.<br/>
🎧 To the right is a <span>staircase<br/></span>
🎧 that takes you up to a <span>landing</span> from where you can look down on the <span>galleries</span>.<br/>
🎧 To the <span>left</span> is a room called A Year on the <span>Farm</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's lots of <span>seating</span> here as sometimes we use the room for school <span>visits</span>,<br/>
🎧 so it's a good place to <span>stop</span> for a <span>rest</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you're feeling <span>competitive</span>,<br/>
🎧 you can take our <span>memory</span> <span>test</span> in which you answer <span>questions</span> about things you've <span>seen</span> in the <span>museum</span>.<br/>
🎧 The next <span>area's</span> called <span>Wagon</span> <span>Walk</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>contains</span> <span>farm</span> <span>carts</span> from <span>nearly</span> every <span>part</span> of the <span>country</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>surprising</span> how much <span>regional</span> <span>variation</span> there was.<br/>
🎧 <span>Beside</span> the <span>carts</span> are <span>display</span> <span>boards</span> with <span>information</span> about each one.<br/>
🎧 The <span>carts</span> are old and <span>fragile</span>,<br/>
🎧 so we ask you to keep your children <span>close</span> to <span>you<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>ensure</span> they don't <span>climb</span> on the <span>carts</span>.<br/>
🎧 From <span>Wagon</span> <span>Walk</span>, you can either make your way back to <span>reception<br/></span>
🎧 or go out into the <span>garden<br/></span>
🎧 or even go back to take another look in the <span>galleries</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>far</span> <span>corner</span> of the garden is <span>Bees</span> are <span>Magic</span>,<br/>
🎧 but we're <span>redeveloping</span> this <span>area</span> so you can't visit that at the <span>moment</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can still buy our <span>honey</span> in the <span>shop</span>, though.<br/>
🎧 Finally, there's The <span>Pond</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>contains</span> all <span>kinds</span> of <span>interesting</span> <span>wildlife</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>baby</span> <span>ducks</span> that are only a few <span>days</span> old, as well as <span>tiny</span> <span>frogs</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Pond</span> isn't <span>deep</span> and there's a <span>fence</span> around it,<br/>
🎧 so it's <span>perfectly</span> <span>safe</span> for children.<br/>

🎧 So now I want you to <span>discuss</span> the <span>lesson</span> we've just been watching on the <span>video<br/></span>
🎧 and think about the <span>ways</span> in which <span>origami</span> can be a <span>useful</span> <span>educational</span> <span>tool</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can you all work with the person <span>sitting</span> next to <span>you..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I had no idea that such a simple thing like <span>folding</span> <span>squares</span> of <span>paper</span> to make the <span>shape</span> of something like a <span>bird</span> could be such an amazing <span>tool</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's made me see <span>origami</span> in a whole new <span>light</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>interesting</span> to see the <span>educational</span> <span>skills</span> the children were <span>developing</span> by doing <span>origami</span>.<br/>
🎧 On the <span>video</span> you could see them really <span>listening</span> <span>hard<br/></span>
🎧 to make sure they did all the <span>steps</span> in the right order to make the <span>bird</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 In this <span>lesson</span> they were working <span>individually<br/></span>
🎧 but it would also be <span>interesting</span> to see if the children could work out how to make something <span>simple<br/></span>
🎧 without being <span>given</span> any <span>direction</span>.<br/>
🎧 That would help with <span>building</span> <span>teamwork</span> as well.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but much more of a <span>challenge</span>.<br/>
🎧 One thing that really <span>stood</span> out for me was that the children were all having fun while being <span>taught</span> something new.<br/>
🎧 Which is a key <span>aim</span> of any <span>lesson</span> with this age group.<br/>
🎧 And although these <span>kids</span> had no <span>problems</span> with <span>folding</span> the <span>paper</span>,<br/>
🎧 with <span>younger</span> children you could do <span>origami</span> to help <span>practise</span> fine <span>motor</span> <span>skills</span>.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely.<br/>
🎧 Shall we talk about the <span>individual</span> children we saw on the <span>video</span>?<br/>
🎧 I <span>wrote</span> all their <span>names</span> down and took some <span>notes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I did too.<br/>
🎧 OK, good.<br/>
🎧 Let's start with <span>Sid</span>.<br/>
🎧 He was <span>interesting</span> because before they <span>started</span> doing the <span>origami</span>, he was being quite <span>disruptive</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 He really <span>benefited</span> from having to use his <span>hands</span>,<br/>
🎧 it <span>helped</span> him to <span>settle</span> down and start <span>concentrating</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I <span>noticed</span> that too.<br/>
🎧 What about <span>Jack</span>?<br/>
🎧 I <span>noticed</span> he <span>seemed</span> to want to work things out for <span>himself</span>.<br/>
🎧 You could see him trying out different things rather than <span>asking</span> the <span>teacher</span> for help.<br/>
🎧 What did you make of <span>Naomi</span>?<br/>
🎧 She <span>seemed</span> to be <span>losing</span> <span>interest</span> at one <span>point<br/></span>
🎧 but then she <span>decided</span> she wanted her <span>mouse</span> to be the <span>best<br/></span>
🎧 and that <span>motivated</span> her to try <span>harder</span>.<br/>
🎧 She didn't <span>seem</span> <span>satisfied</span> with <span>hers</span> in the end, though.<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anya</span> was such a <span>star</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>listened</span> so <span>carefully<br/></span>
🎧 and then <span>produced</span> the perfect <span>bird</span> with very little <span>effort</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think the <span>teacher</span> could have <span>increased</span> the <span>level</span> of <span>difficulty</span> for her.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm..</span>. maybe.<br/>
🎧 I think it was the first time <span>Zara</span> had come across <span>origami</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>looked</span> as if she didn't really get what was going on.<br/>
🎧 She <span>seemed</span> <span>unsure</span> about what she was <span>supposed</span> to do.<br/>
🎧 but in the end <span>hers</span> didn't <span>turn</span> out too <span>badly</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. I'm sure it was a <span>positive</span> <span>learning</span> <span>experience</span> for her.<br/>
🎧 I think one <span>reason</span> why the <span>origami</span> <span>activity</span> <span>worked</span> so well in this <span>class<br/></span>
🎧 was that the <span>teacher</span> was well <span>prepared</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I think it would have taken me <span>ages</span> to <span>prepare</span> <span>examples</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>showing</span> each of the <span>steps</span> <span>involved</span> in <span>making</span> the <span>bird</span>.<br/>
🎧 But that was a really good idea.<br/>
🎧 The children could see what they were <span>aiming</span> for,<br/>
🎧 and much better for them to be able to <span>hold</span> something,<br/>
🎧 rather than just looking at <span>pictures</span>.<br/>
🎧 Those <span>physical</span> <span>examples</span> <span>supported</span> her <span>verbal</span> <span>explanations</span> really well.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>strange</span> that <span>origami</span> isn't used more <span>widely</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why do you think that is?<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>teachers</span> may just feel it's not that <span>appealing</span> to children who are used to doing everything on <span>computers</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>especially</span> <span>boys</span>.<br/>
🎧 Even if they're <span>aware</span> of the <span>benefits</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I don't know. It's no different to any other <span>craft</span> <span>activity</span>.<br/>
🎧 I bet it's because so many <span>teachers</span> are <span>clumsy</span> like me.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>true</span>,<br/>
🎧 too much <span>effort</span> <span>required</span> if you're not good with your <span>hands</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>anyway</span>, I think we should try it out in our <span>maths</span> <span>teaching</span> practice with Year <span>3</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can see <span>using</span> <span>origami</span> is a really <span>engaging</span> way of <span>reinforcing</span> <span>children's</span> <span>knowledge</span> of <span>geometric</span> <span>shapes</span>,<br/>
🎧 like they were doing in the <span>video</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I think it would also work really well for <span>presenting</span> <span>fractions</span>, which is <span>coming</span> up soon.<br/>
🎧 Good idea, that's something most of the <span>kids</span> in that class might <span>struggle</span> with.<br/>
🎧 <span>Origami</span> would also be good practice for <span>using</span> <span>symmetry</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I think they did that last <span>term</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, well let's try and get some <span>ideas</span> together and plan the <span>lesson</span> next week.<br/>
🎧 OK, if you <span>could..</span>.<br/>

🎧 The person I've <span>chosen</span> to talk about is the <span>French</span> <span>writer</span> <span>Victor</span> <span>Hugo</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 many people have heard of him because his <span>novel</span>, <span>Les</span> <span>Miserables</span>,<br/>
🎧 which he <span>wrote</span> in <span>1862</span>, is famous around the <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>became</span> a <span>stage</span> <span>musical</span> in the <span>1980s</span>,<br/>
🎧 and a <span>film</span> <span>version</span> was also <span>released</span> in <span>2012</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, some of us, I'm sure, have a <span>pretty</span> <span>general</span> idea of the <span>plot</span>,<br/>
🎧 but we know much less about the <span>author</span>.<br/>
🎧 Today, I'm going to <span>provide</span> a little more <span>insight</span> into this <span>talented</span> <span>man<br/></span>
🎧 and I'm going to talk <span>particularly</span> about the home he had on the <span>island</span> of <span>Guernsey</span> in the <span>British</span> <span>Channel</span> <span>Islands</span>.<br/>
🎧 But first, his <span>early</span> <span>career..</span>.<br/>
🎧 as I've said, he was a <span>writer</span>,<br/>
🎧 he was at the <span>height</span> of his <span>career</span> in <span>Paris<br/></span>
🎧 and he was very <span>highly</span> <span>regarded</span> by his <span>colleagues</span>.<br/>
🎧 As <span>far</span> as <span>literature</span> was <span>concerned</span>,<br/>
🎧 he was the <span>leading</span> <span>figure</span> of the <span>Romantic</span> <span>movement</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, as well as being a <span>literary</span> <span>genius</span>,<br/>
🎧 he also gave many <span>speeches</span> about issues like the <span>level</span> of <span>poverty</span> in his <span>society</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>felt</span> very <span>strongly</span> about <span>this<br/></span>
🎧 and about other <span>areas</span> where change was <span>needed</span>, like <span>education</span>.<br/>
🎧 This kind of <span>outspoken</span> <span>criticism</span> was not well <span>liked</span> by the <span>rulers</span> of <span>France<br/></span>
🎧 and, <span>eventually</span>, the <span>emperor</span> <span>-</span> <span>Napoleon</span> <span>III</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 told <span>Victor</span> <span>Hugo</span> to leave <span>Paris</span> and not <span>return;<br/></span>
🎧 in other <span>words</span>, he <span>sent</span> him into <span>exile</span>.<br/>
🎧 So <span>Victor</span> <span>Hugo</span> was <span>forced</span> to <span>reside</span> in other <span>parts</span> of <span>Europe</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Guernsey</span> was actually his <span>third</span> place of <span>exile<br/></span>
🎧 and he <span>landed</span> there in <span>1855</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>produced</span> a lot while on <span>Guernsey</span> <span>-</span> <span>including</span> <span>Les</span> <span>Miserables</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and to do this, he had to <span>spend</span> a great <span>deal</span> of time in the home that he had there.<br/>
🎧 This was a <span>property</span> that he <span>bought</span> <span>using</span> the money he'd made in <span>France<br/></span>
🎧 from the <span>publication</span> of a <span>collection</span> of his <span>poetry</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was the only <span>property</span> he ever <span>owned</span>, and he was very <span>proud</span> of it.<br/>
🎧 The <span>property</span> <span>Victor</span> <span>Hugo</span> <span>bought</span> on <span>Guernsey</span> was a large, <span>five-storey</span> house in the <span>capital</span> <span>town</span> of <span>St</span> <span>Peter</span> <span>Port<br/></span>
🎧 and he <span>lived</span> there for <span>15</span> years,<br/>
🎧 <span>returning</span> to <span>France</span> in <span>1870</span> when <span>Napoleon's</span> <span>Empire</span> <span>collapsed</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>decorated</span> and <span>furnished</span> each <span>level</span>, or <span>floor</span>, of the house in <span>unique</span> and wonderful <span>ways</span>,<br/>
🎧 and many people <span>consider</span> the inside of the house to be a <span>'work</span> of <span>art'</span>.<br/>
🎧 Today it's a <span>museum</span> that <span>attracts</span> <span>200,000</span> <span>visitors</span> a year.<br/>
🎧 He <span>lived</span> in the house with his <span>family..</span>.<br/>
🎧 and <span>portraits</span> of its <span>members</span> still <span>hang</span> in <span>rooms</span> on the <span>ground</span> <span>floor</span>,<br/>
🎧 along with <span>drawings</span> that he did during his <span>travels</span> that he <span>felt</span> were important to him.<br/>
🎧 In other <span>ground-floor</span> <span>rooms</span>, there are <span>huge</span> <span>tapestries<br/></span>
🎧 that he would've <span>designed</span> and loved.<br/>
🎧 The <span>walls</span> are <span>covered</span> in <span>dark</span> <span>wood</span> <span>panelling</span> that <span>Victor</span> <span>Hugo</span> <span>created</span> <span>himself<br/></span>
🎧 <span>using</span> <span>wooden</span> <span>furniture</span> that he <span>bought</span> in the <span>market</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>items</span> were <span>relatively</span> <span>inexpensive</span>,<br/>
🎧 and he used them to <span>create</span> <span>intricate</span> <span>carvings</span>.<br/>
🎧 They gave an <span>atmosphere</span> on the <span>lower</span> <span>level</span> that was <span>shadowy</span> and rather <span>solemn</span>.<br/>
🎧 On the next <span>level</span> of the house there are two <span>impressive</span> <span>lounges</span>,<br/>
🎧 where he <span>entertained</span> his <span>guests</span>.<br/>
🎧 One <span>lounge</span> has <span>entirely</span> red <span>furnishings</span>,<br/>
🎧 such as <span>sofas</span> and <span>wall</span> <span>coverings</span>, and the other <span>blue</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>strong</span> <span>Chinese</span> <span>influence</span> in these <span>areas<br/></span>
🎧 in things like the <span>wallpaper</span> <span>pattern</span> and the <span>lamps</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 which he would have made <span>himself</span> by <span>copying</span> <span>original</span> <span>versions</span>.<br/>
🎧 His <span>library</span>, where he <span>left</span> many of his <span>favourite</span> books,<br/>
🎧 <span>forms</span> the <span>hallway</span> to the <span>third</span> <span>floor<br/></span>
🎧 and was a <span>comfortable</span> <span>area</span> where he could <span>relax</span> and enjoy his <span>afternoons</span>.<br/>
🎧 And then, at the very top of the house,<br/>
🎧 there's a room called the <span>Lookout</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 called that because it looks out over the <span>harbour</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>contrast</span> to the rather <span>dark</span> <span>lower</span> <span>levels</span>,<br/>
🎧 it's full of <span>light</span> and was like a <span>glass</span> <span>office</span> where he would <span>write</span> until <span>lunchtime</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 often at his <span>desk</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, <span>Victor</span> <span>Hugo</span> was a man of many <span>talents</span>,<br/>
🎧 but he was also <span>true</span> to his <span>values</span>.<br/>
🎧 While living in his house on <span>Guernsey</span>,<br/>
🎧 he <span>entertained</span> many other famous <span>writers</span>,<br/>
🎧 but he also <span>invited</span> a large group of <span>local</span> children from the <span>deprived</span> <span>areas</span> of the <span>island</span> to dinner once a week.<br/>
🎧 What's more, he <span>served</span> them their food,<br/>
🎧 which was an <span>extraordinary</span> <span>gesture</span> for the time <span>period</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>1927</span>, the house was <span>owned</span> by his <span>relatives</span>,<br/>
🎧 and they <span>decided</span> to <span>donate</span> it to the <span>city</span> of <span>Paris</span>.<br/>
🎧 It has since been <span>restored</span> <span>using</span> <span>photographs</span> from the <span>period<br/></span>
🎧 and, as I <span>mentioned</span> <span>earlier</span>, is now a <span>museum</span> that is open to the <span>public</span>.<br/>
