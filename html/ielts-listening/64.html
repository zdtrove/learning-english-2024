🎧 Hello?<br/>
🎧 Oh, hello. Is that Julie</span> Davison</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 This is Greg</span> Preston</span> from the Employment</span> Agency</span>.<br/>
🎧 We met</span> last week when you came in to enquire</span> about office</span> work.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's right.<br/>
🎧 Now we've just had some details</span> come in of a job</span> which might interest</span> you.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So this is a position</span> for a receptionist</span>,<br/>
🎧 I believe</span> you've done that sort</span> of work before?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I have,<br/>
🎧 I worked</span> in a sports</span> centre</span> for a couple</span> of years before I got married</span> and had the children.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Well, this job's</span> in Fordham</span>, so not too far</span> away for you,<br/>
🎧 and it's at the medical</span> centre</span> there.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So where exactly is that?<br/>
🎧 It's quite near the station</span>, on Chastons</span> Road</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sorry?<br/>
🎧 Chastons</span> Road</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's C-H-A-S-T-O-N-S</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, thanks.<br/>
🎧 So what would the work involve</span>?<br/>
🎧 Dealing</span> with enquiries</span> from patients</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes,<br/>
🎧 and you'd also be involved</span> in making</span> appointments</span>,<br/>
🎧 whether</span> face</span> to face</span> or on the phone.<br/>
🎧 And rescheduling</span> them if necessary</span>.<br/>
🎧 Fine, that shouldn't be a problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 And another of your duties</span> would be keeping</span> the centre's</span> database</span> up-to-date</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then you might have other general</span> administrative</span> duties</span> as well,<br/>
🎧 but those would be the main</span> ones</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Now when the details</span> came in, I immediately</span> thought of you<br/></span>
🎧 because one thing they do require</span> is someone</span> with experience</span>,<br/>
🎧 and you did mention</span> your work at the sports</span> centre</span> when you came in to see us.<br/>
🎧 Yes, in fact</span> I enjoyed</span> that job</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is there anything else they're looking for?<br/>
🎧 Well, they say it's quite a high-pressure</span> environment</span>,<br/>
🎧 they're always very busy</span>,<br/>
🎧 and patients</span> are often under stress</span>,<br/>
🎧 so they want someone</span> who can cope</span> with that and stay</span> calm</span>,<br/>
🎧 and at the same time be confident</span> when interacting</span> with the public</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, after dealing</span> with three</span> children all under five</span>,<br/>
🎧 I reckon</span> I can cope</span> with that.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you can.<br/>
🎧 And then another thing they mention</span> is that they're looking for someone</span> with good IT skills..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Not a problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 So you'd be interested in following</span> this up?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 When would it start?<br/>
🎧 Well, they're looking for someone</span> from the beginning</span> of next month,<br/>
🎧 but I should tell you that this isn't a permanent</span> job</span>,<br/>
🎧 it's temporary</span>, so the contract</span> would be just to the end of September</span>.<br/>
🎧 But they do say that there could be further</span> opportunities</span> after that.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And what would the hours be?<br/>
🎧 Well, they want someone</span> who can start at 7:45</span> in the morning.<br/>
🎧 Could you manage</span> that?<br/>
🎧 Yes, my husband</span> would have to get the kids</span> up and off to my mother's</span>,<br/>
🎧 she's going to be looking after them while I'm at work.<br/>
🎧 What time would I finish</span>?<br/>
🎧 1:15<br/></span>
🎧 That should work out all right.<br/>
🎧 I can pick</span> the kids</span> up on my way home,<br/>
🎧 and then I'll have the afternoon</span> with them.<br/>
🎧 Oh, one thing..</span>.<br/>
🎧 is there parking</span> available</span> for staff</span> at the centre</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, there is.<br/>
🎧 and it's also on a bus route</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Well, I expect</span> I'll have the car but it's good to know that.<br/>
🎧 OK, so where do I go from here?<br/>
🎧 Well, if you're happy for me to do so,<br/>
🎧 I'll forward your CV</span> and references</span>,<br/>
🎧 and then the best thing would probably be for you to phone them<br/></span>
🎧 so they can arrange</span> for an interview</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great. Well thank you very much.<br/>
🎧 You're welcome</span>. Bye now.<br/>
🎧 Bye.<br/>

🎧 Good morning everyone, and welcome</span> to the Museum</span> of Farming</span> Life.<br/>
🎧 I understand</span> it's your first visit here,<br/>
🎧 so I'd like to give you some background</span> information</span> about the museum<br/></span>
🎧 and then explain</span> a little about what you can see during your visit.<br/>
🎧 So, where we're standing</span> at the moment</span> is the entrance</span> to a large building<br/></span>
🎧 that was constructed</span> in 1880<br/></span>
🎧 as the home of a local</span> businessman</span>, Alfred</span> Palmer</span>, of the Palmer</span> biscuit</span> factory</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was later sold</span> and became</span> a hall</span> of residence</span> for students in 1911</span>,<br/>
🎧 and a museum</span> in 1951</span>.<br/>
🎧 In 2005</span>, a modern</span> extension</span> was built</span> to accommodate</span> the museum's</span> collections</span>.<br/>
🎧 The museum's</span> owned</span> by the university,<br/>
🎧 and apart</span> from two rooms</span> that are our offices</span>,<br/>
🎧 the university uses</span> the main</span> part</span> of the building</span>.<br/>
🎧 You may see students going into the building</span> for lessons</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it's not open to museum</span> visitors</span>, I'm afraid</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a shame</span> because the interior</span> architectural</span> features</span> are outstanding</span>,<br/>
🎧 especially</span> the room that used to be the library</span>.<br/>
🎧 Luckily</span>, we've managed</span> to keep entry</span> to the museum</span> free.<br/>
🎧 This includes</span> access</span> to all the galleries</span>, outdoor</span> areas</span> and the rooms</span> for special exhibitions</span>.<br/>
🎧 We run activities</span> for children and students,<br/>
🎧 such as the museum</span> club</span>, for which there's no charge</span>.<br/>
🎧 We do have a donation</span> box just over there<br/></span>
🎧 so feel free to give whatever amount you consider</span> appropriate</span>.<br/>
🎧 We do have a cloakroom</span>,<br/>
🎧 if you'd like to leave your coats</span> and bags</span> somewhere.<br/>
🎧 Unlike</span> other museums</span>, photography</span> is allowed</span> here,<br/>
🎧 so you might like to keep your cameras</span> with you.<br/>
🎧 You might be more comfortable</span> not carrying</span> around heavy</span> rucksacks</span>,<br/>
🎧 though keep your coats</span> and jackets</span> on as it's quite cold</span> in the museum</span> garden today.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to tell you about the different areas</span> of the museum</span>.<br/>
🎧 Just inside, and outside the main</span> gallery</span>,<br/>
🎧 we have an area</span> called Four</span> Seasons</span>.<br/>
🎧 Here you can watch</span> a four-minute</span> animation</span> of a woodland</span> scene</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was designed</span> especially</span> for the museum<br/></span>
🎧 by a group of young people on a film</span> studies</span> course, and it's beautiful</span>.<br/>
🎧 Children absolutely love it, but then, so do adults</span>.<br/>
🎧 The main</span> gallery's</span> called Town</span> and Country</span>.<br/>
🎧 It includes</span> a photographic</span> collection</span> of prize-winning</span> sheep</span> and shepherds</span>.<br/>
🎧 Leaving</span> Town</span> and Country</span>, you enter</span> Farmhouse</span> Kitchen</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is..</span>. well, self-explanatory</span>.<br/>
🎧 Here we have the oldest</span> collection</span> of equipment</span> for making</span> butter</span> and cheese</span> in the country</span>.<br/>
🎧 And this morning, a specialist</span> cheesemaker</span> will be giving</span> demonstrations</span> of how it's produced</span>.<br/>
🎧 You may even get to try some.<br/>
🎧 After that, you can go in two directions</span>.<br/>
🎧 To the right is a staircase<br/></span>
🎧 that takes you up to a landing</span> from where you can look down on the galleries</span>.<br/>
🎧 To the left</span> is a room called A Year on the Farm</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's lots of seating</span> here as sometimes we use the room for school visits</span>,<br/>
🎧 so it's a good place to stop</span> for a rest</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you're feeling competitive</span>,<br/>
🎧 you can take our memory</span> test</span> in which you answer questions</span> about things you've seen</span> in the museum</span>.<br/>
🎧 The next area's</span> called Wagon</span> Walk</span>.<br/>
🎧 This contains</span> farm</span> carts</span> from nearly</span> every part</span> of the country</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's surprising</span> how much regional</span> variation</span> there was.<br/>
🎧 Beside</span> the carts</span> are display</span> boards</span> with information</span> about each one.<br/>
🎧 The carts</span> are old and fragile</span>,<br/>
🎧 so we ask you to keep your children close</span> to you<br/></span>
🎧 and ensure</span> they don't climb</span> on the carts</span>.<br/>
🎧 From Wagon</span> Walk</span>, you can either make your way back to reception<br/></span>
🎧 or go out into the garden<br/></span>
🎧 or even go back to take another look in the galleries</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the far</span> corner</span> of the garden is Bees</span> are Magic</span>,<br/>
🎧 but we're redeveloping</span> this area</span> so you can't visit that at the moment</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can still buy our honey</span> in the shop</span>, though.<br/>
🎧 Finally, there's The Pond</span>,<br/>
🎧 which contains</span> all kinds</span> of interesting</span> wildlife</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are baby</span> ducks</span> that are only a few days</span> old, as well as tiny</span> frogs</span>.<br/>
🎧 The Pond</span> isn't deep</span> and there's a fence</span> around it,<br/>
🎧 so it's perfectly</span> safe</span> for children.<br/>

🎧 So now I want you to discuss</span> the lesson</span> we've just been watching on the video<br/></span>
🎧 and think about the ways</span> in which origami</span> can be a useful</span> educational</span> tool</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can you all work with the person sitting</span> next to you..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I had no idea that such a simple thing like folding</span> squares</span> of paper</span> to make the shape</span> of something like a bird</span> could be such an amazing tool</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's made me see origami</span> in a whole new light</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 It was interesting</span> to see the educational</span> skills</span> the children were developing</span> by doing origami</span>.<br/>
🎧 On the video</span> you could see them really listening</span> hard<br/></span>
🎧 to make sure they did all the steps</span> in the right order to make the bird</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 In this lesson</span> they were working individually<br/></span>
🎧 but it would also be interesting</span> to see if the children could work out how to make something simple<br/></span>
🎧 without being given</span> any direction</span>.<br/>
🎧 That would help with building</span> teamwork</span> as well.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but much more of a challenge</span>.<br/>
🎧 One thing that really stood</span> out for me was that the children were all having fun while being taught</span> something new.<br/>
🎧 Which is a key aim</span> of any lesson</span> with this age group.<br/>
🎧 And although these kids</span> had no problems</span> with folding</span> the paper</span>,<br/>
🎧 with younger</span> children you could do origami</span> to help practise</span> fine motor</span> skills</span>.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely.<br/>
🎧 Shall we talk about the individual</span> children we saw on the video</span>?<br/>
🎧 I wrote</span> all their names</span> down and took some notes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I did too.<br/>
🎧 OK, good.<br/>
🎧 Let's start with Sid</span>.<br/>
🎧 He was interesting</span> because before they started</span> doing the origami</span>, he was being quite disruptive</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 He really benefited</span> from having to use his hands</span>,<br/>
🎧 it helped</span> him to settle</span> down and start concentrating</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I noticed</span> that too.<br/>
🎧 What about Jack</span>?<br/>
🎧 I noticed</span> he seemed</span> to want to work things out for himself</span>.<br/>
🎧 You could see him trying out different things rather than asking</span> the teacher</span> for help.<br/>
🎧 What did you make of Naomi</span>?<br/>
🎧 She seemed</span> to be losing</span> interest</span> at one point<br/></span>
🎧 but then she decided</span> she wanted her mouse</span> to be the best<br/></span>
🎧 and that motivated</span> her to try harder</span>.<br/>
🎧 She didn't seem</span> satisfied</span> with hers</span> in the end, though.<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 Anya</span> was such a star</span>.<br/>
🎧 She listened</span> so carefully<br/></span>
🎧 and then produced</span> the perfect bird</span> with very little effort</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think the teacher</span> could have increased</span> the level</span> of difficulty</span> for her.<br/>
🎧 Hmm..</span>. maybe.<br/>
🎧 I think it was the first time Zara</span> had come across origami</span>.<br/>
🎧 She looked</span> as if she didn't really get what was going on.<br/>
🎧 She seemed</span> unsure</span> about what she was supposed</span> to do.<br/>
🎧 but in the end hers</span> didn't turn</span> out too badly</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. I'm sure it was a positive</span> learning</span> experience</span> for her.<br/>
🎧 I think one reason</span> why the origami</span> activity</span> worked</span> so well in this class<br/></span>
🎧 was that the teacher</span> was well prepared</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I think it would have taken me ages</span> to prepare</span> examples</span>,<br/>
🎧 showing</span> each of the steps</span> involved</span> in making</span> the bird</span>.<br/>
🎧 But that was a really good idea.<br/>
🎧 The children could see what they were aiming</span> for,<br/>
🎧 and much better for them to be able to hold</span> something,<br/>
🎧 rather than just looking at pictures</span>.<br/>
🎧 Those physical</span> examples</span> supported</span> her verbal</span> explanations</span> really well.<br/>
🎧 It's strange</span> that origami</span> isn't used more widely</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why do you think that is?<br/>
🎧 Well, teachers</span> may just feel it's not that appealing</span> to children who are used to doing everything on computers</span>,<br/>
🎧 especially</span> boys</span>.<br/>
🎧 Even if they're aware</span> of the benefits</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I don't know. It's no different to any other craft</span> activity</span>.<br/>
🎧 I bet it's because so many teachers</span> are clumsy</span> like me.<br/>
🎧 That's true</span>,<br/>
🎧 too much effort</span> required</span> if you're not good with your hands</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, anyway</span>, I think we should try it out in our maths</span> teaching</span> practice with Year 3</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can see using</span> origami</span> is a really engaging</span> way of reinforcing</span> children's</span> knowledge</span> of geometric</span> shapes</span>,<br/>
🎧 like they were doing in the video</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I think it would also work really well for presenting</span> fractions</span>, which is coming</span> up soon.<br/>
🎧 Good idea, that's something most of the kids</span> in that class might struggle</span> with.<br/>
🎧 Origami</span> would also be good practice for using</span> symmetry</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I think they did that last term</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, well let's try and get some ideas</span> together and plan the lesson</span> next week.<br/>
🎧 OK, if you could..</span>.<br/>

🎧 The person I've chosen</span> to talk about is the French</span> writer</span> Victor</span> Hugo</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 many people have heard of him because his novel</span>, Les</span> Miserables</span>,<br/>
🎧 which he wrote</span> in 1862</span>, is famous around the world</span>.<br/>
🎧 It became</span> a stage</span> musical</span> in the 1980s</span>,<br/>
🎧 and a film</span> version</span> was also released</span> in 2012</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, some of us, I'm sure, have a pretty</span> general</span> idea of the plot</span>,<br/>
🎧 but we know much less about the author</span>.<br/>
🎧 Today, I'm going to provide</span> a little more insight</span> into this talented</span> man<br/></span>
🎧 and I'm going to talk particularly</span> about the home he had on the island</span> of Guernsey</span> in the British</span> Channel</span> Islands</span>.<br/>
🎧 But first, his early</span> career..</span>.<br/>
🎧 as I've said, he was a writer</span>,<br/>
🎧 he was at the height</span> of his career</span> in Paris<br/></span>
🎧 and he was very highly</span> regarded</span> by his colleagues</span>.<br/>
🎧 As far</span> as literature</span> was concerned</span>,<br/>
🎧 he was the leading</span> figure</span> of the Romantic</span> movement</span>.<br/>
🎧 However</span>, as well as being a literary</span> genius</span>,<br/>
🎧 he also gave many speeches</span> about issues like the level</span> of poverty</span> in his society</span>.<br/>
🎧 He felt</span> very strongly</span> about this<br/></span>
🎧 and about other areas</span> where change was needed</span>, like education</span>.<br/>
🎧 This kind of outspoken</span> criticism</span> was not well liked</span> by the rulers</span> of France<br/></span>
🎧 and, eventually</span>, the emperor</span> -</span> Napoleon</span> III</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 told Victor</span> Hugo</span> to leave Paris</span> and not return;<br/></span>
🎧 in other words</span>, he sent</span> him into exile</span>.<br/>
🎧 So Victor</span> Hugo</span> was forced</span> to reside</span> in other parts</span> of Europe</span>.<br/>
🎧 Guernsey</span> was actually his third</span> place of exile<br/></span>
🎧 and he landed</span> there in 1855</span>.<br/>
🎧 He produced</span> a lot while on Guernsey</span> -</span> including</span> Les</span> Miserables</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 and to do this, he had to spend</span> a great deal</span> of time in the home that he had there.<br/>
🎧 This was a property</span> that he bought</span> using</span> the money he'd made in France<br/></span>
🎧 from the publication</span> of a collection</span> of his poetry</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was the only property</span> he ever owned</span>, and he was very proud</span> of it.<br/>
🎧 The property</span> Victor</span> Hugo</span> bought</span> on Guernsey</span> was a large, five-storey</span> house in the capital</span> town</span> of St</span> Peter</span> Port<br/></span>
🎧 and he lived</span> there for 15</span> years,<br/>
🎧 returning</span> to France</span> in 1870</span> when Napoleon's</span> Empire</span> collapsed</span>.<br/>
🎧 He decorated</span> and furnished</span> each level</span>, or floor</span>, of the house in unique</span> and wonderful ways</span>,<br/>
🎧 and many people consider</span> the inside of the house to be a 'work</span> of art'</span>.<br/>
🎧 Today it's a museum</span> that attracts</span> 200,000</span> visitors</span> a year.<br/>
🎧 He lived</span> in the house with his family..</span>.<br/>
🎧 and portraits</span> of its members</span> still hang</span> in rooms</span> on the ground</span> floor</span>,<br/>
🎧 along with drawings</span> that he did during his travels</span> that he felt</span> were important to him.<br/>
🎧 In other ground-floor</span> rooms</span>, there are huge</span> tapestries<br/></span>
🎧 that he would've designed</span> and loved.<br/>
🎧 The walls</span> are covered</span> in dark</span> wood</span> panelling</span> that Victor</span> Hugo</span> created</span> himself<br/></span>
🎧 using</span> wooden</span> furniture</span> that he bought</span> in the market</span>.<br/>
🎧 The items</span> were relatively</span> inexpensive</span>,<br/>
🎧 and he used them to create</span> intricate</span> carvings</span>.<br/>
🎧 They gave an atmosphere</span> on the lower</span> level</span> that was shadowy</span> and rather solemn</span>.<br/>
🎧 On the next level</span> of the house there are two impressive</span> lounges</span>,<br/>
🎧 where he entertained</span> his guests</span>.<br/>
🎧 One lounge</span> has entirely</span> red furnishings</span>,<br/>
🎧 such as sofas</span> and wall</span> coverings</span>, and the other blue</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's a strong</span> Chinese</span> influence</span> in these areas<br/></span>
🎧 in things like the wallpaper</span> pattern</span> and the lamps</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 which he would have made himself</span> by copying</span> original</span> versions</span>.<br/>
🎧 His library</span>, where he left</span> many of his favourite</span> books,<br/>
🎧 forms</span> the hallway</span> to the third</span> floor<br/></span>
🎧 and was a comfortable</span> area</span> where he could relax</span> and enjoy his afternoons</span>.<br/>
🎧 And then, at the very top of the house,<br/>
🎧 there's a room called the Lookout</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 called that because it looks out over the harbour</span>.<br/>
🎧 In contrast</span> to the rather dark</span> lower</span> levels</span>,<br/>
🎧 it's full of light</span> and was like a glass</span> office</span> where he would write</span> until lunchtime</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 often at his desk</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, Victor</span> Hugo</span> was a man of many talents</span>,<br/>
🎧 but he was also true</span> to his values</span>.<br/>
🎧 While living in his house on Guernsey</span>,<br/>
🎧 he entertained</span> many other famous writers</span>,<br/>
🎧 but he also invited</span> a large group of local</span> children from the deprived</span> areas</span> of the island</span> to dinner once a week.<br/>
🎧 What's more, he served</span> them their food,<br/>
🎧 which was an extraordinary</span> gesture</span> for the time period</span>.<br/>
🎧 In 1927</span>, the house was owned</span> by his relatives</span>,<br/>
🎧 and they decided</span> to donate</span> it to the city</span> of Paris</span>.<br/>
🎧 It has since been restored</span> using</span> photographs</span> from the period<br/></span>
🎧 and, as I mentioned</span> earlier</span>, is now a museum</span> that is open to the public</span>.<br/>
