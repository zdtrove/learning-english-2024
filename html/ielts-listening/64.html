🎧 Hello?<br/>
🎧 Oh, hello. Is that Julie Davison?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 This is Greg Preston from the Employment Agency.<br/>
🎧 We met last week when you came in to enquire about office work.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's right.<br/>
🎧 Now we've just had some details come in of a job which might interest you.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So this is a position for a receptionist,<br/>
🎧 I believe you've done that sort of work before?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I have,<br/>
🎧 I worked in a sports centre for a couple of years before I got married and had the children.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Well, this job's in Fordham, so not too far away for you,<br/>
🎧 and it's at the medical centre there.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So where exactly is that?<br/>
🎧 It's quite near the station, on Chastons Road.<br/>
🎧 Sorry?<br/>
🎧 Chastons Road,<br/>
🎧 that's C-H-A-S-T-O-N-S.<br/>
🎧 OK, thanks.<br/>
🎧 So what would the work involve?<br/>
🎧 Dealing with enquiries from patients?<br/>
🎧 Yes,<br/>
🎧 and you'd also be involved in making appointments,<br/>
🎧 whether face to face or on the phone.<br/>
🎧 And rescheduling them if necessary.<br/>
🎧 Fine, that shouldn't be a problem.<br/>
🎧 And another of your duties would be keeping the centre's database up-to-date.<br/>
🎧 Then you might have other general administrative duties as well,<br/>
🎧 but those would be the main ones.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Now when the details came in, I immediately thought of you<br/>
🎧 because one thing they do require is someone with experience,<br/>
🎧 and you did mention your work at the sports centre when you came in to see us.<br/>
🎧 Yes, in fact I enjoyed that job.<br/>
🎧 Is there anything else they're looking for?<br/>
🎧 Well, they say it's quite a high-pressure environment,<br/>
🎧 they're always very busy,<br/>
🎧 and patients are often under stress,<br/>
🎧 so they want someone who can cope with that and stay calm,<br/>
🎧 and at the same time be confident when interacting with the public.<br/>
🎧 Well, after dealing with three children all under five,<br/>
🎧 I reckon I can cope with that.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you can.<br/>
🎧 And then another thing they mention is that they're looking for someone with good IT skills...<br/>
🎧 Not a problem.<br/>
🎧 So you'd be interested in following this up?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 When would it start?<br/>
🎧 Well, they're looking for someone from the beginning of next month,<br/>
🎧 but I should tell you that this isn't a permanent job,<br/>
🎧 it's temporary, so the contract would be just to the end of September.<br/>
🎧 But they do say that there could be further opportunities after that.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And what would the hours be?<br/>
🎧 Well, they want someone who can start at 7:45 in the morning.<br/>
🎧 Could you manage that?<br/>
🎧 Yes, my husband would have to get the kids up and off to my mother's,<br/>
🎧 she's going to be looking after them while I'm at work.<br/>
🎧 What time would I finish?<br/>
🎧 1:15<br/>
🎧 That should work out all right.<br/>
🎧 I can pick the kids up on my way home,<br/>
🎧 and then I'll have the afternoon with them.<br/>
🎧 Oh, one thing...<br/>
🎧 is there parking available for staff at the centre?<br/>
🎧 Yes, there is.<br/>
🎧 and it's also on a bus route.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Well, I expect I'll have the car but it's good to know that.<br/>
🎧 OK, so where do I go from here?<br/>
🎧 Well, if you're happy for me to do so,<br/>
🎧 I'll forward your CV and references,<br/>
🎧 and then the best thing would probably be for you to phone them<br/>
🎧 so they can arrange for an interview.<br/>
🎧 Great. Well thank you very much.<br/>
🎧 You're welcome. Bye now.<br/>
🎧 Bye.<br/>

🎧 Good morning everyone, and welcome to the Museum of Farming Life.<br/>
🎧 I understand it's your first visit here,<br/>
🎧 so I'd like to give you some background information about the museum<br/>
🎧 and then explain a little about what you can see during your visit.<br/>
🎧 So, where we're standing at the moment is the entrance to a large building<br/>
🎧 that was constructed in 1880<br/>
🎧 as the home of a local businessman, Alfred Palmer, of the Palmer biscuit factory.<br/>
🎧 It was later sold and became a hall of residence for students in 1911,<br/>
🎧 and a museum in 1951.<br/>
🎧 In 2005, a modern extension was built to accommodate the museum's collections.<br/>
🎧 The museum's owned by the university,<br/>
🎧 and apart from two rooms that are our offices,<br/>
🎧 the university uses the main part of the building.<br/>
🎧 You may see students going into the building for lessons,<br/>
🎧 but it's not open to museum visitors, I'm afraid.<br/>
🎧 It's a shame because the interior architectural features are outstanding,<br/>
🎧 especially the room that used to be the library.<br/>
🎧 Luckily, we've managed to keep entry to the museum free.<br/>
🎧 This includes access to all the galleries, outdoor areas and the rooms for special exhibitions.<br/>
🎧 We run activities for children and students,<br/>
🎧 such as the museum club, for which there's no charge.<br/>
🎧 We do have a donation box just over there<br/>
🎧 so feel free to give whatever amount you consider appropriate.<br/>
🎧 We do have a cloakroom,<br/>
🎧 if you'd like to leave your coats and bags somewhere.<br/>
🎧 Unlike other museums, photography is allowed here,<br/>
🎧 so you might like to keep your cameras with you.<br/>
🎧 You might be more comfortable not carrying around heavy rucksacks,<br/>
🎧 though keep your coats and jackets on as it's quite cold in the museum garden today.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to tell you about the different areas of the museum.<br/>
🎧 Just inside, and outside the main gallery,<br/>
🎧 we have an area called Four Seasons.<br/>
🎧 Here you can watch a four-minute animation of a woodland scene.<br/>
🎧 It was designed especially for the museum<br/>
🎧 by a group of young people on a film studies course, and it's beautiful.<br/>
🎧 Children absolutely love it, but then, so do adults.<br/>
🎧 The main gallery's called Town and Country.<br/>
🎧 It includes a photographic collection of prize-winning sheep and shepherds.<br/>
🎧 Leaving Town and Country, you enter Farmhouse Kitchen,<br/>
🎧 which is... well, self-explanatory.<br/>
🎧 Here we have the oldest collection of equipment for making butter and cheese in the country.<br/>
🎧 And this morning, a specialist cheesemaker will be giving demonstrations of how it's produced.<br/>
🎧 You may even get to try some.<br/>
🎧 After that, you can go in two directions.<br/>
🎧 To the right is a staircase<br/>
🎧 that takes you up to a landing from where you can look down on the galleries.<br/>
🎧 To the left is a room called A Year on the Farm.<br/>
🎧 There's lots of seating here as sometimes we use the room for school visits,<br/>
🎧 so it's a good place to stop for a rest.<br/>
🎧 If you're feeling competitive,<br/>
🎧 you can take our memory test in which you answer questions about things you've seen in the museum.<br/>
🎧 The next area's called Wagon Walk.<br/>
🎧 This contains farm carts from nearly every part of the country.<br/>
🎧 It's surprising how much regional variation there was.<br/>
🎧 Beside the carts are display boards with information about each one.<br/>
🎧 The carts are old and fragile,<br/>
🎧 so we ask you to keep your children close to you<br/>
🎧 and ensure they don't climb on the carts.<br/>
🎧 From Wagon Walk, you can either make your way back to reception<br/>
🎧 or go out into the garden<br/>
🎧 or even go back to take another look in the galleries.<br/>
🎧 In the far corner of the garden is Bees are Magic,<br/>
🎧 but we're redeveloping this area so you can't visit that at the moment.<br/>
🎧 You can still buy our honey in the shop, though.<br/>
🎧 Finally, there's The Pond,<br/>
🎧 which contains all kinds of interesting wildlife.<br/>
🎧 There are baby ducks that are only a few days old, as well as tiny frogs.<br/>
🎧 The Pond isn't deep and there's a fence around it,<br/>
🎧 so it's perfectly safe for children.<br/>

🎧 So now I want you to discuss the lesson we've just been watching on the video<br/>
🎧 and think about the ways in which origami can be a useful educational tool.<br/>
🎧 Can you all work with the person sitting next to you...<br/>
🎧 I had no idea that such a simple thing like folding squares of paper to make the shape of something like a bird could be such an amazing tool.<br/>
🎧 It's made me see origami in a whole new light.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 It was interesting to see the educational skills the children were developing by doing origami.<br/>
🎧 On the video you could see them really listening hard<br/>
🎧 to make sure they did all the steps in the right order to make the bird.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 In this lesson they were working individually<br/>
🎧 but it would also be interesting to see if the children could work out how to make something simple<br/>
🎧 without being given any direction.<br/>
🎧 That would help with building teamwork as well.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but much more of a challenge.<br/>
🎧 One thing that really stood out for me was that the children were all having fun while being taught something new.<br/>
🎧 Which is a key aim of any lesson with this age group.<br/>
🎧 And although these kids had no problems with folding the paper,<br/>
🎧 with younger children you could do origami to help practise fine motor skills.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely.<br/>
🎧 Shall we talk about the individual children we saw on the video?<br/>
🎧 I wrote all their names down and took some notes.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I did too.<br/>
🎧 OK, good.<br/>
🎧 Let's start with Sid.<br/>
🎧 He was interesting because before they started doing the origami, he was being quite disruptive.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 He really benefited from having to use his hands,<br/>
🎧 it helped him to settle down and start concentrating.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I noticed that too.<br/>
🎧 What about Jack?<br/>
🎧 I noticed he seemed to want to work things out for himself.<br/>
🎧 You could see him trying out different things rather than asking the teacher for help.<br/>
🎧 What did you make of Naomi?<br/>
🎧 She seemed to be losing interest at one point<br/>
🎧 but then she decided she wanted her mouse to be the best<br/>
🎧 and that motivated her to try harder.<br/>
🎧 She didn't seem satisfied with hers in the end, though.<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 Anya was such a star.<br/>
🎧 She listened so carefully<br/>
🎧 and then produced the perfect bird with very little effort.<br/>
🎧 I think the teacher could have increased the level of difficulty for her.<br/>
🎧 Hmm... maybe.<br/>
🎧 I think it was the first time Zara had come across origami.<br/>
🎧 She looked as if she didn't really get what was going on.<br/>
🎧 She seemed unsure about what she was supposed to do.<br/>
🎧 but in the end hers didn't turn out too badly.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. I'm sure it was a positive learning experience for her.<br/>
🎧 I think one reason why the origami activity worked so well in this class<br/>
🎧 was that the teacher was well prepared.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I think it would have taken me ages to prepare examples,<br/>
🎧 showing each of the steps involved in making the bird.<br/>
🎧 But that was a really good idea.<br/>
🎧 The children could see what they were aiming for,<br/>
🎧 and much better for them to be able to hold something,<br/>
🎧 rather than just looking at pictures.<br/>
🎧 Those physical examples supported her verbal explanations really well.<br/>
🎧 It's strange that origami isn't used more widely.<br/>
🎧 Why do you think that is?<br/>
🎧 Well, teachers may just feel it's not that appealing to children who are used to doing everything on computers,<br/>
🎧 especially boys.<br/>
🎧 Even if they're aware of the benefits.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I don't know. It's no different to any other craft activity.<br/>
🎧 I bet it's because so many teachers are clumsy like me.<br/>
🎧 That's true,<br/>
🎧 too much effort required if you're not good with your hands.<br/>
🎧 Well, anyway, I think we should try it out in our maths teaching practice with Year 3.<br/>
🎧 I can see using origami is a really engaging way of reinforcing children's knowledge of geometric shapes,<br/>
🎧 like they were doing in the video,<br/>
🎧 but I think it would also work really well for presenting fractions, which is coming up soon.<br/>
🎧 Good idea, that's something most of the kids in that class might struggle with.<br/>
🎧 Origami would also be good practice for using symmetry,<br/>
🎧 but I think they did that last term.<br/>
🎧 OK, well let's try and get some ideas together and plan the lesson next week.<br/>
🎧 OK, if you could...<br/>

🎧 The person I've chosen to talk about is the French writer Victor Hugo -<br/>
🎧 many people have heard of him because his novel, Les Miserables,<br/>
🎧 which he wrote in 1862, is famous around the world.<br/>
🎧 It became a stage musical in the 1980s,<br/>
🎧 and a film version was also released in 2012.<br/>
🎧 So, some of us, I'm sure, have a pretty general idea of the plot,<br/>
🎧 but we know much less about the author.<br/>
🎧 Today, I'm going to provide a little more insight into this talented man<br/>
🎧 and I'm going to talk particularly about the home he had on the island of Guernsey in the British Channel Islands.<br/>
🎧 But first, his early career...<br/>
🎧 as I've said, he was a writer,<br/>
🎧 he was at the height of his career in Paris<br/>
🎧 and he was very highly regarded by his colleagues.<br/>
🎧 As far as literature was concerned,<br/>
🎧 he was the leading figure of the Romantic movement.<br/>
🎧 However, as well as being a literary genius,<br/>
🎧 he also gave many speeches about issues like the level of poverty in his society.<br/>
🎧 He felt very strongly about this<br/>
🎧 and about other areas where change was needed, like education.<br/>
🎧 This kind of outspoken criticism was not well liked by the rulers of France<br/>
🎧 and, eventually, the emperor - Napoleon III -<br/>
🎧 told Victor Hugo to leave Paris and not return;<br/>
🎧 in other words, he sent him into exile.<br/>
🎧 So Victor Hugo was forced to reside in other parts of Europe.<br/>
🎧 Guernsey was actually his third place of exile<br/>
🎧 and he landed there in 1855.<br/>
🎧 He produced a lot while on Guernsey - including Les Miserables -<br/>
🎧 and to do this, he had to spend a great deal of time in the home that he had there.<br/>
🎧 This was a property that he bought using the money he'd made in France<br/>
🎧 from the publication of a collection of his poetry.<br/>
🎧 It was the only property he ever owned, and he was very proud of it.<br/>
🎧 The property Victor Hugo bought on Guernsey was a large, five-storey house in the capital town of St Peter Port<br/>
🎧 and he lived there for 15 years,<br/>
🎧 returning to France in 1870 when Napoleon's Empire collapsed.<br/>
🎧 He decorated and furnished each level, or floor, of the house in unique and wonderful ways,<br/>
🎧 and many people consider the inside of the house to be a 'work of art'.<br/>
🎧 Today it's a museum that attracts 200,000 visitors a year.<br/>
🎧 He lived in the house with his family...<br/>
🎧 and portraits of its members still hang in rooms on the ground floor,<br/>
🎧 along with drawings that he did during his travels that he felt were important to him.<br/>
🎧 In other ground-floor rooms, there are huge tapestries<br/>
🎧 that he would've designed and loved.<br/>
🎧 The walls are covered in dark wood panelling that Victor Hugo created himself<br/>
🎧 using wooden furniture that he bought in the market.<br/>
🎧 The items were relatively inexpensive,<br/>
🎧 and he used them to create intricate carvings.<br/>
🎧 They gave an atmosphere on the lower level that was shadowy and rather solemn.<br/>
🎧 On the next level of the house there are two impressive lounges,<br/>
🎧 where he entertained his guests.<br/>
🎧 One lounge has entirely red furnishings,<br/>
🎧 such as sofas and wall coverings, and the other blue.<br/>
🎧 There's a strong Chinese influence in these areas<br/>
🎧 in things like the wallpaper pattern and the lamps -<br/>
🎧 which he would have made himself by copying original versions.<br/>
🎧 His library, where he left many of his favourite books,<br/>
🎧 forms the hallway to the third floor<br/>
🎧 and was a comfortable area where he could relax and enjoy his afternoons.<br/>
🎧 And then, at the very top of the house,<br/>
🎧 there's a room called the Lookout -<br/>
🎧 called that because it looks out over the harbour.<br/>
🎧 In contrast to the rather dark lower levels,<br/>
🎧 it's full of light and was like a glass office where he would write until lunchtime -<br/>
🎧 often at his desk.<br/>
🎧 So, Victor Hugo was a man of many talents,<br/>
🎧 but he was also true to his values.<br/>
🎧 While living in his house on Guernsey,<br/>
🎧 he entertained many other famous writers,<br/>
🎧 but he also invited a large group of local children from the deprived areas of the island to dinner once a week.<br/>
🎧 What's more, he served them their food,<br/>
🎧 which was an extraordinary gesture for the time period.<br/>
🎧 In 1927, the house was owned by his relatives,<br/>
🎧 and they decided to donate it to the city of Paris.<br/>
🎧 It has since been restored using photographs from the period<br/>
🎧 and, as I mentioned earlier, is now a museum that is open to the public.<br/>
<br/><br/>
