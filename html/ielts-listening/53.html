🎧 Hello. Children's Engineering Workshops.<br/>
🎧 Oh hello.<br/>
🎧 I wanted some information about the workshops in the school holidays.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 I have two daughters who are interested.<br/>
🎧 The younger one's Lydia, she's four,<br/>
🎧 do you take children as young as that?<br/>
🎧 Yes,<br/>
🎧 our Tiny Engineers workshop is for four to five-year-olds.<br/>
🎧 What sorts of activities do they do?<br/>
🎧 All sorts.<br/>
🎧 For example, they work together to design a special cover that goes round an egg,<br/>
🎧 so that when it's inside they can drop it from a height and it doesn't break.<br/>
🎧 Well, sometimes it does break but that's part of the fun!<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And Lydia loves building things.<br/>
🎧 Is there any opportunity for her to do that?<br/>
🎧 Well, they have a competition to see who can make the highest tower.<br/>
🎧 You'd be amazed how high they can go.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 But they're learning all the time as well as having fun.<br/>
🎧 For example, one thing they do is to design and build a car that's attached to a balloon,<br/>
🎧 and the force of the air in that actually powers the car and makes it move along.<br/>
🎧 They go really fast too.<br/>
🎧 OK, well, all this sounds perfect.<br/>
🎧 Now Carly, that's my older daughter, has just had her seventh birthday,<br/>
🎧 so presumably she'd be in a different group?<br/>
🎧 Yes, she'd be in the Junior Engineers.<br/>
🎧 That's for children from six to eight.<br/>
🎧 And do they do the same sorts of activities?<br/>
🎧 Some are the same, but a bit more advanced.<br/>
🎧 So they work out how to build model vehicles,<br/>
🎧 things like cars and trucks,<br/>
🎧 but also how to construct animals using the same sorts of material and technique,<br/>
🎧 and then they learn how they can program them and make them move.<br/>
🎧 So they learn a bit of coding?<br/>
🎧 They do.<br/>
🎧 They pick it up really quickly.<br/>
🎧 We're there to help if they need it,<br/>
🎧 but they learn from one another too.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And do they have competitions too?<br/>
🎧 Yes, with the Junior Engineers,<br/>
🎧 it's to use recycled materials like card and wood to build a bridge,<br/>
🎧 and the longest one gets a prize.<br/>
🎧 That sounds fun.<br/>
🎧 I wouldn't mind doing that myself!<br/>
🎧 Then they have something a bit different,<br/>
🎧 which is to think up an idea for a five-minute movie and then film it,<br/>
🎧 using special animation software.<br/>
🎧 You'd be amazed what they come up with.<br/>
🎧 And of course, that's something they can put on their phone and take home to show all their friends.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 And then they also build a robot in the shape of a human,<br/>
🎧 and they decorate it and program it so that it can move its arms and legs.<br/>
🎧 Perfect.<br/>
🎧 So, is it the same price as the Tiny Engineers?<br/>
🎧 It's just a bit more:<br/>
🎧 £50 for the five weeks.<br/>
🎧 And are the classes on a Monday, too?<br/>
🎧 They used to be,<br/>
🎧 but we found it didn't give our staff enough time to clear up after the first workshop,<br/>
🎧 so we moved them to Wednesdays.<br/>
🎧 The classes are held in the morning from ten to eleven.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 That's better for me actually.<br/>
🎧 And what about the location?<br/>
🎧 Where exactly are the workshops held?<br/>
🎧 They're in building 10A,<br/>
🎧 there's a big sign on the door, you can't miss it,<br/>
🎧 and that's in Fradstone Industrial Estate.<br/>
🎧 Sorry?<br/>
🎧 Fradstone,<br/>
🎧 that's Fradstone<br/>
🎧 And that's in Grasford, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yes, up past the station.<br/>
🎧 And will I have any parking problems there?<br/>
🎧 No, there's always plenty available.<br/>
🎧 So would you like to enrol Lydia and Carly now?<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So can I have...<br/>

🎧 Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Stevenson's,<br/>
🎧 one of the country's major manufacturers of metal goods.<br/>
🎧 Thank you for choosing us for your two weeks of work experience.<br/>
🎧 My name is Julia Simmons,<br/>
🎧 and since the beginning of this year I've been the managing director.<br/>
🎧 Stevenson's is quite an old company.<br/>
🎧 Like me, the founder, Ronald Stevenson, went into the steel industry when he left school,<br/>
🎧 that was in 1923.<br/>
🎧 He set up this company when he finished his apprenticeship, in 1926,<br/>
🎧 although he actually started making plans two years earlier, in 1924.<br/>
🎧 He was a very determined young man!<br/>
🎧 Stevenson's long-term plan was to manufacture components for the machine tools industry,<br/>
🎧 although in fact that never came about,<br/>
🎧 and for the automotive industry, that is, cars and lorries.<br/>
🎧 However, there was a delay of five years before that happened,<br/>
🎧 because shortly before the company went into production,<br/>
🎧 Stevenson was given the opportunity to make goods for hospitals<br/>
🎧 and other players in the healthcare industry,<br/>
🎧 so that's what we did for the first five years.<br/>
🎧 Over the years, we've expanded the premises considerably,<br/>
🎧 we were lucky that the site is big enough,<br/>
🎧 so moving to a new location has never been necessary.<br/>
🎧 However, the layout is far from ideal for modern machinery and production methods,<br/>
🎧 so we intend to carry out major refurbishment of this site over the next five years.<br/>
🎧 I'd better give you some idea of what you'll be doing during your two weeks with us,<br/>
🎧 so you know what to expect.<br/>
🎧 Most mornings you'll have a presentation from one of the managers,<br/>
🎧 to learn about their department, starting this morning with research and development.<br/>
🎧 And you'll all spend some time in each department,<br/>
🎧 observing what's going on and talking to people,<br/>
🎧 as long as you don't stop them from doing their work altogether!<br/>
🎧 In the past, a teacher from your school has come in at the end of each week<br/>
🎧 to find out how the group were getting on,<br/>
🎧 but your school isn't able to arrange that this year.<br/>
🎧 OK, now I'll briefly help you to orientate yourselves around the site.<br/>
🎧 As you can see, we're in the reception area,<br/>
🎧 which we try to make attractive and welcoming to visitors.<br/>
🎧 There's a corridor running left from here,<br/>
🎧 and if you go along that,<br/>
🎧 the door facing you at the end is the entrance to the coffee room.<br/>
🎧 This looks out onto the main road on one side, and some trees on the other,<br/>
🎧 and that'll be where you meet each morning.<br/>
🎧 The factory is the very big room on the far side of the site.<br/>
🎧 Next to it is the warehouse,<br/>
🎧 which can be accessed by lorries going up the road to the turning area at the end.<br/>
🎧 You can get to the warehouse by crossing to the far side of the courtyard,<br/>
🎧 and then the door is on your right.<br/>
🎧 Somewhere you'll be keen to find is the staff canteen.<br/>
🎧 This is right next to reception.<br/>
🎧 I can confidently say that the food's very good,<br/>
🎧 but the view isn't.<br/>
🎧 The windows on one side look onto a corridor and courtyard,<br/>
🎧 which aren't very attractive at all,<br/>
🎧 and on the other onto the access road, which isn't much better.<br/>
🎧 You'll be using the meeting room quite often,<br/>
🎧 and you'll find it by walking along the corridor to the left of the courtyard,<br/>
🎧 and continuing along it to the end.<br/>
🎧 The meeting room is the last one on the right,<br/>
🎧 and I'm afraid there's no natural daylight in the room.<br/>
🎧 Then you'll need to know where some of the offices are.<br/>
🎧 The human resources department is at the front of this building,<br/>
🎧 so you head to the left along the corridor from reception,<br/>
🎧 and it's the second room you come to.<br/>
🎧 It looks out onto the main road.<br/>
🎧 And finally, the boardroom, where you'll be meeting sometimes.<br/>
🎧 That has quite a pleasant view, as it looks out onto the trees.<br/>
🎧 Go along the corridor past the courtyard, right to the end.<br/>
🎧 The boardroom is on the left, next to the factory.<br/>
🎧 OK, now are there any questions...<br/>

🎧 How are you getting on with your art project, Tom?<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Like, they gave us the theme of birds to base our project on,<br/>
🎧 and I'm not really all that interested in wildlife.<br/>
🎧 But I'm starting to get into it.<br/>
🎧 I've pretty well finished the introductory stage.<br/>
🎧 So have I.<br/>
🎧 When they gave us all those handouts with details of books and websites to look at,<br/>
🎧 I was really put off,<br/>
🎧 but the more I read, the more interested I got.<br/>
🎧 Me too.<br/>
🎧 I found I could research so many different aspects of birds in art - colour, movement, texture.<br/>
🎧 So I was looking forward to the Bird Park visit.<br/>
🎧 What a letdown!<br/>
🎧 It poured with rain and we hardly saw a single bird.<br/>
🎧 Much less use than the trip to the Natural History Museum.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I liked all the stuff about evolution there.<br/>
🎧 The workshop sessions with Dr Fletcher were good too,<br/>
🎧 especially the brainstorming sessions.<br/>
🎧 Oh... I missed those because I was ill.<br/>
🎧 I wish we could've seen the projects last year's students did.<br/>
🎧 Mm. I suppose they want us to do our own thing, not copy.<br/>
🎧 Have you drafted your proposal yet?<br/>
🎧 Yes, but I haven't handed it in.<br/>
🎧 I need to amend some parts.<br/>
🎧 I've realised the notes from my research are almost all just descriptions,<br/>
🎧 I haven't actually evaluated anything.<br/>
🎧 So I'll have to fix that.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I didn't know we had to do that.<br/>
🎧 I'll have to look at that too.<br/>
🎧 Did you do a timeline for the project?<br/>
🎧 Yes, and a mind map.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, so did I.<br/>
🎧 I quite enjoyed that.<br/>
🎧 But it was hard having to explain the basis for my decisions in my action plan.<br/>
🎧 What?<br/>
🎧 You know, give a rationale.<br/>
🎧 I didn't realise we had to do that.<br/>
🎧 OK, I can add it now.<br/>
🎧 And I've done the video diary presentation,<br/>
🎧 and worked out what I want my outcome to be in the project.<br/>
🎧 Someone told me it's best not to be too precise about your actual outcome at this stage,<br/>
🎧 so you have more scope to explore your ideas later on.<br/>
🎧 So I'm going to go back to my proposal to make it a bit more vague.<br/>
🎧 Really? OK, I'll change that too then.<br/>
🎧 One part of the project I'm unsure about is where we choose some paintings of birds and say what they mean to us.<br/>
🎧 Like, I chose a painting of a falcon by Landseer.<br/>
🎧 I like it because the bird's standing there with his head turned to one side,<br/>
🎧 but he seems to be staring straight at you.<br/>
🎧 But I can't just say it's a bit scary, can I?<br/>
🎧 You could talk about the possible danger suggested by the bird's look.<br/>
🎧 Oh, OK.<br/>
🎧 There's a picture of a fish hawk by Audubon I like.<br/>
🎧 It's swooping over the water with a fish in its talons,<br/>
🎧 and with great black wings which take up most of the picture.<br/>
🎧 So you could discuss it in relation to predators and food chains?<br/>
🎧 Well actually I think I'll concentrate on the impression of rapid motion it gives.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Do you know that picture of a kingfisher by van Gogh -<br/>
🎧 it's perching on a reed growing near a stream.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's got these beautiful blue and red and black shades.<br/>
🎧 I've actually chosen it because I saw a real kingfisher once when I was little,<br/>
🎧 I was out walking with my grandfather, and I've never forgotten it.<br/>
🎧 So we can use a personal link?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 There's a portrait called William Wells.<br/>
🎧 I can't remember the artist but it's a middle-aged man who's just shot a bird.<br/>
🎧 And his expression, and the way he's holding the bird in his hand<br/>
🎧 suggests he's not sure about what he's done.<br/>
🎧 To me it's about how ambiguous people are in the way they exploit the natural world.<br/>
🎧 Interesting.<br/>
🎧 There's Gauguin's picture Vairumati.<br/>
🎧 He did it in Tahiti.<br/>
🎧 It's a woman with a white bird behind her that is eating a lizard,<br/>
🎧 and what I'm interested in is what idea this bird refers to.<br/>
🎧 Apparently, it's a reference to the never-ending cycle of existence.<br/>
🎧 Wow.<br/>
🎧 I chose a portrait of a little boy, Giovanni de Medici.<br/>
🎧 He's holding a tiny bird in one fist.<br/>
🎧 I like the way he's holding it carefully so he doesn't hurt it.<br/>
🎧 Ah right.<br/>

🎧 Ancient philosophy is not just about talking or lecturing,<br/>
🎧 or even reading long, dense books.<br/>
🎧 In fact, it is something people have used throughout history -<br/>
🎧 to solve their problems and to achieve their greatest triumphs.<br/>
🎧 Specifically, I am referring to Stoicism,<br/>
🎧 which, in my opinion, is the most practical of all philosophies<br/>
🎧 and therefore the most appealing.<br/>
🎧 Stoicism was founded in Ancient Greece by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC,<br/>
🎧 but was practised by the likes of Epictetus,<br/>
🎧 Cato, Seneca and Marcus Aurelius.<br/>
🎧 Amazingly, we still have access to these ideas,<br/>
🎧 despite the fact that the most famous Stoics never wrote anything down for publication,<br/>
🎧 Cato definitely didn't.<br/>
🎧 Marcus Aurelius never intended his Meditations to be anything but personal.<br/>
🎧 Seneca's letters were, well, letters<br/>
🎧 and Epictetus' thoughts come to us by way of a note-taking student.<br/>
🎧 Stoic principles were based on the idea that its followers could have an unshakable happiness in this life<br/>
🎧 and the key to achieving this was virtue.<br/>
🎧 The road to virtue, in turn, lay in understanding that destructive emotions, like anger and jealousy,<br/>
🎧 are under our conscious control,<br/>
🎧 they don't have to control us, because we can learn to control them.<br/>
🎧 In the words of Epictetus:<br/>
🎧 “external events I cannot control, but the choices I make with regard to them, I do control”.<br/>
🎧 The modern day philosopher and writer Nassim Nicholas Taleb<br/>
🎧 defines a Stoic as someone who has a different perspective on experiences<br/>
🎧 which most of us would see as wholly negative;<br/>
🎧 a Stoic “transforms fear into caution, pain into transformation,<br/>
🎧 mistakes into initiation and desire into undertaking”.<br/>
🎧 Using this definition as a model,<br/>
🎧 we can see that throughout the centuries Stoicism has been practised in more recent history<br/>
🎧 by kings, presidents, artists, writers and entrepreneurs.<br/>
🎧 The founding fathers of the United States were inspired by the philosophy.<br/>
🎧 George Washington was introduced to Stoicism by his neighbours at age seventeen,<br/>
🎧 and later, put on a play based on the life of Cato to inspire his men.<br/>
🎧 Thomas Jefferson kept a copy of Seneca beside his bed.<br/>
🎧 Writers and artists have also been inspired by the stoics.<br/>
🎧 Eugène Delacroix, the renowned French Romantic artist<br/>
🎧 (known best for his painting Liberty Leading the People)<br/>
🎧 was an ardent Stoic, referring to it as his “consoling religion”.<br/>
🎧 The economist Adam Smith's theories on capitalism were significantly influenced by the Stoicism<br/>
🎧 that he studied as a schoolboy, under a teacher who had translated Marcus Aurelius' works.<br/>
🎧 Today's political leaders are no different,<br/>
🎧 with many finding their inspiration from the ancient texts.<br/>
🎧 Former US president Bill Clinton rereads Marcus Aurelius every single year,<br/>
🎧 and many have compared former President Obama's calm leadership style to that of Cato.<br/>
🎧 Wen Jiabao, the former prime minister of China,<br/>
🎧 claims that Meditations is one of two books he travels with<br/>
🎧 and that he has read it more than 100 times over the course of his life.<br/>
🎧 Stoicism had a profound influence on Albert Ellis,<br/>
🎧 who invented Cognitive Behaviour Therapy,<br/>
🎧 which is used to help people manage their problems by changing the way that they think and behave.<br/>
🎧 It's most commonly used to treat depression.<br/>
🎧 The idea is that we can take control of our lives by challenging the irrational beliefs<br/>
🎧 that create our faulty thinking, symptoms and behaviours by using logic instead.<br/>
🎧 Stoicism has also become popular in the world of business.<br/>
🎧 Stoic principles can build the resilience and state of mind required to overcome setbacks<br/>
🎧 because Stoics teach turning obstacles into opportunity.<br/>
🎧 A lesson every business entrepreneur needs to learn.<br/>
🎧 I would argue that studying Stoicism is as relevant today as it was 2,000 years ago,<br/>
🎧 thanks to its brilliant insights into how to lead a good life.<br/>
🎧 At the very root of the thinking, there is a very simple way of living -<br/>
🎧 control what you can and accept what you can't.<br/>
🎧 This is not as easy as it sounds and will require considerable practice -<br/>
🎧 it can take a lifetime to master.<br/>
🎧 The Stoics also believed the most important foundation for a good and happy life is not money, fame, power or pleasure,<br/>
🎧 but having a disciplined and principled character -<br/>
🎧 something which seems to resonate with many people today.<br/>
<br/><br/>
