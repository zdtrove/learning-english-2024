🎧 Hello. <span>Children's</span> <span>Engineering</span> <span>Workshops</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh hello.<br/>
🎧 I wanted some <span>information</span> about the <span>workshops</span> in the school <span>holidays</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 I have two <span>daughters</span> who are interested.<br/>
🎧 The <span>younger</span> <span>one's</span> <span>Lydia</span>, she's <span>four</span>,<br/>
🎧 do you take children as young as that?<br/>
🎧 Yes,<br/>
🎧 our <span>Tiny</span> <span>Engineers</span> <span>workshop</span> is for <span>four</span> to <span>five-year-olds</span>.<br/>
🎧 What <span>sorts</span> of <span>activities</span> do they do?<br/>
🎧 All <span>sorts</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, they work together to <span>design</span> a special <span>cover</span> that <span>goes</span> <span>round</span> an egg,<br/>
🎧 so that when it's inside they can <span>drop</span> it from a <span>height</span> and it doesn't <span>break</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, sometimes it does <span>break</span> but that's <span>part</span> of the fun!<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And <span>Lydia</span> <span>loves</span> <span>building</span> things.<br/>
🎧 Is there any <span>opportunity</span> for her to do that?<br/>
🎧 Well, they have a <span>competition</span> to see who can make the <span>highest</span> <span>tower</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'd be <span>amazed</span> how high they can go.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 But they're <span>learning</span> all the time as well as having fun.<br/>
🎧 For example, one thing they do is to <span>design</span> and <span>build</span> a car that's <span>attached</span> to a <span>balloon</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>force</span> of the air in that actually <span>powers</span> the car and makes it move along.<br/>
🎧 They go really <span>fast</span> too.<br/>
🎧 OK, well, all this sounds perfect.<br/>
🎧 Now <span>Carly</span>, that's my <span>older</span> <span>daughter</span>, has just had her <span>seventh</span> <span>birthday</span>,<br/>
🎧 so <span>presumably</span> she'd be in a different group?<br/>
🎧 Yes, she'd be in the <span>Junior</span> <span>Engineers</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's for children from six to <span>eight</span>.<br/>
🎧 And do they do the same <span>sorts</span> of <span>activities</span>?<br/>
🎧 Some are the same, but a bit more <span>advanced</span>.<br/>
🎧 So they work out how to <span>build</span> <span>model</span> <span>vehicles</span>,<br/>
🎧 things like <span>cars</span> and <span>trucks</span>,<br/>
🎧 but also how to <span>construct</span> <span>animals</span> <span>using</span> the same <span>sorts</span> of <span>material</span> and <span>technique</span>,<br/>
🎧 and then they learn how they can <span>program</span> them and make them move.<br/>
🎧 So they learn a bit of <span>coding</span>?<br/>
🎧 They do.<br/>
🎧 They <span>pick</span> it up really quickly.<br/>
🎧 We're there to help if they need it,<br/>
🎧 but they learn from one another too.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And do they have <span>competitions</span> too?<br/>
🎧 Yes, with the <span>Junior</span> <span>Engineers</span>,<br/>
🎧 it's to use <span>recycled</span> <span>materials</span> like <span>card</span> and <span>wood</span> to <span>build</span> a <span>bridge</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>longest</span> one <span>gets</span> a <span>prize</span>.<br/>
🎧 That sounds fun.<br/>
🎧 I wouldn't <span>mind</span> doing that myself!<br/>
🎧 Then they have something a bit different,<br/>
🎧 which is to think up an idea for a <span>five-minute</span> movie and then <span>film</span> it,<br/>
🎧 <span>using</span> special <span>animation</span> <span>software</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'd be <span>amazed</span> what they come up with.<br/>
🎧 And of course, that's something they can put on their phone and take home to show all their friends.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 And then they also <span>build</span> a <span>robot</span> in the <span>shape</span> of a <span>human</span>,<br/>
🎧 and they <span>decorate</span> it and <span>program</span> it so that it can move its <span>arms</span> and <span>legs</span>.<br/>
🎧 Perfect.<br/>
🎧 So, is it the same <span>price</span> as the <span>Tiny</span> <span>Engineers</span>?<br/>
🎧 It's just a bit more:<br/>
🎧 <span>£50</span> for the <span>five</span> <span>weeks</span>.<br/>
🎧 And are the <span>classes</span> on a <span>Monday</span>, too?<br/>
🎧 They used to be,<br/>
🎧 but we <span>found</span> it didn't give our <span>staff</span> enough time to <span>clear</span> up after the first <span>workshop</span>,<br/>
🎧 so we <span>moved</span> them to <span>Wednesdays</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>classes</span> are <span>held</span> in the morning from ten to <span>eleven</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 That's better for me actually.<br/>
🎧 And what about the <span>location</span>?<br/>
🎧 Where exactly are the <span>workshops</span> <span>held</span>?<br/>
🎧 They're in <span>building</span> <span>10A</span>,<br/>
🎧 there's a big <span>sign</span> on the <span>door</span>, you can't <span>miss</span> it,<br/>
🎧 and that's in <span>Fradstone</span> <span>Industrial</span> <span>Estate</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sorry?<br/>
🎧 <span>Fradstone</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's <span>Fradstone<br/></span>
🎧 And that's in <span>Grasford</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yes, up <span>past</span> the <span>station</span>.<br/>
🎧 And will I have any <span>parking</span> <span>problems</span> there?<br/>
🎧 No, there's always <span>plenty</span> <span>available</span>.<br/>
🎧 So would you like to <span>enrol</span> <span>Lydia</span> and <span>Carly</span> now?<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So can I <span>have..</span>.<br/>

🎧 Good morning, everyone, and <span>welcome</span> to <span>Stevenson's</span>,<br/>
🎧 one of the <span>country's</span> <span>major</span> <span>manufacturers</span> of <span>metal</span> <span>goods</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you for <span>choosing</span> us for your two <span>weeks</span> of work <span>experience</span>.<br/>
🎧 My name is <span>Julia</span> <span>Simmons</span>,<br/>
🎧 and since the <span>beginning</span> of this year I've been the <span>managing</span> <span>director</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Stevenson's</span> is quite an old company.<br/>
🎧 Like me, the <span>founder</span>, <span>Ronald</span> <span>Stevenson</span>, went into the <span>steel</span> <span>industry</span> when he <span>left</span> school,<br/>
🎧 that was in <span>1923</span>.<br/>
🎧 He set up this company when he <span>finished</span> his <span>apprenticeship</span>, in <span>1926</span>,<br/>
🎧 although he actually <span>started</span> <span>making</span> <span>plans</span> two years <span>earlier</span>, in <span>1924</span>.<br/>
🎧 He was a very <span>determined</span> young man!<br/>
🎧 <span>Stevenson's</span> <span>long-term</span> plan was to <span>manufacture</span> <span>components</span> for the <span>machine</span> <span>tools</span> <span>industry</span>,<br/>
🎧 although in <span>fact</span> that never came about,<br/>
🎧 and for the <span>automotive</span> <span>industry</span>, that is, <span>cars</span> and <span>lorries</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, there was a <span>delay</span> of <span>five</span> years before that <span>happened</span>,<br/>
🎧 because <span>shortly</span> before the company went into <span>production</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>Stevenson</span> was <span>given</span> the <span>opportunity</span> to make <span>goods</span> for <span>hospitals<br/></span>
🎧 and other <span>players</span> in the <span>healthcare</span> <span>industry</span>,<br/>
🎧 so that's what we did for the first <span>five</span> years.<br/>
🎧 Over the years, we've <span>expanded</span> the <span>premises</span> <span>considerably</span>,<br/>
🎧 we were <span>lucky</span> that the <span>site</span> is big enough,<br/>
🎧 so <span>moving</span> to a new <span>location</span> has never been <span>necessary</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, the <span>layout</span> is <span>far</span> from <span>ideal</span> for <span>modern</span> <span>machinery</span> and <span>production</span> <span>methods</span>,<br/>
🎧 so we <span>intend</span> to <span>carry</span> out <span>major</span> <span>refurbishment</span> of this <span>site</span> over the next <span>five</span> years.<br/>
🎧 I'd better give you some idea of what you'll be doing during your two <span>weeks</span> with us,<br/>
🎧 so you know what to <span>expect</span>.<br/>
🎧 Most <span>mornings</span> you'll have a <span>presentation</span> from one of the <span>managers</span>,<br/>
🎧 to learn about their <span>department</span>, <span>starting</span> this morning with <span>research</span> and <span>development</span>.<br/>
🎧 And you'll all <span>spend</span> some time in each <span>department</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>observing</span> what's going on and talking to people,<br/>
🎧 as long as you don't <span>stop</span> them from doing their work <span>altogether</span>!<br/>
🎧 In the <span>past</span>, a <span>teacher</span> from your school has come in at the end of each <span>week<br/></span>
🎧 to find out how the group were getting on,<br/>
🎧 but your school isn't able to <span>arrange</span> that this year.<br/>
🎧 OK, now I'll <span>briefly</span> help you to <span>orientate</span> <span>yourselves</span> around the <span>site</span>.<br/>
🎧 As you can see, we're in the <span>reception</span> <span>area</span>,<br/>
🎧 which we try to make <span>attractive</span> and <span>welcoming</span> to <span>visitors</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>corridor</span> <span>running</span> <span>left</span> from here,<br/>
🎧 and if you go along that,<br/>
🎧 the <span>door</span> <span>facing</span> you at the end is the <span>entrance</span> to the <span>coffee</span> room.<br/>
🎧 This looks out <span>onto</span> the <span>main</span> <span>road</span> on one side, and some <span>trees</span> on the other,<br/>
🎧 and <span>that'll</span> be where you meet each morning.<br/>
🎧 The <span>factory</span> is the very big room on the <span>far</span> side of the <span>site</span>.<br/>
🎧 Next to it is the <span>warehouse</span>,<br/>
🎧 which can be <span>accessed</span> by <span>lorries</span> going up the <span>road</span> to the <span>turning</span> <span>area</span> at the end.<br/>
🎧 You can get to the <span>warehouse</span> by <span>crossing</span> to the <span>far</span> side of the <span>courtyard</span>,<br/>
🎧 and then the <span>door</span> is on your right.<br/>
🎧 Somewhere you'll be <span>keen</span> to find is the <span>staff</span> <span>canteen</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is right next to <span>reception</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can <span>confidently</span> say that the <span>food's</span> very good,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>view</span> isn't.<br/>
🎧 The <span>windows</span> on one side look <span>onto</span> a <span>corridor</span> and <span>courtyard</span>,<br/>
🎧 which aren't very <span>attractive</span> at all,<br/>
🎧 and on the other <span>onto</span> the <span>access</span> <span>road</span>, which isn't much better.<br/>
🎧 You'll be <span>using</span> the <span>meeting</span> room quite often,<br/>
🎧 and you'll find it by <span>walking</span> along the <span>corridor</span> to the <span>left</span> of the <span>courtyard</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>continuing</span> along it to the end.<br/>
🎧 The <span>meeting</span> room is the last one on the right,<br/>
🎧 and I'm <span>afraid</span> there's no <span>natural</span> <span>daylight</span> in the room.<br/>
🎧 Then you'll need to know where some of the <span>offices</span> are.<br/>
🎧 The <span>human</span> <span>resources</span> <span>department</span> is at the <span>front</span> of this <span>building</span>,<br/>
🎧 so you <span>head</span> to the <span>left</span> along the <span>corridor</span> from <span>reception</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it's the second room you come to.<br/>
🎧 It looks out <span>onto</span> the <span>main</span> <span>road</span>.<br/>
🎧 And finally, the <span>boardroom</span>, where you'll be <span>meeting</span> sometimes.<br/>
🎧 That has quite a <span>pleasant</span> <span>view</span>, as it looks out <span>onto</span> the <span>trees</span>.<br/>
🎧 Go along the <span>corridor</span> <span>past</span> the <span>courtyard</span>, right to the end.<br/>
🎧 The <span>boardroom</span> is on the <span>left</span>, next to the <span>factory</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, now are there any <span>questions..</span>.<br/>

🎧 How are you getting on with your <span>art</span> <span>project</span>, <span>Tom</span>?<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Like, they gave us the <span>theme</span> of <span>birds</span> to <span>base</span> our <span>project</span> on,<br/>
🎧 and I'm not really all that interested in <span>wildlife</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I'm <span>starting</span> to get into it.<br/>
🎧 I've <span>pretty</span> well <span>finished</span> the <span>introductory</span> <span>stage</span>.<br/>
🎧 So have I.<br/>
🎧 When they gave us all those <span>handouts</span> with <span>details</span> of books and <span>websites</span> to look at,<br/>
🎧 I was really put off,<br/>
🎧 but the more I read, the more interested I got.<br/>
🎧 Me too.<br/>
🎧 I <span>found</span> I could <span>research</span> so many different <span>aspects</span> of <span>birds</span> in <span>art</span> <span>-</span> <span>colour</span>, <span>movement</span>, <span>texture</span>.<br/>
🎧 So I was looking forward to the <span>Bird</span> <span>Park</span> visit.<br/>
🎧 What a <span>letdown</span>!<br/>
🎧 It <span>poured</span> with <span>rain</span> and we <span>hardly</span> saw a <span>single</span> <span>bird</span>.<br/>
🎧 Much less use than the <span>trip</span> to the <span>Natural</span> <span>History</span> <span>Museum</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I <span>liked</span> all the <span>stuff</span> about <span>evolution</span> there.<br/>
🎧 The <span>workshop</span> <span>sessions</span> with <span>Dr</span> <span>Fletcher</span> were good too,<br/>
🎧 <span>especially</span> the <span>brainstorming</span> <span>sessions</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh..</span>. I <span>missed</span> those because I was <span>ill</span>.<br/>
🎧 I wish we could've <span>seen</span> the <span>projects</span> last <span>year's</span> students did.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mm</span>. I <span>suppose</span> they want us to do our own thing, not <span>copy</span>.<br/>
🎧 Have you <span>drafted</span> your <span>proposal</span> yet?<br/>
🎧 Yes, but I haven't <span>handed</span> it in.<br/>
🎧 I need to <span>amend</span> some <span>parts</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've <span>realised</span> the <span>notes</span> from my <span>research</span> are almost all just <span>descriptions</span>,<br/>
🎧 I haven't actually <span>evaluated</span> anything.<br/>
🎧 So I'll have to fix that.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I didn't know we had to do that.<br/>
🎧 I'll have to look at that too.<br/>
🎧 Did you do a <span>timeline</span> for the <span>project</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, and a <span>mind</span> map.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, so did I.<br/>
🎧 I quite <span>enjoyed</span> that.<br/>
🎧 But it was <span>hard</span> having to <span>explain</span> the <span>basis</span> for my <span>decisions</span> in my <span>action</span> plan.<br/>
🎧 What?<br/>
🎧 You know, give a <span>rationale</span>.<br/>
🎧 I didn't <span>realise</span> we had to do that.<br/>
🎧 OK, I can add it now.<br/>
🎧 And I've done the <span>video</span> <span>diary</span> <span>presentation</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>worked</span> out what I want my <span>outcome</span> to be in the <span>project</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Someone</span> told me it's best not to be too <span>precise</span> about your <span>actual</span> <span>outcome</span> at this <span>stage</span>,<br/>
🎧 so you have more <span>scope</span> to <span>explore</span> your <span>ideas</span> later on.<br/>
🎧 So I'm going to go back to my <span>proposal</span> to make it a bit more <span>vague</span>.<br/>
🎧 Really? OK, I'll change that too then.<br/>
🎧 One <span>part</span> of the <span>project</span> I'm <span>unsure</span> about is where we choose some <span>paintings</span> of <span>birds</span> and say what they mean to us.<br/>
🎧 Like, I <span>chose</span> a <span>painting</span> of a <span>falcon</span> by <span>Landseer</span>.<br/>
🎧 I like it because the <span>bird's</span> <span>standing</span> there with his <span>head</span> <span>turned</span> to one side,<br/>
🎧 but he <span>seems</span> to be <span>staring</span> <span>straight</span> at you.<br/>
🎧 But I can't just say it's a bit <span>scary</span>, can I?<br/>
🎧 You could talk about the <span>possible</span> <span>danger</span> <span>suggested</span> by the <span>bird's</span> look.<br/>
🎧 Oh, OK.<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>picture</span> of a <span>fish</span> <span>hawk</span> by <span>Audubon</span> I like.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>swooping</span> over the water with a <span>fish</span> in its <span>talons</span>,<br/>
🎧 and with great <span>black</span> <span>wings</span> which take up most of the <span>picture</span>.<br/>
🎧 So you could <span>discuss</span> it in <span>relation</span> to <span>predators</span> and food <span>chains</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well actually I think I'll <span>concentrate</span> on the <span>impression</span> of <span>rapid</span> <span>motion</span> it <span>gives</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Do you know that <span>picture</span> of a <span>kingfisher</span> by <span>van</span> <span>Gogh</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it's <span>perching</span> on a <span>reed</span> <span>growing</span> near a <span>stream</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's got these <span>beautiful</span> <span>blue</span> and red and <span>black</span> <span>shades</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've actually <span>chosen</span> it because I saw a <span>real</span> <span>kingfisher</span> once when I was little,<br/>
🎧 I was out <span>walking</span> with my <span>grandfather</span>, and I've never <span>forgotten</span> it.<br/>
🎧 So we can use a personal <span>link</span>?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>portrait</span> called <span>William</span> <span>Wells</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can't remember the <span>artist</span> but it's a <span>middle-aged</span> man who's just <span>shot</span> a <span>bird</span>.<br/>
🎧 And his <span>expression</span>, and the way he's <span>holding</span> the <span>bird</span> in his <span>hand<br/></span>
🎧 <span>suggests</span> he's not sure about what he's done.<br/>
🎧 To me it's about how <span>ambiguous</span> people are in the way they <span>exploit</span> the <span>natural</span> <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's <span>Gauguin's</span> <span>picture</span> <span>Vairumati</span>.<br/>
🎧 He did it in <span>Tahiti</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>woman</span> with a <span>white</span> <span>bird</span> behind her that is <span>eating</span> a <span>lizard</span>,<br/>
🎧 and what I'm interested in is what idea this <span>bird</span> <span>refers</span> to.<br/>
🎧 <span>Apparently</span>, it's a <span>reference</span> to the <span>never-ending</span> <span>cycle</span> of <span>existence</span>.<br/>
🎧 Wow.<br/>
🎧 I <span>chose</span> a <span>portrait</span> of a little boy, <span>Giovanni</span> <span>de</span> <span>Medici</span>.<br/>
🎧 He's <span>holding</span> a <span>tiny</span> <span>bird</span> in one <span>fist</span>.<br/>
🎧 I like the way he's <span>holding</span> it <span>carefully</span> so he doesn't <span>hurt</span> it.<br/>
🎧 Ah right.<br/>

🎧 <span>Ancient</span> <span>philosophy</span> is not just about talking or <span>lecturing</span>,<br/>
🎧 or even <span>reading</span> long, <span>dense</span> books.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, it is something people have used <span>throughout</span> <span>history</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 to <span>solve</span> their <span>problems</span> and to <span>achieve</span> their <span>greatest</span> <span>triumphs</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Specifically</span>, I am <span>referring</span> to <span>Stoicism</span>,<br/>
🎧 which, in my <span>opinion</span>, is the most <span>practical</span> of all <span>philosophies<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>therefore</span> the most <span>appealing</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Stoicism</span> was <span>founded</span> in <span>Ancient</span> <span>Greece</span> by <span>Zeno</span> of <span>Citium</span> in the <span>early</span> <span>3rd</span> <span>century</span> <span>BC</span>,<br/>
🎧 but was <span>practised</span> by the likes of <span>Epictetus</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>Cato</span>, <span>Seneca</span> and <span>Marcus</span> <span>Aurelius</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Amazingly</span>, we still have <span>access</span> to these <span>ideas</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>despite</span> the <span>fact</span> that the most famous <span>Stoics</span> never <span>wrote</span> anything down for <span>publication</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>Cato</span> definitely didn't.<br/>
🎧 <span>Marcus</span> <span>Aurelius</span> never <span>intended</span> his <span>Meditations</span> to be anything but personal.<br/>
🎧 <span>Seneca's</span> <span>letters</span> were, well, <span>letters<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>Epictetus'</span> <span>thoughts</span> come to us by way of a <span>note-taking</span> student.<br/>
🎧 <span>Stoic</span> <span>principles</span> were <span>based</span> on the idea that its <span>followers</span> could have an <span>unshakable</span> <span>happiness</span> in this <span>life<br/></span>
🎧 and the key to <span>achieving</span> this was <span>virtue</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>road</span> to <span>virtue</span>, in <span>turn</span>, lay in <span>understanding</span> that <span>destructive</span> <span>emotions</span>, like <span>anger</span> and <span>jealousy</span>,<br/>
🎧 are under our <span>conscious</span> <span>control</span>,<br/>
🎧 they don't have to <span>control</span> us, because we can learn to <span>control</span> them.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>words</span> of <span>Epictetus</span>:<br/>
🎧 <span>“external</span> <span>events</span> I <span>cannot</span> <span>control</span>, but the <span>choices</span> I make with <span>regard</span> to them, I do <span>control”</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>modern</span> day <span>philosopher</span> and <span>writer</span> <span>Nassim</span> <span>Nicholas</span> <span>Taleb<br/></span>
🎧 <span>defines</span> a <span>Stoic</span> as <span>someone</span> who has a different <span>perspective</span> on <span>experiences<br/></span>
🎧 which most of us would see as <span>wholly</span> <span>negative;<br/></span>
🎧 a <span>Stoic</span> <span>“transforms</span> <span>fear</span> into <span>caution</span>, <span>pain</span> into <span>transformation</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>mistakes</span> into <span>initiation</span> and <span>desire</span> into <span>undertaking”</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Using</span> this <span>definition</span> as a <span>model</span>,<br/>
🎧 we can see that <span>throughout</span> the <span>centuries</span> <span>Stoicism</span> has been <span>practised</span> in more <span>recent</span> <span>history<br/></span>
🎧 by <span>kings</span>, <span>presidents</span>, <span>artists</span>, <span>writers</span> and <span>entrepreneurs</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>founding</span> <span>fathers</span> of the <span>United</span> <span>States</span> were <span>inspired</span> by the <span>philosophy</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>George</span> <span>Washington</span> was <span>introduced</span> to <span>Stoicism</span> by his <span>neighbours</span> at age <span>seventeen</span>,<br/>
🎧 and later, put on a play <span>based</span> on the life of <span>Cato</span> to <span>inspire</span> his men.<br/>
🎧 <span>Thomas</span> <span>Jefferson</span> <span>kept</span> a <span>copy</span> of <span>Seneca</span> <span>beside</span> his bed.<br/>
🎧 <span>Writers</span> and <span>artists</span> have also been <span>inspired</span> by the <span>stoics</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Eugène</span> <span>Delacroix</span>, the <span>renowned</span> <span>French</span> <span>Romantic</span> <span>artist<br/></span>
🎧 <span>(known</span> best for his <span>painting</span> <span>Liberty</span> <span>Leading</span> the <span>People)<br/></span>
🎧 was an <span>ardent</span> <span>Stoic</span>, <span>referring</span> to it as his <span>“consoling</span> <span>religion”</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>economist</span> <span>Adam</span> <span>Smith's</span> <span>theories</span> on <span>capitalism</span> were <span>significantly</span> <span>influenced</span> by the <span>Stoicism<br/></span>
🎧 that he <span>studied</span> as a <span>schoolboy</span>, under a <span>teacher</span> who had <span>translated</span> <span>Marcus</span> <span>Aurelius'</span> <span>works</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Today's</span> <span>political</span> <span>leaders</span> are no different,<br/>
🎧 with many <span>finding</span> their <span>inspiration</span> from the <span>ancient</span> <span>texts</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Former</span> US <span>president</span> <span>Bill</span> <span>Clinton</span> <span>rereads</span> <span>Marcus</span> <span>Aurelius</span> every <span>single</span> year,<br/>
🎧 and many have <span>compared</span> <span>former</span> <span>President</span> <span>Obama's</span> <span>calm</span> <span>leadership</span> <span>style</span> to that of <span>Cato</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Wen</span> <span>Jiabao</span>, the <span>former</span> <span>prime</span> <span>minister</span> of <span>China</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>claims</span> that <span>Meditations</span> is one of two books he <span>travels</span> <span>with<br/></span>
🎧 and that he has read it more than <span>100</span> <span>times</span> over the course of his life.<br/>
🎧 <span>Stoicism</span> had a <span>profound</span> <span>influence</span> on <span>Albert</span> <span>Ellis</span>,<br/>
🎧 who <span>invented</span> <span>Cognitive</span> <span>Behaviour</span> <span>Therapy</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is used to help people <span>manage</span> their <span>problems</span> by <span>changing</span> the way that they think and <span>behave</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's most <span>commonly</span> used to <span>treat</span> <span>depression</span>.<br/>
🎧 The idea is that we can take <span>control</span> of our lives by <span>challenging</span> the <span>irrational</span> <span>beliefs<br/></span>
🎧 that <span>create</span> our <span>faulty</span> thinking, <span>symptoms</span> and <span>behaviours</span> by <span>using</span> <span>logic</span> <span>instead</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Stoicism</span> has also become <span>popular</span> in the <span>world</span> of <span>business</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Stoic</span> <span>principles</span> can <span>build</span> the <span>resilience</span> and <span>state</span> of <span>mind</span> <span>required</span> to <span>overcome</span> <span>setbacks<br/></span>
🎧 because <span>Stoics</span> <span>teach</span> <span>turning</span> <span>obstacles</span> into <span>opportunity</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>lesson</span> every <span>business</span> <span>entrepreneur</span> needs to learn.<br/>
🎧 I would <span>argue</span> that <span>studying</span> <span>Stoicism</span> is as <span>relevant</span> today as it was <span>2,000</span> years ago,<br/>
🎧 thanks to its <span>brilliant</span> <span>insights</span> into how to <span>lead</span> a good life.<br/>
🎧 At the very <span>root</span> of the thinking, there is a very simple way of living <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>control</span> what you can and <span>accept</span> what you can't.<br/>
🎧 This is not as easy as it sounds and will <span>require</span> <span>considerable</span> practice <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it can take a <span>lifetime</span> to <span>master</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Stoics</span> also <span>believed</span> the most important <span>foundation</span> for a good and happy life is not money, <span>fame</span>, <span>power</span> or <span>pleasure</span>,<br/>
🎧 but having a <span>disciplined</span> and <span>principled</span> <span>character</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 something which <span>seems</span> to <span>resonate</span> with many people today.<br/>
