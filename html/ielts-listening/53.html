🎧 Hello. Children's</span> Engineering</span> Workshops</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh hello.<br/>
🎧 I wanted some information</span> about the workshops</span> in the school holidays</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 I have two daughters</span> who are interested.<br/>
🎧 The younger</span> one's</span> Lydia</span>, she's four</span>,<br/>
🎧 do you take children as young as that?<br/>
🎧 Yes,<br/>
🎧 our Tiny</span> Engineers</span> workshop</span> is for four</span> to five-year-olds</span>.<br/>
🎧 What sorts</span> of activities</span> do they do?<br/>
🎧 All sorts</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, they work together to design</span> a special cover</span> that goes</span> round</span> an egg,<br/>
🎧 so that when it's inside they can drop</span> it from a height</span> and it doesn't break</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, sometimes it does break</span> but that's part</span> of the fun!<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And Lydia</span> loves</span> building</span> things.<br/>
🎧 Is there any opportunity</span> for her to do that?<br/>
🎧 Well, they have a competition</span> to see who can make the highest</span> tower</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'd be amazed</span> how high they can go.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 But they're learning</span> all the time as well as having fun.<br/>
🎧 For example, one thing they do is to design</span> and build</span> a car that's attached</span> to a balloon</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the force</span> of the air in that actually powers</span> the car and makes it move along.<br/>
🎧 They go really fast</span> too.<br/>
🎧 OK, well, all this sounds perfect.<br/>
🎧 Now Carly</span>, that's my older</span> daughter</span>, has just had her seventh</span> birthday</span>,<br/>
🎧 so presumably</span> she'd be in a different group?<br/>
🎧 Yes, she'd be in the Junior</span> Engineers</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's for children from six to eight</span>.<br/>
🎧 And do they do the same sorts</span> of activities</span>?<br/>
🎧 Some are the same, but a bit more advanced</span>.<br/>
🎧 So they work out how to build</span> model</span> vehicles</span>,<br/>
🎧 things like cars</span> and trucks</span>,<br/>
🎧 but also how to construct</span> animals</span> using</span> the same sorts</span> of material</span> and technique</span>,<br/>
🎧 and then they learn how they can program</span> them and make them move.<br/>
🎧 So they learn a bit of coding</span>?<br/>
🎧 They do.<br/>
🎧 They pick</span> it up really quickly.<br/>
🎧 We're there to help if they need it,<br/>
🎧 but they learn from one another too.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And do they have competitions</span> too?<br/>
🎧 Yes, with the Junior</span> Engineers</span>,<br/>
🎧 it's to use recycled</span> materials</span> like card</span> and wood</span> to build</span> a bridge</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the longest</span> one gets</span> a prize</span>.<br/>
🎧 That sounds fun.<br/>
🎧 I wouldn't mind</span> doing that myself!<br/>
🎧 Then they have something a bit different,<br/>
🎧 which is to think up an idea for a five-minute</span> movie and then film</span> it,<br/>
🎧 using</span> special animation</span> software</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'd be amazed</span> what they come up with.<br/>
🎧 And of course, that's something they can put on their phone and take home to show all their friends.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 And then they also build</span> a robot</span> in the shape</span> of a human</span>,<br/>
🎧 and they decorate</span> it and program</span> it so that it can move its arms</span> and legs</span>.<br/>
🎧 Perfect.<br/>
🎧 So, is it the same price</span> as the Tiny</span> Engineers</span>?<br/>
🎧 It's just a bit more:<br/>
🎧 £50</span> for the five</span> weeks</span>.<br/>
🎧 And are the classes</span> on a Monday</span>, too?<br/>
🎧 They used to be,<br/>
🎧 but we found</span> it didn't give our staff</span> enough time to clear</span> up after the first workshop</span>,<br/>
🎧 so we moved</span> them to Wednesdays</span>.<br/>
🎧 The classes</span> are held</span> in the morning from ten to eleven</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 That's better for me actually.<br/>
🎧 And what about the location</span>?<br/>
🎧 Where exactly are the workshops</span> held</span>?<br/>
🎧 They're in building</span> 10A</span>,<br/>
🎧 there's a big sign</span> on the door</span>, you can't miss</span> it,<br/>
🎧 and that's in Fradstone</span> Industrial</span> Estate</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sorry?<br/>
🎧 Fradstone</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's Fradstone<br/></span>
🎧 And that's in Grasford</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yes, up past</span> the station</span>.<br/>
🎧 And will I have any parking</span> problems</span> there?<br/>
🎧 No, there's always plenty</span> available</span>.<br/>
🎧 So would you like to enrol</span> Lydia</span> and Carly</span> now?<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So can I have..</span>.<br/>

🎧 Good morning, everyone, and welcome</span> to Stevenson's</span>,<br/>
🎧 one of the country's</span> major</span> manufacturers</span> of metal</span> goods</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you for choosing</span> us for your two weeks</span> of work experience</span>.<br/>
🎧 My name is Julia</span> Simmons</span>,<br/>
🎧 and since the beginning</span> of this year I've been the managing</span> director</span>.<br/>
🎧 Stevenson's</span> is quite an old company.<br/>
🎧 Like me, the founder</span>, Ronald</span> Stevenson</span>, went into the steel</span> industry</span> when he left</span> school,<br/>
🎧 that was in 1923</span>.<br/>
🎧 He set up this company when he finished</span> his apprenticeship</span>, in 1926</span>,<br/>
🎧 although he actually started</span> making</span> plans</span> two years earlier</span>, in 1924</span>.<br/>
🎧 He was a very determined</span> young man!<br/>
🎧 Stevenson's</span> long-term</span> plan was to manufacture</span> components</span> for the machine</span> tools</span> industry</span>,<br/>
🎧 although in fact</span> that never came about,<br/>
🎧 and for the automotive</span> industry</span>, that is, cars</span> and lorries</span>.<br/>
🎧 However</span>, there was a delay</span> of five</span> years before that happened</span>,<br/>
🎧 because shortly</span> before the company went into production</span>,<br/>
🎧 Stevenson</span> was given</span> the opportunity</span> to make goods</span> for hospitals<br/></span>
🎧 and other players</span> in the healthcare</span> industry</span>,<br/>
🎧 so that's what we did for the first five</span> years.<br/>
🎧 Over the years, we've expanded</span> the premises</span> considerably</span>,<br/>
🎧 we were lucky</span> that the site</span> is big enough,<br/>
🎧 so moving</span> to a new location</span> has never been necessary</span>.<br/>
🎧 However</span>, the layout</span> is far</span> from ideal</span> for modern</span> machinery</span> and production</span> methods</span>,<br/>
🎧 so we intend</span> to carry</span> out major</span> refurbishment</span> of this site</span> over the next five</span> years.<br/>
🎧 I'd better give you some idea of what you'll be doing during your two weeks</span> with us,<br/>
🎧 so you know what to expect</span>.<br/>
🎧 Most mornings</span> you'll have a presentation</span> from one of the managers</span>,<br/>
🎧 to learn about their department</span>, starting</span> this morning with research</span> and development</span>.<br/>
🎧 And you'll all spend</span> some time in each department</span>,<br/>
🎧 observing</span> what's going on and talking to people,<br/>
🎧 as long as you don't stop</span> them from doing their work altogether</span>!<br/>
🎧 In the past</span>, a teacher</span> from your school has come in at the end of each week<br/></span>
🎧 to find out how the group were getting on,<br/>
🎧 but your school isn't able to arrange</span> that this year.<br/>
🎧 OK, now I'll briefly</span> help you to orientate</span> yourselves</span> around the site</span>.<br/>
🎧 As you can see, we're in the reception</span> area</span>,<br/>
🎧 which we try to make attractive</span> and welcoming</span> to visitors</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's a corridor</span> running</span> left</span> from here,<br/>
🎧 and if you go along that,<br/>
🎧 the door</span> facing</span> you at the end is the entrance</span> to the coffee</span> room.<br/>
🎧 This looks out onto</span> the main</span> road</span> on one side, and some trees</span> on the other,<br/>
🎧 and that'll</span> be where you meet each morning.<br/>
🎧 The factory</span> is the very big room on the far</span> side of the site</span>.<br/>
🎧 Next to it is the warehouse</span>,<br/>
🎧 which can be accessed</span> by lorries</span> going up the road</span> to the turning</span> area</span> at the end.<br/>
🎧 You can get to the warehouse</span> by crossing</span> to the far</span> side of the courtyard</span>,<br/>
🎧 and then the door</span> is on your right.<br/>
🎧 Somewhere you'll be keen</span> to find is the staff</span> canteen</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is right next to reception</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can confidently</span> say that the food's</span> very good,<br/>
🎧 but the view</span> isn't.<br/>
🎧 The windows</span> on one side look onto</span> a corridor</span> and courtyard</span>,<br/>
🎧 which aren't very attractive</span> at all,<br/>
🎧 and on the other onto</span> the access</span> road</span>, which isn't much better.<br/>
🎧 You'll be using</span> the meeting</span> room quite often,<br/>
🎧 and you'll find it by walking</span> along the corridor</span> to the left</span> of the courtyard</span>,<br/>
🎧 and continuing</span> along it to the end.<br/>
🎧 The meeting</span> room is the last one on the right,<br/>
🎧 and I'm afraid</span> there's no natural</span> daylight</span> in the room.<br/>
🎧 Then you'll need to know where some of the offices</span> are.<br/>
🎧 The human</span> resources</span> department</span> is at the front</span> of this building</span>,<br/>
🎧 so you head</span> to the left</span> along the corridor</span> from reception</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it's the second room you come to.<br/>
🎧 It looks out onto</span> the main</span> road</span>.<br/>
🎧 And finally, the boardroom</span>, where you'll be meeting</span> sometimes.<br/>
🎧 That has quite a pleasant</span> view</span>, as it looks out onto</span> the trees</span>.<br/>
🎧 Go along the corridor</span> past</span> the courtyard</span>, right to the end.<br/>
🎧 The boardroom</span> is on the left</span>, next to the factory</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, now are there any questions..</span>.<br/>

🎧 How are you getting on with your art</span> project</span>, Tom</span>?<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Like, they gave us the theme</span> of birds</span> to base</span> our project</span> on,<br/>
🎧 and I'm not really all that interested in wildlife</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I'm starting</span> to get into it.<br/>
🎧 I've pretty</span> well finished</span> the introductory</span> stage</span>.<br/>
🎧 So have I.<br/>
🎧 When they gave us all those handouts</span> with details</span> of books and websites</span> to look at,<br/>
🎧 I was really put off,<br/>
🎧 but the more I read, the more interested I got.<br/>
🎧 Me too.<br/>
🎧 I found</span> I could research</span> so many different aspects</span> of birds</span> in art</span> -</span> colour</span>, movement</span>, texture</span>.<br/>
🎧 So I was looking forward to the Bird</span> Park</span> visit.<br/>
🎧 What a letdown</span>!<br/>
🎧 It poured</span> with rain</span> and we hardly</span> saw a single</span> bird</span>.<br/>
🎧 Much less use than the trip</span> to the Natural</span> History</span> Museum</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I liked</span> all the stuff</span> about evolution</span> there.<br/>
🎧 The workshop</span> sessions</span> with Dr</span> Fletcher</span> were good too,<br/>
🎧 especially</span> the brainstorming</span> sessions</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh..</span>. I missed</span> those because I was ill</span>.<br/>
🎧 I wish we could've seen</span> the projects</span> last year's</span> students did.<br/>
🎧 Mm</span>. I suppose</span> they want us to do our own thing, not copy</span>.<br/>
🎧 Have you drafted</span> your proposal</span> yet?<br/>
🎧 Yes, but I haven't handed</span> it in.<br/>
🎧 I need to amend</span> some parts</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've realised</span> the notes</span> from my research</span> are almost all just descriptions</span>,<br/>
🎧 I haven't actually evaluated</span> anything.<br/>
🎧 So I'll have to fix that.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I didn't know we had to do that.<br/>
🎧 I'll have to look at that too.<br/>
🎧 Did you do a timeline</span> for the project</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, and a mind</span> map.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, so did I.<br/>
🎧 I quite enjoyed</span> that.<br/>
🎧 But it was hard</span> having to explain</span> the basis</span> for my decisions</span> in my action</span> plan.<br/>
🎧 What?<br/>
🎧 You know, give a rationale</span>.<br/>
🎧 I didn't realise</span> we had to do that.<br/>
🎧 OK, I can add it now.<br/>
🎧 And I've done the video</span> diary</span> presentation</span>,<br/>
🎧 and worked</span> out what I want my outcome</span> to be in the project</span>.<br/>
🎧 Someone</span> told me it's best not to be too precise</span> about your actual</span> outcome</span> at this stage</span>,<br/>
🎧 so you have more scope</span> to explore</span> your ideas</span> later on.<br/>
🎧 So I'm going to go back to my proposal</span> to make it a bit more vague</span>.<br/>
🎧 Really? OK, I'll change that too then.<br/>
🎧 One part</span> of the project</span> I'm unsure</span> about is where we choose some paintings</span> of birds</span> and say what they mean to us.<br/>
🎧 Like, I chose</span> a painting</span> of a falcon</span> by Landseer</span>.<br/>
🎧 I like it because the bird's</span> standing</span> there with his head</span> turned</span> to one side,<br/>
🎧 but he seems</span> to be staring</span> straight</span> at you.<br/>
🎧 But I can't just say it's a bit scary</span>, can I?<br/>
🎧 You could talk about the possible</span> danger</span> suggested</span> by the bird's</span> look.<br/>
🎧 Oh, OK.<br/>
🎧 There's a picture</span> of a fish</span> hawk</span> by Audubon</span> I like.<br/>
🎧 It's swooping</span> over the water with a fish</span> in its talons</span>,<br/>
🎧 and with great black</span> wings</span> which take up most of the picture</span>.<br/>
🎧 So you could discuss</span> it in relation</span> to predators</span> and food chains</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well actually I think I'll concentrate</span> on the impression</span> of rapid</span> motion</span> it gives</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Do you know that picture</span> of a kingfisher</span> by van</span> Gogh</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 it's perching</span> on a reed</span> growing</span> near a stream</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's got these beautiful</span> blue</span> and red and black</span> shades</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've actually chosen</span> it because I saw a real</span> kingfisher</span> once when I was little,<br/>
🎧 I was out walking</span> with my grandfather</span>, and I've never forgotten</span> it.<br/>
🎧 So we can use a personal link</span>?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 There's a portrait</span> called William</span> Wells</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can't remember the artist</span> but it's a middle-aged</span> man who's just shot</span> a bird</span>.<br/>
🎧 And his expression</span>, and the way he's holding</span> the bird</span> in his hand<br/></span>
🎧 suggests</span> he's not sure about what he's done.<br/>
🎧 To me it's about how ambiguous</span> people are in the way they exploit</span> the natural</span> world</span>.<br/>
🎧 Interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's Gauguin's</span> picture</span> Vairumati</span>.<br/>
🎧 He did it in Tahiti</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a woman</span> with a white</span> bird</span> behind her that is eating</span> a lizard</span>,<br/>
🎧 and what I'm interested in is what idea this bird</span> refers</span> to.<br/>
🎧 Apparently</span>, it's a reference</span> to the never-ending</span> cycle</span> of existence</span>.<br/>
🎧 Wow.<br/>
🎧 I chose</span> a portrait</span> of a little boy, Giovanni</span> de</span> Medici</span>.<br/>
🎧 He's holding</span> a tiny</span> bird</span> in one fist</span>.<br/>
🎧 I like the way he's holding</span> it carefully</span> so he doesn't hurt</span> it.<br/>
🎧 Ah right.<br/>

🎧 Ancient</span> philosophy</span> is not just about talking or lecturing</span>,<br/>
🎧 or even reading</span> long, dense</span> books.<br/>
🎧 In fact</span>, it is something people have used throughout</span> history</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 to solve</span> their problems</span> and to achieve</span> their greatest</span> triumphs</span>.<br/>
🎧 Specifically</span>, I am referring</span> to Stoicism</span>,<br/>
🎧 which, in my opinion</span>, is the most practical</span> of all philosophies<br/></span>
🎧 and therefore</span> the most appealing</span>.<br/>
🎧 Stoicism</span> was founded</span> in Ancient</span> Greece</span> by Zeno</span> of Citium</span> in the early</span> 3rd</span> century</span> BC</span>,<br/>
🎧 but was practised</span> by the likes of Epictetus</span>,<br/>
🎧 Cato</span>, Seneca</span> and Marcus</span> Aurelius</span>.<br/>
🎧 Amazingly</span>, we still have access</span> to these ideas</span>,<br/>
🎧 despite</span> the fact</span> that the most famous Stoics</span> never wrote</span> anything down for publication</span>,<br/>
🎧 Cato</span> definitely didn't.<br/>
🎧 Marcus</span> Aurelius</span> never intended</span> his Meditations</span> to be anything but personal.<br/>
🎧 Seneca's</span> letters</span> were, well, letters<br/></span>
🎧 and Epictetus'</span> thoughts</span> come to us by way of a note-taking</span> student.<br/>
🎧 Stoic</span> principles</span> were based</span> on the idea that its followers</span> could have an unshakable</span> happiness</span> in this life<br/></span>
🎧 and the key to achieving</span> this was virtue</span>.<br/>
🎧 The road</span> to virtue</span>, in turn</span>, lay in understanding</span> that destructive</span> emotions</span>, like anger</span> and jealousy</span>,<br/>
🎧 are under our conscious</span> control</span>,<br/>
🎧 they don't have to control</span> us, because we can learn to control</span> them.<br/>
🎧 In the words</span> of Epictetus</span>:<br/>
🎧 “external</span> events</span> I cannot</span> control</span>, but the choices</span> I make with regard</span> to them, I do control”</span>.<br/>
🎧 The modern</span> day philosopher</span> and writer</span> Nassim</span> Nicholas</span> Taleb<br/></span>
🎧 defines</span> a Stoic</span> as someone</span> who has a different perspective</span> on experiences<br/></span>
🎧 which most of us would see as wholly</span> negative;<br/></span>
🎧 a Stoic</span> “transforms</span> fear</span> into caution</span>, pain</span> into transformation</span>,<br/>
🎧 mistakes</span> into initiation</span> and desire</span> into undertaking”</span>.<br/>
🎧 Using</span> this definition</span> as a model</span>,<br/>
🎧 we can see that throughout</span> the centuries</span> Stoicism</span> has been practised</span> in more recent</span> history<br/></span>
🎧 by kings</span>, presidents</span>, artists</span>, writers</span> and entrepreneurs</span>.<br/>
🎧 The founding</span> fathers</span> of the United</span> States</span> were inspired</span> by the philosophy</span>.<br/>
🎧 George</span> Washington</span> was introduced</span> to Stoicism</span> by his neighbours</span> at age seventeen</span>,<br/>
🎧 and later, put on a play based</span> on the life of Cato</span> to inspire</span> his men.<br/>
🎧 Thomas</span> Jefferson</span> kept</span> a copy</span> of Seneca</span> beside</span> his bed.<br/>
🎧 Writers</span> and artists</span> have also been inspired</span> by the stoics</span>.<br/>
🎧 Eugène</span> Delacroix</span>, the renowned</span> French</span> Romantic</span> artist<br/></span>
🎧 (known</span> best for his painting</span> Liberty</span> Leading</span> the People)<br/></span>
🎧 was an ardent</span> Stoic</span>, referring</span> to it as his “consoling</span> religion”</span>.<br/>
🎧 The economist</span> Adam</span> Smith's</span> theories</span> on capitalism</span> were significantly</span> influenced</span> by the Stoicism<br/></span>
🎧 that he studied</span> as a schoolboy</span>, under a teacher</span> who had translated</span> Marcus</span> Aurelius'</span> works</span>.<br/>
🎧 Today's</span> political</span> leaders</span> are no different,<br/>
🎧 with many finding</span> their inspiration</span> from the ancient</span> texts</span>.<br/>
🎧 Former</span> US president</span> Bill</span> Clinton</span> rereads</span> Marcus</span> Aurelius</span> every single</span> year,<br/>
🎧 and many have compared</span> former</span> President</span> Obama's</span> calm</span> leadership</span> style</span> to that of Cato</span>.<br/>
🎧 Wen</span> Jiabao</span>, the former</span> prime</span> minister</span> of China</span>,<br/>
🎧 claims</span> that Meditations</span> is one of two books he travels</span> with<br/></span>
🎧 and that he has read it more than 100</span> times</span> over the course of his life.<br/>
🎧 Stoicism</span> had a profound</span> influence</span> on Albert</span> Ellis</span>,<br/>
🎧 who invented</span> Cognitive</span> Behaviour</span> Therapy</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is used to help people manage</span> their problems</span> by changing</span> the way that they think and behave</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's most commonly</span> used to treat</span> depression</span>.<br/>
🎧 The idea is that we can take control</span> of our lives by challenging</span> the irrational</span> beliefs<br/></span>
🎧 that create</span> our faulty</span> thinking, symptoms</span> and behaviours</span> by using</span> logic</span> instead</span>.<br/>
🎧 Stoicism</span> has also become popular</span> in the world</span> of business</span>.<br/>
🎧 Stoic</span> principles</span> can build</span> the resilience</span> and state</span> of mind</span> required</span> to overcome</span> setbacks<br/></span>
🎧 because Stoics</span> teach</span> turning</span> obstacles</span> into opportunity</span>.<br/>
🎧 A lesson</span> every business</span> entrepreneur</span> needs to learn.<br/>
🎧 I would argue</span> that studying</span> Stoicism</span> is as relevant</span> today as it was 2,000</span> years ago,<br/>
🎧 thanks to its brilliant</span> insights</span> into how to lead</span> a good life.<br/>
🎧 At the very root</span> of the thinking, there is a very simple way of living -<br/></span>
🎧 control</span> what you can and accept</span> what you can't.<br/>
🎧 This is not as easy as it sounds and will require</span> considerable</span> practice -<br/></span>
🎧 it can take a lifetime</span> to master</span>.<br/>
🎧 The Stoics</span> also believed</span> the most important foundation</span> for a good and happy life is not money, fame</span>, power</span> or pleasure</span>,<br/>
🎧 but having a disciplined</span> and principled</span> character</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 something which seems</span> to resonate</span> with many people today.<br/>
