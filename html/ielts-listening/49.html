🎧 Hello <span>William</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is <span>Amber</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 you said to phone if I wanted to get more <span>information</span> about the <span>job</span> <span>agency</span> you <span>mentioned</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is now a good time?<br/>
🎧 Oh, hi <span>Amber</span>. Yes. Fine.<br/>
🎧 So the <span>agency</span> I was talking about is called <span>Bankside</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 they're <span>based</span> in <span>Docklands</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 I can tell you the <span>address</span> now <span>-</span> <span>497</span> <span>Eastside</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, thanks.<br/>
🎧 So is there <span>anyone</span> in <span>particular</span> I should speak to there?<br/>
🎧 The <span>agent</span> I always <span>deal</span> with is called <span>Becky</span> <span>Jamieson</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let me <span>write</span> that down <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Becky…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Jamieson<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Jamieson<br/></span>
🎧 Do you have her <span>direct</span> <span>line</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's in my <span>contacts</span> somewhere <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 right, here we are:<br/>
🎧 <span>07866510333</span>.<br/>
🎧 I wouldn't call her until the <span>afternoon</span> if I were you <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 she's always really <span>busy</span> in the morning trying to <span>fill</span> <span>last-minute</span> <span>vacancies</span>.<br/>
🎧 She's really <span>helpful</span> and <span>friendly</span> so I'm sure it would be <span>worth</span> getting in touch with her for an <span>informal</span> <span>chat</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>mainly</span> <span>clerical</span> and <span>admin</span> <span>jobs</span> they <span>deal</span> with, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 I know you're <span>hoping</span> to find a <span>full-time</span> <span>job</span> in the <span>media</span> <span>eventually</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 but <span>Becky</span> <span>mostly</span> <span>recruits</span> <span>temporary</span> <span>staff</span> for the <span>finance</span> <span>sector</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 which will look good on your <span>CV</span> <span>-</span> and <span>generally</span> <span>pays</span> better too.<br/>
🎧 Yeah <span>-</span> I'm just a bit <span>worried</span> because I don't have much <span>office</span> <span>experience</span>.<br/>
🎧 I wouldn't <span>worry</span>.<br/>
🎧 They'll probably start you as a <span>receptionist</span>, or something like that.<br/>
🎧 So what's important for that kind of <span>job</span> isn't so much having <span>business</span> <span>skills</span> <span>or<br/></span>
🎧 <span>knowing</span> lots of different <span>computer</span> <span>systems</span> <span>-</span> it's <span>communication</span> that really <span>matters</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 so you'd be fine there.<br/>
🎧 And you'll <span>pick</span> up <span>office</span> <span>skills</span> really quickly on the <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's not that <span>complicated</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK good.<br/>
🎧 So how long do people <span>generally</span> need <span>temporary</span> <span>staff</span> for?<br/>
🎧 It would be great if I could get something <span>lasting</span> at <span>least</span> a month.<br/>
🎧 That shouldn't be too <span>difficult</span>.<br/>
🎧 But you're more <span>likely</span> to be <span>offered</span> something for a week at first, which might get <span>extended</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>unusual</span> to be <span>sent</span> somewhere for just a day or two.<br/>
🎧 Right,<br/>
🎧 I've heard the pay isn't too bad <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 better than working in a <span>shop</span> or a <span>restaurant</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes <span>-</span> definitely.<br/>
🎧 The <span>hourly</span> <span>rate</span> is about <span>£10</span>, <span>11</span> if you're <span>lucky</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>pretty</span> good.<br/>
🎧 I was only <span>expecting</span> to get <span>eight</span> or <span>nine</span> <span>pounds</span> an <span>hour</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you want me to tell you anything about the <span>registration</span> <span>process</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, please.<br/>
🎧 I know you have to have an <span>interview</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>interview</span> usually takes about an <span>hour<br/></span>
🎧 and you should <span>arrange</span> that about a week in <span>advance</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> I should <span>dress</span> <span>smartly</span> if it's for <span>office</span> work <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 I can probably <span>borrow</span> a <span>suit</span> from <span>Mum</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good idea.<br/>
🎧 It's better to look too <span>smart</span> than too <span>casual</span>.<br/>
🎧 Will I need to <span>bring</span> <span>copies</span> of my <span>exam</span> <span>certificates</span> or anything like that?<br/>
🎧 No <span>-</span> they don't need to see those, I don't think.<br/>
🎧 What about my <span>passport</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes <span>-</span> they will ask to see that.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 I wouldn't get <span>stressed</span> about the <span>interview</span> though.<br/>
🎧 It's just a <span>chance</span> for them to <span>build</span> <span>relationship</span> with you <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 so they can try and <span>match</span> you to a <span>job</span> which you'll like.<br/>
🎧 So there are <span>questions</span> about <span>personality</span> that they always ask <span>candidates</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>fairly</span> <span>basic</span> <span>ones</span>.<br/>
🎧 And they probably won't ask anything too <span>difficult</span> like what your <span>plans</span> are for the future.<br/>
🎧 Hope not.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, there are lots of <span>benefits</span> to <span>using</span> an <span>agency</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 for example, the <span>interview</span> will be <span>useful</span> because they'll give you <span>feedback</span> on your <span>performance<br/></span>
🎧 so you can <span>improve</span> next time.<br/>
🎧 And they'll have <span>access</span> to <span>jobs</span> which aren't <span>advertised</span>.<br/>
🎧 Exactly <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 most <span>temporary</span> <span>jobs</span> aren't <span>advertised</span>.<br/>
🎧 And I <span>expect</span> <span>finding</span> a <span>temporary</span> <span>job</span> this way takes a lot less time <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it's much <span>easier</span> than <span>ringing</span> up <span>individual</span> <span>companies</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes <span>indeed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well I <span>think…<br/></span>

🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 My <span>name's</span> <span>Erica</span> <span>Matthews</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I'm the <span>owner</span> of <span>Matthews</span> <span>Island</span> <span>Holidays</span>,<br/>
🎧 a company set up by my <span>parents</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you for <span>coming</span> to this <span>presentation</span>,<br/>
🎧 in which I hope to <span>interest</span> you in what we have to <span>offer</span>.<br/>
🎧 We're a small, <span>family-run</span> company,<br/>
🎧 and we <span>believe</span> in the <span>importance</span> of the personal touch,<br/>
🎧 so we don't <span>aim</span> to <span>compete</span> with other <span>companies</span> on the number of <span>customers</span>.<br/>
🎧 What we do is <span>build</span> on our many <span>years'</span> <span>experience</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 more than almost any other <span>rail</span> <span>holiday</span> company <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 to <span>ensure</span> we <span>provide</span> perfect <span>holidays</span> in a small number of <span>destinations</span>,<br/>
🎧 which we've got to know <span>extremely</span> well.<br/>
🎧 I'll start with our <span>six-day</span> <span>Isle</span> of Man <span>holiday</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is a <span>fascinating</span> <span>island</span> in the <span>Irish</span> Sea,<br/>
🎧 with <span>Wales</span> to the <span>south</span>, <span>England</span> to the <span>east</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>Scotland</span> to the <span>north</span> and <span>Northern</span> <span>Ireland</span> to the <span>west</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>holiday</span> <span>starts</span> in <span>Heysham</span>,<br/>
🎧 where your <span>tour</span> <span>manager</span> will meet you,<br/>
🎧 then you'll travel by <span>ferry</span> to the <span>Isle</span> of Man.<br/>
🎧 Some people <span>prefer</span> to fly from <span>Luton</span> <span>instead</span>,<br/>
🎧 and another <span>popular</span> option is to go by <span>train</span> to <span>Liverpool</span> and take a <span>ferry</span> from there.<br/>
🎧 You have <span>five</span> <span>nights</span> in the <span>hotel</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>price</span> <span>covers</span> <span>five</span> <span>breakfasts</span> and <span>dinners</span>,<br/>
🎧 and lunch on the <span>three</span> <span>days</span> when there are <span>organised</span> <span>trips</span>:<br/>
🎧 day <span>four</span> is free,<br/>
🎧 and most people have lunch in a <span>café</span> or <span>restaurant</span> in <span>Douglas</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>price</span> of the <span>holiday</span> <span>includes</span> the <span>ferry</span> to the <span>Isle</span> of Man,<br/>
🎧 all travel on the <span>island</span>, the <span>hotel</span>, and the <span>meals</span> I've <span>mentioned</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Incidentally</span>, we try to make <span>booking</span> our <span>holidays</span> as simple and <span>fair</span> as <span>possible</span>,<br/>
🎧 so <span>unlike</span> with many <span>companies</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>price</span> is the same <span>whether</span> you book six <span>months</span> in <span>advance<br/></span>
🎧 or at the last <span>minute</span>,<br/>
🎧 and there's no <span>supplement</span> for <span>single</span> <span>rooms</span> in <span>hotels</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you make a <span>booking</span> then need to change the start date,<br/>
🎧 for example because of <span>illness</span>,<br/>
🎧 you're <span>welcome</span> to change to an <span>alternative</span> date or a different <span>tour</span>,<br/>
🎧 for a small <span>administrative</span> <span>fee</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, so what does the <span>holiday</span> <span>consist</span> of?<br/>
🎧 Well, on day <span>one<br/></span>
🎧 you'll <span>arrive</span> in time for a short <span>introduction</span> by your <span>tour</span> <span>manager</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>followed</span> by dinner in the <span>hotel</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>dining</span> room looks out at the <span>river</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>close</span> to where it <span>flows</span> into the <span>harbour</span>,<br/>
🎧 and there's usually <span>plenty</span> of <span>activity</span> going on.<br/>
🎧 On day two you'll take the <span>coach</span> to the small <span>town</span> of <span>Peel</span>,<br/>
🎧 on the way <span>calling</span> in at the <span>Tynwald</span> <span>Exhibition</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Isle</span> of Man isn't <span>part</span> of the <span>United</span> <span>Kingdom</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it has its own <span>parliament</span>, called <span>Tynwald</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>claimed</span> that this is the <span>world's</span> <span>oldest</span> <span>parliament</span> that's still <span>functioning</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that it <span>dates</span> back to <span>979</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, the <span>earliest</span> <span>surviving</span> <span>reference</span> to it is from <span>1422</span>,<br/>
🎧 so <span>perhaps</span> it isn't quite as old as it <span>claims</span>!<br/>
🎧 Day <span>three</span> we have a <span>trip</span> to the <span>mountain</span> <span>Snaefell</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>begins</span> with a <span>leisurely</span> <span>ride</span> along the <span>promenade</span> in <span>Douglas</span> in a <span>horse-drawn</span> <span>tram</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then you <span>board</span> an <span>electric</span> <span>train</span> which takes you to the <span>fishing</span> <span>village</span> of <span>Laxey</span>.<br/>
🎧 From there it's an <span>eight-kilometre</span> <span>ride</span> in the <span>Snaefell</span> <span>Mountain</span> <span>Railway</span> to the top.<br/>
🎧 Lunch will be in the <span>café</span>, <span>giving</span> you <span>spectacular</span> <span>views</span> of the <span>island</span>.<br/>
🎧 Day <span>four</span> is free for you to <span>explore</span>, <span>using</span> the <span>pass</span> which we'll give you.<br/>
🎧 So you won't have to pay for travel on <span>local</span> <span>transport</span>,<br/>
🎧 or for <span>entrance</span> to the <span>island's</span> <span>heritage</span> <span>sites</span>.<br/>
🎧 Or you might just want to take it easy in <span>Douglas</span> and <span>perhaps</span> do a little <span>light</span> <span>shopping</span>.<br/>
🎧 The last full day, day <span>five</span>, is for some people the <span>highlight</span> of the <span>holiday</span>,<br/>
🎧 with a <span>ride</span> on the <span>steam</span> <span>railway</span>, from <span>Douglas</span> to <span>Port</span> <span>Erin</span>.<br/>
🎧 After some time to <span>explore</span>,<br/>
🎧 a <span>coach</span> will take you to the <span>headland</span> that <span>overlooks</span> the <span>Calf</span> of Man,<br/>
🎧 a small <span>island</span> just off the <span>coast</span>.<br/>
🎧 From there you <span>continue</span> to <span>Castletown</span>,<br/>
🎧 which used to be the <span>capital</span> of the <span>Isle</span> of Man, and its <span>mediaeval</span> <span>castle</span>.<br/>
🎧 And on day six it's back to the <span>ferry</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 or the <span>airport</span>, if you <span>flew</span> to the <span>island</span> <span>-</span> and time to go home.<br/>
🎧 Now I'd like to tell <span>you..</span>.<br/>
<br />

🎧 <span>Ed</span>, how are you getting on with the <span>reading</span> for our <span>presentation</span> next week?<br/>
🎧 Well, OK, <span>Ruth</span> <span>-</span> but there's so much of it.<br/>
🎧 I know,<br/>
🎧 I hadn't <span>realised</span> <span>birth</span> order was such a <span>popular</span> <span>area</span> of <span>research</span>.<br/>
🎧 But the <span>stuff</span> on <span>birth</span> order and <span>personality</span> is <span>mostly</span> <span>unreliable</span>.<br/>
🎧 From what I've been <span>reading</span>,<br/>
🎧 a lot of the <span>claims</span> about how your <span>position</span> in the <span>family</span> <span>determines</span> <span>certain</span> <span>personality</span> <span>traits</span> are just <span>stereotypes</span>,<br/>
🎧 with no <span>robust</span> <span>evidence</span> to <span>support</span> them.<br/>
🎧 OK, but that's an <span>interesting</span> <span>point</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 we could start by <span>outlining</span> what <span>previous</span> <span>research</span> has <span>shown</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>studies</span> going back over a <span>hundred</span> years.<br/>
🎧 Yeah <span>-</span> so we could just run through some of the <span>typical</span> <span>traits</span>.<br/>
🎧 Like the <span>consensus</span> <span>seems</span> to be that <span>oldest</span> children are <span>generally</span> less <span>well-adjusted<br/></span>
🎧 because they never get over the <span>arrival</span> of a <span>younger</span> <span>sibling</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, but on a <span>positive</span> <span>note</span>,<br/>
🎧 some <span>studies</span> <span>claimed</span> that they were thought to be good at <span>nurturing</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>certainly</span> in the <span>past</span> when people had large <span>families</span>,<br/>
🎧 they would have been <span>expected</span> to look after the <span>younger</span> <span>ones</span>.<br/>
🎧 There isn't such a <span>clear</span> <span>picture</span> for <span>middle</span> children <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 but one <span>trait</span> that a lot of the <span>studies</span> <span>mention<br/></span>
🎧 is that they are <span>easier</span> to get on with than <span>older</span> or <span>younger</span> <span>siblings</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mm</span>. <span>Generally</span> <span>eager</span> to please and <span>helpful</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 although that's <span>certainly</span> not <span>accurate</span> as <span>far</span> as my <span>family</span> <span>goes</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 my <span>middle</span> <span>brother</span> was a <span>nightmare</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 always <span>causing</span> <span>fights</span> and <span>envious</span> of whatever I had.<br/>
🎧 As I said <span>-</span> <span>none</span> of this <span>seems</span> to <span>relate</span> to my own <span>experience</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm the <span>youngest</span> in my <span>family<br/></span>
🎧 and I don't <span>recognise</span> myself in any of the <span>studies</span> I've read about.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>supposed</span> to have been a <span>sociable</span> and <span>confident</span> <span>child</span> who made friends <span>easily<br/></span>
🎧 but I was actually <span>terribly</span> shy.<br/>
🎧 Really? That's funny.<br/>
🎧 There have been <span>hundreds</span> of <span>studies</span> on <span>twins</span> but <span>mostly</span> about <span>nurture</span> <span>versus</span> <span>nature…<br/></span>
🎧 There was one on <span>personality</span>, which said that a <span>twin</span> is <span>likely</span> to be quite shy in <span>social</span> <span>situations<br/></span>
🎧 because they always have their <span>twin</span> around to <span>depend</span> on for <span>support</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>cousins</span> were like that when they were small <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 they were only interested in each other and <span>found</span> it <span>hard</span> to <span>engage</span> with other <span>kids</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're fine now though.<br/>
🎧 Only children have had a really bad <span>press</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 a lot of <span>studies</span> have <span>branded</span> them as <span>loners</span> who think the <span>world</span> <span>revolves</span> around <span>them<br/></span>
🎧 because <span>they've</span> never had to <span>fight</span> for their <span>parents'</span> <span>attention</span>.<br/>
🎧 That does <span>seem</span> a bit <span>harsh</span>.<br/>
🎧 One <span>category</span> I hadn't <span>considered</span> before was children with much <span>older</span> <span>siblings</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 a <span>couple</span> of <span>studies</span> <span>mentioned</span> that these children <span>grow</span> up more <span>quickly<br/></span>
🎧 and are <span>expected</span> to do <span>basic</span> things for <span>themselves</span> <span>-</span> like getting <span>dressed</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can see how that might be <span>true</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 although I <span>expect</span> they're sometimes the <span>exact</span> <span>opposite</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 playing the <span>baby</span> <span>role</span> and <span>clamouring</span> for special <span>treatment</span>.<br/>
🎧 What was the <span>problem</span> with most of these <span>studies</span>, do you think?<br/>
🎧 I think it was <span>because<br/></span>
🎧 in a lot of <span>cases</span> <span>data</span> was <span>collected</span> from only one <span>sibling</span> <span>per</span> <span>family</span>,<br/>
🎧 who <span>rated</span> him or <span>herself</span> and his or her <span>siblings</span> at the same time.<br/>
🎧 Some of the old <span>research</span> into the <span>relationship</span> between <span>birth</span> order and <span>academic</span> <span>achievement</span> has been <span>proved</span> to be <span>accurate</span> though.<br/>
🎧 <span>Performances</span> in <span>intelligence</span> <span>tests</span> <span>decline</span> <span>slightly</span> from the <span>eldest</span> <span>child</span> to his or her <span>younger</span> <span>siblings</span>.<br/>
🎧 This has been <span>proved</span> in lots of <span>recent</span> <span>studies</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes. Although what many of them didn't take into <span>consideration</span> was <span>family</span> size.<br/>
🎧 The more <span>siblings</span> there are, the <span>likelier</span> the <span>family</span> is to have a low <span>socioeconomic</span> <span>status</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 which can also <span>account</span> for <span>differences</span> between <span>siblings</span> in <span>academic</span> <span>performance</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>oldest</span> boy might be <span>given</span> more <span>opportunities</span> than his <span>younger</span> <span>sisters</span>, for example.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 But the <span>main</span> <span>reason</span> for the <span>marginally</span> <span>higher</span> <span>academic</span> <span>performance</span> of <span>oldest</span> children is quite <span>surprising</span>, I think.<br/>
🎧 It's not only that they <span>benefit</span> <span>intellectually</span> from <span>extra</span> <span>attention</span> at a young age <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 which is what I would have <span>expected</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's that they <span>benefit</span> from being <span>teachers</span> for their <span>younger</span> <span>siblings</span>, by <span>verbalising</span> <span>processes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, and this <span>gives</span> them <span>status</span> and <span>confidence</span>,<br/>
🎧 which again <span>contributes</span>, in a small way, to better <span>performance</span>.<br/>
🎧 So would you say <span>sibling</span> <span>rivalry</span> has been a <span>useful</span> thing for you?<br/>
🎧 I think so, my <span>younger</span> <span>brother</span> was <span>incredibly</span> <span>annoying</span>.<br/>
🎧 And we <span>fought</span> a <span>lot<br/></span>
🎧 but I think this has made me a <span>stronger</span> person.<br/>
🎧 I know how to <span>defend</span> myself.<br/>
🎧 We had some <span>terrible</span> <span>arguments</span> and I would have <span>died</span> rather than <span>apologise</span> to him.<br/>
🎧 But we had to put up with each other and most of the time we <span>coexisted</span> <span>amicably</span> enough.<br/>
🎧 Yes, my <span>situation</span> was <span>pretty</span> <span>similar</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I don't think having two <span>older</span> <span>brothers</span> made me any less <span>selfish</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was never <span>prepared</span> to let my <span>brothers</span> use any of my <span>stuff..</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>perfectly</span> <span>normal..</span>.<br/>

🎧 Today I'm going to talk about the <span>eucalyptus</span> <span>tree</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is a very <span>common</span> <span>tree</span> here in <span>Australia</span>,<br/>
🎧 where it's also sometimes called the gum <span>tree</span>.<br/>
🎧 First I'm going to talk about why it's important,<br/>
🎧 then I'm going to <span>describe</span> some <span>problems</span> it <span>faces</span> at <span>present</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, well the <span>eucalyptus</span> <span>tree</span> is an important <span>tree</span> for lots of <span>reasons</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, it <span>gives</span> <span>shelter</span> to <span>creatures</span> like <span>birds</span> and <span>bats</span>,<br/>
🎧 and these and other <span>species</span> also <span>depend</span> on it for food,<br/>
🎧 <span>particularly</span> the <span>nectar</span> from its <span>flowers</span>.<br/>
🎧 So it <span>supports</span> <span>biodiversity</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>useful</span> to us <span>humans</span> too,<br/>
🎧 because we can <span>kill</span> <span>germs</span> with a <span>disinfectant</span> made from oil <span>extracted</span> from <span>eucalyptus</span> leaves.<br/>
🎧 The <span>eucalyptus</span> <span>grows</span> all over <span>Australia<br/></span>
🎧 and the <span>trees</span> can live for up to <span>400</span> years.<br/>
🎧 So it's <span>alarming</span> that all across the <span>country</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>numbers</span> of <span>eucalyptus</span> are <span>falling</span> because the <span>trees</span> are <span>dying</span> off <span>prematurely</span>.<br/>
🎧 So what are the <span>reasons</span> for this?<br/>
🎧 One <span>possible</span> <span>reason</span> is <span>disease</span>.<br/>
🎧 As <span>far</span> back as the <span>1970s</span> the <span>trees</span> <span>started</span> getting a <span>disease</span> called <span>Mundulla</span> <span>Yellows</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>trees'</span> leaves would <span>gradually</span> <span>turn</span> <span>yellow</span>, then the <span>tree</span> would <span>die</span>.<br/>
🎧 It wasn't until <span>2004</span> that they <span>found</span> the <span>cause</span> of the <span>problem</span> was <span>lime</span>,<br/>
🎧 or <span>calcium</span> <span>hydroxide</span> to give it its <span>proper</span> <span>chemical</span> name,<br/>
🎧 which was being used in the <span>construction</span> of <span>roads</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>lime</span> was being <span>washed</span> away into the <span>ground</span> and <span>affecting</span> the <span>roots</span> of the <span>eucalyptus</span> <span>trees</span> <span>nearby</span>.<br/>
🎧 What it was doing was <span>preventing</span> the <span>trees</span> from <span>sucking</span> up the <span>iron</span> they <span>needed</span> for <span>healthy</span> <span>growth</span>.<br/>
🎧 When this was <span>injected</span> back into the <span>affected</span> <span>trees</span>, they <span>immediately</span> <span>recovered</span>.<br/>
🎧 But this <span>problem</span> only <span>affected</span> a <span>relatively</span> small number of <span>trees</span>.<br/>
🎧 By <span>2000</span>, <span>huge</span> <span>numbers</span> of <span>eucalyptus</span> were <span>dying</span> along <span>Australia's</span> <span>East</span> <span>Coast</span>,<br/>
🎧 of a <span>disease</span> <span>known</span> as <span>Bell-miner</span> <span>Associated</span> <span>Die-back</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>bell-miner</span> is a <span>bird</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>disease</span> <span>seems</span> to be <span>common</span> where there are high <span>populations</span> of <span>bell-miners</span>.<br/>
🎧 Again it's the leaves of the <span>trees</span> that are <span>affected</span>.<br/>
🎧 What <span>happens</span> is that <span>insects</span> <span>settle</span> on the <span>leaves<br/></span>
🎧 and eat their way <span>round</span> them, <span>destroying</span> them as they go,<br/>
🎧 and at the same time they <span>secrete</span> a <span>solution</span> which has <span>sugar</span> in it.<br/>
🎧 The <span>bell-miner</span> <span>birds</span> really like this <span>solution</span>,<br/>
🎧 and in order to get as much as <span>possible</span>,<br/>
🎧 they keep away other <span>creatures</span> that might try to get it.<br/>
🎧 So these <span>birds</span> and <span>insects</span> <span>flourish</span> at the <span>expense</span> of other <span>species</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>eventually</span> so much <span>damage</span> is done to the leaves that the <span>tree</span> <span>dies</span>.<br/>
🎧 But <span>experts</span> say that <span>trees</span> can start looking <span>sick</span> before any <span>sign</span> of <span>Bell-miner</span> <span>Associated</span> <span>Die-back</span>.<br/>
🎧 So it looks as if the <span>problem</span> might have another <span>explanation</span>.<br/>
🎧 One <span>possibility</span> is that it's to do with the <span>huge</span> <span>bushfires</span> that we have in <span>Australia</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>theory</span> <span>proposed</span> over <span>40</span> years ago by <span>ecologist</span> <span>William</span> <span>Jackson<br/></span>
🎧 is that the <span>frequency</span> of <span>bushfires</span> in a <span>particular</span> <span>region</span> <span>affects</span> the <span>type</span> of <span>vegetation</span> that <span>grows</span> there.<br/>
🎧 If there are very <span>frequent</span> <span>bushfires</span> in a <span>region</span>,<br/>
🎧 this <span>encourages</span> <span>grass</span> to <span>grow</span> <span>afterwards</span>,<br/>
🎧 while if the <span>bushfires</span> are rather less <span>frequent</span>,<br/>
🎧 this <span>results</span> in the <span>growth</span> of <span>eucalyptus</span> <span>forests</span>.<br/>
🎧 So why is this?<br/>
🎧 Why do <span>fairly</span> <span>frequent</span> <span>bushfires</span> actually <span>support</span> the <span>growth</span> of <span>eucalyptus</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, one <span>reason</span> is that the <span>fire</span> <span>stops</span> the <span>growth</span> of other <span>species<br/></span>
🎧 which would <span>consume</span> water <span>needed</span> by <span>eucalyptus</span> <span>trees</span>.<br/>
🎧 And there's another <span>reason</span>.<br/>
🎧 If these other <span>quick-growing</span> <span>species</span> of <span>bushes</span> and <span>plants</span> are <span>allowed</span> to <span>proliferate</span>,<br/>
🎧 they <span>harm</span> the <span>eucalyptus</span> in another way,<br/>
🎧 by <span>affecting</span> the <span>composition</span> of the <span>soil</span>, and <span>removing</span> <span>nutrients</span> from it.<br/>
🎧 So some <span>bushfires</span> are actually <span>essential</span> for the <span>eucalyptus</span> to <span>survive<br/></span>
🎧 as long as they are not too <span>frequent</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span> there's <span>evidence</span> that <span>Australia's</span> <span>indigenous</span> people <span>practised</span> <span>regular</span> <span>burning</span> of <span>bush</span> <span>land</span> for <span>thousands</span> of <span>years<br/></span>
🎧 before the <span>arrival</span> of the <span>Europeans</span>.<br/>
🎧 But since <span>Europeans</span> <span>arrived</span> on the <span>continent</span>,<br/>
🎧 the number of <span>bushfires</span> has been <span>strictly</span> <span>controlled</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now <span>scientists</span> <span>believe</span> that this <span>reduced</span> <span>frequency</span> of <span>bushfires</span> to low <span>levels<br/></span>
🎧 has <span>led</span> to what's <span>known</span> as <span>'dry</span> <span>rainforest'</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>seems</span> an <span>odd</span> name as usually we <span>associate</span> <span>tropical</span> <span>rainforest</span> with wet <span>conditions</span>.<br/>
🎧 And what's special about this <span>type</span> of <span>rainforest</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>unlike</span> <span>tropical</span> <span>rainforest</span> which is a <span>rich</span> <span>ecosystem</span>,<br/>
🎧 this <span>type</span> of <span>ecosystem</span> is usually a simple one.<br/>
🎧 It has very <span>thick</span>, <span>dense</span> <span>vegetation</span>,<br/>
🎧 but not much <span>variety</span> of <span>species</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>vegetation</span> <span>provides</span> lots of <span>shade</span>,<br/>
🎧 so one <span>species</span> that does find it <span>ideal</span> is the <span>bell-miner</span> <span>bird</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>builds</span> its <span>nests</span> in the <span>undergrowth</span> there.<br/>
🎧 But again that's not <span>helpful</span> for the <span>eucalyptus</span> <span>tree</span>.<br/>
