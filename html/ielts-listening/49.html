🎧 Hello William.<br/>
🎧 This is Amber -<br/>
🎧 you said to phone if I wanted to get more information about the job agency you mentioned.<br/>
🎧 Is now a good time?<br/>
🎧 Oh, hi Amber. Yes. Fine.<br/>
🎧 So the agency I was talking about is called Bankside -<br/>
🎧 they're based in Docklands -<br/>
🎧 I can tell you the address now - 497 Eastside.<br/>
🎧 OK, thanks.<br/>
🎧 So is there anyone in particular I should speak to there?<br/>
🎧 The agent I always deal with is called Becky Jamieson.<br/>
🎧 Let me write that down -<br/>
🎧 Becky…<br/>
🎧 Jamieson<br/>
🎧 Jamieson<br/>
🎧 Do you have her direct line?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's in my contacts somewhere -<br/>
🎧 right, here we are:<br/>
🎧 07866510333.<br/>
🎧 I wouldn't call her until the afternoon if I were you -<br/>
🎧 she's always really busy in the morning trying to fill last-minute vacancies.<br/>
🎧 She's really helpful and friendly so I'm sure it would be worth getting in touch with her for an informal chat.<br/>
🎧 It's mainly clerical and admin jobs they deal with, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 I know you're hoping to find a full-time job in the media eventually -<br/>
🎧 but Becky mostly recruits temporary staff for the finance sector -<br/>
🎧 which will look good on your CV - and generally pays better too.<br/>
🎧 Yeah - I'm just a bit worried because I don't have much office experience.<br/>
🎧 I wouldn't worry.<br/>
🎧 They'll probably start you as a receptionist, or something like that.<br/>
🎧 So what's important for that kind of job isn't so much having business skills or<br/>
🎧 knowing lots of different computer systems - it's communication that really matters -<br/>
🎧 so you'd be fine there.<br/>
🎧 And you'll pick up office skills really quickly on the job.<br/>
🎧 It's not that complicated.<br/>
🎧 OK good.<br/>
🎧 So how long do people generally need temporary staff for?<br/>
🎧 It would be great if I could get something lasting at least a month.<br/>
🎧 That shouldn't be too difficult.<br/>
🎧 But you're more likely to be offered something for a week at first, which might get extended.<br/>
🎧 It's unusual to be sent somewhere for just a day or two.<br/>
🎧 Right,<br/>
🎧 I've heard the pay isn't too bad -<br/>
🎧 better than working in a shop or a restaurant.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes - definitely.<br/>
🎧 The hourly rate is about £10, 11 if you're lucky.<br/>
🎧 That's pretty good.<br/>
🎧 I was only expecting to get eight or nine pounds an hour.<br/>
🎧 Do you want me to tell you anything about the registration process?<br/>
🎧 Yes, please.<br/>
🎧 I know you have to have an interview.<br/>
🎧 The interview usually takes about an hour<br/>
🎧 and you should arrange that about a week in advance.<br/>
🎧 I suppose I should dress smartly if it's for office work -<br/>
🎧 I can probably borrow a suit from Mum.<br/>
🎧 Good idea.<br/>
🎧 It's better to look too smart than too casual.<br/>
🎧 Will I need to bring copies of my exam certificates or anything like that?<br/>
🎧 No - they don't need to see those, I don't think.<br/>
🎧 What about my passport?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes - they will ask to see that.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 I wouldn't get stressed about the interview though.<br/>
🎧 It's just a chance for them to build relationship with you -<br/>
🎧 so they can try and match you to a job which you'll like.<br/>
🎧 So there are questions about personality that they always ask candidates -<br/>
🎧 fairly basic ones.<br/>
🎧 And they probably won't ask anything too difficult like what your plans are for the future.<br/>
🎧 Hope not.<br/>
🎧 Anyway, there are lots of benefits to using an agency -<br/>
🎧 for example, the interview will be useful because they'll give you feedback on your performance<br/>
🎧 so you can improve next time.<br/>
🎧 And they'll have access to jobs which aren't advertised.<br/>
🎧 Exactly -<br/>
🎧 most temporary jobs aren't advertised.<br/>
🎧 And I expect finding a temporary job this way takes a lot less time -<br/>
🎧 it's much easier than ringing up individual companies.<br/>
🎧 Yes indeed.<br/>
🎧 Well I think…<br/>
<br />

🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 My name's Erica Matthews,<br/>
🎧 and I'm the owner of Matthews Island Holidays,<br/>
🎧 a company set up by my parents.<br/>
🎧 Thank you for coming to this presentation,<br/>
🎧 in which I hope to interest you in what we have to offer.<br/>
🎧 We're a small, family-run company,<br/>
🎧 and we believe in the importance of the personal touch,<br/>
🎧 so we don't aim to compete with other companies on the number of customers.<br/>
🎧 What we do is build on our many years' experience -<br/>
🎧 more than almost any other rail holiday company -<br/>
🎧 to ensure we provide perfect holidays in a small number of destinations,<br/>
🎧 which we've got to know extremely well.<br/>
🎧 I'll start with our six-day Isle of Man holiday.<br/>
🎧 This is a fascinating island in the Irish Sea,<br/>
🎧 with Wales to the south, England to the east,<br/>
🎧 Scotland to the north and Northern Ireland to the west.<br/>
🎧 Our holiday starts in Heysham,<br/>
🎧 where your tour manager will meet you,<br/>
🎧 then you'll travel by ferry to the Isle of Man.<br/>
🎧 Some people prefer to fly from Luton instead,<br/>
🎧 and another popular option is to go by train to Liverpool and take a ferry from there.<br/>
🎧 You have five nights in the hotel,<br/>
🎧 and the price covers five breakfasts and dinners,<br/>
🎧 and lunch on the three days when there are organised trips:<br/>
🎧 day four is free,<br/>
🎧 and most people have lunch in a café or restaurant in Douglas.<br/>
🎧 The price of the holiday includes the ferry to the Isle of Man,<br/>
🎧 all travel on the island, the hotel, and the meals I've mentioned.<br/>
🎧 Incidentally, we try to make booking our holidays as simple and fair as possible,<br/>
🎧 so unlike with many companies,<br/>
🎧 the price is the same whether you book six months in advance<br/>
🎧 or at the last minute,<br/>
🎧 and there's no supplement for single rooms in hotels.<br/>
🎧 If you make a booking then need to change the start date,<br/>
🎧 for example because of illness,<br/>
🎧 you're welcome to change to an alternative date or a different tour,<br/>
🎧 for a small administrative fee.<br/>
🎧 OK, so what does the holiday consist of?<br/>
🎧 Well, on day one<br/>
🎧 you'll arrive in time for a short introduction by your tour manager,<br/>
🎧 followed by dinner in the hotel.<br/>
🎧 The dining room looks out at the river,<br/>
🎧 close to where it flows into the harbour,<br/>
🎧 and there's usually plenty of activity going on.<br/>
🎧 On day two you'll take the coach to the small town of Peel,<br/>
🎧 on the way calling in at the Tynwald Exhibition.<br/>
🎧 The Isle of Man isn't part of the United Kingdom,<br/>
🎧 and it has its own parliament, called Tynwald.<br/>
🎧 It's claimed that this is the world's oldest parliament that's still functioning,<br/>
🎧 and that it dates back to 979.<br/>
🎧 However, the earliest surviving reference to it is from 1422,<br/>
🎧 so perhaps it isn't quite as old as it claims!<br/>
🎧 Day three we have a trip to the mountain Snaefell.<br/>
🎧 This begins with a leisurely ride along the promenade in Douglas in a horse-drawn tram.<br/>
🎧 Then you board an electric train which takes you to the fishing village of Laxey.<br/>
🎧 From there it's an eight-kilometre ride in the Snaefell Mountain Railway to the top.<br/>
🎧 Lunch will be in the café, giving you spectacular views of the island.<br/>
🎧 Day four is free for you to explore, using the pass which we'll give you.<br/>
🎧 So you won't have to pay for travel on local transport,<br/>
🎧 or for entrance to the island's heritage sites.<br/>
🎧 Or you might just want to take it easy in Douglas and perhaps do a little light shopping.<br/>
🎧 The last full day, day five, is for some people the highlight of the holiday,<br/>
🎧 with a ride on the steam railway, from Douglas to Port Erin.<br/>
🎧 After some time to explore,<br/>
🎧 a coach will take you to the headland that overlooks the Calf of Man,<br/>
🎧 a small island just off the coast.<br/>
🎧 From there you continue to Castletown,<br/>
🎧 which used to be the capital of the Isle of Man, and its mediaeval castle.<br/>
🎧 And on day six it's back to the ferry -<br/>
🎧 or the airport, if you flew to the island - and time to go home.<br/>
🎧 Now I'd like to tell you...<br/>
<br />

🎧 Ed, how are you getting on with the reading for our presentation next week?<br/>
🎧 Well, OK, Ruth - but there's so much of it.<br/>
🎧 I know,<br/>
🎧 I hadn't realised birth order was such a popular area of research.<br/>
🎧 But the stuff on birth order and personality is mostly unreliable.<br/>
🎧 From what I've been reading,<br/>
🎧 a lot of the claims about how your position in the family determines certain personality traits are just stereotypes,<br/>
🎧 with no robust evidence to support them.<br/>
🎧 OK, but that's an interesting point -<br/>
🎧 we could start by outlining what previous research has shown.<br/>
🎧 There are studies going back over a hundred years.<br/>
🎧 Yeah - so we could just run through some of the typical traits.<br/>
🎧 Like the consensus seems to be that oldest children are generally less well-adjusted<br/>
🎧 because they never get over the arrival of a younger sibling.<br/>
🎧 Right, but on a positive note,<br/>
🎧 some studies claimed that they were thought to be good at nurturing -<br/>
🎧 certainly in the past when people had large families,<br/>
🎧 they would have been expected to look after the younger ones.<br/>
🎧 There isn't such a clear picture for middle children -<br/>
🎧 but one trait that a lot of the studies mention<br/>
🎧 is that they are easier to get on with than older or younger siblings.<br/>
🎧 Mm. Generally eager to please and helpful -<br/>
🎧 although that's certainly not accurate as far as my family goes -<br/>
🎧 my middle brother was a nightmare -<br/>
🎧 always causing fights and envious of whatever I had.<br/>
🎧 As I said - none of this seems to relate to my own experience.<br/>
🎧 I'm the youngest in my family<br/>
🎧 and I don't recognise myself in any of the studies I've read about.<br/>
🎧 I'm supposed to have been a sociable and confident child who made friends easily<br/>
🎧 but I was actually terribly shy.<br/>
🎧 Really? That's funny.<br/>
🎧 There have been hundreds of studies on twins but mostly about nurture versus nature…<br/>
🎧 There was one on personality, which said that a twin is likely to be quite shy in social situations<br/>
🎧 because they always have their twin around to depend on for support.<br/>
🎧 My cousins were like that when they were small -<br/>
🎧 they were only interested in each other and found it hard to engage with other kids.<br/>
🎧 They're fine now though.<br/>
🎧 Only children have had a really bad press -<br/>
🎧 a lot of studies have branded them as loners who think the world revolves around them<br/>
🎧 because they've never had to fight for their parents' attention.<br/>
🎧 That does seem a bit harsh.<br/>
🎧 One category I hadn't considered before was children with much older siblings -<br/>
🎧 a couple of studies mentioned that these children grow up more quickly<br/>
🎧 and are expected to do basic things for themselves - like getting dressed.<br/>
🎧 I can see how that might be true -<br/>
🎧 although I expect they're sometimes the exact opposite -<br/>
🎧 playing the baby role and clamouring for special treatment.<br/>
🎧 What was the problem with most of these studies, do you think?<br/>
🎧 I think it was because<br/>
🎧 in a lot of cases data was collected from only one sibling per family,<br/>
🎧 who rated him or herself and his or her siblings at the same time.<br/>
🎧 Some of the old research into the relationship between birth order and academic achievement has been proved to be accurate though.<br/>
🎧 Performances in intelligence tests decline slightly from the eldest child to his or her younger siblings.<br/>
🎧 This has been proved in lots of recent studies.<br/>
🎧 Yes. Although what many of them didn't take into consideration was family size.<br/>
🎧 The more siblings there are, the likelier the family is to have a low socioeconomic status -<br/>
🎧 which can also account for differences between siblings in academic performance.<br/>
🎧 The oldest boy might be given more opportunities than his younger sisters, for example.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 But the main reason for the marginally higher academic performance of oldest children is quite surprising, I think.<br/>
🎧 It's not only that they benefit intellectually from extra attention at a young age -<br/>
🎧 which is what I would have expected.<br/>
🎧 It's that they benefit from being teachers for their younger siblings, by verbalising processes.<br/>
🎧 Right, and this gives them status and confidence,<br/>
🎧 which again contributes, in a small way, to better performance.<br/>
🎧 So would you say sibling rivalry has been a useful thing for you?<br/>
🎧 I think so, my younger brother was incredibly annoying.<br/>
🎧 And we fought a lot<br/>
🎧 but I think this has made me a stronger person.<br/>
🎧 I know how to defend myself.<br/>
🎧 We had some terrible arguments and I would have died rather than apologise to him.<br/>
🎧 But we had to put up with each other and most of the time we coexisted amicably enough.<br/>
🎧 Yes, my situation was pretty similar.<br/>
🎧 But I don't think having two older brothers made me any less selfish.<br/>
🎧 I was never prepared to let my brothers use any of my stuff...<br/>
🎧 That's perfectly normal...<br/>
<br />

🎧 Today I'm going to talk about the eucalyptus tree.<br/>
🎧 This is a very common tree here in Australia,<br/>
🎧 where it's also sometimes called the gum tree.<br/>
🎧 First I'm going to talk about why it's important,<br/>
🎧 then I'm going to describe some problems it faces at present.<br/>
🎧 Right, well the eucalyptus tree is an important tree for lots of reasons.<br/>
🎧 For example, it gives shelter to creatures like birds and bats,<br/>
🎧 and these and other species also depend on it for food,<br/>
🎧 particularly the nectar from its flowers.<br/>
🎧 So it supports biodiversity.<br/>
🎧 It's useful to us humans too,<br/>
🎧 because we can kill germs with a disinfectant made from oil extracted from eucalyptus leaves.<br/>
🎧 The eucalyptus grows all over Australia<br/>
🎧 and the trees can live for up to 400 years.<br/>
🎧 So it's alarming that all across the country,<br/>
🎧 numbers of eucalyptus are falling because the trees are dying off prematurely.<br/>
🎧 So what are the reasons for this?<br/>
🎧 One possible reason is disease.<br/>
🎧 As far back as the 1970s the trees started getting a disease called Mundulla Yellows.<br/>
🎧 The trees' leaves would gradually turn yellow, then the tree would die.<br/>
🎧 It wasn't until 2004 that they found the cause of the problem was lime,<br/>
🎧 or calcium hydroxide to give it its proper chemical name,<br/>
🎧 which was being used in the construction of roads.<br/>
🎧 The lime was being washed away into the ground and affecting the roots of the eucalyptus trees nearby.<br/>
🎧 What it was doing was preventing the trees from sucking up the iron they needed for healthy growth.<br/>
🎧 When this was injected back into the affected trees, they immediately recovered.<br/>
🎧 But this problem only affected a relatively small number of trees.<br/>
🎧 By 2000, huge numbers of eucalyptus were dying along Australia's East Coast,<br/>
🎧 of a disease known as Bell-miner Associated Die-back.<br/>
🎧 The bell-miner is a bird,<br/>
🎧 and the disease seems to be common where there are high populations of bell-miners.<br/>
🎧 Again it's the leaves of the trees that are affected.<br/>
🎧 What happens is that insects settle on the leaves<br/>
🎧 and eat their way round them, destroying them as they go,<br/>
🎧 and at the same time they secrete a solution which has sugar in it.<br/>
🎧 The bell-miner birds really like this solution,<br/>
🎧 and in order to get as much as possible,<br/>
🎧 they keep away other creatures that might try to get it.<br/>
🎧 So these birds and insects flourish at the expense of other species,<br/>
🎧 and eventually so much damage is done to the leaves that the tree dies.<br/>
🎧 But experts say that trees can start looking sick before any sign of Bell-miner Associated Die-back.<br/>
🎧 So it looks as if the problem might have another explanation.<br/>
🎧 One possibility is that it's to do with the huge bushfires that we have in Australia.<br/>
🎧 A theory proposed over 40 years ago by ecologist William Jackson<br/>
🎧 is that the frequency of bushfires in a particular region affects the type of vegetation that grows there.<br/>
🎧 If there are very frequent bushfires in a region,<br/>
🎧 this encourages grass to grow afterwards,<br/>
🎧 while if the bushfires are rather less frequent,<br/>
🎧 this results in the growth of eucalyptus forests.<br/>
🎧 So why is this?<br/>
🎧 Why do fairly frequent bushfires actually support the growth of eucalyptus?<br/>
🎧 Well, one reason is that the fire stops the growth of other species<br/>
🎧 which would consume water needed by eucalyptus trees.<br/>
🎧 And there's another reason.<br/>
🎧 If these other quick-growing species of bushes and plants are allowed to proliferate,<br/>
🎧 they harm the eucalyptus in another way,<br/>
🎧 by affecting the composition of the soil, and removing nutrients from it.<br/>
🎧 So some bushfires are actually essential for the eucalyptus to survive<br/>
🎧 as long as they are not too frequent.<br/>
🎧 In fact there's evidence that Australia's indigenous people practised regular burning of bush land for thousands of years<br/>
🎧 before the arrival of the Europeans.<br/>
🎧 But since Europeans arrived on the continent,<br/>
🎧 the number of bushfires has been strictly controlled.<br/>
🎧 Now scientists believe that this reduced frequency of bushfires to low levels<br/>
🎧 has led to what's known as 'dry rainforest',<br/>
🎧 which seems an odd name as usually we associate tropical rainforest with wet conditions.<br/>
🎧 And what's special about this type of rainforest?<br/>
🎧 Well, unlike tropical rainforest which is a rich ecosystem,<br/>
🎧 this type of ecosystem is usually a simple one.<br/>
🎧 It has very thick, dense vegetation,<br/>
🎧 but not much variety of species.<br/>
🎧 The vegetation provides lots of shade,<br/>
🎧 so one species that does find it ideal is the bell-miner bird,<br/>
🎧 which builds its nests in the undergrowth there.<br/>
🎧 But again that's not helpful for the eucalyptus tree.<br/>
<br/><br/>
