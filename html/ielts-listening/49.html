🎧 Hello <span>William.<br/>
🎧 This is <span>Amber <span>-<br/>
🎧 you said to phone if I wanted to get more <span>information about the <span>job <span>agency you <span>mentioned.<br/>
🎧 Is now a good time?<br/>
🎧 Oh, hi <span>Amber. Yes. Fine.<br/>
🎧 So the <span>agency I was talking about is called <span>Bankside <span>-<br/>
🎧 they're <span>based in <span>Docklands <span>-<br/>
🎧 I can tell you the <span>address now <span>- <span>497 <span>Eastside.<br/>
🎧 OK, thanks.<br/>
🎧 So is there <span>anyone in <span>particular I should speak to there?<br/>
🎧 The <span>agent I always <span>deal with is called <span>Becky <span>Jamieson.<br/>
🎧 Let me <span>write that down <span>-<br/>
🎧 <span>Becky…<br/>
🎧 <span>Jamieson<br/>
🎧 <span>Jamieson<br/>
🎧 Do you have her <span>direct <span>line?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's in my <span>contacts somewhere <span>-<br/>
🎧 right, here we are:<br/>
🎧 <span>07866510333.<br/>
🎧 I wouldn't call her until the <span>afternoon if I were you <span>-<br/>
🎧 she's always really <span>busy in the morning trying to <span>fill <span>last-minute <span>vacancies.<br/>
🎧 She's really <span>helpful and <span>friendly so I'm sure it would be <span>worth getting in touch with her for an <span>informal <span>chat.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>mainly <span>clerical and <span>admin <span>jobs they <span>deal with, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 I know you're <span>hoping to find a <span>full-time <span>job in the <span>media <span>eventually <span>-<br/>
🎧 but <span>Becky <span>mostly <span>recruits <span>temporary <span>staff for the <span>finance <span>sector <span>-<br/>
🎧 which will look good on your <span>CV <span>- and <span>generally <span>pays better too.<br/>
🎧 Yeah <span>- I'm just a bit <span>worried because I don't have much <span>office <span>experience.<br/>
🎧 I wouldn't <span>worry.<br/>
🎧 They'll probably start you as a <span>receptionist, or something like that.<br/>
🎧 So what's important for that kind of <span>job isn't so much having <span>business <span>skills <span>or<br/>
🎧 <span>knowing lots of different <span>computer <span>systems <span>- it's <span>communication that really <span>matters <span>-<br/>
🎧 so you'd be fine there.<br/>
🎧 And you'll <span>pick up <span>office <span>skills really quickly on the <span>job.<br/>
🎧 It's not that <span>complicated.<br/>
🎧 OK good.<br/>
🎧 So how long do people <span>generally need <span>temporary <span>staff for?<br/>
🎧 It would be great if I could get something <span>lasting at <span>least a month.<br/>
🎧 That shouldn't be too <span>difficult.<br/>
🎧 But you're more <span>likely to be <span>offered something for a week at first, which might get <span>extended.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>unusual to be <span>sent somewhere for just a day or two.<br/>
🎧 Right,<br/>
🎧 I've heard the pay isn't too bad <span>-<br/>
🎧 better than working in a <span>shop or a <span>restaurant.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes <span>- definitely.<br/>
🎧 The <span>hourly <span>rate is about <span>£10, <span>11 if you're <span>lucky.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>pretty good.<br/>
🎧 I was only <span>expecting to get <span>eight or <span>nine <span>pounds an <span>hour.<br/>
🎧 Do you want me to tell you anything about the <span>registration <span>process?<br/>
🎧 Yes, please.<br/>
🎧 I know you have to have an <span>interview.<br/>
🎧 The <span>interview usually takes about an <span>hour<br/>
🎧 and you should <span>arrange that about a week in <span>advance.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose I should <span>dress <span>smartly if it's for <span>office work <span>-<br/>
🎧 I can probably <span>borrow a <span>suit from <span>Mum.<br/>
🎧 Good idea.<br/>
🎧 It's better to look too <span>smart than too <span>casual.<br/>
🎧 Will I need to <span>bring <span>copies of my <span>exam <span>certificates or anything like that?<br/>
🎧 No <span>- they don't need to see those, I don't think.<br/>
🎧 What about my <span>passport?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes <span>- they will ask to see that.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 I wouldn't get <span>stressed about the <span>interview though.<br/>
🎧 It's just a <span>chance for them to <span>build <span>relationship with you <span>-<br/>
🎧 so they can try and <span>match you to a <span>job which you'll like.<br/>
🎧 So there are <span>questions about <span>personality that they always ask <span>candidates <span>-<br/>
🎧 <span>fairly <span>basic <span>ones.<br/>
🎧 And they probably won't ask anything too <span>difficult like what your <span>plans are for the future.<br/>
🎧 Hope not.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway, there are lots of <span>benefits to <span>using an <span>agency <span>-<br/>
🎧 for example, the <span>interview will be <span>useful because they'll give you <span>feedback on your <span>performance<br/>
🎧 so you can <span>improve next time.<br/>
🎧 And they'll have <span>access to <span>jobs which aren't <span>advertised.<br/>
🎧 Exactly <span>-<br/>
🎧 most <span>temporary <span>jobs aren't <span>advertised.<br/>
🎧 And I <span>expect <span>finding a <span>temporary <span>job this way takes a lot less time <span>-<br/>
🎧 it's much <span>easier than <span>ringing up <span>individual <span>companies.<br/>
🎧 Yes <span>indeed.<br/>
🎧 Well I <span>think…<br/>
<br />

🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 My <span>name's <span>Erica <span>Matthews,<br/>
🎧 and I'm the <span>owner of <span>Matthews <span>Island <span>Holidays,<br/>
🎧 a company set up by my <span>parents.<br/>
🎧 Thank you for <span>coming to this <span>presentation,<br/>
🎧 in which I hope to <span>interest you in what we have to <span>offer.<br/>
🎧 We're a small, <span>family-run company,<br/>
🎧 and we <span>believe in the <span>importance of the personal touch,<br/>
🎧 so we don't <span>aim to <span>compete with other <span>companies on the number of <span>customers.<br/>
🎧 What we do is <span>build on our many <span>years' <span>experience <span>-<br/>
🎧 more than almost any other <span>rail <span>holiday company <span>-<br/>
🎧 to <span>ensure we <span>provide perfect <span>holidays in a small number of <span>destinations,<br/>
🎧 which we've got to know <span>extremely well.<br/>
🎧 I'll start with our <span>six-day <span>Isle of Man <span>holiday.<br/>
🎧 This is a <span>fascinating <span>island in the <span>Irish Sea,<br/>
🎧 with <span>Wales to the <span>south, <span>England to the <span>east,<br/>
🎧 <span>Scotland to the <span>north and <span>Northern <span>Ireland to the <span>west.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>holiday <span>starts in <span>Heysham,<br/>
🎧 where your <span>tour <span>manager will meet you,<br/>
🎧 then you'll travel by <span>ferry to the <span>Isle of Man.<br/>
🎧 Some people <span>prefer to fly from <span>Luton <span>instead,<br/>
🎧 and another <span>popular option is to go by <span>train to <span>Liverpool and take a <span>ferry from there.<br/>
🎧 You have <span>five <span>nights in the <span>hotel,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>price <span>covers <span>five <span>breakfasts and <span>dinners,<br/>
🎧 and lunch on the <span>three <span>days when there are <span>organised <span>trips:<br/>
🎧 day <span>four is free,<br/>
🎧 and most people have lunch in a <span>café or <span>restaurant in <span>Douglas.<br/>
🎧 The <span>price of the <span>holiday <span>includes the <span>ferry to the <span>Isle of Man,<br/>
🎧 all travel on the <span>island, the <span>hotel, and the <span>meals I've <span>mentioned.<br/>
🎧 <span>Incidentally, we try to make <span>booking our <span>holidays as simple and <span>fair as <span>possible,<br/>
🎧 so <span>unlike with many <span>companies,<br/>
🎧 the <span>price is the same <span>whether you book six <span>months in <span>advance<br/>
🎧 or at the last <span>minute,<br/>
🎧 and there's no <span>supplement for <span>single <span>rooms in <span>hotels.<br/>
🎧 If you make a <span>booking then need to change the start date,<br/>
🎧 for example because of <span>illness,<br/>
🎧 you're <span>welcome to change to an <span>alternative date or a different <span>tour,<br/>
🎧 for a small <span>administrative <span>fee.<br/>
🎧 OK, so what does the <span>holiday <span>consist of?<br/>
🎧 Well, on day <span>one<br/>
🎧 you'll <span>arrive in time for a short <span>introduction by your <span>tour <span>manager,<br/>
🎧 <span>followed by dinner in the <span>hotel.<br/>
🎧 The <span>dining room looks out at the <span>river,<br/>
🎧 <span>close to where it <span>flows into the <span>harbour,<br/>
🎧 and there's usually <span>plenty of <span>activity going on.<br/>
🎧 On day two you'll take the <span>coach to the small <span>town of <span>Peel,<br/>
🎧 on the way <span>calling in at the <span>Tynwald <span>Exhibition.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Isle of Man isn't <span>part of the <span>United <span>Kingdom,<br/>
🎧 and it has its own <span>parliament, called <span>Tynwald.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>claimed that this is the <span>world's <span>oldest <span>parliament that's still <span>functioning,<br/>
🎧 and that it <span>dates back to <span>979.<br/>
🎧 <span>However, the <span>earliest <span>surviving <span>reference to it is from <span>1422,<br/>
🎧 so <span>perhaps it isn't quite as old as it <span>claims!<br/>
🎧 Day <span>three we have a <span>trip to the <span>mountain <span>Snaefell.<br/>
🎧 This <span>begins with a <span>leisurely <span>ride along the <span>promenade in <span>Douglas in a <span>horse-drawn <span>tram.<br/>
🎧 Then you <span>board an <span>electric <span>train which takes you to the <span>fishing <span>village of <span>Laxey.<br/>
🎧 From there it's an <span>eight-kilometre <span>ride in the <span>Snaefell <span>Mountain <span>Railway to the top.<br/>
🎧 Lunch will be in the <span>café, <span>giving you <span>spectacular <span>views of the <span>island.<br/>
🎧 Day <span>four is free for you to <span>explore, <span>using the <span>pass which we'll give you.<br/>
🎧 So you won't have to pay for travel on <span>local <span>transport,<br/>
🎧 or for <span>entrance to the <span>island's <span>heritage <span>sites.<br/>
🎧 Or you might just want to take it easy in <span>Douglas and <span>perhaps do a little <span>light <span>shopping.<br/>
🎧 The last full day, day <span>five, is for some people the <span>highlight of the <span>holiday,<br/>
🎧 with a <span>ride on the <span>steam <span>railway, from <span>Douglas to <span>Port <span>Erin.<br/>
🎧 After some time to <span>explore,<br/>
🎧 a <span>coach will take you to the <span>headland that <span>overlooks the <span>Calf of Man,<br/>
🎧 a small <span>island just off the <span>coast.<br/>
🎧 From there you <span>continue to <span>Castletown,<br/>
🎧 which used to be the <span>capital of the <span>Isle of Man, and its <span>mediaeval <span>castle.<br/>
🎧 And on day six it's back to the <span>ferry <span>-<br/>
🎧 or the <span>airport, if you <span>flew to the <span>island <span>- and time to go home.<br/>
🎧 Now I'd like to tell <span>you...<br/>
<br />

🎧 <span>Ed, how are you getting on with the <span>reading for our <span>presentation next week?<br/>
🎧 Well, OK, <span>Ruth <span>- but there's so much of it.<br/>
🎧 I know,<br/>
🎧 I hadn't <span>realised <span>birth order was such a <span>popular <span>area of <span>research.<br/>
🎧 But the <span>stuff on <span>birth order and <span>personality is <span>mostly <span>unreliable.<br/>
🎧 From what I've been <span>reading,<br/>
🎧 a lot of the <span>claims about how your <span>position in the <span>family <span>determines <span>certain <span>personality <span>traits are just <span>stereotypes,<br/>
🎧 with no <span>robust <span>evidence to <span>support them.<br/>
🎧 OK, but that's an <span>interesting <span>point <span>-<br/>
🎧 we could start by <span>outlining what <span>previous <span>research has <span>shown.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>studies going back over a <span>hundred years.<br/>
🎧 Yeah <span>- so we could just run through some of the <span>typical <span>traits.<br/>
🎧 Like the <span>consensus <span>seems to be that <span>oldest children are <span>generally less <span>well-adjusted<br/>
🎧 because they never get over the <span>arrival of a <span>younger <span>sibling.<br/>
🎧 Right, but on a <span>positive <span>note,<br/>
🎧 some <span>studies <span>claimed that they were thought to be good at <span>nurturing <span>-<br/>
🎧 <span>certainly in the <span>past when people had large <span>families,<br/>
🎧 they would have been <span>expected to look after the <span>younger <span>ones.<br/>
🎧 There isn't such a <span>clear <span>picture for <span>middle children <span>-<br/>
🎧 but one <span>trait that a lot of the <span>studies <span>mention<br/>
🎧 is that they are <span>easier to get on with than <span>older or <span>younger <span>siblings.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mm. <span>Generally <span>eager to please and <span>helpful <span>-<br/>
🎧 although that's <span>certainly not <span>accurate as <span>far as my <span>family <span>goes <span>-<br/>
🎧 my <span>middle <span>brother was a <span>nightmare <span>-<br/>
🎧 always <span>causing <span>fights and <span>envious of whatever I had.<br/>
🎧 As I said <span>- <span>none of this <span>seems to <span>relate to my own <span>experience.<br/>
🎧 I'm the <span>youngest in my <span>family<br/>
🎧 and I don't <span>recognise myself in any of the <span>studies I've read about.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>supposed to have been a <span>sociable and <span>confident <span>child who made friends <span>easily<br/>
🎧 but I was actually <span>terribly shy.<br/>
🎧 Really? That's funny.<br/>
🎧 There have been <span>hundreds of <span>studies on <span>twins but <span>mostly about <span>nurture <span>versus <span>nature…<br/>
🎧 There was one on <span>personality, which said that a <span>twin is <span>likely to be quite shy in <span>social <span>situations<br/>
🎧 because they always have their <span>twin around to <span>depend on for <span>support.<br/>
🎧 My <span>cousins were like that when they were small <span>-<br/>
🎧 they were only interested in each other and <span>found it <span>hard to <span>engage with other <span>kids.<br/>
🎧 They're fine now though.<br/>
🎧 Only children have had a really bad <span>press <span>-<br/>
🎧 a lot of <span>studies have <span>branded them as <span>loners who think the <span>world <span>revolves around <span>them<br/>
🎧 because <span>they've never had to <span>fight for their <span>parents' <span>attention.<br/>
🎧 That does <span>seem a bit <span>harsh.<br/>
🎧 One <span>category I hadn't <span>considered before was children with much <span>older <span>siblings <span>-<br/>
🎧 a <span>couple of <span>studies <span>mentioned that these children <span>grow up more <span>quickly<br/>
🎧 and are <span>expected to do <span>basic things for <span>themselves <span>- like getting <span>dressed.<br/>
🎧 I can see how that might be <span>true <span>-<br/>
🎧 although I <span>expect they're sometimes the <span>exact <span>opposite <span>-<br/>
🎧 playing the <span>baby <span>role and <span>clamouring for special <span>treatment.<br/>
🎧 What was the <span>problem with most of these <span>studies, do you think?<br/>
🎧 I think it was <span>because<br/>
🎧 in a lot of <span>cases <span>data was <span>collected from only one <span>sibling <span>per <span>family,<br/>
🎧 who <span>rated him or <span>herself and his or her <span>siblings at the same time.<br/>
🎧 Some of the old <span>research into the <span>relationship between <span>birth order and <span>academic <span>achievement has been <span>proved to be <span>accurate though.<br/>
🎧 <span>Performances in <span>intelligence <span>tests <span>decline <span>slightly from the <span>eldest <span>child to his or her <span>younger <span>siblings.<br/>
🎧 This has been <span>proved in lots of <span>recent <span>studies.<br/>
🎧 Yes. Although what many of them didn't take into <span>consideration was <span>family size.<br/>
🎧 The more <span>siblings there are, the <span>likelier the <span>family is to have a low <span>socioeconomic <span>status <span>-<br/>
🎧 which can also <span>account for <span>differences between <span>siblings in <span>academic <span>performance.<br/>
🎧 The <span>oldest boy might be <span>given more <span>opportunities than his <span>younger <span>sisters, for example.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 But the <span>main <span>reason for the <span>marginally <span>higher <span>academic <span>performance of <span>oldest children is quite <span>surprising, I think.<br/>
🎧 It's not only that they <span>benefit <span>intellectually from <span>extra <span>attention at a young age <span>-<br/>
🎧 which is what I would have <span>expected.<br/>
🎧 It's that they <span>benefit from being <span>teachers for their <span>younger <span>siblings, by <span>verbalising <span>processes.<br/>
🎧 Right, and this <span>gives them <span>status and <span>confidence,<br/>
🎧 which again <span>contributes, in a small way, to better <span>performance.<br/>
🎧 So would you say <span>sibling <span>rivalry has been a <span>useful thing for you?<br/>
🎧 I think so, my <span>younger <span>brother was <span>incredibly <span>annoying.<br/>
🎧 And we <span>fought a <span>lot<br/>
🎧 but I think this has made me a <span>stronger person.<br/>
🎧 I know how to <span>defend myself.<br/>
🎧 We had some <span>terrible <span>arguments and I would have <span>died rather than <span>apologise to him.<br/>
🎧 But we had to put up with each other and most of the time we <span>coexisted <span>amicably enough.<br/>
🎧 Yes, my <span>situation was <span>pretty <span>similar.<br/>
🎧 But I don't think having two <span>older <span>brothers made me any less <span>selfish.<br/>
🎧 I was never <span>prepared to let my <span>brothers use any of my <span>stuff...<br/>
🎧 That's <span>perfectly <span>normal...<br/>
<br />

🎧 Today I'm going to talk about the <span>eucalyptus <span>tree.<br/>
🎧 This is a very <span>common <span>tree here in <span>Australia,<br/>
🎧 where it's also sometimes called the gum <span>tree.<br/>
🎧 First I'm going to talk about why it's important,<br/>
🎧 then I'm going to <span>describe some <span>problems it <span>faces at <span>present.<br/>
🎧 Right, well the <span>eucalyptus <span>tree is an important <span>tree for lots of <span>reasons.<br/>
🎧 For example, it <span>gives <span>shelter to <span>creatures like <span>birds and <span>bats,<br/>
🎧 and these and other <span>species also <span>depend on it for food,<br/>
🎧 <span>particularly the <span>nectar from its <span>flowers.<br/>
🎧 So it <span>supports <span>biodiversity.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>useful to us <span>humans too,<br/>
🎧 because we can <span>kill <span>germs with a <span>disinfectant made from oil <span>extracted from <span>eucalyptus leaves.<br/>
🎧 The <span>eucalyptus <span>grows all over <span>Australia<br/>
🎧 and the <span>trees can live for up to <span>400 years.<br/>
🎧 So it's <span>alarming that all across the <span>country,<br/>
🎧 <span>numbers of <span>eucalyptus are <span>falling because the <span>trees are <span>dying off <span>prematurely.<br/>
🎧 So what are the <span>reasons for this?<br/>
🎧 One <span>possible <span>reason is <span>disease.<br/>
🎧 As <span>far back as the <span>1970s the <span>trees <span>started getting a <span>disease called <span>Mundulla <span>Yellows.<br/>
🎧 The <span>trees' leaves would <span>gradually <span>turn <span>yellow, then the <span>tree would <span>die.<br/>
🎧 It wasn't until <span>2004 that they <span>found the <span>cause of the <span>problem was <span>lime,<br/>
🎧 or <span>calcium <span>hydroxide to give it its <span>proper <span>chemical name,<br/>
🎧 which was being used in the <span>construction of <span>roads.<br/>
🎧 The <span>lime was being <span>washed away into the <span>ground and <span>affecting the <span>roots of the <span>eucalyptus <span>trees <span>nearby.<br/>
🎧 What it was doing was <span>preventing the <span>trees from <span>sucking up the <span>iron they <span>needed for <span>healthy <span>growth.<br/>
🎧 When this was <span>injected back into the <span>affected <span>trees, they <span>immediately <span>recovered.<br/>
🎧 But this <span>problem only <span>affected a <span>relatively small number of <span>trees.<br/>
🎧 By <span>2000, <span>huge <span>numbers of <span>eucalyptus were <span>dying along <span>Australia's <span>East <span>Coast,<br/>
🎧 of a <span>disease <span>known as <span>Bell-miner <span>Associated <span>Die-back.<br/>
🎧 The <span>bell-miner is a <span>bird,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>disease <span>seems to be <span>common where there are high <span>populations of <span>bell-miners.<br/>
🎧 Again it's the leaves of the <span>trees that are <span>affected.<br/>
🎧 What <span>happens is that <span>insects <span>settle on the <span>leaves<br/>
🎧 and eat their way <span>round them, <span>destroying them as they go,<br/>
🎧 and at the same time they <span>secrete a <span>solution which has <span>sugar in it.<br/>
🎧 The <span>bell-miner <span>birds really like this <span>solution,<br/>
🎧 and in order to get as much as <span>possible,<br/>
🎧 they keep away other <span>creatures that might try to get it.<br/>
🎧 So these <span>birds and <span>insects <span>flourish at the <span>expense of other <span>species,<br/>
🎧 and <span>eventually so much <span>damage is done to the leaves that the <span>tree <span>dies.<br/>
🎧 But <span>experts say that <span>trees can start looking <span>sick before any <span>sign of <span>Bell-miner <span>Associated <span>Die-back.<br/>
🎧 So it looks as if the <span>problem might have another <span>explanation.<br/>
🎧 One <span>possibility is that it's to do with the <span>huge <span>bushfires that we have in <span>Australia.<br/>
🎧 A <span>theory <span>proposed over <span>40 years ago by <span>ecologist <span>William <span>Jackson<br/>
🎧 is that the <span>frequency of <span>bushfires in a <span>particular <span>region <span>affects the <span>type of <span>vegetation that <span>grows there.<br/>
🎧 If there are very <span>frequent <span>bushfires in a <span>region,<br/>
🎧 this <span>encourages <span>grass to <span>grow <span>afterwards,<br/>
🎧 while if the <span>bushfires are rather less <span>frequent,<br/>
🎧 this <span>results in the <span>growth of <span>eucalyptus <span>forests.<br/>
🎧 So why is this?<br/>
🎧 Why do <span>fairly <span>frequent <span>bushfires actually <span>support the <span>growth of <span>eucalyptus?<br/>
🎧 Well, one <span>reason is that the <span>fire <span>stops the <span>growth of other <span>species<br/>
🎧 which would <span>consume water <span>needed by <span>eucalyptus <span>trees.<br/>
🎧 And there's another <span>reason.<br/>
🎧 If these other <span>quick-growing <span>species of <span>bushes and <span>plants are <span>allowed to <span>proliferate,<br/>
🎧 they <span>harm the <span>eucalyptus in another way,<br/>
🎧 by <span>affecting the <span>composition of the <span>soil, and <span>removing <span>nutrients from it.<br/>
🎧 So some <span>bushfires are actually <span>essential for the <span>eucalyptus to <span>survive<br/>
🎧 as long as they are not too <span>frequent.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact there's <span>evidence that <span>Australia's <span>indigenous people <span>practised <span>regular <span>burning of <span>bush <span>land for <span>thousands of <span>years<br/>
🎧 before the <span>arrival of the <span>Europeans.<br/>
🎧 But since <span>Europeans <span>arrived on the <span>continent,<br/>
🎧 the number of <span>bushfires has been <span>strictly <span>controlled.<br/>
🎧 Now <span>scientists <span>believe that this <span>reduced <span>frequency of <span>bushfires to low <span>levels<br/>
🎧 has <span>led to what's <span>known as <span>'dry <span>rainforest',<br/>
🎧 which <span>seems an <span>odd name as usually we <span>associate <span>tropical <span>rainforest with wet <span>conditions.<br/>
🎧 And what's special about this <span>type of <span>rainforest?<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>unlike <span>tropical <span>rainforest which is a <span>rich <span>ecosystem,<br/>
🎧 this <span>type of <span>ecosystem is usually a simple one.<br/>
🎧 It has very <span>thick, <span>dense <span>vegetation,<br/>
🎧 but not much <span>variety of <span>species.<br/>
🎧 The <span>vegetation <span>provides lots of <span>shade,<br/>
🎧 so one <span>species that does find it <span>ideal is the <span>bell-miner <span>bird,<br/>
🎧 which <span>builds its <span>nests in the <span>undergrowth there.<br/>
🎧 But again that's not <span>helpful for the <span>eucalyptus <span>tree.<br/>
