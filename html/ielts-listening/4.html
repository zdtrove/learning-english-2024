🎧 <span>John, I've just had some good <span>news.<br/>
🎧 <span>Susan has had her <span>baby.<br/>
🎧 Do you know when she had it?<br/>
🎧 <span>Yesterday.<br/>
🎧 The <span>10th of <span>August.<br/>
🎧 Oh, my <span>father was <span>born on <span>August the <span>10th.<br/>
🎧 Give me the <span>details and I'll make a <span>note for everyone at work.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Well, was it a boy or a girl?<br/>
🎧 It's a boy.<br/>
🎧 And what are they going to call him?<br/>
🎧 <span>Tom.<br/>
🎧 <span>Tom <span>Lightfoot.<br/>
🎧 It sounds quite good, don't you think?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that has quite a good <span>ring to it.<br/>
🎧 You know he's quite a big <span>baby.<br/>
🎧 He <span>weighed <span>4.25 <span>kilos when he was <span>born.<br/>
🎧 That does sound big, <span>4.25 <span>kilos.<br/>
🎧 And he's long too, <span>46 <span>centimetres.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mmmm. <span>Tall <span>parents.<br/>
🎧 He'll <span>grow up to be over <span>2 <span>metres, I'd say.<br/>
🎧 With <span>masses of <span>black <span>hair, <span>curly <span>black <span>hair.<br/>
🎧 You know, we should go and visit them in <span>hospital.<br/>
🎧 What about <span>tomorrow <span>afternoon at around <span>1 pm?<br/>
🎧 Yes, okay.<br/>
🎧 Where should we <span>meet?...<br/>
🎧 Ah, I could come and <span>pick you up at your house, if you like.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that would be wonderful.<br/>
🎧 My car is still off the <span>road.<br/>
🎧 Just <span>refresh my <span>memory....<br/>
🎧 What's the <span>address again?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>15 <span>Chesterfield <span>Road, <span>Paddington.<br/>
🎧 It's next to the <span>library, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Not exactly. It's next to a <span>bank.<br/>
🎧 The <span>State <span>Bank actually.<br/>
🎧 The <span>library is <span>opposite us, on the <span>corner.<br/>
🎧 That's right,<br/>
🎧 and there's a <span>garage on the other <span>street <span>corner. I remember now.<br/>
🎧 So, you'll <span>pick me up at <span>12.45<br/>
🎧 and we'll be there at one <span>easily.<br/>
🎧 Now what should we take?<br/>
🎧 We must take them something.<br/>
🎧 I always think <span>flowers are good to take to <span>someone in <span>hospital, don't you?<br/>
🎧 Well, not really.<br/>
🎧 Everyone always <span>brings <span>flowers and they don't last.<br/>
🎧 I think it's much better to take a pot <span>plant,<br/>
🎧 so she can take it home with her.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but then she has to remember to water it.<br/>
🎧 What about a big box of <span>chocolates?<br/>
🎧 Okay, <span>chocolates sound fine.<br/>
🎧 We should get something for the <span>baby too. What do you think?<br/>
🎧 Yes, you're right.<br/>
🎧 What do you think of something like <span>baby <span>shampoo or <span>talcum <span>powder?<br/>
🎧 Or we could get a little hat, or something like that.<br/>
🎧 We don't know the size, or the right <span>colour, do we?<br/>
🎧 I think we should get something they wouldn't <span>normally buy.<br/>
🎧 What about a <span>soft toy of some <span>sort?<br/>
🎧 Yes, a <span>soft toy.<br/>
🎧 What about a <span>teddy <span>bear?<br/>
🎧 I could get one <span>early <span>tomorrow at the <span>market<br/>
🎧 and I could probably get the <span>chocolates there too.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 So you'll <span>pick me up at a <span>quarter to one at my <span>place<br/>
🎧 and I'll make sure that I've got the <span>presents.<br/>
🎧 You must remember how much you <span>paid for the <span>gifts,<br/>
🎧 so I can pay you back for <span>half.<br/>
🎧 If they're going to be from both of us, I would like to go <span>shares.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 I'd say the <span>chocolates would be about <span>$15 for something nice and not too <span>small<br/>
🎧 and the toy would be around <span>$35 or so, I'd think.<br/>
🎧 Good, <span>that'll be fine. About <span>$25 each then.<br/>
🎧 Good, I'll <span>pick you up then on <span>Sunday at <span>12.45.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 See you then. Bye.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Good <span>evening.<br/>
🎧 <span>Tonight's show comes to you from the Good Home <span>Exhibition in <span>Duke's <span>Court,<br/>
🎧 where we've been trying out some of the <span>latest <span>gadgets on show <span>here<br/>
🎧 and getting our <span>resident <span>expert <span>- <span>Liz <span>Shearer <span>-<br/>
🎧 to tell us which <span>ones are <span>worth <span>buying and which will <span>die a <span>death.<br/>
🎧 Well, hello.<br/>
🎧 Yes, <span>John, I've been <span>investigating <span>four new <span>household <span>gadgets<br/>
🎧 and <span>sorting out the <span>advantages and <span>disadvantages<br/>
🎧 and then really <span>deciding what are <span>'Must <span>buys',<br/>
🎧 what are <span>'Maybe <span>buys' and what are <span>'Never <span>buys'.<br/>
🎧 Let's start with this <span>vacuum <span>flask for <span>keeping <span>drinks hot.<br/>
🎧 I <span>felt this had quite a lot going for it,<br/>
🎧 most of all is the <span>fact that it <span>contains no <span>glass<br/>
🎧 and is <span>therefore <span>unbreakable to all <span>intents and <span>purposes.<br/>
🎧 It's made of <span>stainless <span>steel which is <span>guaranteed for <span>20 <span>years...<br/>
🎧 hope that's long <span>enough...<br/>
🎧 and it's <span>true what the <span>manufacturer <span>claims<br/>
🎧 that it does <span>maintain <span>heat for <span>18 hours.<br/>
🎧 So that's <span>pretty good.<br/>
🎧 On the down side, it really <span>works out to be quite <span>expensive<br/>
🎧 and, much more <span>surprisingly,<br/>
🎧 it <span>unfortunately leaves a <span>strange <span>taste...<br/>
🎧 you know, when you've <span>drunk from <span>it...<br/>
🎧 so all in all, my <span>recommendation would be it's got <span>plenty of <span>advantages,<br/>
🎧 but it is rather <span>expensive so I'd say you should maybe buy it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Moving on to a <span>natty little <span>device...<br/>
🎧 the <span>Whistle Key <span>Holder.<br/>
🎧 <span>Basically this is where you <span>whistle<br/>
🎧 and the key <span>holder <span>gives off a high <span>pitched <span>noise and <span>flashes <span>light<br/>
🎧 so you can find it.<br/>
🎧 One <span>advantage of this <span>model is that it also has a small <span>light.<br/>
🎧 You <span>press the <span>button and this <span>means you can find <span>keyholes <span>easily.<br/>
🎧 I also <span>felt the small size was a <span>real <span>advantage.<br/>
🎧 On the <span>weaker side, I did find the <span>noise <span>unpleasant.<br/>
🎧 Which I'm sure the <span>designers could have done something about.<br/>
🎧 And I <span>found that it didn't work through <span>metal, <span>so...<br/>
🎧 it's <span>mainly used for <span>finding in <span>coat <span>pockets, <span>cushions, <span>etc.<br/>
🎧 But taken as a whole I thought it was a <span>masterpiece of <span>design<br/>
🎧 and would <span>highly <span>recommend it.<br/>
🎧 The <span>third <span>gizmo is called the <span>Army <span>Flashlight<br/>
🎧 because it was <span>developed <span>initially for <span>military use.<br/>
🎧 It <span>works by <span>squeezing the <span>handle to <span>generate the <span>power.<br/>
🎧 Its <span>advantages are that it can be used for outside <span>activities,<br/>
🎧 and <span>also... and, this is one of the <span>surprising <span>features...<br/>
🎧 it does work <span>underwater.<br/>
🎧 My <span>main <span>objection to it though was, although it did work in these <span>conditions,<br/>
🎧 this <span>model gave off a <span>weak <span>light.<br/>
🎧 So my <span>recommendation I'm <span>afraid would have to be to <span>avoid this one.<br/>
🎧 The <span>decoy <span>camera was last on my <span>list.<br/>
🎧 This is a <span>fake <span>video <span>camera which you fix to your <span>wall to <span>scare off <span>burglars.<br/>
🎧 The <span>advantage of this <span>model is something which makes it look very <span>realistic...<br/>
🎧 its <span>flashing <span>light.<br/>
🎧 On the down side, it was quite <span>difficult to fix to the <span>wall.<br/>
🎧 <span>However, <span>burglary is such a <span>major <span>problem these <span>days that it is <span>worth the <span>effort, <span>so...<br/>
🎧 this <span>gets my <span>strong <span>recommendation.<br/>
🎧 Okay. Thanks for that, <span>Liz.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Well, <span>Amina, thanks for <span>letting me have your <span>draft in such good time.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's alright.<br/>
🎧 I was just very <span>anxious to hear what you think of it.<br/>
🎧 You can see that I <span>decided to change the <span>topic.<br/>
🎧 I had been interested in looking at <span>Barings <span>Factory.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I think the <span>hospital was a much better <span>choice.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact... <span>well... I have to say that I thought it was good.<br/>
🎧 Oh?<br/>
🎧 There's still lots of work to be <span>done...<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>yes... of course.<br/>
🎧 But there's <span>plenty of good <span>ideas.<br/>
🎧 It <span>opens well and the first <span>chapter is <span>fine<br/>
🎧 but the <span>middle <span>section really <span>stood out for <span>me... most <span>interesting.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>amazing<br/>
🎧 because I really didn't find it a bit easy to <span>write...<br/>
🎧 How long did you work on the whole thing?<br/>
🎧 Well, I <span>spent about two or <span>three <span>weeks <span>reading and doing <span>general <span>research<br/>
🎧 and then I <span>dashed the <span>writing off very <span>quickly...<br/>
🎧 so about <span>four <span>weeks in all.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's about <span>par for the course.<br/>
🎧 You've got a while yet to make the changes.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>right... no <span>problem...<br/>
🎧 Right. Let's have a look at my <span>notes here.<br/>
🎧 Okay. <span>Starting with <span>section <span>headings...<br/>
🎧 the <span>broad <span>divisions are good but you'll have to <span>re-do the <span>actual <span>headings.<br/>
🎧 I've made some <span>suggestions in the <span>margins...<br/>
🎧 Okay. Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Now, this <span>information on <span>local <span>housing...<br/>
🎧 I can see why you put it <span>there<br/>
🎧 but it really isn't <span>relevant to the <span>approach you've taken.<br/>
🎧 I think I see what you mean.<br/>
🎧 <span>Now... what did I say about the <span>interviews?<br/>
🎧 I <span>worked very <span>hard on those.<br/>
🎧 I really thought they were <span>valuable.<br/>
🎧 They are, <span>Amina, but they're very <span>complex and rather <span>unclear at the <span>moment.<br/>
🎧 You're going to have to <span>spend a bit of time <span>making the <span>data a lot <span>clearer.<br/>
🎧 <span>Okay...<br/>
🎧 as long as I don't have to <span>remove them <span>altogether...<br/>
🎧 No, don't <span>worry.<br/>
🎧 What about the <span>chronology...<br/>
🎧 the <span>list of <span>dates?<br/>
🎧 I wasn't sure <span>whether I should <span>rewrite those.<br/>
🎧 My advice on that is to take them out. I feel it makes the whole <span>piece <span>appear too <span>simplistic.<br/>
🎧 Okay, if it'll help.<br/>
🎧 Now, there are a <span>couple of other books I'd like you to look at.<br/>
🎧 Have you got a pen?<br/>
🎧 <span>Right... <span>Approaches to <span>Local <span>History by <span>John <span>Mervis...<br/>
🎧 <span>Right...<br/>
🎧 And then I think you need to think about <span>ways of <span>representing <span>interview <span>data.<br/>
🎧 Have a look at <span>Sight and Sound by <span>Kate <span>Oakwell.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sight and Sound.<br/>
🎧 Then you know I'm going away on <span>holiday next <span>week...<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 So when you've made the changes, I <span>suggest you show the work to your <span>Support <span>Tutor.<br/>
🎧 <span>Support <span>Tutor... <span>right...<br/>
🎧 Then you do the <span>proof <span>reading...<br/>
🎧 <span>Proof <span>reading...<br/>
🎧 When by, do you think?<br/>
🎧 I'd <span>aim for the <span>29th of <span>June<br/>
🎧 and after that you should get it <span>laser <span>printed...<br/>
🎧 but be <span>careful because the <span>computer <span>centre <span>closes on <span>10 <span>July.<br/>
🎧 And then I <span>hand it in <span>to...?<br/>
🎧 Oh, the <span>Faculty <span>Office as <span>usual.<br/>
🎧 Okay, that's fine.<br/>
🎧 I think I'm all set now!<br/>
🎧 Thanks very much for all your help.<br/>
🎧 A <span>pleasure.<br/>
🎧 See you when I get back.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yep. Thanks, <span>Dr <span>Bryson.<br/>
🎧 Bye.<br/>
🎧 Bye.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Good <span>afternoon.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>Paula <span>Bundell<br/>
🎧 and I am <span>giving you the <span>lectures on <span>Environmental <span>Noise this <span>term.<br/>
🎧 Today we are going to look into the <span>effects of <span>noise on a <span>planned <span>housing <span>estate<br/>
🎧 in a <span>particularly <span>difficult <span>part of the new <span>Manchester <span>Park <span>area.<br/>
🎧 This <span>site is not as bad as some I have <span>researched in the <span>past.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Blacktown <span>airport is <span>closed from <span>6 pm to <span>7 <span>am<br/>
🎧 and this is a great <span>advantage to the <span>site.<br/>
🎧 The only <span>noise after <span>dark is from the <span>highway<br/>
🎧 and the <span>traffic is <span>somewhat <span>reduced between <span>7.30 pm and <span>5.30 am.<br/>
🎧 So, the people most <span>affected by the <span>noise will be, I <span>expect, <span>housewives.<br/>
🎧 By the time most of the students and <span>workers have <span>arrived back home in the <span>evening during the week,<br/>
🎧 the <span>noise will have <span>abated to a <span>fairly large <span>extent.<br/>
🎧 The <span>weekends are still a <span>problem of course,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>traffic is <span>certainly <span>reduced on <span>Saturdays to a large <span>extent<br/>
🎧 and even more so on <span>Sundays.<br/>
🎧 Of course, <span>modifications to <span>houses will be <span>necessary at a <span>site like <span>this<br/>
🎧 and they come at a <span>significant <span>cost to the <span>developer and home <span>buyer.<br/>
🎧 The <span>modifications I am about to <span>outline<br/>
🎧 will add about <span>$25,000 to the <span>price of a <span>newly-built house.<br/>
🎧 That will still mean a <span>cheaper house than in a less <span>noisy and more <span>desirable <span>area.<br/>
🎧 A bit of <span>background would not go <span>astray.<br/>
🎧 I <span>understand that you are all <span>familiar with the <span>proposed <span>development <span>site at <span>Manchester <span>Park.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>particularly <span>difficult one in <span>terms of <span>noise<br/>
🎧 with the <span>highway along the <span>eastern <span>perimeter<br/>
🎧 and the <span>Blacktown <span>airport not <span>3 <span>kilometres away to the <span>north.<br/>
🎧 Of course, those <span>nearest the <span>highway will be the <span>worst hit,<br/>
🎧 with <span>heavy <span>traffic <span>noise as well as the <span>noise from the <span>light <span>planes <span>overhead.<br/>
🎧 As you all know, the <span>normal <span>noise <span>threshold for <span>private <span>housing is <span>55 <span>decibels.<br/>
🎧 At this <span>site the <span>levels have been <span>recorded as high as <span>67 <span>decibels.<br/>
🎧 The <span>construction of the <span>houses has to be <span>somewhat <span>modified from <span>houses in most <span>areas.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>houses on the <span>highway and in the <span>noisiest <span>areas of this <span>site<br/>
🎧 there will be a need for <span>specialised <span>double <span>glazing<br/>
🎧 and special <span>acoustic <span>seals will have to be <span>fitted to the <span>doors.<br/>
🎧 All <span>exterior <span>doors in this <span>especially <span>noisy <span>pocket<br/>
🎧 will have to be <span>solid <span>core <span>wood <span>doors with <span>hinges.<br/>
🎧 Every house <span>built on this <span>site,<br/>
🎧 not just those <span>adjacent to the <span>highway or <span>nearest to the <span>airport,<br/>
🎧 will <span>require high <span>density <span>insulation <span>materials in the <span>roof.<br/>
🎧 Not only will all the <span>roofs need <span>insulating,<br/>
🎧 the <span>exterior <span>walls will be <span>required to be <span>double <span>brick.<br/>
🎧 All <span>ceilings will <span>require <span>double <span>thickness <span>plaster <span>board to be used in the <span>construction.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>noisiest <span>areas, <span>mechanical <span>ventilation will have to be <span>installed in the <span>exterior <span>walls.<br/>
🎧 In those <span>areas with <span>sealed <span>windows<br/>
🎧 it will be <span>necessary to fit <span>fans with <span>absorbers to cut out the <span>noise in those <span>particular <span>houses.<br/>
🎧 Air <span>conditioning <span>units could also be <span>fitted in the <span>ceilings of such <span>houses<br/>
🎧 but this is <span>substantially more <span>expensive than <span>fans,<br/>
🎧 and may not be <span>needed on this <span>site.<br/>
🎧 <span>Coming back now to the <span>double <span>glazing I <span>mentioned before.<br/>
🎧 <span>Specialised <span>double <span>glazing <span>requires a <span>larger air <span>gap<br/>
🎧 between the <span>inner and <span>outer <span>glass than <span>normal <span>double <span>glazing.<br/>
🎧 The <span>gap must be at <span>least <span>7 <span>centimetres.<br/>
🎧 The <span>thickness of the <span>glass is also a <span>factor,<br/>
🎧 <span>8 <span>millimetres on the outside and <span>6 on the inside <span>pane.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>essential that the <span>glass be <span>thicker on the outside than on the <span>inside<br/>
🎧 and that the <span>gap between the <span>panes of <span>glass be a <span>minimum of <span>7 <span>centimetres.<br/>
🎧 <span>Obviously, the <span>noise <span>factor will have to be taken into <span>consideration with the <span>layout of the <span>houses.<br/>
🎧 Living <span>areas will have to be <span>designed at the back of the <span>houses away from the <span>highway.<br/>
🎧 <span>Bedrooms and living <span>rooms will have to be <span>built <span>towards the back,<br/>
🎧 and for those <span>houses <span>closest to the <span>highway<br/>
🎧 two <span>layers of <span>plasterboard will be <span>needed for the <span>interior <span>bedroom <span>walls.<br/>
🎧 Those <span>rooms <span>constructed at the <span>front of the <span>houses<br/>
🎧 should be <span>garages, <span>laundries, <span>kitchens, <span>bathrooms and <span>dining <span>rooms.<br/>
🎧 I have come to the <span>conclusion that this <span>development should go ahead,<br/>
🎧 but with <span>various <span>acoustic <span>modifications <span>according to the <span>position of the <span>block<br/>
🎧 in <span>relation to the <span>highway and <span>intersection.<br/>
<br/><br/>
