🎧 <span>John</span>, I've just had some good <span>news</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Susan</span> has had her <span>baby</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you know when she had it?<br/>
🎧 <span>Yesterday</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>10th</span> of <span>August</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, my <span>father</span> was <span>born</span> on <span>August</span> the <span>10th</span>.<br/>
🎧 Give me the <span>details</span> and I'll make a <span>note</span> for everyone at work.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Well, was it a boy or a girl?<br/>
🎧 It's a boy.<br/>
🎧 And what are they going to call him?<br/>
🎧 <span>Tom</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Tom</span> <span>Lightfoot</span>.<br/>
🎧 It sounds quite good, don't you think?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that has quite a good <span>ring</span> to it.<br/>
🎧 You know he's quite a big <span>baby</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>weighed</span> <span>4.25</span> <span>kilos</span> when he was <span>born</span>.<br/>
🎧 That does sound big, <span>4.25</span> <span>kilos</span>.<br/>
🎧 And he's long too, <span>46</span> <span>centimetres</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mmmm</span>. <span>Tall</span> <span>parents</span>.<br/>
🎧 He'll <span>grow</span> up to be over <span>2</span> <span>metres</span>, I'd say.<br/>
🎧 With <span>masses</span> of <span>black</span> <span>hair</span>, <span>curly</span> <span>black</span> <span>hair</span>.<br/>
🎧 You know, we should go and visit them in <span>hospital</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about <span>tomorrow</span> <span>afternoon</span> at around <span>1</span> pm?<br/>
🎧 Yes, okay.<br/>
🎧 Where should we <span>meet?..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ah, I could come and <span>pick</span> you up at your house, if you like.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that would be wonderful.<br/>
🎧 My car is still off the <span>road</span>.<br/>
🎧 Just <span>refresh</span> my <span>memory...</span>.<br/>
🎧 What's the <span>address</span> again?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>15</span> <span>Chesterfield</span> <span>Road</span>, <span>Paddington</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's next to the <span>library</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Not exactly. It's next to a <span>bank</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>State</span> <span>Bank</span> actually.<br/>
🎧 The <span>library</span> is <span>opposite</span> us, on the <span>corner</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's right,<br/>
🎧 and there's a <span>garage</span> on the other <span>street</span> <span>corner</span>. I remember now.<br/>
🎧 So, you'll <span>pick</span> me up at <span>12.45<br/></span>
🎧 and we'll be there at one <span>easily</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now what should we take?<br/>
🎧 We must take them something.<br/>
🎧 I always think <span>flowers</span> are good to take to <span>someone</span> in <span>hospital</span>, don't you?<br/>
🎧 Well, not really.<br/>
🎧 Everyone always <span>brings</span> <span>flowers</span> and they don't last.<br/>
🎧 I think it's much better to take a pot <span>plant</span>,<br/>
🎧 so she can take it home with her.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but then she has to remember to water it.<br/>
🎧 What about a big box of <span>chocolates</span>?<br/>
🎧 Okay, <span>chocolates</span> sound fine.<br/>
🎧 We should get something for the <span>baby</span> too. What do you think?<br/>
🎧 Yes, you're right.<br/>
🎧 What do you think of something like <span>baby</span> <span>shampoo</span> or <span>talcum</span> <span>powder</span>?<br/>
🎧 Or we could get a little hat, or something like that.<br/>
🎧 We don't know the size, or the right <span>colour</span>, do we?<br/>
🎧 I think we should get something they wouldn't <span>normally</span> buy.<br/>
🎧 What about a <span>soft</span> toy of some <span>sort</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, a <span>soft</span> toy.<br/>
🎧 What about a <span>teddy</span> <span>bear</span>?<br/>
🎧 I could get one <span>early</span> <span>tomorrow</span> at the <span>market<br/></span>
🎧 and I could probably get the <span>chocolates</span> there too.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 So you'll <span>pick</span> me up at a <span>quarter</span> to one at my <span>place<br/></span>
🎧 and I'll make sure that I've got the <span>presents</span>.<br/>
🎧 You must remember how much you <span>paid</span> for the <span>gifts</span>,<br/>
🎧 so I can pay you back for <span>half</span>.<br/>
🎧 If they're going to be from both of us, I would like to go <span>shares</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 I'd say the <span>chocolates</span> would be about <span>$15</span> for something nice and not too <span>small<br/></span>
🎧 and the toy would be around <span>$35</span> or so, I'd think.<br/>
🎧 Good, <span>that'll</span> be fine. About <span>$25</span> each then.<br/>
🎧 Good, I'll <span>pick</span> you up then on <span>Sunday</span> at <span>12.45</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 See you then. Bye.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Good <span>evening</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Tonight's</span> show comes to you from the Good Home <span>Exhibition</span> in <span>Duke's</span> <span>Court</span>,<br/>
🎧 where we've been trying out some of the <span>latest</span> <span>gadgets</span> on show <span>here<br/></span>
🎧 and getting our <span>resident</span> <span>expert</span> <span>-</span> <span>Liz</span> <span>Shearer</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 to tell us which <span>ones</span> are <span>worth</span> <span>buying</span> and which will <span>die</span> a <span>death</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, hello.<br/>
🎧 Yes, <span>John</span>, I've been <span>investigating</span> <span>four</span> new <span>household</span> <span>gadgets<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>sorting</span> out the <span>advantages</span> and <span>disadvantages<br/></span>
🎧 and then really <span>deciding</span> what are <span>'Must</span> <span>buys'</span>,<br/>
🎧 what are <span>'Maybe</span> <span>buys'</span> and what are <span>'Never</span> <span>buys'</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's start with this <span>vacuum</span> <span>flask</span> for <span>keeping</span> <span>drinks</span> hot.<br/>
🎧 I <span>felt</span> this had quite a lot going for it,<br/>
🎧 most of all is the <span>fact</span> that it <span>contains</span> no <span>glass<br/></span>
🎧 and is <span>therefore</span> <span>unbreakable</span> to all <span>intents</span> and <span>purposes</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's made of <span>stainless</span> <span>steel</span> which is <span>guaranteed</span> for <span>20</span> <span>years..</span>.<br/>
🎧 hope that's long <span>enough..</span>.<br/>
🎧 and it's <span>true</span> what the <span>manufacturer</span> <span>claims<br/></span>
🎧 that it does <span>maintain</span> <span>heat</span> for <span>18</span> hours.<br/>
🎧 So that's <span>pretty</span> good.<br/>
🎧 On the down side, it really <span>works</span> out to be quite <span>expensive<br/></span>
🎧 and, much more <span>surprisingly</span>,<br/>
🎧 it <span>unfortunately</span> leaves a <span>strange</span> <span>taste..</span>.<br/>
🎧 you know, when you've <span>drunk</span> from <span>it..</span>.<br/>
🎧 so all in all, my <span>recommendation</span> would be it's got <span>plenty</span> of <span>advantages</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it is rather <span>expensive</span> so I'd say you should maybe buy it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Moving</span> on to a <span>natty</span> little <span>device..</span>.<br/>
🎧 the <span>Whistle</span> Key <span>Holder</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Basically</span> this is where you <span>whistle<br/></span>
🎧 and the key <span>holder</span> <span>gives</span> off a high <span>pitched</span> <span>noise</span> and <span>flashes</span> <span>light<br/></span>
🎧 so you can find it.<br/>
🎧 One <span>advantage</span> of this <span>model</span> is that it also has a small <span>light</span>.<br/>
🎧 You <span>press</span> the <span>button</span> and this <span>means</span> you can find <span>keyholes</span> <span>easily</span>.<br/>
🎧 I also <span>felt</span> the small size was a <span>real</span> <span>advantage</span>.<br/>
🎧 On the <span>weaker</span> side, I did find the <span>noise</span> <span>unpleasant</span>.<br/>
🎧 Which I'm sure the <span>designers</span> could have done something about.<br/>
🎧 And I <span>found</span> that it didn't work through <span>metal</span>, <span>so..</span>.<br/>
🎧 it's <span>mainly</span> used for <span>finding</span> in <span>coat</span> <span>pockets</span>, <span>cushions</span>, <span>etc</span>.<br/>
🎧 But taken as a whole I thought it was a <span>masterpiece</span> of <span>design<br/></span>
🎧 and would <span>highly</span> <span>recommend</span> it.<br/>
🎧 The <span>third</span> <span>gizmo</span> is called the <span>Army</span> <span>Flashlight<br/></span>
🎧 because it was <span>developed</span> <span>initially</span> for <span>military</span> use.<br/>
🎧 It <span>works</span> by <span>squeezing</span> the <span>handle</span> to <span>generate</span> the <span>power</span>.<br/>
🎧 Its <span>advantages</span> are that it can be used for outside <span>activities</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>also..</span>. and, this is one of the <span>surprising</span> <span>features..</span>.<br/>
🎧 it does work <span>underwater</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>main</span> <span>objection</span> to it though was, although it did work in these <span>conditions</span>,<br/>
🎧 this <span>model</span> gave off a <span>weak</span> <span>light</span>.<br/>
🎧 So my <span>recommendation</span> I'm <span>afraid</span> would have to be to <span>avoid</span> this one.<br/>
🎧 The <span>decoy</span> <span>camera</span> was last on my <span>list</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is a <span>fake</span> <span>video</span> <span>camera</span> which you fix to your <span>wall</span> to <span>scare</span> off <span>burglars</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>advantage</span> of this <span>model</span> is something which makes it look very <span>realistic..</span>.<br/>
🎧 its <span>flashing</span> <span>light</span>.<br/>
🎧 On the down side, it was quite <span>difficult</span> to fix to the <span>wall</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, <span>burglary</span> is such a <span>major</span> <span>problem</span> these <span>days</span> that it is <span>worth</span> the <span>effort</span>, <span>so..</span>.<br/>
🎧 this <span>gets</span> my <span>strong</span> <span>recommendation</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay. Thanks for that, <span>Liz</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Well, <span>Amina</span>, thanks for <span>letting</span> me have your <span>draft</span> in such good time.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's alright.<br/>
🎧 I was just very <span>anxious</span> to hear what you think of it.<br/>
🎧 You can see that I <span>decided</span> to change the <span>topic</span>.<br/>
🎧 I had been interested in looking at <span>Barings</span> <span>Factory</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I think the <span>hospital</span> was a much better <span>choice</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact..</span>. <span>well..</span>. I have to say that I thought it was good.<br/>
🎧 Oh?<br/>
🎧 There's still lots of work to be <span>done..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>yes..</span>. of course.<br/>
🎧 But there's <span>plenty</span> of good <span>ideas</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>opens</span> well and the first <span>chapter</span> is <span>fine<br/></span>
🎧 but the <span>middle</span> <span>section</span> really <span>stood</span> out for <span>me..</span>. most <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>amazing<br/></span>
🎧 because I really didn't find it a bit easy to <span>write..</span>.<br/>
🎧 How long did you work on the whole thing?<br/>
🎧 Well, I <span>spent</span> about two or <span>three</span> <span>weeks</span> <span>reading</span> and doing <span>general</span> <span>research<br/></span>
🎧 and then I <span>dashed</span> the <span>writing</span> off very <span>quickly..</span>.<br/>
🎧 so about <span>four</span> <span>weeks</span> in all.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's about <span>par</span> for the course.<br/>
🎧 You've got a while yet to make the changes.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>right..</span>. no <span>problem..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right. Let's have a look at my <span>notes</span> here.<br/>
🎧 Okay. <span>Starting</span> with <span>section</span> <span>headings..</span>.<br/>
🎧 the <span>broad</span> <span>divisions</span> are good but you'll have to <span>re-do</span> the <span>actual</span> <span>headings</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've made some <span>suggestions</span> in the <span>margins..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay. Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Now, this <span>information</span> on <span>local</span> <span>housing..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can see why you put it <span>there<br/></span>
🎧 but it really isn't <span>relevant</span> to the <span>approach</span> you've taken.<br/>
🎧 I think I see what you mean.<br/>
🎧 <span>Now..</span>. what did I say about the <span>interviews</span>?<br/>
🎧 I <span>worked</span> very <span>hard</span> on those.<br/>
🎧 I really thought they were <span>valuable</span>.<br/>
🎧 They are, <span>Amina</span>, but they're very <span>complex</span> and rather <span>unclear</span> at the <span>moment</span>.<br/>
🎧 You're going to have to <span>spend</span> a bit of time <span>making</span> the <span>data</span> a lot <span>clearer</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Okay..</span>.<br/>
🎧 as long as I don't have to <span>remove</span> them <span>altogether..</span>.<br/>
🎧 No, don't <span>worry</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about the <span>chronology..</span>.<br/>
🎧 the <span>list</span> of <span>dates</span>?<br/>
🎧 I wasn't sure <span>whether</span> I should <span>rewrite</span> those.<br/>
🎧 My advice on that is to take them out. I feel it makes the whole <span>piece</span> <span>appear</span> too <span>simplistic</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, if it'll help.<br/>
🎧 Now, there are a <span>couple</span> of other books I'd like you to look at.<br/>
🎧 Have you got a pen?<br/>
🎧 <span>Right..</span>. <span>Approaches</span> to <span>Local</span> <span>History</span> by <span>John</span> <span>Mervis..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Right..</span>.<br/>
🎧 And then I think you need to think about <span>ways</span> of <span>representing</span> <span>interview</span> <span>data</span>.<br/>
🎧 Have a look at <span>Sight</span> and Sound by <span>Kate</span> <span>Oakwell</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sight</span> and Sound.<br/>
🎧 Then you know I'm going away on <span>holiday</span> next <span>week..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 So when you've made the changes, I <span>suggest</span> you show the work to your <span>Support</span> <span>Tutor</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Support</span> <span>Tutor..</span>. <span>right..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then you do the <span>proof</span> <span>reading..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Proof</span> <span>reading..</span>.<br/>
🎧 When by, do you think?<br/>
🎧 I'd <span>aim</span> for the <span>29th</span> of <span>June<br/></span>
🎧 and after that you should get it <span>laser</span> <span>printed..</span>.<br/>
🎧 but be <span>careful</span> because the <span>computer</span> <span>centre</span> <span>closes</span> on <span>10</span> <span>July</span>.<br/>
🎧 And then I <span>hand</span> it in <span>to...</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh, the <span>Faculty</span> <span>Office</span> as <span>usual</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, that's fine.<br/>
🎧 I think I'm all set now!<br/>
🎧 Thanks very much for all your help.<br/>
🎧 A <span>pleasure</span>.<br/>
🎧 See you when I get back.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yep</span>. Thanks, <span>Dr</span> <span>Bryson</span>.<br/>
🎧 Bye.<br/>
🎧 Bye.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Good <span>afternoon</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>Paula</span> <span>Bundell<br/></span>
🎧 and I am <span>giving</span> you the <span>lectures</span> on <span>Environmental</span> <span>Noise</span> this <span>term</span>.<br/>
🎧 Today we are going to look into the <span>effects</span> of <span>noise</span> on a <span>planned</span> <span>housing</span> <span>estate<br/></span>
🎧 in a <span>particularly</span> <span>difficult</span> <span>part</span> of the new <span>Manchester</span> <span>Park</span> <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>site</span> is not as bad as some I have <span>researched</span> in the <span>past</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Blacktown</span> <span>airport</span> is <span>closed</span> from <span>6</span> pm to <span>7</span> <span>am<br/></span>
🎧 and this is a great <span>advantage</span> to the <span>site</span>.<br/>
🎧 The only <span>noise</span> after <span>dark</span> is from the <span>highway<br/></span>
🎧 and the <span>traffic</span> is <span>somewhat</span> <span>reduced</span> between <span>7.30</span> pm and <span>5.30</span> am.<br/>
🎧 So, the people most <span>affected</span> by the <span>noise</span> will be, I <span>expect</span>, <span>housewives</span>.<br/>
🎧 By the time most of the students and <span>workers</span> have <span>arrived</span> back home in the <span>evening</span> during the week,<br/>
🎧 the <span>noise</span> will have <span>abated</span> to a <span>fairly</span> large <span>extent</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>weekends</span> are still a <span>problem</span> of course,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>traffic</span> is <span>certainly</span> <span>reduced</span> on <span>Saturdays</span> to a large <span>extent<br/></span>
🎧 and even more so on <span>Sundays</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course, <span>modifications</span> to <span>houses</span> will be <span>necessary</span> at a <span>site</span> like <span>this<br/></span>
🎧 and they come at a <span>significant</span> <span>cost</span> to the <span>developer</span> and home <span>buyer</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>modifications</span> I am about to <span>outline<br/></span>
🎧 will add about <span>$25,000</span> to the <span>price</span> of a <span>newly-built</span> house.<br/>
🎧 That will still mean a <span>cheaper</span> house than in a less <span>noisy</span> and more <span>desirable</span> <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 A bit of <span>background</span> would not go <span>astray</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>understand</span> that you are all <span>familiar</span> with the <span>proposed</span> <span>development</span> <span>site</span> at <span>Manchester</span> <span>Park</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>particularly</span> <span>difficult</span> one in <span>terms</span> of <span>noise<br/></span>
🎧 with the <span>highway</span> along the <span>eastern</span> <span>perimeter<br/></span>
🎧 and the <span>Blacktown</span> <span>airport</span> not <span>3</span> <span>kilometres</span> away to the <span>north</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course, those <span>nearest</span> the <span>highway</span> will be the <span>worst</span> hit,<br/>
🎧 with <span>heavy</span> <span>traffic</span> <span>noise</span> as well as the <span>noise</span> from the <span>light</span> <span>planes</span> <span>overhead</span>.<br/>
🎧 As you all know, the <span>normal</span> <span>noise</span> <span>threshold</span> for <span>private</span> <span>housing</span> is <span>55</span> <span>decibels</span>.<br/>
🎧 At this <span>site</span> the <span>levels</span> have been <span>recorded</span> as high as <span>67</span> <span>decibels</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>construction</span> of the <span>houses</span> has to be <span>somewhat</span> <span>modified</span> from <span>houses</span> in most <span>areas</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>houses</span> on the <span>highway</span> and in the <span>noisiest</span> <span>areas</span> of this <span>site<br/></span>
🎧 there will be a need for <span>specialised</span> <span>double</span> <span>glazing<br/></span>
🎧 and special <span>acoustic</span> <span>seals</span> will have to be <span>fitted</span> to the <span>doors</span>.<br/>
🎧 All <span>exterior</span> <span>doors</span> in this <span>especially</span> <span>noisy</span> <span>pocket<br/></span>
🎧 will have to be <span>solid</span> <span>core</span> <span>wood</span> <span>doors</span> with <span>hinges</span>.<br/>
🎧 Every house <span>built</span> on this <span>site</span>,<br/>
🎧 not just those <span>adjacent</span> to the <span>highway</span> or <span>nearest</span> to the <span>airport</span>,<br/>
🎧 will <span>require</span> high <span>density</span> <span>insulation</span> <span>materials</span> in the <span>roof</span>.<br/>
🎧 Not only will all the <span>roofs</span> need <span>insulating</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>exterior</span> <span>walls</span> will be <span>required</span> to be <span>double</span> <span>brick</span>.<br/>
🎧 All <span>ceilings</span> will <span>require</span> <span>double</span> <span>thickness</span> <span>plaster</span> <span>board</span> to be used in the <span>construction</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>noisiest</span> <span>areas</span>, <span>mechanical</span> <span>ventilation</span> will have to be <span>installed</span> in the <span>exterior</span> <span>walls</span>.<br/>
🎧 In those <span>areas</span> with <span>sealed</span> <span>windows<br/></span>
🎧 it will be <span>necessary</span> to fit <span>fans</span> with <span>absorbers</span> to cut out the <span>noise</span> in those <span>particular</span> <span>houses</span>.<br/>
🎧 Air <span>conditioning</span> <span>units</span> could also be <span>fitted</span> in the <span>ceilings</span> of such <span>houses<br/></span>
🎧 but this is <span>substantially</span> more <span>expensive</span> than <span>fans</span>,<br/>
🎧 and may not be <span>needed</span> on this <span>site</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Coming</span> back now to the <span>double</span> <span>glazing</span> I <span>mentioned</span> before.<br/>
🎧 <span>Specialised</span> <span>double</span> <span>glazing</span> <span>requires</span> a <span>larger</span> air <span>gap<br/></span>
🎧 between the <span>inner</span> and <span>outer</span> <span>glass</span> than <span>normal</span> <span>double</span> <span>glazing</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>gap</span> must be at <span>least</span> <span>7</span> <span>centimetres</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>thickness</span> of the <span>glass</span> is also a <span>factor</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>8</span> <span>millimetres</span> on the outside and <span>6</span> on the inside <span>pane</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>essential</span> that the <span>glass</span> be <span>thicker</span> on the outside than on the <span>inside<br/></span>
🎧 and that the <span>gap</span> between the <span>panes</span> of <span>glass</span> be a <span>minimum</span> of <span>7</span> <span>centimetres</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Obviously</span>, the <span>noise</span> <span>factor</span> will have to be taken into <span>consideration</span> with the <span>layout</span> of the <span>houses</span>.<br/>
🎧 Living <span>areas</span> will have to be <span>designed</span> at the back of the <span>houses</span> away from the <span>highway</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Bedrooms</span> and living <span>rooms</span> will have to be <span>built</span> <span>towards</span> the back,<br/>
🎧 and for those <span>houses</span> <span>closest</span> to the <span>highway<br/></span>
🎧 two <span>layers</span> of <span>plasterboard</span> will be <span>needed</span> for the <span>interior</span> <span>bedroom</span> <span>walls</span>.<br/>
🎧 Those <span>rooms</span> <span>constructed</span> at the <span>front</span> of the <span>houses<br/></span>
🎧 should be <span>garages</span>, <span>laundries</span>, <span>kitchens</span>, <span>bathrooms</span> and <span>dining</span> <span>rooms</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have come to the <span>conclusion</span> that this <span>development</span> should go ahead,<br/>
🎧 but with <span>various</span> <span>acoustic</span> <span>modifications</span> <span>according</span> to the <span>position</span> of the <span>block<br/></span>
🎧 in <span>relation</span> to the <span>highway</span> and <span>intersection</span>.<br/>
