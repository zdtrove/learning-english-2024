🎧 John, I've just had some good news.<br/>
🎧 Susan has had her baby.<br/>
🎧 Do you know when she had it?<br/>
🎧 Yesterday.<br/>
🎧 The 10th of August.<br/>
🎧 Oh, my father was born on August the 10th.<br/>
🎧 Give me the details and I'll make a note for everyone at work.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Well, was it a boy or a girl?<br/>
🎧 It's a boy.<br/>
🎧 And what are they going to call him?<br/>
🎧 Tom.<br/>
🎧 Tom Lightfoot.<br/>
🎧 It sounds quite good, don't you think?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that has quite a good ring to it.<br/>
🎧 You know he's quite a big baby.<br/>
🎧 He weighed 4.25 kilos when he was born.<br/>
🎧 That does sound big, 4.25 kilos.<br/>
🎧 And he's long too, 46 centimetres.<br/>
🎧 Mmmm. Tall parents.<br/>
🎧 He'll grow up to be over 2 metres, I'd say.<br/>
🎧 With masses of black hair, curly black hair.<br/>
🎧 You know, we should go and visit them in hospital.<br/>
🎧 What about tomorrow afternoon at around 1 pm?<br/>
🎧 Yes, okay.<br/>
🎧 Where should we meet?...<br/>
🎧 Ah, I could come and pick you up at your house, if you like.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that would be wonderful.<br/>
🎧 My car is still off the road.<br/>
🎧 Just refresh my memory....<br/>
🎧 What's the address again?<br/>
🎧 It's 15 Chesterfield Road, Paddington.<br/>
🎧 It's next to the library, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Not exactly. It's next to a bank.<br/>
🎧 The State Bank actually.<br/>
🎧 The library is opposite us, on the corner.<br/>
🎧 That's right,<br/>
🎧 and there's a garage on the other street corner. I remember now.<br/>
🎧 So, you'll pick me up at 12.45<br/>
🎧 and we'll be there at one easily.<br/>
🎧 Now what should we take?<br/>
🎧 We must take them something.<br/>
🎧 I always think flowers are good to take to someone in hospital, don't you?<br/>
🎧 Well, not really.<br/>
🎧 Everyone always brings flowers and they don't last.<br/>
🎧 I think it's much better to take a pot plant,<br/>
🎧 so she can take it home with her.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but then she has to remember to water it.<br/>
🎧 What about a big box of chocolates?<br/>
🎧 Okay, chocolates sound fine.<br/>
🎧 We should get something for the baby too. What do you think?<br/>
🎧 Yes, you're right.<br/>
🎧 What do you think of something like baby shampoo or talcum powder?<br/>
🎧 Or we could get a little hat, or something like that.<br/>
🎧 We don't know the size, or the right colour, do we?<br/>
🎧 I think we should get something they wouldn't normally buy.<br/>
🎧 What about a soft toy of some sort?<br/>
🎧 Yes, a soft toy.<br/>
🎧 What about a teddy bear?<br/>
🎧 I could get one early tomorrow at the market<br/>
🎧 and I could probably get the chocolates there too.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 So you'll pick me up at a quarter to one at my place<br/>
🎧 and I'll make sure that I've got the presents.<br/>
🎧 You must remember how much you paid for the gifts,<br/>
🎧 so I can pay you back for half.<br/>
🎧 If they're going to be from both of us, I would like to go shares.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 I'd say the chocolates would be about $15 for something nice and not too small<br/>
🎧 and the toy would be around $35 or so, I'd think.<br/>
🎧 Good, that'll be fine. About $25 each then.<br/>
🎧 Good, I'll pick you up then on Sunday at 12.45.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 See you then. Bye.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Good evening.<br/>
🎧 Tonight's show comes to you from the Good Home Exhibition in Duke's Court,<br/>
🎧 where we've been trying out some of the latest gadgets on show here<br/>
🎧 and getting our resident expert - Liz Shearer -<br/>
🎧 to tell us which ones are worth buying and which will die a death.<br/>
🎧 Well, hello.<br/>
🎧 Yes, John, I've been investigating four new household gadgets<br/>
🎧 and sorting out the advantages and disadvantages<br/>
🎧 and then really deciding what are 'Must buys',<br/>
🎧 what are 'Maybe buys' and what are 'Never buys'.<br/>
🎧 Let's start with this vacuum flask for keeping drinks hot.<br/>
🎧 I felt this had quite a lot going for it,<br/>
🎧 most of all is the fact that it contains no glass<br/>
🎧 and is therefore unbreakable to all intents and purposes.<br/>
🎧 It's made of stainless steel which is guaranteed for 20 years...<br/>
🎧 hope that's long enough...<br/>
🎧 and it's true what the manufacturer claims<br/>
🎧 that it does maintain heat for 18 hours.<br/>
🎧 So that's pretty good.<br/>
🎧 On the down side, it really works out to be quite expensive<br/>
🎧 and, much more surprisingly,<br/>
🎧 it unfortunately leaves a strange taste...<br/>
🎧 you know, when you've drunk from it...<br/>
🎧 so all in all, my recommendation would be it's got plenty of advantages,<br/>
🎧 but it is rather expensive so I'd say you should maybe buy it.<br/>
🎧 Moving on to a natty little device...<br/>
🎧 the Whistle Key Holder.<br/>
🎧 Basically this is where you whistle<br/>
🎧 and the key holder gives off a high pitched noise and flashes light<br/>
🎧 so you can find it.<br/>
🎧 One advantage of this model is that it also has a small light.<br/>
🎧 You press the button and this means you can find keyholes easily.<br/>
🎧 I also felt the small size was a real advantage.<br/>
🎧 On the weaker side, I did find the noise unpleasant.<br/>
🎧 Which I'm sure the designers could have done something about.<br/>
🎧 And I found that it didn't work through metal, so...<br/>
🎧 it's mainly used for finding in coat pockets, cushions, etc.<br/>
🎧 But taken as a whole I thought it was a masterpiece of design<br/>
🎧 and would highly recommend it.<br/>
🎧 The third gizmo is called the Army Flashlight<br/>
🎧 because it was developed initially for military use.<br/>
🎧 It works by squeezing the handle to generate the power.<br/>
🎧 Its advantages are that it can be used for outside activities,<br/>
🎧 and also... and, this is one of the surprising features...<br/>
🎧 it does work underwater.<br/>
🎧 My main objection to it though was, although it did work in these conditions,<br/>
🎧 this model gave off a weak light.<br/>
🎧 So my recommendation I'm afraid would have to be to avoid this one.<br/>
🎧 The decoy camera was last on my list.<br/>
🎧 This is a fake video camera which you fix to your wall to scare off burglars.<br/>
🎧 The advantage of this model is something which makes it look very realistic...<br/>
🎧 its flashing light.<br/>
🎧 On the down side, it was quite difficult to fix to the wall.<br/>
🎧 However, burglary is such a major problem these days that it is worth the effort, so...<br/>
🎧 this gets my strong recommendation.<br/>
🎧 Okay. Thanks for that, Liz.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Well, Amina, thanks for letting me have your draft in such good time.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's alright.<br/>
🎧 I was just very anxious to hear what you think of it.<br/>
🎧 You can see that I decided to change the topic.<br/>
🎧 I had been interested in looking at Barings Factory.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I think the hospital was a much better choice.<br/>
🎧 In fact... well... I have to say that I thought it was good.<br/>
🎧 Oh?<br/>
🎧 There's still lots of work to be done...<br/>
🎧 Oh yes... of course.<br/>
🎧 But there's plenty of good ideas.<br/>
🎧 It opens well and the first chapter is fine<br/>
🎧 but the middle section really stood out for me... most interesting.<br/>
🎧 That's amazing<br/>
🎧 because I really didn't find it a bit easy to write...<br/>
🎧 How long did you work on the whole thing?<br/>
🎧 Well, I spent about two or three weeks reading and doing general research<br/>
🎧 and then I dashed the writing off very quickly...<br/>
🎧 so about four weeks in all.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's about par for the course.<br/>
🎧 You've got a while yet to make the changes.<br/>
🎧 Oh right... no problem...<br/>
🎧 Right. Let's have a look at my notes here.<br/>
🎧 Okay. Starting with section headings...<br/>
🎧 the broad divisions are good but you'll have to re-do the actual headings.<br/>
🎧 I've made some suggestions in the margins...<br/>
🎧 Okay. Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Now, this information on local housing...<br/>
🎧 I can see why you put it there<br/>
🎧 but it really isn't relevant to the approach you've taken.<br/>
🎧 I think I see what you mean.<br/>
🎧 Now... what did I say about the interviews?<br/>
🎧 I worked very hard on those.<br/>
🎧 I really thought they were valuable.<br/>
🎧 They are, Amina, but they're very complex and rather unclear at the moment.<br/>
🎧 You're going to have to spend a bit of time making the data a lot clearer.<br/>
🎧 Okay...<br/>
🎧 as long as I don't have to remove them altogether...<br/>
🎧 No, don't worry.<br/>
🎧 What about the chronology...<br/>
🎧 the list of dates?<br/>
🎧 I wasn't sure whether I should rewrite those.<br/>
🎧 My advice on that is to take them out. I feel it makes the whole piece appear too simplistic.<br/>
🎧 Okay, if it'll help.<br/>
🎧 Now, there are a couple of other books I'd like you to look at.<br/>
🎧 Have you got a pen?<br/>
🎧 Right... Approaches to Local History by John Mervis...<br/>
🎧 Right...<br/>
🎧 And then I think you need to think about ways of representing interview data.<br/>
🎧 Have a look at Sight and Sound by Kate Oakwell.<br/>
🎧 Sight and Sound.<br/>
🎧 Then you know I'm going away on holiday next week...<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 So when you've made the changes, I suggest you show the work to your Support Tutor.<br/>
🎧 Support Tutor... right...<br/>
🎧 Then you do the proof reading...<br/>
🎧 Proof reading...<br/>
🎧 When by, do you think?<br/>
🎧 I'd aim for the 29th of June<br/>
🎧 and after that you should get it laser printed...<br/>
🎧 but be careful because the computer centre closes on 10 July.<br/>
🎧 And then I hand it in to...?<br/>
🎧 Oh, the Faculty Office as usual.<br/>
🎧 Okay, that's fine.<br/>
🎧 I think I'm all set now!<br/>
🎧 Thanks very much for all your help.<br/>
🎧 A pleasure.<br/>
🎧 See you when I get back.<br/>
🎧 Yep. Thanks, Dr Bryson.<br/>
🎧 Bye.<br/>
🎧 Bye.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Good afternoon.<br/>
🎧 I'm Paula Bundell<br/>
🎧 and I am giving you the lectures on Environmental Noise this term.<br/>
🎧 Today we are going to look into the effects of noise on a planned housing estate<br/>
🎧 in a particularly difficult part of the new Manchester Park area.<br/>
🎧 This site is not as bad as some I have researched in the past.<br/>
🎧 The Blacktown airport is closed from 6 pm to 7 am<br/>
🎧 and this is a great advantage to the site.<br/>
🎧 The only noise after dark is from the highway<br/>
🎧 and the traffic is somewhat reduced between 7.30 pm and 5.30 am.<br/>
🎧 So, the people most affected by the noise will be, I expect, housewives.<br/>
🎧 By the time most of the students and workers have arrived back home in the evening during the week,<br/>
🎧 the noise will have abated to a fairly large extent.<br/>
🎧 The weekends are still a problem of course,<br/>
🎧 but the traffic is certainly reduced on Saturdays to a large extent<br/>
🎧 and even more so on Sundays.<br/>
🎧 Of course, modifications to houses will be necessary at a site like this<br/>
🎧 and they come at a significant cost to the developer and home buyer.<br/>
🎧 The modifications I am about to outline<br/>
🎧 will add about $25,000 to the price of a newly-built house.<br/>
🎧 That will still mean a cheaper house than in a less noisy and more desirable area.<br/>
🎧 A bit of background would not go astray.<br/>
🎧 I understand that you are all familiar with the proposed development site at Manchester Park.<br/>
🎧 It's a particularly difficult one in terms of noise<br/>
🎧 with the highway along the eastern perimeter<br/>
🎧 and the Blacktown airport not 3 kilometres away to the north.<br/>
🎧 Of course, those nearest the highway will be the worst hit,<br/>
🎧 with heavy traffic noise as well as the noise from the light planes overhead.<br/>
🎧 As you all know, the normal noise threshold for private housing is 55 decibels.<br/>
🎧 At this site the levels have been recorded as high as 67 decibels.<br/>
🎧 The construction of the houses has to be somewhat modified from houses in most areas.<br/>
🎧 In the houses on the highway and in the noisiest areas of this site<br/>
🎧 there will be a need for specialised double glazing<br/>
🎧 and special acoustic seals will have to be fitted to the doors.<br/>
🎧 All exterior doors in this especially noisy pocket<br/>
🎧 will have to be solid core wood doors with hinges.<br/>
🎧 Every house built on this site,<br/>
🎧 not just those adjacent to the highway or nearest to the airport,<br/>
🎧 will require high density insulation materials in the roof.<br/>
🎧 Not only will all the roofs need insulating,<br/>
🎧 the exterior walls will be required to be double brick.<br/>
🎧 All ceilings will require double thickness plaster board to be used in the construction.<br/>
🎧 In the noisiest areas, mechanical ventilation will have to be installed in the exterior walls.<br/>
🎧 In those areas with sealed windows<br/>
🎧 it will be necessary to fit fans with absorbers to cut out the noise in those particular houses.<br/>
🎧 Air conditioning units could also be fitted in the ceilings of such houses<br/>
🎧 but this is substantially more expensive than fans,<br/>
🎧 and may not be needed on this site.<br/>
🎧 Coming back now to the double glazing I mentioned before.<br/>
🎧 Specialised double glazing requires a larger air gap<br/>
🎧 between the inner and outer glass than normal double glazing.<br/>
🎧 The gap must be at least 7 centimetres.<br/>
🎧 The thickness of the glass is also a factor,<br/>
🎧 8 millimetres on the outside and 6 on the inside pane.<br/>
🎧 It's essential that the glass be thicker on the outside than on the inside<br/>
🎧 and that the gap between the panes of glass be a minimum of 7 centimetres.<br/>
🎧 Obviously, the noise factor will have to be taken into consideration with the layout of the houses.<br/>
🎧 Living areas will have to be designed at the back of the houses away from the highway.<br/>
🎧 Bedrooms and living rooms will have to be built towards the back,<br/>
🎧 and for those houses closest to the highway<br/>
🎧 two layers of plasterboard will be needed for the interior bedroom walls.<br/>
🎧 Those rooms constructed at the front of the houses<br/>
🎧 should be garages, laundries, kitchens, bathrooms and dining rooms.<br/>
🎧 I have come to the conclusion that this development should go ahead,<br/>
🎧 but with various acoustic modifications according to the position of the block<br/>
🎧 in relation to the highway and intersection.<br/>
<br/><br/>
