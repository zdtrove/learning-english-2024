🎧 Good morning, <span>North</span> <span>College</span> <span>Library</span>.<br/>
🎧 How can I help you?<br/>
🎧 I was <span>wondering</span> if it was <span>possible</span> to join the <span>library</span>.<br/>
🎧 Are you a student at <span>North</span> <span>College</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, I'm not, but <span>someone</span> told me it was <span>possible</span> to join, even if I wasn't.<br/>
🎧 That's right, it is.<br/>
🎧 Are you over <span>18</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's our <span>minimum</span> <span>joining</span> age.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I am.<br/>
🎧 That's no <span>problem</span> then.<br/>
🎧 Could you tell me what I have to do to join?<br/>
🎧 Well, you'll need to come in to the <span>library</span> and <span>fill</span> out some <span>forms</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll also need to <span>bring</span> two <span>passport</span> <span>photos</span> with you.<br/>
🎧 We also need two <span>documents</span> for <span>ID</span>, so a driving <span>licence</span> would be fine.<br/>
🎧 I've got that.<br/>
🎧 And what else? A <span>credit</span> <span>card</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, it needs to have your <span>address</span> on it.<br/>
🎧 Shall I <span>bring</span> a <span>bank</span> <span>statement</span>, would that do?<br/>
🎧 <span>That'll</span> be fine.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 Does it <span>cost</span> anything to join?<br/>
🎧 Well, it's free for students here but <span>otherwise</span> it's <span>£125</span> <span>per</span> <span>year<br/></span>
🎧 or <span>£25</span> if you've got a <span>current</span> student <span>card</span> from another <span>college</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was at <span>Westerley</span> <span>College</span> until last year <span>but..</span>.<br/>
🎧 now I've got a <span>job</span> at <span>Jefferson's</span> <span>steel</span> <span>factory</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Er</span>, it's more <span>expensive</span> than I thought.<br/>
🎧 My <span>local</span> <span>library</span> is free.<br/>
🎧 But you'll find they don't have the <span>range</span> of <span>reference</span> books or <span>facilities</span> which we buy for our students.<br/>
🎧 That's why you have to pay to be an <span>external</span> <span>member</span>.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 How many books can I <span>borrow</span>?<br/>
🎧 We <span>allow</span> <span>twelve</span> <span>items</span> <span>borrowed</span> at any one time if you're a student,<br/>
🎧 and that <span>includes</span> <span>CDs</span>, <span>DVDs</span> and <span>videos</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, it's only <span>eight</span> <span>items</span> for <span>members</span> of the <span>public</span>.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 And how long can I have them for?<br/>
🎧 Well, you can have both <span>fiction</span> and <span>reference</span> books for <span>four</span> <span>weeks<br/></span>
🎧 which isn't bad really.<br/>
🎧 And what <span>happens</span> if I <span>return</span> them <span>late</span>?<br/>
🎧 Like all <span>libraries</span>, there's a fine <span>system</span> in place.<br/>
🎧 The <span>minimum</span> fine is <span>£1.50<br/></span>
🎧 but it can be much <span>higher</span> for some <span>items</span> <span>-</span> up to <span>£5</span> <span>per</span> week.<br/>
🎧 We'll give you a <span>booklet</span> with all the <span>details</span> when you join.<br/>
🎧 You can always <span>renew</span> <span>items</span> if they're not <span>required</span> by <span>anyone</span> <span>else<br/></span>
🎧 by <span>telephoning</span> or <span>logging</span> on to our <span>website</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about the <span>computers</span>?<br/>
🎧 Can I use them free of <span>charge</span>?<br/>
🎧 For <span>college</span> students it's free, but for <span>external</span> <span>members</span> like yourself,<br/>
🎧 the first <span>hour</span> is <span>free<br/></span>
🎧 and then we make a <span>nominal</span> <span>charge</span> of <span>£1</span> <span>per</span> <span>hour</span> <span>thereafter</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do I have to book in <span>advance</span> for them?<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes, it's <span>advisable</span>.<br/>
🎧 Most people <span>tend</span> to book <span>twenty-four</span> hours in <span>advance<br/></span>
🎧 although sometimes you can get one with only six <span>hours'</span> <span>notice</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, the <span>earliest</span> you can book a <span>computer</span> is <span>forty-eight</span> hours before you need it,<br/>
🎧 and you can only book one <span>hour</span> at a time.<br/>
🎧 If <span>no-one</span> else has <span>booked</span> the <span>computer</span> out,<br/>
🎧 then you may be able to have another <span>hour</span> if you want.<br/>
🎧 We have a <span>wide</span> <span>range</span> of <span>databases</span>,<br/>
🎧 so the <span>computers</span> are in great <span>demand</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm thinking of doing some <span>writing<br/></span>
🎧 and I might need to <span>access</span> <span>national</span> <span>newspapers</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you have them on these <span>databases</span>?<br/>
🎧 We do <span>indeed</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've got all the big <span>nationals</span>, The <span>Guardian</span> and The <span>Observer</span>, The <span>Independent..</span>.<br/>
🎧 and The <span>Times</span> and <span>Sunday</span> <span>Times</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've also got all the <span>local</span> <span>papers<br/></span>
🎧 and a <span>wide</span> <span>selection</span> of <span>magazines</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Excellent</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>assume</span> you have <span>photocopying</span> <span>facilities</span>?<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 <span>5p</span> a <span>sheet</span> for both <span>A4</span> and <span>A3</span> <span>black-and-white</span> <span>copies<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>40p</span> a <span>sheet</span> for <span>colour</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can get a <span>card</span> from the <span>counter</span> here <span>-</span> it doesn't take <span>coins</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Oh by the way, another thing I was <span>wondering</span> about <span>was<br/></span>
🎧 if you ran any <span>writing</span> <span>classes</span> through the <span>library</span>?<br/>
🎧 We do, but you'll have to speak to <span>John</span> <span>Grantingham</span> about that.<br/>
🎧 He's our <span>resident</span> <span>author</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>runs</span> the <span>creative</span> <span>writing</span> <span>classes</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>John..</span>. <span>Grant...</span>. Could you <span>spell</span> that for me please?<br/>
🎧 <span>Certainly</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>GRANTINGHAM</span>.<br/>
🎧 Are the <span>classes</span> here at the <span>library</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes <span>-</span> he's here on <span>Thursday</span> <span>evenings</span>.<br/>
🎧 No, sorry, <span>Friday</span> <span>-</span> he's just <span>changed</span> it.<br/>
🎧 You can <span>contact</span> him by <span>emailing</span> the <span>library</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Right, well that's about all I need to know.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 I'll be along later this week to join.<br/>
🎧 Thanks. Bye.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 My <span>name's</span> <span>Dan</span> <span>Pearman<br/></span>
🎧 and I'd like to talk about the work of <span>Pedal</span> <span>Power</span>,<br/>
🎧 a small <span>charity</span> <span>based</span> <span>mainly</span> in the <span>UK</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll be <span>giving</span> our <span>contact</span> <span>details</span> at the end,<br/>
🎧 if <span>anyone</span> would like to find out more about how to <span>support</span> us.<br/>
🎧 But first, how the <span>charity</span> <span>began</span>.<br/>
🎧 I got the idea of <span>exporting</span> <span>bicycles</span> to <span>developing</span> <span>countries</span> while I was in <span>Ecuador</span>.<br/>
🎧 I went there in <span>1993</span> just after <span>graduating</span> from university.<br/>
🎧 After <span>three</span> years of <span>studying</span>, I wanted <span>adventure</span>.<br/>
🎧 I loved <span>travelling</span>,<br/>
🎧 so I <span>decided</span> to join a <span>voluntary</span> <span>organisation<br/></span>
🎧 and was <span>sent</span> to <span>Ecuador</span> to <span>carry</span> out <span>land</span> <span>surveys</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>project</span> came to an end after <span>five</span> <span>years<br/></span>
🎧 and when I <span>returned</span> to the <span>UK</span> in <span>1998</span>,<br/>
🎧 I <span>started</span> planning <span>Pedal</span> <span>Power</span>.<br/>
🎧 Where I <span>lived</span> in <span>Ecuador</span> was a very <span>rural</span> <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>neighbour</span> had the only <span>bicycle</span> in the <span>village</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>whereas</span> everyone else <span>walked</span> <span>everywhere</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>neighbour's</span> <span>business</span> was <span>unusually</span> <span>successful</span>,<br/>
🎧 and for years I couldn't <span>understand</span> why.<br/>
🎧 Then I <span>realised</span> having a <span>bike</span> <span>meant</span> he could get where he wanted to go without much <span>trouble</span>.<br/>
🎧 Other <span>local</span> <span>carpenters</span> could only <span>accept</span> <span>jobs</span> in a <span>3</span> <span>kilometre</span> <span>radius</span>,<br/>
🎧 so no <span>matter</span> how <span>skilled</span> they were, they could never do as many <span>jobs</span> as my <span>neighbour</span>.<br/>
🎧 At <span>Pedal</span> <span>Power</span>, we <span>collect</span> <span>second-hand</span> <span>bikes</span> in the <span>UK<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>send</span> them to some of the <span>poorest</span> <span>regions</span> in the <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 When we <span>distribute</span> <span>bikes</span> <span>overseas</span>, we don't give them away for free.<br/>
🎧 We'd like to, but long <span>term</span> that doesn't really help the <span>local</span> <span>economy</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>demand</span> for <span>bikes</span> is <span>enormous</span>, which makes them very <span>expensive</span> <span>locally</span>.<br/>
🎧 So we sell them for <span>5%</span> of the <span>normal</span> <span>price</span>.<br/>
🎧 But in order to <span>continue</span> <span>operating</span>,<br/>
🎧 we need to have a <span>constant</span> <span>supply</span> of <span>bikes</span> which we <span>send</span> out every six <span>months</span>.<br/>
🎧 One example of a <span>town</span> that's <span>received</span> <span>bicycles</span> from <span>Pedal</span> <span>Power</span> is <span>Rivas</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was the first place I <span>sent</span> a full <span>container</span> of <span>bicycles</span> to.<br/>
🎧 Most people there now own a <span>bicycle</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>local</span> <span>economy</span> has <span>developed</span> so much,<br/>
🎧 you wouldn't <span>recognise</span> it as the same place.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, there are more <span>bikes</span> than on the <span>streets</span> of <span>Amsterdam</span>, if you've ever been there.<br/>
🎧 But <span>Pedal</span> <span>Power</span> still needs your help.<br/>
🎧 You may have read about some of our <span>recent</span> <span>problems</span> in the <span>British</span> <span>media</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>August</span> <span>2000</span>, we <span>simply</span> ran out of money.<br/>
🎧 We had <span>containers</span> of <span>bikes</span> ready to <span>send</span>,<br/>
🎧 but no money to pay the <span>bills</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was a <span>terrible</span> <span>situation</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>managed</span> to <span>ensure</span> the <span>bikes</span> went out on time,<br/>
🎧 but the other <span>problems</span> <span>carried</span> on for <span>several</span> <span>months</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Fortunately</span>, in <span>October</span> <span>2001</span>,<br/>
🎧 we <span>won</span> an <span>Enterprise</span> <span>Award</span> which <span>helped</span> us <span>enormously</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>invested</span> <span>15</span> of the <span>75,000</span> <span>pound</span> <span>prize</span> money to help <span>secure</span> our future.<br/>
🎧 <span>Winning</span> the <span>award</span> <span>helped</span> <span>raise</span> our <span>profile</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the money <span>enabled</span> us to pay all our <span>shipping</span> <span>costs</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>represent</span> our <span>greatest</span> <span>expense</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Pedal</span> <span>Power</span> changes lives <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 when <span>someone</span> <span>gets</span> a <span>bicycle</span> from us, they see a <span>14%</span> <span>increase</span> in their <span>income</span>.<br/>
🎧 We're <span>currently</span> looking to <span>invest</span> in <span>computers<br/></span>
🎧 so that our <span>office</span> <span>staff</span> can do an even better <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 Because of our work, people in a number of <span>countries</span> now have a better <span>standard</span> of living <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 so <span>far</span> we've <span>provided</span> <span>46,000</span> people with <span>bikes</span>.<br/>
🎧 But we'd like to <span>send</span> more, at <span>least</span> <span>50,000</span> by the end of the year.<br/>
🎧 Now there are many <span>ways</span> in which you can <span>support</span> the work of <span>Pedal</span> <span>Power</span>,<br/>
🎧 not just by taking a <span>bike</span> to a <span>collection</span> in your <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 I should also like to say if you do have a <span>bike</span> to <span>donate</span>,<br/>
🎧 it doesn't <span>matter</span> what <span>condition</span> it's in.<br/>
🎧 If we can't <span>repair</span> it, we'll <span>strip</span> it down for <span>spare</span> <span>parts</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course, to do that we always need <span>tools</span>, which are <span>expensive</span> to buy,<br/>
🎧 so we <span>welcome</span> any that you can give.<br/>
🎧 Also, you could help by <span>contacting</span> the <span>voluntary</span> <span>staff</span> at our <span>offices</span>,<br/>
🎧 they'll be able to <span>suggest</span> <span>activities</span> you could <span>organise</span> to <span>bring</span> in <span>funds</span> for us.<br/>
🎧 People do all <span>kinds</span> of things <span>-</span> <span>including</span>, of course, <span>sponsored</span> <span>bike</span> <span>rides</span>.<br/>
🎧 Also, we're always interested to hear of other <span>places</span> that would <span>benefit</span> from <span>receiving</span> a <span>consignment</span> of <span>bikes</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>welcome</span> <span>suggestions</span> from people who've been to <span>developing</span> <span>regions</span> on their <span>travels</span>.<br/>
🎧 We hope that by talking on <span>radio</span> <span>programmes</span> like this,<br/>
🎧 we will be able to <span>raise</span> <span>public</span> <span>awareness</span>,<br/>
🎧 which will <span>lead</span> to <span>government</span> <span>organisations</span> also <span>giving</span> us <span>regular</span> <span>financial</span> <span>support</span>,<br/>
🎧 something that we really need.<br/>
🎧 If you'd like some more <span>information</span> about where to <span>donate</span> an old <span>bicycle<br/></span>
🎧 or <span>offer</span> help in other <span>ways</span>, please <span>contact..</span>.<br/>

🎧 First of all I'd just like to say, <span>Cristina</span> and <span>Ibrahim</span>,<br/>
🎧 that I really <span>enjoyed</span> watching your <span>video</span> about student life last week,<br/>
🎧 and I could see that the <span>rest</span> of the group did too.<br/>
🎧 You did really well, and I hope that you got a lot out of it.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to use this <span>tutorial</span> as a <span>feedback</span> <span>session</span>,<br/>
🎧 where you <span>reflect</span> on the <span>experience</span> of doing the <span>project</span>.<br/>
🎧 So <span>Cristina</span>, I was <span>wondering</span>, what did you enjoy most about <span>making</span> the <span>video</span>?<br/>
🎧 I <span>liked</span> <span>using</span> the <span>camera</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is it the first time you've <span>operated</span> one like that?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it is.<br/>
🎧 Well the <span>results</span> were very good!<br/>
🎧 Anything else?<br/>
🎧 I also <span>enjoyed</span> <span>visiting</span> one of the <span>British</span> students we <span>filmed</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd never been inside a <span>British</span> home before.<br/>
🎧 Okay <span>Cristina</span>, thanks.<br/>
🎧 What about you, <span>Ibrahim</span>?<br/>
🎧 What did you enjoy?<br/>
🎧 Well, for me it was a very good <span>chance</span> to get to know students who are on other <span>courses</span>,<br/>
🎧 because everyone in our group is <span>studying</span> English, <span>and..</span>.<br/>
🎧 we don't usually have much to do with the <span>rest</span> of the <span>college</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, good.<br/>
🎧 Do you think you'll <span>maintain</span> the <span>contact</span> now?<br/>
🎧 I hope so.<br/>
🎧 I've <span>invited</span> <span>three</span> of them to have dinner with me next week.<br/>
🎧 Great!<br/>
🎧 If you haven't <span>decided</span> what to make yet, I can tell you they'll love trying <span>Arab</span> <span>dishes</span>.<br/>
🎧 And of course, it's good for your English too.<br/>
🎧 <span>Cristina</span>, what did you find?<br/>
🎧 What was the most <span>useful</span> <span>aspect</span> of the <span>project</span> from the <span>point</span> of <span>view</span> of the English practice?<br/>
🎧 I think, when we were being <span>shown</span> how to <span>edit</span> the <span>film</span>,<br/>
🎧 we had to <span>follow</span> the <span>instructions</span>.<br/>
🎧 And that was very good practice for me.<br/>
🎧 And I also <span>learned</span> some <span>technical</span> <span>words</span> that I hadn't heard before.<br/>
🎧 What about you <span>Ibrahim</span>?<br/>
🎧 What was the most <span>useful</span> for your English?<br/>
🎧 It was <span>listening</span> to the <span>British</span> students,<br/>
🎧 because they don't speak as <span>slowly</span> as most of the <span>tutors</span> on our course.<br/>
🎧 I think they speak at <span>natural</span> <span>speed</span>,<br/>
🎧 so it <span>forces</span> me to get used to it.<br/>
🎧 And they use a lot of <span>slang</span>.<br/>
🎧 So you <span>learned</span> some new <span>words</span> which will be <span>useful</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 I'm glad it <span>helped</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, we've <span>talked</span> a little bit about <span>enjoyment</span>, and about <span>language</span> practice.<br/>
🎧 Were there any other <span>benefits</span>?<br/>
🎧 What else did you feel you'd <span>learnt</span> from the <span>project</span>?<br/>
🎧 Was it <span>useful</span> in other <span>ways</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, well <span>firstly</span>, I <span>learned</span> how to use a <span>video</span> <span>camera</span>.<br/>
🎧 And also, I think I really <span>learned</span> a lot about working together with other people.<br/>
🎧 I've never done anything with a group before,<br/>
🎧 and we had to find <span>ways</span> of <span>cooperating</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>erm</span>, and <span>compromising</span>,<br/>
🎧 and sometimes <span>persuading</span> people, when they don't agree with you.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that is a very <span>useful</span> <span>experience</span>, I know.<br/>
🎧 What about you, <span>Ibrahim</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I think I <span>learnt</span> a lot about how important <span>editing</span> is.<br/>
🎧 When you're <span>filming</span>, you think that <span>everything's</span> going to be <span>interesting</span>,<br/>
🎧 but in <span>fact</span> we cut around <span>half</span> of it in the end,<br/>
🎧 and then it was much better.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 Well, one last thing I'd like to ask.<br/>
🎧 What <span>mistakes</span> do you think you, as a group that is, made?<br/>
🎧 I mean, to put it another way, if you had to do it all over again,<br/>
🎧 is there anything you'd do <span>differently</span>?<br/>
🎧 We didn't plan very well.<br/>
🎧 For example, we didn't decide on <span>dates</span> when we'd <span>complete</span> each <span>separate</span> <span>step</span> of the <span>project</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we should have agreed about that in the <span>beginning</span>,<br/>
🎧 because we were always <span>late</span> with everything!<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Anything else?<br/>
🎧 I think we should have <span>tried</span> to <span>experiment</span> more with the <span>camera</span>.<br/>
🎧 I mean with <span>angles</span>, and the focus and that kind of thing.<br/>
🎧 So you should have been more <span>ambitious</span>?<br/>
🎧 Do you agree, <span>Ibrahim</span>?<br/>
🎧 Not really.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, I think we were too <span>ambitious</span>.<br/>
🎧 We were <span>inexperienced</span>, and we didn't have a lot of time,<br/>
🎧 and we <span>tried</span> to do too much, to make a long <span>film</span>.<br/>
🎧 Next time I would make a <span>shorter</span> one and try to get the <span>quality</span> better.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's very <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 Next <span>semester</span> we will be doing another <span>video</span> <span>project</span> <span>-</span> with a different <span>content</span>, of course <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 but you'll have an <span>opportunity</span> to put into practice what you've <span>learnt</span> this time.<br/>
🎧 Do you have any <span>ideas</span> <span>about..</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 <span>Tonight</span> I'm going to talk to you about that <span>remarkable</span> <span>continent</span> <span>Antarctica</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>remote</span>, <span>hostile</span> and at <span>present</span> <span>uninhabited</span> on a <span>permanent</span> <span>basis</span>.<br/>
🎧 For <span>early</span> <span>explorers</span>, it was the <span>ultimate</span> <span>survival</span> <span>contest;<br/></span>
🎧 for <span>researchers</span> like me, it <span>remains</span> a place of great <span>intellectual</span> <span>challenge;<br/></span>
🎧 while for the <span>modern</span> <span>tourist</span>, it's <span>simply</span> a <span>wilderness</span> of great <span>beauty</span>.<br/>
🎧 First, some <span>facts</span> and <span>figures</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Antarctica</span> is a place of <span>extremes<br/></span>
🎧 <span>-</span> the <span>highest</span>, <span>coldest</span> and <span>windiest</span> <span>continent<br/></span>
🎧 and over <span>58</span> <span>times</span> the size of the <span>UK</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>ice-cap</span> <span>contains</span> almost <span>70%</span> of the <span>world's</span> <span>fresh</span> water and <span>90%</span> of its ice,<br/>
🎧 but with very low <span>snowfall</span>,<br/>
🎧 most of the <span>continent</span> <span>technically</span> <span>falls</span> <span>unbelievably</span> into the <span>category</span> of <span>"desert"</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Huge</span> <span>icebergs</span> <span>break</span> off the <span>continent</span> each year,<br/>
🎧 while in <span>winter</span> <span>half</span> the <span>surrounding</span> <span>ocean</span> <span>freezes</span> over,<br/>
🎧 which <span>means</span> its size almost <span>doubles</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Research</span> and <span>exploration</span> has been going on in <span>Antarctica</span> for more than <span>200</span> years,<br/>
🎧 and has <span>involved</span> <span>scientists</span> from many different <span>countries</span>,<br/>
🎧 who work together on <span>research</span> <span>stations</span>.<br/>
🎧 Here <span>science</span> and <span>technical</span> <span>support</span> have been <span>integrated</span> in a very <span>cost-effective</span> way <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 our <span>Antarctic</span> <span>research</span> <span>programme</span> has <span>several</span> <span>summers-only</span> <span>stations<br/></span>
🎧 and two <span>all-year-round</span> <span>ones;<br/></span>
🎧 I was <span>based</span> on one of the <span>all-year-round</span> <span>ones</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>research</span> <span>stations</span> are really <span>self-contained</span> <span>communities</span> of about <span>20</span> people.<br/>
🎧 There's living and working <span>space</span>,<br/>
🎧 a <span>kitchen</span> with a <span>huge</span> food <span>store</span>,<br/>
🎧 a small <span>hospital<br/></span>
🎧 and a <span>well-equipped</span> gym to <span>ensure</span> everyone <span>keeps</span> fit in their <span>spare</span> time.<br/>
🎧 The <span>station</span> <span>generates</span> its own <span>electricity<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>communicates</span> with the outside <span>world</span> <span>using</span> a <span>satellite</span> <span>link</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>station</span> <span>-</span> <span>Zero</span> One <span>-</span> had some special <span>features</span>.<br/>
🎧 It wasn't <span>built</span> on <span>land</span> but on an <span>ice-shelf</span>, <span>hundreds</span> of <span>metres</span> <span>thick</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Supplies</span> were <span>brought</span> to us on large <span>sledges<br/></span>
🎧 from a <span>ship</span> <span>15</span> <span>kilometres</span> away at the ice <span>edge</span>.<br/>
🎧 Living in the <span>Antarctic</span> hasn't always been so <span>comfortable</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Snow</span> <span>build-ups</span> <span>caused</span> <span>enormous</span> <span>problems</span> for <span>four</span> <span>previous</span> <span>stations</span> on the same <span>site</span>,<br/>
🎧 which were <span>buried</span> and finally <span>crushed</span> by the <span>weight</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Fortunately</span> no one was <span>hurt</span>,<br/>
🎧 but these <span>buildings</span> <span>became</span> a <span>huge</span> <span>challenge</span> to <span>architects<br/></span>
🎧 who finally came up with a <span>remarkable</span> <span>solution</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>buildings</span> are <span>placed</span> on <span>platforms<br/></span>
🎧 which can be <span>raised</span> <span>above</span> the <span>changing</span> <span>snow</span> <span>level</span> on <span>legs</span> which are <span>extendable</span>.<br/>
🎧 Food is one of the most important <span>aspects</span> of <span>survival</span> in a <span>polar</span> <span>climate</span>.<br/>
🎧 People living there need to <span>obtain</span> a lot more <span>energy</span> from their food,<br/>
🎧 both to keep <span>warm</span> and to <span>undertake</span> <span>heavy</span> <span>physical</span> work.<br/>
🎧 Maybe you know that an <span>adult</span> in the <span>UK<br/></span>
🎧 will probably need about <span>1,700</span> <span>kilocalories</span> a day on <span>average;<br/></span>
🎧 <span>someone</span> in <span>Antarctica</span> will need about <span>3.500</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 just over <span>double</span>!<br/>
🎧 This <span>energy</span> is <span>provided</span> by <span>foods</span> which are high in <span>carbohydrate</span> and fat.<br/>
🎧 <span>Rations</span> for <span>fieldwork</span> <span>present</span> an <span>additional</span> <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 They need to <span>provide</span> <span>maximum</span> <span>energy</span>,<br/>
🎧 but they must also be <span>compact</span> and <span>light</span> for easy <span>transport</span>.<br/>
🎧 Special <span>boxes</span> are <span>prepared</span>,<br/>
🎧 each <span>containing</span> enough food for one person for <span>twenty</span> <span>days</span>.<br/>
🎧 You may be <span>familiar</span> with <span>coffee</span> <span>processed</span> by <span>freeze-drying</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>preserves</span> the <span>quality</span> of the food product while <span>making</span> a large <span>saving</span> in <span>weight</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 well, this <span>type</span> of <span>presentation</span> is <span>ideal</span> in our <span>situation</span>.<br/>
🎧 It wasn't <span>available</span> to <span>earlier</span> <span>polar</span> <span>explorers</span>,<br/>
🎧 whose <span>diet</span> was <span>commonly</span> <span>insufficient</span> for their <span>health</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think that being at the <span>cutting</span> <span>edge</span> of <span>science</span> has a special <span>appeal</span> for everyone working in <span>Antarctica</span>,<br/>
🎧 in whatever <span>capacity</span>.<br/>
🎧 As a <span>marine</span> <span>biologist</span>, my own <span>research</span> was <span>fascinating;<br/></span>
🎧 but it's <span>perhaps</span> <span>climate</span> change <span>research</span> that is the most <span>crucial</span> <span>field</span> of <span>study</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Within</span> this <span>general</span> <span>field</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>surveying</span> changes in the <span>volume</span> and <span>stability</span> of the <span>ice-cap</span> is <span>vital</span>,<br/>
🎧 since these may have <span>profound</span> <span>effects</span> on <span>world</span> sea <span>levels</span> and on <span>ocean</span> <span>currents</span>.<br/>
🎧 A second important <span>area</span> is <span>monitoring</span> the size of the <span>hole</span> in the <span>ozone</span> <span>layer</span> <span>above</span> <span>Antarctica</span>,<br/>
🎧 since this is an <span>indicator</span> of <span>global</span> <span>ultra-violet</span> <span>radiation</span> <span>levels</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Thirdly</span>, <span>bubbles</span> in the <span>ice-sheet</span> <span>itself</span> <span>provide</span> an <span>index</span> of <span>pollution<br/></span>
🎧 because <span>frozen</span> inside them are <span>samples</span> of <span>previous</span> <span>atmospheres</span> over the <span>past</span> <span>500,000</span> years,<br/>
🎧 and these <span>provide</span> us with <span>evidence</span> for the <span>effects</span> of such <span>human</span> <span>activities</span> as <span>agriculture</span> and <span>industry</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are an <span>increasing</span> number of <span>opportunities</span> for young people to work for a <span>period</span> in <span>Antarctica</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 not only as <span>research</span> <span>assistants</span> in <span>projects</span> like <span>mine</span>,<br/>
🎧 but also in a <span>wide</span> <span>range</span> of <span>junior</span> <span>administrative</span> and <span>technical</span> <span>positions<br/></span>
🎧 <span>including</span> <span>vacancies</span> for <span>map-makers</span>.<br/>
🎧 I hope that the <span>insights</span> I've <span>provided<br/></span>
🎧 will <span>encourage</span> you to take up these <span>opportunities</span> in this <span>fascinating</span> <span>continent</span>.<br/>
