🎧 Good morning, North College Library.<br/>
🎧 How can I help you?<br/>
🎧 I was wondering if it was possible to join the library.<br/>
🎧 Are you a student at North College?<br/>
🎧 No, I'm not, but someone told me it was possible to join, even if I wasn't.<br/>
🎧 That's right, it is.<br/>
🎧 Are you over 18?<br/>
🎧 That's our minimum joining age.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I am.<br/>
🎧 That's no problem then.<br/>
🎧 Could you tell me what I have to do to join?<br/>
🎧 Well, you'll need to come in to the library and fill out some forms.<br/>
🎧 You'll also need to bring two passport photos with you.<br/>
🎧 We also need two documents for ID, so a driving licence would be fine.<br/>
🎧 I've got that.<br/>
🎧 And what else? A credit card?<br/>
🎧 No, it needs to have your address on it.<br/>
🎧 Shall I bring a bank statement, would that do?<br/>
🎧 That'll be fine.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 Does it cost anything to join?<br/>
🎧 Well, it's free for students here but otherwise it's £125 per year<br/>
🎧 or £25 if you've got a current student card from another college.<br/>
🎧 I was at Westerley College until last year but...<br/>
🎧 now I've got a job at Jefferson's steel factory.<br/>
🎧 Er, it's more expensive than I thought.<br/>
🎧 My local library is free.<br/>
🎧 But you'll find they don't have the range of reference books or facilities which we buy for our students.<br/>
🎧 That's why you have to pay to be an external member.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 How many books can I borrow?<br/>
🎧 We allow twelve items borrowed at any one time if you're a student,<br/>
🎧 and that includes CDs, DVDs and videos.<br/>
🎧 However, it's only eight items for members of the public.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 And how long can I have them for?<br/>
🎧 Well, you can have both fiction and reference books for four weeks<br/>
🎧 which isn't bad really.<br/>
🎧 And what happens if I return them late?<br/>
🎧 Like all libraries, there's a fine system in place.<br/>
🎧 The minimum fine is £1.50<br/>
🎧 but it can be much higher for some items - up to £5 per week.<br/>
🎧 We'll give you a booklet with all the details when you join.<br/>
🎧 You can always renew items if they're not required by anyone else<br/>
🎧 by telephoning or logging on to our website.<br/>
🎧 What about the computers?<br/>
🎧 Can I use them free of charge?<br/>
🎧 For college students it's free, but for external members like yourself,<br/>
🎧 the first hour is free<br/>
🎧 and then we make a nominal charge of £1 per hour thereafter.<br/>
🎧 Do I have to book in advance for them?<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes, it's advisable.<br/>
🎧 Most people tend to book twenty-four hours in advance<br/>
🎧 although sometimes you can get one with only six hours' notice.<br/>
🎧 However, the earliest you can book a computer is forty-eight hours before you need it,<br/>
🎧 and you can only book one hour at a time.<br/>
🎧 If no-one else has booked the computer out,<br/>
🎧 then you may be able to have another hour if you want.<br/>
🎧 We have a wide range of databases,<br/>
🎧 so the computers are in great demand.<br/>
🎧 I'm thinking of doing some writing<br/>
🎧 and I might need to access national newspapers.<br/>
🎧 Do you have them on these databases?<br/>
🎧 We do indeed.<br/>
🎧 We've got all the big nationals, The Guardian and The Observer, The Independent...<br/>
🎧 and The Times and Sunday Times.<br/>
🎧 We've also got all the local papers<br/>
🎧 and a wide selection of magazines.<br/>
🎧 Excellent.<br/>
🎧 I assume you have photocopying facilities?<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 5p a sheet for both A4 and A3 black-and-white copies<br/>
🎧 and 40p a sheet for colour.<br/>
🎧 You can get a card from the counter here - it doesn't take coins.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Oh by the way, another thing I was wondering about was<br/>
🎧 if you ran any writing classes through the library?<br/>
🎧 We do, but you'll have to speak to John Grantingham about that.<br/>
🎧 He's our resident author.<br/>
🎧 He runs the creative writing classes.<br/>
🎧 John... Grant.... Could you spell that for me please?<br/>
🎧 Certainly.<br/>
🎧 GRANTINGHAM.<br/>
🎧 Are the classes here at the library?<br/>
🎧 Yes - he's here on Thursday evenings.<br/>
🎧 No, sorry, Friday - he's just changed it.<br/>
🎧 You can contact him by emailing the library.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Right, well that's about all I need to know.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 I'll be along later this week to join.<br/>
🎧 Thanks. Bye.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 My name's Dan Pearman<br/>
🎧 and I'd like to talk about the work of Pedal Power,<br/>
🎧 a small charity based mainly in the UK.<br/>
🎧 I'll be giving our contact details at the end,<br/>
🎧 if anyone would like to find out more about how to support us.<br/>
🎧 But first, how the charity began.<br/>
🎧 I got the idea of exporting bicycles to developing countries while I was in Ecuador.<br/>
🎧 I went there in 1993 just after graduating from university.<br/>
🎧 After three years of studying, I wanted adventure.<br/>
🎧 I loved travelling,<br/>
🎧 so I decided to join a voluntary organisation<br/>
🎧 and was sent to Ecuador to carry out land surveys.<br/>
🎧 The project came to an end after five years<br/>
🎧 and when I returned to the UK in 1998,<br/>
🎧 I started planning Pedal Power.<br/>
🎧 Where I lived in Ecuador was a very rural area.<br/>
🎧 My neighbour had the only bicycle in the village,<br/>
🎧 whereas everyone else walked everywhere.<br/>
🎧 My neighbour's business was unusually successful,<br/>
🎧 and for years I couldn't understand why.<br/>
🎧 Then I realised having a bike meant he could get where he wanted to go without much trouble.<br/>
🎧 Other local carpenters could only accept jobs in a 3 kilometre radius,<br/>
🎧 so no matter how skilled they were, they could never do as many jobs as my neighbour.<br/>
🎧 At Pedal Power, we collect second-hand bikes in the UK<br/>
🎧 and send them to some of the poorest regions in the world.<br/>
🎧 When we distribute bikes overseas, we don't give them away for free.<br/>
🎧 We'd like to, but long term that doesn't really help the local economy.<br/>
🎧 The demand for bikes is enormous, which makes them very expensive locally.<br/>
🎧 So we sell them for 5% of the normal price.<br/>
🎧 But in order to continue operating,<br/>
🎧 we need to have a constant supply of bikes which we send out every six months.<br/>
🎧 One example of a town that's received bicycles from Pedal Power is Rivas.<br/>
🎧 It was the first place I sent a full container of bicycles to.<br/>
🎧 Most people there now own a bicycle.<br/>
🎧 The local economy has developed so much,<br/>
🎧 you wouldn't recognise it as the same place.<br/>
🎧 In fact, there are more bikes than on the streets of Amsterdam, if you've ever been there.<br/>
🎧 But Pedal Power still needs your help.<br/>
🎧 You may have read about some of our recent problems in the British media.<br/>
🎧 In August 2000, we simply ran out of money.<br/>
🎧 We had containers of bikes ready to send,<br/>
🎧 but no money to pay the bills.<br/>
🎧 It was a terrible situation.<br/>
🎧 We managed to ensure the bikes went out on time,<br/>
🎧 but the other problems carried on for several months.<br/>
🎧 Fortunately, in October 2001,<br/>
🎧 we won an Enterprise Award which helped us enormously.<br/>
🎧 We invested 15 of the 75,000 pound prize money to help secure our future.<br/>
🎧 Winning the award helped raise our profile,<br/>
🎧 and the money enabled us to pay all our shipping costs,<br/>
🎧 which represent our greatest expense.<br/>
🎧 Pedal Power changes lives -<br/>
🎧 when someone gets a bicycle from us, they see a 14% increase in their income.<br/>
🎧 We're currently looking to invest in computers<br/>
🎧 so that our office staff can do an even better job.<br/>
🎧 Because of our work, people in a number of countries now have a better standard of living -<br/>
🎧 so far we've provided 46,000 people with bikes.<br/>
🎧 But we'd like to send more, at least 50,000 by the end of the year.<br/>
🎧 Now there are many ways in which you can support the work of Pedal Power,<br/>
🎧 not just by taking a bike to a collection in your area.<br/>
🎧 I should also like to say if you do have a bike to donate,<br/>
🎧 it doesn't matter what condition it's in.<br/>
🎧 If we can't repair it, we'll strip it down for spare parts.<br/>
🎧 Of course, to do that we always need tools, which are expensive to buy,<br/>
🎧 so we welcome any that you can give.<br/>
🎧 Also, you could help by contacting the voluntary staff at our offices,<br/>
🎧 they'll be able to suggest activities you could organise to bring in funds for us.<br/>
🎧 People do all kinds of things - including, of course, sponsored bike rides.<br/>
🎧 Also, we're always interested to hear of other places that would benefit from receiving a consignment of bikes,<br/>
🎧 and welcome suggestions from people who've been to developing regions on their travels.<br/>
🎧 We hope that by talking on radio programmes like this,<br/>
🎧 we will be able to raise public awareness,<br/>
🎧 which will lead to government organisations also giving us regular financial support,<br/>
🎧 something that we really need.<br/>
🎧 If you'd like some more information about where to donate an old bicycle<br/>
🎧 or offer help in other ways, please contact...<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 First of all I'd just like to say, Cristina and Ibrahim,<br/>
🎧 that I really enjoyed watching your video about student life last week,<br/>
🎧 and I could see that the rest of the group did too.<br/>
🎧 You did really well, and I hope that you got a lot out of it.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to use this tutorial as a feedback session,<br/>
🎧 where you reflect on the experience of doing the project.<br/>
🎧 So Cristina, I was wondering, what did you enjoy most about making the video?<br/>
🎧 I liked using the camera.<br/>
🎧 Is it the first time you've operated one like that?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it is.<br/>
🎧 Well the results were very good!<br/>
🎧 Anything else?<br/>
🎧 I also enjoyed visiting one of the British students we filmed.<br/>
🎧 I'd never been inside a British home before.<br/>
🎧 Okay Cristina, thanks.<br/>
🎧 What about you, Ibrahim?<br/>
🎧 What did you enjoy?<br/>
🎧 Well, for me it was a very good chance to get to know students who are on other courses,<br/>
🎧 because everyone in our group is studying English, and...<br/>
🎧 we don't usually have much to do with the rest of the college.<br/>
🎧 Yes, good.<br/>
🎧 Do you think you'll maintain the contact now?<br/>
🎧 I hope so.<br/>
🎧 I've invited three of them to have dinner with me next week.<br/>
🎧 Great!<br/>
🎧 If you haven't decided what to make yet, I can tell you they'll love trying Arab dishes.<br/>
🎧 And of course, it's good for your English too.<br/>
🎧 Cristina, what did you find?<br/>
🎧 What was the most useful aspect of the project from the point of view of the English practice?<br/>
🎧 I think, when we were being shown how to edit the film,<br/>
🎧 we had to follow the instructions.<br/>
🎧 And that was very good practice for me.<br/>
🎧 And I also learned some technical words that I hadn't heard before.<br/>
🎧 What about you Ibrahim?<br/>
🎧 What was the most useful for your English?<br/>
🎧 It was listening to the British students,<br/>
🎧 because they don't speak as slowly as most of the tutors on our course.<br/>
🎧 I think they speak at natural speed,<br/>
🎧 so it forces me to get used to it.<br/>
🎧 And they use a lot of slang.<br/>
🎧 So you learned some new words which will be useful?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 I'm glad it helped.<br/>
🎧 Well, we've talked a little bit about enjoyment, and about language practice.<br/>
🎧 Were there any other benefits?<br/>
🎧 What else did you feel you'd learnt from the project?<br/>
🎧 Was it useful in other ways?<br/>
🎧 Yes, well firstly, I learned how to use a video camera.<br/>
🎧 And also, I think I really learned a lot about working together with other people.<br/>
🎧 I've never done anything with a group before,<br/>
🎧 and we had to find ways of cooperating,<br/>
🎧 erm, and compromising,<br/>
🎧 and sometimes persuading people, when they don't agree with you.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that is a very useful experience, I know.<br/>
🎧 What about you, Ibrahim?<br/>
🎧 Well, I think I learnt a lot about how important editing is.<br/>
🎧 When you're filming, you think that everything's going to be interesting,<br/>
🎧 but in fact we cut around half of it in the end,<br/>
🎧 and then it was much better.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 Well, one last thing I'd like to ask.<br/>
🎧 What mistakes do you think you, as a group that is, made?<br/>
🎧 I mean, to put it another way, if you had to do it all over again,<br/>
🎧 is there anything you'd do differently?<br/>
🎧 We didn't plan very well.<br/>
🎧 For example, we didn't decide on dates when we'd complete each separate step of the project,<br/>
🎧 and we should have agreed about that in the beginning,<br/>
🎧 because we were always late with everything!<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Anything else?<br/>
🎧 I think we should have tried to experiment more with the camera.<br/>
🎧 I mean with angles, and the focus and that kind of thing.<br/>
🎧 So you should have been more ambitious?<br/>
🎧 Do you agree, Ibrahim?<br/>
🎧 Not really.<br/>
🎧 In fact, I think we were too ambitious.<br/>
🎧 We were inexperienced, and we didn't have a lot of time,<br/>
🎧 and we tried to do too much, to make a long film.<br/>
🎧 Next time I would make a shorter one and try to get the quality better.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's very interesting.<br/>
🎧 Next semester we will be doing another video project - with a different content, of course -<br/>
🎧 but you'll have an opportunity to put into practice what you've learnt this time.<br/>
🎧 Do you have any ideas about...<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Tonight I'm going to talk to you about that remarkable continent Antarctica -<br/>
🎧 remote, hostile and at present uninhabited on a permanent basis.<br/>
🎧 For early explorers, it was the ultimate survival contest;<br/>
🎧 for researchers like me, it remains a place of great intellectual challenge;<br/>
🎧 while for the modern tourist, it's simply a wilderness of great beauty.<br/>
🎧 First, some facts and figures.<br/>
🎧 Antarctica is a place of extremes<br/>
🎧 - the highest, coldest and windiest continent<br/>
🎧 and over 58 times the size of the UK.<br/>
🎧 The ice-cap contains almost 70% of the world's fresh water and 90% of its ice,<br/>
🎧 but with very low snowfall,<br/>
🎧 most of the continent technically falls unbelievably into the category of "desert"!<br/>
🎧 Huge icebergs break off the continent each year,<br/>
🎧 while in winter half the surrounding ocean freezes over,<br/>
🎧 which means its size almost doubles.<br/>
🎧 Research and exploration has been going on in Antarctica for more than 200 years,<br/>
🎧 and has involved scientists from many different countries,<br/>
🎧 who work together on research stations.<br/>
🎧 Here science and technical support have been integrated in a very cost-effective way -<br/>
🎧 our Antarctic research programme has several summers-only stations<br/>
🎧 and two all-year-round ones;<br/>
🎧 I was based on one of the all-year-round ones.<br/>
🎧 The research stations are really self-contained communities of about 20 people.<br/>
🎧 There's living and working space,<br/>
🎧 a kitchen with a huge food store,<br/>
🎧 a small hospital<br/>
🎧 and a well-equipped gym to ensure everyone keeps fit in their spare time.<br/>
🎧 The station generates its own electricity<br/>
🎧 and communicates with the outside world using a satellite link.<br/>
🎧 Our station - Zero One - had some special features.<br/>
🎧 It wasn't built on land but on an ice-shelf, hundreds of metres thick.<br/>
🎧 Supplies were brought to us on large sledges<br/>
🎧 from a ship 15 kilometres away at the ice edge.<br/>
🎧 Living in the Antarctic hasn't always been so comfortable.<br/>
🎧 Snow build-ups caused enormous problems for four previous stations on the same site,<br/>
🎧 which were buried and finally crushed by the weight.<br/>
🎧 Fortunately no one was hurt,<br/>
🎧 but these buildings became a huge challenge to architects<br/>
🎧 who finally came up with a remarkable solution -<br/>
🎧 the buildings are placed on platforms<br/>
🎧 which can be raised above the changing snow level on legs which are extendable.<br/>
🎧 Food is one of the most important aspects of survival in a polar climate.<br/>
🎧 People living there need to obtain a lot more energy from their food,<br/>
🎧 both to keep warm and to undertake heavy physical work.<br/>
🎧 Maybe you know that an adult in the UK<br/>
🎧 will probably need about 1,700 kilocalories a day on average;<br/>
🎧 someone in Antarctica will need about 3.500 -<br/>
🎧 just over double!<br/>
🎧 This energy is provided by foods which are high in carbohydrate and fat.<br/>
🎧 Rations for fieldwork present an additional problem.<br/>
🎧 They need to provide maximum energy,<br/>
🎧 but they must also be compact and light for easy transport.<br/>
🎧 Special boxes are prepared,<br/>
🎧 each containing enough food for one person for twenty days.<br/>
🎧 You may be familiar with coffee processed by freeze-drying,<br/>
🎧 which preserves the quality of the food product while making a large saving in weight -<br/>
🎧 well, this type of presentation is ideal in our situation.<br/>
🎧 It wasn't available to earlier polar explorers,<br/>
🎧 whose diet was commonly insufficient for their health.<br/>
🎧 I think that being at the cutting edge of science has a special appeal for everyone working in Antarctica,<br/>
🎧 in whatever capacity.<br/>
🎧 As a marine biologist, my own research was fascinating;<br/>
🎧 but it's perhaps climate change research that is the most crucial field of study.<br/>
🎧 Within this general field,<br/>
🎧 surveying changes in the volume and stability of the ice-cap is vital,<br/>
🎧 since these may have profound effects on world sea levels and on ocean currents.<br/>
🎧 A second important area is monitoring the size of the hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica,<br/>
🎧 since this is an indicator of global ultra-violet radiation levels.<br/>
🎧 Thirdly, bubbles in the ice-sheet itself provide an index of pollution<br/>
🎧 because frozen inside them are samples of previous atmospheres over the past 500,000 years,<br/>
🎧 and these provide us with evidence for the effects of such human activities as agriculture and industry.<br/>
🎧 There are an increasing number of opportunities for young people to work for a period in Antarctica -<br/>
🎧 not only as research assistants in projects like mine,<br/>
🎧 but also in a wide range of junior administrative and technical positions<br/>
🎧 including vacancies for map-makers.<br/>
🎧 I hope that the insights I've provided<br/>
🎧 will encourage you to take up these opportunities in this fascinating continent.<br/>
<br/><br/>
