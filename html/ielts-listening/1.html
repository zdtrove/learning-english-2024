🎧 Hello... <span>Flagstone</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh hello.<br/> 
🎧 Is that <span>Flagstone</span> <span>Properties</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yes that's right.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Flagstone</span> here. How can I help you?<br/> 
🎧 Hello.<br/> 
🎧 I'm <span>ringing</span> just to make <span>enquiries</span> about <span>renting</span> a <span>house</span>.<br/> 
🎧 My <span>name's</span> <span>Jon</span> <span>Anderson</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Yes, Mr <span>Anderson</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What <span>sort</span> of thing were you <span>looking</span> <span>for</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Umm</span>... <span>Two-bedroomed</span> house with garden.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Well</span>... yes, sir, that shouldn't be any <span>problem</span>...<br/> 
🎧 just to let you know that our <span>main</span> <span>areas</span>,<br/> 
🎧 the <span>main</span> <span>areas</span> we <span>deal</span> with are the <span>city</span> <span>centre</span> <span>itself</span>...<br/> 
🎧 <span>City</span> <span>centre</span>...<br/> 
🎧 And the <span>north</span> <span>suburbs</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh well...<br/> 
🎧 we were most interested in the <span>Northern</span> <span>areas</span> actually.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Right</span>... <span>yes</span>... What <span>sort</span> of <span>price</span> were you thinking <span>of</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Well</span>... <span>uh</span>... could you give me some <span>idea</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Certainly</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It really <span>ranges</span> from <span>£250</span> <span>per</span> <span>month</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Only <span>£250</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, to about <span>£500</span> <span>depending</span> on a <span>number</span> of different <span>factors</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, what does it <span>depend</span> <span>on</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Well, <span>obviously</span> the <span>quality</span> of the <span>area</span>.<br/> 
🎧 And then <span>whether</span> there's a garden.<br/> 
🎧 Well, as I said, we'd want a garden.<br/> 
🎧 And a <span>garage</span> <span>pushes</span> up the <span>price</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Right</span>...<br/> 
🎧 well, we wouldn't <span>necessarily</span> need one.<br/> 
🎧 I think about <span>£350</span> a <span>month</span> would be our <span>limit</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Okay.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Well</span>... would you like to have a look at a <span>couple</span> of <span>properties</span>, <span>sir</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, that'd be great.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Um</span>... <span>Looking</span> at our <span>files</span>... I think we've got two which might <span>suit</span> you...<br/> 
🎧 <span>Hang</span> on. I'll just get a <span>pen</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Right</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Okay. Well, there's one on <span>West</span> <span>Park</span> <span>Road</span><br/> 
🎧 which is <span>£325</span> a <span>month</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Are the <span>bills</span> <span>included</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Well, that one just <span>includes</span> the water <span>bill</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Okay, right.<br/> 
🎧 And the <span>second</span> house is in <span>Tithe</span> <span>Road</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'll just <span>spell</span> that for you, okay?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Yep</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>TITHE</span> <span>Road</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Got that.<br/> 
🎧 And how much is that one?<br/> 
🎧 That's <span>£380</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>380</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Uh... Is that <span>including</span> <span>water</span>?<br/> 
🎧 No, I'm <span>afraid</span> not, but it does <span>include</span> the <span>telephone</span> <span>rental</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh well, that's not too bad then.<br/> 
🎧 So, when would you be <span>available</span> to see them?<br/> 
🎧 Well, <span>uh</span>... I'll be in <span>town</span> next <span>week</span>... <span>say</span>... <span>Thursday</span>?<br/> 
🎧 No, I'm sorry we don't have any <span>availability</span> for <span>Thursday</span>.<br/> 
🎧 How about <span>Wednesday</span> <span>afternoon</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Okay. That's fine.<br/> 
🎧 Would <span>5</span> be okay?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, fine.<br/> 
🎧 <span>5</span> <span>o'clock</span> it <span>is</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Just come to the <span>Flagstone</span> <span>Offices</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, before I <span>forget</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What <span>sort</span> of things do I need to get <span>done</span>... to <span>rent</span> with you?<br/> 
🎧 Well, the most <span>important</span> thing is a <span>letter</span> from your <span>bank</span>...<br/> 
🎧 No <span>problem</span>...<br/> 
🎧 And then a <span>reference</span> <span>letter</span> from your <span>employer</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Yes, that's okay.<br/> 
🎧 Great, and then we would need you to give <span>2</span> <span>weeks'</span> <span>notice</span> of <span>moving</span> in...<br/> 
🎧 <span>Right</span>... <span>2</span> <span>weeks'</span> <span>notice</span>.<br/> 
🎧 And what about a <span>deposit</span>?<br/> 
🎧 That's one <span>month's</span> <span>rent</span>, whatever the <span>amount</span> <span>is</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Okay. One <span>month</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Is that <span>it</span>?<br/> 
🎧 No, sorry, one <span>more</span>...<br/> 
🎧 you will have to pay for the <span>contract</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh yes. I'd <span>forgotten</span> about that.<br/> 
🎧 Okay, fine.<br/> 
🎧 So I'll start <span>arranging</span> those.<br/> 
🎧 I'll see you next <span>week</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Yes. Thanks very much.<br/> 
🎧 Bye.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Goodbye

🎧 Hello, Mrs <span>Sutton</span>. Come in.<br/> 
🎧 How are you <span>settling</span> in next <span>door</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Have all your things from <span>Canada</span> <span>arrived</span> <span>yet</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I thought I saw a <span>removals</span> <span>van</span> outside your house <span>yesterday</span> <span>afternoon</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Yes. They came <span>yesterday</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We <span>spent</span> all day <span>yesterday</span> <span>arranging</span> them.<br/> 
🎧 It's <span>beginning</span> to feel a bit more like home now.<br/> 
🎧 Oh that's good.<br/> 
🎧 Look, come in and sit <span>down</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Are you alright?<br/> 
🎧 You look a bit <span>worried</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Well, I am a <span>bit</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'm sorry to <span>bother</span> you so <span>early</span>, Mrs Smith, <span>but</span><br/> 
🎧 I <span>wonder</span> if you could help me.<br/> 
🎧 Could you tell me how I can get <span>hold</span> of a <span>doctor</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Our <span>daughter</span>, Anna, isn't very well this morning <span>and</span>...<br/> 
🎧 I may have to call <span>somebody</span> out.<br/> 
🎧 She <span>keeps</span> being <span>sick</span> and I am <span>beginning</span> to get a bit <span>worried</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I just don't know how the <span>health</span> <span>system</span> <span>works</span> here in <span>England</span>.<br/> 
🎧 All I know is that it's very different from <span>ours</span> back in <span>Canada</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Well, I don't know really where to <span>start</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Let me <span>think</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Well, the first thing you have to do is find a <span>family</span> <span>doctor</span> <span>-</span><br/> 
🎧 sometimes we call them <span>general</span> <span>practitioners</span> as well <span>-</span><br/> 
🎧 and <span>register</span> with him or <span>her</span>.<br/> 
🎧 If you live here, you've got to be on a <span>doctor's</span> <span>list</span>.<br/> 
🎧 If you're not, things can be a bit <span>difficult</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Nobody</span> will come out to you if you're not <span>registered</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, they work in things called <span>practices</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Sort</span> of small <span>groups</span> of <span>family</span> <span>doctors</span> all working together in the same <span>building</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Now what you've got to do this morning is <span>register</span> with one of them.<br/> 
🎧 There are two <span>practices</span> near here,<br/> 
🎧 so we're quite well off for <span>doctors</span> in this <span>part</span> of <span>Manchester</span>.<br/> 
🎧 There's the <span>Dean</span> End <span>Health</span> <span>Centre</span> about ten <span>minutes'</span> <span>walk</span> <span>away</span><br/> 
🎧 and there's another <span>practice</span> in <span>South</span> <span>Hay</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That's about <span>five</span> <span>minutes</span> away going <span>towards</span> the <span>town</span> <span>centre</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We're <span>registered</span> at the <span>Dean</span> End one,<br/> 
🎧 but they're both okay.<br/> 
🎧 There are about six <span>doctors</span> in our <span>practice</span> and <span>four</span> in the <span>other</span>.<br/> 
🎧 So <span>ours</span> is quite big in <span>comparison</span>.<br/> 
🎧 And the <span>building</span> and <span>everything's</span> a bit more <span>modern</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>South</span> <span>Hay</span> is a bit <span>old-fashioned</span> but the <span>doctors</span> are okay.<br/> 
🎧 Their only <span>problem</span> is that they don't have a <span>proper</span> <span>appointment</span> <span>system</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Sometimes you have to wait for <span>ages</span> there to see someone.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, you go to the <span>receptionist</span> in <span>whichever</span> <span>health</span> <span>centre</span><br/> 
🎧 and ask her to <span>register</span> you with a <span>doctor</span> there.<br/> 
🎧 You have to <span>fill</span> in a <span>form</span>, but it doesn't take long.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Ours</span> is called <span>Dr</span> <span>Jones</span><br/> 
🎧 and we've been going to him for years <span>-</span><br/> 
🎧 ever since we <span>moved</span> here <span>fifteen</span> years <span>ago</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I wouldn't say he's <span>brilliant</span> but I <span>suppose</span> he's alright <span>really</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We're used to him now.<br/> 
🎧 They say he's very good with <span>elderly</span> <span>people</span>,<br/> 
🎧 but he does <span>tend</span> to get a bit <span>impatient</span> with <span>children</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Listen, the one who's <span>supposed</span> to be really good with small <span>children</span> is <span>Dr</span> <span>Shaw</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I've <span>heard</span> lots of people say that.<br/> 
🎧 She's young and she's got small <span>children</span> of her <span>own</span>.<br/> 
🎧 So you could try <span>registering</span> with <span>her</span>.<br/> 
🎧 And if her <span>list's</span> <span>full</span>,<br/> 
🎧 I <span>heard</span> <span>somebody</span> say the other day that there's a really nice young <span>doctor</span> at <span>South</span> <span>Hay</span>,<br/> 
🎧 a <span>Dr</span> <span>Williams</span>.<br/> 
🎧 He <span>holds</span> special <span>clinics</span> for people with back <span>trouble</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But that's not really your <span>problem</span>, is <span>it</span>?<br/> 
🎧 If you want a <span>doctor</span> to visit you at home,<br/> 
🎧 you have to ask for a home <span>visit</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You're <span>supposed</span> to do that before <span>10.30</span> in the <span>morning</span>,<br/> 
🎧 but <span>obviously</span>, if it's an <span>emergency</span>, you can phone at any time, <span>night</span> or day.<br/> 
🎧 It might not be your <span>doctor</span> that comes, <span>though</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's quite often one of the other <span>doctors</span> in the <span>practice</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It doesn't really <span>seem</span> to make much <span>difference</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Otherwise</span> you make an <span>appointment</span> to see your <span>doctor</span> at the <span>health</span> <span>centre</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You usually get <span>seen</span> the same day.<br/> 
🎧 Not always of course, but usually, as I <span>say</span>.<br/> 
🎧 They <span>hold</span> <span>surgeries</span> between <span>9</span> and <span>11.30</span> every <span>weekday</span>,<br/> 
🎧 and from <span>4</span> to <span>6.30</span> <span>Monday</span> to <span>Thursday</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Saturdays</span> are only for <span>emergencies</span>.<br/> 
🎧 When the <span>doctor</span> <span>sees</span> you, he <span>gives</span> you a <span>prescription</span>.<br/> 
🎧 He <span>writes</span> what <span>medication</span> you need on it and you take it to a <span>chemist's</span> <span>shop</span>.<br/> 
🎧 There's one <span>opposite</span> the <span>centre</span>.<br/> 
🎧 If it's for a <span>child</span> under <span>16</span>, you don't have to <span>pay</span>.<br/> 
🎧 So if it's for Anna, there's no <span>problem</span>.<br/> 
🎧 The same thing <span>goes</span> if you're <span>unemployed</span> or <span>retired</span>, or if you're <span>pregnant</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Just as well because it's not <span>cheap</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You pay the same <span>price</span> for each <span>item</span> the <span>doctor</span> has <span>prescribed</span>.<br/> 
🎧 At the <span>moment</span> it's something like <span>£5</span> <span>per</span> <span>item</span>.<br/> 
🎧 So you pay for the <span>medication</span> but the <span>consultation</span> with the <span>doctor</span> doesn't <span>cost</span> you <span>anything</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's <span>completely</span> free as long as you're a <span>resident</span> here.<br/> 
🎧 You're going to be here for <span>three</span> years, aren't you?<br/> 
🎧 So there shouldn't be any <span>question</span> of you <span>paying</span> anything to see the <span>doctor</span>.<br/> 
🎧 So that's one less <span>problem</span> to <span>worry</span> <span>about</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Look, Mrs <span>Sutton</span>. If you want,<br/> 
🎧 I'll sit with your <span>daughter</span> for <span>half</span> an <span>hour</span> if you want to go down to the <span>health</span> <span>centre</span> to <span>register</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's no <span>trouble</span> really, don't <span>worry</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Are you sure you wouldn't <span>mind</span>?<br/> 
🎧 That would really help me a lot.<br/> 
🎧 I'll ask them if they can <span>send</span> someone <span>round</span> later to see Anna.<br/> 
🎧 I think I'll try the <span>Dean</span> End <span>Centre</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Good <span>idea</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Don't <span>worry</span> about Anna.<br/> 
🎧 Right. I'll be back as soon as I <span>can
</span>.<br/><br/><br/>

🎧 Hello. <span>Jonathan</span> <span>Briggs</span>, isn't <span>it</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, that's right.<br/> 
🎧 Do come in and sit <span>down</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Thanks</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Right</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Well, <span>Jonathan</span>, as we <span>explained</span> in your <span>letter</span>,<br/> 
🎧 in this <span>part</span> of the <span>interview</span>, we like to talk through your <span>application</span> <span>form</span>...<br/> 
🎧 your <span>experience</span> to <span>date</span>, <span>etc</span>....<br/> 
🎧 and then in the <span>second</span> <span>part</span>,<br/> 
🎧 you go for a <span>group</span> <span>interview</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Group</span> <span>interview</span>... yes, I <span>understand</span>...<br/> 
🎧 So... your first <span>degree</span> was in <span>Economics</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, but I also did <span>Politics</span> as a <span>major</span> <span>strand</span>.<br/> 
🎧 And you <span>graduated</span> in <span>1989</span>.<br/> 
🎧 And I see you have been doing some <span>teaching</span>...<br/> 
🎧 Yes. I <span>worked</span> as a <span>volunteer</span> <span>teacher</span> in <span>West</span> <span>Africa</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I was there for almost <span>three</span> years in <span>total</span> <span>from</span>....<br/> 
🎧 <span>1990</span> to... <span>1992</span>.<br/> 
🎧 How <span>interesting</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What <span>organisation</span> was that <span>with</span>?<br/> 
🎧 It's not one of the <span>major</span> <span>ones</span>. It's called <span>Teach</span> <span>South</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, right.<br/> 
🎧 Yes, I have <span>heard</span> of <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It <span>operates</span> in <span>several</span> <span>African</span> <span>countries</span>, doesn't <span>it</span>?<br/> 
🎧 And what kind of school was <span>it</span>?<br/> 
🎧 A <span>rural</span> <span>co-operative</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, a <span>rural</span> <span>co-operative</span>, how <span>interesting</span>...<br/> 
🎧 and what did you <span>teach</span>?<br/> 
🎧 A <span>variety</span> of things in different <span>years</span>...<br/> 
🎧 I <span>did</span>... with <span>Forms</span> <span>1</span> to <span>3</span> <span>mainly</span> <span>Geography</span><br/> 
🎧 and some English with <span>Form</span> <span>5</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Then in my <span>final</span> <span>year</span>,<br/> 
🎧 I took on some <span>Agricultural</span> <span>Science</span> with the top <span>year</span>...<br/> 
🎧 that's <span>Form</span> <span>6</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Right. Quite a <span>variety</span> then...<br/> 
🎧 I also ran the school <span>farm</span>.<br/> 
🎧 How <span>interesting</span>...<br/> 
🎧 And how did you find the whole <span>experience</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I'll be <span>honest</span> with you.<br/> 
🎧 At the end of the first year I really wanted to leave and come home.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, why was that?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Well</span>... I was very <span>homesick</span> at first and <span>missed</span> my <span>family</span>...<br/> 
🎧 Yes, I can <span>understand</span> that.<br/> 
🎧 and I also <span>found</span> it <span>frustrating</span> to have so few <span>teaching</span> <span>resources</span>,<br/> 
🎧 but I did decide to <span>stay</span><br/> 
🎧 and in the end I <span>extended</span> my <span>tour</span> to a <span>third</span> <span>year</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Right</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Things must have <span>looked</span> up then?<br/> 
🎧 Yes. We set up a very <span>successful</span> <span>project</span> <span>breeding</span> <span>cattle</span> to sell <span>locally</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Really</span>?<br/> 
🎧 And then after a lot of <span>hard</span> work we <span>finally</span> got <span>funds</span> for new <span>farm</span> <span>buildings</span>.<br/> 
🎧 And you wanted to see things <span>through</span>?<br/> 
🎧 And that's why you want to <span>train</span> to <span>teach</span> <span>Geography</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Yes</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I've had a <span>couple</span> of <span>jobs</span> since then<br/> 
🎧 but I now <span>realise</span> I like <span>teaching</span> <span>best</span>.<br/> 
🎧 And I <span>chose</span> <span>Geography</span> <span>because</span>...<br/> 
🎧 because it is my <span>favourite</span> <span>subject</span>...<br/> 
🎧 and also because I think it has so many <span>useful</span> <span>applications</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Well</span>... you <span>certainly</span> have had some <span>interesting</span> work <span>experience</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'll ask you now to go on to the next <span>stage..
</span>.<br/><br/><br/>

🎧 <span>Today's</span> <span>Health</span> <span>Counsel</span> is <span>presented</span> by <span>Paula</span> <span>Clayburg</span>,<br/> 
🎧 who is the <span>chief</span> <span>Counsellor</span> at <span>Liverpool's</span> famous <span>pain</span> <span>clinic:</span><br/> 
🎧 The <span>Wilton</span> <span>Clinic</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Paula</span>...<br/> 
🎧 Do you know what <span>Prince</span> <span>Charles</span>, <span>Seve</span> <span>Ballesteros</span> and <span>Elizabeth</span> <span>Taylor</span> have in <span>common</span>?<br/> 
🎧 They all <span>suffer</span> from <span>chronic</span> back <span>pain</span>.<br/> 
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, bad <span>backs</span> are one of the most <span>common</span> <span>health</span> <span>problems</span> today,<br/> 
🎧 <span>affecting</span> people in all <span>walks</span> of <span>life</span>.<br/> 
🎧 The most <span>recent</span> <span>available</span> <span>figures</span> <span>show</span> that about a <span>quarter</span> of a <span>million</span> <span>people</span><br/> 
🎧 are <span>incapacitated</span> with back <span>pain</span> every day.<br/> 
🎧 And many <span>sufferers</span> don't know the <span>cause</span> or the <span>solution</span> to their <span>problem</span>.<br/> 
🎧 The <span>majority</span> of our <span>patients</span> at the <span>clinic</span> <span>tend</span> to be <span>women</span>.<br/> 
🎧 They are <span>especially</span> <span>vulnerable</span> because of <span>pregnancy</span><br/> 
🎧 but also because of <span>osteoporosis</span>,<br/> 
🎧 which I <span>personally</span> <span>believe</span> to be the <span>major</span> <span>cause</span> of <span>problems</span> for <span>women</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I have many <span>women</span> <span>patients</span> who say they have <span>completely</span> <span>given</span> up <span>exercise</span><br/> 
🎧 because the <span>pain</span> makes them so <span>miserable</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But of course that <span>starts</span> up a <span>vicious</span> <span>circle</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Bed <span>rest</span>, <span>giving</span> up <span>exercise</span> and <span>pain</span> <span>killers</span> are <span>traditional</span> <span>responses</span> to back <span>pain</span><br/> 
🎧 but, although there are many <span>excellent</span> <span>drugs</span> on the <span>market</span>,<br/> 
🎧 at our <span>clinic</span> we are <span>beginning</span> to <span>realise</span> the <span>unique</span> <span>benefits</span> of <span>relaxation</span> <span>therapy</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Other <span>specialists</span> in the <span>field</span> make a <span>strong</span> case for <span>certain</span> <span>types</span> of <span>exercise</span>,<br/> 
🎧 but in our <span>experience</span> they are <span>easily</span> <span>mishandled</span><br/> 
🎧 and can <span>lead</span> to more <span>harm</span> than good.<br/> 
🎧 Now, let's look at some of the <span>reasons</span> why back <span>pain</span> is <span>developing</span> into such a <span>unique</span> <span>menace</span>.<br/> 
🎧 In <span>general</span>, the <span>body</span> is <span>pretty</span> good at <span>self-repair</span>.<br/> 
🎧 A <span>strain</span> or a <span>blow</span> to a <span>limb</span>, though <span>painful</span> at the time, <span>generally</span> <span>resolves</span> <span>itself</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But the <span>body's</span> <span>response</span> to back <span>injury</span> can be very <span>counter-productive</span>.<br/> 
🎧 When <span>pain</span> <span>strikes</span>,<br/> 
🎧 we <span>attempt</span> to keep the back as <span>immobile</span> as <span>possible</span>,<br/> 
🎧 which makes the <span>muscles</span> <span>tense</span> up.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Research</span> <span>shows</span> that they often go into <span>spasm</span>,<br/> 
🎧 which <span>causes</span> <span>further</span> <span>twisting</span> of the <span>spine</span>.<br/> 
🎧 A <span>vicious</span> <span>circle</span> is <span>underway</span>.<br/> 
🎧 The <span>second</span> <span>mistake</span> we often make when <span>stricken</span> with <span>extreme</span> back <span>pain</span><br/> 
🎧 is to go to bed and <span>stay</span> there.<br/> 
🎧 Although at the <span>clinic</span>, we <span>recognise</span> that a short <span>rest</span> in bed can be <span>helpful</span>...<br/> 
🎧 up to two <span>days</span>...<br/> 
🎧 any <span>longer</span> makes our back <span>muscles</span> become <span>weaker</span> and <span>unable</span> to <span>hold</span> up our <span>spine</span>.<br/> 
🎧 The <span>pain</span> <span>therefore</span> <span>becomes</span> <span>worse</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Another <span>problem</span> is being <span>overweight</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Anyone</span> a <span>stone</span> or more <span>over-weight</span><br/> 
🎧 who already has back <span>pain</span> is not doing <span>himself</span> any <span>favours:</span><br/> 
🎧 though it won't actually set it off in the first <span>place</span>,<br/> 
🎧 the <span>weight</span> will <span>increase</span> the <span>strain</span> and make things <span>worse</span>.<br/> 
🎧 The <span>British</span> <span>diet</span> could be <span>partially</span> to <span>blame</span> for the <span>increase</span> in back <span>pain:</span><br/> 
🎧 over the last ten years the <span>average</span> <span>weight</span> of men has <span>risen</span> by <span>11</span> <span>lbs</span><br/> 
🎧 and of <span>women</span> by <span>9</span> <span>lbs</span>.<br/> 
🎧 So much for the <span>causes</span> and <span>aggravations</span> of <span>pain</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But what can we do to help?<br/> 
🎧 There are many <span>ways</span> in which simple <span>day-to-day</span> <span>care</span> can make all the <span>difference</span>.<br/> 
🎧 The first <span>point</span> to <span>watch</span> of course is <span>weight</span>.<br/> 
🎧 If you are <span>overweight</span>, a <span>diet</span> will make all the <span>difference</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Also, <span>studies</span> have <span>shown</span> that just one <span>hour</span> <span>sitting</span> in a <span>slouched</span> <span>position</span><br/> 
🎧 can <span>strain</span> <span>ligaments</span> in the back which can take <span>months</span> to <span>heal</span>.<br/> 
🎧 At the <span>clinic</span>, we have come to the <span>conclusion</span><br/> 
🎧 that the <span>major</span> <span>cause</span> of the <span>problem</span> is not with the <span>design</span> of <span>chairs</span>, as some have <span>suggested</span>,<br/> 
🎧 but in the way we sit in them.<br/> 
🎧 It can be <span>useful</span> to get special <span>orthopaedic</span> <span>chairs</span>,<br/> 
🎧 but <span>remember</span> the most <span>important</span> <span>improvement</span> should be in our <span>posture</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Another <span>enemy</span> of your back is, of course, your <span>beds</span>.<br/> 
🎧 If your bed doesn't give enough <span>support</span>,<br/> 
🎧 back <span>muscles</span> and <span>ligaments</span> work all <span>night</span> trying to <span>correct</span> <span>spinal</span> <span>alignment</span>,<br/> 
🎧 so you <span>wake</span> up with a <span>tired</span> <span>aching</span> <span>back</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Try out an <span>orthopaedic</span> <span>mattress</span> or a <span>spring</span> <span>slatted</span> <span>bed</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Research</span> <span>shows</span> that both can be <span>beneficial</span> for <span>certain</span> <span>types</span> of back <span>pain</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Another <span>hazard</span> for your back are the <span>shock</span> <span>waves</span> which travel up your <span>spine</span> when you <span>walk</span>,<br/> 
🎧 <span>known</span> as <span>heel</span> <span>strike</span>.<br/> 
🎧 A <span>real</span> find for our <span>patients</span> has been the <span>shock-absorbing</span> <span>shoe</span> <span>insert</span>.<br/> 
🎧 A <span>cheap</span> but very <span>effective</span> <span>solution</span>.<br/> 
🎧 And you might be better off <span>avoiding</span> <span>shoes</span> with <span>heels</span> <span>higher</span> than one and a <span>half</span> <span>inches</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Though absolutely <span>flat</span> <span>shoes</span> can be a <span>solution</span> for <span>some</span>,<br/> 
🎧 <span>others</span> find their <span>posture</span> <span>suffers</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Finally</span>, a <span>word</span> about the <span>state-of-the-art</span> <span>relief</span> <span>-</span> the <span>TENS</span> <span>machine</span> <span>-</span><br/> 
🎧 a small <span>battery-powered</span> <span>gadget</span><br/> 
🎧 which <span>delivers</span> <span>subliminal</span> <span>electrical</span> <span>pulses</span> to the <span>skin</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Our <span>experience</span> <span>indicates</span> that your money is better <span>spent</span> on the more <span>old-fashioned</span> <span>remedies
</span>.<br/><br/><br/>
