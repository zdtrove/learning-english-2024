🎧 Hello... Flagstone.<br/> 
🎧 Oh hello.<br/> 
🎧 Is that Flagstone Properties?<br/> 
🎧 Yes that's right.<br/> 
🎧 Flagstone here. How can I help you?<br/> 
🎧 Hello.<br/> 
🎧 I'm ringing just to make enquiries about renting a house.<br/> 
🎧 My name's Jon Anderson.<br/> 
🎧 Yes, Mr Anderson.<br/> 
🎧 What sort of thing were you looking for?<br/> 
🎧 Umm... Two-bedroomed house with garden.<br/> 
🎧 Well... yes, sir, that shouldn't be any problem...<br/> 
🎧 just to let you know that our main areas,<br/> 
🎧 the main areas we deal with are the city centre itself...<br/> 
🎧 City centre...<br/> 
🎧 And the north suburbs.<br/> 
🎧 Oh well...<br/> 
🎧 we were most interested in the Northern areas actually.<br/> 
🎧 Right... yes... What sort of price were you thinking of?<br/> 
🎧 Well... uh... could you give me some idea?<br/> 
🎧 Certainly.<br/> 
🎧 It really ranges from £250 per month.<br/> 
🎧 Only £250?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, to about £500 depending on a number of different factors.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, what does it depend on?<br/> 
🎧 Well, obviously the quality of the area.<br/> 
🎧 And then whether there's a garden.<br/> 
🎧 Well, as I said, we'd want a garden.<br/> 
🎧 And a garage pushes up the price.<br/> 
🎧 Right...<br/> 
🎧 well, we wouldn't necessarily need one.<br/> 
🎧 I think about £350 a month would be our limit.<br/> 
🎧 Okay.<br/> 
🎧 Well... would you like to have a look at a couple of properties, sir?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, that'd be great.<br/> 
🎧 Um... Looking at our files... I think we've got two which might suit you...<br/> 
🎧 Hang on. I'll just get a pen.<br/> 
🎧 Right.<br/> 
🎧 Okay. Well, there's one on West Park Road<br/> 
🎧 which is £325 a month.<br/> 
🎧 Are the bills included?<br/> 
🎧 Well, that one just includes the water bill.<br/> 
🎧 Okay, right.<br/> 
🎧 And the second house is in Tithe Road.<br/> 
🎧 I'll just spell that for you, okay?<br/> 
🎧 Yep.<br/> 
🎧 TITHE Road.<br/> 
🎧 Got that.<br/> 
🎧 And how much is that one?<br/> 
🎧 That's £380.<br/> 
🎧 380.<br/> 
🎧 Uh... Is that including water?<br/> 
🎧 No, I'm afraid not, but it does include the telephone rental.<br/> 
🎧 Oh well, that's not too bad then.<br/> 
🎧 So, when would you be available to see them?<br/> 
🎧 Well, uh... I'll be in town next week... say... Thursday?<br/> 
🎧 No, I'm sorry we don't have any availability for Thursday.<br/> 
🎧 How about Wednesday afternoon?<br/> 
🎧 Okay. That's fine.<br/> 
🎧 Would 5 be okay?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, fine.<br/> 
🎧 5 o'clock it is.<br/> 
🎧 Just come to the Flagstone Offices.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, before I forget.<br/> 
🎧 What sort of things do I need to get done... to rent with you?<br/> 
🎧 Well, the most important thing is a letter from your bank...<br/> 
🎧 No problem...<br/> 
🎧 And then a reference letter from your employer.<br/> 
🎧 Yes, that's okay.<br/> 
🎧 Great, and then we would need you to give 2 weeks' notice of moving in...<br/> 
🎧 Right... 2 weeks' notice.<br/> 
🎧 And what about a deposit?<br/> 
🎧 That's one month's rent, whatever the amount is.<br/> 
🎧 Okay. One month.<br/> 
🎧 Is that it?<br/> 
🎧 No, sorry, one more...<br/> 
🎧 you will have to pay for the contract.<br/> 
🎧 Oh yes. I'd forgotten about that.<br/> 
🎧 Okay, fine.<br/> 
🎧 So I'll start arranging those.<br/> 
🎧 I'll see you next week.<br/> 
🎧 Yes. Thanks very much.<br/> 
🎧 Bye.<br/> 
🎧 Goodbye.<br/><br/>

🎧 Hello, Mrs Sutton. Come in.<br/> 
🎧 How are you settling in next door?<br/> 
🎧 Have all your things from Canada arrived yet?<br/> 
🎧 I thought I saw a removals van outside your house yesterday afternoon.<br/> 
🎧 Yes. They came yesterday.<br/> 
🎧 We spent all day yesterday arranging them.<br/> 
🎧 It's beginning to feel a bit more like home now.<br/> 
🎧 Oh that's good.<br/> 
🎧 Look, come in and sit down.<br/> 
🎧 Are you alright?<br/> 
🎧 You look a bit worried.<br/> 
🎧 Well, I am a bit.<br/> 
🎧 I'm sorry to bother you so early, Mrs Smith, but<br/> 
🎧 I wonder if you could help me.<br/> 
🎧 Could you tell me how I can get hold of a doctor?<br/> 
🎧 Our daughter, Anna, isn't very well this morning and...<br/> 
🎧 I may have to call somebody out.<br/> 
🎧 She keeps being sick and I am beginning to get a bit worried.<br/> 
🎧 I just don't know how the health system works here in England.<br/> 
🎧 All I know is that it's very different from ours back in Canada.<br/> 
🎧 Well, I don't know really where to start.<br/> 
🎧 Let me think.<br/> 
🎧 Well, the first thing you have to do is find a family doctor -<br/> 
🎧 sometimes we call them general practitioners as well -<br/> 
🎧 and register with him or her.<br/> 
🎧 If you live here, you've got to be on a doctor's list.<br/> 
🎧 If you're not, things can be a bit difficult.<br/> 
🎧 Nobody will come out to you if you're not registered.<br/> 
🎧 Anyway, they work in things called practices.<br/> 
🎧 Sort of small groups of family doctors all working together in the same building.<br/> 
🎧 Now what you've got to do this morning is register with one of them.<br/> 
🎧 There are two practices near here,<br/> 
🎧 so we're quite well off for doctors in this part of Manchester.<br/> 
🎧 There's the Dean End Health Centre about ten minutes' walk away<br/> 
🎧 and there's another practice in South Hay.<br/> 
🎧 That's about five minutes away going towards the town centre.<br/> 
🎧 We're registered at the Dean End one,<br/> 
🎧 but they're both okay.<br/> 
🎧 There are about six doctors in our practice and four in the other.<br/> 
🎧 So ours is quite big in comparison.<br/> 
🎧 And the building and everything's a bit more modern.<br/> 
🎧 South Hay is a bit old-fashioned but the doctors are okay.<br/> 
🎧 Their only problem is that they don't have a proper appointment system.<br/> 
🎧 Sometimes you have to wait for ages there to see someone.<br/> 
🎧 Anyway, you go to the receptionist in whichever health centre<br/> 
🎧 and ask her to register you with a doctor there.<br/> 
🎧 You have to fill in a form, but it doesn't take long.<br/> 
🎧 Ours is called Dr Jones<br/> 
🎧 and we've been going to him for years -<br/> 
🎧 ever since we moved here fifteen years ago.<br/> 
🎧 I wouldn't say he's brilliant but I suppose he's alright really.<br/> 
🎧 We're used to him now.<br/> 
🎧 They say he's very good with elderly people,<br/> 
🎧 but he does tend to get a bit impatient with children.<br/> 
🎧 Listen, the one who's supposed to be really good with small children is Dr Shaw.<br/> 
🎧 I've heard lots of people say that.<br/> 
🎧 She's young and she's got small children of her own.<br/> 
🎧 So you could try registering with her.<br/> 
🎧 And if her list's full,<br/> 
🎧 I heard somebody say the other day that there's a really nice young doctor at South Hay,<br/> 
🎧 a Dr Williams.<br/> 
🎧 He holds special clinics for people with back trouble.<br/> 
🎧 But that's not really your problem, is it?<br/> 
🎧 If you want a doctor to visit you at home,<br/> 
🎧 you have to ask for a home visit.<br/> 
🎧 You're supposed to do that before 10.30 in the morning,<br/> 
🎧 but obviously, if it's an emergency, you can phone at any time, night or day.<br/> 
🎧 It might not be your doctor that comes, though.<br/> 
🎧 It's quite often one of the other doctors in the practice.<br/> 
🎧 It doesn't really seem to make much difference.<br/> 
🎧 Otherwise you make an appointment to see your doctor at the health centre.<br/> 
🎧 You usually get seen the same day.<br/> 
🎧 Not always of course, but usually, as I say.<br/> 
🎧 They hold surgeries between 9 and 11.30 every weekday,<br/> 
🎧 and from 4 to 6.30 Monday to Thursday.<br/> 
🎧 Saturdays are only for emergencies.<br/> 
🎧 When the doctor sees you, he gives you a prescription.<br/> 
🎧 He writes what medication you need on it and you take it to a chemist's shop.<br/> 
🎧 There's one opposite the centre.<br/> 
🎧 If it's for a child under 16, you don't have to pay.<br/> 
🎧 So if it's for Anna, there's no problem.<br/> 
🎧 The same thing goes if you're unemployed or retired, or if you're pregnant.<br/> 
🎧 Just as well because it's not cheap.<br/> 
🎧 You pay the same price for each item the doctor has prescribed.<br/> 
🎧 At the moment it's something like £5 per item.<br/> 
🎧 So you pay for the medication but the consultation with the doctor doesn't cost you anything.<br/> 
🎧 It's completely free as long as you're a resident here.<br/> 
🎧 You're going to be here for three years, aren't you?<br/> 
🎧 So there shouldn't be any question of you paying anything to see the doctor.<br/> 
🎧 So that's one less problem to worry about.<br/> 
🎧 Look, Mrs Sutton. If you want,<br/> 
🎧 I'll sit with your daughter for half an hour if you want to go down to the health centre to register.<br/> 
🎧 It's no trouble really, don't worry.<br/> 
🎧 Are you sure you wouldn't mind?<br/> 
🎧 That would really help me a lot.<br/> 
🎧 I'll ask them if they can send someone round later to see Anna.<br/> 
🎧 I think I'll try the Dean End Centre.<br/> 
🎧 Good idea.<br/> 
🎧 Don't worry about Anna.<br/> 
🎧 Right. I'll be back as soon as I can.<br/><br/>

🎧 Hello. Jonathan Briggs, isn't it?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, that's right.<br/> 
🎧 Do come in and sit down.<br/> 
🎧 Thanks.<br/> 
🎧 Right.<br/> 
🎧 Well, Jonathan, as we explained in your letter,<br/> 
🎧 in this part of the interview, we like to talk through your application form...<br/> 
🎧 your experience to date, etc....<br/> 
🎧 and then in the second part,<br/> 
🎧 you go for a group interview.<br/> 
🎧 Group interview... yes, I understand...<br/> 
🎧 So... your first degree was in Economics?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, but I also did Politics as a major strand.<br/> 
🎧 And you graduated in 1989.<br/> 
🎧 And I see you have been doing some teaching...<br/> 
🎧 Yes. I worked as a volunteer teacher in West Africa.<br/> 
🎧 I was there for almost three years in total from....<br/> 
🎧 1990 to... 1992.<br/> 
🎧 How interesting.<br/> 
🎧 What organisation was that with?<br/> 
🎧 It's not one of the major ones. It's called Teach South.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, right.<br/> 
🎧 Yes, I have heard of it.<br/> 
🎧 It operates in several African countries, doesn't it?<br/> 
🎧 And what kind of school was it?<br/> 
🎧 A rural co-operative.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, a rural co-operative, how interesting...<br/> 
🎧 and what did you teach?<br/> 
🎧 A variety of things in different years...<br/> 
🎧 I did... with Forms 1 to 3 mainly Geography<br/> 
🎧 and some English with Form 5.<br/> 
🎧 Then in my final year,<br/> 
🎧 I took on some Agricultural Science with the top year...<br/> 
🎧 that's Form 6.<br/> 
🎧 Right. Quite a variety then...<br/> 
🎧 I also ran the school farm.<br/> 
🎧 How interesting...<br/> 
🎧 And how did you find the whole experience?<br/> 
🎧 I'll be honest with you.<br/> 
🎧 At the end of the first year I really wanted to leave and come home.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, why was that?<br/> 
🎧 Well... I was very homesick at first and missed my family...<br/> 
🎧 Yes, I can understand that.<br/> 
🎧 and I also found it frustrating to have so few teaching resources,<br/> 
🎧 but I did decide to stay<br/> 
🎧 and in the end I extended my tour to a third year.<br/> 
🎧 Right.<br/> 
🎧 Things must have looked up then?<br/> 
🎧 Yes. We set up a very successful project breeding cattle to sell locally.<br/> 
🎧 Really?<br/> 
🎧 And then after a lot of hard work we finally got funds for new farm buildings.<br/> 
🎧 And you wanted to see things through?<br/> 
🎧 And that's why you want to train to teach Geography?<br/> 
🎧 Yes.<br/> 
🎧 I've had a couple of jobs since then<br/> 
🎧 but I now realise I like teaching best.<br/> 
🎧 And I chose Geography because...<br/> 
🎧 because it is my favourite subject...<br/> 
🎧 and also because I think it has so many useful applications.<br/> 
🎧 Well... you certainly have had some interesting work experience.<br/> 
🎧 I'll ask you now to go on to the next stage...<br/><br/>

🎧 Today's Health Counsel is presented by Paula Clayburg,<br/> 
🎧 who is the chief Counsellor at Liverpool's famous pain clinic:<br/> 
🎧 The Wilton Clinic.<br/> 
🎧 Paula...<br/> 
🎧 Do you know what Prince Charles, Seve Ballesteros and Elizabeth Taylor have in common?<br/> 
🎧 They all suffer from chronic back pain.<br/> 
🎧 In fact, bad backs are one of the most common health problems today,<br/> 
🎧 affecting people in all walks of life.<br/> 
🎧 The most recent available figures show that about a quarter of a million people<br/> 
🎧 are incapacitated with back pain every day.<br/> 
🎧 And many sufferers don't know the cause or the solution to their problem.<br/> 
🎧 The majority of our patients at the clinic tend to be women.<br/> 
🎧 They are especially vulnerable because of pregnancy<br/> 
🎧 but also because of osteoporosis,<br/> 
🎧 which I personally believe to be the major cause of problems for women.<br/> 
🎧 I have many women patients who say they have completely given up exercise<br/> 
🎧 because the pain makes them so miserable.<br/> 
🎧 But of course that starts up a vicious circle.<br/> 
🎧 Bed rest, giving up exercise and pain killers are traditional responses to back pain<br/> 
🎧 but, although there are many excellent drugs on the market,<br/> 
🎧 at our clinic we are beginning to realise the unique benefits of relaxation therapy.<br/> 
🎧 Other specialists in the field make a strong case for certain types of exercise,<br/> 
🎧 but in our experience they are easily mishandled<br/> 
🎧 and can lead to more harm than good.<br/> 
🎧 Now, let's look at some of the reasons why back pain is developing into such a unique menace.<br/> 
🎧 In general, the body is pretty good at self-repair.<br/> 
🎧 A strain or a blow to a limb, though painful at the time, generally resolves itself.<br/> 
🎧 But the body's response to back injury can be very counter-productive.<br/> 
🎧 When pain strikes,<br/> 
🎧 we attempt to keep the back as immobile as possible,<br/> 
🎧 which makes the muscles tense up.<br/> 
🎧 Research shows that they often go into spasm,<br/> 
🎧 which causes further twisting of the spine.<br/> 
🎧 A vicious circle is underway.<br/> 
🎧 The second mistake we often make when stricken with extreme back pain<br/> 
🎧 is to go to bed and stay there.<br/> 
🎧 Although at the clinic, we recognise that a short rest in bed can be helpful...<br/> 
🎧 up to two days...<br/> 
🎧 any longer makes our back muscles become weaker and unable to hold up our spine.<br/> 
🎧 The pain therefore becomes worse.<br/> 
🎧 Another problem is being overweight.<br/> 
🎧 Anyone a stone or more over-weight<br/> 
🎧 who already has back pain is not doing himself any favours:<br/> 
🎧 though it won't actually set it off in the first place,<br/> 
🎧 the weight will increase the strain and make things worse.<br/> 
🎧 The British diet could be partially to blame for the increase in back pain:<br/> 
🎧 over the last ten years the average weight of men has risen by 11 lbs<br/> 
🎧 and of women by 9 lbs.<br/> 
🎧 So much for the causes and aggravations of pain.<br/> 
🎧 But what can we do to help?<br/> 
🎧 There are many ways in which simple day-to-day care can make all the difference.<br/> 
🎧 The first point to watch of course is weight.<br/> 
🎧 If you are overweight, a diet will make all the difference.<br/> 
🎧 Also, studies have shown that just one hour sitting in a slouched position<br/> 
🎧 can strain ligaments in the back which can take months to heal.<br/> 
🎧 At the clinic, we have come to the conclusion<br/> 
🎧 that the major cause of the problem is not with the design of chairs, as some have suggested,<br/> 
🎧 but in the way we sit in them.<br/> 
🎧 It can be useful to get special orthopaedic chairs,<br/> 
🎧 but remember the most important improvement should be in our posture.<br/> 
🎧 Another enemy of your back is, of course, your beds.<br/> 
🎧 If your bed doesn't give enough support,<br/> 
🎧 back muscles and ligaments work all night trying to correct spinal alignment,<br/> 
🎧 so you wake up with a tired aching back.<br/> 
🎧 Try out an orthopaedic mattress or a spring slatted bed.<br/> 
🎧 Research shows that both can be beneficial for certain types of back pain.<br/> 
🎧 Another hazard for your back are the shock waves which travel up your spine when you walk,<br/> 
🎧 known as heel strike.<br/> 
🎧 A real find for our patients has been the shock-absorbing shoe insert.<br/> 
🎧 A cheap but very effective solution.<br/> 
🎧 And you might be better off avoiding shoes with heels higher than one and a half inches.<br/> 
🎧 Though absolutely flat shoes can be a solution for some,<br/> 
🎧 others find their posture suffers.<br/> 
🎧 Finally, a word about the state-of-the-art relief - the TENS machine -<br/> 
🎧 a small battery-powered gadget<br/> 
🎧 which delivers subliminal electrical pulses to the skin.<br/> 
🎧 Our experience indicates that your money is better spent on the more old-fashioned remedies.<br/><br/><br/>
