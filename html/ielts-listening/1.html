</span> 🎧 <span>Hello..</span>. <span>Flagstone.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span> <span>hello.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Is that <span>Flagstone</span> <span>Properties?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Yes that's <span>right.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Flagstone</span> here. How can I help <span>you?<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Hello.<br/>
</span> 🎧 I'm <span>ringing</span> just to make <span>enquiries</span> about <span>renting</span> a <span>house.<br/>
</span> 🎧 My <span>name's</span> <span>Jon</span> <span>Anderson.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Yes, <span>Mr</span> <span>Anderson.<br/>
</span> 🎧 What <span>sort</span> of thing were you <span>looking</span> <span>for?<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Umm..</span>. <span>Two-bedroomed</span> house with <span>garden.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Well..</span>. yes, sir, that shouldn't be any <span>problem...<br/>
</span> 🎧 just to let you know that our <span>main</span> <span>areas,<br/>
</span> 🎧 the <span>main</span> <span>areas</span> we <span>deal</span> with are the <span>city</span> <span>centre</span> <span>itself...<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>City</span> <span>centre...<br/>
</span> 🎧 And the <span>north</span> <span>suburbs.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span> <span>well...<br/>
</span> 🎧 we were most <span>interested</span> in the <span>Northern</span> <span>areas</span> <span>actually.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Right..</span>. <span>yes..</span>. What <span>sort</span> of <span>price</span> were you thinking <span>of?<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Well..</span>. <span>uh..</span>. could you give me some <span>idea?<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Certainly.<br/>
</span> 🎧 It really <span>ranges</span> from <span>£250</span> <span>per</span> <span>month.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Only <span>£250?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Yes, to about <span>£500</span> <span>depending</span> on a <span>number</span> of different <span>factors.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span>, what does it <span>depend</span> <span>on?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Well, <span>obviously</span> the <span>quality</span> of the <span>area.<br/>
</span> 🎧 And then <span>whether</span> there's a <span>garden.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Well, as I said, we'd want a <span>garden.<br/>
</span> 🎧 And a <span>garage</span> <span>pushes</span> up the <span>price.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Right...<br/>
</span> 🎧 well, we wouldn't <span>necessarily</span> need <span>one.<br/>
</span> 🎧 I think about <span>£350</span> a <span>month</span> would be our <span>limit.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Okay.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Well..</span>. would you like to have a look at a <span>couple</span> of <span>properties</span>, <span>sir?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Yes, that'd be <span>great.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Um..</span>. <span>Looking</span> at our <span>files..</span>. I think <span>we've</span> got two which might <span>suit</span> <span>you...<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Hang</span> on. I'll just get a <span>pen.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Right.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Okay</span>. Well, there's one on <span>West</span> <span>Park</span> <span>Road<br/>
</span> 🎧 which is <span>£325</span> a <span>month.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Are the <span>bills</span> <span>included?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Well, that one just <span>includes</span> the water <span>bill.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Okay</span>, <span>right.<br/>
</span> 🎧 And the <span>second</span> house is in <span>Tithe</span> <span>Road.<br/>
</span> 🎧 I'll just <span>spell</span> that for you, <span>okay?<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Yep.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>TITHE</span> <span>Road.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Got <span>that.<br/>
</span> 🎧 And how much is that <span>one?<br/>
</span> 🎧 That's <span>£380.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>380.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Uh..</span>. Is that <span>including</span> <span>water?<br/>
</span> 🎧 No, I'm <span>afraid</span> not, but it does <span>include</span> the <span>telephone</span> <span>rental.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span> well, that's not too bad <span>then.<br/>
</span> 🎧 So, when would you be <span>available</span> to see <span>them?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Well, <span>uh..</span>. I'll be in <span>town</span> next <span>week..</span>. <span>say..</span>. <span>Thursday?<br/>
</span> 🎧 No, I'm <span>sorry</span> we don't have any <span>availability</span> for <span>Thursday.<br/>
</span> 🎧 How about <span>Wednesday</span> <span>afternoon?<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Okay</span>. That's <span>fine.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Would <span>5</span> be <span>okay?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Yes, <span>fine.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>5</span> <span>o'clock</span> it <span>is.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Just come to the <span>Flagstone</span> <span>Offices.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span>, before I <span>forget.<br/>
</span> 🎧 What <span>sort</span> of things do I need to get <span>done..</span>. to <span>rent</span> with <span>you?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Well, the most <span>important</span> thing is a <span>letter</span> from your <span>bank...<br/>
</span> 🎧 No <span>problem...<br/>
</span> 🎧 And then a <span>reference</span> <span>letter</span> from your <span>employer.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Yes, that's <span>okay.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Great, and then we would need you to give <span>2</span> <span>weeks'</span> <span>notice</span> of <span>moving</span> <span>in...<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Right..</span>. <span>2</span> <span>weeks'</span> <span>notice.<br/>
</span> 🎧 And what about a <span>deposit?<br/>
</span> 🎧 That's one <span>month's</span> <span>rent</span>, whatever the <span>amount</span> <span>is.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Okay</span>. One <span>month.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Is that <span>it?<br/>
</span> 🎧 No, <span>sorry</span>, one <span>more...<br/>
</span> 🎧 you will have to pay for the <span>contract.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span> yes. I'd <span>forgotten</span> about <span>that.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Okay</span>, <span>fine.<br/>
</span> 🎧 So I'll start <span>arranging</span> <span>those.<br/>
</span> 🎧 I'll see you next <span>week.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Yes. Thanks very <span>much.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Bye.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Goodbye.<br/>

</span> 🎧 <span>Hello</span>, <span>Mrs</span> <span>Sutton</span>. Come <span>in.<br/>
</span> 🎧 How are you <span>settling</span> in next <span>door?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Have all your things from <span>Canada</span> <span>arrived</span> <span>yet?<br/>
</span> 🎧 I thought I saw a <span>removals</span> <span>van</span> outside your house <span>yesterday</span> <span>afternoon.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Yes. They came <span>yesterday.<br/>
</span> 🎧 We <span>spent</span> all day <span>yesterday</span> <span>arranging</span> <span>them.<br/>
</span> 🎧 It's <span>beginning</span> to feel a bit more like home <span>now.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span> that's <span>good.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Look, come in and sit <span>down.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Are you <span>alright?<br/>
</span> 🎧 You look a bit <span>worried.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Well, I am a <span>bit.<br/>
</span> 🎧 I'm <span>sorry</span> to <span>bother</span> you so <span>early</span>, <span>Mrs</span> <span>Smith</span>, <span>but<br/>
</span> 🎧 I <span>wonder</span> if you could help <span>me.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Could you tell me how I can get <span>hold</span> of a <span>doctor?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Our <span>daughter</span>, <span>Anna</span>, isn't very well this morning <span>and...<br/>
</span> 🎧 I may have to <span>call</span> <span>somebody</span> <span>out.<br/>
</span> 🎧 She <span>keeps</span> being <span>sick</span> and I am <span>beginning</span> to get a bit <span>worried.<br/>
</span> 🎧 I just don't know how the <span>health</span> <span>system</span> <span>works</span> here in <span>England.<br/>
</span> 🎧 All I know is that it's very different from <span>ours</span> back in <span>Canada.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Well, I don't know really where to <span>start.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Let me <span>think.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Well, the first thing you have to do is find a <span>family</span> <span>doctor</span> <span>-<br/>
</span> 🎧 sometimes we <span>call</span> them <span>general</span> <span>practitioners</span> as well <span>-<br/>
</span> 🎧 and <span>register</span> with him or <span>her.<br/>
</span> 🎧 If you live here, you've got to be on a <span>doctor's</span> <span>list.<br/>
</span> 🎧 If you're not, things can be a bit <span>difficult.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Nobody</span> will come out to you if you're not <span>registered.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, they work in things <span>called</span> <span>practices.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Sort</span> of small <span>groups</span> of <span>family</span> <span>doctors</span> all working together in the same <span>building.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Now what you've got to do this morning is <span>register</span> with one of <span>them.<br/>
</span> 🎧 There are two <span>practices</span> near <span>here,<br/>
</span> 🎧 so we're quite well off for <span>doctors</span> in this <span>part</span> of <span>Manchester.<br/>
</span> 🎧 There's the <span>Dean</span> End <span>Health</span> <span>Centre</span> about ten <span>minutes'</span> <span>walk</span> <span>away<br/>
</span> 🎧 and there's another <span>practice</span> in <span>South</span> <span>Hay.<br/>
</span> 🎧 That's about <span>five</span> <span>minutes</span> away going <span>towards</span> the <span>town</span> <span>centre.<br/>
</span> 🎧 We're <span>registered</span> at the <span>Dean</span> End <span>one,<br/>
</span> 🎧 but they're both <span>okay.<br/>
</span> 🎧 There are about six <span>doctors</span> in our <span>practice</span> and <span>four</span> in the <span>other.<br/>
</span> 🎧 So <span>ours</span> is quite big in <span>comparison.<br/>
</span> 🎧 And the <span>building</span> and <span>everything's</span> a bit more <span>modern.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>South</span> <span>Hay</span> is a bit <span>old-fashioned</span> but the <span>doctors</span> are <span>okay.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Their only <span>problem</span> is that they don't have a <span>proper</span> <span>appointment</span> <span>system.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Sometimes you have to wait for <span>ages</span> there to see <span>someone.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, you go to the <span>receptionist</span> in <span>whichever</span> <span>health</span> <span>centre<br/>
</span> 🎧 and ask her to <span>register</span> you with a <span>doctor</span> <span>there.<br/>
</span> 🎧 You have to <span>fill</span> in a <span>form</span>, but it doesn't take <span>long.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Ours</span> is <span>called</span> <span>Dr</span> <span>Jones<br/>
</span> 🎧 and <span>we've</span> been going to him for years <span>-<br/>
</span> 🎧 ever since we <span>moved</span> here <span>fifteen</span> years <span>ago.<br/>
</span> 🎧 I wouldn't say he's <span>brilliant</span> but I <span>suppose</span> he's alright <span>really.<br/>
</span> 🎧 We're used to him <span>now.<br/>
</span> 🎧 They say he's very good with <span>elderly</span> <span>people,<br/>
</span> 🎧 but he does <span>tend</span> to get a bit <span>impatient</span> with <span>children.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Listen, the one who's <span>supposed</span> to be really good with small <span>children</span> is <span>Dr</span> <span>Shaw.<br/>
</span> 🎧 I've <span>heard</span> <span>lots</span> of people say <span>that.<br/>
</span> 🎧 She's young and she's got small <span>children</span> of her <span>own.<br/>
</span> 🎧 So you could try <span>registering</span> with <span>her.<br/>
</span> 🎧 And if her <span>list's</span> <span>full,<br/>
</span> 🎧 I <span>heard</span> <span>somebody</span> say the other day that there's a really nice young <span>doctor</span> at <span>South</span> <span>Hay,<br/>
</span> 🎧 a <span>Dr</span> <span>Williams.<br/>
</span> 🎧 He <span>holds</span> special <span>clinics</span> for people with back <span>trouble.<br/>
</span> 🎧 But that's not really your <span>problem</span>, is <span>it?<br/>
</span> 🎧 If you want a <span>doctor</span> to visit you at <span>home,<br/>
</span> 🎧 you have to ask for a home <span>visit.<br/>
</span> 🎧 You're <span>supposed</span> to do that before <span>10.30</span> in the <span>morning,<br/>
</span> 🎧 but <span>obviously</span>, if it's an <span>emergency</span>, you can phone at any time, <span>night</span> or <span>day.<br/>
</span> 🎧 It might not be your <span>doctor</span> that comes, <span>though.<br/>
</span> 🎧 It's quite often one of the other <span>doctors</span> in the <span>practice.<br/>
</span> 🎧 It doesn't really <span>seem</span> to make much <span>difference.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Otherwise</span> you make an <span>appointment</span> to see your <span>doctor</span> at the <span>health</span> <span>centre.<br/>
</span> 🎧 You usually get <span>seen</span> the same <span>day.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Not always of course, but usually, as I <span>say.<br/>
</span> 🎧 They <span>hold</span> <span>surgeries</span> between <span>9</span> and <span>11.30</span> every <span>weekday,<br/>
</span> 🎧 and from <span>4</span> to <span>6.30</span> <span>Monday</span> to <span>Thursday.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Saturdays</span> are only for <span>emergencies.<br/>
</span> 🎧 When the <span>doctor</span> <span>sees</span> you, he <span>gives</span> you a <span>prescription.<br/>
</span> 🎧 He <span>writes</span> what <span>medication</span> you need on it and you take it to a <span>chemist's</span> <span>shop.<br/>
</span> 🎧 There's one <span>opposite</span> the <span>centre.<br/>
</span> 🎧 If it's for a <span>child</span> under <span>16</span>, you don't have to <span>pay.<br/>
</span> 🎧 So if it's for <span>Anna</span>, there's no <span>problem.<br/>
</span> 🎧 The same thing <span>goes</span> if you're <span>unemployed</span> or <span>retired</span>, or if you're <span>pregnant.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Just as well because it's not <span>cheap.<br/>
</span> 🎧 You pay the same <span>price</span> for each <span>item</span> the <span>doctor</span> has <span>prescribed.<br/>
</span> 🎧 At the <span>moment</span> it's something like <span>£5</span> <span>per</span> <span>item.<br/>
</span> 🎧 So you pay for the <span>medication</span> but the <span>consultation</span> with the <span>doctor</span> doesn't <span>cost</span> you <span>anything.<br/>
</span> 🎧 It's <span>completely</span> free as long as you're a <span>resident</span> <span>here.<br/>
</span> 🎧 You're going to be here for <span>three</span> years, aren't <span>you?<br/>
</span> 🎧 So there shouldn't be any <span>question</span> of you <span>paying</span> anything to see the <span>doctor.<br/>
</span> 🎧 So that's one less <span>problem</span> to <span>worry</span> <span>about.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Look, <span>Mrs</span> <span>Sutton</span>. If you <span>want,<br/>
</span> 🎧 I'll sit with your <span>daughter</span> for <span>half</span> an <span>hour</span> if you want to go down to the <span>health</span> <span>centre</span> to <span>register.<br/>
</span> 🎧 It's no <span>trouble</span> really, don't <span>worry.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Are you sure you wouldn't <span>mind?<br/>
</span> 🎧 That would really help me a <span>lot.<br/>
</span> 🎧 I'll ask them if they can <span>send</span> <span>someone</span> <span>round</span> later to see <span>Anna.<br/>
</span> 🎧 I think I'll try the <span>Dean</span> End <span>Centre.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Good <span>idea.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Don't <span>worry</span> about <span>Anna.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Right. I'll be back as soon as I <span>can.<br/>
</span><br/><br/>

</span> 🎧 <span>Hello</span>. <span>Jonathan</span> <span>Briggs</span>, isn't <span>it?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Yes, that's <span>right.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Do come in and sit <span>down.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Thanks.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Right.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Well, <span>Jonathan</span>, as we <span>explained</span> in your <span>letter,<br/>
</span> 🎧 in this <span>part</span> of the <span>interview</span>, we like to talk through your <span>application</span> <span>form...<br/>
</span> 🎧 your <span>experience</span> to <span>date</span>, <span>etc....<br/>
</span> 🎧 and then in the <span>second</span> <span>part,<br/>
</span> 🎧 you go for a <span>group</span> <span>interview.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Group</span> <span>interview..</span>. yes, I <span>understand...<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>So..</span>. your first <span>degree</span> was in <span>Economics?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Yes, but I also did <span>Politics</span> as a <span>major</span> <span>strand.<br/>
</span> 🎧 And you <span>graduated</span> in <span>1989.<br/>
</span> 🎧 And I see you have been doing some <span>teaching...<br/>
</span> 🎧 Yes. I <span>worked</span> as a <span>volunteer</span> <span>teacher</span> in <span>West</span> <span>Africa.<br/>
</span> 🎧 I was there for almost <span>three</span> years in <span>total</span> <span>from....<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>1990</span> <span>to..</span>. <span>1992.<br/>
</span> 🎧 How <span>interesting.<br/>
</span> 🎧 What <span>organisation</span> was that <span>with?<br/>
</span> 🎧 It's not one of the <span>major</span> <span>ones</span>. It's <span>called</span> <span>Teach</span> <span>South.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span>, <span>right.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Yes, I have <span>heard</span> of <span>it.<br/>
</span> 🎧 It <span>operates</span> in <span>several</span> <span>African</span> <span>countries</span>, doesn't <span>it?<br/>
</span> 🎧 And what kind of school was <span>it?<br/>
</span> 🎧 A <span>rural</span> <span>co-operative.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span>, a <span>rural</span> <span>co-operative</span>, how <span>interesting...<br/>
</span> 🎧 and what did you <span>teach?<br/>
</span> 🎧 A <span>variety</span> of things in different <span>years...<br/>
</span> 🎧 I <span>did..</span>. with <span>Forms</span> <span>1</span> to <span>3</span> <span>mainly</span> <span>Geography<br/>
</span> 🎧 and some English with <span>Form</span> <span>5.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Then in my <span>final</span> <span>year,<br/>
</span> 🎧 I took on some <span>Agricultural</span> <span>Science</span> with the top <span>year...<br/>
</span> 🎧 that's <span>Form</span> <span>6.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Right. Quite a <span>variety</span> <span>then...<br/>
</span> 🎧 I also ran the school <span>farm.<br/>
</span> 🎧 How <span>interesting...<br/>
</span> 🎧 And how did you find the <span>whole</span> <span>experience?<br/>
</span> 🎧 I'll be <span>honest</span> with <span>you.<br/>
</span> 🎧 At the end of the first year I really <span>wanted</span> to <span>leave</span> and come <span>home.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span>, why was <span>that?<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Well..</span>. I was very <span>homesick</span> at first and <span>missed</span> my <span>family...<br/>
</span> 🎧 Yes, I can <span>understand</span> <span>that.<br/>
</span> 🎧 and I also <span>found</span> it <span>frustrating</span> to have so few <span>teaching</span> <span>resources,<br/>
</span> 🎧 but I did decide to <span>stay<br/>
</span> 🎧 and in the end I <span>extended</span> my <span>tour</span> to a <span>third</span> <span>year.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Right.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Things <span>must</span> have <span>looked</span> up <span>then?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Yes. We set up a very <span>successful</span> <span>project</span> <span>breeding</span> <span>cattle</span> to sell <span>locally.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Really?<br/>
</span> 🎧 And then after a lot of <span>hard</span> work we <span>finally</span> got <span>funds</span> for new <span>farm</span> <span>buildings.<br/>
</span> 🎧 And you <span>wanted</span> to see things <span>through?<br/>
</span> 🎧 And that's why you want to <span>train</span> to <span>teach</span> <span>Geography?<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Yes.<br/>
</span> 🎧 I've had a <span>couple</span> of <span>jobs</span> since <span>then<br/>
</span> 🎧 but I now <span>realise</span> I like <span>teaching</span> <span>best.<br/>
</span> 🎧 And I <span>chose</span> <span>Geography</span> <span>because...<br/>
</span> 🎧 because it is my <span>favourite</span> <span>subject...<br/>
</span> 🎧 and also because I think it has so many <span>useful</span> <span>applications.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Well..</span>. you <span>certainly</span> have had some <span>interesting</span> work <span>experience.<br/>
</span> 🎧 I'll ask you now to go on to the next <span>stage...<br/>

</span> 🎧 <span>Today's</span> <span>Health</span> <span>Counsel</span> is <span>presented</span> by <span>Paula</span> <span>Clayburg,<br/>
</span> 🎧 who is the <span>chief</span> <span>Counsellor</span> at <span>Liverpool's</span> famous <span>pain</span> <span>clinic:<br/>
</span> 🎧 The <span>Wilton</span> <span>Clinic.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Paula...<br/>
</span> 🎧 Do you know what <span>Prince</span> <span>Charles</span>, <span>Seve</span> <span>Ballesteros</span> and <span>Elizabeth</span> <span>Taylor</span> have in <span>common?<br/>
</span> 🎧 They all <span>suffer</span> from <span>chronic</span> back <span>pain.<br/>
</span> 🎧 In <span>fact</span>, bad <span>backs</span> are one of the most <span>common</span> <span>health</span> <span>problems</span> <span>today,<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>affecting</span> people in all <span>walks</span> of <span>life.<br/>
</span> 🎧 The most <span>recent</span> <span>available</span> <span>figures</span> <span>show</span> that about a <span>quarter</span> of a <span>million</span> <span>people<br/>
</span> 🎧 are <span>incapacitated</span> with back <span>pain</span> every <span>day.<br/>
</span> 🎧 And many <span>sufferers</span> don't know the <span>cause</span> or the <span>solution</span> to their <span>problem.<br/>
</span> 🎧 The <span>majority</span> of our <span>patients</span> at the <span>clinic</span> <span>tend</span> to be <span>women.<br/>
</span> 🎧 They are <span>especially</span> <span>vulnerable</span> because of <span>pregnancy<br/>
</span> 🎧 but also because of <span>osteoporosis,<br/>
</span> 🎧 which I <span>personally</span> <span>believe</span> to be the <span>major</span> <span>cause</span> of <span>problems</span> for <span>women.<br/>
</span> 🎧 I have many <span>women</span> <span>patients</span> who say they have <span>completely</span> <span>given</span> up <span>exercise<br/>
</span> 🎧 because the <span>pain</span> makes them so <span>miserable.<br/>
</span> 🎧 But of course that <span>starts</span> up a <span>vicious</span> <span>circle.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Bed <span>rest</span>, <span>giving</span> up <span>exercise</span> and <span>pain</span> <span>killers</span> are <span>traditional</span> <span>responses</span> to back <span>pain<br/>
</span> 🎧 but, <span>although</span> there are many <span>excellent</span> <span>drugs</span> on the <span>market,<br/>
</span> 🎧 at our <span>clinic</span> we are <span>beginning</span> to <span>realise</span> the <span>unique</span> <span>benefits</span> of <span>relaxation</span> <span>therapy.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Other <span>specialists</span> in the <span>field</span> make a <span>strong</span> case for <span>certain</span> <span>types</span> of <span>exercise,<br/>
</span> 🎧 but in our <span>experience</span> they are <span>easily</span> <span>mishandled<br/>
</span> 🎧 and can <span>lead</span> to more <span>harm</span> than <span>good.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Now, let's look at some of the <span>reasons</span> why back <span>pain</span> is <span>developing</span> into such a <span>unique</span> <span>menace.<br/>
</span> 🎧 In <span>general</span>, the <span>body</span> is <span>pretty</span> good at <span>self-repair.<br/>
</span> 🎧 A <span>strain</span> or a <span>blow</span> to a <span>limb</span>, though <span>painful</span> at the time, <span>generally</span> <span>resolves</span> <span>itself.<br/>
</span> 🎧 But the <span>body's</span> <span>response</span> to back <span>injury</span> can be very <span>counter-productive.<br/>
</span> 🎧 When <span>pain</span> <span>strikes,<br/>
</span> 🎧 we <span>attempt</span> to keep the back as <span>immobile</span> as <span>possible,<br/>
</span> 🎧 which makes the <span>muscles</span> <span>tense</span> <span>up.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Research</span> <span>shows</span> that they often go into <span>spasm,<br/>
</span> 🎧 which <span>causes</span> <span>further</span> <span>twisting</span> of the <span>spine.<br/>
</span> 🎧 A <span>vicious</span> <span>circle</span> is <span>underway.<br/>
</span> 🎧 The <span>second</span> <span>mistake</span> we often make when <span>stricken</span> with <span>extreme</span> back <span>pain<br/>
</span> 🎧 is to go to bed and <span>stay</span> <span>there.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Although</span> at the <span>clinic</span>, we <span>recognise</span> that a <span>short</span> <span>rest</span> in bed can be <span>helpful...<br/>
</span> 🎧 up to two <span>days...<br/>
</span> 🎧 any <span>longer</span> makes our back <span>muscles</span> become <span>weaker</span> and <span>unable</span> to <span>hold</span> up our <span>spine.<br/>
</span> 🎧 The <span>pain</span> <span>therefore</span> <span>becomes</span> <span>worse.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Another <span>problem</span> is being <span>overweight.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Anyone</span> a <span>stone</span> or more <span>over-weight<br/>
</span> 🎧 who <span>already</span> has back <span>pain</span> is not doing <span>himself</span> any <span>favours:<br/>
</span> 🎧 though it won't <span>actually</span> set it off in the first <span>place,<br/>
</span> 🎧 the <span>weight</span> will <span>increase</span> the <span>strain</span> and make things <span>worse.<br/>
</span> 🎧 The <span>British</span> <span>diet</span> could be <span>partially</span> to <span>blame</span> for the <span>increase</span> in back <span>pain:<br/>
</span> 🎧 over the last ten years the <span>average</span> <span>weight</span> of men has <span>risen</span> by <span>11</span> <span>lbs<br/>
</span> 🎧 and of <span>women</span> by <span>9</span> <span>lbs.<br/>
</span> 🎧 So much for the <span>causes</span> and <span>aggravations</span> of <span>pain.<br/>
</span> 🎧 But what can we do to <span>help?<br/>
</span> 🎧 There are many <span>ways</span> in which <span>simple</span> <span>day-to-day</span> <span>care</span> can make all the <span>difference.<br/>
</span> 🎧 The first <span>point</span> to <span>watch</span> of course is <span>weight.<br/>
</span> 🎧 If you are <span>overweight</span>, a <span>diet</span> will make all the <span>difference.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Also, <span>studies</span> have <span>shown</span> that just one <span>hour</span> <span>sitting</span> in a <span>slouched</span> <span>position<br/>
</span> 🎧 can <span>strain</span> <span>ligaments</span> in the back which can take <span>months</span> to <span>heal.<br/>
</span> 🎧 At the <span>clinic</span>, we have come to the <span>conclusion<br/>
</span> 🎧 that the <span>major</span> <span>cause</span> of the <span>problem</span> is not with the <span>design</span> of <span>chairs</span>, as some have <span>suggested,<br/>
</span> 🎧 but in the way we sit in <span>them.<br/>
</span> 🎧 It can be <span>useful</span> to get special <span>orthopaedic</span> <span>chairs,<br/>
</span> 🎧 but <span>remember</span> the most <span>important</span> <span>improvement</span> should be in our <span>posture.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Another <span>enemy</span> of your back is, of course, your <span>beds.<br/>
</span> 🎧 If your bed doesn't give enough <span>support,<br/>
</span> 🎧 back <span>muscles</span> and <span>ligaments</span> work all <span>night</span> trying to <span>correct</span> <span>spinal</span> <span>alignment,<br/>
</span> 🎧 so you <span>wake</span> up with a <span>tired</span> <span>aching</span> <span>back.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Try out an <span>orthopaedic</span> <span>mattress</span> or a <span>spring</span> <span>slatted</span> <span>bed.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Research</span> <span>shows</span> that both can be <span>beneficial</span> for <span>certain</span> <span>types</span> of back <span>pain.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Another <span>hazard</span> for your back are the <span>shock</span> <span>waves</span> which travel up your <span>spine</span> when you <span>walk,<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>known</span> as <span>heel</span> <span>strike.<br/>
</span> 🎧 A <span>real</span> find for our <span>patients</span> has been the <span>shock-absorbing</span> <span>shoe</span> <span>insert.<br/>
</span> 🎧 A <span>cheap</span> but very <span>effective</span> <span>solution.<br/>
</span> 🎧 And you might be better off <span>avoiding</span> <span>shoes</span> with <span>heels</span> <span>higher</span> than one and a <span>half</span> <span>inches.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Though absolutely <span>flat</span> <span>shoes</span> can be a <span>solution</span> for <span>some,<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>others</span> find their <span>posture</span> <span>suffers.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Finally</span>, a <span>word</span> about the <span>state-of-the-art</span> <span>relief</span> <span>-</span> the <span>TENS</span> <span>machine</span> <span>-<br/>
</span> 🎧 a small <span>battery-powered</span> <span>gadget<br/>
</span> 🎧 which <span>delivers</span> <span>subliminal</span> <span>electrical</span> <span>pulses</span> to the <span>skin.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Our <span>experience</span> <span>indicates</span> that your money is better <span>spent</span> on the more <span>old-fashioned</span> <span>remedies.<br/>
