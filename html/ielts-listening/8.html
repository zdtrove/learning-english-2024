🎧 Hi Tony</span>, thanks ever so much for coming</span>.<br/>
🎧 You know we've been asked</span> to organise</span> something for John's</span> farewell</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, sure, it's about time we started</span> working out details</span>.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 We don't want to leave it so late</span> that it's double</span> the work.<br/>
🎧 Mmm</span>, mm</span>, right, do you want me to take notes</span>?<br/>
🎧 That'd be great, thanks.<br/>
🎧 Right, first thing is,<br/>
🎧 when is the best time to hold</span> it?<br/>
🎧 Well, he leaves on the 24th</span> of December</span>.<br/>
🎧 So what about the 22nd</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I think that's about right.<br/>
🎧 We want it quite near the time, don't we?<br/>
🎧 Sure, and what about a venue</span>?<br/>
🎧 In college</span>? A hotel</span>?<br/>
🎧 I think a hotel</span> will probably work out rather expensive</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I've been looking at the College</span> Dining</span> Room.<br/>
🎧 That seems</span> pretty</span> reasonable</span>.<br/>
🎧 Fine, yeah, why not?<br/>
🎧 And then we ought</span> to be thinking about invitations..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Who mustn't we forget</span> to invite</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, obviously</span> John</span> and his wife</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And the Director</span>.<br/>
🎧 The office</span> staff</span>.<br/>
🎧 And all the teachers</span> and all the students.<br/>
🎧 Anyone</span> else?<br/>
🎧 Faculty</span> Heads</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, better draw</span> the line</span>, I don't think it's necessary</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, you're right.<br/>
🎧 I don't mind</span> writing</span> the invitations</span>.<br/>
🎧 When shall we get them out for?<br/>
🎧 Enough time but not too early</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about the fifteenth</span> of December</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, there are exams</span> on the 16th</span> -</span> better avoid</span> them.<br/>
🎧 10th</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, that should do it.<br/>
🎧 So what does that leave?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, a present</span>.<br/>
🎧 Would you mind</span> doing that?<br/>
🎧 No, not at all;<br/></span>
🎧 we usually go round</span> with an envelope</span> during coffee</span> break</span>, don't we?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, coffee</span> break's</span> always the best time,<br/>
🎧 'cos</span> people have got their money handy</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, exactly.<br/>
🎧 Do we suggest</span> an amount?<br/>
🎧 Or does it seem</span> a bit unfair</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, I think people welcome</span> it.<br/>
🎧 We suggested</span> 6</span> dollars</span> last time, is that okay?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, plenty</span>, I would have thought,<br/>
🎧 which should leave us with about 90</span> dollars</span>.<br/>
🎧 Have you any ideas</span> for presents</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I've been having a little think.<br/>
🎧 I thought..</span>.<br/>
🎧 you know, he loves</span> music.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, and books.<br/>
🎧 So, I thought I'd check on prices</span> for, well, perhaps</span> CD</span> players</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, that's a, that's a good idea,<br/>
🎧 and also I thought maybe, you know, a set of dictionaries</span>.<br/>
🎧 I heard him say he needed</span> a good one.<br/>
🎧 The other thing he was saying last week was that his computer</span> printer</span> had broken</span>.<br/>
🎧 Umm</span>. No, I'd be really frightened</span> about getting the wrong type</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, yeah.<br/>
🎧 The other thing is something for the home.<br/>
🎧 Jill</span> suggested</span> a coffee</span> maker</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll certainly</span> find out what they cost</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, have you got all that down?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Now we need to think a little more about the money.<br/>
🎧 I know we've got a set amount from the Social</span> Fund</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, what does that cover</span>?<br/>
🎧 It's meant</span> to cover</span> the cost</span> of the room.<br/>
🎧 And a certain</span> amount for food.<br/>
🎧 And also drinks</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh yeah, certainly</span>.<br/>
🎧 But will it be enough?<br/>
🎧 What we've done in the past</span> is to ask guests</span> to bring</span> some snacks</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 We don't ask them to bring</span> more drinks</span> because we figure</span> that's..</span>.<br/>
🎧 that should come from the Social</span> Fund</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Anything else for the guests</span> to bring</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, oh, some music,<br/>
🎧 because there'll</span> be a tape</span> deck</span> there in the room, and we can have some dancing</span> later on.<br/>
🎧 Anything else?<br/>
🎧 It's just a thought, but a couple</span> of years ago we had a really good party</span> where we set up..</span>.<br/>
🎧 you know, some simple games</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, great.<br/>
🎧 Wasn't it based</span> on photos</span> from the students and teachers</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 So we should ask the guests</span> to bring</span> photos</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay. I'll put it on the invitations</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now the last thing is,<br/>
🎧 who shall we ask to do the speech</span>?<br/>
🎧 Don't you think it might be nice to have one of the students?<br/>
🎧 Well then, the Student</span> Leader</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, much better than the Director</span> giving</span> speeches</span> again.<br/>
🎧 Okay then, I'll ask her.<br/>
🎧 Lovely</span>!<br/>
🎧 So, is that all?<br/>
🎧 Looks like it.<br/>
🎧 Great! Thanks ever so much..</span>.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Hi Sue</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hi Mike</span>.<br/>
🎧 So what happened</span> to you last week?<br/>
🎧 Oh, I was sick</span> with the flu</span>.<br/>
🎧 What's this I hear about a big assignment</span> we've got to do?<br/>
🎧 Oh, well, basically</span>, we've got to find two science</span> experiments<br/></span>
🎧 to do with a group of 8-year-old</span> children at the local</span> primary</span> school,<br/>
🎧 and we've got to complete</span> it by the end of the week.<br/>
🎧 That sounds like hard</span> work.<br/>
🎧 Where are we supposed</span> to get the ideas</span> for these experiments</span> from?<br/>
🎧 Well, I managed</span> to get hold</span> of two books from the library</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, well done!<br/>
🎧 How about if we take a look at the experiments</span> in this book first<br/></span>
🎧 and see if anything looks suitable</span>?<br/>
🎧 I can make notes</span> as we go, about equipment</span> and the purpose</span> of the experiments</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, let's see..</span>.<br/>
🎧 the first experiment</span> is called 'Make</span> your own hovercraft'</span>,<br/>
🎧 which sounds very ambitious</span>!<br/>
🎧 Mind</span> you, you only need 20</span> balloons</span> and a table</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 you don't need any special engines</span> or anything like that!<br/>
🎧 What do you do with it all?<br/>
🎧 Er</span>, you blow</span> up the balloons</span> and you balance</span> the table</span> on them,<br/>
🎧 upside</span> down of course, and the kids</span> get to ride</span> around on it.<br/>
🎧 You know, the other kids</span> sort</span> of push</span> them around the room.<br/>
🎧 The main</span> purpose</span> is to show how hovercrafts</span> work,<br/>
🎧 and how things hover</span> around on just a cushion</span> of air.<br/>
🎧 Okay, that doesn't sound too bad.<br/>
🎧 Okay, ready for number two?<br/>
🎧 Now this one is called 'Unusual</span> Measures</span> of Lengths'</span>,<br/>
🎧 and you basically</span> use lots of paperclips</span>.<br/>
🎧 The kids</span> go around the class measuring</span> things -<br/></span>
🎧 you know, how long the desk</span> is, and that sort</span> of thing,<br/>
🎧 and then they all compare</span> their answers</span>.<br/>
🎧 And, basically</span>, because not all paperclips</span> are the same lengths</span>,<br/>
🎧 they should come up with some strange</span> answers</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's supposed</span> to demonstrate</span> the importance</span> of having fixed</span> units</span> of measurement</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, that's not bad.<br/>
🎧 Okay, now for number three</span> you need rock</span> salt</span> or copper</span> sulphate</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I'm not sure about that!<br/>
🎧 Well, just put down the rock</span> salt</span> then..</span>.<br/>
🎧 apart</span> from that you only need a jar</span> of water.<br/>
🎧 And basically</span> you dissolve</span> lots of salt</span> into the water<br/></span>
🎧 and watch</span> the crystals</span> form</span>,<br/>
🎧 so it basically</span> teaches</span> the kids</span> about growing</span> crystals</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I suppose</span> it would be nice to grow</span> something.<br/>
🎧 Hmm</span>, let's move on and have a look at number four</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, this one is called 'Spinning</span> colour</span> wheel'</span>.<br/>
🎧 It looks like you get some cardboard</span> and draw</span> a circle</span> on it,<br/>
🎧 divide</span> it into six equal</span> segments</span> and colour</span> each one in using</span> different colours</span>,<br/>
🎧 then you thread</span> a piece</span> of string</span> through the middle</span>.<br/>
🎧 So we'd need some string</span> as well.<br/>
🎧 Yes, sorry..</span>.<br/>
🎧 and you spin</span> the wheel</span> around<br/></span>
🎧 and if you can get it spinning</span> fast</span> enough,<br/>
🎧 hopefully</span> the colours</span> all merge</span> and show up as white</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I didn't know that.<br/>
🎧 What's the principle</span> behind it?<br/>
🎧 Well it's pretty</span> elementary</span> physics</span>, really.<br/>
🎧 It teaches</span> them about how white</span> light</span> or ordinary</span> light</span> is made up.<br/>
🎧 Hmm</span>, well that doesn't sound too bad.<br/>
🎧 Now there's only one more left</span> in this book isn't there?<br/>
🎧 What does that one say?<br/>
🎧 Um</span>, well it's another one where they'd get to make something.<br/>
🎧 Sounds very interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 You need quite a lot of equipment</span> actually -<br/></span>
🎧 a hand</span> drill</span>, an old record</span>,<br/>
🎧 a pin</span> or needle</span>, some paper</span> and a bolt</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hmm</span>, go on, what do they have to do?<br/>
🎧 Well, they basically</span> make a record</span> player</span>.<br/>
🎧 The main</span> idea is to teach</span> them about recording</span> sound,<br/>
🎧 but hopefully</span> they'd also see that you need motion</span> and an amplifier</span> to make the sound heard.<br/>
🎧 Okay, well it does sound interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 Shall we go through all of those again and decide if any of them are going to be suitable</span>?<br/>
🎧 Right, number one.<br/>
🎧 I thought this one sounded</span> nice</span>: there'd</span> be lots of activity<br/></span>
🎧 and it doesn't need too much in the way of equipment</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's true</span>, but..</span>.<br/>
🎧 don't you think it's a bit risky</span> to get a group of 8-year-olds</span> pushing</span> each other around a classroom</span> like that?<br/>
🎧 Someone</span> could get hurt</span>.<br/>
🎧 No, I don't like the sound of that one at all!<br/>
🎧 Maybe you're right.<br/>
🎧 What about number two, with the paperclips</span>?<br/>
🎧 It sounds tame</span> enough.<br/>
🎧 Yes, a bit too tame</span> if you ask me.<br/>
🎧 I think it needs to be something a bit more active</span> and interesting</span> than that, don't you?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I suppose</span> you're right.<br/>
🎧 We won't get a very good mark</span> if the children don't actually enjoy the experiments</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I suppose</span> we could turn</span> them off science</span> for good!<br/>
🎧 Well, what about the next one, number three</span>?<br/>
🎧 Now, I quite like the idea of this one.<br/>
🎧 Yes, so do I,<br/>
🎧 but I seem</span> to remember when we did it at high school<br/></span>
🎧 we had to wait up to a fortnight</span> before we saw any halfway</span> decent</span> results</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes well, that won't be any good then.<br/>
🎧 We'll only see the kids</span> for one or two hours at the most.<br/>
🎧 Yes, and we have to do the experiments</span> and write</span> up our results</span> within</span> a week,<br/>
🎧 so that one won't do at all.<br/>
🎧 Okay, well, what did you think of number four</span>?<br/>
🎧 I like the idea of it, but<br/></span>
🎧 do you think it will be a bit elementary</span> for them?<br/>
🎧 Well, they are only eight</span> you know!<br/>
🎧 I know, but you know what I mean.<br/>
🎧 Don't you think the activity</span> itself</span> is a bit babyish</span>?<br/>
🎧 Hmm</span>, maybe you're right.<br/>
🎧 They might have fun but, I mean, cutting</span> out a circle</span> and colouring</span> it in?<br/>
🎧 Okay, well, what about number five</span>?<br/>
🎧 I thought this one sounded</span> a bit too good to be true</span> -</span> great equipment</span>!<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 But don't you think it's a bit ambitious</span> for this age group?<br/>
🎧 I mean, I don't want to start off something and then have to abandon</span> it if they just can't cope</span> with it.<br/>
🎧 I could see us ending</span> up doing just about all of the work for them.<br/>
🎧 I guess</span> you're right.<br/>
🎧 Oh well, maybe we could store</span> that idea away for later.<br/>
🎧 Yep</span>, let's hope this second book has something better!<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Today we're going to look at one of my favourite</span> fish</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 the shark</span>.<br/>
🎧 As you know, sharks</span> have a reputation</span> for being very dangerous</span> creatures<br/></span>
🎧 capable</span> of injuring</span> or killing</span> humans</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I'd like to talk about sharks</span> in Australia</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sharks</span> are rather large fish</span>,<br/>
🎧 often growing</span> to over 10</span> metres<br/></span>
🎧 and the longest</span> sharks</span> caught</span> in Australia</span> have reached</span> sixteen</span> metres</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sharks</span> vary</span> in weight</span> with size and breed</span>, of course,<br/>
🎧 but the heaviest</span> shark</span> caught</span> in Australia</span> was a White</span> Pointer</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 that weighed</span> 795</span> kilograms</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 quite a size!<br/>
🎧 Sharks</span> have a different structure</span> to most fish:<br/></span>
🎧 instead</span> of a skeleton</span> made of bone</span>,<br/>
🎧 they have a tough elastic</span> skeleton</span> of cartilage</span>.<br/>
🎧 Unlike</span> bone</span>, this firm</span>, pliable</span> material</span> is rather like your nose</span>,<br/>
🎧 and allows</span> the shark</span> to bend</span> easily</span> as it swims</span>.<br/>
🎧 The shark's</span> skin</span> isn't covered</span> with scales</span>, like other fish</span>,<br/>
🎧 instead</span>, the skin's</span> covered</span> with barbs</span>, giving</span> it a rough</span> texture</span> like sandpaper</span>.<br/>
🎧 As you know, sharks</span> are very quick</span> swimmers</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is made possible</span> by their fins</span>,<br/>
🎧 one set at the side and another set underneath</span> the body</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the tail</span> also helps the shark</span> move forward quickly.<br/>
🎧 Unlike</span> other fish</span>,<br/>
🎧 sharks</span> have to keep swimming</span> if they want to stay</span> at a particular</span> depth</span>,<br/>
🎧 and they rarely</span> swim</span> at the surface</span>.<br/>
🎧 Mostly</span>, they swim</span> at the bottom</span> of the ocean</span>,<br/>
🎧 scavenging</span> and picking</span> up food that's lying</span> on the ocean</span> floor</span>.<br/>
🎧 While most other animals</span>, including</span> fish</span>, hunt</span> their prey</span> by means</span> of their eyesight</span>,<br/>
🎧 sharks</span> hunt</span> essentially</span> by smell</span>.<br/>
🎧 They have a very acute</span> sense</span> of smell</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 and can sense</span> the presence</span> of food long before they can see it.<br/>
🎧 In Australia</span>, where people spend</span> a lot of time at the beach</span>,<br/>
🎧 the government</span> has realised</span> that it must prevent</span> sharks</span> from swimming</span> near its beaches</span>.<br/>
🎧 As a result</span>, they've</span> introduced</span> a beach-netting</span> program</span>.<br/>
🎧 Beach-netting</span>, or meshing</span>, involves</span> setting</span> large nets</span> parallel</span> to the shore;<br/></span>
🎧 this means</span> that the nets</span> on New South</span> Wales</span> beaches</span> are set on one day,<br/>
🎧 and then lifted</span> and taken out to sea on the next day.<br/>
🎧 When shark-netting</span> first began</span> in 1939</span>,<br/>
🎧 only the Sydney</span> metropolitan</span> beaches</span> were meshed</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 these beaches</span> were chosen</span> because beaches</span> near the city</span> are usually the most crowded</span> with swimmers</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ten years later, in 1949</span>,<br/>
🎧 systematic</span> meshing</span> was extended</span> to include</span> the beaches</span> to the south</span> of Sydney</span>.<br/>
🎧 As a result</span> of the general</span> success of the program</span> in Sydney</span>,<br/>
🎧 shark-meshing</span> was introduced</span> to the state</span> of Queensland</span> around 1970</span>.<br/>
🎧 The New Zealand</span> authorities</span> also looked</span> at it,<br/>
🎧 but considered</span> meshing</span> uneconomical</span> -</span> as did Tahiti</span> in the Pacific</span>.<br/>
🎧 At around the same time, South</span> Africa</span> introduced</span> meshing</span> to some of its most popular</span> swimming</span> beaches</span>.<br/>
🎧 When meshing</span> began</span>, approximately</span> 1500</span> sharks</span> were caught</span> in the first year.<br/>
🎧 However</span>, this declined</span> in the years that followed</span>,<br/>
🎧 and since that time, the average</span> annual</span> catch has been only about 150</span> a year.<br/>
🎧 The majority</span> of sharks</span> are caught</span> during the warmest</span> months</span>, from November</span> to February</span>,<br/>
🎧 when sharks</span> are most active<br/></span>
🎧 and when both the air and the ocean</span> are at their maximum</span> temperature</span>.<br/>
🎧 Despite</span> quite large catches</span>,<br/>
🎧 some people believe</span> that shark</span> meshing</span> is not the best way to catch sharks</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's not that they think sharks</span> are afraid</span> of nets</span>, or because they eat holes</span> in them,<br/>
🎧 because neither</span> of these is true</span>.<br/>
🎧 But meshing</span> does appear</span> to be less effective</span> than some other methods</span>,<br/>
🎧 especially</span> when there are big seas</span> with high rolling</span> waves</span> and strong</span> currents<br/></span>
🎧 and anything that lets</span> the sand</span> move -<br/></span>
🎧 the sand</span> that's holding</span> the nets</span> down.<br/>
🎧 When this moves</span> the nets</span> will also become less effective</span>.<br/>
