🎧 Hi Tony, thanks ever so much for coming.<br/>
🎧 You know we've been asked to organise something for John's farewell?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, sure, it's about time we started working out details.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 We don't want to leave it so late that it's double the work.<br/>
🎧 Mmm, mm, right, do you want me to take notes?<br/>
🎧 That'd be great, thanks.<br/>
🎧 Right, first thing is,<br/>
🎧 when is the best time to hold it?<br/>
🎧 Well, he leaves on the 24th of December.<br/>
🎧 So what about the 22nd?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I think that's about right.<br/>
🎧 We want it quite near the time, don't we?<br/>
🎧 Sure, and what about a venue?<br/>
🎧 In college? A hotel?<br/>
🎧 I think a hotel will probably work out rather expensive,<br/>
🎧 and I've been looking at the College Dining Room.<br/>
🎧 That seems pretty reasonable.<br/>
🎧 Fine, yeah, why not?<br/>
🎧 And then we ought to be thinking about invitations...<br/>
🎧 Who mustn't we forget to invite?<br/>
🎧 Well, obviously John and his wife.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And the Director.<br/>
🎧 The office staff.<br/>
🎧 And all the teachers and all the students.<br/>
🎧 Anyone else?<br/>
🎧 Faculty Heads?<br/>
🎧 No, better draw the line, I don't think it's necessary.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, you're right.<br/>
🎧 I don't mind writing the invitations.<br/>
🎧 When shall we get them out for?<br/>
🎧 Enough time but not too early.<br/>
🎧 What about the fifteenth of December?<br/>
🎧 Well, there are exams on the 16th - better avoid them.<br/>
🎧 10th?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, that should do it.<br/>
🎧 So what does that leave?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, a present.<br/>
🎧 Would you mind doing that?<br/>
🎧 No, not at all;<br/>
🎧 we usually go round with an envelope during coffee break, don't we?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, coffee break's always the best time,<br/>
🎧 'cos people have got their money handy.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, exactly.<br/>
🎧 Do we suggest an amount?<br/>
🎧 Or does it seem a bit unfair?<br/>
🎧 No, I think people welcome it.<br/>
🎧 We suggested 6 dollars last time, is that okay?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, plenty, I would have thought,<br/>
🎧 which should leave us with about 90 dollars.<br/>
🎧 Have you any ideas for presents?<br/>
🎧 Well, I've been having a little think.<br/>
🎧 I thought...<br/>
🎧 you know, he loves music.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, and books.<br/>
🎧 So, I thought I'd check on prices for, well, perhaps CD players.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, that's a, that's a good idea,<br/>
🎧 and also I thought maybe, you know, a set of dictionaries.<br/>
🎧 I heard him say he needed a good one.<br/>
🎧 The other thing he was saying last week was that his computer printer had broken.<br/>
🎧 Umm. No, I'd be really frightened about getting the wrong type.<br/>
🎧 Okay, yeah.<br/>
🎧 The other thing is something for the home.<br/>
🎧 Jill suggested a coffee maker.<br/>
🎧 I'll certainly find out what they cost.<br/>
🎧 Okay, have you got all that down?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Now we need to think a little more about the money.<br/>
🎧 I know we've got a set amount from the Social Fund.<br/>
🎧 Right, what does that cover?<br/>
🎧 It's meant to cover the cost of the room.<br/>
🎧 And a certain amount for food.<br/>
🎧 And also drinks?<br/>
🎧 Oh yeah, certainly.<br/>
🎧 But will it be enough?<br/>
🎧 What we've done in the past is to ask guests to bring some snacks.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 We don't ask them to bring more drinks because we figure that's...<br/>
🎧 that should come from the Social Fund.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Anything else for the guests to bring?<br/>
🎧 Well, oh, some music,<br/>
🎧 because there'll be a tape deck there in the room, and we can have some dancing later on.<br/>
🎧 Anything else?<br/>
🎧 It's just a thought, but a couple of years ago we had a really good party where we set up...<br/>
🎧 you know, some simple games.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, great.<br/>
🎧 Wasn't it based on photos from the students and teachers?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 So we should ask the guests to bring photos.<br/>
🎧 Okay. I'll put it on the invitations.<br/>
🎧 Now the last thing is,<br/>
🎧 who shall we ask to do the speech?<br/>
🎧 Don't you think it might be nice to have one of the students?<br/>
🎧 Well then, the Student Leader?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, much better than the Director giving speeches again.<br/>
🎧 Okay then, I'll ask her.<br/>
🎧 Lovely!<br/>
🎧 So, is that all?<br/>
🎧 Looks like it.<br/>
🎧 Great! Thanks ever so much...<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Hi Sue.<br/>
🎧 Hi Mike.<br/>
🎧 So what happened to you last week?<br/>
🎧 Oh, I was sick with the flu.<br/>
🎧 What's this I hear about a big assignment we've got to do?<br/>
🎧 Oh, well, basically, we've got to find two science experiments<br/>
🎧 to do with a group of 8-year-old children at the local primary school,<br/>
🎧 and we've got to complete it by the end of the week.<br/>
🎧 That sounds like hard work.<br/>
🎧 Where are we supposed to get the ideas for these experiments from?<br/>
🎧 Well, I managed to get hold of two books from the library.<br/>
🎧 Oh, well done!<br/>
🎧 How about if we take a look at the experiments in this book first<br/>
🎧 and see if anything looks suitable?<br/>
🎧 I can make notes as we go, about equipment and the purpose of the experiments.<br/>
🎧 Okay, let's see...<br/>
🎧 the first experiment is called 'Make your own hovercraft',<br/>
🎧 which sounds very ambitious!<br/>
🎧 Mind you, you only need 20 balloons and a table -<br/>
🎧 you don't need any special engines or anything like that!<br/>
🎧 What do you do with it all?<br/>
🎧 Er, you blow up the balloons and you balance the table on them,<br/>
🎧 upside down of course, and the kids get to ride around on it.<br/>
🎧 You know, the other kids sort of push them around the room.<br/>
🎧 The main purpose is to show how hovercrafts work,<br/>
🎧 and how things hover around on just a cushion of air.<br/>
🎧 Okay, that doesn't sound too bad.<br/>
🎧 Okay, ready for number two?<br/>
🎧 Now this one is called 'Unusual Measures of Lengths',<br/>
🎧 and you basically use lots of paperclips.<br/>
🎧 The kids go around the class measuring things -<br/>
🎧 you know, how long the desk is, and that sort of thing,<br/>
🎧 and then they all compare their answers.<br/>
🎧 And, basically, because not all paperclips are the same lengths,<br/>
🎧 they should come up with some strange answers.<br/>
🎧 It's supposed to demonstrate the importance of having fixed units of measurement.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, that's not bad.<br/>
🎧 Okay, now for number three you need rock salt or copper sulphate.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I'm not sure about that!<br/>
🎧 Well, just put down the rock salt then...<br/>
🎧 apart from that you only need a jar of water.<br/>
🎧 And basically you dissolve lots of salt into the water<br/>
🎧 and watch the crystals form,<br/>
🎧 so it basically teaches the kids about growing crystals.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I suppose it would be nice to grow something.<br/>
🎧 Hmm, let's move on and have a look at number four.<br/>
🎧 Okay, this one is called 'Spinning colour wheel'.<br/>
🎧 It looks like you get some cardboard and draw a circle on it,<br/>
🎧 divide it into six equal segments and colour each one in using different colours,<br/>
🎧 then you thread a piece of string through the middle.<br/>
🎧 So we'd need some string as well.<br/>
🎧 Yes, sorry...<br/>
🎧 and you spin the wheel around<br/>
🎧 and if you can get it spinning fast enough,<br/>
🎧 hopefully the colours all merge and show up as white.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I didn't know that.<br/>
🎧 What's the principle behind it?<br/>
🎧 Well it's pretty elementary physics, really.<br/>
🎧 It teaches them about how white light or ordinary light is made up.<br/>
🎧 Hmm, well that doesn't sound too bad.<br/>
🎧 Now there's only one more left in this book isn't there?<br/>
🎧 What does that one say?<br/>
🎧 Um, well it's another one where they'd get to make something.<br/>
🎧 Sounds very interesting.<br/>
🎧 You need quite a lot of equipment actually -<br/>
🎧 a hand drill, an old record,<br/>
🎧 a pin or needle, some paper and a bolt.<br/>
🎧 Hmm, go on, what do they have to do?<br/>
🎧 Well, they basically make a record player.<br/>
🎧 The main idea is to teach them about recording sound,<br/>
🎧 but hopefully they'd also see that you need motion and an amplifier to make the sound heard.<br/>
🎧 Okay, well it does sound interesting.<br/>
🎧 Shall we go through all of those again and decide if any of them are going to be suitable?<br/>
🎧 Right, number one.<br/>
🎧 I thought this one sounded nice: there'd be lots of activity<br/>
🎧 and it doesn't need too much in the way of equipment.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's true, but...<br/>
🎧 don't you think it's a bit risky to get a group of 8-year-olds pushing each other around a classroom like that?<br/>
🎧 Someone could get hurt.<br/>
🎧 No, I don't like the sound of that one at all!<br/>
🎧 Maybe you're right.<br/>
🎧 What about number two, with the paperclips?<br/>
🎧 It sounds tame enough.<br/>
🎧 Yes, a bit too tame if you ask me.<br/>
🎧 I think it needs to be something a bit more active and interesting than that, don't you?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I suppose you're right.<br/>
🎧 We won't get a very good mark if the children don't actually enjoy the experiments,<br/>
🎧 and I suppose we could turn them off science for good!<br/>
🎧 Well, what about the next one, number three?<br/>
🎧 Now, I quite like the idea of this one.<br/>
🎧 Yes, so do I,<br/>
🎧 but I seem to remember when we did it at high school<br/>
🎧 we had to wait up to a fortnight before we saw any halfway decent results.<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes well, that won't be any good then.<br/>
🎧 We'll only see the kids for one or two hours at the most.<br/>
🎧 Yes, and we have to do the experiments and write up our results within a week,<br/>
🎧 so that one won't do at all.<br/>
🎧 Okay, well, what did you think of number four?<br/>
🎧 I like the idea of it, but<br/>
🎧 do you think it will be a bit elementary for them?<br/>
🎧 Well, they are only eight you know!<br/>
🎧 I know, but you know what I mean.<br/>
🎧 Don't you think the activity itself is a bit babyish?<br/>
🎧 Hmm, maybe you're right.<br/>
🎧 They might have fun but, I mean, cutting out a circle and colouring it in?<br/>
🎧 Okay, well, what about number five?<br/>
🎧 I thought this one sounded a bit too good to be true - great equipment!<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 But don't you think it's a bit ambitious for this age group?<br/>
🎧 I mean, I don't want to start off something and then have to abandon it if they just can't cope with it.<br/>
🎧 I could see us ending up doing just about all of the work for them.<br/>
🎧 I guess you're right.<br/>
🎧 Oh well, maybe we could store that idea away for later.<br/>
🎧 Yep, let's hope this second book has something better!<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Today we're going to look at one of my favourite fish -<br/>
🎧 the shark.<br/>
🎧 As you know, sharks have a reputation for being very dangerous creatures<br/>
🎧 capable of injuring or killing humans,<br/>
🎧 and I'd like to talk about sharks in Australia.<br/>
🎧 Sharks are rather large fish,<br/>
🎧 often growing to over 10 metres<br/>
🎧 and the longest sharks caught in Australia have reached sixteen metres.<br/>
🎧 Sharks vary in weight with size and breed, of course,<br/>
🎧 but the heaviest shark caught in Australia was a White Pointer -<br/>
🎧 that weighed 795 kilograms -<br/>
🎧 quite a size!<br/>
🎧 Sharks have a different structure to most fish:<br/>
🎧 instead of a skeleton made of bone,<br/>
🎧 they have a tough elastic skeleton of cartilage.<br/>
🎧 Unlike bone, this firm, pliable material is rather like your nose,<br/>
🎧 and allows the shark to bend easily as it swims.<br/>
🎧 The shark's skin isn't covered with scales, like other fish,<br/>
🎧 instead, the skin's covered with barbs, giving it a rough texture like sandpaper.<br/>
🎧 As you know, sharks are very quick swimmers.<br/>
🎧 This is made possible by their fins,<br/>
🎧 one set at the side and another set underneath the body,<br/>
🎧 and the tail also helps the shark move forward quickly.<br/>
🎧 Unlike other fish,<br/>
🎧 sharks have to keep swimming if they want to stay at a particular depth,<br/>
🎧 and they rarely swim at the surface.<br/>
🎧 Mostly, they swim at the bottom of the ocean,<br/>
🎧 scavenging and picking up food that's lying on the ocean floor.<br/>
🎧 While most other animals, including fish, hunt their prey by means of their eyesight,<br/>
🎧 sharks hunt essentially by smell.<br/>
🎧 They have a very acute sense of smell -<br/>
🎧 and can sense the presence of food long before they can see it.<br/>
🎧 In Australia, where people spend a lot of time at the beach,<br/>
🎧 the government has realised that it must prevent sharks from swimming near its beaches.<br/>
🎧 As a result, they've introduced a beach-netting program.<br/>
🎧 Beach-netting, or meshing, involves setting large nets parallel to the shore;<br/>
🎧 this means that the nets on New South Wales beaches are set on one day,<br/>
🎧 and then lifted and taken out to sea on the next day.<br/>
🎧 When shark-netting first began in 1939,<br/>
🎧 only the Sydney metropolitan beaches were meshed -<br/>
🎧 these beaches were chosen because beaches near the city are usually the most crowded with swimmers.<br/>
🎧 Ten years later, in 1949,<br/>
🎧 systematic meshing was extended to include the beaches to the south of Sydney.<br/>
🎧 As a result of the general success of the program in Sydney,<br/>
🎧 shark-meshing was introduced to the state of Queensland around 1970.<br/>
🎧 The New Zealand authorities also looked at it,<br/>
🎧 but considered meshing uneconomical - as did Tahiti in the Pacific.<br/>
🎧 At around the same time, South Africa introduced meshing to some of its most popular swimming beaches.<br/>
🎧 When meshing began, approximately 1500 sharks were caught in the first year.<br/>
🎧 However, this declined in the years that followed,<br/>
🎧 and since that time, the average annual catch has been only about 150 a year.<br/>
🎧 The majority of sharks are caught during the warmest months, from November to February,<br/>
🎧 when sharks are most active<br/>
🎧 and when both the air and the ocean are at their maximum temperature.<br/>
🎧 Despite quite large catches,<br/>
🎧 some people believe that shark meshing is not the best way to catch sharks.<br/>
🎧 It's not that they think sharks are afraid of nets, or because they eat holes in them,<br/>
🎧 because neither of these is true.<br/>
🎧 But meshing does appear to be less effective than some other methods,<br/>
🎧 especially when there are big seas with high rolling waves and strong currents<br/>
🎧 and anything that lets the sand move -<br/>
🎧 the sand that's holding the nets down.<br/>
🎧 When this moves the nets will also become less effective.<br/>
<br/><br/>
