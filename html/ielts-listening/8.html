🎧 Hi <span>Tony</span>, thanks ever so much for <span>coming</span>.<br/>
🎧 You know we've been <span>asked</span> to <span>organise</span> something for <span>John's</span> <span>farewell</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, sure, it's about time we <span>started</span> working out <span>details</span>.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 We don't want to leave it so <span>late</span> that it's <span>double</span> the work.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mmm</span>, <span>mm</span>, right, do you want me to take <span>notes</span>?<br/>
🎧 That'd be great, thanks.<br/>
🎧 Right, first thing is,<br/>
🎧 when is the best time to <span>hold</span> it?<br/>
🎧 Well, he leaves on the <span>24th</span> of <span>December</span>.<br/>
🎧 So what about the <span>22nd</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I think that's about right.<br/>
🎧 We want it quite near the time, don't we?<br/>
🎧 Sure, and what about a <span>venue</span>?<br/>
🎧 In <span>college</span>? A <span>hotel</span>?<br/>
🎧 I think a <span>hotel</span> will probably work out rather <span>expensive</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I've been looking at the <span>College</span> <span>Dining</span> Room.<br/>
🎧 That <span>seems</span> <span>pretty</span> <span>reasonable</span>.<br/>
🎧 Fine, yeah, why not?<br/>
🎧 And then we <span>ought</span> to be thinking about <span>invitations..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Who mustn't we <span>forget</span> to <span>invite</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>obviously</span> <span>John</span> and his <span>wife</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>Director</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>office</span> <span>staff</span>.<br/>
🎧 And all the <span>teachers</span> and all the students.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyone</span> else?<br/>
🎧 <span>Faculty</span> <span>Heads</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, better <span>draw</span> the <span>line</span>, I don't think it's <span>necessary</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, you're right.<br/>
🎧 I don't <span>mind</span> <span>writing</span> the <span>invitations</span>.<br/>
🎧 When shall we get them out for?<br/>
🎧 Enough time but not too <span>early</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about the <span>fifteenth</span> of <span>December</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, there are <span>exams</span> on the <span>16th</span> <span>-</span> better <span>avoid</span> them.<br/>
🎧 <span>10th</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, that should do it.<br/>
🎧 So what does that leave?<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, a <span>present</span>.<br/>
🎧 Would you <span>mind</span> doing that?<br/>
🎧 No, not at <span>all;<br/></span>
🎧 we usually go <span>round</span> with an <span>envelope</span> during <span>coffee</span> <span>break</span>, don't we?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, <span>coffee</span> <span>break's</span> always the best time,<br/>
🎧 <span>'cos</span> people have got their money <span>handy</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, exactly.<br/>
🎧 Do we <span>suggest</span> an amount?<br/>
🎧 Or does it <span>seem</span> a bit <span>unfair</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, I think people <span>welcome</span> it.<br/>
🎧 We <span>suggested</span> <span>6</span> <span>dollars</span> last time, is that okay?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, <span>plenty</span>, I would have thought,<br/>
🎧 which should leave us with about <span>90</span> <span>dollars</span>.<br/>
🎧 Have you any <span>ideas</span> for <span>presents</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I've been having a little think.<br/>
🎧 I <span>thought..</span>.<br/>
🎧 you know, he <span>loves</span> music.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, and books.<br/>
🎧 So, I thought I'd check on <span>prices</span> for, well, <span>perhaps</span> <span>CD</span> <span>players</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, that's a, that's a good idea,<br/>
🎧 and also I thought maybe, you know, a set of <span>dictionaries</span>.<br/>
🎧 I heard him say he <span>needed</span> a good one.<br/>
🎧 The other thing he was saying last week was that his <span>computer</span> <span>printer</span> had <span>broken</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Umm</span>. No, I'd be really <span>frightened</span> about getting the wrong <span>type</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, yeah.<br/>
🎧 The other thing is something for the home.<br/>
🎧 <span>Jill</span> <span>suggested</span> a <span>coffee</span> <span>maker</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll <span>certainly</span> find out what they <span>cost</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, have you got all that down?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Now we need to think a little more about the money.<br/>
🎧 I know we've got a set amount from the <span>Social</span> <span>Fund</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, what does that <span>cover</span>?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>meant</span> to <span>cover</span> the <span>cost</span> of the room.<br/>
🎧 And a <span>certain</span> amount for food.<br/>
🎧 And also <span>drinks</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh yeah, <span>certainly</span>.<br/>
🎧 But will it be enough?<br/>
🎧 What we've done in the <span>past</span> is to ask <span>guests</span> to <span>bring</span> some <span>snacks</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 We don't ask them to <span>bring</span> more <span>drinks</span> because we <span>figure</span> <span>that's..</span>.<br/>
🎧 that should come from the <span>Social</span> <span>Fund</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Anything else for the <span>guests</span> to <span>bring</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, oh, some music,<br/>
🎧 because <span>there'll</span> be a <span>tape</span> <span>deck</span> there in the room, and we can have some <span>dancing</span> later on.<br/>
🎧 Anything else?<br/>
🎧 It's just a thought, but a <span>couple</span> of years ago we had a really good <span>party</span> where we set <span>up..</span>.<br/>
🎧 you know, some simple <span>games</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, great.<br/>
🎧 Wasn't it <span>based</span> on <span>photos</span> from the students and <span>teachers</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 So we should ask the <span>guests</span> to <span>bring</span> <span>photos</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay. I'll put it on the <span>invitations</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now the last thing is,<br/>
🎧 who shall we ask to do the <span>speech</span>?<br/>
🎧 Don't you think it might be nice to have one of the students?<br/>
🎧 Well then, the <span>Student</span> <span>Leader</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, much better than the <span>Director</span> <span>giving</span> <span>speeches</span> again.<br/>
🎧 Okay then, I'll ask her.<br/>
🎧 <span>Lovely</span>!<br/>
🎧 So, is that all?<br/>
🎧 Looks like it.<br/>
🎧 Great! Thanks ever so <span>much..</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Hi <span>Sue</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hi <span>Mike</span>.<br/>
🎧 So what <span>happened</span> to you last week?<br/>
🎧 Oh, I was <span>sick</span> with the <span>flu</span>.<br/>
🎧 What's this I hear about a big <span>assignment</span> we've got to do?<br/>
🎧 Oh, well, <span>basically</span>, we've got to find two <span>science</span> <span>experiments<br/></span>
🎧 to do with a group of <span>8-year-old</span> children at the <span>local</span> <span>primary</span> school,<br/>
🎧 and we've got to <span>complete</span> it by the end of the week.<br/>
🎧 That sounds like <span>hard</span> work.<br/>
🎧 Where are we <span>supposed</span> to get the <span>ideas</span> for these <span>experiments</span> from?<br/>
🎧 Well, I <span>managed</span> to get <span>hold</span> of two books from the <span>library</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, well done!<br/>
🎧 How about if we take a look at the <span>experiments</span> in this book <span>first<br/></span>
🎧 and see if anything looks <span>suitable</span>?<br/>
🎧 I can make <span>notes</span> as we go, about <span>equipment</span> and the <span>purpose</span> of the <span>experiments</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, let's <span>see..</span>.<br/>
🎧 the first <span>experiment</span> is called <span>'Make</span> your own <span>hovercraft'</span>,<br/>
🎧 which sounds very <span>ambitious</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Mind</span> you, you only need <span>20</span> <span>balloons</span> and a <span>table</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 you don't need any special <span>engines</span> or anything like that!<br/>
🎧 What do you do with it all?<br/>
🎧 <span>Er</span>, you <span>blow</span> up the <span>balloons</span> and you <span>balance</span> the <span>table</span> on them,<br/>
🎧 <span>upside</span> down of course, and the <span>kids</span> get to <span>ride</span> around on it.<br/>
🎧 You know, the other <span>kids</span> <span>sort</span> of <span>push</span> them around the room.<br/>
🎧 The <span>main</span> <span>purpose</span> is to show how <span>hovercrafts</span> work,<br/>
🎧 and how things <span>hover</span> around on just a <span>cushion</span> of air.<br/>
🎧 Okay, that doesn't sound too bad.<br/>
🎧 Okay, ready for number two?<br/>
🎧 Now this one is called <span>'Unusual</span> <span>Measures</span> of <span>Lengths'</span>,<br/>
🎧 and you <span>basically</span> use lots of <span>paperclips</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>kids</span> go around the class <span>measuring</span> things <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 you know, how long the <span>desk</span> is, and that <span>sort</span> of thing,<br/>
🎧 and then they all <span>compare</span> their <span>answers</span>.<br/>
🎧 And, <span>basically</span>, because not all <span>paperclips</span> are the same <span>lengths</span>,<br/>
🎧 they should come up with some <span>strange</span> <span>answers</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>supposed</span> to <span>demonstrate</span> the <span>importance</span> of having <span>fixed</span> <span>units</span> of <span>measurement</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, that's not bad.<br/>
🎧 Okay, now for number <span>three</span> you need <span>rock</span> <span>salt</span> or <span>copper</span> <span>sulphate</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I'm not sure about that!<br/>
🎧 Well, just put down the <span>rock</span> <span>salt</span> <span>then..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>apart</span> from that you only need a <span>jar</span> of water.<br/>
🎧 And <span>basically</span> you <span>dissolve</span> lots of <span>salt</span> into the <span>water<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>watch</span> the <span>crystals</span> <span>form</span>,<br/>
🎧 so it <span>basically</span> <span>teaches</span> the <span>kids</span> about <span>growing</span> <span>crystals</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I <span>suppose</span> it would be nice to <span>grow</span> something.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, let's move on and have a look at number <span>four</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, this one is called <span>'Spinning</span> <span>colour</span> <span>wheel'</span>.<br/>
🎧 It looks like you get some <span>cardboard</span> and <span>draw</span> a <span>circle</span> on it,<br/>
🎧 <span>divide</span> it into six <span>equal</span> <span>segments</span> and <span>colour</span> each one in <span>using</span> different <span>colours</span>,<br/>
🎧 then you <span>thread</span> a <span>piece</span> of <span>string</span> through the <span>middle</span>.<br/>
🎧 So we'd need some <span>string</span> as well.<br/>
🎧 Yes, <span>sorry..</span>.<br/>
🎧 and you <span>spin</span> the <span>wheel</span> <span>around<br/></span>
🎧 and if you can get it <span>spinning</span> <span>fast</span> enough,<br/>
🎧 <span>hopefully</span> the <span>colours</span> all <span>merge</span> and show up as <span>white</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I didn't know that.<br/>
🎧 What's the <span>principle</span> behind it?<br/>
🎧 Well it's <span>pretty</span> <span>elementary</span> <span>physics</span>, really.<br/>
🎧 It <span>teaches</span> them about how <span>white</span> <span>light</span> or <span>ordinary</span> <span>light</span> is made up.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, well that doesn't sound too bad.<br/>
🎧 Now there's only one more <span>left</span> in this book isn't there?<br/>
🎧 What does that one say?<br/>
🎧 <span>Um</span>, well it's another one where they'd get to make something.<br/>
🎧 Sounds very <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 You need quite a lot of <span>equipment</span> actually <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 a <span>hand</span> <span>drill</span>, an old <span>record</span>,<br/>
🎧 a <span>pin</span> or <span>needle</span>, some <span>paper</span> and a <span>bolt</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, go on, what do they have to do?<br/>
🎧 Well, they <span>basically</span> make a <span>record</span> <span>player</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>main</span> idea is to <span>teach</span> them about <span>recording</span> sound,<br/>
🎧 but <span>hopefully</span> they'd also see that you need <span>motion</span> and an <span>amplifier</span> to make the sound heard.<br/>
🎧 Okay, well it does sound <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 Shall we go through all of those again and decide if any of them are going to be <span>suitable</span>?<br/>
🎧 Right, number one.<br/>
🎧 I thought this one <span>sounded</span> <span>nice:</span> <span>there'd</span> be lots of <span>activity<br/></span>
🎧 and it doesn't need too much in the way of <span>equipment</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's <span>true</span>, <span>but..</span>.<br/>
🎧 don't you think it's a bit <span>risky</span> to get a group of <span>8-year-olds</span> <span>pushing</span> each other around a <span>classroom</span> like that?<br/>
🎧 <span>Someone</span> could get <span>hurt</span>.<br/>
🎧 No, I don't like the sound of that one at all!<br/>
🎧 Maybe you're right.<br/>
🎧 What about number two, with the <span>paperclips</span>?<br/>
🎧 It sounds <span>tame</span> enough.<br/>
🎧 Yes, a bit too <span>tame</span> if you ask me.<br/>
🎧 I think it needs to be something a bit more <span>active</span> and <span>interesting</span> than that, don't you?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I <span>suppose</span> you're right.<br/>
🎧 We won't get a very good <span>mark</span> if the children don't actually enjoy the <span>experiments</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I <span>suppose</span> we could <span>turn</span> them off <span>science</span> for good!<br/>
🎧 Well, what about the next one, number <span>three</span>?<br/>
🎧 Now, I quite like the idea of this one.<br/>
🎧 Yes, so do I,<br/>
🎧 but I <span>seem</span> to remember when we did it at high <span>school<br/></span>
🎧 we had to wait up to a <span>fortnight</span> before we saw any <span>halfway</span> <span>decent</span> <span>results</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes well, that won't be any good then.<br/>
🎧 We'll only see the <span>kids</span> for one or two hours at the most.<br/>
🎧 Yes, and we have to do the <span>experiments</span> and <span>write</span> up our <span>results</span> <span>within</span> a week,<br/>
🎧 so that one won't do at all.<br/>
🎧 Okay, well, what did you think of number <span>four</span>?<br/>
🎧 I like the idea of it, <span>but<br/></span>
🎧 do you think it will be a bit <span>elementary</span> for them?<br/>
🎧 Well, they are only <span>eight</span> you know!<br/>
🎧 I know, but you know what I mean.<br/>
🎧 Don't you think the <span>activity</span> <span>itself</span> is a bit <span>babyish</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, maybe you're right.<br/>
🎧 They might have fun but, I mean, <span>cutting</span> out a <span>circle</span> and <span>colouring</span> it in?<br/>
🎧 Okay, well, what about number <span>five</span>?<br/>
🎧 I thought this one <span>sounded</span> a bit too good to be <span>true</span> <span>-</span> great <span>equipment</span>!<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 But don't you think it's a bit <span>ambitious</span> for this age group?<br/>
🎧 I mean, I don't want to start off something and then have to <span>abandon</span> it if they just can't <span>cope</span> with it.<br/>
🎧 I could see us <span>ending</span> up doing just about all of the work for them.<br/>
🎧 I <span>guess</span> you're right.<br/>
🎧 Oh well, maybe we could <span>store</span> that idea away for later.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yep</span>, let's hope this second book has something better!<br/>

🎧 Today we're going to look at one of my <span>favourite</span> <span>fish</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>shark</span>.<br/>
🎧 As you know, <span>sharks</span> have a <span>reputation</span> for being very <span>dangerous</span> <span>creatures<br/></span>
🎧 <span>capable</span> of <span>injuring</span> or <span>killing</span> <span>humans</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I'd like to talk about <span>sharks</span> in <span>Australia</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sharks</span> are rather large <span>fish</span>,<br/>
🎧 often <span>growing</span> to over <span>10</span> <span>metres<br/></span>
🎧 and the <span>longest</span> <span>sharks</span> <span>caught</span> in <span>Australia</span> have <span>reached</span> <span>sixteen</span> <span>metres</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sharks</span> <span>vary</span> in <span>weight</span> with size and <span>breed</span>, of course,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>heaviest</span> <span>shark</span> <span>caught</span> in <span>Australia</span> was a <span>White</span> <span>Pointer</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 that <span>weighed</span> <span>795</span> <span>kilograms</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 quite a size!<br/>
🎧 <span>Sharks</span> have a different <span>structure</span> to most <span>fish:<br/></span>
🎧 <span>instead</span> of a <span>skeleton</span> made of <span>bone</span>,<br/>
🎧 they have a tough <span>elastic</span> <span>skeleton</span> of <span>cartilage</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Unlike</span> <span>bone</span>, this <span>firm</span>, <span>pliable</span> <span>material</span> is rather like your <span>nose</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>allows</span> the <span>shark</span> to <span>bend</span> <span>easily</span> as it <span>swims</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>shark's</span> <span>skin</span> isn't <span>covered</span> with <span>scales</span>, like other <span>fish</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>instead</span>, the <span>skin's</span> <span>covered</span> with <span>barbs</span>, <span>giving</span> it a <span>rough</span> <span>texture</span> like <span>sandpaper</span>.<br/>
🎧 As you know, <span>sharks</span> are very <span>quick</span> <span>swimmers</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is made <span>possible</span> by their <span>fins</span>,<br/>
🎧 one set at the side and another set <span>underneath</span> the <span>body</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>tail</span> also helps the <span>shark</span> move forward quickly.<br/>
🎧 <span>Unlike</span> other <span>fish</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>sharks</span> have to keep <span>swimming</span> if they want to <span>stay</span> at a <span>particular</span> <span>depth</span>,<br/>
🎧 and they <span>rarely</span> <span>swim</span> at the <span>surface</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mostly</span>, they <span>swim</span> at the <span>bottom</span> of the <span>ocean</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>scavenging</span> and <span>picking</span> up food that's <span>lying</span> on the <span>ocean</span> <span>floor</span>.<br/>
🎧 While most other <span>animals</span>, <span>including</span> <span>fish</span>, <span>hunt</span> their <span>prey</span> by <span>means</span> of their <span>eyesight</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>sharks</span> <span>hunt</span> <span>essentially</span> by <span>smell</span>.<br/>
🎧 They have a very <span>acute</span> <span>sense</span> of <span>smell</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and can <span>sense</span> the <span>presence</span> of food long before they can see it.<br/>
🎧 In <span>Australia</span>, where people <span>spend</span> a lot of time at the <span>beach</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>government</span> has <span>realised</span> that it must <span>prevent</span> <span>sharks</span> from <span>swimming</span> near its <span>beaches</span>.<br/>
🎧 As a <span>result</span>, <span>they've</span> <span>introduced</span> a <span>beach-netting</span> <span>program</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Beach-netting</span>, or <span>meshing</span>, <span>involves</span> <span>setting</span> large <span>nets</span> <span>parallel</span> to the <span>shore;<br/></span>
🎧 this <span>means</span> that the <span>nets</span> on New <span>South</span> <span>Wales</span> <span>beaches</span> are set on one day,<br/>
🎧 and then <span>lifted</span> and taken out to sea on the next day.<br/>
🎧 When <span>shark-netting</span> first <span>began</span> in <span>1939</span>,<br/>
🎧 only the <span>Sydney</span> <span>metropolitan</span> <span>beaches</span> were <span>meshed</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 these <span>beaches</span> were <span>chosen</span> because <span>beaches</span> near the <span>city</span> are usually the most <span>crowded</span> with <span>swimmers</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ten years later, in <span>1949</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>systematic</span> <span>meshing</span> was <span>extended</span> to <span>include</span> the <span>beaches</span> to the <span>south</span> of <span>Sydney</span>.<br/>
🎧 As a <span>result</span> of the <span>general</span> success of the <span>program</span> in <span>Sydney</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>shark-meshing</span> was <span>introduced</span> to the <span>state</span> of <span>Queensland</span> around <span>1970</span>.<br/>
🎧 The New <span>Zealand</span> <span>authorities</span> also <span>looked</span> at it,<br/>
🎧 but <span>considered</span> <span>meshing</span> <span>uneconomical</span> <span>-</span> as did <span>Tahiti</span> in the <span>Pacific</span>.<br/>
🎧 At around the same time, <span>South</span> <span>Africa</span> <span>introduced</span> <span>meshing</span> to some of its most <span>popular</span> <span>swimming</span> <span>beaches</span>.<br/>
🎧 When <span>meshing</span> <span>began</span>, <span>approximately</span> <span>1500</span> <span>sharks</span> were <span>caught</span> in the first year.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, this <span>declined</span> in the years that <span>followed</span>,<br/>
🎧 and since that time, the <span>average</span> <span>annual</span> catch has been only about <span>150</span> a year.<br/>
🎧 The <span>majority</span> of <span>sharks</span> are <span>caught</span> during the <span>warmest</span> <span>months</span>, from <span>November</span> to <span>February</span>,<br/>
🎧 when <span>sharks</span> are most <span>active<br/></span>
🎧 and when both the air and the <span>ocean</span> are at their <span>maximum</span> <span>temperature</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Despite</span> quite large <span>catches</span>,<br/>
🎧 some people <span>believe</span> that <span>shark</span> <span>meshing</span> is not the best way to catch <span>sharks</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's not that they think <span>sharks</span> are <span>afraid</span> of <span>nets</span>, or because they eat <span>holes</span> in them,<br/>
🎧 because <span>neither</span> of these is <span>true</span>.<br/>
🎧 But <span>meshing</span> does <span>appear</span> to be less <span>effective</span> than some other <span>methods</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>especially</span> when there are big <span>seas</span> with high <span>rolling</span> <span>waves</span> and <span>strong</span> <span>currents<br/></span>
🎧 and anything that <span>lets</span> the <span>sand</span> move <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>sand</span> that's <span>holding</span> the <span>nets</span> down.<br/>
🎧 When this <span>moves</span> the <span>nets</span> will also become less <span>effective</span>.<br/>
