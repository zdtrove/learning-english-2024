🎧 Can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I've just <span>moved</span> to this <span>area</span> with my <span>wife</span> and <span>children<br/></span>
🎧 and I'd like to know where we can all <span>register</span> with a <span>doctor</span> at a <span>Health</span> <span>Centre</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Well, there's <span>Doctor</span> <span>Green</span> at The <span>Harvey</span> <span>Clinic</span>.<br/>
🎧 We always <span>recommend</span> her for <span>babies</span>, because she's very good with them and she <span>runs</span> a special <span>clinic</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh..</span>. actually my <span>youngest</span> <span>child</span> is <span>five</span>, so that wouldn't be any good for us.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Is there <span>anywhere</span> else I could try?<br/>
🎧 Yes, the <span>Eshcol</span> <span>Health</span> Practice is the next one on my <span>list</span>.<br/>
🎧 How do you <span>spell</span> that?<br/>
🎧 <span>ESHCOL</span>.<br/>
🎧 And it's <span>Doctor</span> <span>Fuller</span>, who has <span>space</span> on his <span>list</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>clinic</span> only <span>opened</span> a year ago, so the <span>facilities</span> are all very <span>modern</span>.<br/>
🎧 That sounds good.<br/>
🎧 And it's <span>particularly</span> good if you're <span>busy</span> during the day,<br/>
🎧 because they also do <span>appointments</span> in the <span>evening</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're <span>closed</span> on <span>Saturday</span>, though.<br/>
🎧 The only other place on the <span>list</span> is the <span>Health</span> <span>Centre</span> on <span>Shore</span> <span>Lane</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can <span>register</span> with <span>Doctor</span> <span>Gormley</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's <span>GORMLEY</span>.<br/>
🎧 He's new there, but the <span>centre</span> has a very good <span>reputation</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, I think I know the <span>road</span>.<br/>
🎧 That would be the best one.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Could you tell me, will all their <span>services</span> be free?<br/>
🎧 <span>Erm..</span>. there are usually some small <span>charges</span> that <span>doctors</span> make.<br/>
🎧 Let me see what it says about the <span>Shore</span> <span>Lane</span> <span>Centre</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you need to be <span>vaccinated</span> before any <span>trips</span> <span>abroad</span>, you won't have to pay for this.<br/>
🎧 <span>Erm</span>, what else?<br/>
🎧 The <span>sports</span> <span>injury</span> <span>treatment</span> <span>service</span> <span>operates</span> on a <span>paying</span> <span>basis</span>,<br/>
🎧 as does the <span>nutritional</span> <span>therapy</span> <span>service</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>health</span> <span>centres</span> do <span>offer</span> <span>alternative</span> <span>therapies</span> like <span>homeopathy</span> as <span>part</span> of their <span>pay-to-use</span> <span>service</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Shore</span> <span>Lane</span> are <span>hoping</span> to do this soon.<br/>
🎧 I think they may start with <span>acupuncture</span>.<br/>
🎧 And finally, if you need to <span>prove</span> you're <span>healthy<br/></span>
🎧 or haven't had any serious <span>injuries</span> before a new <span>employer</span> will <span>accept</span> you,<br/>
🎧 you can get a free <span>fitness</span> <span>check-up</span> there,<br/>
🎧 but you'd most <span>likely</span> have to pay for <span>insurance</span> <span>medicals</span> though.<br/>
🎧 Okay, thanks.<br/>
🎧 You might also be interested to know the <span>Centre</span> is <span>running</span> a <span>pilot</span> <span>scheme</span> of <span>talks</span> for <span>patients</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've got the <span>list</span> here.<br/>
🎧 Actually, they look very <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 What <span>sort</span> of things?<br/>
🎧 Well, the first <span>one's</span> about <span>giving</span> up <span>smoking</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's next week, the <span>twenty-fifth</span> of <span>February</span>, at <span>7</span> pm,<br/>
🎧 and that's in Room <span>4</span>.<br/>
🎧 It says, the talk will <span>stress</span> the <span>health</span> <span>benefits</span>, <span>particularly</span> for people with <span>asthma</span> or <span>heart</span> <span>disease</span>.<br/>
🎧 That sounds very <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's also a talk for <span>families</span> with children.<br/>
🎧 It's on <span>Healthy</span> <span>Eating</span>, and takes place on the first of <span>March</span> at <span>five</span> <span>o'clock</span>.<br/>
🎧 Will that be at the <span>Health</span> <span>Centre</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Erm</span>, actually it's at the <span>primary</span> school on <span>Shore</span> <span>Lane</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>imagine</span> they're <span>inviting</span> the <span>parents</span> of <span>pupils</span> there <span>-</span> it says here <span>'all</span> <span>welcome'</span>.<br/>
🎧 I might go to that if I have time.<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>couple</span> of other <span>talks</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 one <span>giving</span> advice about how to <span>avoid</span> <span>injuries</span> while doing <span>exercise</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's on the <span>ninth</span> of <span>March</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, it's a <span>late</span> <span>afternoon</span> talk, at <span>4:30<br/></span>
🎧 and it'll be in Room <span>6</span>.<br/>
🎧 It also says the talk is <span>suitable</span> for all <span>ages</span>.<br/>
🎧 And finally, there's a talk called <span>'Stress</span> <span>Management'..</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Hello?<br/>
🎧 Hi. It's <span>Laura</span> <span>Cariton</span> here.<br/>
🎧 We've just <span>arrived</span> at the <span>holiday</span> <span>flat</span>, but I can't get the hot water and <span>heating</span> to work.<br/>
🎧 Oh right!<br/>
🎧 That's easy.<br/>
🎧 Don't <span>worry</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>upstairs</span> <span>cupboard</span>, you'll find the water <span>heater</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll see <span>three</span> <span>main</span> <span>controls</span> on the <span>left</span> at the <span>bottom</span> of the <span>heater</span>.<br/>
🎧 The first one <span>-</span> the <span>round</span> one on the <span>far</span> <span>left</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 is the most important one for the <span>heating</span> and hot water.<br/>
🎧 It's the <span>main</span> <span>control</span> <span>switch</span>.<br/>
🎧 Make sure it's in the <span>'on'</span> <span>position</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>switch</span> <span>itself</span> doesn't <span>light</span> up.<br/>
🎧 But the little <span>square</span> <span>below</span> will be <span>black</span> if the <span>switch</span> is <span>'off'</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's probably what's <span>happened</span> <span>-</span> it's got <span>switched</span> off by <span>mistake</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>middle</span> one of these <span>three</span> <span>controls</span> <span>-</span> you'll see it's <span>slightly</span> <span>larger</span> than the first one <span>-</span> <span>controls</span> the <span>radiators</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you feel <span>cold</span> while you're there and need the <span>radiators</span> on,<br/>
🎧 this needs to be <span>turned</span> to <span>maximum</span>.<br/>
🎧 The last of the <span>three</span> <span>controls</span> <span>-</span> the one on the right <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 is usually on about a number <span>four</span> <span>setting</span> which, for the water in the <span>taps</span>, is usually quite hot enough.<br/>
🎧 <span>Below</span> the <span>heating</span> <span>controls</span> in the <span>middle</span> is a small <span>round</span> <span>plastic</span> <span>button</span>.<br/>
🎧 If there isn't enough water in the <span>pipes</span>, sometimes the <span>heater</span> <span>goes</span> out.<br/>
🎧 If this <span>happens</span> you'll need to <span>press</span> this <span>button</span> to <span>reset</span> the <span>heater</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hold</span> it in for about <span>five</span> <span>seconds<br/></span>
🎧 and the <span>heater</span> should come on again.<br/>
🎧 Then there's a little <span>square</span> <span>indicator</span> under the <span>third</span> <span>knob</span> that's a kind of <span>alarm</span> <span>light</span>.<br/>
🎧 It'll <span>flash</span> if you need to <span>reset</span> the <span>heater</span>.<br/>
🎧 It sounds <span>complicated..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you won't have any <span>problems</span> with it.<br/>
🎧 There should be some more <span>instructions</span> on the side of the <span>heater</span>.<br/>
🎧 Call me back if you can't make it work.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 While you're on the phone, we haven't <span>managed</span> to find a few things we need,<br/>
🎧 like <span>extra</span> <span>pillows</span> for the <span>beds</span> and some <span>washing</span> <span>powder</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is there any here?<br/>
🎧 <span>Pillows..</span>. yes.<br/>
🎧 If you look in the <span>cupboard</span>,<br/>
🎧 the large <span>white</span> one <span>upstairs</span> <span>-</span> to the <span>left</span> of the <span>bathroom</span> <span>door</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 there should be <span>four</span> or <span>five</span> on the top <span>shelf</span>.<br/>
🎧 And if you want to do some <span>washing</span>,<br/>
🎧 there's some <span>powder</span> for <span>that..</span>.<br/>
🎧 probably by the back <span>door</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's a kind of <span>shelf</span> there <span>above</span> the <span>sink</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, I'm sure there's some there, in a large <span>blue</span> box.<br/>
🎧 You need about <span>half</span> a cup full for each <span>wash</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh..</span>. and that <span>reminds</span> me,<br/>
🎧 the <span>spare</span> key to the back <span>door</span> is <span>hanging</span> on a <span>hook</span> on the <span>wall</span> by the <span>sitting</span> room <span>window</span>.<br/>
🎧 Please make sure to put it back when you've used it.<br/>
🎧 The <span>previous</span> <span>guests</span> <span>lost</span> it in the garden and I had to get another one made.<br/>
🎧 And, if you have any <span>trouble</span> with the <span>lamps</span>.<br/>
🎧 you'll find some <span>spare</span> <span>bulbs</span> in a large <span>cardboard</span> box.<br/>
🎧 It's on top of the <span>washing</span> <span>machine</span> with all <span>kinds</span> of useful things in it.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and another thing I <span>forgot</span> to <span>mention</span> when we last <span>spoke..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes?<br/>
🎧 I've <span>left</span> you a <span>local</span> map, so you'll be able to find your way around <span>easily</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>shows</span> the whole <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 I put it in the top <span>drawer</span> of the <span>chest</span> under the <span>TV</span> in your <span>bedroom</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's a whole <span>file</span> of <span>local</span> <span>information</span> in there too.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 What about <span>visiting</span> the <span>town</span>?<br/>
🎧 Can you give us any advice?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 You'll need to take the car.<br/>
🎧 It's too <span>far</span> to <span>walk</span> from the <span>flat</span> really.<br/>
🎧 You have to pay to leave your car in all the car <span>parks</span> now I'm <span>afraid..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I like the one that's by the <span>station</span> <span>best<br/></span>
🎧 and you can <span>walk</span> to the <span>town</span> <span>centre</span> from there in <span>five</span> <span>minutes</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's where all the best <span>restaurants</span> are.<br/>
🎧 But if you want a <span>takeaway</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>Italian</span> one does really good <span>pasta</span> and <span>pizzas</span>.<br/>
🎧 Call <span>732281</span> for that one,<br/>
🎧 or <span>766119</span> for the <span>Chinese</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're both good and they'll both <span>deliver</span> to the <span>flat</span>.<br/>
🎧 As for <span>places</span> to visit,<br/>
🎧 yes, do go and see the <span>railway</span> <span>museum</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>exhibition</span> is small but really good.<br/>
🎧 It <span>gets</span> very <span>crowded</span> on <span>Sundays</span>,<br/>
🎧 so I <span>suggest</span> you visit it on a <span>quieter</span> day, later in the week,<br/>
🎧 but not on <span>Thursdays</span> which is <span>market</span> day <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 you won't find <span>anywhere</span> to <span>park<br/></span>
🎧 and it's also the only day of the week when they're not open!<br/>
🎧 Anything else?<br/>
🎧 Not for the <span>moment</span>. Thanks!<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Hello, <span>Kira</span>, how are you?<br/>
🎧 Fine thanks, <span>Paul</span>, how are you?<br/>
🎧 Well, thanks.<br/>
🎧 It's good to see you.<br/>
🎧 It must be <span>12</span> <span>months</span> since you did our course?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 It's nice to come back and say hello.<br/>
🎧 What course did you <span>enroll</span> in?<br/>
🎧 Actually, I went <span>straight</span> into <span>third</span> year <span>Pharmacy</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>credited</span> me with two years, which probably made it more <span>difficult</span> for me.<br/>
🎧 On the other <span>hand</span>, you were <span>lucky</span> to be <span>granted</span> <span>credits</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is that why you <span>chose</span> the course?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 And, as I'd already <span>finished</span> a course in it in my <span>country</span>.<br/>
🎧 I thought it would be <span>easier</span> if I <span>studied</span> something I already <span>knew</span>.<br/>
🎧 I didn't <span>realise</span> you went into <span>third</span> year.<br/>
🎧 I thought you <span>started</span> in first year.<br/>
🎧 No <span>wonder</span> it was so <span>hard</span>!<br/>
🎧 And what do you think is one of the big <span>differences</span> between <span>studying</span> at a university here and <span>studying</span> in your <span>country</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I've <span>found</span> it very <span>difficult</span> to <span>write</span> <span>assignments</span>,<br/>
🎧 because I wasn't <span>familiar</span> with that <span>aspect</span> of the <span>system</span> here.<br/>
🎧 The <span>main</span> <span>problem</span> is that the <span>lecturers</span> <span>expect</span> you to be <span>critical</span>.<br/>
🎧 That made me feel really <span>terrible</span>.<br/>
🎧 I thought <span>"How</span> can I <span>possibly</span> do <span>it?"<br/></span>
🎧 <span>"How</span> can I <span>comment</span> on <span>someone</span> <span>else's</span> <span>research</span> when they probably <span>spent</span> <span>five</span> years doing <span>it?"<br/></span>
🎧 I think a lot of people who come from <span>overseas</span> <span>countries</span> have <span>similar</span> <span>problems</span>.<br/>
🎧 But after a while, it <span>became</span> <span>easier</span> for me.<br/>
🎧 People <span>expect</span> you to have <span>problems</span> with the <span>process</span> of <span>reading</span> and <span>writing<br/></span>
🎧 but, in <span>fact</span>, it is more a <span>question</span> of <span>altering</span> your <span>viewpoint</span> <span>towards</span> <span>academic</span> <span>study</span>.<br/>
🎧 How was the <span>content</span> of the <span>lectures</span>?<br/>
🎧 Was it easy for you?<br/>
🎧 I didn't really have many <span>problems</span> <span>understanding</span> <span>lectures</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>content</span> was very <span>similar</span> to what I'd <span>studied</span> before.<br/>
🎧 And what about the <span>lecturers</span> <span>themselves</span>?<br/>
🎧 Are they <span>essentially</span> the same as <span>lecturers</span> in your <span>country</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, actually, no.<br/>
🎧 Here, they're much <span>easier</span> to <span>approach</span>.<br/>
🎧 After every <span>lecture</span>, you can go and ask them something you didn't <span>understand</span>.<br/>
🎧 Or you can make an <span>appointment</span> and talk to them about anything in the course.<br/>
🎧 Maybe you <span>found</span> them different because you're a more <span>mature</span> student now,<br/>
🎧 <span>whereas</span> when you were <span>studying</span> in your <span>country</span>, you were <span>younger</span> and not so <span>assertive</span>.<br/>
🎧 No, I don't think that's the <span>difference</span>.<br/>
🎧 Most of the students here do it.<br/>
🎧 In my <span>faculty</span>, they all <span>seem</span> to make <span>appointments</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 usually to talk about something in the course that's <span>worrying</span> them,<br/>
🎧 but sometimes just about something that might really <span>interest</span> them,<br/>
🎧 something they might want to <span>specialise</span> in.<br/>
🎧 The <span>lecturers</span> must set <span>aside</span> <span>certain</span> <span>times</span> every week when they're <span>available</span> for students.<br/>
🎧 That's good to hear.<br/>
🎧 And how was your <span>timetable</span>?<br/>
🎧 Was it a very <span>busy</span> year?<br/>
🎧 Very, very <span>busy</span>.<br/>
🎧 They make you work very <span>hard</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Apart</span> from <span>lectures</span>, we had <span>practical</span> <span>sessions</span> in a lot of <span>subjects</span>.<br/>
🎧 We did these in small <span>groups</span>.<br/>
🎧 I had to go and work <span>four</span> hours every week in a <span>community</span> <span>pharmacy</span>.<br/>
🎧 Actually, I <span>enjoyed</span> this very much <span>-</span> <span>meeting</span> new people all the time.<br/>
🎧 Then in second <span>semester</span>, we had to get <span>experience</span> in <span>hospital</span> <span>dispensaries</span>,<br/>
🎧 so every second day we went to one of the big <span>hospitals</span> and <span>worked</span> there.<br/>
🎧 And on top of all that we had our <span>assignments</span>,<br/>
🎧 which took me a lot of time.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I <span>nearly</span> <span>forgot</span>, between first and second <span>semesters</span>,<br/>
🎧 we had to work <span>full-time</span> for two <span>weeks</span> in a <span>hospital</span>.<br/>
🎧 That does sound a very <span>heavy</span> year.<br/>
🎧 So are you <span>pleased</span> now that you did it?<br/>
🎧 Do you feel some <span>sense</span> of <span>achievement</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I do feel much more <span>confident</span>,<br/>
🎧 which I <span>suppose</span> is the most important thing.<br/>
🎧 And have you got any <span>recommendations</span> for people who are <span>studying</span> from <span>overseas</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I <span>suppose</span> they need very good English.<br/>
🎧 It would be much better if they <span>spent</span> more time <span>learning</span> English before they <span>enter</span> the university,<br/>
🎧 because you can be in big <span>trouble</span> if you don't <span>understand</span> what people are <span>saying<br/></span>
🎧 and you haven't got time to <span>translate</span>.<br/>
🎧 Anything else?<br/>
🎧 Well, as I said before,<br/>
🎧 the <span>biggest</span> <span>problem</span> for me was a <span>lack</span> of <span>familiarity</span> with the <span>education</span> <span>system</span> here.<br/>
🎧 It sounds as if it was a <span>real</span> <span>challenge</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Congratulations</span>, <span>Kira</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks, <span>Paul</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Today I'd like to <span>present</span> the <span>findings</span> of our Year <span>2</span> <span>project</span> on <span>wildlife</span> <span>found</span> in <span>gardens</span> <span>throughout</span> our <span>city</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll start by saying something about the <span>background</span> to the <span>project</span>,<br/>
🎧 then talk a little bit about our <span>research</span> <span>techniques</span>,<br/>
🎧 and then <span>indicate</span> some of our <span>interim</span> <span>findings</span>.<br/>
🎧 First of all, how did we choose our <span>topic</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, there are <span>four</span> of us in the group and one day while we were <span>discussing</span> a <span>possible</span> focus,<br/>
🎧 two of the group <span>mentioned</span> that they had <span>seen</span> yet more <span>sparrow-hawks</span> <span>-</span> one of <span>Britain's</span> most <span>interesting</span> <span>birds</span> of <span>prey</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 in their own <span>city</span> <span>centre</span> <span>gardens<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>wondered</span> why they were <span>turning</span> up in these <span>gardens</span> in great <span>numbers</span>.<br/>
🎧 We were all very <span>engaged</span> by the idea of why <span>wild</span> <span>animals</span> would choose to <span>inhabit</span> a <span>city</span> garden.<br/>
🎧 Why is it so <span>popular</span> with <span>wildlife</span> when the <span>countryside</span> <span>itself</span> is <span>becoming</span> less so?<br/>
🎧 The first thing we did was to <span>establish</span> what <span>proportion</span> of the <span>urban</span> <span>land</span> is taken up by <span>private</span> <span>gardens</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>estimated</span> that it was about <span>1/5</span>,<br/>
🎧 and this was <span>endorsed</span> by looking at <span>large-scale</span> <span>usage</span> <span>maps</span> in the <span>town</span> <span>land</span> <span>survey</span> <span>office</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>24%</span> to be <span>precise</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our own <span>informal</span> <span>discussions</span> with <span>neighbours</span> and friends <span>led</span> us to <span>believe</span> <span>that<br/></span>
🎧 many garden <span>owners</span> had <span>interesting</span> <span>experiences</span> to <span>relate</span> <span>regarding</span> <span>wild</span> <span>animal</span> <span>sightings<br/></span>
🎧 so we <span>decided</span> to <span>survey</span> garden <span>owners</span> from different <span>areas</span> of the <span>city</span>.<br/>
🎧 Just over <span>100</span> of them <span>completed</span> a <span>survey</span> once every two <span>weeks</span> for <span>twelve</span> <span>months</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>ticking</span> off <span>species</span> they had <span>seen</span> from a pro <span>forma</span> <span>list</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>adding</span> the <span>names</span> of any <span>rarer</span> <span>ones</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Meanwhile</span>, we were doing our own <span>observations</span> in <span>selected</span> <span>gardens</span> <span>throughout</span> the <span>city</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>deliberately</span> <span>chose</span> <span>smaller</span> <span>ones</span> because they were by <span>far</span> the most <span>typical</span> in the <span>city</span>.<br/>
🎧 The whole <span>point</span> of the <span>project</span> was to look at the <span>norm</span> not the <span>exception</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Alongside</span> this <span>primary</span> <span>research</span> on <span>urban</span> <span>gardens</span>,<br/>
🎧 we were <span>studying</span> a lot of books about the <span>decline</span> of <span>wild</span> <span>animals</span> in the <span>countryside<br/></span>
🎧 and thinking of <span>possible</span> <span>causes</span> for this.<br/>
🎧 So what did we find?<br/>
🎧 Well, so much that I just won't have time to tell you about here.<br/>
🎧 If you're interested in <span>reading</span> our more <span>comprehensive</span> <span>findings</span>,<br/>
🎧 we've <span>produced</span> <span>detailed</span> <span>graphic</span> <span>representations</span> on the <span>college</span> <span>website<br/></span>
🎧 and of course any of the group would be happy to talk to you about them.<br/>
🎧 Just <span>email</span> us.<br/>
🎧 What we've <span>decided</span> to <span>present</span> today is <span>information</span> about just <span>three</span> <span>species</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 because we <span>felt</span> these gave a good <span>indication</span> of the <span>processes</span> at <span>work<br/></span>
🎧 in <span>rural</span> and <span>urban</span> <span>settings</span> as a whole.<br/>
🎧 The first <span>species</span> to <span>generate</span> a lot of <span>interesting</span> <span>information</span> was <span>frogs</span>.<br/>
🎧 And there was a <span>clear</span> <span>pattern</span> here <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 they <span>proliferate</span> where there is <span>suitable</span> water.<br/>
🎧 Garden <span>ponds</span> are on the <span>increase</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>rural</span> <span>ponds</span> are <span>disappearing</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>leading</span> to <span>massive</span> <span>migration</span> to the <span>towns</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hedgehogs</span> are also <span>finding</span> it <span>easier</span> to live in <span>urban</span> <span>areas</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 this time because their <span>predators</span> are not <span>finding</span> it quite so <span>attractive</span> to leave their <span>rural</span> <span>environment</span>,<br/>
🎧 so <span>hedgehogs</span> have a better <span>survival</span> <span>rate</span> in <span>cities</span>.<br/>
🎧 We had lots of <span>sightings</span>,<br/>
🎧 so all in all, we had no <span>difficulties</span> with our <span>efforts</span> to <span>count</span> their <span>numbers</span> <span>precisely</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>final</span> <span>species</span> is the <span>finest</span> of <span>bird</span> <span>singers</span>, the <span>song</span> <span>thrush</span>.<br/>
🎧 On the <span>decline</span> in the <span>countryside</span>,<br/>
🎧 they are <span>experiencing</span> a <span>resurgence</span> in <span>urban</span> <span>gardens<br/></span>
🎧 because these <span>days</span> <span>gardeners</span> are <span>buying</span> lots of different <span>plants<br/></span>
🎧 which <span>means</span> there's an <span>extensive</span> <span>range</span> of <span>seeds</span> around,<br/>
🎧 which is what they <span>feed</span> on.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>factor</span> is the <span>provision</span> of <span>nesting</span> <span>places</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 which is actually better in <span>gardens</span> than the <span>countryside</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hard</span> to <span>believe</span> it, but it's <span>true</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Incidentally</span>, we <span>discovered</span> that a <span>massive</span> new <span>survey</span> on <span>song</span> <span>thrushes</span> is about to be <span>launched</span>,<br/>
🎧 so you should keep an eye open for that.<br/>
🎧 Now, I'd be happy to <span>answer..</span>.<br/>
