🎧 Can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I've just moved to this area with my wife and children<br/>
🎧 and I'd like to know where we can all register with a doctor at a Health Centre.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Well, there's Doctor Green at The Harvey Clinic.<br/>
🎧 We always recommend her for babies, because she's very good with them and she runs a special clinic.<br/>
🎧 Oh... actually my youngest child is five, so that wouldn't be any good for us.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Is there anywhere else I could try?<br/>
🎧 Yes, the Eshcol Health Practice is the next one on my list.<br/>
🎧 How do you spell that?<br/>
🎧 ESHCOL.<br/>
🎧 And it's Doctor Fuller, who has space on his list.<br/>
🎧 The clinic only opened a year ago, so the facilities are all very modern.<br/>
🎧 That sounds good.<br/>
🎧 And it's particularly good if you're busy during the day,<br/>
🎧 because they also do appointments in the evening.<br/>
🎧 They're closed on Saturday, though.<br/>
🎧 The only other place on the list is the Health Centre on Shore Lane.<br/>
🎧 You can register with Doctor Gormley,<br/>
🎧 that's GORMLEY.<br/>
🎧 He's new there, but the centre has a very good reputation.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, I think I know the road.<br/>
🎧 That would be the best one.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Could you tell me, will all their services be free?<br/>
🎧 Erm... there are usually some small charges that doctors make.<br/>
🎧 Let me see what it says about the Shore Lane Centre.<br/>
🎧 If you need to be vaccinated before any trips abroad, you won't have to pay for this.<br/>
🎧 Erm, what else?<br/>
🎧 The sports injury treatment service operates on a paying basis,<br/>
🎧 as does the nutritional therapy service.<br/>
🎧 Some health centres do offer alternative therapies like homeopathy as part of their pay-to-use service.<br/>
🎧 Shore Lane are hoping to do this soon.<br/>
🎧 I think they may start with acupuncture.<br/>
🎧 And finally, if you need to prove you're healthy<br/>
🎧 or haven't had any serious injuries before a new employer will accept you,<br/>
🎧 you can get a free fitness check-up there,<br/>
🎧 but you'd most likely have to pay for insurance medicals though.<br/>
🎧 Okay, thanks.<br/>
🎧 You might also be interested to know the Centre is running a pilot scheme of talks for patients.<br/>
🎧 I've got the list here.<br/>
🎧 Actually, they look very interesting.<br/>
🎧 What sort of things?<br/>
🎧 Well, the first one's about giving up smoking.<br/>
🎧 It's next week, the twenty-fifth of February, at 7 pm,<br/>
🎧 and that's in Room 4.<br/>
🎧 It says, the talk will stress the health benefits, particularly for people with asthma or heart disease.<br/>
🎧 That sounds very interesting.<br/>
🎧 There's also a talk for families with children.<br/>
🎧 It's on Healthy Eating, and takes place on the first of March at five o'clock.<br/>
🎧 Will that be at the Health Centre?<br/>
🎧 Erm, actually it's at the primary school on Shore Lane.<br/>
🎧 I imagine they're inviting the parents of pupils there - it says here 'all welcome'.<br/>
🎧 I might go to that if I have time.<br/>
🎧 There's a couple of other talks -<br/>
🎧 one giving advice about how to avoid injuries while doing exercise.<br/>
🎧 It's on the ninth of March.<br/>
🎧 Oh, it's a late afternoon talk, at 4:30<br/>
🎧 and it'll be in Room 6.<br/>
🎧 It also says the talk is suitable for all ages.<br/>
🎧 And finally, there's a talk called 'Stress Management'...<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Hello?<br/>
🎧 Hi. It's Laura Cariton here.<br/>
🎧 We've just arrived at the holiday flat, but I can't get the hot water and heating to work.<br/>
🎧 Oh right!<br/>
🎧 That's easy.<br/>
🎧 Don't worry.<br/>
🎧 In the upstairs cupboard, you'll find the water heater.<br/>
🎧 You'll see three main controls on the left at the bottom of the heater.<br/>
🎧 The first one - the round one on the far left -<br/>
🎧 is the most important one for the heating and hot water.<br/>
🎧 It's the main control switch.<br/>
🎧 Make sure it's in the 'on' position.<br/>
🎧 The switch itself doesn't light up.<br/>
🎧 But the little square below will be black if the switch is 'off'.<br/>
🎧 That's probably what's happened - it's got switched off by mistake.<br/>
🎧 The middle one of these three controls - you'll see it's slightly larger than the first one - controls the radiators.<br/>
🎧 If you feel cold while you're there and need the radiators on,<br/>
🎧 this needs to be turned to maximum.<br/>
🎧 The last of the three controls - the one on the right -<br/>
🎧 is usually on about a number four setting which, for the water in the taps, is usually quite hot enough.<br/>
🎧 Below the heating controls in the middle is a small round plastic button.<br/>
🎧 If there isn't enough water in the pipes, sometimes the heater goes out.<br/>
🎧 If this happens you'll need to press this button to reset the heater.<br/>
🎧 Hold it in for about five seconds<br/>
🎧 and the heater should come on again.<br/>
🎧 Then there's a little square indicator under the third knob that's a kind of alarm light.<br/>
🎧 It'll flash if you need to reset the heater.<br/>
🎧 It sounds complicated...<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you won't have any problems with it.<br/>
🎧 There should be some more instructions on the side of the heater.<br/>
🎧 Call me back if you can't make it work.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 While you're on the phone, we haven't managed to find a few things we need,<br/>
🎧 like extra pillows for the beds and some washing powder.<br/>
🎧 Is there any here?<br/>
🎧 Pillows... yes.<br/>
🎧 If you look in the cupboard,<br/>
🎧 the large white one upstairs - to the left of the bathroom door -<br/>
🎧 there should be four or five on the top shelf.<br/>
🎧 And if you want to do some washing,<br/>
🎧 there's some powder for that...<br/>
🎧 probably by the back door.<br/>
🎧 There's a kind of shelf there above the sink.<br/>
🎧 In fact, I'm sure there's some there, in a large blue box.<br/>
🎧 You need about half a cup full for each wash.<br/>
🎧 Oh... and that reminds me,<br/>
🎧 the spare key to the back door is hanging on a hook on the wall by the sitting room window.<br/>
🎧 Please make sure to put it back when you've used it.<br/>
🎧 The previous guests lost it in the garden and I had to get another one made.<br/>
🎧 And, if you have any trouble with the lamps.<br/>
🎧 you'll find some spare bulbs in a large cardboard box.<br/>
🎧 It's on top of the washing machine with all kinds of useful things in it.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and another thing I forgot to mention when we last spoke...<br/>
🎧 Yes?<br/>
🎧 I've left you a local map, so you'll be able to find your way around easily.<br/>
🎧 It shows the whole area.<br/>
🎧 I put it in the top drawer of the chest under the TV in your bedroom.<br/>
🎧 There's a whole file of local information in there too.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 What about visiting the town?<br/>
🎧 Can you give us any advice?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 You'll need to take the car.<br/>
🎧 It's too far to walk from the flat really.<br/>
🎧 You have to pay to leave your car in all the car parks now I'm afraid...<br/>
🎧 I like the one that's by the station best<br/>
🎧 and you can walk to the town centre from there in five minutes.<br/>
🎧 That's where all the best restaurants are.<br/>
🎧 But if you want a takeaway,<br/>
🎧 the Italian one does really good pasta and pizzas.<br/>
🎧 Call 732281 for that one,<br/>
🎧 or 766119 for the Chinese.<br/>
🎧 They're both good and they'll both deliver to the flat.<br/>
🎧 As for places to visit,<br/>
🎧 yes, do go and see the railway museum.<br/>
🎧 The exhibition is small but really good.<br/>
🎧 It gets very crowded on Sundays,<br/>
🎧 so I suggest you visit it on a quieter day, later in the week,<br/>
🎧 but not on Thursdays which is market day -<br/>
🎧 you won't find anywhere to park<br/>
🎧 and it's also the only day of the week when they're not open!<br/>
🎧 Anything else?<br/>
🎧 Not for the moment. Thanks!<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Hello, Kira, how are you?<br/>
🎧 Fine thanks, Paul, how are you?<br/>
🎧 Well, thanks.<br/>
🎧 It's good to see you.<br/>
🎧 It must be 12 months since you did our course?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 It's nice to come back and say hello.<br/>
🎧 What course did you enroll in?<br/>
🎧 Actually, I went straight into third year Pharmacy.<br/>
🎧 They credited me with two years, which probably made it more difficult for me.<br/>
🎧 On the other hand, you were lucky to be granted credits.<br/>
🎧 Is that why you chose the course?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 And, as I'd already finished a course in it in my country.<br/>
🎧 I thought it would be easier if I studied something I already knew.<br/>
🎧 I didn't realise you went into third year.<br/>
🎧 I thought you started in first year.<br/>
🎧 No wonder it was so hard!<br/>
🎧 And what do you think is one of the big differences between studying at a university here and studying in your country?<br/>
🎧 Well, I've found it very difficult to write assignments,<br/>
🎧 because I wasn't familiar with that aspect of the system here.<br/>
🎧 The main problem is that the lecturers expect you to be critical.<br/>
🎧 That made me feel really terrible.<br/>
🎧 I thought "How can I possibly do it?"<br/>
🎧 "How can I comment on someone else's research when they probably spent five years doing it?"<br/>
🎧 I think a lot of people who come from overseas countries have similar problems.<br/>
🎧 But after a while, it became easier for me.<br/>
🎧 People expect you to have problems with the process of reading and writing<br/>
🎧 but, in fact, it is more a question of altering your viewpoint towards academic study.<br/>
🎧 How was the content of the lectures?<br/>
🎧 Was it easy for you?<br/>
🎧 I didn't really have many problems understanding lectures.<br/>
🎧 The content was very similar to what I'd studied before.<br/>
🎧 And what about the lecturers themselves?<br/>
🎧 Are they essentially the same as lecturers in your country?<br/>
🎧 Well, actually, no.<br/>
🎧 Here, they're much easier to approach.<br/>
🎧 After every lecture, you can go and ask them something you didn't understand.<br/>
🎧 Or you can make an appointment and talk to them about anything in the course.<br/>
🎧 Maybe you found them different because you're a more mature student now,<br/>
🎧 whereas when you were studying in your country, you were younger and not so assertive.<br/>
🎧 No, I don't think that's the difference.<br/>
🎧 Most of the students here do it.<br/>
🎧 In my faculty, they all seem to make appointments -<br/>
🎧 usually to talk about something in the course that's worrying them,<br/>
🎧 but sometimes just about something that might really interest them,<br/>
🎧 something they might want to specialise in.<br/>
🎧 The lecturers must set aside certain times every week when they're available for students.<br/>
🎧 That's good to hear.<br/>
🎧 And how was your timetable?<br/>
🎧 Was it a very busy year?<br/>
🎧 Very, very busy.<br/>
🎧 They make you work very hard.<br/>
🎧 Apart from lectures, we had practical sessions in a lot of subjects.<br/>
🎧 We did these in small groups.<br/>
🎧 I had to go and work four hours every week in a community pharmacy.<br/>
🎧 Actually, I enjoyed this very much - meeting new people all the time.<br/>
🎧 Then in second semester, we had to get experience in hospital dispensaries,<br/>
🎧 so every second day we went to one of the big hospitals and worked there.<br/>
🎧 And on top of all that we had our assignments,<br/>
🎧 which took me a lot of time.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I nearly forgot, between first and second semesters,<br/>
🎧 we had to work full-time for two weeks in a hospital.<br/>
🎧 That does sound a very heavy year.<br/>
🎧 So are you pleased now that you did it?<br/>
🎧 Do you feel some sense of achievement?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I do feel much more confident,<br/>
🎧 which I suppose is the most important thing.<br/>
🎧 And have you got any recommendations for people who are studying from overseas?<br/>
🎧 Well, I suppose they need very good English.<br/>
🎧 It would be much better if they spent more time learning English before they enter the university,<br/>
🎧 because you can be in big trouble if you don't understand what people are saying<br/>
🎧 and you haven't got time to translate.<br/>
🎧 Anything else?<br/>
🎧 Well, as I said before,<br/>
🎧 the biggest problem for me was a lack of familiarity with the education system here.<br/>
🎧 It sounds as if it was a real challenge.<br/>
🎧 Congratulations, Kira.<br/>
🎧 Thanks, Paul.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 Today I'd like to present the findings of our Year 2 project on wildlife found in gardens throughout our city.<br/>
🎧 I'll start by saying something about the background to the project,<br/>
🎧 then talk a little bit about our research techniques,<br/>
🎧 and then indicate some of our interim findings.<br/>
🎧 First of all, how did we choose our topic?<br/>
🎧 Well, there are four of us in the group and one day while we were discussing a possible focus,<br/>
🎧 two of the group mentioned that they had seen yet more sparrow-hawks - one of Britain's most interesting birds of prey -<br/>
🎧 in their own city centre gardens<br/>
🎧 and wondered why they were turning up in these gardens in great numbers.<br/>
🎧 We were all very engaged by the idea of why wild animals would choose to inhabit a city garden.<br/>
🎧 Why is it so popular with wildlife when the countryside itself is becoming less so?<br/>
🎧 The first thing we did was to establish what proportion of the urban land is taken up by private gardens.<br/>
🎧 We estimated that it was about 1/5,<br/>
🎧 and this was endorsed by looking at large-scale usage maps in the town land survey office -<br/>
🎧 24% to be precise.<br/>
🎧 Our own informal discussions with neighbours and friends led us to believe that<br/>
🎧 many garden owners had interesting experiences to relate regarding wild animal sightings<br/>
🎧 so we decided to survey garden owners from different areas of the city.<br/>
🎧 Just over 100 of them completed a survey once every two weeks for twelve months -<br/>
🎧 ticking off species they had seen from a pro forma list -<br/>
🎧 and adding the names of any rarer ones.<br/>
🎧 Meanwhile, we were doing our own observations in selected gardens throughout the city.<br/>
🎧 We deliberately chose smaller ones because they were by far the most typical in the city.<br/>
🎧 The whole point of the project was to look at the norm not the exception.<br/>
🎧 Alongside this primary research on urban gardens,<br/>
🎧 we were studying a lot of books about the decline of wild animals in the countryside<br/>
🎧 and thinking of possible causes for this.<br/>
🎧 So what did we find?<br/>
🎧 Well, so much that I just won't have time to tell you about here.<br/>
🎧 If you're interested in reading our more comprehensive findings,<br/>
🎧 we've produced detailed graphic representations on the college website<br/>
🎧 and of course any of the group would be happy to talk to you about them.<br/>
🎧 Just email us.<br/>
🎧 What we've decided to present today is information about just three species -<br/>
🎧 because we felt these gave a good indication of the processes at work<br/>
🎧 in rural and urban settings as a whole.<br/>
🎧 The first species to generate a lot of interesting information was frogs.<br/>
🎧 And there was a clear pattern here -<br/>
🎧 they proliferate where there is suitable water.<br/>
🎧 Garden ponds are on the increase,<br/>
🎧 rural ponds are disappearing,<br/>
🎧 leading to massive migration to the towns.<br/>
🎧 Hedgehogs are also finding it easier to live in urban areas -<br/>
🎧 this time because their predators are not finding it quite so attractive to leave their rural environment,<br/>
🎧 so hedgehogs have a better survival rate in cities.<br/>
🎧 We had lots of sightings,<br/>
🎧 so all in all, we had no difficulties with our efforts to count their numbers precisely.<br/>
🎧 Our final species is the finest of bird singers, the song thrush.<br/>
🎧 On the decline in the countryside,<br/>
🎧 they are experiencing a resurgence in urban gardens<br/>
🎧 because these days gardeners are buying lots of different plants<br/>
🎧 which means there's an extensive range of seeds around,<br/>
🎧 which is what they feed on.<br/>
🎧 Another factor is the provision of nesting places -<br/>
🎧 which is actually better in gardens than the countryside.<br/>
🎧 Hard to believe it, but it's true.<br/>
🎧 Incidentally, we discovered that a massive new survey on song thrushes is about to be launched,<br/>
🎧 so you should keep an eye open for that.<br/>
🎧 Now, I'd be happy to answer...<br/>
<br/><br/>
