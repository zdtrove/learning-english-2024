🎧 Hello, <span>Tourist</span> <span>Information</span> <span>Centre</span>, <span>Mike</span> <span>speaking</span>, how can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Oh, hi.<br/>
🎧 I wanted to find out about <span>cookery</span> <span>classes</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>believe</span> there are some <span>one-day</span> <span>classes</span> for <span>tourists</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, they're open to everyone, but <span>tourists</span> are always <span>welcome</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, let me give you some <span>details</span> of what's <span>available</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>several</span> <span>classes</span>.<br/>
🎧 One very <span>popular</span> one is at the Food <span>Studio</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>OK<br/></span>
🎧 They focus on <span>seasonal</span> <span>products</span>,<br/>
🎧 and as well as <span>teaching</span> you how to <span>cook</span> them, they also show you how to choose them.<br/>
🎧 Right, that sounds good.<br/>
🎧 How big are the <span>classes</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm not sure exactly, but they'll be quite small.<br/>
🎧 And could I get a <span>private</span> <span>lesson</span> there?<br/>
🎧 I think <span>so…</span> let me check,<br/>
🎧 yes, they do <span>offer</span> those.<br/>
🎧 Though in <span>fact</span> most of the people who <span>attend</span> the <span>classes</span> find it's a nice way of getting to know one another.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> it must be, yes.<br/>
🎧 And this company has a special <span>deal</span> for <span>clients<br/></span>
🎧 where they <span>offer</span> a <span>discount</span> of <span>20%</span> if you <span>return</span> for a <span>further</span> class.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 But you said there were <span>several</span> <span>classes</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 Another one you might be interested in is <span>Bond's</span> <span>Cookery</span> School.<br/>
🎧 They're quite new,<br/>
🎧 they just <span>opened</span> six <span>months</span> ago, but I've heard good things about them.<br/>
🎧 They <span>concentrate</span> on <span>teaching</span> you to <span>prepare</span> <span>healthy</span> food,<br/>
🎧 and they have quite a lot of <span>specialist</span> <span>staff</span>.<br/>
🎧 So is that food for people on a <span>diet</span> and things like that?<br/>
🎧 I don't know if I'd be interested in that.<br/>
🎧 Well, I don't think they <span>particularly</span> focus on low <span>calorie</span> <span>diets</span> or <span>weight</span> <span>loss</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's more to do with <span>recipes</span> that look at <span>specific</span> needs,<br/>
🎧 like <span>including</span> <span>ingredients</span> that will help <span>build</span> up your <span>bones</span> and make them <span>stronger</span>, that <span>sort</span> of thing.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 Well, I might be interested, I'm not sure.<br/>
🎧 Do they have a <span>website</span> I could check?<br/>
🎧 Yes, just key in the name of the school <span>-</span> it'll come up.<br/>
🎧 And if you want to know more about them, every <span>Thursday</span> <span>evening</span> they have a <span>lecture</span> at the school.<br/>
🎧 It's free and you don't need to book or anything, just <span>turn</span> up at <span>7.30</span>.<br/>
🎧 And that might give you an idea of <span>whether</span> you want to go to an <span>actual</span> class.<br/>
🎧 OK, there's one more place you might be interested in.<br/>
🎧 That's got a rather <span>strange</span> name, it's called The <span>Arretsa</span> <span>Centre</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 that's <span>spelled</span> <span>ARRETSA</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 <span>They've</span> got a very good <span>reputation</span>.<br/>
🎧 They do a bit of <span>meat</span> and <span>fish</span> <span>cookery</span> but they <span>mostly</span> <span>specialise</span> in <span>vegetarian</span> <span>dishes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>certainly</span> an <span>area</span> I'd like to learn more about.<br/>
🎧 I've got lots of friends who don't eat <span>meat</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, I think I might have <span>seen</span> that school today.<br/>
🎧 Is it just by the <span>market</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 So they don't have any <span>problem</span> getting their <span>ingredients</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're right next <span>door</span>.<br/>
🎧 And they also <span>offer</span> a special <span>two-hour</span> course in how to use a <span>knife</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>cover</span> all the different <span>skills</span> <span>-</span> <span>buying</span> them, <span>sharpening</span>, <span>chopping</span> <span>techniques</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>gets</span> <span>booked</span> up quickly though so you'd need to check it was <span>available</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, well thank you very much.<br/>
🎧 I'll go <span>and…<br/></span><br />

🎧 Good <span>evening</span> everyone.<br/>
🎧 My <span>name's</span> <span>Phil</span> <span>Sutton</span>, and I'm <span>chairman</span> of the <span>Highways</span> <span>Committee</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've called this <span>meeting</span> to <span>inform</span> <span>members</span> of the <span>public<br/></span>
🎧 about the new <span>regulations</span> for <span>traffic</span> and <span>parking</span> we're <span>proposing</span> for <span>Granford</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll start by <span>summarising</span> these changes before we open the <span>meeting</span> to <span>questions</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, why do we need to make these changes to <span>traffic</span> <span>systems</span> in <span>Granford</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, we're very <span>aware</span> that <span>traffic</span> is <span>becoming</span> an <span>increasing</span> <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's been <span>especially</span> <span>noticeable</span> with the <span>increase</span> in <span>heavy</span> <span>traffic</span> while <span>they've</span> been <span>building</span> the new <span>hospital</span>.<br/>
🎧 But it's the <span>overall</span> <span>rise</span> in the <span>volume</span> of <span>traffic</span> of all <span>kinds</span> that's <span>concerning</span> us.<br/>
🎧 To date there's not been any <span>increase</span> in <span>traffic</span> <span>accidents</span>,<br/>
🎧 but that's not something we want to see <span>happen</span>, <span>obviously</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>recently</span> <span>carried</span> out a <span>survey</span> of <span>local</span> <span>residents</span>,<br/>
🎧 and their <span>responses</span> were <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 People were very <span>concerned</span> about the <span>lack</span> of <span>visibility</span> on some <span>roads<br/></span>
🎧 <span>due</span> to <span>cars</span> <span>parked</span> along the <span>sides</span> of the <span>roads</span>.<br/>
🎧 We'd <span>expected</span> <span>complaints</span> about the <span>congestion</span> near the <span>school<br/></span>
🎧 when <span>parents</span> are <span>dropping</span> off their children or <span>picking</span> them up,<br/>
🎧 but this wasn't top of the <span>list</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>nor</span> were <span>noise</span> and <span>fumes</span> from <span>trucks</span> and <span>lorries</span>,<br/>
🎧 though they were <span>mentioned</span> by some people.<br/>
🎧 We think these new <span>traffic</span> <span>regulations</span> would make a lot of <span>difference</span>.<br/>
🎧 But we still have a long way to go.<br/>
🎧 We've <span>managed</span> to keep our <span>proposals</span> <span>within</span> <span>budget</span>, just, so they can be <span>covered</span> by the <span>Council</span>.<br/>
🎧 But, of course, it's no good <span>introducing</span> new <span>regulations<br/></span>
🎧 if we don't have a way of <span>making</span> sure that everyone <span>obeys</span> them,<br/>
🎧 and that's an <span>area</span> we're still working on with the help of <span>representatives</span> from the <span>police</span> <span>force</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK, so this <span>slide</span> <span>shows</span> a map of the <span>central</span> <span>area</span> of <span>Granford</span>,<br/>
🎧 with the High <span>Street</span> in the <span>middle</span> and School <span>Road</span> on the right.<br/>
🎧 Now, we already have a set of <span>traffic</span> <span>lights</span> in the High <span>Street</span> at the <span>junction</span> with <span>Station</span> <span>Road</span>,<br/>
🎧 but we're planning to have another set at the other end, at the School <span>Road</span> <span>junction</span>,<br/>
🎧 to <span>regulate</span> the <span>flow</span> of <span>traffic</span> along the High <span>Street</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've <span>decided</span> we definitely need a <span>pedestrian</span> <span>crossing</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>considered</span> <span>putting</span> this on School <span>Road</span>, just outside the school,<br/>
🎧 but in the end we <span>decided</span> that could <span>lead</span> to a lot of <span>traffic</span> <span>congestion<br/></span>
🎧 so we <span>decided</span> to <span>locate</span> it on the High <span>Street</span>, <span>crossing</span> the <span>road</span> in <span>front</span> of the <span>supermarket</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's a very <span>busy</span> <span>area</span>, so it should help things there.<br/>
🎧 We're <span>proposing</span> some changes to <span>parking</span>.<br/>
🎧 At <span>present</span>, <span>parking</span> isn't <span>allowed</span> on the High <span>Street</span> outside the <span>library</span>,<br/>
🎧 but we're going to change that, and <span>allow</span> <span>parking</span> there,<br/>
🎧 but not at the other end of the High <span>Street</span> near School <span>Road</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>There'll</span> be a new <span>'No</span> <span>Parking'</span> <span>sign</span> on School <span>Road</span>,<br/>
🎧 just by the <span>entrance</span> to the school, <span>forbidding</span> <span>parking</span> for <span>25</span> <span>metres</span>.<br/>
🎧 This should <span>improve</span> <span>visibility</span> for <span>drivers</span> and <span>pedestrians</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>especially</span> on the <span>bend</span> just to the <span>north</span> of the school.<br/>
🎧 As <span>far</span> as <span>disabled</span> <span>drivers</span> are <span>concerned</span>,<br/>
🎧 at <span>present</span> they have <span>parking</span> outside the <span>supermarket</span>,<br/>
🎧 but <span>lorries</span> also use those <span>spaces</span>,<br/>
🎧 so we've got two new <span>disabled</span> <span>parking</span> <span>spaces</span> on the side <span>road</span> up <span>towards</span> the <span>bank</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's not <span>ideal</span>, but probably better than the <span>present</span> <span>arrangement</span>.<br/>
🎧 We also plan to <span>widen</span> the <span>pavement</span> on School <span>Road</span>.<br/>
🎧 We think we can <span>manage</span> to get an <span>extra</span> <span>half-metre</span> on the <span>bend</span> just before you get to the school,<br/>
🎧 on the same side of the <span>road</span>.<br/>
🎧 Finally, we've <span>introduced</span> new <span>restrictions</span> on <span>loading</span> and <span>unloading</span> for the <span>supermarket</span>,<br/>
🎧 so <span>lorries</span> will only be <span>allowed</span> to <span>stop</span> there before <span>8</span> am.<br/>
🎧 That's the <span>supermarket</span> on School <span>Road</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 we <span>kept</span> to the <span>existing</span> <span>arrangements</span> with the High <span>Street</span> <span>supermarket</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK. So that's about <span>it..</span>.<br/><br />

🎧 We've got to choose a <span>topic</span> for our <span>experiment</span>, haven't we, <span>Jack</span>?<br/>
🎧 Were you thinking of something to do with <span>seeds</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 I thought we could look at <span>seed</span> <span>germination</span> <span>-</span> how a <span>seed</span> <span>begins</span> to <span>grow</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Any <span>particular</span> <span>reason</span>?<br/>
🎧 I know you're <span>hoping</span> to work in <span>plant</span> <span>science</span> <span>eventually…<br/></span>
🎧 Yeah, but <span>practically</span> everything we do is going to <span>feed</span> into that.<br/>
🎧 No, there's an <span>optional</span> <span>module</span> on <span>seed</span> <span>structure</span> and <span>function</span> in the <span>third</span> year that I might do,<br/>
🎧 so I thought it might be <span>useful</span> for that.<br/>
🎧 If I choose that option, I don't have to do a <span>dissertation</span> <span>module</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good idea.<br/>
🎧 Well, I thought for this <span>experiment</span> we could look at the <span>relationship</span> between <span>seed</span> size and the way the <span>seeds</span> are <span>planted</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, we could <span>plant</span> different <span>sized</span> <span>seeds</span> in different <span>ways</span>, and see which <span>grow</span> best.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 We'd need to <span>allow</span> time for the <span>seeds</span> to come up.<br/>
🎧 That should be fine if we start now.<br/>
🎧 A lot of the other <span>possible</span> <span>experiments</span> need quite a bit <span>longer</span>.<br/>
🎧 So that'd make it a good one to choose.<br/>
🎧 And I don't <span>suppose</span> it'd need much <span>equipment;<br/></span>
🎧 we're not doing <span>chemical</span> <span>analysis</span> or anything.<br/>
🎧 Though that's not really an issue,<br/>
🎧 we've got <span>plenty</span> of <span>equipment</span> in the <span>laboratory</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. We need to have a <span>word</span> with the <span>tutor</span> if we're going to go ahead with it though.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure our <span>aim's</span> OK.<br/>
🎧 It's not very <span>ambitious</span> but the <span>assignment's</span> only ten <span>percent</span> of our <span>final</span> <span>mark</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 But we need to be sure we're the only <span>ones</span> doing it.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, it's only <span>five</span> <span>percent</span> actually,<br/>
🎧 but it'd be a bit <span>boring</span> if everyone was doing it.<br/>
🎧 Did you read that book on <span>seed</span> <span>germination</span> on our <span>reading</span> <span>list</span>?<br/>
🎧 The one by <span>Graves</span>?<br/>
🎧 I <span>looked</span> through it for my last <span>experiment</span>,<br/>
🎧 though it wasn't all that <span>relevant</span> there.<br/>
🎧 It would be for this <span>experiment</span>, though.<br/>
🎧 I <span>found</span> it quite <span>hard</span> to <span>follow</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 lots about the <span>theory</span>, which I hadn't <span>expected<br/></span>
🎧 Yes, I'd been <span>hoping</span> for something more <span>practical</span>.<br/>
🎧 It does <span>include</span> <span>references</span> to the <span>recent</span> <span>findings</span> on <span>genetically-modified</span> <span>seeds</span>, though.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that was <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 I read an <span>article</span> about <span>seed</span> <span>germination</span> by <span>Lee</span> <span>Hall</span>.<br/>
🎧 About <span>seeds</span> that <span>lie</span> in the <span>ground</span> for <span>ages</span> and only <span>germinate</span> after a <span>fire</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's the one.<br/>
🎧 I <span>knew</span> a bit about it already, but not about this <span>research</span>.<br/>
🎧 His <span>analysis</span> of <span>figures</span> <span>comparing</span> the <span>times</span> of the <span>fires</span> and the <span>proportion</span> of <span>seeds</span> that <span>germinated<br/></span>
🎧 was done in a lot of <span>detail</span> <span>-</span> very <span>impressive</span>.<br/>
🎧 Was that the <span>article</span> with the <span>illustrations</span> of <span>early</span> <span>stages</span> of <span>plant</span> <span>development</span>?<br/>
🎧 They were very <span>clear</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think those <span>diagrams</span> were in another <span>article</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, shall we have a look at the <span>procedure</span> for our <span>experiment</span>?<br/>
🎧 We'll need to get going with it quite soon.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So the first thing we have to do is find our <span>seeds</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think <span>vegetable</span> <span>seeds</span> would be best.<br/>
🎧 And <span>obviously</span> they mustn't all be the same size.<br/>
🎧 So, how many <span>sorts</span> do we need?<br/>
🎧 About <span>four</span> different <span>ones</span>?<br/>
🎧 I think that would be enough.<br/>
🎧 <span>There'll</span> be quite a large number of <span>seeds</span> for each one.<br/>
🎧 Then, for each <span>seed</span> we need to find out how much it <span>weighs</span>,<br/>
🎧 and also <span>measure</span> its <span>dimensions</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we need to keep a <span>careful</span> <span>record</span> of all that.<br/>
🎧 <span>That'll</span> be quite <span>time-consuming</span>.<br/>
🎧 And we also need to decide how <span>deep</span> we're going to <span>plant</span> the <span>seeds</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 right on the <span>surface</span>, a few <span>millimetres</span> down, or <span>several</span> <span>centimetres</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So then we get <span>planting</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you think we can <span>plant</span> <span>several</span> <span>seeds</span> together in the same <span>plant</span> pot?<br/>
🎧 No, I think we need a different one for each <span>seed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right. And we'll need to <span>label</span> them.<br/>
🎧 We can use different <span>coloured</span> <span>labels</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then we wait for the <span>seeds</span> to <span>germinate</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>reckon</span> <span>that'll</span> be about <span>three</span> <span>weeks</span>, <span>depending</span> on what the <span>weather's</span> like.<br/>
🎧 Then we see if our <span>plants</span> have come up, and <span>write</span> down how <span>tall</span> <span>they've</span> <span>grown</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then all we have to do is look at our <span>numbers</span>, and see if there's any <span>relation</span> between them.<br/>
🎧 That's right. So <span>…<br/></span><br />

🎧 Hi.<br/>
🎧 Today we're going to be looking at <span>animals</span> in <span>urban</span> <span>environments<br/></span>
🎧 and I'm going to be <span>telling</span> you about some <span>research</span> on how they're <span>affected</span> by these <span>environments</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, in <span>evolutionary</span> <span>terms</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>urban</span> <span>environments</span> <span>represent</span> <span>huge</span> <span>upheavals</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>sorts</span> of <span>massive</span> changes that usually <span>happen</span> over <span>millions</span> of years.<br/>
🎧 And we used to think that only a few <span>species</span> could <span>adapt</span> to this new <span>environment</span>.<br/>
🎧 One <span>species</span> which is well <span>known</span> as being <span>highly</span> <span>adaptable</span> is the <span>crow</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>there've</span> been <span>various</span> <span>studies</span> about how they <span>manage</span> to learn new <span>skills</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>successful</span> <span>species</span> is the <span>pigeon</span>,<br/>
🎧 because they're able to <span>perch</span> on <span>ledges</span> on the <span>walls</span> of <span>city</span> <span>buildings</span>,<br/>
🎧 just like they once <span>perched</span> on <span>cliffs</span> by the sea.<br/>
🎧 But in <span>fact</span>,<br/>
🎧 we're now <span>finding</span> that these <span>early</span> <span>immigrants</span> were just the start of a more <span>general</span> <span>movement</span> of <span>animals</span> into <span>cities</span>,<br/>
🎧 and of <span>adaptation</span> by these <span>animals</span> to <span>city</span> life.<br/>
🎧 And one thing that <span>researchers</span> are <span>finding</span> <span>especially</span> <span>interesting<br/></span>
🎧 is the <span>speed</span> with which they're doing this <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 we're not talking about <span>gradual</span> <span>evolution</span> here <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 these <span>animals</span> are <span>changing</span> <span>fast</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let me tell you about some of the <span>studies</span> that have been <span>carried</span> out in this <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, in the University of <span>Minnesota</span>,<br/>
🎧 a <span>biologist</span> called <span>Emilie</span> <span>Snell-Rood</span> and her <span>colleagues<br/></span>
🎧 <span>looked</span> at <span>specimens</span> of <span>urbanised</span> small <span>mammals</span> such as <span>mice</span> and <span>gophers<br/></span>
🎧 that had been <span>collected</span> in <span>Minnesota</span>, and that are now <span>kept</span> in <span>museums</span> there.<br/>
🎧 And she <span>looked</span> at <span>specimens</span> that had been <span>collected</span> over the last <span>hundred</span> years,<br/>
🎧 which is a very short time in <span>evolutionary</span> <span>terms</span>.<br/>
🎧 And she <span>found</span> that during that time,<br/>
🎧 these small <span>mammals</span> had <span>experienced</span> a <span>jump</span> in <span>brain</span> size when <span>compared</span> to <span>rural</span> <span>mammals</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, we can't be sure this <span>means</span> they're more <span>intelligent</span>,<br/>
🎧 but since the <span>sizes</span> of other <span>parts</span> of the <span>body</span> didn't change,<br/>
🎧 it does <span>suggest</span> that something <span>cognitive</span> was going on.<br/>
🎧 And <span>Snell-Rood</span> <span>thinks</span> that this change might <span>reflect</span> the <span>cognitive</span> <span>demands</span> of <span>adjusting</span> to <span>city</span> life <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 having to look in different <span>places</span> to find food, for example,<br/>
🎧 and <span>coping</span> with a whole new set of <span>dangers</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then over in <span>Germany</span> at the <span>Max</span> <span>Planck</span> <span>Institute</span>,<br/>
🎧 there's another <span>biologist</span> called <span>Catarina</span> <span>Miranda<br/></span>
🎧 who's done some <span>experiments</span> with <span>blackbirds</span> living in <span>urban</span> and <span>rural</span> <span>areas</span>.<br/>
🎧 And she's been looking not at their <span>anatomy</span> but at their <span>behaviour</span>.<br/>
🎧 So as you might <span>expect</span>, she's <span>found</span> that the <span>urban</span> <span>blackbirds</span> <span>tend</span> to be quite <span>bold</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 they're <span>prepared</span> to <span>face</span> up to a lot of <span>threats</span> that would <span>frighten</span> away their <span>country</span> <span>counterparts</span>.<br/>
🎧 But there's one <span>type</span> of <span>situation</span> that does <span>seem</span> to <span>frighten</span> the <span>urban</span> <span>blackbirds</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that's anything new <span>-</span> anything they haven't <span>experienced</span> before.<br/>
🎧 And if you think about it, that's quite <span>sensible</span> for a <span>bird</span> living in the <span>city</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Jonathan</span> <span>Atwell</span>, in <span>Indiana</span> University,<br/>
🎧 is looking at how a <span>range</span> of <span>animals</span> <span>respond</span> to <span>urban</span> <span>environments</span>.<br/>
🎧 He's <span>found</span> that when they're under <span>stress</span>,<br/>
🎧 their <span>endocrine</span> <span>systems</span> <span>react</span> by <span>reducing</span> the amount of <span>hormones</span> such as <span>corticosterone</span> into their <span>blood</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>sensible-seeming</span> <span>adaptation</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>rat</span> that <span>gets</span> <span>scared</span> every time a <span>subway</span> <span>train</span> <span>rolls</span> <span>past</span> won't be very <span>successful</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's just one more <span>study</span> I'd like to <span>mention</span> which is by <span>Sarah</span> <span>Partan</span> and her <span>team</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>they've</span> been looking at how <span>squirrels</span> <span>communicate</span> in an <span>urban</span> <span>environment</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>they've</span> <span>found</span> that a <span>routine</span> <span>part</span> of their <span>communication</span> is <span>carried</span> out by <span>waving</span> their <span>tails</span>.<br/>
🎧 You do also see this in the <span>country</span>, but it's much more <span>prevalent</span> in <span>cities</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>possibly</span> because it's <span>effective</span> in a <span>noisy</span> <span>environment</span>.<br/>
🎧 So what are the <span>long-term</span> <span>implications</span> of this?<br/>
🎧 One <span>possibility</span> is that we may see <span>completely</span> new <span>species</span> <span>developing</span> in <span>cities</span>.<br/>
🎧 But on the other <span>hand</span>, it's <span>possible</span> that not all of these <span>adaptations</span> will be <span>permanent</span>.<br/>
🎧 Once the <span>animal's</span> got <span>accustomed</span> to its new <span>environment</span>,<br/>
🎧 it may no <span>longer</span> need the <span>features</span> it's <span>developed</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, now we've had a <span>look…<br/>
