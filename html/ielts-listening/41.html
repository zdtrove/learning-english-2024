🎧 Hello, Tourist Information Centre, Mike speaking, how can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Oh, hi.<br/>
🎧 I wanted to find out about cookery classes.<br/>
🎧 I believe there are some one-day classes for tourists?<br/>
🎧 Well, they're open to everyone, but tourists are always welcome.<br/>
🎧 OK, let me give you some details of what's available.<br/>
🎧 There are several classes.<br/>
🎧 One very popular one is at the Food Studio.<br/>
🎧 OK<br/>
🎧 They focus on seasonal products,<br/>
🎧 and as well as teaching you how to cook them, they also show you how to choose them.<br/>
🎧 Right, that sounds good.<br/>
🎧 How big are the classes?<br/>
🎧 I'm not sure exactly, but they'll be quite small.<br/>
🎧 And could I get a private lesson there?<br/>
🎧 I think so… let me check,<br/>
🎧 yes, they do offer those.<br/>
🎧 Though in fact most of the people who attend the classes find it's a nice way of getting to know one another.<br/>
🎧 I suppose it must be, yes.<br/>
🎧 And this company has a special deal for clients<br/>
🎧 where they offer a discount of 20% if you return for a further class.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 But you said there were several classes?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 Another one you might be interested in is Bond's Cookery School.<br/>
🎧 They're quite new,<br/>
🎧 they just opened six months ago, but I've heard good things about them.<br/>
🎧 They concentrate on teaching you to prepare healthy food,<br/>
🎧 and they have quite a lot of specialist staff.<br/>
🎧 So is that food for people on a diet and things like that?<br/>
🎧 I don't know if I'd be interested in that.<br/>
🎧 Well, I don't think they particularly focus on low calorie diets or weight loss.<br/>
🎧 It's more to do with recipes that look at specific needs,<br/>
🎧 like including ingredients that will help build up your bones and make them stronger, that sort of thing.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 Well, I might be interested, I'm not sure.<br/>
🎧 Do they have a website I could check?<br/>
🎧 Yes, just key in the name of the school - it'll come up.<br/>
🎧 And if you want to know more about them, every Thursday evening they have a lecture at the school.<br/>
🎧 It's free and you don't need to book or anything, just turn up at 7.30.<br/>
🎧 And that might give you an idea of whether you want to go to an actual class.<br/>
🎧 OK, there's one more place you might be interested in.<br/>
🎧 That's got a rather strange name, it's called The Arretsa Centre -<br/>
🎧 that's spelled ARRETSA.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 They've got a very good reputation.<br/>
🎧 They do a bit of meat and fish cookery but they mostly specialise in vegetarian dishes.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 That's certainly an area I'd like to learn more about.<br/>
🎧 I've got lots of friends who don't eat meat.<br/>
🎧 In fact, I think I might have seen that school today.<br/>
🎧 Is it just by the market?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 So they don't have any problem getting their ingredients.<br/>
🎧 They're right next door.<br/>
🎧 And they also offer a special two-hour course in how to use a knife.<br/>
🎧 They cover all the different skills - buying them, sharpening, chopping techniques.<br/>
🎧 It gets booked up quickly though so you'd need to check it was available.<br/>
🎧 Right, well thank you very much.<br/>
🎧 I'll go and…<br/><br />

🎧 Good evening everyone.<br/>
🎧 My name's Phil Sutton, and I'm chairman of the Highways Committee.<br/>
🎧 We've called this meeting to inform members of the public<br/>
🎧 about the new regulations for traffic and parking we're proposing for Granford.<br/>
🎧 I'll start by summarising these changes before we open the meeting to questions.<br/>
🎧 So, why do we need to make these changes to traffic systems in Granford?<br/>
🎧 Well, we're very aware that traffic is becoming an increasing problem.<br/>
🎧 It's been especially noticeable with the increase in heavy traffic while they've been building the new hospital.<br/>
🎧 But it's the overall rise in the volume of traffic of all kinds that's concerning us.<br/>
🎧 To date there's not been any increase in traffic accidents,<br/>
🎧 but that's not something we want to see happen, obviously.<br/>
🎧 We recently carried out a survey of local residents,<br/>
🎧 and their responses were interesting.<br/>
🎧 People were very concerned about the lack of visibility on some roads<br/>
🎧 due to cars parked along the sides of the roads.<br/>
🎧 We'd expected complaints about the congestion near the school<br/>
🎧 when parents are dropping off their children or picking them up,<br/>
🎧 but this wasn't top of the list,<br/>
🎧 and nor were noise and fumes from trucks and lorries,<br/>
🎧 though they were mentioned by some people.<br/>
🎧 We think these new traffic regulations would make a lot of difference.<br/>
🎧 But we still have a long way to go.<br/>
🎧 We've managed to keep our proposals within budget, just, so they can be covered by the Council.<br/>
🎧 But, of course, it's no good introducing new regulations<br/>
🎧 if we don't have a way of making sure that everyone obeys them,<br/>
🎧 and that's an area we're still working on with the help of representatives from the police force.<br/>
🎧 OK, so this slide shows a map of the central area of Granford,<br/>
🎧 with the High Street in the middle and School Road on the right.<br/>
🎧 Now, we already have a set of traffic lights in the High Street at the junction with Station Road,<br/>
🎧 but we're planning to have another set at the other end, at the School Road junction,<br/>
🎧 to regulate the flow of traffic along the High Street.<br/>
🎧 We've decided we definitely need a pedestrian crossing.<br/>
🎧 We considered putting this on School Road, just outside the school,<br/>
🎧 but in the end we decided that could lead to a lot of traffic congestion<br/>
🎧 so we decided to locate it on the High Street, crossing the road in front of the supermarket.<br/>
🎧 That's a very busy area, so it should help things there.<br/>
🎧 We're proposing some changes to parking.<br/>
🎧 At present, parking isn't allowed on the High Street outside the library,<br/>
🎧 but we're going to change that, and allow parking there,<br/>
🎧 but not at the other end of the High Street near School Road.<br/>
🎧 There'll be a new 'No Parking' sign on School Road,<br/>
🎧 just by the entrance to the school, forbidding parking for 25 metres.<br/>
🎧 This should improve visibility for drivers and pedestrians,<br/>
🎧 especially on the bend just to the north of the school.<br/>
🎧 As far as disabled drivers are concerned,<br/>
🎧 at present they have parking outside the supermarket,<br/>
🎧 but lorries also use those spaces,<br/>
🎧 so we've got two new disabled parking spaces on the side road up towards the bank.<br/>
🎧 It's not ideal, but probably better than the present arrangement.<br/>
🎧 We also plan to widen the pavement on School Road.<br/>
🎧 We think we can manage to get an extra half-metre on the bend just before you get to the school,<br/>
🎧 on the same side of the road.<br/>
🎧 Finally, we've introduced new restrictions on loading and unloading for the supermarket,<br/>
🎧 so lorries will only be allowed to stop there before 8 am.<br/>
🎧 That's the supermarket on School Road -<br/>
🎧 we kept to the existing arrangements with the High Street supermarket.<br/>
🎧 OK. So that's about it...<br/><br />

🎧 We've got to choose a topic for our experiment, haven't we, Jack?<br/>
🎧 Were you thinking of something to do with seeds?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 I thought we could look at seed germination - how a seed begins to grow.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Any particular reason?<br/>
🎧 I know you're hoping to work in plant science eventually…<br/>
🎧 Yeah, but practically everything we do is going to feed into that.<br/>
🎧 No, there's an optional module on seed structure and function in the third year that I might do,<br/>
🎧 so I thought it might be useful for that.<br/>
🎧 If I choose that option, I don't have to do a dissertation module.<br/>
🎧 Good idea.<br/>
🎧 Well, I thought for this experiment we could look at the relationship between seed size and the way the seeds are planted.<br/>
🎧 So, we could plant different sized seeds in different ways, and see which grow best.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 We'd need to allow time for the seeds to come up.<br/>
🎧 That should be fine if we start now.<br/>
🎧 A lot of the other possible experiments need quite a bit longer.<br/>
🎧 So that'd make it a good one to choose.<br/>
🎧 And I don't suppose it'd need much equipment;<br/>
🎧 we're not doing chemical analysis or anything.<br/>
🎧 Though that's not really an issue,<br/>
🎧 we've got plenty of equipment in the laboratory.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. We need to have a word with the tutor if we're going to go ahead with it though.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure our aim's OK.<br/>
🎧 It's not very ambitious but the assignment's only ten percent of our final mark, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 But we need to be sure we're the only ones doing it.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, it's only five percent actually,<br/>
🎧 but it'd be a bit boring if everyone was doing it.<br/>
🎧 Did you read that book on seed germination on our reading list?<br/>
🎧 The one by Graves?<br/>
🎧 I looked through it for my last experiment,<br/>
🎧 though it wasn't all that relevant there.<br/>
🎧 It would be for this experiment, though.<br/>
🎧 I found it quite hard to follow -<br/>
🎧 lots about the theory, which I hadn't expected<br/>
🎧 Yes, I'd been hoping for something more practical.<br/>
🎧 It does include references to the recent findings on genetically-modified seeds, though.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that was interesting.<br/>
🎧 I read an article about seed germination by Lee Hall.<br/>
🎧 About seeds that lie in the ground for ages and only germinate after a fire?<br/>
🎧 That's the one.<br/>
🎧 I knew a bit about it already, but not about this research.<br/>
🎧 His analysis of figures comparing the times of the fires and the proportion of seeds that germinated<br/>
🎧 was done in a lot of detail - very impressive.<br/>
🎧 Was that the article with the illustrations of early stages of plant development?<br/>
🎧 They were very clear.<br/>
🎧 I think those diagrams were in another article.<br/>
🎧 Anyway, shall we have a look at the procedure for our experiment?<br/>
🎧 We'll need to get going with it quite soon.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So the first thing we have to do is find our seeds.<br/>
🎧 I think vegetable seeds would be best.<br/>
🎧 And obviously they mustn't all be the same size.<br/>
🎧 So, how many sorts do we need?<br/>
🎧 About four different ones?<br/>
🎧 I think that would be enough.<br/>
🎧 There'll be quite a large number of seeds for each one.<br/>
🎧 Then, for each seed we need to find out how much it weighs,<br/>
🎧 and also measure its dimensions,<br/>
🎧 and we need to keep a careful record of all that.<br/>
🎧 That'll be quite time-consuming.<br/>
🎧 And we also need to decide how deep we're going to plant the seeds -<br/>
🎧 right on the surface, a few millimetres down, or several centimetres.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So then we get planting.<br/>
🎧 Do you think we can plant several seeds together in the same plant pot?<br/>
🎧 No, I think we need a different one for each seed.<br/>
🎧 Right. And we'll need to label them.<br/>
🎧 We can use different coloured labels.<br/>
🎧 Then we wait for the seeds to germinate.<br/>
🎧 I reckon that'll be about three weeks, depending on what the weather's like.<br/>
🎧 Then we see if our plants have come up, and write down how tall they've grown.<br/>
🎧 Then all we have to do is look at our numbers, and see if there's any relation between them.<br/>
🎧 That's right. So …<br/><br />

🎧 Hi.<br/>
🎧 Today we're going to be looking at animals in urban environments<br/>
🎧 and I'm going to be telling you about some research on how they're affected by these environments.<br/>
🎧 Now, in evolutionary terms,<br/>
🎧 urban environments represent huge upheavals,<br/>
🎧 the sorts of massive changes that usually happen over millions of years.<br/>
🎧 And we used to think that only a few species could adapt to this new environment.<br/>
🎧 One species which is well known as being highly adaptable is the crow,<br/>
🎧 and there've been various studies about how they manage to learn new skills.<br/>
🎧 Another successful species is the pigeon,<br/>
🎧 because they're able to perch on ledges on the walls of city buildings,<br/>
🎧 just like they once perched on cliffs by the sea.<br/>
🎧 But in fact,<br/>
🎧 we're now finding that these early immigrants were just the start of a more general movement of animals into cities,<br/>
🎧 and of adaptation by these animals to city life.<br/>
🎧 And one thing that researchers are finding especially interesting<br/>
🎧 is the speed with which they're doing this -<br/>
🎧 we're not talking about gradual evolution here -<br/>
🎧 these animals are changing fast.<br/>
🎧 Let me tell you about some of the studies that have been carried out in this area.<br/>
🎧 So, in the University of Minnesota,<br/>
🎧 a biologist called Emilie Snell-Rood and her colleagues<br/>
🎧 looked at specimens of urbanised small mammals such as mice and gophers<br/>
🎧 that had been collected in Minnesota, and that are now kept in museums there.<br/>
🎧 And she looked at specimens that had been collected over the last hundred years,<br/>
🎧 which is a very short time in evolutionary terms.<br/>
🎧 And she found that during that time,<br/>
🎧 these small mammals had experienced a jump in brain size when compared to rural mammals.<br/>
🎧 Now, we can't be sure this means they're more intelligent,<br/>
🎧 but since the sizes of other parts of the body didn't change,<br/>
🎧 it does suggest that something cognitive was going on.<br/>
🎧 And Snell-Rood thinks that this change might reflect the cognitive demands of adjusting to city life -<br/>
🎧 having to look in different places to find food, for example,<br/>
🎧 and coping with a whole new set of dangers.<br/>
🎧 Then over in Germany at the Max Planck Institute,<br/>
🎧 there's another biologist called Catarina Miranda<br/>
🎧 who's done some experiments with blackbirds living in urban and rural areas.<br/>
🎧 And she's been looking not at their anatomy but at their behaviour.<br/>
🎧 So as you might expect, she's found that the urban blackbirds tend to be quite bold -<br/>
🎧 they're prepared to face up to a lot of threats that would frighten away their country counterparts.<br/>
🎧 But there's one type of situation that does seem to frighten the urban blackbirds,<br/>
🎧 and that's anything new - anything they haven't experienced before.<br/>
🎧 And if you think about it, that's quite sensible for a bird living in the city.<br/>
🎧 Jonathan Atwell, in Indiana University,<br/>
🎧 is looking at how a range of animals respond to urban environments.<br/>
🎧 He's found that when they're under stress,<br/>
🎧 their endocrine systems react by reducing the amount of hormones such as corticosterone into their blood.<br/>
🎧 It's a sensible-seeming adaptation.<br/>
🎧 A rat that gets scared every time a subway train rolls past won't be very successful.<br/>
🎧 There's just one more study I'd like to mention which is by Sarah Partan and her team,<br/>
🎧 and they've been looking at how squirrels communicate in an urban environment,<br/>
🎧 and they've found that a routine part of their communication is carried out by waving their tails.<br/>
🎧 You do also see this in the country, but it's much more prevalent in cities,<br/>
🎧 possibly because it's effective in a noisy environment.<br/>
🎧 So what are the long-term implications of this?<br/>
🎧 One possibility is that we may see completely new species developing in cities.<br/>
🎧 But on the other hand, it's possible that not all of these adaptations will be permanent.<br/>
🎧 Once the animal's got accustomed to its new environment,<br/>
🎧 it may no longer need the features it's developed.<br/>
🎧 So, now we've had a look…<br/>
<br/><br/>
