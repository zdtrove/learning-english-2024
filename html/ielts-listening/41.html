🎧 Hello, <span>Tourist <span>Information <span>Centre, <span>Mike <span>speaking, how can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Oh, hi.<br/>
🎧 I wanted to find out about <span>cookery <span>classes.<br/>
🎧 I <span>believe there are some <span>one-day <span>classes for <span>tourists?<br/>
🎧 Well, they're open to everyone, but <span>tourists are always <span>welcome.<br/>
🎧 OK, let me give you some <span>details of what's <span>available.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>several <span>classes.<br/>
🎧 One very <span>popular one is at the Food <span>Studio.<br/>
🎧 <span>OK<br/>
🎧 They focus on <span>seasonal <span>products,<br/>
🎧 and as well as <span>teaching you how to <span>cook them, they also show you how to choose them.<br/>
🎧 Right, that sounds good.<br/>
🎧 How big are the <span>classes?<br/>
🎧 I'm not sure exactly, but they'll be quite small.<br/>
🎧 And could I get a <span>private <span>lesson there?<br/>
🎧 I think <span>so… let me check,<br/>
🎧 yes, they do <span>offer those.<br/>
🎧 Though in <span>fact most of the people who <span>attend the <span>classes find it's a nice way of getting to know one another.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose it must be, yes.<br/>
🎧 And this company has a special <span>deal for <span>clients<br/>
🎧 where they <span>offer a <span>discount of <span>20% if you <span>return for a <span>further class.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 But you said there were <span>several <span>classes?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 Another one you might be interested in is <span>Bond's <span>Cookery School.<br/>
🎧 They're quite new,<br/>
🎧 they just <span>opened six <span>months ago, but I've heard good things about them.<br/>
🎧 They <span>concentrate on <span>teaching you to <span>prepare <span>healthy food,<br/>
🎧 and they have quite a lot of <span>specialist <span>staff.<br/>
🎧 So is that food for people on a <span>diet and things like that?<br/>
🎧 I don't know if I'd be interested in that.<br/>
🎧 Well, I don't think they <span>particularly focus on low <span>calorie <span>diets or <span>weight <span>loss.<br/>
🎧 It's more to do with <span>recipes that look at <span>specific needs,<br/>
🎧 like <span>including <span>ingredients that will help <span>build up your <span>bones and make them <span>stronger, that <span>sort of thing.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 Well, I might be interested, I'm not sure.<br/>
🎧 Do they have a <span>website I could check?<br/>
🎧 Yes, just key in the name of the school <span>- it'll come up.<br/>
🎧 And if you want to know more about them, every <span>Thursday <span>evening they have a <span>lecture at the school.<br/>
🎧 It's free and you don't need to book or anything, just <span>turn up at <span>7.30.<br/>
🎧 And that might give you an idea of <span>whether you want to go to an <span>actual class.<br/>
🎧 OK, there's one more place you might be interested in.<br/>
🎧 That's got a rather <span>strange name, it's called The <span>Arretsa <span>Centre <span>-<br/>
🎧 that's <span>spelled <span>ARRETSA.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 <span>They've got a very good <span>reputation.<br/>
🎧 They do a bit of <span>meat and <span>fish <span>cookery but they <span>mostly <span>specialise in <span>vegetarian <span>dishes.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>certainly an <span>area I'd like to learn more about.<br/>
🎧 I've got lots of friends who don't eat <span>meat.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact, I think I might have <span>seen that school today.<br/>
🎧 Is it just by the <span>market?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 So they don't have any <span>problem getting their <span>ingredients.<br/>
🎧 They're right next <span>door.<br/>
🎧 And they also <span>offer a special <span>two-hour course in how to use a <span>knife.<br/>
🎧 They <span>cover all the different <span>skills <span>- <span>buying them, <span>sharpening, <span>chopping <span>techniques.<br/>
🎧 It <span>gets <span>booked up quickly though so you'd need to check it was <span>available.<br/>
🎧 Right, well thank you very much.<br/>
🎧 I'll go <span>and…<br/><br />

🎧 Good <span>evening everyone.<br/>
🎧 My <span>name's <span>Phil <span>Sutton, and I'm <span>chairman of the <span>Highways <span>Committee.<br/>
🎧 We've called this <span>meeting to <span>inform <span>members of the <span>public<br/>
🎧 about the new <span>regulations for <span>traffic and <span>parking we're <span>proposing for <span>Granford.<br/>
🎧 I'll start by <span>summarising these changes before we open the <span>meeting to <span>questions.<br/>
🎧 So, why do we need to make these changes to <span>traffic <span>systems in <span>Granford?<br/>
🎧 Well, we're very <span>aware that <span>traffic is <span>becoming an <span>increasing <span>problem.<br/>
🎧 It's been <span>especially <span>noticeable with the <span>increase in <span>heavy <span>traffic while <span>they've been <span>building the new <span>hospital.<br/>
🎧 But it's the <span>overall <span>rise in the <span>volume of <span>traffic of all <span>kinds that's <span>concerning us.<br/>
🎧 To date there's not been any <span>increase in <span>traffic <span>accidents,<br/>
🎧 but that's not something we want to see <span>happen, <span>obviously.<br/>
🎧 We <span>recently <span>carried out a <span>survey of <span>local <span>residents,<br/>
🎧 and their <span>responses were <span>interesting.<br/>
🎧 People were very <span>concerned about the <span>lack of <span>visibility on some <span>roads<br/>
🎧 <span>due to <span>cars <span>parked along the <span>sides of the <span>roads.<br/>
🎧 We'd <span>expected <span>complaints about the <span>congestion near the <span>school<br/>
🎧 when <span>parents are <span>dropping off their children or <span>picking them up,<br/>
🎧 but this wasn't top of the <span>list,<br/>
🎧 and <span>nor were <span>noise and <span>fumes from <span>trucks and <span>lorries,<br/>
🎧 though they were <span>mentioned by some people.<br/>
🎧 We think these new <span>traffic <span>regulations would make a lot of <span>difference.<br/>
🎧 But we still have a long way to go.<br/>
🎧 We've <span>managed to keep our <span>proposals <span>within <span>budget, just, so they can be <span>covered by the <span>Council.<br/>
🎧 But, of course, it's no good <span>introducing new <span>regulations<br/>
🎧 if we don't have a way of <span>making sure that everyone <span>obeys them,<br/>
🎧 and that's an <span>area we're still working on with the help of <span>representatives from the <span>police <span>force.<br/>
🎧 OK, so this <span>slide <span>shows a map of the <span>central <span>area of <span>Granford,<br/>
🎧 with the High <span>Street in the <span>middle and School <span>Road on the right.<br/>
🎧 Now, we already have a set of <span>traffic <span>lights in the High <span>Street at the <span>junction with <span>Station <span>Road,<br/>
🎧 but we're planning to have another set at the other end, at the School <span>Road <span>junction,<br/>
🎧 to <span>regulate the <span>flow of <span>traffic along the High <span>Street.<br/>
🎧 We've <span>decided we definitely need a <span>pedestrian <span>crossing.<br/>
🎧 We <span>considered <span>putting this on School <span>Road, just outside the school,<br/>
🎧 but in the end we <span>decided that could <span>lead to a lot of <span>traffic <span>congestion<br/>
🎧 so we <span>decided to <span>locate it on the High <span>Street, <span>crossing the <span>road in <span>front of the <span>supermarket.<br/>
🎧 That's a very <span>busy <span>area, so it should help things there.<br/>
🎧 We're <span>proposing some changes to <span>parking.<br/>
🎧 At <span>present, <span>parking isn't <span>allowed on the High <span>Street outside the <span>library,<br/>
🎧 but we're going to change that, and <span>allow <span>parking there,<br/>
🎧 but not at the other end of the High <span>Street near School <span>Road.<br/>
🎧 <span>There'll be a new <span>'No <span>Parking' <span>sign on School <span>Road,<br/>
🎧 just by the <span>entrance to the school, <span>forbidding <span>parking for <span>25 <span>metres.<br/>
🎧 This should <span>improve <span>visibility for <span>drivers and <span>pedestrians,<br/>
🎧 <span>especially on the <span>bend just to the <span>north of the school.<br/>
🎧 As <span>far as <span>disabled <span>drivers are <span>concerned,<br/>
🎧 at <span>present they have <span>parking outside the <span>supermarket,<br/>
🎧 but <span>lorries also use those <span>spaces,<br/>
🎧 so we've got two new <span>disabled <span>parking <span>spaces on the side <span>road up <span>towards the <span>bank.<br/>
🎧 It's not <span>ideal, but probably better than the <span>present <span>arrangement.<br/>
🎧 We also plan to <span>widen the <span>pavement on School <span>Road.<br/>
🎧 We think we can <span>manage to get an <span>extra <span>half-metre on the <span>bend just before you get to the school,<br/>
🎧 on the same side of the <span>road.<br/>
🎧 Finally, we've <span>introduced new <span>restrictions on <span>loading and <span>unloading for the <span>supermarket,<br/>
🎧 so <span>lorries will only be <span>allowed to <span>stop there before <span>8 am.<br/>
🎧 That's the <span>supermarket on School <span>Road <span>-<br/>
🎧 we <span>kept to the <span>existing <span>arrangements with the High <span>Street <span>supermarket.<br/>
🎧 OK. So that's about <span>it...<br/><br />

🎧 We've got to choose a <span>topic for our <span>experiment, haven't we, <span>Jack?<br/>
🎧 Were you thinking of something to do with <span>seeds?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 I thought we could look at <span>seed <span>germination <span>- how a <span>seed <span>begins to <span>grow.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Any <span>particular <span>reason?<br/>
🎧 I know you're <span>hoping to work in <span>plant <span>science <span>eventually…<br/>
🎧 Yeah, but <span>practically everything we do is going to <span>feed into that.<br/>
🎧 No, there's an <span>optional <span>module on <span>seed <span>structure and <span>function in the <span>third year that I might do,<br/>
🎧 so I thought it might be <span>useful for that.<br/>
🎧 If I choose that option, I don't have to do a <span>dissertation <span>module.<br/>
🎧 Good idea.<br/>
🎧 Well, I thought for this <span>experiment we could look at the <span>relationship between <span>seed size and the way the <span>seeds are <span>planted.<br/>
🎧 So, we could <span>plant different <span>sized <span>seeds in different <span>ways, and see which <span>grow best.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 We'd need to <span>allow time for the <span>seeds to come up.<br/>
🎧 That should be fine if we start now.<br/>
🎧 A lot of the other <span>possible <span>experiments need quite a bit <span>longer.<br/>
🎧 So that'd make it a good one to choose.<br/>
🎧 And I don't <span>suppose it'd need much <span>equipment;<br/>
🎧 we're not doing <span>chemical <span>analysis or anything.<br/>
🎧 Though that's not really an issue,<br/>
🎧 we've got <span>plenty of <span>equipment in the <span>laboratory.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. We need to have a <span>word with the <span>tutor if we're going to go ahead with it though.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure our <span>aim's OK.<br/>
🎧 It's not very <span>ambitious but the <span>assignment's only ten <span>percent of our <span>final <span>mark, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 But we need to be sure we're the only <span>ones doing it.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, it's only <span>five <span>percent actually,<br/>
🎧 but it'd be a bit <span>boring if everyone was doing it.<br/>
🎧 Did you read that book on <span>seed <span>germination on our <span>reading <span>list?<br/>
🎧 The one by <span>Graves?<br/>
🎧 I <span>looked through it for my last <span>experiment,<br/>
🎧 though it wasn't all that <span>relevant there.<br/>
🎧 It would be for this <span>experiment, though.<br/>
🎧 I <span>found it quite <span>hard to <span>follow <span>-<br/>
🎧 lots about the <span>theory, which I hadn't <span>expected<br/>
🎧 Yes, I'd been <span>hoping for something more <span>practical.<br/>
🎧 It does <span>include <span>references to the <span>recent <span>findings on <span>genetically-modified <span>seeds, though.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that was <span>interesting.<br/>
🎧 I read an <span>article about <span>seed <span>germination by <span>Lee <span>Hall.<br/>
🎧 About <span>seeds that <span>lie in the <span>ground for <span>ages and only <span>germinate after a <span>fire?<br/>
🎧 That's the one.<br/>
🎧 I <span>knew a bit about it already, but not about this <span>research.<br/>
🎧 His <span>analysis of <span>figures <span>comparing the <span>times of the <span>fires and the <span>proportion of <span>seeds that <span>germinated<br/>
🎧 was done in a lot of <span>detail <span>- very <span>impressive.<br/>
🎧 Was that the <span>article with the <span>illustrations of <span>early <span>stages of <span>plant <span>development?<br/>
🎧 They were very <span>clear.<br/>
🎧 I think those <span>diagrams were in another <span>article.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway, shall we have a look at the <span>procedure for our <span>experiment?<br/>
🎧 We'll need to get going with it quite soon.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So the first thing we have to do is find our <span>seeds.<br/>
🎧 I think <span>vegetable <span>seeds would be best.<br/>
🎧 And <span>obviously they mustn't all be the same size.<br/>
🎧 So, how many <span>sorts do we need?<br/>
🎧 About <span>four different <span>ones?<br/>
🎧 I think that would be enough.<br/>
🎧 <span>There'll be quite a large number of <span>seeds for each one.<br/>
🎧 Then, for each <span>seed we need to find out how much it <span>weighs,<br/>
🎧 and also <span>measure its <span>dimensions,<br/>
🎧 and we need to keep a <span>careful <span>record of all that.<br/>
🎧 <span>That'll be quite <span>time-consuming.<br/>
🎧 And we also need to decide how <span>deep we're going to <span>plant the <span>seeds <span>-<br/>
🎧 right on the <span>surface, a few <span>millimetres down, or <span>several <span>centimetres.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So then we get <span>planting.<br/>
🎧 Do you think we can <span>plant <span>several <span>seeds together in the same <span>plant pot?<br/>
🎧 No, I think we need a different one for each <span>seed.<br/>
🎧 Right. And we'll need to <span>label them.<br/>
🎧 We can use different <span>coloured <span>labels.<br/>
🎧 Then we wait for the <span>seeds to <span>germinate.<br/>
🎧 I <span>reckon <span>that'll be about <span>three <span>weeks, <span>depending on what the <span>weather's like.<br/>
🎧 Then we see if our <span>plants have come up, and <span>write down how <span>tall <span>they've <span>grown.<br/>
🎧 Then all we have to do is look at our <span>numbers, and see if there's any <span>relation between them.<br/>
🎧 That's right. So <span>…<br/><br />

🎧 Hi.<br/>
🎧 Today we're going to be looking at <span>animals in <span>urban <span>environments<br/>
🎧 and I'm going to be <span>telling you about some <span>research on how they're <span>affected by these <span>environments.<br/>
🎧 Now, in <span>evolutionary <span>terms,<br/>
🎧 <span>urban <span>environments <span>represent <span>huge <span>upheavals,<br/>
🎧 the <span>sorts of <span>massive changes that usually <span>happen over <span>millions of years.<br/>
🎧 And we used to think that only a few <span>species could <span>adapt to this new <span>environment.<br/>
🎧 One <span>species which is well <span>known as being <span>highly <span>adaptable is the <span>crow,<br/>
🎧 and <span>there've been <span>various <span>studies about how they <span>manage to learn new <span>skills.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>successful <span>species is the <span>pigeon,<br/>
🎧 because they're able to <span>perch on <span>ledges on the <span>walls of <span>city <span>buildings,<br/>
🎧 just like they once <span>perched on <span>cliffs by the sea.<br/>
🎧 But in <span>fact,<br/>
🎧 we're now <span>finding that these <span>early <span>immigrants were just the start of a more <span>general <span>movement of <span>animals into <span>cities,<br/>
🎧 and of <span>adaptation by these <span>animals to <span>city life.<br/>
🎧 And one thing that <span>researchers are <span>finding <span>especially <span>interesting<br/>
🎧 is the <span>speed with which they're doing this <span>-<br/>
🎧 we're not talking about <span>gradual <span>evolution here <span>-<br/>
🎧 these <span>animals are <span>changing <span>fast.<br/>
🎧 Let me tell you about some of the <span>studies that have been <span>carried out in this <span>area.<br/>
🎧 So, in the University of <span>Minnesota,<br/>
🎧 a <span>biologist called <span>Emilie <span>Snell-Rood and her <span>colleagues<br/>
🎧 <span>looked at <span>specimens of <span>urbanised small <span>mammals such as <span>mice and <span>gophers<br/>
🎧 that had been <span>collected in <span>Minnesota, and that are now <span>kept in <span>museums there.<br/>
🎧 And she <span>looked at <span>specimens that had been <span>collected over the last <span>hundred years,<br/>
🎧 which is a very short time in <span>evolutionary <span>terms.<br/>
🎧 And she <span>found that during that time,<br/>
🎧 these small <span>mammals had <span>experienced a <span>jump in <span>brain size when <span>compared to <span>rural <span>mammals.<br/>
🎧 Now, we can't be sure this <span>means they're more <span>intelligent,<br/>
🎧 but since the <span>sizes of other <span>parts of the <span>body didn't change,<br/>
🎧 it does <span>suggest that something <span>cognitive was going on.<br/>
🎧 And <span>Snell-Rood <span>thinks that this change might <span>reflect the <span>cognitive <span>demands of <span>adjusting to <span>city life <span>-<br/>
🎧 having to look in different <span>places to find food, for example,<br/>
🎧 and <span>coping with a whole new set of <span>dangers.<br/>
🎧 Then over in <span>Germany at the <span>Max <span>Planck <span>Institute,<br/>
🎧 there's another <span>biologist called <span>Catarina <span>Miranda<br/>
🎧 who's done some <span>experiments with <span>blackbirds living in <span>urban and <span>rural <span>areas.<br/>
🎧 And she's been looking not at their <span>anatomy but at their <span>behaviour.<br/>
🎧 So as you might <span>expect, she's <span>found that the <span>urban <span>blackbirds <span>tend to be quite <span>bold <span>-<br/>
🎧 they're <span>prepared to <span>face up to a lot of <span>threats that would <span>frighten away their <span>country <span>counterparts.<br/>
🎧 But there's one <span>type of <span>situation that does <span>seem to <span>frighten the <span>urban <span>blackbirds,<br/>
🎧 and that's anything new <span>- anything they haven't <span>experienced before.<br/>
🎧 And if you think about it, that's quite <span>sensible for a <span>bird living in the <span>city.<br/>
🎧 <span>Jonathan <span>Atwell, in <span>Indiana University,<br/>
🎧 is looking at how a <span>range of <span>animals <span>respond to <span>urban <span>environments.<br/>
🎧 He's <span>found that when they're under <span>stress,<br/>
🎧 their <span>endocrine <span>systems <span>react by <span>reducing the amount of <span>hormones such as <span>corticosterone into their <span>blood.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>sensible-seeming <span>adaptation.<br/>
🎧 A <span>rat that <span>gets <span>scared every time a <span>subway <span>train <span>rolls <span>past won't be very <span>successful.<br/>
🎧 There's just one more <span>study I'd like to <span>mention which is by <span>Sarah <span>Partan and her <span>team,<br/>
🎧 and <span>they've been looking at how <span>squirrels <span>communicate in an <span>urban <span>environment,<br/>
🎧 and <span>they've <span>found that a <span>routine <span>part of their <span>communication is <span>carried out by <span>waving their <span>tails.<br/>
🎧 You do also see this in the <span>country, but it's much more <span>prevalent in <span>cities,<br/>
🎧 <span>possibly because it's <span>effective in a <span>noisy <span>environment.<br/>
🎧 So what are the <span>long-term <span>implications of this?<br/>
🎧 One <span>possibility is that we may see <span>completely new <span>species <span>developing in <span>cities.<br/>
🎧 But on the other <span>hand, it's <span>possible that not all of these <span>adaptations will be <span>permanent.<br/>
🎧 Once the <span>animal's got <span>accustomed to its new <span>environment,<br/>
🎧 it may no <span>longer need the <span>features it's <span>developed.<br/>
🎧 So, now we've had a <span>look…<br/>
<br/><br/>
