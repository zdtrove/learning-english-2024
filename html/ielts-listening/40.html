🎧 Hello, Pembroke Cycling Holidays, Bob speaking.<br/>
🎧 Oh hello.<br/>
🎧 I've seen your advert for people to lead cycle trips.<br/>
🎧 Are you the right person to speak to?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I am.<br/>
🎧 Could I have your name, please?<br/>
🎧 It's Margaret Smith.<br/>
🎧 Are you looking for a permanent job, Margaret?<br/>
🎧 No, temporary.<br/>
🎧 I've got a permanent job starting in a few months' time,<br/>
🎧 and I want to do something else until then.<br/>
🎧 What work do you do?<br/>
🎧 This will probably sound crazy - I used to be a lawyer,<br/>
🎧 and then I made a complete career change and I'm going to be a doctor.<br/>
🎧 I've just finished my training.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And have you had any experience of leading cycle trips?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I've led several bike tours in Africa.<br/>
🎧 The trip to India that I had arranged to lead next month has now been cancelled,<br/>
🎧 so when I saw you were advertising for tour leaders, I decided to apply.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Now we normally have two or three leaders on a trip, depending on the size of the group.<br/>
🎧 Some tours are for very experienced cyclists,<br/>
🎧 but we've got a tour coming up soon in Spain,<br/>
🎧 which is proving so popular we need an additional leader.<br/>
🎧 It's a cycling holiday for families. Would that suit you?<br/>
🎧 It certainly would.<br/>
🎧 I enjoy working with children,<br/>
🎧 and I probably need some more experience before I go on a really challenging trip.<br/>
🎧 That tour includes several teenagers;<br/>
🎧 have you worked with that age group before?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I'm a volunteer worker in a youth club,<br/>
🎧 where I help people to improve their cycling skills.<br/>
🎧 Before that I helped out in a cycling club where I taught beginners.<br/>
🎧 Well that's great.<br/>
🎧 Now the trip I mentioned is just for a fortnight,<br/>
🎧 but there might be the possibility of leading other tours after that.<br/>
🎧 Would that fit in with your plans?<br/>
🎧 That'd be fine.<br/>
🎧 I'll be free for five months.<br/>
🎧 My job is due to start on October the 2nd,<br/>
🎧 and I'm available from May the 1st until late September.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 Now is there anything I need to know about the food you eat?<br/>
🎧 We usually have one or two people in the group who don't eat meat,<br/>
🎧 or have some sort of food allergy,<br/>
🎧 so we're always very careful about that.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I'm allergic to cheese.<br/>
🎧 Would that be a problem?<br/>
🎧 No, as long as we have enough notice, we can deal with that.<br/>
🎧 That's great.<br/>
🎧 It sounds really interesting!<br/>
🎧 Would you like me to fill in an application form?<br/>
🎧 Yes, please.<br/>
🎧 Where should I post it to?<br/>
🎧 Could you send it to 27 Arbuthnot Place,<br/>
🎧 A-R-B-U-T-H-N-O-T - Place, Dumfries.<br/>
🎧 And what's the postcode, please?<br/>
🎧 DG7 4PH.<br/>
🎧 Was that P Papa or B Bravo?<br/>
🎧 P Papa.<br/>
🎧 Got that.<br/>
🎧 If you could return the application form by Friday this week, we can interview you on Tuesday next week.<br/>
🎧 Say half past two.<br/>
🎧 Would that be possible for you?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's fine.<br/>
🎧 You're quite a long way from where I live, so I'll drive over on Monday.<br/>
🎧 Should I bring anything to the interview?<br/>
🎧 We'll have your application form, of course,<br/>
🎧 but we'll need to see any certificates you've got that are relevant, in cycling, first aid, or whatever.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And at the interview we'd like to find out about your experience of being a tour guide,<br/>
🎧 so could you prepare a 10 minute talk about that, please?<br/>
🎧 You don't need slides or any complicated equipment - just some notes.<br/>
🎧 Right. I'll start thinking about that straightaway!<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 Well, we'll look forward to receiving your application form, and we'll contact you to confirm the interview.<br/>
🎧 Thanks very much.<br/>
🎧 Thank you, Margaret. Goodbye.<br/>
🎧 Bye.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Welcome to this podcast about the Sheepmarket, which is one of the oldest parts of the city.<br/>
🎧 As its name suggests, there was originally a market here where farmers brought their sheep,<br/>
🎧 but now it's been redeveloped into a buzzing, vibrant area of the city,<br/>
🎧 which is also home to one of the city's fastest-growing communities.<br/>
🎧 The nearby university has always meant the area's popular with students, who come in to enjoy the lively nightlife,<br/>
🎧 but now graduates embarking on careers in the worlds of fashion and design<br/>
🎧 are buying up the new apartments recently built here<br/>
🎧 to replace the small houses where the market workers used to live.<br/>
🎧 The narrow old side streets are great places for finding original pictures, jewellery and ceramics which won't break the bank,<br/>
🎧 as well as local produce like fruit and vegetables.<br/>
🎧 There's also lots of pavement cafes where you can have a coffee and watch tourists from all over the world go by.<br/>
🎧 The oldest buildings in the area are on the main streets,<br/>
🎧 including the city's first department store, built in the 1880s, which is still open today.<br/>
🎧 The Sheepmarket is a centre for fashion,<br/>
🎧 and there's a policy of encouraging new young designers.<br/>
🎧 The Young Fashion competition is open to local young people who are passionate about fashion.<br/>
🎧 This year they've been asked to design an outfit based on ideas from the music and technology that's part of their everyday life,<br/>
🎧 using both natural and man-made fibres.<br/>
🎧 The garments will be judged by a panel of experts and fashion designers,<br/>
🎧 and the winning entries will be modelled at a special gala evening.<br/>
🎧 Parking at the Sheepmarket is easy.<br/>
🎧 There are plenty of pay and display car parking spaces on the roadsides<br/>
🎧 which are fine if you just want to stay for an hour or two,<br/>
🎧 but if you want to spend the day there, it's better to park in one of the four underground car parks.<br/>
🎧 It's not expensive and if you can present a receipt from one of the local stores, you'll not be charged at all.<br/>
🎧 After six pm many of the car parks have a flat rate which varies but it is usually very reasonable.<br/>
🎧 The Sheepmarket is one of the main centres for art and history in the whole of the country.<br/>
🎧 If you look at our map, you'll see some of the main attractions there.<br/>
🎧 Most visitors start from Crawley Road, at the bottom of the map.<br/>
🎧 The Reynolds House is one of the oldest houses in the city, and is open to the public.<br/>
🎧 It's on the north side of Crawley Road, next to the footpath that leads to the public gardens.<br/>
🎧 The area's particularly interesting for its unusual sculptures.<br/>
🎧 The Thumb is just what its name suggests, but it's about 10 metres high.<br/>
🎧 You'll see it on Hill Road, across the road from the Bank.<br/>
🎧 The Museum's got a particularly fine collection of New Zealand landscapes.<br/>
🎧 It's on the east side of the Sheepmarket, on City Road.<br/>
🎧 It's on the other side of the road from the public gardens, immediately facing the junction with Hill Road.<br/>
🎧 The Contemporary Art Gallery is on a little road that leads off Station Square, not far from the public gardens.<br/>
🎧 The road ends at the gallery - it doesn't go anywhere else.<br/>
🎧 That's open every day except Mondays.<br/>
🎧 The Warner Gallery specialises in 19th-century art.<br/>
🎧 It's on City Road, near the junction with Crawley Road,<br/>
🎧 on the same side of the road as the public gardens.<br/>
🎧 It's open on weekdays from 9 to 5, and entry is free.<br/>
🎧 Finally, if you're interested in purchasing high quality artwork,<br/>
🎧 the place to go is Nucleus.<br/>
🎧 You need to go from Crawley Road up through Station Square and east along Hill Road<br/>
🎧 until you get to a small winding road turning off.<br/>
🎧 Go up there and it's on your right -<br/>
🎧 if you get to City Road you've gone too far.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Joe, you know I'm giving a presentation in our film studies class next week?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Well, could we discuss it?<br/>
🎧 I could do with getting someone else's opinion.<br/>
🎧 Of course, Katie. What are you going to talk about?<br/>
🎧 It's about film adaptations of Shakespeare's plays.<br/>
🎧 I've got very interested in all the different approaches that film directors take.<br/>
🎧 So I thought I'd start with Giannetti, who's a professor of film and literature,<br/>
🎧 and in one of his books he came up with a straightforward classification of film adaptations<br/>
🎧 based on how faithful they are to the original plays and novels.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I've already made some notes on that,<br/>
🎧 so I just need to sort those out before the presentation.<br/>
🎧 I thought that next I'd ask the class to come up with the worst examples of Shakespeare adaptations that they've seen,<br/>
🎧 and to say why.<br/>
🎧 That should be more fun than having their favourite versions.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I can certainly think of a couple!<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Next I want to talk about Rachel Malchow.<br/>
🎧 I came across something on the internet about her work on film adaptations,<br/>
🎧 and I was thinking of showing some film clips to illustrate her ideas.<br/>
🎧 Will you have enough time, though?<br/>
🎧 Both to prepare and during the presentation?<br/>
🎧 After all, I doubt if you'll be able to find all the clips you want.<br/>
🎧 Perhaps you're right.<br/>
🎧 OK, well, I'd better do some slides instead,<br/>
🎧 saying how various films relate to what she says.<br/>
🎧 That should encourage discussion.<br/>
🎧 Next I want to say something about how plays may be chosen for adaptation<br/>
🎧 because they're concerned with issues of the time when the film is made.<br/>
🎧 You mean things like patriotism, or the role of governments?<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 It's quite tricky, but I've got a few ideas I'd like to discuss.<br/>
🎧 And finally I want to talk about a few adaptations that I think illustrate a range of approaches,<br/>
🎧 and make some comments on them.<br/>
🎧 Do you know the Japanese film Ran?<br/>
🎧 I haven't seen it.<br/>
🎧 It was based on Shakespeare's King Lear, wasn't it?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 It was a very loose adaptation, using the same situation and story,<br/>
🎧 but moving it to 16th century Japan instead of 16th century Britain.<br/>
🎧 So for example the king's daughters become sons,<br/>
🎧 because in Japanese culture at that time, women couldn't succeed to the throne.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 I hope you're going to talk about the 1993 film of Much Ado About Nothing.<br/>
🎧 I think that's one of the best Shakespeare films.<br/>
🎧 It really brings the play to life, doesn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I agree.<br/>
🎧 And I think filming it in Italy, where the play is set,<br/>
🎧 makes you see what life was like at the time of the play.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely. Right, what's next?<br/>
🎧 Er, next, I thought Romeo & Juliet, the 1996 film,<br/>
🎧 which moves the action into the present day.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it worked really well, I thought -<br/>
🎧 changing the two feuding families in the original to two competing business empires,<br/>
🎧 even though they're speaking in the English of the original play.<br/>
🎧 You'd expect it would sound really bizarre,<br/>
🎧 but I found I soon got used to it.<br/>
🎧 Me too.<br/>
🎧 Then I thought I'd include a real Hollywood film,<br/>
🎧 one that's intended to appeal to a mass commercial audience.<br/>
🎧 There must be quite a number of those.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but I've picked the 1996 film of Hamlet.<br/>
🎧 It included every line of the text,<br/>
🎧 but it's more like a typical action hero movie -<br/>
🎧 there are loads of special effects, but no unifying interpretation of the play.<br/>
🎧 All show and no substance.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 Then there's Prospero's Books, based on The Tempest.<br/>
🎧 That was really innovative, from a stylistic point of view.<br/>
🎧 Didn't it include dance and singing and animation, as well as live actors?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it did.<br/>
🎧 I also want to mention Looking for Richard.<br/>
🎧 Did you ever see it?<br/>
🎧 No, but I've read about it.<br/>
🎧 It was a blend of a documentary with a few scenes from Richard III, wasn't it?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 It's more a way of looking into how people nowadays connect with the playwright -<br/>
🎧 the play is really just the starting point.<br/>
🎧 And that'll be where I finish.<br/>
🎧 Well, it sounds as though it'll be very interesting.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 This lecture will be about the science of acoustics, the study of sound,<br/>
🎧 in relation to urban environments such as cities.<br/>
🎧 As an acoustic engineer myself,<br/>
🎧 I think this is an area where we're likely to see great changes.<br/>
🎧 In the past, researching urban soundscapes was simple.<br/>
🎧 We measured levels of sound in decibels,<br/>
🎧 so I used to take my sound meter and I measured the noise somewhere,<br/>
🎧 and then I might ask a sample of people to say at what level the sound became annoying.<br/>
🎧 With data like this, acoustic engineers have been able to build up what we call noise maps,<br/>
🎧 maps of the sound environment.<br/>
🎧 But actually these aren't a lot of use.<br/>
🎧 What they do show is that the highest noise levels are generally on roads.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's not really very surprising.<br/>
🎧 But there's quite a lot going on that these maps don't show,<br/>
🎧 because they can't capture the complex way that sound varies over time.<br/>
🎧 So they ignore important issues such as the noise someone might hear from the open windows<br/>
🎧 or gardens of their neighbours,<br/>
🎧 and this sort of noise can be quite significant in summer.<br/>
🎧 We don't have any databases on this sort of information.<br/>
🎧 As well as that, these records of sound levels take no account of the fact that people vary in their perceptions of noise -<br/>
🎧 so someone like me with years of working in acoustics might be very different from you in that regard.<br/>
🎧 But anyway, even though these noise maps are fairly crude,<br/>
🎧 they've been useful in providing information<br/>
🎧 and raising awareness that noise matters,<br/>
🎧 we need to deal with it and so it's a political matter.<br/>
🎧 And that's important -<br/>
🎧 we need rules and regulations because noise can cause all sorts of problems.<br/>
🎧 Those of you who are city-dwellers know that things go on 24 hours a day,<br/>
🎧 so city-dwellers often suffer from interrupted sleep.<br/>
🎧 It's also known that noise can lead to a rise in levels of stress,<br/>
🎧 due to physical changes in the body affecting the composition of the blood.<br/>
🎧 And there are other problems as well,<br/>
🎧 for instance if schoolchildren don't have a quiet place to study, their work will suffer.<br/>
🎧 Now, one problem with decibel measurement is that it doesn't differentiate between different types of noise.<br/>
🎧 Some types of sounds that most people would probably think of as nice and relaxing<br/>
🎧 might well score quite highly in decibel levels -<br/>
🎧 think of the sound made by a fountain in a town square, for example.<br/>
🎧 That's not necessarily something that we'd want to control or reduce.<br/>
🎧 So maybe researchers should consider these sorts of sounds in urban design.<br/>
🎧 This is going to be tricky<br/>
🎧 because just measuring decibel levels isn't going to help us here.<br/>
🎧 Instead, many researchers are using social science techniques,<br/>
🎧 studying people's emotional response to sound by using questionnaires and so on.<br/>
🎧 So what exactly do people want to hear in an urban environment?<br/>
🎧 Some recent interdisciplinary research has come out with results that at first sight seem contradictory -<br/>
🎧 a city needs to have a sense of activity, so it needs to be lively,<br/>
🎧 with sounds like the clack of high heels on a pavement or the hiss of a coffee machine,<br/>
🎧 but these mustn't be too intrusive,<br/>
🎧 because at the same time we need to be able to relax.<br/>
🎧 One of the major problems in achieving this will be getting architects and town planners to use the research.<br/>
🎧 Apart from studying the basics of acoustics,<br/>
🎧 these people receive very little training in this area.<br/>
🎧 But in fact they should be regarding sound as an opportunity to add to the experience of urban living,<br/>
🎧 whereas at present, they tend to see it as something to be avoided or reduced as far as possible,<br/>
🎧 or something that's just a job for engineers like the street drainage system.<br/>
🎧 What's needed is for noise in cities to be regarded as an aesthetic quality,<br/>
🎧 as something that has the qualities of an art form.<br/>
🎧 If we acknowledge this, then we urgently need to know what governs it and how designers can work with it.<br/>
🎧 We need to develop a complex understanding of many factors.<br/>
🎧 What is the relationship between sound and culture?<br/>
🎧 What can we learn from disciplines such as psychology about the way that sound interacts with human development and social relationships,<br/>
🎧 and the way that sound affects our thoughts and feelings?<br/>
🎧 Can we learn anything from physics about the nature of sound itself?<br/>
🎧 Today's powerful technologies can also help us.<br/>
🎧 To show us their ideas and help us to imagine the effect their buildings will have,<br/>
🎧 architects and town planners already use virtual reality -<br/>
🎧 but these programs are silent.<br/>
🎧 In the future such programs could use realistic sounds,<br/>
🎧 meaning that soundscapes could be explored before being built.<br/>
🎧 So hopefully, using the best technology we can lay our hands on,<br/>
🎧 the city of the future will be a pleasure to the ears as well as the eyes.<br/>
<br/><br/>
