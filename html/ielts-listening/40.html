🎧 Hello, <span>Pembroke</span> <span>Cycling</span> <span>Holidays</span>, <span>Bob</span> <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh hello.<br/>
🎧 I've <span>seen</span> your <span>advert</span> for people to <span>lead</span> <span>cycle</span> <span>trips</span>.<br/>
🎧 Are you the right person to speak to?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I am.<br/>
🎧 Could I have your name, please?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>Margaret</span> <span>Smith</span>.<br/>
🎧 Are you looking for a <span>permanent</span> <span>job</span>, <span>Margaret</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, <span>temporary</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've got a <span>permanent</span> <span>job</span> <span>starting</span> in a few <span>months'</span> time,<br/>
🎧 and I want to do something else until then.<br/>
🎧 What work do you do?<br/>
🎧 This will probably sound <span>crazy</span> <span>-</span> I used to be a <span>lawyer</span>,<br/>
🎧 and then I made a <span>complete</span> <span>career</span> change and I'm going to be a <span>doctor</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've just <span>finished</span> my <span>training</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And have you had any <span>experience</span> of <span>leading</span> <span>cycle</span> <span>trips</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I've <span>led</span> <span>several</span> <span>bike</span> <span>tours</span> in <span>Africa</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>trip</span> to <span>India</span> that I had <span>arranged</span> to <span>lead</span> next month has now been <span>cancelled</span>,<br/>
🎧 so when I saw you were <span>advertising</span> for <span>tour</span> <span>leaders</span>, I <span>decided</span> to <span>apply</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Now we <span>normally</span> have two or <span>three</span> <span>leaders</span> on a <span>trip</span>, <span>depending</span> on the size of the group.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>tours</span> are for very <span>experienced</span> <span>cyclists</span>,<br/>
🎧 but we've got a <span>tour</span> <span>coming</span> up soon in <span>Spain</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is <span>proving</span> so <span>popular</span> we need an <span>additional</span> <span>leader</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>cycling</span> <span>holiday</span> for <span>families</span>. Would that <span>suit</span> you?<br/>
🎧 It <span>certainly</span> would.<br/>
🎧 I enjoy working with children,<br/>
🎧 and I probably need some more <span>experience</span> before I go on a really <span>challenging</span> <span>trip</span>.<br/>
🎧 That <span>tour</span> <span>includes</span> <span>several</span> <span>teenagers;<br/></span>
🎧 have you <span>worked</span> with that age group before?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I'm a <span>volunteer</span> <span>worker</span> in a <span>youth</span> <span>club</span>,<br/>
🎧 where I help people to <span>improve</span> their <span>cycling</span> <span>skills</span>.<br/>
🎧 Before that I <span>helped</span> out in a <span>cycling</span> <span>club</span> where I <span>taught</span> <span>beginners</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well that's great.<br/>
🎧 Now the <span>trip</span> I <span>mentioned</span> is just for a <span>fortnight</span>,<br/>
🎧 but there might be the <span>possibility</span> of <span>leading</span> other <span>tours</span> after that.<br/>
🎧 Would that fit in with your <span>plans</span>?<br/>
🎧 That'd be fine.<br/>
🎧 I'll be free for <span>five</span> <span>months</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>job</span> is <span>due</span> to start on <span>October</span> the <span>2nd</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I'm <span>available</span> from May the <span>1st</span> until <span>late</span> <span>September</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 Now is there anything I need to know about the food you eat?<br/>
🎧 We usually have one or two people in the group who don't eat <span>meat</span>,<br/>
🎧 or have some <span>sort</span> of food <span>allergy</span>,<br/>
🎧 so we're always very <span>careful</span> about that.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I'm <span>allergic</span> to <span>cheese</span>.<br/>
🎧 Would that be a <span>problem</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, as long as we have enough <span>notice</span>, we can <span>deal</span> with that.<br/>
🎧 That's great.<br/>
🎧 It sounds really <span>interesting</span>!<br/>
🎧 Would you like me to <span>fill</span> in an <span>application</span> <span>form</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, please.<br/>
🎧 Where should I <span>post</span> it to?<br/>
🎧 Could you <span>send</span> it to <span>27</span> <span>Arbuthnot</span> Place,<br/>
🎧 <span>A-R-B-U-T-H-N-O-T</span> <span>-</span> Place, <span>Dumfries</span>.<br/>
🎧 And what's the <span>postcode</span>, please?<br/>
🎧 <span>DG7</span> <span>4PH</span>.<br/>
🎧 Was that <span>P</span> <span>Papa</span> or <span>B</span> <span>Bravo</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>P</span> <span>Papa</span>.<br/>
🎧 Got that.<br/>
🎧 If you could <span>return</span> the <span>application</span> <span>form</span> by <span>Friday</span> this week, we can <span>interview</span> you on <span>Tuesday</span> next week.<br/>
🎧 Say <span>half</span> <span>past</span> two.<br/>
🎧 Would that be <span>possible</span> for you?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's fine.<br/>
🎧 You're quite a long way from where I live, so I'll drive over on <span>Monday</span>.<br/>
🎧 Should I <span>bring</span> anything to the <span>interview</span>?<br/>
🎧 We'll have your <span>application</span> <span>form</span>, of course,<br/>
🎧 but we'll need to see any <span>certificates</span> you've got that are <span>relevant</span>, in <span>cycling</span>, first <span>aid</span>, or whatever.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And at the <span>interview</span> we'd like to find out about your <span>experience</span> of being a <span>tour</span> <span>guide</span>,<br/>
🎧 so could you <span>prepare</span> a <span>10</span> <span>minute</span> talk about that, please?<br/>
🎧 You don't need <span>slides</span> or any <span>complicated</span> <span>equipment</span> <span>-</span> just some <span>notes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right. I'll start thinking about that <span>straightaway</span>!<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 Well, we'll look forward to <span>receiving</span> your <span>application</span> <span>form</span>, and we'll <span>contact</span> you to <span>confirm</span> the <span>interview</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks very much.<br/>
🎧 Thank you, <span>Margaret</span>. <span>Goodbye</span>.<br/>
🎧 Bye.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 <span>Welcome</span> to this <span>podcast</span> about the <span>Sheepmarket</span>, which is one of the <span>oldest</span> <span>parts</span> of the <span>city</span>.<br/>
🎧 As its name <span>suggests</span>, there was <span>originally</span> a <span>market</span> here where <span>farmers</span> <span>brought</span> their <span>sheep</span>,<br/>
🎧 but now it's been <span>redeveloped</span> into a <span>buzzing</span>, <span>vibrant</span> <span>area</span> of the <span>city</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is also home to one of the <span>city's</span> <span>fastest-growing</span> <span>communities</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>nearby</span> university has always <span>meant</span> the <span>area's</span> <span>popular</span> with students, who come in to enjoy the <span>lively</span> <span>nightlife</span>,<br/>
🎧 but now <span>graduates</span> <span>embarking</span> on <span>careers</span> in the <span>worlds</span> of <span>fashion</span> and <span>design<br/></span>
🎧 are <span>buying</span> up the new <span>apartments</span> <span>recently</span> <span>built</span> <span>here<br/></span>
🎧 to <span>replace</span> the small <span>houses</span> where the <span>market</span> <span>workers</span> used to live.<br/>
🎧 The <span>narrow</span> old side <span>streets</span> are great <span>places</span> for <span>finding</span> <span>original</span> <span>pictures</span>, <span>jewellery</span> and <span>ceramics</span> which won't <span>break</span> the <span>bank</span>,<br/>
🎧 as well as <span>local</span> <span>produce</span> like <span>fruit</span> and <span>vegetables</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's also lots of <span>pavement</span> <span>cafes</span> where you can have a <span>coffee</span> and <span>watch</span> <span>tourists</span> from all over the <span>world</span> go by.<br/>
🎧 The <span>oldest</span> <span>buildings</span> in the <span>area</span> are on the <span>main</span> <span>streets</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>including</span> the <span>city's</span> first <span>department</span> <span>store</span>, <span>built</span> in the <span>1880s</span>, which is still open today.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Sheepmarket</span> is a <span>centre</span> for <span>fashion</span>,<br/>
🎧 and there's a <span>policy</span> of <span>encouraging</span> new young <span>designers</span>.<br/>
🎧 The Young <span>Fashion</span> <span>competition</span> is open to <span>local</span> young people who are <span>passionate</span> about <span>fashion</span>.<br/>
🎧 This year <span>they've</span> been <span>asked</span> to <span>design</span> an <span>outfit</span> <span>based</span> on <span>ideas</span> from the music and <span>technology</span> that's <span>part</span> of their everyday life,<br/>
🎧 <span>using</span> both <span>natural</span> and <span>man-made</span> <span>fibres</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>garments</span> will be <span>judged</span> by a <span>panel</span> of <span>experts</span> and <span>fashion</span> <span>designers</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>winning</span> <span>entries</span> will be <span>modelled</span> at a special <span>gala</span> <span>evening</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Parking</span> at the <span>Sheepmarket</span> is easy.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>plenty</span> of pay and <span>display</span> car <span>parking</span> <span>spaces</span> on the <span>roadsides<br/></span>
🎧 which are fine if you just want to <span>stay</span> for an <span>hour</span> or two,<br/>
🎧 but if you want to <span>spend</span> the day there, it's better to <span>park</span> in one of the <span>four</span> <span>underground</span> car <span>parks</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's not <span>expensive</span> and if you can <span>present</span> a <span>receipt</span> from one of the <span>local</span> <span>stores</span>, you'll not be <span>charged</span> at all.<br/>
🎧 After six pm many of the car <span>parks</span> have a <span>flat</span> <span>rate</span> which <span>varies</span> but it is usually very <span>reasonable</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Sheepmarket</span> is one of the <span>main</span> <span>centres</span> for <span>art</span> and <span>history</span> in the whole of the <span>country</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you look at our map, you'll see some of the <span>main</span> <span>attractions</span> there.<br/>
🎧 Most <span>visitors</span> start from <span>Crawley</span> <span>Road</span>, at the <span>bottom</span> of the map.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Reynolds</span> House is one of the <span>oldest</span> <span>houses</span> in the <span>city</span>, and is open to the <span>public</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's on the <span>north</span> side of <span>Crawley</span> <span>Road</span>, next to the <span>footpath</span> that <span>leads</span> to the <span>public</span> <span>gardens</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>area's</span> <span>particularly</span> <span>interesting</span> for its <span>unusual</span> <span>sculptures</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Thumb</span> is just what its name <span>suggests</span>, but it's about <span>10</span> <span>metres</span> high.<br/>
🎧 You'll see it on <span>Hill</span> <span>Road</span>, across the <span>road</span> from the <span>Bank</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Museum's</span> got a <span>particularly</span> fine <span>collection</span> of New <span>Zealand</span> <span>landscapes</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's on the <span>east</span> side of the <span>Sheepmarket</span>, on <span>City</span> <span>Road</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's on the other side of the <span>road</span> from the <span>public</span> <span>gardens</span>, <span>immediately</span> <span>facing</span> the <span>junction</span> with <span>Hill</span> <span>Road</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Contemporary</span> <span>Art</span> <span>Gallery</span> is on a little <span>road</span> that <span>leads</span> off <span>Station</span> <span>Square</span>, not <span>far</span> from the <span>public</span> <span>gardens</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>road</span> <span>ends</span> at the <span>gallery</span> <span>-</span> it doesn't go <span>anywhere</span> else.<br/>
🎧 That's open every day <span>except</span> <span>Mondays</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Warner</span> <span>Gallery</span> <span>specialises</span> in <span>19th-century</span> <span>art</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's on <span>City</span> <span>Road</span>, near the <span>junction</span> with <span>Crawley</span> <span>Road</span>,<br/>
🎧 on the same side of the <span>road</span> as the <span>public</span> <span>gardens</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's open on <span>weekdays</span> from <span>9</span> to <span>5</span>, and <span>entry</span> is free.<br/>
🎧 Finally, if you're interested in <span>purchasing</span> high <span>quality</span> <span>artwork</span>,<br/>
🎧 the place to go is <span>Nucleus</span>.<br/>
🎧 You need to go from <span>Crawley</span> <span>Road</span> up through <span>Station</span> <span>Square</span> and <span>east</span> along <span>Hill</span> <span>Road<br/></span>
🎧 until you get to a small <span>winding</span> <span>road</span> <span>turning</span> off.<br/>
🎧 Go up there and it's on your right <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 if you get to <span>City</span> <span>Road</span> you've <span>gone</span> too <span>far</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 <span>Joe</span>, you know I'm <span>giving</span> a <span>presentation</span> in our <span>film</span> <span>studies</span> class next week?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Well, could we <span>discuss</span> it?<br/>
🎧 I could do with getting <span>someone</span> <span>else's</span> <span>opinion</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course, <span>Katie</span>. What are you going to talk about?<br/>
🎧 It's about <span>film</span> <span>adaptations</span> of <span>Shakespeare's</span> <span>plays</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've got very interested in all the different <span>approaches</span> that <span>film</span> <span>directors</span> take.<br/>
🎧 So I thought I'd start with <span>Giannetti</span>, who's a <span>professor</span> of <span>film</span> and <span>literature</span>,<br/>
🎧 and in one of his books he came up with a <span>straightforward</span> <span>classification</span> of <span>film</span> <span>adaptations<br/></span>
🎧 <span>based</span> on how <span>faithful</span> they are to the <span>original</span> <span>plays</span> and <span>novels</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I've already made some <span>notes</span> on that,<br/>
🎧 so I just need to <span>sort</span> those out before the <span>presentation</span>.<br/>
🎧 I thought that next I'd ask the class to come up with the <span>worst</span> <span>examples</span> of <span>Shakespeare</span> <span>adaptations</span> that <span>they've</span> <span>seen</span>,<br/>
🎧 and to say why.<br/>
🎧 That should be more fun than having their <span>favourite</span> <span>versions</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I can <span>certainly</span> think of a <span>couple</span>!<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Next I want to talk about <span>Rachel</span> <span>Malchow</span>.<br/>
🎧 I came across something on the <span>internet</span> about her work on <span>film</span> <span>adaptations</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I was thinking of <span>showing</span> some <span>film</span> <span>clips</span> to <span>illustrate</span> her <span>ideas</span>.<br/>
🎧 Will you have enough time, though?<br/>
🎧 Both to <span>prepare</span> and during the <span>presentation</span>?<br/>
🎧 After all, I <span>doubt</span> if you'll be able to find all the <span>clips</span> you want.<br/>
🎧 <span>Perhaps</span> you're right.<br/>
🎧 OK, well, I'd better do some <span>slides</span> <span>instead</span>,<br/>
🎧 saying how <span>various</span> <span>films</span> <span>relate</span> to what she says.<br/>
🎧 That should <span>encourage</span> <span>discussion</span>.<br/>
🎧 Next I want to say something about how <span>plays</span> may be <span>chosen</span> for <span>adaptation<br/></span>
🎧 because they're <span>concerned</span> with issues of the time when the <span>film</span> is made.<br/>
🎧 You mean things like <span>patriotism</span>, or the <span>role</span> of <span>governments</span>?<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 It's quite <span>tricky</span>, but I've got a few <span>ideas</span> I'd like to <span>discuss</span>.<br/>
🎧 And finally I want to talk about a few <span>adaptations</span> that I think <span>illustrate</span> a <span>range</span> of <span>approaches</span>,<br/>
🎧 and make some <span>comments</span> on them.<br/>
🎧 Do you know the <span>Japanese</span> <span>film</span> Ran?<br/>
🎧 I haven't <span>seen</span> it.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>based</span> on <span>Shakespeare's</span> <span>King</span> <span>Lear</span>, wasn't it?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 It was a very <span>loose</span> <span>adaptation</span>, <span>using</span> the same <span>situation</span> and <span>story</span>,<br/>
🎧 but <span>moving</span> it to <span>16th</span> <span>century</span> <span>Japan</span> <span>instead</span> of <span>16th</span> <span>century</span> <span>Britain</span>.<br/>
🎧 So for example the <span>king's</span> <span>daughters</span> become <span>sons</span>,<br/>
🎧 because in <span>Japanese</span> <span>culture</span> at that time, <span>women</span> couldn't <span>succeed</span> to the <span>throne</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 I hope you're going to talk about the <span>1993</span> <span>film</span> of Much <span>Ado</span> About <span>Nothing</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think that's one of the best <span>Shakespeare</span> <span>films</span>.<br/>
🎧 It really <span>brings</span> the play to life, doesn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I agree.<br/>
🎧 And I think <span>filming</span> it in <span>Italy</span>, where the play is set,<br/>
🎧 makes you see what life was like at the time of the play.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely. Right, what's next?<br/>
🎧 <span>Er</span>, next, I thought <span>Romeo</span> <span>&</span> <span>Juliet</span>, the <span>1996</span> <span>film</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>moves</span> the <span>action</span> into the <span>present</span> day.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it <span>worked</span> really well, I thought <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>changing</span> the two <span>feuding</span> <span>families</span> in the <span>original</span> to two <span>competing</span> <span>business</span> <span>empires</span>,<br/>
🎧 even though they're <span>speaking</span> in the English of the <span>original</span> play.<br/>
🎧 You'd <span>expect</span> it would sound really <span>bizarre</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I <span>found</span> I soon got used to it.<br/>
🎧 Me too.<br/>
🎧 Then I thought I'd <span>include</span> a <span>real</span> <span>Hollywood</span> <span>film</span>,<br/>
🎧 one that's <span>intended</span> to <span>appeal</span> to a <span>mass</span> <span>commercial</span> <span>audience</span>.<br/>
🎧 There must be quite a number of those.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but I've <span>picked</span> the <span>1996</span> <span>film</span> of <span>Hamlet</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>included</span> every <span>line</span> of the <span>text</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it's more like a <span>typical</span> <span>action</span> <span>hero</span> movie <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 there are <span>loads</span> of special <span>effects</span>, but no <span>unifying</span> <span>interpretation</span> of the play.<br/>
🎧 All show and no <span>substance</span>.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 Then there's <span>Prospero's</span> Books, <span>based</span> on The <span>Tempest</span>.<br/>
🎧 That was really <span>innovative</span>, from a <span>stylistic</span> <span>point</span> of <span>view</span>.<br/>
🎧 Didn't it <span>include</span> <span>dance</span> and <span>singing</span> and <span>animation</span>, as well as live <span>actors</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it did.<br/>
🎧 I also want to <span>mention</span> Looking for <span>Richard</span>.<br/>
🎧 Did you ever see it?<br/>
🎧 No, but I've read about it.<br/>
🎧 It was a <span>blend</span> of a <span>documentary</span> with a few <span>scenes</span> from <span>Richard</span> <span>III</span>, wasn't it?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 It's more a way of looking into how people <span>nowadays</span> <span>connect</span> with the <span>playwright</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 the play is really just the <span>starting</span> <span>point</span>.<br/>
🎧 And <span>that'll</span> be where I <span>finish</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, it sounds as though it'll be very <span>interesting</span>.<br/>

🎧 This <span>lecture</span> will be about the <span>science</span> of <span>acoustics</span>, the <span>study</span> of sound,<br/>
🎧 in <span>relation</span> to <span>urban</span> <span>environments</span> such as <span>cities</span>.<br/>
🎧 As an <span>acoustic</span> <span>engineer</span> myself,<br/>
🎧 I think this is an <span>area</span> where we're <span>likely</span> to see great changes.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>past</span>, <span>researching</span> <span>urban</span> <span>soundscapes</span> was simple.<br/>
🎧 We <span>measured</span> <span>levels</span> of sound in <span>decibels</span>,<br/>
🎧 so I used to take my sound <span>meter</span> and I <span>measured</span> the <span>noise</span> somewhere,<br/>
🎧 and then I might ask a <span>sample</span> of people to say at what <span>level</span> the sound <span>became</span> <span>annoying</span>.<br/>
🎧 With <span>data</span> like this, <span>acoustic</span> <span>engineers</span> have been able to <span>build</span> up what we call <span>noise</span> <span>maps</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>maps</span> of the sound <span>environment</span>.<br/>
🎧 But actually these aren't a lot of use.<br/>
🎧 What they do show is that the <span>highest</span> <span>noise</span> <span>levels</span> are <span>generally</span> on <span>roads</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's not really very <span>surprising</span>.<br/>
🎧 But there's quite a lot going on that these <span>maps</span> don't show,<br/>
🎧 because they can't <span>capture</span> the <span>complex</span> way that sound <span>varies</span> over time.<br/>
🎧 So they <span>ignore</span> important issues such as the <span>noise</span> <span>someone</span> might hear from the open <span>windows<br/></span>
🎧 or <span>gardens</span> of their <span>neighbours</span>,<br/>
🎧 and this <span>sort</span> of <span>noise</span> can be quite <span>significant</span> in <span>summer</span>.<br/>
🎧 We don't have any <span>databases</span> on this <span>sort</span> of <span>information</span>.<br/>
🎧 As well as that, these <span>records</span> of sound <span>levels</span> take no <span>account</span> of the <span>fact</span> that people <span>vary</span> in their <span>perceptions</span> of <span>noise</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 so <span>someone</span> like me with years of working in <span>acoustics</span> might be very different from you in that <span>regard</span>.<br/>
🎧 But <span>anyway</span>, even though these <span>noise</span> <span>maps</span> are <span>fairly</span> <span>crude</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>they've</span> been useful in <span>providing</span> <span>information<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>raising</span> <span>awareness</span> that <span>noise</span> <span>matters</span>,<br/>
🎧 we need to <span>deal</span> with it and so it's a <span>political</span> <span>matter</span>.<br/>
🎧 And that's important <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 we need <span>rules</span> and <span>regulations</span> because <span>noise</span> can <span>cause</span> all <span>sorts</span> of <span>problems</span>.<br/>
🎧 Those of you who are <span>city-dwellers</span> know that things go on <span>24</span> hours a day,<br/>
🎧 so <span>city-dwellers</span> often <span>suffer</span> from <span>interrupted</span> <span>sleep</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's also <span>known</span> that <span>noise</span> can <span>lead</span> to a <span>rise</span> in <span>levels</span> of <span>stress</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>due</span> to <span>physical</span> changes in the <span>body</span> <span>affecting</span> the <span>composition</span> of the <span>blood</span>.<br/>
🎧 And there are other <span>problems</span> as well,<br/>
🎧 for <span>instance</span> if <span>schoolchildren</span> don't have a <span>quiet</span> place to <span>study</span>, their work will <span>suffer</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, one <span>problem</span> with <span>decibel</span> <span>measurement</span> is that it doesn't <span>differentiate</span> between different <span>types</span> of <span>noise</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>types</span> of sounds that most people would probably think of as nice and <span>relaxing<br/></span>
🎧 might well <span>score</span> quite <span>highly</span> in <span>decibel</span> <span>levels</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 think of the sound made by a <span>fountain</span> in a <span>town</span> <span>square</span>, for example.<br/>
🎧 That's not <span>necessarily</span> something that we'd want to <span>control</span> or <span>reduce</span>.<br/>
🎧 So maybe <span>researchers</span> should <span>consider</span> these <span>sorts</span> of sounds in <span>urban</span> <span>design</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is going to be <span>tricky<br/></span>
🎧 because just <span>measuring</span> <span>decibel</span> <span>levels</span> isn't going to help us here.<br/>
🎧 <span>Instead</span>, many <span>researchers</span> are <span>using</span> <span>social</span> <span>science</span> <span>techniques</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>studying</span> <span>people's</span> <span>emotional</span> <span>response</span> to sound by <span>using</span> <span>questionnaires</span> and so on.<br/>
🎧 So what exactly do people want to hear in an <span>urban</span> <span>environment</span>?<br/>
🎧 Some <span>recent</span> <span>interdisciplinary</span> <span>research</span> has come out with <span>results</span> that at first <span>sight</span> <span>seem</span> <span>contradictory</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 a <span>city</span> needs to have a <span>sense</span> of <span>activity</span>, so it needs to be <span>lively</span>,<br/>
🎧 with sounds like the <span>clack</span> of high <span>heels</span> on a <span>pavement</span> or the <span>hiss</span> of a <span>coffee</span> <span>machine</span>,<br/>
🎧 but these mustn't be too <span>intrusive</span>,<br/>
🎧 because at the same time we need to be able to <span>relax</span>.<br/>
🎧 One of the <span>major</span> <span>problems</span> in <span>achieving</span> this will be getting <span>architects</span> and <span>town</span> <span>planners</span> to use the <span>research</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Apart</span> from <span>studying</span> the <span>basics</span> of <span>acoustics</span>,<br/>
🎧 these people <span>receive</span> very little <span>training</span> in this <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 But in <span>fact</span> they should be <span>regarding</span> sound as an <span>opportunity</span> to add to the <span>experience</span> of <span>urban</span> living,<br/>
🎧 <span>whereas</span> at <span>present</span>, they <span>tend</span> to see it as something to be <span>avoided</span> or <span>reduced</span> as <span>far</span> as <span>possible</span>,<br/>
🎧 or something that's just a <span>job</span> for <span>engineers</span> like the <span>street</span> <span>drainage</span> <span>system</span>.<br/>
🎧 What's <span>needed</span> is for <span>noise</span> in <span>cities</span> to be <span>regarded</span> as an <span>aesthetic</span> <span>quality</span>,<br/>
🎧 as something that has the <span>qualities</span> of an <span>art</span> <span>form</span>.<br/>
🎧 If we <span>acknowledge</span> this, then we <span>urgently</span> need to know what <span>governs</span> it and how <span>designers</span> can work with it.<br/>
🎧 We need to <span>develop</span> a <span>complex</span> <span>understanding</span> of many <span>factors</span>.<br/>
🎧 What is the <span>relationship</span> between sound and <span>culture</span>?<br/>
🎧 What can we learn from <span>disciplines</span> such as <span>psychology</span> about the way that sound <span>interacts</span> with <span>human</span> <span>development</span> and <span>social</span> <span>relationships</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the way that sound <span>affects</span> our <span>thoughts</span> and <span>feelings</span>?<br/>
🎧 Can we learn anything from <span>physics</span> about the <span>nature</span> of sound <span>itself</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Today's</span> <span>powerful</span> <span>technologies</span> can also help us.<br/>
🎧 To show us their <span>ideas</span> and help us to <span>imagine</span> the <span>effect</span> their <span>buildings</span> will have,<br/>
🎧 <span>architects</span> and <span>town</span> <span>planners</span> already use <span>virtual</span> <span>reality</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 but these <span>programs</span> are <span>silent</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the future such <span>programs</span> could use <span>realistic</span> sounds,<br/>
🎧 <span>meaning</span> that <span>soundscapes</span> could be <span>explored</span> before being <span>built</span>.<br/>
🎧 So <span>hopefully</span>, <span>using</span> the best <span>technology</span> we can lay our <span>hands</span> on,<br/>
🎧 the <span>city</span> of the future will be a <span>pleasure</span> to the <span>ears</span> as well as the <span>eyes</span>.<br/>
