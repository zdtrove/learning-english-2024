🎧 Hello, <span>Pembroke <span>Cycling <span>Holidays, <span>Bob <span>speaking.<br/>
🎧 Oh hello.<br/>
🎧 I've <span>seen your <span>advert for people to <span>lead <span>cycle <span>trips.<br/>
🎧 Are you the right person to speak to?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I am.<br/>
🎧 Could I have your name, please?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>Margaret <span>Smith.<br/>
🎧 Are you looking for a <span>permanent <span>job, <span>Margaret?<br/>
🎧 No, <span>temporary.<br/>
🎧 I've got a <span>permanent <span>job <span>starting in a few <span>months' time,<br/>
🎧 and I want to do something else until then.<br/>
🎧 What work do you do?<br/>
🎧 This will probably sound <span>crazy <span>- I used to be a <span>lawyer,<br/>
🎧 and then I made a <span>complete <span>career change and I'm going to be a <span>doctor.<br/>
🎧 I've just <span>finished my <span>training.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And have you had any <span>experience of <span>leading <span>cycle <span>trips?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I've <span>led <span>several <span>bike <span>tours in <span>Africa.<br/>
🎧 The <span>trip to <span>India that I had <span>arranged to <span>lead next month has now been <span>cancelled,<br/>
🎧 so when I saw you were <span>advertising for <span>tour <span>leaders, I <span>decided to <span>apply.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Now we <span>normally have two or <span>three <span>leaders on a <span>trip, <span>depending on the size of the group.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>tours are for very <span>experienced <span>cyclists,<br/>
🎧 but we've got a <span>tour <span>coming up soon in <span>Spain,<br/>
🎧 which is <span>proving so <span>popular we need an <span>additional <span>leader.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>cycling <span>holiday for <span>families. Would that <span>suit you?<br/>
🎧 It <span>certainly would.<br/>
🎧 I enjoy working with children,<br/>
🎧 and I probably need some more <span>experience before I go on a really <span>challenging <span>trip.<br/>
🎧 That <span>tour <span>includes <span>several <span>teenagers;<br/>
🎧 have you <span>worked with that age group before?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I'm a <span>volunteer <span>worker in a <span>youth <span>club,<br/>
🎧 where I help people to <span>improve their <span>cycling <span>skills.<br/>
🎧 Before that I <span>helped out in a <span>cycling <span>club where I <span>taught <span>beginners.<br/>
🎧 Well that's great.<br/>
🎧 Now the <span>trip I <span>mentioned is just for a <span>fortnight,<br/>
🎧 but there might be the <span>possibility of <span>leading other <span>tours after that.<br/>
🎧 Would that fit in with your <span>plans?<br/>
🎧 That'd be fine.<br/>
🎧 I'll be free for <span>five <span>months.<br/>
🎧 My <span>job is <span>due to start on <span>October the <span>2nd,<br/>
🎧 and I'm <span>available from May the <span>1st until <span>late <span>September.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 Now is there anything I need to know about the food you eat?<br/>
🎧 We usually have one or two people in the group who don't eat <span>meat,<br/>
🎧 or have some <span>sort of food <span>allergy,<br/>
🎧 so we're always very <span>careful about that.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I'm <span>allergic to <span>cheese.<br/>
🎧 Would that be a <span>problem?<br/>
🎧 No, as long as we have enough <span>notice, we can <span>deal with that.<br/>
🎧 That's great.<br/>
🎧 It sounds really <span>interesting!<br/>
🎧 Would you like me to <span>fill in an <span>application <span>form?<br/>
🎧 Yes, please.<br/>
🎧 Where should I <span>post it to?<br/>
🎧 Could you <span>send it to <span>27 <span>Arbuthnot Place,<br/>
🎧 <span>A-R-B-U-T-H-N-O-T <span>- Place, <span>Dumfries.<br/>
🎧 And what's the <span>postcode, please?<br/>
🎧 <span>DG7 <span>4PH.<br/>
🎧 Was that <span>P <span>Papa or <span>B <span>Bravo?<br/>
🎧 <span>P <span>Papa.<br/>
🎧 Got that.<br/>
🎧 If you could <span>return the <span>application <span>form by <span>Friday this week, we can <span>interview you on <span>Tuesday next week.<br/>
🎧 Say <span>half <span>past two.<br/>
🎧 Would that be <span>possible for you?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's fine.<br/>
🎧 You're quite a long way from where I live, so I'll drive over on <span>Monday.<br/>
🎧 Should I <span>bring anything to the <span>interview?<br/>
🎧 We'll have your <span>application <span>form, of course,<br/>
🎧 but we'll need to see any <span>certificates you've got that are <span>relevant, in <span>cycling, first <span>aid, or whatever.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And at the <span>interview we'd like to find out about your <span>experience of being a <span>tour <span>guide,<br/>
🎧 so could you <span>prepare a <span>10 <span>minute talk about that, please?<br/>
🎧 You don't need <span>slides or any <span>complicated <span>equipment <span>- just some <span>notes.<br/>
🎧 Right. I'll start thinking about that <span>straightaway!<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 Well, we'll look forward to <span>receiving your <span>application <span>form, and we'll <span>contact you to <span>confirm the <span>interview.<br/>
🎧 Thanks very much.<br/>
🎧 Thank you, <span>Margaret. <span>Goodbye.<br/>
🎧 Bye.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 <span>Welcome to this <span>podcast about the <span>Sheepmarket, which is one of the <span>oldest <span>parts of the <span>city.<br/>
🎧 As its name <span>suggests, there was <span>originally a <span>market here where <span>farmers <span>brought their <span>sheep,<br/>
🎧 but now it's been <span>redeveloped into a <span>buzzing, <span>vibrant <span>area of the <span>city,<br/>
🎧 which is also home to one of the <span>city's <span>fastest-growing <span>communities.<br/>
🎧 The <span>nearby university has always <span>meant the <span>area's <span>popular with students, who come in to enjoy the <span>lively <span>nightlife,<br/>
🎧 but now <span>graduates <span>embarking on <span>careers in the <span>worlds of <span>fashion and <span>design<br/>
🎧 are <span>buying up the new <span>apartments <span>recently <span>built <span>here<br/>
🎧 to <span>replace the small <span>houses where the <span>market <span>workers used to live.<br/>
🎧 The <span>narrow old side <span>streets are great <span>places for <span>finding <span>original <span>pictures, <span>jewellery and <span>ceramics which won't <span>break the <span>bank,<br/>
🎧 as well as <span>local <span>produce like <span>fruit and <span>vegetables.<br/>
🎧 There's also lots of <span>pavement <span>cafes where you can have a <span>coffee and <span>watch <span>tourists from all over the <span>world go by.<br/>
🎧 The <span>oldest <span>buildings in the <span>area are on the <span>main <span>streets,<br/>
🎧 <span>including the <span>city's first <span>department <span>store, <span>built in the <span>1880s, which is still open today.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Sheepmarket is a <span>centre for <span>fashion,<br/>
🎧 and there's a <span>policy of <span>encouraging new young <span>designers.<br/>
🎧 The Young <span>Fashion <span>competition is open to <span>local young people who are <span>passionate about <span>fashion.<br/>
🎧 This year <span>they've been <span>asked to <span>design an <span>outfit <span>based on <span>ideas from the music and <span>technology that's <span>part of their everyday life,<br/>
🎧 <span>using both <span>natural and <span>man-made <span>fibres.<br/>
🎧 The <span>garments will be <span>judged by a <span>panel of <span>experts and <span>fashion <span>designers,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>winning <span>entries will be <span>modelled at a special <span>gala <span>evening.<br/>
🎧 <span>Parking at the <span>Sheepmarket is easy.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>plenty of pay and <span>display car <span>parking <span>spaces on the <span>roadsides<br/>
🎧 which are fine if you just want to <span>stay for an <span>hour or two,<br/>
🎧 but if you want to <span>spend the day there, it's better to <span>park in one of the <span>four <span>underground car <span>parks.<br/>
🎧 It's not <span>expensive and if you can <span>present a <span>receipt from one of the <span>local <span>stores, you'll not be <span>charged at all.<br/>
🎧 After six pm many of the car <span>parks have a <span>flat <span>rate which <span>varies but it is usually very <span>reasonable.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Sheepmarket is one of the <span>main <span>centres for <span>art and <span>history in the whole of the <span>country.<br/>
🎧 If you look at our map, you'll see some of the <span>main <span>attractions there.<br/>
🎧 Most <span>visitors start from <span>Crawley <span>Road, at the <span>bottom of the map.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Reynolds House is one of the <span>oldest <span>houses in the <span>city, and is open to the <span>public.<br/>
🎧 It's on the <span>north side of <span>Crawley <span>Road, next to the <span>footpath that <span>leads to the <span>public <span>gardens.<br/>
🎧 The <span>area's <span>particularly <span>interesting for its <span>unusual <span>sculptures.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Thumb is just what its name <span>suggests, but it's about <span>10 <span>metres high.<br/>
🎧 You'll see it on <span>Hill <span>Road, across the <span>road from the <span>Bank.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Museum's got a <span>particularly fine <span>collection of New <span>Zealand <span>landscapes.<br/>
🎧 It's on the <span>east side of the <span>Sheepmarket, on <span>City <span>Road.<br/>
🎧 It's on the other side of the <span>road from the <span>public <span>gardens, <span>immediately <span>facing the <span>junction with <span>Hill <span>Road.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Contemporary <span>Art <span>Gallery is on a little <span>road that <span>leads off <span>Station <span>Square, not <span>far from the <span>public <span>gardens.<br/>
🎧 The <span>road <span>ends at the <span>gallery <span>- it doesn't go <span>anywhere else.<br/>
🎧 That's open every day <span>except <span>Mondays.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Warner <span>Gallery <span>specialises in <span>19th-century <span>art.<br/>
🎧 It's on <span>City <span>Road, near the <span>junction with <span>Crawley <span>Road,<br/>
🎧 on the same side of the <span>road as the <span>public <span>gardens.<br/>
🎧 It's open on <span>weekdays from <span>9 to <span>5, and <span>entry is free.<br/>
🎧 Finally, if you're interested in <span>purchasing high <span>quality <span>artwork,<br/>
🎧 the place to go is <span>Nucleus.<br/>
🎧 You need to go from <span>Crawley <span>Road up through <span>Station <span>Square and <span>east along <span>Hill <span>Road<br/>
🎧 until you get to a small <span>winding <span>road <span>turning off.<br/>
🎧 Go up there and it's on your right <span>-<br/>
🎧 if you get to <span>City <span>Road you've <span>gone too <span>far.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 <span>Joe, you know I'm <span>giving a <span>presentation in our <span>film <span>studies class next week?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Well, could we <span>discuss it?<br/>
🎧 I could do with getting <span>someone <span>else's <span>opinion.<br/>
🎧 Of course, <span>Katie. What are you going to talk about?<br/>
🎧 It's about <span>film <span>adaptations of <span>Shakespeare's <span>plays.<br/>
🎧 I've got very interested in all the different <span>approaches that <span>film <span>directors take.<br/>
🎧 So I thought I'd start with <span>Giannetti, who's a <span>professor of <span>film and <span>literature,<br/>
🎧 and in one of his books he came up with a <span>straightforward <span>classification of <span>film <span>adaptations<br/>
🎧 <span>based on how <span>faithful they are to the <span>original <span>plays and <span>novels.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I've already made some <span>notes on that,<br/>
🎧 so I just need to <span>sort those out before the <span>presentation.<br/>
🎧 I thought that next I'd ask the class to come up with the <span>worst <span>examples of <span>Shakespeare <span>adaptations that <span>they've <span>seen,<br/>
🎧 and to say why.<br/>
🎧 That should be more fun than having their <span>favourite <span>versions.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I can <span>certainly think of a <span>couple!<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Next I want to talk about <span>Rachel <span>Malchow.<br/>
🎧 I came across something on the <span>internet about her work on <span>film <span>adaptations,<br/>
🎧 and I was thinking of <span>showing some <span>film <span>clips to <span>illustrate her <span>ideas.<br/>
🎧 Will you have enough time, though?<br/>
🎧 Both to <span>prepare and during the <span>presentation?<br/>
🎧 After all, I <span>doubt if you'll be able to find all the <span>clips you want.<br/>
🎧 <span>Perhaps you're right.<br/>
🎧 OK, well, I'd better do some <span>slides <span>instead,<br/>
🎧 saying how <span>various <span>films <span>relate to what she says.<br/>
🎧 That should <span>encourage <span>discussion.<br/>
🎧 Next I want to say something about how <span>plays may be <span>chosen for <span>adaptation<br/>
🎧 because they're <span>concerned with issues of the time when the <span>film is made.<br/>
🎧 You mean things like <span>patriotism, or the <span>role of <span>governments?<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 It's quite <span>tricky, but I've got a few <span>ideas I'd like to <span>discuss.<br/>
🎧 And finally I want to talk about a few <span>adaptations that I think <span>illustrate a <span>range of <span>approaches,<br/>
🎧 and make some <span>comments on them.<br/>
🎧 Do you know the <span>Japanese <span>film Ran?<br/>
🎧 I haven't <span>seen it.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>based on <span>Shakespeare's <span>King <span>Lear, wasn't it?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 It was a very <span>loose <span>adaptation, <span>using the same <span>situation and <span>story,<br/>
🎧 but <span>moving it to <span>16th <span>century <span>Japan <span>instead of <span>16th <span>century <span>Britain.<br/>
🎧 So for example the <span>king's <span>daughters become <span>sons,<br/>
🎧 because in <span>Japanese <span>culture at that time, <span>women couldn't <span>succeed to the <span>throne.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 I hope you're going to talk about the <span>1993 <span>film of Much <span>Ado About <span>Nothing.<br/>
🎧 I think that's one of the best <span>Shakespeare <span>films.<br/>
🎧 It really <span>brings the play to life, doesn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I agree.<br/>
🎧 And I think <span>filming it in <span>Italy, where the play is set,<br/>
🎧 makes you see what life was like at the time of the play.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely. Right, what's next?<br/>
🎧 <span>Er, next, I thought <span>Romeo <span>& <span>Juliet, the <span>1996 <span>film,<br/>
🎧 which <span>moves the <span>action into the <span>present day.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it <span>worked really well, I thought <span>-<br/>
🎧 <span>changing the two <span>feuding <span>families in the <span>original to two <span>competing <span>business <span>empires,<br/>
🎧 even though they're <span>speaking in the English of the <span>original play.<br/>
🎧 You'd <span>expect it would sound really <span>bizarre,<br/>
🎧 but I <span>found I soon got used to it.<br/>
🎧 Me too.<br/>
🎧 Then I thought I'd <span>include a <span>real <span>Hollywood <span>film,<br/>
🎧 one that's <span>intended to <span>appeal to a <span>mass <span>commercial <span>audience.<br/>
🎧 There must be quite a number of those.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but I've <span>picked the <span>1996 <span>film of <span>Hamlet.<br/>
🎧 It <span>included every <span>line of the <span>text,<br/>
🎧 but it's more like a <span>typical <span>action <span>hero movie <span>-<br/>
🎧 there are <span>loads of special <span>effects, but no <span>unifying <span>interpretation of the play.<br/>
🎧 All show and no <span>substance.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 Then there's <span>Prospero's Books, <span>based on The <span>Tempest.<br/>
🎧 That was really <span>innovative, from a <span>stylistic <span>point of <span>view.<br/>
🎧 Didn't it <span>include <span>dance and <span>singing and <span>animation, as well as live <span>actors?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it did.<br/>
🎧 I also want to <span>mention Looking for <span>Richard.<br/>
🎧 Did you ever see it?<br/>
🎧 No, but I've read about it.<br/>
🎧 It was a <span>blend of a <span>documentary with a few <span>scenes from <span>Richard <span>III, wasn't it?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 It's more a way of looking into how people <span>nowadays <span>connect with the <span>playwright <span>-<br/>
🎧 the play is really just the <span>starting <span>point.<br/>
🎧 And <span>that'll be where I <span>finish.<br/>
🎧 Well, it sounds as though it'll be very <span>interesting.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 This <span>lecture will be about the <span>science of <span>acoustics, the <span>study of sound,<br/>
🎧 in <span>relation to <span>urban <span>environments such as <span>cities.<br/>
🎧 As an <span>acoustic <span>engineer myself,<br/>
🎧 I think this is an <span>area where we're <span>likely to see great changes.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>past, <span>researching <span>urban <span>soundscapes was simple.<br/>
🎧 We <span>measured <span>levels of sound in <span>decibels,<br/>
🎧 so I used to take my sound <span>meter and I <span>measured the <span>noise somewhere,<br/>
🎧 and then I might ask a <span>sample of people to say at what <span>level the sound <span>became <span>annoying.<br/>
🎧 With <span>data like this, <span>acoustic <span>engineers have been able to <span>build up what we call <span>noise <span>maps,<br/>
🎧 <span>maps of the sound <span>environment.<br/>
🎧 But actually these aren't a lot of use.<br/>
🎧 What they do show is that the <span>highest <span>noise <span>levels are <span>generally on <span>roads.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's not really very <span>surprising.<br/>
🎧 But there's quite a lot going on that these <span>maps don't show,<br/>
🎧 because they can't <span>capture the <span>complex way that sound <span>varies over time.<br/>
🎧 So they <span>ignore important issues such as the <span>noise <span>someone might hear from the open <span>windows<br/>
🎧 or <span>gardens of their <span>neighbours,<br/>
🎧 and this <span>sort of <span>noise can be quite <span>significant in <span>summer.<br/>
🎧 We don't have any <span>databases on this <span>sort of <span>information.<br/>
🎧 As well as that, these <span>records of sound <span>levels take no <span>account of the <span>fact that people <span>vary in their <span>perceptions of <span>noise <span>-<br/>
🎧 so <span>someone like me with years of working in <span>acoustics might be very different from you in that <span>regard.<br/>
🎧 But <span>anyway, even though these <span>noise <span>maps are <span>fairly <span>crude,<br/>
🎧 <span>they've been useful in <span>providing <span>information<br/>
🎧 and <span>raising <span>awareness that <span>noise <span>matters,<br/>
🎧 we need to <span>deal with it and so it's a <span>political <span>matter.<br/>
🎧 And that's important <span>-<br/>
🎧 we need <span>rules and <span>regulations because <span>noise can <span>cause all <span>sorts of <span>problems.<br/>
🎧 Those of you who are <span>city-dwellers know that things go on <span>24 hours a day,<br/>
🎧 so <span>city-dwellers often <span>suffer from <span>interrupted <span>sleep.<br/>
🎧 It's also <span>known that <span>noise can <span>lead to a <span>rise in <span>levels of <span>stress,<br/>
🎧 <span>due to <span>physical changes in the <span>body <span>affecting the <span>composition of the <span>blood.<br/>
🎧 And there are other <span>problems as well,<br/>
🎧 for <span>instance if <span>schoolchildren don't have a <span>quiet place to <span>study, their work will <span>suffer.<br/>
🎧 Now, one <span>problem with <span>decibel <span>measurement is that it doesn't <span>differentiate between different <span>types of <span>noise.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>types of sounds that most people would probably think of as nice and <span>relaxing<br/>
🎧 might well <span>score quite <span>highly in <span>decibel <span>levels <span>-<br/>
🎧 think of the sound made by a <span>fountain in a <span>town <span>square, for example.<br/>
🎧 That's not <span>necessarily something that we'd want to <span>control or <span>reduce.<br/>
🎧 So maybe <span>researchers should <span>consider these <span>sorts of sounds in <span>urban <span>design.<br/>
🎧 This is going to be <span>tricky<br/>
🎧 because just <span>measuring <span>decibel <span>levels isn't going to help us here.<br/>
🎧 <span>Instead, many <span>researchers are <span>using <span>social <span>science <span>techniques,<br/>
🎧 <span>studying <span>people's <span>emotional <span>response to sound by <span>using <span>questionnaires and so on.<br/>
🎧 So what exactly do people want to hear in an <span>urban <span>environment?<br/>
🎧 Some <span>recent <span>interdisciplinary <span>research has come out with <span>results that at first <span>sight <span>seem <span>contradictory <span>-<br/>
🎧 a <span>city needs to have a <span>sense of <span>activity, so it needs to be <span>lively,<br/>
🎧 with sounds like the <span>clack of high <span>heels on a <span>pavement or the <span>hiss of a <span>coffee <span>machine,<br/>
🎧 but these mustn't be too <span>intrusive,<br/>
🎧 because at the same time we need to be able to <span>relax.<br/>
🎧 One of the <span>major <span>problems in <span>achieving this will be getting <span>architects and <span>town <span>planners to use the <span>research.<br/>
🎧 <span>Apart from <span>studying the <span>basics of <span>acoustics,<br/>
🎧 these people <span>receive very little <span>training in this <span>area.<br/>
🎧 But in <span>fact they should be <span>regarding sound as an <span>opportunity to add to the <span>experience of <span>urban living,<br/>
🎧 <span>whereas at <span>present, they <span>tend to see it as something to be <span>avoided or <span>reduced as <span>far as <span>possible,<br/>
🎧 or something that's just a <span>job for <span>engineers like the <span>street <span>drainage <span>system.<br/>
🎧 What's <span>needed is for <span>noise in <span>cities to be <span>regarded as an <span>aesthetic <span>quality,<br/>
🎧 as something that has the <span>qualities of an <span>art <span>form.<br/>
🎧 If we <span>acknowledge this, then we <span>urgently need to know what <span>governs it and how <span>designers can work with it.<br/>
🎧 We need to <span>develop a <span>complex <span>understanding of many <span>factors.<br/>
🎧 What is the <span>relationship between sound and <span>culture?<br/>
🎧 What can we learn from <span>disciplines such as <span>psychology about the way that sound <span>interacts with <span>human <span>development and <span>social <span>relationships,<br/>
🎧 and the way that sound <span>affects our <span>thoughts and <span>feelings?<br/>
🎧 Can we learn anything from <span>physics about the <span>nature of sound <span>itself?<br/>
🎧 <span>Today's <span>powerful <span>technologies can also help us.<br/>
🎧 To show us their <span>ideas and help us to <span>imagine the <span>effect their <span>buildings will have,<br/>
🎧 <span>architects and <span>town <span>planners already use <span>virtual <span>reality <span>-<br/>
🎧 but these <span>programs are <span>silent.<br/>
🎧 In the future such <span>programs could use <span>realistic sounds,<br/>
🎧 <span>meaning that <span>soundscapes could be <span>explored before being <span>built.<br/>
🎧 So <span>hopefully, <span>using the best <span>technology we can lay our <span>hands on,<br/>
🎧 the <span>city of the future will be a <span>pleasure to the <span>ears as well as the <span>eyes.<br/>
