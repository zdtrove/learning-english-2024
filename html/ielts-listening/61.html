🎧 Excuse</span> me.<br/>
🎧 Would you mind</span> if I asked</span> you some questions</span>?<br/>
🎧 We're doing a survey</span> on transport</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's OK.<br/>
🎧 First of all, can I take your name?<br/>
🎧 Yes. It's Sadie</span> Jones</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks very much.<br/>
🎧 And could I have your date of birth</span> -</span> just the year will do, actually.<br/>
🎧 Is that alright?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's fine.<br/>
🎧 It's 1991</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, next, your postcode</span>, please.<br/>
🎧 It's DW307YZ</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great. Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Is that in Wells</span>?<br/>
🎧 No it's actually in Harborne</span>.<br/>
🎧 Wells</span> isn't far</span> from there, though.<br/>
🎧 I really like that area</span>.<br/>
🎧 My grandmother</span> lived</span> there when I was a kid</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it is nice.<br/>
🎧 Right, so now I want to ask you some questions</span> about how you travelled</span> here today.<br/>
🎧 Did you use public</span> transport</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes. I came by bus.<br/>
🎧 OK. And that was today.<br/>
🎧 It's the 24th</span> of April</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Isn't it the 25th</span>?<br/>
🎧 Ah..</span>. no, actually, you're right.<br/>
🎧 And what was the reason</span> for your trip</span> today?<br/>
🎧 I can see you've got some shopping</span> with you.<br/>
🎧 Yes. I did some shopping<br/></span>
🎧 but the main</span> reason</span> I came here was to go to the dentist</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's not much fun.<br/>
🎧 Hope it was nothing</span> serious.<br/>
🎧 No, it was just a check-up</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's fine.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 Do you normally</span> travel by bus into the city</span> centre</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes. I stopped</span> driving in ages</span> ago<br/></span>
🎧 because parking</span> was so difficult</span> to find<br/></span>
🎧 and it costs</span> so much.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 The bus is much more convenient</span> too.<br/>
🎧 It only takes about 30</span> minutes</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's good.<br/>
🎧 So where did you start your journey</span>?<br/>
🎧 At the bus stop</span> on Claxby</span> Street</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is that C-L-A-X-B-Y</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 And how satisfied</span> with the service</span> are you?<br/>
🎧 Do you have any complaints</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, as I said, it's very convenient</span> and quick</span> when it's on time,<br/>
🎧 but this morning it was late</span>.<br/>
🎧 Only about 10</span> minutes</span>, but still.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I understand</span> that's annoying</span>.<br/>
🎧 And what about the timetable</span>?<br/>
🎧 Do you have any comments</span> about that?<br/>
🎧 I suppose</span> I mainly</span> use the bus during the day,<br/>
🎧 but any time I've been in town</span> in the evening</span>, for dinner or at the cinema</span>,<br/>
🎧 I've noticed</span> you have to wait a long time for a bus.<br/>
🎧 There aren't that many.<br/>
🎧 OK, thanks.<br/>
🎧 So now I'd like to ask you about your car use.<br/>
🎧 Well, I have got a car but I don't use it that often.<br/>
🎧 Mainly</span> just to go to the supermarket</span>.<br/>
🎧 But that's about it really.<br/>
🎧 My husband</span> uses</span> it at the weekends</span> to go to the golf</span> club</span>.<br/>
🎧 And what about a bicycle</span>?<br/>
🎧 I don't actually have one at the moment</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about the city</span> bikes</span> you can rent</span>?<br/>
🎧 Do you ever use those?<br/>
🎧 No, I'm not keen</span> on cycling</span> there because of all the pollution</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I would like to get a bike</span>, it would be good to use it to get to work.<br/>
🎧 So why haven't you got one now?<br/>
🎧 Well, I live in a flat</span>, on the second floor<br/></span>
🎧 and it doesn't have any storage</span>,<br/>
🎧 so we'd have to leave it in the hall</span> outside the flat</span>.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 OK. Well, I think that's all..</span>.<br/>

🎧 Good evening</span>, everyone.<br/>
🎧 Let me start by welcoming</span> you all to this talk and thanking</span> you for taking the time to consider</span> joining</span> ACE</span> voluntary</span> organisation</span>.<br/>
🎧 ACE</span> offers</span> support</span> to people and services</span> in the local</span> area<br/></span>
🎧 and we're now looking for more volunteers</span> to help us do this.<br/>
🎧 By the way, I hope you're all comfortable</span>,<br/>
🎧 we have brought</span> in extra</span> seats</span> so that no one has to stand</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it does mean that the people at the back of the room may be a bit squashed</span>.<br/>
🎧 We'll only be here for about half</span> an hour</span> so, hopefully</span>, that's OK.<br/>
🎧 One of the first questions</span> we're often asked</span> is how old you need to be to volunteer</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, you can be as young as 16</span> or you can be 60</span> or over:<br/>
🎧 it all depends</span> on what type</span> of voluntary</span> work you want to do.<br/>
🎧 Other considerations</span>, such as reliability</span>, are crucial</span> in voluntary</span> work<br/></span>
🎧 and age isn't related</span> to these, in our experience</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another question</span> we get asked</span> relates</span> to training</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, there's plenty</span> of that and it's all face-to-face</span>.<br/>
🎧 What's more, training</span> doesn't end when you start working for us.<br/>
🎧 It takes place before, during and after periods</span> of work.<br/>
🎧 Often, it's run by other experienced</span> volunteers</span> as managers</span> tend</span> to prefer</span> to get on with other things.<br/>
🎧 Now, I would ask you to consider</span> a couple</span> of important issues<br/></span>
🎧 before you decide to apply</span> for voluntary</span> work.<br/>
🎧 We don't worry</span> about why you want to be a volunteer</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 people have many different reasons</span> that range</span> from getting work experience</span> to just doing something they've</span> always wanted to do.<br/>
🎧 But it is critical</span> that you have enough hours in the day for whatever role</span> we agree is suitable</span> for you -<br/></span>
🎧 if being a volunteer</span> becomes</span> stressful</span> then it's best not to do it at all.<br/>
🎧 You may think that your income</span> is important, but we don't ask about that.<br/>
🎧 It's up to you to decide if you can work without earning</span> money.<br/>
🎧 What we value</span> is dedication</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some of our most loyal</span> volunteers</span> earn</span> very little themselves<br/></span>
🎧 but still give their full energy</span> to the work they do with us.<br/>
🎧 OK, so let's take a look at some of the work areas</span> that we need volunteers</span> for<br/></span>
🎧 and the sort</span> of things that would help you in those.<br/>
🎧 You may wish simply</span> to help us raise</span> money.<br/>
🎧 If you have the creativity</span> to come up with an imaginative</span> or novel</span> way of fundraising</span>, we'd be delighted</span>,<br/>
🎧 as standing</span> in the local</span> streets</span> or shops</span> with a collection</span> box can be rather boring</span>!<br/>
🎧 One outdoor</span> activity</span> that we need volunteers</span> for is litter</span> collection<br/></span>
🎧 and for this, it's useful</span> if you can walk</span> for long periods</span>, sometimes uphill</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some of our regular</span> collectors</span> are quite elderly</span>,<br/>
🎧 but very active</span> and keen</span> to protect</span> the environment</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you enjoy working with children, we have three</span> vacancies</span> for what are called 'playmates'</span>.<br/>
🎧 These volunteers</span> help children learn about staying</span> healthy</span> through a range</span> of out-of-school</span> activities</span>.<br/>
🎧 You don't need to have children yourself,<br/>
🎧 but it's good if you know something about nutrition</span> and can give clear</span> instructions</span>.<br/>
🎧 If that doesn't appeal</span> to you,<br/>
🎧 maybe you would be interested in helping</span> out at our story</span> club</span> for disabled</span> children,<br/>
🎧 especially</span> if you have done some acting</span>.<br/>
🎧 We put on three</span> performances</span> a year based</span> on books they have read<br/></span>
🎧 and we're always looking for support</span> with the theatrical</span> side of this.<br/>
🎧 The last area</span> I'll mention</span> today is first aid</span>.<br/>
🎧 Volunteers</span> who join this group can end up teaching</span> others</span> in vulnerable</span> groups</span> who may be at risk</span> of injury</span>.<br/>
🎧 Initially</span>, though, your priority</span> will be to take in a lot of information<br/></span>
🎧 and not forget</span> any important steps</span> or details</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, so does anyone</span> have any questions..</span>.<br/>

🎧 Hi Chantal</span>. What did you think of the talk, then?<br/>
🎧 Hi Hugo</span>.<br/>
🎧 I thought it was good once I'd moved</span> seats</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, were the people beside</span> you chatting</span> or something?<br/>
🎧 It wasn't that.<br/>
🎧 I went early</span> so that I'd get a seat</span> and not have to stand</span>,<br/>
🎧 but then this guy sat</span> right in front</span> of me and he was so tall</span>!<br/>
🎧 It's hard</span> to see through people's</span> heads</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Impossible</span>!<br/>
🎧 Anyway</span>, to answer your question</span>,<br/>
🎧 I thought it was really interesting</span>,<br/>
🎧 especially</span> what the speaker</span> said about the job</span> market</span>.<br/>
🎧 Me too.<br/>
🎧 I mean we know we're going into a really competitive</span> field</span> so it's obvious</span> that we may struggle</span> to get work.<br/>
🎧 That's right,<br/>
🎧 and we know we can't all have that 'dream</span> job'</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, but it looks like there's a whole range</span> of..</span>. areas</span> of work that we hadn't even thought of,<br/>
🎧 like fashion</span> journalism</span>, for instance</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I wasn't expecting</span> so many career</span> options.<br/>
🎧 Overall</span>, she had quite a strong</span> message</span>, didn't she?<br/>
🎧 She did.<br/>
🎧 She kept</span> saying things like 'I</span> know you all think this, but...'<br/></span>
🎧 and then she'd tell us how it really is.<br/>
🎧 Perhaps</span> she thinks</span> students are a bit narrow-minded</span> about the industry</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was a bit harsh</span>, though!<br/>
🎧 We know it's a tough industry</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, and we're only first-years</span>, after all.<br/>
🎧 We've got a lot to learn.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 Do you think our secondary</span> school education</span> should have been more career-focused</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, we had numerous</span> talks</span> on careers</span>, which was good,<br/>
🎧 but none</span> of them were very inspiring</span>.<br/>
🎧 They could've asked</span> more people like today's</span> speaker</span> to talk to us.<br/>
🎧 I agree.<br/>
🎧 We were told about lots of different careers</span>, just when we needed</span> to be,<br/>
🎧 but not by the experts</span> who really know stuff</span>.<br/>
🎧 So did today's</span> talk influence</span> your thoughts</span> on what career</span> you'd like to take up in the future?<br/>
🎧 Well. I promised</span> myself that I'd go through this course and keep an open mind</span> till</span> the end.<br/>
🎧 But I think it's better to pick</span> an area</span> of the industry</span> now and then aim</span> to get better and better at it.<br/>
🎧 Well, I think we'll just have to differ</span> on that issue!<br/>
🎧 One thing's</span> for certain</span>, though.<br/>
🎧 From what she said, we'll be unpaid</span> assistants</span> in the industry</span> for quite a long time.<br/>
🎧 I'm prepared</span> for that, aren't you?<br/>
🎧 Actually, I'm not going to accept</span> that view</span>.<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 But she knows</span> it's the case,<br/>
🎧 and everyone else says the same.<br/>
🎧 That doesn't mean it has to be true</span> for me.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Well, I hope you're right!<br/>
🎧 I thought the speaker's</span> account</span> of her first job</span> was fascinating</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, she admitted</span> she was lucky</span> to get work being a personal dresser</span> for a musician</span>.<br/>
🎧 She didn't even apply</span> for the job<br/></span>
🎧 and there she was getting paid</span> to choose all his clothes</span>.<br/>
🎧 It must have felt</span> amazing,<br/>
🎧 though she said all she was looking for back then was experience</span>, not financial</span> reward</span>.<br/>
🎧 And then he was so mean, telling</span> her she was more interested in her own appearance</span> than his!<br/>
🎧 But she did realise</span> he was right about that,<br/>
🎧 which really made me think.<br/>
🎧 I'm always considering</span> my own clothes<br/></span>
🎧 but now I can see you should be focusing</span> on your client</span>!<br/>
🎧 She obviously</span> regretted</span> losing</span> the job</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, as she said, she should have hidden</span> her negative</span> feelings</span> about him, but she didn't.<br/>
🎧 It was really brave</span> the way she picked</span> herself</span> up and took that job</span> in retail</span>.<br/>
🎧 Fancy</span> working in a shop</span> after that!<br/>
🎧 Yeah, well, she recommended</span> we all do it at some point</span>.<br/>
🎧 I guess</span> as a designer</span> you'd get to find out some useful</span> information</span>,<br/>
🎧 like how big or small the average</span> shopper</span> is.<br/>
🎧 I think that's an issue for manufacturers</span>, not designers</span>.<br/>
🎧 However</span>, it would be useful</span> to know if there's a gap</span> in the market</span>, you know,<br/>
🎧 an item</span> that no one's</span> stocking</span> but that consumers</span> are looking for.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, people don't give up searching</span>.<br/>
🎧 They also take things back to the store</span> if they aren't right.<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 Imagine</span> you worked</span> in an expensive</span> shop<br/></span>
🎧 and you found</span> out the garments</span> sold</span> there were being returned</span> because they..</span>. fell</span> apart</span> in the wash</span>!<br/>
🎧 Yeah, it would be good to know that kind of thing.<br/>

🎧 For my presentation</span> today<br/></span>
🎧 I want to tell you about how groups</span> of elephants</span> have been moved</span> and settled</span> in new reserves</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is known</span> as translocation</span> and has been carried</span> out in Malawi</span> in Africa</span> in recent</span> years.<br/>
🎧 The reason</span> this is being done is because of overpopulation</span> of elephants</span> in some areas</span>.<br/>
🎧 Overpopulation</span> is a good problem</span> to have<br/></span>
🎧 and not one we tend</span> to hear about very often.<br/>
🎧 In Malawi's</span> Majete</span> National</span> Park<br/></span>
🎧 the elephant</span> population</span> had been wiped</span> out by poachers</span>,<br/>
🎧 who killed</span> the elephants</span> for their ivory</span>.<br/>
🎧 But in 2003</span>,<br/>
🎧 the park</span> was restocked</span> and effective</span> law enforcement</span> was introduced</span>.<br/>
🎧 Since then, not a single</span> elephant</span> has been poached</span>.<br/>
🎧 In this safe</span> environment</span>, the elephant</span> population</span> boomed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Breeding</span> went so well that there were more elephants</span> than the park</span> could support</span>.<br/>
🎧 This led</span> to a number of problems</span>.<br/>
🎧 Firstly</span>, there was more competition</span> for food,<br/>
🎧 which meant</span> that some elephants</span> were suffering</span> from hunger</span>.<br/>
🎧 As there was a limit</span> to the amount of food in the national</span> park</span>,<br/>
🎧 some elephants</span> began</span> looking further</span> afield</span>.<br/>
🎧 Elephants</span> were routinely</span> knocking</span> down fences</span> around the park</span>,<br/>
🎧 which then had to be repaired</span> at a significant</span> cost</span>.<br/>
🎧 To solve</span> this problem</span>,<br/>
🎧 the decision</span> was made to move dozens</span> of elephants</span> from Majete</span> National</span> Park</span> to Nkhotakota</span> Wildlife</span> Park</span>,<br/>
🎧 where there were no elephants</span>.<br/>
🎧 But, obviously</span>, attempting</span> to move significant</span> numbers</span> of elephants</span> to a new home 300</span> kilometres</span> away is quite a challenge</span>.<br/>
🎧 So how did this translocation</span> process</span> work in practice?<br/>
🎧 Elephants</span> were moved</span> in groups</span> of between eight</span> and twenty</span>,<br/>
🎧 all belonging</span> to one family</span>.<br/>
🎧 Because relationships</span> are very important to elephants</span>,<br/>
🎧 they all had to be moved</span> at the same time.<br/>
🎧 A team</span> of vets</span> and park</span> rangers</span> flew</span> over the park</span> in helicopters</span> and targeted</span> a group,<br/>
🎧 which were rounded</span> up and directed</span> to a designated</span> open plain</span>.<br/>
🎧 The vets</span> then used darts</span> to immobilise</span> the elephants</span>.<br/>
🎧 This was a tricky</span> manoeuvre</span>,<br/>
🎧 as they not only had to select</span> the right dose</span> of tranquiliser</span> for different-sized</span> elephants<br/></span>
🎧 but they had to dart</span> the elephants</span> as they were running</span> around.<br/>
🎧 This also had to be done as quickly as possible<br/></span>
🎧 so as to minimise</span> the stress</span> caused</span>.<br/>
🎧 As soon as the elephants</span> began</span> to flop</span> onto</span> the ground</span>,<br/>
🎧 the team</span> moved</span> in to take care</span> of them.<br/>
🎧 To avoid</span> the risk</span> of suffocation</span>,<br/>
🎧 the team</span> had to make sure none</span> of the elephants</span> were lying</span> on their chests<br/></span>
🎧 because their lungs</span> could be crushed</span> in this position</span>.<br/>
🎧 So all the elephants</span> had to be placed</span> on their sides</span>.<br/>
🎧 One person stayed</span> with each elephant<br/></span>
🎧 while they waited</span> for the vets</span> to do checks</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was very important to keep an eye on their breathing</span>.<br/>
🎧 If there were fewer</span> than six breaths</span> per</span> minute</span>,<br/>
🎧 the elephant</span> would need urgent</span> medical</span> attention</span>.<br/>
🎧 Collars</span> were fitted</span> to the matriarch</span> in each group<br/></span>
🎧 so their movements</span> could be tracked</span> in their new home.<br/>
🎧 Measurements</span> were taken of each elephant's</span> tusks</span>.<br/>
🎧 Elephants</span> with large tusks</span> would be at greater</span> risk</span> from poachers<br/></span>
🎧 and also of their feet</span>.<br/>
🎧 The elephants</span> were then taken to a recovery</span> area<br/></span>
🎧 before being loaded</span> onto</span> trucks</span> and transported</span> to their new home.<br/>
🎧 The elephants</span> translocated</span> to Nkhotakota</span> settled</span> in very well<br/></span>
🎧 and the project</span> has generally</span> been accepted</span> to have been a huge</span> success<br/></span>
🎧 and not just for the elephants</span>.<br/>
🎧 Employment</span> prospects</span> have improved</span> enormously</span>,<br/>
🎧 contributing</span> to rising</span> living standards</span> for the whole community</span>.<br/>
🎧 Poaching</span> is no longer</span> an issue,<br/>
🎧 as former</span> poachers</span> are able to find more reliable</span> sources</span> of income</span>.<br/>
🎧 In fact</span>, many of them volunteered</span> to give up their weapons</span>,<br/>
🎧 as they were no longer</span> of any use to them.<br/>
🎧 More than two dozen</span> elephants</span> have been born</span> at Nkhotakota</span> since relocation</span>.<br/>
🎧 With an area</span> of more than 1,800</span> square</span> kilometres</span>,<br/>
🎧 there's plenty</span> of space</span> for the elephant</span> population</span> to continue</span> to grow</span>.<br/>
🎧 Their presence</span> is also helping</span> to rebalance</span> Nkhotakota's</span> damaged</span> ecosystem<br/></span>
🎧 and providing</span> a sustainable</span> conservation</span> model</span>, which could be replicated</span> in other parks</span>.<br/>
🎧 All this has been a big draw</span> for tourism</span>,<br/>
🎧 which contributes</span> five</span> times</span> more than the illegal</span> wildlife</span> trade</span> to GDP</span>,<br/>
🎧 and this is mainly</span> because of the elephants</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's also been a dramatic</span> rise..</span>.<br/>
<br/><br/>
