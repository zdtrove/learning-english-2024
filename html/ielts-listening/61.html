🎧 <span>Excuse</span> me.<br/>
🎧 Would you <span>mind</span> if I <span>asked</span> you some <span>questions</span>?<br/>
🎧 We're doing a <span>survey</span> on <span>transport</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's OK.<br/>
🎧 First of all, can I take your name?<br/>
🎧 Yes. It's <span>Sadie</span> <span>Jones</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks very much.<br/>
🎧 And could I have your date of <span>birth</span> <span>-</span> just the year will do, actually.<br/>
🎧 Is that alright?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's fine.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>1991</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, next, your <span>postcode</span>, please.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>DW307YZ</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great. Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Is that in <span>Wells</span>?<br/>
🎧 No it's actually in <span>Harborne</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Wells</span> isn't <span>far</span> from there, though.<br/>
🎧 I really like that <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>grandmother</span> <span>lived</span> there when I was a <span>kid</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it is nice.<br/>
🎧 Right, so now I want to ask you some <span>questions</span> about how you <span>travelled</span> here today.<br/>
🎧 Did you use <span>public</span> <span>transport</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes. I came by bus.<br/>
🎧 OK. And that was today.<br/>
🎧 It's the <span>24th</span> of <span>April</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Isn't it the <span>25th</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Ah..</span>. no, actually, you're right.<br/>
🎧 And what was the <span>reason</span> for your <span>trip</span> today?<br/>
🎧 I can see you've got some <span>shopping</span> with you.<br/>
🎧 Yes. I did some <span>shopping<br/></span>
🎧 but the <span>main</span> <span>reason</span> I came here was to go to the <span>dentist</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's not much fun.<br/>
🎧 Hope it was <span>nothing</span> serious.<br/>
🎧 No, it was just a <span>check-up</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's fine.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 Do you <span>normally</span> travel by bus into the <span>city</span> <span>centre</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes. I <span>stopped</span> driving in <span>ages</span> <span>ago<br/></span>
🎧 because <span>parking</span> was so <span>difficult</span> to <span>find<br/></span>
🎧 and it <span>costs</span> so much.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 The bus is much more <span>convenient</span> too.<br/>
🎧 It only takes about <span>30</span> <span>minutes</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's good.<br/>
🎧 So where did you start your <span>journey</span>?<br/>
🎧 At the bus <span>stop</span> on <span>Claxby</span> <span>Street</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is that <span>C-L-A-X-B-Y</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 And how <span>satisfied</span> with the <span>service</span> are you?<br/>
🎧 Do you have any <span>complaints</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, as I said, it's very <span>convenient</span> and <span>quick</span> when it's on time,<br/>
🎧 but this morning it was <span>late</span>.<br/>
🎧 Only about <span>10</span> <span>minutes</span>, but still.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I <span>understand</span> that's <span>annoying</span>.<br/>
🎧 And what about the <span>timetable</span>?<br/>
🎧 Do you have any <span>comments</span> about that?<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> I <span>mainly</span> use the bus during the day,<br/>
🎧 but any time I've been in <span>town</span> in the <span>evening</span>, for dinner or at the <span>cinema</span>,<br/>
🎧 I've <span>noticed</span> you have to wait a long time for a bus.<br/>
🎧 There aren't that many.<br/>
🎧 OK, thanks.<br/>
🎧 So now I'd like to ask you about your car use.<br/>
🎧 Well, I have got a car but I don't use it that often.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mainly</span> just to go to the <span>supermarket</span>.<br/>
🎧 But that's about it really.<br/>
🎧 My <span>husband</span> <span>uses</span> it at the <span>weekends</span> to go to the <span>golf</span> <span>club</span>.<br/>
🎧 And what about a <span>bicycle</span>?<br/>
🎧 I don't actually have one at the <span>moment</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about the <span>city</span> <span>bikes</span> you can <span>rent</span>?<br/>
🎧 Do you ever use those?<br/>
🎧 No, I'm not <span>keen</span> on <span>cycling</span> there because of all the <span>pollution</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I would like to get a <span>bike</span>, it would be good to use it to get to work.<br/>
🎧 So why haven't you got one now?<br/>
🎧 Well, I live in a <span>flat</span>, on the second <span>floor<br/></span>
🎧 and it doesn't have any <span>storage</span>,<br/>
🎧 so we'd have to leave it in the <span>hall</span> outside the <span>flat</span>.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
🎧 OK. Well, I think that's <span>all..</span>.<br/>

🎧 Good <span>evening</span>, everyone.<br/>
🎧 Let me start by <span>welcoming</span> you all to this talk and <span>thanking</span> you for taking the time to <span>consider</span> <span>joining</span> <span>ACE</span> <span>voluntary</span> <span>organisation</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>ACE</span> <span>offers</span> <span>support</span> to people and <span>services</span> in the <span>local</span> <span>area<br/></span>
🎧 and we're now looking for more <span>volunteers</span> to help us do this.<br/>
🎧 By the way, I hope you're all <span>comfortable</span>,<br/>
🎧 we have <span>brought</span> in <span>extra</span> <span>seats</span> so that no one has to <span>stand</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it does mean that the people at the back of the room may be a bit <span>squashed</span>.<br/>
🎧 We'll only be here for about <span>half</span> an <span>hour</span> so, <span>hopefully</span>, that's OK.<br/>
🎧 One of the first <span>questions</span> we're often <span>asked</span> is how old you need to be to <span>volunteer</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, you can be as young as <span>16</span> or you can be <span>60</span> or over:<br/>
🎧 it all <span>depends</span> on what <span>type</span> of <span>voluntary</span> work you want to do.<br/>
🎧 Other <span>considerations</span>, such as <span>reliability</span>, are <span>crucial</span> in <span>voluntary</span> <span>work<br/></span>
🎧 and age isn't <span>related</span> to these, in our <span>experience</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>question</span> we get <span>asked</span> <span>relates</span> to <span>training</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, there's <span>plenty</span> of that and it's all <span>face-to-face</span>.<br/>
🎧 What's more, <span>training</span> doesn't end when you start working for us.<br/>
🎧 It takes place before, during and after <span>periods</span> of work.<br/>
🎧 Often, it's run by other <span>experienced</span> <span>volunteers</span> as <span>managers</span> <span>tend</span> to <span>prefer</span> to get on with other things.<br/>
🎧 Now, I would ask you to <span>consider</span> a <span>couple</span> of important <span>issues<br/></span>
🎧 before you decide to <span>apply</span> for <span>voluntary</span> work.<br/>
🎧 We don't <span>worry</span> about why you want to be a <span>volunteer</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 people have many different <span>reasons</span> that <span>range</span> from getting work <span>experience</span> to just doing something <span>they've</span> always wanted to do.<br/>
🎧 But it is <span>critical</span> that you have enough hours in the day for whatever <span>role</span> we agree is <span>suitable</span> for you <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 if being a <span>volunteer</span> <span>becomes</span> <span>stressful</span> then it's best not to do it at all.<br/>
🎧 You may think that your <span>income</span> is important, but we don't ask about that.<br/>
🎧 It's up to you to decide if you can work without <span>earning</span> money.<br/>
🎧 What we <span>value</span> is <span>dedication</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some of our most <span>loyal</span> <span>volunteers</span> <span>earn</span> very little <span>themselves<br/></span>
🎧 but still give their full <span>energy</span> to the work they do with us.<br/>
🎧 OK, so let's take a look at some of the work <span>areas</span> that we need <span>volunteers</span> <span>for<br/></span>
🎧 and the <span>sort</span> of things that would help you in those.<br/>
🎧 You may wish <span>simply</span> to help us <span>raise</span> money.<br/>
🎧 If you have the <span>creativity</span> to come up with an <span>imaginative</span> or <span>novel</span> way of <span>fundraising</span>, we'd be <span>delighted</span>,<br/>
🎧 as <span>standing</span> in the <span>local</span> <span>streets</span> or <span>shops</span> with a <span>collection</span> box can be rather <span>boring</span>!<br/>
🎧 One <span>outdoor</span> <span>activity</span> that we need <span>volunteers</span> for is <span>litter</span> <span>collection<br/></span>
🎧 and for this, it's <span>useful</span> if you can <span>walk</span> for long <span>periods</span>, sometimes <span>uphill</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some of our <span>regular</span> <span>collectors</span> are quite <span>elderly</span>,<br/>
🎧 but very <span>active</span> and <span>keen</span> to <span>protect</span> the <span>environment</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you enjoy working with children, we have <span>three</span> <span>vacancies</span> for what are called <span>'playmates'</span>.<br/>
🎧 These <span>volunteers</span> help children learn about <span>staying</span> <span>healthy</span> through a <span>range</span> of <span>out-of-school</span> <span>activities</span>.<br/>
🎧 You don't need to have children yourself,<br/>
🎧 but it's good if you know something about <span>nutrition</span> and can give <span>clear</span> <span>instructions</span>.<br/>
🎧 If that doesn't <span>appeal</span> to you,<br/>
🎧 maybe you would be interested in <span>helping</span> out at our <span>story</span> <span>club</span> for <span>disabled</span> children,<br/>
🎧 <span>especially</span> if you have done some <span>acting</span>.<br/>
🎧 We put on <span>three</span> <span>performances</span> a year <span>based</span> on books they have <span>read<br/></span>
🎧 and we're always looking for <span>support</span> with the <span>theatrical</span> side of this.<br/>
🎧 The last <span>area</span> I'll <span>mention</span> today is first <span>aid</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Volunteers</span> who join this group can end up <span>teaching</span> <span>others</span> in <span>vulnerable</span> <span>groups</span> who may be at <span>risk</span> of <span>injury</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Initially</span>, though, your <span>priority</span> will be to take in a lot of <span>information<br/></span>
🎧 and not <span>forget</span> any important <span>steps</span> or <span>details</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, so does <span>anyone</span> have any <span>questions..</span>.<br/>

🎧 Hi <span>Chantal</span>. What did you think of the talk, then?<br/>
🎧 Hi <span>Hugo</span>.<br/>
🎧 I thought it was good once I'd <span>moved</span> <span>seats</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, were the people <span>beside</span> you <span>chatting</span> or something?<br/>
🎧 It wasn't that.<br/>
🎧 I went <span>early</span> so that I'd get a <span>seat</span> and not have to <span>stand</span>,<br/>
🎧 but then this guy <span>sat</span> right in <span>front</span> of me and he was so <span>tall</span>!<br/>
🎧 It's <span>hard</span> to see through <span>people's</span> <span>heads</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 <span>Impossible</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, to answer your <span>question</span>,<br/>
🎧 I thought it was really <span>interesting</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>especially</span> what the <span>speaker</span> said about the <span>job</span> <span>market</span>.<br/>
🎧 Me too.<br/>
🎧 I mean we know we're going into a really <span>competitive</span> <span>field</span> so it's <span>obvious</span> that we may <span>struggle</span> to get work.<br/>
🎧 That's right,<br/>
🎧 and we know we can't all have that <span>'dream</span> <span>job'</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, but it looks like there's a whole <span>range</span> <span>of..</span>. <span>areas</span> of work that we hadn't even thought of,<br/>
🎧 like <span>fashion</span> <span>journalism</span>, for <span>instance</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I wasn't <span>expecting</span> so many <span>career</span> options.<br/>
🎧 <span>Overall</span>, she had quite a <span>strong</span> <span>message</span>, didn't she?<br/>
🎧 She did.<br/>
🎧 She <span>kept</span> saying things like <span>'I</span> know you all think this, <span>but...'<br/></span>
🎧 and then she'd tell us how it really is.<br/>
🎧 <span>Perhaps</span> she <span>thinks</span> students are a bit <span>narrow-minded</span> about the <span>industry</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was a bit <span>harsh</span>, though!<br/>
🎧 We know it's a tough <span>industry</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, and we're only <span>first-years</span>, after all.<br/>
🎧 We've got a lot to learn.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 Do you think our <span>secondary</span> school <span>education</span> should have been more <span>career-focused</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, we had <span>numerous</span> <span>talks</span> on <span>careers</span>, which was good,<br/>
🎧 but <span>none</span> of them were very <span>inspiring</span>.<br/>
🎧 They could've <span>asked</span> more people like <span>today's</span> <span>speaker</span> to talk to us.<br/>
🎧 I agree.<br/>
🎧 We were told about lots of different <span>careers</span>, just when we <span>needed</span> to be,<br/>
🎧 but not by the <span>experts</span> who really know <span>stuff</span>.<br/>
🎧 So did <span>today's</span> talk <span>influence</span> your <span>thoughts</span> on what <span>career</span> you'd like to take up in the future?<br/>
🎧 Well. I <span>promised</span> myself that I'd go through this course and keep an open <span>mind</span> <span>till</span> the end.<br/>
🎧 But I think it's better to <span>pick</span> an <span>area</span> of the <span>industry</span> now and then <span>aim</span> to get better and better at it.<br/>
🎧 Well, I think we'll just have to <span>differ</span> on that issue!<br/>
🎧 One <span>thing's</span> for <span>certain</span>, though.<br/>
🎧 From what she said, we'll be <span>unpaid</span> <span>assistants</span> in the <span>industry</span> for quite a long time.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>prepared</span> for that, aren't you?<br/>
🎧 Actually, I'm not going to <span>accept</span> that <span>view</span>.<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 But she <span>knows</span> it's the case,<br/>
🎧 and everyone else says the same.<br/>
🎧 That doesn't mean it has to be <span>true</span> for me.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Well, I hope you're right!<br/>
🎧 I thought the <span>speaker's</span> <span>account</span> of her first <span>job</span> was <span>fascinating</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, she <span>admitted</span> she was <span>lucky</span> to get work being a personal <span>dresser</span> for a <span>musician</span>.<br/>
🎧 She didn't even <span>apply</span> for the <span>job<br/></span>
🎧 and there she was getting <span>paid</span> to choose all his <span>clothes</span>.<br/>
🎧 It must have <span>felt</span> amazing,<br/>
🎧 though she said all she was looking for back then was <span>experience</span>, not <span>financial</span> <span>reward</span>.<br/>
🎧 And then he was so mean, <span>telling</span> her she was more interested in her own <span>appearance</span> than his!<br/>
🎧 But she did <span>realise</span> he was right about that,<br/>
🎧 which really made me think.<br/>
🎧 I'm always <span>considering</span> my own <span>clothes<br/></span>
🎧 but now I can see you should be <span>focusing</span> on your <span>client</span>!<br/>
🎧 She <span>obviously</span> <span>regretted</span> <span>losing</span> the <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, as she said, she should have <span>hidden</span> her <span>negative</span> <span>feelings</span> about him, but she didn't.<br/>
🎧 It was really <span>brave</span> the way she <span>picked</span> <span>herself</span> up and took that <span>job</span> in <span>retail</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Fancy</span> working in a <span>shop</span> after that!<br/>
🎧 Yeah, well, she <span>recommended</span> we all do it at some <span>point</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>guess</span> as a <span>designer</span> you'd get to find out some <span>useful</span> <span>information</span>,<br/>
🎧 like how big or small the <span>average</span> <span>shopper</span> is.<br/>
🎧 I think that's an issue for <span>manufacturers</span>, not <span>designers</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, it would be <span>useful</span> to know if there's a <span>gap</span> in the <span>market</span>, you know,<br/>
🎧 an <span>item</span> that no <span>one's</span> <span>stocking</span> but that <span>consumers</span> are looking for.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, people don't give up <span>searching</span>.<br/>
🎧 They also take things back to the <span>store</span> if they aren't right.<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 <span>Imagine</span> you <span>worked</span> in an <span>expensive</span> <span>shop<br/></span>
🎧 and you <span>found</span> out the <span>garments</span> <span>sold</span> there were being <span>returned</span> because <span>they..</span>. <span>fell</span> <span>apart</span> in the <span>wash</span>!<br/>
🎧 Yeah, it would be good to know that kind of thing.<br/>

🎧 For my <span>presentation</span> <span>today<br/></span>
🎧 I want to tell you about how <span>groups</span> of <span>elephants</span> have been <span>moved</span> and <span>settled</span> in new <span>reserves</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is <span>known</span> as <span>translocation</span> and has been <span>carried</span> out in <span>Malawi</span> in <span>Africa</span> in <span>recent</span> years.<br/>
🎧 The <span>reason</span> this is being done is because of <span>overpopulation</span> of <span>elephants</span> in some <span>areas</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Overpopulation</span> is a good <span>problem</span> to <span>have<br/></span>
🎧 and not one we <span>tend</span> to hear about very often.<br/>
🎧 In <span>Malawi's</span> <span>Majete</span> <span>National</span> <span>Park<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>elephant</span> <span>population</span> had been <span>wiped</span> out by <span>poachers</span>,<br/>
🎧 who <span>killed</span> the <span>elephants</span> for their <span>ivory</span>.<br/>
🎧 But in <span>2003</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>park</span> was <span>restocked</span> and <span>effective</span> law <span>enforcement</span> was <span>introduced</span>.<br/>
🎧 Since then, not a <span>single</span> <span>elephant</span> has been <span>poached</span>.<br/>
🎧 In this <span>safe</span> <span>environment</span>, the <span>elephant</span> <span>population</span> <span>boomed</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Breeding</span> went so well that there were more <span>elephants</span> than the <span>park</span> could <span>support</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>led</span> to a number of <span>problems</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Firstly</span>, there was more <span>competition</span> for food,<br/>
🎧 which <span>meant</span> that some <span>elephants</span> were <span>suffering</span> from <span>hunger</span>.<br/>
🎧 As there was a <span>limit</span> to the amount of food in the <span>national</span> <span>park</span>,<br/>
🎧 some <span>elephants</span> <span>began</span> looking <span>further</span> <span>afield</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Elephants</span> were <span>routinely</span> <span>knocking</span> down <span>fences</span> around the <span>park</span>,<br/>
🎧 which then had to be <span>repaired</span> at a <span>significant</span> <span>cost</span>.<br/>
🎧 To <span>solve</span> this <span>problem</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>decision</span> was made to move <span>dozens</span> of <span>elephants</span> from <span>Majete</span> <span>National</span> <span>Park</span> to <span>Nkhotakota</span> <span>Wildlife</span> <span>Park</span>,<br/>
🎧 where there were no <span>elephants</span>.<br/>
🎧 But, <span>obviously</span>, <span>attempting</span> to move <span>significant</span> <span>numbers</span> of <span>elephants</span> to a new home <span>300</span> <span>kilometres</span> away is quite a <span>challenge</span>.<br/>
🎧 So how did this <span>translocation</span> <span>process</span> work in practice?<br/>
🎧 <span>Elephants</span> were <span>moved</span> in <span>groups</span> of between <span>eight</span> and <span>twenty</span>,<br/>
🎧 all <span>belonging</span> to one <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 Because <span>relationships</span> are very important to <span>elephants</span>,<br/>
🎧 they all had to be <span>moved</span> at the same time.<br/>
🎧 A <span>team</span> of <span>vets</span> and <span>park</span> <span>rangers</span> <span>flew</span> over the <span>park</span> in <span>helicopters</span> and <span>targeted</span> a group,<br/>
🎧 which were <span>rounded</span> up and <span>directed</span> to a <span>designated</span> open <span>plain</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>vets</span> then used <span>darts</span> to <span>immobilise</span> the <span>elephants</span>.<br/>
🎧 This was a <span>tricky</span> <span>manoeuvre</span>,<br/>
🎧 as they not only had to <span>select</span> the right <span>dose</span> of <span>tranquiliser</span> for <span>different-sized</span> <span>elephants<br/></span>
🎧 but they had to <span>dart</span> the <span>elephants</span> as they were <span>running</span> around.<br/>
🎧 This also had to be done as quickly as <span>possible<br/></span>
🎧 so as to <span>minimise</span> the <span>stress</span> <span>caused</span>.<br/>
🎧 As soon as the <span>elephants</span> <span>began</span> to <span>flop</span> <span>onto</span> the <span>ground</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>team</span> <span>moved</span> in to take <span>care</span> of them.<br/>
🎧 To <span>avoid</span> the <span>risk</span> of <span>suffocation</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>team</span> had to make sure <span>none</span> of the <span>elephants</span> were <span>lying</span> on their <span>chests<br/></span>
🎧 because their <span>lungs</span> could be <span>crushed</span> in this <span>position</span>.<br/>
🎧 So all the <span>elephants</span> had to be <span>placed</span> on their <span>sides</span>.<br/>
🎧 One person <span>stayed</span> with each <span>elephant<br/></span>
🎧 while they <span>waited</span> for the <span>vets</span> to do <span>checks</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was very important to keep an eye on their <span>breathing</span>.<br/>
🎧 If there were <span>fewer</span> than six <span>breaths</span> <span>per</span> <span>minute</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>elephant</span> would need <span>urgent</span> <span>medical</span> <span>attention</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Collars</span> were <span>fitted</span> to the <span>matriarch</span> in each <span>group<br/></span>
🎧 so their <span>movements</span> could be <span>tracked</span> in their new home.<br/>
🎧 <span>Measurements</span> were taken of each <span>elephant's</span> <span>tusks</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Elephants</span> with large <span>tusks</span> would be at <span>greater</span> <span>risk</span> from <span>poachers<br/></span>
🎧 and also of their <span>feet</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>elephants</span> were then taken to a <span>recovery</span> <span>area<br/></span>
🎧 before being <span>loaded</span> <span>onto</span> <span>trucks</span> and <span>transported</span> to their new home.<br/>
🎧 The <span>elephants</span> <span>translocated</span> to <span>Nkhotakota</span> <span>settled</span> in very <span>well<br/></span>
🎧 and the <span>project</span> has <span>generally</span> been <span>accepted</span> to have been a <span>huge</span> <span>success<br/></span>
🎧 and not just for the <span>elephants</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Employment</span> <span>prospects</span> have <span>improved</span> <span>enormously</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>contributing</span> to <span>rising</span> living <span>standards</span> for the whole <span>community</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Poaching</span> is no <span>longer</span> an issue,<br/>
🎧 as <span>former</span> <span>poachers</span> are able to find more <span>reliable</span> <span>sources</span> of <span>income</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, many of them <span>volunteered</span> to give up their <span>weapons</span>,<br/>
🎧 as they were no <span>longer</span> of any use to them.<br/>
🎧 More than two <span>dozen</span> <span>elephants</span> have been <span>born</span> at <span>Nkhotakota</span> since <span>relocation</span>.<br/>
🎧 With an <span>area</span> of more than <span>1,800</span> <span>square</span> <span>kilometres</span>,<br/>
🎧 there's <span>plenty</span> of <span>space</span> for the <span>elephant</span> <span>population</span> to <span>continue</span> to <span>grow</span>.<br/>
🎧 Their <span>presence</span> is also <span>helping</span> to <span>rebalance</span> <span>Nkhotakota's</span> <span>damaged</span> <span>ecosystem<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>providing</span> a <span>sustainable</span> <span>conservation</span> <span>model</span>, which could be <span>replicated</span> in other <span>parks</span>.<br/>
🎧 All this has been a big <span>draw</span> for <span>tourism</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>contributes</span> <span>five</span> <span>times</span> more than the <span>illegal</span> <span>wildlife</span> <span>trade</span> to <span>GDP</span>,<br/>
🎧 and this is <span>mainly</span> because of the <span>elephants</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's also been a <span>dramatic</span> <span>rise..</span>.<br/>
