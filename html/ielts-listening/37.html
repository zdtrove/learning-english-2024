🎧 Hi. Can I help you?<br/>
🎧 I'd like to find out if you have any <span>excursions</span> <span>suitable</span> for <span>families</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 How about taking your <span>family</span> for a <span>cruise</span>?<br/>
🎧 We have a <span>steamship</span> that takes <span>passengers</span> out <span>several</span> <span>times</span> a day <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it's over <span>100</span> years old.<br/>
🎧 That sounds <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 How long is the <span>trip</span>?<br/>
🎧 About an <span>hour</span> and a <span>half</span>.<br/>
🎧 And don't <span>forget</span> to take <span>pictures</span> of the <span>mountains</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're all around you when you're on the <span>boat</span> and they look <span>fantastic</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And I <span>assume</span> there's a <span>café</span> or something on <span>board</span>?<br/>
🎧 Sure. How old are your children?<br/>
🎧 <span>Er</span>, my <span>daughter's</span> <span>fifteen</span> and my <span>son's</span> <span>seven</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Well, there are <span>various</span> things you can do once you've <span>crossed</span> the <span>lake</span>, to make a day of it.<br/>
🎧 One thing that's very <span>popular</span> is a visit to the <span>Country</span> <span>Farm</span>.<br/>
🎧 You're <span>met</span> off the <span>boat</span> by the <span>farmer</span> and he'll take you to the <span>holding</span> <span>pens</span>, where the <span>sheep</span> are <span>kept</span>.<br/>
🎧 Children love <span>feeding</span> them!<br/>
🎧 My son would love that.<br/>
🎧 He really likes <span>animals</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, there's also a <span>40-minute</span> <span>trek</span> <span>round</span> the <span>farm</span> on a <span>horse</span>, if he <span>wants</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you think he'd <span>manage</span> it?<br/>
🎧 He hasn't done that before.<br/>
🎧 Sure. It's <span>suitable</span> for <span>complete</span> <span>beginners</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 And again, <span>visitors</span> are <span>welcome</span> to <span>explore</span> the <span>farm</span> on their own,<br/>
🎧 as long as they take <span>care</span> to <span>close</span> <span>gates</span> and so on.<br/>
🎧 There are some very <span>beautiful</span> <span>gardens</span> along the side of the <span>lake</span> which also <span>belong</span> to the <span>farm</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 they'll be just at their best now.<br/>
🎧 You could <span>easily</span> <span>spend</span> an <span>hour</span> or two there.<br/>
🎧 OK. Well that all sounds good.<br/>
🎧 And can we get lunch there?<br/>
🎧 You can, and it's very good, though it's not <span>included</span> in the <span>basic</span> <span>cost</span>.<br/>
🎧 You pay when you get there.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So is there anything else to do over on that side of the <span>lake</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, what you can do is take a <span>bike</span> over on the <span>ship</span> and then go on a <span>cycling</span> <span>trip</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>trail</span> there called the Back <span>Road</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 you could <span>easily</span> <span>spend</span> <span>three</span> or <span>four</span> hours <span>exploring</span> it,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>scenery's</span> wonderful.<br/>
🎧 They'll give you a map when you get your <span>ticket</span> for the <span>cruise</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 there's no <span>extra</span> <span>charge</span>.<br/>
🎧 What's the <span>trail</span> like in <span>terms</span> of <span>difficulty</span>?<br/>
🎧 Quite <span>challenging</span> in <span>places</span>.<br/>
🎧 It wouldn't be <span>suitable</span> for your <span>seven-year-old</span>.<br/>
🎧 It needs <span>someone</span> who's got a bit more <span>experience</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, my <span>daughter</span> <span>loves</span> <span>cycling</span> and so do I, so maybe the two of us could go,<br/>
🎧 and my <span>wife</span> and son could <span>stay</span> on the <span>farm</span>.<br/>
🎧 That might work out quite well.<br/>
🎧 But we don't have <span>bikes</span> <span>here…<br/></span>
🎧 is there somewhere we could <span>rent</span> them?<br/>
🎧 Yes, there's a place here in the <span>city</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's called <span>Ratchesons</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll just make a <span>note</span> of <span>that..</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>er</span>, how do you <span>spell</span> it?<br/>
🎧 <span>RATCHESONS</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's just by the <span>cruise</span> <span>ship</span> <span>terminal</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 You'd also need to <span>pick</span> up a <span>repair</span> <span>kit</span> for the <span>bike</span> from there to take along with you,<br/>
🎧 and you'd need to take along a <span>snack</span> and some water <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it'd be best to get those in the <span>city</span>.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 That shouldn't be a <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 And I <span>assume</span> I can <span>rent</span> a <span>helmet</span> from the <span>bike</span> place?<br/>
🎧 Sure, you should definitely get that.<br/>
🎧 It's a great <span>ride</span>, but you want to be well <span>prepared</span> because it's very <span>remote</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 you won't see any <span>shops</span> <span>round</span> there, or <span>anywhere</span> to <span>stay</span>,<br/>
🎧 so you need to get back in time for the last <span>boat</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. So what <span>sort</span> of <span>prices</span> are we looking at here?<br/>
🎧 Let's see, that'd be one <span>adult</span> and one <span>child</span> for the <span>cruise</span> with <span>farm</span> <span>tour</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's <span>$117<br/></span>
🎧 and an <span>adult</span> and a <span>child</span> for the <span>cruise</span> only so that's <span>$214</span> <span>altogether</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, wait a <span>minute</span>,<br/>
🎧 how old did you say your <span>daughter</span> was?<br/>
🎧 <span>Fifteen</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then I'm <span>afraid</span> it's <span>$267<br/></span>
🎧 because she has to pay the <span>adult</span> <span>fare</span>, which is <span>$75<br/></span>
🎧 <span>instead</span> of the <span>child</span> <span>fare</span> which is <span>$22</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sorry about that.<br/>
🎧 That's OK.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Good morning everyone.<br/>
🎧 My <span>name's</span> <span>Joy</span> <span>Parkins</span> and I'm the <span>restaurant</span> <span>manager</span>.<br/>
🎧 And I <span>understand</span> that <span>none</span> of you've had any <span>previous</span> <span>experience</span> as <span>kitchen</span> <span>assistants</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, you might be feeling a bit <span>nervous</span> now,<br/>
🎧 but most of our <span>kitchen</span> <span>assistants</span> say they enjoy the work.<br/>
🎧 OK, they might get <span>shouted</span> at sometimes, but it's <span>nothing</span> personal,<br/>
🎧 and they're <span>pleased</span> that they have so many different things to do, which <span>means</span> they never get <span>bored</span>.<br/>
🎧 And I'll tell you <span>straightaway</span> that if you do well,<br/>
🎧 we might think about <span>moving</span> you up and <span>giving</span> you some more <span>responsibility</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, well, you've all <span>shown</span> up on time, which is an <span>excellent</span> start.<br/>
🎧 Now I'm glad to see <span>none</span> of you have <span>unsuitable</span> <span>footwear</span>, so that's good <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 you need to be <span>careful</span> as the <span>floors</span> can get very wet and <span>slippery</span>.<br/>
🎧 Those of you with long <span>hair</span> have got it well out of the way,<br/>
🎧 but some of you'll need to <span>remove</span> your <span>rings</span> and <span>bracelets</span> <span>-</span> just put them somewhere <span>safe</span> for today,<br/>
🎧 and remember to leave them at home <span>tomorrow</span>, as they can be a <span>safety</span> <span>hazard</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now it's going to be a <span>busy</span> day for you all today <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 we don't have any <span>tables</span> free for this <span>evening</span>,<br/>
🎧 and only a few for lunch.<br/>
🎧 <span>Fortunately</span> we've got our <span>Head</span> <span>Chef</span> back <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 he was away on <span>holiday</span> all last week which <span>meant</span> the other <span>chefs</span> had <span>extra</span> work.<br/>
🎧 Now, I'll tell you a bit more about the <span>job</span> in a <span>minute<br/></span>
🎧 but first, some <span>general</span> <span>regulations</span>.<br/>
🎧 For all of you, whatever your age,<br/>
🎧 there's some <span>equipment</span> you mustn't use until you've been <span>properly</span> <span>trained</span>,<br/>
🎧 like the <span>waste</span> <span>disposal</span> <span>system</span> for example,<br/>
🎧 for <span>health</span> and <span>safety</span> <span>reasons</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then I think there are two of you here who are under <span>18</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 that's <span>Emma</span> and <span>Jake</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Right, so for you two, the <span>meat</span> <span>slicer</span> is out of <span>bounds</span>.<br/>
🎧 And of course <span>none</span> of you are <span>allowed</span> to use the <span>electric</span> <span>mixer<br/></span>
🎧 until you've been <span>shown</span> how it <span>works</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now you may have heard that this can be a <span>stressful</span> <span>job</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I have to say that can be <span>true</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll be working an <span>eight-hour</span> day for the first week,<br/>
🎧 though you'll have the <span>chance</span> to do <span>overtime</span> after that as well if you want to.<br/>
🎧 But <span>however</span> long the hours are, you'll get a <span>break</span> in the <span>middle</span>.<br/>
🎧 What you will find is that you're on your <span>feet</span> all day long, <span>lifting</span> and <span>carrying</span>,<br/>
🎧 so if you're not fit now you soon will be!<br/>
🎧 You'll find you don't have much <span>chance</span> to take it easy <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 when <span>someone</span> tells you to do something you need to do it <span>straightaway</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 but at <span>least</span> we do have a very <span>efficient</span> air <span>conditioning</span> <span>system</span> <span>compared</span> with some <span>kitchens</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now let me tell you about some of the people you need to know.<br/>
🎧 So as I said, I'm <span>Joy</span> <span>Parkins<br/></span>
🎧 and I decide who does what during the day and how long they work for.<br/>
🎧 I'll be trying to get you to work with as many different people in the <span>kitchen</span> as <span>possible</span>,<br/>
🎧 so that you learn while you're on the <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 One person whose name you must remember is <span>David</span> <span>Field</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you <span>injure</span> yourself at all, even if it's really <span>minor</span>,<br/>
🎧 you must <span>report</span> to him and he'll make sure the <span>incident</span> is <span>recorded<br/></span>
🎧 and you get the <span>appropriate</span> <span>treatment</span>.<br/>
🎧 He's <span>trained</span> to give <span>basic</span> <span>treatment</span> to <span>staff</span> <span>himself</span>,<br/>
🎧 or he'll <span>send</span> you off somewhere else if <span>necessary</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then there's <span>Dexter</span> <span>Wills</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 he's the person you need to see if you <span>smash</span> a <span>plate</span> or something like that.<br/>
🎧 Don't just leave it and hope no one will <span>notice</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it's really important to get things <span>noted</span> and <span>replaced</span> or there could be <span>problems</span> later.<br/>
🎧 And finally, there's <span>Mike</span> <span>Smith</span>.<br/>
🎧 He's the <span>member</span> of <span>staff</span> who takes <span>care</span> of all the <span>stores</span> of <span>perishables</span>,<br/>
🎧 so if you <span>notice</span> we're getting low in <span>flour</span> or <span>sugar</span> or something,<br/>
🎧 make sure you let him know so he can put in an order.<br/>
🎧 OK, now the next <span>thing…<br/>
</span> <span><br/>

🎧 OK, <span>Stewart</span>. We need to start planning our <span>paper</span> on <span>public</span> <span>libraries</span>.<br/>
🎧 Have you thought of an <span>angle</span> yet?<br/>
🎧 Well, there's so much we could look into.<br/>
🎧 How <span>libraries</span> have <span>changed</span> over the <span>centuries</span>, for <span>instance</span>, <span>or..</span>.<br/>
🎧 how different <span>countries</span> <span>organise</span> them.<br/>
🎧 What do you think, <span>Trudie</span>?<br/>
🎧 Maybe we should <span>concentrate</span> on this <span>country</span>, and try and <span>relate</span> the changes in <span>libraries</span> to <span>external</span> <span>developments</span>,<br/>
🎧 like the <span>fact</span> that <span>far</span> more people can read than a <span>century</span> ago,<br/>
🎧 and that the <span>local</span> <span>population</span> may speak lots of different <span>languages</span>.<br/>
🎧 We could <span>include</span> something about changes in the <span>source</span> of <span>funding</span>, too.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but remember we're only <span>supposed</span> to <span>write</span> a short <span>paper</span>,<br/>
🎧 so it's probably best if we don't go into <span>funding</span> in any <span>detail</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Well, shall we just <span>brainstorm</span> a few <span>ideas</span>, to get <span>started</span>?<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 We <span>obviously</span> need to look at the <span>impact</span> of new <span>technology</span>, <span>particularly</span> the <span>internet</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now that lots of books have been <span>digitalised</span>, people can <span>access</span> them from their own <span>computers</span> at home.<br/>
🎧 And if everyone did that, <span>libraries</span> would be <span>obsolete</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 But the <span>digitalised</span> books that are <span>available</span> online for free are <span>mostly</span> out of <span>copyright</span>, aren't they?<br/>
🎧 And <span>copyright</span> in this <span>country</span> <span>lasts</span> for <span>70</span> years after the <span>author</span> <span>dies</span>.<br/>
🎧 So you won't find the <span>latest</span> <span>best-seller</span> or <span>up-to-date</span> <span>information</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's an important <span>point</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, I find it <span>hard</span> to <span>concentrate</span> when I'm <span>reading</span> a long <span>text</span> on a <span>screen</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd much rather read a <span>physical</span> book.<br/>
🎧 And it takes <span>longer</span> to read on a <span>screen</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I <span>prefer</span> it.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> it's just a personal <span>preference</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>expect</span> that <span>libraries</span> will go on <span>evolving</span> in the next few years.<br/>
🎧 Some have already become <span>centres</span> where <span>community</span> <span>activities</span> take place,<br/>
🎧 like <span>local</span> <span>clubs</span> <span>meeting</span> there.<br/>
🎧 I think <span>that'll</span> become even more <span>common</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to think so,<br/>
🎧 and that they'll still be <span>serving</span> their <span>traditional</span> <span>function</span>, but I'm not so sure.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>financial</span> <span>implications</span>, after all.<br/>
🎧 What I'm <span>afraid</span> will <span>happen</span> is that books and <span>magazines</span> will all <span>disappear</span>, and <span>there'll</span> just be <span>rows</span> and <span>rows</span> of <span>computers</span>.<br/>
🎧 They won't look anything like the <span>libraries</span> we're used to.<br/>
🎧 Well, we'll see.<br/>
🎧 I've just had an idea.<br/>
🎧 Why don't we make an <span>in-depth</span> <span>study</span> of our <span>local</span> <span>public</span> <span>library</span> as <span>background</span> to our <span>paper</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that'd be <span>interesting</span>, and <span>raise</span> all <span>sorts</span> of issues.<br/>
🎧 Let's make a <span>list</span> of <span>possible</span> things we could ask about,<br/>
🎧 then work out some <span>sort</span> of <span>structure</span>.<br/>
🎧 For <span>instance</span>, <span>um</span>, we could <span>interview</span> some of the <span>staff</span>,<br/>
🎧 and find out <span>whether</span> the <span>library</span> has its own <span>budget</span>, or if that's <span>controlled</span> by the <span>local</span> <span>council</span>.<br/>
🎧 And what their <span>policies</span> are.<br/>
🎧 I know they don't <span>allow</span> food,<br/>
🎧 but I'd love to find out what <span>types</span> of <span>noise</span> they ban <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 there always <span>seems</span> to be a lot of talking, but never music.<br/>
🎧 I don't know if that's a <span>policy</span> or it just <span>happens</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ah, I've often <span>wondered</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then there are things like how the <span>library</span> is <span>affected</span> by <span>employment</span> <span>laws</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> there are <span>rules</span> about working hours, <span>facilities</span> for <span>staff</span>, and so on.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Then there are other issues <span>relating</span> to the <span>design</span> of the <span>building</span> and how <span>customers</span> use it.<br/>
🎧 Like what <span>measures</span> does the <span>library</span> take to <span>ensure</span> their <span>safety</span>?<br/>
🎧 They'd need <span>floor</span> <span>coverings</span> that aren't <span>slippery</span>, and <span>emergency</span> <span>exits</span>, for <span>instance</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and another thing <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 there's the <span>question</span> of the kind of <span>insurance</span> the <span>library</span> needs to have, in case <span>anyone</span> <span>gets</span> <span>injured</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's something else to find out.<br/>
🎧 You know something I've often <span>wondered</span>?<br/>
🎧 What's that?<br/>
🎧 Well, you know <span>they've</span> got an <span>archive</span> of <span>local</span> <span>newspapers</span> going back years?<br/>
🎧 Well, next to it <span>they've</span> got the <span>diary</span> of a <span>well-known</span> <span>politician</span> from the <span>late</span> <span>19th</span> <span>century</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>wonder</span> why it's there.<br/>
🎧 Do you know what his <span>connection</span> was with this <span>area</span>?<br/>
🎧 No idea.<br/>
🎧 Let's add it to our <span>list</span> of things to find out.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I've just thought <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 you know people might ask in the <span>library</span> about <span>local</span> <span>organisations</span>, like <span>sports</span> <span>clubs</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I <span>wonder</span> if they keep a <span>database</span>, or <span>whether</span> they just look online.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I quite <span>fancy</span> <span>finding</span> out what the <span>differences</span> are between a <span>library</span> that's open to the <span>public<br/></span>
🎧 and one that's <span>part</span> of a <span>museum</span>, for example <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 they must be very different.<br/>
🎧 Then something else I'd like to know <span>is…<br/>
</span> <span><br/>

🎧 Today I'm going to talk about <span>four</span> of <span>them:<br/></span>
🎧 <span>collaboration</span>, <span>hard</span> work, <span>creativity</span> and <span>excellence</span>.<br/>
🎧 Most people would say they're all <span>'good</span> <span>things'</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm going to <span>suggest</span> that's an <span>over-simple</span> <span>view</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>trouble</span> with these <span>values</span> is that they're <span>theoretical</span> <span>concepts</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>removed</span> from the <span>reality</span> of <span>day-to-day</span> <span>business</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Pursue</span> <span>values</span> by all <span>means</span>,<br/>
🎧 but be <span>prepared</span> for what may <span>happen</span> as a <span>result</span>.<br/>
🎧 They can actually <span>cause</span> <span>damage</span>, which is not at all the <span>intention</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Business</span> <span>leaders</span> <span>generally</span> try to do the right thing.<br/>
🎧 But all too often the right thing <span>backfires</span>,<br/>
🎧 if those <span>leaders</span> <span>adopt</span> <span>values</span> without <span>understanding</span> and <span>managing</span> the side <span>effects</span> that <span>arise</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>values</span> can <span>easily</span> get in the way of what's actually <span>intended</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK. So the first <span>value</span> I'm going to <span>discuss</span> is <span>collaboration</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Er</span>, let me give you an example.<br/>
🎧 On a <span>management</span> <span>training</span> course I once <span>attended</span>,<br/>
🎧 we were put into <span>groups</span> and had to <span>construct</span> a <span>bridge</span> across a <span>stream</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>using</span> <span>building</span> <span>blocks</span> that we were <span>given</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>rule</span> was that everyone in the <span>team</span> had to move at <span>least</span> one <span>building</span> <span>block</span> during the <span>construction</span>.<br/>
🎧 This was <span>intended</span> to <span>encourage</span> <span>teamwork</span>.<br/>
🎧 But it was really a <span>job</span> best done by one person.<br/>
🎧 The other <span>teams</span> <span>tried</span> to <span>collaborate</span> on <span>building</span> the <span>structure</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>descended</span> into <span>confusion</span>, with everyone getting in each <span>other's</span> way.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>team</span> <span>leader</span> <span>solved</span> the <span>challenge</span> <span>brilliantly</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>simply</span> <span>asked</span> everyone in the <span>team</span> to move a <span>piece</span> a few <span>centimetres</span>, to <span>comply</span> with the <span>rule</span>,<br/>
🎧 and then let the person in the <span>team</span> with an <span>aptitude</span> for <span>puzzles</span> like this <span>build</span> it <span>alone</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>finished</span> before any other <span>team</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>point</span> is that the <span>task</span> wasn't really <span>suited</span> to <span>teamworking</span>,<br/>
🎧 so why make it one?<br/>
🎧 <span>Teamwork</span> can also <span>lead</span> to <span>inconsistency</span> <span>-</span> a <span>common</span> <span>cause</span> of <span>poor</span> <span>sales</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the case of a <span>smartphone</span> that a <span>certain</span> company <span>launched</span>,<br/>
🎧 one <span>director</span> wanted to <span>target</span> the <span>business</span> <span>market</span>,<br/>
🎧 and another <span>demanded</span> it was <span>aimed</span> at <span>consumers</span>.<br/>
🎧 The company wanted both <span>directors</span> to be <span>involved</span>,<br/>
🎧 so gave the product a <span>consumer-friendly</span> name,<br/>
🎧 but <span>marketed</span> it to <span>companies</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>result</span> was that it <span>met</span> the needs of <span>neither</span> group.<br/>
🎧 It would have been better to let one <span>director</span> or the other have his way,<br/>
🎧 not both.<br/>
🎧 Now <span>industriousness</span>, or <span>hard</span> work.<br/>
🎧 It's easy to <span>mock</span> people who say they work <span>hard:<br/></span>
🎧 after all, a <span>hamster</span> <span>running</span> around in a <span>wheel</span> is working <span>hard</span> <span>-</span> and getting <span>nowhere</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course <span>hard</span> work is <span>valuable</span>, but only when <span>properly</span> <span>targeted</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Otherwise</span> it <span>wastes</span> the <span>resources</span> that <span>companies</span> <span>value</span> <span>most:</span> time and <span>energy</span>.<br/>
🎧 And that's bad for the <span>organisation</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>management</span> <span>model</span> that <span>groups</span> people <span>according</span> to <span>four</span> <span>criteria:<br/></span>
🎧 <span>clever</span>, <span>hard-working</span>, <span>stupid</span> and <span>lazy</span>.<br/>
🎧 Here <span>'lazy'</span> <span>means</span> having a <span>rational</span> <span>determination</span> not to <span>carry</span> out <span>unnecessary</span> <span>tasks</span>.<br/>
🎧 It doesn't mean trying to <span>avoid</span> work <span>altogether</span>.<br/>
🎧 Most people <span>display</span> two of these <span>characteristics</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the most <span>valuable</span> people are those who are both <span>clever</span> and <span>lazy:<br/></span>
🎧 they <span>possess</span> <span>intellectual</span> <span>clarity</span>, and they don't <span>rush</span> into <span>making</span> <span>decisions</span>.<br/>
🎧 They come up with <span>solutions</span> to <span>save</span> the time and <span>energy</span> <span>spent</span> by the <span>stupid</span> and <span>hard-working</span> group.<br/>
🎧 <span>Instead</span> of <span>throwing</span> more <span>man-hours</span> at a <span>problem</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>clever</span> and <span>lazy</span> group looks for a more <span>effective</span> <span>solution</span>.<br/>
🎧 Next we come to <span>creativity</span>.<br/>
🎧 This often <span>works</span> well <span>-</span> <span>creating</span> an <span>attention-grabbing</span> <span>TV</span> <span>commercial</span>, for example,<br/>
🎧 might <span>lead</span> to <span>increased</span> <span>sales</span>.<br/>
🎧 But it isn't always a good thing.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>advertising</span> <span>campaigns</span> are <span>remembered</span> for their <span>creativity</span>,<br/>
🎧 without having any <span>effect</span> on <span>sales</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>happened</span> a few years ago with the <span>launch</span> of a <span>chocolate</span> <span>bar:<br/></span>
🎧 <span>subsequent</span> <span>research</span> <span>showed</span> that <span>plenty</span> of <span>consumers</span> <span>remembered</span> the <span>adverts</span>,<br/>
🎧 but had no idea what was being <span>advertised</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>trouble</span> is that the <span>creator</span> <span>derives</span> <span>pleasure</span> from <span>coming</span> up with the idea,<br/>
🎧 and <span>wrongly</span> <span>assumes</span> the <span>audience</span> for the <span>campaign</span> will share that feeling.<br/>
🎧 A company that <span>brings</span> out <span>thousands</span> of new <span>products</span> may <span>seem</span> more <span>creative</span> than a company that only has a few,<br/>
🎧 but it may be too <span>creative</span>, and make <span>smaller</span> <span>profits</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Creativity</span> needs to be <span>targeted</span>, to <span>solve</span> a <span>problem</span> that the company has <span>identified</span>.<br/>
🎧 Just <span>coming</span> up with more and more <span>novel</span> <span>products</span> isn't <span>necessarily</span> a good thing.<br/>
🎧 And finally, <span>excellence</span>.<br/>
🎧 We all know <span>companies</span> that <span>claim</span> they <span>'strive</span> for <span>excellence'</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it takes a long time to <span>achieve</span> <span>excellence</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>business</span>, being first with a product is more <span>profitable</span> than having the best product.<br/>
🎧 A <span>major</span> <span>study</span> of company <span>performance</span> <span>compared</span> <span>pioneers</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 that is, <span>companies</span> <span>bringing</span> out the first <span>version</span> of a <span>particular</span> product <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 with <span>followers</span>, the <span>companies</span> that <span>copied</span> and <span>improved</span> on that product.<br/>
🎧 The <span>study</span> <span>found</span> that the <span>pioneers</span> <span>commanded</span> an <span>average</span> <span>market</span> share of <span>29%</span>,<br/>
🎧 while the <span>followers</span> <span>achieved</span> less than <span>half</span> that, only <span>13%</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 even though their product might have been better.<br/>
🎧 <span>Insisting</span> on <span>excellence</span> in everything we do is <span>time-consuming</span>, <span>wastes</span> <span>energy<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>leads</span> to <span>losing</span> out on <span>opportunities</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes, <span>second-rate</span> work is more <span>worthwhile</span> than <span>excellence</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>'Make</span> sure it's <span>excellent'</span> sounds like a good <span>approach</span> to <span>business</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>'just-get-started'</span> <span>approach</span> is <span>likely</span> to be more <span>successful</span>.<br/>
