🎧 Hi. Can I help you?<br/>
🎧 I'd like to find out if you have any <span>excursions <span>suitable for <span>families.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 How about taking your <span>family for a <span>cruise?<br/>
🎧 We have a <span>steamship that takes <span>passengers out <span>several <span>times a day <span>-<br/>
🎧 it's over <span>100 years old.<br/>
🎧 That sounds <span>interesting.<br/>
🎧 How long is the <span>trip?<br/>
🎧 About an <span>hour and a <span>half.<br/>
🎧 And don't <span>forget to take <span>pictures of the <span>mountains.<br/>
🎧 They're all around you when you're on the <span>boat and they look <span>fantastic.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And I <span>assume there's a <span>café or something on <span>board?<br/>
🎧 Sure. How old are your children?<br/>
🎧 <span>Er, my <span>daughter's <span>fifteen and my <span>son's <span>seven.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Well, there are <span>various things you can do once you've <span>crossed the <span>lake, to make a day of it.<br/>
🎧 One thing that's very <span>popular is a visit to the <span>Country <span>Farm.<br/>
🎧 You're <span>met off the <span>boat by the <span>farmer and he'll take you to the <span>holding <span>pens, where the <span>sheep are <span>kept.<br/>
🎧 Children love <span>feeding them!<br/>
🎧 My son would love that.<br/>
🎧 He really likes <span>animals.<br/>
🎧 Well, there's also a <span>40-minute <span>trek <span>round the <span>farm on a <span>horse, if he <span>wants.<br/>
🎧 Do you think he'd <span>manage it?<br/>
🎧 He hasn't done that before.<br/>
🎧 Sure. It's <span>suitable for <span>complete <span>beginners.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 And again, <span>visitors are <span>welcome to <span>explore the <span>farm on their own,<br/>
🎧 as long as they take <span>care to <span>close <span>gates and so on.<br/>
🎧 There are some very <span>beautiful <span>gardens along the side of the <span>lake which also <span>belong to the <span>farm <span>-<br/>
🎧 they'll be just at their best now.<br/>
🎧 You could <span>easily <span>spend an <span>hour or two there.<br/>
🎧 OK. Well that all sounds good.<br/>
🎧 And can we get lunch there?<br/>
🎧 You can, and it's very good, though it's not <span>included in the <span>basic <span>cost.<br/>
🎧 You pay when you get there.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So is there anything else to do over on that side of the <span>lake?<br/>
🎧 Well, what you can do is take a <span>bike over on the <span>ship and then go on a <span>cycling <span>trip.<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>trail there called the Back <span>Road <span>-<br/>
🎧 you could <span>easily <span>spend <span>three or <span>four hours <span>exploring it,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>scenery's wonderful.<br/>
🎧 They'll give you a map when you get your <span>ticket for the <span>cruise <span>-<br/>
🎧 there's no <span>extra <span>charge.<br/>
🎧 What's the <span>trail like in <span>terms of <span>difficulty?<br/>
🎧 Quite <span>challenging in <span>places.<br/>
🎧 It wouldn't be <span>suitable for your <span>seven-year-old.<br/>
🎧 It needs <span>someone who's got a bit more <span>experience.<br/>
🎧 Well, my <span>daughter <span>loves <span>cycling and so do I, so maybe the two of us could go,<br/>
🎧 and my <span>wife and son could <span>stay on the <span>farm.<br/>
🎧 That might work out quite well.<br/>
🎧 But we don't have <span>bikes <span>here…<br/>
🎧 is there somewhere we could <span>rent them?<br/>
🎧 Yes, there's a place here in the <span>city.<br/>
🎧 It's called <span>Ratchesons.<br/>
🎧 I'll just make a <span>note of <span>that...<br/>
🎧 <span>er, how do you <span>spell it?<br/>
🎧 <span>RATCHESONS.<br/>
🎧 It's just by the <span>cruise <span>ship <span>terminal.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 You'd also need to <span>pick up a <span>repair <span>kit for the <span>bike from there to take along with you,<br/>
🎧 and you'd need to take along a <span>snack and some water <span>-<br/>
🎧 it'd be best to get those in the <span>city.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 That shouldn't be a <span>problem.<br/>
🎧 And I <span>assume I can <span>rent a <span>helmet from the <span>bike place?<br/>
🎧 Sure, you should definitely get that.<br/>
🎧 It's a great <span>ride, but you want to be well <span>prepared because it's very <span>remote <span>-<br/>
🎧 you won't see any <span>shops <span>round there, or <span>anywhere to <span>stay,<br/>
🎧 so you need to get back in time for the last <span>boat.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. So what <span>sort of <span>prices are we looking at here?<br/>
🎧 Let's see, that'd be one <span>adult and one <span>child for the <span>cruise with <span>farm <span>tour,<br/>
🎧 that's <span>$117<br/>
🎧 and an <span>adult and a <span>child for the <span>cruise only so that's <span>$214 <span>altogether.<br/>
🎧 Oh, wait a <span>minute,<br/>
🎧 how old did you say your <span>daughter was?<br/>
🎧 <span>Fifteen.<br/>
🎧 Then I'm <span>afraid it's <span>$267<br/>
🎧 because she has to pay the <span>adult <span>fare, which is <span>$75<br/>
🎧 <span>instead of the <span>child <span>fare which is <span>$22.<br/>
🎧 Sorry about that.<br/>
🎧 That's OK.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Good morning everyone.<br/>
🎧 My <span>name's <span>Joy <span>Parkins and I'm the <span>restaurant <span>manager.<br/>
🎧 And I <span>understand that <span>none of you've had any <span>previous <span>experience as <span>kitchen <span>assistants?<br/>
🎧 Well, you might be feeling a bit <span>nervous now,<br/>
🎧 but most of our <span>kitchen <span>assistants say they enjoy the work.<br/>
🎧 OK, they might get <span>shouted at sometimes, but it's <span>nothing personal,<br/>
🎧 and they're <span>pleased that they have so many different things to do, which <span>means they never get <span>bored.<br/>
🎧 And I'll tell you <span>straightaway that if you do well,<br/>
🎧 we might think about <span>moving you up and <span>giving you some more <span>responsibility.<br/>
🎧 Right, well, you've all <span>shown up on time, which is an <span>excellent start.<br/>
🎧 Now I'm glad to see <span>none of you have <span>unsuitable <span>footwear, so that's good <span>-<br/>
🎧 you need to be <span>careful as the <span>floors can get very wet and <span>slippery.<br/>
🎧 Those of you with long <span>hair have got it well out of the way,<br/>
🎧 but some of you'll need to <span>remove your <span>rings and <span>bracelets <span>- just put them somewhere <span>safe for today,<br/>
🎧 and remember to leave them at home <span>tomorrow, as they can be a <span>safety <span>hazard.<br/>
🎧 Now it's going to be a <span>busy day for you all today <span>-<br/>
🎧 we don't have any <span>tables free for this <span>evening,<br/>
🎧 and only a few for lunch.<br/>
🎧 <span>Fortunately we've got our <span>Head <span>Chef back <span>-<br/>
🎧 he was away on <span>holiday all last week which <span>meant the other <span>chefs had <span>extra work.<br/>
🎧 Now, I'll tell you a bit more about the <span>job in a <span>minute<br/>
🎧 but first, some <span>general <span>regulations.<br/>
🎧 For all of you, whatever your age,<br/>
🎧 there's some <span>equipment you mustn't use until you've been <span>properly <span>trained,<br/>
🎧 like the <span>waste <span>disposal <span>system for example,<br/>
🎧 for <span>health and <span>safety <span>reasons.<br/>
🎧 Then I think there are two of you here who are under <span>18 <span>-<br/>
🎧 that's <span>Emma and <span>Jake, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Right, so for you two, the <span>meat <span>slicer is out of <span>bounds.<br/>
🎧 And of course <span>none of you are <span>allowed to use the <span>electric <span>mixer<br/>
🎧 until you've been <span>shown how it <span>works.<br/>
🎧 Now you may have heard that this can be a <span>stressful <span>job,<br/>
🎧 and I have to say that can be <span>true.<br/>
🎧 You'll be working an <span>eight-hour day for the first week,<br/>
🎧 though you'll have the <span>chance to do <span>overtime after that as well if you want to.<br/>
🎧 But <span>however long the hours are, you'll get a <span>break in the <span>middle.<br/>
🎧 What you will find is that you're on your <span>feet all day long, <span>lifting and <span>carrying,<br/>
🎧 so if you're not fit now you soon will be!<br/>
🎧 You'll find you don't have much <span>chance to take it easy <span>-<br/>
🎧 when <span>someone tells you to do something you need to do it <span>straightaway <span>-<br/>
🎧 but at <span>least we do have a very <span>efficient air <span>conditioning <span>system <span>compared with some <span>kitchens.<br/>
🎧 Now let me tell you about some of the people you need to know.<br/>
🎧 So as I said, I'm <span>Joy <span>Parkins<br/>
🎧 and I decide who does what during the day and how long they work for.<br/>
🎧 I'll be trying to get you to work with as many different people in the <span>kitchen as <span>possible,<br/>
🎧 so that you learn while you're on the <span>job.<br/>
🎧 One person whose name you must remember is <span>David <span>Field.<br/>
🎧 If you <span>injure yourself at all, even if it's really <span>minor,<br/>
🎧 you must <span>report to him and he'll make sure the <span>incident is <span>recorded<br/>
🎧 and you get the <span>appropriate <span>treatment.<br/>
🎧 He's <span>trained to give <span>basic <span>treatment to <span>staff <span>himself,<br/>
🎧 or he'll <span>send you off somewhere else if <span>necessary.<br/>
🎧 Then there's <span>Dexter <span>Wills <span>-<br/>
🎧 he's the person you need to see if you <span>smash a <span>plate or something like that.<br/>
🎧 Don't just leave it and hope no one will <span>notice <span>-<br/>
🎧 it's really important to get things <span>noted and <span>replaced or there could be <span>problems later.<br/>
🎧 And finally, there's <span>Mike <span>Smith.<br/>
🎧 He's the <span>member of <span>staff who takes <span>care of all the <span>stores of <span>perishables,<br/>
🎧 so if you <span>notice we're getting low in <span>flour or <span>sugar or something,<br/>
🎧 make sure you let him know so he can put in an order.<br/>
🎧 OK, now the next <span>thing…<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 OK, <span>Stewart. We need to start planning our <span>paper on <span>public <span>libraries.<br/>
🎧 Have you thought of an <span>angle yet?<br/>
🎧 Well, there's so much we could look into.<br/>
🎧 How <span>libraries have <span>changed over the <span>centuries, for <span>instance, <span>or...<br/>
🎧 how different <span>countries <span>organise them.<br/>
🎧 What do you think, <span>Trudie?<br/>
🎧 Maybe we should <span>concentrate on this <span>country, and try and <span>relate the changes in <span>libraries to <span>external <span>developments,<br/>
🎧 like the <span>fact that <span>far more people can read than a <span>century ago,<br/>
🎧 and that the <span>local <span>population may speak lots of different <span>languages.<br/>
🎧 We could <span>include something about changes in the <span>source of <span>funding, too.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but remember we're only <span>supposed to <span>write a short <span>paper,<br/>
🎧 so it's probably best if we don't go into <span>funding in any <span>detail.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Well, shall we just <span>brainstorm a few <span>ideas, to get <span>started?<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 We <span>obviously need to look at the <span>impact of new <span>technology, <span>particularly the <span>internet.<br/>
🎧 Now that lots of books have been <span>digitalised, people can <span>access them from their own <span>computers at home.<br/>
🎧 And if everyone did that, <span>libraries would be <span>obsolete.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 But the <span>digitalised books that are <span>available online for free are <span>mostly out of <span>copyright, aren't they?<br/>
🎧 And <span>copyright in this <span>country <span>lasts for <span>70 years after the <span>author <span>dies.<br/>
🎧 So you won't find the <span>latest <span>best-seller or <span>up-to-date <span>information.<br/>
🎧 That's an important <span>point.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway, I find it <span>hard to <span>concentrate when I'm <span>reading a long <span>text on a <span>screen.<br/>
🎧 I'd much rather read a <span>physical book.<br/>
🎧 And it takes <span>longer to read on a <span>screen.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I <span>prefer it.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose it's just a personal <span>preference.<br/>
🎧 I <span>expect that <span>libraries will go on <span>evolving in the next few years.<br/>
🎧 Some have already become <span>centres where <span>community <span>activities take place,<br/>
🎧 like <span>local <span>clubs <span>meeting there.<br/>
🎧 I think <span>that'll become even more <span>common.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to think so,<br/>
🎧 and that they'll still be <span>serving their <span>traditional <span>function, but I'm not so sure.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>financial <span>implications, after all.<br/>
🎧 What I'm <span>afraid will <span>happen is that books and <span>magazines will all <span>disappear, and <span>there'll just be <span>rows and <span>rows of <span>computers.<br/>
🎧 They won't look anything like the <span>libraries we're used to.<br/>
🎧 Well, we'll see.<br/>
🎧 I've just had an idea.<br/>
🎧 Why don't we make an <span>in-depth <span>study of our <span>local <span>public <span>library as <span>background to our <span>paper?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that'd be <span>interesting, and <span>raise all <span>sorts of issues.<br/>
🎧 Let's make a <span>list of <span>possible things we could ask about,<br/>
🎧 then work out some <span>sort of <span>structure.<br/>
🎧 For <span>instance, <span>um, we could <span>interview some of the <span>staff,<br/>
🎧 and find out <span>whether the <span>library has its own <span>budget, or if that's <span>controlled by the <span>local <span>council.<br/>
🎧 And what their <span>policies are.<br/>
🎧 I know they don't <span>allow food,<br/>
🎧 but I'd love to find out what <span>types of <span>noise they ban <span>-<br/>
🎧 there always <span>seems to be a lot of talking, but never music.<br/>
🎧 I don't know if that's a <span>policy or it just <span>happens.<br/>
🎧 Ah, I've often <span>wondered.<br/>
🎧 Then there are things like how the <span>library is <span>affected by <span>employment <span>laws.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose there are <span>rules about working hours, <span>facilities for <span>staff, and so on.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Then there are other issues <span>relating to the <span>design of the <span>building and how <span>customers use it.<br/>
🎧 Like what <span>measures does the <span>library take to <span>ensure their <span>safety?<br/>
🎧 They'd need <span>floor <span>coverings that aren't <span>slippery, and <span>emergency <span>exits, for <span>instance.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and another thing <span>-<br/>
🎧 there's the <span>question of the kind of <span>insurance the <span>library needs to have, in case <span>anyone <span>gets <span>injured.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's something else to find out.<br/>
🎧 You know something I've often <span>wondered?<br/>
🎧 What's that?<br/>
🎧 Well, you know <span>they've got an <span>archive of <span>local <span>newspapers going back years?<br/>
🎧 Well, next to it <span>they've got the <span>diary of a <span>well-known <span>politician from the <span>late <span>19th <span>century.<br/>
🎧 I <span>wonder why it's there.<br/>
🎧 Do you know what his <span>connection was with this <span>area?<br/>
🎧 No idea.<br/>
🎧 Let's add it to our <span>list of things to find out.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I've just thought <span>-<br/>
🎧 you know people might ask in the <span>library about <span>local <span>organisations, like <span>sports <span>clubs?<br/>
🎧 Well, I <span>wonder if they keep a <span>database, or <span>whether they just look online.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I quite <span>fancy <span>finding out what the <span>differences are between a <span>library that's open to the <span>public<br/>
🎧 and one that's <span>part of a <span>museum, for example <span>-<br/>
🎧 they must be very different.<br/>
🎧 Then something else I'd like to know <span>is…<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 In <span>public <span>discussion of <span>business, we take <span>certain <span>values for <span>granted.<br/>
🎧 Today I'm going to talk about <span>four of <span>them:<br/>
🎧 <span>collaboration, <span>hard work, <span>creativity and <span>excellence.<br/>
🎧 Most people would say they're all <span>'good <span>things'.<br/>
🎧 I'm going to <span>suggest that's an <span>over-simple <span>view.<br/>
🎧 The <span>trouble with these <span>values is that they're <span>theoretical <span>concepts,<br/>
🎧 <span>removed from the <span>reality of <span>day-to-day <span>business.<br/>
🎧 <span>Pursue <span>values by all <span>means,<br/>
🎧 but be <span>prepared for what may <span>happen as a <span>result.<br/>
🎧 They can actually <span>cause <span>damage, which is not at all the <span>intention.<br/>
🎧 <span>Business <span>leaders <span>generally try to do the right thing.<br/>
🎧 But all too often the right thing <span>backfires,<br/>
🎧 if those <span>leaders <span>adopt <span>values without <span>understanding and <span>managing the side <span>effects that <span>arise.<br/>
🎧 The <span>values can <span>easily get in the way of what's actually <span>intended.<br/>
🎧 OK. So the first <span>value I'm going to <span>discuss is <span>collaboration.<br/>
🎧 <span>Er, let me give you an example.<br/>
🎧 On a <span>management <span>training course I once <span>attended,<br/>
🎧 we were put into <span>groups and had to <span>construct a <span>bridge across a <span>stream,<br/>
🎧 <span>using <span>building <span>blocks that we were <span>given.<br/>
🎧 The <span>rule was that everyone in the <span>team had to move at <span>least one <span>building <span>block during the <span>construction.<br/>
🎧 This was <span>intended to <span>encourage <span>teamwork.<br/>
🎧 But it was really a <span>job best done by one person.<br/>
🎧 The other <span>teams <span>tried to <span>collaborate on <span>building the <span>structure,<br/>
🎧 and <span>descended into <span>confusion, with everyone getting in each <span>other's way.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>team <span>leader <span>solved the <span>challenge <span>brilliantly.<br/>
🎧 She <span>simply <span>asked everyone in the <span>team to move a <span>piece a few <span>centimetres, to <span>comply with the <span>rule,<br/>
🎧 and then let the person in the <span>team with an <span>aptitude for <span>puzzles like this <span>build it <span>alone.<br/>
🎧 We <span>finished before any other <span>team.<br/>
🎧 My <span>point is that the <span>task wasn't really <span>suited to <span>teamworking,<br/>
🎧 so why make it one?<br/>
🎧 <span>Teamwork can also <span>lead to <span>inconsistency <span>- a <span>common <span>cause of <span>poor <span>sales.<br/>
🎧 In the case of a <span>smartphone that a <span>certain company <span>launched,<br/>
🎧 one <span>director wanted to <span>target the <span>business <span>market,<br/>
🎧 and another <span>demanded it was <span>aimed at <span>consumers.<br/>
🎧 The company wanted both <span>directors to be <span>involved,<br/>
🎧 so gave the product a <span>consumer-friendly name,<br/>
🎧 but <span>marketed it to <span>companies.<br/>
🎧 The <span>result was that it <span>met the needs of <span>neither group.<br/>
🎧 It would have been better to let one <span>director or the other have his way,<br/>
🎧 not both.<br/>
🎧 Now <span>industriousness, or <span>hard work.<br/>
🎧 It's easy to <span>mock people who say they work <span>hard:<br/>
🎧 after all, a <span>hamster <span>running around in a <span>wheel is working <span>hard <span>- and getting <span>nowhere.<br/>
🎧 Of course <span>hard work is <span>valuable, but only when <span>properly <span>targeted.<br/>
🎧 <span>Otherwise it <span>wastes the <span>resources that <span>companies <span>value <span>most: time and <span>energy.<br/>
🎧 And that's bad for the <span>organisation.<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>management <span>model that <span>groups people <span>according to <span>four <span>criteria:<br/>
🎧 <span>clever, <span>hard-working, <span>stupid and <span>lazy.<br/>
🎧 Here <span>'lazy' <span>means having a <span>rational <span>determination not to <span>carry out <span>unnecessary <span>tasks.<br/>
🎧 It doesn't mean trying to <span>avoid work <span>altogether.<br/>
🎧 Most people <span>display two of these <span>characteristics,<br/>
🎧 and the most <span>valuable people are those who are both <span>clever and <span>lazy:<br/>
🎧 they <span>possess <span>intellectual <span>clarity, and they don't <span>rush into <span>making <span>decisions.<br/>
🎧 They come up with <span>solutions to <span>save the time and <span>energy <span>spent by the <span>stupid and <span>hard-working group.<br/>
🎧 <span>Instead of <span>throwing more <span>man-hours at a <span>problem,<br/>
🎧 the <span>clever and <span>lazy group looks for a more <span>effective <span>solution.<br/>
🎧 Next we come to <span>creativity.<br/>
🎧 This often <span>works well <span>- <span>creating an <span>attention-grabbing <span>TV <span>commercial, for example,<br/>
🎧 might <span>lead to <span>increased <span>sales.<br/>
🎧 But it isn't always a good thing.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>advertising <span>campaigns are <span>remembered for their <span>creativity,<br/>
🎧 without having any <span>effect on <span>sales.<br/>
🎧 This <span>happened a few years ago with the <span>launch of a <span>chocolate <span>bar:<br/>
🎧 <span>subsequent <span>research <span>showed that <span>plenty of <span>consumers <span>remembered the <span>adverts,<br/>
🎧 but had no idea what was being <span>advertised.<br/>
🎧 The <span>trouble is that the <span>creator <span>derives <span>pleasure from <span>coming up with the idea,<br/>
🎧 and <span>wrongly <span>assumes the <span>audience for the <span>campaign will share that feeling.<br/>
🎧 A company that <span>brings out <span>thousands of new <span>products may <span>seem more <span>creative than a company that only has a few,<br/>
🎧 but it may be too <span>creative, and make <span>smaller <span>profits.<br/>
🎧 <span>Creativity needs to be <span>targeted, to <span>solve a <span>problem that the company has <span>identified.<br/>
🎧 Just <span>coming up with more and more <span>novel <span>products isn't <span>necessarily a good thing.<br/>
🎧 And finally, <span>excellence.<br/>
🎧 We all know <span>companies that <span>claim they <span>'strive for <span>excellence',<br/>
🎧 but it takes a long time to <span>achieve <span>excellence.<br/>
🎧 In <span>business, being first with a product is more <span>profitable than having the best product.<br/>
🎧 A <span>major <span>study of company <span>performance <span>compared <span>pioneers <span>-<br/>
🎧 that is, <span>companies <span>bringing out the first <span>version of a <span>particular product <span>-<br/>
🎧 with <span>followers, the <span>companies that <span>copied and <span>improved on that product.<br/>
🎧 The <span>study <span>found that the <span>pioneers <span>commanded an <span>average <span>market share of <span>29%,<br/>
🎧 while the <span>followers <span>achieved less than <span>half that, only <span>13% <span>-<br/>
🎧 even though their product might have been better.<br/>
🎧 <span>Insisting on <span>excellence in everything we do is <span>time-consuming, <span>wastes <span>energy<br/>
🎧 and <span>leads to <span>losing out on <span>opportunities.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes, <span>second-rate work is more <span>worthwhile than <span>excellence.<br/>
🎧 <span>'Make sure it's <span>excellent' sounds like a good <span>approach to <span>business,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>'just-get-started' <span>approach is <span>likely to be more <span>successful.<br/>
