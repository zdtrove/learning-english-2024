🎧 Hi. Can I help you?<br/>
🎧 I'd like to find out if you have any excursions suitable for families.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 How about taking your family for a cruise?<br/>
🎧 We have a steamship that takes passengers out several times a day -<br/>
🎧 it's over 100 years old.<br/>
🎧 That sounds interesting.<br/>
🎧 How long is the trip?<br/>
🎧 About an hour and a half.<br/>
🎧 And don't forget to take pictures of the mountains.<br/>
🎧 They're all around you when you're on the boat and they look fantastic.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And I assume there's a café or something on board?<br/>
🎧 Sure. How old are your children?<br/>
🎧 Er, my daughter's fifteen and my son's seven.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Well, there are various things you can do once you've crossed the lake, to make a day of it.<br/>
🎧 One thing that's very popular is a visit to the Country Farm.<br/>
🎧 You're met off the boat by the farmer and he'll take you to the holding pens, where the sheep are kept.<br/>
🎧 Children love feeding them!<br/>
🎧 My son would love that.<br/>
🎧 He really likes animals.<br/>
🎧 Well, there's also a 40-minute trek round the farm on a horse, if he wants.<br/>
🎧 Do you think he'd manage it?<br/>
🎧 He hasn't done that before.<br/>
🎧 Sure. It's suitable for complete beginners.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 And again, visitors are welcome to explore the farm on their own,<br/>
🎧 as long as they take care to close gates and so on.<br/>
🎧 There are some very beautiful gardens along the side of the lake which also belong to the farm -<br/>
🎧 they'll be just at their best now.<br/>
🎧 You could easily spend an hour or two there.<br/>
🎧 OK. Well that all sounds good.<br/>
🎧 And can we get lunch there?<br/>
🎧 You can, and it's very good, though it's not included in the basic cost.<br/>
🎧 You pay when you get there.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So is there anything else to do over on that side of the lake?<br/>
🎧 Well, what you can do is take a bike over on the ship and then go on a cycling trip.<br/>
🎧 There's a trail there called the Back Road -<br/>
🎧 you could easily spend three or four hours exploring it,<br/>
🎧 and the scenery's wonderful.<br/>
🎧 They'll give you a map when you get your ticket for the cruise -<br/>
🎧 there's no extra charge.<br/>
🎧 What's the trail like in terms of difficulty?<br/>
🎧 Quite challenging in places.<br/>
🎧 It wouldn't be suitable for your seven-year-old.<br/>
🎧 It needs someone who's got a bit more experience.<br/>
🎧 Well, my daughter loves cycling and so do I, so maybe the two of us could go,<br/>
🎧 and my wife and son could stay on the farm.<br/>
🎧 That might work out quite well.<br/>
🎧 But we don't have bikes here…<br/>
🎧 is there somewhere we could rent them?<br/>
🎧 Yes, there's a place here in the city.<br/>
🎧 It's called Ratchesons.<br/>
🎧 I'll just make a note of that...<br/>
🎧 er, how do you spell it?<br/>
🎧 RATCHESONS.<br/>
🎧 It's just by the cruise ship terminal.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 You'd also need to pick up a repair kit for the bike from there to take along with you,<br/>
🎧 and you'd need to take along a snack and some water -<br/>
🎧 it'd be best to get those in the city.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 That shouldn't be a problem.<br/>
🎧 And I assume I can rent a helmet from the bike place?<br/>
🎧 Sure, you should definitely get that.<br/>
🎧 It's a great ride, but you want to be well prepared because it's very remote -<br/>
🎧 you won't see any shops round there, or anywhere to stay,<br/>
🎧 so you need to get back in time for the last boat.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. So what sort of prices are we looking at here?<br/>
🎧 Let's see, that'd be one adult and one child for the cruise with farm tour,<br/>
🎧 that's $117<br/>
🎧 and an adult and a child for the cruise only so that's $214 altogether.<br/>
🎧 Oh, wait a minute,<br/>
🎧 how old did you say your daughter was?<br/>
🎧 Fifteen.<br/>
🎧 Then I'm afraid it's $267<br/>
🎧 because she has to pay the adult fare, which is $75<br/>
🎧 instead of the child fare which is $22.<br/>
🎧 Sorry about that.<br/>
🎧 That's OK.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Good morning everyone.<br/>
🎧 My name's Joy Parkins and I'm the restaurant manager.<br/>
🎧 And I understand that none of you've had any previous experience as kitchen assistants?<br/>
🎧 Well, you might be feeling a bit nervous now,<br/>
🎧 but most of our kitchen assistants say they enjoy the work.<br/>
🎧 OK, they might get shouted at sometimes, but it's nothing personal,<br/>
🎧 and they're pleased that they have so many different things to do, which means they never get bored.<br/>
🎧 And I'll tell you straightaway that if you do well,<br/>
🎧 we might think about moving you up and giving you some more responsibility.<br/>
🎧 Right, well, you've all shown up on time, which is an excellent start.<br/>
🎧 Now I'm glad to see none of you have unsuitable footwear, so that's good -<br/>
🎧 you need to be careful as the floors can get very wet and slippery.<br/>
🎧 Those of you with long hair have got it well out of the way,<br/>
🎧 but some of you'll need to remove your rings and bracelets - just put them somewhere safe for today,<br/>
🎧 and remember to leave them at home tomorrow, as they can be a safety hazard.<br/>
🎧 Now it's going to be a busy day for you all today -<br/>
🎧 we don't have any tables free for this evening,<br/>
🎧 and only a few for lunch.<br/>
🎧 Fortunately we've got our Head Chef back -<br/>
🎧 he was away on holiday all last week which meant the other chefs had extra work.<br/>
🎧 Now, I'll tell you a bit more about the job in a minute<br/>
🎧 but first, some general regulations.<br/>
🎧 For all of you, whatever your age,<br/>
🎧 there's some equipment you mustn't use until you've been properly trained,<br/>
🎧 like the waste disposal system for example,<br/>
🎧 for health and safety reasons.<br/>
🎧 Then I think there are two of you here who are under 18 -<br/>
🎧 that's Emma and Jake, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Right, so for you two, the meat slicer is out of bounds.<br/>
🎧 And of course none of you are allowed to use the electric mixer<br/>
🎧 until you've been shown how it works.<br/>
🎧 Now you may have heard that this can be a stressful job,<br/>
🎧 and I have to say that can be true.<br/>
🎧 You'll be working an eight-hour day for the first week,<br/>
🎧 though you'll have the chance to do overtime after that as well if you want to.<br/>
🎧 But however long the hours are, you'll get a break in the middle.<br/>
🎧 What you will find is that you're on your feet all day long, lifting and carrying,<br/>
🎧 so if you're not fit now you soon will be!<br/>
🎧 You'll find you don't have much chance to take it easy -<br/>
🎧 when someone tells you to do something you need to do it straightaway -<br/>
🎧 but at least we do have a very efficient air conditioning system compared with some kitchens.<br/>
🎧 Now let me tell you about some of the people you need to know.<br/>
🎧 So as I said, I'm Joy Parkins<br/>
🎧 and I decide who does what during the day and how long they work for.<br/>
🎧 I'll be trying to get you to work with as many different people in the kitchen as possible,<br/>
🎧 so that you learn while you're on the job.<br/>
🎧 One person whose name you must remember is David Field.<br/>
🎧 If you injure yourself at all, even if it's really minor,<br/>
🎧 you must report to him and he'll make sure the incident is recorded<br/>
🎧 and you get the appropriate treatment.<br/>
🎧 He's trained to give basic treatment to staff himself,<br/>
🎧 or he'll send you off somewhere else if necessary.<br/>
🎧 Then there's Dexter Wills -<br/>
🎧 he's the person you need to see if you smash a plate or something like that.<br/>
🎧 Don't just leave it and hope no one will notice -<br/>
🎧 it's really important to get things noted and replaced or there could be problems later.<br/>
🎧 And finally, there's Mike Smith.<br/>
🎧 He's the member of staff who takes care of all the stores of perishables,<br/>
🎧 so if you notice we're getting low in flour or sugar or something,<br/>
🎧 make sure you let him know so he can put in an order.<br/>
🎧 OK, now the next thing…<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 OK, Stewart. We need to start planning our paper on public libraries.<br/>
🎧 Have you thought of an angle yet?<br/>
🎧 Well, there's so much we could look into.<br/>
🎧 How libraries have changed over the centuries, for instance, or...<br/>
🎧 how different countries organise them.<br/>
🎧 What do you think, Trudie?<br/>
🎧 Maybe we should concentrate on this country, and try and relate the changes in libraries to external developments,<br/>
🎧 like the fact that far more people can read than a century ago,<br/>
🎧 and that the local population may speak lots of different languages.<br/>
🎧 We could include something about changes in the source of funding, too.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but remember we're only supposed to write a short paper,<br/>
🎧 so it's probably best if we don't go into funding in any detail.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Well, shall we just brainstorm a few ideas, to get started?<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 We obviously need to look at the impact of new technology, particularly the internet.<br/>
🎧 Now that lots of books have been digitalised, people can access them from their own computers at home.<br/>
🎧 And if everyone did that, libraries would be obsolete.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 But the digitalised books that are available online for free are mostly out of copyright, aren't they?<br/>
🎧 And copyright in this country lasts for 70 years after the author dies.<br/>
🎧 So you won't find the latest best-seller or up-to-date information.<br/>
🎧 That's an important point.<br/>
🎧 Anyway, I find it hard to concentrate when I'm reading a long text on a screen.<br/>
🎧 I'd much rather read a physical book.<br/>
🎧 And it takes longer to read on a screen.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I prefer it.<br/>
🎧 I suppose it's just a personal preference.<br/>
🎧 I expect that libraries will go on evolving in the next few years.<br/>
🎧 Some have already become centres where community activities take place,<br/>
🎧 like local clubs meeting there.<br/>
🎧 I think that'll become even more common.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to think so,<br/>
🎧 and that they'll still be serving their traditional function, but I'm not so sure.<br/>
🎧 There are financial implications, after all.<br/>
🎧 What I'm afraid will happen is that books and magazines will all disappear, and there'll just be rows and rows of computers.<br/>
🎧 They won't look anything like the libraries we're used to.<br/>
🎧 Well, we'll see.<br/>
🎧 I've just had an idea.<br/>
🎧 Why don't we make an in-depth study of our local public library as background to our paper?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that'd be interesting, and raise all sorts of issues.<br/>
🎧 Let's make a list of possible things we could ask about,<br/>
🎧 then work out some sort of structure.<br/>
🎧 For instance, um, we could interview some of the staff,<br/>
🎧 and find out whether the library has its own budget, or if that's controlled by the local council.<br/>
🎧 And what their policies are.<br/>
🎧 I know they don't allow food,<br/>
🎧 but I'd love to find out what types of noise they ban -<br/>
🎧 there always seems to be a lot of talking, but never music.<br/>
🎧 I don't know if that's a policy or it just happens.<br/>
🎧 Ah, I've often wondered.<br/>
🎧 Then there are things like how the library is affected by employment laws.<br/>
🎧 I suppose there are rules about working hours, facilities for staff, and so on.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Then there are other issues relating to the design of the building and how customers use it.<br/>
🎧 Like what measures does the library take to ensure their safety?<br/>
🎧 They'd need floor coverings that aren't slippery, and emergency exits, for instance.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and another thing -<br/>
🎧 there's the question of the kind of insurance the library needs to have, in case anyone gets injured.<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's something else to find out.<br/>
🎧 You know something I've often wondered?<br/>
🎧 What's that?<br/>
🎧 Well, you know they've got an archive of local newspapers going back years?<br/>
🎧 Well, next to it they've got the diary of a well-known politician from the late 19th century.<br/>
🎧 I wonder why it's there.<br/>
🎧 Do you know what his connection was with this area?<br/>
🎧 No idea.<br/>
🎧 Let's add it to our list of things to find out.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I've just thought -<br/>
🎧 you know people might ask in the library about local organisations, like sports clubs?<br/>
🎧 Well, I wonder if they keep a database, or whether they just look online.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I quite fancy finding out what the differences are between a library that's open to the public<br/>
🎧 and one that's part of a museum, for example -<br/>
🎧 they must be very different.<br/>
🎧 Then something else I'd like to know is…<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 In public discussion of business, we take certain values for granted.<br/>
🎧 Today I'm going to talk about four of them:<br/>
🎧 collaboration, hard work, creativity and excellence.<br/>
🎧 Most people would say they're all 'good things'.<br/>
🎧 I'm going to suggest that's an over-simple view.<br/>
🎧 The trouble with these values is that they're theoretical concepts,<br/>
🎧 removed from the reality of day-to-day business.<br/>
🎧 Pursue values by all means,<br/>
🎧 but be prepared for what may happen as a result.<br/>
🎧 They can actually cause damage, which is not at all the intention.<br/>
🎧 Business leaders generally try to do the right thing.<br/>
🎧 But all too often the right thing backfires,<br/>
🎧 if those leaders adopt values without understanding and managing the side effects that arise.<br/>
🎧 The values can easily get in the way of what's actually intended.<br/>
🎧 OK. So the first value I'm going to discuss is collaboration.<br/>
🎧 Er, let me give you an example.<br/>
🎧 On a management training course I once attended,<br/>
🎧 we were put into groups and had to construct a bridge across a stream,<br/>
🎧 using building blocks that we were given.<br/>
🎧 The rule was that everyone in the team had to move at least one building block during the construction.<br/>
🎧 This was intended to encourage teamwork.<br/>
🎧 But it was really a job best done by one person.<br/>
🎧 The other teams tried to collaborate on building the structure,<br/>
🎧 and descended into confusion, with everyone getting in each other's way.<br/>
🎧 Our team leader solved the challenge brilliantly.<br/>
🎧 She simply asked everyone in the team to move a piece a few centimetres, to comply with the rule,<br/>
🎧 and then let the person in the team with an aptitude for puzzles like this build it alone.<br/>
🎧 We finished before any other team.<br/>
🎧 My point is that the task wasn't really suited to teamworking,<br/>
🎧 so why make it one?<br/>
🎧 Teamwork can also lead to inconsistency - a common cause of poor sales.<br/>
🎧 In the case of a smartphone that a certain company launched,<br/>
🎧 one director wanted to target the business market,<br/>
🎧 and another demanded it was aimed at consumers.<br/>
🎧 The company wanted both directors to be involved,<br/>
🎧 so gave the product a consumer-friendly name,<br/>
🎧 but marketed it to companies.<br/>
🎧 The result was that it met the needs of neither group.<br/>
🎧 It would have been better to let one director or the other have his way,<br/>
🎧 not both.<br/>
🎧 Now industriousness, or hard work.<br/>
🎧 It's easy to mock people who say they work hard:<br/>
🎧 after all, a hamster running around in a wheel is working hard - and getting nowhere.<br/>
🎧 Of course hard work is valuable, but only when properly targeted.<br/>
🎧 Otherwise it wastes the resources that companies value most: time and energy.<br/>
🎧 And that's bad for the organisation.<br/>
🎧 There's a management model that groups people according to four criteria:<br/>
🎧 clever, hard-working, stupid and lazy.<br/>
🎧 Here 'lazy' means having a rational determination not to carry out unnecessary tasks.<br/>
🎧 It doesn't mean trying to avoid work altogether.<br/>
🎧 Most people display two of these characteristics,<br/>
🎧 and the most valuable people are those who are both clever and lazy:<br/>
🎧 they possess intellectual clarity, and they don't rush into making decisions.<br/>
🎧 They come up with solutions to save the time and energy spent by the stupid and hard-working group.<br/>
🎧 Instead of throwing more man-hours at a problem,<br/>
🎧 the clever and lazy group looks for a more effective solution.<br/>
🎧 Next we come to creativity.<br/>
🎧 This often works well - creating an attention-grabbing TV commercial, for example,<br/>
🎧 might lead to increased sales.<br/>
🎧 But it isn't always a good thing.<br/>
🎧 Some advertising campaigns are remembered for their creativity,<br/>
🎧 without having any effect on sales.<br/>
🎧 This happened a few years ago with the launch of a chocolate bar:<br/>
🎧 subsequent research showed that plenty of consumers remembered the adverts,<br/>
🎧 but had no idea what was being advertised.<br/>
🎧 The trouble is that the creator derives pleasure from coming up with the idea,<br/>
🎧 and wrongly assumes the audience for the campaign will share that feeling.<br/>
🎧 A company that brings out thousands of new products may seem more creative than a company that only has a few,<br/>
🎧 but it may be too creative, and make smaller profits.<br/>
🎧 Creativity needs to be targeted, to solve a problem that the company has identified.<br/>
🎧 Just coming up with more and more novel products isn't necessarily a good thing.<br/>
🎧 And finally, excellence.<br/>
🎧 We all know companies that claim they 'strive for excellence',<br/>
🎧 but it takes a long time to achieve excellence.<br/>
🎧 In business, being first with a product is more profitable than having the best product.<br/>
🎧 A major study of company performance compared pioneers -<br/>
🎧 that is, companies bringing out the first version of a particular product -<br/>
🎧 with followers, the companies that copied and improved on that product.<br/>
🎧 The study found that the pioneers commanded an average market share of 29%,<br/>
🎧 while the followers achieved less than half that, only 13% -<br/>
🎧 even though their product might have been better.<br/>
🎧 Insisting on excellence in everything we do is time-consuming, wastes energy<br/>
🎧 and leads to losing out on opportunities.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes, second-rate work is more worthwhile than excellence.<br/>
🎧 'Make sure it's excellent' sounds like a good approach to business,<br/>
🎧 but the 'just-get-started' approach is likely to be more successful.<br/>
<br/><br/>
