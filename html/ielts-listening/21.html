🎧 Hi, <span>George</span>!<br/>
🎧 Glad you're back.<br/>
🎧 <span>Loads</span> of people have <span>phoned</span> you.<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 I <span>felt</span> just like your <span>secretary</span>!<br/>
🎧 Sorry!<br/>
🎧 I went into the <span>library</span> this <span>afternoon</span> to have a look at a <span>newspaper</span> and I came across something really <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 What? A book?<br/>
🎧 No, a <span>brochure</span> from a <span>summer</span> <span>festival</span> <span>-</span> <span>mainly</span> <span>Spanish</span> music.<br/>
🎧 Look, I've got it here.<br/>
🎧 <span>Spanish</span> music?<br/>
🎧 I really love the <span>guitar</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's have a look.<br/>
🎧 So what's this group <span>'Guitarrini'</span>?<br/>
🎧 They're really good.<br/>
🎧 They had a <span>video</span> with all the <span>highlights</span> of the <span>festival</span> at a <span>stand</span> in the <span>lobby</span> to the <span>library</span>,<br/>
🎧 so I heard them.<br/>
🎧 They play <span>fantastic</span> <span>instruments</span> <span>-</span> <span>drums</span> and <span>flutes</span> and old <span>kinds</span> of <span>guitars</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've never heard anything like it before.<br/>
🎧 Sounds great.<br/>
🎧 Okay. Shall we go then?<br/>
🎧 <span>Spoil</span> <span>ourselves</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, let's.<br/>
🎧 The only <span>problem</span> is there aren't any <span>cheap</span> <span>seats…<br/></span>
🎧 it's all one <span>price</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, in that case we could sit right at the <span>front</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 we'd have a really good <span>view</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, though I think that if you sit at the back you can actually hear the whole thing better.<br/>
🎧 Yes, <span>anyway</span> we can decide when we get there.<br/>
🎧 So will you <span>fill</span> in the <span>form</span> or shall I?<br/>
🎧 I'll do it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Name</span>: <span>George</span> <span>O'Neill</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Address:<br/></span>
🎧 <span>48</span> <span>North</span> <span>Avenue</span>, <span>Westsea</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you remember our new <span>postcode</span>?<br/>
🎧 Still can't remember it.<br/>
🎧 Just a <span>minute</span>, I've got it <span>written</span> down here.<br/>
🎧 <span>WS62YH<br/></span>
🎧 Do you need the phone too?<br/>
🎧 Please.<br/>
🎧 I'm really bad at <span>numbers</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>01674553242</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, let's book two <span>tickets</span> for <span>Guitarrini</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 If you're sure <span>7.50</span> each is alright.<br/>
🎧 How do you feel about the <span>singer</span>?<br/>
🎧 I haven't quite <span>decided</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I've <span>noticed</span> something on the <span>booking</span> <span>form</span> that might just <span>persuade</span> me!<br/>
🎧 What's that then?<br/>
🎧 Free <span>refreshments</span>!<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 Yes, look here.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sunday</span> <span>17th</span> of <span>June</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Singer</span>, <span>ticket</span> <span>£6</span> <span>includes</span> <span>drinks</span> in the garden.<br/>
🎧 Sounds like a <span>bargain</span> to me!<br/>
🎧 Yes, let's book two <span>tickets</span> for that.<br/>
🎧 So, what else?<br/>
🎧 I'm feeling quite <span>keen</span> now!<br/>
🎧 How about the <span>pianist</span> on the <span>22nd</span> of <span>June</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna</span> <span>Ventura</span>?<br/>
🎧 I've just <span>remembered</span> that's my <span>evening</span> class <span>night</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's okay.<br/>
🎧 I'll just have to go on my own <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 but we can go to the <span>Spanish</span> <span>dance</span> and <span>guitar</span> <span>concert</span> together, can't we?<br/>
🎧 Yes <span>-</span> I'm sure <span>Tom</span> and <span>Kieran</span> would enjoy that too.<br/>
🎧 Good <span>heavens</span> <span>-</span> <span>£10.50</span> a <span>ticket</span>!<br/>
🎧 I can see we're going to have to go without food for the <span>rest</span> of the week <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 we'll need to book <span>four</span>!<br/>
🎧 Wish we were students <span>-</span> look!<br/>
🎧 Children, students and <span>senior</span> <span>citizens</span> get a <span>50%</span> <span>discount</span> on everything.<br/>
🎧 If only!<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Hello, and thank you for <span>asking</span> me to your <span>teachers'</span> <span>meeting</span> to talk about the <span>Dinosaur</span> <span>Museum<br/></span>
🎧 and to tell you a bit about what you can do with your students there.<br/>
🎧 Well, let me give you some of the <span>basic</span> <span>information</span> first.<br/>
🎧 In <span>regard</span> to <span>opening</span> hours,<br/>
🎧 we're open every day of the week from <span>9</span> am to <span>8</span> <span>pm<br/></span>
🎧 <span>except</span> on <span>Mondays</span> when we <span>close</span> at <span>1.30</span> pm.<br/>
🎧 And, in <span>fact</span> the only day in the year when we're <span>closed</span> is on the <span>25th</span> of <span>December</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can book a <span>guided</span> <span>tour</span> for your school group any time that we're open.<br/>
🎧 If you <span>bring</span> a school group to the <span>museum</span>,<br/>
🎧 when you <span>arrive</span> we ask you to <span>remain</span> with your group in the car <span>park</span>.<br/>
🎧 One or more of the <span>tour</span> <span>guides</span> will <span>welcome</span> you <span>there<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>brief</span> you about what the <span>tour</span> will be about.<br/>
🎧 We do this there because our <span>entrance</span> is quite <span>small<br/></span>
🎧 and we really haven't got much room for <span>briefing</span> <span>groups</span> in the <span>exhibition</span> <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 As <span>far</span> as the amount of time you'll need <span>goes</span>,<br/>
🎧 if you <span>bring</span> a school group,<br/>
🎧 you should plan on <span>allowing</span> a <span>minimum</span> of <span>90</span> <span>minutes</span> for the visit.<br/>
🎧 This <span>allows</span> <span>15</span> <span>minutes</span> to get on and off the <span>coach</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>45</span> <span>minutes</span> for the <span>guided</span> <span>tour<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>30</span> <span>minutes</span> for <span>after-tour</span> <span>activities</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you're going to have lunch at the <span>museum</span>,<br/>
🎧 you will, of course, have to <span>allow</span> more time.<br/>
🎧 There are two <span>cafés</span> in the <span>museum</span>, with <span>seating</span> for <span>80</span> people.<br/>
🎧 If you want to eat there you'll need to <span>reserve</span> some <span>seating</span>,<br/>
🎧 as they can get quite <span>crowded</span> at lunch time.<br/>
🎧 Then outside the <span>museum</span> at the back there are <span>tables</span>,<br/>
🎧 and students can <span>bring</span> their own lunch and eat it there in the open air.<br/>
🎧 When the students come into the <span>museum</span> <span>foyer</span>,<br/>
🎧 we ask them to check in their <span>backpacks</span> with their books, lunch <span>boxes</span>, <span>etc</span>, at the <span>cloakroom<br/></span>
🎧 before they <span>enter</span> the <span>museum</span> <span>proper</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>afraid</span> in the <span>past</span>, we have had a few things <span>gone</span> <span>missing</span> after school <span>visits</span>,<br/>
🎧 so this is a <span>strict</span> <span>rule</span>.<br/>
🎧 Also, some of the <span>exhibits</span> are <span>fragile<br/></span>
🎧 and we don't want them to be <span>accidentally</span> <span>knocked</span>.<br/>
🎧 But we do <span>provide</span> school students with <span>handouts</span> with <span>questions</span> and <span>quizzes</span> on them.<br/>
🎧 There's so much that students can learn in the <span>museum<br/></span>
🎧 and it's fun for them to have something to do.<br/>
🎧 Of course, they'll need to <span>bring</span> something to <span>write</span> with for these.<br/>
🎧 We do <span>allow</span> students to take <span>photographs</span>.<br/>
🎧 For students who are doing <span>projects<br/></span>
🎧 it's useful to make some kind of <span>visual</span> <span>record</span> of what they <span>see<br/></span>
🎧 that they can add to their <span>reports</span>.<br/>
🎧 And finally, they should not <span>bring</span> anything to eat into the <span>museum</span>,<br/>
🎧 or <span>drinks</span> of any kind.<br/>
🎧 There are also a few things the students can do after the <span>tour</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>threatrette</span> on the <span>ground</span> <span>floor</span>,<br/>
🎧 there are <span>continuous</span> <span>screenings</span> of short <span>documentaries</span> about <span>dinosaurs</span> which they can see at any time.<br/>
🎧 We used to have an <span>activity</span> room with more <span>interactive</span> things like <span>making</span> <span>models</span> of <span>dinosaurs<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>drawing</span> and <span>painting</span> <span>pictures</span>, even <span>hunting</span> for <span>dinosaur</span> <span>eggs</span>,<br/>
🎧 but, <span>unfortunately</span>, the room was <span>damaged</span> in a bad <span>storm</span> <span>recently</span> when water came in the <span>roof</span>,<br/>
🎧 so that's <span>closed</span> at the <span>moment</span>.<br/>
🎧 But we do have an IT <span>centre<br/></span>
🎧 where students have <span>access</span> to <span>CD</span> <span>ROMs</span> with a <span>range</span> of <span>dinosaur</span> <span>games</span>.<br/>
🎧 These <span>games</span> are a lot of fun,<br/>
🎧 but they also <span>teach</span> the students about the lives of <span>dinosaurs</span>,<br/>
🎧 how they <span>found</span> food, <span>protected</span> their <span>habitat</span>, <span>survived</span> <span>threats</span>, that kind of thing.<br/>
🎧 <span>And…</span> I think that's all I have to tell you.<br/>
🎧 Please feel free to ask any <span>questions</span> if you would like to know anything <span>else…<br/>
</span> <span><br/>

🎧 Right, <span>Sandra</span>.<br/>
🎧 You wanted to see me to get some <span>feedback</span> on your <span>group's</span> <span>proposal</span>.<br/>
🎧 The one you're <span>submitting</span> for the <span>Geography</span> <span>Society</span> <span>field</span> <span>trip</span> <span>competition</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've had a look through your <span>proposal</span> and I think it's a really good <span>choice</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, I only have a few things to say about it, <span>but..</span>.<br/>
🎧 even in an <span>outline</span> <span>document</span> like this,<br/>
🎧 you really have to be <span>careful</span> to <span>avoid</span> <span>typos</span> and <span>problems</span> with <span>layout</span> in the <span>proposal</span>,<br/>
🎧 and even in the <span>contents</span> <span>page</span>.<br/>
🎧 So read it through <span>carefully</span> before <span>submitting</span> it, okay?<br/>
🎧 Will do.<br/>
🎧 And, I've made a few <span>notes</span> on the <span>proposal</span> about things which could have been better <span>sequenced</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 As for the <span>writing</span> <span>itself</span>,<br/>
🎧 I've <span>annotated</span> the <span>proposal</span> as and where I thought it could be <span>improved</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Generally</span> <span>speaking</span>, I feel you've often used <span>complex</span> <span>structures</span> and long <span>sentences</span> for the <span>sake</span> of <span>it<br/></span>
🎧 and as a <span>consequence…</span>.<br/>
🎧 although your <span>paragraphing</span> and <span>inclusion</span> of <span>sub-headings</span> <span>help…<br/></span>
🎧 it's quite <span>hard</span> to <span>follow</span> your <span>train</span> of thought at <span>times</span>.<br/>
🎧 So cut them down a bit, can you?<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 Yes. And don't <span>forget</span> simple <span>formatting</span> like <span>numbering</span>.<br/>
🎧 Didn't I use <span>page</span> <span>numbers</span>?<br/>
🎧 I didn't mean that.<br/>
🎧 Look, you've <span>remembered</span> to <span>include</span> <span>headers</span> and <span>footers</span>, which is good,<br/>
🎧 but <span>listing</span> <span>ideas</span> <span>clearly</span> is important.<br/>
🎧 Number them or use <span>bullet</span> <span>points</span>, which is even <span>clearer</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then you'll focus the <span>reader</span> on your <span>main</span> <span>points</span>.<br/>
🎧 I thought your <span>suggestion</span> to go to the <span>Navajo</span> <span>Tribal</span> <span>Park</span> was a very good idea.<br/>
🎧 I've always wanted to go there.<br/>
🎧 My <span>father</span> was a great fan of <span>cowboy</span> <span>films</span> and the <span>Wild</span> <span>West<br/></span>
🎧 so I was <span>subjected</span> to <span>seeing</span> all the <span>epics</span>,<br/>
🎧 many of which were <span>shot</span> there.<br/>
🎧 As a <span>consequence</span>, it <span>feels</span> very <span>familiar</span> to <span>me<br/></span>
🎧 and it's <span>awesome</span> both <span>geographically</span> and <span>visually</span>,<br/>
🎧 so it's somewhere I've always wanted to visit.<br/>
🎧 The <span>subsequent</span> <span>research</span> I <span>did<br/></span>
🎧 and the online <span>photographs</span> made me even <span>keener</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, let's look at the <span>content</span> of your <span>proposal</span> now.<br/>
🎧 Did you find it <span>comprehensive</span> enough?<br/>
🎧 Well, yes and no.<br/>
🎧 You've <span>listed</span> <span>several</span> different <span>topics</span> on your <span>contents</span> <span>page</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I'm not sure they're all <span>relevant</span>.<br/>
🎧 No?<br/>
🎧 Well, I thought that from the <span>perspective</span> of a <span>field</span> <span>trip</span>,<br/>
🎧 one thing I <span>needed</span> to focus on was the <span>sandstone</span> <span>plateau</span> and <span>cliffs</span> <span>themselves</span>.<br/>
🎧 The way they <span>tower</span> up from the <span>flat</span> <span>landscape</span> is just amazing.<br/>
🎧 The <span>fact</span> that the <span>surrounding</span> <span>softer</span> <span>rocks</span> were <span>eroded</span> by <span>wind</span> and <span>rain</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>leaving</span> these <span>huge</span> <span>outcrops</span> high <span>above</span> the <span>plain</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>hardly</span> <span>surprising</span> that <span>tourists</span> <span>flock</span> to see the <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, yes.<br/>
🎧 I'd agree with <span>including</span> those <span>points…<br/></span>
🎧 And then the <span>fact</span> that it's been home to <span>native</span> <span>American</span> <span>Navajos<br/></span>
🎧 and all the <span>social</span> <span>history</span> that <span>goes</span> with that.<br/>
🎧 The <span>hardships</span> they <span>endured</span> trying to <span>save</span> their <span>territory</span> from the <span>invading</span> <span>settlers</span>.<br/>
🎧 Their <span>culture</span> is so <span>rich</span> <span>-</span> all those wonderful <span>stories</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, I agree it's <span>interesting</span>, <span>but..</span>.<br/>
🎧 it's not <span>immediately</span> <span>relevant</span> to your <span>proposal</span>, <span>Sandra</span>, <span>so..</span>.<br/>
🎧 at this <span>stage</span>, I <span>suggest</span> you focus on other <span>considerations</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think an <span>indication</span> of what the students on the <span>trip</span> could actually do when they get <span>there<br/></span>
🎧 should be <span>far</span> more <span>central</span>,<br/>
🎧 so that <span>certainly</span> needs to be <span>included</span> and to be <span>expanded</span> <span>upon</span>.<br/>
🎧 And I'd like to see something about the <span>local</span> <span>wildlife</span>, and <span>vegetation</span> too,<br/>
🎧 not that I <span>imagine</span> there's much to see.<br/>
🎧 <span>Presumably</span> the <span>tourist</span> <span>invasion</span> hasn't <span>helped</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, I'll do some work on those two <span>areas</span> as well.<br/>
🎧 But you're right, there's not much <span>apart</span> from some very <span>shallow-rooted</span> <span>species</span>.<br/>
🎧 Although it's <span>cold</span> and <span>snowy</span> there in the <span>winter</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>earth</span> is <span>baked</span> so <span>hard</span> in the <span>summer</span> sun that <span>rainwater</span> can't <span>penetrate</span>.<br/>
🎧 So it's a case of <span>flood</span> or <span>drought</span>, really.<br/>
🎧 So, I <span>understand</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, before we look at everything in more <span>detail</span>,<br/>
🎧 I've got a few <span>factual</span> <span>questions</span> for you.<br/>
🎧 It would be a good idea to <span>include</span> the <span>answers</span> in your <span>finished</span> <span>proposal</span>,<br/>
🎧 because they're <span>missing</span> from your <span>draft</span>.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 So, you <span>mentioned</span> the <span>monoliths</span> and the <span>spires</span>, which was good,<br/>
🎧 but what <span>area</span> does the <span>tribal</span> <span>park</span> <span>cover</span>?<br/>
🎧 Do you know?<br/>
🎧 <span>12,000</span> <span>hectares</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>plain</span> is at about <span>5,850</span> <span>metres</span> <span>above</span> sea <span>level</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Larger</span> than I <span>expected</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Where's the <span>nearest</span> <span>accommodation</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's a <span>practical</span> <span>detail</span> that you haven't <span>included</span>.<br/>
🎧 Have you done any <span>research</span> on that?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 There's <span>nowhere</span> to <span>stay</span> in the <span>park</span> <span>itself</span>,<br/>
🎧 but there's an old <span>trading</span> <span>post</span> called <span>Goulding</span> quite near.<br/>
🎧 All <span>kinds</span> of <span>tours</span> start from <span>Goulding</span>, too.<br/>
🎧 What kind of <span>tours</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, the most <span>popular</span> are in <span>four-wheel</span> drive <span>jeeps</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 but I wouldn't <span>recommend</span> <span>hiring</span> those.<br/>
🎧 I think the best way to <span>appreciate</span> the <span>area</span> would be to <span>hire</span> <span>horses</span> <span>instead<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>trek</span> around on those.<br/>
🎧 <span>Biking</span> is not <span>allowed<br/></span>
🎧 and it's <span>impossible</span> to drive around the <span>area</span> in <span>private</span> <span>vehicles</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>tracks</span> are too <span>rough</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, <span>lastly</span>. What else is <span>worth</span> <span>visiting</span> there?<br/>
🎧 There are <span>several</span> <span>caves</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I haven't <span>looked</span> into any <span>details</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll find out about them.<br/>
🎧 Okay, good.<br/>
🎧 Now what I'd like to know <span>is…<br/>

🎧 We'll <span>begin</span> with some <span>basics</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Firstly</span>, what do we learn by <span>studying</span> <span>geography</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, we learn a great <span>deal</span> about all the <span>processes<br/></span>
🎧 that have <span>affected</span> and that <span>continue</span> to <span>affect</span> the <span>earth's</span> <span>surface</span>.<br/>
🎧 But we learn <span>far</span> more than that,<br/>
🎧 because <span>studying</span> <span>geography</span> also <span>informs</span> us about the different <span>kinds</span> of <span>relationships<br/></span>
🎧 that <span>develop</span> between a <span>particular</span> <span>environment</span> and the people that live there.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 We like to think of <span>geography</span> as having two <span>main</span> <span>branches</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's the <span>study</span> of the <span>nature</span> of our <span>planet</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 its <span>physical</span> <span>features</span>, what it actually looks like <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and then there's the <span>study</span> of the <span>ways</span> in which we choose to <span>live<br/></span>
🎧 and of the <span>impact</span> of those on our <span>planet</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>current</span> use of <span>carbon</span> <span>fuels</span> is a good example of that.<br/>
🎧 But there are more <span>specific</span> <span>study</span> <span>areas</span> to <span>consider</span> too,<br/>
🎧 and we'll be looking at each of these in <span>turn</span> <span>throughout</span> this <span>semester</span>.<br/>
🎧 These <span>include</span> <span>bio-physical</span> <span>geography</span>,<br/>
🎧 by which I mean the <span>study</span> of the <span>natural</span> <span>environment</span> and all its living things.<br/>
🎧 Then there's <span>topography</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 that looks at the <span>shapes</span> of the <span>land</span> and <span>oceans</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's the <span>study</span> of <span>political</span> <span>geography</span> and <span>social</span> <span>geography</span> too, of course,<br/>
🎧 which is the <span>study</span> of <span>communities</span> of people.<br/>
🎧 We have <span>economic</span> <span>geography</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 in which we <span>examine</span> all <span>kinds</span> of <span>resource</span> and their use <span>-</span> <span>agriculture</span>, for example.<br/>
🎧 Next comes <span>historical</span> <span>geography</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>understanding</span> of how people and their <span>environments<br/></span>
🎧 and the <span>ways</span> they <span>interact</span> have <span>changed</span> over a <span>period</span> of time <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>urban</span> <span>geography</span>,<br/>
🎧 an <span>aspect</span> I'm <span>particularly</span> interested in,<br/>
🎧 which takes as its <span>focus</span>: the <span>location</span> of <span>cities</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>services</span> that those <span>cities</span> <span>provide</span>.<br/>
🎧 and <span>migration</span> of people to and from such <span>cities</span>.<br/>
🎧 And <span>lastly</span>, we have <span>cartography</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's the <span>art</span> and <span>science</span> of <span>map-making</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll be doing a lot of that!<br/>
🎧 So, to <span>summarise</span> before we <span>continue</span>,<br/>
🎧 we now have our key <span>answer…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>studying</span> this <span>subject</span> is <span>important<br/></span>
🎧 because without <span>geographical</span> <span>knowledge</span>, we would know very little about our <span>surroundings<br/></span>
🎧 and we wouldn't be able to <span>identify</span> all the <span>problems</span> that <span>relate</span> to them.<br/>
🎧 So, by <span>definition</span>, we wouldn't be in an <span>informed</span> <span>position</span> to work out how to <span>solve</span> any of them.<br/>
🎧 Okay, now for some <span>practicalities</span>.<br/>
🎧 What do <span>geographers</span> actually do?<br/>
🎧 Well, we <span>collect</span> <span>data</span> to <span>begin</span> with!<br/>
🎧 You'll be doing a lot of that on your first <span>field</span> <span>trip</span>!<br/>
🎧 How do we do this?<br/>
🎧 There are <span>several</span> <span>means</span>.<br/>
🎧 We might, for example, <span>conduct</span> a <span>census</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>count</span> a <span>population</span> in a <span>given</span> <span>area</span> <span>perhaps</span>.<br/>
🎧 We also need <span>images</span> of the <span>earth's</span> <span>surface<br/></span>
🎧 which we can <span>produce</span> by <span>means</span> of <span>computer-generation</span> <span>technology<br/></span>
🎧 or with the help of <span>satellite</span> <span>relays</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've come a very long way from the <span>early</span> <span>exploration</span> of the <span>world</span> by <span>sailing</span> <span>ships<br/></span>
🎧 when <span>geographers</span> only had <span>pens</span> and <span>paper</span> at their <span>disposal</span>.<br/>
🎧 After we've <span>gathered</span> our <span>information</span>, we must <span>analyse</span> it!<br/>
🎧 We need to look for <span>patterns</span>, most <span>commonly</span> those of <span>causes</span> and <span>consequences</span>.<br/>
🎧 This kind of <span>information</span> helps us to <span>predict</span> and <span>resolve</span> <span>problems</span> that could <span>affect</span> the <span>world</span> we live in.<br/>
🎧 But we don't keep all this <span>information</span> <span>confidential</span>.<br/>
🎧 We then need to <span>publish</span> our <span>findings</span> so that other people can <span>access</span> it and be <span>informed</span> by it.<br/>
🎧 And one way which this <span>information</span> can be <span>published</span> is in the <span>form</span> of <span>maps</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll all have used one at some <span>stage</span> of your life already.<br/>
🎧 Let's <span>consider</span> the <span>benefits</span> of <span>maps</span> from a <span>geographer's</span> <span>perspective</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Maps</span> can be <span>folded</span> and put in a <span>pocket<br/></span>
🎧 and can <span>provide</span> a great <span>store</span> of <span>reference</span> when they're <span>collected</span> into an <span>atlas</span>.<br/>
🎧 They can <span>depict</span> the <span>physical</span> <span>features</span> of the <span>entire</span> <span>planet</span> if <span>necessary</span>,<br/>
🎧 or just a small <span>part</span> of it in much <span>greater</span> <span>detail</span>.<br/>
🎧 But there is a <span>drawback</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can't exactly <span>replicate</span> something that is <span>three-dimensional</span>, like our <span>planet</span>, on a <span>flat</span> <span>piece</span> of <span>paper</span>,<br/>
🎧 because <span>paper</span> has only two <span>dimensions</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that <span>means</span> <span>there'll</span> always be a <span>certain</span> <span>degree</span> of <span>distortion</span> on a map.<br/>
🎧 It can't be <span>avoided</span>.<br/>
🎧 We can also use <span>aerial</span> <span>photographs…<br/></span>
🎧 <span>pictures</span> taken by <span>cameras</span> at high <span>altitude</span> <span>above</span> the <span>earth</span>.<br/>
🎧 These are great for <span>showing</span> all <span>kinds</span> of <span>geographical</span> <span>features</span> that are not easy to see from the <span>ground</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can <span>easily</span> <span>illustrate</span> <span>areas</span> of <span>diseased</span> <span>trees</span> or how much <span>traffic</span> is on the <span>road</span> at a <span>given</span> <span>time<br/></span>
🎧 or <span>information</span> about <span>deep</span> sea <span>beds</span>, for example.<br/>
🎧 Then there are <span>Landsats</span>.<br/>
🎧 These are <span>satellites</span> that <span>circle</span> the <span>earth<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>transmit</span> <span>visual</span> <span>information</span> to <span>computers</span> at <span>receiving</span> <span>stations</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>circle</span> the <span>earth</span> <span>several</span> <span>times</span> a <span>day<br/></span>
🎧 and can <span>provide</span> a <span>mass</span> of <span>information</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 you'll all be <span>familiar</span> with the <span>information</span> they give us about the <span>weather</span>, for example.<br/>
🎧 So, what we're going to do now is look at a short <span>presentation…<br/>
