🎧 Hi, George!<br/>
🎧 Glad you're back.<br/>
🎧 Loads of people have phoned you.<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 I felt just like your secretary!<br/>
🎧 Sorry!<br/>
🎧 I went into the library this afternoon to have a look at a newspaper and I came across something really interesting.<br/>
🎧 What? A book?<br/>
🎧 No, a brochure from a summer festival - mainly Spanish music.<br/>
🎧 Look, I've got it here.<br/>
🎧 Spanish music?<br/>
🎧 I really love the guitar.<br/>
🎧 Let's have a look.<br/>
🎧 So what's this group 'Guitarrini'?<br/>
🎧 They're really good.<br/>
🎧 They had a video with all the highlights of the festival at a stand in the lobby to the library,<br/>
🎧 so I heard them.<br/>
🎧 They play fantastic instruments - drums and flutes and old kinds of guitars.<br/>
🎧 I've never heard anything like it before.<br/>
🎧 Sounds great.<br/>
🎧 Okay. Shall we go then?<br/>
🎧 Spoil ourselves?<br/>
🎧 Yes, let's.<br/>
🎧 The only problem is there aren't any cheap seats…<br/>
🎧 it's all one price.<br/>
🎧 Well, in that case we could sit right at the front -<br/>
🎧 we'd have a really good view.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, though I think that if you sit at the back you can actually hear the whole thing better.<br/>
🎧 Yes, anyway we can decide when we get there.<br/>
🎧 So will you fill in the form or shall I?<br/>
🎧 I'll do it.<br/>
🎧 Name: George O'Neill.<br/>
🎧 Address:<br/>
🎧 48 North Avenue, Westsea.<br/>
🎧 Do you remember our new postcode?<br/>
🎧 Still can't remember it.<br/>
🎧 Just a minute, I've got it written down here.<br/>
🎧 WS62YH<br/>
🎧 Do you need the phone too?<br/>
🎧 Please.<br/>
🎧 I'm really bad at numbers.<br/>
🎧 01674553242.<br/>
🎧 So, let's book two tickets for Guitarrini.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 If you're sure 7.50 each is alright.<br/>
🎧 How do you feel about the singer?<br/>
🎧 I haven't quite decided.<br/>
🎧 But I've noticed something on the booking form that might just persuade me!<br/>
🎧 What's that then?<br/>
🎧 Free refreshments!<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 Yes, look here.<br/>
🎧 Sunday 17th of June.<br/>
🎧 Singer, ticket £6 includes drinks in the garden.<br/>
🎧 Sounds like a bargain to me!<br/>
🎧 Yes, let's book two tickets for that.<br/>
🎧 So, what else?<br/>
🎧 I'm feeling quite keen now!<br/>
🎧 How about the pianist on the 22nd of June?<br/>
🎧 Anna Ventura?<br/>
🎧 I've just remembered that's my evening class night.<br/>
🎧 That's okay.<br/>
🎧 I'll just have to go on my own -<br/>
🎧 but we can go to the Spanish dance and guitar concert together, can't we?<br/>
🎧 Yes - I'm sure Tom and Kieran would enjoy that too.<br/>
🎧 Good heavens - £10.50 a ticket!<br/>
🎧 I can see we're going to have to go without food for the rest of the week -<br/>
🎧 we'll need to book four!<br/>
🎧 Wish we were students - look!<br/>
🎧 Children, students and senior citizens get a 50% discount on everything.<br/>
🎧 If only!<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Hello, and thank you for asking me to your teachers' meeting to talk about the Dinosaur Museum<br/>
🎧 and to tell you a bit about what you can do with your students there.<br/>
🎧 Well, let me give you some of the basic information first.<br/>
🎧 In regard to opening hours,<br/>
🎧 we're open every day of the week from 9 am to 8 pm<br/>
🎧 except on Mondays when we close at 1.30 pm.<br/>
🎧 And, in fact the only day in the year when we're closed is on the 25th of December.<br/>
🎧 You can book a guided tour for your school group any time that we're open.<br/>
🎧 If you bring a school group to the museum,<br/>
🎧 when you arrive we ask you to remain with your group in the car park.<br/>
🎧 One or more of the tour guides will welcome you there<br/>
🎧 and brief you about what the tour will be about.<br/>
🎧 We do this there because our entrance is quite small<br/>
🎧 and we really haven't got much room for briefing groups in the exhibition area.<br/>
🎧 As far as the amount of time you'll need goes,<br/>
🎧 if you bring a school group,<br/>
🎧 you should plan on allowing a minimum of 90 minutes for the visit.<br/>
🎧 This allows 15 minutes to get on and off the coach,<br/>
🎧 45 minutes for the guided tour<br/>
🎧 and 30 minutes for after-tour activities.<br/>
🎧 If you're going to have lunch at the museum,<br/>
🎧 you will, of course, have to allow more time.<br/>
🎧 There are two cafés in the museum, with seating for 80 people.<br/>
🎧 If you want to eat there you'll need to reserve some seating,<br/>
🎧 as they can get quite crowded at lunch time.<br/>
🎧 Then outside the museum at the back there are tables,<br/>
🎧 and students can bring their own lunch and eat it there in the open air.<br/>
🎧 When the students come into the museum foyer,<br/>
🎧 we ask them to check in their backpacks with their books, lunch boxes, etc, at the cloakroom<br/>
🎧 before they enter the museum proper.<br/>
🎧 I'm afraid in the past, we have had a few things gone missing after school visits,<br/>
🎧 so this is a strict rule.<br/>
🎧 Also, some of the exhibits are fragile<br/>
🎧 and we don't want them to be accidentally knocked.<br/>
🎧 But we do provide school students with handouts with questions and quizzes on them.<br/>
🎧 There's so much that students can learn in the museum<br/>
🎧 and it's fun for them to have something to do.<br/>
🎧 Of course, they'll need to bring something to write with for these.<br/>
🎧 We do allow students to take photographs.<br/>
🎧 For students who are doing projects<br/>
🎧 it's useful to make some kind of visual record of what they see<br/>
🎧 that they can add to their reports.<br/>
🎧 And finally, they should not bring anything to eat into the museum,<br/>
🎧 or drinks of any kind.<br/>
🎧 There are also a few things the students can do after the tour.<br/>
🎧 In the threatrette on the ground floor,<br/>
🎧 there are continuous screenings of short documentaries about dinosaurs which they can see at any time.<br/>
🎧 We used to have an activity room with more interactive things like making models of dinosaurs<br/>
🎧 and drawing and painting pictures, even hunting for dinosaur eggs,<br/>
🎧 but, unfortunately, the room was damaged in a bad storm recently when water came in the roof,<br/>
🎧 so that's closed at the moment.<br/>
🎧 But we do have an IT centre<br/>
🎧 where students have access to CD ROMs with a range of dinosaur games.<br/>
🎧 These games are a lot of fun,<br/>
🎧 but they also teach the students about the lives of dinosaurs,<br/>
🎧 how they found food, protected their habitat, survived threats, that kind of thing.<br/>
🎧 And… I think that's all I have to tell you.<br/>
🎧 Please feel free to ask any questions if you would like to know anything else…<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Right, Sandra.<br/>
🎧 You wanted to see me to get some feedback on your group's proposal.<br/>
🎧 The one you're submitting for the Geography Society field trip competition.<br/>
🎧 I've had a look through your proposal and I think it's a really good choice.<br/>
🎧 In fact, I only have a few things to say about it, but...<br/>
🎧 even in an outline document like this,<br/>
🎧 you really have to be careful to avoid typos and problems with layout in the proposal,<br/>
🎧 and even in the contents page.<br/>
🎧 So read it through carefully before submitting it, okay?<br/>
🎧 Will do.<br/>
🎧 And, I've made a few notes on the proposal about things which could have been better sequenced.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 As for the writing itself,<br/>
🎧 I've annotated the proposal as and where I thought it could be improved.<br/>
🎧 Generally speaking, I feel you've often used complex structures and long sentences for the sake of it<br/>
🎧 and as a consequence….<br/>
🎧 although your paragraphing and inclusion of sub-headings help…<br/>
🎧 it's quite hard to follow your train of thought at times.<br/>
🎧 So cut them down a bit, can you?<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 Yes. And don't forget simple formatting like numbering.<br/>
🎧 Didn't I use page numbers?<br/>
🎧 I didn't mean that.<br/>
🎧 Look, you've remembered to include headers and footers, which is good,<br/>
🎧 but listing ideas clearly is important.<br/>
🎧 Number them or use bullet points, which is even clearer.<br/>
🎧 Then you'll focus the reader on your main points.<br/>
🎧 I thought your suggestion to go to the Navajo Tribal Park was a very good idea.<br/>
🎧 I've always wanted to go there.<br/>
🎧 My father was a great fan of cowboy films and the Wild West<br/>
🎧 so I was subjected to seeing all the epics,<br/>
🎧 many of which were shot there.<br/>
🎧 As a consequence, it feels very familiar to me<br/>
🎧 and it's awesome both geographically and visually,<br/>
🎧 so it's somewhere I've always wanted to visit.<br/>
🎧 The subsequent research I did<br/>
🎧 and the online photographs made me even keener.<br/>
🎧 Interesting.<br/>
🎧 Right, let's look at the content of your proposal now.<br/>
🎧 Did you find it comprehensive enough?<br/>
🎧 Well, yes and no.<br/>
🎧 You've listed several different topics on your contents page,<br/>
🎧 but I'm not sure they're all relevant.<br/>
🎧 No?<br/>
🎧 Well, I thought that from the perspective of a field trip,<br/>
🎧 one thing I needed to focus on was the sandstone plateau and cliffs themselves.<br/>
🎧 The way they tower up from the flat landscape is just amazing.<br/>
🎧 The fact that the surrounding softer rocks were eroded by wind and rain,<br/>
🎧 leaving these huge outcrops high above the plain.<br/>
🎧 It's hardly surprising that tourists flock to see the area.<br/>
🎧 Well, yes.<br/>
🎧 I'd agree with including those points…<br/>
🎧 And then the fact that it's been home to native American Navajos<br/>
🎧 and all the social history that goes with that.<br/>
🎧 The hardships they endured trying to save their territory from the invading settlers.<br/>
🎧 Their culture is so rich - all those wonderful stories.<br/>
🎧 Well, I agree it's interesting, but...<br/>
🎧 it's not immediately relevant to your proposal, Sandra, so...<br/>
🎧 at this stage, I suggest you focus on other considerations.<br/>
🎧 I think an indication of what the students on the trip could actually do when they get there<br/>
🎧 should be far more central,<br/>
🎧 so that certainly needs to be included and to be expanded upon.<br/>
🎧 And I'd like to see something about the local wildlife, and vegetation too,<br/>
🎧 not that I imagine there's much to see.<br/>
🎧 Presumably the tourist invasion hasn't helped.<br/>
🎧 Okay, I'll do some work on those two areas as well.<br/>
🎧 But you're right, there's not much apart from some very shallow-rooted species.<br/>
🎧 Although it's cold and snowy there in the winter,<br/>
🎧 the earth is baked so hard in the summer sun that rainwater can't penetrate.<br/>
🎧 So it's a case of flood or drought, really.<br/>
🎧 So, I understand.<br/>
🎧 Now, before we look at everything in more detail,<br/>
🎧 I've got a few factual questions for you.<br/>
🎧 It would be a good idea to include the answers in your finished proposal,<br/>
🎧 because they're missing from your draft.<br/>
🎧 Fine.<br/>
🎧 So, you mentioned the monoliths and the spires, which was good,<br/>
🎧 but what area does the tribal park cover?<br/>
🎧 Do you know?<br/>
🎧 12,000 hectares,<br/>
🎧 and the plain is at about 5,850 metres above sea level.<br/>
🎧 Larger than I expected.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Where's the nearest accommodation?<br/>
🎧 That's a practical detail that you haven't included.<br/>
🎧 Have you done any research on that?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 There's nowhere to stay in the park itself,<br/>
🎧 but there's an old trading post called Goulding quite near.<br/>
🎧 All kinds of tours start from Goulding, too.<br/>
🎧 What kind of tours?<br/>
🎧 Well, the most popular are in four-wheel drive jeeps -<br/>
🎧 but I wouldn't recommend hiring those.<br/>
🎧 I think the best way to appreciate the area would be to hire horses instead<br/>
🎧 and trek around on those.<br/>
🎧 Biking is not allowed<br/>
🎧 and it's impossible to drive around the area in private vehicles.<br/>
🎧 The tracks are too rough.<br/>
🎧 Okay, lastly. What else is worth visiting there?<br/>
🎧 There are several caves,<br/>
🎧 but I haven't looked into any details.<br/>
🎧 I'll find out about them.<br/>
🎧 Okay, good.<br/>
🎧 Now what I'd like to know is…<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 So, welcome to your introductory geography lecture.<br/>
🎧 We'll begin with some basics.<br/>
🎧 Firstly, what do we learn by studying geography?<br/>
🎧 Well, we learn a great deal about all the processes<br/>
🎧 that have affected and that continue to affect the earth's surface.<br/>
🎧 But we learn far more than that,<br/>
🎧 because studying geography also informs us about the different kinds of relationships<br/>
🎧 that develop between a particular environment and the people that live there.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 We like to think of geography as having two main branches.<br/>
🎧 There's the study of the nature of our planet -<br/>
🎧 its physical features, what it actually looks like -<br/>
🎧 and then there's the study of the ways in which we choose to live<br/>
🎧 and of the impact of those on our planet.<br/>
🎧 Our current use of carbon fuels is a good example of that.<br/>
🎧 But there are more specific study areas to consider too,<br/>
🎧 and we'll be looking at each of these in turn throughout this semester.<br/>
🎧 These include bio-physical geography,<br/>
🎧 by which I mean the study of the natural environment and all its living things.<br/>
🎧 Then there's topography -<br/>
🎧 that looks at the shapes of the land and oceans.<br/>
🎧 There's the study of political geography and social geography too, of course,<br/>
🎧 which is the study of communities of people.<br/>
🎧 We have economic geography -<br/>
🎧 in which we examine all kinds of resource and their use - agriculture, for example.<br/>
🎧 Next comes historical geography -<br/>
🎧 the understanding of how people and their environments<br/>
🎧 and the ways they interact have changed over a period of time -<br/>
🎧 and urban geography,<br/>
🎧 an aspect I'm particularly interested in,<br/>
🎧 which takes as its focus: the location of cities,<br/>
🎧 the services that those cities provide.<br/>
🎧 and migration of people to and from such cities.<br/>
🎧 And lastly, we have cartography.<br/>
🎧 That's the art and science of map-making.<br/>
🎧 You'll be doing a lot of that!<br/>
🎧 So, to summarise before we continue,<br/>
🎧 we now have our key answer…<br/>
🎧 studying this subject is important<br/>
🎧 because without geographical knowledge, we would know very little about our surroundings<br/>
🎧 and we wouldn't be able to identify all the problems that relate to them.<br/>
🎧 So, by definition, we wouldn't be in an informed position to work out how to solve any of them.<br/>
🎧 Okay, now for some practicalities.<br/>
🎧 What do geographers actually do?<br/>
🎧 Well, we collect data to begin with!<br/>
🎧 You'll be doing a lot of that on your first field trip!<br/>
🎧 How do we do this?<br/>
🎧 There are several means.<br/>
🎧 We might, for example, conduct a census -<br/>
🎧 count a population in a given area perhaps.<br/>
🎧 We also need images of the earth's surface<br/>
🎧 which we can produce by means of computer-generation technology<br/>
🎧 or with the help of satellite relays.<br/>
🎧 We've come a very long way from the early exploration of the world by sailing ships<br/>
🎧 when geographers only had pens and paper at their disposal.<br/>
🎧 After we've gathered our information, we must analyse it!<br/>
🎧 We need to look for patterns, most commonly those of causes and consequences.<br/>
🎧 This kind of information helps us to predict and resolve problems that could affect the world we live in.<br/>
🎧 But we don't keep all this information confidential.<br/>
🎧 We then need to publish our findings so that other people can access it and be informed by it.<br/>
🎧 And one way which this information can be published is in the form of maps.<br/>
🎧 You'll all have used one at some stage of your life already.<br/>
🎧 Let's consider the benefits of maps from a geographer's perspective.<br/>
🎧 Maps can be folded and put in a pocket<br/>
🎧 and can provide a great store of reference when they're collected into an atlas.<br/>
🎧 They can depict the physical features of the entire planet if necessary,<br/>
🎧 or just a small part of it in much greater detail.<br/>
🎧 But there is a drawback.<br/>
🎧 You can't exactly replicate something that is three-dimensional, like our planet, on a flat piece of paper,<br/>
🎧 because paper has only two dimensions,<br/>
🎧 and that means there'll always be a certain degree of distortion on a map.<br/>
🎧 It can't be avoided.<br/>
🎧 We can also use aerial photographs…<br/>
🎧 pictures taken by cameras at high altitude above the earth.<br/>
🎧 These are great for showing all kinds of geographical features that are not easy to see from the ground.<br/>
🎧 You can easily illustrate areas of diseased trees or how much traffic is on the road at a given time<br/>
🎧 or information about deep sea beds, for example.<br/>
🎧 Then there are Landsats.<br/>
🎧 These are satellites that circle the earth<br/>
🎧 and transmit visual information to computers at receiving stations.<br/>
🎧 They circle the earth several times a day<br/>
🎧 and can provide a mass of information -<br/>
🎧 you'll all be familiar with the information they give us about the weather, for example.<br/>
🎧 So, what we're going to do now is look at a short presentation…<br/>
<br/><br/>
