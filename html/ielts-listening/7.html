🎧 Sara</span>, I've heard that you want to move into a homestay</span> family</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is that correct</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's right.<br/>
🎧 I've been staying</span> with my aunt</span> and now my cousin</span> is arriving</span> from Singapore<br/></span>
🎧 and my aunt</span> needs the room for him.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's bad luck</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'll need to get some particulars</span> first.<br/>
🎧 Sara</span>, what's your full name?<br/>
🎧 Sara</span> Lim</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that's Sara</span> without the 'h'</span> at the end.<br/>
🎧 How old are you, Sara</span>?<br/>
🎧 23</span>, only just.<br/>
🎧 It was my birthday</span> on the 21st</span> of August</span>.<br/>
🎧 Happy birthday</span> for yesterday</span>.<br/>
🎧 How long have you been in Australia</span>?<br/>
🎧 A year in Adelaide</span> and 6</span> months</span> in Sydney</span>.<br/>
🎧 I prefer</span> Sydney</span>, I've got more friends here.<br/>
🎧 What's your address</span> at your aunt's</span> house?<br/>
🎧 Flat</span> one, 539</span> Forest</span> Road</span>, Canterbury</span>.<br/>
🎧 And the post</span> code</span> is 2036</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 What are you studying</span> now?<br/>
🎧 I was studying</span> General</span> English in Adelaide<br/></span>
🎧 and now I'm doing Academic</span> English,<br/>
🎧 because I'm trying to get into Medicine</span> next year.<br/>
🎧 That sounds good, but it'll take you a long time.<br/>
🎧 When would you like to move out from your aunt's</span>?<br/>
🎧 My cousin</span> arrives</span> on Friday</span> morning,<br/>
🎧 so I'd better be out on Thursday</span>.<br/>
🎧 What, the 7th</span> of September</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's right.<br/>
🎧 That doesn't leave us much time.<br/>
🎧 Right, okay.<br/>
🎧 I need to know what kind of accommodation</span> you'd like,<br/>
🎧 so I can get you something suitable</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can I share a room with someone</span> else?<br/>
🎧 I've been alone</span> in my room at my aunt's<br/></span>
🎧 and I've always shared</span> with my sister</span> and I like that.<br/>
🎧 Yes, fine.<br/>
🎧 That'll</span> save</span> you money too.<br/>
🎧 Would you like to live with a family</span> or do you think that a single</span> person would be better for you?<br/>
🎧 I have lots of very nice single</span> people on my books.<br/>
🎧 Do you have any women</span> living alone</span>, retired</span> women</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I have quite a few whose children have grown</span> up and left</span> home.<br/>
🎧 In fact</span>, I have some really lovely</span> retired</span> ladies</span>,<br/>
🎧 living by themselves</span>, who just love the company of students.<br/>
🎧 Most of them live in flats</span>, but that's not a problem</span> for you, is it?<br/>
🎧 Not at all. I'm used to that.<br/>
🎧 My aunt</span> lives in a flat</span> too, remember.<br/>
🎧 I'm not used to a big house with a garden, swimming</span> pool</span>, pets</span> and all that.<br/>
🎧 Okay, fine.<br/>
🎧 I know quite a bit about what you want now.<br/>
🎧 I should let you know that your rent</span> will be 160</span> dollars</span> per</span> week.<br/>
🎧 You'll have to pay me 320</span> dollars</span> as a deposit</span> before you move in.<br/>
🎧 The deposit</span> is as insurance</span>, in case you break</span> something.<br/>
🎧 You'll need to pay monthly</span> to me, by cash</span> or cheque</span>, I don't mind</span>.<br/>
🎧 You don't need to pay for gas, electricity</span> or water,<br/>
🎧 but you will need to pay your proportion</span> of the phone bill</span>.<br/>
🎧 Most families</span> do that on an honour</span> system</span>,<br/>
🎧 but you'll have to wait and see.<br/>
🎧 Have you got any more questions</span> for me?<br/>
🎧 When will you know where I can go?<br/>
🎧 I'll work on it now,<br/>
🎧 so come and see me tomorrow</span> and I should have some news</span> for you then.<br/>
🎧 Thanks a lot.<br/>
🎧 Goodbye</span>. See you tomorrow</span> -</span> after lunch would be better for me.<br/>
🎧 Okay, see you then. Bye.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Good evening</span>,<br/>
🎧 and in this week's</span> edition</span> of 'Focus</span> on the Arts'</span>,<br/>
🎧 Jane</span> Hemmington</span> is going to fill</span> us in on what's in store</span> for us at this year's</span> Summer</span> Festival</span>.<br/>
🎧 Over to you, Jane</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you, Geoffrey</span>.<br/>
🎧 This year, the Summer</span> Festival</span> is the biggest</span> we've ever seen</span>,<br/>
🎧 so there should be something for everybody</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is the third</span> year they've</span> run it and the timing's</span> slightly</span> different:<br/></span>
🎧 for the last couple</span> of years it's been around the 5th</span> to 17th</span>,<br/>
🎧 but this year they wanted to allow</span> everyone enough time to recover</span> from the first of January</span> celebrations<br/></span>
🎧 and they've</span> put it at the end of the month.<br/>
🎧 The programme</span> has sensational</span> theatre</span>, dance</span> and also a large number of art</span> exhibitions</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the thing the Festival</span> is most famous for is its great street</span> music.<br/>
🎧 For today's</span> report</span> though, Geoffrey</span>, I'm looking at some of the theatrical</span> events</span> that you might like to see;<br/></span>
🎧 in particular</span>, at this year's</span> theme</span> -</span> circuses</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm going to tell you about two circus</span> performances</span>,<br/>
🎧 but there are plenty</span> of others</span> in the programme</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've chosen</span> these because they represent</span> distinct</span> movements</span> within</span> circus</span> performance</span>.<br/>
🎧 The first is the Circus</span> Romano</span> from Italy</span>.<br/>
🎧 As this is a travelling</span> circus</span>,<br/>
🎧 it follows</span> a long tradition</span> by performing</span> in a marquee</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 which is really like a canvas</span> portable</span> building</span>,<br/>
🎧 usually put up in a green</span> space</span> or car park</span>,<br/>
🎧 rather than in a theatre</span> or stadium</span>.<br/>
🎧 In spite</span> of this, Circus</span> Romano</span> isn't at all like the traditional</span> circuses</span> I grew</span> up with.<br/>
🎧 There are no animals</span> -</span> just very talented</span> clowning</span> and acrobatic</span> routines</span>.<br/>
🎧 The show has a lot of very funny moments</span>, especially</span> at the beginning</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the best part</span> is the music and lighting</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're magical</span>.<br/>
🎧 At forty-five</span> dollars</span> it's very expensive</span> anyway</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 it's really for adult</span> tastes</span>.<br/>
🎧 In fact</span>, much of it would be wasted</span> on children -<br/></span>
🎧 so I suggest</span> you leave them at home.<br/>
🎧 The second circus</span> performance</span> is Circus</span> Electrica</span> at the Studio</span> Theatre</span>.<br/>
🎧 The purists</span> are suggesting</span> that this isn't a circus</span> at all.<br/>
🎧 It's a showcase</span> for skills</span> in dance</span> and magic</span>,<br/>
🎧 rather than the usual</span> ones</span> you expect</span> in a circus</span>.<br/>
🎧 With only six performers</span> it's a small production</span>, which suits</span> the venue</span> well -<br/></span>
🎧 the Studio</span> only seats</span> about 200</span> people.<br/>
🎧 For my money, it's the aerial</span> displays</span> which are outstanding<br/></span>
🎧 as well as the magical</span> tricks</span> -<br/></span>
🎧 features</span> which are missing</span> from Circus</span> Romano</span>.<br/>
🎧 An interesting</span> feature</span> of the show is that the performers</span> are so young -<br/></span>
🎧 the youngest</span> is only 14</span>.<br/>
🎧 But it's still well worth</span> seeing</span>: a good one for the whole family</span>.<br/>
🎧 And finally, as it's summer</span>,<br/>
🎧 you may wish to see some of the Festival</span> performances</span> that are being presented</span> outdoors</span>.<br/>
🎧 Like the famous Mekong</span> Water Puppet</span> Troupe</span>,<br/>
🎧 performing</span> in the City</span> Gardens</span> this week.<br/>
🎧 Now, water puppetry</span> is amazing!<br/>
🎧 It's large puppets</span> on long sticks</span>,<br/>
🎧 controlled</span> by puppeteers</span> standing</span> waist</span> deep</span> in the lake</span>.<br/>
🎧 The puppets</span> do comedy</span> routines</span> and there is some terrific</span> formation</span> dancing</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is a fantastic</span> show and the best moment</span> comes at the end -<br/></span>
🎧 seeing</span> the puppeteers</span>.<br/>
🎧 When the troupe</span> walks</span> up out of the water, you get this amazing feeling.<br/>
🎧 It's really hard</span> to believe</span> that what you've been watching is lifeless</span> wood</span> and cloth</span>.<br/>
🎧 As an adult</span>, I had a great time,<br/>
🎧 but I did note</span> that other older</span> people in the audience</span> weren't quite as taken with it as I was.<br/>
🎧 It's a must for young children though,<br/>
🎧 and that's the audience</span> it's really aimed</span> at.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's all I've time for today,<br/>
🎧 but I'll be back next week with more news</span> of what's worth</span> seeing</span> and what it's best to miss</span>.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Hello.<br/>
🎧 I'm Dawn</span> Matthews</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, hello.<br/>
🎧 I've been referred</span> to you because I'm enquiring</span> about the refresher</span> courses</span> that you run.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to find out a bit more about them.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Well, we run quite a few different short courses</span> for students who are either returning</span> to study</span> or studying</span> part-time</span>.<br/>
🎧 Um</span>, tell me about your situation</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, I think that I really need some help in preparing</span> for the coming</span> semester</span>,<br/>
🎧 especially</span> to build</span> up my confidence</span> a bit<br/></span>
🎧 and help me study</span> effectively</span> because, you see,<br/>
🎧 I've been out in the work-force</span> for nearly</span> twelve</span> years now, so..</span>.<br/>
🎧 it really is a long time since I was last a student.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it can seem</span> like a long time, can't it?<br/>
🎧 Um</span>, well, let me start by telling</span> you what courses</span> we have that might suit</span> you.<br/>
🎧 Are you an undergraduate</span> or a postgraduate</span>?<br/>
🎧 Arts</span> or Sciences</span>?<br/>
🎧 Undergraduate</span>, and I'm in the Business</span> faculty</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right then.<br/>
🎧 First of all, there's our intensive</span> 'Study</span> for Success'</span> seminar<br/></span>
🎧 on the first and second of February</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's aimed</span> at students like you who are uncertain</span> about what to expect</span> at college</span>,<br/>
🎧 and looks at a fairly</span> wide</span> range</span> of approaches</span> to university learning</span>,<br/>
🎧 to motivate</span> you to begin</span> your study<br/></span>
🎧 and build</span> on your own learning</span> strategies</span>.<br/>
🎧 Mm</span>, that sounds good.<br/>
🎧 What are some of the strategies</span> that are presented</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, we try to cover</span> all aspects</span> of study</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some of the strategies</span> in writing</span>, for example,<br/>
🎧 would be improving</span> your planning for writing</span>,<br/>
🎧 organising</span> your thinking<br/></span>
🎧 and building</span> some techniques</span> to help you write</span> more clearly</span>.<br/>
🎧 With reading</span>, there'll</span> be sessions</span> aimed</span> at getting into the habit</span> of analysing</span> material</span> as you read it,<br/>
🎧 and tips</span> to help you record</span> and remember what you have read.<br/>
🎧 It really is very important to begin</span> reading</span> confidently</span> right from the beginning</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's also advice on how to get the most from your lectures<br/></span>
🎧 and practice in giving</span> confident</span> presentations</span>,<br/>
🎧 as well as how to prepare</span> for exams</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about the motivational</span> side of things?<br/>
🎧 Ah. Well, there's a range</span> of motivational</span> exercises</span> that we do<br/></span>
🎧 to help the students feel positive</span> and enthusiastic</span> about their study</span>.<br/>
🎧 The process</span> of learning</span> and exploring</span> a subject</span> can lead</span> to a whole new way of looking at the world</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the study</span> skills</span> and techniques</span> that you build</span> up<br/></span>
🎧 can be applied</span> in all sorts</span> of different ways</span>.<br/>
🎧 Actually, I..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm very excited</span> about the whole thing of taking up studying</span> again but,<br/>
🎧 you know, I'm a little nervous</span> about whether</span> I'll manage</span> to get everything done.<br/>
🎧 I suppose</span> it's the same for all mature</span> students?<br/>
🎧 Of course it is.<br/>
🎧 Two of the key components</span> of the course are time management<br/></span>
🎧 and overcoming</span> procrastination</span>.<br/>
🎧 People discover</span> that, once they learn to plan their days</span>,<br/>
🎧 all the work can be accomplished</span> and there'll</span> still be time for leisure</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is there an enrolment</span> fee</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, er</span>, oh, just a minute</span>, let's see..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ah, the cost</span> is 30</span> pounds</span>,<br/>
🎧 which includes</span> all course materials</span> and morning tea.<br/>
🎧 You have to arrange</span> your own lunch.<br/>
🎧 That wouldn't be a problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 I already make sandwiches</span> for my three</span> kids</span> and my wife</span> and myself every day.<br/>
🎧 I won't have to change my routine</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, I need to tell you that this is a very popular</span> course<br/></span>
🎧 and it's essential</span> that you book well ahead of time.<br/>
🎧 In fact</span>, the Course Convenor</span> tells me that there are only five</span> places</span> left</span>.<br/>
🎧 What other course might be good for me?<br/>
🎧 There is one other that you could benefit</span> from.<br/>
🎧 It's simply</span> called 'Learning</span> Skills</span> for University</span> Study'<br/></span>
🎧 and is on three</span> consecutive</span> mornings<br/></span>
🎧 starting</span> on a Monday</span>, from nine</span> to twelve</span>,<br/>
🎧 and costs</span> 25</span> pounds</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is aimed</span> at upgrading</span> the study</span> skills</span> most school-leavers</span> have<br/></span>
🎧 and help them cope</span> with the increased</span> demands</span> of university study</span>.<br/>
🎧 It focuses</span> mainly</span> on making</span> students more responsible</span> for their own success.<br/>
🎧 What sort</span> of things are covered</span> in this course?<br/>
🎧 Well, basically</span> it's more advanced</span> thinking,<br/>
🎧 note-taking</span>, reading</span> and writing</span> strategies</span>,<br/>
🎧 but also some input</span> about stress</span> management</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think I'd be better off starting</span> from the basics</span> and looking at all the strategies</span>, don't you?<br/>
🎧 Yes, from what you've told me, I think that's more in line</span> with your situation</span>.<br/>
🎧 Alright then,<br/>
🎧 can I book a place on the 'Study</span> for Success'</span> seminar</span> course now?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Let me just get out a registration</span> form</span> and take down your details</span>.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 We're very grateful</span> that the Committee</span> has agreed that a representative</span> for the Students'</span> Union<br/></span>
🎧 can present</span> students'</span> suggestions</span> about the design</span> for the proposed</span> new Union</span> building</span>.<br/>
🎧 We appreciate</span> that some of our ideas</span> may not be feasible</span> in the circumstances</span>,<br/>
🎧 but we do feel that it is important that the ultimate</span> beneficiaries</span> of the facilities</span> should have some say in its design</span>.<br/>
🎧 If I could start by briefly</span> explaining</span> what steps</span> were taken to find out student opinion<br/></span>
🎧 and how we have arrived</span> at conclusions</span>.<br/>
🎧 Firstly</span>, a meeting</span> was held</span> in the current</span> Union</span> for our SU</span> Committee</span> to explain</span> the options.<br/>
🎧 Then we invited</span> all students to submit</span> written</span> suggestions</span> for the design</span>,<br/>
🎧 placing</span> cards</span> in a suggestion</span> box.<br/>
🎧 These suggestions</span> then provided</span> the basis</span> for the design</span> of a questionnaire</span>,<br/>
🎧 which was completed</span> by approximately</span> 2000</span> of the College</span> students<br/></span>
🎧 over a period</span> of three</span> weeks</span>.<br/>
🎧 Finally</span>, the SU</span> Committee</span> collated</span> the results</span> and drew</span> up a report</span>.<br/>
🎧 If I can just hand</span> around a copy</span> of that report</span>.<br/>
🎧 This presentation</span> is essentially</span> a summary</span> and discussion</span> of the key points</span> of this report</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, in broad</span> terms</span>, the consensus</span> was as follows</span>.<br/>
🎧 Firstly</span>, regarding</span> the crucial</span> matter</span> of the site</span>,<br/>
🎧 we presented</span> the three</span> options that you have proposed</span>.<br/>
🎧 One</span>: in the city</span> centre</span>, near the Faculty</span> of Education;<br/></span>
🎧 two</span>: on the outskirts</span> of the city</span>, near the park</span>,<br/>
🎧 and three</span>: out of town</span>, near the halls</span> of residence</span>.<br/>
🎧 We asked</span> students to cite</span> reasons</span> for and against</span> these sites</span> and,<br/>
🎧 and there was remarkable</span> agreement</span> on all three</span>.<br/>
🎧 Site</span> One was unpopular</span> because of traffic</span> and parking</span> problems</span>.<br/>
🎧 Site</span> Two had a number of supporters</span>,<br/>
🎧 mainly</span> because it was close</span> to most lecture</span> rooms</span>.<br/>
🎧 And Site</span> Three</span>, out of town</span>, near the halls</span> of residence</span>,<br/>
🎧 was clearly</span> the most popular</span> because of access</span> from living quarters</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was clear</span> that the Union</span> was mainly</span> to be used after lectures</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was also felt</span> that the larger</span> site</span> would allow</span> more room for a choice</span> of facilities</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our second area</span> of interest</span> was obviously</span> the facilities:<br/></span>
🎧 there was minimal</span> interest</span> in having a library</span> on the premises</span>,<br/>
🎧 but one option seemed</span> to be a reading</span> room instead</span> -</span> more useful.<br/>
🎧 We would like the current</span> table</span> games</span> room to be replaced</span> with a small gym.<br/>
🎧 And, if possible</span>, a small swimming</span> pool</span> -</span> not, of course, Olympic-sized</span>!<br/>
🎧 There was a large number of respondents</span> in favour</span> of a travel agent's</span> and insurance</span> centre</span>.<br/>
🎧 We also request</span> that there be the offices</span> of the Student</span> Counselling</span> Centre</span>,<br/>
🎧 moving</span> this from the Refectory</span>.<br/>
🎧 There was, however</span>, much disagreement</span> about whether</span> to build</span> a drama</span> theatre</span>.<br/>
🎧 Just over forty</span> per</span> cent</span> of the respondents</span> were in favour</span>,<br/>
🎧 but a largish</span> minority</span> were strongly</span> against</span> it,<br/>
🎧 claiming</span> that it is elitist</span> and a waste</span> of funds</span>.<br/>
🎧 Essentially</span> the jury</span> is out on that.<br/>
🎧 Finally</span>, given</span> the number of unfortunate</span> incidents</span> in the current</span> Union</span> over the past</span> few months</span>,<br/>
🎧 a strong</span> point</span> was repeatedly</span> made about security</span>.<br/>
🎧 The recommendations</span> would be at least</span> video</span> surveillance<br/></span>
🎧 and security</span> personnel</span> who would check Student</span> Union</span> cards</span> on request</span>.<br/>
🎧 We doubt</span> if it would be feasible</span> to have a check at reception</span> of all people coming</span> in.<br/>
🎧 Well, this is the summary</span> of the views</span> of the student population</span>.<br/>
🎧 As I say, fuller</span> details</span> are given</span> in our report</span> but<br/></span>
🎧 I'm happy to take any questions</span> if..</span>.<br/>
<br/><br/>
