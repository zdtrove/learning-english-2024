🎧 <span>Sara</span>, I've heard that you want to move into a <span>homestay</span> <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is that <span>correct</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's right.<br/>
🎧 I've been <span>staying</span> with my <span>aunt</span> and now my <span>cousin</span> is <span>arriving</span> from <span>Singapore<br/></span>
🎧 and my <span>aunt</span> needs the room for him.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's bad <span>luck</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'll need to get some <span>particulars</span> first.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sara</span>, what's your full name?<br/>
🎧 <span>Sara</span> <span>Lim</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that's <span>Sara</span> without the <span>'h'</span> at the end.<br/>
🎧 How old are you, <span>Sara</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>23</span>, only just.<br/>
🎧 It was my <span>birthday</span> on the <span>21st</span> of <span>August</span>.<br/>
🎧 Happy <span>birthday</span> for <span>yesterday</span>.<br/>
🎧 How long have you been in <span>Australia</span>?<br/>
🎧 A year in <span>Adelaide</span> and <span>6</span> <span>months</span> in <span>Sydney</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>prefer</span> <span>Sydney</span>, I've got more friends here.<br/>
🎧 What's your <span>address</span> at your <span>aunt's</span> house?<br/>
🎧 <span>Flat</span> one, <span>539</span> <span>Forest</span> <span>Road</span>, <span>Canterbury</span>.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>post</span> <span>code</span> is <span>2036</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 What are you <span>studying</span> now?<br/>
🎧 I was <span>studying</span> <span>General</span> English in <span>Adelaide<br/></span>
🎧 and now I'm doing <span>Academic</span> English,<br/>
🎧 because I'm trying to get into <span>Medicine</span> next year.<br/>
🎧 That sounds good, but it'll take you a long time.<br/>
🎧 When would you like to move out from your <span>aunt's</span>?<br/>
🎧 My <span>cousin</span> <span>arrives</span> on <span>Friday</span> morning,<br/>
🎧 so I'd better be out on <span>Thursday</span>.<br/>
🎧 What, the <span>7th</span> of <span>September</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's right.<br/>
🎧 That doesn't leave us much time.<br/>
🎧 Right, okay.<br/>
🎧 I need to know what kind of <span>accommodation</span> you'd like,<br/>
🎧 so I can get you something <span>suitable</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can I share a room with <span>someone</span> else?<br/>
🎧 I've been <span>alone</span> in my room at my <span>aunt's<br/></span>
🎧 and I've always <span>shared</span> with my <span>sister</span> and I like that.<br/>
🎧 Yes, fine.<br/>
🎧 <span>That'll</span> <span>save</span> you money too.<br/>
🎧 Would you like to live with a <span>family</span> or do you think that a <span>single</span> person would be better for you?<br/>
🎧 I have lots of very nice <span>single</span> people on my books.<br/>
🎧 Do you have any <span>women</span> living <span>alone</span>, <span>retired</span> <span>women</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I have quite a few whose children have <span>grown</span> up and <span>left</span> home.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, I have some really <span>lovely</span> <span>retired</span> <span>ladies</span>,<br/>
🎧 living by <span>themselves</span>, who just love the company of students.<br/>
🎧 Most of them live in <span>flats</span>, but that's not a <span>problem</span> for you, is it?<br/>
🎧 Not at all. I'm used to that.<br/>
🎧 My <span>aunt</span> lives in a <span>flat</span> too, remember.<br/>
🎧 I'm not used to a big house with a garden, <span>swimming</span> <span>pool</span>, <span>pets</span> and all that.<br/>
🎧 Okay, fine.<br/>
🎧 I know quite a bit about what you want now.<br/>
🎧 I should let you know that your <span>rent</span> will be <span>160</span> <span>dollars</span> <span>per</span> week.<br/>
🎧 You'll have to pay me <span>320</span> <span>dollars</span> as a <span>deposit</span> before you move in.<br/>
🎧 The <span>deposit</span> is as <span>insurance</span>, in case you <span>break</span> something.<br/>
🎧 You'll need to pay <span>monthly</span> to me, by <span>cash</span> or <span>cheque</span>, I don't <span>mind</span>.<br/>
🎧 You don't need to pay for gas, <span>electricity</span> or water,<br/>
🎧 but you will need to pay your <span>proportion</span> of the phone <span>bill</span>.<br/>
🎧 Most <span>families</span> do that on an <span>honour</span> <span>system</span>,<br/>
🎧 but you'll have to wait and see.<br/>
🎧 Have you got any more <span>questions</span> for me?<br/>
🎧 When will you know where I can go?<br/>
🎧 I'll work on it now,<br/>
🎧 so come and see me <span>tomorrow</span> and I should have some <span>news</span> for you then.<br/>
🎧 Thanks a lot.<br/>
🎧 <span>Goodbye</span>. See you <span>tomorrow</span> <span>-</span> after lunch would be better for me.<br/>
🎧 Okay, see you then. Bye.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Good <span>evening</span>,<br/>
🎧 and in this <span>week's</span> <span>edition</span> of <span>'Focus</span> on the <span>Arts'</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>Jane</span> <span>Hemmington</span> is going to <span>fill</span> us in on what's in <span>store</span> for us at this <span>year's</span> <span>Summer</span> <span>Festival</span>.<br/>
🎧 Over to you, <span>Jane</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you, <span>Geoffrey</span>.<br/>
🎧 This year, the <span>Summer</span> <span>Festival</span> is the <span>biggest</span> we've ever <span>seen</span>,<br/>
🎧 so there should be something for <span>everybody</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is the <span>third</span> year <span>they've</span> run it and the <span>timing's</span> <span>slightly</span> <span>different:<br/></span>
🎧 for the last <span>couple</span> of years it's been around the <span>5th</span> to <span>17th</span>,<br/>
🎧 but this year they wanted to <span>allow</span> everyone enough time to <span>recover</span> from the first of <span>January</span> <span>celebrations<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>they've</span> put it at the end of the month.<br/>
🎧 The <span>programme</span> has <span>sensational</span> <span>theatre</span>, <span>dance</span> and also a large number of <span>art</span> <span>exhibitions</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the thing the <span>Festival</span> is most famous for is its great <span>street</span> music.<br/>
🎧 For <span>today's</span> <span>report</span> though, <span>Geoffrey</span>, I'm looking at some of the <span>theatrical</span> <span>events</span> that you might like to <span>see;<br/></span>
🎧 in <span>particular</span>, at this <span>year's</span> <span>theme</span> <span>-</span> <span>circuses</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm going to tell you about two <span>circus</span> <span>performances</span>,<br/>
🎧 but there are <span>plenty</span> of <span>others</span> in the <span>programme</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've <span>chosen</span> these because they <span>represent</span> <span>distinct</span> <span>movements</span> <span>within</span> <span>circus</span> <span>performance</span>.<br/>
🎧 The first is the <span>Circus</span> <span>Romano</span> from <span>Italy</span>.<br/>
🎧 As this is a <span>travelling</span> <span>circus</span>,<br/>
🎧 it <span>follows</span> a long <span>tradition</span> by <span>performing</span> in a <span>marquee</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 which is really like a <span>canvas</span> <span>portable</span> <span>building</span>,<br/>
🎧 usually put up in a <span>green</span> <span>space</span> or car <span>park</span>,<br/>
🎧 rather than in a <span>theatre</span> or <span>stadium</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>spite</span> of this, <span>Circus</span> <span>Romano</span> isn't at all like the <span>traditional</span> <span>circuses</span> I <span>grew</span> up with.<br/>
🎧 There are no <span>animals</span> <span>-</span> just very <span>talented</span> <span>clowning</span> and <span>acrobatic</span> <span>routines</span>.<br/>
🎧 The show has a lot of very funny <span>moments</span>, <span>especially</span> at the <span>beginning</span>,<br/>
🎧 but the best <span>part</span> is the music and <span>lighting</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're <span>magical</span>.<br/>
🎧 At <span>forty-five</span> <span>dollars</span> it's very <span>expensive</span> <span>anyway</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it's really for <span>adult</span> <span>tastes</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, much of it would be <span>wasted</span> on children <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 so I <span>suggest</span> you leave them at home.<br/>
🎧 The second <span>circus</span> <span>performance</span> is <span>Circus</span> <span>Electrica</span> at the <span>Studio</span> <span>Theatre</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>purists</span> are <span>suggesting</span> that this isn't a <span>circus</span> at all.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>showcase</span> for <span>skills</span> in <span>dance</span> and <span>magic</span>,<br/>
🎧 rather than the <span>usual</span> <span>ones</span> you <span>expect</span> in a <span>circus</span>.<br/>
🎧 With only six <span>performers</span> it's a small <span>production</span>, which <span>suits</span> the <span>venue</span> well <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>Studio</span> only <span>seats</span> about <span>200</span> people.<br/>
🎧 For my money, it's the <span>aerial</span> <span>displays</span> which are <span>outstanding<br/></span>
🎧 as well as the <span>magical</span> <span>tricks</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>features</span> which are <span>missing</span> from <span>Circus</span> <span>Romano</span>.<br/>
🎧 An <span>interesting</span> <span>feature</span> of the show is that the <span>performers</span> are so young <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>youngest</span> is only <span>14</span>.<br/>
🎧 But it's still well <span>worth</span> <span>seeing:</span> a good one for the whole <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 And finally, as it's <span>summer</span>,<br/>
🎧 you may wish to see some of the <span>Festival</span> <span>performances</span> that are being <span>presented</span> <span>outdoors</span>.<br/>
🎧 Like the famous <span>Mekong</span> Water <span>Puppet</span> <span>Troupe</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>performing</span> in the <span>City</span> <span>Gardens</span> this week.<br/>
🎧 Now, water <span>puppetry</span> is amazing!<br/>
🎧 It's large <span>puppets</span> on long <span>sticks</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>controlled</span> by <span>puppeteers</span> <span>standing</span> <span>waist</span> <span>deep</span> in the <span>lake</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>puppets</span> do <span>comedy</span> <span>routines</span> and there is some <span>terrific</span> <span>formation</span> <span>dancing</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is a <span>fantastic</span> show and the best <span>moment</span> comes at the end <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>seeing</span> the <span>puppeteers</span>.<br/>
🎧 When the <span>troupe</span> <span>walks</span> up out of the water, you get this amazing feeling.<br/>
🎧 It's really <span>hard</span> to <span>believe</span> that what you've been watching is <span>lifeless</span> <span>wood</span> and <span>cloth</span>.<br/>
🎧 As an <span>adult</span>, I had a great time,<br/>
🎧 but I did <span>note</span> that other <span>older</span> people in the <span>audience</span> weren't quite as taken with it as I was.<br/>
🎧 It's a must for young children though,<br/>
🎧 and that's the <span>audience</span> it's really <span>aimed</span> at.<br/>
🎧 Well, that's all I've time for today,<br/>
🎧 but I'll be back next week with more <span>news</span> of what's <span>worth</span> <span>seeing</span> and what it's best to <span>miss</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Hello.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>Dawn</span> <span>Matthews</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, hello.<br/>
🎧 I've been <span>referred</span> to you because I'm <span>enquiring</span> about the <span>refresher</span> <span>courses</span> that you run.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to find out a bit more about them.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Well, we run quite a few different short <span>courses</span> for students who are either <span>returning</span> to <span>study</span> or <span>studying</span> <span>part-time</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Um</span>, tell me about your <span>situation</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, I think that I really need some help in <span>preparing</span> for the <span>coming</span> <span>semester</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>especially</span> to <span>build</span> up my <span>confidence</span> a <span>bit<br/></span>
🎧 and help me <span>study</span> <span>effectively</span> because, you see,<br/>
🎧 I've been out in the <span>work-force</span> for <span>nearly</span> <span>twelve</span> years now, <span>so..</span>.<br/>
🎧 it really is a long time since I was last a student.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it can <span>seem</span> like a long time, can't it?<br/>
🎧 <span>Um</span>, well, let me start by <span>telling</span> you what <span>courses</span> we have that might <span>suit</span> you.<br/>
🎧 Are you an <span>undergraduate</span> or a <span>postgraduate</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Arts</span> or <span>Sciences</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Undergraduate</span>, and I'm in the <span>Business</span> <span>faculty</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right then.<br/>
🎧 First of all, there's our <span>intensive</span> <span>'Study</span> for <span>Success'</span> <span>seminar<br/></span>
🎧 on the first and second of <span>February</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>aimed</span> at students like you who are <span>uncertain</span> about what to <span>expect</span> at <span>college</span>,<br/>
🎧 and looks at a <span>fairly</span> <span>wide</span> <span>range</span> of <span>approaches</span> to university <span>learning</span>,<br/>
🎧 to <span>motivate</span> you to <span>begin</span> your <span>study<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>build</span> on your own <span>learning</span> <span>strategies</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Mm</span>, that sounds good.<br/>
🎧 What are some of the <span>strategies</span> that are <span>presented</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, we try to <span>cover</span> all <span>aspects</span> of <span>study</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some of the <span>strategies</span> in <span>writing</span>, for example,<br/>
🎧 would be <span>improving</span> your planning for <span>writing</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>organising</span> your <span>thinking<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>building</span> some <span>techniques</span> to help you <span>write</span> more <span>clearly</span>.<br/>
🎧 With <span>reading</span>, <span>there'll</span> be <span>sessions</span> <span>aimed</span> at getting into the <span>habit</span> of <span>analysing</span> <span>material</span> as you read it,<br/>
🎧 and <span>tips</span> to help you <span>record</span> and remember what you have read.<br/>
🎧 It really is very important to <span>begin</span> <span>reading</span> <span>confidently</span> right from the <span>beginning</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's also advice on how to get the most from your <span>lectures<br/></span>
🎧 and practice in <span>giving</span> <span>confident</span> <span>presentations</span>,<br/>
🎧 as well as how to <span>prepare</span> for <span>exams</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about the <span>motivational</span> side of things?<br/>
🎧 Ah. Well, there's a <span>range</span> of <span>motivational</span> <span>exercises</span> that we <span>do<br/></span>
🎧 to help the students feel <span>positive</span> and <span>enthusiastic</span> about their <span>study</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>process</span> of <span>learning</span> and <span>exploring</span> a <span>subject</span> can <span>lead</span> to a whole new way of looking at the <span>world</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>study</span> <span>skills</span> and <span>techniques</span> that you <span>build</span> <span>up<br/></span>
🎧 can be <span>applied</span> in all <span>sorts</span> of different <span>ways</span>.<br/>
🎧 Actually, <span>I..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm very <span>excited</span> about the whole thing of taking up <span>studying</span> again but,<br/>
🎧 you know, I'm a little <span>nervous</span> about <span>whether</span> I'll <span>manage</span> to get everything done.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> it's the same for all <span>mature</span> students?<br/>
🎧 Of course it is.<br/>
🎧 Two of the key <span>components</span> of the course are time <span>management<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>overcoming</span> <span>procrastination</span>.<br/>
🎧 People <span>discover</span> that, once they learn to plan their <span>days</span>,<br/>
🎧 all the work can be <span>accomplished</span> and <span>there'll</span> still be time for <span>leisure</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is there an <span>enrolment</span> <span>fee</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>er</span>, oh, just a <span>minute</span>, let's <span>see..</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ah, the <span>cost</span> is <span>30</span> <span>pounds</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>includes</span> all course <span>materials</span> and morning tea.<br/>
🎧 You have to <span>arrange</span> your own lunch.<br/>
🎧 That wouldn't be a <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 I already make <span>sandwiches</span> for my <span>three</span> <span>kids</span> and my <span>wife</span> and myself every day.<br/>
🎧 I won't have to change my <span>routine</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, I need to tell you that this is a very <span>popular</span> <span>course<br/></span>
🎧 and it's <span>essential</span> that you book well ahead of time.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, the Course <span>Convenor</span> tells me that there are only <span>five</span> <span>places</span> <span>left</span>.<br/>
🎧 What other course might be good for me?<br/>
🎧 There is one other that you could <span>benefit</span> from.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>simply</span> called <span>'Learning</span> <span>Skills</span> for <span>University</span> <span>Study'<br/></span>
🎧 and is on <span>three</span> <span>consecutive</span> <span>mornings<br/></span>
🎧 <span>starting</span> on a <span>Monday</span>, from <span>nine</span> to <span>twelve</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>costs</span> <span>25</span> <span>pounds</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is <span>aimed</span> at <span>upgrading</span> the <span>study</span> <span>skills</span> most <span>school-leavers</span> <span>have<br/></span>
🎧 and help them <span>cope</span> with the <span>increased</span> <span>demands</span> of university <span>study</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>focuses</span> <span>mainly</span> on <span>making</span> students more <span>responsible</span> for their own success.<br/>
🎧 What <span>sort</span> of things are <span>covered</span> in this course?<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>basically</span> it's more <span>advanced</span> thinking,<br/>
🎧 <span>note-taking</span>, <span>reading</span> and <span>writing</span> <span>strategies</span>,<br/>
🎧 but also some <span>input</span> about <span>stress</span> <span>management</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think I'd be better off <span>starting</span> from the <span>basics</span> and looking at all the <span>strategies</span>, don't you?<br/>
🎧 Yes, from what you've told me, I think that's more in <span>line</span> with your <span>situation</span>.<br/>
🎧 Alright then,<br/>
🎧 can I book a place on the <span>'Study</span> for <span>Success'</span> <span>seminar</span> course now?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Let me just get out a <span>registration</span> <span>form</span> and take down your <span>details</span>.<br/>

🎧 but we do feel that it is important that the <span>ultimate</span> <span>beneficiaries</span> of the <span>facilities</span> should have some say in its <span>design</span>.<br/>
🎧 If I could start by <span>briefly</span> <span>explaining</span> what <span>steps</span> were taken to find out student <span>opinion<br/></span>
🎧 and how we have <span>arrived</span> at <span>conclusions</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Firstly</span>, a <span>meeting</span> was <span>held</span> in the <span>current</span> <span>Union</span> for our <span>SU</span> <span>Committee</span> to <span>explain</span> the options.<br/>
🎧 Then we <span>invited</span> all students to <span>submit</span> <span>written</span> <span>suggestions</span> for the <span>design</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>placing</span> <span>cards</span> in a <span>suggestion</span> box.<br/>
🎧 These <span>suggestions</span> then <span>provided</span> the <span>basis</span> for the <span>design</span> of a <span>questionnaire</span>,<br/>
🎧 which was <span>completed</span> by <span>approximately</span> <span>2000</span> of the <span>College</span> <span>students<br/></span>
🎧 over a <span>period</span> of <span>three</span> <span>weeks</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Finally</span>, the <span>SU</span> <span>Committee</span> <span>collated</span> the <span>results</span> and <span>drew</span> up a <span>report</span>.<br/>
🎧 If I can just <span>hand</span> around a <span>copy</span> of that <span>report</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>presentation</span> is <span>essentially</span> a <span>summary</span> and <span>discussion</span> of the key <span>points</span> of this <span>report</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, in <span>broad</span> <span>terms</span>, the <span>consensus</span> was as <span>follows</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Firstly</span>, <span>regarding</span> the <span>crucial</span> <span>matter</span> of the <span>site</span>,<br/>
🎧 we <span>presented</span> the <span>three</span> options that you have <span>proposed</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>One:</span> in the <span>city</span> <span>centre</span>, near the <span>Faculty</span> of <span>Education;<br/></span>
🎧 <span>two:</span> on the <span>outskirts</span> of the <span>city</span>, near the <span>park</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>three:</span> out of <span>town</span>, near the <span>halls</span> of <span>residence</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>asked</span> students to <span>cite</span> <span>reasons</span> for and <span>against</span> these <span>sites</span> and,<br/>
🎧 and there was <span>remarkable</span> <span>agreement</span> on all <span>three</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Site</span> One was <span>unpopular</span> because of <span>traffic</span> and <span>parking</span> <span>problems</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Site</span> Two had a number of <span>supporters</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>mainly</span> because it was <span>close</span> to most <span>lecture</span> <span>rooms</span>.<br/>
🎧 And <span>Site</span> <span>Three</span>, out of <span>town</span>, near the <span>halls</span> of <span>residence</span>,<br/>
🎧 was <span>clearly</span> the most <span>popular</span> because of <span>access</span> from living <span>quarters</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>clear</span> that the <span>Union</span> was <span>mainly</span> to be used after <span>lectures</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was also <span>felt</span> that the <span>larger</span> <span>site</span> would <span>allow</span> more room for a <span>choice</span> of <span>facilities</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our second <span>area</span> of <span>interest</span> was <span>obviously</span> the <span>facilities:<br/></span>
🎧 there was <span>minimal</span> <span>interest</span> in having a <span>library</span> on the <span>premises</span>,<br/>
🎧 but one option <span>seemed</span> to be a <span>reading</span> room <span>instead</span> <span>-</span> more useful.<br/>
🎧 We would like the <span>current</span> <span>table</span> <span>games</span> room to be <span>replaced</span> with a small gym.<br/>
🎧 And, if <span>possible</span>, a small <span>swimming</span> <span>pool</span> <span>-</span> not, of course, <span>Olympic-sized</span>!<br/>
🎧 There was a large number of <span>respondents</span> in <span>favour</span> of a travel <span>agent's</span> and <span>insurance</span> <span>centre</span>.<br/>
🎧 We also <span>request</span> that there be the <span>offices</span> of the <span>Student</span> <span>Counselling</span> <span>Centre</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>moving</span> this from the <span>Refectory</span>.<br/>
🎧 There was, <span>however</span>, much <span>disagreement</span> about <span>whether</span> to <span>build</span> a <span>drama</span> <span>theatre</span>.<br/>
🎧 Just over <span>forty</span> <span>per</span> <span>cent</span> of the <span>respondents</span> were in <span>favour</span>,<br/>
🎧 but a <span>largish</span> <span>minority</span> were <span>strongly</span> <span>against</span> it,<br/>
🎧 <span>claiming</span> that it is <span>elitist</span> and a <span>waste</span> of <span>funds</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Essentially</span> the <span>jury</span> is out on that.<br/>
🎧 <span>Finally</span>, <span>given</span> the number of <span>unfortunate</span> <span>incidents</span> in the <span>current</span> <span>Union</span> over the <span>past</span> few <span>months</span>,<br/>
🎧 a <span>strong</span> <span>point</span> was <span>repeatedly</span> made about <span>security</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>recommendations</span> would be at <span>least</span> <span>video</span> <span>surveillance<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>security</span> <span>personnel</span> who would check <span>Student</span> <span>Union</span> <span>cards</span> on <span>request</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>doubt</span> if it would be <span>feasible</span> to have a check at <span>reception</span> of all people <span>coming</span> in.<br/>
🎧 Well, this is the <span>summary</span> of the <span>views</span> of the student <span>population</span>.<br/>
🎧 As I say, <span>fuller</span> <span>details</span> are <span>given</span> in our <span>report</span> <span>but<br/></span>
🎧 I'm happy to take any <span>questions</span> <span>if..</span>.<br/>
