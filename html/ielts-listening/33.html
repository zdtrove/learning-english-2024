🎧 Hello?<br/>
🎧 Oh, hello.<br/>
🎧 I wanted to <span>enquire about <span>hiring a room in the <span>Village <span>Hall,<br/>
🎧 for the <span>evening of <span>September the first.<br/>
🎧 Let me just <span>see…<br/>
🎧 Yes, we have both <span>rooms <span>available that <span>evening.<br/>
🎧 There's our <span>Main <span>Hall <span>- that's got <span>seating for <span>200 people.<br/>
🎧 Or there's the <span>Charlton <span>Room…<br/>
🎧 Sorry?<br/>
🎧 The <span>Charlton Room <span>- <span>C-H-A-R-L-T-O-N.<br/>
🎧 That's got <span>seating for up to one <span>hundred.<br/>
🎧 Well, we're <span>organising a dinner to <span>raise money for a <span>charity,<br/>
🎧 and we're <span>hoping for at <span>least <span>150 people,<br/>
🎧 so I think we'll go for the <span>Main <span>Hall.<br/>
🎧 How much would that <span>cost?<br/>
🎧 Let's see.<br/>
🎧 You wanted it for the <span>evening of <span>September the <span>1st?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's a <span>Saturday.<br/>
🎧 So from six pm to <span>midnight<br/>
🎧 that'd be <span>£115.<br/>
🎧 That's the weekend <span>price, it's <span>£75 on <span>weekdays.<br/>
🎧 That's all right.<br/>
🎧 And I have to tell you there's also a <span>deposit of <span>£250,<br/>
🎧 which is <span>returnable of course as long as there's no <span>damage.<br/>
🎧 But we do <span>insist that this is <span>paid in <span>cash,<br/>
🎧 we don't take <span>cards for that.<br/>
🎧 You can pay the <span>actual <span>rent of the room <span>however you like though <span>- <span>cash, <span>credit <span>card, <span>cheque…<br/>
🎧 Oh, well I <span>suppose that's OK.<br/>
🎧 So does the <span>charge <span>include use of <span>tables and <span>chairs and so on?<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes.<br/>
🎧 And what about <span>parking?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, that's all <span>included.<br/>
🎧 The only thing that isn't <span>included <span>is…<br/>
🎧 you said you were <span>organising a dinner?<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 Well, you'll have to pay <span>extra for the <span>kitchen if you want to use that.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>£25.<br/>
🎧 It's got very good <span>facilities <span>-<br/>
🎧 good <span>quality <span>cookers and <span>fridges and so on.<br/>
🎧 OK, well I <span>suppose that's all right.<br/>
🎧 We can <span>cover the <span>cost in our <span>entry <span>charges.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So I'll make a <span>note of that.<br/>
🎧 Now there are just one or two things you need to think about before the <span>event.<br/>
🎧 For example, you'll have to see about getting a <span>licence if you're planning to have any music during the <span>meal.<br/>
🎧 Oh, really?<br/>
🎧 It's quite <span>straightforward, I'll give you the <span>details later on.<br/>
🎧 And about a week or ten <span>days before your <span>event you'll need to <span>contact the <span>caretaker, that's Mr <span>Evans,<br/>
🎧 to make the <span>arrangements for <span>entry <span>-<br/>
🎧 he'll <span>sort that out with you.<br/>
🎧 And do I give him the <span>payment as well?<br/>
🎧 No, you do that <span>directly with me.<br/>
🎧 Right. Now is there anything I need to know about what <span>happens during the <span>event?<br/>
🎧 Well, as you'll be <span>aware, of course the <span>building is no <span>smoking <span>throughout.<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 Now, are you having a <span>band?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Well, they'll have a lot of <span>equipment,<br/>
🎧 so rather than <span>using the <span>front <span>door they should <span>park their <span>van <span>round the <span>back<br/>
🎧 and use the <span>stage <span>door there.<br/>
🎧 You can open that from inside but don't <span>forget to <span>lock it at the end.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And talking of <span>bands, I'm sure I don't need to tell you this,<br/>
🎧 but you must make sure that no one <span>fiddles about with the <span>black box by the <span>fire <span>door <span>-<br/>
🎧 that's a <span>system that <span>cuts in when the <span>volume <span>reaches a <span>certain <span>level.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>legal <span>requirement.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway, we want people to be able to talk to one <span>another<br/>
🎧 so we don't want anything too <span>loud.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that <span>reminds me, we'll be having <span>speeches.<br/>
🎧 Are there any <span>microphones <span>available?<br/>
🎧 Yeah. Just let the <span>caretaker know, he'll get those for you.<br/>
🎧 Right, now when the <span>event is over we do ask that the <span>premises are <span>left in good <span>condition.<br/>
🎧 So there's a <span>locked <span>cupboard<br/>
🎧 and you'll be <span>informed of the <span>code you need to open that.<br/>
🎧 It's got all the <span>cleaning <span>equipment, <span>brushes and <span>detergent and so on.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So what do we need to do after <span>everyone's <span>gone?<br/>
🎧 <span>Sweep the <span>floors I <span>suppose?<br/>
🎧 Well, actually they have to be <span>washed, not just <span>swept.<br/>
🎧 Then you'll be <span>provided with <span>black <span>plastic <span>bags,<br/>
🎧 so all the <span>rubbish must be <span>collected up and <span>left outside the <span>door.<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 We'll make sure <span>everything's <span>left <span>tidy.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and I <span>forgot to ask,<br/>
🎧 I <span>presume we can have <span>decorations in the room?<br/>
🎧 Yes, but you must take them down <span>afterwards.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>chairs and <span>tables should be <span>stacked up <span>neatly at the back of the room.<br/>
🎧 I'll make sure I've got a few people to help me.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 <span>Welcome to the <span>Fiddy Working <span>Heritage <span>Farm.<br/>
🎧 This <span>open-air <span>museum <span>gives you the <span>experience of <span>agriculture and <span>rural life in the English <span>countryside at the end of the <span>19th <span>century.<br/>
🎧 So you'll see a <span>typical <span>farm of that <span>period,<br/>
🎧 and like me, all the <span>staff are <span>dressed in <span>clothes of that time.<br/>
🎧 I must give you some advice and <span>safety <span>tips before we go any <span>further.<br/>
🎧 As it's a working <span>farm, please don't <span>frighten or <span>injure the <span>animals.<br/>
🎧 We have a lot here, and many of them are <span>breeds that are now quite <span>rare.<br/>
🎧 And do <span>stay at a <span>safe <span>distance from the <span>tools:<br/>
🎧 some of them have <span>sharp <span>points which can be <span>pretty <span>dangerous,<br/>
🎧 so please don't touch them.<br/>
🎧 We don't want any <span>accidents, do we?<br/>
🎧 The <span>ground is very <span>uneven,<br/>
🎧 and you might <span>slip if you're <span>wearing <span>sandals<br/>
🎧 so I'm glad to see you're all <span>wearing <span>shoes <span>-<br/>
🎧 we always <span>advise people to do that.<br/>
🎧 Now, children of all <span>ages are very <span>welcome here,<br/>
🎧 and usually even very young children love the <span>ducks and <span>lambs,<br/>
🎧 so do <span>bring them along next time you come.<br/>
🎧 I don't think any of you have <span>brought <span>dogs with you,<br/>
🎧 but in case you have, I'm <span>afraid they'll have to <span>stay in the car <span>park <span>unless they're <span>guide <span>dogs.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you'll <span>understand that they could <span>cause a lot of <span>problems on a <span>farm.<br/>
🎧 Now let me give you some idea of the <span>layout of the <span>farm.<br/>
🎧 The <span>building where you <span>bought your <span>tickets is the New <span>Barn, <span>immediately to your right,<br/>
🎧 and we're now at the <span>beginning of the <span>main <span>path to the <span>farmland <span>-<br/>
🎧 and of course the car <span>park is on your <span>left.<br/>
🎧 The <span>scarecrow you can see in the car <span>park in the <span>corner, <span>beside the <span>main <span>path,<br/>
🎧 is a <span>traditional <span>figure for <span>keeping the <span>birds away from <span>crops,<br/>
🎧 but our <span>scarecrow is a <span>permanent <span>sculpture.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>taller than a <span>human being, so you can see it from quite a <span>distance.<br/>
🎧 If you look ahead of you, you'll see a <span>maze.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>opposite the New <span>Barn, <span>beside the side <span>path that <span>branches off to the right just over there.<br/>
🎧 The <span>maze is made out of <span>hedges which are too <span>tall for young children to see over them,<br/>
🎧 but it's quite small, so you can't get <span>lost in it!<br/>
🎧 Now, can you see the <span>bridge <span>crossing the <span>fish <span>pool <span>further up the <span>main <span>path?<br/>
🎧 If you want to go to the <span>café, go <span>towards the <span>bridge and <span>turn right just before it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Walk along the side <span>path and the <span>café's on the first <span>bend you come to.<br/>
🎧 The <span>building was <span>originally the <span>schoolhouse, and it's well over a <span>hundred years old.<br/>
🎧 As you may know, we run <span>skills <span>workshops here,<br/>
🎧 where you can learn <span>traditional <span>crafts like <span>woodwork and <span>basket-making.<br/>
🎧 You can see <span>examples of the work, and talk to <span>someone about the <span>courses, in the <span>Black <span>Barn.<br/>
🎧 If you take the side <span>path to the right, here, just by the New <span>Barn,<br/>
🎧 you'll come to the <span>Black <span>Barn just where the <span>path first <span>bends.<br/>
🎧 Now I mustn't <span>forget to tell you about <span>picnicking,<br/>
🎧 as I can see some of you have <span>brought your lunch with you.<br/>
🎧 You can <span>picnic in the <span>field, though do <span>clear up behind you, of course.<br/>
🎧 Or if you'd <span>prefer a <span>covered <span>picnic <span>area, there's one near the <span>farmyard:<br/>
🎧 just after you <span>cross the <span>bridge,<br/>
🎧 there's a <span>covered <span>picnic <span>spot on the right.<br/>
🎧 And the last thing to <span>mention is <span>Fiddy House <span>itself.<br/>
🎧 From here you can <span>cross the <span>bridge<br/>
🎧 then <span>walk along the <span>footpath through the <span>field to the <span>left of the <span>farmyard.<br/>
🎧 That <span>goes to the house, and it'll give you a <span>lovely <span>view of it.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>certainly <span>worth a few <span>photographs,<br/>
🎧 but as it's a <span>private home, I'm <span>afraid you can't go inside.<br/>
🎧 Right. Well, if you're all ready, we'll set off on our <span>tour of the <span>farm.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 OK, <span>Greg, so I finally <span>managed to read the <span>article you <span>mentioned <span>-<br/>
🎧 the one about the <span>study on <span>gender in <span>physics.<br/>
🎧 About the <span>study of <span>college students done by <span>Akira <span>Miyake and his <span>team?<br/>
🎧 I was interested that the <span>researchers were actually a mix of <span>psychologists and <span>physicists.<br/>
🎧 That's an <span>unusual <span>combination.<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 I got a little <span>confused at first about which students the <span>study was <span>based on.<br/>
🎧 They weren't actually <span>majoring in <span>physics <span>-<br/>
🎧 they were <span>majoring in what's <span>known as the <span>STEM <span>disciplines.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>science, <span>technology, <span>engineering <span>and… and <span>math.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but they were all doing <span>physics <span>courses as <span>part of their <span>studies.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>correct.<br/>
🎧 So as I <span>understood it,<br/>
🎧 <span>Miyake and <span>co <span>started from the <span>fact that <span>women are <span>underrepresented<br/>
🎧 in <span>introductory <span>physics <span>courses at <span>college,<br/>
🎧 and also that on <span>average,<br/>
🎧 the <span>women who do <span>enrol on these <span>courses <span>perform more <span>poorly than the men.<br/>
🎧 No one really <span>knows why this is the case.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. But what the <span>researchers wanted to find <span>out<br/>
🎧 was <span>basically what they could do about the <span>relatively low <span>level of the <span>women's <span>results.<br/>
🎧 But in order to find a <span>solution<br/>
🎧 they <span>needed to find out more about the <span>nature of the <span>problem.<br/>
🎧 Right <span>- now let's see if I can <span>remember…<br/>
🎧 it was that in the <span>physics class,<br/>
🎧 the <span>female students thought the <span>male students all <span>assumed that <span>women weren't any good at <span>physics…<br/>
🎧 was that it?<br/>
🎧 And they thought that the men <span>expected them to get <span>poor <span>results in their <span>tests.<br/>
🎧 That's what the <span>women thought, and that made them <span>nervous, so they did get <span>poor <span>results.<br/>
🎧 But actually they were <span>wrong…<br/>
🎧 No one was <span>making any <span>assumptions about the <span>female students at all.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway, what <span>Miyake's <span>team did was quite simple <span>-<br/>
🎧 getting the students to do some <span>writing before they went into the <span>physics class.<br/>
🎧 What did they call it?<br/>
🎧 <span>Values-affirmation <span>-<br/>
🎧 they had to <span>write an <span>essay <span>focusing on things that were <span>significant to them,<br/>
🎧 not <span>particularly to do with the <span>subject they were <span>studying,<br/>
🎧 but more <span>general things like music or people who <span>mattered to them.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So the idea of doing the <span>writing is that this <span>gets the students thinking in a <span>positive way.<br/>
🎧 And <span>putting these <span>thoughts into <span>words can <span>relax them and help them <span>overcome the <span>psychological <span>factors<br/>
🎧 that <span>lead to <span>poor <span>performance. Yeah.<br/>
🎧 But what the <span>researchers in the <span>study hadn't <span>expected<br/>
🎧 was that this one <span>activity <span>raised the <span>women's <span>physics <span>grades from the <span>C to the <span>B <span>range.<br/>
🎧 A <span>huge change.<br/>
🎧 <span>Pity it wasn't to an A, but still!<br/>
🎧 No, but it does <span>suggest that the <span>women were <span>seriously <span>underperforming <span>beforehand, in <span>comparison with the men.<br/>
🎧 Yes. <span>Mind you, <span>Miyake's <span>article <span>left out a lot of <span>details.<br/>
🎧 Like, did the students do the <span>writing just once, or <span>several <span>times?<br/>
🎧 And had they been told why they were doing the <span>writing?<br/>
🎧 That might have <span>affected the <span>results.<br/>
🎧 You mean, if they know the <span>researchers thought it might help them to <span>improve,<br/>
🎧 then they'd just try to <span>fulfill that <span>expectation?<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 So <span>anyway, I thought for our <span>project we could do a <span>similar <span>study,<br/>
🎧 but <span>investigate <span>whether it really was the <span>writing <span>activity that had that <span>result.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So we could ask them to do a <span>writing <span>task about something <span>completely <span>different…<br/>
🎧 something more <span>factual?<br/>
🎧 Like a <span>general <span>knowledge <span>topic.<br/>
🎧 <span>Maybe…<br/>
🎧 or we could have <span>half the students doing a <span>writing <span>task<br/>
🎧 and <span>half doing something else, like an <span>oral <span>task.<br/>
🎧 Or even, <span>half do the same <span>writing <span>task as in the <span>original <span>research<br/>
🎧 and <span>half do a <span>factual <span>writing <span>task.<br/>
🎧 Then we'd see if it really is the <span>topic that made the <span>difference, or something else.<br/>
🎧 That's it. Good.<br/>
🎧 So at our <span>meeting with the <span>supervisor on <span>Monday<br/>
🎧 we can tell him we've <span>decided on our <span>project.<br/>
🎧 We should have our <span>aims ready by then.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose we need to read the <span>original <span>study <span>- the <span>article's just a <span>summary.<br/>
🎧 And there was another <span>article I read, by <span>Smolinsky.<br/>
🎧 It was about her <span>research on how <span>women and men <span>perform in <span>mixed <span>teams in class,<br/>
🎧 <span>compared with <span>single-sex <span>teams and on their own.<br/>
🎧 Let me <span>guess… the <span>women were better at <span>teamwork.<br/>
🎧 That's what I <span>expected,<br/>
🎧 but actually the men and the <span>women got the same <span>results<br/>
🎧 <span>whether they were working in <span>teams or on their own.<br/>
🎧 But I <span>guess it's not that <span>relevant to us.<br/>
🎧 What <span>worries me <span>anyway is how we're going to get everything done in the time.<br/>
🎧 We'll be OK now we know what we're doing.<br/>
🎧 Though I'm not <span>clear how we <span>assess <span>whether the students in our <span>experiment actually make any <span>progress or <span>not…<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 We may need some advice on that.<br/>
🎧 The <span>main <span>thing's to make sure we have the right size <span>sample,<br/>
🎧 not too big or too small.<br/>
🎧 That shouldn't be <span>difficult.<br/>
🎧 Right, what do we need to do next?<br/>
🎧 We could have a look at the <span>timetable for the <span>science <span>classes…<br/>
🎧 or <span>perhaps we should just make an <span>appointment to see one of the <span>science <span>professors.<br/>
🎧 That'd be better.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 And we could even get to <span>observe one of the <span>classes.<br/>
🎧 What for?<br/>
🎧 <span>Well… OK maybe let's just go with your idea.<br/>
🎧 Right, <span>well…<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 I've been looking at <span>ocean <span>biodiversity,<br/>
🎧 that's the <span>diversity of <span>species that live in the <span>world's <span>oceans.<br/>
🎧 About <span>20 years ago,<br/>
🎧 <span>biologists <span>developed the idea of what they called <span>'biodiversity <span>hotspots'.<br/>
🎧 These are the <span>areas which have the <span>greatest <span>mixture of <span>species,<br/>
🎧 so one example is <span>Madagascar.<br/>
🎧 These <span>hotspots are <span>significant<br/>
🎧 because they <span>allow us to <span>locate key <span>areas for <span>focusing <span>efforts at <span>conservation.<br/>
🎧 <span>Biologists can <span>identify <span>hotspots on <span>land, <span>fairly <span>easily,<br/>
🎧 but until <span>recently, very little was <span>known about <span>species <span>distribution and <span>diversity in the <span>oceans,<br/>
🎧 and no one even <span>knew if <span>hotspots <span>existed there.<br/>
🎧 Then a <span>Canadian <span>biologist called <span>Boris <span>Worm<br/>
🎧 did some <span>research in <span>2005 on <span>data on <span>ocean <span>species that he got from the <span>fishing <span>industry.<br/>
🎧 <span>Worm <span>located <span>five <span>hotspots for large <span>ocean <span>predators like <span>sharks,<br/>
🎧 and <span>looked at what they had in <span>common.<br/>
🎧 The <span>main thing he'd <span>expected to find was that they had very high <span>concentrations of food,<br/>
🎧 but to his <span>surprise that was only <span>true for <span>four of the <span>hotspots <span>-<br/>
🎧 the <span>remaining <span>hotspot was quite <span>badly off in that <span>regard.<br/>
🎧 But what he did find was that in all <span>cases,<br/>
🎧 the water at the <span>surface of the <span>ocean had <span>relatively high <span>temperatures,<br/>
🎧 even when it was <span>cool at <span>greater <span>depths,<br/>
🎧 so this <span>seemed to be a <span>factor in <span>supporting a <span>diverse <span>range of these large <span>predators.<br/>
🎧 <span>However, this wasn't enough on its own,<br/>
🎧 because he also <span>found that the water <span>needed to have enough <span>oxygen in it <span>-<br/>
🎧 so these two <span>factors <span>seemed <span>necessary to <span>support the high <span>metabolic <span>rate of these large <span>fish.<br/>
🎧 A <span>couple of years later, in <span>2007,<br/>
🎧 a <span>researcher called <span>Lisa <span>Balance, who was working in <span>California,<br/>
🎧 also <span>started looking for <span>ocean <span>hotspots, but not for <span>fish <span>-<br/>
🎧 what she was interested in was <span>marine <span>mammals, things like <span>seals.<br/>
🎧 And she <span>found <span>three <span>places in the <span>oceans which were <span>hotspots,<br/>
🎧 and what these had in <span>common was that these <span>hotspots were all <span>located at <span>boundaries between <span>ocean <span>currents,<br/>
🎧 and this <span>seems to be the <span>sort of place that has lots of the <span>plankton that some of these <span>species <span>feed on.<br/>
🎧 So now people who want to <span>protect the <span>species that are <span>endangered need to get as much <span>information as <span>possible.<br/>
🎧 For example, there's an <span>international <span>project called the <span>Census of <span>Marine Life.<br/>
🎧 <span>They've been <span>surveying <span>oceans all over the <span>world, <span>including the <span>Arctic.<br/>
🎧 One thing they <span>found there which <span>stunned other <span>researchers<br/>
🎧 was that there were large <span>numbers of <span>species which live <span>below the ice <span>-<br/>
🎧 sometimes under a <span>layer up to <span>20 <span>metres <span>thick.<br/>
🎧 Some of these <span>species had never been <span>seen before.<br/>
🎧 <span>They've even <span>found <span>species of <span>octopus living in these <span>conditions.<br/>
🎧 And other <span>scientists working on the same <span>project,<br/>
🎧 but <span>researching very different <span>habitats on the <span>ocean <span>floor,<br/>
🎧 have <span>found large <span>numbers of <span>species <span>congregating around <span>volcanoes,<br/>
🎧 <span>attracted to them by the <span>warmth and <span>nutrients there.<br/>
🎧 <span>However, <span>biologists still don't know how serious the <span>threat to their <span>survival is for each <span>individual <span>species.<br/>
🎧 So a <span>body called the <span>Global <span>Marine <span>Species <span>Assessment is now <span>creating a <span>list of <span>endangered <span>species on <span>land,<br/>
🎧 so they <span>consider things like the size of the <span>population <span>-<br/>
🎧 how many <span>members of one <span>species there are in a <span>particular place <span>-<br/>
🎧 and then they look at their <span>distribution in <span>geographical <span>terms,<br/>
🎧 although this is quite <span>difficult when you're looking at <span>fish, because they're so <span>mobile,<br/>
🎧 and then <span>thirdly they <span>calculate the <span>rate at which the <span>decline of the <span>species is <span>happening.<br/>
🎧 So <span>far only <span>1,500 <span>species have been <span>assessed,<br/>
🎧 but they want to <span>increase this <span>figure to <span>20,000.<br/>
🎧 For each one they <span>assess,<br/>
🎧 they use the <span>data they <span>collect on that <span>species to <span>produce a map <span>showing its <span>distribution.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ultimately they will be able to use these to <span>figure out not only where most <span>species are <span>located<br/>
🎧 but also where they are most <span>threatened.<br/>
🎧 So finally, what can be done to <span>retain the <span>diversity of <span>species in the <span>world's <span>oceans?<br/>
🎧 <span>Firstly, we need to set up more <span>reserves in our <span>oceans,<br/>
🎧 <span>places where <span>marine <span>species are <span>protected.<br/>
🎧 We have some, but not enough.<br/>
🎧 In <span>addition, to <span>preserve <span>species such as <span>leatherback <span>turtles,<br/>
🎧 which live out in the high <span>seas but have their <span>nesting <span>sites on the <span>American <span>coast,<br/>
🎧 we need to <span>create <span>corridors for <span>migration,<br/>
🎧 so they can get from one <span>area to another <span>safely.<br/>
🎧 As well as this, <span>action needs to be taken to <span>lower the <span>levels of <span>fishing <span>quotas<br/>
🎧 to <span>prevent <span>overfishing of <span>endangered <span>species.<br/>
🎧 And finally, there's the <span>problem of <span>'by-catch'.<br/>
🎧 This <span>refers to the <span>catching of <span>unwanted <span>fish by <span>fishing <span>boats <span>-<br/>
🎧 they're <span>returned to the sea, but they're often <span>dead or <span>dying.<br/>
🎧 If these <span>commercial <span>fishing <span>boats used <span>equipment which was more <span>selective,<br/>
🎧 so that only the <span>fish wanted for <span>consumption were <span>caught,<br/>
🎧 this <span>problem could be <span>overcome.<br/>
🎧 OK. So does <span>anyone have <span>any…<br/>
