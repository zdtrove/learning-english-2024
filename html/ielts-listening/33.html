🎧 Hello?<br/>
🎧 Oh, hello.<br/>
🎧 I wanted to enquire about hiring a room in the Village Hall,<br/>
🎧 for the evening of September the first.<br/>
🎧 Let me just see…<br/>
🎧 Yes, we have both rooms available that evening.<br/>
🎧 There's our Main Hall - that's got seating for 200 people.<br/>
🎧 Or there's the Charlton Room…<br/>
🎧 Sorry?<br/>
🎧 The Charlton Room - C-H-A-R-L-T-O-N.<br/>
🎧 That's got seating for up to one hundred.<br/>
🎧 Well, we're organising a dinner to raise money for a charity,<br/>
🎧 and we're hoping for at least 150 people,<br/>
🎧 so I think we'll go for the Main Hall.<br/>
🎧 How much would that cost?<br/>
🎧 Let's see.<br/>
🎧 You wanted it for the evening of September the 1st?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's a Saturday.<br/>
🎧 So from six pm to midnight<br/>
🎧 that'd be £115.<br/>
🎧 That's the weekend price, it's £75 on weekdays.<br/>
🎧 That's all right.<br/>
🎧 And I have to tell you there's also a deposit of £250,<br/>
🎧 which is returnable of course as long as there's no damage.<br/>
🎧 But we do insist that this is paid in cash,<br/>
🎧 we don't take cards for that.<br/>
🎧 You can pay the actual rent of the room however you like though - cash, credit card, cheque…<br/>
🎧 Oh, well I suppose that's OK.<br/>
🎧 So does the charge include use of tables and chairs and so on?<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes.<br/>
🎧 And what about parking?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, that's all included.<br/>
🎧 The only thing that isn't included is…<br/>
🎧 you said you were organising a dinner?<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 Well, you'll have to pay extra for the kitchen if you want to use that.<br/>
🎧 It's £25.<br/>
🎧 It's got very good facilities -<br/>
🎧 good quality cookers and fridges and so on.<br/>
🎧 OK, well I suppose that's all right.<br/>
🎧 We can cover the cost in our entry charges.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So I'll make a note of that.<br/>
🎧 Now there are just one or two things you need to think about before the event.<br/>
🎧 For example, you'll have to see about getting a licence if you're planning to have any music during the meal.<br/>
🎧 Oh, really?<br/>
🎧 It's quite straightforward, I'll give you the details later on.<br/>
🎧 And about a week or ten days before your event you'll need to contact the caretaker, that's Mr Evans,<br/>
🎧 to make the arrangements for entry -<br/>
🎧 he'll sort that out with you.<br/>
🎧 And do I give him the payment as well?<br/>
🎧 No, you do that directly with me.<br/>
🎧 Right. Now is there anything I need to know about what happens during the event?<br/>
🎧 Well, as you'll be aware, of course the building is no smoking throughout.<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 Now, are you having a band?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Well, they'll have a lot of equipment,<br/>
🎧 so rather than using the front door they should park their van round the back<br/>
🎧 and use the stage door there.<br/>
🎧 You can open that from inside but don't forget to lock it at the end.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And talking of bands, I'm sure I don't need to tell you this,<br/>
🎧 but you must make sure that no one fiddles about with the black box by the fire door -<br/>
🎧 that's a system that cuts in when the volume reaches a certain level.<br/>
🎧 It's a legal requirement.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 Anyway, we want people to be able to talk to one another<br/>
🎧 so we don't want anything too loud.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that reminds me, we'll be having speeches.<br/>
🎧 Are there any microphones available?<br/>
🎧 Yeah. Just let the caretaker know, he'll get those for you.<br/>
🎧 Right, now when the event is over we do ask that the premises are left in good condition.<br/>
🎧 So there's a locked cupboard<br/>
🎧 and you'll be informed of the code you need to open that.<br/>
🎧 It's got all the cleaning equipment, brushes and detergent and so on.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So what do we need to do after everyone's gone?<br/>
🎧 Sweep the floors I suppose?<br/>
🎧 Well, actually they have to be washed, not just swept.<br/>
🎧 Then you'll be provided with black plastic bags,<br/>
🎧 so all the rubbish must be collected up and left outside the door.<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 We'll make sure everything's left tidy.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and I forgot to ask,<br/>
🎧 I presume we can have decorations in the room?<br/>
🎧 Yes, but you must take them down afterwards.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 And the chairs and tables should be stacked up neatly at the back of the room.<br/>
🎧 I'll make sure I've got a few people to help me.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Welcome to the Fiddy Working Heritage Farm.<br/>
🎧 This open-air museum gives you the experience of agriculture and rural life in the English countryside at the end of the 19th century.<br/>
🎧 So you'll see a typical farm of that period,<br/>
🎧 and like me, all the staff are dressed in clothes of that time.<br/>
🎧 I must give you some advice and safety tips before we go any further.<br/>
🎧 As it's a working farm, please don't frighten or injure the animals.<br/>
🎧 We have a lot here, and many of them are breeds that are now quite rare.<br/>
🎧 And do stay at a safe distance from the tools:<br/>
🎧 some of them have sharp points which can be pretty dangerous,<br/>
🎧 so please don't touch them.<br/>
🎧 We don't want any accidents, do we?<br/>
🎧 The ground is very uneven,<br/>
🎧 and you might slip if you're wearing sandals<br/>
🎧 so I'm glad to see you're all wearing shoes -<br/>
🎧 we always advise people to do that.<br/>
🎧 Now, children of all ages are very welcome here,<br/>
🎧 and usually even very young children love the ducks and lambs,<br/>
🎧 so do bring them along next time you come.<br/>
🎧 I don't think any of you have brought dogs with you,<br/>
🎧 but in case you have, I'm afraid they'll have to stay in the car park unless they're guide dogs.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you'll understand that they could cause a lot of problems on a farm.<br/>
🎧 Now let me give you some idea of the layout of the farm.<br/>
🎧 The building where you bought your tickets is the New Barn, immediately to your right,<br/>
🎧 and we're now at the beginning of the main path to the farmland -<br/>
🎧 and of course the car park is on your left.<br/>
🎧 The scarecrow you can see in the car park in the corner, beside the main path,<br/>
🎧 is a traditional figure for keeping the birds away from crops,<br/>
🎧 but our scarecrow is a permanent sculpture.<br/>
🎧 It's taller than a human being, so you can see it from quite a distance.<br/>
🎧 If you look ahead of you, you'll see a maze.<br/>
🎧 It's opposite the New Barn, beside the side path that branches off to the right just over there.<br/>
🎧 The maze is made out of hedges which are too tall for young children to see over them,<br/>
🎧 but it's quite small, so you can't get lost in it!<br/>
🎧 Now, can you see the bridge crossing the fish pool further up the main path?<br/>
🎧 If you want to go to the café, go towards the bridge and turn right just before it.<br/>
🎧 Walk along the side path and the café's on the first bend you come to.<br/>
🎧 The building was originally the schoolhouse, and it's well over a hundred years old.<br/>
🎧 As you may know, we run skills workshops here,<br/>
🎧 where you can learn traditional crafts like woodwork and basket-making.<br/>
🎧 You can see examples of the work, and talk to someone about the courses, in the Black Barn.<br/>
🎧 If you take the side path to the right, here, just by the New Barn,<br/>
🎧 you'll come to the Black Barn just where the path first bends.<br/>
🎧 Now I mustn't forget to tell you about picnicking,<br/>
🎧 as I can see some of you have brought your lunch with you.<br/>
🎧 You can picnic in the field, though do clear up behind you, of course.<br/>
🎧 Or if you'd prefer a covered picnic area, there's one near the farmyard:<br/>
🎧 just after you cross the bridge,<br/>
🎧 there's a covered picnic spot on the right.<br/>
🎧 And the last thing to mention is Fiddy House itself.<br/>
🎧 From here you can cross the bridge<br/>
🎧 then walk along the footpath through the field to the left of the farmyard.<br/>
🎧 That goes to the house, and it'll give you a lovely view of it.<br/>
🎧 It's certainly worth a few photographs,<br/>
🎧 but as it's a private home, I'm afraid you can't go inside.<br/>
🎧 Right. Well, if you're all ready, we'll set off on our tour of the farm.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 OK, Greg, so I finally managed to read the article you mentioned -<br/>
🎧 the one about the study on gender in physics.<br/>
🎧 About the study of college students done by Akira Miyake and his team?<br/>
🎧 I was interested that the researchers were actually a mix of psychologists and physicists.<br/>
🎧 That's an unusual combination.<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 I got a little confused at first about which students the study was based on.<br/>
🎧 They weren't actually majoring in physics -<br/>
🎧 they were majoring in what's known as the STEM disciplines.<br/>
🎧 That's science, technology, engineering and… and math.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but they were all doing physics courses as part of their studies.<br/>
🎧 That's correct.<br/>
🎧 So as I understood it,<br/>
🎧 Miyake and co started from the fact that women are underrepresented<br/>
🎧 in introductory physics courses at college,<br/>
🎧 and also that on average,<br/>
🎧 the women who do enrol on these courses perform more poorly than the men.<br/>
🎧 No one really knows why this is the case.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. But what the researchers wanted to find out<br/>
🎧 was basically what they could do about the relatively low level of the women's results.<br/>
🎧 But in order to find a solution<br/>
🎧 they needed to find out more about the nature of the problem.<br/>
🎧 Right - now let's see if I can remember…<br/>
🎧 it was that in the physics class,<br/>
🎧 the female students thought the male students all assumed that women weren't any good at physics…<br/>
🎧 was that it?<br/>
🎧 And they thought that the men expected them to get poor results in their tests.<br/>
🎧 That's what the women thought, and that made them nervous, so they did get poor results.<br/>
🎧 But actually they were wrong…<br/>
🎧 No one was making any assumptions about the female students at all.<br/>
🎧 Anyway, what Miyake's team did was quite simple -<br/>
🎧 getting the students to do some writing before they went into the physics class.<br/>
🎧 What did they call it?<br/>
🎧 Values-affirmation -<br/>
🎧 they had to write an essay focusing on things that were significant to them,<br/>
🎧 not particularly to do with the subject they were studying,<br/>
🎧 but more general things like music or people who mattered to them.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So the idea of doing the writing is that this gets the students thinking in a positive way.<br/>
🎧 And putting these thoughts into words can relax them and help them overcome the psychological factors<br/>
🎧 that lead to poor performance. Yeah.<br/>
🎧 But what the researchers in the study hadn't expected<br/>
🎧 was that this one activity raised the women's physics grades from the C to the B range.<br/>
🎧 A huge change.<br/>
🎧 Pity it wasn't to an A, but still!<br/>
🎧 No, but it does suggest that the women were seriously underperforming beforehand, in comparison with the men.<br/>
🎧 Yes. Mind you, Miyake's article left out a lot of details.<br/>
🎧 Like, did the students do the writing just once, or several times?<br/>
🎧 And had they been told why they were doing the writing?<br/>
🎧 That might have affected the results.<br/>
🎧 You mean, if they know the researchers thought it might help them to improve,<br/>
🎧 then they'd just try to fulfill that expectation?<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 So anyway, I thought for our project we could do a similar study,<br/>
🎧 but investigate whether it really was the writing activity that had that result.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So we could ask them to do a writing task about something completely different…<br/>
🎧 something more factual?<br/>
🎧 Like a general knowledge topic.<br/>
🎧 Maybe…<br/>
🎧 or we could have half the students doing a writing task<br/>
🎧 and half doing something else, like an oral task.<br/>
🎧 Or even, half do the same writing task as in the original research<br/>
🎧 and half do a factual writing task.<br/>
🎧 Then we'd see if it really is the topic that made the difference, or something else.<br/>
🎧 That's it. Good.<br/>
🎧 So at our meeting with the supervisor on Monday<br/>
🎧 we can tell him we've decided on our project.<br/>
🎧 We should have our aims ready by then.<br/>
🎧 I suppose we need to read the original study - the article's just a summary.<br/>
🎧 And there was another article I read, by Smolinsky.<br/>
🎧 It was about her research on how women and men perform in mixed teams in class,<br/>
🎧 compared with single-sex teams and on their own.<br/>
🎧 Let me guess… the women were better at teamwork.<br/>
🎧 That's what I expected,<br/>
🎧 but actually the men and the women got the same results<br/>
🎧 whether they were working in teams or on their own.<br/>
🎧 But I guess it's not that relevant to us.<br/>
🎧 What worries me anyway is how we're going to get everything done in the time.<br/>
🎧 We'll be OK now we know what we're doing.<br/>
🎧 Though I'm not clear how we assess whether the students in our experiment actually make any progress or not…<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 We may need some advice on that.<br/>
🎧 The main thing's to make sure we have the right size sample,<br/>
🎧 not too big or too small.<br/>
🎧 That shouldn't be difficult.<br/>
🎧 Right, what do we need to do next?<br/>
🎧 We could have a look at the timetable for the science classes…<br/>
🎧 or perhaps we should just make an appointment to see one of the science professors.<br/>
🎧 That'd be better.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 And we could even get to observe one of the classes.<br/>
🎧 What for?<br/>
🎧 Well… OK maybe let's just go with your idea.<br/>
🎧 Right, well…<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 I've been looking at ocean biodiversity,<br/>
🎧 that's the diversity of species that live in the world's oceans.<br/>
🎧 About 20 years ago,<br/>
🎧 biologists developed the idea of what they called 'biodiversity hotspots'.<br/>
🎧 These are the areas which have the greatest mixture of species,<br/>
🎧 so one example is Madagascar.<br/>
🎧 These hotspots are significant<br/>
🎧 because they allow us to locate key areas for focusing efforts at conservation.<br/>
🎧 Biologists can identify hotspots on land, fairly easily,<br/>
🎧 but until recently, very little was known about species distribution and diversity in the oceans,<br/>
🎧 and no one even knew if hotspots existed there.<br/>
🎧 Then a Canadian biologist called Boris Worm<br/>
🎧 did some research in 2005 on data on ocean species that he got from the fishing industry.<br/>
🎧 Worm located five hotspots for large ocean predators like sharks,<br/>
🎧 and looked at what they had in common.<br/>
🎧 The main thing he'd expected to find was that they had very high concentrations of food,<br/>
🎧 but to his surprise that was only true for four of the hotspots -<br/>
🎧 the remaining hotspot was quite badly off in that regard.<br/>
🎧 But what he did find was that in all cases,<br/>
🎧 the water at the surface of the ocean had relatively high temperatures,<br/>
🎧 even when it was cool at greater depths,<br/>
🎧 so this seemed to be a factor in supporting a diverse range of these large predators.<br/>
🎧 However, this wasn't enough on its own,<br/>
🎧 because he also found that the water needed to have enough oxygen in it -<br/>
🎧 so these two factors seemed necessary to support the high metabolic rate of these large fish.<br/>
🎧 A couple of years later, in 2007,<br/>
🎧 a researcher called Lisa Balance, who was working in California,<br/>
🎧 also started looking for ocean hotspots, but not for fish -<br/>
🎧 what she was interested in was marine mammals, things like seals.<br/>
🎧 And she found three places in the oceans which were hotspots,<br/>
🎧 and what these had in common was that these hotspots were all located at boundaries between ocean currents,<br/>
🎧 and this seems to be the sort of place that has lots of the plankton that some of these species feed on.<br/>
🎧 So now people who want to protect the species that are endangered need to get as much information as possible.<br/>
🎧 For example, there's an international project called the Census of Marine Life.<br/>
🎧 They've been surveying oceans all over the world, including the Arctic.<br/>
🎧 One thing they found there which stunned other researchers<br/>
🎧 was that there were large numbers of species which live below the ice -<br/>
🎧 sometimes under a layer up to 20 metres thick.<br/>
🎧 Some of these species had never been seen before.<br/>
🎧 They've even found species of octopus living in these conditions.<br/>
🎧 And other scientists working on the same project,<br/>
🎧 but researching very different habitats on the ocean floor,<br/>
🎧 have found large numbers of species congregating around volcanoes,<br/>
🎧 attracted to them by the warmth and nutrients there.<br/>
🎧 However, biologists still don't know how serious the threat to their survival is for each individual species.<br/>
🎧 So a body called the Global Marine Species Assessment is now creating a list of endangered species on land,<br/>
🎧 so they consider things like the size of the population -<br/>
🎧 how many members of one species there are in a particular place -<br/>
🎧 and then they look at their distribution in geographical terms,<br/>
🎧 although this is quite difficult when you're looking at fish, because they're so mobile,<br/>
🎧 and then thirdly they calculate the rate at which the decline of the species is happening.<br/>
🎧 So far only 1,500 species have been assessed,<br/>
🎧 but they want to increase this figure to 20,000.<br/>
🎧 For each one they assess,<br/>
🎧 they use the data they collect on that species to produce a map showing its distribution.<br/>
🎧 Ultimately they will be able to use these to figure out not only where most species are located<br/>
🎧 but also where they are most threatened.<br/>
🎧 So finally, what can be done to retain the diversity of species in the world's oceans?<br/>
🎧 Firstly, we need to set up more reserves in our oceans,<br/>
🎧 places where marine species are protected.<br/>
🎧 We have some, but not enough.<br/>
🎧 In addition, to preserve species such as leatherback turtles,<br/>
🎧 which live out in the high seas but have their nesting sites on the American coast,<br/>
🎧 we need to create corridors for migration,<br/>
🎧 so they can get from one area to another safely.<br/>
🎧 As well as this, action needs to be taken to lower the levels of fishing quotas<br/>
🎧 to prevent overfishing of endangered species.<br/>
🎧 And finally, there's the problem of 'by-catch'.<br/>
🎧 This refers to the catching of unwanted fish by fishing boats -<br/>
🎧 they're returned to the sea, but they're often dead or dying.<br/>
🎧 If these commercial fishing boats used equipment which was more selective,<br/>
🎧 so that only the fish wanted for consumption were caught,<br/>
🎧 this problem could be overcome.<br/>
🎧 OK. So does anyone have any…<br/>
<br/><br/>
