🎧 Hello?<br/>
🎧 Oh, hello.<br/>
🎧 I wanted to <span>enquire</span> about <span>hiring</span> a room in the <span>Village</span> <span>Hall</span>,<br/>
🎧 for the <span>evening</span> of <span>September</span> the first.<br/>
🎧 Let me just <span>see…<br/></span>
🎧 Yes, we have both <span>rooms</span> <span>available</span> that <span>evening</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's our <span>Main</span> <span>Hall</span> <span>-</span> that's got <span>seating</span> for <span>200</span> people.<br/>
🎧 Or there's the <span>Charlton</span> <span>Room…<br/></span>
🎧 Sorry?<br/>
🎧 The <span>Charlton</span> Room <span>-</span> <span>C-H-A-R-L-T-O-N</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's got <span>seating</span> for up to one <span>hundred</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, we're <span>organising</span> a dinner to <span>raise</span> money for a <span>charity</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we're <span>hoping</span> for at <span>least</span> <span>150</span> people,<br/>
🎧 so I think we'll go for the <span>Main</span> <span>Hall</span>.<br/>
🎧 How much would that <span>cost</span>?<br/>
🎧 Let's see.<br/>
🎧 You wanted it for the <span>evening</span> of <span>September</span> the <span>1st</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's a <span>Saturday</span>.<br/>
🎧 So from six pm to <span>midnight<br/></span>
🎧 that'd be <span>£115</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's the weekend <span>price</span>, it's <span>£75</span> on <span>weekdays</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's all right.<br/>
🎧 And I have to tell you there's also a <span>deposit</span> of <span>£250</span>,<br/>
🎧 which is <span>returnable</span> of course as long as there's no <span>damage</span>.<br/>
🎧 But we do <span>insist</span> that this is <span>paid</span> in <span>cash</span>,<br/>
🎧 we don't take <span>cards</span> for that.<br/>
🎧 You can pay the <span>actual</span> <span>rent</span> of the room <span>however</span> you like though <span>-</span> <span>cash</span>, <span>credit</span> <span>card</span>, <span>cheque…<br/></span>
🎧 Oh, well I <span>suppose</span> that's OK.<br/>
🎧 So does the <span>charge</span> <span>include</span> use of <span>tables</span> and <span>chairs</span> and so on?<br/>
🎧 Oh, yes.<br/>
🎧 And what about <span>parking</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, that's all <span>included</span>.<br/>
🎧 The only thing that isn't <span>included</span> <span>is…<br/></span>
🎧 you said you were <span>organising</span> a dinner?<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 Well, you'll have to pay <span>extra</span> for the <span>kitchen</span> if you want to use that.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>£25</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's got very good <span>facilities</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 good <span>quality</span> <span>cookers</span> and <span>fridges</span> and so on.<br/>
🎧 OK, well I <span>suppose</span> that's all right.<br/>
🎧 We can <span>cover</span> the <span>cost</span> in our <span>entry</span> <span>charges</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So I'll make a <span>note</span> of that.<br/>
🎧 Now there are just one or two things you need to think about before the <span>event</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, you'll have to see about getting a <span>licence</span> if you're planning to have any music during the <span>meal</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, really?<br/>
🎧 It's quite <span>straightforward</span>, I'll give you the <span>details</span> later on.<br/>
🎧 And about a week or ten <span>days</span> before your <span>event</span> you'll need to <span>contact</span> the <span>caretaker</span>, that's Mr <span>Evans</span>,<br/>
🎧 to make the <span>arrangements</span> for <span>entry</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 he'll <span>sort</span> that out with you.<br/>
🎧 And do I give him the <span>payment</span> as well?<br/>
🎧 No, you do that <span>directly</span> with me.<br/>
🎧 Right. Now is there anything I need to know about what <span>happens</span> during the <span>event</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, as you'll be <span>aware</span>, of course the <span>building</span> is no <span>smoking</span> <span>throughout</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 Now, are you having a <span>band</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Well, they'll have a lot of <span>equipment</span>,<br/>
🎧 so rather than <span>using</span> the <span>front</span> <span>door</span> they should <span>park</span> their <span>van</span> <span>round</span> the <span>back<br/></span>
🎧 and use the <span>stage</span> <span>door</span> there.<br/>
🎧 You can open that from inside but don't <span>forget</span> to <span>lock</span> it at the end.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 And talking of <span>bands</span>, I'm sure I don't need to tell you this,<br/>
🎧 but you must make sure that no one <span>fiddles</span> about with the <span>black</span> box by the <span>fire</span> <span>door</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 that's a <span>system</span> that <span>cuts</span> in when the <span>volume</span> <span>reaches</span> a <span>certain</span> <span>level</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>legal</span> <span>requirement</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, we want people to be able to talk to one <span>another<br/></span>
🎧 so we don't want anything too <span>loud</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that <span>reminds</span> me, we'll be having <span>speeches</span>.<br/>
🎧 Are there any <span>microphones</span> <span>available</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah. Just let the <span>caretaker</span> know, he'll get those for you.<br/>
🎧 Right, now when the <span>event</span> is over we do ask that the <span>premises</span> are <span>left</span> in good <span>condition</span>.<br/>
🎧 So there's a <span>locked</span> <span>cupboard<br/></span>
🎧 and you'll be <span>informed</span> of the <span>code</span> you need to open that.<br/>
🎧 It's got all the <span>cleaning</span> <span>equipment</span>, <span>brushes</span> and <span>detergent</span> and so on.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So what do we need to do after <span>everyone's</span> <span>gone</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Sweep</span> the <span>floors</span> I <span>suppose</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, actually they have to be <span>washed</span>, not just <span>swept</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then you'll be <span>provided</span> with <span>black</span> <span>plastic</span> <span>bags</span>,<br/>
🎧 so all the <span>rubbish</span> must be <span>collected</span> up and <span>left</span> outside the <span>door</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 We'll make sure <span>everything's</span> <span>left</span> <span>tidy</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and I <span>forgot</span> to ask,<br/>
🎧 I <span>presume</span> we can have <span>decorations</span> in the room?<br/>
🎧 Yes, but you must take them down <span>afterwards</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 And the <span>chairs</span> and <span>tables</span> should be <span>stacked</span> up <span>neatly</span> at the back of the room.<br/>
🎧 I'll make sure I've got a few people to help me.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 <span>Welcome</span> to the <span>Fiddy</span> Working <span>Heritage</span> <span>Farm</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>open-air</span> <span>museum</span> <span>gives</span> you the <span>experience</span> of <span>agriculture</span> and <span>rural</span> life in the English <span>countryside</span> at the end of the <span>19th</span> <span>century</span>.<br/>
🎧 So you'll see a <span>typical</span> <span>farm</span> of that <span>period</span>,<br/>
🎧 and like me, all the <span>staff</span> are <span>dressed</span> in <span>clothes</span> of that time.<br/>
🎧 I must give you some advice and <span>safety</span> <span>tips</span> before we go any <span>further</span>.<br/>
🎧 As it's a working <span>farm</span>, please don't <span>frighten</span> or <span>injure</span> the <span>animals</span>.<br/>
🎧 We have a lot here, and many of them are <span>breeds</span> that are now quite <span>rare</span>.<br/>
🎧 And do <span>stay</span> at a <span>safe</span> <span>distance</span> from the <span>tools:<br/></span>
🎧 some of them have <span>sharp</span> <span>points</span> which can be <span>pretty</span> <span>dangerous</span>,<br/>
🎧 so please don't touch them.<br/>
🎧 We don't want any <span>accidents</span>, do we?<br/>
🎧 The <span>ground</span> is very <span>uneven</span>,<br/>
🎧 and you might <span>slip</span> if you're <span>wearing</span> <span>sandals<br/></span>
🎧 so I'm glad to see you're all <span>wearing</span> <span>shoes</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 we always <span>advise</span> people to do that.<br/>
🎧 Now, children of all <span>ages</span> are very <span>welcome</span> here,<br/>
🎧 and usually even very young children love the <span>ducks</span> and <span>lambs</span>,<br/>
🎧 so do <span>bring</span> them along next time you come.<br/>
🎧 I don't think any of you have <span>brought</span> <span>dogs</span> with you,<br/>
🎧 but in case you have, I'm <span>afraid</span> they'll have to <span>stay</span> in the car <span>park</span> <span>unless</span> they're <span>guide</span> <span>dogs</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you'll <span>understand</span> that they could <span>cause</span> a lot of <span>problems</span> on a <span>farm</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now let me give you some idea of the <span>layout</span> of the <span>farm</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>building</span> where you <span>bought</span> your <span>tickets</span> is the New <span>Barn</span>, <span>immediately</span> to your right,<br/>
🎧 and we're now at the <span>beginning</span> of the <span>main</span> <span>path</span> to the <span>farmland</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and of course the car <span>park</span> is on your <span>left</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>scarecrow</span> you can see in the car <span>park</span> in the <span>corner</span>, <span>beside</span> the <span>main</span> <span>path</span>,<br/>
🎧 is a <span>traditional</span> <span>figure</span> for <span>keeping</span> the <span>birds</span> away from <span>crops</span>,<br/>
🎧 but our <span>scarecrow</span> is a <span>permanent</span> <span>sculpture</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>taller</span> than a <span>human</span> being, so you can see it from quite a <span>distance</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you look <span>ahead</span> of you, you'll see a <span>maze</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>opposite</span> the New <span>Barn</span>, <span>beside</span> the side <span>path</span> that <span>branches</span> off to the right just over there.<br/>
🎧 The <span>maze</span> is made out of <span>hedges</span> which are too <span>tall</span> for young children to see over them,<br/>
🎧 but it's quite small, so you can't get <span>lost</span> in it!<br/>
🎧 Now, can you see the <span>bridge</span> <span>crossing</span> the <span>fish</span> <span>pool</span> <span>further</span> up the <span>main</span> <span>path</span>?<br/>
🎧 If you want to go to the <span>café</span>, go <span>towards</span> the <span>bridge</span> and <span>turn</span> right just before it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Walk</span> along the side <span>path</span> and the <span>café's</span> on the first <span>bend</span> you come to.<br/>
🎧 The <span>building</span> was <span>originally</span> the <span>schoolhouse</span>, and it's well over a <span>hundred</span> years old.<br/>
🎧 As you may know, we run <span>skills</span> <span>workshops</span> here,<br/>
🎧 where you can learn <span>traditional</span> <span>crafts</span> like <span>woodwork</span> and <span>basket-making</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can see <span>examples</span> of the work, and talk to <span>someone</span> about the <span>courses</span>, in the <span>Black</span> <span>Barn</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you take the side <span>path</span> to the right, here, just by the New <span>Barn</span>,<br/>
🎧 you'll come to the <span>Black</span> <span>Barn</span> just where the <span>path</span> first <span>bends</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now I mustn't <span>forget</span> to tell you about <span>picnicking</span>,<br/>
🎧 as I can see some of you have <span>brought</span> your lunch with you.<br/>
🎧 You can <span>picnic</span> in the <span>field</span>, though do <span>clear</span> up behind you, of course.<br/>
🎧 Or if you'd <span>prefer</span> a <span>covered</span> <span>picnic</span> <span>area</span>, there's one near the <span>farmyard:<br/></span>
🎧 just after you <span>cross</span> the <span>bridge</span>,<br/>
🎧 there's a <span>covered</span> <span>picnic</span> <span>spot</span> on the right.<br/>
🎧 And the last thing to <span>mention</span> is <span>Fiddy</span> House <span>itself</span>.<br/>
🎧 From here you can <span>cross</span> the <span>bridge<br/></span>
🎧 then <span>walk</span> along the <span>footpath</span> through the <span>field</span> to the <span>left</span> of the <span>farmyard</span>.<br/>
🎧 That <span>goes</span> to the house, and it'll give you a <span>lovely</span> <span>view</span> of it.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>certainly</span> <span>worth</span> a few <span>photographs</span>,<br/>
🎧 but as it's a <span>private</span> home, I'm <span>afraid</span> you can't go inside.<br/>
🎧 Right. Well, if you're all ready, we'll set off on our <span>tour</span> of the <span>farm</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>
</span>

🎧 OK, <span>Greg</span>, so I finally <span>managed</span> to read the <span>article</span> you <span>mentioned</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 the one about the <span>study</span> on <span>gender</span> in <span>physics</span>.<br/>
🎧 About the <span>study</span> of <span>college</span> students done by <span>Akira</span> <span>Miyake</span> and his <span>team</span>?<br/>
🎧 I was interested that the <span>researchers</span> were actually a mix of <span>psychologists</span> and <span>physicists</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's an <span>unusual</span> <span>combination</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 I got a little <span>confused</span> at first about which students the <span>study</span> was <span>based</span> on.<br/>
🎧 They weren't actually <span>majoring</span> in <span>physics</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 they were <span>majoring</span> in what's <span>known</span> as the <span>STEM</span> <span>disciplines</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>science</span>, <span>technology</span>, <span>engineering</span> <span>and…</span> and <span>math</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but they were all doing <span>physics</span> <span>courses</span> as <span>part</span> of their <span>studies</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>correct</span>.<br/>
🎧 So as I <span>understood</span> it,<br/>
🎧 <span>Miyake</span> and <span>co</span> <span>started</span> from the <span>fact</span> that <span>women</span> are <span>underrepresented<br/></span>
🎧 in <span>introductory</span> <span>physics</span> <span>courses</span> at <span>college</span>,<br/>
🎧 and also that on <span>average</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>women</span> who do <span>enrol</span> on these <span>courses</span> <span>perform</span> more <span>poorly</span> than the men.<br/>
🎧 No one really <span>knows</span> why this is the case.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. But what the <span>researchers</span> wanted to find <span>out<br/></span>
🎧 was <span>basically</span> what they could do about the <span>relatively</span> low <span>level</span> of the <span>women's</span> <span>results</span>.<br/>
🎧 But in order to find a <span>solution<br/></span>
🎧 they <span>needed</span> to find out more about the <span>nature</span> of the <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right <span>-</span> now let's see if I can <span>remember…<br/></span>
🎧 it was that in the <span>physics</span> class,<br/>
🎧 the <span>female</span> students thought the <span>male</span> students all <span>assumed</span> that <span>women</span> weren't any good at <span>physics…<br/></span>
🎧 was that it?<br/>
🎧 And they thought that the men <span>expected</span> them to get <span>poor</span> <span>results</span> in their <span>tests</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's what the <span>women</span> thought, and that made them <span>nervous</span>, so they did get <span>poor</span> <span>results</span>.<br/>
🎧 But actually they were <span>wrong…<br/></span>
🎧 No one was <span>making</span> any <span>assumptions</span> about the <span>female</span> students at all.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, what <span>Miyake's</span> <span>team</span> did was quite simple <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 getting the students to do some <span>writing</span> before they went into the <span>physics</span> class.<br/>
🎧 What did they call it?<br/>
🎧 <span>Values-affirmation</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 they had to <span>write</span> an <span>essay</span> <span>focusing</span> on things that were <span>significant</span> to them,<br/>
🎧 not <span>particularly</span> to do with the <span>subject</span> they were <span>studying</span>,<br/>
🎧 but more <span>general</span> things like music or people who <span>mattered</span> to them.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 So the idea of doing the <span>writing</span> is that this <span>gets</span> the students thinking in a <span>positive</span> way.<br/>
🎧 And <span>putting</span> these <span>thoughts</span> into <span>words</span> can <span>relax</span> them and help them <span>overcome</span> the <span>psychological</span> <span>factors<br/></span>
🎧 that <span>lead</span> to <span>poor</span> <span>performance</span>. Yeah.<br/>
🎧 But what the <span>researchers</span> in the <span>study</span> hadn't <span>expected<br/></span>
🎧 was that this one <span>activity</span> <span>raised</span> the <span>women's</span> <span>physics</span> <span>grades</span> from the <span>C</span> to the <span>B</span> <span>range</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>huge</span> change.<br/>
🎧 <span>Pity</span> it wasn't to an A, but still!<br/>
🎧 No, but it does <span>suggest</span> that the <span>women</span> were <span>seriously</span> <span>underperforming</span> <span>beforehand</span>, in <span>comparison</span> with the men.<br/>
🎧 Yes. <span>Mind</span> you, <span>Miyake's</span> <span>article</span> <span>left</span> out a lot of <span>details</span>.<br/>
🎧 Like, did the students do the <span>writing</span> just once, or <span>several</span> <span>times</span>?<br/>
🎧 And had they been told why they were doing the <span>writing</span>?<br/>
🎧 That might have <span>affected</span> the <span>results</span>.<br/>
🎧 You mean, if they know the <span>researchers</span> thought it might help them to <span>improve</span>,<br/>
🎧 then they'd just try to <span>fulfill</span> that <span>expectation</span>?<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 So <span>anyway</span>, I thought for our <span>project</span> we could do a <span>similar</span> <span>study</span>,<br/>
🎧 but <span>investigate</span> <span>whether</span> it really was the <span>writing</span> <span>activity</span> that had that <span>result</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 So we could ask them to do a <span>writing</span> <span>task</span> about something <span>completely</span> <span>different…<br/></span>
🎧 something more <span>factual</span>?<br/>
🎧 Like a <span>general</span> <span>knowledge</span> <span>topic</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Maybe…<br/></span>
🎧 or we could have <span>half</span> the students doing a <span>writing</span> <span>task<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>half</span> doing something else, like an <span>oral</span> <span>task</span>.<br/>
🎧 Or even, <span>half</span> do the same <span>writing</span> <span>task</span> as in the <span>original</span> <span>research<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>half</span> do a <span>factual</span> <span>writing</span> <span>task</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then we'd see if it really is the <span>topic</span> that made the <span>difference</span>, or something else.<br/>
🎧 That's it. Good.<br/>
🎧 So at our <span>meeting</span> with the <span>supervisor</span> on <span>Monday<br/></span>
🎧 we can tell him we've <span>decided</span> on our <span>project</span>.<br/>
🎧 We should have our <span>aims</span> ready by then.<br/>
🎧 I <span>suppose</span> we need to read the <span>original</span> <span>study</span> <span>-</span> the <span>article's</span> just a <span>summary</span>.<br/>
🎧 And there was another <span>article</span> I read, by <span>Smolinsky</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was about her <span>research</span> on how <span>women</span> and men <span>perform</span> in <span>mixed</span> <span>teams</span> in class,<br/>
🎧 <span>compared</span> with <span>single-sex</span> <span>teams</span> and on their own.<br/>
🎧 Let me <span>guess…</span> the <span>women</span> were better at <span>teamwork</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's what I <span>expected</span>,<br/>
🎧 but actually the men and the <span>women</span> got the same <span>results<br/></span>
🎧 <span>whether</span> they were working in <span>teams</span> or on their own.<br/>
🎧 But I <span>guess</span> it's not that <span>relevant</span> to us.<br/>
🎧 What <span>worries</span> me <span>anyway</span> is how we're going to get everything done in the time.<br/>
🎧 We'll be OK now we know what we're doing.<br/>
🎧 Though I'm not <span>clear</span> how we <span>assess</span> <span>whether</span> the students in our <span>experiment</span> actually make any <span>progress</span> or <span>not…<br/></span>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 We may need some advice on that.<br/>
🎧 The <span>main</span> <span>thing's</span> to make sure we have the right size <span>sample</span>,<br/>
🎧 not too big or too small.<br/>
🎧 That shouldn't be <span>difficult</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right, what do we need to do next?<br/>
🎧 We could have a look at the <span>timetable</span> for the <span>science</span> <span>classes…<br/></span>
🎧 or <span>perhaps</span> we should just make an <span>appointment</span> to see one of the <span>science</span> <span>professors</span>.<br/>
🎧 That'd be better.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 And we could even get to <span>observe</span> one of the <span>classes</span>.<br/>
🎧 What for?<br/>
🎧 <span>Well…</span> OK maybe let's just go with your idea.<br/>
🎧 Right, <span>well…<br/>

🎧 I've been looking at <span>ocean</span> <span>biodiversity</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's the <span>diversity</span> of <span>species</span> that live in the <span>world's</span> <span>oceans</span>.<br/>
🎧 About <span>20</span> years ago,<br/>
🎧 <span>biologists</span> <span>developed</span> the idea of what they called <span>'biodiversity</span> <span>hotspots'</span>.<br/>
🎧 These are the <span>areas</span> which have the <span>greatest</span> <span>mixture</span> of <span>species</span>,<br/>
🎧 so one example is <span>Madagascar</span>.<br/>
🎧 These <span>hotspots</span> are <span>significant<br/></span>
🎧 because they <span>allow</span> us to <span>locate</span> key <span>areas</span> for <span>focusing</span> <span>efforts</span> at <span>conservation</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Biologists</span> can <span>identify</span> <span>hotspots</span> on <span>land</span>, <span>fairly</span> <span>easily</span>,<br/>
🎧 but until <span>recently</span>, very little was <span>known</span> about <span>species</span> <span>distribution</span> and <span>diversity</span> in the <span>oceans</span>,<br/>
🎧 and no one even <span>knew</span> if <span>hotspots</span> <span>existed</span> there.<br/>
🎧 Then a <span>Canadian</span> <span>biologist</span> called <span>Boris</span> <span>Worm<br/></span>
🎧 did some <span>research</span> in <span>2005</span> on <span>data</span> on <span>ocean</span> <span>species</span> that he got from the <span>fishing</span> <span>industry</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Worm</span> <span>located</span> <span>five</span> <span>hotspots</span> for large <span>ocean</span> <span>predators</span> like <span>sharks</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>looked</span> at what they had in <span>common</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>main</span> thing he'd <span>expected</span> to find was that they had very high <span>concentrations</span> of food,<br/>
🎧 but to his <span>surprise</span> that was only <span>true</span> for <span>four</span> of the <span>hotspots</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>remaining</span> <span>hotspot</span> was quite <span>badly</span> off in that <span>regard</span>.<br/>
🎧 But what he did find was that in all <span>cases</span>,<br/>
🎧 the water at the <span>surface</span> of the <span>ocean</span> had <span>relatively</span> high <span>temperatures</span>,<br/>
🎧 even when it was <span>cool</span> at <span>greater</span> <span>depths</span>,<br/>
🎧 so this <span>seemed</span> to be a <span>factor</span> in <span>supporting</span> a <span>diverse</span> <span>range</span> of these large <span>predators</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, this wasn't enough on its own,<br/>
🎧 because he also <span>found</span> that the water <span>needed</span> to have enough <span>oxygen</span> in it <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 so these two <span>factors</span> <span>seemed</span> <span>necessary</span> to <span>support</span> the high <span>metabolic</span> <span>rate</span> of these large <span>fish</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>couple</span> of years later, in <span>2007</span>,<br/>
🎧 a <span>researcher</span> called <span>Lisa</span> <span>Balance</span>, who was working in <span>California</span>,<br/>
🎧 also <span>started</span> looking for <span>ocean</span> <span>hotspots</span>, but not for <span>fish</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 what she was interested in was <span>marine</span> <span>mammals</span>, things like <span>seals</span>.<br/>
🎧 And she <span>found</span> <span>three</span> <span>places</span> in the <span>oceans</span> which were <span>hotspots</span>,<br/>
🎧 and what these had in <span>common</span> was that these <span>hotspots</span> were all <span>located</span> at <span>boundaries</span> between <span>ocean</span> <span>currents</span>,<br/>
🎧 and this <span>seems</span> to be the <span>sort</span> of place that has lots of the <span>plankton</span> that some of these <span>species</span> <span>feed</span> on.<br/>
🎧 So now people who want to <span>protect</span> the <span>species</span> that are <span>endangered</span> need to get as much <span>information</span> as <span>possible</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, there's an <span>international</span> <span>project</span> called the <span>Census</span> of <span>Marine</span> Life.<br/>
🎧 <span>They've</span> been <span>surveying</span> <span>oceans</span> all over the <span>world</span>, <span>including</span> the <span>Arctic</span>.<br/>
🎧 One thing they <span>found</span> there which <span>stunned</span> other <span>researchers<br/></span>
🎧 was that there were large <span>numbers</span> of <span>species</span> which live <span>below</span> the ice <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 sometimes under a <span>layer</span> up to <span>20</span> <span>metres</span> <span>thick</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some of these <span>species</span> had never been <span>seen</span> before.<br/>
🎧 <span>They've</span> even <span>found</span> <span>species</span> of <span>octopus</span> living in these <span>conditions</span>.<br/>
🎧 And other <span>scientists</span> working on the same <span>project</span>,<br/>
🎧 but <span>researching</span> very different <span>habitats</span> on the <span>ocean</span> <span>floor</span>,<br/>
🎧 have <span>found</span> large <span>numbers</span> of <span>species</span> <span>congregating</span> around <span>volcanoes</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>attracted</span> to them by the <span>warmth</span> and <span>nutrients</span> there.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, <span>biologists</span> still don't know how serious the <span>threat</span> to their <span>survival</span> is for each <span>individual</span> <span>species</span>.<br/>
🎧 So a <span>body</span> called the <span>Global</span> <span>Marine</span> <span>Species</span> <span>Assessment</span> is now <span>creating</span> a <span>list</span> of <span>endangered</span> <span>species</span> on <span>land</span>,<br/>
🎧 so they <span>consider</span> things like the size of the <span>population</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 how many <span>members</span> of one <span>species</span> there are in a <span>particular</span> place <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and then they look at their <span>distribution</span> in <span>geographical</span> <span>terms</span>,<br/>
🎧 although this is quite <span>difficult</span> when you're looking at <span>fish</span>, because they're so <span>mobile</span>,<br/>
🎧 and then <span>thirdly</span> they <span>calculate</span> the <span>rate</span> at which the <span>decline</span> of the <span>species</span> is <span>happening</span>.<br/>
🎧 So <span>far</span> only <span>1,500</span> <span>species</span> have been <span>assessed</span>,<br/>
🎧 but they want to <span>increase</span> this <span>figure</span> to <span>20,000</span>.<br/>
🎧 For each one they <span>assess</span>,<br/>
🎧 they use the <span>data</span> they <span>collect</span> on that <span>species</span> to <span>produce</span> a map <span>showing</span> its <span>distribution</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ultimately</span> they will be able to use these to <span>figure</span> out not only where most <span>species</span> are <span>located<br/></span>
🎧 but also where they are most <span>threatened</span>.<br/>
🎧 So finally, what can be done to <span>retain</span> the <span>diversity</span> of <span>species</span> in the <span>world's</span> <span>oceans</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Firstly</span>, we need to set up more <span>reserves</span> in our <span>oceans</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>places</span> where <span>marine</span> <span>species</span> are <span>protected</span>.<br/>
🎧 We have some, but not enough.<br/>
🎧 In <span>addition</span>, to <span>preserve</span> <span>species</span> such as <span>leatherback</span> <span>turtles</span>,<br/>
🎧 which live out in the high <span>seas</span> but have their <span>nesting</span> <span>sites</span> on the <span>American</span> <span>coast</span>,<br/>
🎧 we need to <span>create</span> <span>corridors</span> for <span>migration</span>,<br/>
🎧 so they can get from one <span>area</span> to another <span>safely</span>.<br/>
🎧 As well as this, <span>action</span> needs to be taken to <span>lower</span> the <span>levels</span> of <span>fishing</span> <span>quotas<br/></span>
🎧 to <span>prevent</span> <span>overfishing</span> of <span>endangered</span> <span>species</span>.<br/>
🎧 And finally, there's the <span>problem</span> of <span>'by-catch'</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>refers</span> to the <span>catching</span> of <span>unwanted</span> <span>fish</span> by <span>fishing</span> <span>boats</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 they're <span>returned</span> to the sea, but they're often <span>dead</span> or <span>dying</span>.<br/>
🎧 If these <span>commercial</span> <span>fishing</span> <span>boats</span> used <span>equipment</span> which was more <span>selective</span>,<br/>
🎧 so that only the <span>fish</span> wanted for <span>consumption</span> were <span>caught</span>,<br/>
🎧 this <span>problem</span> could be <span>overcome</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK. So does <span>anyone</span> have <span>any…<br/>
</span><br/><br/>
