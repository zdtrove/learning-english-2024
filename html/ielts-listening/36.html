🎧 Good morning. <span>Stretton <span>Festival box <span>office. How can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Oh, hello.<br/>
🎧 My <span>family and I are on <span>holiday in the <span>area,<br/>
🎧 and we've <span>seen some <span>posters about the <span>festival this week.<br/>
🎧 Could you tell me about some of the <span>events, please?<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 First of all, are there still <span>tickets <span>available for the <span>jazz <span>band on <span>Saturday?<br/>
🎧 There are, but only <span>£15.<br/>
🎧 The <span>£12 <span>seats have all been <span>sold.<br/>
🎧 OK. And the <span>venue is the school, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's right, the <span>secondary school.<br/>
🎧 Make sure you don't go to the <span>primary school by <span>mistake!<br/>
🎧 And there's an <span>additional <span>performer who isn't <span>mentioned on the <span>posters <span>-<br/>
🎧 <span>Carolyn <span>Hart is going to play with the <span>band.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I think I've heard her on the <span>radio.<br/>
🎧 Doesn't she play the <span>oboe, or <span>flute or something?<br/>
🎧 Yes the <span>flute.<br/>
🎧 She usually <span>plays with <span>symphony <span>orchestras,<br/>
🎧 and <span>apparently this is her first time with a <span>jazz <span>band.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'd <span>certainly like to hear her.<br/>
🎧 Then the next thing I want to ask about is the <span>duck <span>races <span>-<br/>
🎧 I saw a <span>poster <span>beside a <span>river. What are they, exactly?<br/>
🎧 Well, you buy a <span>yellow <span>plastic <span>duck <span>- or as many as you like <span>- they're a <span>pound each.<br/>
🎧 And you <span>write your name on each one.<br/>
🎧 <span>There'll be <span>several <span>races, <span>depending on the number of <span>ducks taking <span>part.<br/>
🎧 And <span>John <span>Stevens, a <span>champion <span>swimmer who lives <span>locally, is going to start the <span>races.<br/>
🎧 All the <span>ducks will be <span>launched into the <span>river at the back of the <span>cinema,<br/>
🎧 then they'll <span>float along the <span>river for <span>500 <span>metres, as <span>far as the <span>railway <span>bridge.<br/>
🎧 And are there any <span>prizes?<br/>
🎧 Yes, the first <span>duck in each <span>race to <span>arrive at the <span>finishing <span>line <span>wins its <span>owner free <span>tickets for the <span>concert on the last <span>night of the <span>festival.<br/>
🎧 You said you can buy a <span>duck?<br/>
🎧 I'm sure my children will both want one.<br/>
🎧 They're on <span>sale at a <span>stall in the <span>market.<br/>
🎧 You can't <span>miss it <span>-<br/>
🎧 it's got an <span>enormous <span>sign <span>showing a <span>couple of <span>ducks.<br/>
🎧 OK. I'll go there this <span>afternoon.<br/>
🎧 I remember <span>walking <span>past there <span>yesterday.<br/>
🎧 Now could you tell me something about the <span>flower show, please?<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>admission is free,<br/>
🎧 and the show is being <span>held in <span>Bythwaite <span>Hall.<br/>
🎧 Sorry, how do you <span>spell that?<br/>
🎧 <span>B-Y-T-H-W-A-I-T-E.<br/>
🎧 <span>Bythwaite.<br/>
🎧 Is it easy to find?<br/>
🎧 I'm not very <span>familiar with the <span>town yet.<br/>
🎧 Oh, you won't have any <span>problem.<br/>
🎧 It's right in the <span>centre of <span>Stretton.<br/>
🎧 It's the only old <span>building in the <span>town, so it's easy to <span>recognise.<br/>
🎧 I know it.<br/>
🎧 I <span>presume it's open all day.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but if you'd like to see the <span>prizes being <span>awarded for the best <span>flowers,<br/>
🎧 you'll need to be there at <span>5 <span>o'clock.<br/>
🎧 The <span>prizes are being <span>given by a famous <span>actor, <span>Kevin <span>Shapless.<br/>
🎧 He lives <span>nearby and <span>gets <span>involved in a lot of <span>community <span>events.<br/>
🎧 <span>Gosh, I've <span>seen him on <span>TV.<br/>
🎧 I'll definitely go to the <span>prize-giving.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I've <span>seen a <span>list of <span>plays that are being <span>performed this week,<br/>
🎧 and I'd like to know which are <span>suitable for my children,<br/>
🎧 and which <span>ones my <span>husband and I might go to.<br/>
🎧 How old are your children?<br/>
🎧 <span>Five and <span>seven.<br/>
🎧 What about <span>'The <span>Mystery of <span>Muldoon'?<br/>
🎧 That's <span>aimed at <span>five to <span>ten-year-olds.<br/>
🎧 So if I take my children, I can <span>expect them to enjoy it more than I do?<br/>
🎧 I think so.<br/>
🎧 If you'd like something for yourself and your <span>husband and leave your children with a <span>babysitter,<br/>
🎧 you might like to see <span>'Fire and <span>Flood' <span>-<br/>
🎧 it's about <span>events that really <span>happened in <span>Stretton <span>200 years ago,<br/>
🎧 and children might find it rather <span>frightening.<br/>
🎧 Oh, thanks for the <span>warning.<br/>
🎧 And finally, what about <span>'Silly <span>Sailor'?<br/>
🎧 That's a <span>comedy, and it's for young and old.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact, it <span>won an <span>award in the <span>Stretton <span>Drama <span>Festival a <span>couple of <span>months ago.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>goodbye, and thanks for all the <span>information.<br/>
🎧 I'm looking forward to the <span>festival!<br/>
🎧 <span>Goodbye.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Good morning, and <span>welcome to the <span>museum <span>-<br/>
🎧 one with a <span>remarkable <span>range of <span>exhibits, which I'm sure you'll enjoy.<br/>
🎧 My <span>name's <span>Greg, and I'll tell you about the <span>various <span>collections as we go around.<br/>
🎧 But before we go, let me just give you a <span>taste of what we have here.<br/>
🎧 Well, for one thing, we have a fine <span>collection of <span>twentieth and <span>twenty-first <span>century <span>paintings,<br/>
🎧 many by very <span>well-known <span>artists.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you'll <span>recognise <span>several of the <span>paintings.<br/>
🎧 This is the <span>gallery that <span>attracts the <span>largest number of <span>visitors,<br/>
🎧 so it's best to go in <span>early in the day, before the <span>crowds <span>arrive.<br/>
🎧 Then there are the <span>nineteenth <span>century <span>paintings.<br/>
🎧 The <span>museum was <span>opened in the <span>middle of that <span>century,<br/>
🎧 and <span>several of the <span>artists each <span>donated one work <span>- to get the <span>museum <span>started, as it were.<br/>
🎧 So they're of special <span>interest to us <span>-<br/>
🎧 we feel <span>closer to them than to other <span>works.<br/>
🎧 The <span>sculpture <span>gallery has a number of fine <span>exhibits,<br/>
🎧 but I'm <span>afraid it's <span>currently <span>closed for <span>refurbishment.<br/>
🎧 You'll need to come back next year to see it <span>properly,<br/>
🎧 but a number of the <span>sculptures have been <span>moved to other <span>parts of the <span>museum.<br/>
🎧 <span>'Around the <span>world' is a <span>temporary <span>exhibition <span>-<br/>
🎧 you've probably <span>seen something about it on <span>TV or in the <span>newspapers.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>created a great <span>deal of <span>interest, because it <span>presents <span>objects from every <span>continent and many <span>countries,<br/>
🎧 and <span>provides <span>information about their <span>social <span>context <span>- why they were made, who for, and so on.<br/>
🎧 Then there's the <span>collection of <span>coins.<br/>
🎧 This is what you might call a <span>focused, <span>specialist <span>collection,<br/>
🎧 because all the <span>coins come from this <span>country,<br/>
🎧 and were <span>produced between two <span>thousand and a <span>thousand years ago.<br/>
🎧 And many of them were <span>discovered by <span>ordinary people <span>digging their <span>gardens and <span>donated to the <span>museum!<br/>
🎧 All our <span>porcelain and <span>glass was <span>left to the <span>museum by its <span>founder, when he <span>died in <span>1878.<br/>
🎧 And in the <span>terms of his will, we're not <span>allowed to add anything to that <span>collection:<br/>
🎧 he <span>believed it was perfect in <span>itself, and we don't see any <span>reason to <span>disagree!<br/>
🎧 OK, that was something about the <span>collections,<br/>
🎧 and now here's some more <span>practical <span>information, in case you need it.<br/>
🎧 Most of the <span>museum <span>facilities are <span>downstairs, in the <span>basement,<br/>
🎧 so you go down the <span>stairs here.<br/>
🎧 When you <span>reach the <span>bottom of the <span>stairs, you'll find yourself in a <span>sitting <span>area,<br/>
🎧 with <span>comfortable <span>chairs and <span>sofas<br/>
🎧 where you can have a <span>rest before <span>continuing your <span>exploration of the <span>museum.<br/>
🎧 We have a very good <span>restaurant, which <span>serves <span>excellent food all day, in a <span>relaxing <span>atmosphere.<br/>
🎧 To <span>reach it, when you get to the <span>bottom of the <span>stairs, go <span>straight ahead to the <span>far side of the <span>sitting <span>area,<br/>
🎧 then <span>turn right into the <span>corridor.<br/>
🎧 You'll see the <span>door of the <span>restaurant <span>facing you.<br/>
🎧 If you just want a <span>snack, or if you'd like to eat somewhere with <span>facilities for children,<br/>
🎧 we also have a <span>café.<br/>
🎧 When you <span>reach the <span>bottom of the <span>stairs, you'll need to go <span>straight ahead,<br/>
🎧 <span>turn right into the <span>corridor, and the <span>café is <span>immediately on the right.<br/>
🎧 And talking about children, there are <span>baby-changing <span>facilities <span>downstairs:<br/>
🎧 <span>cross the <span>sitting <span>area, <span>continue <span>straight ahead along the <span>corridor on the <span>left<br/>
🎧 and you and your <span>baby will find the <span>facilities on the <span>left-hand side.<br/>
🎧 The <span>cloakroom where you should leave <span>coats, <span>umbrellas and any large <span>bags,<br/>
🎧 is on the <span>left <span>hand side of the <span>sitting <span>area.<br/>
🎧 It's through the last <span>door before you come to the <span>corridor.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>toilets on every <span>floor,<br/>
🎧 but in the <span>basement they're the first <span>rooms on the <span>left when you get down there.<br/>
🎧 OK, now if you've got anything to leave in the <span>cloakroom,<br/>
🎧 please do that now, and then we'll start our <span>tour.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Hi, <span>Joanna, good to meet you.<br/>
🎧 Now, before we <span>discuss your new <span>research <span>project.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to hear something about the <span>psychology <span>study you did last year for your <span>Master's <span>degree.<br/>
🎧 So how did you choose your <span>subjects for that?<br/>
🎧 Well, I had six <span>subjects, all <span>professional <span>musicians, and all <span>female.<br/>
🎧 <span>Three were <span>violinists<br/>
🎧 and there was also a <span>cello <span>player and a <span>pianist and a <span>flute <span>player.<br/>
🎧 They were all very <span>highly <span>regarded in the music <span>world<br/>
🎧 and they'd done quite <span>extensive <span>tours in different <span>continents,<br/>
🎧 and quite a few had <span>won <span>prizes in <span>competitions as well.<br/>
🎧 And they were quite young, weren't they?<br/>
🎧 Yes, between <span>25 and <span>29 <span>-<br/>
🎧 the mean was <span>27.8.<br/>
🎧 I wasn't <span>specifically looking for <span>artists who'd <span>produced <span>recordings <span>but...<br/>
🎧 this is something that's just taken for <span>granted these <span>days, and they all had.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Now you <span>collected your <span>data through <span>telephone <span>interviews, didn't you?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 I <span>realised if I was going to <span>interview <span>leading <span>musicians, it'd only be <span>possible over the phone because they're so <span>busy.<br/>
🎧 I <span>recorded them <span>using a <span>telephone <span>recording <span>adaptor.<br/>
🎧 I'd been <span>worried about the <span>quality, but it <span>worked out all right.<br/>
🎧 I <span>managed at <span>least a <span>30-minute <span>interview with each <span>subject, sometimes <span>longer.<br/>
🎧 Did doing it on the phone make it more <span>stressful?<br/>
🎧 I'd thought it <span>might…<br/>
🎧 it was all quite <span>informal though and in <span>fact they <span>seemed very <span>keen to talk.<br/>
🎧 And I don't think <span>using the phone <span>meant I got less <span>rich <span>data rather the <span>opposite in <span>fact.<br/>
🎧 <span>Interesting.<br/>
🎧 And you were looking at how <span>performers <span>dress for <span>concert <span>performances?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 My <span>research <span>investigated the way <span>players see their <span>role as a <span>musician<br/>
🎧 and how this is <span>linked to the <span>type of <span>clothing they decide to <span>wear.<br/>
🎧 But that focus didn't <span>emerge <span>immediately.<br/>
🎧 When I <span>started I was more interested in trying to <span>investigate the <span>impact of what was <span>worn on those <span>listening,<br/>
🎧 and also <span>whether <span>someone like a <span>violinist might <span>adopt a different <span>style of <span>clothing from, say, <span>someone playing the <span>flute or the <span>trumpet.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>interesting that the <span>choice of <span>dress is up to the <span>individual, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yes, you'd <span>expect there to be <span>rules about it in <span>orchestras, but that's quite <span>rare.<br/>
🎧 You only had <span>women <span>performers in your <span>study.<br/>
🎧 Was that because <span>male <span>musicians are less <span>worried about <span>fashion?<br/>
🎧 I think a lot of the men are very much <span>influenced by <span>fashion,<br/>
🎧 but in <span>social <span>terms the <span>choices they have are more <span>limited…<br/>
🎧 they'd really <span>upset <span>audiences if they <span>strayed away from quite <span>narrow <span>boundaries.<br/>
🎧 Now, <span>popular music has quite different <span>expectations.<br/>
🎧 Did you read <span>Mike <span>Frost's <span>article about the <span>dress of <span>women <span>performers in <span>popular <span>music...<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 where he <span>points out that a lot of <span>female <span>singers and <span>musicians in <span>popular music <span>tend to <span>dress down in <span>performances,<br/>
🎧 and <span>wear less <span>feminine <span>clothes, <span>erm, like <span>jeans <span>instead of <span>skirts,<br/>
🎧 and he <span>suggests this is because <span>otherwise they'd just be <span>discounted as <span>trivial.<br/>
🎧 But you could <span>argue they're just <span>wearing what's <span>practical…<br/>
🎧 I mean, a <span>pop-music <span>concert is usually a <span>pretty <span>energetic <span>affair.<br/>
🎧 Yes, he doesn't make that <span>point, but I think you're probably right.<br/>
🎧 I was interested by the <span>effect of the <span>audience at a <span>musical <span>performance when it came to the <span>choice of <span>dress.<br/>
🎧 The <span>subjects I <span>interviewed <span>felt this was really important.<br/>
🎧 It's all to do with what we <span>understand by <span>performance as a <span>public <span>event.<br/>
🎧 They <span>believed the <span>audience had <span>certain <span>expectations<br/>
🎧 and it was up to them as <span>performers to <span>fulfill these <span>expectations to show a kind of <span>esteem…<br/>
🎧 they weren't <span>afraid of looking as if they'd made an <span>effort to look good.<br/>
🎧 I think in the <span>past the <span>audience would have had those <span>expectations of one another too,<br/>
🎧 but that's not really the case now, not in the <span>UK <span>anyway.<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 And I also got interested in what <span>sports <span>scientists are doing too, with <span>regard to <span>clothing.<br/>
🎧 <span>Musicians are quite <span>vulnerable <span>physically, aren't they, <span>because...<br/>
🎧 the <span>movements they <span>carry out are very <span>intensive and <span>repetitive, <span>so...<br/>
🎧 I'd <span>imagine some <span>features of <span>sports <span>clothing could <span>safeguard the <span>players from the <span>potentially <span>dangerous <span>effects of this <span>sort of thing.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but <span>musicians don't really <span>consider it.<br/>
🎧 They <span>avoid <span>clothing that <span>obviously <span>restricts their <span>movements, but that's as <span>far as they go.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway, <span>coming back to your own <span>research, do you have any idea where you're going from here?<br/>
🎧 I was thinking of doing a <span>study <span>using an <span>audience...<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 As we saw in the last <span>lecture,<br/>
🎧 a <span>major <span>cause of <span>climate change is the <span>rapid <span>rise in the <span>level of <span>carbon <span>dioxide in the <span>atmosphere over the last <span>century.<br/>
🎧 If we could <span>reduce the amount of <span>CO2,<br/>
🎧 <span>perhaps the <span>rate of <span>climate change could also be <span>slowed down.<br/>
🎧 One <span>potential <span>method <span>involves <span>enhancing the <span>role of the <span>soil that <span>plants <span>grow in,<br/>
🎧 with <span>regard to <span>absorbing <span>CO2.<br/>
🎧 <span>Rattan <span>Lal, a <span>soil <span>scientist from <span>Ohio <span>State University, in the <span>USA,<br/>
🎧 <span>claims that the <span>world's <span>agricultural <span>soils could <span>potentially <span>absorb <span>13% of the <span>carbon <span>dioxide in the <span>atmosphere <span>-<br/>
🎧 the <span>equivalent of the amount <span>released in the last <span>30 years.<br/>
🎧 And <span>research is going on into how this might be <span>achieved.<br/>
🎧 <span>Lal first came to the idea that <span>soil might be <span>valuable in this way not through an <span>interest in <span>climate change,<br/>
🎧 but rather out of <span>concern for the <span>land <span>itself and the people <span>dependent on it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Carbon-rich <span>soil is <span>dark, <span>crumbly and <span>fertile, and <span>retains some water.<br/>
🎧 But <span>erosion can <span>occur if <span>soil is dry,<br/>
🎧 which is a <span>likely <span>effect if it <span>contains <span>inadequate <span>amounts of <span>carbon.<br/>
🎧 <span>Erosion is of course bad for people trying to <span>grow <span>crops or <span>breed <span>animals on that <span>terrain.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>1970s and <span>'80s,<br/>
🎧 <span>Lal was <span>studying <span>soils in <span>Africa so <span>devoid of <span>organic <span>matter<br/>
🎧 that the <span>ground had become <span>extremely <span>hard, like <span>cement.<br/>
🎧 There he <span>met a <span>pioneer in the <span>study of <span>global <span>warming,<br/>
🎧 who <span>suggested that <span>carbon from the <span>soil had <span>moved into the <span>atmosphere.<br/>
🎧 This is now looking <span>increasingly <span>likely.<br/>
🎧 Let me <span>explain.<br/>
🎧 For <span>millions of years, <span>carbon <span>dioxide <span>levels in the <span>atmosphere have been <span>regulated, in <span>part,<br/>
🎧 by a <span>natural <span>partnership between <span>plants and <span>microbes <span>- <span>tiny <span>organisms in the <span>soil.<br/>
🎧 <span>Plants <span>absorb <span>CO2 from the <span>air<br/>
🎧 and <span>transform it into <span>sugars and other <span>carbon-based <span>substances.<br/>
🎧 While a <span>proportion of these <span>carbon <span>products <span>remain in the <span>plant,<br/>
🎧 some <span>transfer from the <span>roots to <span>fungi and <span>soil <span>microbes,<br/>
🎧 which <span>store the <span>carbon in the <span>soil.<br/>
🎧 The <span>invention of <span>agriculture some <span>10,000 years <span>ago<br/>
🎧 <span>disrupted these <span>ancient <span>soil-building <span>processes<br/>
🎧 and <span>led to the <span>loss of <span>carbon from the <span>soil.<br/>
🎧 When <span>humans <span>started <span>draining the <span>natural <span>topsoil, and <span>ploughing it up for <span>planting,<br/>
🎧 they <span>exposed the <span>buried <span>carbon to <span>oxygen.<br/>
🎧 This <span>created <span>carbon <span>dioxide and <span>released it into the air.<br/>
🎧 And in some <span>places,<br/>
🎧 <span>grazing by <span>domesticated <span>animals has <span>removed all <span>vegetation, <span>releasing <span>carbon into the air.<br/>
🎧 <span>Tons of <span>carbon have been <span>stripped from the <span>world's <span>soils <span>- where it's <span>needed <span>-<br/>
🎧 and <span>pumped into the <span>atmosphere.<br/>
🎧 So what can be done?<br/>
🎧 <span>Researchers are now <span>coming up with <span>evidence that even <span>modest changes to <span>farming<br/>
🎧 can <span>significantly help to <span>reduce the amount of <span>carbon in the <span>atmosphere.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>growers have already <span>started <span>using an <span>approach <span>known as <span>regenerative <span>agriculture.<br/>
🎧 This <span>aims to <span>boost the <span>fertility of <span>soil and keep it <span>moist through <span>established <span>practices.<br/>
🎧 These <span>include <span>keeping <span>fields <span>planted all year <span>round,<br/>
🎧 and <span>increasing the <span>variety of <span>plants being <span>grown.<br/>
🎧 <span>Strategies like these can <span>significantly <span>increase the amount of <span>carbon <span>stored in the <span>soil,<br/>
🎧 so <span>agricultural <span>researchers are now <span>building a case for their use in <span>combating <span>climate change.<br/>
🎧 One <span>American <span>investigation into the <span>potential for <span>storing <span>CO2 on <span>agricultural <span>lands is taking place in <span>California.<br/>
🎧 <span>Soil <span>scientist <span>Whendee <span>Silver of the University of <span>California, <span>Berkeley,<br/>
🎧 is <span>conducting a <span>first-of-its-kind <span>study on a large <span>cattle <span>farm in the <span>state.<br/>
🎧 She and her students are <span>testing the <span>effects on <span>carbon <span>storage of the <span>compost that is <span>created from <span>waste <span>-<br/>
🎧 both <span>agricultural, <span>including <span>manure and <span>cornstalks,<br/>
🎧 and <span>waste <span>produced in <span>gardens, such as leaves, <span>branches, and <span>lawn <span>trimmings.<br/>
🎧 In <span>Australia, <span>soil <span>ecologist <span>Christine <span>Jones is <span>testing another <span>promising <span>soil-enrichment <span>strategy.<br/>
🎧 <span>Jones and <span>12 <span>farmers are working to <span>build up <span>soil <span>carbon by <span>cultivating <span>grasses that <span>stay <span>green all year <span>round.<br/>
🎧 Like <span>composting, the <span>approach has already been <span>proved <span>experimentally;<br/>
🎧 <span>Jones now <span>hopes to show that it can be <span>applied on working <span>farms<br/>
🎧 and that the <span>resulting <span>carbon <span>capture can be <span>accurately <span>measured.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>hoped in the future that <span>projects such as <span>these<br/>
🎧 will <span>demonstrate the <span>role that <span>farmers and other <span>land <span>managers can play in <span>reducing the <span>harmful <span>effects of <span>greenhouse <span>gases.<br/>
🎧 For example, in <span>countries like the <span>United <span>States,<br/>
🎧 where most <span>farming <span>operations use large <span>applications of <span>fertiliser,<br/>
🎧 <span>changing such <span>long-standing <span>habits will <span>require a change of <span>system.<br/>
🎧 <span>Rattan <span>Lal <span>argues that <span>farmers should <span>receive <span>payment not just for the <span>corn or <span>beef they <span>produce<br/>
🎧 but also for the <span>carbon they can <span>store in their <span>soil.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>study <span>being..<br/>
