🎧 Good morning. Stretton Festival box office. How can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Oh, hello.<br/>
🎧 My family and I are on holiday in the area,<br/>
🎧 and we've seen some posters about the festival this week.<br/>
🎧 Could you tell me about some of the events, please?<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 First of all, are there still tickets available for the jazz band on Saturday?<br/>
🎧 There are, but only £15.<br/>
🎧 The £12 seats have all been sold.<br/>
🎧 OK. And the venue is the school, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's right, the secondary school.<br/>
🎧 Make sure you don't go to the primary school by mistake!<br/>
🎧 And there's an additional performer who isn't mentioned on the posters -<br/>
🎧 Carolyn Hart is going to play with the band.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I think I've heard her on the radio.<br/>
🎧 Doesn't she play the oboe, or flute or something?<br/>
🎧 Yes the flute.<br/>
🎧 She usually plays with symphony orchestras,<br/>
🎧 and apparently this is her first time with a jazz band.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'd certainly like to hear her.<br/>
🎧 Then the next thing I want to ask about is the duck races -<br/>
🎧 I saw a poster beside a river. What are they, exactly?<br/>
🎧 Well, you buy a yellow plastic duck - or as many as you like - they're a pound each.<br/>
🎧 And you write your name on each one.<br/>
🎧 There'll be several races, depending on the number of ducks taking part.<br/>
🎧 And John Stevens, a champion swimmer who lives locally, is going to start the races.<br/>
🎧 All the ducks will be launched into the river at the back of the cinema,<br/>
🎧 then they'll float along the river for 500 metres, as far as the railway bridge.<br/>
🎧 And are there any prizes?<br/>
🎧 Yes, the first duck in each race to arrive at the finishing line wins its owner free tickets for the concert on the last night of the festival.<br/>
🎧 You said you can buy a duck?<br/>
🎧 I'm sure my children will both want one.<br/>
🎧 They're on sale at a stall in the market.<br/>
🎧 You can't miss it -<br/>
🎧 it's got an enormous sign showing a couple of ducks.<br/>
🎧 OK. I'll go there this afternoon.<br/>
🎧 I remember walking past there yesterday.<br/>
🎧 Now could you tell me something about the flower show, please?<br/>
🎧 Well, admission is free,<br/>
🎧 and the show is being held in Bythwaite Hall.<br/>
🎧 Sorry, how do you spell that?<br/>
🎧 B-Y-T-H-W-A-I-T-E.<br/>
🎧 Bythwaite.<br/>
🎧 Is it easy to find?<br/>
🎧 I'm not very familiar with the town yet.<br/>
🎧 Oh, you won't have any problem.<br/>
🎧 It's right in the centre of Stretton.<br/>
🎧 It's the only old building in the town, so it's easy to recognise.<br/>
🎧 I know it.<br/>
🎧 I presume it's open all day.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but if you'd like to see the prizes being awarded for the best flowers,<br/>
🎧 you'll need to be there at 5 o'clock.<br/>
🎧 The prizes are being given by a famous actor, Kevin Shapless.<br/>
🎧 He lives nearby and gets involved in a lot of community events.<br/>
🎧 Gosh, I've seen him on TV.<br/>
🎧 I'll definitely go to the prize-giving.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I've seen a list of plays that are being performed this week,<br/>
🎧 and I'd like to know which are suitable for my children,<br/>
🎧 and which ones my husband and I might go to.<br/>
🎧 How old are your children?<br/>
🎧 Five and seven.<br/>
🎧 What about 'The Mystery of Muldoon'?<br/>
🎧 That's aimed at five to ten-year-olds.<br/>
🎧 So if I take my children, I can expect them to enjoy it more than I do?<br/>
🎧 I think so.<br/>
🎧 If you'd like something for yourself and your husband and leave your children with a babysitter,<br/>
🎧 you might like to see 'Fire and Flood' -<br/>
🎧 it's about events that really happened in Stretton 200 years ago,<br/>
🎧 and children might find it rather frightening.<br/>
🎧 Oh, thanks for the warning.<br/>
🎧 And finally, what about 'Silly Sailor'?<br/>
🎧 That's a comedy, and it's for young and old.<br/>
🎧 In fact, it won an award in the Stretton Drama Festival a couple of months ago.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Well, goodbye, and thanks for all the information.<br/>
🎧 I'm looking forward to the festival!<br/>
🎧 Goodbye.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Good morning, and welcome to the museum -<br/>
🎧 one with a remarkable range of exhibits, which I'm sure you'll enjoy.<br/>
🎧 My name's Greg, and I'll tell you about the various collections as we go around.<br/>
🎧 But before we go, let me just give you a taste of what we have here.<br/>
🎧 Well, for one thing, we have a fine collection of twentieth and twenty-first century paintings,<br/>
🎧 many by very well-known artists.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you'll recognise several of the paintings.<br/>
🎧 This is the gallery that attracts the largest number of visitors,<br/>
🎧 so it's best to go in early in the day, before the crowds arrive.<br/>
🎧 Then there are the nineteenth century paintings.<br/>
🎧 The museum was opened in the middle of that century,<br/>
🎧 and several of the artists each donated one work - to get the museum started, as it were.<br/>
🎧 So they're of special interest to us -<br/>
🎧 we feel closer to them than to other works.<br/>
🎧 The sculpture gallery has a number of fine exhibits,<br/>
🎧 but I'm afraid it's currently closed for refurbishment.<br/>
🎧 You'll need to come back next year to see it properly,<br/>
🎧 but a number of the sculptures have been moved to other parts of the museum.<br/>
🎧 'Around the world' is a temporary exhibition -<br/>
🎧 you've probably seen something about it on TV or in the newspapers.<br/>
🎧 It's created a great deal of interest, because it presents objects from every continent and many countries,<br/>
🎧 and provides information about their social context - why they were made, who for, and so on.<br/>
🎧 Then there's the collection of coins.<br/>
🎧 This is what you might call a focused, specialist collection,<br/>
🎧 because all the coins come from this country,<br/>
🎧 and were produced between two thousand and a thousand years ago.<br/>
🎧 And many of them were discovered by ordinary people digging their gardens and donated to the museum!<br/>
🎧 All our porcelain and glass was left to the museum by its founder, when he died in 1878.<br/>
🎧 And in the terms of his will, we're not allowed to add anything to that collection:<br/>
🎧 he believed it was perfect in itself, and we don't see any reason to disagree!<br/>
🎧 OK, that was something about the collections,<br/>
🎧 and now here's some more practical information, in case you need it.<br/>
🎧 Most of the museum facilities are downstairs, in the basement,<br/>
🎧 so you go down the stairs here.<br/>
🎧 When you reach the bottom of the stairs, you'll find yourself in a sitting area,<br/>
🎧 with comfortable chairs and sofas<br/>
🎧 where you can have a rest before continuing your exploration of the museum.<br/>
🎧 We have a very good restaurant, which serves excellent food all day, in a relaxing atmosphere.<br/>
🎧 To reach it, when you get to the bottom of the stairs, go straight ahead to the far side of the sitting area,<br/>
🎧 then turn right into the corridor.<br/>
🎧 You'll see the door of the restaurant facing you.<br/>
🎧 If you just want a snack, or if you'd like to eat somewhere with facilities for children,<br/>
🎧 we also have a café.<br/>
🎧 When you reach the bottom of the stairs, you'll need to go straight ahead,<br/>
🎧 turn right into the corridor, and the café is immediately on the right.<br/>
🎧 And talking about children, there are baby-changing facilities downstairs:<br/>
🎧 cross the sitting area, continue straight ahead along the corridor on the left<br/>
🎧 and you and your baby will find the facilities on the left-hand side.<br/>
🎧 The cloakroom where you should leave coats, umbrellas and any large bags,<br/>
🎧 is on the left hand side of the sitting area.<br/>
🎧 It's through the last door before you come to the corridor.<br/>
🎧 There are toilets on every floor,<br/>
🎧 but in the basement they're the first rooms on the left when you get down there.<br/>
🎧 OK, now if you've got anything to leave in the cloakroom,<br/>
🎧 please do that now, and then we'll start our tour.<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 Hi, Joanna, good to meet you.<br/>
🎧 Now, before we discuss your new research project.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to hear something about the psychology study you did last year for your Master's degree.<br/>
🎧 So how did you choose your subjects for that?<br/>
🎧 Well, I had six subjects, all professional musicians, and all female.<br/>
🎧 Three were violinists<br/>
🎧 and there was also a cello player and a pianist and a flute player.<br/>
🎧 They were all very highly regarded in the music world<br/>
🎧 and they'd done quite extensive tours in different continents,<br/>
🎧 and quite a few had won prizes in competitions as well.<br/>
🎧 And they were quite young, weren't they?<br/>
🎧 Yes, between 25 and 29 -<br/>
🎧 the mean was 27.8.<br/>
🎧 I wasn't specifically looking for artists who'd produced recordings but...<br/>
🎧 this is something that's just taken for granted these days, and they all had.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Now you collected your data through telephone interviews, didn't you?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 I realised if I was going to interview leading musicians, it'd only be possible over the phone because they're so busy.<br/>
🎧 I recorded them using a telephone recording adaptor.<br/>
🎧 I'd been worried about the quality, but it worked out all right.<br/>
🎧 I managed at least a 30-minute interview with each subject, sometimes longer.<br/>
🎧 Did doing it on the phone make it more stressful?<br/>
🎧 I'd thought it might…<br/>
🎧 it was all quite informal though and in fact they seemed very keen to talk.<br/>
🎧 And I don't think using the phone meant I got less rich data rather the opposite in fact.<br/>
🎧 Interesting.<br/>
🎧 And you were looking at how performers dress for concert performances?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 My research investigated the way players see their role as a musician<br/>
🎧 and how this is linked to the type of clothing they decide to wear.<br/>
🎧 But that focus didn't emerge immediately.<br/>
🎧 When I started I was more interested in trying to investigate the impact of what was worn on those listening,<br/>
🎧 and also whether someone like a violinist might adopt a different style of clothing from, say, someone playing the flute or the trumpet.<br/>
🎧 It's interesting that the choice of dress is up to the individual, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yes, you'd expect there to be rules about it in orchestras, but that's quite rare.<br/>
🎧 You only had women performers in your study.<br/>
🎧 Was that because male musicians are less worried about fashion?<br/>
🎧 I think a lot of the men are very much influenced by fashion,<br/>
🎧 but in social terms the choices they have are more limited…<br/>
🎧 they'd really upset audiences if they strayed away from quite narrow boundaries.<br/>
🎧 Now, popular music has quite different expectations.<br/>
🎧 Did you read Mike Frost's article about the dress of women performers in popular music...<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 where he points out that a lot of female singers and musicians in popular music tend to dress down in performances,<br/>
🎧 and wear less feminine clothes, erm, like jeans instead of skirts,<br/>
🎧 and he suggests this is because otherwise they'd just be discounted as trivial.<br/>
🎧 But you could argue they're just wearing what's practical…<br/>
🎧 I mean, a pop-music concert is usually a pretty energetic affair.<br/>
🎧 Yes, he doesn't make that point, but I think you're probably right.<br/>
🎧 I was interested by the effect of the audience at a musical performance when it came to the choice of dress.<br/>
🎧 The subjects I interviewed felt this was really important.<br/>
🎧 It's all to do with what we understand by performance as a public event.<br/>
🎧 They believed the audience had certain expectations<br/>
🎧 and it was up to them as performers to fulfill these expectations to show a kind of esteem…<br/>
🎧 they weren't afraid of looking as if they'd made an effort to look good.<br/>
🎧 I think in the past the audience would have had those expectations of one another too,<br/>
🎧 but that's not really the case now, not in the UK anyway.<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 And I also got interested in what sports scientists are doing too, with regard to clothing.<br/>
🎧 Musicians are quite vulnerable physically, aren't they, because...<br/>
🎧 the movements they carry out are very intensive and repetitive, so...<br/>
🎧 I'd imagine some features of sports clothing could safeguard the players from the potentially dangerous effects of this sort of thing.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but musicians don't really consider it.<br/>
🎧 They avoid clothing that obviously restricts their movements, but that's as far as they go.<br/>
🎧 Anyway, coming back to your own research, do you have any idea where you're going from here?<br/>
🎧 I was thinking of doing a study using an audience...<br/>
 <br/>

🎧 As we saw in the last lecture,<br/>
🎧 a major cause of climate change is the rapid rise in the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere over the last century.<br/>
🎧 If we could reduce the amount of CO2,<br/>
🎧 perhaps the rate of climate change could also be slowed down.<br/>
🎧 One potential method involves enhancing the role of the soil that plants grow in,<br/>
🎧 with regard to absorbing CO2.<br/>
🎧 Rattan Lal, a soil scientist from Ohio State University, in the USA,<br/>
🎧 claims that the world's agricultural soils could potentially absorb 13% of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere -<br/>
🎧 the equivalent of the amount released in the last 30 years.<br/>
🎧 And research is going on into how this might be achieved.<br/>
🎧 Lal first came to the idea that soil might be valuable in this way not through an interest in climate change,<br/>
🎧 but rather out of concern for the land itself and the people dependent on it.<br/>
🎧 Carbon-rich soil is dark, crumbly and fertile, and retains some water.<br/>
🎧 But erosion can occur if soil is dry,<br/>
🎧 which is a likely effect if it contains inadequate amounts of carbon.<br/>
🎧 Erosion is of course bad for people trying to grow crops or breed animals on that terrain.<br/>
🎧 In the 1970s and '80s,<br/>
🎧 Lal was studying soils in Africa so devoid of organic matter<br/>
🎧 that the ground had become extremely hard, like cement.<br/>
🎧 There he met a pioneer in the study of global warming,<br/>
🎧 who suggested that carbon from the soil had moved into the atmosphere.<br/>
🎧 This is now looking increasingly likely.<br/>
🎧 Let me explain.<br/>
🎧 For millions of years, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have been regulated, in part,<br/>
🎧 by a natural partnership between plants and microbes - tiny organisms in the soil.<br/>
🎧 Plants absorb CO2 from the air<br/>
🎧 and transform it into sugars and other carbon-based substances.<br/>
🎧 While a proportion of these carbon products remain in the plant,<br/>
🎧 some transfer from the roots to fungi and soil microbes,<br/>
🎧 which store the carbon in the soil.<br/>
🎧 The invention of agriculture some 10,000 years ago<br/>
🎧 disrupted these ancient soil-building processes<br/>
🎧 and led to the loss of carbon from the soil.<br/>
🎧 When humans started draining the natural topsoil, and ploughing it up for planting,<br/>
🎧 they exposed the buried carbon to oxygen.<br/>
🎧 This created carbon dioxide and released it into the air.<br/>
🎧 And in some places,<br/>
🎧 grazing by domesticated animals has removed all vegetation, releasing carbon into the air.<br/>
🎧 Tons of carbon have been stripped from the world's soils - where it's needed -<br/>
🎧 and pumped into the atmosphere.<br/>
🎧 So what can be done?<br/>
🎧 Researchers are now coming up with evidence that even modest changes to farming<br/>
🎧 can significantly help to reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere.<br/>
🎧 Some growers have already started using an approach known as regenerative agriculture.<br/>
🎧 This aims to boost the fertility of soil and keep it moist through established practices.<br/>
🎧 These include keeping fields planted all year round,<br/>
🎧 and increasing the variety of plants being grown.<br/>
🎧 Strategies like these can significantly increase the amount of carbon stored in the soil,<br/>
🎧 so agricultural researchers are now building a case for their use in combating climate change.<br/>
🎧 One American investigation into the potential for storing CO2 on agricultural lands is taking place in California.<br/>
🎧 Soil scientist Whendee Silver of the University of California, Berkeley,<br/>
🎧 is conducting a first-of-its-kind study on a large cattle farm in the state.<br/>
🎧 She and her students are testing the effects on carbon storage of the compost that is created from waste -<br/>
🎧 both agricultural, including manure and cornstalks,<br/>
🎧 and waste produced in gardens, such as leaves, branches, and lawn trimmings.<br/>
🎧 In Australia, soil ecologist Christine Jones is testing another promising soil-enrichment strategy.<br/>
🎧 Jones and 12 farmers are working to build up soil carbon by cultivating grasses that stay green all year round.<br/>
🎧 Like composting, the approach has already been proved experimentally;<br/>
🎧 Jones now hopes to show that it can be applied on working farms<br/>
🎧 and that the resulting carbon capture can be accurately measured.<br/>
🎧 It's hoped in the future that projects such as these<br/>
🎧 will demonstrate the role that farmers and other land managers can play in reducing the harmful effects of greenhouse gases.<br/>
🎧 For example, in countries like the United States,<br/>
🎧 where most farming operations use large applications of fertiliser,<br/>
🎧 changing such long-standing habits will require a change of system.<br/>
🎧 Rattan Lal argues that farmers should receive payment not just for the corn or beef they produce<br/>
🎧 but also for the carbon they can store in their soil.<br/>
🎧 Another study being..<br/>
<br/><br/>
