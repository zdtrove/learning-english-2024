🎧 Good morning. <span>Stretton</span> <span>Festival</span> box <span>office</span>. How can I help you?<br/>
🎧 Oh, hello.<br/>
🎧 My <span>family</span> and I are on <span>holiday</span> in the <span>area</span>,<br/>
🎧 and we've <span>seen</span> some <span>posters</span> about the <span>festival</span> this week.<br/>
🎧 Could you tell me about some of the <span>events</span>, please?<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 First of all, are there still <span>tickets</span> <span>available</span> for the <span>jazz</span> <span>band</span> on <span>Saturday</span>?<br/>
🎧 There are, but only <span>£15</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>£12</span> <span>seats</span> have all been <span>sold</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK. And the <span>venue</span> is the school, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that's right, the <span>secondary</span> school.<br/>
🎧 Make sure you don't go to the <span>primary</span> school by <span>mistake</span>!<br/>
🎧 And there's an <span>additional</span> <span>performer</span> who isn't <span>mentioned</span> on the <span>posters</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Carolyn</span> <span>Hart</span> is going to play with the <span>band</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I think I've heard her on the <span>radio</span>.<br/>
🎧 Doesn't she play the <span>oboe</span>, or <span>flute</span> or something?<br/>
🎧 Yes the <span>flute</span>.<br/>
🎧 She usually <span>plays</span> with <span>symphony</span> <span>orchestras</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>apparently</span> this is her first time with a <span>jazz</span> <span>band</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'd <span>certainly</span> like to hear her.<br/>
🎧 Then the next thing I want to ask about is the <span>duck</span> <span>races</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 I saw a <span>poster</span> <span>beside</span> a <span>river</span>. What are they, exactly?<br/>
🎧 Well, you buy a <span>yellow</span> <span>plastic</span> <span>duck</span> <span>-</span> or as many as you like <span>-</span> they're a <span>pound</span> each.<br/>
🎧 And you <span>write</span> your name on each one.<br/>
🎧 <span>There'll</span> be <span>several</span> <span>races</span>, <span>depending</span> on the number of <span>ducks</span> taking <span>part</span>.<br/>
🎧 And <span>John</span> <span>Stevens</span>, a <span>champion</span> <span>swimmer</span> who lives <span>locally</span>, is going to start the <span>races</span>.<br/>
🎧 All the <span>ducks</span> will be <span>launched</span> into the <span>river</span> at the back of the <span>cinema</span>,<br/>
🎧 then they'll <span>float</span> along the <span>river</span> for <span>500</span> <span>metres</span>, as <span>far</span> as the <span>railway</span> <span>bridge</span>.<br/>
🎧 And are there any <span>prizes</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, the first <span>duck</span> in each <span>race</span> to <span>arrive</span> at the <span>finishing</span> <span>line</span> <span>wins</span> its <span>owner</span> free <span>tickets</span> for the <span>concert</span> on the last <span>night</span> of the <span>festival</span>.<br/>
🎧 You said you can buy a <span>duck</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm sure my children will both want one.<br/>
🎧 They're on <span>sale</span> at a <span>stall</span> in the <span>market</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can't <span>miss</span> it <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it's got an <span>enormous</span> <span>sign</span> <span>showing</span> a <span>couple</span> of <span>ducks</span>.<br/>
🎧 OK. I'll go there this <span>afternoon</span>.<br/>
🎧 I remember <span>walking</span> <span>past</span> there <span>yesterday</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now could you tell me something about the <span>flower</span> show, please?<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>admission</span> is free,<br/>
🎧 and the show is being <span>held</span> in <span>Bythwaite</span> <span>Hall</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sorry, how do you <span>spell</span> that?<br/>
🎧 <span>B-Y-T-H-W-A-I-T-E</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Bythwaite</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is it easy to find?<br/>
🎧 I'm not very <span>familiar</span> with the <span>town</span> yet.<br/>
🎧 Oh, you won't have any <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's right in the <span>centre</span> of <span>Stretton</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's the only old <span>building</span> in the <span>town</span>, so it's easy to <span>recognise</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know it.<br/>
🎧 I <span>presume</span> it's open all day.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but if you'd like to see the <span>prizes</span> being <span>awarded</span> for the best <span>flowers</span>,<br/>
🎧 you'll need to be there at <span>5</span> <span>o'clock</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>prizes</span> are being <span>given</span> by a famous <span>actor</span>, <span>Kevin</span> <span>Shapless</span>.<br/>
🎧 He lives <span>nearby</span> and <span>gets</span> <span>involved</span> in a lot of <span>community</span> <span>events</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Gosh</span>, I've <span>seen</span> him on <span>TV</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll definitely go to the <span>prize-giving</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I've <span>seen</span> a <span>list</span> of <span>plays</span> that are being <span>performed</span> this week,<br/>
🎧 and I'd like to know which are <span>suitable</span> for my children,<br/>
🎧 and which <span>ones</span> my <span>husband</span> and I might go to.<br/>
🎧 How old are your children?<br/>
🎧 <span>Five</span> and <span>seven</span>.<br/>
🎧 What about <span>'The</span> <span>Mystery</span> of <span>Muldoon'</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's <span>aimed</span> at <span>five</span> to <span>ten-year-olds</span>.<br/>
🎧 So if I take my children, I can <span>expect</span> them to enjoy it more than I do?<br/>
🎧 I think so.<br/>
🎧 If you'd like something for yourself and your <span>husband</span> and leave your children with a <span>babysitter</span>,<br/>
🎧 you might like to see <span>'Fire</span> and <span>Flood'</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 it's about <span>events</span> that really <span>happened</span> in <span>Stretton</span> <span>200</span> years ago,<br/>
🎧 and children might find it rather <span>frightening</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, thanks for the <span>warning</span>.<br/>
🎧 And finally, what about <span>'Silly</span> <span>Sailor'</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's a <span>comedy</span>, and it's for young and old.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, it <span>won</span> an <span>award</span> in the <span>Stretton</span> <span>Drama</span> <span>Festival</span> a <span>couple</span> of <span>months</span> ago.<br/>
🎧 OK.<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>goodbye</span>, and thanks for all the <span>information</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm looking forward to the <span>festival</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Goodbye</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Good morning, and <span>welcome</span> to the <span>museum</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 one with a <span>remarkable</span> <span>range</span> of <span>exhibits</span>, which I'm sure you'll enjoy.<br/>
🎧 My <span>name's</span> <span>Greg</span>, and I'll tell you about the <span>various</span> <span>collections</span> as we go around.<br/>
🎧 But before we go, let me just give you a <span>taste</span> of what we have here.<br/>
🎧 Well, for one thing, we have a fine <span>collection</span> of <span>twentieth</span> and <span>twenty-first</span> <span>century</span> <span>paintings</span>,<br/>
🎧 many by very <span>well-known</span> <span>artists</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you'll <span>recognise</span> <span>several</span> of the <span>paintings</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is the <span>gallery</span> that <span>attracts</span> the <span>largest</span> number of <span>visitors</span>,<br/>
🎧 so it's best to go in <span>early</span> in the day, before the <span>crowds</span> <span>arrive</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then there are the <span>nineteenth</span> <span>century</span> <span>paintings</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>museum</span> was <span>opened</span> in the <span>middle</span> of that <span>century</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>several</span> of the <span>artists</span> each <span>donated</span> one work <span>-</span> to get the <span>museum</span> <span>started</span>, as it were.<br/>
🎧 So they're of special <span>interest</span> to us <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 we feel <span>closer</span> to them than to other <span>works</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>sculpture</span> <span>gallery</span> has a number of fine <span>exhibits</span>,<br/>
🎧 but I'm <span>afraid</span> it's <span>currently</span> <span>closed</span> for <span>refurbishment</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll need to come back next year to see it <span>properly</span>,<br/>
🎧 but a number of the <span>sculptures</span> have been <span>moved</span> to other <span>parts</span> of the <span>museum</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>'Around</span> the <span>world'</span> is a <span>temporary</span> <span>exhibition</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 you've probably <span>seen</span> something about it on <span>TV</span> or in the <span>newspapers</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>created</span> a great <span>deal</span> of <span>interest</span>, because it <span>presents</span> <span>objects</span> from every <span>continent</span> and many <span>countries</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>provides</span> <span>information</span> about their <span>social</span> <span>context</span> <span>-</span> why they were made, who for, and so on.<br/>
🎧 Then there's the <span>collection</span> of <span>coins</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is what you might call a <span>focused</span>, <span>specialist</span> <span>collection</span>,<br/>
🎧 because all the <span>coins</span> come from this <span>country</span>,<br/>
🎧 and were <span>produced</span> between two <span>thousand</span> and a <span>thousand</span> years ago.<br/>
🎧 And many of them were <span>discovered</span> by <span>ordinary</span> people <span>digging</span> their <span>gardens</span> and <span>donated</span> to the <span>museum</span>!<br/>
🎧 All our <span>porcelain</span> and <span>glass</span> was <span>left</span> to the <span>museum</span> by its <span>founder</span>, when he <span>died</span> in <span>1878</span>.<br/>
🎧 And in the <span>terms</span> of his will, we're not <span>allowed</span> to add anything to that <span>collection:<br/></span>
🎧 he <span>believed</span> it was perfect in <span>itself</span>, and we don't see any <span>reason</span> to <span>disagree</span>!<br/>
🎧 OK, that was something about the <span>collections</span>,<br/>
🎧 and now here's some more <span>practical</span> <span>information</span>, in case you need it.<br/>
🎧 Most of the <span>museum</span> <span>facilities</span> are <span>downstairs</span>, in the <span>basement</span>,<br/>
🎧 so you go down the <span>stairs</span> here.<br/>
🎧 When you <span>reach</span> the <span>bottom</span> of the <span>stairs</span>, you'll find yourself in a <span>sitting</span> <span>area</span>,<br/>
🎧 with <span>comfortable</span> <span>chairs</span> and <span>sofas<br/></span>
🎧 where you can have a <span>rest</span> before <span>continuing</span> your <span>exploration</span> of the <span>museum</span>.<br/>
🎧 We have a very good <span>restaurant</span>, which <span>serves</span> <span>excellent</span> food all day, in a <span>relaxing</span> <span>atmosphere</span>.<br/>
🎧 To <span>reach</span> it, when you get to the <span>bottom</span> of the <span>stairs</span>, go <span>straight</span> <span>ahead</span> to the <span>far</span> side of the <span>sitting</span> <span>area</span>,<br/>
🎧 then <span>turn</span> right into the <span>corridor</span>.<br/>
🎧 You'll see the <span>door</span> of the <span>restaurant</span> <span>facing</span> you.<br/>
🎧 If you just want a <span>snack</span>, or if you'd like to eat somewhere with <span>facilities</span> for children,<br/>
🎧 we also have a <span>café</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you <span>reach</span> the <span>bottom</span> of the <span>stairs</span>, you'll need to go <span>straight</span> <span>ahead</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>turn</span> right into the <span>corridor</span>, and the <span>café</span> is <span>immediately</span> on the right.<br/>
🎧 And talking about children, there are <span>baby-changing</span> <span>facilities</span> <span>downstairs:<br/></span>
🎧 <span>cross</span> the <span>sitting</span> <span>area</span>, <span>continue</span> <span>straight</span> <span>ahead</span> along the <span>corridor</span> on the <span>left<br/></span>
🎧 and you and your <span>baby</span> will find the <span>facilities</span> on the <span>left-hand</span> side.<br/>
🎧 The <span>cloakroom</span> where you should leave <span>coats</span>, <span>umbrellas</span> and any large <span>bags</span>,<br/>
🎧 is on the <span>left</span> <span>hand</span> side of the <span>sitting</span> <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's through the last <span>door</span> before you come to the <span>corridor</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>toilets</span> on every <span>floor</span>,<br/>
🎧 but in the <span>basement</span> they're the first <span>rooms</span> on the <span>left</span> when you get down there.<br/>
🎧 OK, now if you've got anything to leave in the <span>cloakroom</span>,<br/>
🎧 please do that now, and then we'll start our <span>tour</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

🎧 Hi, <span>Joanna</span>, good to meet you.<br/>
🎧 Now, before we <span>discuss</span> your new <span>research</span> <span>project</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to hear something about the <span>psychology</span> <span>study</span> you did last year for your <span>Master's</span> <span>degree</span>.<br/>
🎧 So how did you choose your <span>subjects</span> for that?<br/>
🎧 Well, I had six <span>subjects</span>, all <span>professional</span> <span>musicians</span>, and all <span>female</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Three</span> were <span>violinists<br/></span>
🎧 and there was also a <span>cello</span> <span>player</span> and a <span>pianist</span> and a <span>flute</span> <span>player</span>.<br/>
🎧 They were all very <span>highly</span> <span>regarded</span> in the music <span>world<br/></span>
🎧 and they'd done quite <span>extensive</span> <span>tours</span> in different <span>continents</span>,<br/>
🎧 and quite a few had <span>won</span> <span>prizes</span> in <span>competitions</span> as well.<br/>
🎧 And they were quite young, weren't they?<br/>
🎧 Yes, between <span>25</span> and <span>29</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 the mean was <span>27.8</span>.<br/>
🎧 I wasn't <span>specifically</span> looking for <span>artists</span> who'd <span>produced</span> <span>recordings</span> <span>but..</span>.<br/>
🎧 this is something that's just taken for <span>granted</span> these <span>days</span>, and they all had.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Now you <span>collected</span> your <span>data</span> through <span>telephone</span> <span>interviews</span>, didn't you?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 I <span>realised</span> if I was going to <span>interview</span> <span>leading</span> <span>musicians</span>, it'd only be <span>possible</span> over the phone because they're so <span>busy</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>recorded</span> them <span>using</span> a <span>telephone</span> <span>recording</span> <span>adaptor</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd been <span>worried</span> about the <span>quality</span>, but it <span>worked</span> out all right.<br/>
🎧 I <span>managed</span> at <span>least</span> a <span>30-minute</span> <span>interview</span> with each <span>subject</span>, sometimes <span>longer</span>.<br/>
🎧 Did doing it on the phone make it more <span>stressful</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'd thought it <span>might…<br/></span>
🎧 it was all quite <span>informal</span> though and in <span>fact</span> they <span>seemed</span> very <span>keen</span> to talk.<br/>
🎧 And I don't think <span>using</span> the phone <span>meant</span> I got less <span>rich</span> <span>data</span> rather the <span>opposite</span> in <span>fact</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 And you were looking at how <span>performers</span> <span>dress</span> for <span>concert</span> <span>performances</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 My <span>research</span> <span>investigated</span> the way <span>players</span> see their <span>role</span> as a <span>musician<br/></span>
🎧 and how this is <span>linked</span> to the <span>type</span> of <span>clothing</span> they decide to <span>wear</span>.<br/>
🎧 But that focus didn't <span>emerge</span> <span>immediately</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I <span>started</span> I was more interested in trying to <span>investigate</span> the <span>impact</span> of what was <span>worn</span> on those <span>listening</span>,<br/>
🎧 and also <span>whether</span> <span>someone</span> like a <span>violinist</span> might <span>adopt</span> a different <span>style</span> of <span>clothing</span> from, say, <span>someone</span> playing the <span>flute</span> or the <span>trumpet</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>interesting</span> that the <span>choice</span> of <span>dress</span> is up to the <span>individual</span>, isn't it?<br/>
🎧 Yes, you'd <span>expect</span> there to be <span>rules</span> about it in <span>orchestras</span>, but that's quite <span>rare</span>.<br/>
🎧 You only had <span>women</span> <span>performers</span> in your <span>study</span>.<br/>
🎧 Was that because <span>male</span> <span>musicians</span> are less <span>worried</span> about <span>fashion</span>?<br/>
🎧 I think a lot of the men are very much <span>influenced</span> by <span>fashion</span>,<br/>
🎧 but in <span>social</span> <span>terms</span> the <span>choices</span> they have are more <span>limited…<br/></span>
🎧 they'd really <span>upset</span> <span>audiences</span> if they <span>strayed</span> away from quite <span>narrow</span> <span>boundaries</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, <span>popular</span> music has quite different <span>expectations</span>.<br/>
🎧 Did you read <span>Mike</span> <span>Frost's</span> <span>article</span> about the <span>dress</span> of <span>women</span> <span>performers</span> in <span>popular</span> <span>music..</span>.<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 where he <span>points</span> out that a lot of <span>female</span> <span>singers</span> and <span>musicians</span> in <span>popular</span> music <span>tend</span> to <span>dress</span> down in <span>performances</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>wear</span> less <span>feminine</span> <span>clothes</span>, <span>erm</span>, like <span>jeans</span> <span>instead</span> of <span>skirts</span>,<br/>
🎧 and he <span>suggests</span> this is because <span>otherwise</span> they'd just be <span>discounted</span> as <span>trivial</span>.<br/>
🎧 But you could <span>argue</span> they're just <span>wearing</span> what's <span>practical…<br/></span>
🎧 I mean, a <span>pop-music</span> <span>concert</span> is usually a <span>pretty</span> <span>energetic</span> <span>affair</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, he doesn't make that <span>point</span>, but I think you're probably right.<br/>
🎧 I was interested by the <span>effect</span> of the <span>audience</span> at a <span>musical</span> <span>performance</span> when it came to the <span>choice</span> of <span>dress</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>subjects</span> I <span>interviewed</span> <span>felt</span> this was really important.<br/>
🎧 It's all to do with what we <span>understand</span> by <span>performance</span> as a <span>public</span> <span>event</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>believed</span> the <span>audience</span> had <span>certain</span> <span>expectations<br/></span>
🎧 and it was up to them as <span>performers</span> to <span>fulfill</span> these <span>expectations</span> to show a kind of <span>esteem…<br/></span>
🎧 they weren't <span>afraid</span> of looking as if they'd made an <span>effort</span> to look good.<br/>
🎧 I think in the <span>past</span> the <span>audience</span> would have had those <span>expectations</span> of one another too,<br/>
🎧 but that's not really the case now, not in the <span>UK</span> <span>anyway</span>.<br/>
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 And I also got interested in what <span>sports</span> <span>scientists</span> are doing too, with <span>regard</span> to <span>clothing</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Musicians</span> are quite <span>vulnerable</span> <span>physically</span>, aren't they, <span>because..</span>.<br/>
🎧 the <span>movements</span> they <span>carry</span> out are very <span>intensive</span> and <span>repetitive</span>, <span>so..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd <span>imagine</span> some <span>features</span> of <span>sports</span> <span>clothing</span> could <span>safeguard</span> the <span>players</span> from the <span>potentially</span> <span>dangerous</span> <span>effects</span> of this <span>sort</span> of thing.<br/>
🎧 Yes, but <span>musicians</span> don't really <span>consider</span> it.<br/>
🎧 They <span>avoid</span> <span>clothing</span> that <span>obviously</span> <span>restricts</span> their <span>movements</span>, but that's as <span>far</span> as they go.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, <span>coming</span> back to your own <span>research</span>, do you have any idea where you're going from here?<br/>
🎧 I was thinking of doing a <span>study</span> <span>using</span> an <span>audience..</span>.<br/>

🎧 As we saw in the last <span>lecture</span>,<br/>
🎧 a <span>major</span> <span>cause</span> of <span>climate</span> change is the <span>rapid</span> <span>rise</span> in the <span>level</span> of <span>carbon</span> <span>dioxide</span> in the <span>atmosphere</span> over the last <span>century</span>.<br/>
🎧 If we could <span>reduce</span> the amount of <span>CO2</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>perhaps</span> the <span>rate</span> of <span>climate</span> change could also be <span>slowed</span> down.<br/>
🎧 One <span>potential</span> <span>method</span> <span>involves</span> <span>enhancing</span> the <span>role</span> of the <span>soil</span> that <span>plants</span> <span>grow</span> in,<br/>
🎧 with <span>regard</span> to <span>absorbing</span> <span>CO2</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Rattan</span> <span>Lal</span>, a <span>soil</span> <span>scientist</span> from <span>Ohio</span> <span>State</span> University, in the <span>USA</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>claims</span> that the <span>world's</span> <span>agricultural</span> <span>soils</span> could <span>potentially</span> <span>absorb</span> <span>13%</span> of the <span>carbon</span> <span>dioxide</span> in the <span>atmosphere</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 the <span>equivalent</span> of the amount <span>released</span> in the last <span>30</span> years.<br/>
🎧 And <span>research</span> is going on into how this might be <span>achieved</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Lal</span> first came to the idea that <span>soil</span> might be <span>valuable</span> in this way not through an <span>interest</span> in <span>climate</span> change,<br/>
🎧 but rather out of <span>concern</span> for the <span>land</span> <span>itself</span> and the people <span>dependent</span> on it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Carbon-rich</span> <span>soil</span> is <span>dark</span>, <span>crumbly</span> and <span>fertile</span>, and <span>retains</span> some water.<br/>
🎧 But <span>erosion</span> can <span>occur</span> if <span>soil</span> is dry,<br/>
🎧 which is a <span>likely</span> <span>effect</span> if it <span>contains</span> <span>inadequate</span> <span>amounts</span> of <span>carbon</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Erosion</span> is of course bad for people trying to <span>grow</span> <span>crops</span> or <span>breed</span> <span>animals</span> on that <span>terrain</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>1970s</span> and <span>'80s</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>Lal</span> was <span>studying</span> <span>soils</span> in <span>Africa</span> so <span>devoid</span> of <span>organic</span> <span>matter<br/></span>
🎧 that the <span>ground</span> had become <span>extremely</span> <span>hard</span>, like <span>cement</span>.<br/>
🎧 There he <span>met</span> a <span>pioneer</span> in the <span>study</span> of <span>global</span> <span>warming</span>,<br/>
🎧 who <span>suggested</span> that <span>carbon</span> from the <span>soil</span> had <span>moved</span> into the <span>atmosphere</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is now looking <span>increasingly</span> <span>likely</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let me <span>explain</span>.<br/>
🎧 For <span>millions</span> of years, <span>carbon</span> <span>dioxide</span> <span>levels</span> in the <span>atmosphere</span> have been <span>regulated</span>, in <span>part</span>,<br/>
🎧 by a <span>natural</span> <span>partnership</span> between <span>plants</span> and <span>microbes</span> <span>-</span> <span>tiny</span> <span>organisms</span> in the <span>soil</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Plants</span> <span>absorb</span> <span>CO2</span> from the <span>air<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>transform</span> it into <span>sugars</span> and other <span>carbon-based</span> <span>substances</span>.<br/>
🎧 While a <span>proportion</span> of these <span>carbon</span> <span>products</span> <span>remain</span> in the <span>plant</span>,<br/>
🎧 some <span>transfer</span> from the <span>roots</span> to <span>fungi</span> and <span>soil</span> <span>microbes</span>,<br/>
🎧 which <span>store</span> the <span>carbon</span> in the <span>soil</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>invention</span> of <span>agriculture</span> some <span>10,000</span> years <span>ago<br/></span>
🎧 <span>disrupted</span> these <span>ancient</span> <span>soil-building</span> <span>processes<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>led</span> to the <span>loss</span> of <span>carbon</span> from the <span>soil</span>.<br/>
🎧 When <span>humans</span> <span>started</span> <span>draining</span> the <span>natural</span> <span>topsoil</span>, and <span>ploughing</span> it up for <span>planting</span>,<br/>
🎧 they <span>exposed</span> the <span>buried</span> <span>carbon</span> to <span>oxygen</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>created</span> <span>carbon</span> <span>dioxide</span> and <span>released</span> it into the air.<br/>
🎧 And in some <span>places</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>grazing</span> by <span>domesticated</span> <span>animals</span> has <span>removed</span> all <span>vegetation</span>, <span>releasing</span> <span>carbon</span> into the air.<br/>
🎧 <span>Tons</span> of <span>carbon</span> have been <span>stripped</span> from the <span>world's</span> <span>soils</span> <span>-</span> where it's <span>needed</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>pumped</span> into the <span>atmosphere</span>.<br/>
🎧 So what can be done?<br/>
🎧 <span>Researchers</span> are now <span>coming</span> up with <span>evidence</span> that even <span>modest</span> changes to <span>farming<br/></span>
🎧 can <span>significantly</span> help to <span>reduce</span> the amount of <span>carbon</span> in the <span>atmosphere</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>growers</span> have already <span>started</span> <span>using</span> an <span>approach</span> <span>known</span> as <span>regenerative</span> <span>agriculture</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>aims</span> to <span>boost</span> the <span>fertility</span> of <span>soil</span> and keep it <span>moist</span> through <span>established</span> <span>practices</span>.<br/>
🎧 These <span>include</span> <span>keeping</span> <span>fields</span> <span>planted</span> all year <span>round</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>increasing</span> the <span>variety</span> of <span>plants</span> being <span>grown</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Strategies</span> like these can <span>significantly</span> <span>increase</span> the amount of <span>carbon</span> <span>stored</span> in the <span>soil</span>,<br/>
🎧 so <span>agricultural</span> <span>researchers</span> are now <span>building</span> a case for their use in <span>combating</span> <span>climate</span> change.<br/>
🎧 One <span>American</span> <span>investigation</span> into the <span>potential</span> for <span>storing</span> <span>CO2</span> on <span>agricultural</span> <span>lands</span> is taking place in <span>California</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Soil</span> <span>scientist</span> <span>Whendee</span> <span>Silver</span> of the University of <span>California</span>, <span>Berkeley</span>,<br/>
🎧 is <span>conducting</span> a <span>first-of-its-kind</span> <span>study</span> on a large <span>cattle</span> <span>farm</span> in the <span>state</span>.<br/>
🎧 She and her students are <span>testing</span> the <span>effects</span> on <span>carbon</span> <span>storage</span> of the <span>compost</span> that is <span>created</span> from <span>waste</span> <span>-<br/></span>
🎧 both <span>agricultural</span>, <span>including</span> <span>manure</span> and <span>cornstalks</span>,<br/>
🎧 and <span>waste</span> <span>produced</span> in <span>gardens</span>, such as leaves, <span>branches</span>, and <span>lawn</span> <span>trimmings</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>Australia</span>, <span>soil</span> <span>ecologist</span> <span>Christine</span> <span>Jones</span> is <span>testing</span> another <span>promising</span> <span>soil-enrichment</span> <span>strategy</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Jones</span> and <span>12</span> <span>farmers</span> are working to <span>build</span> up <span>soil</span> <span>carbon</span> by <span>cultivating</span> <span>grasses</span> that <span>stay</span> <span>green</span> all year <span>round</span>.<br/>
🎧 Like <span>composting</span>, the <span>approach</span> has already been <span>proved</span> <span>experimentally;<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Jones</span> now <span>hopes</span> to show that it can be <span>applied</span> on working <span>farms<br/></span>
🎧 and that the <span>resulting</span> <span>carbon</span> <span>capture</span> can be <span>accurately</span> <span>measured</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>hoped</span> in the future that <span>projects</span> such as <span>these<br/></span>
🎧 will <span>demonstrate</span> the <span>role</span> that <span>farmers</span> and other <span>land</span> <span>managers</span> can play in <span>reducing</span> the <span>harmful</span> <span>effects</span> of <span>greenhouse</span> <span>gases</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, in <span>countries</span> like the <span>United</span> <span>States</span>,<br/>
🎧 where most <span>farming</span> <span>operations</span> use large <span>applications</span> of <span>fertiliser</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>changing</span> such <span>long-standing</span> <span>habits</span> will <span>require</span> a change of <span>system</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Rattan</span> <span>Lal</span> <span>argues</span> that <span>farmers</span> should <span>receive</span> <span>payment</span> not just for the <span>corn</span> or <span>beef</span> they <span>produce<br/></span>
🎧 but also for the <span>carbon</span> they can <span>store</span> in their <span>soil</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another <span>study</span> <span>being.</span>.<br/>
