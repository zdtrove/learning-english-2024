🎧 Okay. What would you like to know?<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm new to this area</span>,<br/>
🎧 so perhaps</span> you could tell me something about the park</span> first, please.<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 Altogether</span> the park</span> covers</span> 170</span> acres</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's 69</span> hectares</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are three</span> main</span> types</span> of habitat</span>:<br/>
🎧 wetland</span>, grassland</span> and woodland</span>.<br/>
🎧 The woods</span> are well established</span> and varied</span>,<br/>
🎧 with an oak</span> plantation</span>, and other areas</span> of mixed</span> species</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 The wetland</span> is quite varied</span>, too.<br/>
🎧 The original</span> farmland</span> was dug</span> up around 40</span> years ago to extract</span> gravel</span>.<br/>
🎧 Once this work was completed</span>,<br/>
🎧 the gravel</span> pits</span> filled</span> with water, forming</span> the two large lakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are also several</span> smaller</span> ones</span>, ponds</span> and a stream</span> that flows</span> through the park</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, so I suppose</span> with these different habitats</span> there's quite a variety</span> of wildlife</span>.<br/>
🎧 There certainly</span> is.<br/>
🎧 A lot of different species</span> of birds</span> and insects</span>,<br/>
🎧 and also animals</span> like deer</span> and rabbits</span>.<br/>
🎧 And I understand</span> you organise</span> educational</span> visits</span> for school parties</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 We can organise</span> a wide</span> range</span> of activities</span> and adapt</span> them to suit</span> all ages</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can you give me some examples</span> of the activities</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, one focus is on science</span>,<br/>
🎧 where we help children to discover</span> and study</span> plants</span>, trees</span> and insects</span>.<br/>
🎧 They also collect</span> and analyse</span> data</span> about the things they see.<br/>
🎧 Another focus is on geography</span>.<br/>
🎧 The park</span> is a great environment</span> to learn and practise</span> reading</span> a map<br/></span>
🎧 and using</span> a compass</span> to navigate</span> around the park</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you do anything connected</span> with history</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, we do.<br/>
🎧 For instance</span>, the children can explore</span> how the use of the land</span> has changed</span> over time.<br/>
🎧 Then there's leisure</span> and tourism</span>.<br/>
🎧 That focuses</span> on your visitors</span>, I would imagine</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, mostly</span>.<br/>
🎧 The children find out about them,<br/>
🎧 their requirements</span>, the problems</span> they may cause</span> and how we manage</span> these.<br/>
🎧 And another subject</span> we cover</span> is music:<br/>
🎧 here the children experiment</span> with natural</span> materials</span> to create</span> sounds<br/></span>
🎧 and explore</span> rhythm</span> and tempo</span>.<br/>
🎧 That must be fun!<br/>
🎧 Most children really enjoy it.<br/>
🎧 And of course, all the activities</span> are educational</span>, too.<br/>
🎧 Learning</span> outside the classroom</span> encourages</span> children to be creative</span>,<br/>
🎧 and to explore</span> and discover</span> for themselves</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would imagine</span> they get a sense</span> of freedom</span> that might not be a normal</span> part</span> of their lives.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 And very often the children discover</span> that they can do things they didn't know they could do,<br/>
🎧 and they develop</span> new skills</span>.<br/>
🎧 This gives</span> them greater</span> self-confidence</span>.<br/>
🎧 It sounds great.<br/>
🎧 So, what about the practical</span> side of it?<br/>
🎧 How much does it cost</span> for a full-day</span> visit?<br/>
🎧 We would expect</span> to bring</span> between 30</span> and 40</span> children.<br/>
🎧 If there are over 30</span>,<br/>
🎧 it costs</span> £4.95</span> for each child</span> who attends</span> on the day.<br/>
🎧 We invoice</span> you afterwards</span>,<br/>
🎧 so you don't pay for children who can't come because of sickness</span>, for example.<br/>
🎧 There's no charge</span> for leaders</span> and other adults</span> -</span> as many as you want to bring</span>.<br/>
🎧 That sounds very fair</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, thanks for all the information</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll need to discuss</span> it with my colleagues</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I hope to get back to you soon to make a booking</span>.<br/>
🎧 We'll look forward to hearing</span> from you.<br/>
🎧 Goodbye</span>.<br/>
🎧 Goodbye</span>, and thank you.<br/>

🎧 It's great to see so many members</span> of the Twinning</span> Association</span> here tonight</span>.<br/>
🎧 Since the twinning</span> link</span> between our two towns</span>, Stanthorpe</span> here in England</span> and Malatte</span> in France</span>, was established</span>,<br/>
🎧 the relationship</span> between the towns</span> has gone</span> from strength</span> to strength</span>.<br/>
🎧 Last month, 25</span> members</span> of the association</span> from Stanthorpe</span> spent</span> a weekend in Malatte</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our hosts</span> had arranged</span> a great programme</span>.<br/>
🎧 We learned</span> how cheese</span> is produced</span> in the region<br/></span>
🎧 and had the chance</span> to taste</span> the products</span>.<br/>
🎧 The theme</span> park</span> trip</span> had to be cancelled</span>,<br/>
🎧 but we all had a great time on the final</span> boat</span> trip</span> down the river</span>,<br/>
🎧 that was the real</span> highlight</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is a special year for the Association<br/></span>
🎧 because it's 25</span> years since we were founded</span>.<br/>
🎧 In Malatte</span>, they're planning to mark</span> this by building</span> a footbridge</span> in the municipal</span> park</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've been discussing</span> what to do here<br/></span>
🎧 and we've decided</span> to plant</span> a poplar</span> tree</span> in the museum</span> gardens</span>.<br/>
🎧 We considered</span> buying</span> a garden seat</span> to put there,<br/>
🎧 but the authorities</span> weren't happy with that idea.<br/>
🎧 In terms</span> of fundraising</span> to support</span> our activities</span>,<br/>
🎧 we've done very well.<br/>
🎧 Our pancake</span> evening</span> was well attended</span> and made record</span> profits</span>.<br/>
🎧 And everyone enjoyed</span> the demonstration</span> of French</span> cookery</span>,<br/>
🎧 which was nearly</span> as successful</span>.<br/>
🎧 Numbers</span> for our film</span> show were limited</span> because of the venue<br/></span>
🎧 so we're looking for somewhere bigger</span> next year.<br/>
🎧 We're looking forward to welcoming</span> our French</span> visitors</span> here next week,<br/>
🎧 and I know that many of you here will be hosting</span> individuals</span> or families</span>.<br/>
🎧 The coach</span> from France</span> will arrive</span> at 5</span> pm on Friday</span>.<br/>
🎧 Don't try to do too much that first evening</span> as they'll be tired</span>,<br/>
🎧 so have dinner in the house or garden rather than eating</span> out.<br/>
🎧 The weather</span> looks as if it'll be okay<br/></span>
🎧 so you might like to plan a barbecue</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then the next morning's</span> market</span> day in town</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that's always a good place to stroll</span> round</span>.<br/>
🎧 On Saturday</span> evening</span>, we'll all meet up at the football</span> club</span>,<br/>
🎧 where once again we'll have Toby</span> Sharp</span> and his band<br/></span>
🎧 performing</span> English and Scottish</span> country</span> songs</span>.<br/>
🎧 Toby</span> will already be well known</span> to many of you<br/></span>
🎧 as last year he organised</span> our special quiz</span> night</span> and presented</span> the prizes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now on Sunday</span>, we'll be taking our visitors</span> to Farley</span> House.<br/>
🎧 You may not all be familiar</span> with it, so here's a map to help you.<br/>
🎧 You can see the car park</span> at the bottom</span> of the map.<br/>
🎧 There's an excellent</span> farm</span> shop</span> in the grounds</span> where our visitors</span> can buy local</span> produce</span>,<br/>
🎧 it's in the old stables</span>, which is the first building</span> you come to.<br/>
🎧 They're built</span> round</span> a courtyard</span>, and the shop's</span> in the far</span> corner</span> on the left</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's also a small café</span> on the right as you go in.<br/>
🎧 I know that one or two of our visitors</span> may not be all that mobile</span>.<br/>
🎧 The main</span> entrance</span> to the house has a lot of steps<br/></span>
🎧 so you might want to use the disabled</span> entry</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is on the far</span> side of the house from the car park</span>.<br/>
🎧 Children will probably be most interested in the adventure</span> playground</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's at the northern</span> end of the larger</span> lake</span>,<br/>
🎧 in a bend</span> on the path</span> that leads</span> to the lake</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's lots for children to do there.<br/>
🎧 There are a number of lovely</span> gardens</span> near the house.<br/>
🎧 The kitchen</span> gardens</span> are rectangular</span> and surrounded</span> by a wall</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're to the north-east</span> of the house, quite near the smaller</span> lake</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're still in use and have a great collection</span> of fruit</span> and vegetables</span>.<br/>
🎧 The Temple</span> of the Four</span> Winds</span> is a bit more of a walk</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it's worth</span> it.<br/>
🎧 Take the path</span> from the car park<br/></span>
🎧 and go past</span> the western</span> sides</span> of the stables</span> and the house.<br/>
🎧 Then when the path</span> forks</span>, take the right-hand</span> path</span>.<br/>
🎧 Go up there with the woods</span> on your left</span> and the temple</span> is right at the end.<br/>
🎧 There are great views</span> over the whole area</span>.<br/>

🎧 I haven't seen</span> you for a bit, Marie</span>.<br/>
🎧 No. I've been busy</span> with my project</span>.<br/>
🎧 You're making</span> a vegan</span> alternative</span> to eggs</span>, aren't you?<br/>
🎧 Something that doesn't use animal</span> products</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes. I'm using</span> chickpeas</span>.<br/>
🎧 I had two main</span> aims</span> when I first started</span> looking for an alternative</span> to eggs</span>,<br/>
🎧 but actually I've found</span> chickpeas</span> have got more advantages</span>.<br/>
🎧 But how about your project</span> on reusing</span> waste</span> food?<br/>
🎧 You were looking at bread</span>, weren't you?<br/>
🎧 Yes. It's been hard</span> work, but I've enjoyed</span> it.<br/>
🎧 The basic</span> process</span> was quite straightforward</span>:<br/>
🎧 breaking</span> the stale</span> bread</span> down to a paste</span> then reforming</span> it.<br/>
🎧 But you were using</span> 3-D</span> printing</span>, weren't you, to make the paste</span> into biscuits</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I'd used that before,<br/>
🎧 but in this project</span>, I had time to play around with different patterns</span> for the biscuits<br/></span>
🎧 and finding</span> how I could add fruit</span> and vegetables</span> to make them a more appetising</span> colour</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I was really pleased</span> with what I managed</span> to produce</span>.<br/>
🎧 It must've been a great feeling to make something appetising</span> out of bits</span> of old bread</span> that would've been thrown</span> away otherwise</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was.<br/>
🎧 And I'm hoping</span> that some of the restaurants</span> in town</span> will be interested in the biscuits</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm going to send</span> them some samples</span>.<br/>
🎧 I came across something on the internet</span> yesterday</span> that might interest</span> you.<br/>
🎧 It was a company that's developed</span> touch-sensitive</span> sensors</span> for food labels</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a special sort</span> of label</span> on the food package</span>.<br/>
🎧 When the label's</span> smooth</span>, the food is fresh<br/></span>
🎧 and then when you can feel bumps</span> on the label</span>,<br/>
🎧 that means</span> the food's</span> gone</span> bad.<br/>
🎧 It started</span> off as a project</span> to help visually</span> impaired</span> people know whether</span> food was fit to eat or not.<br/>
🎧 Interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 So just solid</span> food?<br/>
🎧 No, things like milk</span> and juice</span> as well.<br/>
🎧 But actually, I thought it might be really good for drug</span> storage</span> in hospitals</span> and pharmacies</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And coming</span> back to food,<br/>
🎧 maybe it'd be possible</span> to use it for other things besides</span> freshness</span>.<br/>
🎧 Like how many kilograms</span> a joint</span> of meat</span> is, for example.<br/>
🎧 Yes, there's all sorts</span> of possibilities</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was reading</span> an article</span> about food trends<br/></span>
🎧 predicting</span> how eating</span> habits</span> might change in the next few years.<br/>
🎧 Oh..</span>. things like more focus on local</span> products</span>?<br/>
🎧 That seems</span> so obvious</span>, but the shops</span> are still full of imported</span> foods</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, they need to be more proactive</span> to address</span> that.<br/>
🎧 And somehow</span> motivate</span> consumers</span> to change, yes.<br/>
🎧 One thing everyone's</span> aware</span> of is the need for a reduction</span> in unnecessary</span> packaging<br/></span>
🎧 but just about everything you buy in supermarkets</span> is still covered</span> in plastic</span>.<br/>
🎧 The government</span> needs to do something about it.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely. It's got to change.<br/>
🎧 Do you think there'll</span> be more interest</span> in gluten-</span> and lactose-free</span> food?<br/>
🎧 For people with allergies</span> or food intolerances</span>?<br/>
🎧 I don't know.<br/>
🎧 Lots of people I know have been buying</span> that type</span> of food for years now.<br/>
🎧 Yes, even if they haven't been diagnosed</span> with an allergy</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 One thing I've noticed</span> is the number of branded</span> products</span> related</span> to celebrity</span> chefs</span>.<br/>
🎧 People watch</span> them cooking on TV<br/></span>
🎧 and then buy things like spice</span> mixes</span> or frozen</span> foods</span> with the chef's</span> name on..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I bought</span> something like that once, but I won't again.<br/>
🎧 Yeah I bought</span> a ready-made</span> spice</span> mix for chicken<br/></span>
🎧 which was supposed</span> to be used by a chef</span> I'd seen</span> on television</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it didn't actually taste</span> of anything.<br/>
🎧 Did the article</span> mention</span> 'ghost</span> kitchens'</span> used to produce</span> takeaway</span> food?<br/>
🎧 No. What are they?<br/>
🎧 Well, they might have the name of a restaurant</span>,<br/>
🎧 but actually they're a cooking facility</span> just for delivery</span> meals</span>.<br/>
🎧 The public</span> don't ever go there.<br/>
🎧 But people aren't aware</span> of that.<br/>
🎧 It's all kept</span> very quiet</span>.<br/>
🎧 So people don't realise</span> the food's</span> not actually from the restaurant</span>?<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Did you know more and more people are using</span> all sorts</span> of different mushrooms</span> now,<br/>
🎧 to treat</span> different health</span> concerns</span>?<br/>
🎧 Things like heart</span> problems</span>?<br/>
🎧 Hmm</span>. They might be taking a big risk</span> there.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's hard</span> to know which varieties</span> are safe</span> to eat.<br/>
🎧 Anyway..</span>.<br/>

🎧 For my presentation</span> today, I'm going to talk about the Ceide</span> Fields</span> in the northwest</span> of Ireland</span>,<br/>
🎧 one of the largest</span> Neolithic</span> sites</span> in the world</span>.<br/>
🎧 I recently</span> visited</span> this site<br/></span>
🎧 and observed</span> the work that is currently</span> being done by a team</span> of archaeologists</span> there.<br/>
🎧 The site</span> was first discovered</span> in the 1930s<br/></span>
🎧 by a local</span> teacher</span>, Patrick</span> Caulfield</span>.<br/>
🎧 He noticed</span> that when local</span> people were digging</span> in the bog</span>,<br/>
🎧 they were constantly</span> hitting</span> against</span> what seemed</span> to be rows</span> of stones</span>.<br/>
🎧 He realised</span> that these must be walls<br/></span>
🎧 and that they must be thousands</span> of years old for them to predate</span> the bog</span> which subsequently</span> grew</span> over them.<br/>
🎧 He wrote</span> to the National</span> Museum</span> in Dublin</span> to ask them to investigate</span>,<br/>
🎧 but no one took him seriously</span>.<br/>
🎧 It wasn't until 40</span> years later,<br/>
🎧 when Patrick</span> Caulfield's</span> son Seamus</span>, who had become an archaeologist</span> by then, began</span> to explore</span> further</span>.<br/>
🎧 He inserted</span> iron</span> probes</span> into the bog</span> to map the formation</span> of the stones</span>,<br/>
🎧 a traditional</span> method</span> which local</span> people had always used for finding</span> fuel</span> buried</span> in the bog</span> for thousands</span> of years.<br/>
🎧 Carbon</span> dating</span> later proved</span> that the site</span> was over 5,000</span> years old<br/></span>
🎧 and was the largest</span> Neolithic</span> site</span> in Ireland</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks to the bog</span> which covers</span> the area</span>,<br/>
🎧 the remains</span> of the settlement</span> at Ceide</span> Fields</span>, which is over 5,000</span> years old,<br/>
🎧 are extremely</span> well-preserved</span>.<br/>
🎧 A bog</span> is 90%</span> water;<br/></span>
🎧 its soil</span> is so saturated</span> that when the grasses</span> and heathers</span> that grow</span> on its surface</span> die</span>,<br/>
🎧 they don't fully</span> decay</span> but accumulate</span> in layers</span>.<br/>
🎧 Objects</span> remain</span> so well preserved</span> in these conditions<br/></span>
🎧 because of the acidity</span> of the peat</span> and the deficiency</span> of oxygen</span>.<br/>
🎧 At least</span> 175</span> days</span> of rain</span> a year are required</span> for this to happen;<br/></span>
🎧 this part</span> of Ireland</span> gets</span> an average</span> of 225</span> days</span>.<br/>
🎧 The Neolithic</span> farmers</span> at Ceide</span> would have enjoyed</span> several</span> centuries</span> of relative</span> peace</span> and stability</span>.<br/>
🎧 Neolithic</span> farmers</span> generally</span> lived</span> in larger</span> communities</span> than their predecessors</span>,<br/>
🎧 with a number of houses</span> built</span> around a community</span> building</span>.<br/>
🎧 As they lived</span> in permanent</span> settlements</span>,<br/>
🎧 Neolithic</span> farmers</span> were able to build</span> bigger</span> houses</span>.<br/>
🎧 These weren't round</span> as people often assume</span>,<br/>
🎧 but rectangular</span> with a small hole</span> in the roof</span> that allowed</span> smoke</span> to escape</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is one of many innovations<br/></span>
🎧 and indicates</span> that the Neolithic</span> farmers</span> were the first people to cook</span> indoors</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another new technology</span> that Neolithic</span> settlers</span> brought</span> to Ireland</span> was pottery</span>.<br/>
🎧 Fragments</span> of Neolithic</span> pots</span> have been found</span> in Ceide</span> and elsewhere</span> in Ireland</span>.<br/>
🎧 The pots</span> were used for many things;<br/></span>
🎧 as well as for storing</span> food,<br/>
🎧 pots</span> were filled</span> with a small amount of fat<br/></span>
🎧 and when this was set alight</span>, they served</span> as lamps</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's thought that the Ceide</span> Fields</span> were mainly</span> used as paddocks</span> for animals</span> to graze</span> in.<br/>
🎧 Evidence</span> from the Ceide</span> Fields</span> suggests</span> that each plot</span> of land</span> was of a suitable</span> size to sustain</span> an extended</span> family</span>.<br/>
🎧 They may have used a system</span> of rotational</span> grazing<br/></span>
🎧 in order to prevent</span> over-grazing<br/></span>
🎧 and to allow</span> for plant</span> recovery</span> and regrowth</span>.<br/>
🎧 This must've been a year-round</span> activity<br/></span>
🎧 as no structures</span> have been found</span> which would have been used to shelter</span> animals</span> in the winter</span>.<br/>
🎧 However</span>, archaeologists</span> believe</span> that this way of life at Ceide</span> ceased</span> abruptly</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why was this?<br/>
🎧 Well, several</span> factors</span> may have contributed</span> to the changing</span> circumstances</span>.<br/>
🎧 The soil</span> would have become less productive</span> and led</span> to the abandonment</span> of farming</span>.<br/>
🎧 The crop</span> rotation</span> system</span> was partly</span> responsible</span> for this<br/></span>
🎧 as it would have been very intensive</span> and was not sustainable</span>.<br/>
🎧 But there were also climatic</span> pressures</span> too.<br/>
🎧 The farmers</span> at Ceide</span> would have enjoyed</span> a relatively</span> dry period</span>,<br/>
🎧 but this began</span> to change<br/></span>
