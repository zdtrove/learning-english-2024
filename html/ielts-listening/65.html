🎧 Okay. What would you like to know?<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm new to this <span>area</span>,<br/>
🎧 so <span>perhaps</span> you could tell me something about the <span>park</span> first, please.<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 <span>Altogether</span> the <span>park</span> <span>covers</span> <span>170</span> <span>acres</span>,<br/>
🎧 that's <span>69</span> <span>hectares</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>three</span> <span>main</span> <span>types</span> of <span>habitat</span>:<br/>
🎧 <span>wetland</span>, <span>grassland</span> and <span>woodland</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>woods</span> are well <span>established</span> and <span>varied</span>,<br/>
🎧 with an <span>oak</span> <span>plantation</span>, and other <span>areas</span> of <span>mixed</span> <span>species</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 The <span>wetland</span> is quite <span>varied</span>, too.<br/>
🎧 The <span>original</span> <span>farmland</span> was <span>dug</span> up around <span>40</span> years ago to <span>extract</span> <span>gravel</span>.<br/>
🎧 Once this work was <span>completed</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>gravel</span> <span>pits</span> <span>filled</span> with water, <span>forming</span> the two large <span>lakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are also <span>several</span> <span>smaller</span> <span>ones</span>, <span>ponds</span> and a <span>stream</span> that <span>flows</span> through the <span>park</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, so I <span>suppose</span> with these different <span>habitats</span> there's quite a <span>variety</span> of <span>wildlife</span>.<br/>
🎧 There <span>certainly</span> is.<br/>
🎧 A lot of different <span>species</span> of <span>birds</span> and <span>insects</span>,<br/>
🎧 and also <span>animals</span> like <span>deer</span> and <span>rabbits</span>.<br/>
🎧 And I <span>understand</span> you <span>organise</span> <span>educational</span> <span>visits</span> for school <span>parties</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 We can <span>organise</span> a <span>wide</span> <span>range</span> of <span>activities</span> and <span>adapt</span> them to <span>suit</span> all <span>ages</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can you give me some <span>examples</span> of the <span>activities</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, one focus is on <span>science</span>,<br/>
🎧 where we help children to <span>discover</span> and <span>study</span> <span>plants</span>, <span>trees</span> and <span>insects</span>.<br/>
🎧 They also <span>collect</span> and <span>analyse</span> <span>data</span> about the things they see.<br/>
🎧 Another focus is on <span>geography</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>park</span> is a great <span>environment</span> to learn and <span>practise</span> <span>reading</span> a <span>map<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>using</span> a <span>compass</span> to <span>navigate</span> around the <span>park</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you do anything <span>connected</span> with <span>history</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, we do.<br/>
🎧 For <span>instance</span>, the children can <span>explore</span> how the use of the <span>land</span> has <span>changed</span> over time.<br/>
🎧 Then there's <span>leisure</span> and <span>tourism</span>.<br/>
🎧 That <span>focuses</span> on your <span>visitors</span>, I would <span>imagine</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, <span>mostly</span>.<br/>
🎧 The children find out about them,<br/>
🎧 their <span>requirements</span>, the <span>problems</span> they may <span>cause</span> and how we <span>manage</span> these.<br/>
🎧 And another <span>subject</span> we <span>cover</span> is music:<br/>
🎧 here the children <span>experiment</span> with <span>natural</span> <span>materials</span> to <span>create</span> <span>sounds<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>explore</span> <span>rhythm</span> and <span>tempo</span>.<br/>
🎧 That must be fun!<br/>
🎧 Most children really enjoy it.<br/>
🎧 And of course, all the <span>activities</span> are <span>educational</span>, too.<br/>
🎧 <span>Learning</span> outside the <span>classroom</span> <span>encourages</span> children to be <span>creative</span>,<br/>
🎧 and to <span>explore</span> and <span>discover</span> for <span>themselves</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would <span>imagine</span> they get a <span>sense</span> of <span>freedom</span> that might not be a <span>normal</span> <span>part</span> of their lives.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 And very often the children <span>discover</span> that they can do things they didn't know they could do,<br/>
🎧 and they <span>develop</span> new <span>skills</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>gives</span> them <span>greater</span> <span>self-confidence</span>.<br/>
🎧 It sounds great.<br/>
🎧 So, what about the <span>practical</span> side of it?<br/>
🎧 How much does it <span>cost</span> for a <span>full-day</span> visit?<br/>
🎧 We would <span>expect</span> to <span>bring</span> between <span>30</span> and <span>40</span> children.<br/>
🎧 If there are over <span>30</span>,<br/>
🎧 it <span>costs</span> <span>£4.95</span> for each <span>child</span> who <span>attends</span> on the day.<br/>
🎧 We <span>invoice</span> you <span>afterwards</span>,<br/>
🎧 so you don't pay for children who can't come because of <span>sickness</span>, for example.<br/>
🎧 There's no <span>charge</span> for <span>leaders</span> and other <span>adults</span> <span>-</span> as many as you want to <span>bring</span>.<br/>
🎧 That sounds very <span>fair</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, thanks for all the <span>information</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll need to <span>discuss</span> it with my <span>colleagues</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I hope to get back to you soon to make a <span>booking</span>.<br/>
🎧 We'll look forward to <span>hearing</span> from you.<br/>
🎧 <span>Goodbye</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Goodbye</span>, and thank you.<br/>

🎧 It's great to see so many <span>members</span> of the <span>Twinning</span> <span>Association</span> here <span>tonight</span>.<br/>
🎧 Since the <span>twinning</span> <span>link</span> between our two <span>towns</span>, <span>Stanthorpe</span> here in <span>England</span> and <span>Malatte</span> in <span>France</span>, was <span>established</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>relationship</span> between the <span>towns</span> has <span>gone</span> from <span>strength</span> to <span>strength</span>.<br/>
🎧 Last month, <span>25</span> <span>members</span> of the <span>association</span> from <span>Stanthorpe</span> <span>spent</span> a weekend in <span>Malatte</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>hosts</span> had <span>arranged</span> a great <span>programme</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>learned</span> how <span>cheese</span> is <span>produced</span> in the <span>region<br/></span>
🎧 and had the <span>chance</span> to <span>taste</span> the <span>products</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>theme</span> <span>park</span> <span>trip</span> had to be <span>cancelled</span>,<br/>
🎧 but we all had a great time on the <span>final</span> <span>boat</span> <span>trip</span> down the <span>river</span>,<br/>
🎧 that was the <span>real</span> <span>highlight</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is a special year for the <span>Association<br/></span>
🎧 because it's <span>25</span> years since we were <span>founded</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>Malatte</span>, they're planning to <span>mark</span> this by <span>building</span> a <span>footbridge</span> in the <span>municipal</span> <span>park</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've been <span>discussing</span> what to do <span>here<br/></span>
🎧 and we've <span>decided</span> to <span>plant</span> a <span>poplar</span> <span>tree</span> in the <span>museum</span> <span>gardens</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>considered</span> <span>buying</span> a garden <span>seat</span> to put there,<br/>
🎧 but the <span>authorities</span> weren't happy with that idea.<br/>
🎧 In <span>terms</span> of <span>fundraising</span> to <span>support</span> our <span>activities</span>,<br/>
🎧 we've done very well.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>pancake</span> <span>evening</span> was well <span>attended</span> and made <span>record</span> <span>profits</span>.<br/>
🎧 And everyone <span>enjoyed</span> the <span>demonstration</span> of <span>French</span> <span>cookery</span>,<br/>
🎧 which was <span>nearly</span> as <span>successful</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Numbers</span> for our <span>film</span> show were <span>limited</span> because of the <span>venue<br/></span>
🎧 so we're looking for somewhere <span>bigger</span> next year.<br/>
🎧 We're looking forward to <span>welcoming</span> our <span>French</span> <span>visitors</span> here next week,<br/>
🎧 and I know that many of you here will be <span>hosting</span> <span>individuals</span> or <span>families</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>coach</span> from <span>France</span> will <span>arrive</span> at <span>5</span> pm on <span>Friday</span>.<br/>
🎧 Don't try to do too much that first <span>evening</span> as they'll be <span>tired</span>,<br/>
🎧 so have dinner in the house or garden rather than <span>eating</span> out.<br/>
🎧 The <span>weather</span> looks as if it'll be <span>okay<br/></span>
🎧 so you might like to plan a <span>barbecue</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then the next <span>morning's</span> <span>market</span> day in <span>town</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that's always a good place to <span>stroll</span> <span>round</span>.<br/>
🎧 On <span>Saturday</span> <span>evening</span>, we'll all meet up at the <span>football</span> <span>club</span>,<br/>
🎧 where once again we'll have <span>Toby</span> <span>Sharp</span> and his <span>band<br/></span>
🎧 <span>performing</span> English and <span>Scottish</span> <span>country</span> <span>songs</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Toby</span> will already be well <span>known</span> to many of <span>you<br/></span>
🎧 as last year he <span>organised</span> our special <span>quiz</span> <span>night</span> and <span>presented</span> the <span>prizes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now on <span>Sunday</span>, we'll be taking our <span>visitors</span> to <span>Farley</span> House.<br/>
🎧 You may not all be <span>familiar</span> with it, so here's a map to help you.<br/>
🎧 You can see the car <span>park</span> at the <span>bottom</span> of the map.<br/>
🎧 There's an <span>excellent</span> <span>farm</span> <span>shop</span> in the <span>grounds</span> where our <span>visitors</span> can buy <span>local</span> <span>produce</span>,<br/>
🎧 it's in the old <span>stables</span>, which is the first <span>building</span> you come to.<br/>
🎧 They're <span>built</span> <span>round</span> a <span>courtyard</span>, and the <span>shop's</span> in the <span>far</span> <span>corner</span> on the <span>left</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's also a small <span>café</span> on the right as you go in.<br/>
🎧 I know that one or two of our <span>visitors</span> may not be all that <span>mobile</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>main</span> <span>entrance</span> to the house has a lot of <span>steps<br/></span>
🎧 so you might want to use the <span>disabled</span> <span>entry</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is on the <span>far</span> side of the house from the car <span>park</span>.<br/>
🎧 Children will probably be most interested in the <span>adventure</span> <span>playground</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's at the <span>northern</span> end of the <span>larger</span> <span>lake</span>,<br/>
🎧 in a <span>bend</span> on the <span>path</span> that <span>leads</span> to the <span>lake</span>.<br/>
🎧 There's lots for children to do there.<br/>
🎧 There are a number of <span>lovely</span> <span>gardens</span> near the house.<br/>
🎧 The <span>kitchen</span> <span>gardens</span> are <span>rectangular</span> and <span>surrounded</span> by a <span>wall</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're to the <span>north-east</span> of the house, quite near the <span>smaller</span> <span>lake</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're still in use and have a great <span>collection</span> of <span>fruit</span> and <span>vegetables</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Temple</span> of the <span>Four</span> <span>Winds</span> is a bit more of a <span>walk</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it's <span>worth</span> it.<br/>
🎧 Take the <span>path</span> from the car <span>park<br/></span>
🎧 and go <span>past</span> the <span>western</span> <span>sides</span> of the <span>stables</span> and the house.<br/>
🎧 Then when the <span>path</span> <span>forks</span>, take the <span>right-hand</span> <span>path</span>.<br/>
🎧 Go up there with the <span>woods</span> on your <span>left</span> and the <span>temple</span> is right at the end.<br/>
🎧 There are great <span>views</span> over the whole <span>area</span>.<br/>

🎧 I haven't <span>seen</span> you for a bit, <span>Marie</span>.<br/>
🎧 No. I've been <span>busy</span> with my <span>project</span>.<br/>
🎧 You're <span>making</span> a <span>vegan</span> <span>alternative</span> to <span>eggs</span>, aren't you?<br/>
🎧 Something that doesn't use <span>animal</span> <span>products</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes. I'm <span>using</span> <span>chickpeas</span>.<br/>
🎧 I had two <span>main</span> <span>aims</span> when I first <span>started</span> looking for an <span>alternative</span> to <span>eggs</span>,<br/>
🎧 but actually I've <span>found</span> <span>chickpeas</span> have got more <span>advantages</span>.<br/>
🎧 But how about your <span>project</span> on <span>reusing</span> <span>waste</span> food?<br/>
🎧 You were looking at <span>bread</span>, weren't you?<br/>
🎧 Yes. It's been <span>hard</span> work, but I've <span>enjoyed</span> it.<br/>
🎧 The <span>basic</span> <span>process</span> was quite <span>straightforward</span>:<br/>
🎧 <span>breaking</span> the <span>stale</span> <span>bread</span> down to a <span>paste</span> then <span>reforming</span> it.<br/>
🎧 But you were <span>using</span> <span>3-D</span> <span>printing</span>, weren't you, to make the <span>paste</span> into <span>biscuits</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I'd used that before,<br/>
🎧 but in this <span>project</span>, I had time to play around with different <span>patterns</span> for the <span>biscuits<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>finding</span> how I could add <span>fruit</span> and <span>vegetables</span> to make them a more <span>appetising</span> <span>colour</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I was really <span>pleased</span> with what I <span>managed</span> to <span>produce</span>.<br/>
🎧 It must've been a great feeling to make something <span>appetising</span> out of <span>bits</span> of old <span>bread</span> that would've been <span>thrown</span> away <span>otherwise</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was.<br/>
🎧 And I'm <span>hoping</span> that some of the <span>restaurants</span> in <span>town</span> will be interested in the <span>biscuits</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm going to <span>send</span> them some <span>samples</span>.<br/>
🎧 I came across something on the <span>internet</span> <span>yesterday</span> that might <span>interest</span> you.<br/>
🎧 It was a company that's <span>developed</span> <span>touch-sensitive</span> <span>sensors</span> for food <span>labels</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a special <span>sort</span> of <span>label</span> on the food <span>package</span>.<br/>
🎧 When the <span>label's</span> <span>smooth</span>, the food is <span>fresh<br/></span>
🎧 and then when you can feel <span>bumps</span> on the <span>label</span>,<br/>
🎧 that <span>means</span> the <span>food's</span> <span>gone</span> bad.<br/>
🎧 It <span>started</span> off as a <span>project</span> to help <span>visually</span> <span>impaired</span> people know <span>whether</span> food was fit to eat or not.<br/>
🎧 <span>Interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 So just <span>solid</span> food?<br/>
🎧 No, things like <span>milk</span> and <span>juice</span> as well.<br/>
🎧 But actually, I thought it might be really good for <span>drug</span> <span>storage</span> in <span>hospitals</span> and <span>pharmacies</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And <span>coming</span> back to food,<br/>
🎧 maybe it'd be <span>possible</span> to use it for other things <span>besides</span> <span>freshness</span>.<br/>
🎧 Like how many <span>kilograms</span> a <span>joint</span> of <span>meat</span> is, for example.<br/>
🎧 Yes, there's all <span>sorts</span> of <span>possibilities</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>reading</span> an <span>article</span> about food <span>trends<br/></span>
🎧 <span>predicting</span> how <span>eating</span> <span>habits</span> might change in the next few years.<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh..</span>. things like more focus on <span>local</span> <span>products</span>?<br/>
🎧 That <span>seems</span> so <span>obvious</span>, but the <span>shops</span> are still full of <span>imported</span> <span>foods</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, they need to be more <span>proactive</span> to <span>address</span> that.<br/>
🎧 And <span>somehow</span> <span>motivate</span> <span>consumers</span> to change, yes.<br/>
🎧 One thing <span>everyone's</span> <span>aware</span> of is the need for a <span>reduction</span> in <span>unnecessary</span> <span>packaging<br/></span>
🎧 but just about everything you buy in <span>supermarkets</span> is still <span>covered</span> in <span>plastic</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>government</span> needs to do something about it.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely. It's got to change.<br/>
🎧 Do you think <span>there'll</span> be more <span>interest</span> in <span>gluten-</span> and <span>lactose-free</span> food?<br/>
🎧 For people with <span>allergies</span> or food <span>intolerances</span>?<br/>
🎧 I don't know.<br/>
🎧 Lots of people I know have been <span>buying</span> that <span>type</span> of food for years now.<br/>
🎧 Yes, even if they haven't been <span>diagnosed</span> with an <span>allergy</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 One thing I've <span>noticed</span> is the number of <span>branded</span> <span>products</span> <span>related</span> to <span>celebrity</span> <span>chefs</span>.<br/>
🎧 People <span>watch</span> them cooking on <span>TV<br/></span>
🎧 and then buy things like <span>spice</span> <span>mixes</span> or <span>frozen</span> <span>foods</span> with the <span>chef's</span> name <span>on..</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>bought</span> something like that once, but I won't again.<br/>
🎧 Yeah I <span>bought</span> a <span>ready-made</span> <span>spice</span> mix for <span>chicken<br/></span>
🎧 which was <span>supposed</span> to be used by a <span>chef</span> I'd <span>seen</span> on <span>television</span>,<br/>
🎧 and it didn't actually <span>taste</span> of anything.<br/>
🎧 Did the <span>article</span> <span>mention</span> <span>'ghost</span> <span>kitchens'</span> used to <span>produce</span> <span>takeaway</span> food?<br/>
🎧 No. What are they?<br/>
🎧 Well, they might have the name of a <span>restaurant</span>,<br/>
🎧 but actually they're a cooking <span>facility</span> just for <span>delivery</span> <span>meals</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>public</span> don't ever go there.<br/>
🎧 But people aren't <span>aware</span> of that.<br/>
🎧 It's all <span>kept</span> very <span>quiet</span>.<br/>
🎧 So people don't <span>realise</span> the <span>food's</span> not actually from the <span>restaurant</span>?<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Did you know more and more people are <span>using</span> all <span>sorts</span> of different <span>mushrooms</span> now,<br/>
🎧 to <span>treat</span> different <span>health</span> <span>concerns</span>?<br/>
🎧 Things like <span>heart</span> <span>problems</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>. They might be taking a big <span>risk</span> there.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's <span>hard</span> to know which <span>varieties</span> are <span>safe</span> to eat.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway..</span>.<br/>

🎧 For my <span>presentation</span> today, I'm going to talk about the <span>Ceide</span> <span>Fields</span> in the <span>northwest</span> of <span>Ireland</span>,<br/>
🎧 one of the <span>largest</span> <span>Neolithic</span> <span>sites</span> in the <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>recently</span> <span>visited</span> this <span>site<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>observed</span> the work that is <span>currently</span> being done by a <span>team</span> of <span>archaeologists</span> there.<br/>
🎧 The <span>site</span> was first <span>discovered</span> in the <span>1930s<br/></span>
🎧 by a <span>local</span> <span>teacher</span>, <span>Patrick</span> <span>Caulfield</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>noticed</span> that when <span>local</span> people were <span>digging</span> in the <span>bog</span>,<br/>
🎧 they were <span>constantly</span> <span>hitting</span> <span>against</span> what <span>seemed</span> to be <span>rows</span> of <span>stones</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>realised</span> that these must be <span>walls<br/></span>
🎧 and that they must be <span>thousands</span> of years old for them to <span>predate</span> the <span>bog</span> which <span>subsequently</span> <span>grew</span> over them.<br/>
🎧 He <span>wrote</span> to the <span>National</span> <span>Museum</span> in <span>Dublin</span> to ask them to <span>investigate</span>,<br/>
🎧 but no one took him <span>seriously</span>.<br/>
🎧 It wasn't until <span>40</span> years later,<br/>
🎧 when <span>Patrick</span> <span>Caulfield's</span> son <span>Seamus</span>, who had become an <span>archaeologist</span> by then, <span>began</span> to <span>explore</span> <span>further</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>inserted</span> <span>iron</span> <span>probes</span> into the <span>bog</span> to map the <span>formation</span> of the <span>stones</span>,<br/>
🎧 a <span>traditional</span> <span>method</span> which <span>local</span> people had always used for <span>finding</span> <span>fuel</span> <span>buried</span> in the <span>bog</span> for <span>thousands</span> of years.<br/>
🎧 <span>Carbon</span> <span>dating</span> later <span>proved</span> that the <span>site</span> was over <span>5,000</span> years <span>old<br/></span>
🎧 and was the <span>largest</span> <span>Neolithic</span> <span>site</span> in <span>Ireland</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks to the <span>bog</span> which <span>covers</span> the <span>area</span>,<br/>
🎧 the <span>remains</span> of the <span>settlement</span> at <span>Ceide</span> <span>Fields</span>, which is over <span>5,000</span> years old,<br/>
🎧 are <span>extremely</span> <span>well-preserved</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>bog</span> is <span>90%</span> <span>water;<br/></span>
🎧 its <span>soil</span> is so <span>saturated</span> that when the <span>grasses</span> and <span>heathers</span> that <span>grow</span> on its <span>surface</span> <span>die</span>,<br/>
🎧 they don't <span>fully</span> <span>decay</span> but <span>accumulate</span> in <span>layers</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Objects</span> <span>remain</span> so well <span>preserved</span> in these <span>conditions<br/></span>
🎧 because of the <span>acidity</span> of the <span>peat</span> and the <span>deficiency</span> of <span>oxygen</span>.<br/>
🎧 At <span>least</span> <span>175</span> <span>days</span> of <span>rain</span> a year are <span>required</span> for this to <span>happen;<br/></span>
🎧 this <span>part</span> of <span>Ireland</span> <span>gets</span> an <span>average</span> of <span>225</span> <span>days</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Neolithic</span> <span>farmers</span> at <span>Ceide</span> would have <span>enjoyed</span> <span>several</span> <span>centuries</span> of <span>relative</span> <span>peace</span> and <span>stability</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Neolithic</span> <span>farmers</span> <span>generally</span> <span>lived</span> in <span>larger</span> <span>communities</span> than their <span>predecessors</span>,<br/>
🎧 with a number of <span>houses</span> <span>built</span> around a <span>community</span> <span>building</span>.<br/>
🎧 As they <span>lived</span> in <span>permanent</span> <span>settlements</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>Neolithic</span> <span>farmers</span> were able to <span>build</span> <span>bigger</span> <span>houses</span>.<br/>
🎧 These weren't <span>round</span> as people often <span>assume</span>,<br/>
🎧 but <span>rectangular</span> with a small <span>hole</span> in the <span>roof</span> that <span>allowed</span> <span>smoke</span> to <span>escape</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is one of many <span>innovations<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>indicates</span> that the <span>Neolithic</span> <span>farmers</span> were the first people to <span>cook</span> <span>indoors</span>.<br/>
🎧 Another new <span>technology</span> that <span>Neolithic</span> <span>settlers</span> <span>brought</span> to <span>Ireland</span> was <span>pottery</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Fragments</span> of <span>Neolithic</span> <span>pots</span> have been <span>found</span> in <span>Ceide</span> and <span>elsewhere</span> in <span>Ireland</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>pots</span> were used for many <span>things;<br/></span>
🎧 as well as for <span>storing</span> food,<br/>
🎧 <span>pots</span> were <span>filled</span> with a small amount of <span>fat<br/></span>
🎧 and when this was set <span>alight</span>, they <span>served</span> as <span>lamps</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's thought that the <span>Ceide</span> <span>Fields</span> were <span>mainly</span> used as <span>paddocks</span> for <span>animals</span> to <span>graze</span> in.<br/>
🎧 <span>Evidence</span> from the <span>Ceide</span> <span>Fields</span> <span>suggests</span> that each <span>plot</span> of <span>land</span> was of a <span>suitable</span> size to <span>sustain</span> an <span>extended</span> <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 They may have used a <span>system</span> of <span>rotational</span> <span>grazing<br/></span>
🎧 in order to <span>prevent</span> <span>over-grazing<br/></span>
🎧 and to <span>allow</span> for <span>plant</span> <span>recovery</span> and <span>regrowth</span>.<br/>
🎧 This must've been a <span>year-round</span> <span>activity<br/></span>
🎧 as no <span>structures</span> have been <span>found</span> which would have been used to <span>shelter</span> <span>animals</span> in the <span>winter</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, <span>archaeologists</span> <span>believe</span> that this way of life at <span>Ceide</span> <span>ceased</span> <span>abruptly</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why was this?<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>several</span> <span>factors</span> may have <span>contributed</span> to the <span>changing</span> <span>circumstances</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>soil</span> would have become less <span>productive</span> and <span>led</span> to the <span>abandonment</span> of <span>farming</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>crop</span> <span>rotation</span> <span>system</span> was <span>partly</span> <span>responsible</span> for <span>this<br/></span>
🎧 as it would have been very <span>intensive</span> and was not <span>sustainable</span>.<br/>
🎧 But there were also <span>climatic</span> <span>pressures</span> too.<br/>
🎧 The <span>farmers</span> at <span>Ceide</span> would have <span>enjoyed</span> a <span>relatively</span> dry <span>period</span>,<br/>
🎧 but this <span>began</span> to <span>change<br/></span>
🎧 and the <span>conditions</span> <span>became</span> <span>wetter</span> as there was a lot more <span>rain</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was these <span>conditions</span> that <span>encouraged</span> the <span>bog</span> to <span>form</span> over the <span>area</span> which <span>survives</span> today.<br/>
🎧 So now I'd like to show <span>you..</span>.<br/>
