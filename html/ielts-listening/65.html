🎧 Okay. What would you like to know?<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm new to this area,<br/>
🎧 so perhaps you could tell me something about the park first, please.<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 Altogether the park covers 170 acres,<br/>
🎧 that's 69 hectares.<br/>
🎧 There are three main types of habitat:<br/>
🎧 wetland, grassland and woodland.<br/>
🎧 The woods are well established and varied,<br/>
🎧 with an oak plantation, and other areas of mixed species.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 The wetland is quite varied, too.<br/>
🎧 The original farmland was dug up around 40 years ago to extract gravel.<br/>
🎧 Once this work was completed,<br/>
🎧 the gravel pits filled with water, forming the two large lakes.<br/>
🎧 There are also several smaller ones, ponds and a stream that flows through the park.<br/>
🎧 Okay, so I suppose with these different habitats there's quite a variety of wildlife.<br/>
🎧 There certainly is.<br/>
🎧 A lot of different species of birds and insects,<br/>
🎧 and also animals like deer and rabbits.<br/>
🎧 And I understand you organise educational visits for school parties.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 We can organise a wide range of activities and adapt them to suit all ages.<br/>
🎧 Can you give me some examples of the activities?<br/>
🎧 Well, one focus is on science,<br/>
🎧 where we help children to discover and study plants, trees and insects.<br/>
🎧 They also collect and analyse data about the things they see.<br/>
🎧 Another focus is on geography.<br/>
🎧 The park is a great environment to learn and practise reading a map<br/>
🎧 and using a compass to navigate around the park.<br/>
🎧 Do you do anything connected with history?<br/>
🎧 Yes, we do.<br/>
🎧 For instance, the children can explore how the use of the land has changed over time.<br/>
🎧 Then there's leisure and tourism.<br/>
🎧 That focuses on your visitors, I would imagine.<br/>
🎧 Yes, mostly.<br/>
🎧 The children find out about them,<br/>
🎧 their requirements, the problems they may cause and how we manage these.<br/>
🎧 And another subject we cover is music:<br/>
🎧 here the children experiment with natural materials to create sounds<br/>
🎧 and explore rhythm and tempo.<br/>
🎧 That must be fun!<br/>
🎧 Most children really enjoy it.<br/>
🎧 And of course, all the activities are educational, too.<br/>
🎧 Learning outside the classroom encourages children to be creative,<br/>
🎧 and to explore and discover for themselves.<br/>
🎧 I would imagine they get a sense of freedom that might not be a normal part of their lives.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 And very often the children discover that they can do things they didn't know they could do,<br/>
🎧 and they develop new skills.<br/>
🎧 This gives them greater self-confidence.<br/>
🎧 It sounds great.<br/>
🎧 So, what about the practical side of it?<br/>
🎧 How much does it cost for a full-day visit?<br/>
🎧 We would expect to bring between 30 and 40 children.<br/>
🎧 If there are over 30,<br/>
🎧 it costs £4.95 for each child who attends on the day.<br/>
🎧 We invoice you afterwards,<br/>
🎧 so you don't pay for children who can't come because of sickness, for example.<br/>
🎧 There's no charge for leaders and other adults - as many as you want to bring.<br/>
🎧 That sounds very fair.<br/>
🎧 Well, thanks for all the information.<br/>
🎧 I'll need to discuss it with my colleagues,<br/>
🎧 and I hope to get back to you soon to make a booking.<br/>
🎧 We'll look forward to hearing from you.<br/>
🎧 Goodbye.<br/>
🎧 Goodbye, and thank you.<br/>

🎧 It's great to see so many members of the Twinning Association here tonight.<br/>
🎧 Since the twinning link between our two towns, Stanthorpe here in England and Malatte in France, was established,<br/>
🎧 the relationship between the towns has gone from strength to strength.<br/>
🎧 Last month, 25 members of the association from Stanthorpe spent a weekend in Malatte.<br/>
🎧 Our hosts had arranged a great programme.<br/>
🎧 We learned how cheese is produced in the region<br/>
🎧 and had the chance to taste the products.<br/>
🎧 The theme park trip had to be cancelled,<br/>
🎧 but we all had a great time on the final boat trip down the river,<br/>
🎧 that was the real highlight.<br/>
🎧 This is a special year for the Association<br/>
🎧 because it's 25 years since we were founded.<br/>
🎧 In Malatte, they're planning to mark this by building a footbridge in the municipal park.<br/>
🎧 We've been discussing what to do here<br/>
🎧 and we've decided to plant a poplar tree in the museum gardens.<br/>
🎧 We considered buying a garden seat to put there,<br/>
🎧 but the authorities weren't happy with that idea.<br/>
🎧 In terms of fundraising to support our activities,<br/>
🎧 we've done very well.<br/>
🎧 Our pancake evening was well attended and made record profits.<br/>
🎧 And everyone enjoyed the demonstration of French cookery,<br/>
🎧 which was nearly as successful.<br/>
🎧 Numbers for our film show were limited because of the venue<br/>
🎧 so we're looking for somewhere bigger next year.<br/>
🎧 We're looking forward to welcoming our French visitors here next week,<br/>
🎧 and I know that many of you here will be hosting individuals or families.<br/>
🎧 The coach from France will arrive at 5 pm on Friday.<br/>
🎧 Don't try to do too much that first evening as they'll be tired,<br/>
🎧 so have dinner in the house or garden rather than eating out.<br/>
🎧 The weather looks as if it'll be okay<br/>
🎧 so you might like to plan a barbecue.<br/>
🎧 Then the next morning's market day in town,<br/>
🎧 and that's always a good place to stroll round.<br/>
🎧 On Saturday evening, we'll all meet up at the football club,<br/>
🎧 where once again we'll have Toby Sharp and his band<br/>
🎧 performing English and Scottish country songs.<br/>
🎧 Toby will already be well known to many of you<br/>
🎧 as last year he organised our special quiz night and presented the prizes.<br/>
🎧 Now on Sunday, we'll be taking our visitors to Farley House.<br/>
🎧 You may not all be familiar with it, so here's a map to help you.<br/>
🎧 You can see the car park at the bottom of the map.<br/>
🎧 There's an excellent farm shop in the grounds where our visitors can buy local produce,<br/>
🎧 it's in the old stables, which is the first building you come to.<br/>
🎧 They're built round a courtyard, and the shop's in the far corner on the left.<br/>
🎧 There's also a small café on the right as you go in.<br/>
🎧 I know that one or two of our visitors may not be all that mobile.<br/>
🎧 The main entrance to the house has a lot of steps<br/>
🎧 so you might want to use the disabled entry.<br/>
🎧 This is on the far side of the house from the car park.<br/>
🎧 Children will probably be most interested in the adventure playground.<br/>
🎧 That's at the northern end of the larger lake,<br/>
🎧 in a bend on the path that leads to the lake.<br/>
🎧 There's lots for children to do there.<br/>
🎧 There are a number of lovely gardens near the house.<br/>
🎧 The kitchen gardens are rectangular and surrounded by a wall.<br/>
🎧 They're to the north-east of the house, quite near the smaller lake.<br/>
🎧 They're still in use and have a great collection of fruit and vegetables.<br/>
🎧 The Temple of the Four Winds is a bit more of a walk,<br/>
🎧 but it's worth it.<br/>
🎧 Take the path from the car park<br/>
🎧 and go past the western sides of the stables and the house.<br/>
🎧 Then when the path forks, take the right-hand path.<br/>
🎧 Go up there with the woods on your left and the temple is right at the end.<br/>
🎧 There are great views over the whole area.<br/>

🎧 I haven't seen you for a bit, Marie.<br/>
🎧 No. I've been busy with my project.<br/>
🎧 You're making a vegan alternative to eggs, aren't you?<br/>
🎧 Something that doesn't use animal products?<br/>
🎧 Yes. I'm using chickpeas.<br/>
🎧 I had two main aims when I first started looking for an alternative to eggs,<br/>
🎧 but actually I've found chickpeas have got more advantages.<br/>
🎧 But how about your project on reusing waste food?<br/>
🎧 You were looking at bread, weren't you?<br/>
🎧 Yes. It's been hard work, but I've enjoyed it.<br/>
🎧 The basic process was quite straightforward:<br/>
🎧 breaking the stale bread down to a paste then reforming it.<br/>
🎧 But you were using 3-D printing, weren't you, to make the paste into biscuits?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I'd used that before,<br/>
🎧 but in this project, I had time to play around with different patterns for the biscuits<br/>
🎧 and finding how I could add fruit and vegetables to make them a more appetising colour,<br/>
🎧 and I was really pleased with what I managed to produce.<br/>
🎧 It must've been a great feeling to make something appetising out of bits of old bread that would've been thrown away otherwise.<br/>
🎧 It was.<br/>
🎧 And I'm hoping that some of the restaurants in town will be interested in the biscuits.<br/>
🎧 I'm going to send them some samples.<br/>
🎧 I came across something on the internet yesterday that might interest you.<br/>
🎧 It was a company that's developed touch-sensitive sensors for food labels.<br/>
🎧 It's a special sort of label on the food package.<br/>
🎧 When the label's smooth, the food is fresh<br/>
🎧 and then when you can feel bumps on the label,<br/>
🎧 that means the food's gone bad.<br/>
🎧 It started off as a project to help visually impaired people know whether food was fit to eat or not.<br/>
🎧 Interesting.<br/>
🎧 So just solid food?<br/>
🎧 No, things like milk and juice as well.<br/>
🎧 But actually, I thought it might be really good for drug storage in hospitals and pharmacies.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 And coming back to food,<br/>
🎧 maybe it'd be possible to use it for other things besides freshness.<br/>
🎧 Like how many kilograms a joint of meat is, for example.<br/>
🎧 Yes, there's all sorts of possibilities.<br/>
🎧 I was reading an article about food trends<br/>
🎧 predicting how eating habits might change in the next few years.<br/>
🎧 Oh... things like more focus on local products?<br/>
🎧 That seems so obvious, but the shops are still full of imported foods.<br/>
🎧 Yes, they need to be more proactive to address that.<br/>
🎧 And somehow motivate consumers to change, yes.<br/>
🎧 One thing everyone's aware of is the need for a reduction in unnecessary packaging<br/>
🎧 but just about everything you buy in supermarkets is still covered in plastic.<br/>
🎧 The government needs to do something about it.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely. It's got to change.<br/>
🎧 Do you think there'll be more interest in gluten- and lactose-free food?<br/>
🎧 For people with allergies or food intolerances?<br/>
🎧 I don't know.<br/>
🎧 Lots of people I know have been buying that type of food for years now.<br/>
🎧 Yes, even if they haven't been diagnosed with an allergy.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 One thing I've noticed is the number of branded products related to celebrity chefs.<br/>
🎧 People watch them cooking on TV<br/>
🎧 and then buy things like spice mixes or frozen foods with the chef's name on...<br/>
🎧 I bought something like that once, but I won't again.<br/>
🎧 Yeah I bought a ready-made spice mix for chicken<br/>
🎧 which was supposed to be used by a chef I'd seen on television,<br/>
🎧 and it didn't actually taste of anything.<br/>
🎧 Did the article mention 'ghost kitchens' used to produce takeaway food?<br/>
🎧 No. What are they?<br/>
🎧 Well, they might have the name of a restaurant,<br/>
🎧 but actually they're a cooking facility just for delivery meals.<br/>
🎧 The public don't ever go there.<br/>
🎧 But people aren't aware of that.<br/>
🎧 It's all kept very quiet.<br/>
🎧 So people don't realise the food's not actually from the restaurant?<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 Did you know more and more people are using all sorts of different mushrooms now,<br/>
🎧 to treat different health concerns?<br/>
🎧 Things like heart problems?<br/>
🎧 Hmm. They might be taking a big risk there.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's hard to know which varieties are safe to eat.<br/>
🎧 Anyway...<br/>

🎧 For my presentation today, I'm going to talk about the Ceide Fields in the northwest of Ireland,<br/>
🎧 one of the largest Neolithic sites in the world.<br/>
🎧 I recently visited this site<br/>
🎧 and observed the work that is currently being done by a team of archaeologists there.<br/>
🎧 The site was first discovered in the 1930s<br/>
🎧 by a local teacher, Patrick Caulfield.<br/>
🎧 He noticed that when local people were digging in the bog,<br/>
🎧 they were constantly hitting against what seemed to be rows of stones.<br/>
🎧 He realised that these must be walls<br/>
🎧 and that they must be thousands of years old for them to predate the bog which subsequently grew over them.<br/>
🎧 He wrote to the National Museum in Dublin to ask them to investigate,<br/>
🎧 but no one took him seriously.<br/>
🎧 It wasn't until 40 years later,<br/>
🎧 when Patrick Caulfield's son Seamus, who had become an archaeologist by then, began to explore further.<br/>
🎧 He inserted iron probes into the bog to map the formation of the stones,<br/>
🎧 a traditional method which local people had always used for finding fuel buried in the bog for thousands of years.<br/>
🎧 Carbon dating later proved that the site was over 5,000 years old<br/>
🎧 and was the largest Neolithic site in Ireland.<br/>
🎧 Thanks to the bog which covers the area,<br/>
🎧 the remains of the settlement at Ceide Fields, which is over 5,000 years old,<br/>
🎧 are extremely well-preserved.<br/>
🎧 A bog is 90% water;<br/>
🎧 its soil is so saturated that when the grasses and heathers that grow on its surface die,<br/>
🎧 they don't fully decay but accumulate in layers.<br/>
🎧 Objects remain so well preserved in these conditions<br/>
🎧 because of the acidity of the peat and the deficiency of oxygen.<br/>
🎧 At least 175 days of rain a year are required for this to happen;<br/>
🎧 this part of Ireland gets an average of 225 days.<br/>
🎧 The Neolithic farmers at Ceide would have enjoyed several centuries of relative peace and stability.<br/>
🎧 Neolithic farmers generally lived in larger communities than their predecessors,<br/>
🎧 with a number of houses built around a community building.<br/>
🎧 As they lived in permanent settlements,<br/>
🎧 Neolithic farmers were able to build bigger houses.<br/>
🎧 These weren't round as people often assume,<br/>
🎧 but rectangular with a small hole in the roof that allowed smoke to escape.<br/>
🎧 This is one of many innovations<br/>
🎧 and indicates that the Neolithic farmers were the first people to cook indoors.<br/>
🎧 Another new technology that Neolithic settlers brought to Ireland was pottery.<br/>
🎧 Fragments of Neolithic pots have been found in Ceide and elsewhere in Ireland.<br/>
🎧 The pots were used for many things;<br/>
🎧 as well as for storing food,<br/>
🎧 pots were filled with a small amount of fat<br/>
🎧 and when this was set alight, they served as lamps.<br/>
🎧 It's thought that the Ceide Fields were mainly used as paddocks for animals to graze in.<br/>
🎧 Evidence from the Ceide Fields suggests that each plot of land was of a suitable size to sustain an extended family.<br/>
🎧 They may have used a system of rotational grazing<br/>
🎧 in order to prevent over-grazing<br/>
🎧 and to allow for plant recovery and regrowth.<br/>
🎧 This must've been a year-round activity<br/>
🎧 as no structures have been found which would have been used to shelter animals in the winter.<br/>
🎧 However, archaeologists believe that this way of life at Ceide ceased abruptly.<br/>
🎧 Why was this?<br/>
🎧 Well, several factors may have contributed to the changing circumstances.<br/>
🎧 The soil would have become less productive and led to the abandonment of farming.<br/>
🎧 The crop rotation system was partly responsible for this<br/>
🎧 as it would have been very intensive and was not sustainable.<br/>
🎧 But there were also climatic pressures too.<br/>
🎧 The farmers at Ceide would have enjoyed a relatively dry period,<br/>
🎧 but this began to change<br/>
🎧 and the conditions became wetter as there was a lot more rain.<br/>
🎧 It was these conditions that encouraged the bog to form over the area which survives today.<br/>
🎧 So now I'd like to show you...<br/>
<br/><br/>
