<h2>In A Meeting</h2>

🎧 Alright <span>team</span>, let's go over the <span>Q3</span> <span>sales</span> <span>report</span>.<br/> 
🎧 The <span>numbers</span> look good <span>overall</span>, but there's a <span>drop</span> in the <span>Southeast</span> <span>area</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, I <span>noticed</span> that <span>too</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Any <span>ideas</span> on what might be <span>causing</span> <span>it</span>?<br/> 
🎧 We haven't <span>figured</span> out the <span>exact</span> <span>cause</span> <span>yet</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It could be a <span>seasonal</span> <span>slowdown<br/></span> 
🎧 or maybe a <span>competitor</span> <span>increase<br/></span> 
🎧 their <span>advertising</span> in the <span>area</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We should look into it <span>more</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe we could <span>reach</span> out to some of our top <span>clients</span> there to see what they're <span>noticing</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Great <span>suggestion</span>, <span>Jacob</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We can also check out any <span>recent</span> <span>advertising<br/></span> 
🎧 our <span>competitors</span> have done in the <span>Southeast</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Have we thought about <span>offering</span> any <span>local</span> <span>deals</span> to <span>boost</span> <span>sales</span> <span>there</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Interesting</span> idea, <span>Adam</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We could think of some special <span>offers</span> just for the <span>Southeast</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But we'll need to be <span>careful</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe we could try a <span>short-term</span> plan <span>focused</span> on <span>keeping</span> <span>customers</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Absolutely</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We can look into a <span>loyalty</span> <span>program</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Or <span>bonus</span> <span>points</span> for people who buy more than once in the <span>Southeast</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Agreed</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We'll put together a plan to talk with the <span>Southeast</span> <span>team<br/></span> 
🎧 and keep everyone <span>updated</span> on what we <span>find</span>.<br/> 

<h2>Brainstorming Session</h2>

🎧 Alright <span>team<br/></span> 
🎧 Let's start thinking of <span>ideas</span> for the new <span>marketing</span> <span>campaign</span>!<br/> 
🎧 We need to get a lot of <span>attention<br/></span> 
🎧 with this <span>product</span> <span>launch</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I <span>suggest</span> <span>holding</span> a <span>contest<br/></span> 
🎧 on <span>social</span> <span>media</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We could get people talking about it and <span>increase</span> <span>interest</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Interesting</span>, <span>Beth</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But how would the <span>contest</span> <span>connect</span> to the <span>product</span> <span>itself</span>?<br/> 
🎧 We don't want just <span>short-term</span> <span>excitement</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, how about a <span>contest</span> where <span>users</span> make <span>content<br/></span> 
🎧 that <span>shows</span> off the <span>product's</span> <span>benefits</span> in a <span>creative</span> way?<br/> 
🎧 That sounds <span>good</span>!<br/> 
🎧 We could also work with <span>influencers<br/></span> 
🎧 to help the <span>contest</span> <span>reach</span> more <span>people</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I like that <span>idea</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But we also need to think about a <span>traditional</span> <span>marketing</span> <span>plan</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We could focus on <span>online</span> <span>ads</span>,<br/> 
🎧 or maybe a <span>TV</span> <span>commercial</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Great <span>point</span> <span>Lucy</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We should try <span>using</span> many different <span>channels</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We could also use <span>email</span> <span>marketing<br/></span> 
🎧 to <span>reach</span> our <span>existing</span> <span>customers</span>.<br/> 
🎧 A <span>pre-launch</span> <span>campaign</span> could be a great <span>idea</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Absolutely, <span>Donald</span>.<br/> 
🎧 All these <span>ideas</span> are <span>fantastic</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Let's <span>write</span> them down and decide <span>based</span> on our <span>budget<br/></span> 
🎧 and how many people we can <span>reach</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I think we should also <span>think<br/></span> 
🎧 about the <span>timeline</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We need to start this <span>campaign</span> soon to take <span>advantage</span> of the <span>current</span> <span>trends</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Let's keep working on these <span>ideas</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Once we have a better plan, we can <span>show</span> it to the <span>client</span> for <span>approval</span>.<br/> 

<h2>Presentation</h2>

🎧 Hey <span>Tim</span>, how's the <span>presentation</span> <span>going</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Almost done, I <span>think</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Just <span>finishing</span> up the <span>slides</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Are you <span>nervous</span>?<br/> 
🎧 A little, <span>yeah</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's a big <span>proposal</span>, and I want to make a good <span>impression</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Don't <span>worry</span>, you've got <span>this</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Your <span>ideas</span> are really <span>good</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Just <span>remember</span> to keep it <span>short</span> and focus on what <span>benefits</span> they'll <span>see</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That's the best way to win them <span>over</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That's the <span>problem</span>, there's so much <span>information</span> I want to <span>include</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I get it, but too many <span>details</span> might <span>confuse</span> them.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe you could focus on the <span>main</span> <span>points<br/></span> 
🎧 and <span>offer</span> to <span>send</span> more <span>details</span> later in a <span>document</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, that's a good <span>idea</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I can also <span>practice</span> a few <span>times</span> to make sure I'm <span>clear</span> and <span>interesting</span>.<br/> 
🎧 A <span>smooth</span> <span>presentation</span> will definitely leave a good <span>impression</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Want to go over it with me this <span>afternoon</span>?<br/> 
🎧 That would be great, thanks <span>Paula</span>!<br/> 
🎧 You're a <span>lifesaver</span>.<br/> 

<h2>Team-Building activities</h2>

🎧 Hey <span>David</span>, did you hear about the <span>company</span> <span>picnic</span> next <span>month</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, I saw the <span>email</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Sounds fun, free food and <span>all</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, but I'm not a big fan of those <span>team-building</span> <span>activities</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Remember</span> the <span>trust</span> <span>fall</span> last year? So <span>awkward</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, that was a bit <span>much</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But maybe this year will be <span>different</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I <span>heard</span> they're trying something <span>new</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Really? What is <span>it</span>?<br/> 
🎧 An <span>escape</span> <span>room</span>!<br/> 
🎧 We'll work together to <span>solve</span> <span>puzzles</span> and <span>escape</span> a <span>themed</span> <span>room</span> in a set <span>time</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That <span>actually</span> sounds <span>fun</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I love <span>puzzles</span>, and a little <span>friendly</span> <span>competition</span> sounds <span>good</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Right? <span>Plus</span>, it might be a good way to get to know some <span>coworkers</span> we don't know <span>well</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe I'll <span>finally</span> get to <span>know<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Kevin</span> from <span>accounting</span>.<br/> 
🎧 He always <span>seems</span> really <span>quiet</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe the <span>escape</span> <span>room</span> will <span>show</span> his <span>puzzle</span> <span>skills</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We should <span>sign</span> up <span>together</span>!<br/> 

<h2>Coffee breaks</h2>

🎧 Man, that <span>report</span> <span>deadline</span> was <span>tough</span>.<br/> 
🎧 My <span>brain</span> <span>feels</span> like it's <span>tired</span> from <span>staring</span> at <span>spreadsheets</span> all <span>morning</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Ready</span> for a <span>coffee</span> <span>break</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Almost. I just need to <span>finish</span> this <span>email</span>.<br/> 
🎧 No <span>worries</span>, take your <span>time</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But <span>seriously</span>, you've been <span>looking</span> at that <span>screen</span> for <span>hours</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You <span>deserve</span> a <span>break</span>!<br/> 
🎧 You're <span>right</span>.<br/> 
🎧 My <span>brain</span> <span>feels</span> really <span>tired</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Where are you thinking? The <span>usual</span> <span>place</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Of <span>course</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe they <span>finally</span> <span>restock</span> <span>those<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>blueberry</span> <span>muffins</span> this <span>time</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Now you're <span>speaking</span> my <span>language</span>!<br/> 
🎧 <span>Coffee</span> and <span>muffins</span> are a <span>perfect</span> <span>match</span>.<br/> 
🎧 So, what are you working on that's got you so <span>focused</span> today?<br/> 
🎧 Is it another one of those big <span>marketing<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>campaigns</span> <span>everyone's</span> been talking <span>about</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Just a <span>presentation<br/></span> 
🎧 for the <span>marketing</span> <span>team</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We're thinking of some new <span>social</span> <span>media</span> <span>ideas</span> to get more people <span>involved</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span>, fun! Anything <span>exciting</span> you can <span>share</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Maybe if you buy me that <span>muffin</span>...<br/> 
🎧 Alright, alright, keep your <span>secrets</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But <span>seriously</span>, I'm <span>curious</span>!<br/> 
🎧 We'll <span>see</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But for now, let's get some <span>coffee</span>, and maybe I'll tell you <span>more</span>.<br/> 

<h2>Networking event</h2>

🎧 Hi there, I'm <span>Duke</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I work in <span>marketing</span> at <span>Green</span> <span>Tech</span> <span>Solutions</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Duke</span>, nice to <span>meet</span> you!<br/> 
🎧 I'm with Sun <span>City</span> <span>Solar</span>. We <span>install</span> <span>solar</span> <span>panels</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span>, <span>cool</span>! That's a <span>growing</span> <span>business</span>, isn't <span>it</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, a lot of people are <span>interested</span> in <span>clean</span> <span>energy</span>.<br/> 
🎧 At <span>GreenTech</span>, we're working on a <span>project</span> to help <span>eco-friendly</span> <span>businesses</span> in the <span>city</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Interesting</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Maybe we could find some <span>ways</span> to work <span>together</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We always look for <span>ways</span> to <span>connect</span> <span>with<br/></span> 
🎧 people who <span>care</span> about the <span>environment</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Would you like to <span>exchange</span> <span>business</span> <span>cards</span>?<br/> 
🎧 We could talk more about working <span>together</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Sure</span>!<br/> 
🎧 What kind of <span>marketing</span> are you working <span>on</span>?<br/> 
🎧 We're <span>focusing</span> on <span>social</span> <span>media</span> and <span>local</span> <span>events</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Here's my <span>card</span>. Let's <span>connect</span> on <span>LinkedIn</span> <span>too</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Sure. It was nice <span>meeting</span> you!<br/> 
🎧 You too, <span>Patrick</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe I'll see you at another <span>event</span> <span>soon</span>.<br/> 

<h2>Project planning</h2>

🎧 Hey <span>Mark</span>, do you have a <span>minute</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Sure, <span>Amelia</span>. Have a <span>seat</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What's on your <span>mind</span>?<br/> 
🎧 It's about the <span>Johnson</span> <span>project</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I <span>looked</span> at our plan <span>again</span>,<br/> 
🎧 and I think we need to change the time for the <span>design</span> <span>part</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What's the <span>problem</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Well, the <span>client</span> gave me new <span>feedback</span> <span>yesterday<br/></span> 
🎧 and it looks like the <span>design</span> <span>needs<br/></span> 
🎧 more work than I thought.<br/> 
🎧 I <span>see</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe we should give the <span>design</span> an <span>extra</span> <span>week</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Do you think that will <span>change<br/></span> 
🎧 the <span>launch</span> <span>date</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I hope <span>not</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We can move some other <span>things</span>,<br/> 
🎧 like <span>making</span> the <span>content</span> or <span>testing</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Okay, let's check the <span>whole</span> plan and see if we can change <span>anything</span>.<br/> 
🎧 For <span>sure</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'll <span>update</span> the <span>design</span> <span>schedule<br/></span> 
🎧 and <span>send</span> it to you to look at.<br/> 
🎧 Sounds good, <span>Amelia</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe we can have lunch this <span>week<br/></span> 
🎧 and talk about <span>ideas</span> for the new <span>design</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Great <span>idea</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Thanks, <span>Mark</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'm glad you're <span>helping</span> me with <span>this</span>.<br/> 
🎧 No <span>problem</span>, <span>Amelia</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We'll work it <span>out</span>!<br/> 

<h2>Photography</h2>

🎧 Hey, I've <span>noticed</span> you've been <span>posting</span> some <span>amazing</span> <span>photos</span> <span>recently</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Are you into <span>photography</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, I've been getting into it <span>lately</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's such a fun <span>hobby</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I can <span>tell</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Your <span>photos</span> are really <span>impressive</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What got you into <span>photography</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I just want to <span>capture</span> special <span>moments</span> and <span>memories</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Plus</span>, it's a fun way to be <span>creative</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span>. That's <span>cool</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What kind of <span>things<br/></span> 
🎧 do you usually take <span>pictures</span> <span>of</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I love taking <span>photos</span> of <span>landscapes</span>,<br/> 
🎧 <span>especially</span> at <span>sunset</span>.<br/> 
🎧 The <span>light</span> is just <span>beautiful</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Great <span>choice</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'm more into <span>portraits</span>,<br/> 
🎧 but I haven't <span>practiced</span> <span>much</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Portraits</span> are great <span>too</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You should try it out <span>sometime</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's all about <span>experimenting<br/></span> 
🎧 and <span>enjoying</span> the <span>process</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, I'll have to <span>dust</span> off my <span>camera</span> and give it a <span>try</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Thanks for the <span>encouragement</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Anytime</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Let me know if you ever want to go on a <span>photo</span> <span>adventure</span> <span>together</span>.<br/> 

<h2>Cooking</h2>

🎧 Hey <span>Mike</span>, what are you up to this weekend?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Nothing</span> much, probably just <span>relaxing</span> at <span>home</span>.<br/> 
🎧 How about you?<br/> 
🎧 Me too, <span>actually</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'm thinking of trying a new <span>recipe</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Have you been cooking anything fun <span>lately</span>?<br/> 
🎧 You know me and <span>fancy</span> <span>recipes</span>, <span>haha</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But I did try these <span>veggie</span> <span>burgers</span> the other <span>day</span>.<br/> 
🎧 They were <span>pretty</span> <span>good</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Veggie</span> <span>burgers</span>, <span>huh</span>? Sounds <span>healthy</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'm in the <span>mood</span> for something a bit <span>greasier</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe some <span>macaroni</span> and <span>cheese</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Not a bad <span>idea</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Last <span>night</span>, I made a <span>delicious</span> <span>pasta</span> <span>dish</span> with <span>homemade</span> <span>sauce</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That sounds <span>amazing</span>!<br/> 
🎧 What's your <span>secret<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>ingredient</span> for the <span>sauce</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I <span>added</span> a bit of red <span>wine<br/></span> 
🎧 for <span>extra</span> <span>flavor</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It <span>turned</span> out really <span>rich</span> and <span>tasty</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Nice touch!<br/> 
🎧 I've been <span>wanting</span> to try more new things with cooking <span>too</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Do you have any <span>favorite</span> cooking <span>blogs<br/></span> 
🎧 or <span>YouTube</span> <span>channels</span> that you <span>watch</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I often <span>watch</span> <span>Tasty</span> <span>videos</span> on <span>YouTube</span> for <span>quick</span> and easy <span>recipes</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Thanks, I'll check it <span>out</span>.<br/> 

<h2>Painting</h2>

🎧 Wow, these <span>colors</span> are <span>amazing</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What are you <span>looking</span> at?<br/> 
🎧 This <span>artist</span> on <span>Instagram</span>, their <span>paintings</span> are so <span>bright</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It makes me want to get out my old <span>watercolors</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Really? You used to <span>paint</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, back in high <span>school</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I haven't used them in <span>ages</span>, <span>though</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Life just got too <span>busy</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I get that.<br/> 
🎧 You should definitely try <span>again</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe even try something <span>new</span>,<br/> 
🎧 like <span>acrylics</span> or <span>something</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That's a good <span>idea</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe I'll look for a <span>local</span> <span>art</span> class for <span>beginners</span>.<br/> 
🎧 There is a great <span>community<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>art</span> <span>center</span> <span>downtown</span>.<br/> 
🎧 They <span>offer</span> all <span>kinds</span> of <span>classes</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We could even check it out together <span>sometime</span>!<br/> 
🎧 You'd come with <span>me</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Of <span>course</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We could make a day of it and <span>explore</span> the <span>art</span> <span>supply</span> <span>store</span> <span>too</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That sounds like so much <span>fun</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Let me know when you're <span>free</span>.<br/> 

<h2>Hiking</h2>

🎧 Is it always this <span>cold</span> in the morning <span>here</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Only in the <span>spring</span> and <span>fall</span>!<br/> 
🎧 It <span>gets</span> nice and hot in the <span>summer</span> <span>though</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Perfect</span> for <span>hiking</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Do you like <span>hiking</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Of <span>course</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I try to go at <span>least</span> once a <span>month</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's a great way to <span>clear</span> my <span>head</span> and get some <span>exercise</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'm the <span>opposite</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I haven't been <span>hiking</span> in <span>ages</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'm not sure if my <span>knees</span> can <span>handle</span> it when I go <span>again</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Don't <span>worry</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You'll get <span>beautiful</span> <span>views<br/></span> 
🎧 without the really <span>steep</span> <span>climbs</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Really</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I might have to check that <span>out</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What do you usually take with you?<br/> 
🎧 Just the <span>basics:</span> <span>backpack</span>, water, <span>snacks</span>, and a good <span>pair</span> of <span>shoes</span>.<br/> 
🎧 And sometimes a <span>camera<br/></span> 
🎧 to take <span>pictures</span> of the <span>scenery</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Sounds simple <span>enough</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe we could plan a <span>hike</span> together <span>sometime</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I'd be up for that!<br/> 

<h2>Knitting</h2>

🎧 This is for your <span>birthday</span>, <span>Anna</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Thank you so <span>much</span>!<br/> 
🎧 This <span>must</span> have taken you a lot of time, <span>huh</span>?<br/> 
🎧 You're right, but it was <span>worth</span> <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Did <span>someone</span> <span>teach</span> you to <span>knit</span>,<br/> 
🎧 or did you learn by <span>yourself</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I <span>learned</span> it by myself, <span>actually</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I just <span>started</span> two <span>weeks</span> <span>ago</span>.<br/> 
🎧 The <span>pattern</span> is really <span>impressive</span> for a <span>beginner</span>!<br/> 
🎧 <span>Thanks</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I wish I could <span>knit</span> like <span>this</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span>, <span>trust</span> me, it takes <span>practice</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But it's really <span>relaxing</span> once you get the <span>hang</span> of <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You should try <span>it</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Maybe I <span>should</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It <span>seems</span> like a good way to <span>relax</span> after <span>work</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Do you think it's <span>hard</span> to <span>learn</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Not at <span>all</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I can <span>teach</span> you the <span>basic</span> <span>stitches</span> if you <span>want</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We could even have a little <span>knitting</span> <span>night</span> <span>sometime</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That would be <span>amazing</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I'd love to learn from you.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe we could <span>pick</span> out some <span>yarn</span> together <span>too</span>?<br/> 
🎧 We can make a <span>whole</span> day of <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Knitting</span>, <span>yarn</span> <span>shopping</span>, maybe some <span>coffee</span>...<br/> 
🎧 Sounds like my kind of <span>day</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Let me know when you're <span>free</span>.<br/> 

<h2>Playing musical instruments</h2>

🎧 How's the <span>guitar</span> <span>practice</span> <span>going</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Not bad.<br/> 
🎧 I'm <span>finally</span> getting the <span>hang</span> of that <span>fingerpicking</span> <span>pattern</span> you <span>showed</span> <span>me</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Good <span>job</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That one can be <span>tricky</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You have to keep your <span>fingers</span> <span>moving</span> <span>separately</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, it takes some <span>practice</span> for <span>sure</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But it sounds so <span>cool</span> once you get it <span>right</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Definitely</span>.<br/> 
🎧 By the way, did you see the <span>flyer</span> for the open <span>mic</span> <span>night</span> at our <span>favorite</span> <span>coffee</span> <span>shop</span> next <span>week</span>?<br/> 
🎧 No, I <span>must</span> have <span>missed</span> <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That sounds <span>interesting</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, they have it every other <span>Wednesday</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Local</span> <span>musicians</span> can play a <span>song</span> or two. It's <span>pretty</span> <span>relaxed</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, that could be <span>fun</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe I could try playing something simple.<br/> 
🎧 You <span>should</span>!<br/> 
🎧 It's a good way to get over <span>stage</span> <span>fright</span> and get <span>feedback</span> from other <span>musicians</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Yeah. You're <span>right</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe I'll work on a <span>short</span> <span>piece</span> and give it a <span>try</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Cool</span>! Let me know if you <span>do</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'd love to come and <span>cheer</span> you <span>on</span>.<br/> 

<h2>Blogging</h2>

🎧 Hey <span>Nancy</span>, how's it <span>going</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Hey <span>David</span>, I'm <span>good</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Just <span>catching</span> up on some <span>emails</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What about you?<br/> 
🎧 Same <span>here</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Actually</span>, I was <span>checking</span> out your <span>social</span> <span>media</span> <span>earlier</span> and saw you <span>mentioned</span> a <span>blog</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span> <span>yeah</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I <span>recently</span> <span>started</span> one about <span>baking</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I love trying new <span>recipes</span> and thought it'd be fun to share them.<br/> 
🎧 That's <span>awesome</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I've been thinking about <span>starting</span> a <span>blog</span> <span>myself<br/></span> 
🎧 but on something <span>completely</span> <span>different</span>.<br/> 
🎧 More on the <span>tech</span> side of <span>things</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You're a <span>software</span> <span>developer</span>, <span>right</span>?<br/> 
🎧 So your <span>blog</span> <span>must</span> be about <span>coding</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That's <span>right</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I love <span>sharing</span> <span>tips</span> and <span>tricks</span> for <span>beginners</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That sounds <span>interesting</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I might need to check that <span>out</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Definitely</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Maybe we can <span>swap</span> some <span>blog</span> <span>promotion</span> <span>tips</span> <span>sometime</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We could even do a <span>guest</span> <span>post</span> on <span>each<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>other's</span> <span>blogs</span> to help <span>promote</span> them.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span> no, that's a great <span>idea</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Let's <span>chat</span> more about it later.<br/> 
🎧 I have a <span>presentation</span> <span>soon</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Good <span>luck</span> with your <span>presentation</span>.<br/> 

<h2>In a study group</h2>

🎧 Okay everyone, let's start on this <span>biology</span> <span>chapter</span>.<br/> 
🎧 The <span>exam</span> is next week, <span>remember</span>?<br/> 
🎧 There's so much to <span>study</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Don't <span>worry</span>.<br/> 
🎧 If we work together, it won't feel so <span>hard</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Exactly. <span>Liam</span>, you did great on the last <span>bio</span> <span>exam</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Any <span>tips</span> for <span>studying</span> the <span>cell</span> <span>cycle</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Sure! The most <span>important</span> thing is to <span>understand</span> the different <span>phases</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Flashcards</span> can really <span>help<br/></span> 
🎧 with <span>learning</span> the <span>order</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Good idea. Maybe we can make some <span>flashcards</span> together for the key <span>words</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I'm in! <span>Flashcards</span> are better than just <span>reading</span> the <span>textbook</span> again and <span>again</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Liam</span>, did you say something about <span>practice</span> <span>problems</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, there are some good <span>practice</span> <span>problems</span> at the end of each <span>chapter</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Doing those will help us use what <span>we've</span> <span>learned</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I think we can <span>split</span> up the <span>problems</span> and <span>quiz</span> each other on them.<br/> 
🎧 This is <span>starting</span> to feel a little less <span>scary</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Thanks for <span>setting</span> up this <span>study</span> <span>group</span>, <span>Chris</span>!<br/> 

<h2>In a club meeting</h2>

🎧 Alright everyone, thanks for <span>coming</span> to <span>tonight's</span> <span>Green</span> <span>Club</span> <span>meeting</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Hey <span>Isabella</span>, glad I could make <span>it</span>!<br/> 
🎧 What are we talking about <span>tonight</span>?<br/> 
🎧 We have a lot to talk <span>about</span>.<br/> 
🎧 First, I <span>wanted</span> to hear <span>everyone's</span> <span>ideas<br/></span> 
🎧 for the <span>Earth</span> Day <span>event</span> on <span>campus</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I think we could set up a <span>booth</span> with <span>information</span> about how to live in an <span>eco-friendly</span> way.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe we can have some fun <span>games</span> or <span>activities</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Great idea, <span>Sarah</span>! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We could also give away <span>reusable</span> <span>shopping</span> <span>bags</span> or <span>seed</span> <span>packets</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Those are both good <span>ideas</span>!<br/> 
🎧 We could work with the <span>Environmental<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Science</span> <span>Club</span> to <span>reach</span> more <span>people</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Love that idea, <span>Noah</span>!<br/> 
🎧 We can talk to them later.<br/> 
🎧 Now, let's think of more <span>Earth</span> Day <span>event</span> <span>ideas</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We could have a <span>clothing</span> <span>swap<br/></span> 
🎧 to <span>promote</span> <span>sustainable</span> <span>fashion</span>.<br/> 
🎧 People could <span>bring</span> <span>clothes</span> they don't want and <span>trade</span> them with <span>others</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I had the same idea as <span>Daniel</span>!<br/> 

<h2>Sport Practice</h2>

🎧 <span>Oh</span> my, that <span>practice</span> was <span>tough</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Tell me about <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Coach</span> <span>Miller</span> really <span>pushed</span> us today.<br/> 
🎧 Did you see him <span>running</span> with us during the <span>drills</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, no <span>kidding</span>! He has more <span>energy</span> than all of us <span>together</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It makes you want to work <span>harder</span> when you see your <span>coach</span> trying so <span>much</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Totally</span>. He really makes us want to do our <span>best</span>.<br/> 
🎧 So how's your <span>ankle</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I saw you <span>fall</span> <span>hard</span> during the <span>practice</span> <span>game</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's a little <span>sore</span>, but I think I'll be okay.<br/> 
🎧 I'll put ice on it <span>tonight</span> and see how it <span>feels</span> in the <span>morning</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Good</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We can't have any <span>injuries<br/></span> 
🎧 before the big game next <span>week</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I know <span>right</span>?<br/> 
🎧 We need everyone to be at their best to <span>beat</span> the <span>Wildcats</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Speaking</span> of the game, are you <span>coming<br/></span> 
🎧 to the <span>pre-game</span> <span>pep</span> <span>rally</span> on <span>Friday</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Absolutely</span>!<br/> 
🎧 We need to get <span>excited</span> for the <span>win</span>!<br/> 

<h2>Research Project</h2>

🎧 This <span>research</span> <span>paper<br/></span> is <span>giving</span> me a <span>headache</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I feel like I'm not getting <span>anywhere</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Me <span>too</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I've been <span>looking</span> at the same <span>paragraph</span> for about <span>20</span> <span>minutes</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe we're not on the right <span>path</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Have you <span>found</span> any good <span>sources</span> <span>recently</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Not <span>really</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Most of the <span>articles</span> I <span>found</span> are too <span>technical<br/></span> 
🎧 and don't talk about the <span>social</span> <span>impacts</span> we <span>wanted</span> to focus <span>on</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Ugh</span>, that's <span>frustrating</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Wait, <span>Professor</span> <span>Lee</span> <span>mentioned</span> a <span>documentary</span> that might <span>help</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Did you check the <span>library</span> <span>database</span> for <span>it</span>?<br/> 
🎧 No, I <span>completely</span> <span>forgot</span>!<br/> 
🎧 That's a good <span>idea</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe it will give us some new <span>ideas</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Hopefully</span>.<br/> 
🎧 In the <span>meantime</span>, I'll <span>search</span> some <span>social</span> <span>science</span> <span>journals</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We just need to find the right <span>keywords</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe we can think of some <span>together</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Definitely! Two <span>heads</span> are better than <span>one</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Let's <span>grab</span> some <span>coffee</span> <span>first</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe a little <span>caffeine</span> will help us <span>figure</span> this <span>out</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I <span>totally</span> <span>agree</span>.<br/> 
🎧 If <span>nothing</span> <span>works</span>, we can always <span>meet</span> with <span>Professor</span> <span>Lee</span> for some <span>help</span>.<br/>

<h2>Cultural Event</h2>

🎧 Hey May, have you <span>seen</span> <span>this</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span> wow, a <span>Vietnamese</span> <span>Culture</span> <span>Festival</span> on <span>campus</span> next week! That's <span>cool</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Right? I didn't know they were doing something like <span>this</span>.<br/> 
🎧 This makes me feel <span>homesick</span> <span>already</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We should definitely <span>go</span>!<br/> 
🎧 It would be a fun <span>way<br/></span> 
🎧 to <span>celebrate</span> our <span>culture<br/></span> 
🎧 and share <span>Vietnamese</span> <span>traditions<br/></span> 
🎧 with <span>others</span>.<br/> 
🎧 The <span>poster</span> <span>says</span> there will be <span>traditional</span> food <span>vendors</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I <span>miss</span> <span>banh</span> <span>mi</span> and <span>rice</span> <span>noodles</span> <span>already</span>.<br/> 
🎧 My <span>mouth</span> is <span>watering</span> just thinking about them.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe they'll even have <span>sweet</span> <span>soup</span> for <span>dessert</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Will there be any <span>performances</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, there will be <span>Vietnamese<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>folk</span> music <span>performances</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What about <span>Vietnamese</span> <span>coffee</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I hope <span>so</span>!<br/> 
🎧 <span>Nothing</span> <span>beats</span> a <span>strong</span> cup of <span>iced</span> <span>milk<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>coffee</span> to <span>finish</span> the <span>experience</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We should <span>bring</span> some of our <span>friends<br/></span> 
🎧 who don't know about <span>Vietnamese</span> <span>culture</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It would be a great <span>way<br/></span>
