<h2>In A Meeting</h2>

🎧 Alright <span>team</span>, let's go over the <span>Q3</span> <span>sales</span> <span>report.<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>numbers</span> look good <span>overall</span>, but there's a <span>drop</span> in the <span>Southeast</span> <span>area.<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, I <span>noticed</span> that <span>too.<br/></span> 
🎧 Any <span>ideas</span> on what might be <span>causing</span> <span>it?<br/></span> 
🎧 We haven't <span>figured</span> out the <span>exact</span> <span>cause</span> <span>yet.<br/></span> 
🎧 It could be a <span>seasonal</span> <span>slowdown<br/></span> 
🎧 or maybe a <span>competitor</span> <span>increase<br/></span> 
🎧 their <span>advertising</span> in the <span>area.<br/></span> 
🎧 We should look into it <span>more.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe we could <span>reach</span> out to some of our top <span>clients</span> there to see what they're <span>noticing.<br/></span> 
🎧 Great <span>suggestion</span>, <span>Jacob.<br/></span> 
🎧 We can also check out any <span>recent</span> <span>advertising<br/></span> 
🎧 our <span>competitors</span> have done in the <span>Southeast.<br/></span> 
🎧 Have we thought about <span>offering</span> any <span>local</span> <span>deals</span> to <span>boost</span> <span>sales</span> <span>there?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Interesting</span> idea, <span>Adam.<br/></span> 
🎧 We could think of some special <span>offers</span> just for the <span>Southeast.<br/></span> 
🎧 But we'll need to be <span>careful.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe we could try a <span>short-term</span> plan <span>focused</span> on <span>keeping</span> <span>customers.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Absolutely.<br/></span> 
🎧 We can look into a <span>loyalty</span> <span>program.<br/></span> 
🎧 Or <span>bonus</span> <span>points</span> for people who buy more than once in the <span>Southeast.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Agreed.<br/></span> 
🎧 We'll put together a plan to talk with the <span>Southeast</span> <span>team<br/></span> 
🎧 and keep everyone <span>updated</span> on what we <span>find.<br/></span> 
🎧 Alright <span>team<br/></span> 
🎧 Let's start thinking of <span>ideas</span> for the new <span>marketing</span> <span>campaign!<br/></span> 
🎧 We need to get a lot of <span>attention<br/></span> 
🎧 with this <span>product</span> <span>launch.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>suggest</span> <span>holding</span> a <span>contest<br/></span> 
🎧 on <span>social</span> <span>media.<br/></span> 
🎧 We could get people talking about it and <span>increase</span> <span>interest.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Interesting</span>, <span>Beth.<br/></span> 
🎧 But how would the <span>contest</span> <span>connect</span> to the <span>product</span> <span>itself?<br/></span> 
🎧 We don't want just <span>short-term</span> <span>excitement.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, how about a <span>contest</span> where <span>users</span> make <span>content<br/></span> 
🎧 that <span>shows</span> off the <span>product's</span> <span>benefits</span> in a <span>creative</span> <span>way?<br/></span> 
🎧 That sounds <span>good!<br/></span> 
🎧 We could also work with <span>influencers<br/></span> 
🎧 to help the <span>contest</span> <span>reach</span> more <span>people.<br/></span> 
🎧 I like that <span>idea.<br/></span> 
🎧 But we also need to think about a <span>traditional</span> <span>marketing</span> <span>plan.<br/></span> 
🎧 We could <span>focus</span> on <span>online</span> <span>ads,<br/></span> 
🎧 or maybe a <span>TV</span> <span>commercial.<br/></span> 
🎧 Great <span>point</span> <span>Lucy.<br/></span> 
🎧 We should try <span>using</span> many different <span>channels.<br/></span> 
🎧 We could also use <span>email</span> <span>marketing<br/></span> 
🎧 to <span>reach</span> our <span>existing</span> <span>customers.<br/></span> 
🎧 A <span>pre-launch</span> <span>campaign</span> could be a great <span>idea.<br/></span> 
🎧 Absolutely, <span>Donald.<br/></span> 
🎧 All these <span>ideas</span> are <span>fantastic!<br/></span> 
🎧 Let's <span>write</span> them down and decide <span>based</span> on our <span>budget<br/></span> 
🎧 and how many people we can <span>reach.<br/></span> 
🎧 I think we should also <span>think<br/></span> 
🎧 about the <span>timeline.<br/></span> 
🎧 We need to start this <span>campaign</span> soon to take <span>advantage</span> of the <span>current</span> <span>trends.<br/></span> 
🎧 Let's keep working on these <span>ideas.<br/></span> 
🎧 Once we have a better plan, we can <span>show</span> it to the <span>client</span> for <span>approval.<br/></span> 
🎧 Hey <span>Tim</span>, how's the <span>presentation</span> <span>going?<br/></span> 
🎧 Almost done, I <span>think.<br/></span> 
🎧 Just <span>finishing</span> up the <span>slides.<br/></span> 
🎧 Are you <span>nervous?<br/></span> 
🎧 A little, <span>yeah.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's a big <span>proposal</span>, and I want to make a good <span>impression.<br/></span> 
🎧 Don't <span>worry</span>, you've got <span>this!<br/></span> 
🎧 Your <span>ideas</span> are really <span>good.<br/></span> 
🎧 Just <span>remember</span> to keep it <span>short</span> and <span>focus</span> on what <span>benefits</span> they'll <span>see.<br/></span> 
🎧 That's the best way to win them <span>over.<br/></span> 
🎧 That's the <span>problem</span>, there's so much <span>information</span> I want to <span>include!<br/></span> 
🎧 I get it, but too many <span>details</span> might <span>confuse</span> <span>them.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe you could <span>focus</span> on the <span>main</span> <span>points<br/></span> 
🎧 and <span>offer</span> to <span>send</span> more <span>details</span> later in a <span>document.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, that's a good <span>idea.<br/></span> 
🎧 I can also <span>practice</span> a few <span>times</span> to make sure I'm <span>clear</span> and <span>interesting.<br/></span> 
🎧 A <span>smooth</span> <span>presentation</span> will definitely <span>leave</span> a good <span>impression.<br/></span> 
🎧 Want to go over it with me this <span>afternoon?<br/></span> 
🎧 That would be great, thanks <span>Paula!<br/></span> 
🎧 You're a <span>lifesaver.<br/></span> 
🎧 Hey <span>David</span>, did you hear about the <span>company</span> <span>picnic</span> next <span>month?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, I saw the <span>email.<br/></span> 
🎧 Sounds fun, free food and <span>all.<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, but I'm not a big fan of those <span>team-building</span> <span>activities.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Remember</span> the <span>trust</span> <span>fall</span> last year? So <span>awkward!<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, that was a bit <span>much.<br/></span> 
🎧 But maybe this year will be <span>different?<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>heard</span> they're trying something <span>new.<br/></span> 
🎧 Really? What is <span>it?<br/></span> 
🎧 An <span>escape</span> <span>room!<br/></span> 
🎧 We'll work together to <span>solve</span> <span>puzzles</span> and <span>escape</span> a <span>themed</span> <span>room</span> in a set <span>time.<br/></span> 
🎧 That <span>actually</span> sounds <span>fun.<br/></span> 
🎧 I love <span>puzzles</span>, and a little <span>friendly</span> <span>competition</span> sounds <span>good.<br/></span> 
🎧 Right? <span>Plus</span>, it might be a good way to get to know some <span>coworkers</span> we don't know <span>well.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe I'll <span>finally</span> get to <span>know<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Kevin</span> from <span>accounting.<br/></span> 
🎧 He always <span>seems</span> really <span>quiet.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe the <span>escape</span> <span>room</span> will <span>show</span> his <span>puzzle</span> <span>skills.<br/></span> 
🎧 We should <span>sign</span> up <span>together!<br/></span> 
🎧 Man, that <span>report</span> <span>deadline</span> was <span>tough.<br/></span> 
🎧 My <span>brain</span> <span>feels</span> like it's <span>tired</span> from <span>staring</span> at <span>spreadsheets</span> all <span>morning.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Ready</span> for a <span>coffee</span> <span>break?<br/></span> 
🎧 Almost. I just need to <span>finish</span> this <span>email.<br/></span> 
🎧 No <span>worries</span>, take your <span>time.<br/></span> 
🎧 But <span>seriously</span>, you've been <span>looking</span> at that <span>screen</span> for <span>hours.<br/></span> 
🎧 You <span>deserve</span> a <span>break!<br/></span> 
🎧 You're <span>right.<br/></span> 
🎧 My <span>brain</span> <span>feels</span> really <span>tired.<br/></span> 
🎧 Where are you thinking? The <span>usual</span> <span>place?<br/></span> 
🎧 Of <span>course.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe they <span>finally</span> <span>restock</span> <span>those<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>blueberry</span> <span>muffins</span> this <span>time.<br/></span> 
🎧 Now you're <span>speaking</span> my <span>language!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Coffee</span> and <span>muffins</span> are a <span>perfect</span> <span>match.<br/></span> 
🎧 So, what are you working on that's got you so <span>focused</span> <span>today?<br/></span> 
🎧 Is it another one of those big <span>marketing<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>campaigns</span> <span>everyone's</span> been talking <span>about?<br/></span> 
🎧 Just a <span>presentation<br/></span> 
🎧 for the <span>marketing</span> <span>team.<br/></span> 
🎧 We're thinking of some new <span>social</span> <span>media</span> <span>ideas</span> to get more people <span>involved.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span>, fun! Anything <span>exciting</span> you can <span>share?<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe if you buy me that <span>muffin...<br/></span> 
🎧 Alright, alright, keep your <span>secrets.<br/></span> 
🎧 But <span>seriously</span>, I'm <span>curious!<br/></span> 
🎧 We'll <span>see.<br/></span> 
🎧 But for now, let's get some <span>coffee</span>, and maybe I'll tell you <span>more.<br/></span> 
🎧 Hi there, I'm <span>Duke!<br/></span> 
🎧 I work in <span>marketing</span> at <span>Green</span> <span>Tech</span> <span>Solutions.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Duke</span>, nice to <span>meet</span> <span>you!<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm with Sun <span>City</span> <span>Solar</span>. We <span>install</span> <span>solar</span> <span>panels.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span>, <span>cool</span>! That's a <span>growing</span> <span>business</span>, isn't <span>it?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, a lot of people are <span>interested</span> in <span>clean</span> <span>energy.<br/></span> 
🎧 At <span>GreenTech</span>, we're working on a <span>project</span> to help <span>eco-friendly</span> <span>businesses</span> in the <span>city.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Interesting!<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe we could find some <span>ways</span> to work <span>together.<br/></span> 
🎧 We always look for <span>ways</span> to <span>connect</span> <span>with<br/></span> 
🎧 people who <span>care</span> about the <span>environment.<br/></span> 
🎧 Would you like to <span>exchange</span> <span>business</span> <span>cards?<br/></span> 
🎧 We could talk more about working <span>together.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Sure!<br/></span> 
🎧 What kind of <span>marketing</span> are you working <span>on?<br/></span> 
🎧 We're <span>focusing</span> on <span>social</span> <span>media</span> and <span>local</span> <span>events.<br/></span> 
🎧 Here's my <span>card</span>. Let's <span>connect</span> on <span>LinkedIn</span> <span>too.<br/></span> 
🎧 Sure. It was nice <span>meeting</span> <span>you!<br/></span> 
🎧 You too, <span>Patrick.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe I'll see you at another <span>event</span> <span>soon.<br/></span> 
🎧 Hey <span>Mark</span>, do you have a <span>minute?<br/></span> 
🎧 Sure, <span>Amelia</span>. Have a <span>seat.<br/></span> 
🎧 What's on your <span>mind?<br/></span> 
🎧 It's about the <span>Johnson</span> <span>project.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>looked</span> at our plan <span>again,<br/></span> 
🎧 and I think we need to change the time for the <span>design</span> <span>part.<br/></span> 
🎧 What's the <span>problem?<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, the <span>client</span> gave me new <span>feedback</span> <span>yesterday<br/></span> 
🎧 and it looks like the <span>design</span> <span>needs<br/></span> 
🎧 more work than I <span>thought.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>see.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe we should give the <span>design</span> an <span>extra</span> <span>week.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you think that will <span>change<br/></span> 
🎧 the <span>launch</span> <span>date?<br/></span> 
🎧 I hope <span>not.<br/></span> 
🎧 We can move some other <span>things,<br/></span> 
🎧 like <span>making</span> the <span>content</span> or <span>testing.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Okay</span>, let's check the <span>whole</span> plan and see if we can change <span>anything.<br/></span> 
🎧 For <span>sure.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll <span>update</span> the <span>design</span> <span>schedule<br/></span> 
🎧 and <span>send</span> it to you to look <span>at.<br/></span> 
🎧 Sounds good, <span>Amelia.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe we can have lunch this <span>week<br/></span> 
🎧 and talk about <span>ideas</span> for the new <span>design.<br/></span> 
🎧 Great <span>idea!<br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks, <span>Mark.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm glad you're <span>helping</span> me with <span>this.<br/></span> 
🎧 No <span>problem</span>, <span>Amelia.<br/></span> 
🎧 We'll work it <span>out!<br/></span> 
🎧 Hey, I've <span>noticed</span> you've been <span>posting</span> some <span>amazing</span> <span>photos</span> <span>recently.<br/></span> 
🎧 Are you into <span>photography?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, I've been getting into it <span>lately.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's such a fun <span>hobby.<br/></span> 
🎧 I can <span>tell!<br/></span> 
🎧 Your <span>photos</span> are really <span>impressive.<br/></span> 
🎧 What got you into <span>photography?<br/></span> 
🎧 I just want to <span>capture</span> special <span>moments</span> and <span>memories.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Plus</span>, it's a fun way to be <span>creative.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span>. That's <span>cool.<br/></span> 
🎧 What kind of <span>things<br/></span> 
🎧 do you usually take <span>pictures</span> <span>of?<br/></span> 
🎧 I love taking <span>photos</span> of <span>landscapes,<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>especially</span> at <span>sunset.<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>light</span> is just <span>beautiful.<br/></span> 
🎧 Great <span>choice.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm more into <span>portraits,<br/></span> 
🎧 but I haven't <span>practiced</span> <span>much.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Portraits</span> are great <span>too.<br/></span> 
🎧 You should try it out <span>sometime.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's all about <span>experimenting<br/></span> 
🎧 and <span>enjoying</span> the <span>process.<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, I'll have to <span>dust</span> off my <span>camera</span> and give it a <span>try.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks for the <span>encouragement.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Anytime!<br/></span> 
🎧 Let me know if you ever want to go on a <span>photo</span> <span>adventure</span> <span>together.<br/></span> 
🎧 Hey <span>Mike</span>, what are you up to this <span>weekend?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Nothing</span> much, probably just <span>relaxing</span> at <span>home.<br/></span> 
🎧 How about <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 Me too, <span>actually.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm thinking of trying a new <span>recipe.<br/></span> 
🎧 Have you been cooking anything fun <span>lately?<br/></span> 
🎧 You know me and <span>fancy</span> <span>recipes</span>, <span>haha.<br/></span> 
🎧 But I did try these <span>veggie</span> <span>burgers</span> the other <span>day.<br/></span> 
🎧 They were <span>pretty</span> <span>good.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Veggie</span> <span>burgers</span>, <span>huh</span>? Sounds <span>healthy.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm in the <span>mood</span> for something a bit <span>greasier.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe some <span>macaroni</span> and <span>cheese?<br/></span> 
🎧 Not a bad <span>idea.<br/></span> 
🎧 Last <span>night</span>, I made a <span>delicious</span> <span>pasta</span> <span>dish</span> with <span>homemade</span> <span>sauce.<br/></span> 
🎧 That sounds <span>amazing!<br/></span> 
🎧 What's your <span>secret<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>ingredient</span> for the <span>sauce?<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>added</span> a bit of red <span>wine<br/></span> 
🎧 for <span>extra</span> <span>flavor.<br/></span> 
🎧 It <span>turned</span> out really <span>rich</span> and <span>tasty.<br/></span> 
🎧 Nice <span>touch!<br/></span> 
🎧 I've been <span>wanting</span> to try more new things with cooking <span>too.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you have any <span>favorite</span> cooking <span>blogs<br/></span> 
🎧 or <span>YouTube</span> <span>channels</span> that you <span>watch?<br/></span> 
🎧 I often <span>watch</span> <span>Tasty</span> <span>videos</span> on <span>YouTube</span> for <span>quick</span> and <span>easy</span> <span>recipes.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks, I'll check it <span>out.<br/></span> 
🎧 Wow, these <span>colors</span> are <span>amazing.<br/></span> 
🎧 What are you <span>looking</span> <span>at?<br/></span> 
🎧 This <span>artist</span> on <span>Instagram</span>, their <span>paintings</span> are so <span>bright.<br/></span> 
🎧 It makes me want to get out my old <span>watercolors.<br/></span> 
🎧 Really? You used to <span>paint?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, back in high <span>school.<br/></span> 
🎧 I haven't used them in <span>ages</span>, <span>though.<br/></span> 
🎧 Life just got too <span>busy.<br/></span> 
🎧 I get <span>that.<br/></span> 
🎧 You should definitely try <span>again.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe even try something <span>new,<br/></span> 
🎧 like <span>acrylics</span> or <span>something.<br/></span> 
🎧 That's a good <span>idea.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe I'll look for a <span>local</span> <span>art</span> class for <span>beginners.<br/></span> 
🎧 There is a great <span>community<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>art</span> <span>center</span> <span>downtown.<br/></span> 
🎧 They <span>offer</span> all <span>kinds</span> of <span>classes.<br/></span> 
🎧 We could even check it out together <span>sometime!<br/></span> 
🎧 You'd come with <span>me?<br/></span> 
🎧 Of <span>course.<br/></span> 
🎧 We could make a day of it and <span>explore</span> the <span>art</span> <span>supply</span> <span>store</span> <span>too.<br/></span> 
🎧 That sounds like so much <span>fun.<br/></span> 
🎧 Let me know when you're <span>free.<br/></span> 
🎧 Is it always this <span>cold</span> in the morning <span>here?<br/></span> 
🎧 Only in the <span>spring</span> and <span>fall!<br/></span> 
🎧 It <span>gets</span> nice and hot in the <span>summer</span> <span>though.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Perfect</span> for <span>hiking.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you like <span>hiking?<br/></span> 
🎧 Of <span>course.<br/></span> 
🎧 I try to go at <span>least</span> once a <span>month.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's a great way to <span>clear</span> my <span>head</span> and get some <span>exercise.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm the <span>opposite.<br/></span> 
🎧 I haven't been <span>hiking</span> in <span>ages.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm not sure if my <span>knees</span> can <span>handle</span> it when I go <span>again.<br/></span> 
🎧 Don't <span>worry.<br/></span> 
🎧 You'll get <span>beautiful</span> <span>views<br/></span> 
🎧 without the really <span>steep</span> <span>climbs.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Really?<br/></span> 
🎧 I might have to check that <span>out.<br/></span> 
🎧 What do you usually take with <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 Just the <span>basics:</span> <span>backpack</span>, water, <span>snacks</span>, and a good <span>pair</span> of <span>shoes.<br/></span> 
🎧 And sometimes a <span>camera<br/></span> 
🎧 to take <span>pictures</span> of the <span>scenery.<br/></span> 
🎧 Sounds <span>simple</span> <span>enough.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe we could plan a <span>hike</span> together <span>sometime?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'd be up for <span>that!<br/></span> 
🎧 This is for your <span>birthday</span>, <span>Anna.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thank you so <span>much!<br/></span> 
🎧 This <span>must</span> have taken you a lot of time, <span>huh?<br/></span> 
🎧 You're right, but it was <span>worth</span> <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 Did <span>someone</span> <span>teach</span> you to <span>knit,<br/></span> 
🎧 or did you learn by <span>yourself?<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>learned</span> it by myself, <span>actually.<br/></span> 
🎧 I just <span>started</span> two <span>weeks</span> <span>ago.<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>pattern</span> is really <span>impressive</span> for a <span>beginner!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Thanks.<br/></span> 
🎧 I wish I could <span>knit</span> like <span>this.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span>, <span>trust</span> me, it takes <span>practice.<br/></span> 
🎧 But it's really <span>relaxing</span> once you get the <span>hang</span> of <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 You should try <span>it!<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe I <span>should.<br/></span> 
🎧 It <span>seems</span> like a good way to <span>relax</span> after <span>work.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you think it's <span>hard</span> to <span>learn?<br/></span> 
🎧 Not at <span>all!<br/></span> 
🎧 I can <span>teach</span> you the <span>basic</span> <span>stitches</span> if you <span>want.<br/></span> 
🎧 We could even have a little <span>knitting</span> <span>night</span> <span>sometime.<br/></span> 
🎧 That would be <span>amazing!<br/></span> 
🎧 I'd love to learn from <span>you.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe we could <span>pick</span> out some <span>yarn</span> together <span>too?<br/></span> 
🎧 We can make a <span>whole</span> day of <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Knitting</span>, <span>yarn</span> <span>shopping</span>, maybe some <span>coffee...<br/></span> 
🎧 Sounds like my kind of <span>day!<br/></span> 
🎧 Let me know when you're <span>free.<br/></span> 
🎧 How's the <span>guitar</span> <span>practice</span> <span>going?<br/></span> 
🎧 Not <span>bad.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm <span>finally</span> getting the <span>hang</span> of that <span>fingerpicking</span> <span>pattern</span> you <span>showed</span> <span>me.<br/></span> 
🎧 Good <span>job.<br/></span> 
🎧 That one can be <span>tricky.<br/></span> 
🎧 You have to keep your <span>fingers</span> <span>moving</span> <span>separately.<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, it takes some <span>practice</span> for <span>sure.<br/></span> 
🎧 But it sounds so <span>cool</span> once you get it <span>right.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Definitely.<br/></span> 
🎧 By the way, did you see the <span>flyer</span> for the open <span>mic</span> <span>night</span> at our <span>favorite</span> <span>coffee</span> <span>shop</span> next <span>week?<br/></span> 
🎧 No, I <span>must</span> have <span>missed</span> <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 That sounds <span>interesting.<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, they have it every other <span>Wednesday.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Local</span> <span>musicians</span> can play a <span>song</span> or two. It's <span>pretty</span> <span>relaxed.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, that could be <span>fun.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe I could try playing something <span>simple.<br/></span> 
🎧 You <span>should!<br/></span> 
🎧 It's a good way to get over <span>stage</span> <span>fright</span> and get <span>feedback</span> from other <span>musicians.<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah. You're <span>right.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe I'll work on a <span>short</span> <span>piece</span> and give it a <span>try.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Cool</span>! Let me know if you <span>do.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'd love to come and <span>cheer</span> you <span>on.<br/></span> 
🎧 Hey <span>Nancy</span>, how's it <span>going?<br/></span> 
🎧 Hey <span>David</span>, I'm <span>good!<br/></span> 
🎧 Just <span>catching</span> up on some <span>emails.<br/></span> 
🎧 What about <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 Same <span>here.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Actually</span>, I was <span>checking</span> out your <span>social</span> <span>media</span> <span>earlier</span> and saw you <span>mentioned</span> a <span>blog.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span> <span>yeah!<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>recently</span> <span>started</span> one about <span>baking.<br/></span> 
🎧 I love trying new <span>recipes</span> and thought it'd be fun to share <span>them.<br/></span> 
🎧 That's <span>awesome.<br/></span> 
🎧 I've been thinking about <span>starting</span> a <span>blog</span> <span>myself<br/></span> 
🎧 but on something <span>completely</span> <span>different.<br/></span> 
🎧 More on the <span>tech</span> side of <span>things.<br/></span> 
🎧 You're a <span>software</span> <span>developer</span>, <span>right?<br/></span> 
🎧 So your <span>blog</span> <span>must</span> be about <span>coding.<br/></span> 
🎧 That's <span>right.<br/></span> 
🎧 I love <span>sharing</span> <span>tips</span> and <span>tricks</span> for <span>beginners.<br/></span> 
🎧 That sounds <span>interesting!<br/></span> 
🎧 I might need to check that <span>out.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Definitely!<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe we can <span>swap</span> some <span>blog</span> <span>promotion</span> <span>tips</span> <span>sometime.<br/></span> 
🎧 We could even do a <span>guest</span> <span>post</span> on <span>each<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>other's</span> <span>blogs</span> to help <span>promote</span> <span>them.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span> no, that's a great <span>idea.<br/></span> 
🎧 Let's <span>chat</span> more about it <span>later.<br/></span> 
🎧 I have a <span>presentation</span> <span>soon.<br/></span> 
🎧 Good <span>luck</span> with your <span>presentation.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Okay</span> everyone, let's start on this <span>biology</span> <span>chapter.<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>exam</span> is next week, <span>remember?<br/></span> 
🎧 There's so much to <span>study.<br/></span> 
🎧 Don't <span>worry.<br/></span> 
🎧 If we work together, it won't feel so <span>hard.<br/></span> 
🎧 Exactly. <span>Liam</span>, you did great on the last <span>bio</span> <span>exam.<br/></span> 
🎧 Any <span>tips</span> for <span>studying</span> the <span>cell</span> <span>cycle?<br/></span> 
🎧 Sure! The most <span>important</span> thing is to <span>understand</span> the different <span>phases.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Flashcards</span> can really <span>help<br/></span> 
🎧 with <span>learning</span> the <span>order.<br/></span> 
🎧 Good idea. Maybe we can make some <span>flashcards</span> together for the key <span>words?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm in! <span>Flashcards</span> are better than just <span>reading</span> the <span>textbook</span> again and <span>again.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Liam</span>, did you say something about <span>practice</span> <span>problems?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, there are some good <span>practice</span> <span>problems</span> at the end of each <span>chapter.<br/></span> 
🎧 Doing those will help us use what <span>we've</span> <span>learned.<br/></span> 
🎧 I think we can <span>split</span> up the <span>problems</span> and <span>quiz</span> each other on <span>them.<br/></span> 
🎧 This is <span>starting</span> to feel a little less <span>scary.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks for <span>setting</span> up this <span>study</span> <span>group</span>, <span>Chris!<br/></span> 
🎧 Alright everyone, thanks for <span>coming</span> to <span>tonight's</span> <span>Green</span> <span>Club</span> <span>meeting!<br/></span> 
🎧 Hey <span>Isabella</span>, glad I could make <span>it!<br/></span> 
🎧 What are we talking about <span>tonight?<br/></span> 
🎧 We have a lot to talk <span>about.<br/></span> 
🎧 First, I <span>wanted</span> to hear <span>everyone's</span> <span>ideas<br/></span> 
🎧 for the <span>Earth</span> Day <span>event</span> on <span>campus.<br/></span> 
🎧 I think we could set up a <span>booth</span> with <span>information</span> about how to live in an <span>eco-friendly</span> <span>way.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe we can have some fun <span>games</span> or <span>activities.<br/></span> 
🎧 Great idea, <span>Sarah</span>! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We could also give away <span>reusable</span> <span>shopping</span> <span>bags</span> or <span>seed</span> <span>packets.<br/></span> 
🎧 Those are both good <span>ideas!<br/></span> 
🎧 We could work with the <span>Environmental<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Science</span> <span>Club</span> to <span>reach</span> more <span>people.<br/></span> 
🎧 Love that idea, <span>Noah!<br/></span> 
🎧 We can talk to them <span>later.<br/></span> 
🎧 Now, let's think of more <span>Earth</span> Day <span>event</span> <span>ideas.<br/></span> 
🎧 We could have a <span>clothing</span> <span>swap<br/></span> 
🎧 to <span>promote</span> <span>sustainable</span> <span>fashion.<br/></span> 
🎧 People could <span>bring</span> <span>clothes</span> they don't want and <span>trade</span> them with <span>others.<br/></span> 
🎧 I had the same idea as <span>Daniel!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span> my, that <span>practice</span> was <span>tough!<br/></span> 
🎧 Tell me about <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Coach</span> <span>Miller</span> really <span>pushed</span> us <span>today.<br/></span> 
🎧 Did you see him <span>running</span> with us during the <span>drills?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, no <span>kidding</span>! He has more <span>energy</span> than all of us <span>together.<br/></span> 
🎧 It makes you want to work <span>harder</span> when you see your <span>coach</span> trying so <span>much.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Totally</span>. He really makes us want to do our <span>best.<br/></span> 
🎧 So how's your <span>ankle?<br/></span> 
🎧 I saw you <span>fall</span> <span>hard</span> during the <span>practice</span> <span>game.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's a little <span>sore</span>, but I think I'll be <span>okay.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll put ice on it <span>tonight</span> and see how it <span>feels</span> in the <span>morning.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Good.<br/></span> 
🎧 We can't have any <span>injuries<br/></span> 
🎧 before the big game next <span>week.<br/></span> 
🎧 I know <span>right?<br/></span> 
🎧 We need everyone to be at their best to <span>beat</span> the <span>Wildcats.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Speaking</span> of the game, are you <span>coming<br/></span> 
🎧 to the <span>pre-game</span> <span>pep</span> <span>rally</span> on <span>Friday?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Absolutely!<br/></span> 
🎧 We need to get <span>excited</span> for the <span>win!<br/></span> 
🎧 This <span>research</span> <span>paper<br/></span> 
🎧 is <span>giving</span> me a <span>headache.<br/></span> 
🎧 I feel like I'm not getting <span>anywhere.<br/></span> 
🎧 Me <span>too.<br/></span> 
🎧 I've been <span>looking</span> at the same <span>paragraph</span> for about <span>20</span> <span>minutes.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe we're not on the right <span>path.<br/></span> 
🎧 Have you <span>found</span> any good <span>sources</span> <span>recently?<br/></span> 
🎧 Not <span>really.<br/></span> 
🎧 Most of the <span>articles</span> I <span>found</span> are too <span>technical<br/></span> 
🎧 and don't talk about the <span>social</span> <span>impacts</span> we <span>wanted</span> to <span>focus</span> <span>on.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Ugh</span>, that's <span>frustrating.<br/></span> 
🎧 Wait, <span>Professor</span> <span>Lee</span> <span>mentioned</span> a <span>documentary</span> that might <span>help.<br/></span> 
🎧 Did you check the <span>library</span> <span>database</span> for <span>it?<br/></span> 
🎧 No, I <span>completely</span> <span>forgot!<br/></span> 
🎧 That's a good <span>idea.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe it will give us some new <span>ideas.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hopefully.<br/></span> 
🎧 In the <span>meantime</span>, I'll <span>search</span> some <span>social</span> <span>science</span> <span>journals.<br/></span> 
🎧 We just need to find the right <span>keywords.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe we can think of some <span>together.<br/></span> 
🎧 Definitely! Two <span>heads</span> are better than <span>one.<br/></span> 
🎧 Let's <span>grab</span> some <span>coffee</span> <span>first.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe a little <span>caffeine</span> will help us <span>figure</span> this <span>out.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>totally</span> <span>agree.<br/></span> 
🎧 If <span>nothing</span> <span>works</span>, we can always <span>meet</span> with <span>Professor</span> <span>Lee</span> for some <span>help.<br/></span> 
🎧 May I ask you some <span>questions</span> about your <span>company?<br/></span> 
🎧 Absolutely! <span>Welcome</span> to the <span>Technovation</span> <span>booth.<br/></span> 
🎧 My <span>name's</span> <span>Ben.<br/></span> 
🎧 What are you <span>interested</span> <span>in?<br/></span> 
🎧 My <span>name's</span> <span>Jake.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm <span>studying</span> <span>computer</span> <span>science</span>, and <span>I'm<br/></span> 
🎧 really <span>interested</span> in <span>software</span> <span>development.<br/></span> 
🎧 What kind of <span>opportunities</span> <span>do<br/></span> 
🎧 you have for new <span>graduates?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Technovation</span> is always <span>looking</span> for <span>talented</span> <span>developers.<br/></span> 
🎧 We have an <span>internship</span> <span>program</span> that's a great way to get <span>started.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span>, <span>interesting</span>! Can you tell me more about the <span>internship</span> <span>program?<br/></span> 
🎧 What kind of <span>projects</span> would <span>interns</span> work <span>on?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Interns</span> will get to <span>work<br/></span> 
🎧 on different <span>projects,<br/></span> 
🎧 from <span>adding</span> new <span>features</span> to our <span>software<br/></span> 
🎧 to <span>creating</span> new <span>applications.<br/></span> 
🎧 We <span>encourage</span> <span>interns</span> to share their <span>ideas</span> and take <span>part</span> in the <span>development</span> <span>process.<br/></span> 
🎧 That sounds really <span>good.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you have any <span>brochures</span> or <span>information</span> I can take with <span>me?<br/></span> 
🎧 Absolutely! Here you <span>go.<br/></span> 
🎧 And be sure to check our <span>website<br/></span> 
🎧 for more <span>details<br/></span> 
🎧 on the <span>internship</span> <span>program<br/></span> 
🎧 and other <span>career</span> <span>opportunities.<br/></span> 
🎧 We also <span>attend</span> other <span>career</span> <span>fairs<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>throughout</span> the <span>year<br/></span> 
🎧 so if you don't hear back from us this time, feel free to <span>meet</span> us at another <span>event.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thank you so <span>much.<br/></span> 
🎧 This has been really <span>helpful.<br/></span> 
🎧 You're <span>welcome</span>, <span>Jake!<br/></span> 
🎧 Good <span>luck</span> with your <span>job</span> <span>search.<br/></span> 
🎧 Hey May, have you <span>seen</span> <span>this?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span> wow, a <span>Vietnamese</span> <span>Culture</span> <span>Festival</span> on <span>campus</span> next week! That's <span>cool!<br/></span> 
🎧 Right? I didn't know they were doing something like <span>this.<br/></span> 
🎧 This makes me feel <span>homesick</span> <span>already.<br/></span> 
🎧 We should definitely <span>go!<br/></span> 
🎧 It would be a fun <span>way<br/></span> 
🎧 to <span>celebrate</span> our <span>culture<br/></span> 
🎧 and share <span>Vietnamese</span> <span>traditions<br/></span> 
🎧 with <span>others.<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>poster</span> <span>says</span> there will be <span>traditional</span> food <span>vendors.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>miss</span> <span>banh</span> <span>mi</span> and <span>rice</span> <span>noodles</span> <span>already.<br/></span> 
🎧 My <span>mouth</span> is <span>watering</span> just thinking about <span>them.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe they'll even have <span>sweet</span> <span>soup</span> for <span>dessert!<br/></span> 
🎧 Will there be any <span>performances?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, there will be <span>Vietnamese<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>folk</span> music <span>performances.<br/></span> 
🎧 What about <span>Vietnamese</span> <span>coffee?<br/></span> 
🎧 I hope <span>so!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Nothing</span> <span>beats</span> a <span>strong</span> cup of <span>iced</span> <span>milk<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>coffee</span> to <span>finish</span> the <span>experience.<br/></span> 
🎧 We should <span>bring</span> some of our <span>friends<br/></span> 
🎧 who don't know about <span>Vietnamese</span> <span>culture.<br/></span> 
🎧 It would be a great <span>way<br/></span> 
🎧 to <span>show</span> them our <span>traditions.<br/></span> 
🎧 Let's check the <span>poster</span> for the time and <span>place.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Okay</span>, it looks like it's <span>happening</span> next <span>Saturday</span> <span>afternoon</span> at the <span>student</span> <span>center.<br/></span> 
🎧 Let's <span>mark</span> it on our <span>calendars</span> so we don't <span>miss</span> <span>it.<br/>
</span><br/><br/>
