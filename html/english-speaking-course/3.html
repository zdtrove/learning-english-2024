🎧 Alright <span>team</span>, let's go over the <span>Q3</span> <span>sales</span> <span>report</span>.<br/> 
🎧 The <span>numbers</span> look good <span>overall</span>, but there's a <span>drop</span> in the <span>Southeast</span> <span>area</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, I <span>noticed</span> that too.<br/> 
🎧 Any <span>ideas</span> on what might be <span>causing</span> <span>it</span>?<br/> 
🎧 We haven't <span>figured</span> out the <span>exact</span> <span>cause</span> <span>yet</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It could be a <span>seasonal</span> <span>slowdown</span><br/> 
🎧 or maybe a <span>competitor</span> <span>increase</span><br/> 
🎧 their <span>advertising</span> in the <span>area</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We should look into it <span>more</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe we could <span>reach</span> out to some of our top <span>clients</span> there to see what they're <span>noticing</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Great <span>suggestion</span>, <span>Jacob</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We can also check out any <span>recent</span> <span>advertising</span><br/> 
🎧 our <span>competitors</span> have done in the <span>Southeast</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Have we thought about <span>offering</span> any <span>local</span> <span>deals</span> to <span>boost</span> <span>sales</span> there?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Interesting</span> idea, <span>Adam</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We could think of some special <span>offers</span> just for the <span>Southeast</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But we'll need to be <span>careful</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe we could try a <span>short-term</span> plan <span>focused</span> on <span>keeping</span> <span>customers</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Absolutely</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We can look into a <span>loyalty</span> <span>program</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Or <span>bonus</span> <span>points</span> for people who buy more than once in the <span>Southeast</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Agreed</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We'll put together a plan to talk with the <span>Southeast</span> <span>team</span><br/> 
🎧 and keep everyone <span>updated</span> on what we <span>find</span>.<br/> <br/> 

<h2 id="esc-3-92">Brainstorming Session <b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this, 92)">🔊</b></h2>

🎧 Alright <span>team</span><br/> 
🎧 Let's start thinking of <span>ideas</span> for the new <span>marketing</span> <span>campaign</span>!<br/> 
🎧 We need to get a lot of <span>attention</span><br/> 
🎧 with this product <span>launch</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I <span>suggest</span> <span>holding</span> a <span>contest</span><br/> 
🎧 on <span>social</span> <span>media</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We could get people talking about it and <span>increase</span> <span>interest</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Interesting</span>, <span>Beth</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But how would the <span>contest</span> <span>connect</span> to the product <span>itself</span>?<br/> 
🎧 We don't want just <span>short-term</span> <span>excitement</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, how about a <span>contest</span> where <span>users</span> make <span>content</span><br/> 
🎧 that <span>shows</span> off the <span>product's</span> <span>benefits</span> in a <span>creative</span> way?<br/> 
🎧 That sounds good!<br/> 
🎧 We could also work with <span>influencers</span><br/> 
🎧 to help the <span>contest</span> <span>reach</span> more <span>people</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I like that <span>idea</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But we also need to think about a <span>traditional</span> <span>marketing</span> <span>plan</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We could focus on online <span>ads</span>,<br/> 
🎧 or maybe a <span>TV</span> <span>commercial</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Great <span>point</span> <span>Lucy</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We should try <span>using</span> many different <span>channels</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We could also use <span>email</span> <span>marketing</span><br/> 
🎧 to <span>reach</span> our <span>existing</span> <span>customers</span>.<br/> 
🎧 A <span>pre-launch</span> <span>campaign</span> could be a great <span>idea</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Absolutely, <span>Donald</span>.<br/> 
🎧 All these <span>ideas</span> are <span>fantastic</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Let's <span>write</span> them down and decide <span>based</span> on our <span>budget</span><br/> 
🎧 and how many people we can <span>reach</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I think we should also <span>think</span><br/> 
🎧 about the <span>timeline</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We need to start this <span>campaign</span> soon to take <span>advantage</span> of the <span>current</span> <span>trends</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Let's keep working on these <span>ideas</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Once we have a better plan, we can show it to the <span>client</span> for <span>approval</span>.<br/> <br/> 

<h2 id="esc-3-198">Presentation <b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this, 198)">🔊</b></h2>

🎧 Hey <span>Tim</span>, how's the <span>presentation</span> <span>going</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Almost done, I <span>think</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Just <span>finishing</span> up the <span>slides</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Are you <span>nervous</span>?<br/> 
🎧 A little, <span>yeah</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's a big <span>proposal</span>, and I want to make a good <span>impression</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Don't <span>worry</span>, you've got this!<br/> 
🎧 Your <span>ideas</span> are really good.<br/> 
🎧 Just remember to keep it short and focus on what <span>benefits</span> they'll <span>see</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That's the best way to win them <span>over</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That's the <span>problem</span>, there's so much <span>information</span> I want to <span>include</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I get it, but too many <span>details</span> might <span>confuse</span> them.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe you could focus on the <span>main</span> <span>points</span><br/> 
🎧 and <span>offer</span> to <span>send</span> more <span>details</span> later in a <span>document</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, that's a good <span>idea</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I can also practice a few <span>times</span> to make sure I'm <span>clear</span> and <span>interesting</span>.<br/> 
🎧 A <span>smooth</span> <span>presentation</span> will definitely leave a good <span>impression</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Want to go over it with me this <span>afternoon</span>?<br/> 
🎧 That would be great, thanks <span>Paula</span>!<br/> 
🎧 You're a <span>lifesaver</span>.<br/> <br/> 

<h2 id="esc-3-274">Team-Building activities <b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this, 274)">🔊</b></h2>

🎧 Hey <span>David</span>, did you hear about the company <span>picnic</span> next month?<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, I saw the <span>email</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Sounds fun, free food and <span>all</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, but I'm not a big fan of those <span>team-building</span> <span>activities</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Remember</span> the <span>trust</span> <span>fall</span> last year? So <span>awkward</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, that was a bit much.<br/> 
🎧 But maybe this year will be <span>different</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I heard they're trying something <span>new</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Really? What is <span>it</span>?<br/> 
🎧 An <span>escape</span> room!<br/> 
🎧 We'll work together to <span>solve</span> <span>puzzles</span> and <span>escape</span> a <span>themed</span> room in a set time.<br/> 
🎧 That actually sounds <span>fun</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I love <span>puzzles</span>, and a little <span>friendly</span> <span>competition</span> sounds good.<br/> 
🎧 Right? <span>Plus</span>, it might be a good way to get to know some <span>coworkers</span> we don't know well.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe I'll finally get to know<br/> 
🎧 <span>Kevin</span> from <span>accounting</span>.<br/> 
🎧 He always <span>seems</span> really <span>quiet</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe the <span>escape</span> room will show his <span>puzzle</span> <span>skills</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We should <span>sign</span> up together!<br/> <br/> 

<h2 id="esc-3-354">Coffee breaks <b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this, 354)">🔊</b></h2>

🎧 Man, that <span>report</span> <span>deadline</span> was tough.<br/> 
🎧 My <span>brain</span> <span>feels</span> like it's <span>tired</span> from <span>staring</span> at <span>spreadsheets</span> all <span>morning</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Ready</span> for a <span>coffee</span> <span>break</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Almost. I just need to <span>finish</span> this <span>email</span>.<br/> 
🎧 No <span>worries</span>, take your time.<br/> 
🎧 But <span>seriously</span>, you've been looking at that <span>screen</span> for hours.<br/> 
🎧 You <span>deserve</span> a <span>break</span>!<br/> 
🎧 You're right.<br/> 
🎧 My <span>brain</span> <span>feels</span> really <span>tired</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Where are you thinking? The <span>usual</span> <span>place</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Of course.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe they finally <span>restock</span> <span>those</span><br/> 
🎧 <span>blueberry</span> <span>muffins</span> this time.<br/> 
🎧 Now you're <span>speaking</span> my <span>language</span>!<br/> 
🎧 <span>Coffee</span> and <span>muffins</span> are a perfect <span>match</span>.<br/> 
🎧 So, what are you working on that's got you so <span>focused</span> today?<br/> 
🎧 Is it another one of those big <span>marketing</span><br/> 
🎧 <span>campaigns</span> <span>everyone's</span> been talking <span>about</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Just a <span>presentation</span><br/> 
🎧 for the <span>marketing</span> <span>team</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We're thinking of some new <span>social</span> <span>media</span> <span>ideas</span> to get more people <span>involved</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, fun! Anything <span>exciting</span> you can <span>share</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Maybe if you buy me that <span>muffin</span>...<br/> 
🎧 Alright, alright, keep your <span>secrets</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But <span>seriously</span>, I'm <span>curious</span>!<br/> 
🎧 We'll <span>see</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But for now, let's get some <span>coffee</span>, and maybe I'll tell you <span>more</span>.<br/> <br/> 

<h2 id="esc-3-441">Networking event <b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this, 441)">🔊</b></h2>

🎧 I work in <span>marketing</span> at <span>Green</span> <span>Tech</span> <span>Solutions</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Duke</span>, nice to meet you!<br/> 
🎧 I'm with Sun <span>City</span> <span>Solar</span>. We <span>install</span> <span>solar</span> <span>panels</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, <span>cool</span>! That's a <span>growing</span> <span>business</span>, isn't <span>it</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, a lot of people are interested in <span>clean</span> <span>energy</span>.<br/> 
🎧 At <span>GreenTech</span>, we're working on a <span>project</span> to help <span>eco-friendly</span> <span>businesses</span> in the <span>city</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Interesting</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Maybe we could find some <span>ways</span> to work together.<br/> 
🎧 We always look for <span>ways</span> to <span>connect</span> <span>with</span><br/> 
🎧 people who <span>care</span> about the <span>environment</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Would you like to <span>exchange</span> <span>business</span> <span>cards</span>?<br/>

🎧 What kind of <span>marketing</span> are you working <span>on</span>?<br/> 
🎧 We're <span>focusing</span> on <span>social</span> <span>media</span> and <span>local</span> <span>events</span>.<br/>

🎧 Sure, <span>Amelia</span>. Have a <span>seat</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What's on your <span>mind</span>?<br/> 
🎧 It's about the <span>Johnson</span> <span>project</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I <span>looked</span> at our plan <span>again</span>,<br/> 
🎧 and I think we need to change the time for the <span>design</span> <span>part</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What's the <span>problem</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Well, the <span>client</span> gave me new <span>feedback</span> <span>yesterday</span><br/> 
🎧 and it looks like the <span>design</span> <span>needs</span><br/> 
🎧 more work than I thought.<br/> 
🎧 I <span>see</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe we should give the <span>design</span> an <span>extra</span> <span>week</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Do you think that will <span>change</span><br/> 
🎧 the <span>launch</span> date?<br/> 
🎧 I hope not.<br/> 
🎧 We can move some other things,<br/> 
🎧 like <span>making</span> the <span>content</span> or <span>testing</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Okay, let's check the whole plan and see if we can change <span>anything</span>.<br/> 
🎧 For <span>sure</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'll <span>update</span> the <span>design</span> <span>schedule</span><br/> 
🎧 and <span>send</span> it to you to look at.<br/> 
🎧 Sounds good, <span>Amelia</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe we can have lunch this <span>week</span><br/> 
🎧 and talk about <span>ideas</span> for the new <span>design</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Great <span>idea</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Thanks, <span>Mark</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'm glad you're <span>helping</span> me with this.<br/> 
🎧 No <span>problem</span>, <span>Amelia</span>.<br/>

🎧 Are you into <span>photography</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, I've been getting into it lately.<br/> 
🎧 It's such a fun <span>hobby</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I can <span>tell</span>!<br/>

🎧 What got you into <span>photography</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I just want to <span>capture</span> special <span>moments</span> and <span>memories</span>.<br/>

🎧 Oh. That's <span>cool</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What kind of things<br/> 
🎧 do you usually take <span>pictures</span> <span>of</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I love taking <span>photos</span> of <span>landscapes</span>,<br/>

🎧 The <span>light</span> is just <span>beautiful</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>Portraits</span> are great too.<br/> 
🎧 You should try it out sometime.<br/> 
🎧 It's all about <span>experimenting</span><br/> 
🎧 and <span>enjoying</span> the <span>process</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, I'll have to <span>dust</span> off my <span>camera</span> and give it a <span>try</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Thanks for the <span>encouragement</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Anytime</span>!<br/>

🎧 <span>Nothing</span> much, probably just <span>relaxing</span> at home.<br/> 
🎧 How about you?<br/> 
🎧 Me too, actually.<br/> 
🎧 I'm thinking of trying a new <span>recipe</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Have you been cooking anything fun lately?<br/> 
🎧 You know me and <span>fancy</span> <span>recipes</span>, <span>haha</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But I did try these <span>veggie</span> <span>burgers</span> the other day.<br/> 
🎧 They were <span>pretty</span> good.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Veggie</span> <span>burgers</span>, <span>huh</span>? Sounds <span>healthy</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'm in the <span>mood</span> for something a bit <span>greasier</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe some <span>macaroni</span> and <span>cheese</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Not a bad <span>idea</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Last <span>night</span>, I made a <span>delicious</span> <span>pasta</span> <span>dish</span> with <span>homemade</span> <span>sauce</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That sounds amazing!<br/> 
🎧 What's your <span>secret</span><br/> 
🎧 <span>ingredient</span> for the <span>sauce</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I <span>added</span> a bit of red <span>wine</span><br/> 
🎧 for <span>extra</span> <span>flavor</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It <span>turned</span> out really <span>rich</span> and <span>tasty</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Nice touch!<br/> 
🎧 I've been <span>wanting</span> to try more new things with cooking too.<br/> 
🎧 Do you have any <span>favorite</span> cooking <span>blogs</span><br/> 
🎧 or <span>YouTube</span> <span>channels</span> that you <span>watch</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I often <span>watch</span> <span>Tasty</span> <span>videos</span> on <span>YouTube</span> for <span>quick</span> and easy <span>recipes</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Thanks, I'll check it out.<br/> <br/>

🎧 This <span>artist</span> on <span>Instagram</span>, their <span>paintings</span> are so <span>bright</span>.<br/>

🎧 I haven't used them in <span>ages</span>, <span>though</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Life just got too <span>busy</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I get that.<br/> 
🎧 You should definitely try <span>again</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe even try something <span>new</span>,<br/> 
🎧 like <span>acrylics</span> or <span>something</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That's a good <span>idea</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe I'll look for a <span>local</span> <span>art</span> class for <span>beginners</span>.<br/> 
🎧 There is a great <span>community</span><br/> 
🎧 <span>art</span> <span>center</span> <span>downtown</span>.<br/> 
🎧 They <span>offer</span> all <span>kinds</span> of <span>classes</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We could even check it out together sometime!<br/> 
🎧 You'd come with me?<br/> 
🎧 Of course.<br/> 
🎧 We could make a day of it and <span>explore</span> the <span>art</span> <span>supply</span> <span>store</span> too.<br/>

🎧 Let me know when you're <span>free</span>.<br/> <br/> 

<h2 id="esc-3-835">Hiking <b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this, 835)">🔊</b></h2>

🎧 Is it always this <span>cold</span> in the morning here?<br/> 
🎧 Only in the <span>spring</span> and <span>fall</span>!<br/> 
🎧 It <span>gets</span> nice and hot in the <span>summer</span> <span>though</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Perfect for <span>hiking</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Do you like <span>hiking</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Of course.<br/> 
🎧 I try to go at <span>least</span> once a month.<br/> 
🎧 It's a great way to <span>clear</span> my <span>head</span> and get some <span>exercise</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'm the <span>opposite</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I haven't been <span>hiking</span> in <span>ages</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'm not sure if my <span>knees</span> can <span>handle</span> it when I go <span>again</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Don't <span>worry</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You'll get <span>beautiful</span> <span>views</span><br/> 
🎧 without the really <span>steep</span> <span>climbs</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Really</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I might have to check that out.<br/> 
🎧 What do you usually take with you?<br/> 
🎧 Just the <span>basics:</span> <span>backpack</span>, water, <span>snacks</span>, and a good <span>pair</span> of <span>shoes</span>.<br/> 
🎧 And sometimes a <span>camera</span><br/>

🎧 This is for your <span>birthday</span>, Anna.<br/> 
🎧 Thank you so much!<br/> 
🎧 This must have taken you a lot of time, <span>huh</span>?<br/> 
🎧 You're right, but it was <span>worth</span> <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Did someone <span>teach</span> you to <span>knit</span>,<br/> 
🎧 or did you learn by yourself?<br/> 
🎧 I <span>learned</span> it by myself, actually.<br/> 
🎧 I just <span>started</span> two <span>weeks</span> <span>ago</span>.<br/> 
🎧 The <span>pattern</span> is really <span>impressive</span> for a <span>beginner</span>!<br/> 
🎧 <span>Thanks</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I wish I could <span>knit</span> like this.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, <span>trust</span> me, it takes practice.<br/> 
🎧 But it's really <span>relaxing</span> once you get the <span>hang</span> of <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You should try <span>it</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Maybe I <span>should</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It <span>seems</span> like a good way to <span>relax</span> after work.<br/> 
🎧 Do you think it's <span>hard</span> to <span>learn</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Not at <span>all</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I can <span>teach</span> you the <span>basic</span> <span>stitches</span> if you want.<br/> 
🎧 We could even have a little <span>knitting</span> <span>night</span> sometime.<br/> 
🎧 That would be amazing!<br/> 
🎧 I'd love to learn from you.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe we could <span>pick</span> out some <span>yarn</span> together too?<br/> 
🎧 We can make a whole day of <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Knitting</span>, <span>yarn</span> <span>shopping</span>, maybe some <span>coffee</span>...<br/> 
🎧 Sounds like my kind of day!<br/> 
🎧 Let me know when you're <span>free</span>.<br/> <br/>

🎧 How's the <span>guitar</span> practice <span>going</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Not bad.<br/> 
🎧 I'm finally getting the <span>hang</span> of that <span>fingerpicking</span> <span>pattern</span> you <span>showed</span> me.<br/> 
🎧 Good <span>job</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That one can be <span>tricky</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You have to keep your <span>fingers</span> <span>moving</span> <span>separately</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, it takes some practice for <span>sure</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But it sounds so <span>cool</span> once you get it right.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Definitely</span>.<br/> 
🎧 By the way, did you see the <span>flyer</span> for the open <span>mic</span> <span>night</span> at our <span>favorite</span> <span>coffee</span> <span>shop</span> next <span>week</span>?<br/> 
🎧 No, I must have <span>missed</span> <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That sounds <span>interesting</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, they have it every other <span>Wednesday</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Local</span> <span>musicians</span> can play a <span>song</span> or two. It's <span>pretty</span> <span>relaxed</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, that could be <span>fun</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe I could try playing something simple.<br/> 
🎧 You <span>should</span>!<br/> 
🎧 It's a good way to get over <span>stage</span> <span>fright</span> and get <span>feedback</span> from other <span>musicians</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Yeah. You're right.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe I'll work on a short <span>piece</span> and give it a <span>try</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Cool</span>! Let me know if you do.<br/> 
🎧 I'd love to come and <span>cheer</span> you <span>on</span>.<br/> <br/>

🎧 Hey <span>David</span>, I'm good!<br/> 
🎧 Just <span>catching</span> up on some <span>emails</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What about you?<br/> 
🎧 Same here.<br/> 
🎧 Actually, I was <span>checking</span> out your <span>social</span> <span>media</span> <span>earlier</span> and saw you <span>mentioned</span> a <span>blog</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh <span>yeah</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I <span>recently</span> <span>started</span> one about <span>baking</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I love trying new <span>recipes</span> and thought it'd be fun to share them.<br/> 
🎧 That's <span>awesome</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I've been thinking about <span>starting</span> a <span>blog</span> <span>myself</span><br/> 
🎧 but on something <span>completely</span> <span>different</span>.<br/> 
🎧 More on the <span>tech</span> side of things.<br/> 
🎧 You're a <span>software</span> <span>developer</span>, right?<br/> 
🎧 So your <span>blog</span> must be about <span>coding</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That's right.<br/> 
🎧 I love <span>sharing</span> <span>tips</span> and <span>tricks</span> for <span>beginners</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That sounds <span>interesting</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I might need to check that out.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Definitely</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Maybe we can <span>swap</span> some <span>blog</span> <span>promotion</span> <span>tips</span> sometime.<br/> 
🎧 We could even do a <span>guest</span> <span>post</span> on <span>each</span><br/> 
🎧 <span>other's</span> <span>blogs</span> to help <span>promote</span> them.<br/> 
🎧 Oh no, that's a great <span>idea</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Let's <span>chat</span> more about it later.<br/>

🎧 Okay everyone, let's start on this <span>biology</span> <span>chapter</span>.<br/> 
🎧 The <span>exam</span> is next week, remember?<br/> 
🎧 There's so much to <span>study</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Don't <span>worry</span>.<br/> 
🎧 If we work together, it won't feel so <span>hard</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Exactly. <span>Liam</span>, you did great on the last <span>bio</span> <span>exam</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Any <span>tips</span> for <span>studying</span> the <span>cell</span> <span>cycle</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Sure! The most important thing is to <span>understand</span> the different <span>phases</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Flashcards</span> can really <span>help</span><br/> 
🎧 with <span>learning</span> the order.<br/> 
🎧 Good idea. Maybe we can make some <span>flashcards</span> together for the key <span>words</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I'm in! <span>Flashcards</span> are better than just <span>reading</span> the <span>textbook</span> again and <span>again</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Liam</span>, did you say something about practice <span>problems</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, there are some good practice <span>problems</span> at the end of each <span>chapter</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Doing those will help us use what we've <span>learned</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I think we can <span>split</span> up the <span>problems</span> and <span>quiz</span> each other on them.<br/> 
🎧 This is <span>starting</span> to feel a little less <span>scary</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Thanks for <span>setting</span> up this <span>study</span> group, <span>Chris</span>!<br/> <br/>

🎧 Hey <span>Isabella</span>, glad I could make <span>it</span>!<br/> 
🎧 What are we talking about <span>tonight</span>?<br/> 
🎧 We have a lot to talk <span>about</span>.<br/> 
🎧 First, I wanted to hear <span>everyone's</span> <span>ideas</span><br/> 
🎧 for the <span>Earth</span> Day <span>event</span> on <span>campus</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I think we could set up a <span>booth</span> with <span>information</span> about how to live in an <span>eco-friendly</span> way.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe we can have some fun <span>games</span> or <span>activities</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Great idea, <span>Sarah</span>! <span></span><br/> 
🎧 We could also give away <span>reusable</span> <span>shopping</span> <span>bags</span> or <span>seed</span> <span>packets</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Those are both good <span>ideas</span>!<br/> 
🎧 We could work with the <span>Environmental</span><br/> 
🎧 <span>Science</span> <span>Club</span> to <span>reach</span> more <span>people</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Love that idea, <span>Noah</span>!<br/> 
🎧 We can talk to them later.<br/> 
🎧 Now, let's think of more <span>Earth</span> Day <span>event</span> <span>ideas</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We could have a <span>clothing</span> <span>swap</span><br/> 
🎧 to <span>promote</span> <span>sustainable</span> <span>fashion</span>.<br/> 
🎧 People could <span>bring</span> <span>clothes</span> they don't want and <span>trade</span> them with <span>others</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I had the same idea as <span>Daniel</span>!<br/> <br/>

🎧 Tell me about <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Coach</span> <span>Miller</span> really <span>pushed</span> us today.<br/> 
🎧 Did you see him <span>running</span> with us during the <span>drills</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, no <span>kidding</span>! He has more <span>energy</span> than all of us together.<br/> 
🎧 It makes you want to work <span>harder</span> when you see your <span>coach</span> trying so much.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Totally</span>. He really makes us want to do our <span>best</span>.<br/> 
🎧 So how's your <span>ankle</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I saw you <span>fall</span> <span>hard</span> during the practice <span>game</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's a little <span>sore</span>, but I think I'll be okay.<br/> 
🎧 I'll put ice on it <span>tonight</span> and see how it <span>feels</span> in the <span>morning</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Good</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We can't have any <span>injuries</span><br/> 
🎧 before the big game next <span>week</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I know right?<br/> 
🎧 We need everyone to be at their best to <span>beat</span> the <span>Wildcats</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Speaking</span> of the game, are you <span>coming</span><br/> 
🎧 to the <span>pre-game</span> <span>pep</span> <span>rally</span> on <span>Friday</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Absolutely</span>!<br/>

🎧 I've been looking at the same <span>paragraph</span> for about <span>20</span> <span>minutes</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe we're not on the right <span>path</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Have you <span>found</span> any good <span>sources</span> <span>recently</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Not <span>really</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Most of the <span>articles</span> I <span>found</span> are too <span>technical</span><br/> 
🎧 and don't talk about the <span>social</span> <span>impacts</span> we wanted to focus <span>on</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Ugh</span>, that's <span>frustrating</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Wait, <span>Professor</span> <span>Lee</span> <span>mentioned</span> a <span>documentary</span> that might help.<br/> 
🎧 Did you check the <span>library</span> <span>database</span> for <span>it</span>?<br/> 
🎧 No, I <span>completely</span> <span>forgot</span>!<br/> 
🎧 That's a good <span>idea</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe it will give us some new <span>ideas</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Hopefully</span>.<br/> 
🎧 In the <span>meantime</span>, I'll <span>search</span> some <span>social</span> <span>science</span> <span>journals</span>.<br/>

🎧 Let's <span>grab</span> some <span>coffee</span> <span>first</span>.<br/>
