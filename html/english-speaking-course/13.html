<h2 id="esc-13-700">At school</h2>

🎧 Good morning, class. Today we will learn about <span>plants</span>.<br/>
🎧 That sounds fun.<br/>
🎧 Can <span>anybody</span> tell me what <span>plants</span> need to <span>grow</span>?<br/>
🎧 They need water and <span>sunlight</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>correct</span>, <span>Mark</span>. What else?<br/>
🎧 They need <span>soil</span>.<br/>
🎧 Very good, <span>Jenny</span>. <span>Plants</span> also need air to <span>grow</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have a <span>plant</span> at home.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>growing</span> <span>fast</span>!<br/>
🎧 That's great, <span>Mark</span>.<br/>
🎧 Taking <span>care</span> of <span>plants</span> is a good way to learn about <span>nature</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can we <span>plant</span> something in class?<br/>
🎧 Yes, we will <span>plant</span> some <span>seeds</span> today and <span>watch</span> them <span>grow</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Cool</span>.<br/>
🎧 What kind of <span>seeds</span> do we have?<br/>
🎧 We have <span>sunflower</span> and <span>tomato</span> <span>seeds</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can choose which one to <span>plant</span>.<br/>
🎧 I want to <span>plant</span> <span>sunflowers</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're so <span>bright</span> and happy.<br/>
🎧 I'll <span>plant</span> <span>tomatoes</span>. I love <span>fresh</span> <span>tomatoes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great <span>choices</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Teacher</span>, how long does it take for them to <span>grow</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Sunflowers</span> can take a few <span>weeks</span> to <span>sprout</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Tomatoes</span> might take a bit <span>longer</span>, but we will see <span>progress</span> soon.<br/>
🎧 I can't wait to see my <span>tomato</span> <span>plant</span> <span>grow</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll water it every day.<br/>
🎧 That's the <span>spirit</span>.<br/>
🎧 But make sure not to <span>overwater</span> them.<br/>
🎧 <span>Plants</span> need just the right <span>amount</span> of water.<br/>
🎧 This is going to be fun.<br/>
🎧 I'm glad you're <span>excited</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now let's get <span>started</span>.<br/>
<span><br/></span>

<h2 id="esc-13-806">At the airport</h2>

🎧 Our <span>flight</span> is <span>overbooked</span>.<br/>
🎧 What? Are we not going to get on the <span>plane</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, <span>they're</span> <span>asking</span> for <span>volunteers</span> to take a later <span>flight</span>.<br/>
🎧 They're <span>offering</span> free <span>tickets</span> and <span>hotel</span> <span>stays</span>.<br/>
🎧 That sounds <span>tempting</span>. Should we <span>volunteer</span>?<br/>
🎧 I think so. We can have an <span>extra</span> day in the <span>city</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, it's been a long time since we had a <span>surprise</span> <span>adventure</span>.<br/>
🎧 You're right. Let's go talk to the <span>gate</span> <span>agent</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hi. How can I help you?<br/>

🎧 Looks like we have an <span>unexpected</span> <span>adventure</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's make the most of it.<br/>
🎧 We can <span>explore</span> the <span>city</span> more.<br/>
🎧 Maybe we can visit that <span>museum</span> we <span>didn't</span> have time for?<br/>
🎧 And try that famous <span>restaurant</span>. This <span>turned</span> out well!<br/>
<span><br/></span>

<h2 id="esc-13-901">At the supermarket</h2>

🎧 Tom, have you <span>seen</span> the new <span>smart</span> <span>shopping</span> <span>carts</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, <span>what's</span> so special about them?<br/>
🎧 They have <span>screens</span> that <span>guide</span> you through your <span>shopping</span> <span>list</span> and <span>suggest</span> <span>recipes</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>That's</span> <span>cool</span>! <span>Let's</span> try one.<br/>
🎧 Alright, <span>let's</span> start with <span>vegetables</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>cart</span> <span>says</span> <span>there's</span> a <span>discount</span> on <span>tomatoes</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Perfect</span> <span>timing</span>. We need <span>tomatoes</span> for our <span>salad</span> <span>tonight</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now it's <span>guiding</span> us to the food <span>section</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's like we have a <span>personal</span> <span>assistant</span>.<br/>
🎧 Look, it's <span>suggesting</span> a <span>fruit</span> <span>salad</span> <span>recipe</span>.<br/>
🎧 Should we try this <span>recipe</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, <span>let's</span> get some <span>strawberries</span> and <span>blueberries</span>.<br/>
🎧 Next <span>stop</span>, <span>dairy</span>. It <span>says</span> <span>there's</span> a <span>sale</span> on <span>milk</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>cart</span> is <span>amazing</span>. <span>We're</span> <span>saving</span> so much time.<br/>
🎧 And money! <span>Let's</span> get some <span>cheese</span> and <span>eggs</span> too.<br/>
🎧 Don't <span>forget</span> to <span>grab</span> some <span>yogurt</span>. It's on <span>sale</span> too.<br/>
🎧 No, it's taking us to the <span>pasta</span> <span>aisle</span>.<br/>
🎧 How about we try that new <span>brand</span> of <span>spaghetti</span>?<br/>
🎧 Good idea. <span>I've</span> <span>heard</span> it's really good.<br/>
🎧 Let's get some <span>sauce</span> <span>too<br/>
</span>🎧 The <span>cart</span> <span>suggests</span> a <span>marinara</span> <span>sauce</span>. It's <span>perfect</span> for our dinner.<br/>
🎧 I love that it <span>suggests</span> side <span>dishes</span>, too.<br/>
🎧 Let's get some <span>garlic</span> <span>bread</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is the <span>easiest</span> <span>shopping</span> <span>trip</span> ever.<br/>
🎧 Let's <span>head</span> to the <span>checkout</span>.<br/>
🎧 I agree we should use this <span>cart</span> every time.<br/>
<span><br/></span>

<h2 id="esc-13-1006">At the library</h2>

🎧 <span>Jake</span>, have you <span>found</span> any good books for our <span>project</span>?<br/>
🎧 I <span>found</span> a few on <span>recycling</span> and <span>waste</span> <span>management</span>.<br/>
🎧 They look really <span>useful</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 We should find some that <span>explain</span> how <span>recycling</span> helps the <span>environment</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good idea.<br/>
🎧 Let's check the <span>science</span> <span>section</span>.<br/>
🎧 Look, there's a whole <span>shelf</span> on <span>recycling</span>.<br/>
🎧 Wow, these books look <span>detailed</span>.<br/>
🎧 This one has a lot of <span>pictures</span> and <span>diagrams</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Perfect</span>! <span>Visuals</span> will make our <span>presentation</span> more <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 Should we get a book on how to start a <span>recycling</span> <span>program</span> at school?<br/>
🎧 Yes, that would add <span>practical</span> <span>ideas</span> to our <span>project</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you think we need anything else?<br/>
🎧 Maybe a book on <span>creative</span> <span>ways</span> to <span>reuse</span> <span>materials</span>.<br/>
🎧 That would be fun to <span>include</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good thinking.<br/>
🎧 Let's <span>grab</span> this one to.<br/>
🎧 Find everything you need.<br/>
🎧 Yes, we're working on a <span>science</span> <span>fair</span> <span>project</span> about <span>recycling</span>.<br/>
🎧 That sounds <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good <span>luck</span> with your <span>project</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Let's <span>head</span> back and start <span>reading</span>.<br/>
🎧 We have a lot to <span>cover</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>looking</span> forward to it.<br/>
🎧 This is going to be a great <span>project</span>.<br/>
🎧 Look at this <span>part</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>says</span> <span>recycling</span> helps to <span>reduce</span> <span>pollution</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is <span>perfect</span> for our <span>project</span>.<br/>
🎧 And this book <span>shows</span> how to start a <span>recycling</span> <span>program</span> at school.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>important</span> for the <span>environment</span>.<br/>
🎧 We could <span>suggest</span> having different <span>bins</span> for <span>paper</span>, <span>plastic</span> and <span>glass</span>.<br/>
🎧 That would make it <span>easier</span> for everyone to <span>recycle</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Awesome</span>.<br/>
🎧 And these <span>ideas</span> for <span>reusing</span> things are <span>cool</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>project</span> will be really special.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 The more I read, the more <span>excited</span> I get.<br/>

<h2 id="esc-13-1363">At the <span>police</span> station</h2>

🎧 I <span>can't</span> <span>believe</span> <span>someone</span> <span>stole</span> my <span>bike</span>, <span>Mark</span>.<br/>
🎧 I loved that <span>bike</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know, <span>Jane</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's <span>report</span> it and see what the <span>police</span> can do to help.<br/>
🎧 Good <span>afternoon</span>. How can I help you today?<br/>
🎧 Hi, I need to <span>report</span> a <span>stolen</span> <span>bike</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was taken from my back <span>yard</span> last <span>night</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm sorry to hear that.<br/>
🎧 Can you tell me what the <span>bike</span> looks like?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's a <span>blue</span> <span>mountain</span> <span>bike</span> with a <span>black</span> <span>seat</span> and <span>silver</span> <span>handlebars</span>.<br/>
🎧 It also has a small <span>bell</span> on the <span>left</span> <span>handlebar</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, I have that.<br/>
🎧 Does it have any special <span>numbers</span> or <span>marks</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, <span>there's</span> a <span>serial</span> <span>number</span> on the <span>frame</span> near the <span>pedals</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>12345AB</span>.<br/>
🎧 And it has a <span>scratch</span> on the <span>left</span> side of the <span>frame</span> from a <span>fall</span> a few <span>weeks</span> ago.<br/>
🎧 That's very <span>helpful</span>.<br/>
🎧 Did you see anything <span>strange</span> or <span>anyone</span> near your house <span>recently</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, everything <span>seemed</span> <span>normal</span>.<br/>
🎧 We didn't hear anything either.<br/>
🎧 Okay. I'll <span>write</span> the <span>report</span> and tell our <span>officers</span> to look for your <span>bike</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>meantime</span>, you might want to check <span>local</span> <span>pawn</span> <span>shops</span> and online <span>marketplaces</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you for your advice and your help.<br/>
🎧 We'll do our best to find your <span>bike</span>.<br/>
🎧 If we find any <span>clues</span>, <span>we'll</span> <span>contact</span> you right away.<br/>
🎧 And maybe we can put up some <span>posters</span> around the <span>neighborhood</span> too.<br/>
🎧 Good idea. <span>We'll</span> find it, <span>Jane</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great, you should do that.<br/>
