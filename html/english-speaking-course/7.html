<h2>What did you do last weekend?</h2>

🎧 Hey <span>Liam</span>! What a <span>surprise</span> to see you <span>here!<br/></span> 
🎧 Hey <span>Sarah</span>! Same <span>here.<br/></span> 
🎧 What are you up <span>to?<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, you know, just <span>grabbing</span> an <span>iced</span> <span>latte.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's so hot <span>out!<br/></span> 
🎧 What did you do last <span>week?<br/></span> 
🎧 I feel like I haven't <span>seen</span> you in <span>forever.<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, it's been <span>crazy</span> <span>busy.<br/></span> 
🎧 I was working on a big <span>project</span> all <span>week,<br/></span> 
🎧 but I <span>finally</span> <span>finished</span> it <span>yesterday.<br/></span> 
🎧 What about <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 Did you do anything <span>fun?<br/></span> 
🎧 Working on a <span>project</span> sounds <span>intense!<br/></span> 
🎧 Glad you <span>finished.<br/></span> 
🎧 For me, last week was <span>pretty</span> <span>chill.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>spent</span> most of the time <span>reading</span> that book you <span>recommended.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Remember?<br/></span> 
🎧 The one about the <span>surfing</span> <span>competition?<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh yeah, <span>right!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>"Waves</span> of <span>Courage"<br/></span> 
🎧 Did you like <span>it?<br/></span> 
🎧 Loved it! Made me want to learn how to <span>surf</span>, <span>actually.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe we could check out some <span>lessons</span> <span>sometime.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Mind</span> if I sit <span>here?<br/></span> 
🎧 Not at <span>all.<br/></span> 
🎧 Hey <span>Maya</span>, how was your <span>day?<br/></span> 
🎧 It was good, thanks for <span>asking!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Relaxing</span> <span>mostly.<br/></span> 
🎧 What about <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 Did you do anything <span>fun?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Actually</span>, yeah! I went <span>hiking</span> with some friends on <span>Saturday.<br/></span> 
🎧 It was a <span>beautiful</span> <span>trail</span>, with a great <span>view</span> at the <span>top.<br/></span> 
🎧 Sounds <span>awesome</span>! Do you have any <span>hobbies</span> like <span>that?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hiking</span>, I <span>mean.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hiking's</span> definitely one of <span>them.<br/></span> 
🎧 I also love <span>reading</span>, and going to the <span>movies.<br/></span> 
🎧 What about <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 Anything you like to do in your free <span>time?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, <span>reading</span> sounds <span>nice.<br/></span> 
🎧 I haven't had much time for that <span>lately.<br/></span> 
🎧 But I do love to <span>bake!<br/></span> 
🎧 Like <span>cookies</span>, <span>cakes</span>, all <span>sorts</span> of <span>things.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's <span>relaxing</span> for <span>me.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe you could <span>bake</span> us some <span>cookies</span> <span>sometime?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'd be happy to be your <span>taste</span> <span>tester.<br/></span> 
🎧 Sure, maybe! We could even try a new <span>recipe</span> together <span>sometime.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Daniel</span>, what's for lunch <span>today?<br/></span> 
🎧 Just a <span>sandwich</span> and some <span>fruit.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Healthy</span> <span>stuff</span>, you <span>know?<br/></span> 
🎧 What about <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 Same here, <span>boring</span> <span>salad.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Ugh</span>, I wish I had something more <span>exciting.<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, you can always have some of my <span>sandwich.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's <span>ham</span> and <span>cheese</span>, <span>pretty</span> <span>classic.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks, but I'm <span>good.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Speaking</span> of <span>exciting</span> food, what's your <span>favorite</span> <span>food?<br/></span> 
🎧 If you could eat anything right now, what would it <span>be?<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, that's a tough <span>one.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe some <span>spicy</span> <span>noodles</span> from that new place <span>downtown?<br/></span> 
🎧 They're <span>incredible.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Spicy</span> <span>noodles</span>? Sounds <span>interesting.<br/></span> 
🎧 I haven't <span>tried</span> them <span>yet.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do they have anything <span>vegetarian?<br/></span> 
🎧 For sure! They have <span>lots</span> of <span>options</span>. We should go try it together <span>sometime.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe next <span>weekend?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm always up for trying new <span>food.<br/></span> 
🎧 Wow, this place is <span>beautiful.<br/></span> 
🎧 It looks like a <span>postcard.<br/></span> 
🎧 Right? I'm glad you like <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 This is <span>Capri</span>, a famous <span>island</span> near <span>Naples.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Amazing</span>! So, where do you like to travel the <span>most?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Beach</span> <span>places</span> like this, or somewhere <span>else?<br/></span> 
🎧 I love <span>beaches</span> for <span>relaxing</span>, for <span>sure.<br/></span> 
🎧 But I also enjoy <span>cities</span> with a lot of <span>history</span>, like <span>Rome</span> or <span>London.<br/></span> 
🎧 There's always something new to <span>learn.<br/></span> 
🎧 Me too! Last <span>summer</span>, I went to <span>Prague.<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>buildings</span> were <span>incredible</span>, <span>especially</span> the old <span>castle.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Prague</span> sounds <span>amazing.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe <span>someday</span> we can travel <span>together.<br/></span> 
🎧 We could find a place with both <span>beaches</span> and <span>history.<br/></span> 
🎧 Now that's an <span>idea!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Greece</span> maybe? They have <span>beautiful</span> <span>islands</span> and <span>amazing</span> <span>ruins</span> <span>too.<br/></span> 
🎧 We could even learn a few <span>basic</span> <span>Greek</span> <span>phrases</span> before we <span>go.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Deal</span>! This <span>trip</span> is already <span>giving</span> me <span>ideas</span> for the next <span>one.<br/></span> 
🎧 Wow, that's an <span>amazing</span> <span>throw!<br/></span> 
🎧 Your dog is <span>super</span> <span>fast.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks! This is <span>Charlie</span>. He <span>loves</span> to play <span>fetch.<br/></span> 
🎧 What about your <span>cute</span> <span>dog?<br/></span> 
🎧 This is <span>Max</span>. He <span>likes</span> to <span>sniff</span> around for <span>squirrels</span>, but he <span>loves</span> to play <span>too.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you have any other <span>pets</span> <span>besides</span> <span>Charlie?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Nope</span>, <span>Charlie's</span> my only <span>pet.<br/></span> 
🎧 What about you? Any other <span>pets</span> at <span>home?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Actually</span>, I have an old cat <span>named</span> <span>Mittens.<br/></span> 
🎧 He <span>mostly</span> <span>tolerates</span> <span>Max</span>, but he would never <span>chase</span> a <span>frisbee!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Cats</span> are always so <span>dignified.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe <span>Mittens</span> would like a <span>nap</span> in the sun <span>while</span> we play <span>fetch?<br/></span> 
🎧 Probably a good <span>idea.<br/></span> 
🎧 Listen, it was nice <span>meeting</span> you and <span>Charlie.<br/></span> 
🎧 Hey <span>Ethan</span>! Small <span>world</span>, <span>seeing</span> you <span>here.<br/></span> 
🎧 Hey <span>Ava</span>! Yeah, <span>crazy</span> <span>coincidence.<br/></span> 
🎧 Just <span>grabbing</span> a <span>coffee</span> before my next class. What about <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 Same <span>here.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Studying</span> for that <span>literature</span> <span>test</span> <span>tomorrow?<br/></span> 
🎧 Those <span>poems</span> are <span>confusing!<br/></span> 
🎧 You can say that <span>again.<br/></span> 
🎧 You can say that again. But I did find <span>"Ode</span> to a <span>Nightingale"</span> kind of <span>beautiful.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Nature</span> and all <span>that.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Interesting</span>! What is your <span>favorite</span> <span>movie?<br/></span> 
🎧 Sometimes <span>movies</span> can <span>explain</span> things <span>books</span> <span>can't.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, that's a tough <span>one.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe <span>"Spirited</span> <span>Away"?<br/></span> 
🎧 It's an <span>animated</span> <span>movie</span>, but the <span>story</span> about <span>growing</span> up is <span>amazing.<br/></span> 
🎧 Have you <span>seen</span> <span>it?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Actually</span>, no! But it sounds <span>interesting.<br/></span> 
🎧 Would you want to <span>watch</span> it with me <span>sometime?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'd love <span>that.<br/></span> 
🎧 We could <span>grab</span> <span>coffee</span> and <span>popcorn</span>, make a <span>whole</span> <span>night</span> of <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Excuse</span> me, is this <span>seat</span> <span>taken?<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, no, not at all! Please, take a <span>seat.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks. <span>Busy</span> <span>day?<br/></span> 
🎧 Just <span>finishing</span> up some work for class. <span>You?<br/></span> 
🎧 Same here. <span>Heading</span> to a <span>lecture</span> on <span>ancient</span> <span>Egypt.<br/></span> 
🎧 I love <span>history.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Cool!<br/></span> 
🎧 I just <span>finished</span> <span>reading</span> a book about <span>Cleopatra.<br/></span> 
🎧 She was really <span>interesting.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you enjoy <span>reading</span> <span>books</span> <span>often?<br/></span> 
🎧 Not many people I know do these <span>days.<br/></span> 
🎧 Absolutely! There's just something about getting <span>lost</span> in a good <span>story.<br/></span> 
🎧 What about <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 Any <span>favorite</span> <span>genres?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, I do like a good <span>mystery</span> <span>novel</span> every now and <span>then.<br/></span> 
🎧 Something to keep me <span>guessing.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Mysteries</span> are <span>fun!<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe we could <span>swap</span> <span>recommendations</span> <span>sometime?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'd like <span>that!<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, no. I'm so <span>sorry!<br/></span> 
🎧 Let me help you <span>pick</span> those <span>up.<br/></span> 
🎧 No <span>worries</span>, it <span>happens</span>! Thanks for the <span>help.<br/></span> 
🎧 Wow, <span>Led</span> <span>Zeppelin?<br/></span> 
🎧 Those <span>guys</span> are <span>legends.<br/></span> 
🎧 You a big <span>fan?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Absolutely!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>"Stairway</span> to <span>Heaven"</span> is one of my <span>favorite</span> <span>songs.<br/></span> 
🎧 What about <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 What kind of music do you <span>like?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Mostly</span> <span>electronic</span> <span>music.<br/></span> 
🎧 Anything with a good <span>beat.<br/></span> 
🎧 This new <span>remix</span> <span>album</span> by <span>DJ</span> <span>Kai</span> is <span>great.<br/></span> 
🎧 Have you <span>heard</span> <span>it?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, not yet. I usually <span>stick</span> to <span>classic</span> <span>rock</span> and some <span>indie</span> <span>stuff.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe we could <span>trade</span> some <span>suggestions</span> <span>sometime?<br/></span> 
🎧 I could <span>introduce</span> you to some <span>electronic</span> music that might <span>surprise</span> <span>you.<br/></span> 
🎧 OK! Maybe we can <span>grab</span> <span>coffee</span> sometime and <span>swap</span> <span>playlists?<br/></span> 
🎧 Sounds like a <span>deal</span>! By the way, I'm <span>Paule</span>. And you <span>are?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm <span>Jennie</span>. Nice to <span>meet</span> you, <span>Paule.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Phew</span>, that <span>grammar</span> <span>explanation</span> was <span>confusing!<br/></span> 
🎧 Tell me about <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Past</span> <span>perfect</span> <span>continuous</span> <span>tense?<br/></span> 
🎧 Sounds like a <span>tongue</span> <span>twister.<br/></span> 
🎧 Right? At <span>least</span> the <span>upcoming</span> <span>activity</span> looks <span>fun.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>True</span>, <span>writing</span> a <span>fake</span> <span>movie</span> <span>review.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>wonder</span> what kind of <span>movie</span> we can <span>choose.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, maybe something <span>spooky?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Haunted</span> house <span>comedy?<br/></span> 
🎧 Sounds <span>interesting</span>, but I wouldn't <span>mind</span> doing something with more <span>action.<br/></span> 
🎧 Like a <span>superhero</span> <span>movie.<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, I'm not a <span>huge</span> fan of <span>superhero</span> <span>movies.<br/></span> 
🎧 They all <span>seem</span> kind of the <span>same.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Fair</span> enough. What do you like to <span>watch</span> in your free <span>time?<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe we can get some <span>inspiration.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>mostly</span> <span>watch</span> <span>documentaries</span> or <span>historical</span> <span>dramas.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Learning</span> about different <span>cultures</span> and time <span>periods</span> is <span>fascinating.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Documentaries</span>, <span>huh?<br/></span> 
🎧 Not really my thing, but I can see the <span>appeal.<br/></span> 
🎧 What do you do in your free time <span>besides</span> <span>watching</span> <span>movies?<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, I enjoy <span>reading</span> and going for <span>walks.<br/></span> 
🎧 Sometimes I even try to <span>write</span> short <span>stories</span> <span>myself.<br/></span> 
🎧 Wow, that's <span>cool</span>! <span>Writing</span> can be <span>tough.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe you can share one of your <span>stories</span> with me <span>sometime.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe! But first, let's focus on this <span>crazy</span> <span>grammar</span> <span>activity.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Agreed.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Finally</span>! That <span>history</span> <span>lecture</span> <span>felt</span> like <span>forever.<br/></span> 
🎧 Couldn't agree <span>more!<br/></span> 
🎧 What are you up to this <span>afternoon</span>, <span>Joe?<br/></span> 
🎧 Probably just <span>chilling</span> at home, <span>catching</span> up on some <span>homework.<br/></span> 
🎧 What about you? Any <span>exciting</span> <span>plans?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Actually</span>, yeah! I'm <span>meeting</span> some friends for a game of <span>volleyball</span> down at the <span>beach.<br/></span> 
🎧 Want to <span>join?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Volleyball</span>, <span>huh</span>? Sounds <span>fun!<br/></span> 
🎧 I used to play a bit in high school, but I'm not sure I'm exactly <span>beach-ready.<br/></span> 
🎧 Come on, don't be a <span>scaredy-cat!<br/></span> 
🎧 It's all about having fun, not <span>winning</span> a <span>championship.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Besides</span>, the <span>sand</span> is <span>soft</span> and the <span>water's</span> <span>amazing</span> if you get too <span>hot.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, you make a good <span>point.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you play any <span>sports</span> <span>regularly</span>, or is this just a <span>casual</span> <span>thing?<br/></span> 
🎧 I try to play <span>volleyball</span> <span>whenever</span> I <span>can.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's a great <span>workout</span>, and being outside is always <span>nice.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you play any <span>sports?<br/></span> 
🎧 I used to play <span>basketball</span> a lot, but these <span>days</span> it's <span>mostly</span> just <span>pick-up</span> <span>games</span> with <span>friends.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe if you ever need <span>someone</span> on your <span>volleyball</span> <span>team</span>, I could give it a <span>shot.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Consider</span> it done! The more the <span>merrier</span>, <span>right?<br/></span> 
🎧 So, are you in for some <span>beach</span> fun or <span>not?<br/></span> 
🎧 Alright, you <span>convinced</span> <span>me.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Perfect</span>! See you down there in a bit, <span>Joe!<br/>
