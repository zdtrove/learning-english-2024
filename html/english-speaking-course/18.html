<h2>I Can <span>Understand</span> English, But I <span>Can't</span> Speak</h2>

🎧 Everyone! This is <span>Laura</span>, our new <span>team</span> <span>member</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Laura</span>, please <span>introduce</span> yourself!<br/>
🎧 Hello, everyone.<br/>
🎧 My name is <span>Laura</span>.<br/>
🎧 I am new here.<br/>
🎧 Nice to meet you all.<br/>
🎧 <span>Welcome</span>, <span>Laura</span>!<br/>
🎧 We are very happy you are here.<br/>
🎧 Please tell us about yourself.<br/>
🎧 Okay, <span>um...I</span> am from <span>Spain</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>moved</span> here last month.<br/>
🎧 My English is not very good.<br/>
🎧 Please be <span>patient</span> with me.<br/>
🎧 No <span>problem</span> <span>Laura</span>!<br/>
🎧 We will help you with your English.<br/>
🎧 Yes. Don't <span>worry</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's okay.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 I feel a little <span>nervous</span> today.<br/>
🎧 This is my first day.<br/>
🎧 No need to be <span>nervous</span>!<br/>
🎧 We are one <span>team</span> here.<br/>
🎧 Let me <span>introduce</span> everyone.<br/>
🎧 Okay <span>team</span>, let's <span>begin</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Laura</span>, you have the first <span>presentation</span> today.<br/>
🎧 Can you share the <span>project</span> <span>details</span> with us?<br/>
🎧 <span>Y-yes</span>, okay.<br/>
🎧 <span>Um</span>, this <span>project</span> is <span>for...the</span> <span>new...um</span>...<br/>
🎧 I'm sorry, I am having <span>trouble</span> <span>expressing</span>...<br/>
🎧 It's okay <span>Laura</span>, take your time.<br/>
🎧 Okay, I will try <span>again</span>...<br/>
🎧 <span>Um</span>, this <span>project</span> is <span>for...the</span> <span>new...um...customer</span>?<br/>
🎧 I think you mean <span>"client"</span>, <span>Laura</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh yes, <span>client</span>. This <span>project</span> is for new <span>client</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>want...they</span> want us to <span>make...a</span> <span>website</span>?<br/>
🎧 A <span>website</span> for them, yes. What else can you tell us?<br/>
🎧 Okay, <span>um</span>, the <span>website</span> must <span>have</span>...<br/>
🎧 it <span>must</span>... It must have <span>shopping...ability</span>?<br/>
🎧 You mean <span>"online</span> <span>shopping</span> <span>cart"</span>, right?<br/>
🎧 Yes, online <span>shopping</span> <span>cart</span>. And <span>also</span>...<br/>
🎧 It must <span>have...easy</span> <span>navigation</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, that's not <span>right</span>...<br/>
🎧 I think you mean <span>"user-friendly</span> <span>navigation"</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, <span>user-friendly</span>. I'm sorry.<br/>
🎧 It's okay, just take a <span>breath</span>. You're doing your best.<br/>
🎧 Okay, let me try <span>again</span>...<br/>
🎧 Thank you for trying <span>Laura<br/></span>
🎧 but your English needs more <span>practice</span>.<br/>
🎧 You made many <span>mistakes</span> today.<br/>
🎧 Yes, you're right. I will work <span>harder</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why don't we get you an English <span>tutor</span>?<br/>
🎧 With some <span>lessons</span>, the <span>presentations</span> will get <span>easier</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes sir!<br/>
🎧 Hey <span>Laura</span>, don't be too <span>upset</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Public</span> <span>speaking</span> in a new <span>language</span> is really <span>hard</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I made so many <span>mistakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>manager</span> is right, my English needs a lot of work.<br/>
🎧 I <span>understand</span> how you feel.<br/>
🎧 When I first <span>joined</span> this <span>company</span>, my English was <span>terrible</span> too.<br/>
🎧 Really? But you speak so well now!<br/>
🎧 Yes, but it took a lot of <span>practice</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was once in your <span>position</span>.<br/>
🎧 What did you do to <span>improve</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I <span>started</span> taking <span>evening</span> English <span>classes</span>.<br/>
🎧 And I <span>practiced</span> as much as <span>possible</span> by <span>putting</span> myself <span>in<br/></span>
🎧 <span>situations</span> to use English.<br/>
🎧 Like what <span>situations</span>?<br/>
🎧 Like going to <span>coffee</span> <span>shops</span> or <span>stores</span> and <span>making</span> myself <span>order</span> in <span>English<br/></span>
🎧 Even though it was <span>scary</span> at first.<br/>
🎧 Or watching English <span>TV</span> <span>shows</span> and <span>movies</span>.<br/>
🎧 Those are good <span>ideas</span>! I should try that.<br/>
🎧 And you know what really <span>helped</span> me?<br/>
🎧 <span>Finding</span> a <span>partner</span> to <span>practice</span> <span>conversation</span> with.<br/>
🎧 We can do that together if you want!<br/>
🎧 We can meet a few <span>times</span> a week, get a <span>snack</span>, and just <span>chat</span> in English.<br/>
🎧 I'll go <span>slowly</span> and <span>correct<br/></span>
🎧 you when <span>needed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you, <span>Helen</span>!<br/>
🎧 Okay, let's start with some <span>basic</span> <span>conversations</span>.<br/>
🎧 You <span>order</span> for us.<br/>
🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 Can I get a small <span>coffee</span>, please?<br/>
🎧 And for you, <span>Laura</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Um</span>... I would <span>like</span>... a tea?<br/>
🎧 No, no.<br/>
🎧 One <span>green</span> tea, please.<br/>
🎧 Great <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 You <span>remembered</span> to say <span>"one"</span> <span>instead</span> of <span>"a"</span> for the tea.<br/>
🎧 Thanks! Oh, and can I also get a <span>muffin</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, <span>nicely</span> done. What kind of <span>muffin</span> would you like?<br/>
🎧 I want... the <span>blueberry</span> <span>muffin</span>, please.<br/>
🎧 <span>Describe</span> one of the <span>trees</span> or <span>flowers<br/></span>
🎧 you see in as much <span>detail</span> as you can.<br/>
🎧 <span>Okay</span>...<br/>
🎧 I see a <span>tree</span> with a very <span>tall</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>thick</span> <span>trunk</span>.<br/>
🎧 Its leaves are <span>green</span> <span>and</span>... <span>oval-shaped</span>?<br/>
🎧 With a <span>pointed</span> tip.<br/>
🎧 Good, good. What else?<br/>
🎧 Some of the leaves <span>have</span>... <span>yellow</span> or <span>orange</span> <span>edges</span>?<br/>
🎧 Is that <span>normal</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes. That's perfect.<br/>
🎧 Those are the <span>fall</span> <span>colors</span> just <span>starting</span> to change.<br/>
🎧 <span>Excuse</span> me.<br/>
🎧 How much are these <span>apples</span>?<br/>
🎧 Two <span>dollars</span> a <span>pound</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ah ok, I would <span>like...four</span> <span>apples</span> please.<br/>
🎧 No, wait, I do not know the <span>weight</span>.<br/>
🎧 One <span>pound</span> of <span>apples</span>, please.<br/>
🎧 Here you go!<br/>
🎧 <span>Fantastic</span>! You <span>corrected</span> yourself <span>perfectly</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Speaking</span> more <span>slowly</span> is <span>helping</span> me catch my own <span>mistakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 All right, <span>team</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's time for the <span>monthly</span> <span>presentations</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Laura</span>, you're up first this time.<br/>
🎧 Can you give us an <span>update</span> on the <span>website</span> <span>project</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, of course. I'm ready.<br/>
🎧 For the new <span>website</span> <span>project</span> with our top <span>client</span>,<br/>
🎧 We have made good <span>progress</span>.<br/>
🎧 First, the <span>design</span> <span>team</span> <span>created</span> <span>mockups<br/></span>
🎧 for the home <span>page</span> and other <span>main</span> <span>pages</span>.<br/>
🎧 These <span>mock-ups</span> <span>follow</span> the <span>client's</span> <span>branding</span> <span>colors</span> and <span>style</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Laura's</span> English has really <span>improved</span>.<br/>
🎧 She sounds so much better.<br/>
🎧 Next, the <span>development</span> <span>team</span> <span>started</span> <span>building</span> the <span>website</span> <span>framework</span>.<br/>
🎧 They used <span>coding</span> to add the <span>main<br/></span>
🎧 <span>navigation</span> <span>menus</span> and <span>layout</span> <span>structure</span>.<br/>
🎧 As you can see here, the <span>shopping</span> <span>cart</span> <span>feature</span> is now working.<br/>
🎧 <span>Users</span> can add <span>items</span>, <span>update</span> <span>quantities</span>, and <span>proceed</span> to <span>checkout</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great work <span>explaining</span> that, <span>Laura</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>client</span> will be <span>impressed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 <span>Finally</span>, some other key <span>features</span> are the live <span>chat</span> box for <span>customer</span> <span>support</span>,<br/>
🎧 and the <span>user</span> <span>account</span> <span>login</span> <span>area</span>.<br/>
🎧 And that's where we're at <span>currently</span>. Any other <span>questions</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Excellent</span> <span>presentation</span>, <span>Laura</span>.<br/>
🎧 Your English <span>skills<br/></span>
🎧 have come such a long way.<br/>
🎧 Thanks to lots of <span>practice...and</span> help from <span>Helen</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, keep up the great work, both of you!<br/>
🎧 <span>Helen</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Helen</span>! Thank you so much for everything.<br/>
🎧 <span>Laura</span>, your <span>presentation</span> was <span>fantastic</span>!<br/>
🎧 I'm so <span>proud</span> of you.<br/>
🎧 I couldn't have done it without your <span>tips</span> and <span>practice</span> <span>sessions</span>.<br/>
🎧 You really <span>helped</span> me <span>improve</span> my English.<br/>
🎧 Of course, I was happy to help.<br/>
🎧 but you put in all the <span>hard</span> <span>work<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>effort</span> yourself.<br/>
🎧 Your advice about watching <span>shows</span> and <span>movies</span> in English was great too.<br/>
🎧 It <span>helped</span> me with <span>vocabulary<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>conversational</span> <span>phrases</span>.<br/>
🎧 Keep doing that and your <span>English<br/></span>
🎧 will just get better and better over time.<br/>
🎧 I will.<br/>
🎧 This is only the <span>beginning</span> for me.<br/>
🎧 Thank you, <span>Helen</span>.<br/>
🎧 You're a <span>wonderful</span> <span>friend<br/></span>
🎧 and I <span>truly</span> <span>appreciate</span> your <span>support</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Learning</span> a <span>language</span> is never easy,<br/>
🎧 <span>especially</span> when it's not your <span>mother</span> <span>tongue</span>.<br/>
🎧 And English, a <span>language</span> full of <span>quirks</span>,<br/>
🎧 is a <span>challenge</span> with lots of <span>learners</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know it's an <span>uphill</span> <span>task</span> to learn <span>English<br/></span>
🎧 and as an English <span>learner</span>, I agree.<br/>
🎧 It takes time and <span>effort</span>.<br/>
🎧 There were <span>times</span> that I also thought of <span>giving</span> up.<br/>
🎧 I <span>felt</span> <span>helpless</span> and <span>desperate</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't know what I should do.<br/>
🎧 Everything <span>seemed</span> to be <span>against</span> me.<br/>
🎧 It was a <span>hard</span> time.<br/>
🎧 But then things <span>changed</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>talked</span> with my friends and they <span>reminded</span> me of what made me start all of this.<br/>
🎧 And what <span>motivates</span> me.<br/>
🎧 I <span>pull</span> myself together and get back to the right <span>track</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Learning</span> English is a <span>journey</span> without an <span>ending</span>.<br/>
🎧 You always learn and <span>improve</span> over time.<br/>
🎧 The thing is, you gotta set a <span>clear</span> <span>goal</span> and enjoy what you're doing.<br/>
🎧 And I'm here to share with you my <span>tips</span>.<br/>
🎧 First, you need to <span>figure</span> <span>out<br/></span>
🎧 why you want to learn English.<br/>
🎧 What is your <span>true</span> <span>purpose</span> for this?<br/>
🎧 You want a <span>scholarship<br/></span>
🎧 or you need to <span>apply</span> for your <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Seeking</span> a new <span>opportunity</span>.<br/>
🎧 Or it can <span>simply</span> be to <span>communicate</span> with people around the <span>world</span>, to make new friends.<br/>
🎧 The <span>reason</span> for this can be <span>diverse</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it should be <span>clear</span>.<br/>
🎧 I need you to <span>write</span> it down on the <span>paper</span>.<br/>
🎧 Always <span>remind</span> yourself of that.<br/>
🎧 Once you <span>identify</span> your <span>goal</span>, let it be on the top of your <span>priority</span> <span>list</span>.<br/>
🎧 Make it <span>engraved</span> on your <span>mind</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Expose</span> yourself to it on a <span>daily</span> <span>basis</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Stick</span> them somewhere you see every day.<br/>
🎧 On the <span>door</span>, your <span>desk</span>, on the <span>wall</span>, <span>etc.</span>.<br/>
🎧 A <span>goal</span> without a plan is just a wish.<br/>
🎧 When you've got your own <span>goal</span>,<br/>
🎧 put it into <span>action</span>.<br/>
🎧 Make time for it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Spend</span> a <span>certain</span> <span>period</span> of <span>time<br/></span>
🎧 in one day for your <span>learning</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, you can <span>spend</span> <span>2</span> hours <span>per</span> day <span>practicing</span> <span>speaking</span> English.<br/>
🎧 Or just <span>10</span> to <span>15</span> <span>minutes</span> to <span>memorize</span> new <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 And the important thing is, it doesn't <span>matter</span> how long.<br/>
🎧 What <span>matters</span> is how often you do it.<br/>
🎧 That's the <span>difference</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can <span>save</span> less time for your <span>learning</span>,<br/>
🎧 but do it on the <span>regular</span>.<br/>
🎧 It can be every day, <span>three</span> <span>times</span> <span>per</span> week.<br/>
🎧 For <span>instance</span>,<br/>
🎧 but it should be <span>consistent</span>.<br/>
🎧 You get it?<br/>
🎧 When you have time for <span>learning</span>,<br/>
🎧 think of a <span>method</span> which can help you learn at your best.<br/>
🎧 To me, I try to let myself see, listen and <span>expose</span> myself to English as much as <span>possible</span>.<br/>
🎧 Set your phone <span>language</span> to English.<br/>
🎧 This is an <span>interesting</span> and <span>effective</span> way to learn English,<br/>
🎧 because the phone is what I always have with me.<br/>
🎧 And it <span>works</span> because I am already <span>familiar<br/></span>
🎧 with all the <span>buttons</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>functions</span>, and all the <span>apps</span>.<br/>
🎧 But this is not really <span>recommended</span> for <span>beginners</span>.<br/>
🎧 They may get <span>confused</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Instead</span> of <span>making</span> things <span>easier</span> to learn,<br/>
🎧 they get <span>frustrated</span> and <span>discouraged</span>.<br/>
🎧 So my <span>method</span> may <span>suit</span> some, but it may not be the right one for <span>others</span>.<br/>
🎧 Be <span>mindful</span>. Ask yourself what <span>motivates</span> you the most.<br/>
🎧 And what can help you learn the most <span>effectively</span>,<br/>
🎧 but not make you <span>bored</span> and give up at the same time.<br/>
🎧 If you haven't <span>found</span> anything which can help you yet, don't <span>worry</span>.<br/>
🎧 It also took me <span>months</span>, even years to try and <span>figure</span> out what <span>suits</span> me best.<br/>
🎧 And <span>remember</span>, <span>learning</span> English takes time.<br/>
🎧 You will always have to keep <span>learning<br/></span>
🎧 no <span>matter</span> what <span>level</span> you are right now.<br/>
🎧 Even after years of <span>practicing</span> and trying, I still tell myself to keep going.<br/>
🎧 and never give up at any <span>cost</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can take things <span>slow</span>, just don't let things go.<br/>
🎧 Back in the time when I just <span>began</span> to <span>study</span> English.<br/>
🎧 I couldn't speak a <span>word</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>spent</span> <span>months</span> at my <span>desk</span> <span>cramming</span> and trying to learn by <span>heart</span> all the new <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 I wanted to learn as much as I could at that time.<br/>
🎧 I thought it would be <span>easier</span> if I <span>shorten<br/></span>
🎧 the time of <span>learning</span> by <span>learning</span> more.<br/>
🎧 But I was wrong.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>overwhelmed</span> and got off <span>track</span>.<br/>
🎧 That was the time I <span>realized</span> that I <span>needed</span> to change.<br/>
🎧 I would not <span>rush</span> <span>anymore</span> and focus on what's more <span>effective</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>worked</span> and I made <span>clear</span> <span>improvements</span>.<br/>
🎧 So take small <span>steps</span> and enjoy the <span>journey</span>.<br/>
🎧 What you should do is to let your <span>mind</span> be <span>stress</span> free.<br/>
🎧 That's when you can learn the most.<br/>
🎧 If you feel things are getting too much, <span>slow</span> down.<br/>
🎧 <span>Putting</span> too much <span>pressure</span> on <span>yourself<br/></span>
🎧 will not <span>benefit</span> you at all.<br/>
🎧 I know sometimes <span>pressure</span> might come in <span>useful</span>.<br/>
🎧 It makes people focus and <span>encourages</span> them to <span>perform</span> better.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, <span>excessive</span> <span>levels</span> of <span>pressure</span> can <span>result</span> in <span>negative</span> <span>outcomes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Those are <span>anxiety</span>, <span>nervousness</span>, or even <span>depression</span>.<br/>
🎧 One more thing, your <span>journey</span> will be great when you have <span>company</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Self-learning</span> is important,<br/>
🎧 But having <span>supportive</span> friends who join with you is also perfect for <span>learning</span>.<br/>
🎧 You will be <span>surprised</span> by how much you can <span>achieve</span> together.<br/>
🎧 <span>Learning</span> in <span>pairs</span>, or <span>groups</span> can also help you to <span>remember</span> things better, and <span>longer</span> as well.<br/>
🎧 Also, when taking <span>part</span> in a <span>group</span> of <span>learners</span>,<br/>
🎧 they help each other to <span>refine</span> their <span>understanding<br/></span>
🎧 or <span>correct</span> <span>mistakes</span> that they can't see by <span>themselves</span>.<br/>
🎧 Many <span>hands</span> make <span>light</span> work.<br/>
🎧 If you have any <span>confusion</span>, ask your friends who's <span>learning</span> with <span>you<br/></span>
🎧 or the <span>internet</span> can be a great idea.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>tons</span> of <span>learning</span> <span>websites</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>platforms</span> for English <span>learners</span> on the <span>Internet</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can ask or answer <span>questions</span> from <span>someone</span> who is <span>thousands</span> <span>miles</span> away from you.<br/>
🎧 <span>It's</span> getting <span>easier</span> and <span>easier</span> <span>nowadays</span> to get help for something.<br/>
🎧 <span>Especially</span> when <span>learning</span> English <span>becomes</span> something <span>popular</span> and <span>essential</span>.<br/>
🎧 so you can <span>consider</span> looking for a <span>company<br/></span>
🎧 when <span>learning</span> English.<br/>
🎧 <span>It's</span> like having <span>extra</span> <span>support</span>, <span>motivation</span> and better <span>retention</span> as well.<br/>
🎧 So why not?<br/>
🎧 So <span>learning</span> English is not <span>rocket</span> <span>science</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>It's</span> also not a <span>piece</span> of <span>cake</span>.<br/>
🎧 But if I can do this, so will you.<br/>
🎧 Do not let anything <span>stop</span> you.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>hundreds</span>, <span>thousands</span> of people trying to learn English everyday,<br/>
🎧 but not everyone can actually <span>manage</span> to do it.<br/>
🎧 Having a <span>strong</span> <span>motivation</span> and the right <span>method</span>, is the <span>base</span> for you to start.<br/>
🎧 I hope you will make it.<br/>
