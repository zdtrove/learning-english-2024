<h2>Starting the day</h2>

🎧 <span>Oh</span> good morning, <span>Tom!<br/></span> 
🎧 How are you <span>today?<br/></span> 
🎧 Did you get enough <span>sleep</span> last <span>night?<br/></span> 
🎧 I feel like I <span>barely</span> <span>slept</span> at <span>all.<br/></span> 
🎧 Morning, <span>Alice!<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm <span>okay</span>, I <span>guess.<br/></span> 
🎧 But to be <span>honest</span>, I <span>stayed</span> up a bit too <span>late</span> <span>watching</span> that new <span>series</span> on <span>TV.<br/></span> 
🎧 You know how it <span>goes.<br/></span> 
🎧 You say, <span>“Just</span> one more <span>episode,”</span> and then <span>suddenly</span> it's <span>1</span> <span>AM.<br/></span> 
🎧 How about <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span>, I know that feeling all too <span>well.<br/></span> 
🎧 I was up <span>late</span> to trying to <span>finish</span> a book I was <span>reading.<br/></span> 
🎧 It was so good that I couldn't put it <span>down.<br/></span> 
🎧 But now I'm definitely feeling <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 I need a <span>strong</span> <span>coffee</span> to <span>wake</span> me <span>up.<br/></span> 
🎧 Me <span>too!<br/></span> 
🎧 A good cup of <span>coffee</span> sounds like the <span>perfect</span> way to start the <span>day.<br/></span> 
🎧 Let's do this and make it a <span>productive</span> <span>day.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2>Team Meetings</h2>

🎧 Good morning, <span>everyone.<br/></span> 
🎧 I hope you're all <span>ready</span> for <span>today's</span> <span>meeting.<br/></span> 
🎧 Let's start by going over the <span>progress</span> on our <span>current</span> <span>projects.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Alice</span>, would you like to <span>begin?<br/></span> 
🎧 Of course, <span>Mr</span>. <span>Smith.<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>research</span> <span>phase</span> is <span>complete</span>, and <span>we've</span> <span>started</span> the <span>development</span> <span>stage.<br/></span> 
🎧 We did <span>face</span> a <span>slight</span> <span>delay</span> <span>due</span> to some <span>unexpected</span> <span>challenges</span> with the <span>data,<br/></span> 
🎧 but we <span>managed</span> to <span>resolve</span> them <span>quickly.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Actually</span>, <span>Alice</span>, I'm not sure I agree with <span>that.<br/></span> 
🎧 I think the <span>delay</span> was <span>longer</span> than you're <span>suggesting,<br/></span> 
🎧 and it's going to <span>push</span> us behind <span>schedule</span> if we don't <span>address</span> it <span>properly.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>understand</span> your <span>concern</span>, <span>Jimmy,<br/></span> 
🎧 but I've <span>already</span> made changes to <span>handle</span> the <span>delay.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm sure we can still <span>meet</span> our <span>deadlines.<br/></span> 
🎧 But <span>Alice</span>, we need to be <span>realistic</span> about what we can <span>achieve.<br/></span> 
🎧 Alright, I see both of your <span>points.<br/></span> 
🎧 Let's go over the <span>timeline</span> and see what changes we can make to <span>stay</span> on <span>track.<br/></span> 
🎧 We'll <span>solve</span> any <span>issues</span> to make sure we <span>deliver</span> great <span>results</span> for our <span>clients.<br/></span> 
🎧 That makes <span>sense</span>, <span>Mr</span>. <span>Smith.<br/></span> 
🎧 I didn't mean to <span>ignore</span> the <span>issue</span>. I just <span>wanted</span> to <span>stay</span> <span>positive.<br/></span> 
🎧 I get that, <span>Alice.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2>Lunch Break</h2>

🎧 Hi <span>Alice</span>, hi <span>Tom</span>! <span>Mind</span> if I join you for lunch <span>today?<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>brought</span> my lunch from home, but it's always <span>nicer</span> to eat with <span>company.<br/></span> 
🎧 Sure, <span>Sarah</span>. I could use a <span>break</span> after that <span>meeting.<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, let's take a <span>breather.<br/></span> 
🎧 That <span>meeting</span> was a bit <span>intense</span>, <span>huh?<br/></span> 
🎧 But, hey, we're all on the same <span>team</span>, <span>right?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span> no, what <span>happened</span> in the <span>meeting?<br/></span> 
🎧 You both look like you can use some <span>comfort</span> <span>food.<br/></span> 
🎧 Just a little <span>disagreement</span> about our <span>project</span> <span>timeline.<br/></span> 
🎧 I know <span>Tom</span> was just trying to be <span>realistic,<br/></span> 
🎧 but it <span>felt</span> like he was <span>challenging</span> everything I <span>said.<br/></span> 
🎧 I didn't mean to come off that way, <span>Alice.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>respect</span> your work a <span>lot.<br/></span> 
🎧 I just think we need to be <span>careful</span> with our <span>deadlines.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's good for us, <span>right?<br/></span> 
🎧 You're right. I don't want a small <span>disagreement</span> to <span>spoil</span> our <span>day.<br/></span> 
🎧 We're all <span>putting</span> in a lot of <span>effort</span> and I <span>appreciate</span> your <span>feedback</span>, <span>Tom.<br/></span> 
🎧 Let's take a <span>break</span>, enjoy lunch, and come back to the <span>project</span> with a <span>fresh</span> <span>perspective.<br/></span> 
🎧 Agreed. I'm glad we <span>talked</span> it <span>out.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2>Client Calls</h2>

🎧 <span>Hello</span>, this is <span>Alice</span> from <span>Brand</span> New <span>Company.<br/></span> 
🎧 How can I help you <span>today?<br/></span>

🎧 <span>Certainly</span>! Let me <span>pull</span> up the <span>information.<br/></span> 
🎧 What <span>specific</span> <span>details</span> would you like to go <span>over?<br/></span> 
🎧 I want to <span>confirm</span> the <span>timeline</span> and the <span>main</span> <span>tasks.<br/></span> 
🎧 We have an <span>eight-week</span> <span>schedule,<br/></span> 
🎧 with the first <span>task</span> <span>due</span> in two <span>weeks.<br/></span> 
🎧 Does that work for <span>you?<br/></span>

🎧 Me <span>too.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2>Reporting to the Manager</h2>

🎧 Here are your <span>documents</span>, <span>sir.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Tom</span>, do you have a <span>moment</span> to <span>discuss</span> your <span>report?<br/></span> 
🎧 Of course, <span>Mr</span>. <span>Smith.<br/></span> 
🎧 Here is the <span>latest</span> <span>update.<br/></span> 
🎧 I see you've made great <span>progress.<br/></span> 
🎧 Just a few more <span>details</span> to <span>add.<br/></span> 
🎧 Can you <span>include</span> the <span>client</span> <span>feedback</span> in the next <span>report?<br/></span> 
🎧 Sure. I'll add that right <span>away.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thank you. <span>Tom</span>. Keep up the good <span>work.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thank you, <span>Mr</span>. <span>Smith.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll <span>send</span> you the <span>revised</span> <span>report</span> by the end of the <span>day.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Perfect</span>. Let me know if you need any <span>help.<br/></span> 
🎧 Sure, <span>Mr</span>. <span>Smith.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2>Leaving the Office</h2>

🎧 <span>Alice</span>, are you <span>heading</span> out <span>now?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, I am. It's been a long <span>day.<br/></span> 
🎧 Me too. <span>Ready</span> to go home and <span>relax.<br/></span> 
🎧 I have to go to the <span>grocery</span> <span>store</span> to buy some things for <span>dinner.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's <span>tiring.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span>, if that's the case, it'll take you at <span>least</span> two <span>hours</span> to <span>finish</span> <span>dinner.<br/></span> 
🎧 Why don't we go out for <span>dinner?<br/></span> 
🎧 Just for today. Because <span>we've</span> <span>worked</span> <span>hard</span> all day <span>long.<br/></span> 
🎧 That sounds <span>good.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>agree.<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>Korean</span> <span>restaurant</span> near my house is <span>famous.<br/></span> 
🎧 You should definitely try it <span>once.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Deal</span>. Let's <span>fill</span> our <span>empty</span> <span>stomachs.<br/></span> 
🎧 Go go <span>go!<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2>Waking Up</h2>

🎧 <span>Ugh</span>, is it morning <span>already?<br/></span> 
🎧 I feel like I just went to <span>bed.<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, it's <span>morning.<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>alarm's</span> been going off for a <span>while</span> <span>now.<br/></span> 
🎧 We should probably get <span>up.<br/></span> 
🎧 Another <span>busy</span> day <span>ahead.<br/></span> 
🎧 I know, I know. But <span>five</span> more <span>minutes</span> wouldn't <span>hurt</span>, <span>right?<br/></span> 
🎧 So <span>cozy</span> <span>here.<br/></span> 
🎧 You always say that, and then we end up <span>rushing.<br/></span> 
🎧 But I get <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Mornings</span> are <span>tough.<br/></span> 
🎧 Let's make a <span>deal</span>, <span>five</span> more <span>minutes</span>, and then we'll start the <span>day.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Deal.<br/></span> 
🎧 You know, I've been thinking about <span>changing</span> our morning <span>routine.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe <span>adding</span> some <span>stretches</span> or a <span>quick</span> <span>workout.<br/></span> 
🎧 It might help us <span>wake</span> up <span>better.<br/></span> 
🎧 That's not a bad <span>idea.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2>Morning Exercise</h2>

🎧 Alright, so I've <span>found</span> a <span>short</span> morning <span>workout</span> <span>routine</span> <span>online.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's only <span>15</span> <span>minutes</span>. It's <span>perfect</span> for <span>beginners</span> like <span>us.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Ready</span> to give it a <span>try?<br/></span> 
🎧 As <span>ready</span> as I'll ever <span>be.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm still <span>waking</span> up, but I think this could be good for <span>us.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Lead</span> the way, <span>Coach</span> <span>Emma!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Okay</span>, let's start with some <span>light</span> <span>stretches.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm not usually a morning person, but this <span>actually</span> <span>feels</span> <span>nice.<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, I can see why people do <span>this.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's like we're <span>shaking</span> off the <span>sleepiness.<br/></span> 
🎧 Exactly! Just something to get us <span>moving.<br/></span> 
🎧 Now, let's try some <span>jumping</span> <span>jacks,<br/></span> 
🎧 just a few to get our <span>heart</span> <span>rates</span> <span>up.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Jumping</span> <span>jacks</span>, <span>huh</span>? Alright, let's do <span>this.<br/></span> 
🎧 You know, this might be the first time I've done <span>jumping</span> <span>jacks</span> since <span>school.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Really?<br/></span> 
🎧 But it's kind of fun, <span>right?<br/></span> 
🎧 For <span>sure.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2>Breakfast</h2>

🎧 Morning <span>exercise</span> done, now it's time for <span>breakfast.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm <span>making</span> <span>pancakes</span> with <span>banana</span> and <span>honey!<br/></span> 
🎧 It's been a long time since I <span>cooked</span> this <span>dish.<br/></span> 
🎧 That sounds <span>fancy</span>! Do you need any <span>help?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, can you <span>mash</span> the <span>bananas?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll mix the <span>batter.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Pancakes</span> are a nice <span>change.<br/></span> 
🎧 We haven't had them in a <span>while.<br/></span> 
🎧 What made you think of <span>this?<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>wanted</span> something <span>comforting</span> and <span>sweet.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Plus</span>, it's <span>quick</span> and <span>easy.<br/></span> 
🎧 We can add some <span>fresh</span> <span>berries</span> on top <span>to.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll get the <span>berries</span> <span>ready.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span>, these are <span>turning</span> out <span>perfectly.<br/></span> 
🎧 I love the <span>smell</span> of <span>pancakes</span> <span>cooking.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's so <span>warm</span> and <span>inviting.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's the <span>perfect</span> way to start the <span>day.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2>Getting Ready for Work</h2>

🎧 What to <span>wear</span>, what to <span>wear…<br/></span> 
🎧 I've got a <span>meeting</span> today, <span>so...<br/></span> 
🎧 I should probably go with something a little bit more <span>formal.<br/></span> 
🎧 You always look great, <span>Emma.<br/></span> 
🎧 But yeah, a <span>meeting</span> <span>calls</span> for the <span>power</span> <span>outfit.<br/></span> 
🎧 You want to make a good <span>impression?<br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks, <span>James.<br/></span> 
🎧 I think I'll go with the <span>blue</span> <span>blouse</span> and <span>black</span> <span>pants.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's <span>professional</span>, but still <span>comfortable.<br/></span> 
🎧 Good <span>choice.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Comfort</span> is key, <span>especially</span> when you're going to be <span>stuck</span> in <span>meetings</span> all <span>day.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm going with my <span>usual</span> <span>shirt</span> and <span>tie.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Nothing</span> <span>fancy.<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah. It's funny how getting <span>dressed</span> can set the <span>tone</span> for the day, <span>too<br/></span> 
🎧 When I <span>wear</span> something I feel good in, it <span>boosts</span> my <span>confidence.<br/></span> 
🎧 I get <span>that.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Ready</span> to <span>head</span> <span>out?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Ready!<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2>Lunch Break</h2>

🎧 Hey, <span>Emma</span>! How's your day <span>going?<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you want to <span>grab</span> lunch <span>together?<br/></span> 
🎧 Sure, <span>Emily!<br/></span> 
🎧 My <span>day's</span> been <span>pretty</span> <span>busy</span>, but I'm <span>surviving.<br/></span> 
🎧 How about <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 Same here. I've been <span>running</span> around all <span>morning.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm so glad it's lunch <span>time.<br/></span> 
🎧 I need a <span>break.<br/></span> 
🎧 What did you <span>bring?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span>, just a <span>simple</span> <span>salad</span> with <span>grilled</span> <span>chicken.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm trying to keep it <span>healthy</span>, <span>especially</span> after our morning <span>workout.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span>. That's <span>awesome!<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>brought</span> a <span>sandwich,<br/></span> 
🎧 but now I'm <span>wishing</span> I had something <span>healthier.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe I'll join you on the <span>salad</span> <span>train</span> <span>tomorrow.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span>, it's never too <span>late</span> to <span>start.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2>Evening Relaxation</h2>

🎧 <span>Finally</span> <span>home.<br/></span> 
🎧 What a <span>day!<br/></span> 
🎧 How about we do something <span>relaxing?<br/></span> 
🎧 What about a <span>board</span> <span>game?<br/></span> 
🎧 We haven't <span>played</span> one in <span>ages</span>, and it could be <span>fun.<br/></span> 
🎧 That's a great idea! Let's play <span>Settlers</span> of <span>Catan.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's been a <span>while</span>, and I'm feeling <span>competitive.<br/></span> 
🎧 You're on. I'll <span>grab</span> the <span>game.<br/></span> 
🎧 Just <span>remember</span>, I've <span>won</span> the last few <span>rounds,<br/></span> 
🎧 so don't get too <span>upset</span> if I win <span>again.<br/></span> 
🎧 We'll see about that! <span>Tonight</span> might be my <span>night.<br/></span> 
🎧 Alright, let the best <span>player</span> <span>win!<br/></span> 
🎧 And by that, I mean me, of <span>course.<br/></span> 
🎧 Let's <span>go!<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2>Preparing Dinner</h2>

🎧 So, what should we make for <span>dinner?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm thinking of something <span>quick</span> and <span>easy.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe <span>pasta?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Pasta</span> sounds <span>good.<br/></span> 
🎧 How about we make a <span>simple</span> <span>tomato</span> and <span>basil</span> <span>sauce?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>We've</span> got all the <span>ingredients.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Perfect.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll start <span>boiling</span> the water, and you can <span>chop</span> the <span>tomatoes.<br/></span> 
🎧 We make a <span>pretty</span> good <span>team</span> in the <span>kitchen</span>, don't <span>we?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Definitely.<br/></span> 
🎧 Cooking together is one of my <span>favorite</span> <span>parts</span> of the <span>day.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's like our own little <span>ritual.<br/></span> 
🎧 You're so <span>funny.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2>Bedtime Routine</h2>

🎧 I'm so <span>ready</span> for bed. How about <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Definitely.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm going to read a bit before <span>sleeping.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you want to join <span>me?<br/></span> 
🎧 Sure, just a few <span>pages</span> of my <span>mystery</span> <span>novel.<br/></span> 
🎧 Sounds good. Let's <span>relax</span> for a <span>bit.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Reading</span> before bed is the best way to <span>relax.<br/></span> 
🎧 It helps me <span>clear</span> my <span>mind.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm <span>re-reading</span> <span>“The</span> <span>Alchemist.”<br/></span> 
🎧 It always helps me <span>reflect</span> on life a <span>bit.<br/></span> 
🎧 That's a good <span>choice</span>. I'm <span>reading</span> a <span>mystery</span> <span>novel.<br/></span> 
🎧 It <span>keeps</span> me <span>guessing</span> <span>until</span> the <span>end.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Perfect</span> way to end the <span>day.<br/></span> 
🎧 Let's read for a bit and then <span>lights</span> <span>out.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Okay</span>, I'm done for the <span>night.<br/></span> 
🎧 I feel <span>sleepy</span> <span>already.<br/></span> 
🎧 Let's get some <span>rest</span>. <span>Tomorrow's</span> another <span>busy</span> <span>day.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Goodnight</span>, <span>James</span>. <span>Sweet</span> <span>dreams.<br/></span> 
🎧 Good <span>night</span>, <span>Emma</span>. <span>Sleep</span> <span>well.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2>Planning the Trip</h2>

🎧 I'm so <span>excited</span> for our <span>trip!<br/></span> 
🎧 But I don't know where to start. How do we plan <span>it?<br/></span> 
🎧 Don't <span>worry</span>, <span>Anna.<br/></span> 
🎧 First we need to decide where to <span>go.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you <span>guys</span> have a place in <span>mind?<br/></span> 
🎧 I've always <span>wanted</span> to visit <span>Japan.<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>cherry</span> <span>blossoms</span> look so <span>beautiful.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Japan</span> is a great <span>choice!<br/></span> 
🎧 We can start by <span>booking</span> our <span>flights</span> and <span>accommodation.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you have a <span>budget?<br/></span> 
🎧 I think around <span>1500</span>. Is that <span>enough?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, that should be <span>enough.<br/></span> 
🎧 That's <span>great!<br/></span> 
🎧 We'll find some good <span>deals.<br/></span> 
🎧 Let's check <span>online</span> for <span>flights</span> <span>first.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2>Packing the Luggage</h2>

🎧 Are you all set for <span>packing</span>, <span>Anna?<br/></span> 
🎧 Not <span>really..</span>. I'm <span>confused</span> about what to <span>pack.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's my first time <span>traveling.<br/></span> 
🎧 Just <span>pack</span> the <span>essentials.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Clothes</span>, phone <span>backup</span> <span>charger</span>, and don't <span>forget</span> your <span>passport!<br/></span> 
🎧 Right! Should I <span>bring</span> a lot of <span>clothes?<br/></span> 
🎧 No need to <span>overpack</span>. Just enough for a few <span>days.<br/></span> 
🎧 You can always do <span>laundry</span> <span>there.<br/></span> 
🎧 I got it. What about <span>shoes?<br/></span> 
🎧 Should I <span>bring</span> <span>fancy</span> <span>ones?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Comfortable</span> <span>shoes</span> are a <span>must.<br/></span> 
🎧 You'll be <span>walking</span> a <span>lot.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Okay</span>, I'm <span>packing</span> my <span>sneakers.<br/></span> 
🎧 I think I'm <span>ready.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Awesome!<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2>Airport Check-In</h2>

🎧 I'm so <span>nervous.<br/></span> 
🎧 What do we do <span>now?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Relax</span>, <span>Anna.<br/></span> 
🎧 First, we need to check <span>in.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you have your <span>passport</span> and <span>ticket?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes. I have them <span>here.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Katherine</span> <span>reminded</span> me of <span>this.<br/></span> 
🎧 Great! Let's go to the <span>counter.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hello</span>! May I have your <span>passports</span>, <span>please?<br/></span> 
🎧 Here you <span>go.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thank you. How many <span>bags</span> are you <span>checking</span> <span>in?<br/></span> 
🎧 Just one for <span>me.<br/></span> 
🎧 Same <span>here.<br/></span> 
🎧 Me <span>too.<br/></span> 
🎧 Alright. Your <span>flight</span> <span>leaves</span> from <span>Gate</span> <span>5.<br/></span> 
🎧 Have a nice <span>trip!<br/></span> 
🎧 Thank <span>you!<br/></span> 
🎧 See, that wasn't so <span>bad.<br/></span> 
🎧 You're right. I feel better <span>now.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2>Boarding the Flight</h2>

🎧 They're <span>calling</span> our <span>row.<br/></span> 
🎧 Are you two <span>ready</span> to <span>board?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Ready</span> as <span>ever.<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes. I'm <span>ready.<br/></span> 
🎧 What do we <span>do?<br/></span> 
🎧 Just <span>follow</span> the <span>line.<br/></span> 
🎧 Have your <span>boarding</span> <span>pass</span> and <span>passport</span> <span>ready.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Boarding</span> <span>passes</span>, <span>please.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thank <span>you.<br/></span> 
🎧 Enjoy your <span>flight!<br/></span> 
🎧 Wow, this is <span>exciting</span>! Where are our <span>seats?<br/></span> 
🎧 Right here. You have the <span>window</span> <span>seat.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yay</span>! I can't wait to see the <span>view.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2>Call a Taxi</h2>

🎧 How do we get to the <span>hotel?<br/></span> 
🎧 They have <span>subways</span>, <span>taxis</span>, and many other <span>means</span> of <span>transportation</span> <span>here.<br/></span> 
🎧 Let's <span>call</span> a <span>taxi</span>. It's the <span>easiest</span> <span>way.<br/></span> 
🎧 That's a good <span>idea.<br/></span> 
🎧 But we don't <span>speak</span> <span>Japanese.<br/></span> 
🎧 What if they don't <span>understand</span> <span>us?<br/></span> 
🎧 Don't <span>worry</span>. Many <span>drivers</span> <span>speak</span> some <span>English.<br/></span> 
🎧 Let's give it a <span>try.<br/></span> 
🎧 We can also use <span>translation</span> <span>apps</span> if <span>needed.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hello</span>! Where to <span>go?<br/></span> 
🎧 Hi, we're going to the <span>Grand</span> <span>Tokyo</span> <span>Hotel.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Grand</span> <span>Tokyo</span> <span>Hotel</span>? <span>Okay!<br/></span> 
🎧 That was <span>easier</span> than I <span>thought!<br/></span> 
🎧 See? No <span>problem</span> at <span>all.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2>Buying Souvenirs</h2>

🎧 These are so <span>cute</span>! I want to buy something for my <span>family.<br/></span> 
🎧 Good <span>idea.<br/></span> 
🎧 What about those <span>keychains?<br/></span> 
🎧 They're small and <span>easy</span> to <span>carry.<br/></span> 
🎧 I also want to buy <span>them.<br/></span> 
🎧 Let me ask the <span>shopkeeper</span> about the <span>cost.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hello</span>! Can I help you with <span>anything?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, I'd like to buy these <span>keychains.<br/></span> 
🎧 How much are <span>they?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>500</span> <span>yen</span> <span>each.<br/></span>

🎧 I'm so <span>excited</span> to give these to my <span>family.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2>Local Food</h2>

🎧 This place looks <span>amazing.<br/></span> 
🎧 I've never <span>tried</span> <span>sushi</span> <span>before.<br/></span> 
🎧 You'll love <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 Let's <span>order</span> a few <span>dishes</span> to <span>share.<br/></span> 
🎧 Good <span>evening</span>! Are you <span>ready</span> to <span>order?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, we'll have some <span>sushi</span>, <span>tempura</span>, and <span>miso</span> <span>soup</span>, <span>please.<br/></span> 
🎧 Great <span>choices</span>! Anything to <span>drink?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Matcha</span> tea for me, <span>please.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll have a <span>green</span> tea, <span>please.<br/></span> 
🎧 Same for <span>me.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Coming</span> right <span>up!<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm a little <span>nervous</span> to try new food, but I'm <span>excited</span> <span>too.<br/></span> 
🎧 Don't <span>worry</span>, it's <span>delicious.<br/></span> 
🎧 Just take small <span>bites</span> and enjoy the <span>flavors.<br/></span> 
🎧 Wow, this is so good! I'm glad I <span>tried</span> <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>knew</span> you'd like <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 Trying <span>local</span> food is one of the best <span>parts</span> of <span>traveling.<br/></span> 
🎧 I agree! I can't wait to try <span>more.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>

<h2>First Impressions</h2>

🎧 <span>Sophie</span>, I'm so <span>nervous!<br/></span> 
🎧 What if he doesn't like <span>me?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Relax</span>, <span>Emily</span>. Just be <span>yourself.<br/></span> 
🎧 He's <span>already</span> <span>interested</span>, so you're <span>halfway</span> <span>there!<br/></span> 
🎧 But what if I say something <span>silly?<br/></span> 
🎧 It's <span>okay.<br/></span> 
🎧 Just <span>smile</span>, be <span>polite</span>, and ask him about <span>himself.<br/></span> 
🎧 Everyone <span>likes</span> to talk about <span>themselves.<br/></span> 
🎧 You're right. I'll just <span>focus</span> on having a good <span>time.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Exactly!<br/></span> 
🎧 And <span>remember</span>, first <span>impressions</span> <span>matter.<br/></span> 
🎧 But they're not <span>everything.<br/></span> 
🎧 Just enjoy the <span>moment.<br/></span> 
🎧 What about <span>clothes</span>, should I <span>dress</span> <span>mature</span> or <span>sweet?<br/></span> 
🎧 Which <span>style</span> do you feel most <span>comfortable</span> <span>with?<br/></span> 
🎧 I like <span>sweet</span> <span>things,<br/></span> 
🎧 But I'm also a <span>grown</span> <span>woman,<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm <span>worried</span> if it's <span>okay</span> to <span>dress</span> like <span>that.<br/></span> 
🎧 Why <span>not?<br/></span> 
🎧 If he is a good man, he will <span>respect</span> your <span>style.<br/></span> 
🎧 You can't live your <span>whole</span> life for <span>someone</span> else, <span>right?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Wear</span> what you <span>like,<br/></span> 
🎧 as long as it's <span>polite</span> and <span>comfortable.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks, <span>Sophie.<br/></span> 
🎧 You always know what to <span>say.<br/></span> 
🎧 Hey man, are you <span>ready</span> for the <span>date?<br/></span> 
🎧 I think so, but I'm kind of <span>nervous.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's been a <span>while</span> since my last <span>date.<br/></span> 
🎧 Just <span>remember</span>, it's not about <span>impressing</span> her with big <span>gestures.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Focus</span> on having a good time and getting to know <span>her.<br/></span> 
🎧 I got <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 But there is one more <span>thing.<br/></span> 
🎧 I can't decide what to <span>wear.<br/></span> 
🎧 Should I go with the <span>blue</span> <span>shirt</span> or the <span>grey</span> <span>one?<br/></span> 
🎧 Go with the <span>blue</span>. It's more <span>casual</span> but still looks <span>sharp.<br/></span> 
🎧 Also, it <span>brings</span> out your <span>eyes.<br/></span> 
🎧 Good <span>point</span>. What about <span>jeans</span> or <span>chinos?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Chinos</span>, <span>definitely.<br/></span> 
🎧 They're a bit more <span>dressed</span> up but still <span>comfortable.<br/></span> 
🎧 You want to look like you put in some <span>effort</span> without <span>overdoing</span> <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 Got <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 Should I <span>bring</span> <span>flowers</span> or is that too much for a first <span>date?<br/></span> 
🎧 How about something <span>simple</span>, like a box of <span>chocolates?<br/></span> 
🎧 It's <span>thoughtful</span> without being <span>overwhelming.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks, <span>Lucas</span>. I feel more <span>prepared</span> <span>now.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2>Planning the Date</h2>

🎧 So, <span>Emily</span>, do you have any <span>favorite</span> <span>places</span> in <span>town?<br/></span> 
🎧 I really like the <span>park</span> by the <span>river.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's <span>peaceful</span> and has a great <span>view.<br/></span> 
🎧 That sounds <span>nice.<br/></span> 
🎧 How about we take a <span>walk</span> there after <span>dinner?<br/></span> 
🎧 I love that. It's a <span>perfect</span> <span>spot</span> for a <span>quiet</span> <span>chat.<br/></span> 
🎧 Great! We can <span>grab</span> some ice <span>cream</span> on the way <span>too.<br/></span> 
🎧 That sounds like a <span>perfect</span> <span>evening.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm <span>in.<br/></span> 
🎧 What time should we <span>meet?<br/></span> 
🎧 How about <span>7</span> <span>PM</span> <span>tomorrow?<br/></span> 
🎧 That <span>gives</span> us <span>plenty</span> of time to enjoy <span>dinner<br/></span> 
🎧 and catch the music before it <span>gets</span> too <span>late.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>7</span> <span>PM</span> <span>works</span> for <span>me.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Okay</span>. See you <span>later.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2>Choosing the Restaurant</h2>

🎧 Have you been to the <span>AC</span> <span>Italian</span> <span>Cuisine</span> <span>restaurant</span> <span>before?<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>tried</span> that <span>restaurant</span> once a year <span>ago,<br/></span> 
🎧 but I want to make sure it is still as good as <span>before.<br/></span> 
🎧 I need to <span>prepare</span> <span>carefully</span> so that <span>Emily</span> will have good <span>memories.<br/></span> 
🎧 No, but I've <span>heard</span> good things about <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 You know <span>Jimmy?<br/></span> 
🎧 He just <span>proposed</span> to his <span>girlfriend</span> <span>successfully</span> two <span>weeks</span> ago at that <span>restaurant.<br/></span> 
🎧 That place is <span>Cupid.<br/></span> 
🎧 That might be a good start for you and <span>Emily.<br/></span> 
🎧 I don't <span>believe</span> in such things, but it <span>seems</span> like a good <span>thing.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks, <span>Lucas.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll <span>invite</span> <span>Emily</span> to this <span>restaurant.<br/></span> 
🎧 Good <span>luck</span>, <span>Jake.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Emily</span>, would you like to try the <span>Italian</span> <span>restaurant</span> near the <span>city</span> <span>center?<br/></span> 
🎧 It's <span>worth</span> a <span>try.<br/></span> 
🎧 Of course, I'm <span>looking</span> forward to <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 You plan so <span>carefully.<br/></span> 
🎧 No big <span>deal.<br/></span> 
🎧 I just want us to have a great <span>date.<br/></span> 
🎧 See you <span>tomorrow.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Cool.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2>Conversation Starters</h2>

🎧 So, <span>Emily</span>, what do you like to do in your free <span>time?<br/></span>

🎧 It helps me <span>relax.<br/></span> 
🎧 That's <span>cool.<br/></span> 
🎧 What kind of <span>books</span> do you <span>like?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Mostly</span> <span>fiction.<br/></span> 
🎧 I love getting <span>lost</span> in a good <span>story.<br/></span> 
🎧 What about <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm into <span>hiking</span> and <span>photography.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Nature</span> is my <span>escape.<br/></span> 
🎧 That sounds <span>amazing</span>. I've always <span>wanted</span> to try <span>hiking.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe we can go together <span>sometime.<br/></span> 
🎧 I know some great <span>trails.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'd like <span>that.<br/></span> 
🎧 Are you <span>ready</span> to <span>order?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, we'll start with the <span>bruschetta,<br/></span> 
🎧 and then we'd like to share the <span>lasagna</span> and <span>carbonara.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Excellent</span> <span>choices.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll <span>bring</span> those out <span>shortly.<br/></span> 
🎧 This place has such a nice <span>atmosphere.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's <span>perfect</span> for a first <span>date.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm glad you like <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>wanted</span> to choose <span>somewhere</span> <span>special.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2>Saying Goodbye</h2>

🎧 I had a really great time <span>tonight</span>, <span>Emily.<br/></span> 
🎧 Dinner, the <span>walk</span>, the music. It was all <span>perfect.<br/></span> 
🎧 I did too, <span>Jake</span>. Everything was just <span>right.<br/></span> 
🎧 You <span>planned</span> it so <span>well.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm glad you think <span>so.<br/></span> 
🎧 I was a little <span>nervous</span> about everything going <span>smoothly,<br/></span> 
🎧 but it <span>turned</span> out better than I <span>hoped.<br/></span> 
🎧 You didn't need to <span>worry.<br/></span> 
🎧 It was one of the best <span>evenings</span> I've had in a long <span>time.<br/></span> 
🎧 So I <span>guess</span> this is where we say <span>goodbye.<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, I <span>suppose</span> so. But <span>hopefully</span>, not for too <span>long.<br/></span> 
🎧 Definitely. I'd love to do this again sometime <span>soon.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe next <span>weekend.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'd like <span>that.<br/></span> 
🎧 Let's keep in <span>touch</span> and plan <span>something.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you need a <span>ride</span> <span>home?<br/></span> 
🎧 I can <span>call</span> a <span>taxi</span> for <span>you.<br/></span> 
🎧 That's <span>sweet</span>, but I'm <span>okay.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Sophie</span> has something to do <span>nearby,<br/></span> 
🎧 so she'll be here to <span>pick</span> me up in <span>five</span> <span>minutes.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Emily</span>, <span>here!<br/></span> 
🎧 She was <span>faster</span> than I <span>thought.<br/></span> 
🎧 Take <span>care</span>, <span>Emily</span>. I had a great <span>time.<br/></span> 
🎧 You too, <span>Jake</span>. Have a good <span>night.<br/>
</span><br/><br/>
