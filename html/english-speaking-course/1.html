<h2 id="esc-1-4">Starting the day <b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this, 4)">🔊</b></h2>

🎧 Oh good morning, Tom!<br/> 
🎧 How are you today?<br/> 
🎧 Did you get enough <span>sleep</span> last <span>night</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I feel like I <span>barely</span> <span>slept</span> at <span>all</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Morning, <span>Alice</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I'm okay, I <span>guess</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But to be <span>honest</span>, I <span>stayed</span> up a bit too <span>late</span> <span>watching</span> that new <span>series</span> on <span>TV</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You know how it <span>goes</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You say, <span>“Just</span> one more <span>episode,”</span> and then <span>suddenly</span> it's <span>1</span> <span>AM</span>.<br/> 
🎧 How about you?<br/> 
🎧 Oh, I know that feeling all too well.<br/> 
🎧 I was up <span>late</span> to trying to <span>finish</span> a book I was <span>reading</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It was so good that I couldn't put it <span>down</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But now I'm definitely feeling <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I need a <span>strong</span> <span>coffee</span> to <span>wake</span> me up.<br/> 
🎧 Me too!<br/> 
🎧 A good cup of <span>coffee</span> sounds like the perfect way to start the day.<br/> 
🎧 Let's do this and make it a <span>productive</span> <span>day</span>.<br/> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2 id="esc-1-72">Team Meetings <b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this, 72)">🔊</b></h2>

🎧 Good morning, <span>everyone</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I hope you're all ready for <span>today's</span> <span>meeting</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Let's start by going over the <span>progress</span> on our <span>current</span> <span>projects</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Alice</span>, would you like to <span>begin</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Of course, Mr. Smith.<br/> 
🎧 The <span>research</span> <span>phase</span> is <span>complete</span>, and we've <span>started</span> the <span>development</span> <span>stage</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We did <span>face</span> a <span>slight</span> <span>delay</span> <span>due</span> to some <span>unexpected</span> <span>challenges</span> with the <span>data</span>,<br/> 
🎧 but we <span>managed</span> to <span>resolve</span> them <span>quickly</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Actually, <span>Alice</span>, I'm not sure I agree with that.<br/> 
🎧 I think the <span>delay</span> was <span>longer</span> than you're <span>suggesting</span>,<br/> 
🎧 and it's going to <span>push</span> us behind <span>schedule</span> if we don't <span>address</span> it <span>properly</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I <span>understand</span> your <span>concern</span>, <span>Jimmy</span>,<br/> 
🎧 but I've already made changes to <span>handle</span> the <span>delay</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'm sure we can still meet our <span>deadlines</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But <span>Alice</span>, we need to be <span>realistic</span> about what we can <span>achieve</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Alright, I see both of your <span>points</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Let's go over the <span>timeline</span> and see what changes we can make to <span>stay</span> on <span>track</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We'll <span>solve</span> any issues to make sure we <span>deliver</span> great <span>results</span> for our <span>clients</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That makes <span>sense</span>, Mr. Smith.<br/> 
🎧 I didn't mean to <span>ignore</span> the issue. I just wanted to <span>stay</span> <span>positive</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I get that, <span>Alice</span>.<br/> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2 id="esc-1-164">Lunch Break <b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this, 164)">🔊</b></h2>

🎧 Hi <span>Alice</span>, hi Tom! <span>Mind</span> if I join you for lunch today?<br/> 
🎧 I <span>brought</span> my lunch from home, but it's always <span>nicer</span> to eat with <span>company</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Sure, <span>Sarah</span>. I could use a <span>break</span> after that <span>meeting</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, let's take a <span>breather</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That <span>meeting</span> was a bit <span>intense</span>, <span>huh</span>?<br/> 
🎧 But, hey, we're all on the same <span>team</span>, right?<br/> 
🎧 Oh no, what <span>happened</span> in the <span>meeting</span>?<br/> 
🎧 You both look like you can use some <span>comfort</span> <span>food</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Just a little <span>disagreement</span> about our <span>project</span> <span>timeline</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I know Tom was just trying to be <span>realistic</span>,<br/> 
🎧 but it <span>felt</span> like he was <span>challenging</span> everything I <span>said</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I didn't mean to come off that way, <span>Alice</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I <span>respect</span> your work a lot.<br/> 
🎧 I just think we need to be <span>careful</span> with our <span>deadlines</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's good for us, right?<br/> 
🎧 You're right. I don't want a small <span>disagreement</span> to <span>spoil</span> our day.<br/> 
🎧 We're all <span>putting</span> in a lot of <span>effort</span> and I <span>appreciate</span> your <span>feedback</span>, Tom.<br/> 
🎧 Let's take a <span>break</span>, enjoy lunch, and come back to the <span>project</span> with a <span>fresh</span> <span>perspective</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Agreed. I'm glad we <span>talked</span> it <span>out</span>.<br/> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2 id="esc-1-250">Client Calls <b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this, 250)">🔊</b></h2>

🎧 Hello, this is <span>Alice</span> from <span>Brand</span> New <span>Company</span>.<br/>

🎧 Hi <span>Alice</span>, I wanted to <span>discuss</span> the <span>details</span> of our new <span>project</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Certainly</span>! Let me <span>pull</span> up the <span>information</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What <span>specific</span> <span>details</span> would you like to go <span>over</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I want to <span>confirm</span> the <span>timeline</span> and the <span>main</span> <span>tasks</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We have an <span>eight-week</span> <span>schedule</span>,<br/> 
🎧 with the first <span>task</span> <span>due</span> in two <span>weeks</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Does that work for you?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, that's perfect. Thank you for the <span>clarification</span>.<br/>

🎧 Yes, I am. It's been a long day.<br/> 
🎧 Me too. <span>Ready</span> to go home and <span>relax</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I have to go to the <span>grocery</span> <span>store</span> to buy some things for <span>dinner</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's <span>tiring</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, if that's the case, it'll take you at <span>least</span> two hours to <span>finish</span> <span>dinner</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Why don't we go out for <span>dinner</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Just for today. Because we've <span>worked</span> <span>hard</span> all day long.<br/> 
🎧 That sounds good.<br/> 
🎧 I agree.<br/> 
🎧 The <span>Korean</span> <span>restaurant</span> near my house is <span>famous</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You should definitely try it <span>once</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>Ugh</span>, is it morning already?<br/> 
🎧 I feel like I just went to <span>bed</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, it's <span>morning</span>.<br/> 
🎧 The <span>alarm's</span> been going off for a while now.<br/> 
🎧 We should probably get up.<br/> 
🎧 Another <span>busy</span> day <span>ahead</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I know, I know. But <span>five</span> more <span>minutes</span> wouldn't <span>hurt</span>, right?<br/> 
🎧 So <span>cozy</span> here.<br/> 
🎧 You always say that, and then we end up <span>rushing</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But I get <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Mornings</span> are tough.<br/> 
🎧 Let's make a <span>deal</span>, <span>five</span> more <span>minutes</span>, and then we'll start the day.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Deal</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You know, I've been thinking about <span>changing</span> our morning <span>routine</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe <span>adding</span> some <span>stretches</span> or a <span>quick</span> <span>workout</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It might help us <span>wake</span> up <span>better</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That's not a bad <span>idea</span>.<br/> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2 id="esc-1-477">Morning Exercise <b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this, 477)">🔊</b></h2>

🎧 Alright, so I've <span>found</span> a short morning <span>workout</span> <span>routine</span> online.<br/> 
🎧 It's only <span>15</span> <span>minutes</span>. It's perfect for <span>beginners</span> like <span>us</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Ready</span> to give it a <span>try</span>?<br/> 
🎧 As ready as I'll ever <span>be</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'm still <span>waking</span> up, but I think this could be good for <span>us</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Lead</span> the way, <span>Coach</span> <span>Emma</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Okay, let's start with some <span>light</span> <span>stretches</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'm not usually a morning person, but this actually <span>feels</span> nice.<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, I can see why people do this.<br/> 
🎧 It's like we're <span>shaking</span> off the <span>sleepiness</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Exactly! Just something to get us <span>moving</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Now, let's try some <span>jumping</span> <span>jacks</span>,<br/> 
🎧 just a few to get our <span>heart</span> <span>rates</span> up.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Jumping</span> <span>jacks</span>, <span>huh</span>? Alright, let's do this.<br/> 
🎧 You know, this might be the first time I've done <span>jumping</span> <span>jacks</span> since <span>school</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Really</span>?<br/> 
🎧 But it's kind of fun, right?<br/> 
🎧 For <span>sure</span>.<br/> <span><br/>
</span>

🎧 I'm <span>making</span> <span>pancakes</span> with <span>banana</span> and <span>honey</span>!<br/> 
🎧 It's been a long time since I <span>cooked</span> this <span>dish</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That sounds <span>fancy</span>! Do you need any help?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, can you <span>mash</span> the <span>bananas</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I'll mix the <span>batter</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Pancakes</span> are a nice <span>change</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We haven't had them in a while.<br/> 
🎧 What made you think of this?<br/> 
🎧 I wanted something <span>comforting</span> and <span>sweet</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Plus</span>, it's <span>quick</span> and easy.<br/> 
🎧 We can add some <span>fresh</span> <span>berries</span> on top to.<br/> 
🎧 I'll get the <span>berries</span> ready.<br/>

🎧 What if he doesn't like me?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Relax</span>, <span>Emily</span>. Just be yourself.<br/> 
🎧 He's already interested, so you're <span>halfway</span> there!<br/> 
🎧 But what if I say something <span>silly</span>?<br/> 
🎧 It's okay.<br/> 
🎧 Just <span>smile</span>, be <span>polite</span>, and ask him about <span>himself</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Everyone likes to talk about <span>themselves</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You're right. I'll just focus on having a good time.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Exactly</span>!<br/> 
🎧 And <span>remember</span>, first <span>impressions</span> <span>matter</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But they're not everything.<br/> 
🎧 Just enjoy the <span>moment</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What about <span>clothes</span>, should I <span>dress</span> <span>mature</span> or <span>sweet</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Which <span>style</span> do you feel most <span>comfortable</span> <span>with</span>?<br/>

🎧 But I'm also a <span>grown</span> woman,<br/> 
🎧 I'm <span>worried</span> if it's okay to <span>dress</span> like that.<br/> 
🎧 Why not?<br/> 
🎧 If he is a good man, he will <span>respect</span> your <span>style</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You can't live your whole life for someone else, right?<br/>

🎧 I think so, but I'm kind of <span>nervous</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's been a while since my last <span>date</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Just <span>remember</span>, it's not about <span>impressing</span> her with big <span>gestures</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Focus</span> on having a good time and getting to know <span>her</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I got <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But there is one more thing.<br/> 
🎧 I can't decide what to <span>wear</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Should I go with the <span>blue</span> <span>shirt</span> or the <span>grey</span> one?<br/> 
🎧 Go with the <span>blue</span>. It's more <span>casual</span> but still looks <span>sharp</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Also, it <span>brings</span> out your <span>eyes</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Good <span>point</span>. What about <span>jeans</span> or <span>chinos</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Chinos</span>, definitely.<br/> 
🎧 They're a bit more <span>dressed</span> up but still <span>comfortable</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You want to look like you put in some <span>effort</span> without <span>overdoing</span> <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Got <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Should I <span>bring</span> <span>flowers</span> or is that too much for a first <span>date</span>?<br/> 
🎧 How about something simple, like a box of <span>chocolates</span>?<br/> 
🎧 It's <span>thoughtful</span> without being <span>overwhelming</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Thanks, <span>Lucas</span>. I feel more <span>prepared</span> <span>now</span>.<br/> <span><br/>
