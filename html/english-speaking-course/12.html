🎧 I'm <span>reading</span> my new book.<br/>
🎧 What's its name?<br/>
🎧 The Little <span>Prince</span>.<br/>
🎧 Haven't you read it?<br/>
🎧 It's quite <span>popular</span>.<br/>
🎧 No way.<br/>
🎧 I have read it many <span>times</span>.<br/>
🎧 But this book is a <span>limited</span> <span>edition</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, really?<br/>
🎧 Yeah. You can see that it's a <span>hardcover</span> book.<br/>
🎧 Wow. It's <span>amazing</span>!<br/>
🎧 Right. It's very <span>difficult</span> to buy it.<br/>
🎧 How much is this book?<br/>
🎧 It <span>costs</span> me <span>nearly</span> <span>100</span> <span>dollars</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>God</span>! So <span>expensive</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I'm really <span>keen</span> on books. I don't <span>spare<br/></span>
🎧 money to buy <span>expensive</span> books.<br/>
🎧 I see.<br/>
<span><br/></span>

<h2 id="esc-12-58">I want to do it immediately</h2>

🎧 How is the <span>lesson</span>?<br/>
🎧 Do you know how to <span>bake</span> a <span>cake</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I really <span>enjoyed</span> this <span>lesson</span>. I love it.<br/>
🎧 That's great!<br/>

🎧 It's more <span>interesting</span> than I thought.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
🎧 I hope you will make a <span>cake</span> for me one day.<br/>
🎧 Of course. How about now?<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 Sure. I want to do it <span>immediately</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>pleasure</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you have all the <span>ingredients</span> at home?<br/>
🎧 I don't have <span>sugar</span> at home. We should go buy it.<br/>
🎧 Okay. Let's go together.<br/>
<span><br/></span>

<h2 id="esc-12-107">How can you <span>complete</span> all that so quickly?</h2>

🎧 I have a lot of work to do. But I <span>don't<br/></span>
🎧 know how to start from <span>scratch</span>.<br/>
🎧 What are you saying? <span>Stop</span> <span>lying</span> <span>in<br/></span>
🎧 bed, get up and open your <span>laptop</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know. I know.<br/>
🎧 What should I do first?<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>tomorrow</span> is the <span>deadline<br/></span>
🎧 for our <span>Geography</span> <span>assignment</span>.<br/>
🎧 Have you done it?<br/>
🎧 I've done <span>nothing</span>.<br/>

🎧 Are you <span>kidding</span> me?<br/>
🎧 When will you start?<br/>
🎧 Now. How about you? Have you done it?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I've done it.<br/>
🎧 You're not <span>human</span>. How can <span>you<br/></span>
🎧 <span>complete</span> all that so quickly?<br/>
🎧 No. It's <span>normal</span>. The <span>problem</span> is that you didn't start.<br/>
🎧 Okay. I got it. I will do it right now.<br/>
🎧 Good.<br/>
<span><br/></span>

🎧 Hey. Do you know the <span>conflict<br/></span>
🎧 between <span>Andrea</span> and <span>Mina</span>?<br/>
🎧 Of course. I was there the whole time.<br/>
🎧 Me too.<br/>
🎧 But I didn't know what <span>happened</span> at the end.<br/>
🎧 Why?<br/>
🎧 I had to come back home. What <span>happened</span> after i <span>left</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, they <span>quarreled</span> and had a <span>little<br/></span>
🎧 <span>scuffle</span> and some <span>teachers</span> game.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I <span>left</span> when Mr. <span>David</span> was <span>coming</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 Then he was able to <span>stop</span> them.<br/>
🎧 And then?<br/>
🎧 Then they <span>apologized</span> to each other in <span>front</span> of everyone.<br/>
🎧 So what made them <span>fight</span> like that?<br/>
🎧 They <span>misunderstood</span> each other.<br/>
🎧 Only <span>David</span> <span>knows</span> because he <span>spoke</span> <span>directly</span> to them.<br/>
🎧 I got it. So it all <span>ended</span> well.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, they <span>quarreled</span> and they <span>apologized</span>. That's all.<br/>
🎧 The <span>story</span> <span>ended</span> in the <span>simplest</span> way.<br/>
<span><br/></span>

<h2 id="esc-12-235">I had a <span>hard</span> time <span>making</span> this</h2>

🎧 I'm so happy to hear that.<br/>
🎧 You know, I had a <span>hard</span> time <span>making</span> this.<br/>
🎧 I love you, but how did you make it?<br/>
🎧 Well, I saw this <span>model</span> <span>accidentally</span> on the <span>Internet</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>intended</span> to buy it for you.<br/>
🎧 But why did you make it <span>yourself</span>?<br/>
🎧 I just thought that if I made it for you, <span>you<br/></span>
🎧 would be <span>happier</span> when you see my <span>effort</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, so <span>sweet</span>.<br/>
🎧 It has some <span>problems</span>, but they're <span>minor</span>.<br/>
🎧 I hope you don't <span>notice</span> them.<br/>
🎧 No <span>problem</span>. This is the first time I <span>received<br/></span>
🎧 such a <span>wonderful</span> <span>handmade</span> <span>gift</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's quite <span>difficult</span> to make it,<br/>
🎧 but it makes me feel great.<br/>
🎧 Thanks again.<br/>
<span><br/></span>

<h2 id="esc-12-299">It was <span>certainly</span> <span>worth</span> it</h2>

🎧 What's wrong? You look so <span>tired</span>!<br/>
🎧 Right. I'm not <span>tired</span>, I'm <span>exhausted</span>.<br/>
🎧 What did you do last <span>night</span>?<br/>
🎧 I <span>spent</span> my whole <span>night</span> <span>reading</span> all the <span>articles</span> as well as <span>newspapers</span> about the <span>topic</span> of the <span>assignment</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, really?<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 I <span>found</span> lots of <span>useful</span> <span>information<br/></span>
🎧 but I feel <span>exhausted</span> now.<br/>
🎧 Why don't you <span>continue</span> <span>reading</span> today?<br/>
🎧 Well, I find it very <span>effective</span> to <span>spend</span> time <span>organizing</span> <span>information</span> <span>continuously</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know. The most <span>important</span> thing is the <span>result</span>.<br/>
🎧 Right. The <span>result</span> was good.<br/>
🎧 Well, it was <span>certainly</span> <span>worth</span> it. You <span>worked</span> so <span>hard</span>.<br/>
<span><br/></span>

<h2 id="esc-12-356">Keep it under your hat</h2>

🎧 <span>Sarah</span>, It's <span>Alex</span>, <span>Andrea's</span> <span>boyfriend</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. Why are you <span>calling</span> me?<br/>
🎧 I want to ask you something.<br/>
🎧 Go on.<br/>
🎧 You know, <span>Andrea's</span> <span>birthday</span> is <span>coming</span> but I haven't <span>decided</span> what I should give her.<br/>
🎧 Well. She <span>likes</span> a lot of things.<br/>
🎧 I <span>asked</span> her but she just <span>said:</span> <span>"No</span>, you don't need to buy me anything. It's <span>fine"</span>.<br/>
🎧 She always <span>thinks</span> for you.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
🎧 So I need your advice. You are her best friend.<br/>
🎧 Well, <span>Andrea</span> is the <span>happiest</span> girl in the <span>world</span> when she has a <span>boyfriend</span> like you.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 She <span>loves</span> to make up so I think <span>that<br/></span>
🎧 <span>make-up</span> <span>items</span> are the best <span>choice</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's a good idea. Thank you.<br/>
🎧 And please keep it under your hat.<br/>
🎧 Of course. I won't tell her.<br/>
<span><br/></span>

<h2 id="esc-12-430">That girl is so strange</h2>

🎧 I was <span>impressed</span> by her <span>smile</span>.<br/>
🎧 She's got a <span>bright</span> <span>smile</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can see it. But that girl is so <span>strange</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>Yesterday</span> was her first day at <span>school<br/></span>
🎧 but she hadn't <span>prepared</span> anything.<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 Yeah. I <span>sat</span> next to her.<br/>
🎧 She didn't <span>bring</span> her <span>textbooks</span>, books, or <span>pens</span>. Not even her <span>backpack</span>.<br/>
🎧 Wow. So how could she learn?<br/>
🎧 She did <span>nothing</span> in class.<br/>
🎧 I can't <span>understand</span> her.<br/>
🎧 <span>Neither</span> can I. <span>Anyway</span>, she was <span>kind<br/></span>
🎧 of <span>sociable</span>. She <span>talked</span> to everyone.<br/>
🎧 That's a good <span>point</span>.<br/>
<span><br/></span>

🎧 I got it.<br/>
🎧 But are you <span>close</span>?<br/>
🎧 No. We didn't <span>exchange</span> <span>numbers</span> or <span>Instagrams<br/></span>
🎧 Well, that's so <span>strange</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. But I think I should go to say hello to him.<br/>
🎧 Sure. I will wait for you.<br/>
🎧 I will come back soon.<br/>
