<h2>Talking about <span>Daily</span> <span>Routine</span> in English</h2>

🎧 Good morning.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>7:00</span>.<br/>
🎧 Time to <span>wake</span> up.<br/>
🎧 Well, morning Anna.<br/>
🎧 Did you <span>sleep</span> well?<br/>
🎧 Morning, <span>Lisa</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>slept</span> okay, but I had a <span>weird</span> <span>dream</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Weird</span> <span>dream</span>? Tell me about it.<br/>
🎧 I <span>dreamt</span> I was <span>flying</span>, but then I <span>started</span> <span>falling</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>strange</span>.<br/>
🎧 Maybe that <span>says</span> you're very <span>stressed</span>.<br/>
🎧 You have a lot of work to do on school <span>projects</span> these <span>days</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Maybe</span>...<br/>
🎧 After the <span>projects</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>guess</span> I need to <span>rest</span>.<br/>
🎧 How about you?<br/>
🎧 Any <span>plans</span> today?<br/>
🎧 Just some <span>stuff</span> to do at school.<br/>
🎧 Okay, let's go have <span>breakfast</span>.<br/>
🎧 What are we having for <span>breakfast</span>, Anna?<br/>
🎧 I think I'll make some <span>toast</span> with <span>butter</span> and <span>jam<br/></span>
🎧 and a <span>glass</span> of <span>orange</span> <span>juice</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sounds good.<br/>
🎧 I'll have the same.<br/>
🎧 Let's <span>prepare</span> the <span>toast</span> together.<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 You <span>handle</span> the <span>toaster</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll get the <span>jam</span> and <span>butter</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Deal</span>.<br/>
🎧 How many <span>slices</span> do you want?<br/>
🎧 Two for me.<br/>
🎧 How about you?<br/>
🎧 I'll take two as well.<br/>
🎧 Did you <span>study</span> <span>late</span> last <span>night</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, a bit.<br/>
🎧 Just trying to <span>stay</span> on top of everything.<br/>
🎧 This is very <span>important</span> to me.<br/>
🎧 What about you?<br/>
🎧 Did you <span>finish</span> that <span>novel</span> you were <span>reading</span>?<br/>
🎧 I did, the <span>ending</span> was a <span>surprise</span>.<br/>
🎧 I didn't see it <span>coming</span> at all.<br/>
🎧 Now I really want to read it.<br/>
🎧 Maybe I'll try when I'm less <span>busy</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, the <span>toast</span> is ready! <span>Let's</span> <span>butter</span> it up.<br/>
🎧 Do you want a lot of <span>butter</span>?<br/>
🎧 Or just a little?<br/>
🎧 Just a little. Thanks.<br/>
🎧 And some <span>strawberry</span> <span>jam</span>, please.<br/>
🎧 <span>Coming</span> right up.<br/>
🎧 Here you are.<br/>
🎧 Let's try it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ooh</span>, this is <span>delicious</span>.<br/>
🎧 I love <span>toast</span> and <span>jam</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's good to start a new day.<br/>
🎧 I'm happy that you like it.<br/>
🎧 Do you need any help with your <span>project</span>?<br/>
🎧 Thanks for <span>offering</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I think we've got it under <span>control</span>.<br/>
🎧 Tom and <span>Sarah</span> are great <span>teammates</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's good to hear.<br/>
🎧 Hey, Anna.<br/>
🎧 Ready to work on the <span>project</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes. Let's get <span>started</span>.<br/>
🎧 We need to <span>finish</span> the <span>research</span> <span>part</span> today.<br/>
🎧 I <span>brought</span> some books from the <span>library</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great! I'll start <span>writing</span> the <span>introduction</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is going well.<br/>
🎧 We're a good <span>team</span>.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely.<br/>
🎧 Let's keep it up.<br/>
🎧 Anna, can you check this <span>paragraph</span>?<br/>
🎧 Sure.<br/>
🎧 Let me see her.<br/>
🎧 It looks good, but maybe we should add more <span>details</span> here.<br/>
🎧 Anna, could you help me with this <span>chart</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm not sure if I got the <span>data</span> right.<br/>
🎧 Of course, Tom.<br/>
🎧 Let's look at it together.<br/>
🎧 Tom, what do you think about this <span>source</span>?<br/>
🎧 Is it <span>reliable</span>?<br/>
🎧 Let's <span>cross-check</span> it with another book to be sure.<br/>
🎧 Good idea.<br/>
🎧 I'll look it up online to.<br/>
🎧 I <span>found</span> another book that has <span>similar</span> <span>information</span>.<br/>
🎧 Maybe we could use both <span>sources</span>.<br/>
🎧 That sounds <span>perfect</span>.<br/>
🎧 We can <span>compare</span> and add the best <span>parts</span> from each.<br/>
🎧 How are we doing on the <span>timeline</span>?<br/>
🎧 Are we on <span>schedule</span>?<br/>
🎧 I think we're doing fine.<br/>
🎧 If we keep up this <span>pace</span>, we should <span>finish</span> in time.<br/>
🎧 Yes. Let's keep <span>pushing</span>.<br/>
🎧 We're almost there.<br/>
🎧 What should we eat for lunch?<br/>
🎧 How about a <span>salad</span> at a <span>sandwich</span>?<br/>
🎧 Sounds good to me.<br/>
🎧 I'll have the <span>chicken</span> <span>salad</span> and a side of <span>sweet</span> <span>potato</span> <span>fries</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 Wait for me a <span>minute</span> and I'll be right back.<br/>
🎧 I'm back.<br/>
🎧 Thank you so much, Tom.<br/>
🎧 They look so <span>yummy</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah.<br/>
🎧 So, any <span>plans</span> for <span>tonight</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, we're having a <span>party</span> <span>tonight</span>.<br/>
🎧 You should come.<br/>
🎧 That sounds fun.<br/>
🎧 Come here.<br/>
🎧 I'll be there, too.<br/>
🎧 What time does it start?<br/>
🎧 Around <span>6</span> <span>p.m</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's going to be a <span>blast</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>looking</span> forward to it.<br/>
🎧 What should I <span>bring</span>?<br/>
🎧 Just <span>bring</span> <span>yourself</span> in a good <span>mood</span>.<br/>
🎧 Anna, what music will we have at the <span>party</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh, I made a <span>playlist</span> with all our <span>favorite</span> <span>songs</span>.<br/>
🎧 We can also take <span>requests</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Perfect</span>. I love <span>dancing</span> to good music.<br/>
🎧 Should I <span>bring</span> some <span>snacks</span> or <span>drinks</span>?<br/>
🎧 That would be great, Tom. Thanks.<br/>
🎧 Do you <span>guys</span> think we'll have time to play some <span>games</span>?<br/>
🎧 Absolutely.<br/>
🎧 I have a few fun <span>games</span> in <span>mind</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can't wait.<br/>
🎧 It's going to be so much fun.<br/>
🎧 This is going to be so much fun.<br/>
🎧 I'm glad everyone could make it.<br/>
🎧 Me too.<br/>
🎧 Let's enjoy the <span>evening</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>party</span> is <span>awesome</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I'm having a <span>blast</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm glad you <span>guys</span> are here.<br/>
🎧 Let's play some <span>games</span>.<br/>
🎧 How about we play a <span>round</span> of <span>Werewolf</span>?<br/>
🎧 It's always <span>intense</span> and fun.<br/>
🎧 Good idea.<br/>
🎧 Yes! I love <span>Werewolf</span>.<br/>
🎧 Alright, everyone <span>close</span> your <span>eyes</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Werewolves</span>, <span>wake</span> up and choose your <span>victim</span>.<br/>
🎧 Anna, you're so good at this game.<br/>
🎧 Thanks! <span>I've</span> had a lot of <span>practice</span>.<br/>
🎧 What's next?<br/>
🎧 How about some <span>karaoke</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I love <span>karaoke</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great idea.<br/>
🎧 Let's put on some music and <span>dance</span>.<br/>
🎧 Tom, your <span>singing</span> is <span>amazing</span>!<br/>
🎧 Thanks, Anna.<br/>
🎧 I've <span>practiced</span> this <span>song</span> at home many <span>times</span>.<br/>
🎧 Come on, <span>guys</span>, let's take a <span>group</span> <span>photo</span> to <span>remember</span> the <span>night</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is going to be a great <span>memory</span>.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely.<br/>
🎧 We should <span>print</span> this and <span>added</span> to our <span>photo</span> <span>wall</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's so nice.<br/>
🎧 Alright. See you again <span>guys</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was really happy <span>tonight</span>.<br/>
🎧 Me too. Thanks for a great <span>night</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anytime</span>, <span>Sarah</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Goodbye</span>. See you <span>guys</span> again.<br/>
<br/><br/>
