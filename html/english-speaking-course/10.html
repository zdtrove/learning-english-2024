<h2>Somebody help me!</h2>

🎧 Dad! Where's <span>mom?<br/></span> 
🎧 She went out to run some <span>errands.<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, I hope she <span>remembered</span> to get some <span>flour</span> for <span>me.<br/></span> 
🎧 What's that <span>for?<br/></span> 
🎧 It's for <span>baking</span>. I want to make a <span>birthday</span> <span>cake</span> for <span>Laura.<br/></span> 
🎧 I didn't know you <span>baked.<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, you're right. I've never made a <span>cake</span> <span>before.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Liz</span>, be <span>careful</span> not to <span>burn</span> the <span>kitchen</span> down, <span>alright?<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, let's hope for the <span>best...<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm <span>serious</span>, <span>Liz</span>. My <span>back's</span> been <span>bothering</span> me, and I don't have the <span>energy</span> to <span>clean</span> up a <span>mess.<br/></span> 
🎧 Absolutely, <span>dad.<br/></span> 
🎧 You won't have to help me eat the <span>cake</span> <span>either.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Somebody</span> help <span>me!<br/></span> 
🎧 Is that <span>mom?<br/></span> 
🎧 Sounds like it. Let's go see what's going <span>on!<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, thank <span>goodness</span> you're both <span>here!<br/></span> 
🎧 Mom, what <span>happened</span>? Why is everything on the <span>floor?<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, the <span>supermarket</span> <span>bags</span> <span>ripped</span>, and my <span>groceries</span> went <span>everywhere.<br/></span> 
🎧 Dad, what are you <span>waiting</span> for? Help Mom <span>pick</span> things <span>up!<br/></span> 
🎧 Looks like my back doesn't get a day off, <span>then.<br/></span> 
🎧 What are you doing this <span>weekend?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Napping.<br/></span> 
🎧 I mean, what else are you <span>doing<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>besides</span> <span>napping?<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, you might not <span>believe</span> me, but that's all I can really <span>manage</span> right <span>now.<br/></span> 
🎧 Don't tell me you plan to <span>sleep</span> all <span>day?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes. What's wrong with <span>that?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Naps</span> are good for <span>you.<br/></span> 
🎧 You <span>deserve</span> some <span>relaxation</span>, but <span>naps</span> shouldn't be your only <span>activity.<br/></span> 
🎧 You don't know the <span>half</span> of <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 I've been <span>sleep</span> <span>deprived</span> all <span>week.<br/></span> 
🎧 What's going <span>on?<br/></span> 
🎧 I've had to <span>stay</span> <span>up<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>super</span> <span>late</span>, <span>finishing</span> <span>reports<br/></span> 
🎧 Like every <span>single</span> day! I almost didn't even have time to <span>shower!<br/></span> 
🎧 Sounds like your <span>workload</span> is <span>crazy.<br/></span> 
🎧 Absolutely! So is my <span>sleep</span> <span>schedule.<br/></span> 
🎧 That's definitely not <span>healthy</span> in the long run, <span>Mia</span>! You should do <span>something!<br/></span> 
🎧 So what am I <span>supposed</span> to <span>do?<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, maybe you should change your <span>schedule<br/></span> 
🎧 How about going to bed <span>earlier?<br/></span> 
🎧 As if my <span>boss</span> would let me <span>turn<br/></span> 
🎧 in all those <span>reports</span> <span>late.<br/></span> 
🎧 You could <span>finish</span> them during your working <span>hours!<br/></span> 
🎧 There is no way I can <span>finish</span> those <span>reports</span> <span>within</span> <span>8</span> <span>hours.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Plus</span>, I have other <span>tasks</span> to <span>do...<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, in that case, I <span>guess</span> you should change your <span>boss</span> <span>then.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Deb?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, Rob? What's <span>up?<br/></span> 
🎧 Can I ask you <span>something?<br/></span> 
🎧 Of course. <span>Honey</span>. What is <span>it?<br/></span> 
🎧 Why are you with <span>me?<br/></span> 
🎧 You ask this <span>like..</span>. every other week, <span>Rob.<br/></span> 
🎧 I know, I know, <span>sweetie..</span>. But it <span>feels</span> like you never really <span>explain</span> <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Explain</span> what <span>exactly?<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, why does an <span>amazing</span> <span>woman</span> like you choose to be <span>with..</span>. <span>someone</span> like <span>me?<br/></span> 
🎧 And what's wrong with <span>someone</span> like <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 You know, I'm not exactly good <span>looking.<br/></span> 
🎧 I don't drive a <span>fancy</span> <span>car.<br/></span> 
🎧 I work a <span>boring</span> <span>9</span> to <span>5</span> <span>job.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>So?<br/></span> 
🎧 You could have <span>chosen</span> <span>someone</span> <span>else..</span>. <span>Someone</span> who is <span>more..</span>. <span>exciting</span>, you <span>know?<br/></span> 
🎧 You mean <span>someone</span> who is <span>handsome</span>, has a <span>fast</span> car and a <span>glamorous</span> <span>life?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Well...<br/></span> 
🎧 Rob, you make me so happy. <span>Truly</span> happy. That's all that <span>matters.<br/></span> 
🎧 But, <span>Deb...<br/></span> 
🎧 No <span>buts</span>, Rob. Now please help me set the <span>table</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Dinner is <span>ready.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Woah</span>, you look <span>stressed</span>! What's <span>up?<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>upcoming</span> <span>annual</span> <span>party</span>! It's getting on my <span>nerves!<br/></span> 
🎧 I know, right? It's on our day <span>off.<br/></span> 
🎧 Can you <span>believe</span> <span>it?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll have to <span>cancel</span> my <span>whole</span> <span>holiday<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>trip</span> with my <span>husband.<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, I'm <span>sorry</span> to hear <span>that.<br/></span> 
🎧 But <span>actually</span>, there's something else <span>stressing</span> me <span>out.<br/></span> 
🎧 What's <span>that?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Finding</span> a <span>dress</span> for the <span>party!<br/></span> 
🎧 Don't you have like a <span>wardrobe</span> full of <span>dresses?<br/></span> 
🎧 My <span>closet</span> is full, but <span>nothing</span> <span>feels</span> <span>fancy</span> <span>enough.<br/></span> 
🎧 I feel you! Maybe you could buy something <span>new?<br/></span> 
🎧 I don't know if I can even <span>afford</span> a new <span>dress</span> right <span>now...<br/></span> 
🎧 Everything is so <span>expensive.<br/></span> 
🎧 How about <span>renting?<br/></span> 
🎧 Have you <span>considered</span> <span>renting</span> a <span>dress?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Renting</span>? Is that even a <span>thing?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Totally</span>! My friend <span>actually</span> <span>runs</span> a <span>rental</span> <span>shop</span> with <span>amazing</span> <span>dresses</span> at <span>reasonable</span> <span>prices.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Really?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Absolutely.<br/></span> 
🎧 We can <span>swing</span> by after <span>work.<br/></span> 
🎧 How does that <span>sound?<br/></span> 
🎧 That's <span>amazing</span>, thank you so <span>much!<br/></span> 
🎧 No <span>problem</span>, happy to <span>help!<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, hey, <span>Paul</span>! What's <span>up?<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, I'm here about my son, <span>Jake...<br/></span> 
🎧 What's wrong with <span>Jake?<br/></span> 
🎧 So, he told me he got a little <span>carried</span> away <span>while</span> playing at your house this <span>afternoon...<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Ah</span>, yeah, the <span>kids</span> definitely had a <span>wild</span> time <span>running</span> <span>around.<br/></span> 
🎧 And he <span>ended</span> up <span>breaking</span> your <span>vase...<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, it's <span>true.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Jake</span> <span>accidentally</span> hit the <span>table</span> and <span>broke</span> the <span>vase.<br/></span> 
🎧 But <span>thankfully</span>, no one got <span>hurt!<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, <span>thankfully</span>! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Speaking</span> of the <span>vase</span>, I <span>heard</span> it was a <span>sentimental</span> <span>piece...<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, it was from my <span>grandma.<br/></span> 
🎧 She gave it to my <span>wife</span> and me on our <span>wedding</span> <span>day.<br/></span> 
🎧 Is there anything I can <span>do<br/></span> 
🎧 to make it up to <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 Like <span>replacing</span> it with another <span>one.<br/></span> 
🎧 Don't <span>worry</span> about it, <span>Paul</span>! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Actually</span>, my <span>grandma</span> <span>heard</span> about <span>it<br/></span> 
🎧 and said she will <span>send</span> me a new <span>one.<br/></span> 
🎧 She <span>did?<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, that's a <span>relief.<br/></span> 
🎧 But please, let me at <span>least</span> <span>replace</span> this <span>one.<br/></span> 
🎧 Come on <span>Paul.<br/></span> 
🎧 You <span>helped</span> us out a <span>ton</span> over the <span>years.<br/></span> 
🎧 This is <span>nothing.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Plus</span>, it's not like <span>Jake</span> did it <span>intentionally!<br/></span> 
🎧 If you say <span>so...<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Um</span>, I will tell <span>Jake</span> to be more <span>careful</span> next <span>time!<br/></span> 
🎧 Hey, I didn't see you in <span>history</span> <span>today.<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, something came up this <span>morning,<br/></span> 
🎧 and I had to <span>skip</span> a few <span>classes.<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh. What <span>happened?<br/></span> 
🎧 My little <span>sister</span> <span>tripped</span> <span>while</span> playing with her <span>friends<br/></span> 
🎧 and I had to take her to the <span>hospital.<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh my, is she <span>alright?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Aside</span> from a <span>broken</span> <span>leg,<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>guess</span> she's <span>fine.<br/></span> 
🎧 A <span>broken</span> leg is not fine, <span>Jake!<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, she's in good <span>spirits</span> <span>considering</span> <span>everything.<br/></span> 
🎧 They set the <span>cast</span>, and she's <span>resting</span> <span>now.<br/></span> 
🎧 So, she's fine, I <span>guess.<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, your <span>sister</span> is such a <span>brave</span> little <span>girl!<br/></span> 
🎧 She is! Bet she got her <span>courage</span> from our <span>Grandpa!<br/></span> 
🎧 Have you told your <span>parents?<br/></span> 
🎧 They are on a <span>trip</span>, <span>right?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes. I <span>called</span> them this <span>morning<br/></span> 
🎧 and they told me they would <span>book<br/></span> 
🎧 the first <span>flight</span> to get <span>home.<br/></span> 
🎧 They must be <span>worried</span> <span>sick!<br/></span> 
🎧 They are! <span>Anyway</span>, can I <span>borrow</span> your <span>history</span> <span>notes?<br/></span> 
🎧 No <span>problem</span>! I will <span>send</span> them to your <span>email!<br/></span> 
🎧 Thank you, <span>dude</span>! You're a <span>lifesaver.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Mike</span>, why are you still <span>here?<br/></span> 
🎧 What do you mean, <span>Mom?<br/></span> 
🎧 I thought you had a <span>project</span> at <span>Simon's</span> house today? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>science</span> <span>project</span>, <span>right?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, Mom. But we <span>canceled</span> it. I'm <span>staying</span> home <span>today.<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh. Why did you <span>cancel</span> <span>it?<br/></span> 
🎧 It's <span>raining</span> outside. Don't you <span>see?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Rain</span> or <span>shine</span>, it doesn't <span>necessarily</span> <span>affect</span> school <span>projects</span>, does <span>it?<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, it kind of does in this case. Our <span>project</span> is all about the <span>sun.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Interesting</span>! What do you have to <span>do?<br/></span> 
🎧 We need to <span>track</span> the <span>sun's</span> <span>position<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>throughout</span> the <span>day.<br/></span> 
🎧 How are you planning to do <span>that?<br/></span> 
🎧 That's the <span>whole</span> <span>point</span>! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We have to find a <span>way<br/></span> 
🎧 to <span>measure</span> its <span>movement.<br/></span> 
🎧 So what is your and <span>Simon's</span> <span>plan?<br/></span> 
🎧 We are going to use a <span>tree</span> as a <span>marker...<br/></span> 
🎧 And <span>then?<br/></span> 
🎧 And then we will <span>measure</span> its <span>shadow</span> to see how the sun <span>moves.<br/></span> 
🎧 That's <span>actually</span> a <span>clever</span> idea! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I bet you and <span>Simon</span> will get an A for this <span>project!<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm not sure if it's <span>possible.<br/></span> 
🎧 Why <span>not?<br/></span> 
🎧 Because if it <span>continues</span> to <span>rain</span>, we won't get a <span>chance</span> to do our <span>project.<br/></span> 
🎧 You're right. <span>Hopefully</span>, <span>tomorrow</span> will be <span>sunny</span> for <span>you.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thank you. <span>Mom.<br/></span> 
🎧 Hey, <span>Amy</span>! It's nice to see you <span>here!<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, <span>Laura</span>! Hi! What a nice <span>surprise!<br/></span> 
🎧 What are you doing <span>here?<br/></span> 
🎧 This is a <span>bookstore</span>. Of course, I'm <span>looking</span> for some <span>books.<br/></span> 
🎧 Have you <span>found</span> <span>them?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Unfortunately</span>, not <span>yet.<br/></span> 
🎧 May I see your book <span>list?<br/></span> 
🎧 Sure, here you <span>go.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, <span>interesting</span> <span>choices.<br/></span> 
🎧 These are some <span>real</span> <span>classics</span>! <span>But..</span>. I don't think you'll find them <span>here.<br/></span> 
🎧 This is the <span>biggest</span> <span>bookstore</span> in <span>town</span>. I think they would have <span>everything!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>True</span>, but these <span>books</span> <span>might<br/></span> 
🎧 be a bit out of <span>print.<br/></span> 
🎧 They were <span>published</span> quite a <span>while</span> <span>ago.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Um..</span>. You're <span>right...<br/></span> 
🎧 But hey, don't <span>worry!<br/></span> 
🎧 Our <span>local</span> <span>library</span> probably has them <span>all.<br/></span> 
🎧 I know, but I want to buy <span>them<br/></span> 
🎧 as a <span>present</span> for my <span>sister's</span> <span>birthday.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>see..</span>. Is she a <span>bookworm?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, she <span>reads</span> a <span>lot.<br/></span> 
🎧 So how about <span>buying</span> her something <span>else?<br/></span> 
🎧 Like a <span>reading</span> <span>lamp?<br/></span> 
🎧 You know what, that's <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>actually</span> a great <span>idea!<br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks for the <span>suggestion.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>heard</span> that you got into some <span>trouble</span> with a <span>client?<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, <span>already?<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>office</span> <span>gossip</span> sure <span>spreads</span> like <span>wildfire.<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, it's <span>hard</span> not to hear the <span>argument</span> between you and the <span>boss</span> this <span>morning.<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, he <span>left</span> his <span>door</span> open, so I'm sure the <span>whole</span> <span>floor</span> <span>heard</span> <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 So what <span>happened?<br/></span> 
🎧 My <span>client</span> didn't like my <span>proposal.<br/></span> 
🎧 She made me change it <span>like..</span>. <span>6</span> <span>times.<br/></span> 
🎧 Six <span>times?<br/></span> 
🎧 What exactly did she <span>hate<br/></span> 
🎧 about your <span>proposal?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Apparently</span> the <span>cost.<br/></span> 
🎧 She said it was out of her <span>budget.<br/></span> 
🎧 And what did you <span>do?<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>changed</span> the <span>whole</span> plan <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>completely</span> to fit her <span>budget</span>, <span>but...<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>But?<br/></span> 
🎧 But then she didn't like the <span>plan.<br/></span> 
🎧 She said it was too <span>plain.<br/></span> 
🎧 Things aren't always easy. She can't have it <span>all.<br/></span> 
🎧 Funny thing is, that's exactly what I told <span>her.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>guess</span> that didn't go over <span>well?<br/></span> 
🎧 Absolutely! That's why I got a <span>lecture</span> from the <span>boss</span> this <span>morning.<br/></span> 
🎧 Hey <span>Nicole!<br/></span> 
🎧 Hi <span>Lily</span>! How was your <span>day?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Pretty</span> good! How about <span>yours?<br/></span> 
🎧 Not bad! Are you cooking dinner? It <span>smells</span> <span>amazing!<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, I'm <span>making</span> <span>pasta</span>. Do you want <span>some?<br/></span> 
🎧 Really? That would be <span>great.<br/></span> 
🎧 Sure, but it'll take another <span>half</span> <span>hour</span> or <span>so.<br/></span> 
🎧 I can wait all day for your <span>pasta.<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, I <span>wonder</span> if <span>Maya</span> would want some as <span>well!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Speaking</span> of <span>Maya</span>, did she tell <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Maya</span>? About what? I haven't <span>seen</span> her since this <span>morning.<br/></span> 
🎧 She's <span>moving</span> out at the end of the <span>year.<br/></span> 
🎧 We should probably <span>start<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>looking</span> for a new <span>roommate.<br/></span> 
🎧 Wow, that's <span>sudden!<br/></span> 
🎧 She didn't <span>mention</span> anything to <span>me.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Actually</span>, she just <span>mentioned</span> it to me last <span>night.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe she will tell you <span>later<br/></span> 
🎧 when she comes <span>home.<br/></span> 
🎧 Did she say why she's <span>moving</span> <span>out?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Apparently</span>, she has to move to <span>Shanghai</span> for <span>work.<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh wow, that's <span>exciting!<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>lived</span> in <span>Shanghai</span> for a long <span>time.<br/></span> 
🎧 It was an <span>amazing</span> <span>experience.<br/></span> 
🎧 Really? You should definitely give <span>Maya</span> some <span>tips!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Absolutely!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Ava</span>, come on, <span>dinner's</span> <span>ready.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Actually</span>, can you tell Mom and Dad I'm <span>skipping</span> dinner <span>tonight?<br/></span> 
🎧 Hey, what's wrong? <span>Stomach</span> <span>ache?<br/></span> 
🎧 No, I'm just not really feeling <span>hungry.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you want to talk <span>about<br/></span> 
🎧 what's <span>bothering</span> <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 It's <span>just..</span>. I <span>miss</span> my best <span>friend.<br/></span> 
🎧 You mean, <span>Olivia?<br/></span> 
🎧 Of course, <span>Dave</span>! Who else could be my best <span>friend?<br/></span> 
🎧 She <span>moved</span> to the <span>UK</span> with her <span>family</span>, didn't <span>she?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, and it <span>feels</span> like she already <span>forgot</span> about <span>me.<br/></span> 
🎧 We haven't <span>spoken</span> in a <span>week.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Ava</span>, she's probably <span>super</span> <span>busy</span> getting <span>settled</span> <span>in.<br/></span> 
🎧 You don't get it, <span>Dave!<br/></span> 
🎧 We always <span>talked</span> every <span>day.<br/></span> 
🎧 No <span>matter</span> how <span>busy</span> we <span>were.<br/></span> 
🎧 That was when she <span>lived</span> <span>here.<br/></span> 
🎧 Give her some time to <span>adjust</span>, <span>trust</span> <span>me.<br/></span> 
🎧 Fine. I <span>trust</span> <span>you.<br/></span> 
🎧 But I still don't want <span>dinner.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Ava</span>, you weren't even this bad when you <span>broke</span> up with your <span>ex!<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, don't even <span>remind</span> me of that <span>guy!<br/></span> 
🎧 Okay, okay, <span>sorry!<br/></span> 
🎧 How about I <span>save</span> you a <span>plate?<br/></span> 
🎧 You can <span>heat</span> it up <span>whenever</span> you're <span>hungry.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks, <span>Dave</span>. That sounds <span>good.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Ben</span>, what are you doing out <span>here?<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, <span>Sophie</span>! I'm <span>just..</span>. <span>looking.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Looking</span> at <span>what?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Um</span>, those <span>cakes!<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, they look <span>delicious!<br/></span> 
🎧 They do! I'm so <span>hungry!<br/></span> 
🎧 Why don't you <span>head</span> <span>inside<br/></span> 
🎧 and <span>grab</span> a <span>slice?<br/></span> 
🎧 I can't really <span>afford</span> it right <span>now.<br/></span> 
🎧 Why <span>not?<br/></span> 
🎧 Did you already <span>blow</span> your <span>allowance?<br/></span> 
🎧 No, I haven't <span>touched</span> <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 But I'm <span>saving</span> for a <span>gaming</span> <span>console.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>see...<br/></span> 
🎧 That's why you're <span>standing</span> outside a <span>bakery</span> and <span>staring</span> <span>longingly</span> at their <span>cakes.<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, well, <span>dinner's</span> almost ready <span>anyway</span>, so I shouldn't eat <span>cake.<br/></span> 
🎧 We could get some for <span>dessert</span>, <span>though.<br/></span> 
🎧 Don't try to talk me into <span>buying</span> <span>it!<br/></span> 
🎧 No <span>worries</span>, little <span>brother</span>! It's on <span>me!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Really?!<br/></span> 
🎧 Why are you <span>suddenly</span> <span>generous</span> <span>today?<br/></span> 
🎧 What's the <span>occasion?<br/></span> 
🎧 Because I feel like <span>eating</span> some <span>tasty</span> <span>cakes!<br/></span> 
🎧 Come on, let's go in and <span>pick</span> your <span>favorite!<br/></span> 
🎧 Alright, alright! You're the best, <span>sis!<br/></span> 
🎧 There, <span>finally</span> <span>finished</span> that <span>report!<br/></span> 
🎧 You look <span>rough</span>, <span>Brandon.<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, time is <span>money.<br/></span> 
🎧 I have to <span>invest</span> it in something <span>useful</span>, like my <span>report!<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, you're right, but your <span>health</span> is an <span>investment</span> <span>too.<br/></span> 
🎧 Easy for you to say, <span>Isa.<br/></span> 
🎧 Some of us have <span>deadlines</span> to <span>meet.<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, you <span>seem</span> to <span>meet</span> those <span>deadlines</span> <span>successfully<br/></span> 
🎧 because you look really <span>dead</span> right <span>now!<br/></span> 
🎧 What do you <span>mean?<br/></span> 
🎧 Look in the <span>mirror</span>, <span>Brandon!<br/></span> 
🎧 You look like you haven't <span>slept</span> for <span>weeks.<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, <span>actually</span>, I haven't <span>slept</span> for only <span>2</span> <span>days!<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh my <span>goodness.<br/></span> 
🎧 You go to bed right <span>now!<br/></span> 
🎧 Come on, it's not that <span>bad!<br/></span> 
🎧 Let me <span>send</span> out some <span>emails</span> <span>first.<br/></span> 
🎧 No <span>emails</span> <span>tonight</span>, <span>honey.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's time to <span>wind</span> <span>down.<br/></span> 
🎧 Your <span>eyes</span> are getting <span>heavy.<br/></span> 
🎧 Alright, alright! But can I at <span>least</span> <span>brush</span> my <span>teeth</span> <span>first?<br/></span> 
🎧 Hey, do you <span>mind</span> if I sit <span>here?<br/></span> 
🎧 Sure, no <span>problem!<br/></span> 
🎧 Just let me just move my bag a <span>sec.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Thanks!<br/></span> 
🎧 Wow, your lunch <span>smells</span> <span>amazing!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Thanks!<br/></span> 
🎧 It's <span>actually</span> <span>leftovers</span> from dinner last <span>night.<br/></span> 
🎧 You must be a great <span>cook!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Actually</span>, my <span>husband's</span> the one who <span>cooks</span> most of the <span>time.<br/></span> 
🎧 He's <span>amazing.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Lucky</span> <span>you!<br/></span> 
🎧 What about <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 What did you <span>pack</span> for <span>lunch?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Fish</span> <span>tacos</span>! Do you want to try a <span>bite?<br/></span> 
🎧 That's really nice of <span>you<br/></span> 
🎧 But I'll have to <span>pass.<br/></span> 
🎧 You don't like <span>fish?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Fish</span> <span>upsets</span> my <span>stomach.<br/></span> 
🎧 I will get <span>sick</span> from <span>that.<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh no, I'm so <span>sorry!<br/></span> 
🎧 I had no <span>idea.<br/></span> 
🎧 No <span>worries</span>! I'm used to <span>it!<br/></span> 
🎧 Wow, that's <span>tough!<br/></span> 
🎧 I don't think I could <span>survive</span> without <span>fish.<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, my <span>husband</span> makes up for it with all <span>sorts</span> of <span>delicious</span> <span>non-fishy</span> <span>dishes</span>, <span>so...<br/></span> 
🎧 You're <span>right!<br/></span> 
🎧 Hey, <span>Liam</span>, <span>guess</span> <span>what?!<br/></span> 
🎧 What's up? <span>Emma?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm <span>wondering</span> what can make you that <span>excited.<br/></span> 
🎧 There's a new <span>vinyl</span> <span>record</span> <span>store</span> that just <span>opened!<br/></span> 
🎧 Right in the next <span>block!<br/></span> 
🎧 Sounds <span>cool!<br/></span> 
🎧 We absolutely have to check it <span>out!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Imagine</span> all the <span>hidden</span> <span>treasures</span> we might <span>find!<br/></span> 
🎧 You mean right <span>now?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, right <span>now!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>That'll</span> have to <span>wait.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm working on my <span>presentation.<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, I thought you were done with <span>that?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Turned</span> out I <span>misunderstood</span> the <span>assignment<br/></span> 
🎧 and now I have to do it all over <span>again.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Sorry</span> to hear <span>that!<br/></span> 
🎧 Is there any way I can help <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Um..</span>. I'm <span>thirsty?<br/></span> 
🎧 How about some <span>bubble</span> <span>tea?<br/></span> 
🎧 That sounds <span>tasty.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Perfect.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll <span>order</span> some online right <span>now.<br/></span> 
🎧 In the <span>meantime</span>, want some <span>water?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Sure!<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll be right <span>back!<br/></span> 
🎧 Thank you, <span>Emma!<br/></span> 
🎧 Here is your <span>water!<br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks, <span>Isa</span>! Where are the <span>kids?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Dave</span> is at his <span>friend's</span> <span>house.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Beth</span> is <span>studying</span> at the <span>library.<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, at the <span>library?<br/></span> 
🎧 Shouldn't she be <span>enjoying</span> the <span>summer</span> <span>break?<br/></span> 
🎧 Why is she <span>studying</span> so <span>hard?<br/></span> 
🎧 She <span>wants</span> to be a <span>dentist.<br/></span> 
🎧 You know, it's a lot of <span>work<br/></span> 
🎧 to become <span>one.<br/></span> 
🎧 I had no <span>idea.<br/></span> 
🎧 I always thought she was more into <span>literature</span> and would become a <span>writer.<br/></span> 
🎧 To be <span>honest</span>, that <span>surprised</span> me, <span>too!<br/></span> 
🎧 Did you ask her why she <span>wanted</span> to become a <span>dentist?<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, <span>Beth</span> <span>mentioned</span> that <span>dentists</span> make good money, <span>so...<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, that's <span>true</span>, <span>although</span> <span>dental</span> school <span>tuition</span> can be <span>incredibly</span> <span>expensive.<br/></span> 
🎧 Did you talk to her about <span>that?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, we <span>discussed</span> her <span>options</span> and <span>available</span> <span>resources.<br/></span> 
🎧 Sounds like she's <span>well-informed</span> <span>then!<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, let's hope <span>so!<br/></span> 
🎧 Hey, <span>Wilson!<br/></span> 
🎧 How's the <span>college</span> <span>application</span> <span>going?<br/></span> 
🎧 Hey, <span>Eddie!<br/></span> 
🎧 It's alright, I <span>sent</span> out my <span>applications</span> last <span>week.<br/></span> 
🎧 How many <span>colleges</span> did you <span>apply</span> <span>to?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Five</span>. Let's hope I get into <span>one.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Dude</span>, <span>seriously</span>, you'll get into all of <span>them!<br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks, <span>Eddie</span>! How about <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 I haven't been <span>clear<br/></span> 
🎧 about what I want <span>yet.<br/></span> 
🎧 So I <span>decided</span> to take a <span>gap</span> <span>year.<br/></span> 
🎧 Have you made up your <span>mind?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, I've made up my <span>mind.<br/></span> 
🎧 So what are your <span>plans</span> for the <span>gap</span> <span>year?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm going to help my mom out at her <span>bakery.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Cool</span>. What will you <span>do?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm going to <span>bake.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Plus</span>, I'll take <span>care</span> of some <span>marketing</span>, <span>too.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>That'll</span> be a lot of work! Are you <span>nervous?<br/></span> 
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, I'm <span>excited</span> about the <span>future.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm glad to hear <span>that.<br/></span> 
🎧 Hey <span>Sarah</span>, have you <span>seen</span> the <span>construction</span> <span>site?<br/></span> 
🎧 No. What's <span>that?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Apparently</span>, they're <span>starting</span> <span>construction</span> next <span>month</span>, right on <span>5th</span> <span>Street.<br/></span> 
🎧 So what does that mean for <span>us?<br/></span> 
🎧 That <span>means</span> they're <span>rerouting</span> the bus <span>lane.<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, <span>no.<br/></span> 
🎧 How am I going to get to <span>work?<br/></span> 
🎧 That's the <span>thing.<br/></span> 
🎧 your <span>nearest</span> bus <span>stop</span> will be <span>four</span> <span>blocks</span> away once they change the <span>route.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe I can see if they'll let me work from home for a <span>bit.<br/></span> 
🎧 That's a good <span>idea!<br/></span> 
🎧 Or you could ask <span>Daniel.<br/></span> 
🎧 Ask him about <span>what?<br/></span> 
🎧 He <span>drives</span> to work, and you <span>guys</span> live in the same <span>neighborhood?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah...<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe he could give you a <span>ride</span> for a <span>month</span> <span>until</span> things <span>settle</span> <span>down?<br/></span> 
🎧 That's <span>actually</span> a great idea! I'll definitely ask <span>him.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Dude</span>, what's with the long <span>face?<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, you wouldn't want to hear <span>that.<br/></span> 
🎧 Come on, man, <span>spill</span> <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 You know I'm your best <span>friend.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's about my <span>birthday</span> <span>presents...<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Carry</span> on, I'm all <span>ears...<br/></span> 
🎧 So, you know, I am a <span>football</span> <span>fan.<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, <span>everybody</span> <span>knows</span> you're a <span>football</span> fan. A <span>huge</span> <span>one.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Except</span> for my <span>parents.<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, <span>really?<br/></span> 
🎧 They got me a <span>ticket</span> to a <span>basketball</span> game and a <span>pair</span> of <span>basketball</span> <span>sneakers.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Ouch</span>, that's <span>bad...<br/></span> 
🎧 Sounds like <span>someone</span> got their <span>sports</span> <span>mixed</span> <span>up.<br/></span> 
🎧 They're the <span>basketball</span> <span>fans</span>, aren't <span>they?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Bingo!<br/></span> 
🎧 Did you tell them how you're <span>feeling?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, but things got a bit <span>heated.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hence</span> the <span>grumpy</span> <span>face.<br/></span> 
🎧 Hey <span>Mia</span>, what are you up <span>to?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm <span>looking</span> for some <span>ideas.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Ideas</span> about <span>what?<br/></span> 
🎧 House <span>renovation.<br/></span> 
🎧 I have a small house, and I'm thinking of <span>renovating</span> <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, <span>cool.<br/></span> 
🎧 What made you decide on a <span>renovation?<br/></span> 
🎧 It is a bit old. I got it so <span>cheap</span> <span>though.<br/></span> 
🎧 So, I <span>guess</span> there is <span>nothing</span> to <span>complain</span> <span>about.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you have any <span>photos</span> on you? I'd love to see <span>it!<br/></span> 
🎧 Not right now, but I'll take some and <span>show</span> them to you <span>tomorrow.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Great.<br/></span> 
🎧 And, are you going to do it <span>yourself</span> or <span>hire</span> a <span>pro?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm still thinking about <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Renovations</span> can get <span>expensive</span>, and I'm not sure my <span>budget</span> can <span>handle</span> <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 That's <span>true</span>. They can definitely add <span>up.<br/>
