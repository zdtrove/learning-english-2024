<h2 id="esc-10-4">Somebody help me!</h2>

🎧 Dad! Where's <span>mom</span>?<br/> 
🎧 She went out to run some <span>errands</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, I hope she <span>remembered</span> to get some <span>flour</span> for <span>me</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What's that <span>for</span>?<br/> 
🎧 It's for <span>baking</span>. I want to make a <span>birthday</span> <span>cake</span> for <span>Laura</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I didn't know you <span>baked</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Well, you're right. I've never made a <span>cake</span> <span>before</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Liz</span>, be <span>careful</span> not to <span>burn</span> the <span>kitchen</span> down, alright?<br/> 
🎧 Well, let's hope for the <span>best</span>...<br/> 
🎧 I'm <span>serious</span>, <span>Liz</span>. My <span>back's</span> been <span>bothering</span> me, and I don't have the <span>energy</span> to <span>clean</span> up a <span>mess</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Absolutely, <span>dad</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You won't have to help me eat the <span>cake</span> <span>either</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Somebody</span> help <span>me</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Is that <span>mom</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Sounds like it. Let's go see what's going <span>on</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Oh, thank <span>goodness</span> you're both <span>here</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Mom, what <span>happened</span>? Why is everything on the <span>floor</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Well, the <span>supermarket</span> <span>bags</span> <span>ripped</span>, and my <span>groceries</span> went <span>everywhere</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Dad, what are you <span>waiting</span> for? Help Mom <span>pick</span> things up!<br/> 
🎧 Looks like my back doesn't get a day off, then.<br/> 

<h2 id="esc-10-91">Naps are good for you</h2>

🎧 What are you doing this <span>weekend</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Napping</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I mean, what else are you <span>doing<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>besides</span> <span>napping</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Well, you might not <span>believe</span> me, but that's all I can really <span>manage</span> right now.<br/> 
🎧 Don't tell me you plan to <span>sleep</span> all day?<br/> 
🎧 Yes. What's wrong with that?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Naps</span> are good for you.<br/> 
🎧 You <span>deserve</span> some <span>relaxation</span>, but <span>naps</span> shouldn't be your only <span>activity</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You don't know the <span>half</span> of <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I've been <span>sleep</span> <span>deprived</span> all <span>week</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What's going <span>on</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I've had to <span>stay</span> <span>up<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>super</span> <span>late</span>, <span>finishing</span> <span>reports<br/></span> 
🎧 Like every <span>single</span> day! I almost didn't even have time to <span>shower</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Sounds like your <span>workload</span> is <span>crazy</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Absolutely! So is my <span>sleep</span> <span>schedule</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That's definitely not <span>healthy</span> in the long run, <span>Mia</span>! You should do <span>something</span>!<br/> 
🎧 So what am I <span>supposed</span> to do?<br/> 
🎧 Well, maybe you should change your <span>schedule<br/></span> 
🎧 How about going to bed <span>earlier</span>?<br/> 
🎧 As if my <span>boss</span> would let me <span>turn<br/></span> 
🎧 in all those <span>reports</span> <span>late</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You could <span>finish</span> them during your working <span>hours</span>!<br/> 
🎧 There is no way I can <span>finish</span> those <span>reports</span> <span>within</span> <span>8</span> <span>hours</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Plus</span>, I have other <span>tasks</span> to do...<br/> 
🎧 Well, in that case, I <span>guess</span> you should change your <span>boss</span> then.<br/> 

<h2 id="esc-10-190">You make me so happy.</h2>

🎧 <span>Deb</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, Rob? What's up?<br/> 
🎧 Can I ask you <span>something</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Of course. <span>Honey</span>. What is <span>it</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Why are you with <span>me</span>?<br/> 
🎧 You ask this <span>like</span>... every other week, <span>Rob</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I know, I know, <span>sweetie</span>... But it <span>feels</span> like you never really <span>explain</span> <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Explain</span> what <span>exactly</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Well, why does an <span>amazing</span> <span>woman</span> like you choose to be <span>with</span>... someone like <span>me</span>?<br/> 
🎧 And what's wrong with someone like you?<br/> 
🎧 You know, I'm not exactly good <span>looking</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I don't drive a <span>fancy</span> <span>car</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I work a <span>boring</span> <span>9</span> to <span>5</span> <span>job</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>So</span>?<br/> 
🎧 You could have <span>chosen</span> someone <span>else</span>... <span>Someone</span> who is <span>more</span>... <span>exciting</span>, you know?<br/> 
🎧 You mean someone who is <span>handsome</span>, has a <span>fast</span> car and a <span>glamorous</span> <span>life</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Well</span>...<br/> 
🎧 Rob, you make me so happy. <span>Truly</span> happy. That's all that <span>matters</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But, <span>Deb</span>...<br/> 
🎧 No <span>buts</span>, Rob. Now please help me set the <span>table</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Dinner is <span>ready</span>.<br/> 

<h2 id="esc-10-277">Everything is so expensive.</h2>

🎧 <span>Woah</span>, you look <span>stressed</span>! What's up?<br/> 
🎧 The <span>upcoming</span> <span>annual</span> <span>party</span>! It's getting on my <span>nerves</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I know, right? It's on our day <span>off</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Can you <span>believe</span> <span>it</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I'll have to <span>cancel</span> my whole <span>holiday<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>trip</span> with my <span>husband</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Well, I'm <span>sorry</span> to hear that.<br/> 
🎧 But <span>actually</span>, there's something else <span>stressing</span> me out.<br/> 
🎧 What's that?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Finding</span> a <span>dress</span> for the <span>party</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Don't you have like a <span>wardrobe</span> full of <span>dresses</span>?<br/> 
🎧 My <span>closet</span> is full, but <span>nothing</span> <span>feels</span> <span>fancy</span> <span>enough</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I feel you! Maybe you could buy something <span>new</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I don't know if I can even <span>afford</span> a new <span>dress</span> right now...<br/> 
🎧 Everything is so <span>expensive</span>.<br/> 
🎧 How about <span>renting</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Have you <span>considered</span> <span>renting</span> a <span>dress</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Renting</span>? Is that even a thing?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Totally</span>! My friend <span>actually</span> <span>runs</span> a <span>rental</span> <span>shop</span> with <span>amazing</span> <span>dresses</span> at <span>reasonable</span> <span>prices</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Really</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Absolutely</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We can <span>swing</span> by after work.<br/> 
🎧 How does that <span>sound</span>?<br/> 
🎧 That's <span>amazing</span>, thank you so much!<br/> 
🎧 No <span>problem</span>, happy to <span>help</span>!<br/> 

<h2 id="esc-10-363">Don't worry about it!</h2>

🎧 Oh, hey, <span>Paul</span>! What's up?<br/> 
🎧 Well, I'm here about my son, <span>Jake</span>...<br/> 
🎧 What's wrong with <span>Jake</span>?<br/> 
🎧 So, he told me he got a little <span>carried</span> away while playing at your house this <span>afternoon</span>...<br/> 
🎧 <span>Ah</span>, yeah, the <span>kids</span> definitely had a <span>wild</span> time <span>running</span> <span>around</span>.<br/> 
🎧 And he <span>ended</span> up <span>breaking</span> your <span>vase</span>...<br/> 
🎧 Well, it's <span>true</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Jake</span> <span>accidentally</span> hit the <span>table</span> and <span>broke</span> the <span>vase</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But <span>thankfully</span>, no one got <span>hurt</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, <span>thankfully</span>! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Speaking</span> of the <span>vase</span>, I <span>heard</span> it was a <span>sentimental</span> <span>piece</span>...<br/> 
🎧 Well, it was from my <span>grandma</span>.<br/> 
🎧 She gave it to my <span>wife</span> and me on our <span>wedding</span> day.<br/> 
🎧 Is there anything I can <span>do<br/></span> 
🎧 to make it up to you?<br/> 
🎧 Like <span>replacing</span> it with another one.<br/> 
🎧 Don't <span>worry</span> about it, <span>Paul</span>! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Actually</span>, my <span>grandma</span> <span>heard</span> about <span>it<br/></span> 
🎧 and said she will <span>send</span> me a new one.<br/> 
🎧 She <span>did</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Well, that's a <span>relief</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But please, let me at <span>least</span> <span>replace</span> this one.<br/> 
🎧 Come on <span>Paul</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You <span>helped</span> us out a <span>ton</span> over the <span>years</span>.<br/> 
🎧 This is <span>nothing</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Plus</span>, it's not like <span>Jake</span> did it <span>intentionally</span>!<br/> 
🎧 If you say <span>so</span>...<br/> 
🎧 <span>Um</span>, I will tell <span>Jake</span> to be more <span>careful</span> next time!<br/> 

<h2 id="esc-10-459">No problem!</h2>

🎧 Hey, I didn't see you in <span>history</span> <span>today</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Well, something came up this <span>morning</span>,<br/> 
🎧 and I had to <span>skip</span> a few <span>classes</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh. What <span>happened</span>?<br/> 
🎧 My little <span>sister</span> <span>tripped</span> while playing with her <span>friends<br/></span> 
🎧 and I had to take her to the <span>hospital</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh my, is she alright?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Aside</span> from a <span>broken</span> <span>leg</span>,<br/> 
🎧 I <span>guess</span> she's fine.<br/> 
🎧 A <span>broken</span> leg is not fine, <span>Jake</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Well, she's in good <span>spirits</span> <span>considering</span> everything.<br/> 
🎧 They set the <span>cast</span>, and she's <span>resting</span> now.<br/> 
🎧 So, she's fine, I <span>guess</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, your <span>sister</span> is such a <span>brave</span> little girl!<br/> 
🎧 She is! Bet she got her <span>courage</span> from our <span>Grandpa</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Have you told your <span>parents</span>?<br/> 
🎧 They are on a <span>trip</span>, right?<br/> 
🎧 Yes. I <span>called</span> them this <span>morning<br/></span> 
🎧 and they told me they would <span>book<br/></span> 
🎧 the first <span>flight</span> to get home.<br/> 
🎧 They must be <span>worried</span> <span>sick</span>!<br/> 
🎧 They are! <span>Anyway</span>, can I <span>borrow</span> your <span>history</span> <span>notes</span>?<br/> 
🎧 No <span>problem</span>! I will <span>send</span> them to your <span>email</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Thank you, <span>dude</span>! You're a <span>lifesaver</span>.<br/> 

<h2 id="esc-10-538">It's raining outside.</h2>

🎧 <span>Mike</span>, why are you still <span>here</span>?<br/> 
🎧 What do you mean, <span>Mom</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I thought you had a <span>project</span> at <span>Simon's</span> house today? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>science</span> <span>project</span>, right?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, Mom. But we <span>canceled</span> it. I'm <span>staying</span> home <span>today</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh. Why did you <span>cancel</span> <span>it</span>?<br/> 
🎧 It's <span>raining</span> outside. Don't you <span>see</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Rain</span> or <span>shine</span>, it doesn't <span>necessarily</span> <span>affect</span> school <span>projects</span>, does <span>it</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Well, it kind of does in this case. Our <span>project</span> is all about the <span>sun</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Interesting</span>! What do you have to do?<br/> 
🎧 We need to <span>track</span> the <span>sun's</span> <span>position<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>throughout</span> the day.<br/> 
🎧 How are you planning to do that?<br/> 
🎧 That's the whole <span>point</span>! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 We have to find a <span>way<br/></span> 
🎧 to <span>measure</span> its <span>movement</span>.<br/> 
🎧 So what is your and <span>Simon's</span> <span>plan</span>?<br/> 
🎧 We are going to use a <span>tree</span> as a <span>marker</span>...<br/> 
🎧 And then?<br/> 
🎧 And then we will <span>measure</span> its <span>shadow</span> to see how the sun <span>moves</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That's <span>actually</span> a <span>clever</span> idea! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I bet you and <span>Simon</span> will get an A for this <span>project</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I'm not sure if it's <span>possible</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Why not?<br/> 
🎧 Because if it <span>continues</span> to <span>rain</span>, we won't get a <span>chance</span> to do our <span>project</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You're right. <span>Hopefully</span>, <span>tomorrow</span> will be <span>sunny</span> for you.<br/> 
🎧 Thank you. <span>Mom</span>.<br/> 

<h2 id="esc-10-627">This is the biggest bookstore in town. </h2>

🎧 Hey, <span>Amy</span>! It's nice to see you <span>here</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Oh, <span>Laura</span>! Hi! What a nice <span>surprise</span>!<br/> 
🎧 What are you doing <span>here</span>?<br/> 
🎧 This is a <span>bookstore</span>. Of course, I'm <span>looking</span> for some <span>books</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Have you <span>found</span> <span>them</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Unfortunately</span>, not <span>yet</span>.<br/> 
🎧 May I see your book <span>list</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Sure, here you <span>go</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, <span>interesting</span> <span>choices</span>.<br/> 
🎧 These are some <span>real</span> <span>classics</span>! <span>But</span>... I don't think you'll find them <span>here</span>.<br/> 
🎧 This is the <span>biggest</span> <span>bookstore</span> in <span>town</span>. I think they would have everything!<br/> 
🎧 <span>True</span>, but these <span>books</span> <span>might<br/></span> 
🎧 be a bit out of <span>print</span>.<br/> 
🎧 They were <span>published</span> quite a while <span>ago</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Um</span>... You're right...<br/> 
🎧 But hey, don't <span>worry</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Our <span>local</span> <span>library</span> probably has them <span>all</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I know, but I want to buy <span>them<br/></span> 
🎧 as a <span>present</span> for my <span>sister's</span> <span>birthday</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I <span>see</span>... Is she a <span>bookworm</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, she <span>reads</span> a <span>lot</span>.<br/> 
🎧 So how about <span>buying</span> her something <span>else</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Like a <span>reading</span> <span>lamp</span>?<br/> 
🎧 You know what, that's <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>actually</span> a great <span>idea</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Thanks for the <span>suggestion</span>.<br/> 

<h2 id="esc-10-718">Things aren't always easy. </h2>

🎧 I <span>heard</span> that you got into some <span>trouble</span> with a <span>client</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Oh, <span>already</span>?<br/> 
🎧 The <span>office</span> <span>gossip</span> sure <span>spreads</span> like <span>wildfire</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Well, it's <span>hard</span> not to hear the <span>argument</span> between you and the <span>boss</span> this <span>morning</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, he <span>left</span> his <span>door</span> open, so I'm sure the whole <span>floor</span> <span>heard</span> <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 So what <span>happened</span>?<br/> 
🎧 My <span>client</span> didn't like my <span>proposal</span>.<br/> 
🎧 She made me change it <span>like</span>... <span>6</span> <span>times</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Six <span>times</span>?<br/> 
🎧 What exactly did she <span>hate<br/></span> 
🎧 about your <span>proposal</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Apparently</span> the <span>cost</span>.<br/> 
🎧 She said it was out of her <span>budget</span>.<br/> 
🎧 And what did you do?<br/> 
🎧 I <span>changed</span> the whole plan <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>completely</span> to fit her <span>budget</span>, <span>but</span>...<br/> 
🎧 <span>But</span>?<br/> 
🎧 But then she didn't like the <span>plan</span>.<br/> 
🎧 She said it was too <span>plain</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Things aren't always easy. She can't have it <span>all</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Funny thing is, that's exactly what I told <span>her</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I <span>guess</span> that didn't go over <span>well</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Absolutely! That's why I got a <span>lecture</span> from the <span>boss</span> this <span>morning</span>.<br/> 

<h2 id="esc-10-801">I have lived in Shanghai for a long time.</h2>

🎧 Hey <span>Nicole</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Hi <span>Lily</span>! How was your day?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Pretty</span> good! How about <span>yours</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Not bad! Are you cooking dinner? It <span>smells</span> <span>amazing</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Yes, I'm <span>making</span> <span>pasta</span>. Do you want <span>some</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Really? That would be great.<br/> 
🎧 Sure, but it'll take another <span>half</span> <span>hour</span> or <span>so</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I can wait all day for your <span>pasta</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, I <span>wonder</span> if <span>Maya</span> would want some as <span>well</span>!<br/> 
🎧 <span>Speaking</span> of <span>Maya</span>, did she tell you?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Maya</span>? About what? I haven't <span>seen</span> her since this <span>morning</span>.<br/> 
🎧 She's <span>moving</span> out at the end of the <span>year</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We should probably <span>start<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>looking</span> for a new <span>roommate</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Wow, that's <span>sudden</span>!<br/> 
🎧 She didn't <span>mention</span> anything to <span>me</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Actually</span>, she just <span>mentioned</span> it to me last <span>night</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe she will tell you <span>later<br/></span> 
🎧 when she comes home.<br/> 
🎧 Did she say why she's <span>moving</span> out?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Apparently</span>, she has to move to <span>Shanghai</span> for work.<br/> 
🎧 Oh wow, that's <span>exciting</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I <span>lived</span> in <span>Shanghai</span> for a long time.<br/> 
🎧 It was an <span>amazing</span> <span>experience</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Really? You should definitely give <span>Maya</span> some <span>tips</span>!<br/> 
🎧 <span>Absolutely</span>!<br/>

🎧 She <span>moved</span> to the <span>UK</span> with her <span>family</span>, didn't <span>she</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, and it <span>feels</span> like she already <span>forgot</span> about <span>me</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We haven't <span>spoken</span> in a <span>week</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Ava</span>, she's probably <span>super</span> <span>busy</span> getting <span>settled</span> <span>in</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You don't get it, <span>Dave</span>!<br/> 
🎧 We always <span>talked</span> every day.<br/> 
🎧 No <span>matter</span> how <span>busy</span> we <span>were</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That was when she <span>lived</span> <span>here</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Give her some time to <span>adjust</span>, <span>trust</span> <span>me</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Fine. I <span>trust</span> you.<br/> 
🎧 But I still don't want <span>dinner</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Ava</span>, you weren't even this bad when you <span>broke</span> up with your <span>ex</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Oh, don't even <span>remind</span> me of that guy!<br/> 
🎧 Okay, okay, <span>sorry</span>!<br/> 
🎧 How about I <span>save</span> you a <span>plate</span>?<br/> 
🎧 You can <span>heat</span> it up <span>whenever</span> you're <span>hungry</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Thanks, <span>Dave</span>. That sounds <span>good</span>.<br/> 

<h2 id="esc-10-984">I'm so hungry!</h2>

🎧 <span>Ben</span>, what are you doing out <span>here</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Oh, <span>Sophie</span>! I'm <span>just</span>... <span>looking</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Looking</span> at what?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Um</span>, those <span>cakes</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Oh, they look <span>delicious</span>!<br/> 
🎧 They do! I'm so <span>hungry</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Why don't you <span>head</span> <span>inside<br/></span> 
🎧 and <span>grab</span> a <span>slice</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I can't really <span>afford</span> it right now.<br/> 
🎧 Why not?<br/> 
🎧 Did you already <span>blow</span> your <span>allowance</span>?<br/> 
🎧 No, I haven't <span>touched</span> <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But I'm <span>saving</span> for a <span>gaming</span> <span>console</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I <span>see</span>...<br/> 
🎧 That's why you're <span>standing</span> outside a <span>bakery</span> and <span>staring</span> <span>longingly</span> at their <span>cakes</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, well, <span>dinner's</span> almost ready <span>anyway</span>, so I shouldn't eat <span>cake</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We could get some for <span>dessert</span>, <span>though</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Don't try to talk me into <span>buying</span> <span>it</span>!<br/> 
🎧 No <span>worries</span>, little <span>brother</span>! It's on <span>me</span>!<br/> 
🎧 <span>Really?</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Why are you <span>suddenly</span> <span>generous</span> <span>today</span>?<br/> 
🎧 What's the <span>occasion</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Because I feel like <span>eating</span> some <span>tasty</span> <span>cakes</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Come on, let's go in and <span>pick</span> your <span>favorite</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Alright, alright! You're the best, <span>sis</span>!<br/> 

<h2 id="esc-10-1066">Time is money.</h2>

🎧 There, <span>finally</span> <span>finished</span> that <span>report</span>!<br/> 
🎧 You look <span>rough</span>, <span>Brandon</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Well, time is <span>money</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I have to <span>invest</span> it in something <span>useful</span>, like my <span>report</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Yes, you're right, but your <span>health</span> is an <span>investment</span> <span>too</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Easy for you to say, <span>Isa</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Some of us have <span>deadlines</span> to <span>meet</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, you <span>seem</span> to <span>meet</span> those <span>deadlines</span> <span>successfully<br/></span> 
🎧 because you look really <span>dead</span> right now!<br/> 
🎧 What do you <span>mean</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Look in the <span>mirror</span>, <span>Brandon</span>!<br/> 
🎧 You look like you haven't <span>slept</span> for <span>weeks</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Well, <span>actually</span>, I haven't <span>slept</span> for only <span>2</span> <span>days</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Oh my <span>goodness</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You go to bed right now!<br/> 
🎧 Come on, it's not that <span>bad</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Let me <span>send</span> out some <span>emails</span> <span>first</span>.<br/> 
🎧 No <span>emails</span> <span>tonight</span>, <span>honey</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's time to <span>wind</span> <span>down</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Your <span>eyes</span> are getting <span>heavy</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Alright, alright! But can I at <span>least</span> <span>brush</span> my <span>teeth</span> <span>first</span>?<br/> 

<h2 id="esc-10-1136">I will get sick from that.</h2>

🎧 Hey, do you <span>mind</span> if I sit <span>here</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Sure, no <span>problem</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Just let me just move my bag a <span>sec</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Thanks</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Wow, your lunch <span>smells</span> <span>amazing</span>!<br/> 
🎧 <span>Thanks</span>!<br/> 
🎧 It's <span>actually</span> <span>leftovers</span> from dinner last <span>night</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You must be a great <span>cook</span>!<br/> 
🎧 <span>Actually</span>, my <span>husband's</span> the one who <span>cooks</span> most of the time.<br/> 
🎧 He's <span>amazing</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Lucky</span> you!<br/> 
🎧 What about you?<br/> 
🎧 What did you <span>pack</span> for <span>lunch</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Fish</span> <span>tacos</span>! Do you want to try a <span>bite</span>?<br/> 
🎧 That's really nice of <span>you<br/></span> 
🎧 But I'll have to <span>pass</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You don't like <span>fish</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Fish</span> <span>upsets</span> my <span>stomach</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I will get <span>sick</span> from that.<br/> 
🎧 Oh no, I'm so <span>sorry</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I had no <span>idea</span>.<br/> 
🎧 No <span>worries</span>! I'm used to <span>it</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Wow, that's <span>tough</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I don't think I could <span>survive</span> without <span>fish</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Well, my <span>husband</span> makes up for it with all <span>sorts</span> of <span>delicious</span> <span>non-fishy</span> <span>dishes</span>, <span>so</span>...<br/> 
🎧 You're right!<br/> 

<h2 id="esc-10-1211">That'll have to wait.</h2>

🎧 Hey, <span>Liam</span>, <span>guess</span> <span>what?</span>!<br/> 
🎧 What's up? <span>Emma</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I'm <span>wondering</span> what can make you that <span>excited</span>.<br/> 
🎧 There's a new <span>vinyl</span> <span>record</span> <span>store</span> that just <span>opened</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Right in the next <span>block</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Sounds <span>cool</span>!<br/> 
🎧 We absolutely have to check it out!<br/> 
🎧 <span>Imagine</span> all the <span>hidden</span> <span>treasures</span> we might <span>find</span>!<br/> 
🎧 You mean right now?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, right now!<br/> 
🎧 <span>That'll</span> have to <span>wait</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'm working on my <span>presentation</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, I thought you were done with that?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Turned</span> out I <span>misunderstood</span> the <span>assignment<br/></span> 
🎧 and now I have to do it all over <span>again</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Sorry</span> to hear that!<br/> 
🎧 Is there any way I can help you?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Um</span>... I'm <span>thirsty</span>?<br/> 
🎧 How about some <span>bubble</span> <span>tea</span>?<br/> 
🎧 That sounds <span>tasty</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Perfect</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'll <span>order</span> some online right now.<br/> 
🎧 In the <span>meantime</span>, want some <span>water</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Sure</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I'll be right <span>back</span>!<br/>

<h2 id="esc-10-1287">She wants to be a dentist.</h2>

🎧 Here is your <span>water</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Thanks, <span>Isa</span>! Where are the <span>kids</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Dave</span> is at his <span>friend's</span> <span>house</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Beth</span> is <span>studying</span> at the <span>library</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, at the <span>library</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Shouldn't she be <span>enjoying</span> the <span>summer</span> <span>break</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Why is she <span>studying</span> so <span>hard</span>?<br/> 
🎧 She <span>wants</span> to be a <span>dentist</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You know, it's a lot of <span>work<br/></span> 
🎧 to become one.<br/> 
🎧 I had no <span>idea</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I always thought she was more into <span>literature</span> and would become a <span>writer</span>.<br/> 
🎧 To be <span>honest</span>, that <span>surprised</span> me, <span>too</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Did you ask her why she <span>wanted</span> to become a <span>dentist</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Well, <span>Beth</span> <span>mentioned</span> that <span>dentists</span> make good money, <span>so</span>...<br/> 
🎧 Well, that's <span>true</span>, <span>although</span> <span>dental</span> school <span>tuition</span> can be <span>incredibly</span> <span>expensive</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Did you talk to her about that?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, we <span>discussed</span> her <span>options</span> and <span>available</span> <span>resources</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Sounds like she's <span>well-informed</span> then!<br/> 
🎧 Well, let's hope <span>so</span>!<br/> 

<h2 id="esc-10-1360">I'm excited about the future.</h2>

🎧 Hey, <span>Wilson</span>!<br/> 
🎧 How's the <span>college</span> <span>application</span> <span>going</span>?<br/>

🎧 It's alright, I <span>sent</span> out my <span>applications</span> last <span>week</span>.<br/> 
🎧 How many <span>colleges</span> did you <span>apply</span> <span>to</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Five</span>. Let's hope I get into one.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Dude</span>, <span>seriously</span>, you'll get into all of <span>them</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Thanks, <span>Eddie</span>! How about you?<br/> 
🎧 I haven't been <span>clear<br/></span> 
🎧 about what I want <span>yet</span>.<br/> 
🎧 So I <span>decided</span> to take a <span>gap</span> <span>year</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Have you made up your <span>mind</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, I've made up my <span>mind</span>.<br/> 
🎧 So what are your <span>plans</span> for the <span>gap</span> <span>year</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I'm going to help my mom out at her <span>bakery</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Cool</span>. What will you do?<br/> 
🎧 I'm going to <span>bake</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Plus</span>, I'll take <span>care</span> of some <span>marketing</span>, <span>too</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>That'll</span> be a lot of work! Are you <span>nervous</span>?<br/> 
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, I'm <span>excited</span> about the <span>future</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'm glad to hear that.<br/>

🎧 Hey <span>Sarah</span>, have you <span>seen</span> the <span>construction</span> <span>site</span>?<br/> 
🎧 No. What's that?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Apparently</span>, they're <span>starting</span> <span>construction</span> next <span>month</span>, right on <span>5th</span> <span>Street</span>.<br/> 
🎧 So what does that mean for <span>us</span>?<br/> 
🎧 That <span>means</span> they're <span>rerouting</span> the bus <span>lane</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, <span>no</span>.<br/> 
🎧 How am I going to get to work?<br/> 
🎧 That's the thing.<br/> 
🎧 your <span>nearest</span> bus <span>stop</span> will be <span>four</span> <span>blocks</span> away once they change the <span>route</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe I can see if they'll let me work from home for a <span>bit</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That's a good <span>idea</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Or you could ask <span>Daniel</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Ask him about what?<br/> 
🎧 He <span>drives</span> to work, and you <span>guys</span> live in the same <span>neighborhood</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>...<br/> 
🎧 Maybe he could give you a <span>ride</span> for a <span>month</span> <span>until</span> things <span>settle</span> <span>down</span>?<br/> 
🎧 That's <span>actually</span> a great idea! I'll definitely ask <span>him</span>.<br/> 

<h2 id="esc-10-1493">I am a football fan.</h2>

🎧 <span>Dude</span>, what's with the long <span>face</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Oh, you wouldn't want to hear that.<br/> 
🎧 Come on, man, <span>spill</span> <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You know I'm your best <span>friend</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's about my <span>birthday</span> <span>presents</span>...<br/> 
🎧 <span>Carry</span> on, I'm all <span>ears</span>...<br/> 
🎧 So, you know, I am a <span>football</span> <span>fan</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, <span>everybody</span> <span>knows</span> you're a <span>football</span> fan. A <span>huge</span> one.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Except</span> for my <span>parents</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, <span>really</span>?<br/> 
🎧 They got me a <span>ticket</span> to a <span>basketball</span> game and a <span>pair</span> of <span>basketball</span> <span>sneakers</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Ouch</span>, that's <span>bad</span>...<br/> 
🎧 Sounds like someone got their <span>sports</span> <span>mixed</span> up.<br/> 
🎧 They're the <span>basketball</span> <span>fans</span>, aren't <span>they</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Bingo</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Did you tell them how you're <span>feeling</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, but things got a bit <span>heated</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Hence</span> the <span>grumpy</span> <span>face</span>.<br/> 

<h2 id="esc-10-1559">I have a small house.</h2>

🎧 I'm <span>looking</span> for some <span>ideas</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Ideas</span> about what?<br/> 
🎧 House <span>renovation</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I have a small house, and I'm thinking of <span>renovating</span> <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, <span>cool</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What made you decide on a <span>renovation</span>?<br/> 
🎧 It is a bit old. I got it so <span>cheap</span> <span>though</span>.<br/> 
🎧 So, I <span>guess</span> there is <span>nothing</span> to <span>complain</span> <span>about</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Do you have any <span>photos</span> on you? I'd love to see <span>it</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Not right now, but I'll take some and <span>show</span> them to you <span>tomorrow</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Great</span>.<br/> 
🎧 And, are you going to do it <span>yourself</span> or <span>hire</span> a <span>pro</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I'm still thinking about <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Renovations</span> can get <span>expensive</span>, and I'm not sure my <span>budget</span> can <span>handle</span> <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That's <span>true</span>. They can definitely add <span>up.<br/>
