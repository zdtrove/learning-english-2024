<h2>A Day In My Life</h2>

🎧 Hey, <span>Brie</span>! How's the new <span>apartment?<br/>
</span> 🎧 It's great, but I need some <span>furniture.<br/>
</span> 🎧 What do you <span>need?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Probably a <span>sofa</span> and some <span>lamps.<br/>
</span> 🎧 I'm also <span>looking</span> for a <span>bookshelf.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span>, there's a <span>garage</span> <span>sale</span> down the <span>street.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Wanna go with <span>me?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Sure. <span>When?<br/>
</span> 🎧 How about today, after <span>work?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Sounds good. Let's go up to <span>work.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Awesome.<br/>
</span> 🎧 I have to get back to work <span>now.<br/>
</span> 🎧 See you <span>later.<br/>
</span> 🎧 See <span>ya.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Look, <span>Brie</span>! That <span>sofa</span> is <span>nice.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Yeah, and it's the right <span>size.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Excuse</span> me, how much is this <span>sofa?<br/>
</span> 🎧 It's <span>$40.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Can I take a <span>closer</span> <span>look?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Sure, go <span>ahead.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Elle</span>, what do you <span>think?<br/>
</span> 🎧 I like it, but <span>$40</span> is a bit <span>much.<br/>
</span> 🎧 You're <span>right.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Do you have any <span>lamps?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Yes, over there. <span>$10</span> <span>each.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span>, this one is <span>nice.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Is it in good <span>condition?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Yes, it <span>works</span> <span>perfectly.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Hardly</span> <span>used.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Does it come with <span>extra</span> <span>bulbs?<br/>
</span> 🎧 I can give you two <span>extra</span> <span>bulbs</span> with <span>each.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Can I take both the <span>sofa</span> and the <span>lamps</span> for <span>$50?<br/>
</span> 🎧 How about <span>$55?<br/>
</span> 🎧 How could you do <span>$52?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Alright, <span>$52</span> it <span>is!<br/>
</span> 🎧 For the <span>sofa</span>, two <span>lamps</span>, and <span>four</span> <span>extra</span> <span>bulbs.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Thank you. Here you <span>are.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Thanks! Here is your <span>change!<br/>
</span> 🎧 Thank you! Can you help me <span>carry</span> them to the <span>car?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Of <span>course.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Hi! <span>Excuse</span> <span>me!<br/>
</span> 🎧 Yes? How can I help <span>you?<br/>
</span> 🎧 I'm <span>Brie</span>. I just <span>moved</span> into <span>room</span> <span>405</span> last <span>week.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Nice to <span>meet</span> <span>you!<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span>, so you <span>must</span> be my <span>next-door</span> <span>neighbor!<br/>
</span> 🎧 I'm <span>Sam</span>, in <span>room</span> <span>406.<br/>
</span> 🎧 That's <span>awesome!<br/>
</span> 🎧 If you need anything, feel free to ask me, <span>Brie!<br/>
</span> 🎧 Well, <span>actually</span>, <span>yes.<br/>
</span> 🎧 I want to ask you about <span>something...<br/>
</span> 🎧 About <span>what?<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Someone</span> is <span>smoking</span> a lot, and the <span>smell</span> comes into my <span>apartment.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span>, that's not <span>good.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Do you know who it <span>is?<br/>
</span> 🎧 No, I'm not <span>sure.<br/>
</span> 🎧 It's really <span>strong</span> in the <span>evening.<br/>
</span> 🎧 I've <span>noticed</span> it, too. It's <span>annoying.<br/>
</span> 🎧 I want to <span>file</span> a <span>complaint</span> with the <span>building</span> <span>manager.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Do you think it'll <span>help?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Yes, it might <span>help.<br/>
</span> 🎧 The <span>manager</span> should know about <span>it.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Have you <span>talked</span> to the <span>manager</span> <span>before?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Yes, I <span>have.<br/>
</span> 🎧 The <span>manager</span> is nice and <span>listens</span> to <span>problems.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span>, that's good to <span>know.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Can you come with me to talk to the <span>manager?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Sure, I can do <span>that.<br/>
</span> 🎧 When do you want to <span>go?<br/>
</span> 🎧 How about <span>tomorrow</span> <span>morning?<br/>
</span> 🎧 That <span>works</span> for <span>me.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Let's <span>meet</span> at <span>9</span> <span>am.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Great, thank you, <span>Sam</span>. See you <span>tomorrow.<br/>
</span> 🎧 See you <span>tomorrow</span>, <span>Brie</span>. We'll get this <span>sorted</span> <span>out.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Hi, <span>excuse</span> me. I need to <span>return</span> this <span>toaster.<br/>
</span> 🎧 I just <span>bought</span> it last <span>week.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Sure, what's the <span>problem</span> with <span>it?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Well, it won't <span>turn</span> <span>on.<br/>
</span> 🎧 I <span>tried</span>, but <span>nothing</span> <span>happens.<br/>
</span> 🎧 I think it's <span>broken!<br/>
</span> 🎧 I'm <span>sorry</span> to hear <span>that!<br/>
</span> 🎧 Do you have the <span>receipt</span> with <span>you?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Yes. Here it <span>is.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Thank you! I'll check the <span>toaster</span> to see what the <span>problem</span> <span>is.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Yes, <span>please.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Could you tell me how you were trying to <span>turn</span> it <span>on?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Well, I <span>plugged</span> it <span>in...<br/>
</span> 🎧 And <span>then.<br/>
</span> 🎧 I put two <span>pieces</span> of <span>bread</span> <span>in..</span>. and <span>waited..</span>. but <span>nothing</span> <span>happened.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span>, I see the <span>issue</span> <span>here.<br/>
</span> 🎧 What is <span>it?<br/>
</span> 🎧 The <span>toaster</span> is <span>plugged</span> in, but the <span>switch</span> isn't <span>turned</span> <span>on.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span>, what <span>switch?<br/>
</span> 🎧 It's right <span>here.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span>, is that a <span>switch?<br/>
</span> 🎧 I thought it was a <span>timer</span> or <span>something!<br/>
</span> 🎧 The <span>timer</span> is this <span>one.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span>. How <span>strange!<br/>
</span> 🎧 My <span>previous</span> <span>toaster</span> was from this <span>brand</span> <span>too,<br/>
</span> 🎧 but I didn't have to <span>turn</span> on a <span>switch.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Yes. You're <span>right.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>However</span>, this is the <span>latest</span> <span>model</span> and it comes with a <span>switch</span> for <span>safety</span> <span>reasons.<br/>
</span> 🎧 I see. Thank you for <span>pointing</span> that out! I feel so <span>silly.<br/>
</span> 🎧 It <span>happens</span> to <span>everyone.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Is there anything else I can help you <span>with?<br/>
</span> 🎧 No. That's <span>all.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Thank you for your <span>help.<br/>
</span> 🎧 You're <span>welcome.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Have a great <span>day.<br/>
</span> 🎧 You too! Thanks <span>again.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Hi, <span>Brie</span>! Can I sit <span>here?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Of <span>course!<br/>
</span> 🎧 You <span>seem</span> a bit <span>upset</span>. What's <span>wrong?<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span>, I just had a <span>terrible</span> <span>morning.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span>, what <span>happened?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Do you know I was <span>supposed</span> to have an <span>important</span> <span>meeting</span> this <span>morning?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Yes! Was it the <span>meeting</span> with your <span>client?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Yes! The <span>client</span> <span>wanted</span> to hear about our <span>marketing</span> plan for his <span>upcoming</span> <span>product.<br/>
</span> 🎧 I was a <span>presenter.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Was he <span>unhappy</span> with your <span>plan?<br/>
</span> 🎧 No, he wasn't happy or <span>unhappy.<br/>
</span> 🎧 So what <span>happened?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Did you not <span>finish</span> it in <span>time?<br/>
</span> 🎧 I <span>finished</span> the plan <span>three</span> <span>days</span> before the <span>meeting</span>! <span>But...<br/>
</span> 🎧 But <span>what?<br/>
</span> 🎧 My <span>laptop</span> <span>decided</span> to <span>update</span> <span>Windows</span> right before the <span>meeting!!!<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span>, no. What <span>happened</span> <span>next?<br/>
</span> 🎧 I had to <span>present</span> with no <span>slides.<br/>
</span> 🎧 It was <span>hard</span> to <span>convince</span> my <span>client</span> without <span>them!<br/>
</span> 🎧 That sounds like a <span>nightmare!<br/>
</span> 🎧 What did your <span>boss</span> <span>say?<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span>, he was <span>speechless</span> during the <span>meeting.<br/>
</span> 🎧 How about <span>afterward?<br/>
</span> 🎧 He gave me an <span>earful</span> right after the <span>meeting</span> <span>ended.<br/>
</span> 🎧 He said I was <span>unprofessional</span> for not having a <span>backup.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Well..</span>. I have to <span>agree.<br/>
</span> 🎧 You should have a <span>backup</span> plan <span>saved</span> <span>somewhere</span> <span>else.<br/>
</span> 🎧 I know. I've <span>learned</span> my <span>lesson...<br/>
</span> 🎧 What did the <span>client</span> <span>say?<br/>
</span> 🎧 He was <span>confused</span>, but more <span>understanding</span> than my <span>boss.<br/>
</span> 🎧 He told me to <span>email</span> him the plan <span>later.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span>, how nice! Did you <span>send</span> it to <span>him?<br/>
</span> 🎧 I <span>already</span> <span>did.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span>. That's <span>rough.<br/>
</span> 🎧 How about a <span>coffee</span> to help you <span>relax?<br/>
</span> 🎧 My <span>treat!<br/>
</span> 🎧 Well, I'd rather have something <span>sweet</span> right <span>now.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span>, would you like some <span>orange</span> <span>juice?<br/>
</span> 🎧 That sounds <span>refreshing.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Wait here! I'll be back <span>soon!<br/>
</span> 🎧 Thanks, <span>Elle</span>! You're so <span>nice!<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span>, good morning, <span>Brie</span>! It's <span>rare</span> to see you this <span>early!<br/>
</span> 🎧 Hi, <span>Sam</span>! I just got back from my morning <span>run!<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span>, I wish I had your <span>motivation.<br/>
</span> 🎧 I just <span>started</span> a few <span>days</span> <span>ago.<br/>
</span> 🎧 I want to <span>lose</span> some <span>extra</span> <span>weight</span> after the <span>holiday.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Me too! I've <span>gained</span> <span>4</span> <span>pounds</span> after the <span>holiday!<br/>
</span> 🎧 Do you want to join <span>me?<br/>
</span> 🎧 No, thanks! There's no way I can get up that <span>early.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Do you run in the <span>afternoon?<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Actually</span>, I don't <span>run.<br/>
</span> 🎧 I go to the <span>gym.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Really? Where is <span>it?<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span>, it's right around the <span>corner.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span>, <span>cool</span>. What's it <span>called?<br/>
</span> 🎧 It's <span>called</span> <span>Elite</span> <span>Fitness.<br/>
</span> 🎧 It <span>sounds..</span>. <span>expensive!<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span>, it's <span>actually</span> <span>affordable.<br/>
</span> 🎧 I can <span>send</span> you their <span>membership</span> <span>fee</span> if you're <span>interested!<br/>
</span> 🎧 Yes, please! And how is the <span>equipment?<br/>
</span> 🎧 They have a lot of <span>equipment</span> and great <span>classes.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Plus</span>, the <span>trainers</span> are really <span>nice.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span>, that's great because I have no idea how to use the gym <span>equipment.<br/>
</span> 🎧 I'm sure you'll find some good <span>trainers</span> <span>there!<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Cool</span>! Do they have a free <span>trial?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Yes, they do. You can try it for a week for <span>free.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Perfect.<br/>
</span> 🎧 How do I <span>sign</span> up for the <span>trial?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Just go to the gym and ask at the <span>front</span> <span>desk.<br/>
</span> 🎧 They'll set you <span>up.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Thanks, <span>Sam</span>. I'll check it <span>out!<br/>
</span> 🎧 You're <span>welcome!<br/>
</span> 🎧 Hi, <span>Mom!<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span>, <span>Brie</span>! How are you, <span>sweetie?<br/>
</span> 🎧 I'm great, Mom! How are <span>you?<br/>
</span> 🎧 I'm <span>amazing</span>, just <span>missing</span> you a <span>lot!<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Haha</span>, me too, Mom! I really <span>miss</span> <span>you!<br/>
</span> 🎧 How's your new <span>job</span> <span>going?<br/>
</span> 🎧 It's going <span>great!<br/>
</span> 🎧 In <span>fact</span>, I've just been <span>invited</span> to a <span>party</span> with my new <span>colleagues</span> this <span>weekend!<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span>, that sounds <span>lovely.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Yes, it <span>is.<br/>
</span> 🎧 But, Mom, there's a <span>problem!<br/>
</span> 🎧 What's <span>that?<br/>
</span> 🎧 It's a <span>potluck</span> <span>party</span>, and I don't know what to <span>bring</span>! I need your <span>help!<br/>
</span> 🎧 Sure, I can <span>help.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Do you know what other people are <span>bringing?<br/>
</span> 🎧 No, I <span>don't.<br/>
</span> 🎧 They didn't say <span>anything.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Maybe <span>bring</span> something <span>simple</span>, but <span>tasty.<br/>
</span> 🎧 How about a <span>salad?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Don't you think a <span>salad</span> is a bit <span>plain?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Well, a <span>salad</span> can be great if you know how to make it <span>right!<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Mom..</span>. You know I'm a <span>terrible</span> <span>cook</span>, <span>right?<br/>
</span> 🎧 I'll help you, <span>honey</span>, don't <span>worry!<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Okay</span>! So, what kind of <span>salad</span> should I <span>make?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Let's make a <span>pasta</span> <span>salad.<br/>
</span> 🎧 It's <span>easy</span> to <span>prepare</span>, but very <span>tasty!<br/>
</span> 🎧 I'll <span>send</span> you my special <span>recipe!<br/>
</span> 🎧 That sounds great! So, what do I <span>need?<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Pasta</span>, <span>cherry</span> <span>tomatoes</span>, <span>cucumbers</span>, <span>olives</span>, and some <span>cheese.<br/>
</span> 🎧 You can use a <span>simple</span> <span>dressing</span> like <span>Italian.<br/>
</span> 🎧 And do I just put everything in a <span>bowl</span> and mix <span>it?<br/>
</span> 🎧 No, <span>Brie</span>! You'll have to <span>chop</span> them up <span>first.<br/>
</span> 🎧 That sounds like a <span>hassle!<br/>
</span> 🎧 Well, how about I <span>stop</span> by <span>tomorrow</span> and help you make <span>it?<br/>
</span> 🎧 That would be great, <span>mom.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Good morning, <span>Brie!<br/>
</span> 🎧 Good morning, <span>Ian!<br/>
</span> 🎧 How is your <span>weekend?<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Amazing</span>! I went <span>fishing</span> with my <span>friends.<br/>
</span> 🎧 How about <span>you?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Did you go on a <span>shopping</span> <span>spree?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Yes, I did! There was a great <span>sale</span> at the <span>mall</span> last <span>week!<br/>
</span> 🎧 But how did you <span>know?<br/>
</span> 🎧 Well, the tag on your <span>shirt</span> is <span>showing...<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span> my! How <span>embarrassing!<br/>
</span> 🎧 I <span>must</span> have <span>forgotten</span> to <span>remove</span> it before <span>washing.<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Haha</span>, it <span>happens</span> to me sometimes <span>too!<br/>
</span> 🎧 <span>Oh</span>, thank you for <span>telling</span> <span>me!<br/>
</span> 🎧 If you were my <span>client</span>, I'd probably <span>quit</span> my <span>job</span> out of <span>embarrassment!<br/>
</span> 🎧 If that were the <span>case,<br/>
</span> 🎧 you should definitely go to the <span>restroom</span> and fix it quickly before the morning <span>meeting.<br/>
</span> 🎧 You're right! Do you have a <span>pair</span> of <span>scissors?<br/>
</span> 🎧 No, I <span>don't.<br/>
</span> 🎧 But there should be a <span>pair</span> in the <span>photocopy</span> <span>room.<br/>
</span> 🎧 I think it's on the <span>counter.<br/>
</span> 🎧 Thanks! You're a <span>lifesaver!<br/>
</span> 🎧 You're <span>welcome</span>, <span>Brie!<br/>
</span><br/><br/>
