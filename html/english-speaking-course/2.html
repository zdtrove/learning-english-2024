<h2>A Day In My Life</h2>

🎧 Hey, <span>Brie</span>! How's the new <span>apartment</span>?<br/> 
🎧 It's great, but I need some <span>furniture</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What do you <span>need</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Probably a <span>sofa</span> and some <span>lamps</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'm also looking for a <span>bookshelf</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, there's a <span>garage</span> <span>sale</span> down the <span>street</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Wanna go with me?<br/> 
🎧 Sure. <span>When</span>?<br/> 
🎧 How about today, after work?<br/> 
🎧 Sounds good. Let's go up to work.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Awesome</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I have to get back to work now.<br/> 
🎧 See you later.<br/> 
🎧 See <span>ya</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Look, <span>Brie</span>! That <span>sofa</span> is nice.<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, and it's the right <span>size</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Excuse</span> me, how much is this <span>sofa</span>?<br/> 
🎧 It's <span>$40</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Can I take a <span>closer</span> <span>look</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Sure, go <span>ahead</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Elle</span>, what do you <span>think</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I like it, but <span>$40</span> is a bit much.<br/> 
🎧 You're right.<br/> 
🎧 Do you have any <span>lamps</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, over there. <span>$10</span> <span>each</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, this one is nice.<br/> 
🎧 Is it in good <span>condition</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, it <span>works</span> <span>perfectly</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Hardly</span> <span>used</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Does it come with <span>extra</span> <span>bulbs</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I can give you two <span>extra</span> <span>bulbs</span> with <span>each</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Can I take both the <span>sofa</span> and the <span>lamps</span> for <span>$50</span>?<br/> 
🎧 How about <span>$55</span>?<br/> 
🎧 How could you do <span>$52</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Alright, <span>$52</span> it <span>is</span>!<br/> 
🎧 For the <span>sofa</span>, two <span>lamps</span>, and <span>four</span> <span>extra</span> <span>bulbs</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Thank you. Here you are.<br/> 
🎧 Thanks! Here is your <span>change</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Thank you! Can you help me <span>carry</span> them to the <span>car</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Of course.<br/> 
🎧 Hi! <span>Excuse</span> me!<br/> 
🎧 Yes? How can I help you?<br/> 
🎧 I'm <span>Brie</span>. I just <span>moved</span> into room <span>405</span> last <span>week</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Nice to meet you!<br/> 
🎧 Oh, so you must be my <span>next-door</span> <span>neighbor</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I'm <span>Sam</span>, in room <span>406</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That's <span>awesome</span>!<br/> 
🎧 If you need anything, feel free to ask me, <span>Brie</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Well, actually, <span>yes</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I want to ask you about <span>something</span>...<br/> 
🎧 About what?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Someone</span> is <span>smoking</span> a lot, and the <span>smell</span> comes into my <span>apartment</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, that's not good.<br/> 
🎧 Do you know who it <span>is</span>?<br/> 
🎧 No, I'm not <span>sure</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's really <span>strong</span> in the <span>evening</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I've <span>noticed</span> it, too. It's <span>annoying</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I want to <span>file</span> a <span>complaint</span> with the <span>building</span> <span>manager</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Do you think it'll help?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, it might help.<br/> 
🎧 The <span>manager</span> should know about <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Have you <span>talked</span> to the <span>manager</span> before?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, I <span>have</span>.<br/> 
🎧 The <span>manager</span> is nice and <span>listens</span> to <span>problems</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, that's good to know.<br/> 
🎧 Can you come with me to talk to the <span>manager</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Sure, I can do that.<br/> 
🎧 When do you want to <span>go</span>?<br/> 
🎧 How about <span>tomorrow</span> <span>morning</span>?<br/> 
🎧 That <span>works</span> for me.<br/> 
🎧 Let's meet at <span>9</span> <span>am</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Great, thank you, <span>Sam</span>. See you <span>tomorrow</span>.<br/> 
🎧 See you <span>tomorrow</span>, <span>Brie</span>. We'll get this <span>sorted</span> out.<br/> 
🎧 Hi, <span>excuse</span> me. I need to <span>return</span> this <span>toaster</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I just <span>bought</span> it last <span>week</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Sure, what's the <span>problem</span> with <span>it</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Well, it won't <span>turn</span> <span>on</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I <span>tried</span>, but <span>nothing</span> <span>happens</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I think it's <span>broken</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I'm sorry to hear that!<br/> 
🎧 Do you have the <span>receipt</span> with you?<br/> 
🎧 Yes. Here it <span>is</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Thank you! I'll check the <span>toaster</span> to see what the <span>problem</span> <span>is</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Yes, please.<br/> 
🎧 Could you tell me how you were trying to <span>turn</span> it <span>on</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Well, I <span>plugged</span> it in...<br/> 
🎧 And then.<br/> 
🎧 I put two <span>pieces</span> of <span>bread</span> in... and <span>waited</span>... but <span>nothing</span> <span>happened</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, I see the issue here.<br/> 
🎧 What is <span>it</span>?<br/> 
🎧 The <span>toaster</span> is <span>plugged</span> in, but the <span>switch</span> isn't <span>turned</span> <span>on</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, what <span>switch</span>?<br/> 
🎧 It's right here.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, is that a <span>switch</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I thought it was a <span>timer</span> or <span>something</span>!<br/> 
🎧 The <span>timer</span> is this one.<br/> 
🎧 Oh. How <span>strange</span>!<br/> 
🎧 My <span>previous</span> <span>toaster</span> was from this <span>brand</span> too,<br/> 
🎧 but I didn't have to <span>turn</span> on a <span>switch</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Yes. You're right.<br/> 
🎧 <span>However</span>, this is the <span>latest</span> <span>model</span> and it comes with a <span>switch</span> for <span>safety</span> <span>reasons</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I see. Thank you for <span>pointing</span> that out! I feel so <span>silly</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It <span>happens</span> to <span>everyone</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Is there anything else I can help you <span>with</span>?<br/> 
🎧 No. That's <span>all</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Thank you for your help.<br/> 
🎧 You're <span>welcome</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Have a great day.<br/> 
🎧 You too! Thanks <span>again</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Hi, <span>Brie</span>! Can I sit here?<br/> 
🎧 Of course!<br/> 
🎧 You <span>seem</span> a bit <span>upset</span>. What's <span>wrong</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Oh, I just had a <span>terrible</span> <span>morning</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, what <span>happened</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Do you know I was <span>supposed</span> to have an <span>important</span> <span>meeting</span> this <span>morning</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yes! Was it the <span>meeting</span> with your <span>client</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yes! The <span>client</span> wanted to hear about our <span>marketing</span> plan for his <span>upcoming</span> <span>product</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I was a <span>presenter</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Was he <span>unhappy</span> with your <span>plan</span>?<br/> 
🎧 No, he wasn't happy or <span>unhappy</span>.<br/> 
🎧 So what <span>happened</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Did you not <span>finish</span> it in time?<br/> 
🎧 I <span>finished</span> the plan <span>three</span> <span>days</span> before the <span>meeting</span>! <span>But</span>...<br/> 
🎧 But what?<br/> 
🎧 My <span>laptop</span> <span>decided</span> to <span>update</span> <span>Windows</span> right before the <span>meeting</span>!!!<br/> 
🎧 Oh, no. What <span>happened</span> <span>next</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I had to <span>present</span> with no <span>slides</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It was <span>hard</span> to <span>convince</span> my <span>client</span> without them!<br/> 
🎧 That sounds like a <span>nightmare</span>!<br/> 
🎧 What did your <span>boss</span> <span>say</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Oh, he was <span>speechless</span> during the <span>meeting</span>.<br/> 
🎧 How about <span>afterward</span>?<br/> 
🎧 He gave me an <span>earful</span> right after the <span>meeting</span> <span>ended</span>.<br/> 
🎧 He said I was <span>unprofessional</span> for not having a <span>backup</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Well</span>... I have to agree.<br/> 
🎧 You should have a <span>backup</span> plan <span>saved</span> somewhere <span>else</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I know. I've <span>learned</span> my <span>lesson</span>...<br/> 
🎧 What did the <span>client</span> <span>say</span>?<br/> 
🎧 He was <span>confused</span>, but more <span>understanding</span> than my <span>boss</span>.<br/> 
🎧 He told me to <span>email</span> him the plan later.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, how nice! Did you <span>send</span> it to <span>him</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I already <span>did</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh. That's <span>rough</span>.<br/> 
🎧 How about a <span>coffee</span> to help you <span>relax</span>?<br/> 
🎧 My <span>treat</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Well, I'd rather have something <span>sweet</span> right now.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, would you like some <span>orange</span> <span>juice</span>?<br/> 
🎧 That sounds <span>refreshing</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Wait here! I'll be back <span>soon</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Thanks, <span>Elle</span>! You're so nice!<br/> 
🎧 Oh, good morning, <span>Brie</span>! It's <span>rare</span> to see you this <span>early</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Hi, <span>Sam</span>! I just got back from my morning <span>run</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Oh, I wish I had your <span>motivation</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I just <span>started</span> a few <span>days</span> <span>ago</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I want to <span>lose</span> some <span>extra</span> <span>weight</span> after the <span>holiday</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Me too! I've <span>gained</span> <span>4</span> <span>pounds</span> after the <span>holiday</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Do you want to join me?<br/> 
🎧 No, thanks! There's no way I can get up that <span>early</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Do you run in the <span>afternoon</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Actually, I don't <span>run</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I go to the <span>gym</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Really? Where is <span>it</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Oh, it's right around the <span>corner</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, <span>cool</span>. What's it called?<br/> 
🎧 It's called <span>Elite</span> <span>Fitness</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It <span>sounds</span>... <span>expensive</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Oh, it's actually <span>affordable</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I can <span>send</span> you their <span>membership</span> <span>fee</span> if you're interested!<br/> 
🎧 Yes, please! And how is the <span>equipment</span>?<br/> 
🎧 They have a lot of <span>equipment</span> and great <span>classes</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Plus</span>, the <span>trainers</span> are really nice.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, that's great because I have no idea how to use the gym <span>equipment</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'm sure you'll find some good <span>trainers</span> there!<br/> 
🎧 <span>Cool</span>! Do they have a free <span>trial</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, they do. You can try it for a week for <span>free</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Perfect.<br/> 
🎧 How do I <span>sign</span> up for the <span>trial</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Just go to the gym and ask at the <span>front</span> <span>desk</span>.<br/> 
🎧 They'll set you up.<br/> 
🎧 Thanks, <span>Sam</span>. I'll check it out!<br/> 
🎧 You're <span>welcome</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Hi, <span>Mom</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Oh, <span>Brie</span>! How are you, <span>sweetie</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I'm great, Mom! How are you?<br/> 
🎧 I'm <span>amazing</span>, just <span>missing</span> you a lot!<br/> 
🎧 <span>Haha</span>, me too, Mom! I really <span>miss</span> you!<br/> 
🎧 How's your new <span>job</span> <span>going</span>?<br/> 
🎧 It's going great!<br/> 
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, I've just been <span>invited</span> to a <span>party</span> with my new <span>colleagues</span> this weekend!<br/> 
🎧 Oh, that sounds <span>lovely</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Yes, it <span>is</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But, Mom, there's a <span>problem</span>!<br/> 
🎧 What's that?<br/> 
🎧 It's a <span>potluck</span> <span>party</span>, and I don't know what to <span>bring</span>! I need your help!<br/> 
🎧 Sure, I can help.<br/> 
🎧 Do you know what other people are <span>bringing</span>?<br/> 
🎧 No, I don't.<br/> 
🎧 They didn't say <span>anything</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe <span>bring</span> something simple, but <span>tasty</span>.<br/> 
🎧 How about a <span>salad</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Don't you think a <span>salad</span> is a bit <span>plain</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Well, a <span>salad</span> can be great if you know how to make it right!<br/> 
🎧 <span>Mom</span>... You know I'm a <span>terrible</span> <span>cook</span>, right?<br/> 
🎧 I'll help you, <span>honey</span>, don't <span>worry</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Okay! So, what kind of <span>salad</span> should I <span>make</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Let's make a <span>pasta</span> <span>salad</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's easy to <span>prepare</span>, but very <span>tasty</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I'll <span>send</span> you my special <span>recipe</span>!<br/> 
🎧 That sounds great! So, what do I <span>need</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Pasta</span>, <span>cherry</span> <span>tomatoes</span>, <span>cucumbers</span>, <span>olives</span>, and some <span>cheese</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You can use a simple <span>dressing</span> like <span>Italian</span>.<br/> 
🎧 And do I just put everything in a <span>bowl</span> and mix <span>it</span>?<br/> 
🎧 No, <span>Brie</span>! You'll have to <span>chop</span> them up <span>first</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That sounds like a <span>hassle</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Well, how about I <span>stop</span> by <span>tomorrow</span> and help you make <span>it</span>?<br/> 
🎧 That would be great, <span>mom</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Good morning, <span>Brie</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Good morning, <span>Ian</span>!<br/> 
🎧 How is your weekend?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Amazing</span>! I went <span>fishing</span> with my <span>friends</span>.<br/> 
🎧 How about you?<br/> 
🎧 Did you go on a <span>shopping</span> <span>spree</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, I did! There was a great <span>sale</span> at the <span>mall</span> last <span>week</span>!<br/> 
🎧 But how did you know?<br/> 
🎧 Well, the tag on your <span>shirt</span> is <span>showing</span>...<br/> 
🎧 Oh my! How <span>embarrassing</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I must have <span>forgotten</span> to <span>remove</span> it before <span>washing</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Haha</span>, it <span>happens</span> to me sometimes too!<br/> 
🎧 Oh, thank you for <span>telling</span> me!<br/> 
🎧 If you were my <span>client</span>, I'd probably <span>quit</span> my <span>job</span> out of <span>embarrassment</span>!<br/> 
🎧 If that were the <span>case</span>,<br/> 
🎧 you should definitely go to the <span>restroom</span> and fix it quickly before the morning <span>meeting</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You're right! Do you have a <span>pair</span> of <span>scissors</span>?<br/> 
🎧 No, I don't.<br/> 
🎧 But there should be a <span>pair</span> in the <span>photocopy</span> room.<br/> 
🎧 I think it's on the <span>counter</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Thanks! You're a <span>lifesaver</span>!<br/> 
🎧 You're <span>welcome</span>, <span>Brie</span>!<br/><br/><br/>
