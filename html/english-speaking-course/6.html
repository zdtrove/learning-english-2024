🎧 Good <span>evening</span>! <span>Fancy</span> <span>Dining</span>.<br/> 
🎧 How can I help you?<br/> 
🎧 Hi! I would like to make a <span>reservation</span> for <span>dinner</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Great! May I know how many <span>people</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Well, that will be just me and my <span>hunger</span>. So... just one, <span>please</span>.<br/> 
🎧 A <span>table</span> for one? Wow, what a <span>bold</span> <span>move</span>!<br/> 
🎧 What time would you and your <span>hunger</span> like to <span>come</span>?<br/> 
🎧 We would probably show up at <span>7</span> pm. I'll be <span>fashionably</span> <span>early</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Unfortunately</span>, Sir, our <span>restaurant</span> is <span>fully</span> <span>booked</span> at <span>7</span> <span>pm</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Would you <span>mind</span> <span>coming</span> a bit later, like <span>8</span> <span>pm</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I <span>guess</span> I have no <span>choice</span>. Fine, <span>8</span> pm it <span>is</span>!<br/> 
🎧 So, a <span>table</span> for you and your <span>hunger</span> at <span>8</span> <span>pm</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Do you have any special <span>requests</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yes. Can I sit by the <span>window</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I need good <span>lighting</span> for my food <span>selfies</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Of course! <span>We'll</span> make sure your food <span>shines</span> as <span>bright</span> as you do.<br/> 
🎧 Perfect. Should I <span>dress</span> <span>fancy</span>, or can I <span>rock</span> my <span>pyjamas</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>We're</span> all about <span>style</span>, but maybe <span>save</span> the <span>pyjamas</span> for <span>Netflix</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Wise</span> <span>words</span>! That will be well <span>noted</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Well, thank you, see you at <span>8</span>!<br/> 
🎧 You're <span>welcome</span>, Sir! <span>Looking</span> forward to <span>it</span>!<br/> <br/> 

<h2 id="esc-6-102">Arriving at the Restaurant <b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this, 102)">🔊</b></h2>

🎧 Good <span>evening</span>! <span>Welcome</span> to <span>Gourmet</span> <span>Delights</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Do you have a <span>reservation</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Hi! No, we're just <span>walk-ins</span>. Is that okay?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Walk-ins</span>? <span>You're</span> living <span>dangerously</span>, I like <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Let me <span>see</span>... Ah, you're in <span>luck</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I can get you a <span>table</span> right <span>away</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Perfect! I hope the food comes as <span>fast</span> as the <span>table</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Well, our <span>chef</span> <span>moves</span> <span>fast</span>, but don't <span>expect</span> <span>magic</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Follow</span> me, <span>please</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Ooh</span>, a <span>table</span> by the <span>window</span>! Isn't it great?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, it's great for watching <span>people's</span> <span>heads</span> while we <span>eat</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Well, <span>people-watching</span> is a <span>part</span> of fine <span>dining</span>, isn't <span>it</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Here are your <span>menus</span>!<br/> 
🎧 <span>Thanks</span>!<br/> 
🎧 <span>Honey</span>, be <span>careful</span>, please try not to <span>spill</span> anything on it this time.<br/> 
🎧 It's not like I have a <span>glass</span> of <span>wine</span> in my <span>hand</span> right now!<br/> 
🎧 Oh, please don't!<br/> 
🎧 I think our <span>menus</span> have had enough <span>wine</span> for <span>today</span>.<br/> 
🎧 They're a bit <span>tipsy</span> already, in <span>fact</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Well, if so, I'd be more <span>careful</span>!<br/> <br/> 

<h2 id="esc-6-189">Asking for Recommendations <b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this, 189)">🔊</b></h2>

🎧 Hi there! I'll be your <span>server</span> <span>tonight</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Can I start you off with some <span>drinks</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Actually, I'm <span>clueless</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What do you <span>recommend</span> for someone who is bad at <span>making</span> <span>decisions</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I'd say the <span>pasta</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's <span>delicious</span>, and you can't go wrong with <span>carbs</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That sounds great, but what if I <span>regret</span> it <span>halfway</span>?<br/> 
🎧 You won't. But if you do, we'll just <span>bring</span> more <span>bread</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Sold</span>! <span>Pasta</span> it <span>is</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But wait, what about <span>dessert</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Oh, we have an amazing <span>chocolate</span> <span>cake</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's like a hug, but from inside your <span>stomach</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That's exactly what I need after this long day.<br/> 
🎧 <span>You're</span> a <span>lifesaver</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Just doing my <span>part</span> to keep the <span>world</span> <span>happy</span>.<br/> 
🎧 One <span>slice</span> of <span>cake</span> at a time.<br/> <br/> 

<h2 id="esc-6-251">Changing the Order <b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this, 251)">🔊</b></h2>

🎧 So one garden <span>salad</span>, one <span>grilled</span> <span>salmon</span> and a <span>bottle</span> of <span>sparkling</span> <span>water</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Is everything <span>correct</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, everything is <span>correct</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Great! Your order will be ready in <span>15</span> <span>minutes</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Oh, <span>hold</span> <span>on</span>!<br/> 
🎧 What's the <span>matter</span>, <span>Ma'am</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Well, I'm so sorry, but can I change my order?<br/> 
🎧 Sure! What would you like to <span>change</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I want some <span>fries</span> <span>instead</span> of that garden <span>salad</span>!<br/> 
🎧 And a <span>Coke</span> <span>instead</span> of <span>sparkling</span> <span>water</span>...<br/> 
🎧 <span>Alright</span>.<br/> 
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, can I <span>switch</span> to the <span>burger</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I'm <span>suddenly</span> <span>craving</span> something <span>less</span>... <span>green</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Of course, you can!<br/> 
🎧 A <span>burger</span> is a <span>salad's</span> <span>cooler</span>, <span>tastier</span> <span>cousin</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, you're right!<br/> 
🎧 I'll make sure your <span>burger</span> comes out as quickly as your <span>stomach</span> changes its <span>mind</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Thank you so much!<br/> <br/> 

<h2 id="esc-6-323">Compliments to the Chef <b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this, 323)">🔊</b></h2>

🎧 How was everything <span>tonight</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I see you've <span>left</span> <span>nothing</span> but <span>crumbs</span>!<br/> 
🎧 <span>Honestly</span>, I think I just <span>fell</span> in <span>love</span>... with your <span>chef</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'll let him know. He <span>loves</span> fan <span>mail</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Seriously</span>, that <span>steak</span> was so good, that I almost <span>wrote</span> it a love <span>letter</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Do you take <span>requests</span>? Can I meet the <span>chef</span>?<br/> 
🎧 We want to <span>personally</span> thank the <span>magician</span> behind the <span>magic</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I can <span>arrange</span> that.<br/> 
🎧 But <span>fair</span> <span>warning</span>, if you <span>shower</span> him with too many <span>compliments</span>,<br/> 
🎧 he might make you eat the whole <span>menu</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Actually, I don't <span>mind</span> that at <span>all</span>...<br/> 
🎧 But we'd need quite a lot of <span>digestive</span> <span>pills</span> for that!<br/> 
🎧 <span>You're</span> too <span>kind</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'll tell him to <span>prepare</span> for his <span>standing</span> <span>ovation</span>.<br/> 
🎧 And give him our <span>deepest</span> <span>compliments</span>.<br/> 
🎧 This <span>meal</span> was <span>unforgettable</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I <span>will</span>.<br/> 
🎧 And next time, I'll let him know he has <span>fans</span> <span>waiting</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We'll even put up a red <span>carpet</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Perfect. <span>We'll</span> <span>bring</span> the <span>applause</span>!<br/> <br/>
