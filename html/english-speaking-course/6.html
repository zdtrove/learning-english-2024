<h2>Making a Reservation</h2>

🎧 Good <span>evening</span>! <span>Fancy</span> <span>Dining.<br/></span> 
🎧 How can I help <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 Hi! I would like to make a <span>reservation</span> for <span>dinner.<br/></span> 
🎧 Great! May I know how many <span>people?<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, that will be just me and my <span>hunger</span>. <span>So..</span>. just one, <span>please.<br/></span> 
🎧 A <span>table</span> for one? Wow, what a <span>bold</span> <span>move!<br/></span> 
🎧 What time would you and your <span>hunger</span> like to <span>come?<br/></span> 
🎧 We would probably <span>show</span> up at <span>7</span> pm. <span>I'll</span> be <span>fashionably</span> <span>early.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Unfortunately</span>, Sir, our <span>restaurant</span> is <span>fully</span> <span>booked</span> at <span>7</span> <span>pm.<br/></span> 
🎧 Would you <span>mind</span> <span>coming</span> a bit later, like <span>8</span> <span>pm?<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>guess</span> I have no <span>choice</span>. Fine, <span>8</span> pm it <span>is!<br/></span> 
🎧 So, a <span>table</span> for you and your <span>hunger</span> at <span>8</span> <span>pm!<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you have any special <span>requests?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes. Can I sit by the <span>window?<br/></span> 
🎧 I need good <span>lighting</span> for my food <span>selfies.<br/></span> 
🎧 Of course! <span>We'll</span> make sure your food <span>shines</span> as <span>bright</span> as you <span>do.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Perfect</span>. Should I <span>dress</span> <span>fancy</span>, or can I <span>rock</span> my <span>pyjamas?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>We're</span> all about <span>style</span>, but maybe <span>save</span> the <span>pyjamas</span> for <span>Netflix.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Wise</span> <span>words</span>! That will be well <span>noted.<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, thank you, see you at <span>8!<br/></span> 
🎧 You're <span>welcome</span>, Sir! <span>Looking</span> forward to <span>it!<br/></span> 
🎧 Good <span>evening</span>! <span>Welcome</span> to <span>Gourmet</span> <span>Delights.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you have a <span>reservation?<br/></span> 
🎧 Hi! No, <span>we're</span> just <span>walk-ins</span>. Is that <span>okay?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Walk-ins</span>? <span>You're</span> living <span>dangerously</span>, I like <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 Let me <span>see..</span>. <span>Ah</span>, you're in <span>luck.<br/></span> 
🎧 I can get you a <span>table</span> right <span>away.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Perfect</span>! I hope the food comes as <span>fast</span> as the <span>table.<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, our <span>chef</span> <span>moves</span> <span>fast</span>, but don't <span>expect</span> <span>magic.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Follow</span> me, <span>please.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Ooh</span>, a <span>table</span> by the <span>window</span>! Isn't it <span>great?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, it's great for <span>watching</span> <span>people's</span> <span>heads</span> <span>while</span> we <span>eat!<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, <span>people-watching</span> is a <span>part</span> of fine <span>dining</span>, isn't <span>it?<br/></span> 
🎧 Here are your <span>menus!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Thanks!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Honey</span>, be <span>careful</span>, please try not to <span>spill</span> anything on it this <span>time.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's not like I have a <span>glass</span> of <span>wine</span> in my <span>hand</span> right <span>now!<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, please <span>don't!<br/></span> 
🎧 I think our <span>menus</span> have had enough <span>wine</span> for <span>today.<br/></span> 
🎧 They're a bit <span>tipsy</span> already, in <span>fact!<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, if so, I'd be more <span>careful!<br/></span> 
🎧 Hi there! I'll be your <span>server</span> <span>tonight.<br/></span> 
🎧 Can I start you off with some <span>drinks?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Actually</span>, I'm <span>clueless.<br/></span> 
🎧 What do you <span>recommend</span> for <span>someone</span> who is bad at <span>making</span> <span>decisions?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'd say the <span>pasta.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's <span>delicious</span>, and you can't go wrong with <span>carbs.<br/></span> 
🎧 That sounds great, but what if I <span>regret</span> it <span>halfway?<br/></span> 
🎧 You won't. But if you do, we'll just <span>bring</span> more <span>bread.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Sold</span>! <span>Pasta</span> it <span>is.<br/></span> 
🎧 But wait, what about <span>dessert?<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, we have an <span>amazing</span> <span>chocolate</span> <span>cake.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>It's</span> like a hug, but from inside your <span>stomach.<br/></span> 
🎧 That's exactly what I need after this long <span>day.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>You're</span> a <span>lifesaver.<br/></span> 
🎧 Just doing my <span>part</span> to keep the <span>world</span> <span>happy.<br/></span> 
🎧 One <span>slice</span> of <span>cake</span> at a <span>time.<br/></span> 
🎧 So one garden <span>salad</span>, one <span>grilled</span> <span>salmon</span> and a <span>bottle</span> of <span>sparkling</span> <span>water.<br/></span> 
🎧 Is everything <span>correct?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, everything is <span>correct.<br/></span> 
🎧 Great! Your <span>order</span> will be ready in <span>15</span> <span>minutes!<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, <span>hold</span> <span>on!<br/></span> 
🎧 What's the <span>matter</span>, <span>Ma'am?<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, <span>I'm</span> so <span>sorry</span>, but can I change my <span>order?<br/></span> 
🎧 Sure! What would you like to <span>change?<br/></span> 
🎧 I want some <span>fries</span> <span>instead</span> of that garden <span>salad!<br/></span> 
🎧 And a <span>Coke</span> <span>instead</span> of <span>sparkling</span> <span>water...<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Alright.<br/></span> 
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, can I <span>switch</span> to the <span>burger?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>I'm</span> <span>suddenly</span> <span>craving</span> something <span>less..</span>. <span>green.<br/></span> 
🎧 Of course, you <span>can!<br/></span> 
🎧 A <span>burger</span> is a <span>salad's</span> <span>cooler</span>, <span>tastier</span> <span>cousin.<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, you're <span>right!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>I'll</span> make sure your <span>burger</span> comes out as quickly as your <span>stomach</span> changes its <span>mind.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thank you so <span>much!<br/></span> 
🎧 How was everything <span>tonight?<br/></span> 
🎧 I see you've <span>left</span> <span>nothing</span> but <span>crumbs!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Honestly</span>, I think I just <span>fell</span> in <span>love..</span>. with your <span>chef.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>I'll</span> let him know. He <span>loves</span> fan <span>mail.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Seriously</span>, that <span>steak</span> was so good, that I almost <span>wrote</span> it a love <span>letter.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you take <span>requests</span>? Can I <span>meet</span> the <span>chef?<br/></span> 
🎧 We want to <span>personally</span> thank the <span>magician</span> behind the <span>magic.<br/></span> 
🎧 I can <span>arrange</span> <span>that.<br/></span> 
🎧 But <span>fair</span> <span>warning</span>, if you <span>shower</span> him with too many <span>compliments,<br/></span> 
🎧 he might make you eat the <span>whole</span> <span>menu!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Actually</span>, I don't <span>mind</span> that at <span>all...<br/></span> 
🎧 But we'd need quite a lot of <span>digestive</span> <span>pills</span> for <span>that!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>You're</span> too <span>kind.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll tell him to <span>prepare</span> for his <span>standing</span> <span>ovation.<br/></span> 
🎧 And give him our <span>deepest</span> <span>compliments.<br/></span> 
🎧 This <span>meal</span> was <span>unforgettable.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>will.<br/></span> 
🎧 And next time, I'll let him know he has <span>fans</span> <span>waiting.<br/></span> 
🎧 We'll even put up a red <span>carpet.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Perfect</span>. <span>We'll</span> <span>bring</span> the <span>applause!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hello</span>! Thank you for <span>calling</span> <span>Seaside</span> <span>Hotel.<br/></span> 
🎧 How can I help <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 Hi, I would like to book a <span>room</span> for the <span>weekend.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you have anything <span>available?<br/></span> 
🎧 Let me <span>check.<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, we have a few <span>rooms</span> <span>left.<br/></span> 
🎧 May I know your name, <span>Sir?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm <span>Ian</span> <span>Brown.<br/></span> 
🎧 So, Mr. <span>Brown</span>, do you <span>prefer</span> a <span>single</span> or <span>double</span> <span>room?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>I'll</span> go with a <span>double</span>. You know, in case I <span>roll</span> around too much at <span>night.<br/></span> 
🎧 All right, a <span>double</span> it <span>is.<br/></span> 
🎧 How many <span>nights</span> would you like to <span>stay</span> at our <span>hotel?<br/></span> 
🎧 Just two. <span>Friday</span> and <span>Saturday.<br/></span> 
🎧 Great! Do you have any special <span>requests?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Uh</span>, yeah, <span>actually..</span>. Can I get <span>extra</span> <span>pillows?<br/></span> 
🎧 Like, <span>five</span> of them. I <span>mean..</span>. I just really love <span>pillows.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll make a <span>note.<br/></span> 
🎧 Your <span>pillow</span> <span>kingdom</span> will be <span>ready.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Perfect</span>! Do I need to pay <span>now?<br/></span> 
🎧 No, you can pay when you check <span>in.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>We'll</span> have your <span>room</span> ready when you <span>arrive.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Awesome</span>. I <span>can't</span> wait to <span>dive</span> into those <span>pillows.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>You're</span> all set. See you on <span>Friday!<br/></span> 
🎧 Good <span>afternoon</span>! <span>Welcome</span> to the <span>Grand</span> <span>Hotel.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you have a <span>reservation?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, I do. It's under <span>Mia</span> <span>Thompson.<br/></span> 
🎧 Let me <span>check…</span> <span>Ah</span>, here you <span>are!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Mrs</span>. <span>Thompson</span>, are you <span>staying</span> for two <span>nights?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yep</span>! Just so you know, <span>I'm</span> here for a <span>“do-nothing”</span> <span>weekend.<br/></span> 
🎧 That sounds like a <span>solid</span> <span>plan.<br/></span> 
🎧 Here's your <span>room</span> <span>key.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Room</span> <span>305</span>. It's on the <span>third</span> <span>floor.<br/></span> 
🎧 Is there an <span>elevator?<br/></span> 
🎧 Or do I need to start my <span>“do-nothing”</span> weekend by taking the <span>stairs?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes. <span>Mrs</span>. <span>Thompson</span>, we have an <span>elevator</span>, so no need for a <span>stair</span> <span>workout.<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, that's such a <span>relief.<br/></span> 
🎧 I didn't <span>bring</span> my <span>workout</span> <span>clothes</span> <span>anyway.<br/></span> 
🎧 Just the <span>“do-nothing”</span> <span>clothes</span>, <span>right?<br/></span> 
🎧 Exactly! Thanks for your <span>understanding.<br/></span> 
🎧 Enjoy your <span>stay!<br/></span> 
🎧 And if you need help doing <span>nothing</span>, just let us <span>know.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Certainly</span>! <span>I'll</span> keep that in <span>mind.<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>elevator</span> is over there, <span>Ma'am!<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, right! How did I <span>miss</span> <span>that?<br/></span> 
🎧 I think my <span>brain's</span> already doing <span>nothing!<br/></span> 
🎧 Sounds like you're on the right <span>track</span> for a <span>complete</span> <span>rest.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hello</span>, <span>I'd</span> like to <span>order</span> <span>room</span> <span>service</span>, <span>please.<br/></span> 
🎧 Sure! What can I get for you <span>today?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm feeling <span>fancy.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you have <span>anything..</span>. <span>five</span> <span>stars</span>? Some <span>Michelin</span> <span>choices?<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, we have a <span>sandwich</span> with <span>five</span> <span>slices</span> of <span>bread.<br/></span> 
🎧 Does that <span>count?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, <span>that's…</span> <span>creative</span>. Do you have a <span>steak?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, we do! <span>Medium</span>, <span>rare</span>, <span>or…</span> very well done, as in <span>“crispy”?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Medium</span>, <span>please.<br/></span> 
🎧 And maybe some <span>fries.<br/></span> 
🎧 Absolutely! A <span>steak</span> without some <span>crispy</span> <span>fries</span> is like day without <span>night!<br/></span> 
🎧 Exactly. And for <span>dessert?<br/></span> 
🎧 We have <span>chocolate</span> <span>cake</span>, or if <span>you're</span> feeling <span>adventurous</span>, a <span>mystery</span> <span>dessert.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Mystery</span> <span>dessert?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yep</span>. It could be <span>chocolate</span> <span>cake..</span>. or something we <span>found</span> in the <span>fridge.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>I'll</span> just take the <span>cake</span>, <span>thanks.<br/></span> 
🎧 Good <span>choice</span>. <span>We'll</span> <span>send</span> everything up <span>shortly!<br/></span> 
🎧 Please, no <span>surprises</span>, <span>okay?<br/></span> 
🎧 Only good <span>ones</span>. <span>Promise!<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, how <span>lucky</span>! Hi, <span>Miss!<br/></span> 
🎧 Good morning, <span>Ma'am</span>! How may I help <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 Can I <span>request</span> some <span>extra</span> <span>towels</span>, <span>please?<br/></span> 
🎧 Of course. How many would you <span>like?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Uh..</span>. <span>ten?<br/></span> 
🎧 Ten <span>towels</span>? Are you planning a <span>pool</span> <span>party</span> in your <span>room?<br/></span> 
🎧 No, <span>just..</span>. well, you never know. I mean, I have two <span>teenage</span> <span>daughters</span> with <span>me...<br/></span> 
🎧 Better <span>safe</span> than <span>sorry</span>, <span>right?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll <span>send</span> ten <span>towels</span> your <span>way.<br/></span> 
🎧 Anything <span>else?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Actually</span>, do you <span>happen</span> to have some <span>extra</span> <span>pillows?<br/></span> 
🎧 Sure, how many <span>pillows</span>? <span>Don't</span> tell me, <span>ten?<br/></span> 
🎧 No, just two, please. I <span>don't</span> need to <span>build</span> a <span>pillow</span> <span>fort..</span>. <span>yet.<br/></span> 
🎧 Good <span>plan.<br/></span> 
🎧 Is there anything else that you need? <span>Snacks</span>? A pet <span>elephant?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, an <span>elephant</span> might be too big for the <span>room.<br/></span> 
🎧 But maybe some <span>extra</span> <span>shampoo?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Shampoo</span>, got it! <span>I'll</span> <span>send</span> the <span>towels</span>, <span>pillows</span>, and <span>shampoo</span> up right <span>away.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks! And maybe <span>I'll</span> <span>save</span> the <span>elephant</span> for next <span>time.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>We'll</span> be ready for <span>it!<br/></span> 
🎧 Good <span>evening</span>! How can I help <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, hi! I'm <span>staying</span> in <span>room</span> <span>412,<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>and..</span>. I think there are some <span>uninvited</span> <span>guests</span> in my <span>room...<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh my! What do you mean by <span>"uninvited</span> <span>guests?"<br/></span> 
🎧 Is <span>somebody</span> trying to get inside your <span>room?<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, I'm not <span>sure..</span>. But <span>there's</span> a <span>strange</span> <span>noise</span> <span>coming</span> from the <span>bathroom.<br/></span> 
🎧 A <span>strange</span> <span>noise</span>? <span>Like…</span> <span>singing?<br/></span> 
🎧 No, more like a <span>dripping</span> tap <span>mixed</span> with a <span>haunted</span> <span>house...<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Ah</span>, the <span>classic</span> <span>“ghost</span> with <span>plumbing</span> <span>problems.”<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>We'll</span> <span>send</span> <span>someone</span> to fix that. Anything <span>else?<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>window</span> won't open. I <span>tried</span> <span>everything.<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, our <span>windows</span> are on <span>strike.<br/></span> 
🎧 They <span>refuse</span> to work <span>unless</span> <span>treated</span> <span>nicely.<br/></span> 
🎧 Funny, but I really need some <span>fresh</span> <span>air.<br/></span> 
🎧 No <span>problem</span>, <span>we'll</span> take <span>care</span> of that. Anything <span>else?<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>bed..</span>. <span>it's</span> a bit <span>lumpy.<br/></span> 
🎧 I feel like I'm <span>lying</span> on <span>Mount</span> <span>Everest</span> <span>here.<br/></span> 
🎧 Got it. <span>We'll</span> <span>bring</span> you a <span>flatter</span> one. Anything <span>else?<br/></span> 
🎧 No, that <span>covers</span> <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 Just fix my <span>haunted</span> tap, <span>please!<br/></span> 
🎧 On it! <span>Hopefully</span>, no <span>ghosts</span> <span>involved.<br/></span> 
🎧 Good <span>evening</span>! How can I <span>assist</span> <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 Hi! I need a <span>wake-up</span> <span>call</span> for <span>tomorrow</span> <span>morning.<br/></span> 
🎧 I've got an <span>early</span> <span>flight.<br/></span> 
🎧 What time would you like the <span>wake-up</span> <span>call?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Ugh</span>, <span>5</span> <span>am..</span>. Is that even a <span>real</span> <span>time?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Unfortunately</span>, yes. We can <span>call</span> you at <span>5</span> am, <span>though.<br/></span> 
🎧 Please do! <span>I'm</span> not great at <span>waking</span> up, so <span>I'll</span> need all the help I can <span>get.<br/></span> 
🎧 We'll make sure you get up <span>bright</span> and <span>early.<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, <span>whether</span> you like it or <span>not.<br/></span> 
🎧 Exactly what I <span>need!<br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks for the <span>assist.<br/></span> 
🎧 No <span>problem</span>. <span>We'll</span> be your morning <span>alarm</span> <span>clock.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Let's</span> just hope I <span>don't</span> hit the <span>snooze</span> <span>button</span> on <span>you.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Luckily</span>, there's no <span>snooze</span> <span>button</span> here, so you're <span>safe.<br/></span> 
🎧 Have a good <span>night</span>, <span>Sarah.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks <span>again!<br/></span> 
🎧 Good <span>afternoon!<br/></span> 
🎧 How can I help you <span>today?<br/></span> 
🎧 Hi! I need <span>laundry</span> <span>service.<br/></span> 
🎧 My <span>suitcase</span> <span>exploded</span> and I've got <span>nothing</span> <span>clean</span> <span>left.<br/></span> 
🎧 I see! We can help with that. What do you need <span>washed?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Pretty</span> much everything in my <span>suitcase.<br/></span> 
🎧 Is that <span>okay?<br/></span> 
🎧 Absolutely! Just leave it in the bag, and <span>we'll</span> take <span>care</span> of <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Great!<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, and please don't <span>judge</span> my <span>crazy</span> <span>sock</span> <span>collection.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Certainly</span>, no <span>judgment</span>! <span>We'll</span> <span>wash</span> them without a <span>second</span> <span>thought.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Thanks!<br/></span> 
🎧 Just so you know, I can't <span>survive</span> without my <span>lucky</span> <span>socks.<br/></span> 
🎧 Of course, <span>lucky</span> <span>socks</span> are <span>important!<br/></span> 
🎧 We'll have everything ready for you by <span>tomorrow.<br/></span> 
🎧 You <span>guys</span> are <span>lifesavers.<br/></span> 
🎧 I was about to <span>accept</span> the <span>fate</span> of my <span>dirty</span> <span>clothes.<br/></span> 
🎧 We'll <span>save</span> you from that <span>fate.<br/></span> 
🎧 Good morning, <span>Sam</span>! Time to <span>wake</span> <span>up!<br/></span> 
🎧 Do I have to? My bed is <span>calling</span> my <span>name.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>It's</span> <span>7</span> am, not a phone <span>call</span>. Up you <span>get!<br/></span> 
🎧 but I'm not a morning person. I'm more of a <span>sleep</span> <span>until</span> lunch <span>person.<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, you can't <span>sleep</span> all <span>day.<br/></span> 
🎧 We've got <span>breakfast</span>. <span>Pancakes!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Pancakes</span>? Now <span>you're</span> <span>speaking</span> my <span>language.<br/></span> 
🎧 See? It's not so <span>bad.<br/></span> 
🎧 Get up and get <span>dressed</span>. <span>Breakfast</span> won't <span>wait.<br/></span> 
🎧 Fine, but I'm still in bed <span>mentally.<br/></span> 
🎧 My <span>body</span> is just <span>catching</span> <span>up.<br/></span> 
🎧 Just try to make it to the <span>table</span> before the <span>pancakes</span> are <span>gone.<br/></span> 
🎧 No <span>promises</span>. I might need a <span>wake-up</span> <span>call.<br/></span> 
🎧 Here's your <span>call.<br/></span> 
🎧 Get <span>up<br/></span> 
🎧 or <span>you'll</span> be <span>eating</span> <span>cold</span> <span>pancakes</span>! Or maybe AIR <span>PANCAKES!<br/></span> 
🎧 Okay, okay. I'm <span>moving.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Pancakes</span> are my <span>motivation.<br/></span> 
🎧 I mean, the <span>real</span> and hot <span>ones.<br/></span> 
🎧 Good <span>choice</span>. Now, <span>brush</span> your <span>teeth.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Deal</span>. I'll be there in <span>five</span> <span>minutes...<br/></span> 
🎧 if I <span>don't</span> get <span>lost</span> on the <span>way.<br/></span> 
🎧 Dad, can I have a new <span>backpack</span> for <span>school?<br/></span> 
🎧 Why? Is your old one <span>broken?<br/></span> 
🎧 No, but <span>it's</span> not <span>sparkly</span> enough. I need <span>sparkle</span> <span>power!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Sparkle</span> <span>power</span>? Is that a thing <span>now?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Totally</span>! If my <span>backpack</span> <span>doesn't</span> <span>sparkle</span>, I <span>can't</span> be the <span>coolest</span> <span>kid</span> in <span>class.<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, if we get you a <span>sparkly</span> <span>backpack,<br/></span> 
🎧 can you <span>promise</span> to <span>actually</span> use it for school and not just as a <span>fashion</span> <span>statement?<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>promise.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Plus</span>, I'll help you with the <span>groceries.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Ah</span>, a <span>deal</span>. And if you <span>forget</span> to help, <span>we're</span> <span>keeping</span> the <span>sparkles</span> to <span>ourselves.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Deal</span>! <span>Let's</span> go get <span>sparkles.<br/></span> 
🎧 And <span>don't</span> <span>worry</span>, Dad, <span>I'll</span> <span>carry</span> all the <span>groceries</span> and the <span>sparkles.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Good.<br/></span> 
🎧 And <span>remember</span>, no <span>sparkles</span> in the living <span>room.<br/></span> 
🎧 We don't need <span>extra</span> <span>glitter</span> on the <span>couch.<br/></span> 
🎧 Got it! <span>Sparkles</span> only in the <span>classroom</span>, I <span>swear.<br/></span> 
🎧 And no <span>extra</span> <span>sparkle</span> on the <span>homework</span>. <span>That's</span> still a big <span>no!<br/></span> 
🎧 Okay, okay. <span>Sparkles</span> for school, <span>homework</span> for <span>brains.<br/></span> 
🎧 Can I play on the <span>swings</span>? Mom? <span>Dad?<br/></span> 
🎧 Sure thing! But <span>remember</span>, no <span>flying</span> too <span>high.<br/></span> 
🎧 Your mom is <span>right.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm not ready for a <span>space</span> <span>mission.<br/></span> 
🎧 Don't <span>worry</span>, I won't fly to the <span>moon.<br/></span> 
🎧 Just a bit <span>higher</span> than the <span>slides.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Let's</span> <span>swing</span>, but if we see a <span>UFO</span>, <span>I'm</span> taking <span>cover!<br/></span> 
🎧 Dad, if we see a <span>UFO</span>, <span>I'm</span> <span>asking</span> them for a <span>ride</span>. I want to see <span>Mars!<br/></span> 
🎧 And what if they <span>bring</span> you back with <span>alien</span> <span>homework?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Alien</span> <span>homework?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll do it on the <span>spaceship.<br/></span> 
🎧 It'll be out of this <span>world!<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, if that <span>happens</span>, tell them <span>we're</span> <span>busy</span> with <span>park</span> <span>swings</span> <span>first.<br/></span> 
🎧 And make sure they <span>don't</span> take the dog. <span>He's</span> already got his own <span>plans!<br/></span> 
🎧 Got it! No <span>aliens</span>, no taking the <span>dog!<br/></span> 
🎧 Just <span>swings</span> and <span>fun!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Finally</span>, it's <span>family</span> <span>movie</span> <span>night</span>! What should we <span>watch?<br/></span> 
🎧 Can we <span>watch</span> the new <span>superhero</span> <span>movie?<br/></span> 
🎧 Again? <span>Didn't</span> we just <span>watch</span> it last <span>week?<br/></span> 
🎧 It will never be enough! How can you say no to <span>superpowers?<br/></span> 
🎧 How about a <span>comedy?<br/></span> 
🎧 I could use a <span>laugh.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Comedies</span> are good. But <span>superheroes</span> <span>are…</span> <span>super!<br/></span> 
🎧 Okay, how about both? Let's <span>watch</span> a <span>superhero</span> <span>comedy?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Superhero</span> <span>comedy?<br/></span> 
🎧 Now, that sounds <span>amazing.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Deal</span>. As long as it makes me <span>laugh!<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>promise</span> <span>it'll</span> be fun. And <span>popcorn</span> is <span>ready!<br/></span> 
🎧 Good! A <span>movie</span> <span>night</span> would not be <span>complete</span> without <span>popcorn!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Popcorn</span> is life. Just make sure it <span>doesn't</span> end up all over the <span>couch.<br/></span> 
🎧 We'll do our <span>best.<br/></span> 
🎧 Let's get <span>started.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Superhero</span> <span>comedy</span> and <span>popcorn.<br/></span> 
🎧 Best <span>combination.<br/></span> 
🎧 This is going to be <span>epic.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Remember</span>, no <span>fighting</span> over the <span>remote!<br/></span> 
🎧 Or the <span>popcorn!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Ugh</span>, <span>homework</span>. Why do I feel it is <span>never-ending?!<br/></span> 
🎧 I know, right? <span>I'm</span> <span>buried</span> in <span>math</span> <span>problems.<br/></span> 
🎧 Just think of it as a <span>puzzle.<br/></span> 
🎧 The more you <span>solve</span>, the <span>easier</span> it <span>gets.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm not a fan of <span>puzzles</span>, <span>Dad.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'd rather play <span>video</span> <span>games.<br/></span> 
🎧 Me, <span>too.<br/></span> 
🎧 But I have to get this done so I can play <span>later.<br/></span> 
🎧 You'll thank <span>yourself</span> later when you have all your work <span>finished.<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, yeah, I know, <span>Dad.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm trying my best to <span>finish</span> this <span>grammar</span> <span>exercise.<br/></span> 
🎧 Why do I have to learn <span>French?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Stop</span> <span>complaining</span> and try to <span>finish</span> it <span>up<br/></span> 
🎧 Once you're done, I will let you have more <span>screen</span> <span>time.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Deal</span>! But if I <span>don't</span> <span>finish</span>, can I have an <span>extra</span> <span>hour</span> of <span>playtime?<br/></span> 
🎧 Nice try. Just get it <span>done.<br/></span> 
🎧 It'll be over before you know <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hopefully</span>! <span>Homework</span>, here I <span>come.<br/></span> 
🎧 Alright <span>sons</span>, <span>it's</span> <span>cleaning</span> day! Please try your best, <span>okay?<br/></span> 
🎧 Can we just <span>pretend</span> the house is <span>clean?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, like a <span>magic</span> <span>spell.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Poof</span>! All <span>clean.<br/></span> 
🎧 Nice try, but we need to <span>actually</span> <span>clean!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Let's</span> make it fun. <span>Whoever</span> <span>cleans</span> the most <span>gets</span> ice <span>cream!<br/></span> 
🎧 Ice <span>cream?</span>! How old do you think I <span>am?!<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, that sounds <span>awesome</span> to <span>me.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm on <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm <span>cleaning</span> the <span>attic.<br/></span> 
🎧 Are you sure you don't want ice <span>cream</span>, <span>Nate?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Well..</span>. I <span>guess</span> some ice <span>cream</span> doesn't <span>hurt...<br/></span> 
🎧 Great <span>enthusiasm</span>! Just <span>remember</span> to <span>dust</span> off those old <span>toys.<br/></span> 
🎧 Old <span>toys</span>? I haven't <span>seen</span> those in <span>ages.<br/></span> 
🎧 I bet they are <span>dinosaurs</span> up <span>there.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>They've</span> been <span>hiding.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Dinosaurs</span> or not, <span>let's</span> get this <span>done.<br/></span> 
🎧 We'll have the <span>cleanest</span> house in <span>town.<br/></span> 
🎧 And the <span>biggest</span> ice <span>cream</span> <span>sundaes.<br/></span> 
🎧 Wish I had some <span>magic</span> <span>brooms...<br/></span> 
🎧 Time to go <span>grocery</span> <span>shopping.<br/></span> 
🎧 Get your <span>bags.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do we have <span>to?<br/></span> 
🎧 Can't we just <span>order</span> <span>pizza?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>No.<br/></span> 
🎧 We need food for the <span>week.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>I'll</span> help <span>pick</span> out the <span>cereal</span>. <span>I'm</span> an <span>expert!<br/></span> 
🎧 And <span>I'll</span> choose the <span>snacks</span>. <span>I'm</span> also an <span>expert.<br/></span> 
🎧 Just don't make the <span>cart</span> a <span>snack</span> <span>monster.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Promise</span>! But can we get some <span>cookies?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Cookies</span> are a must. They should be in every <span>cart.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Cookies</span>, yes. But <span>let's</span> not <span>forget</span> the <span>veggies.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Veggies</span> are <span>boring.<br/></span> 
🎧 Can we get <span>extra</span> <span>cookies</span> <span>instead?<br/></span> 
🎧 We need <span>balance</span>. <span>Healthy</span> food and <span>cookies.<br/></span> 
🎧 Fine. <span>I'll</span> <span>sneak</span> in some <span>extra</span> <span>snacks.<br/></span> 
🎧 As long as you help me find the <span>milk.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Deal.<br/></span> 
🎧 And make sure we get the best <span>cereal!<br/></span> 
🎧 You can <span>count</span> on us, <span>Mom!<br/></span> 
🎧 Alright, everyone, <span>let's</span> go for our <span>evening</span> <span>walk!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>I'm</span> ready! <span>I've</span> got my <span>sneakers</span> <span>on.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do I have <span>to?<br/></span> 
🎧 I have an <span>important</span> game to <span>win…</span> in my <span>video</span> <span>game.<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh. Come <span>on.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's just a <span>walk.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Besides</span>, your <span>video</span> game will still be there when we get <span>back.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm not sure. What if I <span>miss</span> a <span>level?<br/></span> 
🎧 You'll be <span>fine.<br/></span> 
🎧 The only <span>level</span> you're <span>miss</span> here is the <span>level</span> of <span>fitness.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Fitness?<br/></span> 
🎧 I didn't <span>sign</span> up for a gym <span>membership.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's not a <span>gym.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>It's</span> a <span>walk</span> with your Mom and <span>Dad!<br/></span> 
🎧 How come you don't want to have a <span>walk</span> with us, <span>Dave?!<br/></span> 
🎧 Don't make your Mom sad, <span>Dave!<br/></span> 
🎧 Think of it as a <span>break</span> from the <span>screen.<br/></span> 
🎧 Okay, okay, I got <span>it!<br/></span> 
🎧 I bet it will be <span>great!<br/></span> 
🎧 Let's <span>see...<br/></span> 
🎧 All right, that's it for <span>tonight</span>! Time to <span>close</span> your <span>eyes!<br/></span> 
🎧 But Dad, <span>I'm</span> not <span>tired</span> yet. Can you just read one more <span>chapter?<br/></span> 
🎧 You know, if you <span>stay</span> up too <span>late</span>, you'll <span>turn</span> into a <span>zombie.<br/></span> 
🎧 I don't think I want to be a <span>zombie.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do <span>zombies</span> get <span>extra</span> <span>sleep?<br/></span> 
🎧 I don't think they even <span>sleep.<br/></span> 
🎧 They probably just <span>wander</span> <span>around.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Urgh..</span>. If so, I wouldn't want to become a <span>zombie!<br/></span> 
🎧 Of course, <span>honey!<br/></span> 
🎧 You won't become a <span>zombie</span> as long as you go to <span>sleep</span> right <span>away.<br/></span> 
🎧 But Dad, this book is so <span>interesting!<br/></span> 
🎧 I want to know what will <span>happen</span> <span>next.<br/></span> 
🎧 Can we just <span>save</span> it for <span>tomorrow?<br/></span> 
🎧 I don't think I can <span>sleep</span> in <span>peace</span> <span>tonight</span> without <span>knowing</span> the <span>princess's</span> <span>fate!<br/></span> 
🎧 All right, but just one <span>chapter</span>. Then <span>it's</span> <span>lights</span> <span>out.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thank you, <span>Dad!<br/>
