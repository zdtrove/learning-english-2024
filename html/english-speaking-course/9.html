<h2>How Can I Learn English By Myself?</h2>

🎧 <span>It's</span> okay, <span>Lily</span>. <span>You've</span> done this <span>before.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>It's</span> just a new school. Just <span>smile</span> and be <span>friendly.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Maybe…</span> maybe they <span>won't</span> <span>notice</span> that your English <span>isn't</span> that <span>good.<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, <span>sorry</span>! Are you <span>okay?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Uh…</span> <span>yes…</span> <span>I…</span> <span>I'm</span> okay. <span>Sorry.<br/></span> 
🎧 That was so <span>stupid.<br/></span> 
🎧 I couldn't even say a full <span>sentence</span> without <span>messing</span> <span>up.<br/></span> 
🎧 How am I going to <span>survive</span> <span>here?<br/></span> 
🎧 Good morning, <span>Lily</span>! <span>Welcome</span> to your new <span>school.<br/></span> 
🎧 Good morning, <span>Ms.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm sure you're feeling a bit <span>nervous,<br/></span> 
🎧 but <span>don't</span> <span>worry</span>, <span>we're</span> all very happy to have you <span>here.<br/></span> 
🎧 Are you ready to <span>meet</span> your new <span>classmates?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Um…</span> <span>yes…</span> I think <span>so.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>That's</span> the <span>spirit</span>! Just be <span>yourself</span>, and <span>you'll</span> do <span>great.<br/></span> 
🎧 Let's go <span>meet</span> your <span>teacher.<br/></span> 
🎧 Good morning, <span>Principal.<br/></span> 
🎧 And you must be <span>Lily!<br/></span> 
🎧 We've been <span>looking</span> forward to <span>meeting</span> <span>you.<br/></span> 
🎧 Everyone, this is <span>Lily.<br/></span> 
🎧 She's new to our school, so please make her feel <span>welcome.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Lily</span>, would you like to <span>introduce</span> <span>yourself</span> to the <span>class?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Um…</span> My name is <span>Lily…</span> <span>and…<br/></span> 
🎧 I just <span>moved</span> here because <span>of…</span> my <span>parents'</span> <span>work.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thank you, <span>Lily.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's not easy being a new <span>student,<br/></span> 
🎧 but I'm sure you'll make friends in no <span>time.<br/></span> 
🎧 Just find a <span>seat</span>, eat quickly, and <span>don't</span> talk to <span>anyone…<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe they won't <span>notice</span> <span>you.<br/></span> 
🎧 Hey, new <span>girl</span>! You <span>dropped</span> <span>something!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>I-I'm</span> <span>sorry…</span> I <span>didn't</span> mean <span>to…<br/></span> 
🎧 Nice one! Maybe next time, use your <span>hands</span> <span>properly!<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh my <span>god</span>, she can't even <span>handle</span> her lunch. How <span>clumsy!<br/></span> 
🎧 Tell them you can do <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 What should I <span>say?<br/></span> 
🎧 Something <span>like...<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>can't</span> do <span>this…</span> I just want to go <span>home…<br/></span> 
🎧 Hey, don't <span>worry</span> about them. Let me help <span>you.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thank <span>you...<br/></span> 
🎧 It's okay. We've all had <span>embarrassing</span> <span>moments.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Trust</span> me, I've been there <span>too.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm <span>Sharon</span>, by the <span>way.<br/></span> 
🎧 I've <span>seen</span> you around, but I <span>guess</span> we haven't had a <span>chance</span> to talk <span>yet.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>I'm</span> <span>Lily</span>. <span>I…</span> just <span>moved</span> <span>here.<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, I <span>figured<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Moving</span> to a new school is <span>tough.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>moved</span> here last year, and it was really <span>hard</span> at <span>first.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Especially</span> with all the new <span>faces</span> and, <span>well…</span> the <span>language.<br/></span> 
🎧 My <span>English…</span> <span>it's</span> not <span>good.<br/></span> 
🎧 I get so <span>scared</span> to <span>talk…</span> and <span>then…</span> this <span>happens.<br/></span> 
🎧 You're doing fine, <span>Lily.<br/></span> 
🎧 English is <span>hard</span>, but you're here and you're <span>trying.<br/></span> 
🎧 That's what <span>matters.<br/></span> 
🎧 And <span>trust</span> me, it <span>gets</span> <span>better.<br/></span> 
🎧 Is <span>it?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Sure.<br/></span> 
🎧 And one more thing, it's not your <span>fault.<br/></span> 
🎧 They're just <span>bullying</span> you with <span>words.<br/></span> 
🎧 But everyone was <span>laughing…</span> They must think <span>I'm</span> so <span>stupid.<br/></span> 
🎧 Even if they are such <span>rude</span> <span>ones</span>, who <span>cares?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>You're</span> here to learn, not to <span>impress</span> <span>everyone.<br/></span> 
🎧 And <span>besides</span>, I think <span>you're</span> <span>brave</span> for even <span>trying.<br/></span> 
🎧 When I first got here, I was too <span>scared</span> to even <span>speak</span> up in <span>class.<br/></span> 
🎧 You <span>were?<br/></span> 
🎧 Absolutely. I <span>messed</span> up so many <span>times.<br/></span> 
🎧 But I <span>learned</span> that the only way to get better is to keep <span>trying.<br/></span> 
🎧 No <span>matter</span> how <span>embarrassing</span> it <span>gets.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, if you <span>practice</span> <span>more,<br/></span> 
🎧 you'll have the <span>confidence</span> to <span>speak</span> up for <span>yourself</span> in such <span>situations.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>You're</span> not <span>alone</span>. <span>I'll</span> help you, <span>okay?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>But…</span> what if I <span>mess</span> up <span>again?<br/></span> 
🎧 You probably will. But <span>that's</span> <span>okay!<br/></span> 
🎧 Each time you try, you'll get a little <span>better.<br/></span> 
🎧 We can <span>practice</span> <span>together.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe after school, we can go over some <span>things?<br/></span> 
🎧 I've got a few <span>tips</span> that really <span>helped</span> me when I was <span>struggling.<br/></span> 
🎧 Really? <span>You'd</span> do <span>that?<br/></span> 
🎧 Of course! <span>We're</span> in this <span>together.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>You'll</span> see, <span>it'll</span> get <span>easier.<br/></span> 
🎧 And one day, <span>you'll</span> look back on today and <span>realize</span> how <span>far</span> <span>you've</span> <span>come.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thank you, <span>Sharon</span>. <span>I…</span> I really <span>appreciate</span> <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Anytime</span>, <span>Lily</span>. <span>We're</span> friends now, <span>right?<br/></span> 
🎧 And friends help each other <span>out.<br/></span> 
🎧 Is it <span>far</span> from your <span>house?<br/></span> 
🎧 It only took me <span>3</span> <span>minutes</span> to get <span>here.<br/></span> 
🎧 Really? How did you get <span>there?<br/></span> 
🎧 On <span>foot</span>. I <span>realized</span> you were my <span>neighbor.<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh. I didn't <span>expect</span> <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Coincidence</span> <span>brings</span> us <span>closer</span> <span>together.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm so glad about <span>that.<br/></span> 
🎧 I want to come to your house to play once, is that <span>okay?<br/></span> 
🎧 Absolutely. <span>Staying</span> at home is so <span>boring.<br/></span> 
🎧 Now let's get <span>started.<br/></span> 
🎧 I've got a few <span>tips</span> that <span>helped</span> me a lot when I was in your <span>shoes.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you want to hear <span>them?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, <span>please.<br/></span> 
🎧 Okay. First, one thing that really <span>helped</span> <span>me<br/></span> 
🎧 was <span>practicing</span> English in small, <span>everyday</span> <span>situations.<br/></span> 
🎧 Like when you're at <span>home.<br/></span> 
🎧 Try thinking in English or even talking to <span>yourself</span> in <span>English.<br/></span> 
🎧 It might feel <span>weird</span> at <span>first,<br/></span> 
🎧 but it really helps get your <span>brain</span> used to the <span>language.<br/></span> 
🎧 Talking to myself? <span>Like…</span> just saying what <span>I'm</span> <span>doing?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Exactly!<br/></span> 
🎧 Like, if you're <span>making</span> <span>breakfast,<br/></span> 
🎧 you can say, <span>‘I'm</span> <span>cracking</span> an <span>egg,'</span> or <span>‘I'm</span> <span>spreading</span> <span>butter</span> on the <span>toast.'<br/></span> 
🎧 It's a great way to <span>practice</span> without any <span>pressure.<br/></span> 
🎧 And the more you do it, the more <span>natural</span> it will <span>feel.<br/></span> 
🎧 That sounds like something I can <span>try.<br/></span> 
🎧 What <span>else?<br/></span> 
🎧 Another thing is <span>reading</span> out <span>loud.<br/></span> 
🎧 Even if <span>it's</span> just a <span>paragraph</span> or a short <span>story,<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>reading</span> out <span>loud</span> helps you get used to the sounds of the <span>words.<br/></span> 
🎧 And <span>it's</span> okay to go <span>slow</span>, you <span>don't</span> have to <span>rush.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's about getting <span>comfortable</span> with the <span>language.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>I've</span> always been <span>afraid</span> to read out <span>loud</span> because I <span>didn't</span> want to <span>mess</span> <span>up.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>totally</span> get <span>that.<br/></span> 
🎧 But the more you do it, the less <span>scary</span> it <span>becomes.<br/></span> 
🎧 And if you make a <span>mistake</span>, just <span>correct</span> it and keep <span>going.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's all <span>part</span> of the <span>learning</span> <span>process.<br/></span> 
🎧 And you can even <span>record</span> <span>yourself</span> and listen back to see how you're <span>improving.<br/></span> 
🎧 Talking to <span>myself?<br/></span> 
🎧 That sounds <span>helpful</span>. I'll give it a <span>try.<br/></span> 
🎧 And <span>here's</span> another <span>tip:<br/></span> 
🎧 When you're <span>listening</span> to <span>English,<br/></span> 
🎧 like in <span>movies</span>, <span>songs</span>, or even in <span>class,<br/></span> 
🎧 try to <span>mimic</span> what you <span>hear.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Repeat</span> <span>phrases</span> all <span>sentences</span> to <span>yourself.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's a great way to <span>practice</span> <span>pronunciation</span> and <span>intonation.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Plus</span>, it's fun to <span>imitate</span> your <span>favorite</span> <span>characters.<br/></span> 
🎧 I love <span>watching</span> <span>movies.<br/></span> 
🎧 I never thought about <span>repeating</span> what they <span>say.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>It's</span> one of my <span>favorite</span> <span>ways</span> to <span>practice!<br/></span> 
🎧 And don't <span>worry</span> if it doesn't sound <span>perfect</span> right <span>away.<br/></span> 
🎧 The more you <span>mimic,<br/></span> 
🎧 the better you'll get at <span>capturing</span> the <span>flow</span> of the <span>language.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm going to start doing <span>that.<br/></span> 
🎧 It sounds like a fun way to <span>practice.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's good to hear <span>that.<br/></span> 
🎧 In the <span>beginning</span>, you can start with short <span>videos</span> cut from <span>movies.<br/></span> 
🎧 That way, you <span>won't</span> feel bad quickly because <span>it's</span> easy to learn and <span>interesting.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thank you so <span>much.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Remember</span>, it's okay to <span>pause</span> and think about what you want to <span>say.<br/></span> 
🎧 You don't have to <span>rush.<br/></span> 
🎧 The more you <span>practice</span>, the more <span>natural</span> it will <span>feel.<br/></span> 
🎧 Okay. I'll <span>try.<br/></span> 
🎧 Sometimes <span>words</span> just get <span>mixed</span> up in my <span>head</span> and I <span>panic.<br/></span> 
🎧 That's <span>totally</span> <span>normal.<br/></span> 
🎧 I still get <span>nervous</span> <span>sometimes,<br/></span> 
🎧 but it's all about taking it one <span>step</span> at a <span>time.<br/></span> 
🎧 And if you ever get <span>stuck</span>, just take a <span>deep</span> <span>breath</span> and start <span>again.<br/></span> 
🎧 No <span>one's</span> <span>perfect.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll keep <span>practicing.<br/></span> 
🎧 I want to get better so I don't have to feel so <span>scared</span> all the <span>time.<br/></span> 
🎧 And you will. <span>You've</span> already made so much <span>progress</span>, <span>Lily.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm really <span>proud</span> of <span>you.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>wouldn't</span> have been able to do it without you, <span>Sharon.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thank you so <span>much.<br/></span> 
🎧 Hey, you're doing all the <span>hard</span> <span>work.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm just here to <span>cheer</span> you <span>on.<br/></span> 
🎧 Alright, class! <span>It's</span> time for our <span>presentations.<br/></span> 
🎧 Who would like to go <span>first?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Teacher</span>, <span>I…</span> <span>I'll</span> go <span>first.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Wonderful</span>! Come on up, <span>Lily.<br/></span> 
🎧 Come <span>on!<br/></span> 
🎧 The key to a <span>successful</span> <span>presentation</span> is <span>preparation</span> and <span>confidence.<br/></span> 
🎧 You've already <span>prepared</span>, so there's <span>nothing</span> to be <span>afraid</span> <span>of.<br/></span> 
🎧 The only thing <span>left</span> to do is <span>believe</span> in <span>yourself.<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>eyes</span> of <span>others</span> can <span>hurt</span> <span>you.<br/></span> 
🎧 Hey. Look at that <span>clumsy</span> <span>girl.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>remember!<br/></span> 
🎧 How did she have the <span>courage</span> to <span>volunteer</span> <span>today?<br/></span> 
🎧 I thought she would be <span>quiet</span> like <span>before.<br/></span> 
🎧 I don't <span>know.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe she just <span>wants</span> <span>attention.<br/></span> 
🎧 Let's see what she can <span>do.<br/></span> 
🎧 Alright. Just <span>remember</span> what <span>Sharon</span> <span>said.<br/></span> 
🎧 Good morning, <span>everyone.<br/></span> 
🎧 Today, I want to talk <span>about…</span> the <span>importance</span> of <span>protecting</span> our <span>environment.<br/></span> 
🎧 We all have a <span>part</span> to play in <span>keeping</span> our <span>planet</span> <span>safe.<br/></span> 
🎧 Simple things like <span>recycling</span> and <span>reducing</span> <span>waste</span> can make a big <span>difference.<br/></span> 
🎧 If we work together, we can <span>create</span> a better future for <span>everyone<br/></span> 
🎧 Thank you for <span>listening.<br/></span> 
🎧 I hope we can all do our <span>part</span> to <span>protect</span> the <span>environment.<br/></span> 
🎧 That was <span>excellent</span>, <span>Lily!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>You've</span> <span>improved</span> so much. <span>I'm</span> very <span>proud</span> of <span>you.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Lily</span>, you were <span>amazing</span> up there! I <span>knew</span> you could do <span>it!<br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks, <span>Sharon</span>. But I still feel like I have a long way to <span>go.<br/></span> 
🎧 I want to get even better at <span>speaking</span> <span>English.<br/></span> 
🎧 And you can definitely do <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 Did you see the <span>surprised</span> look on <span>Danny</span> and his friends <span>faces<br/></span> 
🎧 when you <span>finished</span> your <span>presentation?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm glad I was able to change and <span>improve</span> so <span>quickly.<br/></span> 
🎧 I did. I'm glad I was able to change <span>positively</span> so <span>quickly.<br/></span> 
🎧 As you said, <span>knowing</span> how to <span>speak</span> and <span>communicate<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>gives</span> me the <span>confidence</span> to <span>face</span> other <span>people.<br/></span> 
🎧 You've <span>helped</span> me a <span>lot.<br/></span> 
🎧 Would you like to get something to <span>eat?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'd like to <span>treat</span> you to thank <span>you.<br/></span> 
🎧 Then I can't <span>refuse</span> this <span>tempting</span> <span>invitation!<br/>
</span><br/><br/>
