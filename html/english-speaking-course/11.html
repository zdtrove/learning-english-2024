<h2 id="esc-11-4">Waking up</h2>

🎧 Good morning, <span>Dina</span>. Time to <span>wake</span> <span>up.<br/></span> 
🎧 Just <span>five</span> more <span>minutes</span>, <span>Alex.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Dina!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Alex</span>, are you <span>awake?<br/></span> 
🎧 Did you hear that? Come <span>on!<br/></span> 
🎧 If you <span>stay</span> in bed any <span>longer</span>, you'll be <span>late</span> for <span>school.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Alright.<br/></span> 
🎧 Look, <span>Dina</span>, it's morning <span>already.<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>weather</span> is <span>beautiful</span> <span>today.<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, it really <span>is.<br/></span> 
🎧 I hope today will be <span>wonderful.<br/></span> 
🎧 Get <span>up.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll wait for you so we can <span>brush</span> our <span>teeth</span> <span>together.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll be right <span>there.<br/>
</span><br />

<h2 id="esc-11-55">Brushing teeth</h2>

🎧 <span>Dina</span>, you need to <span>brush</span> for at <span>least</span> two <span>minutes.<br/></span> 
🎧 It helps keep your <span>teeth</span> <span>healthy</span> and <span>strong.<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, I know, I <span>know.<br/></span> 
🎧 You're always <span>reminding</span> <span>me.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you think I don't <span>brush</span> long <span>enough?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm just <span>making</span> sure you have a <span>bright</span> <span>smile.<br/></span> 
🎧 You want to <span>impress</span> your friends, <span>right?<br/></span> 
🎧 But you would say I'm <span>late</span> if I'm <span>slow.<br/></span> 
🎧 I just want to do it as <span>fast</span> as you <span>say.<br/></span> 
🎧 Just <span>1-2</span> <span>minutes</span> won't make you <span>late</span> for <span>class.<br/></span> 
🎧 I only say that because if you <span>sleep</span> for another <span>5</span> <span>minutes,<br/></span> 
🎧 it can become <span>15</span> <span>minutes</span> or <span>half</span> an <span>hour.<br/></span> 
🎧 You will have a <span>hard</span> time <span>controlling</span> <span>yourself</span> because <span>sleep</span> is so <span>attractive.<br/></span> 
🎧 You are really <span>serious</span> about everything, <span>brother.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, thank you. Sometimes you're like another <span>parent.<br/></span> 
🎧 And you are always <span>teasing</span> <span>me.<br/>
</span><br />

<h2 id="esc-11-126">Morning exercise</h2>

🎧 I'm not as young as you <span>are.<br/></span> 
🎧 Just trying to keep us <span>fit.<br/></span> 
🎧 A <span>healthy</span> <span>body</span> <span>means</span> a <span>healthy</span> <span>mind.<br/></span> 
🎧 And you two look <span>funny.<br/></span> 
🎧 Want to join us, <span>Dina?<br/></span> 
🎧 It's good for <span>you.<br/></span> 
🎧 No way! I'll <span>stick</span> to <span>watching.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Exercise</span> isn't my <span>thing.<br/></span> 
🎧 I am <span>preparing</span> <span>breakfast</span>, <span>athletes.<br/></span>

<h2 id="esc-11-233">Getting dressed</h2>

</span><br />

<h2 id="esc-11-974">Preparing dinner</h2>

🎧 <span>Dina</span>, can you help me <span>chop</span> the <span>vegetables?<br/></span> 
🎧 Sure, Mom. I'll <span>wash</span> them <span>first.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Alex</span>, can you set the <span>table?<br/></span> 
🎧 Of course, Dad. How many <span>plates</span> do we <span>need?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Seven</span>. <span>Jimmy's</span> <span>family</span> is <span>joining</span> us for <span>dinner.<br/></span> 
🎧 Great, I'll get everything <span>ready.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll start cooking the <span>pasta.<br/></span> 
🎧 It should be ready in about <span>20</span> <span>minutes.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Dina</span>, can you <span>pass</span> me the <span>onions?<br/></span> 
🎧 Here you go, Mom. I'll start with the <span>tomatoes.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks, <span>sweetie.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Alex</span>, do we have enough <span>drinks</span> for <span>everyone?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, I put some <span>soda</span> and <span>juice</span> in the <span>fridge</span> <span>earlier.<br/>
</span><br />

<h2 id="esc-11-1025">Family time</h2>

🎧 Thanks for having us over, <span>Lisa</span>. The dinner was <span>delicious.<br/></span> 
🎧 You're <span>welcome</span>, <span>Danny.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's always nice to have your <span>family</span> <span>here.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Jimmy</span>, do you want to play a <span>board</span> <span>game?<br/></span> 
🎧 Sure, <span>Dina</span>. Let's play the one with the <span>pirates.<br/></span> 
🎧 These two <span>kids</span> are together all <span>day.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm glad <span>Dina</span> has <span>Jimmy.<br/></span> 
🎧 You know, we're <span>pretty</span> <span>busy</span> and can't <span>spend</span> much time with <span>him.<br/></span> 
🎧 How about we all play together? It will be more <span>fun.<br/></span> 
🎧 Good idea. Let's set up the <span>game.<br/></span> 
🎧 Who <span>wants</span> to be the <span>captain?<br/></span> 
🎧 I do! I love being the <span>captain.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll be the <span>treasure</span> <span>hunter.<br/></span> 
🎧 What about you, <span>Alex?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll be the <span>navigator.<br/></span> 
🎧 Let's start the <span>adventure!<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll be the map <span>reader.<br/></span> 
🎧 Let's find that <span>treasure!<br/></span> 
🎧 This is going to be <span>fun.<br/></span> 
🎧 Let's see who <span>wins.<br/>
</span><br />

<h2 id="esc-11-1097">Watching TV</h2>

🎧 <span>Aunt</span> <span>Emma</span>, can we <span>watch</span> the new <span>superhero</span> <span>movie?<br/></span> 
🎧 Sure, <span>Neo</span>. But only for an <span>hour</span>, <span>okay?<br/></span> 
🎧 You have school <span>tomorrow.<br/></span> 
🎧 Okay. I <span>promise.<br/></span> 
🎧 Can we have some <span>popcorn</span> <span>too?<br/></span> 
🎧 Of course, I'll make some. You get the <span>movie</span> <span>ready.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>found</span> the <span>movie</span>, <span>Aunt</span> <span>Emma</span>! It's <span>starting</span> <span>soon.<br/></span> 
🎧 Great! The <span>popcorn</span> will be ready in a <span>minute.<br/></span> 
🎧 Here you go, <span>Neo</span>. Enjoy the <span>movie.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks, <span>Aunt</span> <span>Emma</span>. This is the best <span>part</span> of the <span>day.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm glad you're <span>enjoying</span> it. <span>Remember</span>, just one <span>hour.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>remember</span>. I'll go to bed right <span>after.<br/>
</span><br />

<h2 id="esc-11-1158">Laundry room</h2>

🎧 More <span>laundry?<br/></span> 
🎧 It never <span>seems</span> to end, does <span>it?<br/></span> 
🎧 Between work, <span>Jimmy's</span> school <span>uniforms,<br/></span> 
🎧 It <span>feels</span> like I'm doing this every <span>day.<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, let's <span>solve</span> this <span>together.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll <span>fold</span> the <span>towels</span> while you <span>sort</span> the <span>clothes.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Deal.<br/></span> 
🎧 By the way, did you <span>notice</span> that <span>Jimmy's</span> <span>shirts</span> are getting more <span>wrinkled</span> these <span>days?<br/></span> 
🎧 I think he's been <span>skipping</span> the <span>ironing.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Ah</span>, I'll have a talk with <span>him.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe we can <span>teach</span> him a thing or two about <span>ironing</span> this <span>weekend.<br/></span> 
🎧 Are you <span>free?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, I <span>am.<br/></span> 
🎧 And that's a good <span>idea.<br/></span> 
🎧 He's doing great at work, but some life <span>skills</span> wouldn't <span>hurt.<br/></span> 
🎧 You know, we make a <span>pretty</span> good <span>team.<br/></span> 
🎧 We <span>do.<br/></span> 
🎧 And it's nice to have some time together, even if it's just <span>folding</span> <span>laundry.<br/></span> 
🎧 Agreed. I'll <span>handle</span> the <span>ironing</span> this <span>weekend.<br/></span> 
🎧 We can make it a <span>family</span> <span>lesson.<br/></span> 
🎧 Sounds like a <span>plan.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe we can even ask <span>Jimmy</span> to help <span>out.<br/>
</span><br />

<h2 id="esc-11-1241">Cleaning the house</h2>

🎧 <span>Alex</span>, can you help me move this <span>rug?<br/></span> 
🎧 I think <span>Buddy's</span> <span>hair</span> is all over <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 Sure, <span>Dina</span>. Let's <span>roll</span> it up and take it outside to <span>shake</span> it <span>out.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you ever feel like we're just <span>moving</span> <span>dirt</span> <span>around?<br/></span> 
🎧 No <span>matter</span> how much we <span>clean</span>, it just <span>keeps</span> <span>coming</span> <span>back.<br/></span> 
🎧 That's just life, <span>Dina</span>. But it's <span>worth</span> it to have a <span>clean</span> <span>house.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Plus</span>, it's kind of nice to see everything <span>neat</span> and <span>tidy.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>guess</span> so. And it <span>feels</span> good to help out, <span>too.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Exactly.<br/></span> 
🎧 And once we're done, we can <span>relax</span> and enjoy the <span>weekend.<br/></span> 
🎧 How about we <span>finish</span> quickly and then take <span>Buddy</span> for a <span>walk</span> <span>later?<br/></span> 
🎧 That sounds <span>awesome!<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll <span>vacuum</span> the living <span>room</span> while you <span>dust</span> the <span>shelves.<br/></span> 
🎧 This place is really <span>starting</span> to <span>shine.<br/></span> 
🎧 We should do this more <span>often.<br/></span> 
🎧 It does feel good, doesn't <span>it?<br/></span> 
🎧 And it's nice that everyone is <span>pitching</span> <span>in.<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, it's a <span>team</span> <span>effort.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe we should make this a <span>weekly</span> <span>thing.<br/></span> 
🎧 I like that <span>idea.<br/></span> 
🎧 We'll keep the house <span>clean</span>, and it <span>gives</span> us some <span>family</span> time <span>together.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's good <span>practice</span> for the <span>kids.<br/></span> 
🎧 They're going to need these <span>skills</span> when they're out on their <span>own.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Absolutely.<br/></span> 
🎧 Let's <span>finish</span> up and see what the <span>kids</span> are up <span>to.<br/>
</span><br />

<h2 id="esc-11-1347">Walking the dog</h2>

🎧 <span>Buddy</span> looks so happy to be <span>outside.<br/></span> 
🎧 I think this is his <span>favorite</span> <span>part</span> of the <span>day.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's probably <span>mine</span>, <span>too.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's nice to get some <span>fresh</span> air after being inside all <span>day.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Plus</span>, <span>Buddy</span> <span>gets</span> to <span>meet</span> all his dog <span>friends.<br/></span> 
🎧 Look, there's <span>Max!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Mrs</span>. <span>Thompson</span>! How's <span>Max</span> <span>doing?<br/></span> 
🎧 He's doing great! <span>Buddy</span> looks like he's having a <span>blast.<br/></span> 
🎧 He always <span>does.<br/></span> 
🎧 They should have a <span>playdate</span> <span>sometime.<br/></span> 
🎧 That's a great idea! We can set something up this <span>weekend.<br/>
</span><br />

<h2 id="esc-11-1400">Talking on the phone</h2>

🎧 Yes, Mr. <span>Johnson,<br/></span> 
🎧 I have <span>reviewed</span> the <span>proposal</span> and I think we are ready to <span>proceed.<br/></span> 
🎧 I will <span>send</span> you the <span>completed</span> <span>documents</span> <span>tomorrow</span> <span>morning.<br/></span> 
🎧 That sounds <span>perfect</span>, <span>Emma.<br/></span> 
🎧 Your <span>team</span> has done an <span>excellent</span> <span>job</span>, as <span>always.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thank <span>you.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll be in touch if there's anything else we need to <span>discuss.<br/></span> 
🎧 Have a great <span>evening.<br/></span> 
🎧 You too, <span>Emma</span>. <span>Goodbye.<br/></span> 
🎧 Another <span>project</span> <span>wrapped</span> up. Now I can <span>finally</span> <span>relax.<br/></span> 
🎧 I should probably check on <span>Neo</span>. He's been so <span>quiet</span> <span>tonight.<br/>
</span><br />

<h2 id="esc-11-1450">Evening exercise</h2>

🎧 It's been a long day, but it's <span>important</span> to keep up with our <span>exercise</span> <span>routine.<br/></span> 
🎧 It is quite <span>difficult</span> to <span>maintain</span> in the <span>beginning.<br/></span> 
🎧 You're doing great, <span>babe.<br/></span> 
🎧 Just take it one <span>step</span> at a <span>time.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks, <span>John.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm trying to <span>stay</span> <span>consistent</span>, but it's kind of <span>hard</span> after a long <span>day.<br/></span> 
🎧 I get it. But even a little bit each day makes a <span>difference.<br/></span> 
🎧 And it helps <span>clear</span> your <span>mind.<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, I feel that. It's like a <span>reset</span> <span>button</span> for the <span>day.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Remember</span> to <span>breathe.<br/></span> 
🎧 And don't <span>forget</span> to <span>stretch</span> after. It'll help you a <span>lot.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>will.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll <span>admit</span>, I've been <span>skipping</span> the <span>stretching</span> <span>part</span> <span>lately.<br/></span> 
🎧 That's the key to <span>staying</span> <span>flexible</span> and <span>avoiding</span> <span>injuries.<br/></span> 
🎧 Let's <span>finish</span> with some <span>stretches</span> <span>together.<br/></span> 
🎧 Definitely going to need <span>it.<br/>
</span><br />

<h2 id="esc-11-1517">Taking a shower</h2>

🎧 This <span>feels</span> <span>amazing.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's the <span>perfect</span> way to end the <span>day.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Diana</span>, <span>sweetheart</span>. Don't <span>forget</span> to <span>wash</span> your <span>hair.<br/></span> 
🎧 And don't take too <span>long.<br/></span> 
🎧 Your <span>brother</span> needs to <span>shower</span>, <span>too.<br/></span> 
🎧 Okay, <span>mom.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm almost <span>done.<br/></span> 
🎧 I should <span>wear</span> a <span>face</span> <span>mask</span> <span>tonight.<br/></span> 
🎧 My <span>skin</span> <span>feels</span> a bit <span>dry.<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>bathroom's</span> all <span>yours</span>, <span>Alex.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks, <span>Diana</span>. I'll be <span>quick.<br/></span> 
🎧 No <span>rush.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm just going to <span>relax</span> in my <span>room.<br/>
</span><br />

<h2 id="esc-11-1561">Planning tomorrow</h2>

🎧 Let's <span>see.<br/></span> 
🎧 I've got that <span>meeting</span> at <span>10</span> <span>a.m,<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>followed</span> by lunch with Mr. <span>Collins.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll need to <span>prepare</span> those <span>documents</span> <span>tonight.<br/></span> 
🎧 I should also <span>review</span> the <span>team's</span> <span>ideas</span> on the <span>project.<br/></span> 
🎧 I want to make sure <span>everything's</span> on <span>track.<br/></span> 
🎧 Here's your <span>lotus</span> tea. <span>Drink</span> it before bed to help you <span>sleep.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks, <span>Mom.<br/></span> 
🎧 What are you <span>doing?<br/></span> 
🎧 I just want to <span>review</span> some work for <span>tomorrow.<br/></span> 
🎧 Don't <span>overdo</span> <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 Your <span>health</span> is the most <span>important</span> <span>thing.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks, <span>mom.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll be done in a <span>bit.<br/></span> 
🎧 Good <span>night</span>, <span>Mom.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll probably <span>chat</span> with <span>Dina</span> for a bit before I go to <span>bed.<br/></span> 
🎧 Good <span>night.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's going to be a <span>hectic</span> day, but I'm <span>ready.<br/></span> 
🎧 Just need to get a good <span>night's</span> <span>sleep.<br/>
</span><br />

<h2 id="esc-11-1629">Brushing hair</h2>

🎧 Your <span>hair</span> looks <span>lovely</span>, <span>Dina.<br/></span> 
🎧 You've been doing a great <span>job</span> taking <span>care</span> of your <span>hair.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's so <span>shiny</span> and <span>healthy.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks, <span>Mom.<br/></span> 
🎧 I've been trying to <span>brush</span> it every <span>night</span> before <span>bed.<br/></span> 
🎧 I also use the <span>conditioner</span> that you <span>bought</span> for <span>me.<br/></span> 
🎧 That's a good <span>habit</span> to <span>have.<br/></span> 
🎧 And it's nice to have these <span>moments</span> together, isn't <span>it?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah. It <span>is.<br/></span> 
🎧 I like it when you <span>braid</span> my <span>hair.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's <span>relaxing.<br/></span> 
🎧 Me <span>too.<br/></span> 
🎧 It <span>reminds</span> me of when you were <span>little.<br/></span> 
🎧 You've <span>grown</span> up so <span>fast.<br/></span> 
🎧 But I'll always be your little girl, <span>right?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Always.<br/></span> 
🎧 Now I will read a little before going to <span>bed.<br/></span> 
🎧 Okay, <span>sweetie</span>, but <span>remember</span> not to read too <span>long.<br/>
</span><br />

<h2 id="esc-11-1686">Reading a book</h2>

🎧 <span>"The</span> <span>detective</span> <span>examined</span> the <span>footprint</span> <span>closely,<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>noticing</span> the <span>faint</span> <span>trace</span> of <span>mud</span> on the <span>heel…"<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>"Who</span> could it <span>be?"<br/></span> 
🎧 This <span>mystery</span> book is so <span>interesting.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>wonder</span> who the <span>thief</span> <span>is.<br/></span> 
🎧 Time to go to <span>sleep</span>, <span>Dina</span>. Don't <span>stay</span> up too <span>late</span> <span>reading.<br/></span> 
🎧 I know, Mom, but the <span>story</span> is just so <span>good!<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm at the <span>part</span> where they're about to catch the <span>thief.<br/></span> 
🎧 I know how that <span>feels.<br/></span> 
🎧 But you don't want to be <span>tired</span> <span>tomorrow</span>, do <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 Just one more <span>chapter</span>, <span>please.<br/></span> 
🎧 Alright, but only <span>one.<br/></span> 
🎧 I love you, <span>Mom.<br/></span> 
🎧 Good girl. <span>Sleep</span> <span>tight</span> and don't <span>stay</span> up too <span>late.<br/></span>

</span><br />

<h2 id="esc-11-1744">Setting an alarm</h2>

🎧 <span>Neo</span>, are you still not <span>asleep?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, <span>Aunt</span> <span>Emma.<br/></span> 
🎧 I must have <span>eaten</span> too much <span>popcorn</span> while <span>watching</span> the <span>movie.<br/></span> 
🎧 So I'm so full that I can't <span>sleep.<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, <span>Neo.<br/></span> 
🎧 You have to get up <span>early</span> <span>tomorrow</span> for <span>school.<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, <span>Aunt</span> <span>Emma</span>, <span>​​can</span> you set the <span>alarm</span> for <span>me?<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>forgot</span> about <span>that.<br/></span> 
🎧 Okay, I'll do <span>it<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Done.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you want me to read you a book to help you <span>sleep?<br/></span> 
🎧 I think there's no need, <span>Aunt</span> <span>Emma</span>. You have to work <span>tomorrow.<br/></span> 
🎧 Good <span>boy.<br/>
</span><br />

<h2 id="esc-11-1796">Going to bed</h2>

🎧 <span>Remember</span> to <span>dust</span> off the <span>blanket</span> before going to bed, <span>son.<br/></span> 
🎧 Sure, <span>Mom.<br/></span> 
🎧 Today was a good <span>day.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>finished</span> my <span>homework</span> and had a great time with <span>Dina.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>wonder</span> what <span>tomorrow</span> will <span>bring.<br/></span> 
🎧 I hope it's just as good as <span>today.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's great having <span>Dina</span> <span>around.<br/></span> 
🎧 Her <span>family</span> is so nice and <span>kind.<br/></span> 
🎧 They <span>invited</span> us to dinner so we could <span>spend</span> time <span>together.<br/></span> 
🎧 That's right. I'm so <span>happy.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Tomorrow</span> I'll <span>continue</span> to do <span>homework</span> with <span>Dina,<br/></span> 
🎧 and then help with the <span>housework.<br/></span> 
🎧 I really want to help you and <span>Dad.<br/></span> 
🎧 Such a good boy, <span>Jimmy.<br/></span> 
🎧 This weekend, we plan to <span>teach</span> you how to <span>iron</span> <span>clothes</span> <span>properly.<br/></span> 
🎧 Would you like to join <span>us?<br/></span>

</span><br /><br/><br/>
