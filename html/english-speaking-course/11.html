🎧 Just <span>five</span> more <span>minutes</span>, <span>Alex</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Dina</span>!<br/> 
🎧 <span>Alex</span>, are you <span>awake</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Did you hear that? Come <span>on</span>!<br/> 
🎧 If you <span>stay</span> in bed any <span>longer</span>, you'll be <span>late</span> for <span>school</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Alright</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Look, <span>Dina</span>, it's morning <span>already</span>.<br/> 
🎧 The <span>weather</span> is <span>beautiful</span> <span>today</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, it really <span>is</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I hope today will be wonderful.<br/> 
🎧 Get <span>up</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'll wait for you so we can <span>brush</span> our <span>teeth</span> <span>together</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'll be right <span>there.<br/>

🎧 <span>Dina</span>, you need to <span>brush</span> for at <span>least</span> two <span>minutes</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It helps keep your <span>teeth</span> <span>healthy</span> and <span>strong</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, I know, I <span>know</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You're always <span>reminding</span> <span>me</span>.<br/>

🎧 I'm just <span>making</span> sure you have a <span>bright</span> <span>smile</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You want to <span>impress</span> your friends, <span>right</span>?<br/> 
🎧 But you would say I'm <span>late</span> if I'm <span>slow</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I just want to do it as <span>fast</span> as you <span>say</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Just <span>1-2</span> <span>minutes</span> won't make you <span>late</span> for <span>class</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I only say that because if you <span>sleep</span> for another <span>5</span> <span>minutes</span>,<br/> 
🎧 it can become <span>15</span> <span>minutes</span> or <span>half</span> an <span>hour</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You will have a <span>hard</span> time <span>controlling</span> yourself because <span>sleep</span> is so <span>attractive</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You are really serious about everything, <span>brother</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Anyway</span>, thank you. Sometimes you're like another <span>parent</span>.<br/> 
🎧 And you are always <span>teasing</span> <span>me.<br/>

🎧 Between work, <span>Jimmy's</span> school <span>uniforms</span>,<br/> 
🎧 It <span>feels</span> like I'm doing this every <span>day</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Well, let's <span>solve</span> this <span>together</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'll <span>fold</span> the <span>towels</span> while you <span>sort</span> the <span>clothes</span>.<br/>

🎧 By the way, did you <span>notice</span> that <span>Jimmy's</span> <span>shirts</span> are getting more <span>wrinkled</span> these <span>days</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I think he's been <span>skipping</span> the <span>ironing</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Ah, I'll have a talk with <span>him</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe we can <span>teach</span> him a thing or two about <span>ironing</span> this <span>weekend</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Are you <span>free</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, I <span>am</span>.<br/> 
🎧 And that's a good <span>idea</span>.<br/> 
🎧 He's doing great at work, but some life <span>skills</span> wouldn't <span>hurt</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You know, we make a <span>pretty</span> good <span>team</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We <span>do</span>.<br/> 
🎧 And it's nice to have some time together, even if it's just <span>folding</span> <span>laundry</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Agreed. I'll <span>handle</span> the <span>ironing</span> this <span>weekend</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We can make it a <span>family</span> <span>lesson</span>.<br/>

🎧 I think <span>Buddy's</span> <span>hair</span> is all over <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Sure, <span>Dina</span>. Let's <span>roll</span> it up and take it outside to <span>shake</span> it <span>out</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Do you ever feel like we're just <span>moving</span> <span>dirt</span> <span>around</span>?<br/> 
🎧 No <span>matter</span> how much we <span>clean</span>, it just <span>keeps</span> <span>coming</span> <span>back</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That's just life, <span>Dina</span>. But it's <span>worth</span> it to have a <span>clean</span> <span>house</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Plus</span>, it's kind of nice to see everything <span>neat</span> and <span>tidy</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I <span>guess</span> so. And it <span>feels</span> good to help out, too.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Exactly</span>.<br/> 
🎧 And once we're done, we can <span>relax</span> and enjoy the <span>weekend</span>.<br/> 
🎧 How about we <span>finish</span> quickly and then take <span>Buddy</span> for a <span>walk</span> <span>later</span>?<br/> 
🎧 That sounds <span>awesome</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I'll <span>vacuum</span> the living room while you <span>dust</span> the <span>shelves</span>.<br/> 
🎧 This place is really <span>starting</span> to <span>shine</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We should do this more often.<br/> 
🎧 It does feel good, doesn't <span>it</span>?<br/> 
🎧 And it's nice that everyone is <span>pitching</span> <span>in</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, it's a <span>team</span> <span>effort</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe we should make this a <span>weekly</span> <span>thing</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I like that <span>idea</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We'll keep the house <span>clean</span>, and it <span>gives</span> us some <span>family</span> time <span>together</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's good practice for the <span>kids</span>.<br/> 
🎧 They're going to need these <span>skills</span> when they're out on their <span>own</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Absolutely</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Let's <span>finish</span> up and see what the <span>kids</span> are up <span>to.<br/>

🎧 I think this is his <span>favorite</span> <span>part</span> of the <span>day</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's probably <span>mine</span>, too.<br/> 
🎧 It's nice to get some <span>fresh</span> air after being inside all <span>day</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Plus</span>, <span>Buddy</span> <span>gets</span> to meet all his dog <span>friends</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Look, there's <span>Max</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Mrs. <span>Thompson</span>! How's <span>Max</span> doing?<br/> 
🎧 He's doing great! <span>Buddy</span> looks like he's having a <span>blast</span>.<br/> 
🎧 He always <span>does</span>.<br/> 
🎧 They should have a <span>playdate</span> <span>sometime</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That's a great idea! We can set something up this <span>weekend.<br/>

🎧 I'm trying to <span>stay</span> <span>consistent</span>, but it's kind of <span>hard</span> after a long <span>day</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I get it. But even a little bit each day makes a <span>difference</span>.<br/> 
🎧 And it helps <span>clear</span> your <span>mind</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, I feel that. It's like a <span>reset</span> <span>button</span> for the <span>day</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Remember</span> to <span>breathe</span>.<br/> 
🎧 And don't <span>forget</span> to <span>stretch</span> after. It'll help you a <span>lot</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I <span>will</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'll <span>admit</span>, I've been <span>skipping</span> the <span>stretching</span> <span>part</span> lately.<br/> 
🎧 That's the key to <span>staying</span> <span>flexible</span> and <span>avoiding</span> <span>injuries</span>.<br/>
