<h2 id="esc-11-4">Waking</span> <span>up</h2>

</span> <span><br/>
</span> Good morning, <span>Dina</span>. Time to <span>wake</span> <span>up.<br/>
</span> Just <span>five</span> more <span>minutes</span>, <span>Alex.<br/>
</span> <span>Dina!<br/>
</span> <span>Alex</span>, are you <span>awake?<br/>
</span> Did you hear that? Come <span>on!<br/>
</span> If you <span>stay</span> in bed any <span>longer</span>, you'll be <span>late</span> for <span>school.<br/>
</span> <span>Alright.<br/>
</span> Look, <span>Dina</span>, it's morning <span>already.<br/>
</span> The <span>weather</span> is <span>beautiful</span> <span>today.<br/>
</span> Oh, it really <span>is.<br/>
</span> I hope today will be <span>wonderful.<br/>
</span> Get <span>up.<br/>
</span> I'll wait for you so we can <span>brush</span> our <span>teeth</span> <span>together.<br/>
</span> I'll be right <span>there.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span> <span>

<h2 id="esc-11-55">Brushing</span> <span>teeth</h2>

</span> <span><br/>
</span> <span>Dina</span>, you need to <span>brush</span> for at <span>least</span> two <span>minutes.<br/>
</span> It helps keep your <span>teeth</span> <span>healthy</span> and <span>strong.<br/>
</span> Oh, I know, I <span>know.<br/>
</span> You're always <span>reminding</span> <span>me.<br/>
</span> Do you think I don't <span>brush</span> long <span>enough?<br/>
</span> I'm just <span>making</span> sure you have a <span>bright</span> <span>smile.<br/>
</span> You want to <span>impress</span> your friends, <span>right?<br/>
</span> But you would say I'm <span>late</span> if I'm <span>slow.<br/>
</span> I just want to do it as <span>fast</span> as you <span>say.<br/>
</span> Just <span>1-2</span> <span>minutes</span> won't make you <span>late</span> for <span>class.<br/>
</span> I only say that because if you <span>sleep</span> for another <span>5</span> <span>minutes,<br/>
</span> it can become <span>15</span> <span>minutes</span> or <span>half</span> an <span>hour.<br/>
</span> You will have a <span>hard</span> time <span>controlling</span> <span>yourself</span> because <span>sleep</span> is so <span>attractive.<br/>
</span> You are really <span>serious</span> about everything, <span>brother.<br/>
</span> <span>Anyway</span>, thank you. Sometimes you're like another <span>parent.<br/>
</span> And you are always <span>teasing</span> <span>me.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span> <span>

<h2 id="esc-11-126">Morning</span> <span>exercise</h2>

</span> <span><br/>
</span> Come on, Dad. Let's do ten more <span>push-ups</span>! <span>You've</span> got <span>this.<br/>
</span> You're really <span>pushing</span> me today, <span>Alex.<br/>
</span> I'm not as young as you <span>are.<br/>
</span> Just trying to keep us <span>fit.<br/>
</span> A <span>healthy</span> <span>body</span> <span>means</span> a <span>healthy</span> <span>mind.<br/>
</span> And you two look <span>funny.<br/>
</span> Want to join us, <span>Dina?<br/>
</span> It's good for <span>you.<br/>
</span> No way! I'll <span>stick</span> to <span>watching.<br/>
</span> <span>Exercise</span> isn't my <span>thing.<br/>
</span> I am <span>preparing</span> <span>breakfast</span>, <span>athletes.<br/>
</span> You <span>guys</span> should get <span>ready.<br/>
</span> Thanks, Mom. <span>We'll</span> be right <span>there.<br/>
</span> Great <span>workout</span>, <span>son.<br/>
</span> Now let's <span>refuel</span> with some <span>delicious</span> <span>breakfast.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span> <span>

<h2 id="esc-11-181">Making</span> <span>breakfast</h2>

</span> <span><br/>
</span> Thanks for <span>helping</span>, <span>Alex.<br/>
</span> Can you <span>pass</span> me the <span>eggs?<br/>
</span> Sure, Mom. Here you <span>go.<br/>
</span> Do you need me to cut the <span>vegetables</span> <span>too?<br/>
</span> That would be <span>wonderful</span>. Thank <span>you.<br/>
</span> It's always nice to have an <span>extra</span> <span>pair</span> of <span>hands.<br/>
</span> It <span>smells</span> so good, <span>Mom.<br/>
</span> What are you <span>making</span> <span>today?<br/>
</span> I'm <span>starving.<br/>
</span> What's for <span>breakfast?<br/>
</span> <span>Scrambled</span> <span>eggs</span>, <span>toast</span> and <span>orange</span> <span>juice.<br/>
</span> <span>Plus</span>, <span>Alex</span> is <span>cutting</span> some <span>vegetables</span> for an <span>omelet.<br/>
</span> And some <span>fruit</span>, too. We have <span>bananas</span> and <span>apples.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span> <span>

<h2 id="esc-11-233">Getting</span> <span>dressed</h2>

</span> <span><br/>
</span> <span>Dina</span>, do you need any help <span>picking</span> out your <span>clothes?<br/>
</span> No, Mom. I think I got <span>it.<br/>
</span> But can you help me find my <span>blue</span> <span>sweater?<br/>
</span> <span>Okay.<br/>
</span> Don't <span>forget</span> to <span>pack</span> your <span>bags</span>, <span>sweetie.<br/>
</span> Sure <span>Mom.<br/>
</span> <span>Dina</span>, your <span>blue</span> <span>sweater</span> is in the <span>laundry</span> <span>room.<br/>
</span> Thanks <span>Mom.<br/>
</span> And <span>wear</span> something <span>warm.<br/>
</span> It's <span>chilly</span> <span>outside.<br/>
</span> Don't <span>forget</span> your <span>jackets.<br/>
</span> Got it, <span>Dad.<br/>
</span> Ready, <span>Alex?<br/>
</span> Almost, Just need my <span>shoes.<br/>
</span> Do you think this <span>outfit</span> looks <span>okay?<br/>
</span> You look great. Now <span>hurry</span> up so we can get <span>going.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span> <span>

<h2 id="esc-11-288">Commuting</span> to <span>work</h2>

</span> See you this <span>afternoon</span>, <span>babe.<br/>
</span> Dad, I'll <span>walk</span> home with <span>Jimmy</span> <span>today.<br/>
</span> You don't have to <span>pick</span> me <span>up.<br/>
</span> Really? <span>Okay.<br/>
</span> <span>Jimmy</span> just <span>moved</span> here, but you two are so <span>close.<br/>
</span> I'm so very happy about <span>that.<br/>
</span> Yes, <span>Jimmy</span> is in the same class as me, so we often do <span>homework</span> <span>together.<br/>
</span> He helps me a <span>lot.<br/>
</span> It's great to have such a good <span>friend.<br/>
</span> We're here, <span>Dina</span>. Have a nice <span>day.<br/>
</span> Thanks, Dad, have a good day at <span>work.<br/>

</span> Could <span>I?<br/>
</span> Of course. Good <span>boy.<br/>
</span> It's a <span>reward</span> for going <span>shopping</span> with me to <span>prepare</span> <span>meals.<br/>
</span> I love you the most, <span>Aunt</span> <span>Emma!<br/>
</span> Let's <span>head</span> to the <span>checkout.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span> <span>

<h2 id="esc-11-974">Preparing</span> <span>dinner</h2>

</span> <span><br/>
</span> <span>Dina</span>, can you help me <span>chop</span> the <span>vegetables?<br/>
</span> Sure, Mom. <span>I'll</span> <span>wash</span> them <span>first.<br/>
</span> <span>Alex</span>, can you set the <span>table?<br/>
</span> Of course, Dad. How many <span>plates</span> do we <span>need?<br/>
</span> <span>Seven</span>. <span>Jimmy's</span> <span>family</span> is <span>joining</span> us for <span>dinner.<br/>
</span> Great, <span>I'll</span> get everything <span>ready.<br/>
</span> I'll start cooking the <span>pasta.<br/>
</span> It should be ready in about <span>20</span> <span>minutes.<br/>
</span> <span>Dina</span>, can you <span>pass</span> me the <span>onions?<br/>
</span> Here you go, Mom. <span>I'll</span> start with the <span>tomatoes.<br/>
</span> Thanks, <span>sweetie.<br/>
</span> <span>Alex</span>, do we have enough <span>drinks</span> for <span>everyone?<br/>
</span> Yes, I put some <span>soda</span> and <span>juice</span> in the <span>fridge</span> <span>earlier.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span> <span>

<h2 id="esc-11-1025">Family</span> <span>time</h2>

</span> <span><br/>
</span> Thanks for having us over, <span>Lisa</span>. The dinner was <span>delicious.<br/>
</span> <span>You're</span> <span>welcome</span>, <span>Danny.<br/>
</span> <span>It's</span> always nice to have your <span>family</span> <span>here.<br/>
</span> <span>Jimmy</span>, do you want to play a <span>board</span> <span>game?<br/>
</span> Sure, <span>Dina</span>. <span>Let's</span> play the one with the <span>pirates.<br/>
</span> These two <span>kids</span> are together all <span>day.<br/>
</span> I'm glad <span>Dina</span> has <span>Jimmy.<br/>
</span> You know, we're <span>pretty</span> <span>busy</span> and can't <span>spend</span> much time with <span>him.<br/>
</span> How about we all play together? It will be more <span>fun.<br/>
</span> Good idea. Let's set up the <span>game.<br/>
</span> Who <span>wants</span> to be the <span>captain?<br/>
</span> I do! I love being the <span>captain.<br/>
</span> I'll be the <span>treasure</span> <span>hunter.<br/>
</span> What about you, <span>Alex?<br/>
</span> I'll be the <span>navigator.<br/>
</span> Let's start the <span>adventure!<br/>
</span> I'll be the map <span>reader.<br/>
</span> Let's find that <span>treasure!<br/>
</span> This is going to be <span>fun.<br/>
</span> Let's see who <span>wins.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span> <span>

<h2 id="esc-11-1097">Watching</span> <span>TV</h2>

</span> <span><br/>
</span> <span>Aunt</span> <span>Emma</span>, can we <span>watch</span> the new <span>superhero</span> <span>movie?<br/>
</span> Sure, <span>Neo</span>. But only for an <span>hour</span>, <span>okay?<br/>
</span> You have school <span>tomorrow.<br/>
</span> Okay. I <span>promise.<br/>
</span> Can we have some <span>popcorn</span> <span>too?<br/>
</span> Of course, I'll make some. You get the <span>movie</span> <span>ready.<br/>
</span> I <span>found</span> the <span>movie</span>, <span>Aunt</span> <span>Emma</span>! <span>It's</span> <span>starting</span> <span>soon.<br/>
</span> Great! The <span>popcorn</span> will be ready in a <span>minute.<br/>
</span> Here you go, <span>Neo</span>. Enjoy the <span>movie.<br/>
</span> Thanks, <span>Aunt</span> <span>Emma</span>. This is the best <span>part</span> of the <span>day.<br/>
</span> <span>I'm</span> glad <span>you're</span> <span>enjoying</span> it. <span>Remember</span>, just one <span>hour.<br/>
</span> I <span>remember</span>. I'll go to bed right <span>after.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span> <span>

<h2 id="esc-11-1158">Laundry</span> <span>room</h2>

</span> <span><br/>
</span> More <span>laundry?<br/>
</span> It never <span>seems</span> to end, does <span>it?<br/>
</span> Between work, <span>Jimmy's</span> school <span>uniforms,<br/>
</span> It <span>feels</span> like I'm doing this every <span>day.<br/>
</span> Well, let's <span>solve</span> this <span>together.<br/>
</span> <span>I'll</span> <span>fold</span> the <span>towels</span> while you <span>sort</span> the <span>clothes.<br/>
</span> <span>Deal.<br/>
</span> By the way, did you <span>notice</span> that <span>Jimmy's</span> <span>shirts</span> are getting more <span>wrinkled</span> these <span>days?<br/>
</span> I think he's been <span>skipping</span> the <span>ironing.<br/>
</span> <span>Ah</span>, <span>I'll</span> have a talk with <span>him.<br/>
</span> Maybe we can <span>teach</span> him a thing or two about <span>ironing</span> this <span>weekend.<br/>
</span> Are you <span>free?<br/>
</span> Yes, I <span>am.<br/>
</span> And that's a good <span>idea.<br/>
</span> <span>He's</span> doing great at work, but some life <span>skills</span> <span>wouldn't</span> <span>hurt.<br/>
</span> You know, we make a <span>pretty</span> good <span>team.<br/>
</span> We <span>do.<br/>
</span> And <span>it's</span> nice to have some time together, even if <span>it's</span> just <span>folding</span> <span>laundry.<br/>
</span> Agreed. I'll <span>handle</span> the <span>ironing</span> this <span>weekend.<br/>
</span> We can make it a <span>family</span> <span>lesson.<br/>
</span> Sounds like a <span>plan.<br/>
</span> Maybe we can even ask <span>Jimmy</span> to help <span>out.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span> <span>

<h2 id="esc-11-1241">Cleaning</span> the <span>house</h2>

</span> <span><br/>
</span> <span>Alex</span>, can you help me move this <span>rug?<br/>
</span> I think <span>Buddy's</span> <span>hair</span> is all over <span>it.<br/>
</span> Sure, <span>Dina</span>. <span>Let's</span> <span>roll</span> it up and take it outside to <span>shake</span> it <span>out.<br/>
</span> Do you ever feel like we're just <span>moving</span> <span>dirt</span> <span>around?<br/>
</span> No <span>matter</span> how much we <span>clean</span>, it just <span>keeps</span> <span>coming</span> <span>back.<br/>
</span> <span>That's</span> just life, <span>Dina</span>. But <span>it's</span> <span>worth</span> it to have a <span>clean</span> <span>house.<br/>
</span> <span>Plus</span>, <span>it's</span> kind of nice to see everything <span>neat</span> and <span>tidy.<br/>
</span> I <span>guess</span> so. And it <span>feels</span> good to help out, <span>too.<br/>
</span> <span>Exactly.<br/>
</span> And once we're done, we can <span>relax</span> and enjoy the <span>weekend.<br/>
</span> How about we <span>finish</span> quickly and then take <span>Buddy</span> for a <span>walk</span> <span>later?<br/>
</span> That sounds <span>awesome!<br/>
</span> I'll <span>vacuum</span> the living <span>room</span> while you <span>dust</span> the <span>shelves.<br/>
</span> This place is really <span>starting</span> to <span>shine.<br/>
</span> We should do this more <span>often.<br/>
</span> It does feel good, doesn't <span>it?<br/>
</span> And it's nice that everyone is <span>pitching</span> <span>in.<br/>
</span> Yeah, it's a <span>team</span> <span>effort.<br/>
</span> Maybe we should make this a <span>weekly</span> <span>thing.<br/>
</span> I like that <span>idea.<br/>
</span> We'll keep the house <span>clean</span>, and it <span>gives</span> us some <span>family</span> time <span>together.<br/>
</span> It's good <span>practice</span> for the <span>kids.<br/>
</span> They're going to need these <span>skills</span> when they're out on their <span>own.<br/>
</span> <span>Absolutely.<br/>
</span> Let's <span>finish</span> up and see what the <span>kids</span> are up <span>to.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span> <span>

<h2 id="esc-11-1347">Walking</span> the <span>dog</h2>

</span> <span><br/>
</span> <span>Buddy</span> looks so happy to be <span>outside.<br/>
</span> I think this is his <span>favorite</span> <span>part</span> of the <span>day.<br/>
</span> It's probably <span>mine</span>, <span>too.<br/>
</span> It's nice to get some <span>fresh</span> air after being inside all <span>day.<br/>
</span> <span>Plus</span>, <span>Buddy</span> <span>gets</span> to <span>meet</span> all his dog <span>friends.<br/>
</span> Look, <span>there's</span> <span>Max!<br/>
</span> <span>Mrs</span>. <span>Thompson</span>! <span>How's</span> <span>Max</span> <span>doing?<br/>
</span> <span>He's</span> doing great! <span>Buddy</span> looks like <span>he's</span> having a <span>blast.<br/>
</span> He always <span>does.<br/>
</span> They should have a <span>playdate</span> <span>sometime.<br/>
</span> <span>That's</span> a great idea! We can set something up this <span>weekend.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span> <span>

<h2 id="esc-11-1400">Talking</span> on the <span>phone</h2>

</span> <span><br/>
</span> Yes, Mr. <span>Johnson,<br/>
</span> I have <span>reviewed</span> the <span>proposal</span> and I think we are ready to <span>proceed.<br/>
</span> I will <span>send</span> you the <span>completed</span> <span>documents</span> <span>tomorrow</span> <span>morning.<br/>
</span> That sounds <span>perfect</span>, <span>Emma.<br/>
</span> Your <span>team</span> has done an <span>excellent</span> <span>job</span>, as <span>always.<br/>
</span> Thank <span>you.<br/>
</span> <span>I'll</span> be in touch if <span>there's</span> anything else we need to <span>discuss.<br/>
</span> Have a great <span>evening.<br/>
</span> You too, <span>Emma</span>. <span>Goodbye.<br/>
</span> Another <span>project</span> <span>wrapped</span> up. Now I can <span>finally</span> <span>relax.<br/>
</span> I should probably check on <span>Neo</span>. <span>He's</span> been so <span>quiet</span> <span>tonight.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span> <span>

<h2 id="esc-11-1450">Evening</span> <span>exercise</h2>

</span> <span><br/>
</span> <span>It's</span> been a long day, but <span>it's</span> <span>important</span> to keep up with our <span>exercise</span> <span>routine.<br/>
</span> It is quite <span>difficult</span> to <span>maintain</span> in the <span>beginning.<br/>
</span> You're doing great, <span>babe.<br/>
</span> Just take it one <span>step</span> at a <span>time.<br/>
</span> Thanks, <span>John.<br/>
</span> <span>I'm</span> trying to <span>stay</span> <span>consistent</span>, but <span>it's</span> kind of <span>hard</span> after a long <span>day.<br/>
</span> I get it. But even a little bit each day makes a <span>difference.<br/>
</span> And it helps <span>clear</span> your <span>mind.<br/>
</span> Yeah, I feel that. <span>It's</span> like a <span>reset</span> <span>button</span> for the <span>day.<br/>
</span> <span>Remember</span> to <span>breathe.<br/>
</span> And <span>don't</span> <span>forget</span> to <span>stretch</span> after. <span>It'll</span> help you a <span>lot.<br/>
</span> I <span>will.<br/>
</span> <span>I'll</span> <span>admit</span>, <span>I've</span> been <span>skipping</span> the <span>stretching</span> <span>part</span> <span>lately.<br/>
</span> That's the key to <span>staying</span> <span>flexible</span> and <span>avoiding</span> <span>injuries.<br/>
</span> Let's <span>finish</span> with some <span>stretches</span> <span>together.<br/>
</span> Definitely going to need <span>it.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span> <span>

<h2 id="esc-11-1517">Taking</span> a <span>shower</h2>

</span> <span><br/>
</span> This <span>feels</span> <span>amazing.<br/>
</span> It's the <span>perfect</span> way to end the <span>day.<br/>
</span> <span>Diana</span>, <span>sweetheart</span>. Don't <span>forget</span> to <span>wash</span> your <span>hair.<br/>
</span> And don't take too <span>long.<br/>
</span> Your <span>brother</span> needs to <span>shower</span>, <span>too.<br/>
</span> Okay, <span>mom.<br/>
</span> I'm almost <span>done.<br/>
</span> I should <span>wear</span> a <span>face</span> <span>mask</span> <span>tonight.<br/>
</span> My <span>skin</span> <span>feels</span> a bit <span>dry.<br/>
</span> The <span>bathroom's</span> all <span>yours</span>, <span>Alex.<br/>
</span> Thanks, <span>Diana</span>. I'll be <span>quick.<br/>
</span> No <span>rush.<br/>
</span> I'm just going to <span>relax</span> in my <span>room.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span> <span>

<h2 id="esc-11-1561">Planning</span> <span>tomorrow</h2>

</span> <span><br/>
</span> Let's <span>see.<br/>
</span> I've got that <span>meeting</span> at <span>10</span> <span>a.m,<br/>
</span> <span>followed</span> by lunch with Mr. <span>Collins.<br/>
</span> I'll need to <span>prepare</span> those <span>documents</span> <span>tonight.<br/>
</span> I should also <span>review</span> the <span>team's</span> <span>ideas</span> on the <span>project.<br/>
</span> I want to make sure <span>everything's</span> on <span>track.<br/>
</span> Here's your <span>lotus</span> tea. <span>Drink</span> it before bed to help you <span>sleep.<br/>
</span> Thanks, <span>Mom.<br/>
</span> What are you <span>doing?<br/>
</span> I just want to <span>review</span> some work for <span>tomorrow.<br/>
</span> Don't <span>overdo</span> <span>it.<br/>
</span> Your <span>health</span> is the most <span>important</span> <span>thing.<br/>
</span> Thanks, <span>mom.<br/>
</span> I'll be done in a <span>bit.<br/>
</span> Good <span>night</span>, <span>Mom.<br/>
</span> I'll probably <span>chat</span> with <span>Dina</span> for a bit before I go to <span>bed.<br/>
</span> Good <span>night.<br/>
</span> It's going to be a <span>hectic</span> day, but I'm <span>ready.<br/>
</span> Just need to get a good <span>night's</span> <span>sleep.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span> <span>

<h2 id="esc-11-1629">Brushing</span> <span>hair</h2>

</span> <span><br/>
</span> Your <span>hair</span> looks <span>lovely</span>, <span>Dina.<br/>
</span> You've been doing a great <span>job</span> taking <span>care</span> of your <span>hair.<br/>
</span> It's so <span>shiny</span> and <span>healthy.<br/>
</span> Thanks, <span>Mom.<br/>
</span> I've been trying to <span>brush</span> it every <span>night</span> before <span>bed.<br/>
</span> I also use the <span>conditioner</span> that you <span>bought</span> for <span>me.<br/>
</span> That's a good <span>habit</span> to <span>have.<br/>
</span> And it's nice to have these <span>moments</span> together, isn't <span>it?<br/>
</span> Yeah. It <span>is.<br/>
</span> I like it when you <span>braid</span> my <span>hair.<br/>
</span> It's <span>relaxing.<br/>
</span> Me <span>too.<br/>
</span> It <span>reminds</span> me of when you were <span>little.<br/>
</span> You've <span>grown</span> up so <span>fast.<br/>
</span> But I'll always be your little girl, <span>right?<br/>
</span> <span>Always.<br/>
</span> Now I will read a little before going to <span>bed.<br/>
</span> Okay, <span>sweetie</span>, but <span>remember</span> not to read too <span>long.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span> <span>

<h2 id="esc-11-1686">Reading</span> a <span>book</h2>

</span> <span><br/>
</span> <span>"The</span> <span>detective</span> <span>examined</span> the <span>footprint</span> <span>closely,<br/>
</span> <span>noticing</span> the <span>faint</span> <span>trace</span> of <span>mud</span> on the <span>heel…"<br/>
</span> <span>"Who</span> could it <span>be?"<br/>
</span> This <span>mystery</span> book is so <span>interesting.<br/>
</span> I <span>wonder</span> who the <span>thief</span> <span>is.<br/>
</span> Time to go to <span>sleep</span>, <span>Dina</span>. <span>Don't</span> <span>stay</span> up too <span>late</span> <span>reading.<br/>
</span> I know, Mom, but the <span>story</span> is just so <span>good!<br/>
</span> I'm at the <span>part</span> where they're about to catch the <span>thief.<br/>
</span> I know how that <span>feels.<br/>
</span> But you don't want to be <span>tired</span> <span>tomorrow</span>, do <span>you?<br/>
</span> Just one more <span>chapter</span>, <span>please.<br/>
</span> Alright, but only <span>one.<br/>
</span> I love you, <span>Mom.<br/>
</span> Good girl. <span>Sleep</span> <span>tight</span> and don't <span>stay</span> up too <span>late.<br/>
</span> <span>Goodnight</span>, <span>Mom.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span> <span>

<h2 id="esc-11-1744">Setting</span> an <span>alarm</h2>

</span> <span><br/>
</span> <span>Neo</span>, are you still not <span>asleep?<br/>
</span> Yes, <span>Aunt</span> <span>Emma.<br/>
</span> I must have <span>eaten</span> too much <span>popcorn</span> while <span>watching</span> the <span>movie.<br/>
</span> So I'm so full that I can't <span>sleep.<br/>
</span> Oh, <span>Neo.<br/>
</span> You have to get up <span>early</span> <span>tomorrow</span> for <span>school.<br/>
</span> Oh, <span>Aunt</span> <span>Emma</span>, <span>​​can</span> you set the <span>alarm</span> for <span>me?<br/>
</span> I <span>forgot</span> about <span>that.<br/>
</span> Okay, I'll do <span>it<br/>
</span> <span>Done.<br/>
</span> Do you want me to read you a book to help you <span>sleep?<br/>
</span> I think there's no need, <span>Aunt</span> <span>Emma</span>. You have to work <span>tomorrow.<br/>
</span> Good <span>boy.<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span> <span>

<h2 id="esc-11-1796">Going</span> to <span>bed</h2>

</span> <span><br/>
</span> <span>Remember</span> to <span>dust</span> off the <span>blanket</span> before going to bed, <span>son.<br/>
</span> Sure, <span>Mom.<br/>
</span> Today was a good <span>day.<br/>
</span> I <span>finished</span> my <span>homework</span> and had a great time with <span>Dina.<br/>
</span> I <span>wonder</span> what <span>tomorrow</span> will <span>bring.<br/>
</span> I hope it's just as good as <span>today.<br/>
</span> It's great having <span>Dina</span> <span>around.<br/>
</span> Her <span>family</span> is so nice and <span>kind.<br/>
</span> They <span>invited</span> us to dinner so we could <span>spend</span> time <span>together.<br/>
</span> That's right. I'm so <span>happy.<br/>
</span> <span>Tomorrow</span> <span>I'll</span> <span>continue</span> to do <span>homework</span> with <span>Dina,<br/>
</span> and then help with the <span>housework.<br/>
</span> I really want to help you and <span>Dad.<br/>
</span> Such a good boy, <span>Jimmy.<br/>
</span> This weekend, we plan to <span>teach</span> you how to <span>iron</span> <span>clothes</span> <span>properly.<br/>
</span> Would you like to join <span>us?<br/>
</span> Of course, <span>Mom.<br/>
</span> It's been a long time since we had time <span>together.<br/>
</span> <span>Deal.<br/>
</span> Alright. <span>Sleep</span> <span>tight</span>, <span>Jimmy.<br/>
</span> Good <span>night</span>, <span>Mom.<br/>
</span> Even though <span>they're</span> <span>busy</span>, they still make time for <span>me.<br/>
</span> Time to <span>sleep!<br/>
</span><br/><br/>
