<h2>Family Life</h2>

🎧 Good morning! How is everyone <span>today</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Good morning, <span>honey</span>! I'm feeling good. And <span>you</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I have a lot of work to do, but it should be <span>okay</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You're <span>lucky</span>! I'm feeling <span>terrible</span> right <span>now<br/></span> 
🎧 What's wrong, <span>Lily</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I'm having a <span>math</span> <span>test</span> this morning! <span>Urgh</span>! I <span>hate</span> <span>math</span>!<br/> 
🎧 <span>Math</span> <span>tests</span> can be <span>tough</span>, but you'll be <span>fine</span>, <span>honey</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Your dad is right! You will do <span>well</span>!<br/> 
🎧 No, you don't <span>understand</span> how <span>hard</span> <span>math</span> can <span>be</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Of course we do! We once went to school, just like <span>you</span>!<br/> 
🎧 If so, can you tell me how to <span>pass</span> the <span>test</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Just <span>stay</span> <span>calm</span>, and <span>remember</span> what you <span>studied</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I don't even <span>understand</span> what I <span>studied</span>!<br/> 
🎧 <span>Lily</span>, if you need help, just ask. We're here for <span>you</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Thanks, Dad. Maybe I will need <span>lots</span> of it <span>later</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Hey, <span>kiddo</span>, I have an <span>important</span> <span>meeting</span> today, too! Let's do our best, <span>alright</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Fine</span>, <span>Dad..</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Now, does <span>anyone</span> want some <span>milk</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I'll <span>pass</span> <span>that</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I <span>prefer</span> a <span>fresh</span> cup of <span>orange</span> <span>juice<br/></span> 
🎧 in the <span>morning</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Here you are! And you, <span>Lily</span>? Would you like <span>some</span>?<br/> 
🎧 No, thanks, Mom! I think I will <span>skip</span> <span>breakfast</span> <span>today</span>!<br/> 
🎧 You should eat something or else your <span>brain</span> won't <span>work</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Listen to your mom, <span>Lily</span>! Here, have some <span>pancakes</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Thanks, <span>Dad</span>!<br/> 
🎧 <span>Donna</span>, did you <span>invite</span> <span>anyone</span> else for dinner <span>tonight</span>?<br/> 
🎧 No, <span>why</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Because <span>Aunt</span> <span>Martha</span> is at the <span>door</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span> no, not her <span>again</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Mom, I don't want to <span>deal</span> with her <span>today</span>.<br/> 
🎧 She always <span>complains</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Neither</span> do I, <span>honey</span>!<br/> 
🎧 What should we <span>do</span>?<br/> 
🎧 You <span>guys</span> <span>stay</span> here. I'll <span>handle</span> <span>this</span>!<br/> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span>, what a <span>surprise</span>!<br/> 
🎧 What are you doing <span>here</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I don't know, <span>Donna</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I thought I'd <span>drop</span> by for <span>dinner</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span>, <span>Aunt</span> <span>Martha</span>! You should have told us <span>earlier</span>!<br/> 
🎧 A little <span>surprise</span> is nice, isn't <span>it</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Well, <span>unfortunately</span>, I'm not sure you should join us for dinner <span>today</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Why <span>not</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Because we have some <span>pasta<br/></span> 
🎧 with <span>lots</span> of <span>nuts</span> in <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span> my! <span>Nuts?!</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Yes, and as <span>far</span> as I <span>remember</span>, you're <span>allergic</span> to them, <span>right</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Definitely! They can <span>send</span> me <span>straight</span> to the <span>emergency</span> <span>room</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Maybe you should let us know if you want to come next time, <span>Auntie</span>?<br/> 
🎧 You're right! What a <span>shame</span>! I just <span>wanted</span> to see you <span>all</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe another <span>time</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Alright, maybe another time. I'll just go <span>then</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That was <span>close</span>. Why is she always <span>dropping</span> by <span>uninvited</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I don't know. But it's better she didn't come <span>in</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Let's hope we don't have to do that <span>again</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Agreed. Now, let's enjoy our <span>dinner</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, <span>finally</span>! I'm <span>starving</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Alright, let's get some <span>milk</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Which <span>brand</span> should we <span>buy</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I think we should get the big <span>brand</span>. We always do, <span>right</span>?<br/> 
🎧 No, I <span>prefer</span> the <span>local</span> <span>brand</span>. It's <span>cheaper</span> and better <span>quality</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But look at this one! It's on <span>sale</span>. We should get <span>this</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But the <span>local</span> <span>brand</span> is <span>tastier..</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I can't tell the <span>difference</span>, <span>honey</span>!<br/> 
🎧 That's because you've never <span>tried</span> it <span>before</span>!<br/> 
🎧 How about we get <span>both</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Are you <span>sure</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I'm sure we can <span>compare</span> and see which one we like <span>best</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Alright, if you say <span>so</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Now, let's move on to the next <span>aisle</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span>, right. We still need to get some <span>bread</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Did Dad tell you what kind of <span>bread</span> he <span>wanted</span> us to <span>buy</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Urgh</span>! I <span>completely</span> <span>forgot</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Well, I <span>guess</span> we'll have to <span>call</span> him to find out <span>then</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Mom, we need <span>eggs</span>, too! We ran out this <span>morning</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I see. A <span>dozen</span> should be <span>enough</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, and don't <span>forget</span> we're also out of <span>orange</span> <span>juice</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Speaking</span> of <span>juice</span>, do we need anything for dinner? Like <span>pasta</span> or <span>something</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span>, good idea. I think we're low on <span>pasta</span>. Maybe some <span>sauce</span> <span>too</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Definitely</span>.<br/> 
🎧 And I think we need some <span>snacks</span> for the weekend as <span>well</span>!<br/> 
🎧 How about some <span>chips</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Chips</span> sound good. And maybe some <span>cookies</span> <span>too</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Sure, <span>cookies</span> it is! Alright, let's <span>grab</span> all that and then <span>call</span> Dad about the <span>bread</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Hey, Mom, Dad, I'm thinking about getting a <span>part</span> <span>-</span> time <span>job</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Really? That's great! What kind of <span>job</span> are you <span>looking</span> <span>at</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Well, I'm not sure. I have two <span>options</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What are <span>they</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I can work at the <span>fast</span> food <span>place<br/></span> 
🎧 or do <span>babysitting</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, both sound <span>good</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What do you think about the <span>fast</span> food <span>place</span>?<br/> 
🎧 It's <span>close</span> to school, and I'll be working with <span>friends</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That sounds <span>great</span>!<br/> 
🎧 But it might be really <span>busy</span> and <span>noisy</span>.<br/> 
🎧 And what about <span>babysitting</span>? How do you feel about <span>that</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Babysitting</span> is <span>quieter</span> and I like <span>kids<br/></span> 
🎧 This <span>option</span> isn't bad <span>either</span>!<br/> 
🎧 But it might be less money and I'd have to go to different <span>houses</span>.<br/> 
🎧 So, what do you <span>think</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I'm thinking about working at a <span>fast</span> food place. <span>But..</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>But</span>?<br/> 
🎧 But it might be more <span>stressful</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Lily</span>, working with <span>kids</span> is also <span>stressful</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Your mom is right! Working with <span>kids</span> and playing with them are <span>different</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Now you're <span>scaring</span> <span>me</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I want you to know what you are getting <span>in</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Well, if you say so, I think I will go for the <span>fast</span> food <span>job</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Alright then, <span>fast</span> food <span>job</span> it is! When will you <span>start</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I haven't even <span>sent</span> my <span>resume</span> <span>yet</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Tell me if you need help with your <span>resume</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Thanks, Dad! I <span>will</span>!<br/> 
🎧 <span>Guys</span>! Sit up! We need to <span>talk</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Why are you <span>looking</span> so <span>serious</span>, Mom? Am I in <span>trouble</span>?<br/> 
🎧 What's up, <span>honey</span>? Is everything <span>okay</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Not really. We need to talk about house <span>chores</span>. It's getting <span>messy</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Is it? I think everything is going <span>well..</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Don't you <span>see?</span>! Our house is a <span>mess</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Alright, alright! So, what do you think we should <span>do</span>?<br/> 
🎧 We need to <span>clean</span> it up right <span>away</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Right <span>now?</span>! But I'm in the <span>middle</span> of this <span>movie</span>! Can we do it <span>later</span>?<br/> 
🎧 The <span>movie</span> can wait! The house <span>can't</span>!<br/> 
🎧 <span>Fine</span>! What do you want me to <span>do</span>?<br/> 
🎧 First, you need to <span>clean</span> up your <span>bedroom</span> and <span>bathroom</span>. They're <span>disasters</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Got it, <span>Mom</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I'll take <span>care</span> of the <span>second</span> <span>floor</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Well, I can do the <span>vacuuming</span> and take out the <span>trash</span>.<br/> 
🎧 And please <span>clear</span> out the <span>garage</span> as well, <span>honey</span>!<br/> 
🎧 What's wrong with the <span>garage</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Everything! You <span>left</span> your <span>tools</span> <span>everywhere</span> after you <span>fixed</span> the car last <span>week</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Alright. I'll put them <span>away</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Thanks! I really <span>appreciate</span> it! And don't <span>forget</span> to <span>mow</span> the <span>lawn</span>!<br/> 
🎧 But I just did it last <span>week</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I know, but the <span>grass</span> has <span>already</span> <span>grown</span>!<br/> 
🎧 <span>Fine..</span>. I think I really need a good <span>massage</span> after <span>this</span>.<br/> 
🎧 So do I, <span>Dad</span>!<br/> 
🎧 So, about our <span>summer</span> <span>trip</span>, where should we go this <span>year</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I was thinking about the <span>beach</span>. It would be nice to <span>relax</span> by the <span>sea</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That sounds great! I love the <span>beach</span>. We could <span>swim</span> and <span>build</span> <span>sandcastles</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But didn't we go to the <span>beach</span> last <span>year</span>?<br/> 
🎧 So? <span>Beaches</span> are always great, aren't <span>they</span>?<br/> 
🎧 The <span>beach</span> is nice, but I was also thinking about a <span>mountain</span> <span>trip</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What can we do on a <span>mountain?</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Well, we can <span>hike</span> and enjoy <span>nature</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Mountains</span> are <span>beautiful</span>, but we'd need more <span>preparation</span>. The <span>beach</span> is <span>simpler</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Plus</span>, the <span>beach</span> sounds more fun to <span>me</span>!<br/> 
🎧 How about a place that has both a <span>beach</span> and <span>mountains</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Do such <span>places</span> <span>exist</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, <span>actually</span>. Some <span>places</span> have both. We could look for a <span>location</span> like <span>that</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That sounds like a good idea. We get the best of both <span>worlds</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'm in! And it'll be better if there are some <span>local</span> <span>attractions</span>, like <span>museums</span> or <span>parks</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I hope <span>so</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Sounds like a <span>plan</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Awesome</span>! I can't wait to start <span>planning</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Me too. I'll look up some <span>places</span> and we can <span>decide</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Great. This is going to be a fun <span>trip</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Definitely. I'm <span>looking</span> forward to <span>it</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Mom, Dad, I want to have a <span>sleepover</span> <span>party</span> this <span>weekend</span>!<br/> 
🎧 A <span>sleepover</span>? That sounds fun. Who's <span>coming</span>?<br/> 
🎧 My friend <span>Mina</span>. We'll have <span>snacks</span>, <span>games</span>, and <span>movies</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Sounds like a good time. What day are you <span>thinking</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Saturday</span> <span>night</span>. <span>Mina</span> can come after dinner. Is that <span>okay</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Saturday</span> <span>works</span> for us. But we need to plan a few <span>things</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Sure, what do we need to <span>do</span>?<br/> 
🎧 We need to make sure we have enough <span>snacks</span> and <span>drinks</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Yes, and we should <span>clean</span> the living <span>room</span> so there's <span>space</span> to play <span>games</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Well, <span>actually</span>, <span>Mina</span> and I will be in my <span>room</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Lily</span>, that's just an <span>excuse</span> your mom <span>uses</span> to get you to <span>clean</span> up the <span>house</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Hey, I don't want <span>Mina</span> to come to a <span>messy</span> house, <span>alright</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Fine</span>, Mom! I'll make sure the house looks <span>neat</span> before she <span>comes</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Thank you, <span>Lily</span>!<br/> 
🎧 What are you going to <span>watch</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span>, <span>Mina</span> and I want to <span>watch</span> some <span>comedies</span> and maybe a <span>scary</span> <span>movie</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That sounds <span>perfect</span> for a <span>sleepover</span> <span>party</span>!<br/> 
🎧 But make sure you go to bed before <span>11</span> <span>pm</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Mom, who <span>sleeps</span> before <span>11</span> <span>pm</span> at a <span>sleepover</span> <span>party</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Lily's</span> right, <span>honey</span>. It's <span>Saturday</span>. They can <span>stay</span> up a bit <span>late</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Well, before <span>midnight</span> <span>then</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'll try my best, Mom! But please don't be mad if we're still <span>awake</span> after <span>midnight</span>!<br/> 
🎧 As long as you're up at <span>7</span> am for <span>breakfast</span>, I'll be <span>fine</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Who <span>gets</span> up at <span>7</span> am on a <span>Sunday?</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Well, I <span>do</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Honey</span>, just let the <span>girls</span> <span>sleep</span> in! We can enjoy our own morning in <span>peace</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Hm..</span>. Well, you're <span>right
</span>.<br/><br/><br/>
