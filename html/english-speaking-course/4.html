🎧 Wow, that's <span>beautiful</span>! What <span>song</span> is that?<br/> 
🎧 Thanks! It's a <span>traditional</span> <span>tune</span> called <span>"Song</span> of the <span>Night</span> <span>Wind."</span><br/> 
🎧 <span>Welcome</span> to the <span>market</span>! Can I <span>interest</span> you in <span>anything</span>?<br/> 
🎧 The music is enough for me, but maybe later.<br/> 
🎧 Do you play here often?<br/> 
🎧 You're really good.<br/> 
🎧 Most <span>nights</span>. Music is my <span>passion</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Where are you <span>visiting</span> <span>from</span>?<br/> 
🎧 All over! I love <span>exploring</span> new <span>places</span> and <span>experiencing</span> the <span>culture</span>.<br/> 
🎧 This <span>market</span> is <span>amazing</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Then you must see the <span>silk</span> <span>scarves</span> over there.<br/> 
🎧 They're <span>perfect</span> for <span>dancing</span> under the <span>stars</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Dancing</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Is there a <span>party</span> <span>tonight</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Not exactly, but the music always <span>draws</span> a <span>crowd</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Do you like to <span>dance</span>?<br/> 
🎧 More than anything! I can't <span>resist</span> a good <span>beat</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Then why don't you show me your <span>moves</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I can <span>provide</span> the <span>music</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Challenge</span> <span>accepted</span>!<br/> <br/> 

<h2 id="esc-4-73">What is your favorite holiday? <b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this, 73)">🔊</b></h2>

🎧 This place has a really nice <span>atmosphere</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Perfect</span> for a first <span>date</span>, wouldn't you <span>say</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Absolutely. It's even better than I <span>expected</span> from the <span>pictures</span> online.<br/> 
🎧 So, <span>Daniel</span>, tell me a bit about <span>yourself</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What do you like to do for fun outside of work?<br/> 
🎧 Well, I'm a bit of a movie <span>buff</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I try to catch at <span>least</span> a <span>couple</span> of new <span>releases</span> every <span>month</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What about you?<br/> 
🎧 Any <span>hidden</span> <span>talents</span> or <span>hobbies</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, not exactly <span>hidden</span>, but I love <span>baking</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Especially</span> <span>cakes</span> and <span>pastries</span>.<br/> 
🎧 There's something so <span>relaxing</span> about <span>creating</span> something <span>delicious</span> from <span>scratch</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Speaking</span> of next <span>dates</span>, what's your <span>favorite</span> <span>holiday</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Does that sound like a <span>weird</span> <span>question</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Not at <span>all</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Actually, it's a great way to learn about <span>someone's</span> <span>traditions</span> and <span>interests</span>.<br/> 
🎧 For me, it's <span>hard</span> to choose between <span>Thanksgiving</span> and New <span>Year's</span> <span>Eve</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Thanksgiving</span> because of the big <span>family</span> <span>gathering</span> and <span>delicious</span> <span>food</span>,<br/> 
🎧 and New <span>Year's</span> because it's a <span>chance</span> for a <span>fresh</span> <span>start</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Interesting</span>! I love <span>Thanksgiving</span> too,<br/> 
🎧 but my <span>favorite</span> is probably the <span>summer</span> <span>solstice</span> <span>festival</span> in my <span>hometown</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We have a <span>huge</span> <span>bonfire</span>, live music, and everyone <span>wears</span> <span>flower</span> <span>crowns</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's a <span>real</span> <span>celebration</span> of life and <span>nature</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Wow, that sounds <span>amazing</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I'd love to <span>experience</span> something like that <span>someday</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe we could even plan a <span>trip</span> around <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Who <span>knows</span>, maybe we'll be <span>celebrating</span> <span>summer</span> <span>solstice</span> together next <span>year</span>.<br/> <br/>

🎧 Hey there, sorry about the <span>barking</span>!<br/> 
🎧 He <span>gets</span> <span>excited</span> around other <span>people</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Don't <span>worry</span> at all. He looks <span>friendly</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Golden</span> <span>retrievers</span> are the <span>best</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What's his <span>name</span>?<br/> 
🎧 This is <span>Charlie</span>. He <span>keeps</span> me <span>company</span> on my <span>walks</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What about you?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Training</span> for a <span>marathon</span> or just <span>enjoying</span> the day?<br/> 
🎧 Just a <span>casual</span> <span>jog</span> to <span>clear</span> my <span>head</span> after work.<br/> 
🎧 It's <span>amazing</span> how a little <span>exercise</span> can <span>improve</span> your <span>mood</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Do you like to <span>exercise</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I try to!<br/> 
🎧 <span>Walking</span> <span>Charlie</span> is definitely a <span>workout</span> in <span>itself</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Sometimes I go for a <span>swim</span> too, <span>especially</span> on hot <span>days</span> like this.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Swimming</span> sounds <span>refreshing</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I used to do <span>gymnastics</span> when I was <span>younger</span>,<br/> 
🎧 but these <span>days</span> it's <span>mostly</span> <span>running</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Wow, <span>gymnastics</span>! That takes some <span>serious</span> <span>dedication</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe you could <span>teach</span> <span>Charlie</span> a <span>trick</span> or <span>two</span>?<br/> 
🎧 He'd love that.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Mind</span> if <span>Charlie</span> <span>joins</span> you on your next <span>lap</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Maybe you two can become <span>running</span> <span>buddies</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Running</span> <span>buddies</span>? I think <span>Charlie</span> would love that <span>company</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Perfect</span>!<br/> <br/>

🎧 So, to <span>distract</span> <span>ourselves</span>, what is your <span>favorite</span> <span>TV</span> show?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Movies</span>, definitely! Big <span>action</span> <span>films</span> and <span>comedies</span> are my <span>favorites</span>.<br/>

🎧 I <span>understand</span> that!<br/> 
🎧 What about <span>TV</span> <span>shows</span>? Any good <span>ones</span> you <span>recommend</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, there's this new <span>sci-fi</span> show I <span>love</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's about a <span>group</span> of <span>astronauts</span> <span>exploring</span> a <span>strange</span> <span>planet</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What's the name of the show? Maybe I'll give it a <span>try</span>.<br/>

🎧 You got that right.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Speaking</span> of good food, what's your <span>favorite</span> <span>dessert</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, that's a tough one.<br/> 
🎧 I love a <span>classic</span> <span>slice</span> of <span>chocolate</span> <span>cake</span>,<br/> 
🎧 but there's something so <span>comforting</span> about a <span>warm</span> <span>apple</span> <span>pie</span> with a <span>scoop</span> of <span>vanilla</span> ice <span>cream</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What about you?<br/> 
🎧 I love a good <span>brownie</span>, <span>especially</span> with some <span>chopped</span> <span>nuts</span> and a <span>glass</span> of <span>cold</span> <span>milk</span>.<br/> <br/>

🎧 Maybe you could share some <span>stories</span> sometime?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Depends</span> on the <span>story</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Anything <span>involving</span> <span>explosions</span> or <span>zombies</span> and the <span>fries</span> are all <span>yours</span>.<br/>

🎧 Wow, that sounds <span>adorable</span>!<br/>
