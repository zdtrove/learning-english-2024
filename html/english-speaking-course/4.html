<h2>Do you like to dance?</h2>

🎧 Wow, that's <span>beautiful</span>! What <span>song</span> is <span>that?<br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks! It's a <span>traditional</span> <span>tune</span> <span>called</span> <span>"Song</span> of the <span>Night</span> <span>Wind."<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Welcome</span> to the <span>market</span>! Can I <span>interest</span> you in <span>anything?<br/></span> 
🎧 The music is enough for me, but maybe <span>later.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you play here <span>often?<br/></span> 
🎧 You're really <span>good.<br/></span> 
🎧 Most <span>nights</span>. Music is my <span>passion.<br/></span> 
🎧 Where are you <span>visiting</span> <span>from?<br/></span> 
🎧 All over! I love <span>exploring</span> new <span>places</span> and <span>experiencing</span> the <span>culture.<br/></span> 
🎧 This <span>market</span> is <span>amazing!<br/></span> 
🎧 Then you <span>must</span> see the <span>silk</span> <span>scarves</span> over <span>there.<br/></span> 
🎧 They're <span>perfect</span> for <span>dancing</span> under the <span>stars.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Dancing?<br/></span> 
🎧 Is there a <span>party</span> <span>tonight?<br/></span> 
🎧 Not exactly, but the music always <span>draws</span> a <span>crowd.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you like to <span>dance?<br/></span> 
🎧 More than anything! I can't <span>resist</span> a good <span>beat.<br/></span> 
🎧 Then why don't you <span>show</span> me your <span>moves?<br/></span> 
🎧 I can <span>provide</span> the <span>music.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Challenge</span> <span>accepted!<br/></span> 
🎧 This place has a really nice <span>atmosphere.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Perfect</span> for a first <span>date</span>, wouldn't you <span>say?<br/></span> 
🎧 Absolutely. It's even better than I <span>expected</span> from the <span>pictures</span> <span>online.<br/></span> 
🎧 So, <span>Daniel</span>, tell me a bit about <span>yourself.<br/></span> 
🎧 What do you like to do for fun outside of <span>work?<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, I'm a bit of a <span>movie</span> <span>buff.<br/></span> 
🎧 I try to catch at <span>least</span> a <span>couple</span> of new <span>releases</span> every <span>month.<br/></span> 
🎧 What about <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 Any <span>hidden</span> <span>talents</span> or <span>hobbies?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, not exactly <span>hidden</span>, but I love <span>baking.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Especially</span> <span>cakes</span> and <span>pastries.<br/></span> 
🎧 There's something so <span>relaxing</span> about <span>creating</span> something <span>delicious</span> from <span>scratch.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Speaking</span> of next <span>dates</span>, what's your <span>favorite</span> <span>holiday?<br/></span> 
🎧 Does that sound like a <span>weird</span> <span>question?<br/></span> 
🎧 Not at <span>all.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Actually</span>, it's a great way to learn about <span>someone's</span> <span>traditions</span> and <span>interests.<br/></span> 
🎧 For me, it's <span>hard</span> to choose between <span>Thanksgiving</span> and New <span>Year's</span> <span>Eve.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Thanksgiving</span> because of the big <span>family</span> <span>gathering</span> and <span>delicious</span> <span>food,<br/></span> 
🎧 and New <span>Year's</span> because it's a <span>chance</span> for a <span>fresh</span> <span>start.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Interesting</span>! I love <span>Thanksgiving</span> <span>too,<br/></span> 
🎧 but my <span>favorite</span> is probably the <span>summer</span> <span>solstice</span> <span>festival</span> in my <span>hometown.<br/></span> 
🎧 We have a <span>huge</span> <span>bonfire</span>, live music, and everyone <span>wears</span> <span>flower</span> <span>crowns.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's a <span>real</span> <span>celebration</span> of life and <span>nature.<br/></span> 
🎧 Wow, that sounds <span>amazing!<br/></span> 
🎧 I'd love to <span>experience</span> something like that <span>someday.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe we could even plan a <span>trip</span> around <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 Who <span>knows</span>, maybe we'll be <span>celebrating</span> <span>summer</span> <span>solstice</span> together next <span>year.<br/></span> 
🎧 Hey there, <span>sorry</span> about the <span>barking!<br/></span> 
🎧 He <span>gets</span> <span>excited</span> around other <span>people.<br/></span> 
🎧 Don't <span>worry</span> at all. He looks <span>friendly.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Golden</span> <span>retrievers</span> are the <span>best.<br/></span> 
🎧 What's his <span>name?<br/></span> 
🎧 This is <span>Charlie</span>. He <span>keeps</span> me <span>company</span> on my <span>walks.<br/></span> 
🎧 What about <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Training</span> for a <span>marathon</span> or just <span>enjoying</span> the <span>day?<br/></span> 
🎧 Just a <span>casual</span> <span>jog</span> to <span>clear</span> my <span>head</span> after <span>work.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's <span>amazing</span> how a little <span>exercise</span> can <span>improve</span> your <span>mood.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you like to <span>exercise?<br/></span> 
🎧 I try <span>to!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Walking</span> <span>Charlie</span> is definitely a <span>workout</span> in <span>itself.<br/></span> 
🎧 Sometimes I go for a <span>swim</span> too, <span>especially</span> on hot <span>days</span> like <span>this.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Swimming</span> sounds <span>refreshing.<br/></span> 
🎧 I used to do <span>gymnastics</span> when I was <span>younger,<br/></span> 
🎧 but these <span>days</span> it's <span>mostly</span> <span>running.<br/></span> 
🎧 Wow, <span>gymnastics</span>! That takes some <span>serious</span> <span>dedication.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe you could <span>teach</span> <span>Charlie</span> a <span>trick</span> or <span>two?<br/></span> 
🎧 He'd love <span>that.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Mind</span> if <span>Charlie</span> <span>joins</span> you on your next <span>lap?<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe you two can become <span>running</span> <span>buddies.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Running</span> <span>buddies</span>? I think <span>Charlie</span> would love that <span>company.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Perfect!<br/></span> 
🎧 First time at the <span>dentist</span>? You <span>seem</span> a little <span>tense.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe a <span>little.<br/></span> 
🎧 Need a <span>cavity</span> <span>filled</span>, <span>nothing</span> <span>major.<br/></span> 
🎧 What about <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Nervous</span> about the <span>drill?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Actually</span>, I'm just here for a <span>checkup</span>. <span>Hopefully</span>, a <span>quick</span> <span>one!<br/></span> 
🎧 So, to <span>distract</span> <span>ourselves</span>, what is your <span>favorite</span> <span>TV</span> <span>show?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Movies</span>, definitely! Big <span>action</span> <span>films</span> and <span>comedies</span> are my <span>favorites.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's a good way to <span>escape</span> from <span>reality</span>, you <span>know?<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>understand</span> <span>that!<br/></span> 
🎧 What about <span>TV</span> <span>shows</span>? Any good <span>ones</span> you <span>recommend?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, there's this new <span>sci-fi</span> <span>show</span> I <span>love.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's about a <span>group</span> of <span>astronauts</span> <span>exploring</span> a <span>strange</span> <span>planet.<br/></span> 
🎧 What's the name of the <span>show</span>? Maybe I'll give it a <span>try.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's <span>called</span> <span>"Galaxy</span> <span>Quest."<br/></span> 
🎧 It's <span>pretty</span> <span>popular</span>, so you might have <span>heard</span> of it <span>already.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>actually</span> haven't! But thanks for the <span>recommendation.<br/></span> 
🎧 Wow, what is that <span>incredible</span> <span>smell?<br/></span> 
🎧 It <span>smells</span> like <span>heaven.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Bonjour</span>! That would be my <span>croissants</span>, <span>fresh</span> out of the <span>oven</span> this <span>morning.<br/></span> 
🎧 Would you like to try <span>one?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Croissants</span>? They look <span>amazing</span>! Yes, <span>please!<br/></span> 
🎧 Here you go. Be <span>careful</span>, it's <span>hot!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span>, my <span>gosh</span>, this is the best thing I have ever <span>tasted!<br/></span> 
🎧 So <span>buttery</span> and <span>flaky...<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm glad you like <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 We use a special <span>recipe</span> here, <span>passed</span> down through <span>generations.<br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks for <span>inviting</span> me over, <span>Mary.<br/></span> 
🎧 No <span>problem</span> at <span>all.<br/></span> 
🎧 Always happy to <span>cook</span> for a good <span>friend.<br/></span> 
🎧 And <span>besides</span>, I <span>knew</span> you'd <span>appreciate</span> a <span>break</span> from <span>instant</span> <span>ramen.<br/></span> 
🎧 You got that <span>right.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Speaking</span> of good food, what's your <span>favorite</span> <span>dessert?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, that's a <span>tough</span> <span>one.<br/></span> 
🎧 I love a <span>classic</span> <span>slice</span> of <span>chocolate</span> <span>cake,<br/></span> 
🎧 but there's something so <span>comforting</span> about a <span>warm</span> <span>apple</span> <span>pie</span> with a <span>scoop</span> of <span>vanilla</span> ice <span>cream.<br/></span> 
🎧 What about <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 I love a good <span>brownie</span>, <span>especially</span> with some <span>chopped</span> <span>nuts</span> and a <span>glass</span> of <span>cold</span> <span>milk.<br/></span> 
🎧 Still <span>reading</span> that same <span>book?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Lost</span> in the <span>world</span> again. It's <span>amazing!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Fantasy</span> <span>adventure</span>, <span>huh</span>? Not my thing, but you <span>seem</span> <span>hooked.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's more than <span>that.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's about <span>friendship</span> and <span>loyalty..</span>. you know, the <span>important</span> <span>stuff.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Loyalty?<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you have a best friend, <span>besides</span> <span>fictional</span> <span>characters?<br/></span> 
🎧 You <span>kidding</span>? You're <span>stuck</span> with me, <span>remember?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>True</span>, <span>true.<br/></span> 
🎧 But <span>seriously</span>, do you have <span>someone</span> you tell everything <span>to?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Someone</span> who <span>gets</span> <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Absolutely.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>We've</span> been together for ten <span>years.<br/></span> 
🎧 Now that's the kind of <span>loyalty</span> I can <span>appreciate.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Dude</span>, where'd you get all that food? <span>Sharing</span> <span>fries?<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe. <span>Depends</span> on your <span>answer</span> to a very <span>important</span> <span>question.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Shoot</span>. <span>Math</span> <span>test</span> <span>tomorrow</span>, do you need <span>notes</span> or <span>something?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Nope</span>. <span>Easier</span>. What is your <span>favorite</span> <span>subject</span> in <span>school?<br/></span> 
🎧 The one you <span>actually</span> enjoy, not the one that <span>puts</span> you to <span>sleep.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Easy</span>. <span>Art</span> class. <span>Hands</span> <span>down.<br/></span> 
🎧 Getting <span>messy</span>, <span>creating</span> <span>stuff..</span>. way better than <span>memorizing</span> <span>random</span> <span>numbers.<br/></span> 
🎧 Sounds <span>cool</span>. I'm all about English <span>class.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Telling</span> <span>stories</span>, <span>analyzing</span> <span>characters..</span>. <span>feels</span> like <span>stepping</span> into another <span>world.<br/></span> 
🎧 Are you good at <span>making</span> them up <span>yourself?<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe. I <span>write</span> sometimes in a <span>secret</span> <span>notebook.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Nothing</span> too <span>serious.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe you could share some <span>stories</span> <span>sometime?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Depends</span> on the <span>story.<br/></span> 
🎧 Anything <span>involving</span> <span>explosions</span> or <span>zombies</span> and the <span>fries</span> are all <span>yours.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Deal!<br/></span> 
🎧 Hey <span>Nadia</span>! Nice <span>drawing</span> in class <span>today.<br/></span> 
🎧 Where are you <span>headed?<br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks! Just to the <span>park.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Sunshine</span> and <span>fresh</span> air, you know? Maybe <span>draw</span> a <span>bit.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you like to <span>draw</span> or <span>paint</span> at <span>all?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, I want to learn, but I can't <span>draw</span> like you <span>now!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Cool</span>! I was just about to play <span>frisbee</span> with <span>Ben</span>. Want to <span>join?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hmm..</span>. <span>frisbee</span>, <span>huh</span>? Sounds fun, but I'm not very <span>sporty.<br/></span> 
🎧 No <span>worries</span>! It's <span>easy.<br/></span> 
🎧 You just <span>throw</span> the <span>frisbee</span> and catch <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 You make it sound <span>interesting.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Okay</span>, maybe I'll give it a <span>try.<br/></span> 
🎧 Not <span>really.<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm more into <span>sports</span> and <span>video</span> <span>games.<br/></span> 
🎧 But hey, maybe you can <span>teach</span> me some <span>drawing</span> <span>stuff</span> <span>sometime?<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe! But first, let's see if I can catch this game without <span>making</span> a <span>complete</span> <span>mess.<br/></span> 
🎧 Hey <span>Noah</span>, what are you <span>looking</span> at on your <span>phone?<br/></span> 
🎧 It's a <span>video</span> about red <span>pandas.<br/></span> 
🎧 They're so <span>cute.<br/></span> 
🎧 Red <span>pandas</span>? I don't think I've ever <span>seen</span> <span>one.<br/></span> 
🎧 What do they look <span>like?<br/></span> 
🎧 They're kind of a mix between a fox and a <span>raccoon.<br/></span> 
🎧 But they're red and <span>fluffy</span> with a long, <span>bushy</span> <span>tail.<br/></span> 
🎧 Wow, that sounds <span>adorable!<br/></span> 
🎧 What are they doing in the <span>video?<br/></span> 
🎧 They're just <span>climbing</span> around in a <span>tree</span>, <span>munching</span> on <span>leaves.<br/></span> 
🎧 They're <span>actually</span> <span>vegetarians</span>, you <span>know!<br/></span> 
🎧 So, are red <span>pandas</span> your <span>favorite</span> <span>animal?<br/></span> 
🎧 I really like red <span>pandas</span>, but I also love <span>dogs.<br/></span> 
🎧 They're so <span>loyal</span> and <span>playful.<br/></span> 
🎧 What about <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you have a <span>favorite</span> <span>animal?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span> yes! I love <span>cats</span>. They're so <span>independent</span> and <span>cuddly</span> at the same <span>time.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Plus</span>, they're always <span>cleaning</span> <span>themselves</span>, which is <span>pretty</span> <span>cool.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Cats</span> are great, <span>too.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Alex</span>, what's up? You <span>seem</span> <span>relaxed!<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, I just <span>beat</span> the <span>final</span> <span>level</span> on that new <span>space</span> <span>shooter</span> <span>game.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Feels</span> <span>good.<br/></span> 
🎧 A <span>space</span> <span>shooter</span>, <span>huh?<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you enjoy playing <span>video</span> <span>games?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Totally</span>! I love the <span>challenge</span> and the feeling of <span>accomplishment</span> when you <span>finally</span> <span>win.<br/></span> 
🎧 What about <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 I used to play some when I was <span>younger</span>, but not so much <span>anymore.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe I should <span>pick</span> it back up <span>again.<br/></span> 
🎧 You should! There are so many great <span>games</span> out <span>now<br/></span> 
🎧 I love <span>exploring</span> new <span>places</span> and <span>meeting</span> <span>interesting</span> <span>people.<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe there's a game like <span>that?<br/></span> 
🎧 There might <span>be!<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe you can <span>recommend</span> one for me <span>sometime?<br/></span> 
🎧 Absolutely! We could even play together if you <span>want.<br/></span> 
🎧 Really? Thanks, <span>Alex!<br/></span> 
🎧 Wow, this <span>weather</span> is <span>perfect</span> for a <span>picnic!<br/></span> 
🎧 Absolutely! <span>Fresh</span> air, good <span>food..</span>. what more could you ask <span>for?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Speaking</span> of good food, I made this <span>fruit</span> <span>salad.<br/></span> 
🎧 Hope you like <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 Looks <span>delicious</span>! What kind of <span>fruit</span> did you put <span>in?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Strawberries</span>, <span>blueberries</span>, <span>kiwi..</span>. <span>oh</span>, and some <span>juicy</span> <span>mangoes!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Mangoes</span>? You know they're my <span>absolute</span> <span>favorite!<br/></span> 
🎧 Really? They're not the <span>easiest</span> to eat at a <span>picnic</span>, are <span>they?<br/></span> 
🎧 Who <span>cares</span>? They're <span>worth</span> the <span>mess!<br/></span> 
🎧 What about you, <span>Lisa</span>? What's your <span>favorite</span> <span>fruit?<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe <span>watermelon?<br/></span> 
🎧 It's so <span>refreshing</span> on a hot day like <span>this.<br/></span> 
🎧 Great <span>choice!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Especially</span> with a little <span>sprinkle</span> of <span>salt</span>, <span>right?<br/></span> 
🎧 Exactly! We can definitely share a <span>slice</span> <span>later.<br/></span> 
🎧 But first, let's <span>dig</span> into this <span>fruit</span> <span>salad.<br/></span> 
🎧 Can't <span>wait!<br/></span> 
🎧 Wow, <span>Liam</span>, is that a <span>guitar?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yep</span>! Thought it might be fun to play a few <span>tunes</span> after <span>lunch.<br/></span> 
🎧 That sounds <span>lovely</span>! Do you like to <span>sing?<br/></span> 
🎧 A little bit. <span>Mostly</span> just for myself, you <span>know?<br/></span> 
🎧 I bet you're <span>great!<br/></span> 
🎧 I used to <span>sing</span> in the school <span>choir</span>, but I wouldn't <span>dare</span> <span>sing</span> in <span>front</span> of people <span>anymore.<br/></span> 
🎧 Really? Why <span>not?<br/></span> 
🎧 My <span>voice</span> isn't <span>exactly..</span>. <span>award-winning.<br/></span> 
🎧 But <span>singing</span> along to music, that's always <span>fun!<br/></span> 
🎧 How about this, after we eat, I play a few <span>songs,<br/></span> 
🎧 and you can <span>sing</span> along if you <span>want.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Okay</span>. Maybe I'll even <span>surprise</span> myself with some <span>hidden</span> <span>talent.<br/></span> 
🎧 Sounds good to <span>me.<br/></span> 
🎧 Wow, <span>close</span> game! Who are they <span>playing?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span>, that's the <span>city</span> <span>finals</span> for <span>basketball.<br/></span> 
🎧 My <span>team</span>, the <span>Hawks</span>, are down by two <span>points!<br/></span> 
🎧 Really? <span>Basketball</span>? What is your <span>favorite</span> <span>sport</span> to <span>watch?<br/></span> 
🎧 Definitely <span>basketball.<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>fast</span> <span>pace</span>, the <span>teamwork</span>, the <span>buzzer-beater</span> <span>shots..</span>. it's all so <span>exciting.<br/></span> 
🎧 I can't say I <span>understand</span> the <span>excitement</span> of <span>basketball.<br/></span> 
🎧 Isn't it just <span>running</span> and <span>throwing</span> a <span>ball?<br/></span> 
🎧 There's a lot more to it than that, <span>Ava!<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>strategy</span>, the <span>skill..</span>. it's like <span>watching</span> a <span>chess</span> <span>match</span> <span>played</span> really <span>fast.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, maybe. Still, I <span>prefer</span> <span>watching</span> something more <span>graceful.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Ugh</span>, this <span>heat</span> is <span>unbearable</span>! I wish I was <span>somewhere</span> <span>cool</span> right <span>now.<br/></span> 
🎧 Me too! How about a <span>trip</span> to the <span>beach</span> this <span>weekend?<br/></span> 
🎧 Do you enjoy going to the <span>beach?<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>beach</span>? You know I love the <span>beach!<br/></span> 
🎧 Sun, <span>sand</span>, <span>waves..</span>. sounds <span>perfect.<br/></span> 
🎧 Exactly! We could <span>build</span> <span>sandcastles</span>, <span>swim</span> in the <span>ocean<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe even try some <span>surfing</span> <span>lessons.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Surfing</span> <span>lessons</span>? Are you <span>sure?<br/></span> 
🎧 I wouldn't want to <span>wipe</span> out in <span>front</span> of <span>everyone.<br/></span>
