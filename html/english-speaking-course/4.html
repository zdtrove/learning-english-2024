🎧 <span>Welcome</span> to the <span>market</span>! Can I <span>interest</span> you in <span>anything</span>?<br/>

🎧 Do you play here <span>often</span>?<br/> 
🎧 You're really <span>good</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Most <span>nights</span>. Music is my <span>passion</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Where are you <span>visiting</span> <span>from</span>?<br/> 
🎧 All over! I love <span>exploring</span> new <span>places</span> and <span>experiencing</span> the <span>culture</span>.<br/> 
🎧 This <span>market</span> is <span>amazing</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Then you <span>must</span> see the <span>silk</span> <span>scarves</span> over <span>there</span>.<br/> 
🎧 They're <span>perfect</span> for <span>dancing</span> under the <span>stars</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Dancing</span>?<br/>

<h2>What is your favorite holiday?</h2>

🎧 This place has a really nice <span>atmosphere</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Perfect</span> for a first <span>date</span>, wouldn't you <span>say</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Absolutely. It's even better than I <span>expected</span> from the <span>pictures</span> <span>online</span>.<br/> 
🎧 So, <span>Daniel</span>, tell me a bit about <span>yourself</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What do you like to do for fun outside of <span>work</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Well, I'm a bit of a <span>movie</span> <span>buff</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I try to catch at <span>least</span> a <span>couple</span> of new <span>releases</span> every <span>month</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What about <span>you</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Any <span>hidden</span> <span>talents</span> or <span>hobbies</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, not exactly <span>hidden</span>, but I love <span>baking</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Especially</span> <span>cakes</span> and <span>pastries</span>.<br/> 
🎧 There's something so <span>relaxing</span> about <span>creating</span> something <span>delicious</span> from <span>scratch</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Speaking</span> of next <span>dates</span>, what's your <span>favorite</span> <span>holiday</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Does that sound like a <span>weird</span> <span>question</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Not at <span>all</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Actually</span>, it's a great way to learn about <span>someone's</span> <span>traditions</span> and <span>interests</span>.<br/> 
🎧 For me, it's <span>hard</span> to choose between <span>Thanksgiving</span> and New <span>Year's</span> <span>Eve</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Thanksgiving</span> because of the big <span>family</span> <span>gathering</span> and <span>delicious</span> <span>food</span>,<br/> 
🎧 and New <span>Year's</span> because it's a <span>chance</span> for a <span>fresh</span> <span>start</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Interesting</span>! I love <span>Thanksgiving</span> <span>too</span>,<br/> 
🎧 but my <span>favorite</span> is probably the <span>summer</span> <span>solstice</span> <span>festival</span> in my <span>hometown</span>.<br/> 
🎧 We have a <span>huge</span> <span>bonfire</span>, live music, and everyone <span>wears</span> <span>flower</span> <span>crowns</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's a <span>real</span> <span>celebration</span> of life and <span>nature</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Wow, that sounds <span>amazing</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I'd love to <span>experience</span> something like that <span>someday</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe we could even plan a <span>trip</span> around <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Who <span>knows</span>, maybe we'll be <span>celebrating</span> <span>summer</span> <span>solstice</span> together next <span>year</span>.<br/> 

<h2>Do you like to exercise?</h2>

🎧 Hey there, <span>sorry</span> about the <span>barking</span>!<br/>

🎧 Don't <span>worry</span> at all. He looks <span>friendly</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Golden</span> <span>retrievers</span> are the <span>best</span>.<br/> 
🎧 What's his <span>name</span>?<br/>

🎧 <span>Training</span> for a <span>marathon</span> or just <span>enjoying</span> the <span>day</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Just a <span>casual</span> <span>jog</span> to <span>clear</span> my <span>head</span> after <span>work</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's <span>amazing</span> how a little <span>exercise</span> can <span>improve</span> your <span>mood</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Do you like to <span>exercise</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I try <span>to</span>!<br/> 
🎧 <span>Walking</span> <span>Charlie</span> is definitely a <span>workout</span> in <span>itself</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Sometimes I go for a <span>swim</span> too, <span>especially</span> on hot <span>days</span> like <span>this</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Swimming</span> sounds <span>refreshing</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I used to do <span>gymnastics</span> when I was <span>younger</span>,<br/> 
🎧 but these <span>days</span> it's <span>mostly</span> <span>running</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Wow, <span>gymnastics</span>! That takes some <span>serious</span> <span>dedication</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe you could <span>teach</span> <span>Charlie</span> a <span>trick</span> or <span>two</span>?<br/> 
🎧 He'd love <span>that</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Mind</span> if <span>Charlie</span> <span>joins</span> you on your next <span>lap</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Maybe you two can become <span>running</span> <span>buddies</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Running</span> <span>buddies</span>? I think <span>Charlie</span> would love that <span>company</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Perfect</span>!<br/>

<h2>What is your favorite subject in school?</h2>

🎧 <span>Dude</span>, where'd you get all that food? <span>Sharing</span> <span>fries</span>?<br/>

🎧 Maybe. I <span>write</span> sometimes in a <span>secret</span> <span>notebook</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Nothing</span> too <span>serious</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe you could share some <span>stories</span> <span>sometime</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Depends</span> on the <span>story</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Anything <span>involving</span> <span>explosions</span> or <span>zombies</span> and the <span>fries</span> are all <span>yours</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>Cool</span>! I was just about to play <span>frisbee</span> with <span>Ben</span>. Want to <span>join</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Hmm..</span>. <span>frisbee</span>, <span>huh</span>? Sounds fun, but I'm not very <span>sporty</span>.<br/> 
🎧 No <span>worries</span>! It's <span>easy</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You just <span>throw</span> the <span>frisbee</span> and catch <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You make it sound <span>interesting</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Okay, maybe I'll give it a <span>try</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Not <span>really</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'm more into <span>sports</span> and <span>video</span> <span>games</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But hey, maybe you can <span>teach</span> me some <span>drawing</span> <span>stuff</span> <span>sometime</span>?<br/>

🎧 Wow, that sounds <span>adorable</span>!<br/> 
🎧 What are they doing in the <span>video</span>?<br/>

🎧 A little bit. <span>Mostly</span> just for myself, you <span>know</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I bet you're <span>great</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I used to <span>sing</span> in the school <span>choir</span>, but I wouldn't <span>dare</span> <span>sing</span> in <span>front</span> of people <span>anymore</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Really? Why <span>not</span>?<br/> 
🎧 My <span>voice</span> isn't <span>exactly..</span>. <span>award-winning</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But <span>singing</span> along to music, that's always <span>fun</span>!<br/> 
🎧 How about this, after we eat, I play a few <span>songs</span>,<br/> 
🎧 and you can <span>sing</span> along if you <span>want</span>.<br/>

🎧 I can't say I <span>understand</span> the <span>excitement</span> of <span>basketball</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Isn't it just <span>running</span> and <span>throwing</span> a <span>ball</span>?<br/> 
🎧 There's a lot more to it than that, <span>Ava</span>!<br/> 
🎧 The <span>strategy</span>, the <span>skill..</span>. it's like <span>watching</span> a <span>chess</span> <span>match</span> <span>played</span> really <span>fast</span>.<br/>
