<h2>I'm AFRAID of Speaking English!</h2>

🎧 <span>Welcome</span> to our new home, <span>Chloe</span>.<br/>
🎧 What do you think?<br/>
🎧 It's nice!<br/>
🎧 But I am <span>worried</span>.<br/>
🎧 My English is not very good. I'm <span>afraid</span> I won't fit in at school.<br/>
🎧 Don't <span>worry</span>, <span>Chloe</span>.<br/>
🎧 It will take some time, but you'll get used to it.<br/>
🎧 You'll make friends and your English will <span>improve</span>.<br/>
🎧 Just be <span>patient</span>.<br/>
🎧 I will try, Dad.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 We're <span>proud</span> of you, <span>Chloe</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Remember</span>, we're always here to <span>support</span> you.<br/>
🎧 I <span>miss</span> my friends back home.<br/>
🎧 I wish I can make some new friends here.<br/>
🎧 You still have to go to school <span>tomorrow</span>, right?<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 You will meet many new friends.<br/>
🎧 Here people are very open.<br/>
🎧 I hope so.<br/>
🎧 I will try to make friends and fit in.<br/>
🎧 I hope I can <span>understand</span> them.<br/>
🎧 Hi, class.<br/>
🎧 Today we will start a <span>group</span> <span>project</span>.<br/>
🎧 Please <span>form</span> <span>groups</span> of <span>four</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, what should I do?<br/>
🎧 Hey, do you want to join our <span>group</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes. Thank you.<br/>
🎧 We need a good idea for a <span>project</span>.<br/>
🎧 Any <span>suggestions</span>?<br/>
🎧 Okay. We need to find an <span>animal</span> with <span>interesting</span> <span>characteristics</span>.<br/>
🎧 Only then will our <span>presentation</span> <span>stand</span> out.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 What do you think, <span>Chloe</span>?<br/>
🎧 Do you have any <span>ideas</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Um</span>, maybe we <span>can</span>... do a <span>project</span> <span>about</span>... <span>bats</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Bats</span> are <span>active</span> at <span>night</span>.<br/>
🎧 They also <span>typically</span> <span>sleep</span> <span>hanging</span> <span>upside</span> down.<br/>
🎧 That's a great idea, <span>Chloe</span>!<br/>
🎧 Let's do that.<br/>
🎧 So we can start by <span>studying</span> <span>bats</span> and their <span>habitat</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes. And, we can make a <span>poster</span> with <span>pictures</span> and <span>information</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you like <span>drawing</span>, <span>John</span>?<br/>
🎧 Maybe you can help with the <span>poster</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I like <span>drawing</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can do that.<br/>
🎧 Great. I think I'm <span>pretty</span> good at <span>finding</span> <span>information</span>.<br/>
🎧 So I'll be in <span>charge</span> of that <span>part</span>.<br/>
🎧 We still have <span>roles</span> to <span>present</span> and <span>prepare</span> a <span>slideshow</span> for <span>Kylie</span> and <span>Chloe</span> to choose.<br/>
🎧 How about you, <span>Chloe</span>?<br/>
🎧 What do you want to do?<br/>
🎧 Can you give me time to think?<br/>
🎧 I'll answer you this <span>afternoon</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 Okay. We can meet after school <span>tomorrow</span> to work on it.<br/>
🎧 Hi, <span>Chloe</span>! I'm <span>Kylie</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>family</span> just <span>moved</span> in next <span>door</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>brought</span> some <span>fruit</span> for your <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh. Thank you, <span>Kylie</span>.<br/>
🎧 I didn't <span>expect</span> that you would be my new <span>neighbor</span>.<br/>
🎧 Come in. Please.<br/>
🎧 I <span>noticed</span> you <span>seemed</span> a bit <span>nervous</span> at school today.<br/>
🎧 Is everything okay?<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 I'm just not good at English, so it's <span>hard</span> for me to talk to people.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I <span>understand</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Moving</span> to a new place and <span>learning</span> a new <span>language</span> can be tough.<br/>
🎧 I'd like to help you.<br/>
🎧 Can I give you some <span>tips</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, please. I would <span>appreciate</span> that.<br/>
🎧 Okay. First, try to speak English as much as you can.<br/>
🎧 Even if you make <span>mistakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's the best way to learn.<br/>
🎧 For example, when you go to a <span>store</span>, try to ask <span>questions</span> in English.<br/>
🎧 I saw that you wanted to say your idea this morning, but didn't <span>dare</span>, right?<br/>
🎧 That's right, thanks to you <span>mentioning</span> me I was able to share my idea.<br/>
🎧 When I <span>spoke</span> out, I <span>found</span> that <span>speaking</span> wasn't that <span>scary</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 I'll try every day.<br/>
🎧 <span>Second</span>, listen to English music or <span>watch</span> English <span>movies</span> with <span>subtitles</span>.<br/>
🎧 It helps you get used to the sounds and <span>rhythm</span> of the <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll <span>bring</span> some <span>movies</span> with English <span>subtitles</span> and we can <span>watch</span> them together.<br/>
🎧 I'll <span>explain</span> what you don't <span>understand</span>.<br/>
🎧 That sounds like fun.<br/>
🎧 <span>Third</span>, don't be <span>afraid</span> to ask people to speak <span>slowly<br/></span>
🎧 or <span>repeat</span> <span>themselves</span> if you don't <span>understand</span>.<br/>
🎧 Most people are happy to help.<br/>
🎧 For example, it's me who's always <span>willing</span> to help you.<br/>
🎧 Thank you, <span>Kylie</span>. These <span>tips</span> are very <span>helpful</span>.<br/>
🎧 You're <span>welcome</span>, <span>Chloe</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now let's start with some <span>practical</span> <span>exercises</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you go to a <span>store</span>, try to ask for something <span>specific</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, if you need <span>bread</span>, you can say,<br/>
🎧 <span>"Excuse</span> me, where is the <span>bread?"<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Excuse</span> me, where is the <span>bread</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Perfect</span>.<br/>
🎧 And if they answer too quickly, you can say, <span>"Can</span> you please <span>repeat</span> that <span>slowly?"<br/></span>
🎧 Can you please <span>repeat</span> that <span>slowly</span>?<br/>
🎧 Great. Now let's <span>practice</span> the <span>conversation</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll <span>pretend</span> to be a <span>cashier</span> and you can ask me for help.<br/>
🎧 Okay. Let's try.<br/>
🎧 Hi, how can I help you today?<br/>
🎧 Hi. Can you help me find the <span>bread</span>?<br/>
🎧 Sure. It's in <span>aisle</span> <span>five</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can you please <span>repeat</span> that <span>slowly</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Aisle</span> <span>five</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you!<br/>
🎧 <span>Perfect</span>! You're doing great, <span>Chloe</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can see that you <span>understand</span> what I say.<br/>
🎧 It's just that you <span>lack</span> <span>confidence</span>,<br/>
🎧 and that's not a <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 The more you <span>practice</span>, the <span>easier</span> it will become.<br/>
🎧 You make me feel so <span>motivated</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, about this morning.<br/>
🎧 Can I take over the <span>group's</span> <span>presentation</span> <span>duties</span>?<br/>
🎧 I want to try.<br/>
🎧 Of course. That <span>means</span> you need to <span>practice</span> more.<br/>
🎧 Please <span>practice</span> at home, and I'll come back <span>tomorrow</span> to help you.<br/>
🎧 Thank you so much.<br/>
🎧 Now, let's focus on your <span>presentation</span>.<br/>
🎧 How do you feel about it?<br/>
🎧 I'm still <span>scared</span>.<br/>
🎧 What if I <span>forget</span> what to say or I make a <span>mistake</span>?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>normal</span> to feel <span>nervous</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's work on <span>building</span> your <span>confidence<br/></span>
🎧 First, <span>remember</span> that everyone makes <span>mistakes</span>, and <span>that's</span> okay.<br/>
🎧 and that's okay.<br/>
🎧 The <span>important</span> thing is to keep going.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 What should I do to feel more <span>confident</span>?<br/>
🎧 The more you <span>practice</span>, the more <span>confident</span> you'll become.<br/>
🎧 Let's go through your <span>presentation</span> <span>step</span> by <span>step</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 You got this.<br/>
🎧 Start with your <span>introduction</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Remember</span> to speak <span>slowly</span> and <span>clearly</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good morning, everyone.<br/>
🎧 My name is <span>Chloe</span>, and today I want to talk about <span>bats</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great start!<br/>
🎧 Now let's <span>practice</span> <span>making</span> eye <span>contact</span>.<br/>
🎧 Look at different <span>points</span> in the room.<br/>
🎧 As if you're <span>looking</span> at your <span>classmates</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay.<br/>
🎧 <span>Bats</span> are <span>important</span> to our <span>world</span> for many <span>reasons</span>.<br/>
🎧 They help <span>reduce</span> <span>insect</span> <span>numbers</span> and <span>spread</span> <span>plant</span> <span>seeds</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's great, <span>Chloe</span>!<br/>
🎧 Now let's add some <span>gestures</span>.<br/>
🎧 Use your <span>hands</span> to <span>emphasize</span> key <span>points</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, a <span>single</span> <span>bat</span> can eat <span>thousands</span> of <span>insects</span> in one <span>night</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Helping</span> <span>farmers</span> by <span>reducing</span> the <span>number</span> of <span>pests</span> that <span>damage</span> <span>crops</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Excellent</span>.<br/>
🎧 You're doing so well.<br/>
🎧 <span>Remember</span> to <span>pause</span>, so your <span>points</span> are <span>clear</span>.<br/>
🎧 And to help you <span>stay</span> <span>calm</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, I'll try.<br/>
🎧 Let's <span>practice</span> a bit more.<br/>
🎧 <span>Imagine</span> the <span>audience</span> is really interested in what you're saying.<br/>
🎧 <span>Smile</span> and show them that you're <span>excited</span> about your <span>topic</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you, <span>Kylie</span>. Your help <span>means</span> a lot.<br/>
🎧 Here. Use this <span>mirror</span> to <span>practice</span>.<br/>
🎧 Look at <span>yourself</span> and <span>practice</span> <span>speaking</span> <span>confidently</span>.<br/>
🎧 It can help you see how you're doing.<br/>
🎧 That's a good idea. Thank you, <span>Kylie</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's try something different now.<br/>
🎧 I'll ask you some <span>questions</span>, and you answer them as if you're in <span>front</span> of the class.<br/>
🎧 Ready?<br/>
🎧 Oh, I never thought about that, but I'm ready.<br/>
🎧 Okay. I can do it, <span>Chloe</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Chloe</span>!<br/>
🎧 Oh, what?<br/>
🎧 We just wanted to say that you can do it.<br/>
🎧 That's right. You've <span>prepared</span> the <span>presentation</span> well.<br/>
🎧 Don't <span>worry</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Remember</span> what I said?<br/>
🎧 I got it, <span>guys</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let me <span>invite</span> <span>group</span> <span>5</span> for the <span>presentation</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good morning, everyone.<br/>
🎧 My name is <span>Chloe</span>.<br/>
🎧 I am the <span>representative</span> of <span>group</span> <span>5</span>.<br/>
🎧 And today I want to talk about <span>bats</span>.<br/>
🎧 She's doing great.<br/>
🎧 She's no <span>longer</span> as <span>self-conscious</span> as the first day.<br/>
🎧 <span>Bats</span> are <span>important</span> to our <span>world</span> for many <span>reasons</span>.<br/>
🎧 They help <span>reduce</span> <span>insect</span> <span>numbers</span> and <span>spread</span> <span>plant</span> <span>seeds</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, a <span>single</span> <span>bat</span> can eat <span>thousands</span> of <span>insects</span> in one <span>night</span>.<br/>
🎧 Which helps <span>farmers</span> by <span>reducing</span> the <span>number</span> of <span>pests</span> that <span>damage</span> <span>crops</span>.<br/>
🎧 And that's why <span>bats</span> are <span>necessary</span> to our <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 They play <span>important</span> <span>parts</span> in our <span>ecosystem</span> and in our lives.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 <span>Excellent</span> <span>job</span>, <span>Chloe</span>!<br/>
🎧 You <span>spoke</span> very well.<br/>
🎧 Keep up the good work.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I couldn't have done it without you, <span>Kylie</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you for everything.<br/>
🎧 You're <span>welcome</span>, <span>Chloe</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm glad I could help.<br/>
🎧 Friends <span>support</span> each other, right?<br/>
🎧 Right. And now, I feel more <span>confident</span> in <span>speaking</span> English.<br/>
🎧 I'm so happy for you, <span>Chloe</span>.<br/>
🎧 You did an <span>amazing</span> <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 I want to thank you by <span>inviting</span> you to dinner with my <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is that okay?<br/>
🎧 <span>Certainly</span>!<br/>
🎧 <span>Welcome</span>, <span>Kylie</span>! <span>We're</span> so glad you could join us for dinner.<br/>
🎧 Thank you for having me.<br/>
🎧 I'm happy to be here.<br/>
🎧 <span>Chloe</span> told us how much you <span>helped</span> her with her <span>presentation</span>.<br/>
🎧 We really <span>appreciate</span> it.<br/>
🎧 It was my <span>pleasure</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Chloe</span> did all the <span>hard</span> work.<br/>
🎧 She was <span>amazing</span>.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>tips</span> and <span>support</span> made all the <span>difference</span>.<br/>
🎧 How is your <span>presentation</span>, <span>Chloe</span>?<br/>
🎧 I <span>guess</span> it's good, right?<br/>
🎧 It went great, mom.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>nervous</span>, but I did it, and I got a good <span>grade</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>wonderful</span>, <span>Chloe</span>. We're so <span>proud</span> of you.<br/>
🎧 I couldn't have done it without <span>Kylie</span>. She <span>helped</span> me so much.<br/>
🎧 It sounds like you've made a good friend.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I have.<br/>
🎧 And now I feel more <span>confident</span> in <span>speaking</span> English.<br/>
🎧 You know, <span>Chloe</span>, <span>learning</span> a new <span>language</span> and <span>adapting</span> to a new <span>culture</span> is not easy.<br/>
🎧 But you've <span>shown</span> great <span>courage</span>.<br/>
🎧 We're very <span>proud</span> of you.<br/>
🎧 Thank you, Dad.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>excited</span> about the future now.<br/>
🎧 And <span>remember</span>, if you ever feel <span>unsure</span> or need help.<br/>
🎧 You have friends like <span>Kylie</span> and us to <span>support</span> you.<br/>
🎧 I know mom.<br/>
<br/><br/>
