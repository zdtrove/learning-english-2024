<h2>Am I Too Old to Learn Something New?</h2>

🎧 Mr. <span>Henry</span> <span>sits</span> <span>quietly</span> in his small house in <span>Toronto</span>.<br/> 
🎧 A <span>photo</span> of his son, <span>Michael</span>, is on the <span>table</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Michael's</span> <span>face</span> in the <span>photo</span> is <span>smiling</span>,<br/> 
🎧 very different from the <span>deep</span> <span>sadness</span> in Mr. <span>Henry's</span> <span>eyes</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Michael</span>, I really don't know what to do now.<br/> 
🎧 This <span>place</span>... everything <span>reminds</span> me of you.<br/> 
🎧 Mr. <span>Henry</span> <span>stands</span> up and looks out the <span>window</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Outside, it is <span>lightly</span> <span>raining</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe, it's time for me to find a more <span>peaceful</span> <span>place</span>.<br/> 
🎧 A place where this <span>pain</span> can't <span>follow</span> <span>me</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Mr. <span>Henry</span> <span>sighs</span> and looks at the house one last time before <span>making</span> his <span>decision</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Mr. <span>Henry</span> <span>chose</span> a small, <span>quiet</span> <span>town</span>, <span>hoping</span> to find <span>peace</span> in his <span>life</span>.<br/> 
🎧 This <span>town</span> looks <span>peaceful</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I hope I can start a new life here.<br/> 
🎧 <span>However</span>, he had <span>trouble</span> because he only <span>spoke</span> a little English.<br/> 
🎧 Mr. <span>Henry</span> <span>tried</span> to talk to people, but it was <span>hard</span>.<br/> 
🎧 His English was not very good and he <span>felt</span> <span>alone</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Excue</span> <span>mi</span>, <span>whee</span> i the <span>gloerly</span> <span>stor</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I'm <span>sorry</span>. Can you say that <span>again</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Grociry</span> <span>strere</span>... <span>food</span>?<br/> 
🎧 The <span>resident</span> <span>tried</span> to <span>help<br/></span> 
🎧 But it was <span>clear</span> that <span>communication</span> would be a big <span>challenge</span> for Mr. <span>Henry</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>However</span>, an <span>unexpected</span> help <span>knocks</span> on <span>Henry's</span> <span>door<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hello</span>! My name is <span>Emily</span>. I live next <span>door</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Hello</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I <span>brought</span> you some <span>cookies</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I made them <span>myself</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Thank you, but I don't like <span>sweet</span>...<br/> 
🎧 Oh okay! Maybe you can try <span>them</span>....<br/> 
🎧 Maybe.<br/> 
🎧 Hi, Mr. <span>Henry</span>! You're <span>early</span>!<br/> 
🎧 <span>Yes</span>...<br/> 
🎧 I see you often in the <span>garden</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Seems</span> like you love <span>trees</span> and <span>gardening</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Yes, I do.<br/> 
🎧 The <span>weather</span> today is so <span>weird</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's <span>making</span> me feel <span>grumpy</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Yes, it <span>is</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Ouais</span>. Today, it may <span>rain</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Wow, is that <span>French</span>? You <span>speak</span> <span>French</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yes I do.<br/> 
🎧 I'm from <span>Canada</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That's <span>amazing</span>! I had no <span>idea</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Maybe you can help me with my <span>French</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>I</span>... I don't know. I <span>busy</span>...<br/> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span>... okay. Tell me <span>whenever</span> you have free <span>time<br/></span> 
🎧 Here, <span>money</span>...<br/> 
🎧 Thank you, sir. Have a nice day.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Excuse</span> me, sir. Did you pay for those <span>fruits</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, I <span>pay</span>.<br/> 
🎧 So may I see your <span>receipt</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I <span>pay</span>... at <span>cashir</span>. <span>Mony</span>... already <span>give</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'm <span>sorry</span>, but if you don't pay, you can't take the <span>fruits</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>I</span>... already <span>pay</span>... <span>here<br/></span> 
🎧 What's going <span>on</span>?<br/> 
🎧 This man is trying to take <span>fruits</span> without <span>paying</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Mr. <span>Henry</span>, Can you <span>show</span> them the <span>receipt</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yes. <span>Here</span>... <span>receipt</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, yes, I'm <span>sorry</span> for the <span>misunderstanding</span>, <span>sir</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's okay, Mr. <span>Henry</span>. It's just a <span>misunderstanding</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Thank you, <span>Emily</span>.<br/> 
🎧 No <span>problem</span>. Are you <span>buying</span> things to make <span>dinner</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yes. And you can <span>join</span>... <span>Si</span> <span>vous</span> <span>voulez</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Of course! Happy to <span>join</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Great. Come by around <span>6</span> <span>PM</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'll be there. Thank you for <span>inviting</span> <span>me</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I hope you like the <span>food</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's a <span>recipe</span> from <span>Canada</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's <span>delicious</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Thank you for <span>making</span> <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Emily</span>, I was <span>thinking</span>... since you're <span>learning</span> <span>French</span>,<br/> 
🎧 maybe I can help you with <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Really? That would be <span>amazing</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Thank you, Mr. <span>Henry</span>!<br/> 
🎧 And in <span>return</span>, can you help me with my English?<br/> 
🎧 Of course! <span>I'd</span> be happy to <span>help</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But, I'm <span>worried</span>. I'm too old to learn new things.<br/> 
🎧 No, Mr. <span>Henry</span>, <span>you're</span> never too old to <span>learn</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's <span>hard</span> for me. My <span>brain</span> isn't as <span>quick</span> as it used to <span>be</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That's okay.<br/> 
🎧 We can go <span>slowly</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's about <span>practice</span> and <span>patience</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You really think I can do <span>it</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Absolutely</span>!<br/> 
🎧 You've already <span>helped</span> me so much.<br/> 
🎧 It's my <span>turn</span> to help you.<br/> 
🎧 Alright, <span>Emily</span>. Let's do this together.<br/> 
🎧 Great! We'll start <span>tomorrow</span>. <span>It'll</span> be fun, I <span>promise<br/></span> 
🎧 Hi, <span>Henry</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Hi <span>Henry</span>! I <span>brought</span> you a book. It's <span>called</span> <span>"Learn</span> English for <span>Beginners."<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, thank you, <span>Emily</span>! That's very kind of you.<br/> 
🎧 I have some <span>tips</span> that can help <span>older</span> <span>adults</span> learn English.<br/> 
🎧 Would you like to hear <span>them</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, please! I need all the <span>help</span>!<br/> 
🎧 First, don't <span>worry</span> about <span>making</span> <span>mistakes</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's <span>normal</span> and <span>part</span> of <span>learning</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That's good to know.<br/> 
🎧 I always feel a bit shy about <span>speaking</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Practice</span> <span>speaking</span> as much as you can.<br/> 
🎧 You can talk to me or even <span>yourself</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'll try that. Any other <span>tips</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yes! Try to read every day.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Books</span>, <span>newspapers</span> or even <span>labels</span> can help you learn new <span>words</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I like <span>reading</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That should be <span>fun</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Also, listen to English <span>radio</span> or <span>watch</span> <span>TV</span> <span>shows</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It helps you get used to the sound of the <span>language</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I enjoy <span>watching</span> <span>TV</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'll start <span>watching</span> English <span>shows</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Great. <span>Flashcards</span> can be <span>helpful</span> too.<br/> 
🎧 You can <span>write</span> new <span>words</span> on them and <span>review</span> them <span>often</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Flashcards</span>? That sounds <span>interesting</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'll give it a <span>try</span>.<br/> 
🎧 And don't <span>forget</span> to take <span>breaks</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Learning</span> a new <span>language</span> can be <span>tiring</span>, so it's <span>important</span> to <span>rest</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That's good <span>advice</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I don't want to get too <span>tired</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, and one more thing! You can listen to <span>podcasts</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>There's</span> a great one <span>called</span> <span>LEP</span> <span>-</span> Learn English <span>Podcast</span>. It's really <span>helpful</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Podcasts</span>? That sounds <span>good</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I'll definitely check out <span>LEP</span> <span>-</span> Learn English <span>Podcast</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Also, try to set small, <span>achievable</span> <span>goals</span>.<br/> 
🎧 For example, learn <span>five</span> new <span>words</span> a day.<br/> 
🎧 Sound <span>manageable</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Use <span>apps</span> for <span>language</span> <span>learning</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Some are <span>designed</span> for <span>beginners</span> and can be very <span>interactive</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I have a <span>smartphone</span> so I can try <span>using</span> <span>apps</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Any <span>recommendations</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Duolingo</span> and <span>Memrise</span> are great for <span>beginners</span>. They make <span>learning</span> <span>fun</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Right</span>!<br/> 
🎧 You're <span>welcome</span>!<br/> 
🎧 And don't <span>forget</span> to <span>review</span> what you've <span>learned</span> <span>regularly</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It helps to <span>remember</span> <span>better</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Well, <span>lots</span> of things to do...<br/> 
🎧 You know, sometimes I feel like my age is a <span>barrier</span> to <span>learning</span> new things.<br/> 
🎧 Oh, <span>Henry</span>, age is never a <span>limit</span> for <span>learning</span>!<br/> 
🎧 With the right <span>method</span>, <span>anyone</span> can learn at any <span>age</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Really</span>?<br/> 
🎧 But I feel like <span>younger</span> people learn <span>faster</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's <span>true</span> that young people might <span>pick</span> up new things <span>quickly</span>,<br/> 
🎧 but <span>older</span> <span>learners</span> have <span>advantages</span> too.<br/> 
🎧 You have life <span>experience</span> and <span>patience</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That's a good <span>point</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Also, <span>older</span> <span>learners</span> often have better <span>study</span> <span>habits</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You can set a <span>regular</span> <span>schedule</span> and <span>stick</span> to <span>it</span>.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Consistency</span> is <span>key</span>.<br/> 
🎧 I can definitely do that.<br/> 
🎧 What else can <span>help</span>?<br/> 
🎧 You can even find online <span>communities</span> to <span>practice</span> with <span>others</span>.<br/> 
🎧 That's a great <span>idea</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's nice to know I'm not <span>alone</span> in <span>this</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You're definitely not <span>alone</span>.<br/> 
🎧 Many people of all <span>ages</span> are <span>learning</span> new things every day.<br/> 
🎧 It's all about <span>finding</span> what <span>works</span> best for you.<br/> 
🎧 I feel more <span>confident</span> now.<br/> 
🎧 Maybe I can learn even more things <span>besides</span> English.<br/> 
🎧 Of course, <span>learning</span> <span>keeps</span> our <span>minds</span> <span>active</span> and <span>healthy</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's never too <span>late</span> to start something <span>new</span>.<br/> 
🎧 You're right.<br/> 
🎧 I <span>guess</span> I've been <span>holding</span> myself back with <span>negative</span> <span>thoughts</span> and <span>doubts</span>.<br/> 
🎧 It's <span>normal</span> to have <span>doubts</span>.<br/> 
🎧 But don't let them <span>stop</span> you.<br/> 
🎧 <span>Believe</span> in <span>yourself</span> and keep <span>going.<br/>
