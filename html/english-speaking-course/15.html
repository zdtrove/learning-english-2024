<h2 id="esc-15-4">Job interview</h2>

🎧 I'm so <span>worried</span> about my next <span>job</span> <span>interview</span>.<br/>
🎧 What if I don't do well?<br/>
🎧 Don't <span>worry</span>, <span>Lena</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have some <span>tips</span> that can help you feel more <span>confident</span>.<br/>
🎧 Really?<br/>
🎧 What kind of <span>tips</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, first of all, make sure you <span>research</span> the <span>company</span> and the <span>role</span> you're <span>applying</span> for.<br/>
🎧 That way, you'll be <span>prepared</span> to answer <span>questions</span> about why you're interested.<br/>
🎧 Okay, that makes <span>sense</span>.<br/>
🎧 What else?<br/>
🎧 <span>Practice</span> <span>answering</span> <span>common</span> <span>interview</span> <span>questions<br/></span>
🎧 like <span>"Tell</span> me about <span>yourself"</span> or <span>"What</span> are your <span>strengths</span> and <span>weaknesses?"<br/></span>
🎧 That will help you sound more <span>natural</span> and <span>confident</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good idea!<br/>
🎧 I <span>tend</span> to get <span>nervous</span> and <span>stumble</span> on those <span>types</span> of <span>questions</span>.<br/>
🎧 And don't <span>forget</span> to <span>dress</span> <span>professionally</span>.<br/>
🎧 First <span>impressions</span> are <span>important</span> in <span>interviews</span>.<br/>
🎧 You're right.<br/>
🎧 I'll make sure to put together a nice <span>outfit</span>.<br/>
🎧 The last tip is to be <span>yourself</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>interviewer</span> <span>wants</span> to get to know the <span>real</span> you,<br/>
🎧 not <span>someone</span> you're trying to be.<br/>
🎧 That's really <span>helpful</span>, <span>sis</span>.<br/>
🎧 I feel a lot better about this now.<br/>
🎧 I'm glad I could help.<br/>
🎧 And don't <span>forget</span>,<br/>
🎧 you can also <span>suggest</span> <span>using</span> <span>AI</span> <span>assistants<br/></span>
🎧 to help them <span>practice</span> and <span>prepare<br/></span>
🎧 <span>AI</span> <span>assistants</span>?<br/>
🎧 How can they help?<br/>
🎧 Well, they can <span>provide</span> <span>sample</span> <span>questions</span>.<br/>
🎧 Give <span>feedback</span> on your <span>answers<br/></span>
🎧 and even <span>practice</span> <span>mock</span> <span>interviews</span> with you.<br/>
🎧 That way, you can feel more <span>confident</span> and ready for the <span>real</span> thing.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 Maybe I could try that and then share my own <span>tips</span> with <span>others</span>.<br/>
🎧 It might help them feel less <span>nervous</span> about <span>interviews</span>.<br/>
🎧 Exactly.<br/>
🎧 And don't <span>forget</span> you've got this.<br/>
🎧 Just be <span>yourself</span> and you'll do great.<br/>
🎧 You're right.<br/>
🎧 Thanks for the <span>encouragement</span>, <span>sis</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm going to give it a <span>try<br/></span>
🎧 and see what I can do to help <span>others</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, no. I <span>overslept</span>!<br/>
🎧 This is <span>terrible</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm going to be <span>late</span> for my <span>interview</span>.<br/>
🎧 I need a <span>shower</span>, get <span>dressed<br/></span>
🎧 and eat something all before I have to leave.<br/>
🎧 I'm so <span>worried</span> I won't make it on time.<br/>
🎧 <span>Lena</span>? What's wrong?<br/>
🎧 Why are you in such a <span>hurry</span>?<br/>
🎧 I <span>slipped</span> in and now I'm going to be <span>late</span> for my <span>job</span> <span>interview</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm so <span>nervous</span>.<br/>
🎧 I couldn't <span>sleep</span> well last <span>night</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay. Don't <span>worry</span>.<br/>
🎧 Take a <span>deep</span> <span>breath</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll help you get ready quickly,<br/>
🎧 and we'll make sure you get there on time.<br/>
🎧 Thank you, Mom. I really need the help.<br/>
🎧 Don't <span>worry</span>.<br/>
🎧 You've got this.<br/>
🎧 Yes. I'll try to <span>stay</span> <span>calm</span> and be myself.<br/>
🎧 <span>Interviews</span> are just so <span>stressful</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know, but you've <span>prepared</span> well.<br/>
🎧 And if you get <span>nervous</span>, just take a few <span>deep</span> <span>breaths</span>.<br/>
🎧 You're going to do great.<br/>
🎧 I hope so.<br/>
🎧 Okay, let's get going.<br/>
🎧 I don't want to be <span>late</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's go. I'll drive you there.<br/>
🎧 Hello. My name is <span>Lena</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have a <span>job</span> <span>interview</span> <span>scheduled</span> for this morning.<br/>
🎧 Ah yes, hello <span>Lena</span>.<br/>
🎧 Please have a <span>seat</span>, the <span>interviewer</span> will be with you <span>shortly</span>.<br/>
🎧 Okay, thank you.<br/>
🎧 Okay, <span>Lena</span>, you can do this. <span>Remember</span> the <span>tips</span> my <span>sister</span> gave you.<br/>
🎧 This guy <span>seems</span> nice. I hope I can work here.<br/>
🎧 <span>Lena</span>, the <span>interviewer</span> is ready for you now.<br/>
🎧 You can go through that <span>door</span> down the <span>hall</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Here we go.<br/>
🎧 Hello, <span>Lena</span>.<br/>
🎧 Please have a <span>seat</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm so glad you could make it today.<br/>
🎧 Hello.<br/>
🎧 Thank you for having me.<br/>
🎧 No need to be <span>nervous</span>, <span>Lena</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is just a <span>friendly</span> <span>conversation</span> to get to know you better.<br/>
🎧 Why don't you start by <span>telling</span> me a bit about <span>yourself</span>?<br/>
🎧 Okay, <span>um</span>... Well,<br/>
🎧 my name is <span>Lena</span> and I'm <span>23</span> years old.<br/>
🎧 I <span>recently</span> <span>graduated</span> with a <span>degree</span> in <span>marketing</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm really <span>passionate</span> about <span>understanding</span> <span>consumer</span> <span>behavior<br/></span>
🎧 and <span>finding</span> <span>creative</span> <span>ways</span> to <span>reach</span> <span>target</span> <span>audiences</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's great, <span>Lena</span>.<br/>
🎧 And what would you say are your <span>greatest</span> <span>strengths</span>?<br/>
🎧 Well, I'd say I'm a very <span>hard</span> <span>worker</span>,<br/>
🎧 and I'm always <span>eager</span> to learn new things.<br/>
🎧 I'm also quite <span>organized</span> and <span>detail</span> <span>oriented</span>,<br/>
🎧 which I think is <span>important</span> in <span>marketing</span>.<br/>
🎧 Those sound like <span>excellent</span> <span>strengths</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, what about your <span>weaknesses</span>?<br/>
🎧 What do you think you can <span>improve</span> on?<br/>
🎧 Well, sometimes I can be a bit shy,<br/>
🎧 <span>especially</span> in new <span>situations</span> like this.<br/>
🎧 But I'm working on being more <span>outgoing</span> and <span>confident</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>especially</span> when it comes to <span>presenting</span> my <span>ideas</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's very <span>insightful</span>, <span>Lena</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm glad you're <span>aware</span> of that and are working on <span>improving</span> it.<br/>
🎧 So <span>Lena</span>, tell me, where do you see <span>yourself</span> in <span>5</span> years?<br/>
🎧 Well, in <span>5</span> years I'd love to be working as a <span>marketing</span> <span>manager</span> for a <span>company</span> like this one.<br/>
🎧 I'm really <span>passionate<br/></span>
🎧 about <span>helping</span> <span>brands</span> <span>connect</span> with their <span>customers</span> in <span>creative</span> <span>ways</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's a great <span>goal</span>.<br/>
🎧 And what <span>specific</span> <span>steps</span> you think you need to take to get there?<br/>
🎧 Well, I want to <span>continue</span> <span>building</span> my <span>skills</span> and <span>experience</span> in <span>digital</span> <span>marketing</span>,<br/>
🎧 <span>social</span> <span>media</span> <span>strategy</span> and <span>data</span> <span>analysis</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, and of course, I need to <span>remember</span> to put on <span>pants</span> every day.<br/>
🎧 I'm sorry, did you <span>say...put</span> on <span>pants</span>?<br/>
🎧 Oh my <span>gosh</span>, I'm so sorry!<br/>
🎧 I don't know why I said that.<br/>
🎧 Of course, I would <span>wear</span> <span>pants</span> to work every day.<br/>
🎧 Sorry. I <span>guess</span> my <span>nerves</span> are still getting the better of me a bit.<br/>
🎧 No need to <span>apologize</span>, <span>Lena</span>.<br/>
🎧 That was quite a funny <span>slip-up</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>refreshing</span> to see a <span>candidate</span> who can <span>laugh</span> at <span>themselves</span> a bit.<br/>
🎧 Well, I'm <span>certainly</span> trying my best to <span>stay</span> <span>calm</span> and <span>collected</span> here.<br/>
🎧 But sometimes my <span>mouth</span> <span>runs</span> <span>ahead</span> of my <span>brain</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>appreciate</span> your <span>honesty</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>shows</span> a lot of <span>self-awareness</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, let's get back to <span>discussing</span> your <span>career</span> <span>goals</span>...<br/>
🎧 <span>Lena</span>! How did it go?<br/>
🎧 Tell me everything.<br/>
🎧 It went so well, <span>sis</span>!<br/>
🎧 Thank you so much for all your help.<br/>
🎧 I couldn't have done it without you.<br/>
🎧 I'm so glad to hear that.<br/>
🎧 What <span>happened</span>?<br/>
🎧 Did they <span>offer</span> you the <span>job</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, not yet. But the <span>interview</span> <span>itself</span> went really <span>smoothly</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was a bit <span>nervous</span> at first, but then I <span>started</span> feeling more <span>confident</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's great.<br/>
🎧 I <span>knew</span> you could do it.<br/>
🎧 Yes I did. It was so <span>helpful</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>AI</span> gave me such great advice on how to answer <span>common</span> <span>interview</span> <span>questions</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm so glad to hear that.<br/>
🎧 I <span>knew</span> that I could be a really <span>useful</span> <span>tool</span> to help you feel <span>prepared</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't know what I would have done without your <span>suggestion</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you, thank you, thank you.<br/>
🎧 Of course, <span>Lena</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm just happy I could help.<br/>
🎧 Now let's <span>celebrate</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll make us a nice dinner to <span>commemorate</span> your <span>successful</span> <span>interview</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sounds <span>perfect</span>.<br/>
<span><br/></span><br/>

<h2 id="esc-15-506">Where do you see <span>yourself</span> in the next <span>10</span> years?</h2>

🎧 Time <span>flies</span> so <span>fast</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>seems</span> like only <span>yesterday<br/></span>
🎧 when we first went to this <span>school<br/></span>
🎧 and now we have <span>graduated</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 Time <span>flies</span> like an <span>arrow</span>.<br/>
🎧 We have been together since <span>elementary</span> school.<br/>
🎧 I <span>remember</span> we do everything together.<br/>
🎧 The first day of <span>middle</span> school, the first day of high <span>school,</span>...<br/>
🎧 Yes.<br/>
🎧 We have been through so much.<br/>
🎧 And I think that is why we are so <span>tight</span> and such <span>close</span> friends.<br/>
🎧 Of course. We are like the <span>family<br/></span>
🎧 Sure it is. I always <span>cherish</span> the time we <span>spent</span> <span>together<br/></span>
🎧 Next.<br/>
🎧 <span>Teresa</span> <span>Garcia</span>, <span>Thomas</span> <span>Clark</span> and <span>Kaden</span> Smith.<br/>
🎧 Please come to the <span>stage</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Teresa</span>, <span>Congratulation</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 <span>Thomas</span>, <span>Congratulation</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank <span>you<br/></span>
🎧 <span>Kayden</span>, <span>Congratulation</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 It's been a long time since we <span>sat</span> down to talk.<br/>
🎧 Yes, we are so <span>busy</span> with <span>activities</span> and <span>preparing</span> for <span>graduation<br/></span>
🎧 Soon each of us will go to a different <span>university</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes. We all choose different <span>majors<br/></span>
🎧 In the <span>future<br/></span>
🎧 I think we can <span>hardly</span> meet each other as much as before.<br/>
🎧 I <span>guess</span> so.<br/>
🎧 Do you have any <span>plans</span>, <span>Teresa</span>?<br/>
🎧 I really like <span>foreign</span> <span>languages</span>.<br/>
🎧 I plan to <span>study</span> and <span>research</span> more about them.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I think you have a <span>gift</span> for <span>foreign</span> <span>languages<br/></span>
🎧 You learn everything very <span>fast</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you really think so?<br/>
🎧 Yes. What <span>language</span> will you choose?<br/>
🎧 I will learn <span>Spanish</span> and <span>Vietnamese</span>.<br/>
🎧 I love these two <span>languages</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>That's</span> great! I am so <span>proud</span> of you.<br/>
🎧 Have you thought about what you will do in the future?<br/>
🎧 Yes. I want to become an <span>interpreter</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why?<br/>
🎧 First, Because I love <span>languages</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Second</span>, when I become an <span>interpreter</span>,<br/>
🎧 I can travel to many <span>parts</span> of the <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sounds great.<br/>
🎧 Can you <span>imagine</span> <span>10</span> years from now, who will you become?<br/>
🎧 I think ten years from now,<br/>
🎧 I will have <span>achieved</span> my <span>goal</span> and become a good <span>interpreter</span>.<br/>
🎧 At that time, I hope I will meet the man of my <span>dreams<br/></span>
🎧 We will get <span>married</span> and have <span>children</span>.<br/>
🎧 Keep it up.<br/>
🎧 May your <span>wishes</span> all come <span>true</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you. How about you?<br/>
🎧 What <span>major</span> are you <span>applying</span> for?<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>passionate</span> about <span>cars</span> and <span>engineering</span>, so...<br/>
🎧 I <span>decided</span> to <span>sign</span> up for an <span>engineering</span> <span>major</span>.<br/>
🎧 What is the <span>university</span> you're <span>applying</span> to?<br/>
🎧 I was <span>accepted</span> into the <span>Pennsylvania</span> <span>College</span> of <span>Technology<br/></span>
🎧 Wow. <span>Congratulation</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank <span>you<br/></span>
🎧 What do you want to be in the future?<br/>
🎧 I want to be an <span>engineer</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh. Do you think you will be <span>married</span> at that time?<br/>
🎧 Maybe... I hope so. I want to have a <span>family</span> of my own.<br/>
🎧 I'm sure you can have it.<br/>
🎧 How about you, <span>Thomas</span>? Do you have any <span>plans</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I have something to tell you <span>guys</span>.<br/>
🎧 What is it?<br/>
🎧 I <span>decided</span> to go <span>abroad</span> to <span>study</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Omg</span>. No way!<br/>
🎧 You gotta be <span>kidding</span> me!<br/>
🎧 Which <span>country</span> are you going to <span>study</span> in?<br/>
🎧 I <span>intend</span> to <span>study</span> in <span>Germany</span>.<br/>
🎧 What's your <span>major</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Restaurant</span> <span>management</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm so <span>surprised</span>.<br/>
🎧 Me too.<br/>
🎧 Why did you decide that?<br/>
🎧 I've always wanted to have my own <span>restaurant<br/></span>
🎧 So I want to learn about <span>management<br/></span>
🎧 It will help me to know how to run the <span>restaurant</span> better in the future.<br/>
🎧 You have a very <span>clear</span> <span>vision</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I hope I can <span>achieve</span> my <span>goals</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Believe</span> in <span>yourself</span>, you can do it.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 Do you think you will get <span>married</span> in the next <span>10</span> years?<br/>
🎧 Right now, I have no <span>plans</span> for that.<br/>
🎧 I think <span>10</span> years later, I will be <span>28</span> years old, still quite <span>young<br/></span>
🎧 I want to focus on my <span>career</span> first.<br/>
🎧 Well, to be <span>honest</span>, I'm very <span>surprised</span> by your <span>decision<br/></span>
🎧 But I hope that your <span>goals</span> will come <span>true</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I look forward to the day when we can enjoy food from <span>Thomas's</span> <span>restaurant<br/></span>
🎧 Thank you, <span>guys</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I have my own <span>restaurant</span>,<br/>
🎧 I will definitely <span>invite</span> you two to come.<br/>
🎧 Okay, <span>deal</span>!<br/>
🎧 I hope we can be what we want to be in ten years.<br/>
🎧 But to be <span>fair</span>, life always <span>changes<br/></span>
🎧 We don't know what will <span>happen</span>.<br/>
🎧 So I think we always have to be ready to <span>face</span> <span>difficulties</span> in life and <span>unexpected</span> <span>changes<br/></span>
🎧 That's right, <span>whether</span> we <span>achieve</span> the <span>goal</span> we set for today or <span>not<br/></span>
🎧 I hope that the <span>three</span> of us will always be friends.<br/>
🎧 I hope we can still share everything with each other.<br/>
🎧 No <span>doubt</span> about it.<br/>
🎧 We will be good friends <span>forever</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, we are like <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 No <span>matter</span> what <span>happens</span>, you <span>guys</span> will always be in my <span>heart</span>.<br/>
🎧 After you go to <span>Germany</span>, <span>remember</span> to <span>contact</span> us <span>often<br/></span>
🎧 Sure, I will <span>text</span> you <span>guys</span> often, don't <span>worry<br/></span>
🎧 Okay, <span>remember</span> always keep in <span>touch<br/></span>
🎧 That's right!<br/>
🎧 When does your <span>semester</span> start?<br/>
🎧 My <span>semester</span> <span>starts</span> in <span>September</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I <span>forgot</span>, what <span>university</span> are you going to?<br/>
🎧 It is The <span>University</span> of <span>Kassel<br/></span>
🎧 Do you have to learn <span>German</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I have already <span>learned</span> <span>German<br/></span>
🎧 And I can <span>communicate</span> <span>basically</span>.<br/>
🎧 But when I <span>joined</span>, I still <span>needed</span> to <span>spend</span> the <span>semester</span> <span>learning</span> <span>German</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, <span>That's</span> great!<br/>
🎧 Keep it up.<br/>
🎧 Thank you.<br/>
🎧 How about you, <span>Kayden</span>?<br/>
🎧 What is your <span>college</span>?<br/>
🎧 I was <span>accepted</span> into the <span>Pennsylvania</span> <span>College</span> of <span>Technology<br/></span>
🎧 When will it start?<br/>
🎧 My <span>college</span> <span>starts</span> at the end of <span>August</span>.<br/>
🎧 Don't just talk about us.<br/>
🎧 How about you <span>Teressa</span>?<br/>
🎧 What is your <span>university</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Binghamton</span> <span>University</span>.<br/>
🎧 Wow, <span>congratulations</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>university</span> is <span>among</span> the top in New <span>York</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think so.<br/>
🎧 So each of us will be in a different place.<br/>
🎧 Right.<br/>
🎧 I think we will be <span>busy</span> with all our <span>courses</span> in the future.<br/>
🎧 <span>Plus</span> <span>Thomas</span> in <span>Germany</span>...<br/>
🎧 We won't be able to see each other often.<br/>
🎧 How about this?<br/>
🎧 On this <span>occasion</span> when we are still <span>together<br/></span>
🎧 Let's travel together.<br/>
🎧 What do you think?<br/>
🎧 Sounds good. I agree.<br/>
🎧 I agree. Me too.<br/>
🎧 Me too. Where do we go?<br/>
🎧 Let's travel <span>abroad</span>.<br/>
🎧 About which <span>country</span>, we will <span>discuss</span> this in <span>detail</span> <span>later<br/></span>
🎧 Ok. When will we go?<br/>
🎧 I think <span>July</span> is <span>reasonable</span>.<br/>
🎧 At that time, all <span>admission</span> <span>procedures</span> were <span>completed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, that <span>settles</span> it.<br/>
🎧 But now we need to eat some food. I'm <span>starving</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's right.<br/>
🎧 How about going to our <span>familiar</span> <span>restaurant</span>?<br/>
🎧 Of course.<br/>
🎧 Let's go.<br/>
<br/><br/>
