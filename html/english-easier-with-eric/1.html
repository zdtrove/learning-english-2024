🎧 Have you been <span>following</span> the <span>weather</span> <span>forecast</span> <span>lately<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, I have, it <span>seems</span> like the <span>rain</span> is finally going to <span>ease</span> off this <span>weekend<br/></span> 
🎧 That's a <span>relief</span>! It's been <span>raining</span> <span>non-stop</span> for <span>days<br/></span> 
🎧 I know, right? I was <span>starting</span> to <span>worry</span> about <span>flooding</span> in some <span>areas<br/></span> 
🎧 Me too, but with the <span>rain</span> <span>easing</span> off, we can finally make <span>plans</span> to go <span>hiking</span>!<br/>
🎧 That sounds perfect! I've been looking forward to getting <span>outside<br/></span> 
🎧 Same here, do you have any <span>particular</span> <span>trails</span> in <span>mind<br/></span> 
🎧 I was thinking of trying that new <span>trail</span> near the <span>lake</span>, it's <span>supposed</span> to be really <span>scenic<br/></span> 
🎧 That's a great idea! Let's plan for <span>Sunday</span> <span>then<br/></span> 
🎧 Sounds good, <span>hopefully</span> the <span>weather</span> will be <span>clear</span> by <span>then<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Fingers</span> <span>crossed</span>! It'll be nice to get some <span>fresh</span> air and <span>sunshine<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2 id="eewe-1-97">Fall for - be deceived by<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">🔊</b></h2>
🎧 So I heard you <span>bought</span> a car from that online <span>ad</span>, how did it <span>go<br/></span> 
🎧 Not great, actually, I think I <span>fell</span> for one of those <span>too-good-to-be-true</span> <span>deals<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh no, what <span>happened<br/></span> 
🎧 The car <span>looked</span> perfect in the <span>pictures</span>, and the <span>price</span> was <span>incredibly</span> low. I <span>contacted</span> the <span>seller</span>, and everything <span>seemed</span> fine until I <span>paid</span> a <span>deposit</span>. After that, <span>communication</span> just <span>stopped<br/></span> 
🎧 That sounds like a <span>classic</span> <span>scam</span>. Did you <span>manage</span> to get your money <span>back<br/></span> 
🎧 I've been trying, but it's <span>difficult</span>. The <span>seller</span> used a <span>fake</span> <span>identity</span>, and now I'm going through the <span>process</span> with my <span>bank</span> to see if they can <span>reverse</span> the <span>transaction<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm sorry to hear that. It's easy to <span>fall</span> for something when it looks exactly like what you <span>want<br/></span> 
🎧 Definitely a <span>lesson</span> <span>learned</span>. Next time I'll be more <span>cautious</span> and probably <span>insist</span> on <span>seeing</span> the car in person before <span>making</span> any <span>payments<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, that's a <span>safer</span> <span>approach</span>. It's tough out there with all these <span>deceptive</span> <span>ads</span>. Let me know if you need help <span>sorting</span> it out with your <span>bank<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2 id="eewe-1-200">Dial back - reduce or decrease<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">🔊</b></h2>
🎧 I've been thinking about how <span>hectic</span> our <span>weekends</span> have been lately. Maybe we should <span>dial</span> back on some of our <span>plans<br/></span> 
🎧 I was thinking the same. It <span>feels</span> like we're always <span>rushing</span> from one <span>event</span> to another without a <span>moment</span> to <span>relax<br/></span> 
🎧 Exactly. What if we start by <span>choosing</span> just one <span>main</span> <span>activity</span> <span>per</span> weekend <span>instead</span> of trying to fit <span>three</span> or <span>four<br/></span> 
🎧 That sounds like a good <span>approach</span>. It would give us more time to actually enjoy what we're doing and maybe even some <span>downtime</span> at <span>home<br/></span> 
🎧 Right. Like this <span>Saturday</span>, <span>instead</span> of going to the <span>market</span>, the <span>park</span>, and that <span>evening</span> show, we could just <span>pick</span> the show or even something <span>simpler<br/></span> 
🎧 I'd <span>vote</span> for something <span>outdoors</span>. How about we just plan for a morning <span>hike</span>? We could take a <span>leisurely</span> <span>pace</span> and have a <span>picnic<br/></span> 
🎧 That sounds perfect. Let's go with the <span>hike</span> then. It'll be nice to have a more <span>relaxed</span> day for a <span>change<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2 id="eewe-1-289">Brush off - ignore or dismiss someone or something<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">🔊</b></h2>
🎧 Did you <span>mention</span> the <span>parking</span> issue to the <span>building</span> <span>manager</span> <span>yesterday<br/></span> 
🎧 I did, but he just <span>brushed</span> it off, said there's <span>nothing</span> they can do about the <span>space</span> <span>limitations</span> right <span>now<br/></span> 
🎧 That's <span>frustrating</span>. It's <span>becoming</span> a <span>real</span> <span>problem</span> for everyone here, <span>especially</span> on <span>weekends<br/></span> 
🎧 Absolutely. I <span>suggested</span> maybe <span>marking</span> <span>designated</span> <span>spots</span> or even a <span>rotation</span> <span>system</span>, but he didn't <span>seem</span> interested in <span>discussing</span> it <span>further<br/></span> 
🎧 Maybe we should <span>bring</span> it up at the next <span>tenants</span> <span>meeting</span>. If more people <span>voice</span> their <span>concerns</span>, he might take it more <span>seriously<br/></span> 
🎧 Good idea. A <span>collective</span> <span>approach</span> might make him <span>reconsider</span>. It's <span>worth</span> a <span>shot</span>, at <span>least<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, let's <span>prepare</span> something for the <span>meeting</span>. If we <span>present</span> a <span>well-thought-out</span> plan, it'll be <span>harder</span> to <span>ignore<br/></span> 
🎧 Agreed. We could <span>draft</span> a <span>proposal</span> <span>outlining</span> a few <span>solutions</span>, <span>showing</span> we're <span>proactive</span> about <span>it<br/></span> 
🎧 Exactly. Let's do that. We'll <span>gather</span> some <span>feedback</span> from other <span>tenants</span> too to <span>strengthen</span> our <span>case<br/></span> 
🎧 Sounds like a plan. I'll start <span>reaching</span> out to <span>others</span> this week to get their <span>input<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2 id="eewe-1-387">Firm up - make more definite or secure<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">🔊</b></h2>
🎧 Have you thought about our <span>vacation</span> <span>plans</span> for this <span>summer<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, I have. We need to <span>firm</span> up our <span>dates</span> <span>soon<br/></span> 
🎧 I agree. We should decide by the end of this week. Have you <span>checked</span> any <span>destinations<br/></span> 
🎧 I was thinking about going to the <span>mountains</span>. It's <span>cooler</span> there in the <span>summer<br/></span> 
🎧 That sounds great. We should also look at <span>booking</span> some <span>activities<br/></span> 
🎧 Definitely. I'll start <span>researching</span> <span>hiking</span> <span>trails</span> and maybe some <span>local</span> <span>tours<br/></span> 
🎧 Perfect. We should also <span>firm</span> up our <span>accommodation</span>. <span>Hotels</span> might get <span>booked</span> <span>quickly<br/></span> 
🎧 Good <span>point</span>. I'll check some options today and <span>send</span> you the <span>links<br/></span> 
🎧 Thanks. We should also <span>consider</span> <span>renting</span> a car for <span>flexibility<br/></span> 
🎧 Agreed. Let's make a <span>list</span> of everything we need to <span>firm</span> up before <span>booking<br/></span> 
🎧 Sounds like a plan. I'll <span>draft</span> a <span>list</span> and share it with <span>you<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2 id="eewe-1-468">Quiet down - become quiet, lighter, or calm down<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">🔊</b></h2>
🎧 Did you hear about the <span>concert</span> in the <span>park</span> this weekend? I'm thinking about <span>going<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh, that sounds like fun, but isn't it <span>supposed</span> to be really <span>crowded</span>? These <span>events</span> usually <span>are<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>True</span>, but I think it'll <span>quiet</span> down as the <span>evening</span> <span>goes</span> on. Some people just come for the <span>opening</span> <span>acts</span> and leave <span>early<br/></span> 
🎧 That's a good <span>point</span>. It might be nice to catch the <span>main</span> <span>performance</span> without the <span>earlier</span> <span>hustle</span> and <span>bustle</span>. Who's <span>playing<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>headliner</span> is that new <span>indie</span> <span>band</span> that's been all over the <span>radio</span> lately. <span>Plus</span>, a <span>couple</span> of <span>local</span> <span>groups</span> are <span>opening</span> for <span>them<br/></span> 
🎧 I've heard a few <span>songs</span> from that <span>band</span>. <span>They've</span> got a great sound. Maybe I'll join you. We could <span>grab</span> a <span>spot</span> on the <span>grass</span> as it <span>starts</span> to <span>quiet</span> <span>down<br/></span> 
🎧 Perfect. It's <span>settled</span> then. We'll <span>head</span> over in the <span>late</span> <span>afternoon</span>, enjoy the music, and <span>relax</span>. It'll be a nice <span>break</span> from our <span>usual</span> <span>weekends<br/></span> 
🎧 Agreed. I'll <span>bring</span> some <span>snacks</span>. It'll be a good change of <span>pace<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2 id="eewe-1-559">Iron out - resolve or work out the details<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">🔊</b></h2>
🎧 We really need to <span>iron</span> out the <span>details</span> for our <span>road</span> <span>trip</span> next <span>month<br/></span> 
🎧 Definitely. Should we start with the <span>route</span> and <span>stopovers</span>? I think that's the <span>biggest</span> <span>task<br/></span> 
🎧 Good idea. We should map out the <span>main</span> <span>stops</span> we want to make and <span>figure</span> out how long we'll <span>stay</span> at each <span>one<br/></span> 
🎧 Right. And we should also look into <span>accommodations</span>. I'll <span>research</span> some <span>places</span> where we can <span>stay</span> along the <span>way<br/></span> 
🎧 Perfect. And let's not <span>forget</span> about <span>meals</span> and <span>activities</span>. Maybe we can find some <span>interesting</span> <span>spots</span> to eat and <span>explore<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll make a <span>list</span>. Also, we need to decide on the <span>budget</span> and how we're <span>splitting</span> <span>costs<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, let's keep everything <span>transparent</span>. We can <span>create</span> a <span>shared</span> <span>document</span> and <span>update</span> it as we go <span>along<br/></span> 
🎧 That sounds <span>efficient</span>. Once we have all the <span>information</span>, we can <span>review</span> it together and make any <span>necessary</span> <span>adjustments<br/></span> 
🎧 Agreed. It's better to <span>iron</span> out all these issues now rather than <span>deal</span> with <span>surprises</span> on the <span>road<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2 id="eewe-1-656">Talk down - speak to someone as if they are inferior<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">🔊</b></h2>
🎧 I was at the <span>electronic</span> <span>store</span> <span>yesterday</span> trying to <span>pick</span> a new <span>laptop</span>, and the <span>salesperson</span> really <span>started</span> talking down to me when I <span>asked</span> about the <span>specs<br/></span> 
🎧 Oh no, that's the <span>worst</span>. What did they <span>say<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, when I <span>mentioned</span> I was looking for something with a <span>high-performance</span> <span>processor</span> and a <span>solid-state</span> drive, he kind of <span>smirked</span> and said, <span>"Let</span> me find you something easy to use, something more <span>suited</span> for your <span>level."<br/></span> 
🎧 That's <span>incredibly</span> <span>condescending</span>. You know your <span>tech</span>. Did you set him <span>straight<br/></span> 
🎧 I did. I told him I've been <span>following</span> the <span>latest</span> in <span>tech</span> <span>developments</span> for years and that I probably <span>knew</span> more about their <span>products</span> than he did. I could tell he didn't <span>expect</span> <span>that<br/></span> 
🎧 Good for you. It's <span>frustrating</span> how some people <span>assume</span> they need to <span>simplify</span> everything. Did you find a <span>laptop</span> you <span>liked</span> in the <span>end<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, I <span>ended</span> up <span>finding</span> one with the <span>exact</span> <span>specs</span> I wanted, and I made sure to check out with another <span>salesperson<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2 id="eewe-1-741">X-ray - examine thoroughly<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">🔊</b></h2>
🎧 I finally took my car to the <span>mechanic</span> because it was <span>making</span> that <span>strange</span> <span>noise</span> again. They had to <span>x-ray</span> the whole <span>engine</span> to find the <span>issue<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>X-ray</span> the <span>engine</span>? I didn't know they could do that. What did they <span>find<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, not <span>literally</span> <span>x-ray</span>, but they did a <span>thorough</span> <span>scan</span> <span>using</span> some <span>advanced</span> <span>diagnostic</span> <span>tools</span>. <span>Turns</span> out a small <span>part</span> was about to <span>fail</span> inside the <span>gearbox<br/></span> 
🎧 That sounds serious. Good thing you got it <span>checked</span> out in time. What's the <span>damage</span>? Are <span>repairs</span> going to be <span>costly<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Thankfully</span>, it's not as bad as it could have been. They can <span>replace</span> the <span>part</span> without having to <span>rebuild</span> the <span>entire</span> <span>gearbox</span>. It's still going to <span>cost</span> a bit, <span>though<br/></span> 
🎧 Better than <span>needing</span> a whole new <span>gearbox</span>. It's <span>impressive</span> how they can <span>diagnose</span> these things so <span>precisely</span> <span>now<br/></span> 
🎧 Absolutely. The <span>technology</span> they use these <span>days</span> <span>allows</span> them to <span>examine</span> everything so <span>thoroughly</span>. It's like <span>giving</span> the car a <span>full-body</span> <span>scan<br/></span> 
🎧 Makes me think I should get my car <span>checked</span> too. Better <span>safe</span> than sorry, <span>right<br/></span> 
🎧 Definitely a good idea. <span>Regular</span> <span>checks</span> can <span>save</span> you a lot in the long <span>run<br/>
</span> <span><br/>
</span>

<h2 id="eewe-1-846">Act on - take action because of information or advice<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">🔊</b></h2>
🎧 I got an <span>interesting</span> tip from a friend about a new <span>investment</span> <span>opportunity<br/></span> 
🎧 Really? What's it <span>about<br/></span> 
🎧 It's about <span>investing</span> in <span>renewable</span> <span>energy</span> <span>stocks</span>. <span>They've</span> been <span>performing</span> well <span>lately<br/></span> 
🎧 That sounds <span>promising</span>. Are you planning to act on that <span>advice<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm <span>considering</span> it. I need to do a bit more <span>research</span> first. Have you heard anything about these <span>stocks<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, I've read some <span>articles</span> saying they're a good <span>long-term</span> <span>investment</span>. It might be a good idea to act on it <span>sooner</span> rather than <span>later<br/></span> 
🎧 That's what I'm thinking. I just want to make sure I'm <span>making</span> an <span>informed</span> <span>decision<br/></span> 
🎧 Definitely. Maybe we could look into it together and share what we <span>find<br/></span> 
🎧 That's a great idea. Let's meet up this weekend and go through the <span>information<br/></span> 
🎧 Sounds like a <span>plan<br/>
</span><br/>

<h2 id="eewe-1-928">Kick around - Discuss informally<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">🔊</b></h2>
🎧 Have you thought <span>anymore</span> about the idea we were <span>kicking</span> around last week?<br/>
🎧 You mean the <span>community</span> garden <span>project</span>? Yeah, I've been thinking about it a lot. It could really <span>bring</span> people together.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely. I was thinking we could start by <span>hosting</span> a <span>meeting</span> to <span>gather</span> <span>interest</span>, see who else <span>wants</span> to get <span>involved</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's a good plan. We should also <span>kick</span> around some <span>ideas</span> for <span>possible</span> <span>locations</span>. Do you have any in <span>mind</span>?<br/>
🎧 There's that <span>vacant</span> lot near the <span>library</span>. It's been <span>unused</span> for years and <span>gets</span> <span>plenty</span> of <span>sunlight</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's a great <span>spot</span>. We'd need to get <span>permission</span> from the <span>city</span>, though. Should we <span>kick</span> around how we might <span>present</span> this to the <span>council</span>?<br/>
🎧 Sure, we could put together a <span>proposal</span> <span>outlining</span> the <span>benefits</span> like <span>community</span> <span>engagement</span> and <span>fresh</span> <span>produce</span>.<br/>
🎧 And we could <span>include</span> some success <span>stories</span> from other <span>community</span> <span>gardens</span>. It might help <span>persuade</span> them.<br/>
🎧 Good idea. Let's also think about <span>potential</span> <span>sponsors</span>. <span>Local</span> <span>businesses</span> might be <span>willing</span> to <span>support</span> us.<br/>
🎧 Yes, <span>especially</span> if we <span>offer</span> to <span>feature</span> them in any <span>publicity</span>. This is really <span>coming</span> together. We should set a date for our first <span>meeting</span>.<br/>
🎧 Agreed. I'll <span>draft</span> an <span>announcement</span> and we can start <span>spreading</span> the <span>word</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>
</span>

<h2 id="eewe-1-1029">Weigh in - Give an opinion or enter a discussion<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">🔊</b></h2>
🎧 Have you <span>seen</span> the new <span>policy</span> changes they're <span>proposing</span> in our <span>community</span> <span>newsletter</span>?<br/>
🎧 I <span>skimmed</span> through it, but I haven't <span>gone</span> into the <span>details</span> yet. What's it about?<br/>
🎧 They're <span>considering</span> <span>implementing</span> <span>stricter</span> <span>parking</span> <span>regulations</span> around <span>Main</span> <span>Street</span>. I think it might be a bit too <span>restrictive</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that could be <span>tricky</span> for people who visit the <span>shops</span> there. What's their <span>reasoning</span>?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>mainly</span> to <span>reduce</span> <span>congestion</span> and make the <span>area</span> <span>safer</span> for <span>pedestrians</span>. I see their <span>point</span>, but I'm not sure it's the best <span>approach</span>.<br/>
🎧 Maybe they could <span>introduce</span> a <span>permit</span> <span>system</span> <span>instead</span>. That way, <span>residents</span> and <span>shop</span> <span>owners</span> aren't <span>negatively</span> <span>impacted</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's a good idea. Do you think we should <span>weigh</span> in on this? Maybe <span>write</span> a <span>joint</span> <span>response</span>?<br/>
🎧 Definitely. We should <span>offer</span> some <span>alternatives</span>. It's important to get <span>involved</span>, <span>especially</span> if it <span>affects</span> us <span>directly</span>.<br/>
🎧 Agreed. Let's <span>draft</span> something this weekend. I'll <span>gather</span> some more <span>feedback</span> from the <span>neighbors</span> too.<br/>
🎧 Perfect. I'll look into some other <span>cities'</span> <span>policies</span> and see if we can find a better <span>solution</span>.<br/>

🎧 Did you hear why the <span>meeting</span> <span>started</span> so <span>late</span> today?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, <span>apparently</span> there was a <span>traffic</span> <span>accident</span> that <span>held</span> everyone up.<br/>
🎧 That <span>explains</span> it. I thought something serious <span>happened</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was just a <span>minor</span> <span>fender</span> <span>bender</span>, but it <span>caused</span> a <span>huge</span> <span>traffic</span> <span>jam</span>.<br/>
🎧 I see. It's good that no one was <span>hurt</span>. By the way, did you hear about the <span>bank</span> <span>robbery</span> <span>downtown</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, I didn't. What <span>happened</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Someone</span> <span>held</span> up the <span>bank</span> <span>yesterday</span> <span>afternoon</span>. They got away with a lot of money.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>crazy</span>. Do they have any <span>leads</span> on who did it?<br/>
🎧 Not yet. The <span>police</span> are still <span>investigating</span>, but the <span>robbers</span> <span>wore</span> <span>masks</span>, so it's <span>hard</span> to <span>identify</span> them.<br/>
🎧 I hope they catch them soon. It's <span>scary</span> to think something like that could <span>happen</span> here.<br/>
🎧 Definitely. We need to <span>stay</span> <span>alert</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>
</span>

<h2 id="eewe-1-1211">Invite over - Ask someone to come to your home<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">🔊</b></h2>
🎧 Hey, are you free this <span>Saturday</span> <span>evening</span>? I was thinking of having a small <span>get-together</span> at my place.<br/>
🎧 That sounds like fun. What's the <span>occasion</span>?<br/>
🎧 No special <span>occasion</span> really. I just thought it would be nice to <span>invite</span> everyone over, catch up, and <span>spend</span> some time together. It's been a while since we all <span>hung</span> out.<br/>
🎧 You're right, it has been too long. Who else are you <span>inviting</span> over?<br/>
🎧 Just the <span>usual</span> <span>gang</span>. I'll make some <span>appetizers</span>, and we can play some <span>games</span>, maybe even <span>watch</span> a movie later in the <span>evening</span>.<br/>
🎧 Perfect. Do you need me to <span>bring</span> anything? <span>Drinks</span>? <span>Snacks</span>?<br/>
🎧 If you could <span>bring</span> some <span>drinks</span>, that would be great. I've got the food <span>covered</span>, but more <span>drinks</span> are always a good idea.<br/>
🎧 <span>Consider</span> it done. I'll <span>bring</span> a mix of <span>sodas</span> and some <span>wine</span>. Does that work?<br/>
🎧 That's perfect, thanks. It's going to be a <span>relaxed</span> <span>evening</span>, just what we all need.<br/>
🎧 Looking forward to it. Thanks for <span>inviting</span> me over. I'll see you <span>Saturday</span> then.<br/>
🎧 Great! See you <span>Saturday</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>
</span>

<h2 id="eewe-1-1312">Reach out - Attempt to contact or communicate<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">🔊</b></h2>
🎧 Have you heard from <span>Sarah</span> <span>recently</span>?<br/>
🎧 No, it's been a while. I was thinking I should <span>reach</span> out to her. We used to <span>hang</span> out all the time.<br/>
🎧 That's a good idea. I've been <span>meaning</span> to do the same. Maybe we can plan a <span>get-together</span>.<br/>
🎧 Definitely. She's probably <span>busy</span> with work, but I'm sure she'd <span>appreciate</span> it if we <span>reached</span> out.<br/>
🎧 How about we <span>send</span> her a <span>message</span> today and see if she's free this weekend?<br/>
🎧 Sounds perfect. We can <span>suggest</span> <span>meeting</span> for <span>coffee</span> or lunch, something <span>casual</span> to catch up.<br/>
🎧 I'll <span>draft</span> a <span>message</span> and <span>include</span> both of us. She'll love <span>hearing</span> from us.<br/>
🎧 Great! It'll be nice to <span>reconnect</span>. I <span>miss</span> our old group <span>outings</span>.<br/>
🎧 Me too. Let's make it a <span>regular</span> thing if she's up for it.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely. <span>Reaching</span> out more often will help keep our <span>friendship</span> <span>strong</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>
</span>

<h2 id="eewe-1-1394">Smooth over - Make problems seem less serious<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">🔊</b></h2>
🎧 Did you hear about the <span>argument</span> at <span>Mark's</span> <span>party</span> last <span>night</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I heard <span>bits</span> and <span>pieces</span>. What exactly <span>happened</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Apparently</span>, there was a <span>misunderstanding</span> between <span>Jane</span> and <span>Tom</span>. Things got <span>heated</span> <span>pretty</span> quickly.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>unfortunate</span>. Did <span>anyone</span> try to <span>smooth</span> things over?<br/>
🎧 <span>Mark</span> did. He <span>stepped</span> in and <span>calmed</span> them both down. He's good at <span>making</span> <span>problems</span> <span>seem</span> less serious.<br/>
🎧 That's good to hear. <span>Mark's</span> always been great at <span>diffusing</span> <span>tense</span> <span>situations</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, he <span>managed</span> to get them talking and <span>understanding</span> each <span>other's</span> <span>perspective</span>. It <span>ended</span> on a much better <span>note</span>.<br/>
🎧 Glad to hear it. I was <span>worried</span> it might have <span>ruined</span> the <span>party</span> for everyone.<br/>
🎧 It could have, but <span>Mark's</span> <span>intervention</span> really <span>helped</span> <span>smooth</span> things over. By the end, everyone was <span>enjoying</span> <span>themselves</span> again.<br/>
🎧 That's a <span>relief</span>. I'll check in with <span>Jane</span> and <span>Tom</span> later, just to make sure they're okay.<br/>
🎧 Good idea. A little <span>follow-up</span> never <span>hurts</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>
</span>

<h2 id="eewe-1-1486">Whip up - Prepare quickly<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">🔊</b></h2>
🎧 Hey, I was thinking about <span>inviting</span> some friends over <span>tonight</span>. Do you have any <span>ideas</span> for what we could <span>serve</span>?<br/>
🎧 Sure, we can <span>whip</span> up some <span>quick</span> <span>appetizers</span>. How about a <span>platter</span> with <span>cheese</span>, <span>crackers</span>, and some <span>fresh</span> <span>fruit</span>?<br/>
🎧 That sounds good. What about something a bit more <span>substantial</span>?<br/>
🎧 We could also <span>whip</span> up a <span>batch</span> of <span>mini</span> <span>sandwiches</span>. They're <span>quick</span> to make and always a hit.<br/>
🎧 Great idea. Do you think we need anything <span>sweet</span>?<br/>
🎧 Absolutely. We could <span>whip</span> up some <span>brownies</span> or <span>cookies</span>. They're easy and everyone <span>loves</span> them.<br/>
🎧 Perfect. Do we have everything we need, or should we make a <span>quick</span> <span>trip</span> to the <span>store</span>?<br/>
🎧 Let me check. I think we might need more <span>cheese</span> and some <span>chocolate</span> <span>chips</span> for the <span>brownies</span>.<br/>
🎧 All right, let's make a <span>quick</span> <span>shopping</span> <span>list</span> and <span>head</span> out.<br/>

🎧 Yes, I did. It <span>seems</span> like everyone is talking about it. Have you been there yet?<br/>
🎧 Not yet, but I'm planning to go this weekend. I heard they have amazing <span>pastries</span>.<br/>
🎧 I love <span>pastries</span>. Maybe I'll check it out too. By the way, did you <span>finish</span> the <span>report</span> for our <span>project</span>?<br/>
🎧 Almost. I just need to add a few more <span>details</span>. How about you?<br/>
🎧 I'm done with <span>mine</span>. Oh, <span>speaking</span> of the <span>café</span>, I heard they have a live <span>band</span> playing on <span>weekends</span>.<br/>
🎧 That sounds fun. Maybe we can go together.<br/>
🎧 Sure, why not? Oh, remember last week when that guy <span>barged</span> in during our <span>meeting</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, that was so <span>unexpected</span>. He didn't even <span>apologize</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some people have no <span>manners</span>. <span>Anyway</span>, let's plan for the <span>café</span> this <span>Saturday</span>.<br/>

🎧 Not yet. I still have a few more <span>responses</span> to key in. It's taking <span>longer</span> than I thought.<br/>
🎧 I can <span>imagine</span>. How many <span>responses</span> do you have <span>left</span>?<br/>
🎧 About <span>50</span> more. I've been at it for hours, just <span>keying</span> in each <span>response</span> one by one.<br/>
🎧 That sounds <span>tedious</span>. Do you need any help?<br/>
🎧 That would be great if you could key in some of the <span>responses</span>. It would <span>speed</span> things up a lot.<br/>
🎧 Sure, just show me where to start. I can take over for a bit.<br/>
🎧 Thanks. Here's the <span>spreadsheet</span>. Just key in the <span>data</span> from these <span>forms</span>.<br/>
🎧 Got it! I'll start with these and see how <span>far</span> I get.<br/>

🎧 I heard you've <span>started</span> <span>running</span> in the <span>mornings</span>. How's that going?<br/>
🎧 It's been good. I'm actually trying to catch up with <span>Jenna's</span> <span>pace</span>. She's been at it for years and is <span>super</span> <span>fast</span> now.<br/>
🎧 <span>Jenna</span> is quite the <span>athlete</span>. <span>Catching</span> up with her will definitely be a <span>challenge</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, she <span>runs</span> like the <span>wind</span>, but it's a good <span>target</span> to <span>aim</span> for. It <span>keeps</span> me <span>motivated</span>.<br/>
🎧 Have you thought about <span>joining</span> any <span>local</span> <span>races</span>? That might give you an <span>extra</span> <span>push</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>considering</span> it. There's a <span>5k</span> next month that <span>Jenna</span> <span>mentioned</span>. Maybe <span>running</span> the same <span>race</span> will help me <span>gauge</span> how much I've <span>improved</span>.<br/>
🎧 That sounds like a perfect <span>opportunity</span>. <span>Plus</span>, the <span>competitive</span> <span>environment</span> could really <span>spur</span> you on.<br/>
🎧 Exactly. I plan to <span>sign</span> up this week. <span>Hopefully</span>, I'll start <span>closing</span> the <span>gap</span> soon.<br/>
🎧 You're on the right <span>track</span>. Keep <span>pushing</span>, and you'll be at her <span>level</span> before you know it.<br/>

🎧 Have you <span>noticed</span> how the <span>traffic</span> has finally <span>started</span> to <span>die</span> down around here?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's been a <span>relief</span>. During the <span>construction</span> last month, it was <span>unbearable</span>. How's the <span>noise</span> been on your end?<br/>
🎧 Much better now. The <span>constant</span> <span>honking</span> and <span>engine</span> <span>noises</span> have definitely <span>decreased</span>. It's <span>quieter</span> in the <span>mornings</span>, <span>especially</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's good to hear. I think they <span>finished</span> the <span>major</span> <span>parts</span> of the <span>roadwork</span>, so the <span>worst</span> should be over now.<br/>
🎧 I hope so. It was <span>disrupting</span> my <span>work-from-home</span> <span>routine</span>. I couldn't <span>concentrate</span> with all that <span>noise</span>.<br/>
🎧 Same here. <span>Plus</span>, it used to take me an <span>extra</span> <span>30</span> <span>minutes</span> just to get through that one <span>congested</span> <span>area</span>. It's nice to see things <span>returning</span> to <span>normal</span>.<br/>
🎧 Definitely. It's about time things <span>started</span> to <span>settle</span> down. Have you been <span>using</span> the new <span>route</span> now that the <span>main</span> <span>road</span> is <span>clearer</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, it's actually much <span>faster</span>. It <span>seems</span> like many haven't <span>caught</span> on yet, so it's less <span>crowded</span> too.<br/>
🎧 I'll have to try that then. Anything to <span>avoid</span> a <span>repeat</span> of last <span>month's</span> <span>chaos</span>.<br/>

🎧 No, I <span>planned</span> to, but I <span>completely</span> <span>flaked</span> out. I <span>fell</span> <span>asleep</span> on the <span>couch</span>.<br/>
🎧 Really? That's too bad. It was a great <span>party</span>. Everyone was <span>asking</span> about you.<br/>
🎧 I know. I feel <span>awful</span> about it. I just got home from work and <span>meant</span> to <span>rest</span> for a bit, but I <span>ended</span> up <span>flaking</span> out.<br/>
🎧 It <span>happens</span>. You must have been really <span>tired</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, it's been a <span>busy</span> week. Did I <span>miss</span> anything <span>exciting</span>?<br/>
🎧 A lot of people <span>showed</span> up, and there was live music. <span>Emily</span> even made a big <span>announcement</span>.<br/>
🎧 What was the <span>announcement</span>?<br/>
🎧 She's <span>moving</span> to New <span>York</span> for a new <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 Wow, that's <span>huge</span>. I really wish I hadn't <span>flaked</span> out.<br/>

🎧 So, what are you thinking for dinner <span>tonight</span>? There's a new <span>Thai</span> place that just <span>opened</span> up down the <span>street</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Thai</span> sounds good, but didn't you <span>mention</span> that <span>sushi</span> <span>spot</span> near the <span>park</span> last week? We could check that out <span>instead</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>True</span>. I've heard good things about it, but I'm really in the <span>mood</span> for something <span>spicy</span> <span>tonight</span>. The <span>Thai</span> place is <span>supposed</span> to have the best <span>curry</span> in <span>town</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, we had <span>Japanese</span> just last week, didn't we? Maybe it's better to try something different this time. <span>Plus</span>, a good <span>curry</span> does sound <span>tempting</span>.<br/>
🎧 All right, let's <span>opt</span> for the <span>Thai</span> place then. It'll be nice to try something new, and a little <span>spice</span> might be just what we need to <span>liven</span> up the week.<br/>

🎧 Any <span>ideas</span> so <span>far</span>? I'm <span>torn</span> between the <span>mountains</span> and the <span>beach</span>. Both sound <span>appealing</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>understand</span>. What are you looking for in a <span>vacation</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm looking for <span>relaxation</span>, but also a bit of <span>adventure</span>. That's why it's <span>hard</span> to <span>hone</span> in on one place.<br/>
🎧 Have you <span>considered</span> a place that <span>offers</span> both, like a <span>coastal</span> <span>town</span> near the <span>mountains</span>?<br/>
🎧 That's a good idea. I hadn't thought of that. It would let me have the best of both <span>worlds</span>.<br/>
🎧 Exactly. You can <span>relax</span> by the sea and then go <span>hiking</span> or <span>exploring</span> in the <span>mountains</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll definitely look into that. It might be just what I need.<br/>

🎧 Yeah, I saw the <span>flyers</span>. It looks like a good <span>cause</span>. Are you going to join in?<br/>
🎧 I'm planning to. It <span>supports</span> <span>local</span> <span>schools</span>, and I <span>figured</span> it would also be a great way to get a bit of <span>exercise</span>. How about you? Want to run it with me?<br/>
🎧 I'm not much of a <span>runner</span>, but it does sound like a fun <span>event</span> for a good <span>cause</span>. Sure, I'll join in. Maybe I can <span>convince</span> a few <span>others</span> from the <span>office</span> to come along.<br/>
🎧 That would be <span>fantastic</span>! The more the <span>merrier</span>. They're also having a <span>picnic</span> <span>afterward</span> for all the <span>participants</span> and their <span>families</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>Awesome</span>! I'll <span>send</span> you the <span>sign-up</span> <span>link</span>. Thanks for <span>deciding</span> to join in. It's always more fun to do these things together.<br/>

🎧 Do you think it's a good idea to get <span>involved</span>?<br/>
🎧 It could be, but we'd need to look at his <span>business</span> plan first. If we decide to <span>bail</span> him out, we should make sure it's a sound <span>investment</span>.<br/>
🎧 Agreed. Maybe we can meet with him and <span>discuss</span> the <span>details</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's a good idea. We can get a <span>clearer</span> <span>picture</span> and decide if we want to <span>bail</span> him out.<br/>

🎧 I'll <span>grab</span> my <span>jacket</span>. The <span>weather's</span> <span>turned</span> <span>chilly</span>, hasn't it?<br/>
🎧 Definitely has. I'm just <span>hoping</span> <span>everything's</span> okay. It's not like our <span>neighborhood</span> to have such <span>loud</span> <span>disturbances</span>.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely. I'll <span>bring</span> a <span>flashlight</span> too. It's getting <span>dark</span> <span>earlier</span> these <span>days</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good thinking. Let's be <span>quick</span>, though. If it's just a <span>celebration</span>, we shouldn't <span>intrude</span> for too long.<br/>

🎧 Really? That doesn't sound like her at all. Did something <span>happen</span>?<br/>
🎧 I'm not sure. One <span>moment</span> she was there, and the next she was <span>gone</span>. No one saw her leave or <span>knew</span> why she <span>left</span> so <span>suddenly</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>bizarre</span>. Did <span>anyone</span> try <span>calling</span> her to see if she's okay?<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I called her this morning. She didn't give much <span>detail</span> but said she just <span>needed</span> some air and time to think. She <span>sounded</span> all right, just a bit <span>overwhelmed</span>, I <span>guess</span>.<br/>
🎧 I hope she's okay. Maybe the <span>crowd</span> got to be too much. It was <span>pretty</span> <span>packed</span> there.<br/>
🎧 That's what I was thinking. We should probably give her some <span>space</span> for now, but maybe in a <span>couple</span> of <span>days</span> we could check in on her to see if she <span>wants</span> to talk.<br/>
🎧 Good idea. It's important to <span>support</span> friends, <span>especially</span> when they do something out of the <span>ordinary</span> like that.<br/>

<h2 id="eewe-1-2532">Double up - Share something intended for one person with another<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">🔊</b></h2>
🎧 Hey, did you know the new <span>office</span> <span>policy</span> now <span>allows</span> us to <span>double</span> up on <span>hotel</span> <span>rooms</span> during <span>conferences</span>? They're trying to cut down on travel <span>expenses</span>.<br/>
🎧 Really? <span>Doubling</span> up on <span>hotel</span> <span>rooms</span>? That could be a bit <span>awkward</span> <span>depending</span> on who you end up <span>sharing</span> with.<br/>
🎧 I had the same thought. They did <span>mention</span> that <span>rooming</span> <span>assignments</span> would be <span>voluntary</span>, so you can choose to share with <span>someone</span> you're <span>comfortable</span> with or <span>opt</span> out and pay the <span>difference</span> for a <span>single</span> room.<br/>
🎧 That's a <span>relief</span>. It's a good way to <span>save</span> money, I <span>guess</span>. <span>Plus</span>, it might make the <span>trip</span> more <span>enjoyable</span> if you're <span>rooming</span> with a friend.<br/>
🎧 Exactly. And it's not just about <span>saving</span> <span>money—they're</span> also <span>framing</span> it as a <span>team-building</span> <span>opportunity</span>. You know, more time to <span>connect</span> with <span>colleagues</span> in a less <span>formal</span> <span>setting</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can see the <span>benefit</span> in that. Maybe we should <span>pair</span> up for the next <span>conference</span>. We'd probably have a great time.<br/>
🎧 I'm in! It'll <span>double</span> the fun and <span>halve</span> the <span>cost</span>. Let's let <span>HR</span> know we're <span>pairing</span> up.<br/>
 <span><br/>
</span>

<h2 id="eewe-1-2624">Play up - Emphasize or exaggerate<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">🔊</b></h2>
🎧 I just got back from the car <span>dealership</span>. You wouldn't <span>believe</span> the <span>sales</span> <span>pitch</span> I got today.<br/>
🎧 Oh, do tell. Was it the <span>usual</span> <span>spiel</span> or something out of the <span>ordinary</span>?<br/>
🎧 They were really playing up the <span>features</span> of the <span>latest</span> <span>model</span>. I mean, the car does have some nice <span>upgrades</span>, but the way they <span>talked</span> about the <span>onboard</span> <span>technology</span> was as if it could drive <span>itself</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>salespeople</span> for <span>you—always</span> <span>making</span> things sound more <span>revolutionary</span> than they are. Did you end up <span>liking</span> the car, though?<br/>
🎧 I <span>liked</span> it, yes. It's <span>sleek</span> and <span>drives</span> <span>smoothly</span>, but with how they were <span>pushing</span> it, I <span>felt</span> like I was <span>buying</span> a <span>spaceship</span>, not a <span>sedan</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sounds like they know how to make an <span>impression</span>. Are you thinking about going for it, or are you looking at other options?<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>considering</span> it. The <span>car's</span> good, but I need to do a bit more <span>research</span>. I don't want to make a <span>decision</span> <span>based</span> <span>solely</span> on an <span>exaggerated</span> <span>sales</span> <span>pitch</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Smart</span> move. Take your time, and maybe you'll find something even better without all the <span>hype</span>.<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="eewe-1-2719">Knockout - Defeat or overwhelm<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">🔊</b></h2>
🎧 Did you <span>watch</span> the <span>boxing</span> <span>match</span> last <span>night</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I did. That <span>knockout</span> in the <span>final</span> <span>round</span> was <span>unexpected</span>.<br/>
🎧 Absolutely. I thought it was going to go the <span>distance</span>. The <span>champion</span> really <span>knocked</span> out the <span>challenger</span> with that last <span>punch</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was a <span>stunning</span> end. I read that it was <span>considered</span> one of the <span>fastest</span> <span>knockouts</span> in <span>championship</span> <span>history</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, the <span>precision</span> was <span>remarkable</span>. Also, the way he <span>managed</span> to <span>maintain</span> his <span>composure</span> <span>throughout</span> the <span>fight</span> and then <span>deliver</span> such a <span>powerful</span> <span>blow—truly</span> <span>professional</span>.<br/>
🎧 Agreed. It's not just about the <span>strength</span> but also <span>strategy</span> and <span>timing</span>. <span>Speaking</span> of which, do you practice any <span>martial</span> <span>arts</span> yourself?<br/>
🎧 I used to do <span>karate</span> a few years back. It's a great way to <span>stay</span> fit and learn <span>discipline</span>. What about you?<br/>
🎧 I've been thinking about <span>starting</span>. After watching last <span>night's</span> <span>match</span>, I'm <span>totally</span> <span>knocked</span> out by the idea of <span>learning</span> those <span>skills</span>.<br/>
🎧 You should go for it. It's <span>challenging</span> but very <span>rewarding</span>. Maybe it'll be you in the <span>ring</span> <span>someday</span>.<br/>
🎧 Who <span>knows</span>? For now, I'll start with the <span>basics</span>.<br/>
 <span><br/>

<h2 id="eewe-1-2808">Bear out - Confirm the truth<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">🔊</b></h2>
🎧 Did you hear back about the <span>results</span> from that <span>study</span> on <span>climate</span> change?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I did. The <span>predictions</span> about <span>rising</span> sea <span>levels</span> were actually <span>borne</span> out. The <span>data</span> <span>confirmed</span> what many <span>scientists</span> have been <span>warning</span> about for years.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>alarming</span>, yet <span>somehow</span> not <span>surprising</span>. It's a <span>pity</span> that such <span>studies</span> only <span>confirm</span> the <span>dire</span> <span>situation</span> rather than <span>pointing</span> to a <span>slowdown</span> in these <span>trends</span>.<br/>
🎧 Exactly. It <span>seems</span> like each new <span>study</span> just <span>continues</span> to <span>bear</span> out the <span>previous</span> <span>findings</span>, no <span>matter</span> how much we hope for different <span>results</span>.<br/>
🎧 What do you think it will take for more <span>decisive</span> <span>action</span> to be taken?<br/>
🎧 It'll <span>require</span> <span>overwhelming</span> <span>public</span> <span>demand</span> and <span>possibly</span> more <span>immediate</span> <span>impacts</span> that <span>affect</span> a <span>broader</span> <span>range</span> of <span>areas</span>. <span>Unfortunately</span>, as these <span>studies</span> <span>bear</span> out the <span>predictions</span>, it might just be what <span>pushes</span> people to finally act.<br/>
🎧 Let's hope it doesn't get to the <span>worst</span> before we start <span>seeing</span> some <span>real</span> changes.<br/>
🎧 Agreed. Sometimes <span>confirming</span> the <span>truth</span> isn't <span>enough—it</span> needs to <span>translate</span> into <span>action</span>.<br/>
