<h2 id="eewe-2-">Dress Down - Wear Casual Clothes<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">ðŸ”Š</b></h2>
ðŸŽ§ Did you see the <span>email</span> about <span>Friday's</span> <span>team</span> <span>outing</span>? They said we can <span>dress</span> down for the day.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Yeah, I saw that. <span>It's</span> nice to have a <span>break</span> from the <span>usual</span> <span>business</span> <span>attire</span>. <span>I'm</span> thinking of <span>wearing</span> <span>jeans</span> and a <span>T-shirt</span> since they <span>mentioned</span> <span>games</span> and a <span>barbecue</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That sounds good. <span>It's</span> always funny <span>seeing</span> everyone out of their <span>formal</span> <span>office</span> <span>wear</span>, <span>isn't</span> it?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Definitely, but <span>it's</span> a nice change. It helps everyone <span>relax</span> and <span>connect</span> better.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>True</span>, and <span>it's</span> way <span>easier</span> to join <span>activities</span> when <span>you're</span> not in a <span>suit</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Exactly! <span>I'm</span> looking forward to it. <span>Let's</span> hope the <span>weather</span> <span>cooperates</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Me too. <span>Casual</span> <span>Fridays</span> <span>don't</span> <span>happen</span> often, so <span>let's</span> make the most of it!<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="eewe-2-">Mark Down - Reduce the Price<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">ðŸ”Š</b></h2>
ðŸŽ§ Have you been to the new <span>store</span> <span>downtown</span> yet?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Not yet. <span>What's</span> it like?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I went <span>yesterday</span>, and they have <span>tons</span> of <span>items</span> <span>marked</span> down.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Really? How big are the <span>discounts</span>?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Some <span>items</span> are up to <span>50%</span> off. I got a new <span>jacket</span> for <span>half</span> the <span>original</span> <span>price</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>That's</span> amazing! <span>I've</span> been looking for <span>deals</span> on <span>winter</span> <span>clothes</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ You should check it out. They have a great <span>selection</span>, and the <span>markdowns</span> are <span>substantial</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you think the <span>sale</span> will last long?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Not sure, but the <span>salesperson</span> said <span>they're</span> <span>clearing</span> out <span>inventory</span>, so it might go on for a while.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Good to know. <span>I'll</span> try to go this weekend and see what I can find.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Sounds like a <span>planâ€”you</span> might find some great <span>deals</span>!<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="eewe-2-">Jump In - Enter Into an Activity With Enthusiasm<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">ðŸ”Š</b></h2>
ðŸŽ§ Have you ever <span>tried</span> <span>salsa</span> <span>dancing</span>? <span>I'm</span> thinking about <span>signing</span> up for <span>classes</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Actually, <span>I've</span> been going for a <span>couple</span> of <span>months</span> now. You should <span>jump</span> <span>inâ€”the</span> <span>classes</span> are a <span>blast</span>!<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Really? It sounds like fun, but <span>I'm</span> a bit <span>nervous</span> since <span>I've</span> never <span>danced</span> before.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I <span>felt</span> the same way at first, but the <span>instructors</span> are great. Everyone is a <span>beginner</span> at some <span>point</span>, so <span>there's</span> no <span>pressure</span> to be perfect.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>That's</span> <span>reassuring</span>. What should I <span>expect</span> from my first class?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ They usually start with simple <span>steps</span> and <span>timing</span>, then <span>gradually</span> add more <span>complex</span> <span>moves</span> as you get <span>comfortable</span>. <span>It's</span> very <span>progressive</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That sounds <span>manageable</span>. How often do the <span>classes</span> meet?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>They're</span> <span>held</span> <span>twice</span> a week, but you can <span>jump</span> in <span>anytime</span>. <span>There's</span> no set <span>sequence</span>, so you <span>won't</span> <span>fall</span> behind.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Great! That <span>flexibility</span> helps. Maybe <span>I'll</span> join you next week.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Absolutely! I think <span>you'll</span> enjoy <span>itâ€”it's</span> a great way to <span>unwind</span> and meet new people.<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="eewe-2-">Catch Off Guard - Surprise Someone Unexpectedly<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">ðŸ”Š</b></h2>
ðŸŽ§ Did you hear about <span>Sarah's</span> <span>surprise</span> <span>party</span> last weekend?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ No, I <span>missed</span> it. How did it go?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ It was <span>incredible</span>. We <span>totally</span> <span>caught</span> her off <span>guardâ€”she</span> thought she was going to a dinner for her <span>brother's</span> <span>promotion</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>That's</span> <span>brilliant</span>! Her <span>reaction</span> must have been <span>priceless</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Absolutely. She was <span>speechless</span> at first. It took her a <span>moment</span> to take it all in, and everyone did a great <span>job</span> <span>keeping</span> it a <span>secret</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Who all was there?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Pretty</span> much the whole <span>gang</span> and some of her <span>family</span> <span>members</span>. We had it at her <span>favorite</span> <span>restaurant</span> <span>downtown</span>, and the place was <span>decorated</span> <span>beautifully</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That sounds like a lot of fun. Did you <span>guys</span> do anything special?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Yeah, we put together a <span>video</span> <span>montage</span> of <span>memories</span> from everyone. It was a mix of funny and <span>heartfelt</span> <span>messages</span>, and it definitely <span>caught</span> her off <span>guard</span> too.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Wow, <span>that's</span> so <span>thoughtful</span>. <span>I'll</span> have to check in with <span>herâ€”it</span> sounds like it was a <span>night</span> to remember.<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="eewe-2-">Give Back - Return Something to Its Original Owner<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">ðŸ”Š</b></h2>
ðŸŽ§ Did you <span>manage</span> to give back those books you <span>borrowed</span> from <span>Steve</span>?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Yes, I <span>dropped</span> them off <span>yesterday</span>. He was really glad to get them back since some of them were first <span>editions</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>That's</span> <span>thoughtful</span>. <span>It's</span> important to <span>respect</span> other <span>people's</span> <span>belongings</span>, <span>especially</span> when they have <span>sentimental</span> <span>value</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Absolutely. I always make sure to <span>return</span> things in the <span>condition</span> I <span>received</span> them. <span>Giving</span> back what <span>isn't</span> <span>yours</span> is just the right thing to do.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Definitely. I <span>lent</span> a <span>rare</span> book to a friend once and never got it <span>backâ€”it</span> was <span>disheartening</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I can <span>imagine</span>. <span>That's</span> why I never <span>delay</span> <span>returning</span> things. It helps <span>avoid</span> <span>awkward</span> <span>situations</span> later on.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>True</span>, <span>it's</span> all about <span>maintaining</span> <span>trust</span>. <span>Speaking</span> of which, do you need any books? I just got a few new <span>onesâ€”you're</span> <span>welcome</span> to <span>borrow</span> them.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I might take you up on that! Thanks. <span>I'll</span> make sure to give them back as soon as <span>I'm</span> done.<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="eewe-2-">Flesh Out - Add More Details to Something to Make It More Complete<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">ðŸ”Š</b></h2>
ðŸŽ§ So, you <span>mentioned</span> <span>you're</span> working on a new <span>story</span> for that <span>writing</span> <span>competition</span>. <span>How's</span> it going?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>It's</span> going well, but <span>I'm</span> still trying to <span>flesh</span> out the <span>main</span> <span>characters</span>. I want them to be more than just <span>stereotypes</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>What's</span> the <span>story</span> about?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>It's</span> a <span>mystery</span> set in a small <span>coastal</span> <span>town</span>. The <span>main</span> <span>character</span> is a <span>retired</span> <span>detective</span> who <span>gets</span> <span>pulled</span> back into <span>solving</span> <span>crimes</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That sounds <span>intriguing</span>. To <span>flesh</span> out your <span>characters</span>, maybe you could give them <span>quirks</span> or <span>backstories</span> that <span>influence</span> how they <span>solve</span> <span>problems</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>That's</span> a good idea. <span>I've</span> been thinking about <span>giving</span> the <span>detective</span> a <span>reason</span> for <span>retiring</span> <span>early</span> that <span>ties</span> into the <span>main</span> <span>plot</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That could add a lot of <span>depth</span>. Maybe his last case went wrong, and this new case <span>somehow</span> <span>connects</span> to it.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I like that! It <span>ties</span> everything together and <span>gives</span> the <span>character</span> a personal <span>stake</span> in <span>solving</span> the <span>mystery</span>. Thanks for the <span>suggestion</span>.<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="eewe-2-">Light Up - Illuminate<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">ðŸ”Š</b></h2>
ðŸŽ§ Did you see the new <span>park</span> <span>renovations</span>? They did a great <span>job</span>, <span>especially</span> with the <span>lighting</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I haven't had the <span>chance</span> yet. What did they change?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>They've</span> <span>installed</span> these new <span>LED</span> <span>light</span> <span>paths</span> that <span>light</span> up <span>beautifully</span> at <span>night</span>. It <span>completely</span> <span>transforms</span> the place.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That sounds amazing! It must make the <span>park</span> look so different in the <span>evenings</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ It does, and it <span>feels</span> <span>safer</span> too. The whole <span>area</span> is well <span>illuminated</span>, which makes it perfect for <span>evening</span> <span>walks</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That's a <span>smart</span> <span>upgrade</span>. Good <span>lighting</span> can really <span>enhance</span> the <span>atmosphere</span> of a place.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Absolutely! And it's not just the <span>pathsâ€”they've</span> <span>added</span> <span>lights</span> to the <span>trees</span> and <span>benches</span> too. The <span>entire</span> <span>space</span> just <span>lights</span> up so well.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I'll have to check it out. Maybe we can go for a <span>walk</span> there this weekend.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Sounds like a plan! <span>You'll</span> love how it looks, <span>plus</span> <span>it's</span> a good way to enjoy the <span>outdoors</span> after <span>sunset</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Great! <span>I'm</span> looking forward to it. <span>It'll</span> be nice to see how the <span>lights</span> add to the <span>ambiance</span>.<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="eewe-2-">Shake Up - Make Significant Changes or Cause a Disturbance<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">ðŸ”Š</b></h2>
ðŸŽ§ Did you hear about the new <span>management</span> at <span>Jenna's</span> company? They're planning to really <span>shake</span> things up.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Really? I <span>hadn't</span> heard that. What kind of changes are they thinking about?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ From what <span>Jenna</span> told me, the new <span>CEO</span> <span>wants</span> to <span>restructure</span> <span>several</span> <span>departments</span> and <span>possibly</span> <span>introduce</span> <span>flexible</span> working hours. They're even <span>considering</span> <span>remote</span> work options.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That sounds like a big <span>shake-up</span>. Do you think <span>it'll</span> be good for the company in the long run?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ It could be. <span>Jenna</span> <span>seems</span> <span>optimistic</span>. She <span>thinks</span> the changes could <span>lead</span> to better <span>work-life</span> <span>balance</span> and might even <span>boost</span> <span>productivity</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ It's <span>interesting</span> how many <span>companies</span> are <span>switching</span> to these <span>kinds</span> of <span>policies</span> now. It must be a <span>challenge</span> to <span>implement</span>, but I <span>guess</span> <span>it's</span> <span>necessary</span> for <span>keeping</span> up with the <span>times</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Definitely. It's all about <span>adapting</span> to new <span>realities</span>. <span>Plus</span>, the <span>flexibility</span> could really help <span>attract</span> and <span>retain</span> <span>talented</span> <span>employees</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>True</span>. I wish our company would take some <span>notes</span>. <span>It'd</span> be nice to have more <span>flexible</span> working <span>conditions</span> here too.<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="eewe-2-">Mull Over - Think About Deeply or at Length<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">ðŸ”Š</b></h2>
ðŸŽ§ Have you <span>decided</span> on the <span>vacation</span> <span>spot</span> yet?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>I'm</span> still <span>mulling</span> over a <span>couple</span> of options. <span>It's</span> <span>hard</span> to choose between the <span>beach</span> <span>resort</span> and the <span>mountain</span> <span>cabin</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Both sound like great <span>choices</span>. <span>What's</span> <span>making</span> it <span>difficult</span> to decide?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Well, the <span>beach</span> is <span>ideal</span> for <span>relaxation</span>, and I love the <span>ocean</span>. But the <span>cabin</span> <span>offers</span> <span>solitude</span> and <span>hiking</span>, which I also enjoy.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Sounds like <span>you've</span> got some good options. Maybe think about what kind of <span>break</span> you really need right now.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>That's</span> good advice. <span>I've</span> been <span>mulling</span> over what would be more <span>refreshing</span>. The <span>beach</span> has the sun and <span>surf</span>, but the <span>mountains</span> might be <span>cooler</span> this time of year.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Maybe <span>consider</span> the <span>activities</span> each place <span>offers</span> and who you're going with. That might help <span>narrow</span> it down.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>True</span>. <span>I'll</span> take a <span>deeper</span> look at the <span>amenities</span> and <span>nearby</span> <span>attractions</span> for both. Thanks for <span>helping</span> me <span>sort</span> this out!<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Anytime</span>! Once <span>you've</span> <span>mulled</span> it over a bit more, let me know. <span>I'm</span> <span>excited</span> to hear about your <span>choice</span>.<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="eewe-2-">Tune Out - Stop Listening or Paying Attention<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">ðŸ”Š</b></h2>
ðŸŽ§ Did you go to the <span>town</span> <span>hall</span> <span>meeting</span> last <span>night</span>?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I did, but I have to <span>admit</span> I <span>tuned</span> out after the first <span>hour</span>. It was so long and <span>repetitive</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I know what you mean. They <span>tend</span> to <span>drag</span> on. Was anything important <span>discussed</span> before you <span>tuned</span> out?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Just the <span>usual</span> <span>updates</span> on <span>community</span> <span>projects</span>. They <span>spent</span> a lot of time on <span>budget</span> <span>allocations</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That can get <span>tedious</span>. Did they <span>mention</span> anything about the new <span>park</span> <span>proposal</span>?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ They did, but it was <span>buried</span> in so much other <span>stuff</span>. I think I <span>missed</span> some <span>details</span> when I <span>tuned</span> out.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ No <span>worries</span>. <span>I'll</span> check the <span>minutes</span> when <span>they're</span> <span>posted</span> online. <span>It's</span> <span>easier</span> to catch up that way.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Good idea. Next time, I might just read the <span>summary</span> <span>instead</span> of <span>attending</span> the whole <span>meeting</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Same here. <span>It's</span> <span>hard</span> to <span>stay</span> <span>focused</span> for that long.<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="eewe-2-">Gear Up - Prepare for an event or action<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">ðŸ”Š</b></h2>
ðŸŽ§ Are you getting <span>excited</span> about the <span>hiking</span> <span>trip</span> next weekend? I've <span>started</span> to <span>gear</span> up already.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Absolutely! I can't wait. I've been <span>checking</span> my <span>equipment</span> too. What all have you <span>prepared</span> so <span>far</span>?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I've got my <span>backpack</span> <span>sorted</span> out with the <span>essentials</span>: water <span>filter</span>, first <span>aid</span> <span>kit</span>, and <span>extra</span> <span>layers</span> in case it <span>gets</span> <span>cold</span>. I also <span>upgraded</span> my <span>hiking</span> <span>boots</span>. What about you?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I'm <span>focusing</span> on the <span>technical</span> <span>gear</span>. I just <span>picked</span> up a new <span>lightweight</span> <span>tent</span> and a better <span>sleeping</span> bag <span>suitable</span> for the <span>colder</span> <span>temperatures</span> we might <span>face</span> at <span>night</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Good call on the <span>sleeping</span> bag! It's <span>supposed</span> to <span>cool</span> down quite a bit. Have you thought about <span>meals</span>?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Yeah, I'm planning to <span>pack</span> <span>high-energy</span> <span>foods</span> like <span>nuts</span>, <span>dried</span> <span>fruits</span>, and <span>granola</span> <span>bars</span>. <span>Plus</span>, I'll <span>bring</span> some <span>dehydrated</span> <span>mealsâ€”just</span> add water.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Sounds like we're both well <span>prepared</span>. It's going to be an amazing <span>trip</span>. I'm glad we took the time to <span>properly</span> <span>gear</span> up.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Me too. A good <span>prep</span> can make all the <span>difference</span> out there. Can't wait to hit the <span>trail</span> with you!<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="eewe-2-">Jazz up - Make something more interesting or lively<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">ðŸ”Š</b></h2>
ðŸŽ§ Have you thought about how we can make the <span>party</span> more <span>exciting</span>?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Yeah, I think we need to <span>jazz</span> up the <span>decorations</span> a bit. The <span>current</span> <span>setup</span> <span>feels</span> too <span>plain</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I agree. How about <span>adding</span> some <span>string</span> <span>lights</span> and <span>colorful</span> <span>balloons</span>? That could make the <span>space</span> feel more <span>festive</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Good idea! We could also set up a <span>photo</span> <span>booth</span> with fun <span>props</span>. It'll give people something to do and <span>create</span> great <span>memories</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I love that! What about the music? Should we <span>create</span> a more <span>lively</span> <span>playlist</span>?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Definitely! A mix of <span>upbeat</span> <span>tracks</span> and some old <span>favorites</span> should get everyone <span>dancing</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Sounds perfect. Do you think we should have a <span>themed</span> <span>dress</span> <span>code</span> to add some <span>flair</span>?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That could be fun! Maybe a <span>retro</span> <span>themeâ€”it's</span> easy for people to <span>dress</span> up for and always looks great.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Retro</span> it is, then! This is going to be a <span>party</span> to remember!<br/>

ðŸŽ§ Have you <span>seen</span> the <span>decorations</span> <span>downtown</span>? They're really going all out for the <span>Centennial</span> <span>Celebration</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Yes, I <span>noticed</span> them <span>setting</span> up last <span>night</span>. It <span>seems</span> like it's going to be a <span>huge</span> <span>event</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Definitely. They're saying it's going to <span>usher</span> in a new <span>annual</span> <span>tradition</span>. If this <span>turns</span> out well, there will be a lot of <span>history</span> to <span>commemorate</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That would be wonderful. It's about time we had something <span>regular</span> to <span>bring</span> the <span>community</span> together. What's on the <span>agenda</span> for the <span>event</span>?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ There are <span>parades</span>, live music, and a lot of <span>local</span> food <span>vendors</span>, <span>plus</span> a <span>fireworks</span> show to cap off the <span>night</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Sounds like it's not just a <span>celebration</span>, but a <span>real</span> <span>boost</span> for <span>local</span> <span>businesses</span> too.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Absolutely! It's a <span>win-win</span> for everyone. I'm planning on spending the whole day there.<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="eewe-2-">Rush off - Leave in a hurry<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">ðŸ”Š</b></h2>
ðŸŽ§ Hey, are you still free to <span>grab</span> lunch today?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I was actually about to <span>text</span> you. I have to <span>rush</span> off to an <span>unexpected</span> <span>meeting</span> at <span>1</span> <span>p.m</span>. Can we <span>reschedule</span>?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ No <span>problem</span>. I <span>understand</span>. How about <span>tomorrow</span>? Does that work for you?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Tomorrow</span> should be perfect. I'm really sorry for the short <span>notice</span> today. It just came up, and I couldn't <span>push</span> it back.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ It's <span>totally</span> fine. I get it. We all have those <span>days</span>. Hope the <span>meeting</span> <span>goes</span> well.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Thanks, I <span>appreciate</span> it. It's about the new <span>project</span> <span>launch</span>, so it's <span>pretty</span> important.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Sounds like a big <span>deal</span>. Well, good <span>luck</span> with everything. Just let me know what time <span>works</span> for you <span>tomorrow</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Will do! I'll check my <span>schedule</span> and <span>confirm</span> by <span>tonight</span>. Thanks for being <span>flexible</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Of course! Catch up soon, and don't <span>rush</span> too much. Make sure to <span>grab</span> some lunch.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I will, thanks! Talk soon.<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="eewe-2-">Grind out - Produce in a mechanical unenthusiastic way<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">ðŸ”Š</b></h2>
ðŸŽ§ Hey, did you <span>finish</span> the <span>report</span> for the <span>meeting</span> <span>tomorrow</span>?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Yeah, I <span>managed</span> to <span>grind</span> it out last <span>night</span>. It wasn't my best work, but it's done.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I get it. Sometimes you just have to <span>push</span> through. What was the <span>toughest</span> <span>part</span>?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Honestly</span>, the <span>data</span> <span>analysis</span> was a <span>real</span> <span>headache</span>. I <span>felt</span> like I was just going through the <span>motions</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I can <span>relate</span>. When you're not <span>inspired</span>, it's <span>hard</span> to do more than just <span>grind</span> out the <span>task</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Exactly. I wish I had more time to really <span>dig</span> into it, but <span>deadlines</span> are <span>deadlines</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>True</span>. At <span>least</span> it's done. We can always <span>improve</span> it later if we need to.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That's a good <span>point</span>. Maybe we can <span>revisit</span> it next week when things are less <span>hectic</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Sounds like a plan. Let's focus on getting through the <span>meeting</span> first.<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="eewe-2-">Hold back - Restrain or keep from acting or knowing something<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">ðŸ”Š</b></h2>
ðŸŽ§ Have you told your <span>family</span> about your travel <span>plans</span> yet?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Not yet. I've been <span>holding</span> back because I'm not sure how they'll <span>react</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I get that. They might be <span>worried</span>, but it's important for them to know. When are you planning to leave?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Next month. I just don't want to <span>deal</span> with the <span>stress</span> of their <span>concerns</span> right now.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Understandable</span>. But <span>holding</span> back might make it <span>harder</span> in the long run. Maybe <span>ease</span> them into the idea.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ You're right. I'll probably start by <span>mentioning</span> the <span>benefits</span> of the <span>trip</span> and how I've <span>planned</span> everything out.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That sounds like a good <span>approach</span>. They might be more <span>supportive</span> if they see you've thought it through.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Exactly. I'll talk to them this weekend and try to <span>address</span> their <span>concerns</span> <span>upfront</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Good plan. It's better to be open about it. They'll <span>appreciate</span> your <span>honesty</span>.<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="eewe-2-">Use up - Consume all of something<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">ðŸ”Š</b></h2>
ðŸŽ§ Hey, do you know where the <span>rest</span> of the <span>printer</span> <span>ink</span> went? I was about to <span>print</span> some <span>documents</span>, and it looks like we're out.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Oh, I used up the last of it <span>yesterday</span>. There were a <span>ton</span> of <span>forms</span> I <span>needed</span> to <span>print</span> for the <span>meeting</span> next week. So sorry, I <span>forgot</span> to <span>mention</span> it.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ No <span>worries</span>, but we should probably order more soon. Do we have a <span>regular</span> <span>supplier</span>, or should I look for a <span>deal</span> online?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ We usually order from that online <span>office</span> <span>supply</span> <span>store</span>. They <span>deliver</span> <span>pretty</span> quickly. Maybe check if they have any <span>specials</span> on <span>ink</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Sounds good. I'll place an order today. How many <span>cartridges</span> should I get this time?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Maybe get a few <span>extra</span> just to <span>avoid</span> <span>running</span> out again soon, <span>especially</span> with the end of the <span>quarter</span> <span>coming</span> up.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Agreed. I'll order <span>several</span> to keep us <span>stocked</span> up. I'll also make sure to <span>track</span> the <span>ink</span> <span>levels</span> <span>regularly</span> now.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Great idea. Let me know if you need the <span>account</span> <span>details</span> for the <span>store</span>.<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="eewe-2-">Own up to - Admit or confess something<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">ðŸ”Š</b></h2>
ðŸŽ§ Did you see the <span>news</span> about the <span>project</span> <span>delay</span>?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Yeah, I did. <span>Apparently</span>, there were some issues with the planning.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I heard it was because <span>someone</span> <span>missed</span> a <span>crucial</span> <span>deadline</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Actually, I need to own up to that. I was the one who <span>missed</span> the <span>deadline</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Really? What <span>happened</span>?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I <span>underestimated</span> the time <span>needed</span> for one of the <span>tasks</span>, and it set everything back.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That's tough. It's good of you to own up to it, though. What are you going to do now?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I've already <span>spoken</span> to the <span>team</span>, and we're working on a plan to catch up.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That's a good <span>approach</span>. <span>Admitting</span> the <span>mistake</span> is the first <span>step</span> to <span>fixing</span> it.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Exactly. I just hope we can get back on <span>track</span> quickly.<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="eewe-2-">Dress up - Wear fancy or formal clothes<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">ðŸ”Š</b></h2>
ðŸŽ§ So, are you <span>excited</span> about the <span>charity</span> <span>gala</span> next weekend?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Definitely! I love any <span>excuse</span> to <span>dress</span> up, and this <span>event</span> sounds <span>fantastic</span>. Have you <span>decided</span> what you're going to <span>wear</span>?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I'm thinking about <span>wearing</span> that <span>black</span> <span>suit</span> I <span>bought</span> last year. It's been <span>hanging</span> in my <span>closet</span>, <span>waiting</span> for an <span>occasion</span> like this.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That sounds perfect for a <span>gala</span>! I <span>picked</span> out a <span>navy</span> <span>blue</span> <span>gown</span>. It's a bit more <span>formal</span> than what I usually <span>wear</span>, but it's nice to go all out sometimes.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Absolutely! It's not every day we get to <span>wear</span> something really <span>fancy</span>. <span>Plus</span>, it's for a good <span>cause</span>, so that makes it even better.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Right! The <span>funds</span> go to <span>local</span> <span>art</span> <span>programs</span>, right? It's great to <span>support</span> the <span>community</span> and have a fun <span>evening</span> out.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Exactly! It's a <span>win-win</span>. Looking forward to <span>seeing</span> everyone all <span>dressed</span> up and <span>enjoying</span> the <span>night</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Me too! It'll be a <span>night</span> to remember for sure.<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="eewe-2-">Wash up - Clean dishes, hands, etc.<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">ðŸ”Š</b></h2>
ðŸŽ§ Did you <span>finish</span> your lunch?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Yeah, just now. I'm about to <span>wash</span> up. The <span>kitchen</span> is a bit of a <span>mess</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you need any help with the <span>dishes</span>?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That would be great, thanks! There are a few <span>pots</span> and <span>pans</span> that need <span>scrubbing</span> too.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ No <span>problem</span>. I'll start with the <span>plates</span>. Did you <span>cook</span> something special today?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Just <span>tried</span> out a new <span>pasta</span> <span>recipe</span>. It <span>turned</span> out <span>pretty</span> <span>decent</span>. I <span>left</span> some in the pot if you want to try.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Sounds good! I'll definitely have a <span>taste</span>. <span>Pasta</span> <span>dishes</span> always make for an <span>easier</span> <span>cleanup</span>, <span>thankfully</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>True</span>. <span>Except</span> for the <span>saucepan</span>. That one might need a bit more <span>elbow</span> <span>grease</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Got it! I'll <span>handle</span> the <span>saucepan</span> then. It's nice to <span>team</span> up like this. Makes the <span>task</span> go <span>faster</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Absolutely! It's always better with some company. <span>Plus</span>, we can get to the <span>dessert</span> <span>quicker</span> this way.<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="eewe-2-">Fizzle out - Gradually end, usually in a disappointing way<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">ðŸ”Š</b></h2>
ðŸŽ§ Have you been <span>following</span> that new <span>TV</span> <span>series</span> that <span>started</span> last month?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Yes, I <span>started</span> watching it, but I haven't <span>caught</span> up on the <span>latest</span> <span>episodes</span>. How's it going?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Honestly</span>, it <span>started</span> off really <span>strong</span>, but the last <span>couple</span> of <span>episodes</span> just <span>seemed</span> to <span>fizzle</span> out.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That's <span>disappointing</span>. What <span>happened</span>?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ The <span>plot</span> just <span>lost</span> <span>momentum</span>. It <span>feels</span> like they're <span>dragging</span> the <span>story</span> out without much <span>happening</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I was <span>worried</span> that might <span>happen</span> after such a <span>dramatic</span> <span>opening</span>. Do you think it's <span>worth</span> <span>continuing</span>?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Maybe give it another <span>episode</span> or two. Sometimes <span>shows</span> have a <span>midseason</span> <span>slump</span> but <span>pick</span> up again <span>towards</span> the end.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>True</span>. I'll <span>stick</span> with it a bit <span>longer</span> then. It's a <span>shame</span> though. I had high <span>hopes</span> after the first few <span>episodes</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Same here. <span>Hopefully</span>, the <span>writers</span> <span>turn</span> things around. <span>Otherwise</span>, it's just another <span>series</span> that had <span>potential</span> but couldn't keep up the <span>pace</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I'll keep my <span>fingers</span> <span>crossed</span>. Maybe we can <span>discuss</span> it again once the <span>season</span> <span>wraps</span> up.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Sounds good. Let's hope for a <span>strong</span> <span>finish</span>.<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="eewe-2-">Tip off - secretly inform or warn someone<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">ðŸ”Š</b></h2>
ðŸŽ§ Hey! Just a <span>quick</span> <span>heads-upâ€”I</span> got <span>tipped</span> off that the <span>main</span> <span>road</span> is <span>completely</span> <span>jammed</span> because of the <span>marathon</span> today. You might want to take the back <span>streets</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Oh, really? That's a great tip, thanks! I had no idea there was a <span>marathon</span>. How did you find out?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ My <span>brother's</span> <span>part</span> of the <span>event</span> <span>organizing</span> <span>team</span>. He <span>sent</span> me a <span>message</span> <span>early</span> this morning so I could <span>avoid</span> the <span>area</span>. It's going to be <span>chaotic</span> all day.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Good to know. I'll <span>reroute</span> and go through <span>Elm</span> <span>Street</span> then. Did he <span>mention</span> anything about when it might <span>clear</span> up?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ He <span>expects</span> it'll be <span>busy</span> <span>till</span> <span>late</span> <span>afternoon</span>. Everything should be back to <span>normal</span> by <span>evening</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Perfect. I'll plan my day <span>accordingly</span>. I really <span>appreciate</span> the <span>warning</span>.<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="eewe-2-">Iron out - remove difficulties or find solutions to a problem<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">ðŸ”Š</b></h2>
ðŸŽ§ Have you made any <span>progress</span> with planning the <span>reunion</span>?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ A bit, but there are still a few issues we need to <span>iron</span> out before everything is set.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What kind of issues are you <span>facing</span>?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Mainly</span> with the <span>venue</span> and <span>catering</span>. The <span>original</span> <span>venue</span> is <span>double-booked</span>, and the <span>caterer</span> just <span>informed</span> us they're <span>unavailable</span> on our date.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That sounds <span>challenging</span>. Have you <span>found</span> any <span>alternatives</span>?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ We're looking into a <span>couple</span> of other <span>venues</span> <span>nearby</span>. As for <span>catering</span>, I'm thinking about <span>reaching</span> out to a few <span>local</span> <span>restaurants</span> to see if they can help.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That could work. If you need help <span>contacting</span> <span>places</span> or <span>negotiating</span>, let me know.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Thanks. I might take you up on that. <span>Hopefully</span>, we can <span>iron</span> out these <span>details</span> soon so we can focus on the fun <span>stuff</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ For sure. Once the <span>main</span> <span>logistics</span> are <span>settled</span>, the <span>rest</span> should <span>fall</span> into place.<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="eewe-2-">Queue up - line up or arrange in a queue<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">ðŸ”Š</b></h2>
ðŸŽ§ Did you <span>manage</span> to get <span>tickets</span> for the <span>concert</span> next month?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Yes! I had to <span>queue</span> up online right when they went on <span>sale</span>. The <span>website</span> was so <span>busy</span> I thought I might <span>miss</span> out.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That sounds <span>stressful</span>. I'm glad you got them, though. How long did you have to wait?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ It was about an <span>hour</span> of just <span>refreshing</span> the <span>page</span> and <span>waiting</span> in the <span>digital</span> <span>queue</span>. Everyone was trying to get the best <span>seats</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ An <span>hour</span>? That's <span>dedication</span>. I'm <span>impressed</span>. It must be a <span>popular</span> <span>band</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ They are, and it's their first <span>tour</span> after a long <span>break</span>, so the <span>tickets</span> were in high <span>demand</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ It'll be <span>worth</span> it, then. Who are you going with?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ A <span>couple</span> of friends from <span>college</span>. We used to listen to this <span>band</span> all the time back then. We <span>decided</span> to <span>queue</span> up for <span>tickets</span> together, even though we were all on different <span>computers</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Sounds like a <span>mini-reunion</span>. It's great that you all could <span>coordinate</span> like that.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Yeah, we're all looking forward to it. It should be a <span>memorable</span> <span>night</span>.<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="eewe-2-">Face up to - accept and deal with a difficult reality<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">ðŸ”Š</b></h2>
ðŸŽ§ Have you <span>talked</span> to your <span>landlord</span> about the <span>rent</span> <span>increase</span> yet?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Not yet. I've been trying to <span>avoid</span> it, but I know I need to <span>face</span> up to it soon.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ It's tough, but the <span>sooner</span> you <span>address</span> it, the better. What are your options?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I <span>guess</span> I could try <span>negotiating</span> a <span>smaller</span> <span>increase</span> or look for a <span>cheaper</span> place. <span>Neither</span> option is <span>ideal</span>, though.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Negotiating</span> might be <span>worth</span> a <span>shot</span>. Maybe your <span>landlord</span> would be <span>willing</span> to <span>compromise</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>True</span>. I'll need to <span>gather</span> some <span>information</span> first, like <span>rental</span> <span>prices</span> in the <span>area</span>, to make a <span>strong</span> case.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That sounds like a good plan. It <span>shows</span> you're serious and <span>informed</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Yeah, I just need to <span>face</span> up to the <span>conversation</span>. Once I do, I'll feel better about whatever <span>happens</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Exactly. It's always better to <span>confront</span> these things <span>head-on</span>. Let me know how it <span>goes</span>.<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="eewe-2-">Gear down - reduce in speed or intensity<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">ðŸ”Š</b></h2>
ðŸŽ§ I've been thinking about our <span>weekly</span> <span>routine</span>, and I feel like we might need to <span>gear</span> down a bit. It's been <span>non-stop</span> lately.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I agree. It's been quite <span>hectic</span> with all the <span>activities</span> and <span>commitments</span> we've <span>packed</span> into our <span>schedule</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ What if we <span>limit</span> our <span>evening</span> <span>engagements</span>? Maybe just one or two <span>nights</span> a week <span>instead</span> of almost every <span>night</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That sounds like a good plan. It would definitely help <span>reduce</span> the <span>overall</span> <span>rush</span> and give us more time to <span>relax</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Exactly. We could use that <span>extra</span> time at home to <span>unwind</span>, maybe read more or just enjoy some <span>quiet</span> <span>evenings</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I'd love that. It might also be nice to <span>spend</span> more time cooking together <span>instead</span> of always <span>grabbing</span> something on the go.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Perfect. Let's start this week. We can <span>pick</span> the <span>nights</span> we <span>stay</span> out <span>based</span> on what we really don't want to <span>miss</span> and keep the <span>rest</span> free.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I'm looking forward to this change. It'll be a nice <span>pace</span> <span>adjustment</span>.<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="eewe-2-">Ease into - gradually start or adjust to a new situation<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">ðŸ”Š</b></h2>
ðŸŽ§ I heard you <span>started</span> a new <span>job</span> <span>recently</span>. How's it going so <span>far</span>?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ It's going well, thanks. I'm trying to <span>ease</span> into the new <span>role</span>. It's a bit different from what I'm used to, but I'm getting the <span>hang</span> of it.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That's good to hear. What's the <span>biggest</span> <span>adjustment</span> you've had to make?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ The <span>pace</span> is much <span>faster</span> here. I'm used to a more <span>laid-back</span> <span>environment</span>, so I've been taking it one <span>step</span> at a time to keep up.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Sounds like a <span>smart</span> <span>approach</span>. Have your <span>colleagues</span> been <span>supportive</span>?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Yes, <span>they've</span> been great. <span>They've</span> <span>given</span> me <span>space</span> to <span>ease</span> into things and <span>offered</span> help <span>whenever</span> I need it.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That makes a big <span>difference</span>. Do you feel like you're <span>settling</span> in now?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Slowly</span> but <span>surely</span>. I think in a few more <span>weeks</span> I'll feel <span>fully</span> <span>comfortable</span> with everything.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That's good. It's important to take your time and not <span>rush</span> the <span>process</span>.<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="eewe-2-">Add up - makes sense<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">ðŸ”Š</b></h2>
ðŸŽ§ I just read about that new <span>tech</span> <span>startup</span>. Some of their <span>claims</span> <span>seem</span> a bit over the top, don't you think?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Yeah, I saw that too. Their <span>projected</span> <span>growth</span> <span>numbers..</span>. I'm not sure how they plan to <span>achieve</span> that so quickly.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Exactly. And their <span>business</span> <span>model</span> doesn't <span>fully</span> <span>explain</span> how they'll <span>sustain</span> such <span>rapid</span> <span>expansion</span>. Doesn't really add up to me.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Right. There might be some key <span>details</span> they haven't <span>disclosed</span> yet, or maybe it's just <span>optimistic</span> <span>forecasting</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That could be. Have you <span>looked</span> into their <span>funding</span>? That might give us a better idea of their <span>capabilities</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>They've</span> <span>secured</span> some <span>solid</span> <span>venture</span> <span>capital</span>, but even that doesn't <span>seem</span> enough for the <span>scale</span> they're talking about.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ It's a <span>puzzle</span>, isn't it? We should keep an eye on their next <span>moves</span>. It'll be <span>interesting</span> to see if they <span>adjust</span> their <span>strategy</span> once they hit the <span>market</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Definitely. Watching how new <span>startups</span> <span>navigate</span> these <span>challenges</span> is always <span>insightful</span>. We might even learn a thing or two for our own <span>projects</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Agreed. It's one thing to have a <span>vision;</span> <span>executing</span> it is a whole other <span>challenge</span>.<br/>

<h2 id="eewe-2-">Wear off - fade away<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">ðŸ”Š</b></h2>
ðŸŽ§ Have you <span>noticed</span> how quickly the <span>excitement</span> of <span>buying</span> something new <span>wears</span> off?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Absolutely. It's like one <span>moment</span> you're <span>thrilled</span>, and a week later, it just <span>fades</span> away. Same thing <span>happened</span> when I got my new phone.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Exactly. It's all <span>exciting</span> at first, but then it just <span>becomes</span> another thing you own. Do you think that's why people <span>shop</span> so much?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Probably. It's that <span>initial</span> <span>rush</span>. But it's <span>interesting</span> how the <span>novelty</span> <span>wears</span> off, but the <span>bills</span> don't <span>fade</span> away as quickly.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That's the <span>truth</span>. It makes you <span>wonder</span> if it's <span>worth</span> <span>chasing</span> those <span>moments</span> when the <span>thrill</span> is so <span>temporary</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Maybe it's better to find <span>excitement</span> in <span>experiences</span>, not things. Those <span>memories</span> don't <span>fade</span> away as <span>fast</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I agree. Next time, <span>instead</span> of <span>buying</span> the <span>latest</span> <span>gadget</span>, maybe I'll book a little <span>trip</span> somewhere.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Sounds like a plan. <span>Experiences</span> over <span>possessions</span>, right? They say that's the key to <span>happiness</span>.<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="eewe-2-">Latch onto - attach oneself to an idea or person<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">ðŸ”Š</b></h2>
ðŸŽ§ Have you <span>seen</span> the <span>latest</span> <span>documentary</span> on <span>climate</span> change?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Yes, I <span>watched</span> it last <span>night</span>. It was really <span>eye-opening</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I agree. It made me think a lot about our <span>habits</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Same here. I've <span>latched</span> <span>onto</span> the idea of <span>reducing</span> my <span>carbon</span> <span>footprint</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That's a great <span>initiative</span>. What changes are you planning to make?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I'm <span>starting</span> with simple things like <span>using</span> less <span>plastic</span> and <span>conserving</span> water.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Those are good <span>steps</span>. Have you thought about any <span>bigger</span> changes?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Yes, I'm <span>considering</span> <span>switching</span> to a <span>plant-based</span> <span>diet</span> and <span>using</span> <span>public</span> <span>transport</span> more often.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That's <span>impressive</span>. It's <span>inspiring</span> to see how you've <span>latched</span> <span>onto</span> these <span>ideas</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Thanks. I feel like if everyone made small changes, it could add up to a big <span>impact</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Absolutely. Every little bit helps. Maybe I should <span>latch</span> <span>onto</span> some of those <span>ideas</span> too.<br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="eewe-2-">Clear out - remove everything from a place<b class="speaker" onclick="startAudio(this)">ðŸ”Š</b></h2>
ðŸŽ§ Did you hear about the <span>renovation</span> they're planning for the old <span>library</span> <span>downtown</span>?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ No, I hadn't. What are they doing?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ They're going to <span>completely</span> <span>clear</span> out the inside to <span>modernize</span> it. New <span>furniture</span>, new <span>technology</span>, even a new <span>layout</span>. It's <span>supposed</span> to make the <span>space</span> more <span>usable</span> for <span>current</span> needs.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That sounds like a <span>massive</span> <span>project</span>. Are they <span>preserving</span> any of the old <span>features</span>?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ They plan to keep the <span>exterior</span> as is because of its <span>historical</span> <span>significance</span>, but inside it's going to be <span>totally</span> <span>transformed</span>. They want to <span>incorporate</span> more <span>community</span> <span>spaces</span> and <span>tech-friendly</span> <span>areas</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I <span>guess</span> that makes <span>sense</span>, <span>especially</span> to <span>attract</span> <span>younger</span> <span>crowds</span> and keep up with <span>digital</span> <span>trends</span>. How long will it be <span>closed</span>?<br/>
ðŸŽ§ It'll be <span>closed</span> for about a year. They need to <span>clear</span> out all the old <span>shelving</span> and <span>seating</span> first and then start with the <span>tech</span> <span>upgrades</span> and <span>reconfiguration</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ It's going to be <span>worth</span> it, though. Our <span>town</span> could really use a <span>space</span> that <span>caters</span> to a <span>wider</span> <span>audience</span> and <span>embraces</span> <span>modern</span> needs.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Absolutely. I'm looking forward to <span>seeing</span> how it <span>turns</span> out. It could really <span>rejuvenate</span> the <span>downtown</span> <span>area</span>.<br/>
