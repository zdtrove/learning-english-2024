🎧 Hello, Osaka Today Restaurant.<br />
🎧 How may I help you?<br />
🎧 Hi, I'd like to make a reservation for 3 for 6 o'clock this Saturday in the name of Josh Price.<br />
🎧 I'm afraid we're fully booked at that time.<br />
🎧 Could an earlier or later time suit you?<br />
🎧 I can fit you in at 5 or 7:30.<br />
🎧 Well, 5 o'clock is a bit early for dinner.<br />
🎧 Let's make it 7:30 then.<br />
🎧 I might have to get back to you because I'm not too sure.<br />
🎧 No problem, Mr. Price.<br />
🎧 Your table will be kept for 15 minutes.<br />
🎧 May I also have your phone number, please?<br />
<br />

🎧 Excuse me, do you have Paul Woodward's latest novel?<br />
🎧 Do you mean The Ebony Snowman?<br />
🎧 Yeah! Do you have it in hardcover?<br />
🎧 Sorry, the hardcover's been sold out for a while.<br />
🎧 But the paperback just came out this week, and we've got plenty.<br />
🎧 Oh, wow. It seems like everyone loves his books.<br />
🎧 Yeah! plus some big bloggers gave it great reviews,<br />
🎧 so it's been flying off the shelves.<br />
🎧 That's actually how I heard about it.<br />
🎧 Where can I find it?<br />
🎧 We're in the new releases section.<br />
🎧 Just head straight to the bestsellers section,<br />
🎧 and you'll find his books right after that.<br />
<br />

🎧 Good afternoon, Mr. Peters.<br />
🎧 Glad to see you made it back before the shop closed!<br />
🎧 Did the meeting with the district manager go well?<br />
🎧 I would say it went pretty well.<br />
🎧 I was surprised that she made a couple of suggestions for how we can increase the sales at our store.<br />
🎧 Hmm... interesting.<br />
🎧 I thought our sales were pretty high.<br />
🎧 What suggestions did she make?<br />
🎧 She would like us to highlight our sale items in the front window.<br />
🎧 As you know, once a T-shirt or a pair of trousers are reduced,<br />
🎧 it moves to the back of the store in the sale section.<br />
🎧 She is concerned our customers don't know about this part of the store.<br />
🎧 Oh, I never thought of that.<br />
🎧 I can begin working on the displays right now.<br />
🎧 That would be great, thank you.<br />
🎧 Don't forget, we never put our top selling items on sale,<br />
🎧 so you don't need to make a sign for that.<br />
🎧 Sarah is almost finished cashing out that customer,<br />
🎧 so I will have her assist you when she's finished.<br />

🎧 Hilary, are you able to help me out?<br />
🎧 My computer keeps disconnecting from the wifi and I don't know what to do.<br />
🎧 Normally, I will Google whatever the problem is, but I can't even do that!<br />
🎧 Ah, I'm sorry Steve.<br />
🎧 I'm on my way to lunch with a client and already running late.<br />
🎧 I won't be back for about two hours,<br />
🎧 but I can try to help you then.<br />
🎧 Andrew helped me with my computer yesterday,<br />
🎧 maybe he is available now.<br />
🎧 Hmm... I can't wait that long.<br />
🎧 I have a lot of work to get done this morning and afternoon.<br />
🎧 I will walk down to the technology department and see if he is available to help me.<br />
🎧 That's a better idea.<br />
🎧 Good luck!<br />

🎧 Have you two taken a look at the progress they've made upstairs on the office expansion?<br />
🎧 It looks great!<br />
🎧 I know!<br />
🎧 I can't believe it!<br />
🎧 And the offices up there have amazing views of the city.<br />
🎧 I wonder which division will move up there when it's finished.<br />
🎧 I heard it's the research department.<br />
🎧 Ah, because they have the most people.<br />
🎧 Probably.<br />
🎧 I'd love to have an office on that floor, though.<br />
🎧 Yeah.<br />
🎧 Well, the company must be making good money if they're adding that space!<br />
🎧 I think you're right, there!<br />

🎧 Hey, Caroline.<br />
🎧 I hear your agency is managing the largest luxury condo complex yet.<br />
🎧 How's the presale going?<br />
🎧 You mean Albert Park?<br />
🎧 Yeah, homes are just flying off the shelf.<br />
🎧 I'm surprised there's been so much interest in this residential development.<br />
🎧 That's true, considering the hefty price tag.<br />
🎧 But actually, my wife and I are interested since this condo complex is brand new and so close to everything.<br />
🎧 Oh, really?<br />
🎧 We're doing a special promotion.<br />
🎧 If you buy a unit, you get the maximum level of protection for your new home<br />
🎧 thanks to our extended new home warranty.<br />
🎧 That's fantastic!<br />
🎧 Could you tell me more about the proposed amenities?<br />
🎧 Sure, I'd be happy to give you a brochure.<br />
🎧 Hold on... It's in my car.<br />

🎧 Hello, I bought a laptop here a while back.<br />
🎧 Recently, I've been having major battery life issues.<br />
🎧 A full charge used to last about 5 hours,<br />
🎧 but now my laptop runs out of charge rapidly.<br />
🎧 Umm... This is SuperPad 4.<br />
🎧 Did you apply the latest firmware and driver updates?<br />
🎧 Yeah, back in September, if my memory serves me right.<br />
🎧 Well, this particular firmware update was supposed to enhance battery performance,<br />
🎧 but ever since the recent September update,<br />
🎧 many people have complained about a battery drain of 20%<br />
🎧 even when the machine is turned off.<br />
🎧 That's a real curveball.<br />
🎧 I know battery performance is not covered by the warranty the same way other components are.<br />
🎧 So what would be my best course of action for now?<br />
🎧 Well, you just have to wait until the company rolls out new updates.<br />
🎧 The tech giant is said to be working on a solution.<br />
<br />

🎧 Sharon, how was the feedback on our new mascaras?<br />
🎧 Did we stand out from other brands?<br />
🎧 The product has been a success overall.<br />
🎧 However, we did receive a number of complaints from the customers<br />
🎧 saying that the product didn't live up to their expectations.<br />
🎧 In what aspects exactly?<br />
🎧 Most complaints are about the products not being clearly labeled.<br />
🎧 The consumers feel cheated<br />
🎧 because our mascaras boast an organic formula,<br />
🎧 when, in fact, only a small part of the ingredients are.<br />
🎧 I think we should arrange a discussion with the graphic designers and our product development teams.<br />
🎧 For sure.<br />
🎧 We should come up with a solution to the problem as soon as possible.<br />
🎧 I'll reserve the boardroom for tomorrow morning right away.<br />
<br />

🎧 Hello, there.<br />
🎧 Your shop is having a year-end closeout sale this month, right?<br />
🎧 I saw the advertisement on the Internet.<br />
🎧 I'm curious, though, does the sale apply to all the products on display?<br />
🎧 Certainly, they are all 60% off the retail price.<br />
🎧 Today only, if you have a Wsun Bank's credit card,<br />
🎧 you can get an extra 5% off just by using the bank's credit card.<br />
🎧 Actually, I do, but I left it at the office.<br />
🎧 I'd better run now,<br />
🎧 but I'm definitely coming back to get the extra discount.<br />
