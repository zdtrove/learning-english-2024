🎧 Hi, I'd like to order a large "Super Supreme" pizza<br />
🎧 and a small double pepperoni pizza with extra cheese<br />
🎧 and extra jalapeno peppers on both.<br />
🎧 I want both pizzas to go, by the way.<br />
🎧 I'm sorry. The "Super Supreme" pizza is a specialty offered in certain outlets only.<br />
🎧 Would you like to try our new stuffed crust pizza instead?<br />
🎧 You may choose up to five toppings for just 17.99.<br />
🎧 Thanks, but I've been meaning to try this specialty pizza for a while.<br />
🎧 Could you point me to another outlet that serves it?<br />
🎧 I live just outside Steveston Village.<br />
🎧 No problem. Hold on...<br />
🎧 uhh, the nearest branch for you is on Moncton Street.<br />
🎧 You might want to call the place first at 888-555-7625.<br />
🎧 Better act quickly.<br />
🎧 I heard this outlet sells out fast.<br />

🎧 Good morning, am I speaking with Rick Rows?<br />
🎧 I'm Geri Calwell, from the head office.<br />
🎧 I am still waiting for the expense reports from January.<br />
🎧 The deadline for the reports is always on the 15th of the next month,<br />
🎧 so I was wondering if something came up?<br />
🎧 Hi, Geri. I'm sorry about that,<br />
🎧 but I actually sent them off on the 12th using the interoffice mail.<br />
🎧 I even remember placing them in the outgoing tray.<br />
🎧 That's bizarre.<br />
🎧 Hmm... Yeah, this has never happened before.<br />
🎧 I will double check with the other departments<br />
🎧 as maybe they got delivered somewhere else in the building.<br />
🎧 Just in case, can you email me the reports as soon as possible?<br />
🎧 I need to work on the report this afternoon,<br />
🎧 so I will need a digital copy, just this once.<br />
🎧 I actually have a meeting at the head office in about an hour.<br />
🎧 I can quickly print another report and drop it off to your office before my meeting, if that suits you?<br />
🎧 Yeah, that would be great.<br />
🎧 I am on the fourth floor, office 402.<br />
🎧 If for some reason I'm not in my office,<br />
🎧 please leave it on my desk.<br />

🎧 Good afternoon, Ms. Laws.<br />
🎧 I'm Alex Jones, and my position is Head of People here at J.P. Bank.<br />
🎧 I know you recently had an interview with the head of the Canal branch,<br />
🎧 and he was very impressed.<br />
🎧 I'm calling today to offer you the job.<br />
🎧 Wow, thank you!<br />
🎧 I am very excited,<br />
🎧 but I am currently still working,<br />
🎧 so I need to resign, which I can do today.<br />
🎧 When did you want me to start?<br />
🎧 Well, as we mentioned in your interview,<br />
🎧 we were hoping the successful candidate would be able to start next week.<br />
🎧 The branch manager said he would make a special exception for you,<br />
🎧 as he thinks you would be a great team member.<br />
🎧 We can extend the start date by an additional week,<br />
🎧 so, two weeks from today.<br />
🎧 I think I can make that work,<br />
🎧 but I should check with my line manager.<br />
🎧 I have been treated well by my current company,<br />
🎧 so I don't want to leave them high and dry.<br />
🎧 I am very excited to move.<br />
🎧 How should I contact you after I speak with my manager?<br />

🎧 Hi George, we really need to figure out a strategic communications campaign for our new jeans line.<br />
🎧 I agree.<br />
🎧 The line has been completed and we are ready to release it,<br />
🎧 so the time has come to hire a public relations agency to oversee the launch.<br />
🎧 I agree, but our budget for advertising is very low for this project.<br />
🎧 I am a little bit stressed that we won't be able to afford a company.<br />
🎧 Have you reached out to any agencies that are near us for an estimate?<br />
🎧 I have worked with an agency called Watergate in the past,<br />
🎧 and I remember they were very cost-effective.<br />
🎧 The agency did a great job, do you remember, Daniel?<br />
🎧 I remember working with them on a lipstick launch.<br />
🎧 They were a great match.<br />
🎧 Oh, fantastic!<br />
🎧 I will reach out to them to see if we can arrange a meeting.<br />
🎧 Thanks, guys!<br />

🎧 Can you help me order a new office chair for the new assistant?<br />
🎧 No problem.<br />
🎧 Do you want me to take a look at the catalog?<br />
🎧 It has chairs that swivel and turn and the ones that tilt back and forward.<br />
🎧 That won't be necessary.<br />
🎧 Just order an office chair that will allow her to adjust the height and comfort level.<br />
🎧 Hmm... Also, keep in mind that our budget per chair is $70 maximum.<br />
🎧 Well, in that case, I think we need to contact a new supplier.<br />
🎧 Our current vendor has raised its prices.<br />
🎧 Really? Do you have someone in mind?<br />
🎧 Yeah, a potential supplier just sent us a catalog a few days ago.<br />
🎧 I'll take a look at the prices and place your order.<br />

🎧 Hey, James, let's go see the musical play Spear Of Hope while we're in New York.<br />
🎧 Sounds good.<br />
🎧 I read a rave review of the play in the paper last week.<br />
🎧 It is said that the staging and costumes are really something to see.<br />
🎧 I think we should buy tickets in advance.<br />
🎧 Good idea.<br />
🎧 I have a PhantomSeat member account,<br />
🎧 so if I book online on this website,<br />
🎧 I can get a maximum of two tickets at a discount price.<br />
🎧 So when do you think we should go?<br />
🎧 It is your call.<br />
🎧 I wonder if the price is cheaper on weekdays.<br />
🎧 I guess so.<br />
🎧 Let me check the website...<br />
🎧 Hmm, it seems like the price is a bit more expensive on weekends.<br />
🎧 Say we go on Thursday at 8 P.M.<br />
🎧 Does that work for you?<br />
🎧 That works.<br />
🎧 We could probably grab a bite to eat before the show.<br />
🎧 Could you book the tickets for us?<br />
🎧 Sounds good to me.<br />
🎧 I'll go get my credit card.<br />

🎧 Good morning.<br />
🎧 I saw on the University's online job board that you were looking to hire a student receptionist.<br />
🎧 Have you filled the position?<br />
🎧 Hi, there.<br />
🎧 We haven't filled the position, but have begun looking over applications.<br />
🎧 We plan to conduct the interviews beginning on Monday.<br />
🎧 Would you like to fill out an application?<br />
🎧 Well, I am very interested,<br />
🎧 but I am taking the maximum amount of credit hours.<br />
🎧 Does the job guarantee flexibility?<br />
🎧 I am concerned that with twenty credit hours, I may not be available as much as the job requires.<br />
🎧 There's some flexibility involved,<br />
🎧 and occasionally, we hire two students to fill one role if it works with their class schedule.<br />
🎧 Please attach a copy of this semester's class schedule to your application.<br />
🎧 This way we can determine the optimal workload for you.<br />

🎧 Do you know how many people have signed up for our marketing conference at the hotel next week?<br />
🎧 So far we have 50 attendees,<br />
🎧 but people are still signing up.<br />
🎧 Yesterday, we had 10 new registrations.<br />
HDR Do you want to see the list of people who have paid?<br />
🎧 I have to jump on a conference call in five minutes, so I don't have time right now.<br />
🎧 Will you just email me an updated list at the end of the day?<br />
🎧 No problem.<br />
🎧 I also keep a list of people who signed up for our monthly newsletter,<br />
🎧 so I will highlight names of people who haven't signed up,<br />
🎧 maybe we should reach out to them personally.<br />

🎧 Thanks for the tour, Janice.<br />
🎧 The townhouse is conveniently located, and the neighborhood is fairly safe.<br />
🎧 I'm curious, though.<br />
🎧 Do you help arrange mortgages with any banks?<br />
🎧 I know I want the principal and interest payments to be predictable.<br />
🎧 Certainly.<br />
🎧 This brochure here lists all the banking partners that our agency has been working closely with.<br />
🎧 And a word of advice,<br />
🎧 a down payment of 20% or more will help you get a lower interest rate.<br />
🎧 Thanks!<br />
🎧 I'll take a look at it.<br />
🎧 Hopefully, I'm eligible to apply for a home loan.<br />
🎧 My pleasure.<br />
🎧 Please feel free to contact me for any further information.<br />
🎧 You can reach me at my office number.<br />
