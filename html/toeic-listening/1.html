🎧 Good morning, Jack.<br />
🎧 Can you do me a favor and photocopy these documents for me, please?<br />
🎧 I need them for the staff meeting tomorrow morning.<br />
🎧 There will be fifteen attendees.<br />
🎧 Hi, Grace.<br />
🎧 Unfortunately, the copy machine is out of order.<br />
🎧 The repairman is supposed to come this afternoon to take a look,<br />
🎧 but this is the second time it's broken down in the past two weeks,<br />
🎧 so it might not be fixable.<br />
🎧 Oh no. I need the copies by 7:30 AM to prepare the folders for the meeting.<br />
🎧 Could you run over to our branch in Marple?<br />
🎧 It's only a 10-minute drive.<br />
🎧 I just need to make sure I'm prepared for this meeting.<br />
🎧 Yeah, I can do that.<br />
🎧 I actually did my training at the Marple office, so I'm familiar with it.<br />
🎧 I can leave right now.<br />
🎧 Are these all the documents you need?<br />
<br />

🎧 Have you checked your email?<br />
🎧 It looks like Antonio Garks is going to take over as production manager at our factory in Vietnam<br />
🎧 while Susan Carter is out on maternity leave.<br />
🎧 The post lasts six months.<br />
🎧 Wow, I haven't seen that email yet.<br />
🎧 Did the email say when he was flying out?<br />
🎧 Not for a few months, at the beginning of January.<br />
🎧 Well the project in Southampton won't be finished by January.<br />
🎧 I wonder who will fill his position there.<br />
🎧 The email didn't say, so I'm assuming they haven't made that decision.<br />
🎧 I personally think that Jesse Key would excel in that position.<br />
🎧 I agree.<br />
🎧 She is very good at jumping in a situation and making it her own.<br />
🎧 It would be a great test, as she hasn't worked on a project of this size before.<br />
🎧 She has done a great job,<br />
🎧 but I am not sure if she is quite ready for this challenge.<br />
🎧 I guess we will see how things progress.<br />
🎧 The email also said upper management will be holding a meeting about this subject tomorrow,<br />
🎧 and they ask you to RSVP, so be sure to respond.<br />
<br />

🎧 Hi, I'm Demi Geard.<br />
🎧 Is Mrs. Hayley in?<br />
🎧 I'm one of her clients.<br />
🎧 Mrs. Hayley is traveling abroad until the end of next week.<br />
🎧 Is it urgent?<br />
🎧 I can try to reach her at the resort.<br />
🎧 No need for that.<br />
🎧 I just came by to drop off these documents she asked me to sign.<br />
🎧 Can I leave them with you?<br />
🎧 Sure, no problem!<br />
🎧 I'll let her know you dropped them off and give them to her when she returns.<br />
🎧 Here's a post-it, can you write down what it's about so she knows?<br />
🎧 Sure, I'll do that.<br />
<br />

🎧 Hi, I'm calling to get an update on a claim I filed.<br />
🎧 It's for an emergency dental surgery I had while on vacation.<br />
🎧 Sure, I can help with that.<br />
🎧 Do you remember when you submitted the claim?<br />
🎧 I filed it on December 27th, so about a month ago.<br />
🎧 I see.<br />
🎧 Normally, it takes about six weeks to resolve,<br />
🎧 but because of the holidays, it might take up to eight weeks.<br />
🎧 Can you give me the 8-digit reference number?<br />
🎧 I'll get back to you within 72 hours with an update.<br />

🎧 Good afternoon, this is Harry Stills.<br />
🎧 I'm calling regarding a delivery I was expecting.<br />
🎧 I placed an order for a computer yesterday and paid for the expedited shipping.<br />
🎧 It was supposed to be here by noon,<br />
🎧 but here we are, two hours later, and I am still waiting.<br />
🎧 I'm sorry about that.<br />
🎧 The delivery crew actually just called us to let us know he had a flat tire<br />
🎧 and was running behind on his deliveries.<br />
🎧 He is back on the road and should arrive in the next thirty minutes.<br />
🎧 Are you sure?<br />
🎧 I have to leave in forty minutes for an appointment,<br />
🎧 so I need to make sure I have it before then.<br />
🎧 I understand.<br />
🎧 I will call him right now and ask him to make sure you are the first stop he makes in the neighborhood.<br />
🎧 I want to apologize for the delay.<br />

🎧 and it's going to take ages to get our luggage sorted.<br />

🎧 I just got the invitation to the workshop on Monday.<br />
🎧 It seems very interesting,<br />
🎧 the topic is "Designing for the minimalist".<br />
🎧 Do you think you will go?<br />
🎧 Oh, that does sound very interesting.<br />
🎧 I'm seeing a trend in minimalism design with my clients.<br />
🎧 I haven't checked my email,<br />
🎧 what time is the workshop?<br />
🎧 I have a presentation on Tuesday, so I am pretty busy until then.<br />
🎧 It starts at 9 A.M.<br />
🎧 And is scheduled to last for an hour.<br />
🎧 The email also mentioned free coffee and donuts.<br />
🎧 Luckily, it is a small workshop,<br />
🎧 so will be held in the meeting room next to your office.<br />
🎧 They said there will be a few hands-on events.<br />
🎧 Can I do anything to help you out with your presentation?<br />
🎧 Well, if it is only an hour, I should be able to attend.<br />
🎧 It is a good way to start my busy day!<br />
🎧 Thanks for letting me know.<br />

🎧 Hello, this is Tom Barron.<br />
🎧 I have an appointment with Dr. Coleman at 4 PM tomorrow,<br />
🎧 but my head has been pounding since yesterday.<br />
🎧 Could you schedule me for this afternoon instead?<br />
🎧 I'm sorry, but Dr. Coleman is out of town for personal reasons.<br />
🎧 The earliest we can schedule you is 8 AM tomorrow.<br />
🎧 I don't think I can wait until tomorrow.<br />
🎧 That's why I called in the first place.<br />
🎧 If you don't mind, Dr. Roberto is available.<br />
🎧 He's our on-call doctor and can see patients.<br />
🎧 There's an opening at 2 PM today.<br />
🎧 Would you like to see him?<br />

🎧 Hi, this is Christina.<br />
🎧 I bought a pair of dress shoes from your online store,<br />
🎧 but they're too tight because I got narrow width instead of medium.<br />
🎧 What can I do?<br />
🎧 Sorry about that.<br />
🎧 Shoes do stretch with wear,<br />
🎧 but you can return them by mail or at one of our outlets.<br />
🎧 Driving across town is too much hassle for me.<br />
🎧 How do I return them by mail?<br />
🎧 Just fill out the exchange form on the packing slip,<br />
🎧 attach a shipping label,<br />
🎧 and mail them back in the original packaging.<br />
<br />

🎧 Hello, this is Julie Burton.<br />
🎧 I rented a car from your shop.<br />
🎧 However, I just found a tear in the driver's seat.<br />
🎧 I didn't notice it when I picked up the rental vehicle this morning.<br />
🎧 So I'm a bit concerned about whether I might have to pay for any repairs.<br />
🎧 Well, not to worry, Mrs. Burton.<br />
🎧 According to our database,<br />
🎧 your insurance package covers any damage to the vehicle,<br />
🎧 so it will reimburse the expenses if needed.<br />
🎧 That's great news.<br />
🎧 One quick question, though,<br />
🎧 do I need to top off the tank when I return the car tomorrow?<br />
🎧 Yes, please.<br />
🎧 By the way, there will be some paperwork to get through,<br />
🎧 so please give yourself enough time.<br />
