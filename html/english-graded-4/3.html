🎧 Every day, Bonnie would find herself drawn to her phone like a moth to a flame.<br />
🎧 She couldn't help but compare herself to the smiling faces and seemingly perfect existences that filled her screen, feeling inadequate in their shadow.<br />
🎧 As she scrolled through picture-perfect moments, doubts gnawed at her confidence like termites in old wood.<br />

🎧 Bonnie made a choice - to break free from the chains of comparison.<br />
🎧 She unfollowed accounts that made her feel inadequate and started to focus on the things that truly brought her joy - painting, writing, and spending time with loved ones.<br />
