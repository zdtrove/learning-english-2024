🎧 I've <span>discovered</span> a <span>fantastic</span> and <span>entertaining</span> way to <span>sharpen</span> my English, <span>engaging</span> in English <span>quizzes</span> and <span>games</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Quizzes</span> and <span>games</span>, you say, like <span>battling</span> in a <span>spelling</span> bee <span>dressed</span> as a bee? <br/> 
🎧 Not exactly <span>dressing</span> up, but <span>close</span>. There's this <span>app</span> where you <span>solve</span> <span>puzzles</span> and <span>riddles</span> <span>entirely</span> in English. <span>Last</span> week, I <span>defused</span> a <span>virtual</span> <span>bomb</span> by <span>correctly</span> <span>answering</span> <span>grammar</span> <span>questions</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Defusing</span> <span>bombs</span> with <span>grammar</span>? <span>Talk</span> about high <span>stakes</span>. What <span>happens</span> if you mix up there and their? <br/> 
🎧 <span>Then</span> it's game over. <span>Literally</span>. But there's more. We also had a <span>team</span> <span>quiz</span> <span>night</span>. My <span>favorite</span> <span>round</span> was English <span>karaoke</span>, where you <span>fill</span> in the <span>missing</span> <span>lyrics</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Karaoke</span>? I hope no <span>virtual</span> <span>bombs</span> there, just <span>explosive</span> <span>laughter</span>. <span>Count</span> me in for the next <span>round</span>! <br/> 
🎧 <span>Definitely</span>. And next <span>month</span> they're <span>launching</span> a <span>detective</span> game where we <span>solve</span> <span>mysteries</span> by <span>completing</span> <span>language</span> <span>tasks</span>. <span>Imagine</span> <span>hunting</span> <span>clues</span> by <span>conjugating</span> <span>verbs</span>. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Sherlock</span> <span>Holmes</span> in the <span>land</span> of <span>linguistics</span>? This is the kind of <span>adventure</span> I need to <span>improve</span> my English. <span>Sign</span> me up, <span>Watson

🎧 Hey, I'm really <span>excited</span> about our <span>upcoming</span> <span>cruise</span>. It's my first time. Do you have any <span>tips</span> or advice? <br/> 
🎧 Absolutely. I've been on a few <span>cruises</span>. First, <span>pack</span> <span>light</span> but don't <span>forget</span> <span>formal</span> <span>wear</span> for dinner <span>nights</span>. Also, <span>seasickness</span> can be a thing, so maybe <span>bring</span> some <span>medication</span> just in case. <br/> 
🎧 Good to know. What about on <span>board</span> <span>activities</span>? Should we book them in <span>advance</span>? <br/> 
🎧 <span>Definitely</span>. <span>Popular</span> <span>activities</span> and <span>excursions</span> can <span>fill</span> up <span>fast</span>. And <span>download</span> the <span>cruise</span> <span>line's</span> <span>app</span> if they have one. It's really <span>handy</span> for <span>schedules</span> and <span>bookings</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Oh, that sounds <span>useful</span>. How about <span>dining</span>? Are there any <span>must-try</span> <span>restaurants</span>? <br/> 
🎧 <span>Each</span> <span>ship</span> usually has its <span>specialties</span>. Try to <span>experience</span> both the <span>buffet</span> and <span>sit-down</span> <span>restaurants</span>. And don't <span>miss</span> the <span>midnight</span> <span>buffet</span>. It's a <span>cruise</span> <span>classic</span>. <br/> 
🎧 This is all great advice. Thanks. I can't wait for our <span>trip</span>. <br/> 
🎧 You're going to have a <span>blast</span>. <span>Cruises</span> are a <span>world</span> of their own. <span>Enjoy

🎧 Hey, have you <span>seen</span> my <span>watch</span> <span>anywhere</span>? <br/> 
🎧 Your <span>watch</span>? No, I haven't. When did you last have it? <br/> 
🎧 I think I had it on this morning before <span>leaving</span> for work. I've <span>checked</span> <span>everywhere</span>, but it's <span>nowhere</span> to be <span>found</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Did you check the <span>bathroom</span>? Sometimes things get <span>left</span> there. <br/> 
🎧 Yeah, I <span>looked</span> there already. It's not there either. <br/> 
🎧 <span>Hmm</span>, maybe it <span>fell</span> off while you were <span>walking</span> or something. Have you <span>retraced</span> your <span>steps</span>? <br/> 
🎧 Yeah, I <span>walked</span> the same <span>route</span> back home, but no <span>luck</span>. <br/> 
🎧 That's <span>frustrating</span>. Do you <span>remember</span> if you had it when we were at the <span>cafe</span>? <br/> 
🎧 I can't <span>recall</span>, but I'll give them a <span>call</span> just to be sure. <br/> 
🎧 Good idea. <span>Hopefully</span>, they <span>found</span> it. If not, maybe it'll <span>turn</span> up somewhere <span>unexpected</span>. <br/>

🎧 Yeah, I could definitely go for something to eat too. <br/> 
🎧 Any <span>ideas</span> on what you want? <br/>

🎧 Great. Any <span>preferences</span> on <span>toppings</span>? <br/> 
🎧 I'm good with anything as long as there's no <span>pineapple</span>. <br/> 
🎧 Agreed. How about <span>pepperoni</span> and <span>mushrooms</span>? <br/> 
🎧 <span>Perfect</span>. Let's <span>order</span> that. <br/>

🎧 I've been thinking about <span>giving</span> it a try, but I'm not sure where to start.<br/>
🎧 You should definitely give it a <span>shot</span>. <span>Yoga</span> is great for <span>relaxation</span> and <span>flexibility</span>. You can start with some <span>beginner</span> <span>videos</span> online.<br/>
🎧 That sounds like a good idea. Do you have any <span>recommendations</span> for a <span>beginner</span> like me?<br/>
