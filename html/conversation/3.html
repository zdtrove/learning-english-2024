🎧 I've <span>discovered</span> a <span>fantastic</span> and <span>entertaining</span> way to <span>sharpen</span> my <span>English</span>, <span>engaging</span> in <span>English</span> <span>quizzes</span> and <span>games</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Quizzes</span> and <span>games</span>, you say, like <span>battling</span> in a <span>spelling</span> bee <span>dressed</span> as a bee? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 Not <span>exactly</span> <span>dressing</span> up, but <span>close</span>. There's this <span>app</span> where you <span>solve</span> <span>puzzles</span> and <span>riddles</span> <span>entirely</span> in <span>English</span>. <span>Last</span> <span>week</span>, I <span>diffused</span> a <span>virtual</span> <span>bomb</span> by <span>correctly</span> <span>answering</span> <span>grammar</span> <span>questions</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Diffusing</span> <span>bombs</span> with <span>grammar</span>? <span>Talk</span> about high <span>stakes</span>. What <span>happens</span> if you mix up there and their? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Then</span> it's game over. <span>Literally</span>. But there's more. We also had a <span>team</span> <span>quiz</span> <span>night</span>. My <span>favorite</span> <span>round</span> was <span>English</span> <span>karaoke</span>, where you <span>fill</span> in the <span>missing</span> <span>lyrics</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Karaoke</span>? I hope no <span>virtual</span> <span>bombs</span> there, just <span>explosive</span> <span>laughter</span>. <span>Count</span> me in for the next <span>round</span>! <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Definitely</span>. And next <span>month</span> they're <span>launching</span> a <span>detective</span> game where we <span>solve</span> <span>mysteries</span> by <span>completing</span> <span>language</span> <span>tasks</span>. <span>Imagine</span> <span>hunting</span> <span>clues</span> by <span>conjugating</span> <span>verbs</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Sherlock</span> <span>Holmes</span> in the <span>land</span> of <span>linguistics</span>? This is the kind of <span>adventure</span> I need to <span>improve</span> my <span>English</span>. <span>Sign</span> me up, <span>Watson!<br/>

🎧 <span>Absolutely</span>. I've been on a few <span>cruises</span>. <span>First</span>, <span>pack</span> <span>light</span> but don't <span>forget</span> <span>formal</span> <span>wear</span> for <span>dinner</span> <span>nights</span>. Also, <span>seasickness</span> can be a <span>thing</span>, so <span>maybe</span> <span>bring</span> some <span>medication</span> just in case. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Good</span> to know. What about on <span>board</span> <span>activities</span>? <span>Should</span> we book them in <span>advance</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Definitely</span>. <span>Popular</span> <span>activities</span> and <span>excursions</span> can <span>fill</span> up <span>fast</span>. And <span>download</span> the <span>cruise</span> <span>line's</span> <span>app</span> if they have one. It's <span>really</span> <span>handy</span> for <span>schedules</span> and <span>bookings</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span>, that <span>sounds</span> <span>useful</span>. How about <span>dining</span>? Are there any <span>must-try</span> <span>restaurants</span>? <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Each</span> <span>ship</span> usually has its <span>specialties</span>. Try to <span>experience</span> both the <span>buffet</span> and <span>sit-down</span> <span>restaurants</span>. And don't <span>miss</span> the <span>midnight</span> <span>buffet</span>. It's a <span>cruise</span> <span>classic</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 This is all <span>great</span> <span>advice</span>. <span>Thanks</span>. I can't <span>wait</span> for our <span>trip</span>. <span><br/></span> 
🎧 You're going to have a <span>blast</span>. <span>Cruises</span> are a <span>world</span> of their own. <span>Enjoy!<br/>

🎧 I <span>heard</span> the <span>company</span> is going <span>public</span> soon. Are you <span>planning</span> to <span>invest?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>, I've been <span>following</span> their <span>progress</span> <span>closely</span>. I think it's a good <span>opportunity</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>agree</span>. <span>Getting</span> a <span>piece</span> of the pie in an <span>upcoming</span> <span>company</span> can be <span>lucrative</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Definitely</span>, but I'm still doing my <span>research</span> on their <span>financials</span> and <span>market</span> <span>potential</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's a <span>wise</span> <span>approach</span>. You don't want to <span>rush</span> into it without <span>knowing</span> all the <span>details</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Exactly</span>. I want to make sure I'm <span>making</span> an <span>informed</span> <span>decision</span>.<br/>
🎧 How much of a <span>piece</span> of the pie are you <span>thinking</span> of <span>getting?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm <span>considering</span> <span>investing</span> a <span>significant</span> <span>portion</span> of my <span>portfolio</span>, but it <span>depends</span> on the <span>valuation</span> at the <span>IPO</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Makes</span> <span>sense</span>. It's <span>essential</span> to <span>strike</span> the right <span>balance</span> in your <span>investment</span> <span>portfolio</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Right</span>. I'm <span>aiming</span> for <span>diversification</span> <span>while</span> also <span>trying</span> to <span>grab</span> a <span>substantial</span> <span>piece</span> of the pie with this one.<br/>
🎧 Well, I <span>wish</span> you the best of <span>luck</span> with your <span>investment</span> <span>decision.<br/>
