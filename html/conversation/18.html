🎧 Hey <span>Joe</span>, did you hear the <span>rumors</span>?<br/> 
🎧 No, <span>Jason</span>. What <span>rumors</span>?<br/> 
🎧 The company is <span>laying</span> people <span>off</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>When</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I'm not sure. I heard this from <span>Susan</span> in <span>Accounting</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why are they <span>laying</span> people <span>off</span>?<br/> 
🎧 The company is not <span>making</span> a <span>profit</span>.<br/>
🎧 Are you <span>worried</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yeah. I'm very <span>worried</span>. I just <span>bought</span> a house.<br/>
🎧 I'm really <span>worried</span> too. My <span>wife</span> and I just had a <span>baby</span>. Also, I haven't been at this company for very long. I would be the first one to get <span>laid</span> off.<br/>
🎧 This is <span>terrible</span>. What should we do?<br/> 
🎧 Maybe we should start looking for other <span>jobs</span>.<br/>
🎧 But what if it's all a <span>rumor</span> and not <span>true</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, if you heard it from <span>Susan</span>, it must be <span>true</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Why</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Her mom is our <span>boss

🎧 Hey, how's the job <span>search</span> going, <span>Rick</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Not well, <span>Sean</span>. I've <span>sent</span> out over <span>30</span> <span>resumes</span> and no one has called me.<br/>
🎧 I think a lot of people are looking for <span>jobs</span> right now. The <span>economy</span> isn't very good, so <span>companies</span> aren't <span>hiring</span> people.<br/>
🎧 That's what it <span>seems</span> like. But I need a job.<br/>

🎧 What kind of work do you do?<br/> 
🎧 I'm an <span>electrician</span>.<br/>
🎧 Have you thought about <span>opening</span> your own <span>business</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, but that takes money.<br/>
🎧 I <span>understand</span>. If I hear <span>anyone</span> looking for an <span>electrician</span>, I'll let you know.<br/>
🎧 Thanks. It's been <span>frustrating</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why did you leave your last <span>job</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I didn't get along with my <span>boss</span>.<br/>
🎧 Maybe you should've <span>stayed</span> until you <span>found</span> another job.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. That was my <span>mistake</span>. I thought it would be easy to find another job. I was wrong.<br/>
🎧 Don't <span>worry</span>. You'll find one soon. Come on, let me buy you a cup of <span>coffee</span>.<br/>

🎧 Do you know where I can buy a new <span>dishwasher</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I think the home <span>improvement</span> <span>store</span> is having a big <span>sale</span> this weekend. Is your <span>dishwasher</span> <span>broken</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yeah. I need to <span>replace</span> it.<br/>
🎧 Have you <span>tried</span> to <span>repair</span> <span>it</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, we called a <span>repairman</span> <span>yesterday</span>. He said that it would <span>cost</span> more to <span>repair</span> than to <span>replace</span> it.<br/>
🎧 Wow. <span>At</span> <span>least</span> he was <span>honest</span> about it.<br/>
🎧 I know. I <span>appreciated</span> that. We really can't <span>afford</span> to buy a new one right now. We just had a <span>baby</span> a <span>couple</span> of <span>months</span> ago. But I really need one.<br/>
🎧 That's right. You had a <span>baby</span> not too long ago. Why don't you buy a used one?<br/> 
🎧 Where can I get a used one that's in good <span>condition</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I actually have a friend who is <span>selling</span> <span>hers</span>. She said there isn't anything wrong with her <span>current</span> one. She just <span>wants</span> a different color. Her <span>current</span> one is <span>white</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't <span>care</span> what color it is. I just want one that <span>works</span> well. Do you know how much it <span>is</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I don't know. Let me call her right now.<br/>
🎧 Thanks. I'll talk to my <span>husband</span> too. He may not want a used one. He's a little <span>picky</span> about <span>appliances</span>.<br/>

🎧 I just <span>bought</span> a new <span>washer</span> and <span>dryer</span> set. I love <span>it</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I'm <span>jealous</span>. My set is really old. It takes a long time to <span>wash</span> and <span>dry</span>.<br/>
🎧 You should really look into <span>upgrading</span> your set. It can <span>save</span> you <span>money</span>?<br/>
