🎧 Hey <span>Joe</span>, did you <span>hear</span> the <span>rumors?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>No</span>, <span>Jason</span>. What <span>rumors?<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>company</span> is <span>laying</span> people <span>off?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>When?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>I'm</span> not sure. I <span>heard</span> this from <span>Susan</span> in <span>Accounting</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why are they <span>laying</span> people <span>off?<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>company</span> is not <span>making</span> a <span>profit</span>.<br/>
🎧 Are you <span>worried?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>. <span>I'm</span> very <span>worried</span>. I just <span>bought</span> a <span>house</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>I'm</span> <span>really</span> <span>worried</span> too. My <span>wife</span> and I just had a <span>baby</span>. Also, I haven't <span>been</span> at this <span>company</span> for very long. I would be the <span>first</span> one to get <span>laid</span> off.<br/>
🎧 This is <span>terrible</span>. What should we <span>do?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Maybe</span> we should <span>start</span> <span>looking</span> for other <span>jobs</span>.<br/>
🎧 But what if it's all a <span>rumor</span> and not <span>true</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, if you <span>heard</span> it from <span>Susan</span>, it <span>must</span> be <span>true</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Why?<br/></span> 
🎧 Her mom is our <span>boss.<br/>

🎧 Not well, <span>Sean</span>. I've <span>sent</span> out over <span>30</span> <span>resumes</span> and no one has <span>called</span> me.<br/>
🎧 I think a lot of people are <span>looking</span> for <span>jobs</span> right now. The <span>economy</span> isn't very good, so <span>companies</span> aren't <span>hiring</span> people.<br/>
