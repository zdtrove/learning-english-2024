🎧 Hi <span>Sally</span>. My <span>kids</span> want to go out for <span>breakfast</span> this <span>weekend</span>. Do you have a <span>favorite</span> <span>restaurant?<br/></span> 
🎧 Hi <span>Mary</span>. Yeah, our <span>favorite</span> place is the <span>pancake</span> house on <span>Main</span> <span>Street</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh</span>, I haven't been there yet.<br/>
🎧 We love it. <span>Kids</span> eat free on their <span>birthdays</span> too.<br/>
🎧 What do your <span>kids</span> like <span>there?<br/></span> 
🎧 They love the <span>chocolate</span> <span>chip</span> <span>pancakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh</span>, my <span>children</span> would love <span>those</span>. They like anything with <span>chocolate</span>.<br/>
🎧 I like their <span>waffles</span>. They're <span>thick</span> and <span>fluffy</span>. They put <span>fresh</span> <span>strawberries</span> over them.<br/>
🎧 I may want to try that. I'm getting <span>hungry</span> now.<br/>
🎧 Me too.<br/>
🎧 <span>Would</span> you like to <span>join</span> us on <span>Saturday</span> <span>morning?<br/></span> 
🎧 I can't on <span>Saturday</span>. <span>Joanne</span> has a <span>soccer</span> game in the morning. What about <span>Sunday?<br/></span> 
🎧 We have <span>church</span> in the morning, but we are free around <span>10</span> am.<br/>
🎧 <span>10</span> am is good for us too.<br/>
🎧 Ok. Let's <span>meet</span> on <span>Sunday</span> at <span>10</span> am at the <span>restaurant</span>.<br/>
🎧 That sounds <span>wonderful.<br/>

🎧 Wow! What are you <span>making?<br/></span> 
🎧 I don't know. His <span>wife</span> is a <span>vegetarian</span>, so I need to make one <span>dish</span> without <span>meat</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>mother-in-law</span> is a <span>vegetarian</span>. I can ask her for some <span>recipes</span>.<br/>
🎧 That would be great. I'm a little <span>nervous</span> about <span>hosting</span> dinner.<br/>
🎧 You shouldn't <span>worry</span>. You're a great <span>cook</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've never <span>cooked</span> for <span>Jeff's</span> <span>boss</span> before. I want to make sure everything is <span>perfect</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>understand</span>. I <span>cooked</span> for my <span>boss</span> once. It was a <span>disaster</span>. I <span>burned</span> the <span>roast</span> <span>beef</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh</span> no! What <span>happened?<br/></span> 
🎧 I was too <span>busy</span> talking and <span>forgot</span> to take it out of the <span>oven</span>. We all <span>laughed</span>, but I was so <span>embarrassed</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll make sure to use a <span>timer</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Great</span> <span>idea!<br/></span> 
🎧 I think I will make <span>lasagna</span>.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>lasagna</span> is <span>delicious</span>. My <span>mother-in-law</span> <span>makes</span> great <span>vegetarian</span> <span>lasagna</span>. I'll <span>call</span> her right now.<br/>
🎧 <span>Thank</span> you so much! I'll go the <span>market</span> after you talk to her.<br/>

🎧 I need to find a job. I was thinking about <span>applying</span> at a <span>fast</span> food <span>restaurant</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a good place to learn how to work quickly.<br/>
🎧 I'm a <span>fast</span> <span>learner</span> and I can move <span>pretty</span> quickly.<br/>
🎧 Also, it's a good place to learn how to <span>handle</span> <span>customers</span>.<br/>

🎧 They will <span>train</span> you. You just have to be <span>polite</span> and listen well.<br/>
