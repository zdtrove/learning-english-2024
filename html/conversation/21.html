🎧 Do you <span>ever</span> buy the <span>school</span> <span>lunch?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>No</span>, <span>it</span> <span>looks</span> <span>gross.<br/></span> 
🎧 It's <span>actually</span> not bad. <span>Some</span> <span>dishes</span> are <span>pretty</span> <span>good.<br/></span> 
🎧 Which <span>ones</span> have you <span>tried?<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>spaghetti</span> and <span>pizza</span> are <span>good</span>. But the <span>hamburgers</span> and <span>burritos</span> are <span>terrible</span>. <span>They</span> <span>taste</span> <span>like</span> <span>cardboard.<br/></span> 
🎧 That's <span>awful</span>! <span>Maybe</span> <span>I'll</span> buy <span>lunch</span> when the <span>cafeteria</span> <span>serves</span> <span>spaghetti</span> and <span>pizza</span>. <span>Those</span> are my <span>favorite</span> <span>dishes</span> <span>at</span> <span>home.<br/></span> 
🎧 They're <span>pretty</span> <span>good</span>, but not <span>as</span> <span>good</span> <span>as</span> our <span>moms'</span> <span>cooking.<br/></span> 
🎧 Are you <span>done</span> <span>with</span> <span>lunch</span>? Let's <span>go</span> out to <span>recess.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>. Let's <span>go!<br/>

🎧 That's a <span>good</span> <span>idea</span>. But I <span>think</span> I <span>want</span> <span>Chinese</span> <span>food</span> <span>instead.<br/></span>
