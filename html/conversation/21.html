🎧 <span>Hi</span> <span>Sally</span>. My <span>kids</span> want to go out for <span>breakfast</span> this <span>weekend</span>. Do you have a <span>favorite</span> <span>restaurant?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hi</span> <span>Mary</span>. <span>Yeah</span>, our <span>favorite</span> <span>place</span> is the <span>pancake</span> house on <span>Main</span> <span>Street</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh</span>, I haven't been there yet.<br/>
🎧 We love it. <span>Kids</span> eat <span>free</span> on their <span>birthdays</span> <span>too</span>.<br/>
🎧 What do your <span>kids</span> like <span>there?<br/></span> 
🎧 They love the <span>chocolate</span> <span>chip</span> <span>pancakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh</span>, my <span>children</span> would love <span>those</span>. They like <span>anything</span> with <span>chocolate</span>.<br/>
🎧 I like their <span>waffles</span>. They're <span>thick</span> and <span>fluffy</span>. They put <span>fresh</span> <span>strawberries</span> over them.<br/>
🎧 I may want to try that. I'm <span>getting</span> <span>hungry</span> <span>now</span>.<br/>
🎧 Me <span>too</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Would</span> you like to <span>join</span> us on <span>Saturday</span> <span>morning?<br/></span> 
🎧 I can't on <span>Saturday</span>. <span>Joanne</span> has a <span>soccer</span> game in the <span>morning</span>. What about <span>Sunday?<br/></span> 
🎧 We have <span>church</span> in the <span>morning</span>, but we are <span>free</span> around <span>10</span> am.<br/>
🎧 <span>10</span> am is good for us <span>too</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ok</span>. Let's <span>meet</span> on <span>Sunday</span> at <span>10</span> am at the <span>restaurant</span>.<br/>
🎧 That <span>sounds</span> <span>wonderful.<br/>

🎧 I'll make sure to use a <span>timer</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Great</span> <span>idea!<br/></span> 
🎧 I think I will make <span>lasagna</span>.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>lasagna</span> is <span>delicious</span>. My <span>mother-in-law</span> <span>makes</span> <span>great</span> <span>vegetarian</span> <span>lasagna</span>. I'll <span>call</span> her right <span>now</span>.<br/>
