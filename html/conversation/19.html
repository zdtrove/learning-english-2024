🎧 I think I need a new <span>computer</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Why</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Mine</span> is so <span>slow</span> now. It takes a long time to start up and it <span>keeps</span> <span>freezing</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's not good. How old is <span>it</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Several</span> years old. It was a high school <span>graduation</span> <span>gift</span> from my <span>parents</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, it's probably time to <span>replace</span> it.<br/>
🎧 I don't know what to buy. There are so many different <span>models</span> these <span>days</span>.<br/>
🎧 You should go to a <span>computer</span> <span>store</span> and ask about the different <span>kinds</span>?<br/> 
🎧 That's a good idea. Do you want to go with me?<br/> 
🎧 When? I have to work today. Can you wait until <span>tomorrow</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Sure. I have to work until <span>5</span> pm <span>tomorrow</span>. Can you go around <span>6</span> <span>o'clock</span> <span>tomorrow</span> <span>evening</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yeah. Let's meet at your place at <span>6</span> pm.<br/>
🎧 Ok. I'll do some <span>research</span> on <span>computers</span> <span>tonight</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>brother</span> just <span>bought</span> a <span>brand</span> new <span>computer</span> too. I can ask him if he <span>likes</span> it.<br/>
🎧 That would be great!<br/> 
🎧 See you <span>tomorrow</span> around <span>6</span> <span>pm

🎧 I think I am <span>finally</span> going to get a <span>cell</span> phone.<br/>
🎧 You don't have a <span>cell</span> <span>phone</span>?<br/> 
🎧 No. I didn't think it was <span>necessary</span>, but now I think I should get one.<br/>
🎧 What made you decide to get one now?<br/> 
🎧 My car <span>broke</span> down in the <span>middle</span> of the <span>road</span> last <span>night</span> and I had to <span>walk</span> to the <span>nearest</span> pay phone to call a friend. It was <span>scary</span> <span>walking</span> <span>alone</span> at <span>night</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, <span>cell</span> <span>phones</span> are very <span>convenient</span>. Do you know what kind you want to <span>get</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Just</span> a <span>basic</span> one. I don't need anything <span>fancy</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you want a <span>smartphone</span>?<br/> 
🎧 What is that?<br/> 
🎧 You don't know what a <span>smartphone</span> <span>is</span>?<br/> 
🎧 No. Can you <span>explain</span> it to me?<br/> 
🎧 A <span>smartphone</span> is a <span>cell</span> phone that also has <span>computer</span> <span>features</span>. You have <span>e-mail</span> and <span>Internet</span> <span>access</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't need those things. I don't even have an <span>e-mail</span> <span>address</span>.<br/>
🎧 You don't have an <span>e-mail</span> <span>address</span>?<br/> 
🎧 No.<br/>
🎧 <span>Then</span> how do you <span>send</span> <span>written</span> <span>communication</span> to other <span>people</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I <span>write</span> and <span>mail</span> <span>letters</span>.<br/>
🎧 Wow! That's <span>amazing</span>! <span>People</span> don't <span>mail</span> <span>letters</span> <span>anymore</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I think I will get a <span>cell</span> phone, just in case of an <span>emergency</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's a good idea! <span>Welcome</span> to <span>modern</span> <span>technology</span>, <span>Ruth

🎧 Are you <span>buying</span> a new <span>TV</span>?<br/> 
🎧 No. My son has been <span>saving</span> money to buy a <span>tablet</span>. They're so <span>expensive</span>, so I told him I would pay for <span>half</span> of it.<br/>
🎧 That's so nice of you.<br/>
🎧 His <span>birthday</span> is next week, so this is his <span>birthday</span> <span>present</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why don't you buy one for <span>yourself</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I already have one. My son really <span>likes</span> it. So, he <span>wants</span> one of his own.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I see. They're great. They're like <span>mini</span> <span>computers</span>. I love the touch <span>screen</span> <span>feature</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know. My son <span>keeps</span> taking <span>mine</span>. I'm <span>tired</span> of <span>sharing</span> it with him all the time.<br/>
🎧 Is that why you are <span>helping</span> him buy one?<br/> 
🎧 Yes. Do you have one?<br/> 
🎧 Yeah. I should get another one too.<br/>

🎧 Did you get a good <span>deal</span>?<br/>

🎧 Mom, can we go <span>furniture</span> <span>shopping</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Sure. What do you need to <span>buy</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Something for my new <span>apartment</span>.<br/>
🎧 How do you like your first <span>apartment</span>? Do you like living <span>alone</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, it's great. But my <span>apartment</span> is so empty. I need some <span>furniture</span> to make it feel <span>cozy</span>.<br/>
🎧 What do you <span>need</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I already have a bed and a <span>sofa</span> that you and Dad gave me. I need to buy a <span>dining</span> <span>table</span> and <span>chairs</span>.<br/>
🎧 Where do you sit to <span>eat</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Right</span> now, I eat on the <span>sofa</span>. But I'd like to <span>invite</span> people over for dinner and be able to <span>dine</span> <span>comfortably</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can you <span>afford</span> to buy a new <span>dining</span> <span>table</span> and <span>chairs</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I have some money <span>saved</span>, but not a lot.<br/>
🎧 Why don't we try a <span>yard</span> <span>sale</span>? I always see people <span>selling</span> their <span>dining</span> room <span>furniture</span> at <span>yard</span> <span>sales</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's a great idea! Maybe if the <span>furniture</span> looks really old, I can get a good <span>deal</span>. I can just <span>paint</span> them.<br/>
🎧 <span>Right</span>! We should go today.<br/>
🎧 Yes! I'm <span>excited</span> to see what I can find.<br/>
