🎧 I <span>think</span> I <span>need</span> a new <span>computer</span> .<br/>
🎧 <span>Why?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Mine</span> <span>is</span> so <span>slow</span> now. <span>It</span> <span>takes</span> a <span>long</span> <span>time</span> to <span>start</span> <span>up</span> and <span>it</span> <span>keeps</span> <span>freezing</span> .<br/>
🎧 That's not <span>good</span>. How old <span>is</span> <span>it?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Several</span> <span>years</span> old. <span>It</span> was a <span>high</span> <span>school</span> <span>graduation</span> <span>gift</span> <span>from</span> my <span>parents</span> .<br/>
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>, it's <span>probably</span> <span>time</span> to <span>replace</span> <span>it</span> .<br/>
🎧 I don't <span>know</span> what to buy. There are so <span>many</span> <span>different</span> <span>models</span> <span>these</span> <span>days</span> .<br/>
🎧 You <span>should</span> <span>go</span> to a <span>computer</span> <span>store</span> and ask <span>about</span> the <span>different</span> <span>kinds?<br/></span> 
🎧 That's a <span>good</span> <span>idea</span>. Do you <span>want</span> to <span>go</span> <span>with</span> <span>me?<br/></span> 
🎧 When? I have to <span>work</span> <span>today</span>. Can you <span>wait</span> <span>until</span> <span>tomorrow?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Sure</span>. I have to <span>work</span> <span>until</span> <span>5</span> <span>pm</span> <span>tomorrow</span>. Can you <span>go</span> <span>around</span> <span>6</span> <span>o'clock</span> <span>tomorrow</span> <span>evening?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>. Let's <span>meet</span> <span>at</span> your <span>place</span> <span>at</span> <span>6</span> <span>pm</span> .<br/>
🎧 <span>Ok</span>. <span>I'll</span> do <span>some</span> <span>research</span> <span>on</span> <span>computers</span> <span>tonight</span> .<br/>
🎧 My <span>brother</span> <span>just</span> <span>bought</span> a <span>brand</span> new <span>computer</span> too. I can ask him <span>if</span> <span>he</span> <span>likes</span> <span>it</span> .<br/>
🎧 <span>That</span> <span>would</span> be <span>great!<br/></span> 
🎧 See you <span>tomorrow</span> <span>around</span> <span>6</span> <span>pm.<br/>
