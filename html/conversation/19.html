🎧 I think I need a new <span>computer</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Why?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Mine</span> is so <span>slow</span> now. It <span>takes</span> a long time to <span>start</span> up and it <span>keeps</span> <span>freezing</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's not good. How old is <span>it?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Several</span> <span>years</span> old. It was a high school <span>graduation</span> <span>gift</span> from my <span>parents</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>, it's <span>probably</span> time to <span>replace</span> it.<br/>
🎧 I don't know what to buy. There are so many <span>different</span> <span>models</span> these <span>days</span>.<br/>
🎧 You should go to a <span>computer</span> <span>store</span> and ask about the <span>different</span> <span>kinds?<br/></span> 
🎧 That's a good <span>idea</span>. Do you want to go with <span>me?<br/></span> 
🎧 When? I have to work <span>today</span>. Can you <span>wait</span> <span>until</span> <span>tomorrow?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Sure</span>. I have to work <span>until</span> <span>5</span> <span>pm</span> <span>tomorrow</span>. Can you go around <span>6</span> <span>o'clock</span> <span>tomorrow</span> <span>evening?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>. Let's <span>meet</span> at your <span>place</span> at <span>6</span> <span>pm</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ok</span>. I'll do some <span>research</span> on <span>computers</span> <span>tonight</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>brother</span> just <span>bought</span> a <span>brand</span> new <span>computer</span> too. I can ask him if he <span>likes</span> it.<br/>
🎧 That would be <span>great!<br/></span>

🎧 I think I am <span>finally</span> going to get a <span>cell</span> <span>phone</span>.<br/>
🎧 You don't have a <span>cell</span> <span>phone?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>No</span>. I didn't think it was <span>necessary</span>, but now I think I should get one.<br/>
🎧 What made you <span>decide</span> to get one <span>now?<br/></span> 
🎧 My car <span>broke</span> <span>down</span> in the <span>middle</span> of the <span>road</span> last <span>night</span> and I had to <span>walk</span> to the <span>nearest</span> pay <span>phone</span> to <span>call</span> a <span>friend</span>. It was <span>scary</span> <span>walking</span> <span>alone</span> at <span>night</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>, <span>cell</span> <span>phones</span> are very <span>convenient</span>. Do you know what kind you want to <span>get?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Just</span> a <span>basic</span> one. I don't need <span>anything</span> <span>fancy</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you want a <span>smartphone?<br/></span> 
🎧 What is <span>that?<br/></span> 
🎧 You don't know what a <span>smartphone</span> <span>is?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>No</span>. Can you <span>explain</span> it to <span>me?<br/></span> 
🎧 A <span>smartphone</span> is a <span>cell</span> <span>phone</span> that also has <span>computer</span> <span>features</span>. You have <span>e-mail</span> and <span>Internet</span> <span>access</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't need <span>those</span> <span>things</span>. I don't even have an <span>e-mail</span> <span>address</span>.<br/>
🎧 You don't have an <span>e-mail</span> <span>address?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>No</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Then</span> how do you <span>send</span> <span>written</span> <span>communication</span> to other <span>people?<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>write</span> and <span>mail</span> <span>letters</span>.<br/>
🎧 Wow! That's <span>amazing</span>! <span>People</span> don't <span>mail</span> <span>letters</span> <span>anymore</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I think I will get a <span>cell</span> <span>phone</span>, just in case of an <span>emergency</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's a good <span>idea</span>! <span>Welcome</span> to <span>modern</span> <span>technology</span>, <span>Ruth!<br/>

🎧 <span>Hi</span> <span>Jane</span>. What are you doing <span>today?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hi</span> <span>Kathy</span>. <span>I'm</span> going <span>back-to-school</span> <span>shopping</span> with the <span>kids</span>.<br/>
🎧 We did that last <span>week</span>.<br/>
🎧 Are there any good <span>sales</span> going <span>on?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>, the <span>mall</span> is <span>having</span> <span>great</span> <span>sales</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Good</span>. I need to buy <span>clothes</span> and <span>shoes</span> for my <span>daughter</span>. She has <span>outgrown</span> all of her <span>clothes</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Really</span>? My <span>kids</span> are still <span>wearing</span> the same <span>size</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Jenny</span> <span>grew</span> <span>four</span> <span>inches</span> during the <span>summer</span>.<br/>
🎧 Wow! That's <span>amazing!<br/></span> 
🎧 I know. She <span>eats</span> a lot these <span>days</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Probably</span> <span>because</span> she is <span>growing</span>. Do you need to buy school <span>supplies</span>, <span>too?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>, I will be <span>shopping</span> for <span>clothes</span>, <span>shoes</span>, and school <span>supplies</span> <span>today</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>I'm</span> <span>glad</span> <span>I'm</span> <span>done</span>. The <span>mall</span> was <span>really</span> <span>crowded</span> last <span>week</span>. I think <span>everyone</span> is <span>shopping</span> for school.<br/>
🎧 I do not like <span>crowds</span>. We should've <span>done</span> this <span>earlier</span>. We always <span>wait</span> <span>until</span> the last <span>minute</span> <span>every</span> <span>year</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Good</span> <span>luck</span>! I hope you find <span>everything</span> you need.<br/>
🎧 <span>Thanks</span>. It's going to be a long <span>day.<br/></span>
