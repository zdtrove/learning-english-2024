ðŸŽ§ How do you usually start your day? <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I like to <span>wake</span> up <span>early</span>, around <span>6</span> am. I start with some <span>stretches</span> and then a cup of <span>coffee</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Ah</span>, a <span>fellow</span> <span>early</span> <span>riser</span>! I'm more of a <span>7</span> am person <span>myself</span>, but <span>coffee</span> is <span>definitely</span> a <span>must</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Definitely</span>, can't <span>function</span> without it. <span>After</span> <span>coffee</span>, I usually go for a run or hit the gym before <span>breakfast</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ That sounds <span>energizing</span>. I <span>prefer</span> a <span>slower</span> start. I usually <span>meditate</span> for a bit after <span>coffee;</span> helps <span>clear</span> my <span>mind</span> for the day <span>ahead</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ That's <span>smart</span>. I might give <span>meditation</span> a try one of these <span>days</span>. <span>After</span> my <span>workout</span>, I have <span>breakfast</span>, usually something <span>light</span> like <span>yogurt</span> and <span>fruit</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I'm more of a <span>hearty</span> <span>breakfast</span> <span>personâ€”eggs</span>, <span>toast</span>, the <span>works</span>. <span>Then</span> it's off to work for me. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Sounds</span> like a <span>solid</span> <span>routine</span>. I find <span>sticking</span> to a <span>routine</span> helps set a <span>positive</span> <span>tone</span> for the <span>rest</span> of the day. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Absolutely. Well, here's to <span>starting</span> the day off right. <span>Cheers!<br/>

ðŸŽ§ I'm <span>having</span> <span>trouble</span> <span>hearing</span> you, <span>could</span> you say it again? <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Sure. I was saying that I'm thinking about <span>starting</span> my own <span>business</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Ah</span>, got it. What kind of <span>business</span> are you <span>considering</span>? <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I'm thinking of <span>opening</span> a small <span>cafÃ©</span>. I've always had a <span>passion</span> for <span>coffee</span>, and I think it would be a <span>fulfilling</span> <span>venture</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ That sounds like an <span>exciting</span> <span>idea</span>. Have you <span>started</span> planning out the <span>details</span>? <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Yeah, I've been doing some <span>research</span> on <span>location</span>, <span>menu</span> <span>options</span>, and <span>potential</span> <span>suppliers</span>. I want to make sure I have a <span>solid</span> <span>plan</span> before <span>diving</span> in. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Smart</span> <span>approach</span>. Have you <span>considered</span> the <span>financial</span> <span>aspects</span> of <span>starting</span> a <span>business</span>? <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Definitely</span>. I've been <span>working</span> on a <span>budget</span> and <span>exploring</span> different <span>funding</span> <span>options</span> like <span>loans</span> or <span>investors</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ It sounds like you're <span>taking</span> a <span>thorough</span> <span>approach</span>. Do you have any <span>experience</span> in the food and <span>beverage</span> <span>industry</span>? <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Not <span>professionally</span>, but I've <span>worked</span> in <span>cafÃ©s</span> before, and I'm <span>passionate</span> about <span>creating</span> a <span>welcoming</span> <span>atmosphere</span> for <span>customers</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, let me know if you need any help or advice as you <span>pursue</span> your <span>business</span> <span>venture</span>. I'd be happy to <span>support</span> you. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Thanks, I <span>appreciate</span> it. It's a big <span>step</span>, but I'm <span>excited</span> about the <span>possibilities.<br/>

ðŸŽ§ <span>Pardon</span> me, I didn't <span>catch</span> that. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ No <span>problem</span>. I was just saying that I'm <span>considering</span> <span>adopting</span> a pet. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Ah</span>, got it. What kind of pet are you thinking of getting? <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I'm <span>leaning</span> <span>towards</span> <span>adopting</span> a dog from a <span>shelter</span>. I think it would be nice to have a <span>furry</span> <span>companion</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Dogs</span> make great <span>pets</span>. Have you <span>thought</span> about what <span>breed</span> you want? <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I'm <span>open</span> to different <span>breeds</span>, but I'm thinking of <span>adopting</span> a <span>mixed-breed</span> dog. They <span>tend</span> to be more <span>unique</span> and have <span>fewer</span> <span>health</span> <span>issues</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ That's a <span>thoughtful</span> <span>approach</span>. Have you <span>considered</span> the <span>responsibilities</span> that come with <span>owning</span> a pet? <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Definitely</span>. I've been doing some <span>research</span> on pet <span>care</span> and <span>training</span>. I want to make sure I'm <span>fully</span> <span>prepared</span> to take <span>care</span> of a dog. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ That's great to hear. <span>Adopting</span> a pet is a big <span>commitment</span>, but it can also be very <span>rewarding</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Yeah, I'm <span>excited</span> about the <span>possibility</span> of <span>giving</span> a <span>shelter</span> dog a <span>loving</span> home. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, let me know if you need any advice or <span>assistance</span> with the <span>adoption</span> <span>process.<br/>

ðŸŽ§ <span>Honey</span>, I've been thinking a lot about the changes in our lives <span>lately</span>. It <span>seems</span> like we're on the <span>brink</span> of a new <span>chapter</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I've been <span>feeling</span> that too. With the <span>kids</span> <span>growing</span> up and our <span>careers</span> <span>evolving</span>, it's like we're <span>entering</span> a <span>whole</span> new <span>phase</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Exactly</span>. And I think it's <span>important</span> for us to <span>navigate</span> these <span>transitions</span> <span>together</span> as a <span>team</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Agreed</span>. <span>Change</span> can be <span>scary</span>, but I know we're <span>stronger</span> when we <span>face</span> it <span>together</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I <span>believe</span> this is an <span>opportunity</span> for <span>growth</span> and <span>adventure</span>. We can <span>embrace</span> these changes and make the most out of them. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I like the sound of that. Let's <span>approach</span> these <span>transitions</span> with <span>optimism</span> and a <span>sense</span> of <span>excitement</span> for what's to come. <br/>

ðŸŽ§ Are you a morning or <span>night</span> person? <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Definitely</span> a <span>night</span> owl. <span>Mornings</span> are just not my thing. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I hear you. I'm the <span>complete</span> <span>oppositeâ€”love</span> <span>waking</span> up <span>early</span> and getting things done. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ That's <span>impressive</span>. I <span>struggle</span> to <span>function</span> before <span>noon</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ It's all about <span>finding</span> your <span>rhythm</span>, I <span>guess</span>. But <span>staying</span> up <span>late</span> <span>must</span> have its <span>perks</span> too. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Yeah, I get a lot done when the <span>world</span> is <span>quiet</span>. <span>Plus</span>, there's something about the <span>nighttime</span> that <span>feels</span> more <span>peaceful</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I can see that. I'm usually <span>winding</span> <span>down</span> by then, getting <span>ready</span> for bed. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I <span>envy</span> that <span>ability</span>. I can <span>never</span> <span>seem</span> to go to bed at a <span>decent</span> <span>hour</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, we all have our <span>preferences</span>. <span>As</span> long as you're getting enough <span>rest</span>, right? <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>True</span>. And hey, at <span>least</span> one of us is <span>alive</span> in the <span>mornings</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ And one of us <span>keeps</span> the <span>night</span> <span>alive</span>. We make a good <span>team</span>, don't we? <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Absolutely. <span>As</span> long as we <span>cover</span> both <span>ends</span> of the day, we're <span>unstoppable.<br/>

ðŸŽ§ Do you have any <span>tips</span> for <span>dealing</span> with <span>leftovers</span> and <span>meal</span> planning? I always <span>struggle</span> with what to do with them. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Leftovers</span> can <span>actually</span> be a <span>lifesaver</span>. I like to <span>plan</span> my <span>meals</span> for the week and <span>intentionally</span> <span>cook</span> <span>extra</span> <span>portions</span> to have <span>leftovers</span> for <span>lunches</span> or <span>dinners</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ That's a good <span>idea</span>. I <span>never</span> <span>thought</span> about <span>intentionally</span> <span>making</span> <span>leftovers</span>. How do you keep them from getting <span>boring</span>? <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I try to get <span>creative</span> with <span>leftovers</span> by <span>repurposing</span> them into new <span>dishes</span>. For example, <span>leftover</span> <span>roasted</span> <span>chicken</span> can be <span>turned</span> into a <span>chicken</span> <span>salad</span> or <span>added</span> to a <span>pasta</span> <span>dish</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Ah</span>, I see. That <span>adds</span> <span>variety</span> to the <span>meals</span> without much <span>extra</span> <span>effort</span>. What about <span>meal</span> planning? How do you <span>approach</span> that? <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I like to sit <span>down</span> at the <span>beginning</span> of the week and <span>plan</span> out my <span>meals</span>, <span>taking</span> into <span>account</span> what <span>ingredients</span> I <span>already</span> have and what's on <span>sale</span> at the <span>grocery</span> <span>store</span>. It <span>saves</span> time and money. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ That <span>makes</span> <span>sense</span>. I think I'll give <span>meal</span> planning a try. It sounds like it would help <span>reduce</span> food <span>waste</span> and make cooking during the week <span>less</span> <span>stressful</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Exactly</span>. It's all about <span>finding</span> a <span>system</span> that <span>works</span> for you and <span>sticking</span> to it. You'll be <span>amazed</span> at how much <span>smoother</span> <span>mealtime</span> <span>becomes</span> with a little planning. <span><br/>

ðŸŽ§ Hey <span>Steve</span>. My <span>family</span> and I want to do something fun this <span>weekend</span>? Do you have any <span>suggestions?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ The <span>weather</span> is going to be nice. You should do something <span>outdoors</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Yeah, it's <span>supposed</span> to be <span>sunny</span> all <span>weekend</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ How about a <span>picnic</span> at the <span>park?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ We do that <span>often</span>. I want to do something more fun.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ How about the <span>city</span> zoo? I <span>heard</span> that <span>bear</span> <span>cubs</span> were <span>recently</span> <span>born</span> there.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That's a good <span>idea</span>. We haven't been to the zoo in a long time.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Then</span> you should <span>definitely</span> go this <span>weekend</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ The last time we were there, it <span>started</span> <span>raining</span>. <span>None</span> of the <span>animals</span> <span>wanted</span> to come out.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That must've been <span>boring</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ It was <span>boring</span>. The <span>kids</span> <span>wanted</span> to go home <span>early</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ The <span>animals</span> should be more <span>visible</span> <span>since</span> the <span>weather</span> is going to be <span>sunny</span> this <span>weekend</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Yeah. I think we will go to the zoo. <span>Hopefully</span>, this time it'll be more fun.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Actually</span>, I have <span>four</span> <span>tickets</span> to the zoo. You can have them. Our <span>family</span> won't be able to go. The <span>tickets</span> <span>expire</span> this <span>weekend</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Thanks, <span>Steve</span>! Let me pay you for them. Zoo <span>tickets</span> are <span>expensive</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Don't <span>worry</span> about it. It's my <span>gift</span> to you <span>since</span> your last visit was not fun.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Are you sure! This is very <span>generous</span> of you.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Also, you <span>mowed</span> my <span>lawn</span> a few <span>times</span> after I had back <span>surgery</span> last year. I really <span>appreciated</span> that.<br/>

ðŸŽ§ Is there anything else we need to <span>bring?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I'll <span>bring</span> the <span>camera</span>. I want to take <span>pictures</span> of the <span>sunset</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Good <span>idea</span>! The <span>sunset</span> is <span>beautiful</span> at the <span>beach</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Do you <span>remember</span> the last time we <span>went</span> to the <span>beach?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ No. It's been a long time. Why don't we go more <span>often?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Because</span> you're always <span>watching</span> <span>TV</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Ok. Let's go to the <span>beach</span> when the <span>weather</span> is nice and <span>watch</span> <span>TV</span> when it <span>rains</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That's a <span>deal!<br/>

ðŸŽ§ Hi <span>Sheila</span>. Have you been to the new <span>amusement</span> <span>park</span> <span>yet?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ No. When did it <span>open?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Last</span> <span>weekend</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Was it <span>crowded?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ It was very <span>crowded</span>. <span>Parking</span> is <span>terrible</span> <span>too</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Did you have <span>fun?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Oh</span> yes! The <span>roller</span> <span>coasters</span> are really fun. My <span>kids</span> had a great time. It was even fun for the <span>adults</span> <span>too</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I didn't know it was <span>open</span> yet. I will have to take my son soon.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ You should. They will love it.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Are the <span>tickets</span> <span>expensive?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Yeah, they're <span>pretty</span> <span>expensive</span>. But your <span>family</span> will enjoy it.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Maybe</span> we'll go this <span>weekend</span>. We don't have any <span>plans</span> on <span>Saturday</span>. My son has been <span>asking</span> about it.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ If you go on <span>Saturday</span>, try to go <span>early</span>. There aren't enough <span>parking</span> <span>spots</span>. They need to add more.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Ok. That's good to know. Do you have any other <span>tips?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ The <span>lines</span> for the <span>rides</span> are very long, so be <span>patient</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Ok. I <span>assumed</span> that. Now I have to <span>convince</span> my <span>husband</span> to go.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ He doesn't like <span>amusement</span> <span>parks?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ No. I have <span>motion</span> <span>sickness</span>, so I can't <span>ride</span> any of the <span>roller</span> <span>coasters</span>. That <span>means</span> my <span>husband</span> has to <span>ride</span> all of them with our <span>son</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Tell</span> him to be <span>prepared</span>. There are a lot of <span>roller</span> <span>coasters.<br/>
</span> <br/>
