🎧 <span>Hi</span> <span>Helen</span>. What's <span>wrong?<br/></span> 
🎧 I couldn't <span>sleep</span> <span>until</span> <span>3</span> <span>o'clock</span> <span>in</span> the <span>morning.<br/></span> 
🎧 Why? What <span>happened?<br/></span> 
🎧 Our <span>neighbors'</span> <span>children</span> <span>threw</span> a big <span>party</span> <span>last</span> <span>night</span>. The <span>music</span> was so <span>loud.<br/></span> 
🎧 Wow! Where <span>were</span> <span>their</span> <span>parents?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>They</span> are <span>on</span> <span>vacation</span>. <span>They</span> <span>left</span> the <span>kids</span> <span>home.<br/></span> 
🎧 How old are the <span>kids?<br/></span> 
🎧 They're <span>teenagers</span>. They're old <span>enough</span> to be <span>home</span> <span>alone.<br/></span> 
🎧 Did you <span>complain</span> to <span>them?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yes</span>! I <span>went</span> <span>over</span> there <span>three</span> <span>times</span>. I <span>told</span> <span>them</span> <span>that</span> <span>their</span> <span>music</span> was too <span>loud</span> and <span>we</span> <span>were</span> <span>trying</span> to <span>sleep.<br/></span> 
🎧 What did <span>they</span> <span>do?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Nothing</span>. <span>They</span> wouldn't <span>turn</span> the <span>music</span> <span>down.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>That</span> <span>is</span> so <span>rude</span>! Why didn't you <span>call</span> the <span>police?<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>finally</span> did. The <span>police</span> <span>found</span> <span>some</span> <span>of</span> the <span>teens</span> <span>drinking</span> <span>alcohol.<br/></span> 
🎧 I bet <span>that</span> <span>ended</span> the <span>party.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>. Now my <span>neighbors</span> are <span>heading</span> <span>back</span> <span>home</span> <span>from</span> <span>their</span> <span>vacation.<br/></span> 
🎧 Do <span>they</span> <span>know</span> what <span>happened?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yes</span>. <span>They</span> are not <span>happy</span>. <span>Those</span> <span>kids</span> are <span>in</span> big <span>trouble.<br/>

🎧 <span>Remember</span> our <span>cousin</span> <span>Bill</span> and I had a <span>disagreement</span> <span>at</span> the <span>last</span> <span>reunion?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yes</span>. But <span>it</span> was all a <span>misunderstanding.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>know</span>, but I <span>still</span> <span>feel</span> <span>uncomfortable</span> <span>about</span> <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>would</span> <span>really</span> <span>like</span> to see you there. I haven't <span>seen</span> you <span>in</span> a <span>while.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>know</span>. I <span>feel</span> the <span>same</span> <span>way.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>If</span> you don't <span>go</span> to the <span>reunion</span>, <span>maybe</span> I can <span>visit</span> <span>you.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>That</span> <span>sounds</span> <span>like</span> a <span>great</span> <span>idea</span>. Have you <span>ever</span> <span>been</span> to New <span>York?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>No</span>. I <span>would</span> <span>love</span> to <span>visit</span> you and <span>check</span> out the <span>city.<br/></span> 
🎧 Let's <span>plan</span> to do <span>that.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>still</span> <span>want</span> you to <span>come</span> to the <span>reunion.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>I'll</span> <span>think</span> <span>about</span> <span>it.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Ok</span>. I <span>hope</span> to see you <span>there.<br/>
