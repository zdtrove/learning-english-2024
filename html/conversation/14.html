🎧 Hi <span>Helen</span>. What's <span>wrong</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I couldn't <span>sleep</span> until <span>3</span> <span>o'clock</span> in the morning.<br/>
🎧 Why? What <span>happened</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Our <span>neighbors'</span> children <span>threw</span> a big <span>party</span> last <span>night</span>. The music was so <span>loud</span>.<br/>
🎧 Wow! Where were their <span>parents</span>?<br/> 
🎧 They are on <span>vacation</span>. They <span>left</span> the <span>kids</span> home.<br/>
🎧 How old are the <span>kids</span>?<br/> 
🎧 They're <span>teenagers</span>. They're old enough to be home <span>alone</span>.<br/>
🎧 Did you <span>complain</span> to them?<br/> 
🎧 Yes! I went over there <span>three</span> <span>times</span>. I told them that their music was too <span>loud</span> and we were trying to <span>sleep</span>.<br/>
🎧 What did they do?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Nothing</span>. They wouldn't <span>turn</span> the music down.<br/>
🎧 That is so <span>rude</span>! Why didn't you call the <span>police</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I finally did. The <span>police</span> <span>found</span> some of the <span>teens</span> <span>drinking</span> <span>alcohol</span>.<br/>
🎧 I bet that <span>ended</span> the <span>party</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. Now my <span>neighbors</span> are <span>heading</span> back home from their <span>vacation</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do they know what <span>happened</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yes. They are not happy. those <span>kids</span> are in big <span>trouble

🎧 I know. What is she going to do now?<br/> 
🎧 I don't know. Does she have any children?<br/> 
🎧 No, I don't think they had any children.<br/>
🎧 How about other <span>family</span> <span>members</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I think she had one <span>sister</span>, but she <span>passed</span> away <span>several</span> years <span>ago</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, she's all <span>alone</span> now?<br/> 
🎧 Yeah. Isn't that <span>sad</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yes, it is very <span>sad</span>.<br/>
🎧 She is always so nice to everyone. I think we should all get together and do something nice for her.<br/>
🎧 I like that idea. What should we do?<br/> 
🎧 Let's take <span>turns</span> <span>helping</span> her around the <span>house</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Great idea! We can take <span>care</span> of her <span>yard</span>, help <span>clean</span> her house, and <span>bring</span> her <span>meals</span>.<br/>

🎧 Yeah. Do you?<br/> 
🎧 Not every day. <span>Only</span> a <span>couple</span> of <span>times</span> a week.<br/>
🎧 Well, I think the bus is <span>late</span> today because of the <span>rain</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh. Does the <span>weather</span> make a <span>difference</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yes. The bus is usually <span>several</span> <span>minutes</span> <span>late</span> when it <span>rains</span>.<br/>
🎧 Because of bad <span>traffic</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yeah and probably because of car <span>accidents</span>.<br/>
🎧 That makes <span>sense</span>. I must have <span>picked</span> the wrong day to <span>ride</span> the <span>bus</span>.<br/>
🎧 Actually, I think <span>riding</span> the bus on <span>rainy</span> <span>days</span> is better.<br/>
🎧 <span>Why</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Then</span> you don't have to drive in bad <span>traffic</span>. <span>Someone</span> is driving for you.<br/>
🎧 You are <span>totally</span> right! I'm going to check the <span>weather</span> from now on. I'm going to take the bus when it <span>rains</span>.<br/>
