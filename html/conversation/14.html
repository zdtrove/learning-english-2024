🎧 <span>Hi</span> <span>Helen</span>. What's <span>wrong?<br/></span> 
🎧 I couldn't <span>sleep</span> <span>until</span> <span>3</span> <span>o'clock</span> in the <span>morning</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why? What <span>happened?<br/></span> 
🎧 Our <span>neighbors'</span> <span>children</span> <span>threw</span> a big <span>party</span> last <span>night</span>. The music was so <span>loud</span>.<br/>
🎧 Wow! Where were their <span>parents?<br/></span> 
🎧 They are on <span>vacation</span>. They <span>left</span> the <span>kids</span> home.<br/>
🎧 How old are the <span>kids?<br/></span> 
🎧 They're <span>teenagers</span>. They're old enough to be home <span>alone</span>.<br/>
🎧 Did you <span>complain</span> to <span>them?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yes</span>! I <span>went</span> over there <span>three</span> <span>times</span>. I told them that their music was too <span>loud</span> and we were <span>trying</span> to <span>sleep</span>.<br/>
🎧 What did they <span>do?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Nothing</span>. They wouldn't <span>turn</span> the music <span>down</span>.<br/>
🎧 That is so <span>rude</span>! Why didn't you <span>call</span> the <span>police?<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>finally</span> did. The <span>police</span> <span>found</span> some of the <span>teens</span> <span>drinking</span> <span>alcohol</span>.<br/>
🎧 I bet that <span>ended</span> the <span>party</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>. Now my <span>neighbors</span> are <span>heading</span> back home from their <span>vacation</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do they know what <span>happened?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yes</span>. They are not happy. <span>Those</span> <span>kids</span> are in big <span>trouble.<br/>

🎧 How about other <span>family</span> <span>members?<br/></span> 
🎧 I think she had one <span>sister</span>, but she <span>passed</span> away <span>several</span> years <span>ago</span>.<br/>
🎧 So, she's all <span>alone</span> <span>now?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>. Isn't that <span>sad?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yes</span>, it is very <span>sad</span>.<br/>
🎧 She is always so nice to <span>everyone</span>. I think we should all get <span>together</span> and do <span>something</span> nice for her.<br/>
🎧 I like that <span>idea</span>. What should we <span>do?<br/></span> 
🎧 Let's take <span>turns</span> <span>helping</span> her around the <span>house?<br/></span>
