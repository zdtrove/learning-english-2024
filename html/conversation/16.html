🎧 That's <span>five</span> <span>weeks</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yes</span>. That's his <span>punishment</span>. He <span>needs</span> to learn not to <span>hide</span> <span>letters</span> that come in the <span>mail</span>. He also <span>needs</span> to learn to <span>clean</span> his <span>room</span>, so <span>things</span> don't get <span>lost.<br/>

🎧 What are you doing <span>today?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hi</span> <span>Peter</span>. <span>I'm</span> <span>taking</span> my son to the <span>bank</span>. He got his <span>first</span> <span>paycheck</span> <span>yesterday</span>, so we're going to <span>open</span> a <span>bank</span> <span>account</span> for him.<br/>
🎧 That's a <span>great</span> <span>idea</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>, I hope this will <span>teach</span> him how to <span>save</span> <span>money</span> and use it <span>wisely</span>.<br/>
🎧 We did that with our <span>kids</span> too. Is he <span>excited</span> about <span>it?<br/></span> 
🎧 Not <span>really</span>. He <span>wants</span> to <span>spend</span> it all on <span>video</span> <span>games</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, it's his <span>first</span> <span>paycheck</span>, so <span>I'm</span> sure he <span>wants</span> to <span>spend</span> his own <span>money</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>understand</span> that. He <span>knows</span> he can <span>spend</span> it any way he <span>wants</span> to. I just want him to be <span>able</span> to learn how to <span>save</span> some <span>too</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>, I <span>totally</span> <span>understand</span>. My <span>first</span> son <span>spent</span> his <span>whole</span> <span>paycheck</span> each time. Now he doesn't have <span>anything</span> <span>saved</span>. My <span>second</span> son <span>saves</span> and <span>saves</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>I'm</span> <span>hoping</span> <span>Jonathan</span> <span>saves</span> and <span>saves</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now my <span>older</span> son always <span>borrows</span> <span>money</span> from his <span>younger</span> <span>brother</span>.<br/>
🎧 Wow! <span>Does</span> your <span>younger</span> son <span>loan</span> him <span>money?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>, but he <span>adds</span> on <span>interest</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>funny</span> and <span>smart</span>. He's like a <span>bank</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>wants</span> to be a <span>banker</span> one day.<br/>
🎧 This is <span>giving</span> him <span>great</span> <span>experience</span>.<br/>
