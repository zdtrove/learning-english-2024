🎧 <span>Hello</span>. <span>Thank</span> you for <span>calling</span> <span>Dr</span>. <span>Smith's</span> <span>office</span>. How can I help <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 This is <span>Eleanor</span> <span>Johnson</span>. I'd like to make an <span>appointment</span> to see the <span>dentist</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Will</span> this be your <span>first</span> <span>visit?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yes</span>. I haven't been to the <span>dentist</span> in a <span>while</span>. I'm <span>afraid</span> of going to the <span>dentist</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh</span>. You will like <span>Dr</span>. <span>Smith</span>. He is very <span>gentle</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's nice to hear.<br/>
🎧 Is there anything <span>wrong</span> with your <span>teeth?<br/></span>

🎧 We have an <span>opening</span> <span>tomorrow</span> morning at <span>9</span> am.<br/>
🎧 Do you have anything this <span>afternoon</span>. My <span>tooth</span> <span>hurts</span> very much.<br/>
🎧 We are very <span>busy</span> this <span>afternoon</span>, but I can <span>squeeze</span> you in around <span>4</span> <span>pm</span>. <span>Does</span> that work for <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yes</span>! <span>4</span> <span>pm</span> is <span>perfect</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you have <span>dental</span> <span>insurance?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yes</span>, I do.<br/>
🎧 Ok. Please come <span>15</span> <span>minutes</span> <span>early</span> to <span>fill</span> out some <span>forms</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ok. I will be there at <span>3:45</span>. <span>Thank</span> you so much.<br/>

🎧 You have a <span>dentist</span> <span>appointment</span>.<br/>

🎧 A <span>root</span> <span>canal</span>? That's <span>pretty</span> <span>serious</span>, isn't <span>it?<br/></span>

🎧 I don't have <span>dental</span> <span>insurance</span>, so it's going to be very <span>expensive</span>.<br/>

🎧 I think it's <span>important</span> to have <span>dental</span> <span>insurance</span>.<br/>

🎧 Hi <span>Janet</span>. Where are you going with <span>those</span> <span>books?<br/></span>

🎧 <span>Under</span> his <span>bed?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah. They are all <span>overdue</span>.<br/>

🎧 We got a <span>notice</span> from the <span>library</span> that he had <span>several</span> <span>overdue</span> <span>books</span>, so I <span>started</span> <span>searching</span> his <span>room</span>.<br/>
🎧 How <span>late</span> are <span>they?<br/></span>

🎧 Is he in <span>trouble?<br/></span> 
🎧 Of course he's in <span>trouble</span>. He doesn't get to play <span>video</span> <span>games</span> for each book that is <span>late</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>five</span> <span>weeks</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yes</span>. That's his <span>punishment</span>. He needs to learn not to <span>hide</span> <span>letters</span> that come in the <span>mail</span>. He also needs to learn to <span>clean</span> his <span>room</span>, so things don't get <span>lost.<br/>

🎧 That's a great <span>idea</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I hope this will <span>teach</span> him how to <span>save</span> money and use it <span>wisely</span>.<br/>
🎧 We did that with our <span>kids</span> too. Is he <span>excited</span> about <span>it?<br/></span> 
🎧 Not really. He <span>wants</span> to <span>spend</span> it all on <span>video</span> <span>games</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, it's his <span>first</span> <span>paycheck</span>, so I'm sure he <span>wants</span> to <span>spend</span> his own money.<br/>
🎧 I <span>understand</span> that. He <span>knows</span> he can <span>spend</span> it any way he <span>wants</span> to. I just want him to be able to learn how to <span>save</span> some too.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, I <span>totally</span> <span>understand</span>. My <span>first</span> son <span>spent</span> his <span>whole</span> <span>paycheck</span> each time. Now he doesn't have anything <span>saved</span>. My <span>second</span> son <span>saves</span> and <span>saves</span>.<br/>

🎧 Wow! <span>Does</span> your <span>younger</span> son <span>loan</span> him <span>money?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, but he <span>adds</span> on <span>interest</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's funny and <span>smart</span>. He's like a <span>bank</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>wants</span> to be a <span>banker</span> one day.<br/>
