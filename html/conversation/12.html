🎧 That's <span>amazing</span>! <span>We</span> <span>rarely</span> <span>travel</span> by <span>plane</span>. <span>I'd</span> <span>rather</span> <span>take</span> the <span>train.<br/></span>

🎧 <span>Why?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Well</span>, <span>we</span> <span>found</span> <span>bugs</span> <span>in</span> the <span>carpet</span> <span>in</span> one <span>room</span>. <span>We</span> had <span>already</span> <span>unpacked</span>.

🎧 That's <span>terrible</span>. Did you <span>finally</span> get a <span>good</span> <span>room?<br/></span>
