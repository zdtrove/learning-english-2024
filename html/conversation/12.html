🎧 <span>Billy</span>, are you all <span>packed?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>No</span>, Dad. I can't find my <span>fishing</span> <span>pole</span>.<br/>
🎧 Where did you see it <span>last?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>In</span> the <span>garage</span>. I'll look again.<br/>

🎧 <span>Hi</span> <span>Carol</span>. Have you <span>seen</span> any <span>airline</span> <span>deals</span> <span>lately?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hi</span> <span>Ruth</span>. <span>No</span>, I haven't. Are you <span>planning</span> a <span>trip?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>. <span>Stan</span> and I want to visit our <span>daughter</span> in <span>London</span>. She <span>moved</span> there last year.<br/>
🎧 <span>Why?<br/></span> 
🎧 Her job was <span>transferred</span> there.<br/>
🎧 <span>Does</span> she like <span>living</span> <span>there?<br/></span> 
🎧 She <span>loves</span> <span>living</span> in <span>England</span>. She <span>wants</span> us to visit, but the <span>airfare</span> is very <span>expensive</span>.<br/>
🎧 Have you <span>called</span> any <span>travel</span> <span>agencies</span>? <span>Sometimes</span> they have special <span>deals</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've <span>called</span> <span>travel</span> <span>agencies</span> and <span>looked</span> <span>online</span>, but <span>everything</span> is <span>expensive</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>, <span>airfare</span> is <span>getting</span> more and more <span>expensive</span> <span>every</span> year.<br/>
🎧 I know. You <span>travel</span> a lot. Where do you buy your <span>airplane</span> <span>tickets?<br/></span> 
🎧 My <span>traveling</span> is for work. My <span>company</span> <span>pays</span> for the <span>tickets</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's nice.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>. One of my <span>business</span> <span>trips</span> was to <span>Hawaii</span>. I got to fly in <span>First</span> <span>Class</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>amazing</span>! We <span>rarely</span> <span>travel</span> by <span>plane</span>. <span>I'd</span> <span>rather</span> take the <span>train</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, you can't take the <span>train</span> across the <span>ocean</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>wish</span> we <span>could.<br/>

🎧 Did you get a good <span>deal</span> on <span>it?<br/></span>

🎧 That's a good <span>deal</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>swimming</span> <span>pool</span> and <span>spa</span> were <span>really</span> nice too. The <span>swimming</span> <span>pool</span> was <span>warm</span>. There was also a <span>sauna</span>.<br/>

🎧 I love <span>chocolate</span> <span>cake</span>. I can't <span>wait</span> to try it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Thanks</span> for <span>letting</span> me know about the <span>party</span>.<br/>
🎧 There should be an <span>invitation</span> in your <span>mailbox</span>. <span>Everyone</span> <span>gets</span> one.<br/>
🎧 I better <span>check</span> the <span>mailbox</span> then. I still have so much <span>unpacking</span> to do.<br/>
🎧 Do you need help <span>moving</span> any more <span>furniture?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>No</span>. My <span>brother</span> <span>helped</span> me last <span>night</span>. I'm <span>done</span> with the big <span>items</span>. I just need to <span>unpack</span> <span>pots</span> and <span>pans</span> and <span>dishes</span> <span>now</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ok</span>. Let me know if you need help. See you at the <span>party.<br/>

🎧 <span>Hi</span> <span>Billy</span>, how was your <span>first</span> day at a new <span>school?<br/></span> 
🎧 It was ok, <span>Mom</span>.<br/>
🎧 Did you make any new <span>friends?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>. A boy in my <span>class</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is he nice? What's his <span>name?<br/></span> 
🎧 He's <span>cool</span>. His <span>name</span> is <span>Brian</span>. He <span>plays</span> <span>soccer</span>.<br/>
🎧 You love <span>soccer</span>. You were on the <span>soccer</span> <span>team</span> at your old school.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>, I <span>miss</span> my old <span>team</span> with <span>Ted</span>, <span>Mark</span>, and <span>Richard</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know you do. Do you want to <span>invite</span> <span>Brian</span> over to play one <span>day?<br/></span>

🎧 Do you want to <span>start</span> <span>riding</span> the school bus <span>too</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>. <span>Then</span> I can <span>meet</span> more of the <span>neighborhood</span> <span>kids</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ok</span>. Let's <span>plan</span> for you to <span>ride</span> the bus <span>tomorrow</span> <span>morning</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Brian</span> said the bus <span>comes</span> at <span>7:45</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Then</span> you need to <span>wake</span> up at <span>7</span> <span>o'clock</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know. I'll set my <span>alarm</span>. <span><br/></span>
