🎧 <span>Billy</span>, are you all <span>packed</span>?<br/> 
🎧 No, Dad. I can't find my <span>fishing</span> <span>pole</span>.<br/>
🎧 Where did you see it <span>last</span>?<br/> 
🎧 In the <span>garage</span>. I'll look again.<br/>
🎧 Ok. I'm almost done <span>packing</span> too. I just need to <span>load</span> the <span>tents</span> into the <span>car</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>found</span> my <span>fishing</span> <span>pole</span>. It was behind the <span>skis</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good. What is your mom <span>doing</span>?<br/> 
🎧 She is <span>packing</span> food and <span>snacks</span> into the ice <span>chest</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hopefully</span>, we will catch some <span>fish</span> to eat too.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. Dad, where is your <span>fishing</span> <span>pole</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I <span>forgot</span> it. Thanks for <span>reminding</span> me.<br/>
🎧 Are we going to the same <span>campsite</span>?<br/> 
🎧 No. I want to try a new place.<br/>
🎧 <span>Cool</span>. Can I <span>bring</span> my <span>camera</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Of course. But be <span>careful</span> not to <span>lose</span> it.<br/>
🎧 I'll be <span>careful</span>. I want to take a lot of <span>pictures</span>.<br/>
🎧 make sure to take <span>pictures</span> of our <span>fish</span>.<br/>
🎧 I hope we catch big <span>ones</span>. I love <span>camping</span> and <span>fishing</span>.<br/>
🎧 I love spending time as a <span>family

🎧 Hi <span>Carol</span>. Have you <span>seen</span> any <span>airline</span> <span>deals</span> <span>lately</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Hi <span>Ruth</span>. No, I haven't. Are you planning a <span>trip</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yeah. <span>Stan</span> and I want to visit our <span>daughter</span> in <span>London</span>. She <span>moved</span> there last year.<br/>
🎧 <span>Why</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Her job was <span>transferred</span> there.<br/>
🎧 Does she like living there?<br/> 
🎧 She <span>loves</span> living in <span>England</span>. She <span>wants</span> us to visit, but the <span>airfare</span> is very <span>expensive</span>.<br/>
🎧 Have you <span>called</span> any travel <span>agencies</span>? Sometimes they have special <span>deals</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've <span>called</span> travel <span>agencies</span> and <span>looked</span> online, but everything is <span>expensive</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, <span>airfare</span> is getting more and more <span>expensive</span> every year.<br/>
🎧 I know. You travel a lot. Where do you buy your <span>airplane</span> <span>tickets</span>?<br/> 
🎧 My <span>traveling</span> is for work. My <span>company</span> <span>pays</span> for the <span>tickets</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's nice.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. One of my <span>business</span> <span>trips</span> was to <span>Hawaii</span>. I got to fly in First <span>Class</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>amazing</span>! We <span>rarely</span> travel by <span>plane</span>. I'd rather take the <span>train</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, you can't take the <span>train</span> across the <span>ocean</span>.<br/>
🎧 I wish we <span>could

🎧 Hi <span>Sarah</span>. Yeah, it's <span>sunny</span> and <span>clear</span>. I think we're going to take our <span>boat</span> out.<br/>
🎧 It's a great day for it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Would</span> you and <span>Paul</span> like to join <span>us</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I would love to. I need to ask <span>Paul</span>. He's at the <span>store</span>. He should be home in a few <span>minutes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great! We can <span>pack</span> a lunch and eat on the <span>boat</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sounds like fun. I've never been on a <span>boat</span> before.<br/>
🎧 You haven't? Do you get <span>seasick</span>?<br/>

🎧 Do you get <span>airsick</span>? Do you have any kind of <span>motion</span> <span>sickness</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I don't think so. I don't get <span>sick</span> on <span>planes</span> or <span>trains</span> or long car <span>rides</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's good. <span>Then</span> you'll probably be ok on the <span>boat</span>.<br/>

🎧 Yes and there is a <span>reason</span> why.<br/>
🎧 What is <span>it</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Tom</span> and I took my friend out on our <span>boat</span> once and she got very <span>sick</span>. I <span>felt</span> <span>terrible</span> for her.<br/>
🎧 Oh, I see. I should be ok.<br/>
🎧 What about <span>Paul</span>?<br/> 
🎧 He used to be a <span>fisherman</span>. He is definitely not going to be <span>seasick

🎧 Hi <span>Alice</span>. How did you like the <span>hotel</span>?<br/> 
🎧 It was <span>lovely</span>, <span>Barbara</span>. The <span>rooms</span> were <span>spacious</span> and <span>clean</span>.<br/>
🎧 Did you get a good <span>deal</span> on <span>it</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yeah. They had an online special. If you <span>reserved</span> a <span>room</span> <span>three</span> <span>weeks</span> <span>early</span>, you got <span>20%</span> off the <span>regular</span> <span>room</span> <span>rate</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's a good <span>deal</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>swimming</span> <span>pool</span> and <span>spa</span> were really nice too. The <span>swimming</span> <span>pool</span> was <span>warm</span>. There was also a <span>sauna</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh, that's very nice. <span>Joe</span> <span>loves</span> <span>saunas</span>. I need to tell him about this place.<br/>
🎧 The <span>parking</span> is free and so is the <span>Wi-Fi</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's good to know.<br/>
🎧 There's a <span>shuttle</span> bus that takes you to the <span>downtown</span> <span>area</span> where all of the <span>shops</span> and <span>restaurants</span> are. It was very <span>convenient</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anything</span> <span>else</span>?<br/> 
🎧 The <span>concierge</span> was very <span>helpful</span> and the <span>front</span> <span>desk</span> <span>clerks</span> were very nice.<br/>
🎧 Sounds like it was a <span>wonderful</span> place to <span>stay</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was. I would <span>recommend</span> this place to everyone.<br/>
🎧 Is there a <span>restaurant</span> in the <span>hotel</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yes. They have great food. It's a little <span>expensive</span>, but very <span>delicious</span>. They have a <span>fantastic</span> <span>breakfast</span> <span>buffet</span> every morning too.<br/>
🎧 Wow! I'm definitely going to make a <span>reservation</span> here.<br/>

🎧 <span>Why</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Well, we <span>found</span> <span>bugs</span> in the <span>carpet</span> in one <span>room</span>. We had already <span>unpacked</span>. So, we had to <span>re-pack</span> everything and ask for another <span>room</span>.<br/>
🎧 What was wrong with the <span>second</span> <span>room</span>?<br/> 
🎧 We <span>paid</span> for a garden <span>room</span> and it was a <span>view</span> of the <span>parking</span> lot.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>terrible</span>. Did you <span>finally</span> get a good <span>room</span>?<br/>
