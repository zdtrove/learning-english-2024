🎧 <span>Hi</span>. How can I help you <span>today?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm <span>looking</span> for a <span>bike</span> for my <span>daughter</span>.<br/>
🎧 How old is your <span>daughter?<br/></span> 
🎧 She is <span>five</span> years old. This will be her <span>first</span> <span>bike</span>.<br/>
🎧 We have <span>lots</span> of <span>cute</span> <span>bikes</span> for <span>girls</span>. <span>Does</span> she like a <span>particular</span> <span>color?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yes</span>, her <span>favorite</span> <span>color</span> is <span>purple</span>.<br/>
🎧 We have a few <span>purple</span> <span>bikes</span>. Let me <span>show</span> you.<br/>
🎧 I <span>really</span> like this one. This has <span>stars</span> on it. She <span>loves</span> <span>stars</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Would</span> you like to add a <span>basket</span> to the <span>front</span> of the <span>bike?<br/></span> 
🎧 That would be <span>wonderful</span>. How much is this <span>bike?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>$50</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's a little more than I <span>wanted</span> to <span>spend</span>. Do you have <span>anything</span> <span>cheaper?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Unfortunately</span>, this is one of the <span>least</span> <span>expensive</span> <span>bikes</span> we have.<br/>
🎧 I <span>see</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>bike</span> has an <span>adjustable</span> <span>height</span>. So, it will <span>grow</span> a few <span>inches</span> as your <span>child</span> <span>grows</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's a <span>great</span> <span>feature</span>. I think I will buy it. What is your <span>return</span> <span>policy?<br/></span> 
🎧 We have a <span>100%</span> <span>money-back</span> <span>guarantee</span>.<br/>
🎧 What <span>does</span> that <span>mean?<br/></span> 
🎧 You can <span>return</span> it for a full <span>refund</span> if you are not <span>satisfied</span> with the <span>product.<br/>
</span> <span><br/></span>

🎧 <span>No</span>. Can you help me find <span>something</span> for your <span>cousin</span>? What <span>does</span> he <span>like?<br/></span> 
🎧 This toy <span>helicopter</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think that's what you like.<br/>
🎧 He'll like it <span>too</span>.<br/>
🎧 Are you <span>sure?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>. He and I like the same <span>things</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ok</span>. Let's get him that <span>helicopter</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can play with it at his house. <span>If</span> I like it, then can I get one, <span>too?<br/></span>

🎧 <span>I'd</span> like a <span>ham</span> and <span>cheese</span> <span>omelet</span>.<br/>
🎧 That <span>sounds</span> good. Do we have all of the <span>ingredients?<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, we only need <span>eggs</span>, <span>ham</span>, and <span>cheese</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think we may be out of <span>ham</span>. I used the last few <span>slices</span> for a <span>sandwich</span> <span>yesterday</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ok</span>. How about a <span>vegetable</span> <span>omelet?<br/></span> 
🎧 That's good too. We have <span>green</span> <span>peppers</span>, <span>mushrooms</span>, and <span>onions</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>perfect</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Great</span>! I'll <span>brew</span> some <span>coffee</span> and you make the <span>omelet</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't know how to make an <span>omelet</span>.<br/>
🎧 You don't? Well, I don't <span>either</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's just go to the new <span>diner</span>.<br/>
🎧 That <span>sounds</span> like a better <span>plan</span>.
