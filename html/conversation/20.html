🎧 Hi. How can I help you <span>today?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm <span>looking</span> for a <span>bike</span> for my <span>daughter</span>.<br/>
🎧 How old is your <span>daughter?<br/></span> 
🎧 She is <span>five</span> years old. This will be her first <span>bike</span>.<br/>
🎧 We have <span>lots</span> of <span>cute</span> <span>bikes</span> for <span>girls</span>. Does she like a <span>particular</span> <span>color?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, her <span>favorite</span> color is <span>purple</span>.<br/>
🎧 We have a few <span>purple</span> <span>bikes</span>. Let me <span>show</span> you.<br/>
🎧 I really like this one. This has <span>stars</span> on it. She <span>loves</span> <span>stars</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Would</span> you like to add a <span>basket</span> to the <span>front</span> of the <span>bike?<br/></span> 
🎧 That would be <span>wonderful</span>. How much is this <span>bike?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>$50</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's a little more than I <span>wanted</span> to <span>spend</span>. Do you have anything <span>cheaper?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Unfortunately</span>, this is one of the <span>least</span> <span>expensive</span> <span>bikes</span> we have.<br/>
🎧 I <span>see</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>bike</span> has an <span>adjustable</span> <span>height</span>. So, it will <span>grow</span> a few <span>inches</span> as your <span>child</span> <span>grows</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's a great <span>feature</span>. I think I will buy it. What is your <span>return</span> <span>policy?<br/></span> 
🎧 We have a <span>100%</span> <span>money-back</span> <span>guarantee</span>.<br/>
🎧 What does that <span>mean?<br/></span> 
🎧 You can <span>return</span> it for a full <span>refund</span> if you are not <span>satisfied</span> with the <span>product.<br/>

🎧 Please, <span>Mom</span>.<br/>
🎧 No. Can you help me find something for your <span>cousin</span>? What does he <span>like?<br/></span> 
🎧 This toy <span>helicopter</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think that's what you like.<br/>
🎧 He'll like it too.<br/>
🎧 Are you <span>sure?<br/></span>
