🎧 Hi <span>Susie</span>. Where are you going? Are you taking a <span>trip</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, I'm going to <span>Chicago</span>. My <span>sister</span> just had a <span>baby</span>. I'm going to be <span>helping</span> her for a <span>couple</span> of <span>weeks</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's so nice of you. Did she have a boy or a girl?<br/> 
🎧 A girl. Her name is <span>Rose</span>.<br/>
🎧 What a <span>beautiful</span> <span>name</span>!<br/> 
🎧 Yeah. She is <span>named</span> after our <span>grandmother</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>daughter</span> is also <span>named</span> after my <span>grandmother</span>. Her name is <span>Marie</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's also a <span>beautiful</span> name.<br/>
🎧 Thanks. Is this your <span>sister's</span> first <span>child</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yeah. This is my first <span>niece</span> too. She's also the first <span>grandchild</span> in the <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 How <span>special</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I know. My <span>mother</span> is so <span>excited</span>. She's only lives a few <span>blocks</span> away from my <span>sister</span>. So, she will be <span>helping</span> a lot too.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>wonderful</span>. It's nice to have a lot of help with your first <span>child</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. I agree. Well, I better go now. I have to be at the <span>airport</span> by <span>1</span> pm.<br/>
🎧 Ok. See you in two <span>weeks
</span>.<br/> <br/>

🎧 Hi <span>Carol</span>. Did you get a new <span>car</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Hi <span>Jane</span>. No, this is a <span>rental</span> car. I was in an <span>auto</span> <span>accident</span> <span>yesterday</span>.<br/>
🎧 Are you <span>ok</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yeah. My back <span>hurts</span> a little, but <span>luckily</span> I wasn't <span>seriously</span> <span>injured</span>.<br/>
🎧 Did you go to the <span>hospital</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yeah. I went there this morning. The <span>doctor</span> took some did <span>x-rays</span>. <span>Nothing</span> is <span>serious</span>. I just have some <span>bruises</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm glad you are ok. Was there another car <span>involved</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, the other <span>driver</span> <span>rear-ended</span> me at a red <span>light</span>.<br/>
🎧 Wow! Is he or she <span>ok</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yeah. He <span>seemed</span> ok at the <span>scene</span>.<br/>
🎧 This could've been a <span>serious</span> <span>accident</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know. We were both <span>lucky</span>.<br/>
🎧 Where is your car? Is it getting <span>fixed</span>?<br/> 
🎧 No. It's too <span>damaged</span> to be <span>repaired</span>. It's at the <span>junkyard</span> now.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>terrible</span>. Is your <span>insurance</span> going to pay for a new <span>car</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Well, it was the other <span>driver's</span> <span>fault</span>, so his <span>insurance</span> is going to take <span>care</span> of it.<br/>
🎧 That's good. Are you going to buy the same <span>type</span> of <span>car</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I think so. I loved that car. It <span>protected</span> me in this <span>accident

🎧 Hi <span>Mary</span>. What's <span>wrong</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Oh hi <span>Alice</span>. I just got back from the <span>hospital</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is something <span>wrong</span>?<br/> 
🎧 My son was in an <span>auto</span> <span>accident</span> last <span>night</span>.<br/>
🎧 Oh <span>dear</span>. I'm <span>sorry</span> to hear that. Was he <span>seriously</span> <span>injured</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yes. He <span>broke</span> both of his <span>legs</span> and his <span>ribs</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>awful</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I know. He just got his <span>driver's</span> <span>license</span> a <span>month</span> <span>ago</span>.<br/>
🎧 How <span>scary</span> for him.<br/>
🎧 It wasn't his <span>fault</span> though. He was hit by a <span>drunk</span> <span>driver</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>terrible</span>!<br/> 
🎧 I'm so <span>angry</span> about it! My son could've been <span>killed</span> by an <span>irresponsible</span> <span>driver</span>.<br/>
🎧 You're right! Did they catch the other <span>driver</span>? Was he or she <span>injured</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, he was <span>arrested</span>. He wasn't <span>injured</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you think he will go to <span>jail</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I don't know. I'm just <span>worried</span> about my son right now.<br/>
🎧 Can I help you with <span>anything</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Well, I just came home to get a change of <span>clothes</span>. I'm going to go back to the <span>hospital</span> soon. <span>Would</span> you be able to <span>feed</span> our <span>cats</span> <span>tonight</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Of course. Please let me know if there is anything else I can help you with.<br/>

🎧 Why are you so <span>late</span>?<br/> 
🎧 There was big <span>accident</span> on the <span>freeway</span>. The <span>police</span> <span>closed</span> all the <span>lanes</span>. We had to take a <span>detour</span>.<br/>
🎧 Was <span>anyone</span> <span>hurt</span>?<br/>

🎧 I don't know. I didn't see it <span>happen</span>.<br/>
🎧 You should've <span>called</span> me. We were <span>supposed</span> to <span>meet</span> <span>Cathy</span> and <span>Rick</span> for dinner at <span>6</span> pm.<br/>
🎧 After <span>seeing</span> the <span>accident</span>, I didn't want to use my phone while driving.<br/>

🎧 Hey <span>Stan</span>. Do you know any good <span>mechanics</span> around here?<br/> 
🎧 Yeah. I use a really good one. What's wrong with your <span>car</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I'm not sure. I think there is a <span>problem</span> with my <span>transmission</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Transmission</span> <span>problems</span> can be very <span>expensive</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know. I took it to an <span>auto</span> <span>shop</span> <span>yesterday</span> and it was so <span>expensive</span>. I'm <span>looking</span> for someone <span>cheaper</span>, but who can also do a good job.<br/>
🎧 You should go to my <span>mechanic</span>. You can <span>trust</span> him and his <span>repair</span> <span>costs</span> are <span>pretty</span> <span>reasonable</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is he <span>close</span> to <span>us</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yeah. His <span>shop</span> is just a few <span>blocks</span> away.<br/>
🎧 That's good. I hope I don't have to <span>replace</span> the <span>transmission</span>. That will be really <span>expensive</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know. I had to <span>replace</span> the <span>transmission</span> on my old car. The <span>repair</span> <span>cost</span> more than the <span>price</span> of the <span>car</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>crazy</span>! If my <span>repair</span> <span>costs</span> too much, I'm just going to buy a new <span>car</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can you <span>afford</span> a new <span>car</span>?<br/> 
🎧 No. I would have to buy a used <span>car</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let me get my <span>mechanic's</span> phone <span>number</span>. You can decide what you want to do after he takes a look at your <span>car</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 I can give you a <span>ride</span> home if you need to leave your car there.<br/>
🎧 If it's only a few <span>blocks</span> away, I'll <span>walk</span>. If my car is too <span>expensive</span> to fix, I better get used to <span>walking

🎧 He doesn't know? What is he doing then?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Trying</span> all different things. I'm getting <span>tired</span> of <span>waiting</span> for him to fix it.<br/>
🎧 You should take it to another <span>mechanic</span>.<br/>
🎧 I should, but I already <span>paid</span> him. He just <span>keeps</span> saying he will fix it.<br/>
🎧 He doesn't sound very <span>trustworthy</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know. I should've <span>gone</span> somewhere else. But he was so <span>cheap</span>. He was the <span>cheapest</span> I could find.<br/>
🎧 Maybe too <span>cheap</span> isn't always better.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>learning</span> that now.<br/>

🎧 You can <span>carpool</span> with someone.<br/>
