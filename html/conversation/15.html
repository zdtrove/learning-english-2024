🎧 <span>Hi</span> <span>Carol</span>. Did you get a new <span>car?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hi</span> <span>Jane</span>. <span>No</span>, <span>this</span> <span>is</span> a <span>rental</span> car. I was <span>in</span> an <span>auto</span> <span>accident</span> <span>yesterday</span> .<br/>
🎧 Are you <span>ok?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>. My <span>back</span> <span>hurts</span> a <span>little</span>, but <span>luckily</span> I wasn't <span>seriously</span> <span>injured</span> .<br/>
🎧 Did you <span>go</span> to the <span>hospital?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>. I <span>went</span> there <span>this</span> <span>morning</span>. The <span>doctor</span> <span>took</span> <span>some</span> did <span>x-rays</span>. <span>Nothing</span> <span>is</span> <span>serious</span>. I <span>just</span> have <span>some</span> <span>bruises</span> .<br/>
🎧 <span>I'm</span> <span>glad</span> you are <span>ok</span>. Was there <span>another</span> car <span>involved?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>, the <span>other</span> <span>driver</span> <span>rear-ended</span> me <span>at</span> a red <span>light</span> .<br/>
🎧 Wow! <span>Is</span> <span>he</span> <span>or</span> she <span>ok?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>. <span>He</span> <span>seemed</span> <span>ok</span> <span>at</span> the <span>scene</span> .<br/>
🎧 <span>This</span> could've <span>been</span> a <span>serious</span> <span>accident</span> .<br/>
🎧 I <span>know</span>. <span>We</span> <span>were</span> <span>both</span> <span>lucky</span> .<br/>
🎧 Where <span>is</span> your car? <span>Is</span> <span>it</span> <span>getting</span> <span>fixed?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>No</span>. It's too <span>damaged</span> to be <span>repaired</span>. It's <span>at</span> the <span>junkyard</span> <span>now</span> .<br/>
🎧 That's <span>terrible</span>. <span>Is</span> your <span>insurance</span> <span>going</span> to pay for a new <span>car?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Well</span>, <span>it</span> was the <span>other</span> <span>driver's</span> <span>fault</span>, so his <span>insurance</span> <span>is</span> <span>going</span> to <span>take</span> <span>care</span> <span>of</span> <span>it</span> .<br/>
🎧 That's <span>good</span>. Are you <span>going</span> to buy the <span>same</span> <span>type</span> <span>of</span> <span>car?<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>think</span> so. I <span>loved</span> <span>that</span> car. <span>It</span> <span>protected</span> me <span>in</span> <span>this</span> <span>accident.<br/>

🎧 Why are you so <span>late?<br/></span> 
🎧 There was big <span>accident</span> <span>on</span> the <span>freeway</span>. The <span>police</span> <span>closed</span> all the <span>lanes</span>. <span>We</span> had to <span>take</span> a <span>detour</span> .<br/>

🎧 I <span>think</span> so. I saw two <span>ambulances</span> and a <span>fire</span> <span>truck</span> <span>driving</span> <span>by</span> .<br/>

🎧 I don't <span>know</span>. I didn't see <span>it</span> <span>happen</span> .<br/>

🎧 Hey <span>Stan</span>. Do you <span>know</span> any <span>good</span> <span>mechanics</span> <span>around</span> <span>here?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>. I use a <span>really</span> <span>good</span> one. What's <span>wrong</span> <span>with</span> your <span>car?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>I'm</span> not <span>sure</span>. I <span>think</span> there <span>is</span> a <span>problem</span> <span>with</span> my <span>transmission</span> .<br/>
🎧 <span>Transmission</span> <span>problems</span> can be <span>very</span> <span>expensive</span> .<br/>
🎧 I <span>know</span>. I <span>took</span> <span>it</span> to an <span>auto</span> <span>shop</span> <span>yesterday</span> and <span>it</span> was so <span>expensive</span>. <span>I'm</span> <span>looking</span> for <span>someone</span> <span>cheaper</span>, but who can <span>also</span> do a <span>good</span> <span>job</span> .<br/>
🎧 You <span>should</span> <span>go</span> to my <span>mechanic</span>. You can <span>trust</span> him and his <span>repair</span> <span>costs</span> are <span>pretty</span> <span>reasonable</span> .<br/>
🎧 <span>Is</span> <span>he</span> <span>close</span> to <span>us?<br/></span>

🎧 That's <span>good</span>. I <span>hope</span> I don't have to <span>replace</span> the <span>transmission</span>. <span>That</span> <span>will</span> be <span>really</span> <span>expensive</span> .<br/>
🎧 I <span>know</span>. I had to <span>replace</span> the <span>transmission</span> <span>on</span> my old car. The <span>repair</span> <span>cost</span> <span>more</span> <span>than</span> the <span>price</span> <span>of</span> the <span>car</span> .<br/>
🎧 That's <span>crazy</span>! <span>If</span> my <span>repair</span> <span>costs</span> too <span>much</span>, <span>I'm</span> <span>just</span> <span>going</span> to buy a new <span>car</span> .<br/>
🎧 Can you <span>afford</span> a new <span>car?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>No</span>. I <span>would</span> have to buy a <span>used</span> <span>car</span> .<br/>
🎧 Let me get my <span>mechanic's</span> <span>phone</span> <span>number</span>. You can <span>decide</span> what you <span>want</span> to do <span>after</span> <span>he</span> <span>takes</span> a <span>look</span> <span>at</span> your <span>car</span> .<br/>

They're a <span>little</span> <span>more</span> <span>expensive</span> <span>than</span> <span>other</span> <span>places</span>, but <span>their</span> <span>work</span> and <span>service</span> <span>is</span> <span>excellent</span> .<br/>

🎧 Hey <span>Ben</span>, have you <span>seen</span> the <span>price</span> <span>of</span> gas <span>lately?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span> <span>Mike</span>. It's <span>really</span> <span>high</span>. That's why I've <span>been</span> <span>riding</span> the bus to <span>work</span> .<br/>
🎧 I <span>wish</span> I <span>could</span> <span>ride</span> the bus, but I <span>would</span> have to <span>take</span> <span>three</span> <span>buses</span> to get to <span>work</span> .<br/>
🎧 <span>Three?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>. <span>It</span> <span>would</span> <span>take</span> me <span>twice</span> <span>as</span> <span>long</span> to get to <span>work</span> .<br/>
🎧 That's not <span>good</span>. I <span>only</span> have to <span>take</span> one bus and <span>it</span> <span>takes</span> me <span>directly</span> <span>from</span> my <span>home</span> to my <span>office</span> <span>building</span> .<br/>
🎧 You're <span>lucky!<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>know</span>. What <span>about</span> <span>riding</span> your <span>bike</span> to <span>work?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>No</span>, <span>I'm</span> not <span>very</span> <span>good</span> <span>at</span> <span>cycling</span> and it's too <span>far</span> .<br/>
🎧 You can <span>carpool</span> <span>with</span> <span>someone</span> .<br/>
🎧 That's a <span>good</span> <span>idea</span>. <span>Then</span> <span>we</span> <span>could</span> <span>share</span> the <span>cost</span> <span>of</span> gas and <span>ride</span> <span>in</span> the <span>carpool</span> <span>lane</span> .<br/>
🎧 Do you <span>work</span> <span>with</span> <span>anyone</span> who <span>lives</span> <span>near</span> <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>, my <span>boss</span> .<br/>
🎧 <span>Would</span> you <span>want</span> to <span>ride</span> <span>with</span> your <span>boss?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>No</span>, not <span>really</span>. I <span>think</span> <span>I'd</span> <span>rather</span> pay <span>more</span> for <span>gas.<br/>
