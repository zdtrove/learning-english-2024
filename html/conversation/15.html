🎧 <span>Hi</span> <span>Susie</span>. Where are you going? Are you <span>taking</span> a <span>trip?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>, I'm going to <span>Chicago</span>. My <span>sister</span> just had a <span>baby</span>. I'm going to be <span>helping</span> her for a <span>couple</span> of <span>weeks</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's so nice of you. Did she have a boy or a <span>girl?<br/></span> 
🎧 A <span>girl</span>. Her <span>name</span> is <span>Rose</span>.<br/>
🎧 What a <span>beautiful</span> <span>name!<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>. She is <span>named</span> after our <span>grandmother</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>daughter</span> is also <span>named</span> after my <span>grandmother</span>. Her <span>name</span> is <span>Marie</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's also a <span>beautiful</span> <span>name</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks. Is this your <span>sister's</span> <span>first</span> <span>child?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>. This is my <span>first</span> <span>niece</span> too. She's also the <span>first</span> <span>grandchild</span> in the <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 How <span>special!<br/></span> 
🎧 I know. My <span>mother</span> is so <span>excited</span>. She's only <span>lives</span> a few <span>blocks</span> away from my <span>sister</span>. So, she will be <span>helping</span> a lot <span>too</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>wonderful</span>. It's nice to have a lot of help with your <span>first</span> <span>child</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>. I <span>agree</span>. Well, I better go now. I have to be at the <span>airport</span> by <span>1</span> <span>pm</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ok</span>. See you in two <span>weeks.<br/>

🎧 <span>Hi</span> <span>Carol</span>. Did you get a new <span>car?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hi</span> <span>Jane</span>. <span>No</span>, this is a <span>rental</span> car. I was in an <span>auto</span> <span>accident</span> <span>yesterday</span>.<br/>
🎧 Are you <span>ok?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>. My back <span>hurts</span> a little, but <span>luckily</span> I wasn't <span>seriously</span> <span>injured</span>.<br/>
🎧 Did you go to the <span>hospital?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>. I <span>went</span> there this <span>morning</span>. The <span>doctor</span> took some did <span>x-rays</span>. <span>Nothing</span> is <span>serious</span>. I just have some <span>bruises</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>glad</span> you are ok. Was there <span>another</span> car <span>involved?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>, the other <span>driver</span> <span>rear-ended</span> me at a red <span>light</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>Yeah</span>. He <span>seemed</span> ok at the <span>scene</span>.<br/>
🎧 This could've been a <span>serious</span> <span>accident</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know. We were both <span>lucky</span>.<br/>
🎧 Where is your car? Is it <span>getting</span> <span>fixed?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>No</span>. It's too <span>damaged</span> to be <span>repaired</span>. It's at the <span>junkyard</span> <span>now</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>terrible</span>. Is your <span>insurance</span> going to pay for a new <span>car?<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, it was the other <span>driver's</span> <span>fault</span>, so his <span>insurance</span> is going to take <span>care</span> of it.<br/>
🎧 That's good. Are you going to buy the same <span>type</span> of <span>car?<br/></span>

🎧 <span>Oh</span> <span>hi</span> <span>Alice</span>. I just got back from the <span>hospital</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is something <span>wrong?<br/></span> 
🎧 My son was in an <span>auto</span> <span>accident</span> last <span>night</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>Yes</span>. He <span>broke</span> both of his <span>legs</span> and his <span>ribs</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>awful!<br/></span> 
🎧 I know. He just got his <span>driver's</span> <span>license</span> a <span>month</span> <span>ago</span>.<br/>
🎧 How <span>scary</span> for him.<br/>
🎧 It wasn't his <span>fault</span> <span>though</span>. He was hit by a <span>drunk</span> <span>driver</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>terrible!<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm so <span>angry</span> about it! My son could've been <span>killed</span> by an <span>irresponsible</span> <span>driver</span>.<br/>
🎧 You're right! Did they <span>catch</span> the other <span>driver</span>? Was he or she <span>injured?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>, he was <span>arrested</span>. He wasn't <span>injured</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you think he will go to <span>jail?<br/></span> 
🎧 I don't know. I'm just <span>worried</span> about my son right <span>now</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can I help you with <span>anything?<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, I just <span>came</span> home to get a <span>change</span> of <span>clothes</span>. I'm going to go back to the <span>hospital</span> soon. <span>Would</span> you be <span>able</span> to <span>feed</span> our <span>cats</span> <span>tonight?<br/></span>

🎧 Why are you so <span>late?<br/></span> 
🎧 There was big <span>accident</span> on the <span>freeway</span>. The <span>police</span> <span>closed</span> all the <span>lanes</span>. We had to take a <span>detour</span>.<br/>

🎧 Hey <span>Stan</span>. Do you know any good <span>mechanics</span> around <span>here?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>. I use a <span>really</span> good one. What's <span>wrong</span> with your <span>car?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm not sure. I think there is a <span>problem</span> with my <span>transmission</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Transmission</span> <span>problems</span> can be very <span>expensive</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know. I took it to an <span>auto</span> <span>shop</span> <span>yesterday</span> and it was so <span>expensive</span>. I'm <span>looking</span> for <span>someone</span> <span>cheaper</span>, but who can also do a good job.<br/>
🎧 You should go to my <span>mechanic</span>. You can <span>trust</span> him and his <span>repair</span> <span>costs</span> are <span>pretty</span> <span>reasonable</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is he <span>close</span> to <span>us?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>. His <span>shop</span> is just a few <span>blocks</span> away.<br/>
🎧 That's good. I hope I don't have to <span>replace</span> the <span>transmission</span>. That will be <span>really</span> <span>expensive</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know. I had to <span>replace</span> the <span>transmission</span> on my old car. The <span>repair</span> <span>cost</span> more than the <span>price</span> of the <span>car</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>crazy</span>! <span>If</span> my <span>repair</span> <span>costs</span> too much, I'm just going to buy a new <span>car</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can you <span>afford</span> a new <span>car?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>No</span>. I would have to buy a used <span>car</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let me get my <span>mechanic's</span> <span>phone</span> <span>number</span>. You can <span>decide</span> what you want to do after he takes a look at your <span>car</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 I can give you a <span>ride</span> home if you need to <span>leave</span> your car there.<br/>
🎧 <span>If</span> it's only a few <span>blocks</span> away, I'll <span>walk</span>. <span>If</span> my car is too <span>expensive</span> to fix, I better get used to <span>walking.<br/>

🎧 You should take it to <span>another</span> <span>mechanic</span>.<br/>
🎧 I should, but I <span>already</span> <span>paid</span> him. He just <span>keeps</span> saying he will fix it.<br/>
🎧 He doesn't sound very <span>trustworthy</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know. I should've <span>gone</span> <span>somewhere</span> else. But he was so <span>cheap</span>. He was the <span>cheapest</span> I <span>could</span> find.<br/>

🎧 My son is <span>taking</span> his <span>driver's</span> <span>license</span> <span>test</span> <span>today</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is he <span>nervous?<br/></span> 
🎧 He's a little <span>nervous</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>normal</span> to be <span>nervous</span>.<br/>
🎧 I told him that. He just <span>wants</span> to <span>pass</span> the <span>test</span>, so he can start driving to school.<br/>
🎧 <span>Does</span> he have a <span>car?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>No</span>, he has to share with my <span>wife</span>.<br/>
🎧 Are you going to get him a <span>car?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>No</span>, not yet. <span>First</span>, he has to <span>show</span> us that he is a <span>responsible</span> <span>driver</span>.<br/>
🎧 Did your <span>auto</span> <span>insurance</span> go up a <span>lot?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yes</span>! Our <span>insurance</span> <span>rate</span> <span>doubled</span>.<br/>
🎧 Wow! Are you <span>serious?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yes</span>, that's what <span>makes</span> me <span>nervous</span>. I don't know how we'll be <span>able</span> to <span>afford</span> <span>insurance</span> when my <span>younger</span> son <span>starts</span> to drive.<br/>
🎧 When will that <span>be?<br/></span> 
🎧 In two years.<br/>
🎧 <span>Better</span> start <span>saving</span> or better have your <span>sons</span> get <span>part-time</span> <span>jobs</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think I like the <span>part-time</span> job <span>idea</span> <span>better.<br/></span>
