🎧 Hi <span>Susie</span>. Where are you going? Are you taking a <span>trip?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, I'm going to <span>Chicago</span>. My <span>sister</span> just had a <span>baby</span>. I'm going to be <span>helping</span> her for a <span>couple</span> of <span>weeks</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's so nice of you. Did she have a boy or a <span>girl?<br/></span> 
🎧 A <span>girl</span>. Her <span>name</span> is <span>Rose</span>.<br/>
🎧 What a <span>beautiful</span> <span>name!<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah. She is <span>named</span> after our <span>grandmother</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>daughter</span> is also <span>named</span> after my <span>grandmother</span>. Her <span>name</span> is <span>Marie</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's also a <span>beautiful</span> <span>name</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks. Is this your <span>sister's</span> first <span>child?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah. This is my first <span>niece</span> too. She's also the first <span>grandchild</span> in the <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 How <span>special!<br/></span> 
🎧 I know. My <span>mother</span> is so <span>excited</span>. She's only lives a few <span>blocks</span> away from my <span>sister</span>. So, she will be <span>helping</span> a lot too.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>wonderful</span>. It's nice to have a lot of help with your first <span>child</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. I agree. Well, I better go now. I have to be at the <span>airport</span> by <span>1</span> <span>pm</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ok. See you in two <span>weeks.<br/>

🎧 Hi <span>Carol</span>. Did you get a new <span>car?<br/></span> 
🎧 Hi <span>Jane</span>. No, this is a <span>rental</span> car. I was in an <span>auto</span> <span>accident</span> <span>yesterday</span>.<br/>
🎧 Are you <span>ok?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah. My back <span>hurts</span> a little, but <span>luckily</span> I wasn't <span>seriously</span> <span>injured</span>.<br/>
🎧 Did you go to the <span>hospital?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah. I went there this morning. The <span>doctor</span> took some did <span>x-rays</span>. <span>Nothing</span> is <span>serious</span>. I just have some <span>bruises</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm glad you are ok. Was there another car <span>involved?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah, the other <span>driver</span> <span>rear-ended</span> me at a red <span>light</span>.<br/>
🎧 Wow! Is he or she <span>ok?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah. He <span>seemed</span> ok at the <span>scene</span>.<br/>
🎧 This could've been a <span>serious</span> <span>accident</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know. We were both <span>lucky</span>.<br/>
🎧 Where is your car? Is it getting <span>fixed?<br/></span> 
🎧 No. It's too <span>damaged</span> to be <span>repaired</span>. It's at the <span>junkyard</span> now.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>terrible</span>. Is your <span>insurance</span> going to pay for a new <span>car?<br/></span> 
🎧 Well, it was the other <span>driver's</span> <span>fault</span>, so his <span>insurance</span> is going to take <span>care</span> of it.<br/>
🎧 That's good. Are you going to buy the same <span>type</span> of <span>car?<br/></span> 
🎧 I think so. I loved that car. It <span>protected</span> me in this <span>accident.<br/>

🎧 Is something <span>wrong?<br/></span> 
🎧 My son was in an <span>auto</span> <span>accident</span> last <span>night</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh</span> <span>dear</span>. I'm <span>sorry</span> to hear that. Was he <span>seriously</span> <span>injured?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes. He <span>broke</span> both of his <span>legs</span> and his <span>ribs</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>awful!<br/></span> 
🎧 I know. He just got his <span>driver's</span> <span>license</span> a <span>month</span> <span>ago</span>.<br/>

🎧 It wasn't his <span>fault</span> though. He was hit by a <span>drunk</span> <span>driver</span>.<br/>

🎧 Of course. Please let me know if there is anything else I can help you with.<br/>

🎧 Why are you so <span>late?<br/></span> 
🎧 There was big <span>accident</span> on the <span>freeway</span>. The <span>police</span> <span>closed</span> all the <span>lanes</span>. We had to take a <span>detour</span>.<br/>
🎧 Was <span>anyone</span> <span>hurt?<br/></span>

🎧 Hey <span>Stan</span>. Do you know any good <span>mechanics</span> around <span>here?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah. I use a really good one. What's wrong with your <span>car?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm not sure. I think there is a <span>problem</span> with my <span>transmission</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Transmission</span> <span>problems</span> can be very <span>expensive</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know. I took it to an <span>auto</span> <span>shop</span> <span>yesterday</span> and it was so <span>expensive</span>. I'm <span>looking</span> for <span>someone</span> <span>cheaper</span>, but who can also do a good job.<br/>
🎧 You should go to my <span>mechanic</span>. You can <span>trust</span> him and his <span>repair</span> <span>costs</span> are <span>pretty</span> <span>reasonable</span>.<br/>
🎧 Is he <span>close</span> to <span>us?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah. His <span>shop</span> is just a few <span>blocks</span> away.<br/>
🎧 That's good. I hope I don't have to <span>replace</span> the <span>transmission</span>. That will be really <span>expensive</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know. I had to <span>replace</span> the <span>transmission</span> on my old car. The <span>repair</span> <span>cost</span> more than the <span>price</span> of the <span>car</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>crazy</span>! If my <span>repair</span> <span>costs</span> too much, I'm just going to buy a new <span>car</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can you <span>afford</span> a new <span>car?<br/></span> 
🎧 No. I would have to buy a used <span>car</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let me get my <span>mechanic's</span> phone <span>number</span>. You can decide what you want to do after he takes a look at your <span>car</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks.<br/>
🎧 I can give you a <span>ride</span> home if you need to <span>leave</span> your car there.<br/>
🎧 If it's only a few <span>blocks</span> away, I'll <span>walk</span>. If my car is too <span>expensive</span> to fix, I better get used to <span>walking.<br/>

🎧 <span>Trying</span> all different things. I'm getting <span>tired</span> of <span>waiting</span> for him to fix it.<br/>
🎧 You should take it to another <span>mechanic</span>.<br/>
🎧 I should, but I <span>already</span> <span>paid</span> him. He just <span>keeps</span> saying he will fix it.<br/>
🎧 He doesn't sound very <span>trustworthy</span>.<br/>

🎧 Did your <span>auto</span> <span>insurance</span> go up a <span>lot?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes! Our <span>insurance</span> <span>rate</span> <span>doubled</span>.<br/>
🎧 Wow! Are you <span>serious?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes, that's what makes me <span>nervous</span>. I don't know how we'll be able to <span>afford</span> <span>insurance</span> when my <span>younger</span> son <span>starts</span> to drive.<br/>
🎧 When will that <span>be?<br/></span> 
🎧 In two years.<br/>
🎧 <span>Better</span> start <span>saving</span> or better have your <span>sons</span> get <span>part-time</span> <span>jobs</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think I like the <span>part-time</span> job idea <span>better.<br/></span>
