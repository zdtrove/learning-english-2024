🎧 Hey <span>Joe</span>. Have you <span>seen</span> <span>Sandy?<br/></span> 
🎧 No, <span>Bill</span>. <span>Why?<br/></span> 
🎧 We had a <span>misunderstanding</span> and she is not talking to me.<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh</span>. I'm <span>sorry</span> to hear that.<br/>
🎧 Yeah. I said something <span>silly</span> and <span>hurt</span> her <span>feelings</span>.<br/>
🎧 What did you <span>say?<br/></span> 
🎧 It's not <span>important</span>. I don't want to <span>discuss</span> it. I just want to <span>apologize</span> to her.<br/>
🎧 She always <span>hangs</span> out at <span>Linda's</span> house or the <span>library</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've <span>already</span> <span>checked</span> both <span>places</span>.<br/>
🎧 How about her house.<br/>
🎧 Her <span>roommate</span> said she wasn't home.<br/>
🎧 Have you <span>called</span> her <span>cell</span> phone.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, <span>several</span> <span>times</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>must</span> really be mad at you.<br/>
🎧 She was! She <span>stormed</span> off and I didn't get to <span>explain</span> what I <span>meant</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm really <span>curious</span> now. What did you say to <span>her?<br/></span> 
🎧 I told her to <span>exercise</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, that probably wasn't a <span>smart</span> thing to say to a <span>woman</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>meant</span> that she should <span>exercise</span> to <span>stay</span> <span>healthy</span>.<br/>
🎧 That sounds better. <span>Hope</span> you find <span>her.<br/>

🎧 Hi <span>Sally</span>. What are you doing <span>here?<br/></span> 
🎧 Hey <span>Susie</span>. I need to buy my <span>sister</span> a new <span>necklace</span>. I <span>accidentally</span> <span>lost</span> her <span>necklace</span> and she is really mad at me now.<br/>
🎧 But you said it was an <span>accident</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, but I didn't ask if I could <span>borrow</span> it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh</span>, that's not good.<br/>
🎧 She wasn't home and it <span>looked</span> nice with my <span>outfit</span>, so I <span>wore</span> it.<br/>
🎧 That's like <span>stealing</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know. I feel <span>terrible</span>. I was going to put it back when I got home.<br/>
🎧 How did you <span>lose</span> <span>it?<br/></span> 
🎧 I don't know. I was on my way home and I <span>noticed</span> it was <span>gone</span>.<br/>
🎧 Was it an <span>expensive</span> <span>necklace?<br/></span> 
🎧 I don't know. I'm <span>looking</span> for a <span>replacement</span> here.<br/>
🎧 What does it look <span>like?<br/></span> 
🎧 It's a <span>gold</span> <span>butterfly</span>.<br/>
🎧 Like this <span>one?<br/></span> 
🎧 That's it! That's exactly like <span>hers</span>? How much is <span>it?<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>price</span> tag <span>says</span> <span>$100</span>.<br/>
🎧 Wow! That's <span>expensive</span>. Now I see why she was really <span>mad</span>.<br/>
🎧 Are you going to buy <span>it?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah. That's all the money I have <span>until</span> my next <span>paycheck.<br/>

🎧 Hey <span>Nancy</span>, why do you look so <span>worried?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span>, hi <span>Betty</span>. <span>Christine</span> and I had a big <span>argument</span> and she has <span>decided</span> to move out.<br/>
🎧 What did you <span>argue</span> <span>about?<br/></span> 
🎧 I told her that she needs to help <span>clean</span> up around the <span>apartment</span>.<br/>
🎧 What <span>happened</span> after you told her <span>that?<br/></span> 
🎧 She got <span>upset</span> and said she is <span>moving</span> out. But it's the <span>truth</span>. She never helps around house.<br/>
🎧 Yeah, that could be a <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 I had to say something since we're <span>roommates</span> and I'm <span>tired</span> of <span>cleaning</span> her <span>mess</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>totally</span> <span>understand</span>. I like things <span>neat</span> and <span>organized</span> too.<br/>
🎧 But the <span>bigger</span> <span>problem</span> is that she never <span>pays</span> her <span>rent</span> on time. She is <span>late</span> every <span>month</span>.<br/>
🎧 What are you going to <span>do?<br/></span> 
🎧 I need to find a <span>roommate</span> soon. I can't <span>afford</span> the <span>rent</span> by myself. Do you know <span>anyone</span> <span>looking</span> for a <span>roommate?<br/></span>

🎧 Hi <span>Carol</span>. You look <span>tired</span> today.<br/>
🎧 I am <span>tired</span>. I didn't get any <span>sleep</span> last <span>night</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Why?<br/></span> 
🎧 Our <span>neighbor's</span> dog would not <span>stop</span> <span>barking</span>. He <span>barked</span> all <span>night</span> long.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>awful</span>! Did you <span>complain</span> to your <span>neighbor?<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>knocked</span> on his <span>door</span>, but he didn't <span>answer</span>. I don't think he was home.<br/>

🎧 I couldn't <span>sleep</span>, so I <span>tried</span> to read a book. But the <span>dog's</span> <span>barking</span> <span>kept</span> <span>distracting</span> me. So, I just <span>watched</span> <span>TV</span>.<br/>

🎧 I didn't want to <span>bother</span> the <span>police</span> with a <span>barking</span> <span>dog</span>.<br/>
🎧 I would have <span>called</span> them. What if there was an <span>emergency</span> at your <span>neighbor's</span> house and the dog was trying to <span>alert</span> <span>someone</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>true</span>. I didn't think about that. But this dog usually <span>barks</span> because he's <span>bored</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>annoying</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know.<br/>
