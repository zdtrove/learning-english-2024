🎧 Hey <span>Joe</span>. Have you <span>seen</span> <span>Sandy?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>No</span>, <span>Bill</span>. <span>Why?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>We</span> had a <span>misunderstanding</span> and she <span>is</span> not <span>talking</span> to <span>me.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span>. <span>I'm</span> <span>sorry</span> to <span>hear</span> <span>that.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>. I <span>said</span> <span>something</span> <span>silly</span> and <span>hurt</span> her <span>feelings.<br/></span> 
🎧 What did you <span>say?<br/></span> 
🎧 It's not <span>important</span>. I don't <span>want</span> to <span>discuss</span> <span>it</span>. I <span>just</span> <span>want</span> to <span>apologize</span> to <span>her.<br/></span> 
🎧 She <span>always</span> <span>hangs</span> out <span>at</span> <span>Linda's</span> <span>house</span> <span>or</span> the <span>library.<br/></span> 
🎧 I've <span>already</span> <span>checked</span> <span>both</span> <span>places.<br/></span> 
🎧 How <span>about</span> her <span>house.<br/></span> 
🎧 Her <span>roommate</span> <span>said</span> she wasn't <span>home.<br/></span> 
🎧 Have you <span>called</span> her <span>cell</span> <span>phone.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>, <span>several</span> <span>times.<br/></span> 
🎧 She <span>must</span> <span>really</span> be mad <span>at</span> <span>you.<br/></span> 
🎧 She was! She <span>stormed</span> off and I didn't get to <span>explain</span> what I <span>meant.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>I'm</span> <span>really</span> <span>curious</span> now. What did you say to <span>her?<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>told</span> her to <span>exercise.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Well</span>, <span>that</span> <span>probably</span> wasn't a <span>smart</span> <span>thing</span> to say to a <span>woman.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>meant</span> <span>that</span> she <span>should</span> <span>exercise</span> to <span>stay</span> <span>healthy.<br/></span>

🎧 <span>Sally</span>, what's <span>wrong</span>? Why do you <span>look</span> so <span>sad?<br/></span> 
🎧 Mom, <span>Candace</span> <span>is</span> <span>moving</span> <span>away.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span>, <span>I'm</span> <span>sorry</span> to <span>hear</span> <span>that</span>. Why <span>is</span> she <span>moving?<br/></span> 
🎧 Her dad got a <span>job</span> <span>in</span> <span>another</span> <span>state.<br/></span> 
🎧 Where <span>is</span> she <span>moving?<br/></span> 
🎧 To <span>California</span>. That's <span>across</span> the <span>country.<br/></span> 
🎧 There are <span>many</span> <span>ways</span> you can <span>still</span> <span>keep</span> <span>in</span> <span>touch</span>. You can <span>e-mail</span>, <span>text</span>, and <span>call</span> <span>each</span> <span>other</span> <span>on</span> the <span>phone.<br/></span> 
🎧 But <span>it</span> won't be the <span>same</span> <span>as</span> <span>seeing</span> <span>each</span> <span>other</span> <span>every</span> day. She <span>is</span> my <span>best</span> <span>friend</span>. <span>I'm</span> <span>going</span> to <span>miss</span> <span>her.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>know</span> you <span>will</span>. When are <span>they</span> <span>moving?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>At</span> the end <span>of</span> <span>June</span> when the <span>school</span> <span>year</span> <span>ends</span>. <span>In</span> two <span>months.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Would</span> you <span>like</span> to <span>invite</span> her <span>over</span> <span>this</span> <span>weekend</span>? You can have a <span>sleepover.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yes</span>, <span>please</span>. <span>That</span> <span>would</span> be <span>great</span>. We're <span>going</span> to try to <span>hang</span> out <span>as</span> <span>much</span> <span>as</span> <span>possible</span> <span>before</span> she <span>moves.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>That</span> <span>sounds</span> <span>like</span> a <span>good</span> <span>plan.<br/></span> 
🎧 Can <span>we</span> <span>visit</span> her <span>in</span> <span>California?<br/></span> 
🎧 It's <span>pretty</span> far <span>from</span> <span>us</span>. <span>We</span> don't <span>know</span> <span>anyone</span> <span>there.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yes</span>, <span>we</span> do. <span>Candace</span> and her <span>family.<br/>

🎧 <span>Hi</span> <span>Carol</span>. You <span>look</span> <span>tired</span> <span>today.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>am</span> <span>tired</span>. I didn't get any <span>sleep</span> <span>last</span> <span>night.<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Why?<br/></span> 
🎧 Our <span>neighbor's</span> dog <span>would</span> not <span>stop</span> <span>barking</span>. <span>He</span> <span>barked</span> all <span>night</span> <span>long.<br/></span> 
🎧 That's <span>awful</span>! Did you <span>complain</span> to your <span>neighbor?<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>knocked</span> <span>on</span> his <span>door</span>, but <span>he</span> didn't <span>answer</span>. I don't <span>think</span> <span>he</span> was <span>home.<br/></span> 
🎧 What did you do all <span>night?<br/></span> 
🎧 I couldn't <span>sleep</span>, so I <span>tried</span> to <span>read</span> a <span>book</span>. But the <span>dog's</span> <span>barking</span> <span>kept</span> <span>distracting</span> me. So, I <span>just</span> <span>watched</span> <span>TV.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>would</span> be so <span>angry</span>. You should've <span>called</span> the <span>police.<br/></span> 
🎧 I didn't <span>want</span> to <span>bother</span> the <span>police</span> <span>with</span> a <span>barking</span> <span>dog.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>would</span> have <span>called</span> <span>them</span>. What <span>if</span> there was an <span>emergency</span> <span>at</span> your <span>neighbor's</span> <span>house</span> and the dog was <span>trying</span> to <span>alert</span> <span>someone.<br/></span> 
🎧 That's <span>true</span>. I didn't <span>think</span> <span>about</span> <span>that</span>. But <span>this</span> dog <span>usually</span> <span>barks</span> <span>because</span> he's <span>bored.<br/></span> 
🎧 That's <span>annoying.<br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>know.<br/></span> 
🎧 Hey <span>Carol</span>. <span>Is</span> <span>that</span> your <span>neighbor</span>? He's <span>walking</span> <span>towards</span> <span>us.<br/></span> 
🎧 What <span>is</span> <span>he</span> <span>holding?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>It</span> <span>looks</span> <span>like</span> a <span>plate</span> <span>of</span> <span>cookies.<br/></span>
