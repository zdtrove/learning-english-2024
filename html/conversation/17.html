🎧 <span>Hi</span> <span>Jane</span>. Where are you <span>going?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hi</span> <span>Sandra</span>. I'm <span>heading</span> to the <span>market</span>.<br/>
🎧 Which <span>one?<br/></span> 
🎧 The one <span>down</span> the <span>street</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Today</span> is a good day to go. There are a lot of <span>items</span> on <span>sale</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's great to know. I need to buy a lot of <span>stuff</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>market</span> is going out of <span>business?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Why?<br/></span> 
🎧 Not enough <span>customers</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's not good. I always go to that <span>market</span>.<br/>
🎧 Me too. But more people are going to the <span>bigger</span> <span>market</span> a few <span>blocks</span> away.<br/>
🎧 It's always so <span>crowded</span> there.<br/>
🎧 I know. But it has a <span>bigger</span> <span>selection</span> of things.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>, but I still like the <span>smaller</span> <span>store</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well, you better <span>leave</span> soon. There were a lot of people <span>today</span> <span>because</span> of the big <span>sale</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ok</span>. Thanks for <span>letting</span> me know. I'll see you <span>later.<br/>

🎧 <span>Hi</span> <span>Carol</span>. What are you <span>doing?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hi</span> <span>Jane</span>. I'm <span>making</span> a <span>shopping</span> <span>list</span> for the <span>supermarket</span>.<br/>

🎧 Let me <span>check</span> my <span>purse</span> and see if I have any <span>coupons</span> <span>too</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can get good <span>deals</span> on a lot of things if you have their <span>coupons</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know. I use their <span>coupons</span> all the time.<br/>
🎧 So, do you have <span>any?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>No</span>. I think I used them all. Where did you get your <span>coupons?<br/></span> 
🎧 They <span>came</span> in the <span>mail</span> <span>today</span>. Have you <span>looked</span> in your <span>mail</span> <span>box?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>No</span>, not yet. I'll go do that right now. What time are you <span>leaving?<br/></span> 
🎧 Don't <span>worry</span>. I can <span>wait</span> for you.<br/>
🎧 Thanks. I'll be right <span>back.<br/>

🎧 Hey <span>Ted</span>, why do you look so <span>nervous?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'm going to ask the <span>boss</span> for a <span>raise</span>.<br/>
🎧 You should. You <span>deserve</span> a <span>raise</span>. You work very <span>hard</span>.<br/>
🎧 I do work <span>hard</span>. I'm here <span>early</span> <span>every</span> day and I <span>leave</span> <span>late</span> <span>every</span> <span>night</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>, you do. You also help other people when they need help. You've <span>helped</span> me many <span>times</span>.<br/>
🎧 Also, I've been here for <span>10</span> years. My last <span>raise</span> was <span>three</span> years <span>ago</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Three</span> years? <span>Then</span> I think it's <span>definitely</span> time for a <span>raise</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you think she will say <span>yes?<br/></span> 
🎧 I think she will. She is nice. She <span>listens</span> well and she is also very <span>fair</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>wrote</span> a <span>short</span> <span>report</span> about why I <span>deserve</span> a <span>raise</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Only</span> you would do that. You are so <span>detail-oriented</span>.<br/>
🎧 I like to be <span>prepared</span> about <span>everything</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>another</span> <span>reason</span> why you should get a <span>raise</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ok</span>. I'm <span>ready</span> to talk to <span>her?<br/></span>

🎧 <span>Really</span>? You think <span>so?<br/></span> 
🎧 You have a lot of <span>experience</span> and you're very good with people. You should be a <span>manager</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's the <span>position</span> I was going to ask for, but I was <span>worried</span>.<br/>
🎧 What are you <span>worried</span> <span>about?<br/></span> 
🎧 I don't have a <span>college</span> <span>degree</span>. You have to have a <span>college</span> <span>degree</span> for that <span>position</span>.<br/>
🎧 But you have <span>lots</span> of <span>experience</span>. You have more <span>experience</span> than some of the <span>current</span> <span>managers</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know, but <span>degrees</span> are <span>important</span> <span>too</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know they are. Did you <span>ever</span> think about going back to school and <span>getting</span> your <span>degree?<br/></span> 
🎧 I have, but I am so <span>busy</span> these <span>days</span>. I don't have time to work and <span>study</span>.<br/>
