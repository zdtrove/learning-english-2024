🎧 Hey <span>Ted</span>, why do you <span>look</span> so <span>nervous?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>I'm</span> <span>going</span> to ask the <span>boss</span> for a <span>raise</span>.<br/>
🎧 You <span>should</span>. You <span>deserve</span> a <span>raise</span>. You <span>work</span> <span>very</span> <span>hard</span>.<br/>
🎧 I do <span>work</span> <span>hard</span>. <span>I'm</span> <span>here</span> <span>early</span> <span>every</span> day and I <span>leave</span> <span>late</span> <span>every</span> <span>night</span>.<br/>

🎧 I <span>wrote</span> a <span>short</span> <span>report</span> <span>about</span> why I <span>deserve</span> a <span>raise</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Only</span> you <span>would</span> do <span>that</span>. You are so <span>detail-oriented</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>like</span> to be <span>prepared</span> <span>about</span> <span>everything</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>another</span> <span>reason</span> why you <span>should</span> get a <span>raise</span>.<br/>

🎧 That's my <span>specialty</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let me <span>give</span> him a <span>call</span>. <span>Maybe</span> <span>he</span> can <span>help</span> you <span>find</span> a <span>job</span>.<br/>
