🎧 <span>Hi</span> <span>Jane</span>. Where are you <span>going?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Hi</span> <span>Sandra</span>. <span>I'm</span> <span>heading</span> to the <span>market</span>.<br/>
🎧 Which <span>one?<br/></span> 
🎧 The one <span>down</span> the <span>street</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Today</span> is a <span>good</span> day to go. There are a lot of <span>items</span> on <span>sale</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>great</span> to know. I need to buy a lot of <span>stuff</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>market</span> is <span>going</span> out of <span>business?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Why?<br/></span> 
🎧 Not <span>enough</span> <span>customers</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's not <span>good</span>. I always go to that <span>market</span>.<br/>
🎧 Me too. But more <span>people</span> are <span>going</span> to the <span>bigger</span> <span>market</span> a few <span>blocks</span> <span>away</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's always so <span>crowded</span> there.<br/>
🎧 I know. But it has a <span>bigger</span> <span>selection</span> of <span>things</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>, but I still like the <span>smaller</span> <span>store</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>I'm</span> <span>going</span> to ask the <span>boss</span> for a <span>raise</span>.<br/>
🎧 You should. You <span>deserve</span> a <span>raise</span>. You work very <span>hard</span>.<br/>
🎧 I do work <span>hard</span>. <span>I'm</span> here <span>early</span> <span>every</span> day and I <span>leave</span> <span>late</span> <span>every</span> <span>night</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>, you do. You <span>also</span> <span>help</span> other <span>people</span> when they need <span>help</span>. You've <span>helped</span> me many <span>times</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Also</span>, I've <span>been</span> here for <span>10</span> <span>years</span>. My <span>last</span> <span>raise</span> was <span>three</span> <span>years</span> <span>ago</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Three</span> <span>years</span>? <span>Then</span> I think it's <span>definitely</span> time for a <span>raise</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you think she will say <span>yes?<br/></span> 
🎧 I think she will. She is <span>nice</span>. She <span>listens</span> <span>well</span> and she is <span>also</span> very <span>fair</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>wrote</span> a <span>short</span> <span>report</span> about why I <span>deserve</span> a <span>raise</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Only</span> you would do that. You are so <span>detail-oriented</span>.<br/>
🎧 I like to be <span>prepared</span> about <span>everything</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>another</span> <span>reason</span> why you should get a <span>raise</span>.<br/>

🎧 Hey <span>Matt</span>, you're <span>home</span> <span>early</span> <span>today</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Oh</span>, <span>hi</span> <span>Bill</span>. I got <span>laid</span> off <span>today</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>I'm</span> <span>sorry</span> to <span>hear</span> that. <span>Why?<br/></span> 
🎧 The <span>company</span> is <span>downsizing</span> and they <span>eliminated</span> my <span>position</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>terrible</span>. How long did you work <span>there?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>15</span> <span>years</span>.<br/>
🎧 Wow! That's a long time.<br/>
🎧 I know. I <span>worked</span> very <span>hard</span>, but I <span>guess</span> it wasn't <span>enough</span>.<br/>
🎧 Don't say that. <span>Companies</span> usually <span>downsize</span> <span>because</span> they are <span>losing</span> <span>money</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know. I just don't know what to do now. I have a <span>family</span> to take <span>care</span> of.<br/>
🎧 <span>Does</span> your <span>wife</span> <span>know?<br/></span> 
🎧 Not <span>yet</span>. She's at work. I didn't <span>want</span> to give her bad <span>news</span> there.<br/>
🎧 I <span>understand</span>. What <span>kind</span> of work did you <span>do?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>I'm</span> a <span>graphic</span> <span>designer</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Really</span>? My son is a <span>website</span> <span>developer</span>. Do you know <span>anything</span> about web <span>design?<br/></span> 
🎧 That's my <span>specialty</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let me give him a <span>call</span>. <span>Maybe</span> he can <span>help</span> you find a job.<br/>
🎧 That would be <span>great</span>! I <span>really</span> <span>appreciate</span> <span>it.<br/></span>
