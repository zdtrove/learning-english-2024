🎧 <span>Guess</span> what! I just <span>found</span> out I <span>won</span> <span>tickets</span> to that <span>sold-out</span> <span>concert</span> <br/> 
🎧 Wow. You're so <span>lucky</span> <br/> 
🎧 I couldn't <span>believe</span> it when I got the <span>email</span>. It's like a <span>dream</span> come <span>true</span> <br/> 
🎧 That's <span>incredible</span>. Who are you taking with you? <br/> 
🎧 I'm thinking of taking my best friend. They're a <span>huge</span> fan of the <span>band</span> too, and I know they'll be over the <span>moon</span> <br/> 
🎧 That's a great <span>choice</span>. You're going to have an <span>unforgettable</span> time <br/> 
🎧 I feel <span>incredibly</span> <span>fortunate</span>. It's not every day you get the <span>chance</span> to see your <span>favorite</span> <span>band</span> live <br/> 
🎧 I can only <span>imagine</span> the <span>energy</span> at that <span>concert</span>. It's going to be <span>epic</span> <br/> 
🎧 I can't wait. It's going to be an <span>unforgettable</span> <span>night</span> <br/> 
🎧 Well, enjoy every <span>moment</span> of it. You <span>totally</span> <span>deserve</span> this <span>stroke</span> of <span>luck</span> <br/> 
🎧 Thanks, and I'll make sure to <span>savor</span> every <span>note</span> and <span>create</span> <span>memories</span> that will last a <span>lifetime</span> <br/> 
🎧 Have a <span>blast</span>. And I can't wait to hear all about it <span>afterward</span><br/><br/>

🎧 Hey, have you always been into <span>collecting</span> things? <br/> 
🎧 Yeah, I've been <span>collecting</span> <span>stamps</span> since I was a kid. It's a hobby I've <span>stuck</span> with <br/> 
🎧 That's <span>cool</span>. I've never really <span>collected</span> anything. What do you like most about <span>it</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Well, it's like a <span>treasure</span> <span>hunt</span>. You never know what you'll come across. <span>Plus</span>, it's a great way to learn about different <span>cultures</span> through their <span>postage</span> <br/> 
🎧 Sounds <span>fascinating</span>. Do you have a <span>favorite</span> <span>stamp</span> in your <span>collection</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Oh, I do. I have a <span>rare</span> one from the <span>early</span> <span>1900s</span> with a <span>misprint</span>. It's <span>worth</span> quite a bit <br/> 
🎧 Wow. That must be <span>valuable</span>. How do you find these <span>rare</span> <span>stamps</span>?<br/> 
🎧 <span>Mostly</span> through online <span>auctions</span> and <span>occasionally</span> at <span>antique</span> <span>shops</span>. It's all about <span>patience</span> and <span>luck</span> <br/> 
🎧 That's <span>impressive</span>. Maybe I'll start <span>collecting</span> something <span>someday</span> too<br/> 
🎧 You should. It's a <span>rewarding</span> hobby<br/><br/>

🎧 Great. I'll <span>bring</span> my <span>ball</span> and we can work on our <span>three-pointers</span> <br/> 
🎧 Sounds like a plan. Maybe we can also <span>practice</span> some <span>dribbling</span> and <span>passing</span> <span>drills</span> <br/>

🎧 You're on. And we can <span>invite</span> a few more friends to make it a <span>mini</span> <span>pickup</span> game <br/>

🎧 Hi. I <span>purchased</span> this <span>coffee</span> <span>maker</span> here <span>6</span> <span>months</span> ago and it <span>stopped</span> working. I think it's still under <span>warranty</span>. Can I get it <span>repaired</span> or <span>replaced</span>? <br/> 
🎧 I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have the <span>receipt</span> or <span>proof</span> of <span>purchase</span> with you? <br/> 
🎧 Yes, I have the <span>receipt</span> right here. It says there's a <span>one-year</span> <span>warranty</span> on the <span>product</span> <br/> 
🎧 Perfect. Let me take a look. Yes, it's still under <span>warranty</span>. We can definitely <span>process</span> a <span>repair</span> or <span>replacement</span> for you. Has it <span>suffered</span> any <span>physical</span> <span>damage</span>? <br/> 
🎧 No. It just <span>suddenly</span> <span>stopped</span> working one morning. It hasn't been <span>dropped</span> or anything <br/> 
🎧 Okay, in that case, we'll <span>send</span> it to our <span>service</span> <span>center</span> for a <span>checkup</span>. If it's a <span>manufacturing</span> <span>defect</span>, we'll either <span>repair</span> it or <span>provide</span> a <span>replacement</span>. How long will that take? <br/> 
🎧 It usually takes about <span>2</span> <span>weeks</span>. We'll <span>contact</span> you as soon as it's <span>ready</span><br/> 
🎧 Great. Thank you for your help <br/>

🎧 Great. Now I need to decide on a <span>handbag:</span> <span>clutch</span> or a small <span>shoulder</span> bag? <br/> 
🎧 A <span>clutch</span> could be more <span>elegant</span> for the <span>evening</span>. Do you have one that <span>matches</span>? <br/>

🎧 I've got a <span>quirky</span> idea for <span>practicing</span> English. What if we <span>described</span> our day as if we were <span>undercover</span> <span>spies</span>?<br/>
🎧 <span>Undercover</span> <span>spies</span>? That sounds <span>intriguing</span>. So <span>instead</span> of saying I went to the <span>store</span>, it would be more like I <span>ventured</span> into <span>enemy</span> <span>territory</span> to <span>acquire</span> <span>supplies</span> <br/> 
🎧 Exactly, and cooking dinner <span>becomes</span> <span>devising</span> a <span>potion</span> to <span>ensure</span> <span>survival</span>. It makes the <span>mundane</span> <span>exciting</span> and <span>enriches</span> <span>vocabulary</span> <br/> 
🎧 <span>Imagine</span> <span>reporting</span> a <span>mishap</span>. I was <span>intercepted</span> by the <span>feline</span> <span>agent</span> <span>causing</span> the <span>liquid</span> <span>asset</span> to <span>spill</span> over the <span>documents</span>. A simple case of the cat <span>knocking</span> over your water <br/> 
🎧 Let's take it <span>further</span>. <span>Meeting</span> a friend is now <span>rendezvousing</span> with an <span>ally</span> at the <span>predetermined</span> <span>coordinates</span>. <span>Adds</span> an <span>element</span> of <span>drama</span>, doesn't it? <br/> 
🎧 And to add a <span>twist</span> we could <span>swap</span> <span>stories</span> and <span>guess</span> the <span>real</span> <span>activities</span> behind the <span>descriptions</span>. It's a fun way to <span>test</span> our <span>understanding</span> and <span>creativity</span> <br/>
