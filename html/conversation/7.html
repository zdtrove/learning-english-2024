ðŸŽ§ Did you <span>hear</span> about the <span>meeting</span> <span>yesterday</span>? It got <span>pretty</span> <span>intense</span>. <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Yeah</span>, I <span>heard</span>. I <span>actually</span> <span>walked</span> out of it. I couldn't take the <span>arguing</span> <span>anymore</span>. <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Really</span>? What <span>happened</span>? <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, it <span>started</span> off as a <span>discussion</span>, but it <span>quickly</span> <span>turned</span> into a <span>heated</span> <span>argument</span>. <span>People</span> were <span>talking</span> over each other, and it was going <span>nowhere</span>. <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ That <span>sounds</span> <span>frustrating</span>. Why did you <span>decide</span> to <span>walk</span> out of the <span>meeting</span>? <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I <span>felt</span> like it wasn't <span>productive</span>, and no one was <span>listening</span>. I <span>decided</span> to <span>walk</span> out of the <span>room</span> to make a <span>point</span>. <span>Maybe</span> if people saw <span>others</span> <span>leaving</span>, they would <span>realize</span> how <span>unproductive</span> the <span>whole</span> <span>thing</span> was. <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Did it have any <span>impact</span>? <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Hard</span> to say. Some <span>others</span> <span>walked</span> out <span>after</span> me, but <span>I'm</span> not sure if it made a <span>difference</span>. It was just so <span>chaotic</span>. <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, at <span>least</span> you took a <span>stand</span>. <span>Sometimes</span> you have to <span>walk</span> out when <span>things</span> are just too <span>chaotic</span> to <span>handle</span>. <span><br/></span><br/>

ðŸŽ§ <span>Oh</span>, it's <span>quite</span> <span>sunny</span> <span>actually</span>. A nice <span>change</span> from the <span>rain</span> <span>we've</span> had this <span>week</span>. What about over there? <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Still</span> <span>cloudy</span> here, no sun yet. <span>Planning</span> on <span>heading</span> out? <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Yeah</span>, I <span>thought</span> I <span>might</span> take a <span>walk</span> <span>later</span>. The <span>fresh</span> air would do me good. How about you? <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>I'm</span> <span>thinking</span> about it. <span>If</span> it <span>clears</span> up, I <span>might</span> go for a jog. Need to <span>stretch</span> my <span>legs</span> <span>after</span> being <span>indoors</span> for so long. <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Sounds</span> like a good <span>plan</span>. Have you <span>heard</span> from the <span>office</span> about next <span>week</span>? <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Not yet, but <span>I'm</span> <span>hoping</span> we can <span>continue</span> <span>working</span> from home. It's been <span>quite</span> <span>productive</span> <span>actually</span>. <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Agreed</span>! I've <span>gotten</span> used to the <span>flexibility</span>. <span>Makes</span> you <span>wonder</span> why we <span>spent</span> so much time <span>commuting</span> <span>before</span> this. <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Exactly</span>! <span>More</span> time for <span>walks</span> and <span>jogs</span>, right? <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Right</span>! <span>Enjoy</span> your jog if you <span>manage</span> to get <span>out.<br/></span><br/>

ðŸŽ§ What's the <span>best</span> time to <span>visit</span> New <span>York</span>? <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ It <span>depends</span> on what you're <span>looking</span> for. <span>Each</span> <span>season</span> <span>offers</span> a <span>different</span> <span>experience</span>. <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I <span>heard</span> <span>summer</span> can get <span>pretty</span> hot and <span>crowded</span>. <span><br/></span>

ðŸŽ§ <span>Spring</span> <span>must</span> be nice with all the <span>flowers</span> <span>blooming</span>. <span><br/></span>

ðŸŽ§ <span>Pizza</span> for me, can't go <span>wrong</span> with a <span>classic</span> <span>pepperoni</span>. <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Sushi</span> and <span>pizza</span>, <span>quite</span> the <span>combo</span>. Do you have a <span>favorite</span> <span>place</span> to get your <span>pizza</span> from? <span><br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ There's this little <span>Italian</span> <span>place</span> <span>down</span> the <span>street</span> from my <span>apartment</span>. They make it in a <span>wood-fired</span> <span>oven</span>, it's the <span>best</span>. <span><br/></span>

ðŸŽ§ What's your <span>favorite</span> <span>type</span> of <span>dessert?<br/></span>

ðŸŽ§ <span>Absolutely</span>. I love how the <span>flavors</span> <span>melt</span> <span>together</span> in <span>tiramisu</span>, <span>especially</span> the <span>hint</span> of <span>coffee</span> and <span>cocoa</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ It's like a little <span>slice</span> of <span>heaven</span> in <span>every</span> <span>bite</span>. Have you <span>ever</span> <span>tried</span> <span>making</span> it at <span>home?<br/></span>

ðŸŽ§ <span>I'm</span> sure you'd do <span>great</span>. <span>Baking</span> can be a fun and <span>rewarding</span> <span>experience</span>.<br/>

ðŸŽ§ <span>Sure</span>, I was saying that <span>I'm</span> <span>thinking</span> about <span>redecorating</span> my <span>living</span> <span>room</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Ah</span>, got it. What kind of <span>changes</span> are you <span>considering?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>I'm</span> <span>thinking</span> of <span>adding</span> some new <span>furniture</span> and <span>updating</span> the <span>color</span> <span>scheme</span>, <span>maybe</span> some <span>brighter</span> <span>colors</span> to <span>liven</span> up the <span>space</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That <span>sounds</span> like a fun <span>project</span>. Have you <span>decided</span> on a <span>specific</span> <span>style</span> or <span>theme?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ Not yet, but <span>I'm</span> <span>leaning</span> <span>towards</span> a <span>modern</span> and <span>minimalist</span> look. <span>Clean</span> <span>lines</span> and <span>simple</span> <span>designs</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That <span>could</span> look <span>really</span> <span>sleek</span>. Have you <span>started</span> <span>shopping</span> for <span>furniture</span> and <span>decor?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Yeah</span>, I've been <span>browsing</span> <span>online</span> and <span>visiting</span> some <span>furniture</span> <span>stores</span> to get <span>inspiration</span>. I want to find <span>pieces</span> that are both <span>stylish</span> and <span>functional</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Smart</span> <span>approach</span>. It's <span>important</span> to <span>choose</span> <span>furniture</span> that <span>fits</span> your <span>lifestyle</span> and <span>needs</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Definitely</span>. I want the <span>living</span> <span>room</span> to feel <span>comfortable</span> and <span>inviting</span>, but also <span>stylish</span> and <span>organized</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Well, let me know if you need any <span>help</span> with your <span>redecorating</span> <span>project</span>. <span>I'd</span> be happy to <span>lend</span> a <span>hand</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Thanks</span>, I <span>appreciate</span> it. It'll be nice to have a <span>second</span> <span>opinion</span> when <span>making</span> <span>decisions.<br/>

ðŸŽ§ Can you <span>please</span> say that one more <span>time?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Sure</span>, I was <span>asking</span> if you're <span>available</span> to <span>meet</span> up this <span>weekend</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Ah</span>, got it. <span>Yeah</span>, I should be <span>free</span>. What did you have in <span>mind?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ I was <span>thinking</span> we <span>could</span> go for a <span>hike</span> in the <span>mountains</span>. The <span>weather's</span> <span>supposed</span> to be nice.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ That <span>sounds</span> like a <span>great</span> <span>idea</span>. It's been a <span>while</span> <span>since</span> I've been <span>hiking</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Yeah</span>, it'll be nice to get some <span>fresh</span> air and <span>exercise</span>. <span>Plus</span>, the <span>views</span> up there are always <span>amazing</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Definitely</span>. What time were you <span>thinking</span> of <span>starting</span> the <span>hike?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ How about around <span>9</span> <span>a.m.</span>? That way, we can <span>beat</span> the <span>crowds</span> and have the <span>trail</span> to <span>ourselves</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Sounds</span> <span>perfect</span>. <span>Should</span> I <span>bring</span> <span>anything</span>, like <span>snacks</span> or <span>water?<br/></span> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Yeah</span>, it's always a good <span>idea</span> to <span>pack</span> some <span>snacks</span> and <span>water</span> for the <span>hike</span>. I'll <span>bring</span> a <span>backpack</span> with some <span>essentials</span> <span>too</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Great</span>. I'll make sure to <span>wear</span> <span>comfortable</span> <span>shoes</span> and <span>dress</span> in <span>layers</span> in case it <span>gets</span> <span>chilly</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Sounds</span> like a <span>plan</span>. <span>I'm</span> <span>looking</span> <span>forward</span> to <span>it.<br/>
