ðŸŽ§ Did you hear about the <span>meeting</span> <span>yesterday</span>? It got <span>pretty</span> <span>intense</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Yeah, I <span>heard</span>. I <span>actually</span> <span>walked</span> out of it. I couldn't take the <span>arguing</span> <span>anymore</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Really</span>? What <span>happened</span>? <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, it <span>started</span> off as a <span>discussion</span>, but it quickly <span>turned</span> into a <span>heated</span> <span>argument</span>. <span>People</span> were talking over each other, and it was going <span>nowhere</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ That sounds <span>frustrating</span>. Why did you decide to <span>walk</span> out of the <span>meeting</span>? <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I <span>felt</span> like it wasn't <span>productive</span>, and no one was <span>listening</span>. I <span>decided</span> to <span>walk</span> out of the <span>room</span> to make a <span>point</span>. Maybe if people saw <span>others</span> <span>leaving</span>, they would <span>realize</span> how <span>unproductive</span> the <span>whole</span> thing was. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Did it have any <span>impact</span>? <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Hard</span> to say. Some <span>others</span> <span>walked</span> out after me, but I'm not sure if it made a <span>difference</span>. It was just so <span>chaotic</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Well, at <span>least</span> you took a <span>stand</span>. Sometimes you have to <span>walk</span> out when things are just too <span>chaotic</span> to <span>handle</span>. <br/><br/>

ðŸŽ§ How's the <span>weather</span> today? <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Oh, it's quite <span>sunny</span> <span>actually</span>. A nice change from the <span>rain</span> we've had this week. What about over there? <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Still</span> <span>cloudy</span> here, no sun yet. <span>Planning</span> on <span>heading</span> out? <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Yeah, I thought I might take a <span>walk</span> later. The <span>fresh</span> air would do me good. How about you? <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I'm thinking about it. If it <span>clears</span> up, I might go for a jog. Need to <span>stretch</span> my <span>legs</span> after being <span>indoors</span> for so long. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Sounds like a good plan. Have you <span>heard</span> from the <span>office</span> about next week? <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Not yet, but I'm <span>hoping</span> we can <span>continue</span> working from home. It's been quite <span>productive</span> <span>actually</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Agreed! I've <span>gotten</span> used to the <span>flexibility</span>. Makes you <span>wonder</span> why we <span>spent</span> so much time <span>commuting</span> before this. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Exactly! <span>More</span> time for <span>walks</span> and <span>jogs</span>, right? <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Right</span>! <span>Enjoy</span> your jog if you <span>manage</span> to get <span>out</span>.<br/><br/>

ðŸŽ§ That sounds great, feel free to <span>drop</span> by <span>anytime</span>. I'll be home all weekend. <br/>

ðŸŽ§ Yeah, we can <span>drop</span> by the new <span>cafÃ©</span> that <span>opened</span> <span>downtown</span>. They have great <span>coffee</span>, it'll be a nice way to catch up. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Sounds like a plan, I'll <span>drop</span> by around <span>2</span> pm on <span>Saturday</span> then. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Looking</span> forward to it. It's always nice when friends <span>drop</span> by <span>unexpectedly</span>. We can <span>chat</span>, have some <span>coffee</span>, and maybe even <span>drop</span> by the <span>park</span> if the <span>weather's</span> good. <br/>

ðŸŽ§ What's the best time to visit New <span>York</span>? <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ It <span>depends</span> on what you're <span>looking</span> for. <span>Each</span> <span>season</span> <span>offers</span> a different <span>experience</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I <span>heard</span> <span>summer</span> can get <span>pretty</span> hot and <span>crowded</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Yeah, <span>summers</span> can be <span>sweltering</span> and there are <span>lots</span> of <span>tourists</span>, but the <span>city</span> also comes <span>alive</span> with <span>outdoor</span> <span>events</span> and <span>festivals</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ What about <span>winter</span>? <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Winter</span> can be <span>cold</span>, <span>especially</span> in <span>January</span> and <span>February</span>, but it's also a <span>magical</span> time with <span>holiday</span> <span>decorations</span> and ice <span>skating</span> in <span>Central</span> <span>Park</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Spring</span> must be nice with all the <span>flowers</span> <span>blooming</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Absolutely, <span>spring</span> is <span>beautiful</span> and the <span>weather</span> <span>starts</span> to <span>warm</span> up. <span>Plus</span>, you can catch the <span>cherry</span> <span>blossoms</span> in <span>Central</span> <span>Park</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Sounds <span>lovely</span>, what about <span>fall</span>? <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Fall</span> is my <span>favorite</span> time to visit. The <span>weather</span> is <span>mild</span> and <span>Central</span> <span>Park</span> looks <span>stunning</span> with the <span>changing</span> leaves. <br/>

ðŸŽ§ It's <span>crucial</span> for the <span>meeting</span> <span>tomorrow</span>, so I need it as soon as <span>possible</span>. I <span>specifically</span> <span>asked</span> for it by <span>yesterday</span>. <br/>

ðŸŽ§ What's your <span>favorite</span> food? <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ That's a tough one, but I'd probably say <span>sushi</span>. I love the <span>variety</span>. How about you? <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Pizza</span> for me, can't go wrong with a <span>classic</span> <span>pepperoni</span>. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Sushi</span> and <span>pizza</span>, quite the <span>combo</span>. Do you have a <span>favorite</span> place to get your <span>pizza</span> from? <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ There's this little <span>Italian</span> place down the <span>street</span> from my <span>apartment</span>. They make it in a <span>wood-fired</span> <span>oven</span>, it's the best. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Sounds <span>delicious</span>, I've got a <span>favorite</span> <span>sushi</span> bar <span>downtown</span>. Ever been to <span>Maki</span> <span>Express</span>? <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I think I've <span>heard</span> of it, is it the one with the <span>conveyor</span> <span>belt</span>? <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Yeah, that's the one. <span>Fresh</span> <span>sushi</span> right off the <span>belt</span>. You should try it sometime. <br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Definitely</span> sounds <span>worth</span> a visit, maybe we could go together. <br/>

ðŸŽ§ What's your <span>favorite</span> <span>type</span> of <span>dessert</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ <span>Tough</span> <span>question</span>! I have a <span>sweet</span> <span>tooth</span>, so it's <span>hard</span> to <span>pick</span> just one. But if I had to choose, I'd say <span>cheesecake</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Cheesecake</span>? <span>Nice</span> <span>choice</span>. Any <span>particular</span> <span>flavor</span> you <span>prefer</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I'm a <span>sucker</span> for <span>classic</span> New <span>York-style</span> <span>cheesecake</span> with a simple <span>graham</span> <span>cracker</span> <span>crust</span>. How about you?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I'm <span>torn</span> between <span>chocolate</span> <span>lava</span> <span>cake</span> and <span>tiramisu</span>. Both are just so <span>decadent</span> and <span>delicious</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Oh, those are both <span>excellent</span> <span>choices</span>! <span>Chocolate</span> <span>lava</span> <span>cake</span> is <span>irresistible</span> with that <span>gooey</span> <span>center</span>, and <span>tiramisu</span> has that <span>perfect</span> <span>balance</span> of <span>flavors</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Absolutely. I love how the <span>flavors</span> <span>melt</span> together in <span>tiramisu</span>, <span>especially</span> the <span>hint</span> of <span>coffee</span> and <span>cocoa</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ It's like a little <span>slice</span> of <span>heaven</span> in every <span>bite</span>. Have you ever <span>tried</span> <span>making</span> it at <span>home</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ I've thought about it, but it <span>seems</span> a bit <span>intimidating</span>. Maybe one day I'll <span>muster</span> up the <span>courage</span> to give it a <span>shot</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ I'm sure you'd do great. <span>Baking</span> can be a fun and <span>rewarding</span> <span>experience</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Thanks. Maybe I'll give it a try sometime soon. And hey, if I <span>succeed</span>, I'll <span>save</span> you a <span>slice</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Sounds like a plan. I'll <span>hold</span> you to <span>that

ðŸŽ§ Yeah, it'll be nice to get some <span>fresh</span> air and <span>exercise</span>. <span>Plus</span>, the <span>views</span> up there are always <span>amazing</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ <span>Definitely</span>. What time were you thinking of <span>starting</span> the <span>hike</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ How about around <span>9</span> <span>a.m</span>.? That way, we can <span>beat</span> the <span>crowds</span> and have the <span>trail</span> to <span>ourselves</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Sounds <span>perfect</span>. Should I <span>bring</span> anything, like <span>snacks</span> or <span>water</span>?<br/> 
ðŸŽ§ Yeah, it's always a good idea to <span>pack</span> some <span>snacks</span> and water for the <span>hike</span>. I'll <span>bring</span> a <span>backpack</span> with some <span>essentials</span> too.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Great. I'll make sure to <span>wear</span> <span>comfortable</span> <span>shoes</span> and <span>dress</span> in <span>layers</span> in case it <span>gets</span> <span>chilly</span>.<br/>
ðŸŽ§ Sounds like a plan. I'm <span>looking</span> forward to <span>it
</span>.<br/><br/><br/>
