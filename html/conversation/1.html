🎧 <span>Guess</span> what. I just got a job <span>offer</span> from my <span>dream</span> company<br/> 
🎧 Are you serious?<br/> 
🎧 Yes I am they called me this morning and made the <span>offer</span>. I can't <span>believe</span> <span>it</span><br/> 
🎧 That's <span>incredible</span> <span>news</span>. I know how much you've wanted to work there<br/>

🎧 Sure. I can help with that. How quickly does it need to <span>arrive</span>?<br/>

🎧 It really is. And it would be great to have you there. But whatever you decide, I'll <span>support</span> it <br/> 
🎧 Thanks for being so <span>understanding</span>. I'll get back to you soon with my <span>decision</span><br/><br/> -->

1. Morning
<br />
1.1. Do you usually do the same things in the mornings?
<br />
As I'm a creature of habit, I would say yes. I always get up at 6:00 am, have 
noodles and tea for breakfast, brush my teeth, then brush up (quickly study) 
on what we learned the day before in class to make sure I'm well-prepared. 
After all of this, I start heading to class at 8:30am. However, on weekends, I 
tend to hit the snooze button and end up sleeping till 9:00am then start my day.
<br />
1.2. Do you think breakfast is important?
<br />
Absolutely. Many experts state that it is the most important meal of the day. I 
believe it gives me the fuel I need to tackle my day (to strongly take on the 
day). Moreover, I think it's critical to have a balanced breakfast to make sure I 
get all the proper nutrients. I cannot imagine starting my day on an empty 
stomach!
<br />
1.3. Did you do the same morning routines in your early ages?
<br />
Yes, pretty much! As I've always been a scholarly person, I've always had the 
motivation to get myself up earlier than expected to have a balanced breakfast 
and prepare myself for the day ahead of me. However, I used to have more of 
a sweet tooth (a person who lives sweets) as a child, so I used to munch on 
(eat) some sweet bread instead of noodles.
<br />
1.4. Do you want to change your daily routines in the future?
<br />
I think it's inevitable since I'll soon be joining the workforce! I want to keep my 
organized, prepared habits, but I hope to sleep in a bit more in the future. I 
would like to at least sleep 30 minutes to an hour later, and not have to spend 
as much time preparing for my day. Furthermore, I hope to have my own car 
instead of taking a Grab every morning.

<hr />

2. Study time
<br />
2.1. What can you do to improve your learning efficiency?
<br />
Hmm, I would say that meditation and physical exercise can certainly be of help. 
I believe that meditation can help you to become more aware of yourself and 
find your center of concentration. Furthermore, exercise releases tension and 
brings you back to focus. When I feel overwhelmed with my studies, I often take 
a break to go work out at the gym then afterwards feel more productive.
<br />
2.2. Do you prefer to study in the morning or in the evening?
<br />
Definitely the evening. When I have an exam the next morning, I feel that the 
information stays with me much more clearly when I cram (study at the last 
minute) the evening before. When I try to study in the morning, I often feel 
rushed or cannot stay focused, as I know all my daily tasks are awaiting me.
<br />
2.3. What time do you like to study?
<br />
Around dinnertime after I've finished all my tasks for the day; I feel most at ease 
at this time. When I study right before bed, I tend to even dream of that 
information, helping me to remember clearly for that exam.
<br />
2.4. Why do people find it difficult to focus on studying?
<br />
Well, for one, studying isn't something enjoyable for many people, so it's hard 
to concentrate on something you dislike. Moreover, it's difficult with all of the 
distractions of today- such as texting, instagram, facebook, etc. Lastly, some 
people become preoccupied with other tasks they need to do, such as cleaning 
or cooking.
<br />
2.5. Do you like to study alone or with your friends?
<br />
Both can be nice. But, I tend to be more efficient when I study alone. Sometimes 
when I study with friends, we get off topic and don't get much done. However, 
it is effective to quiz each other. So all in all, there are benefits to both.

<hr />

3. Plants
<br />
3.1. Do you like plants?
<br />
Frankly speaking, I'm quite drawn by plants and vegetation in general. I often 
find myself wandering about in the parks gazing aimlessly at the flowerbeds and 
enjoy the aroma that some beautiful flowers give off.
<br />
3.2. Do you think plants can be a good gift?
<br />
Definitely, plants usually feature in many occasions from casual birthdays to 
more formal dinners. It's common to bring a bunch of newly picked flowers or a 
bouquet of flowers to the host family.

3.3. Can you grow plants? Do you know anything about growing a plant?
<br />
I don't have a knack for gardening, so it's quite over my head when it comes to 
growing certain types of plants. My mother often takes care of this instead.
<br />
3.4. Do you keep plants at home?
<br />
Yes, I do. I mean I keep lily in my bedroom and I also plant some vegetables 
like cucumber, onions and tomatoes in the balcony. Now you can see 
everything covered in green.
