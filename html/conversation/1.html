🎧 <span>Actually</span>, <span>yes</span>. one <span>blogger</span> <span>does</span> <span>weekly</span> <span>challenges</span> <span>like</span> <span>ordering</span> <span>food</span> <span>using</span> <span>only</span> <span>movie</span> <span>quotes</span>. And there's <span>this</span> <span>channel</span> where the <span>host</span> <span>explores</span> <span>idioms</span> <span>through</span> <span>hilarious</span> <span>skits</span> <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>That</span> <span>sounds</span> <span>like</span> a <span>blast</span>. <span>Imagine</span> <span>walking</span> <span>into</span> a <span>coffee</span> <span>shop</span> and <span>saying</span> to <span>brew</span> <span>or</span> not to <span>brew</span>. <span>That</span> <span>is</span> the <span>question<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Exactly</span>, and <span>last</span> <span>week</span> I <span>learned</span> <span>business</span> <span>English</span> by <span>negotiating</span> a <span>peace</span> <span>treat</span> <span>between</span> <span>aliens</span> and <span>humans</span> all <span>through</span> <span>role</span> <span>play</span> <span>videos</span> <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Aliens</span>, <span>huh</span>? Did the <span>aliens</span> <span>agree</span> to the <span>terms</span>, <span>or</span> did <span>they</span> <span>find</span> our <span>business</span> <span>lingo</span> too <span>perplexing?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>We</span> <span>reached</span> an <span>agreement</span> <span>thanks</span> to my <span>newfound</span> <span>persuasive</span> <span>English</span> <span>skills</span>. <span>Next</span> <span>up</span> <span>I'm</span> <span>diving</span> <span>into</span> <span>poetry</span> <span>slams</span>. They're <span>teaching</span> <span>rhythmic</span> <span>patterns</span> and <span>intonation</span> <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Poetry</span> <span>Slams</span> <span>with</span> <span>English</span> <span>Learners</span>? That's <span>innovative</span>. <span>I'm</span> <span>in</span>. Let's <span>rhyme</span> our way to <span>fluency</span><br/><br/>

🎧 Hey, I was <span>wondering</span> <span>if</span> you'd <span>like</span> to <span>join</span> me for a <span>weekend</span> <span>camping</span> <span>trip</span> <span>in</span> the <span>mountains</span> <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>That</span> <span>sounds</span> <span>interesting</span>, but <span>I'll</span> <span>think</span> <span>about</span> <span>it</span> <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Come</span> <span>on</span>, it'll be so <span>much</span> fun. We'll be <span>surrounded</span> by <span>Nature</span>, have <span>campfires</span> and <span>stargaze</span> <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>It</span> <span>does</span> <span>sound</span> <span>tempting</span>, but I have a lot <span>on</span> my <span>plate</span> <span>right</span> now and <span>I'm</span> not <span>sure</span> <span>if</span> I can <span>come</span> <span>in<br/></span> 
🎧 I get <span>it</span>. <span>Life</span> can get <span>busy</span>. <span>Take</span> your <span>time</span> to <span>think</span> <span>it</span> <span>over</span>. The <span>trip</span> <span>is</span> <span>still</span> a few <span>weeks</span> <span>away</span> <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Thanks</span> for <span>understanding</span> <span>I'll</span> let you <span>know</span> <span>as</span> <span>soon</span> <span>as</span> I <span>make</span> a <span>decision</span> <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>No</span> <span>pressure</span> <span>at</span> all. I <span>know</span> <span>these</span> <span>things</span> can be <span>spontaneous</span>. <span>Just</span> <span>know</span> <span>that</span> you're <span>always</span> <span>welcome</span> <span>if</span> you <span>decide</span> to <span>join</span> <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>appreciate</span> <span>that</span>. <span>I'll</span> <span>definitely</span> <span>give</span> <span>it</span> <span>some</span> <span>thought</span>. <span>It</span> <span>sounds</span> <span>like</span> a <span>fantastic</span> <span>opportunity</span> <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>It</span> <span>really</span> <span>is</span>. And <span>it</span> <span>would</span> be <span>great</span> to have you there. But <span>whatever</span> you <span>decide</span>, <span>I'll</span> <span>support</span> <span>it</span> <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Thanks</span> for <span>being</span> so <span>understanding</span>. <span>I'll</span> get <span>back</span> to you <span>soon</span> <span>with</span> my <span>decision</span><br/><br/>
