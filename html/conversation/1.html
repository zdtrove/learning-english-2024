🎧 It <span>does</span> <span>sound</span> <span>tempting</span>, but I have a lot on my <span>plate</span> <span>right</span> now and <span>I'm</span> not sure if I can <span>come</span> <span>in<br/></span> 
🎧 I get it. <span>Life</span> can get <span>busy</span>. <span>Take</span> your time to think it over. The <span>trip</span> is still a few <span>weeks</span> <span>away</span> <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Thanks</span> for <span>understanding</span> <span>I'll</span> let you know as <span>soon</span> as I make a <span>decision</span> <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>No</span> <span>pressure</span> at all. I know <span>these</span> <span>things</span> can be <span>spontaneous</span>. <span>Just</span> know that you're always <span>welcome</span> if you <span>decide</span> to <span>join</span> <span><br/></span> 
🎧 I <span>appreciate</span> that. <span>I'll</span> <span>definitely</span> give it some <span>thought</span>. It <span>sounds</span> like a <span>fantastic</span> <span>opportunity</span> <span><br/></span> 
🎧 It <span>really</span> is. And it would be <span>great</span> to have you there. But <span>whatever</span> you <span>decide</span>, <span>I'll</span> <span>support</span> it <span><br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Thanks</span> for being so <span>understanding</span>. <span>I'll</span> get back to you <span>soon</span> with my <span>decision</span><br/><br/>
