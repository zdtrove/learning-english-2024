1. Morning <br />

1.1. Do you usually do the same things in the mornings? <br />

As I'm a creature of habit, I would say yes. I always get up at 6:00 am, have 
noodles and tea for breakfast, brush my teeth, then brush up (quickly study) 
on what we learned the day before in class to make sure I'm well-prepared. 
After all of this, I start heading to class at 8:30am. However, on weekends, I 
tend to hit the snooze button and end up sleeping till 9:00am then start my day.<br />

1.2. Do you think breakfast is important?<br />

Absolutely. Many experts state that it is the most important meal of the day. I 
believe it gives me the fuel I need to tackle my day (to strongly take on the 
day). Moreover, I think it's critical to have a balanced breakfast to make sure I 
get all the proper nutrients. I cannot imagine starting my day on an empty 
stomach!<br />

1.3. Did you do the same morning routines in your early ages?<br />

Yes, pretty much! As I've always been a scholarly person, I've always had the 
motivation to get myself up earlier than expected to have a balanced breakfast 
and prepare myself for the day ahead of me. However, I used to have more of 
a sweet tooth (a person who lives sweets) as a child, so I used to munch on 
(eat) some sweet bread instead of noodles.<br />

1.4. Do you want to change your daily routines in the future?<br />

I think it's inevitable since I'll soon be joining the workforce! I want to keep my 
organized, prepared habits, but I hope to sleep in a bit more in the future. I 
would like to at least sleep 30 minutes to an hour later, and not have to spend 
as much time preparing for my day. Furthermore, I hope to have my own car 
instead of taking a Grab every morning.<br />

2. Study time<br />

2.1. What can you do to improve your learning efficiency?<br />

Hmm, I would say that meditation and physical exercise can certainly be of help. 
I believe that meditation can help you to become more aware of yourself and 
find your center of concentration. Furthermore, exercise releases tension and 
brings you back to focus. When I feel overwhelmed with my studies, I often take 
a break to go work out at the gym then afterwards feel more productive.<br />

2.2. Do you prefer to study in the morning or in the evening?<br />

Definitely the evening. When I have an exam the next morning, I feel that the 
information stays with me much more clearly when I cram (study at the last 
minute) the evening before. When I try to study in the morning, I often feel 
rushed or cannot stay focused, as I know all my daily tasks are awaiting me.<br />

2.3. What time do you like to study?<br />

Around dinnertime after I've finished all my tasks for the day; I feel most at ease 
at this time. When I study right before bed, I tend to even dream of that 
information, helping me to remember clearly for that exam.<br />

2.4. Why do people find it difficult to focus on studying?<br />

Well, for one, studying isn't something enjoyable for many people, so it's hard 
to concentrate on something you dislike. Moreover, it's difficult with all of the 
distractions of today- such as texting, instagram, facebook, etc. Lastly, some 
people become preoccupied with other tasks they need to do, such as cleaning 
or cooking.<br />

2.5. Do you like to study alone or with your friends?<br />

Both can be nice. But, I tend to be more efficient when I study alone. Sometimes 
when I study with friends, we get off topic and don't get much done. However, 
it is effective to quiz each other. So all in all, there are benefits to both.

3. Plants<br />

3.1. Do you like plants?<br />

Frankly speaking, I'm quite drawn by plants and vegetation in general. I often 
find myself wandering about in the parks gazing aimlessly at the flowerbeds and 
enjoy the aroma that some beautiful flowers give off.<br />

3.2. Do you think plants can be a good gift?<br />

Definitely, plants usually feature in many occasions from casual birthdays to 
more formal dinners. It's common to bring a bunch of newly picked flowers or a 
bouquet of flowers to the host family.<br />

3.3. Can you grow plants? Do you know anything about growing a plant?<br />

I don't have a knack for gardening, so it's quite over my head when it comes to 
growing certain types of plants. My mother often takes care of this instead.<br />

3.4. Do you keep plants at home?<br />

Yes, I do. I mean I keep lily in my bedroom and I also plant some vegetables 
like cucumber, onions and tomatoes in the balcony. Now you can see 
everything covered in green.
