🎧 <span>Hello</span> I need to <span>send</span> this <span>package</span> to New <span>York</span>. Can you tell me the best way to <span>ship</span> <span>it?<br/></span> 
🎧 Sure. I can help with that. How quickly does it need to <span>arrive?<br/></span> 
🎧 It's not <span>super</span> <span>urgent</span>. <span>Within</span> a week would be <span>fine<br/></span> 
🎧 In that case our <span>standard</span> <span>shipping</span> would be the most <span>cost</span> <span>effective</span> <span>option</span>. It usually takes <span>3</span> to <span>5</span> <span>business</span> <span>days<br/></span> 
🎧 Sounds good. How much will it <span>cost?<br/></span> 
🎧 It <span>depends</span> on the <span>weight</span> and size of the <span>package</span>. Let's <span>weight</span> it. It comes to <span>$15</span>. <span>Would</span> you like to add <span>tracking</span> or <span>insurance</span> to your <span>package?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yes please add <span>tracking<br/></span> 
🎧 That will be an <span>additional</span> <span>$2.50</span>. Your <span>total</span> is <span>$17.50</span>. How would you like to <span>pay?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll pay with my <span>credit</span> <span>card<br/></span> 
🎧 All right. I'll get this <span>process</span> for you. Please <span>swipe</span> your <span>card</span> <span>here<br/></span>

🎧 I've been thinking of <span>starting</span> a new <span>diet</span>, maybe something <span>plant-based</span>. Have you ever <span>tried</span> anything like <span>that?<br/></span> 
🎧 Yeah I <span>actually</span> went <span>vegan</span> for a few <span>months</span> last year, it was an <span>interesting</span> <span>experience</span>. Why the <span>sudden</span> <span>interest?<br/></span>

🎧 That sounds <span>doable</span>, I'm a bit <span>worried</span> about <span>missing</span> <span>certain</span> <span>foods</span> <span>though<br/></span> 
🎧 It's <span>normal</span> to have <span>those</span> <span>concerns</span>. Maybe try <span>finding</span> <span>plant-based</span> <span>alternatives</span> for your <span>favorite</span> <span>dishes</span>, there are so many <span>options</span> out there <span>now<br/></span> 
🎧 Good <span>idea</span>, do you have any <span>recipe</span> <span>recommendations</span> or <span>tips<br/></span> 
🎧 Sure I can <span>send</span> you some. Also <span>meal</span> planning helps a lot, <span>keeps</span> you on <span>track</span> and <span>makes</span> <span>grocery</span> <span>shopping</span> <span>easier<br/></span>

🎧 I <span>found</span> a <span>gold</span> <span>mine</span> for <span>learning</span> <span>English</span>. I'm <span>following</span> these <span>blogs</span> and <span>YouTube</span> <span>channels</span> <span>dedicated</span> to <span>language</span> <span>learning</span>. It's not the <span>usual</span> <span>drill and kill</span> <span>grammar</span> <span>stuff</span> <br/> 
🎧 <span>Oh</span>, do they <span>teach</span> you how to <span>order</span> <span>coffee</span> in <span>Shakespearean</span> <span>English</span> or <span>what?<br/></span>

🎧 That sounds like a <span>blast</span>. <span>Imagine</span> <span>walking</span> into a <span>coffee</span> <span>shop</span> and saying to <span>brew</span> or not to <span>brew</span>. That is the <span>question<br/></span>
