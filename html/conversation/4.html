🎧 Have you <span>decided</span> what you're <span>getting?<br/></span> 
🎧 I think so. I'm <span>leaning</span> <span>towards</span> the <span>steak</span>. How about <span>you?<br/></span> 
🎧 I can't decide between the <span>chicken</span> <span>Alfredo</span> or the <span>shrimp</span> <span>scampi</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why don't you get the <span>shrimp</span> <span>scampi</span>? You've been <span>craving</span> <span>seafood</span> <span>lately</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good <span>point</span>. <span>Shrimp</span> <span>scampi</span> it is. Are we doing <span>appetizers?<br/></span> 
🎧 How about the <span>bruschetta</span>? It's <span>light</span> and sounds <span>delicious</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sounds</span> good to me. <span>Oh</span>, and we should try the house <span>salad</span> <span>too</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Agreed</span>. Let's do that. What are you <span>drinking?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll <span>stick</span> with water. Maybe a <span>glass</span> of <span>wine</span> with the <span>meal</span>. <span>You?<br/></span> 
🎧 I'll go with an <span>iced</span> tea. I'm driving, so no <span>wine</span> for me.<br/>
🎧 All right. I think we're <span>ready</span> to <span>order</span>. This looks like a great <span>meal</span>.<br/>
