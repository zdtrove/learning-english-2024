🎧 Have you <span>decided</span> what you're <span>getting</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I think so. I'm <span>leaning</span> <span>towards</span> the <span>steak</span>. How about you?<br/> 
🎧 I can't decide between the <span>chicken</span> <span>Alfredo</span> or the <span>shrimp</span> <span>scampi</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why don't you get the <span>shrimp</span> <span>scampi</span>? You've been <span>craving</span> <span>seafood</span> <span>lately</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good <span>point</span>. <span>Shrimp</span> <span>scampi</span> it is. Are we doing <span>appetizers</span>?<br/> 
🎧 How about the <span>bruschetta</span>? It's <span>light</span> and sounds <span>delicious</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sounds good to me. Oh, and we should try the house <span>salad</span> too.<br/>
🎧 Agreed. Let's do that. What are you <span>drinking</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I'll <span>stick</span> with water. Maybe a <span>glass</span> of <span>wine</span> with the <span>meal</span>. You?<br/> 
🎧 I'll go with an <span>iced</span> tea. I'm driving, so no <span>wine</span> for me.<br/>
🎧 All right. I think we're ready to <span>order</span>. This looks like a great <span>meal</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Definitely</span>! I'm already <span>hungry</span> just thinking about <span>it</span>.<br/><br/>

🎧 I <span>wonder</span> when they'll <span>finally</span> let us know.<br/>

🎧 That sounds like fun. Are a lot of people from work <span>going</span>?<br/> 
🎧 Yeah, quite a few. It's been a while since we all got together like this.<br/>
🎧 I bet it'll be a good <span>break</span> from the <span>usual</span>. What are you thinking of <span>wearing</span>?<br/> 
🎧 I'm not sure yet, maybe something <span>casual</span> but nice. It's not <span>super</span> <span>formal</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sounds like a good <span>choice</span>. Are you taking anything with you, like a <span>gift</span> or <span>something</span>?<br/>

🎧 That's <span>thoughtful</span>, she'll <span>appreciate</span> that.<br/>
