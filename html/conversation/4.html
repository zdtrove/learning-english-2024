🎧 Have you <span>decided</span> what you're <span>getting?<br/></span>

🎧 Why don't you get the <span>shrimp</span> <span>scampi</span>? You've <span>been</span> <span>craving</span> <span>seafood</span> <span>lately</span>.<br/>

🎧 <span>Sounds</span> good to me. <span>Oh</span>, and we should try the <span>house</span> <span>salad</span> <span>too</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Agreed</span>. Let's do that. What are you <span>drinking?<br/></span>

🎧 All right. I think we're <span>ready</span> to <span>order</span>. This looks like a <span>great</span> <span>meal</span>.<br/>
