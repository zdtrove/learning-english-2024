🎧 What's <span>going</span> <span>on</span>, <span>guys</span>? I can <span>hear</span> you <span>arguing</span> <span>from</span> the <span>other</span> <span>room</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>nothing</span>, Mom. <span>Just</span> a <span>stupid</span> <span>argument</span> <span>with</span> my <span>sister</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>He</span> <span>started</span> <span>it</span>! <span>He</span> <span>took</span> my <span>phone</span> <span>without</span> <span>asking</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hold</span> <span>on</span>, let's <span>take</span> a <span>deep</span> <span>breath</span> and <span>talk</span> <span>this</span> out <span>calmly</span>. Son, did you <span>take</span> your <span>sister's</span> <span>phone</span> <span>without</span> <span>permission?<br/></span> 
🎧 <span>Yeah</span>, but I <span>just</span> <span>wanted</span> to use <span>it</span> for a <span>minute</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Taking</span> <span>something</span> <span>without</span> <span>asking</span> <span>is</span> not <span>okay</span>, son. You <span>need</span> to <span>respect</span> your <span>sister's</span> <span>belongings</span>.<br/>
🎧 And <span>he</span> <span>never</span> <span>gives</span> <span>it</span> <span>back</span> when I <span>ask!<br/></span> 
🎧 All <span>right</span>, let's <span>find</span> a <span>solution</span> <span>here</span>. Son, you <span>need</span> to ask <span>before</span> <span>borrowing</span> <span>anything</span> <span>from</span> your <span>sister</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Okay</span>, <span>I'm</span> <span>sorry</span>. <span>I'll</span> <span>remember</span> <span>next</span> <span>time</span>.<br/>
🎧 And <span>daughter</span>, try to <span>communicate</span> <span>calmly</span> when you <span>want</span> <span>something</span> <span>back</span>. <span>Yelling</span> won't <span>solve</span> <span>anything</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Okay</span>, <span>I'll</span> <span>try</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Remember</span>, you two are <span>siblings</span> and you <span>need</span> to <span>treat</span> <span>each</span> <span>other</span> <span>with</span> <span>respect</span> and <span>kindness.<br/></span><br/>
