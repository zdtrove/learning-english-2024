<h2 id="es-1-37">Arriving in New York</h2>

🎧 My name is <span>Adam</span> and I am from <span>Spain</span>.<br/>
🎧 I came to New <span>York</span> to learn English.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>excited</span> but also <span>nervous</span>.<br/>
🎧 I had never been to New <span>York</span> before.<br/>
🎧 When I <span>arrived</span> at the <span>airport</span>, I <span>felt</span> a mix of <span>emotions</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>city</span> was big and <span>noisy</span>.<br/>
🎧 I took a <span>taxi</span> to my new <span>apartment</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>buildings</span> were <span>tall</span>, and there were many people <span>everywhere</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I got to my <span>apartment</span>, I <span>met</span> my <span>roommate</span>.<br/>
🎧 Her name is <span>Anna</span>, and she is from <span>Brazil</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna</span> is also <span>learning</span> English.<br/>
🎧 We quickly <span>became</span> friends.<br/>
🎧 We both <span>felt</span> happy to have <span>someone</span> to talk to in our new <span>city</span>.<br/>
🎧 The next day, I went to my <span>language</span> school.<br/>
🎧 It was my first day of class.<br/>
🎧 The school was not <span>far</span> from my <span>apartment</span>, so I <span>walked</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>streets</span> were <span>busy</span>, and I saw many <span>interesting</span> things.<br/>
🎧 There were <span>street</span> <span>vendors</span> <span>selling</span> food, people <span>rushing</span> to work, and <span>tourists</span> taking <span>pictures</span>.<br/>
🎧 At the school, I <span>met</span> my <span>teacher</span>, Ms. <span>Parker</span>.<br/>
🎧 She was very nice and <span>welcomed</span> us <span>warmly</span>.<br/>
🎧 There were students from different <span>countries</span> in my class.<br/>
🎧 I <span>met</span> <span>Hiroshi</span> from <span>Japan</span>, <span>Maria</span> from <span>Mexico</span>, and <span>Ahmed</span> from <span>Egypt</span>.<br/>
🎧 We all wanted to learn English.<br/>
🎧 Ms. <span>Parker</span> <span>started</span> the class by <span>introducing</span> <span>herself</span>, then she <span>asked</span> each of us to <span>introduce</span> <span>ourselves</span>.<br/>
🎧 When it was my <span>turn</span>, I <span>felt</span> a little shy, but I took a <span>deep</span> <span>breath</span> and said, Hello, my name is <span>Maria</span>.<br/>
🎧 I am from <span>Spain</span>.<br/>
🎧 I am here to learn English.<br/>
🎧 Everyone <span>smiled</span>, and Ms. <span>Parker</span> said, <span>Welcome</span>, <span>Maria</span>.<br/>
🎧 We are happy to have you here.<br/>
🎧 After <span>introductions</span>, Ms. <span>Parker</span> <span>talked</span> about the course.<br/>
🎧 She said we would learn English by <span>using</span> it every day.<br/>
🎧 We would speak, listen, read, and <span>write</span> in English.<br/>
🎧 She told us that practice is very important.<br/>
🎧 Do not <span>worry</span> about <span>making</span> <span>mistakes</span>, she said.<br/>
🎧 <span>Making</span> <span>mistakes</span> is <span>part</span> of <span>learning</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>afternoon</span>, we <span>practiced</span> <span>speaking</span> in <span>pairs</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>paired</span> with <span>Hiroshi</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>talked</span> about our <span>countries</span> and why we came to New <span>York</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Hiroshi</span> told me he likes <span>anime</span> and <span>wants</span> to work in <span>animation</span>.<br/>
🎧 I told him I like <span>reading</span> books and want to be a <span>writer</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was a good <span>conversation</span>.<br/>
🎧 Even though we both made <span>mistakes</span>, we <span>helped</span> each other and <span>learned</span> new <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 After school, <span>Anna</span> and I <span>decided</span> to <span>explore</span> our <span>neighborhood</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>found</span> a small <span>park</span> <span>nearby</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>sat</span> on a <span>bench</span> and <span>talked</span> about our first day.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna</span> said she <span>liked</span> the class and the <span>teacher</span>.<br/>
🎧 I agreed.<br/>
🎧 We both <span>felt</span> more <span>confident</span> about <span>learning</span> English.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>evening</span>, we <span>cooked</span> dinner together.<br/>
🎧 We made a simple <span>pasta</span> <span>dish</span>.<br/>
🎧 As we <span>cooked</span>, we <span>practiced</span> English.<br/>
🎧 <span>Pass</span> me the <span>salt</span>, please, <span>Anna</span> said.<br/>
🎧 Here you go, I <span>replied</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>laughed</span> and <span>enjoyed</span> our <span>meal</span>.<br/>
🎧 The next day, we had a <span>listening</span> <span>exercise</span> in class.<br/>
🎧 Ms. <span>Parker</span> <span>played</span> a <span>recording</span> of a <span>conversation</span> between two people.<br/>
🎧 We had to listen <span>carefully</span> and answer <span>questions</span>.<br/>
🎧 At first, it was <span>hard</span> to <span>understand</span> everything, but Ms. <span>Parker</span> <span>played</span> the <span>recording</span> <span>several</span> <span>times</span>.<br/>
🎧 Each time, I <span>understood</span> a little more.<br/>
🎧 After the <span>listening</span> <span>exercise</span>, we had a <span>reading</span> <span>activity</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ms. <span>Parker</span> gave us a short <span>story</span> to read.<br/>
🎧 The <span>story</span> was about a girl who <span>moves</span> to a new <span>city</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>reminded</span> me of my own <span>experience</span>.<br/>
🎧 We read the <span>story</span> together and then <span>discussed</span> it.<br/>
🎧 Ms. <span>Parker</span> <span>asked</span> us <span>questions</span> about the <span>story</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>helped</span> us <span>understand</span> the <span>text</span> better and learn new <span>vocabulary</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>afternoon</span>, we did a <span>writing</span> <span>exercise</span>.<br/>
🎧 We had to <span>write</span> a short <span>paragraph</span> about our <span>favorite</span> place in our home <span>country</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>wrote</span> about a <span>beautiful</span> <span>beach</span> near my <span>hometown</span>.<br/>
🎧 It has <span>golden</span> <span>sand</span> and <span>clear</span> <span>blue</span> water.<br/>
🎧 <span>Writing</span> in English was <span>challenging</span>, but I <span>felt</span> <span>proud</span> of my work.<br/>
🎧 After school, <span>Anna</span>, <span>Hiroshi</span>, and I went to a <span>coffee</span> <span>shop</span>.<br/>
🎧 We wanted to practice <span>speaking</span> English outside of class.<br/>
🎧 We <span>ordered</span> our <span>drinks</span> in English and <span>found</span> a <span>table</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>talked</span> about our day and our <span>plans</span> for the weekend.<br/>
🎧 It was fun and <span>helped</span> us feel more <span>comfortable</span> <span>using</span> English in <span>real-life</span> <span>situations</span>.<br/>
🎧 On <span>Saturday</span>, <span>Anna</span> and I <span>decided</span> to visit some famous <span>places</span> in New <span>York</span>.<br/>
🎧 We took the <span>subway</span> to <span>Times</span> <span>Square</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was amazing.<br/>
🎧 The <span>lights</span>, the big <span>screens</span>, and the <span>crowds</span> were all so <span>exciting</span>.<br/>
🎧 We took many <span>pictures</span> and even <span>bought</span> some <span>souvenirs</span>.<br/>
🎧 Next, we <span>visited</span> <span>Central</span> <span>Park</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was nice to <span>walk</span> in the <span>park</span> and see the <span>green</span> <span>trees</span> and the <span>lake</span>.<br/>
🎧 We saw people <span>jogging</span>, <span>walking</span> their <span>dogs</span>, and having <span>picnics</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>found</span> a <span>quiet</span> <span>spot</span> and <span>sat</span> down to <span>rest</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna</span> and I <span>talked</span> about our <span>families</span> and our <span>homes</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was a good way to practice English and get to know each other better.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>afternoon</span>, we went to the <span>Museum</span> of <span>Modern</span> <span>Art</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>art</span> was <span>interesting</span>, and we <span>learned</span> a lot.<br/>
🎧 We <span>tried</span> to read the <span>information</span> about the <span>paintings</span> in English.<br/>
🎧 Some <span>words</span> were new, but we <span>helped</span> each other <span>understand</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was a great <span>learning</span> <span>experience</span>.<br/>
🎧 On <span>Sunday</span>, I <span>decided</span> to do some <span>studying</span>.<br/>
🎧 I wanted to <span>review</span> what I had <span>learned</span> in class.<br/>
🎧 I read some English books and <span>watched</span> a movie with English <span>subtitles</span>.<br/>
🎧 I also <span>practiced</span> <span>writing</span> by <span>keeping</span> a <span>journal</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>wrote</span> about my <span>experiences</span> in New <span>York</span> so <span>far</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Writing</span> <span>helped</span> me remember new <span>words</span> and practice <span>sentence</span> <span>structure</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>evening</span>, <span>Anna</span> and I <span>cooked</span> dinner again.<br/>
🎧 This time we made <span>tacos</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>talked</span> about our <span>plans</span> for the week.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna</span> wanted to find a <span>part-time</span> <span>job</span> to practice her English more.<br/>
🎧 I thought it was a good idea and <span>decided</span> to look for a <span>job</span> too.<br/>
🎧 The next day at school, Ms. <span>Parker</span> <span>taught</span> us about English <span>grammar</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>learned</span> about <span>verb</span> <span>tenses</span> and how to use them <span>correctly</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was a bit <span>difficult</span>, but Ms. <span>Parker</span> <span>explained</span> everything <span>clearly</span>.<br/>
🎧 We did some <span>exercises</span> to practice.<br/>
🎧 I <span>felt</span> more <span>confident</span> about <span>using</span> different <span>tenses</span> in my <span>sentences</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>afternoon</span>, we had a <span>speaking</span> <span>activity</span>.<br/>
🎧 We had to <span>pretend</span> we were in different <span>situations</span>, like at a <span>restaurant</span> or a <span>store</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>paired</span> with <span>Maria</span> from <span>Mexico</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>practiced</span> <span>ordering</span> food in a <span>restaurant</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was a fun <span>activity</span> and <span>helped</span> us practice <span>real-life</span> <span>conversations</span>.<br/>
🎧 After school, <span>Anna</span> and I went to the <span>job</span> <span>center</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>looked</span> at the <span>job</span> <span>listings</span> and <span>asked</span> the <span>staff</span> for advice.<br/>
🎧 They were very <span>helpful</span> and gave us some <span>tips</span> on <span>finding</span> <span>part-time</span> <span>jobs</span>.<br/>
🎧 They said that working in a <span>cafe</span> or a <span>store</span> would be a good way to practice our English.<br/>
🎧 We <span>filled</span> out some <span>job</span> <span>applications</span> and <span>left</span> our <span>contact</span> <span>information</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>felt</span> <span>nervous</span> but also <span>excited</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>hoped</span> to find a <span>job</span> where I could use my English and learn more about <span>American</span> <span>culture</span>.<br/>
🎧 That <span>evening</span>, I called my <span>family</span> in <span>Spain</span>.<br/>
🎧 I told them about my <span>experiences</span> in New <span>York</span> and my new friends.<br/>
🎧 They were happy to hear that I was doing well.<br/>
🎧 I <span>missed</span> them, but I <span>knew</span> I was <span>learning</span> a lot and <span>growing</span> as a person.<br/>
🎧 The next few <span>days</span> at school were <span>busy</span>.<br/>
🎧 We had more <span>grammar</span> <span>lessons</span>, <span>listening</span> <span>exercises</span>, and <span>speaking</span> <span>activities</span>.<br/>
🎧 I could feel my English <span>improving</span> little by little.<br/>
🎧 I made sure to practice every day, even outside of class.<br/>
🎧 One day, Ms. <span>Parker</span> <span>asked</span> us to give short <span>presentations</span> about our <span>countries</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>nervous</span>, but I <span>prepared</span> well.<br/>
🎧 I <span>talked</span> about <span>Spain</span>, its <span>culture</span>, and famous <span>landmarks</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>classmates</span> <span>enjoyed</span> my <span>presentation</span>, and I <span>felt</span> <span>proud</span> of myself.<br/>
🎧 <span>Giving</span> the <span>presentation</span> <span>helped</span> me practice <span>speaking</span> in <span>front</span> of a group and <span>improved</span> my <span>confidence</span>.<br/>
🎧 On <span>Friday</span>, <span>Anna</span> and I got a call from a <span>cafe</span> we had <span>applied</span> to.<br/>
🎧 They wanted to <span>interview</span> us for <span>part-time</span> <span>positions</span>.<br/>
🎧 We were <span>excited</span> and a little <span>nervous</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>prepared</span> by <span>practicing</span> <span>common</span> <span>interview</span> <span>questions</span> in English.<br/>
🎧 We <span>helped</span> each other and gave <span>tips</span> on how to answer <span>confidently</span>.<br/>
🎧 The next day, we went to the <span>cafe</span> for the <span>interview</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>manager</span>, <span>Lucy</span>, was very kind.<br/>
🎧 She <span>asked</span> us about our <span>previous</span> <span>experience</span> and why we wanted to work at the <span>cafe</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>explained</span> that I wanted to <span>improve</span> my English and learn more about <span>American</span> <span>culture</span>.<br/>

🎧 She <span>decided</span> to give us a <span>chance</span>.<br/>

🎧 It was a fun and <span>relaxing</span> <span>evening</span>.<br/>
🎧 As I went to bed that <span>night</span>, I <span>felt</span> <span>grateful</span> for the <span>opportunities</span> I had.<br/>
🎧 New <span>York</span> was a big and <span>busy</span> <span>city</span>, but it was also full of <span>chances</span> to learn and <span>grow</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>knew</span> there would be <span>challenges</span> ahead, but I was ready to <span>face</span> them with a <span>positive</span> <span>attitude</span> and a <span>smile</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>journey</span> in New <span>York</span> was just <span>beginning</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>excited</span> to see what the future <span>held</span> and how much more I could learn and <span>achieve</span>.<br/>
🎧 With my friends by my side and my <span>determination</span> to <span>succeed</span>, I <span>knew</span> I could make the most of my time in this amazing <span>city</span>.<br/>
<br/><br/>

<h2  id="es-1-735">Starting a New Job</h2>

🎧 On <span>Monday</span>, <span>Anna</span> and I <span>started</span> our new <span>jobs</span> at the <span>cafe</span>.<br/>
🎧 We were both <span>excited</span> and a bit <span>nervous</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>cafe</span> was <span>cozy</span> and had a <span>friendly</span> <span>atmosphere</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>located</span> in a <span>busy</span> <span>part</span> of the <span>city</span>, so there were always many <span>customers</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>met</span> <span>Lucy</span>, the <span>manager</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>introduced</span> us to our new <span>colleagues</span>.<br/>
🎧 They were all very nice and <span>welcoming</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Lucy</span> <span>showed</span> us around the <span>cafe</span> and <span>explained</span> our <span>tasks</span>.<br/>
🎧 We would take <span>orders</span>, make <span>drinks</span>, <span>serve</span> food, and <span>clean</span> <span>tables</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>sounded</span> simple, but I <span>knew</span> it would be a good way to practice English.<br/>
🎧 <span>Lucy</span> also told us that we would have a short <span>training</span> <span>session</span> to learn how to use the <span>cash</span> <span>register</span> and the <span>coffee</span> <span>machines</span>.<br/>
🎧 During the <span>training</span>, we <span>practiced</span> taking <span>orders</span> and <span>making</span> <span>drinks</span>.<br/>
🎧 At first, it was <span>challenging</span> to remember everything, <span>especially</span> the different <span>types</span> of <span>coffee</span>, but <span>Lucy</span> was <span>patient</span> and <span>helped</span> us <span>whenever</span> we made <span>mistakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna</span> and I <span>practiced</span> together, and soon we <span>felt</span> more <span>confident</span>.<br/>
🎧 After the <span>training</span>, it was time for our first <span>real</span> <span>shift</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>nervous</span>, but I took a <span>deep</span> <span>breath</span> and <span>reminded</span> myself to <span>stay</span> <span>calm</span>.<br/>
🎧 My first <span>customer</span> was a <span>friendly</span> <span>woman</span> who <span>ordered</span> a <span>latte</span> and a <span>croissant</span>.<br/>
🎧 I took her order and <span>repeated</span> it to make sure I got it right.<br/>
🎧 She <span>smiled</span> and said, Yes, that's <span>correct</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>felt</span> <span>relieved</span>.<br/>
🎧 As the day went on, I took more <span>orders</span> and <span>became</span> more <span>comfortable</span>.<br/>
🎧 I made some <span>mistakes</span>, like <span>forgetting</span> to add <span>sugar</span> to a <span>coffee</span>, but the <span>customers</span> were <span>understanding</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>apologized</span> and quickly <span>fixed</span> the <span>mistakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Each <span>interaction</span> was a <span>chance</span> to practice my English and learn new <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna</span> and I <span>worked</span> well together.<br/>
🎧 When one of us was <span>busy</span>, the other would help out.<br/>
🎧 We <span>communicated</span> in English even when we were talking to each other.<br/>
🎧 This <span>helped</span> us <span>improve</span> our <span>language</span> <span>skills</span> and become more <span>confident</span>.<br/>
🎧 By the end of the day, we were <span>tired</span> but happy.<br/>
🎧 We had <span>survived</span> our first day at the <span>cafe</span>.<br/>
🎧 That <span>evening</span>, we <span>talked</span> about our <span>experiences</span> at the <span>cafe</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna</span> said she <span>enjoyed</span> talking to the <span>customers</span> and <span>learning</span> new things.<br/>
🎧 I agreed.<br/>
🎧 Working at the <span>cafe</span> was a great way to practice English in a <span>real-life</span> <span>setting</span>.<br/>
🎧 We also <span>appreciated</span> the <span>support</span> from our <span>colleagues</span> and <span>Lucy</span>.<br/>
🎧 The next day, I had my English class in the morning.<br/>
🎧 Ms. <span>Parker</span> <span>started</span> the <span>lesson</span> with a <span>vocabulary</span> <span>exercise</span>.<br/>
🎧 She gave us a <span>list</span> of new <span>words</span> and <span>asked</span> us to <span>write</span> <span>sentences</span> <span>using</span> them.<br/>
🎧 This <span>exercise</span> <span>helped</span> me learn new <span>words</span> and how to use them in <span>context</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>felt</span> that my <span>vocabulary</span> was <span>improving</span> every day.<br/>
🎧 After the <span>vocabulary</span> <span>exercise</span>, we had a <span>listening</span> <span>activity</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ms. <span>Parker</span> <span>played</span> a <span>recording</span> of a <span>conversation</span> between two people.<br/>
🎧 We had to listen <span>carefully</span> and answer <span>questions</span> about the <span>conversation</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>found</span> it <span>easier</span> to <span>understand</span> the <span>recording</span> than before.<br/>
🎧 My <span>listening</span> <span>skills</span> were getting better.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>afternoon</span>, we had a group <span>discussion</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ms. <span>Parker</span> gave us a <span>topic</span> to talk about: our <span>favorite</span> books.<br/>
🎧 I <span>talked</span> about a book I read in <span>Spain</span> called <span>La</span> <span>Sombra</span> <span>del</span> <span>Viento</span> by <span>Carlos</span> <span>Ruiz</span> <span>Zafón</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>explained</span> why I <span>liked</span> the book and what it was about.<br/>
🎧 My <span>classmates</span> also <span>shared</span> their <span>favorite</span> books.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>interesting</span> to hear about different books from around the <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 After class, I went to the <span>cafe</span> for my <span>shift</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna</span> and I were getting better at our <span>tasks</span>.<br/>
🎧 We made <span>fewer</span> <span>mistakes</span> and <span>felt</span> more <span>confident</span>.<br/>
🎧 We also <span>started</span> to <span>recognize</span> <span>regular</span> <span>customers</span>.<br/>
🎧 One of them was Mr. <span>Johnson</span>, an <span>elderly</span> man who came every morning for a cup of <span>black</span> <span>coffee</span> and a <span>newspaper</span>.<br/>
🎧 He was always <span>friendly</span> and <span>liked</span> to <span>chat</span> with us.<br/>
🎧 Talking to Mr. <span>Johnson</span> was a good way to practice English.<br/>
🎧 One day, Mr. <span>Johnson</span> <span>asked</span> me about my home <span>country</span>.<br/>
🎧 I told him about <span>Spain</span> and the <span>beautiful</span> <span>places</span> there.<br/>
🎧 He <span>listened</span> with <span>interest</span> and <span>asked</span> many <span>questions</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>enjoyed</span> talking to him and <span>sharing</span> my <span>culture</span>.<br/>
🎧 It made me feel more <span>connected</span> to New <span>York</span> and its people.<br/>
🎧 As the <span>days</span> went by, I <span>noticed</span> that my English was <span>improving</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>felt</span> more <span>comfortable</span> <span>speaking</span> and <span>understanding</span> the <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 I also <span>felt</span> more <span>confident</span> in my <span>job</span> at the <span>cafe</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Lucy</span> <span>praised</span> us for our <span>hard</span> work and <span>dedication</span>.<br/>
🎧 She said we were doing a great <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 On the weekend, <span>Anna</span> and I <span>decided</span> to <span>explore</span> more of New <span>York</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>visited</span> the <span>Brooklyn</span> <span>Bridge</span> and <span>walked</span> across it.<br/>
🎧 The <span>view</span> of the <span>city</span> <span>skyline</span> was amazing.<br/>
🎧 We took many <span>pictures</span> and <span>enjoyed</span> the <span>fresh</span> air.<br/>
🎧 After the <span>walk</span>, we <span>found</span> a small <span>cafe</span> and had lunch.<br/>
🎧 We <span>practiced</span> our English by <span>ordering</span> food and talking to the <span>waiter</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>afternoon</span>, we went to a <span>bookstore</span>.<br/>
🎧 I wanted to buy an English book to <span>improve</span> my <span>reading</span> <span>skills</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>found</span> a book called The <span>Catcher</span> in the <span>Rye</span> by <span>J.D</span>. <span>Salinger</span>.<br/>
🎧 The book <span>looked</span> <span>interesting</span>, and I had heard good things about it.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna</span> also <span>bought</span> a book called To <span>Kill</span> a <span>Mockingbird</span> by <span>Harper</span> <span>Lee</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>decided</span> to read our books and <span>discuss</span> them together.<br/>
🎧 On <span>Sunday</span>, I <span>spent</span> some time <span>reading</span> my new book.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>challenging</span> to read in English, but I <span>enjoyed</span> the <span>story</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>kept</span> a <span>dictionary</span> <span>nearby</span> to look up <span>words</span> I didn't know.<br/>
🎧 This <span>helped</span> me learn new <span>vocabulary</span> and <span>understand</span> the <span>text</span> better.<br/>
🎧 I also <span>wrote</span> down some new <span>words</span> and their <span>meanings</span> in a <span>notebook</span>.<br/>
🎧 This was a good way to remember them.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>evening</span>, <span>Anna</span> and I went to a <span>park</span> near our <span>apartment</span>.<br/>
🎧 We took our books and <span>found</span> a <span>quiet</span> <span>spot</span> to read.<br/>
🎧 After <span>reading</span> for a while, we <span>talked</span> about our books.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna</span> told me about the <span>characters</span> and the <span>plot</span> of her book.<br/>
🎧 I did the same.<br/>
🎧 It was a fun and <span>relaxing</span> way to practice English.<br/>
🎧 The next week, I had an important <span>lesson</span> at school.<br/>
🎧 Ms. <span>Parker</span> <span>taught</span> us about <span>idioms</span> and <span>expressions</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>explained</span> that <span>idioms</span> are <span>phrases</span> that have a different <span>meaning</span> from the <span>words</span> <span>themselves</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, It's <span>raining</span> <span>cats</span> and <span>dogs</span> <span>means</span> it's <span>raining</span> <span>heavily</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Learning</span> <span>idioms</span> was <span>interesting</span> and fun.<br/>
🎧 It also <span>helped</span> me <span>understand</span> more about the English <span>language</span> and its <span>culture</span>.<br/>
🎧 We did some <span>exercises</span> to practice <span>using</span> <span>idioms</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ms. <span>Parker</span> gave us <span>sentences</span> with <span>missing</span> <span>words</span>, and we had to <span>fill</span> in the <span>blanks</span> with the <span>correct</span> <span>idioms</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>exercise</span> <span>helped</span> us learn how to use <span>idioms</span> in <span>context</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>found</span> it <span>challenging</span> but <span>rewarding</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>afternoon</span>, we had a <span>speaking</span> <span>activity</span>.<br/>
🎧 We had to use the <span>idioms</span> we <span>learned</span> in <span>conversations</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>paired</span> with <span>Ahmed</span> from <span>Egypt</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>created</span> a <span>dialogue</span> <span>using</span> as many <span>idioms</span> as we could.<br/>
🎧 It was funny and a bit <span>silly</span>, but it <span>helped</span> us remember the <span>idioms</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>laughed</span> a lot and <span>enjoyed</span> the <span>activity</span>.<br/>
🎧 After school, I went to the <span>cafe</span> for my <span>shift</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was a <span>busy</span> day, and there were many <span>customers</span>.<br/>
🎧 I used some of the <span>idioms</span> I <span>learned</span> when talking to them.<br/>
🎧 For example, when a <span>customer</span> <span>asked</span> how the <span>weather</span> was, I said, It's <span>raining</span> <span>cats</span> and <span>dogs</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>customer</span> <span>smiled</span> and <span>understood</span> what I <span>meant</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was a good feeling to use what I had <span>learned</span> in a <span>real</span> <span>conversation</span>.<br/>
🎧 That <span>evening</span>, <span>Anna</span> and I <span>cooked</span> dinner together.<br/>
🎧 We made a <span>Spanish</span> <span>dish</span> called <span>paella</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>delicious</span>, and we <span>enjoyed</span> cooking and <span>eating</span> together.<br/>
🎧 We <span>talked</span> about our day and <span>shared</span> what we had <span>learned</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna</span> told me she had <span>learned</span> some new <span>vocabulary</span> and <span>grammar</span> <span>rules</span>.<br/>
🎧 I told her about the <span>idioms</span> and how I used them at the <span>cafe</span>.<br/>
🎧 On <span>Friday</span>, we had a special <span>event</span> at school.<br/>
🎧 Ms. <span>Parker</span> <span>organized</span> a <span>cultural</span> <span>exchange</span> day.<br/>
🎧 Each student had to <span>prepare</span> a <span>presentation</span> about their home <span>country</span>.<br/>
🎧 We could <span>bring</span> <span>pictures</span>, food, or anything that <span>represented</span> our <span>culture</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>excited</span> to share more about <span>Spain</span>.<br/>
🎧 For my <span>presentation</span>, I <span>decided</span> to talk about <span>Spanish</span> <span>festivals</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>brought</span> <span>pictures</span> of <span>La</span> <span>Tomatina</span> and the <span>Running</span> of the <span>Bulls</span>.<br/>
🎧 I also <span>brought</span> some <span>traditional</span> <span>Spanish</span> <span>sweets</span> called <span>turrón</span>.<br/>
🎧 When it was my <span>turn</span>, I <span>showed</span> the <span>pictures</span> and <span>explained</span> the <span>festivals</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>classmates</span> <span>enjoyed</span> the <span>presentation</span> and <span>asked</span> many <span>questions</span>.<br/>
🎧 They also <span>liked</span> the <span>turrón</span> and <span>thanked</span> me for <span>sharing</span> it.<br/>
🎧 After the <span>presentations</span>, we had a <span>potluck</span> lunch.<br/>
🎧 Each student <span>brought</span> a <span>dish</span> from their <span>country</span>.<br/>
🎧 There was <span>sushi</span> from <span>Japan</span>, <span>tacos</span> from <span>Mexico</span>, <span>falafel</span> from <span>Egypt</span>, and <span>brigadeiros</span> from <span>Brazil</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was a <span>delicious</span> and <span>multicultural</span> <span>meal</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>tried</span> different <span>foods</span> and <span>learned</span> more about each <span>other's</span> <span>cultures</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was a fun and <span>memorable</span> day.<br/>
🎧 That weekend, <span>Anna</span> and I went to a music <span>festival</span> in <span>Central</span> <span>Park</span>.<br/>
🎧 There were many <span>bands</span> playing different <span>types</span> of music.<br/>
🎧 We <span>enjoyed</span> the <span>performances</span> and <span>danced</span> to the music.<br/>
🎧 It was a great way to <span>relax</span> and have fun after a <span>busy</span> week.<br/>
🎧 We also <span>met</span> some new friends at the <span>festival</span>.<br/>
🎧 They were from different <span>countries</span> and were also <span>learning</span> English.<br/>
🎧 We <span>exchanged</span> <span>contact</span> <span>information</span> and <span>planned</span> to meet again.<br/>
🎧 On <span>Sunday</span>, I <span>spent</span> some time <span>studying</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>reviewed</span> my <span>notes</span> from class and <span>practiced</span> <span>using</span> <span>idioms</span>.<br/>
🎧 I also read more of my book and <span>wrote</span> in my <span>journal</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Writing</span> in English was <span>becoming</span> <span>easier</span> for me.<br/>
🎧 I <span>felt</span> <span>proud</span> of my <span>progress</span>.<br/>

🎧 We <span>chose</span> a <span>comedy</span> called The <span>Intern</span>.<br/>

🎧 Ms. <span>Parker</span> <span>taught</span> us about <span>prepositions</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>explained</span> how to use <span>prepositions</span> of time, place, and <span>direction</span>.<br/>
🎧 We did some <span>exercises</span> to practice <span>using</span> them <span>correctly</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was a bit <span>tricky</span>, but Ms. <span>Parker's</span> <span>explanations</span> were <span>clear</span> and <span>helpful</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>afternoon</span>, we had a <span>speaking</span> <span>activity</span>.<br/>

🎧 It was <span>huge</span> and very <span>impressive</span>.<br/>
🎧 Inside the <span>museum</span>, I got a map to help me <span>navigate</span> through the <span>galleries</span>.<br/>

🎧 I saw a famous <span>painting</span> called <span>Washington</span> <span>Crossing</span> the <span>Delaware</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>depicted</span> <span>George</span> <span>Washington</span> <span>leading</span> his <span>troops</span> during the <span>American</span> <span>Revolutionary</span> War.<br/>
🎧 The <span>painting</span> was large and <span>powerful</span>, and I could feel the <span>emotion</span> and <span>determination</span> of the <span>soldiers</span>.<br/>
🎧 After spending <span>several</span> hours at the <span>museum</span>, I <span>decided</span> to take a <span>break</span>.<br/>
🎧 I went to the <span>museum</span> <span>cafe</span> and <span>ordered</span> a cup of tea and a <span>slice</span> of <span>cake</span>.<br/>
🎧 While I <span>enjoyed</span> my <span>snack</span>, I <span>reflected</span> on everything I had <span>seen</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>museum</span> was full of <span>incredible</span> <span>art</span> and <span>history</span>, and I <span>felt</span> <span>grateful</span> for the <span>opportunity</span> to learn and <span>explore</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I <span>finished</span> my tea, I <span>visited</span> the <span>gift</span> <span>shop</span>.<br/>
🎧 I wanted to buy a <span>souvenir</span> to remember my visit.<br/>
🎧 I <span>found</span> a <span>beautiful</span> <span>postcard</span> of <span>Van</span> <span>Gogh's</span> <span>Starry</span> <span>Night</span> and a small book about the <span>museum's</span> <span>highlights</span>.<br/>
🎧 I also <span>bought</span> a <span>keychain</span> with a <span>tiny</span> <span>replica</span> of the <span>museum</span> <span>building</span>.<br/>
🎧 These <span>items</span> would <span>remind</span> me of my wonderful day at the <span>Met</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>evening</span>, I <span>returned</span> home and <span>shared</span> my <span>experience</span> with <span>Anna</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>showed</span> her the <span>pictures</span> I took and the <span>souvenirs</span> I <span>bought</span>.<br/>
🎧 She was <span>excited</span> and <span>asked</span> me many <span>questions</span> about the <span>museum</span>.<br/>
🎧 Wow, <span>Laura</span>, it sounds like you had an amazing day, <span>Anna</span> said.<br/>
🎧 I definitely want to visit the <span>museum</span> too.<br/>
🎧 Maybe we can go together next time.<br/>
🎧 That would be great, <span>Anna</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think you'll love it.<br/>
🎧 There's so much to see and learn, I <span>replied</span>.<br/>
🎧 The next day at school, <span>Miss</span> <span>Parker</span> <span>asked</span> us to <span>write</span> a short <span>essay</span> about our <span>favorite</span> <span>experience</span> in New <span>York</span> so <span>far</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>decided</span> to <span>write</span> about my visit to the <span>museum</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>described</span> the different <span>galleries</span>, the <span>artworks</span> I saw, and my <span>conversation</span> with <span>Emma</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Writing</span> the <span>essay</span> <span>helped</span> me practice my English and <span>organize</span> my <span>thoughts</span>.<br/>
🎧 After we <span>finished</span> <span>writing</span>, we <span>shared</span> our <span>essays</span> with the class.<br/>
🎧 I <span>enjoyed</span> <span>listening</span> to my <span>classmates'</span> <span>stories</span>.<br/>
🎧 Each person had a <span>unique</span> <span>experience</span>, and it was <span>interesting</span> to hear about their <span>adventures</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Ahmed</span> <span>talked</span> about the <span>baseball</span> game, <span>Hiroshi</span> <span>shared</span> his visit to the <span>botanical</span> garden, and <span>Elizabeth</span> <span>described</span> her cooking <span>experience</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Miss</span> <span>Parker</span> gave us <span>feedback</span> on our <span>essays</span> and <span>helped</span> us <span>improve</span> our <span>writing</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>pointed</span> out some <span>grammar</span> <span>mistakes</span> and <span>suggested</span> better <span>ways</span> to <span>express</span> our <span>ideas</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>appreciated</span> her <span>guidance</span> and <span>felt</span> that my <span>writing</span> was getting better.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>afternoon</span>, we had a <span>listening</span> <span>activity</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Miss</span> <span>Parker</span> <span>played</span> a <span>recording</span> of a <span>radio</span> <span>interview</span> with a famous <span>artist</span>.<br/>
🎧 We had to listen <span>carefully</span> and answer <span>questions</span> about the <span>interview</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>exercise</span> <span>helped</span> me <span>improve</span> my <span>listening</span> <span>skills</span> and learn more about <span>art</span>.<br/>
🎧 After school, I went to the <span>cafe</span> for my <span>shift</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was a <span>busy</span> day, but I <span>felt</span> more <span>confident</span> in my <span>tasks</span>.<br/>
🎧 I took <span>orders</span>, made <span>drinks</span>, and <span>talked</span> to <span>customers</span>.<br/>
🎧 I also <span>practiced</span> <span>using</span> the new <span>vocabulary</span> I had <span>learned</span> in class.<br/>
🎧 Each day at the <span>cafe</span> was a <span>chance</span> to practice and <span>improve</span> my English.<br/>
🎧 One of the <span>regular</span> <span>customers</span>, <span>Mrs</span>. <span>Collins</span>, came in for her <span>usual</span> <span>cappuccino</span>.<br/>
🎧 She was a kind and <span>elegant</span> <span>lady</span> who always had a <span>smile</span> on her <span>face</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>enjoyed</span> talking to her and <span>learning</span> about her life.<br/>
🎧 Hello, <span>Laura</span>.<br/>
🎧 How are you today? <span>Mrs</span>. <span>Collins</span> <span>asked</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hi, <span>Mrs</span>. <span>Collins</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm doing well, thank you.<br/>
🎧 How about you? I <span>replied</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm good, thank you.<br/>
🎧 How is your English <span>learning</span> going? she <span>asked</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's going well.<br/>
🎧 I <span>visited</span> the <span>Metropolitan</span> <span>Museum</span> of <span>Art</span> <span>yesterday</span> and <span>learned</span> a lot, I said.<br/>
🎧 That's wonderful.<br/>
🎧 The <span>Met</span> is one of my <span>favorite</span> <span>places</span> in the <span>city</span>.<br/>
🎧 Did you see the <span>Impressionist</span> <span>gallery</span>? <span>Mrs</span>. <span>Collins</span> <span>asked</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I did.<br/>
🎧 It was amazing.<br/>
🎧 I loved <span>Monet's</span> <span>paintings</span>, I <span>replied</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Monet</span> is wonderful.<br/>
🎧 I'm glad you <span>enjoyed</span> your visit.<br/>
🎧 Keep <span>practicing</span> your English, <span>Laura</span>.<br/>
🎧 You're doing great, she said with a <span>smile</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you, <span>Mrs</span>. <span>Collins</span>.<br/>
🎧 I will, I <span>replied</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>evening</span>, <span>Anna</span> and I <span>decided</span> to try cooking a new <span>dish</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>chose</span> to make an <span>Italian</span> <span>pasta</span> <span>recipe</span> that <span>Anna</span> had <span>found</span> online.<br/>
🎧 We went to the <span>grocery</span> <span>store</span> to buy the <span>ingredients</span> and then <span>returned</span> home to start cooking.<br/>
🎧 The <span>recipe</span> was simple, but it was a fun and <span>relaxing</span> <span>activity</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>practiced</span> our English by <span>reading</span> the <span>recipe</span> <span>instructions</span> and talking about the <span>steps</span>.<br/>
🎧 While we <span>cooked</span>, we <span>talked</span> about our day.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna</span> <span>shared</span> her <span>experience</span> at the <span>cafe</span>, and I told her about the new <span>vocabulary</span> I had <span>learned</span> at school.<br/>
🎧 We also <span>talked</span> about our <span>plans</span> for the weekend.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna</span> <span>suggested</span> <span>visiting</span> a <span>flea</span> <span>market</span> she had heard about, and I agreed.<br/>
🎧 It <span>sounded</span> like a fun and <span>interesting</span> place to <span>explore</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've always wanted to visit a <span>flea</span> <span>market</span>, I said.<br/>
🎧 I've heard you can find some really <span>unique</span> things there.<br/>
🎧 Exactly, and it's a great way to <span>spend</span> the weekend, <span>Anna</span> <span>replied</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>pasta</span> <span>turned</span> out <span>delicious</span>, and we <span>enjoyed</span> our dinner together.<br/>
🎧 <span>Afterward</span>, we <span>watched</span> an English movie called The <span>Secret</span> Life of <span>Walter</span> <span>Mitty</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was a <span>heartwarming</span> and <span>adventurous</span> <span>film</span>, and we both <span>enjoyed</span> it.<br/>
🎧 Watching <span>movies</span> in English <span>helped</span> us <span>improve</span> our <span>listening</span> <span>skills</span> and learn new <span>expressions</span>.<br/>
🎧 On <span>Friday</span>, Ms. <span>Parker</span> gave us a special <span>assignment</span>.<br/>
🎧 We had to <span>prepare</span> a <span>presentation</span> about a famous person from our home <span>country</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>decided</span> to talk about <span>Pablo</span> <span>Picasso</span>, one of the most famous <span>Spanish</span> <span>artists</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>spent</span> the <span>evening</span> <span>researching</span> and <span>preparing</span> my <span>presentation</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>found</span> <span>interesting</span> <span>facts</span> about his life and his <span>contribution</span> to <span>art</span>.<br/>
🎧 I also <span>selected</span> some of his famous <span>paintings</span> to show to the class.<br/>
🎧 As I <span>worked</span> on my <span>presentation</span>, I <span>felt</span> a <span>sense</span> of <span>pride</span> in my <span>culture</span> and <span>heritage</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was a wonderful <span>opportunity</span> to share a <span>piece</span> of my home <span>country</span> with my <span>classmates</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>excited</span> to <span>present</span> and <span>hoped</span> that they would enjoy <span>learning</span> about <span>Picasso</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I went to bed that <span>night</span>, I <span>felt</span> <span>content</span> and <span>accomplished</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'd <span>learned</span> so much in the <span>past</span> few <span>days</span> and had many wonderful <span>experiences</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>journey</span> in New <span>York</span> was full of <span>discoveries</span> and new <span>challenges</span>, but I was <span>determined</span> to make the most of it.<br/>
🎧 I <span>knew</span> that with <span>hard</span> work and <span>perseverance</span>, I could <span>achieve</span> my <span>goals</span> and <span>dreams</span>.<br/>
🎧 The next <span>part</span> of my <span>adventure</span> was <span>waiting</span>, and I was ready to <span>embrace</span> it with an open <span>heart</span> and a <span>curious</span> <span>mind</span>.<br/>
<br/><br/>

<h2 id="es-1-2530">The Joy of Learning and New Friendships</h2>

🎧 <span>Saturday</span> <span>arrived</span> with <span>bright</span> <span>sunshine</span>, <span>promising</span> a <span>beautiful</span> day ahead.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anna</span> and I had <span>decided</span> to visit the <span>flea</span> <span>market</span> she <span>mentioned</span> <span>earlier</span>.<br/>
🎧 We were both <span>excited</span> about the <span>potential</span> <span>treasures</span> we might find and the new <span>experiences</span> <span>awaiting</span> us.<br/>
🎧 At <span>breakfast</span>, we <span>discussed</span> our plan for the day.<br/>
🎧 I'm really looking forward to the <span>flea</span> <span>market</span>, <span>Anna</span> said as she <span>poured</span> <span>herself</span> a cup of <span>coffee</span>.<br/>
🎧 I heard they have everything from <span>vintage</span> <span>clothes</span> to <span>handmade</span> <span>crafts</span>.<br/>
🎧 Me too, I <span>replied</span>, <span>spreading</span> <span>butter</span> on my <span>toast</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's going to be fun <span>exploring</span> and maybe <span>finding</span> some <span>unique</span> <span>items</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Plus</span>, it's a great way to practice our English.<br/>
🎧 After <span>breakfast</span>, we got ready and <span>headed</span> to the <span>subway</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>flea</span> <span>market</span> was <span>located</span> in a different <span>part</span> of the <span>city</span> that we hadn't <span>visited</span> before.<br/>
🎧 The <span>ride</span> was a bit long, but we <span>chatted</span> about <span>various</span> things, <span>making</span> the time <span>pass</span> quickly.<br/>
🎧 When we <span>arrived</span>, the <span>market</span> was <span>bustling</span> with <span>activity</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Stalls</span> <span>lined</span> the <span>streets</span>, each one <span>displaying</span> a <span>variety</span> of <span>goods</span>.<br/>
🎧 There were <span>clothes</span>, <span>jewelry</span>, books, <span>antiques</span>, and much more.<br/>
🎧 The air was <span>filled</span> with the sounds of people <span>bargaining</span> and the <span>smells</span> of different <span>foods</span> cooking.<br/>
🎧 Wow, this place is amazing, I said, looking around in <span>awe</span>.<br/>
🎧 Where should we start?<br/>
🎧 Let's just <span>wander</span> around and see what <span>catches</span> our eye, <span>Anna</span> <span>suggested</span>.<br/>
🎧 We can <span>split</span> up and meet back here in an <span>hour</span> if you want.<br/>
🎧 Good idea, I agreed.<br/>
🎧 I'll see you in an <span>hour</span> then.<br/>
🎧 I <span>began</span> <span>strolling</span> through the <span>market</span>, <span>stopping</span> at different <span>stalls</span> to look at the <span>items</span> on <span>display</span>.<br/>
🎧 At one <span>stall</span>, I <span>found</span> a <span>beautiful</span> <span>necklace</span> with a small <span>intricate</span> <span>pendant</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>vendor</span>, an <span>elderly</span> <span>woman</span> with a <span>warm</span> <span>smile</span>, <span>noticed</span> my <span>interest</span>.<br/>
🎧 Hello, <span>dear</span>, she said.<br/>
🎧 Isn't this <span>necklace</span> <span>lovely</span>?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>handmade</span>, and the <span>pendant</span> is <span>carved</span> from a special kind of <span>stone</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's <span>beautiful</span>, I <span>replied</span>.<br/>
🎧 How much is it?<br/>
🎧 It's <span>$20</span>, she said.<br/>
🎧 But for you, I'll give it for <span>$15</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you, I said, <span>appreciating</span> her <span>kindness</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>paid</span> for the <span>necklace</span> and <span>continued</span> <span>exploring</span> the <span>market</span>, feeling happy with my <span>purchase</span>.<br/>
🎧 As I <span>walked</span>, I came across a <span>stall</span> <span>selling</span> old books.<br/>
🎧 Being an English <span>literature</span> student, I was <span>instantly</span> <span>drawn</span> to it.<br/>
🎧 I <span>began</span> <span>browsing</span> through the <span>collection</span>, <span>hoping</span> to find something <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 Do you like <span>reading</span>?<br/>
🎧 the <span>stall</span> <span>owner</span> <span>asked</span>, <span>noticing</span> my <span>interest</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, I love <span>reading</span>, I <span>replied</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>studying</span> English <span>literature</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's wonderful, he said.<br/>
🎧 I have some <span>classic</span> <span>novels</span> here that you might enjoy.<br/>
🎧 Take your time and look around.<br/>
🎧 I <span>spent</span> a good amount of time at the <span>bookstall</span>, <span>flipping</span> through <span>various</span> books.<br/>
🎧 I <span>found</span> an old <span>edition</span> of <span>Pride</span> and <span>Prejudice</span> by <span>Jane</span> <span>Austen</span>, one of my <span>favorite</span> <span>novels</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was a bit <span>worn</span>, but that only <span>added</span> to its <span>charm</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>decided</span> to buy it and <span>added</span> it to my <span>growing</span> <span>collection</span> of English books.<br/>
🎧 After an <span>hour</span> of <span>exploring</span>, I <span>met</span> up with <span>Anna</span> at our agreed <span>spot</span>.<br/>
🎧 She had a big <span>smile</span> on her <span>face</span> and was <span>holding</span> a bag full of <span>items</span>.<br/>
🎧 Look what I <span>found</span>, <span>Anna</span> <span>exclaimed</span>, <span>showing</span> me her <span>purchases</span>.<br/>
🎧 She had <span>bought</span> a <span>vintage</span> <span>dress</span>, a <span>pair</span> of <span>earrings</span>, and a small <span>painting</span>.<br/>
🎧 This place is amazing.<br/>
🎧 What did you get?<br/>
🎧 I got this <span>beautiful</span> <span>necklace</span> and an old <span>edition</span> of <span>Pride</span> and <span>Prejudice</span>, I <span>replied</span>, <span>showing</span> her my <span>items</span>.<br/>
🎧 Nice!<br/>
🎧 That <span>necklace</span> is <span>lovely</span>, <span>Anna</span> said, and <span>Pride</span> and <span>Prejudice</span> is such a great book.<br/>
🎧 We <span>decided</span> to take a <span>break</span> and get something to eat.<br/>
🎧 There were many food <span>stalls</span> at the <span>market</span> <span>offering</span> a <span>variety</span> of <span>delicious</span> options.<br/>
🎧 We <span>chose</span> a <span>stall</span> that <span>sold</span> <span>empanadas</span> and <span>ordered</span> a few to share.<br/>
🎧 While we <span>ate</span>, we <span>talked</span> about our <span>experience</span> at the <span>market</span>.<br/>
🎧 I love <span>places</span> like this, <span>Anna</span> said.<br/>
🎧 You never know what you'll find, and it's a great way to meet new people and practice English.<br/>
🎧 Exactly, I agreed.<br/>
🎧 I've already had a few <span>conversations</span> with the <span>vendors</span>, and it <span>feels</span> good to use English in <span>real-life</span> <span>situations</span>.<br/>
🎧 After <span>finishing</span> our <span>meal</span>, we <span>continued</span> <span>exploring</span> the <span>market</span> for a while <span>longer</span>.<br/>
🎧 We took our time <span>enjoying</span> the <span>atmosphere</span> and <span>discovering</span> more <span>interesting</span> <span>items</span>.<br/>
🎧 As the <span>afternoon</span> went on, we <span>decided</span> to <span>head</span> back home.<br/>
🎧 On the <span>subway</span> <span>ride</span> back, we <span>chatted</span> about our day.<br/>
🎧 I think we should come back to this <span>market</span> sometime, <span>Anna</span> said.<br/>
🎧 There's still so much to see.<br/>
🎧 I agree, I said.<br/>
🎧 It was a lot of fun, and I feel like I've <span>learned</span> a lot just by talking to people and <span>seeing</span> all the different things here.<br/>
🎧 When we got home, I took some time to read the old <span>edition</span> of <span>Pride</span> and <span>Prejudice</span> I had <span>bought</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>felt</span> special to read from a book that had been around for so long.<br/>
🎧 The <span>story</span> of <span>Elizabeth</span> <span>Bennet</span> and Mr. <span>Darcy</span> never <span>failed</span> to <span>captivate</span> me.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>evening</span>, we <span>decided</span> to <span>watch</span> another English movie.<br/>
🎧 This time, we <span>chose</span> The <span>Pursuit</span> of <span>Happyness</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was an <span>inspiring</span> <span>film</span> about <span>perseverance</span> and hope, and we both <span>enjoyed</span> it a lot.<br/>
🎧 Watching <span>movies</span> in English had become one of our <span>favorite</span> <span>ways</span> to <span>improve</span> our <span>language</span> <span>skills</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sunday</span> was a <span>relaxing</span> day.<br/>
🎧 I <span>spent</span> the morning working on my <span>presentation</span> about <span>Pablo</span> <span>Picasso</span>.<br/>
🎧 I wanted it to be perfect, so I made sure to <span>include</span> all the important <span>details</span> about his life and work.<br/>
🎧 I also <span>practiced</span> <span>speaking</span> out <span>loud</span> to <span>improve</span> my <span>pronunciation</span> and <span>fluency</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>afternoon</span>, <span>Anna</span> and I went for a <span>walk</span> in <span>Central</span> <span>Park</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was a <span>beautiful</span> day, and the <span>park</span> was full of people <span>enjoying</span> the <span>sunshine</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>walked</span> along the <span>paths</span>, talking about our <span>goals</span> and <span>dreams</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>felt</span> good to share our <span>thoughts</span> and <span>support</span> each other.<br/>
🎧 I really want to become <span>fluent</span> in English, I said.<br/>
🎧 It's a big <span>goal</span>, but I know I can do it with <span>hard</span> work and practice.<br/>
🎧 You will, <span>Laura</span>, <span>Anna</span> <span>replied</span>.<br/>
🎧 You're already <span>making</span> great <span>progress</span>, and remember, I'm here to help you.<br/>
🎧 Thanks, <span>Anna</span>, you're a great friend, I said with a <span>smile</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>found</span> a <span>quiet</span> <span>spot</span> in the <span>park</span> and <span>sat</span> down to <span>relax</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>watched</span> people <span>jogging</span>, children playing, and <span>couples</span> <span>walking</span> <span>hand</span> in <span>hand</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>park</span> was <span>alive</span> with <span>activity</span>, and it was a perfect place to <span>reflect</span> and <span>unwind</span>.<br/>
🎧 On <span>Monday</span>, it was time to <span>present</span> my <span>project</span> about <span>Pablo</span> <span>Picasso</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>nervous</span> but also <span>excited</span> to share what I had <span>learned</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ms. <span>Parker</span> had <span>arranged</span> for each student to <span>present</span> in <span>front</span> of the class, and I was <span>determined</span> to do my best.<br/>
🎧 When it was my <span>turn</span>, I took a <span>deep</span> <span>breath</span> and <span>walked</span> to the <span>front</span> of the class.<br/>
🎧 Hello, everyone, I <span>began</span>.<br/>
🎧 Today, I want to tell you about <span>Pablo</span> <span>Picasso</span>, a famous <span>Spanish</span> <span>artist</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>talked</span> about <span>Picasso's</span> <span>early</span> life, his <span>artistic</span> <span>journey</span>, and his most famous <span>works</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>showed</span> <span>pictures</span> of his <span>paintings</span> and <span>explained</span> their <span>significance</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>classmates</span> <span>listened</span> <span>attentively</span>, and I <span>felt</span> more <span>confident</span> as I <span>continued</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Picasso's</span> <span>Guernica</span> is one of his most famous <span>paintings</span>, I said, <span>showing</span> a <span>picture</span> of the <span>artwork</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>depicts</span> the <span>horrors</span> of war and has become a <span>powerful</span> <span>symbol</span> of <span>peace</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I <span>finished</span> my <span>presentation</span>, Ms. <span>Parker</span> and my <span>classmates</span> <span>clapped</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great <span>job</span>, <span>Laura</span>, Ms. <span>Parker</span> said.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>presentation</span> was <span>informative</span> and <span>well-prepared</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you for <span>sharing</span> with us.<br/>
🎧 Thank you, Ms. <span>Parker</span>, I <span>replied</span>, feeling <span>proud</span> of my work.<br/>
🎧 After all the <span>presentations</span> were done, Ms. <span>Parker</span> gave us some <span>tips</span> on how to <span>improve</span> our <span>speaking</span> <span>skills</span>.<br/>
🎧 Remember to speak <span>clearly</span> and <span>confidently</span>, she said.<br/>
🎧 Practice makes perfect, so keep working on your <span>pronunciation</span> and <span>fluency</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>afternoon</span>, we had a fun group <span>activity</span>.<br/>
🎧 Ms. <span>Parker</span> <span>divided</span> us into small <span>groups</span> and gave each group a <span>topic</span> to <span>discuss</span>.<br/>
🎧 My group had to talk about our <span>favorite</span> books and <span>authors</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was a great <span>opportunity</span> to practice <span>speaking</span> and <span>listening</span>.<br/>
🎧 I love <span>reading</span> books by <span>Jane</span> <span>Austen</span>, I said.<br/>
🎧 Her <span>stories</span> are <span>timeless</span>, and her <span>characters</span> are so well <span>written</span>.<br/>
🎧 I enjoy <span>reading</span> <span>mystery</span> <span>novels</span>, <span>Hiroshi</span> said.<br/>
🎧 <span>Agatha</span> <span>Christie</span> is one of my <span>favorite</span> <span>authors</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's <span>interesting</span>, <span>Elizabeth</span> <span>replied</span>.<br/>
🎧 I like <span>reading</span> <span>fantasy</span> books.<br/>
🎧 <span>J.K</span>. <span>Rowling's</span> <span>Harry</span> <span>Potter</span> <span>series</span> is my <span>favorite</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our group <span>discussion</span> was <span>lively</span> and <span>engaging</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>shared</span> our <span>thoughts</span> and <span>recommendations</span>, and it was fun to hear about different <span>genres</span> and <span>authors</span>.<br/>
🎧 These <span>activities</span> <span>helped</span> us practice English in a <span>natural</span> and <span>enjoyable</span> way.<br/>
🎧 After school, I went to the <span>cafe</span> for my <span>shift</span>.<br/>
🎧 As <span>usual</span>, it was <span>busy</span>, but I <span>felt</span> more <span>comfortable</span> with my <span>tasks</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>chatted</span> with <span>customers</span> and <span>practiced</span> <span>using</span> the new <span>vocabulary</span> I had <span>learned</span> in class.<br/>
🎧 Each day, I <span>felt</span> more <span>confident</span> in my <span>ability</span> to <span>communicate</span> in English.<br/>
🎧 During a <span>break</span>, I <span>talked</span> to <span>Anna</span> about our future <span>plans</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was thinking about <span>joining</span> a book <span>club</span>, I said.<br/>
🎧 It would be a great way to meet new people and <span>improve</span> my English.<br/>
🎧 That's a great idea, <span>Laura</span>, <span>Anna</span> <span>replied</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've heard there are some good book <span>clubs</span> in the <span>city</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can help you find one.<br/>
🎧 Thanks, <span>Anna</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think it would be a lot of fun, I said.<br/>
🎧 The next day at school, Ms. <span>Parker</span> <span>introduced</span> a new <span>topic</span>: <span>idiomatic</span> <span>expressions</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>explained</span> that <span>idioms</span> are <span>phrases</span> that have a different <span>meaning</span> from their <span>literal</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>learned</span> <span>expressions</span> like <span>piece</span> of <span>cake</span>, <span>meaning</span> something is easy, and <span>break</span> the ice, <span>meaning</span> to start a <span>conversation</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Idioms</span> are <span>commonly</span> used in everyday English, Ms. <span>Parker</span> said.<br/>
🎧 <span>Learning</span> them will help you <span>understand</span> <span>native</span> <span>speakers</span> better and make your <span>conversations</span> more <span>natural</span>.<br/>
🎧 To practice, we <span>played</span> a game where we had to use <span>idioms</span> in <span>sentences</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>challenging</span> but also very <span>enjoyable</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>laughed</span> at some of the funny <span>phrases</span> and <span>tried</span> to remember their <span>meanings</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'll go first, I said.<br/>
🎧 I was so <span>nervous</span> about my <span>presentation</span>, but it <span>turned</span> out to be a <span>piece</span> of <span>cake</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good one, <span>Laura</span>, Ms. <span>Parker</span> said.<br/>
🎧 Who <span>wants</span> to go next?<br/>
🎧 I'll try, <span>Hiroshi</span> said.<br/>
🎧 I was shy at first, but <span>Anna</span> <span>helped</span> me <span>break</span> the ice with new friends.<br/>
🎧 Great <span>job</span>, <span>Hiroshi</span>, Ms. <span>Parker</span> said.<br/>
🎧 Keep <span>practicing</span>, everyone.<br/>
🎧 <span>Idioms</span> can be <span>tricky</span>, but they're an important <span>part</span> of <span>learning</span> English.<br/>
🎧 After class, <span>Elizabeth</span> and I <span>decided</span> to go for a <span>walk</span> in the <span>nearby</span> <span>park</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was a nice way to <span>relax</span> and practice <span>speaking</span> English.<br/>
🎧 How do you feel about the <span>idioms</span> we <span>learned</span> today?<br/>
🎧 I <span>asked</span> <span>Elizabeth</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think they're <span>fascinating</span>, <span>Elizabeth</span> <span>replied</span>.<br/>
🎧 They add so much color to the <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's like <span>learning</span> a <span>secret</span> <span>code</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's a good way to put it, I said.<br/>
🎧 I'm going to try to use more <span>idioms</span> in my <span>conversations</span>.<br/>
🎧 It will make <span>speaking</span> English more fun.<br/>
🎧 As we <span>walked</span>, we <span>continued</span> talking about our <span>classes</span>, our <span>interests</span>, and our <span>goals</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>refreshing</span> to have <span>someone</span> to share these <span>experiences</span> with and to practice English in a <span>friendly</span> and <span>supportive</span> <span>environment</span>.<br/>
🎧 That <span>evening</span>, I called my <span>family</span> back home to <span>update</span> them on my <span>progress</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was wonderful to hear their <span>voices</span> and share my <span>experiences</span> with them.<br/>
🎧 Hello, <span>Laura</span>.<br/>
🎧 How are you? my <span>mother</span> <span>asked</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm doing great, Mom, I <span>replied</span>.<br/>
🎧 I've been <span>learning</span> a lot and having some amazing <span>experiences</span>.<br/>
🎧 That's wonderful to hear, she said.<br/>
🎧 We <span>miss</span> you, but we're so <span>proud</span> of you.<br/>
🎧 Thanks, Mom.<br/>
🎧 I <span>miss</span> you all too, but I'm really <span>enjoying</span> my time here, I said.<br/>
🎧 Keep working <span>hard</span> and remember that we're always here to <span>support</span> you, my <span>father</span> <span>added</span>.<br/>
🎧 I will, Dad.<br/>
🎧 Thanks for everything, I said.<br/>
🎧 After our <span>conversation</span>, I <span>felt</span> even more <span>motivated</span> to <span>continue</span> my <span>journey</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>family's</span> <span>support</span> <span>meant</span> the <span>world</span> to me, and I wanted to make them <span>proud</span>.<br/>
🎧 The next day, I <span>joined</span> a book <span>club</span> that <span>Anna</span> had <span>found</span> for me.<br/>
🎧 The <span>club</span> <span>met</span> once a week at a <span>local</span> <span>library</span>, and they <span>discussed</span> a different book each month.<br/>
🎧 I was <span>excited</span> to meet new people who <span>shared</span> my love for <span>reading</span>.<br/>
🎧 At the first <span>meeting</span>, I <span>introduced</span> myself to the group.<br/>
🎧 Hi, everyone.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>Laura</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm an English <span>literature</span> student, and I love <span>reading</span> all <span>kinds</span> of books.<br/>
🎧 <span>Welcome</span>, <span>Laura</span>, the group <span>leader</span> said.<br/>
🎧 We're glad to have you with us.<br/>
🎧 This month, we're <span>reading</span> To <span>Kill</span> a <span>Mockingbird</span> by <span>Harper</span> <span>Lee</span>.<br/>
🎧 Have you read it before?<br/>
🎧 Yes, I have.<br/>
🎧 It's one of my <span>favorite</span> books, I <span>replied</span>.<br/>
🎧 Great.<br/>
🎧 We're looking forward to <span>hearing</span> your <span>thoughts</span> on it, she said.<br/>
🎧 We <span>spent</span> the next <span>hour</span> <span>discussing</span> the book, its <span>themes</span>, and its <span>characters</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was a <span>lively</span> and <span>engaging</span> <span>conversation</span>, and I <span>enjoyed</span> <span>hearing</span> different <span>perspectives</span> on the <span>story</span>.<br/>
🎧 After the <span>meeting</span>, I <span>felt</span> even more <span>inspired</span> to <span>continue</span> my English <span>learning</span> <span>journey</span>.<br/>
🎧 I had <span>found</span> a <span>supportive</span> <span>community</span> and made new friends who <span>shared</span> my <span>interests</span>.<br/>
🎧 As the <span>weeks</span> went by, I <span>continued</span> to <span>immerse</span> myself in English.<br/>
🎧 I read more books, <span>watched</span> more <span>movies</span>, and <span>practiced</span> <span>speaking</span> as much as <span>possible</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>confidence</span> <span>grew</span>, and I <span>felt</span> more at <span>ease</span> with the <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 One day, Ms. <span>Parker</span> <span>announced</span> that we would be having a <span>debate</span> in class.<br/>
🎧 Each student would choose a <span>topic</span> and <span>present</span> their <span>arguments</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was an <span>exciting</span> <span>challenge</span>, and I <span>decided</span> to speak about the <span>importance</span> of <span>learning</span> a second <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Learning</span> a second <span>language</span> <span>opens</span> up so many <span>opportunities</span>, I said during the <span>debate</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>allows</span> you to <span>communicate</span> with more people, <span>understand</span> different <span>cultures</span>, and <span>gain</span> new <span>perspectives</span>.<br/>
🎧 It's a <span>valuable</span> <span>skill</span> in <span>today's</span> <span>globalized</span> <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>classmates</span> and Ms. <span>Parker</span> were <span>impressed</span> with my <span>arguments</span>.<br/>
🎧 Well done, <span>Laura</span>, Ms. <span>Parker</span> said.<br/>
🎧 You <span>presented</span> your <span>points</span> <span>clearly</span> and <span>confidently</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thank you, I <span>replied</span>, feeling <span>proud</span> of my <span>progress</span>.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>evening</span>, <span>Anna</span> and I <span>decided</span> to <span>celebrate</span> by cooking a <span>traditional</span> <span>dish</span> from our home <span>country</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>chose</span> to make <span>empanadas</span>, a <span>delicious</span> <span>pastry</span> <span>filled</span> with <span>meat</span> and <span>vegetables</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was a fun and <span>rewarding</span> <span>experience</span>, and the <span>empanadas</span> <span>turned</span> out great.<br/>
🎧 These <span>taste</span> just like home, <span>Anna</span> said, taking a <span>bite</span>.<br/>
🎧 We did a good <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, we did, I agreed.<br/>
🎧 It's nice to share a <span>piece</span> of our <span>culture</span> with each other.<br/>
🎧 As we <span>sat</span> down to eat, we <span>reflected</span> on our <span>journey</span> so <span>far</span>.<br/>
🎧 We've come a long way since we first <span>arrived</span> here, I said.<br/>
🎧 Our English has <span>improved</span>, and we've made so many wonderful <span>memories</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, we have, <span>Anna</span> <span>replied</span>.<br/>
🎧 And there's still so much more to learn and <span>experience</span>.<br/>
🎧 I'm <span>excited</span> about the future.<br/>
🎧 I am too, I said, <span>smiling</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's keep working <span>hard</span> and <span>enjoying</span> every <span>moment</span> of this <span>journey</span>.<br/>
🎧 With that, we <span>raised</span> our <span>glasses</span> in a <span>toast</span>.<br/>
🎧 To new <span>experiences</span> and <span>lifelong</span> <span>learning</span>, I said.<br/>
🎧 <span>Cheers</span>, <span>Anna</span> <span>replied</span>.<br/>
🎧 As the <span>evening</span> came to an end, I <span>felt</span> a <span>deep</span> <span>sense</span> of <span>gratitude</span> for the <span>opportunities</span> I had been <span>given</span> and the friends I had made.<br/>
🎧 My <span>journey</span> in New <span>York</span> was just <span>beginning</span>, and I was <span>excited</span> to see where it would take me next.<br/>
