<h2 id="es-2-0">How to Improve Your Accent</h2>

🎧 On <span>Tuesday</span>, when I am at my work, something <span>interesting</span> <span>happens</span>.<br/>
🎧 Two <span>customers</span> come to our <span>café</span>.<br/>
🎧 They are a <span>husband</span> and a <span>wife</span>.<br/>
🎧 The man <span>starts</span> to speak to me.<br/>
🎧 I know that he <span>speaks</span> English, but I don't <span>understand</span> him.<br/>
🎧 I don't <span>understand</span> what he <span>wants</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think that he <span>wants</span> something we don't have, so I call my <span>boss</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>speaks</span> with the man and she <span>sells</span> him two <span>coffees</span> and two of our <span>regular</span> <span>sandwiches</span>.<br/>
🎧 I am <span>surprised</span>.<br/>
🎧 When they leave, I go to my <span>boss</span> and I tell her that I am sorry I didn't <span>understand</span> the man.<br/>
🎧 She says that it is OK.<br/>
🎧 She says that this can <span>happen</span> when people speak with an <span>accent</span> which is new to us.<br/>
🎧 She tells me that the <span>pair</span> was from <span>Scotland</span>.<br/>
🎧 The next day, I go to school and I tell this <span>story</span> to my <span>teacher</span>.<br/>
🎧 I tell her that I <span>felt</span> really <span>stupid</span> that I didn't <span>understand</span> our <span>customer</span>.<br/>
🎧 I wasn't sure if my English was good enough for my <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>started</span> to <span>doubt</span> myself.<br/>
🎧 My <span>boss</span> was OK with it but I still <span>needed</span> some help from my <span>teacher</span>.<br/>
🎧 I wanted to know what I could do in these <span>situations</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>teacher</span> says, I <span>understand</span>.<br/>
🎧 You are used to English which people speak in <span>London</span>, but you aren't used to the <span>Scottish</span> <span>accent</span>.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>ears</span> aren't used to <span>listening</span> to the <span>Scottish</span> <span>accent</span>.<br/>
🎧 All you have to do is to listen more to <span>Scottish</span> English.<br/>
🎧 You need to <span>train</span> your <span>ears</span> to this <span>accent</span> as well.<br/>
🎧 What <span>happened</span> to you can <span>happen</span> to <span>everybody</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you already speak English at some <span>level</span> and you go to a <span>country</span> where people speak with a different <span>accent</span>, you shouldn't be <span>surprised</span> if you don't <span>understand</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is OK and it usually takes two <span>weeks</span> to get used to this new <span>accent</span>.<br/>
🎧 Don't think that there is something wrong with you when you don't <span>understand</span> a new <span>accent</span>.<br/>
🎧 With practice, you can <span>train</span> your <span>ears</span> to any <span>accent</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then I ask, So what can I do to <span>understand</span> the <span>Scottish</span> <span>accent</span>?<br/>
🎧 I don't live in <span>Scotland</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> says, You can <span>watch</span> <span>films</span> with <span>Scottish</span> English or you can <span>watch</span> <span>situation</span> <span>comedies</span> from <span>Scotland</span> and soon you can <span>understand</span>.<br/>
🎧 I tell her, Thank you.<br/>
🎧 After school, I go to my work again.<br/>
🎧 At about <span>4</span> <span>o'clock</span>, two <span>interesting</span> <span>customers</span> come to our <span>café</span>.<br/>
🎧 This time, they are not from <span>Scotland</span>.<br/>
🎧 They are <span>foreigners</span>.<br/>
🎧 They want to buy some <span>coffee</span>.<br/>
🎧 They are two <span>ladies</span> and it is <span>clear</span> that their English is very <span>basic</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>boss</span> is <span>serving</span> them.<br/>
🎧 When she <span>hears</span> that they don't speak English very well, she does something very <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 She changes her English.<br/>
🎧 She <span>uses</span> very simple <span>sentences</span> with only <span>three</span> or <span>four</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can see that the <span>ladies</span> <span>understand</span> her.<br/>
🎧 They buy two <span>coffees</span>, two <span>sandwiches</span>, and two <span>cakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 They are happy, and my <span>boss</span> is happy too.<br/>
🎧 When the <span>ladies</span> leave, I tell my <span>boss</span> that it was very nice how she <span>changed</span> her English so that the two <span>ladies</span> would <span>understand</span> her.<br/>
🎧 My <span>boss</span> says that sometimes she has to speak in very simple English.<br/>
🎧 It doesn't <span>matter</span> if the <span>customers</span> speak English well or not.<br/>
🎧 They are our <span>customers</span> and we have to do everything <span>possible</span> to make them feel <span>comfortable</span>.<br/>
🎧 If they see that they can speak English here, they can come to our <span>café</span> every day.<br/>
🎧 I think that our <span>boss</span> is a good <span>businesswoman</span>.<br/>
🎧 She does everything <span>possible</span> to make our <span>customers</span> happy.<br/>
🎧 It is <span>true</span> that we have a lot of <span>customers</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>café</span> is <span>busy</span> every day.<br/>
🎧 when you want to understand people with a special accent, listen to audio with their accent for some time. <br /><br />

<h2 id="es-2-271">What You Can Do at Your Level</h2>

🎧 The next day at school, I tell my <span>teacher</span> about my <span>experience</span> with my <span>boss</span> and the two <span>ladies</span> who didn't speak English very well.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> says, Great, your <span>boss</span> must be a very <span>clever</span> young <span>lady</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is <span>true</span> that you can <span>communicate</span> with <span>everybody</span>.<br/>
🎧 Even people who speak English very well can have a <span>conversation</span> with those who are just at the <span>beginning</span> of their <span>journey</span>.<br/>
🎧 Today, we will speak about different <span>levels</span> of English and what you should be able to do at these <span>levels</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's start with the <span>lowest</span> <span>level</span> of <span>1000</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 At this <span>level</span>, students can speak about some <span>basic</span> things from everyday life.<br/>
🎧 The <span>speaking</span> is very <span>limited</span>, but it is already <span>possible</span> to <span>communicate</span> <span>slowly</span> for a short time with people who want to speak with you.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>sentences</span> are short.<br/>
🎧 They usually have <span>4</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 If the <span>others</span> also speak in short <span>sentences</span>, you can have a <span>basic</span> <span>conversation</span>.<br/>
🎧 When students move to a <span>higher</span> <span>level</span>, which is <span>2000</span> <span>words</span>, the <span>conversations</span> are <span>easier</span> and the <span>sentences</span> are <span>longer</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is the <span>level</span> most of you in this class are at right now.<br/>
🎧 You should be able to speak about many things from your life.<br/>
🎧 You can speak about your <span>family</span>, <span>hobbies</span>, <span>job</span>, and <span>traveling</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes you can have a <span>problem</span> when you want to go into a <span>deeper</span> <span>conversation</span> on some <span>topics</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, this <span>level</span> is usually <span>sufficient</span> enough for everyday use of English.<br/>
🎧 If you want to be able to have a <span>deeper</span> <span>conversation</span> on many <span>topics</span>, it is good to know <span>3000</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>goal</span>, as a student of English who <span>wants</span> to be able to speak English well, should be to learn <span>3000</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course, you can learn more than <span>3000</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 The more <span>words</span> you know, the <span>easier</span> it will be for you to <span>communicate</span> in English, but <span>3000</span> <span>words</span> is the <span>level</span> which is usually enough for <span>communicating</span> in English about almost everything.<br/>
🎧 I think that the two <span>ladies</span> at your <span>café</span> <span>knew</span> about <span>1000</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>boss</span> went to their <span>level</span>, and she had a <span>basic</span> <span>conversation</span> with them.<br/>
🎧 After my school, I go to my work.<br/>
🎧 The two <span>ladies</span> come to our <span>café</span> again.<br/>
🎧 They also <span>bring</span> two of their friends.<br/>
🎧 It is my <span>turn</span> to <span>serve</span> them.<br/>
🎧 I speak to them in simple short <span>sentences</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>understand</span> me.<br/>
🎧 This is great.<br/>
🎧 They tell me that they are <span>tourists</span> from <span>Japan</span>.<br/>
🎧 They tell me that they like our <span>café</span> because people <span>understand</span> them here.<br/><br />

<h2 id="es-2-490">What to Do When You Are Shy</h2>

🎧 On <span>Thursday</span>, I go to school again.<br/>
🎧 One student has a very <span>interesting</span> <span>question</span>.<br/>
🎧 She says, I am very shy when I have to speak English.<br/>
🎧 Can you help me to <span>overcome</span> my <span>shyness</span>?<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> says, It is <span>true</span> that when we use <span>foreign</span> <span>languages</span>, it is <span>natural</span> that we feel <span>uncertain</span> or shy.<br/>
🎧 We are doing something which we are not perfect at.<br/>
🎧 The <span>possibility</span> of <span>making</span> a <span>mistake</span> is great.<br/>
🎧 I was also very shy when I <span>learnt</span> <span>foreign</span> <span>languages</span>.<br/>
🎧 I remember well how I was <span>afraid</span> to make a <span>mistake</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I made a <span>mistake</span>, I <span>felt</span> <span>stupid</span> and sometimes I <span>blushed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, it is different.<br/>
🎧 I use <span>languages</span> for <span>communication</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>care</span> only about <span>communication</span>.<br/>
🎧 You know that I am <span>learning</span> <span>Spanish</span> these <span>days</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Embarrassing</span> <span>situations</span> can <span>happen</span>, but they can't <span>stop</span> me from <span>using</span> <span>Spanish</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is <span>true</span> that sometimes I still feel shy when I have to speak <span>Spanish</span>.<br/>
🎧 I also sometimes <span>blush</span>, but I don't <span>care</span> much about it.<br/>
🎧 It is a <span>natural</span> <span>human</span> feeling and it never <span>lasts</span> <span>forever</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>continue</span> <span>using</span> <span>Spanish</span> because I know that only by <span>using</span> it I can <span>improve</span>.<br/>
🎧 I also try to see things as they are.<br/>
🎧 I am a student and I am on the way to good <span>Spanish</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is not <span>possible</span> to <span>skip</span> <span>several</span> <span>levels</span> in one day.<br/>
🎧 The <span>beginner</span> can't become a perfect <span>speaker</span> in one <span>hour</span>.<br/>
🎧 I also see what I mean to people around me.<br/>
🎧 When I already speak some <span>Spanish</span>, I have <span>value</span> to people who speak <span>Spanish</span>.<br/>
🎧 You should see the same.<br/>
🎧 When you already speak some English, you can have a <span>conversation</span> with other people in English.<br/>
🎧 That's great.<br/>
🎧 Look at what you already know.<br/>
🎧 You know <span>2000</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 You have already <span>gone</span> from <span>0</span> to <span>2000</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Appreciate</span> it.<br/>
🎧 Some students have a feeling that to know English <span>means</span> to be able to speak like a <span>native</span> <span>speaker</span>, to have perfect <span>pronunciation</span>, perfect <span>grammar</span>, and just speak <span>perfectly</span> without any <span>mistakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 They think that if they are not doing that, then they don't know English.<br/>
🎧 They are <span>embarrassed</span> because they are not perfect.<br/>
🎧 These students are very <span>hard</span> on <span>themselves</span>.<br/>
🎧 And it is not <span>necessary</span>.<br/>
🎧 You are great because you already speak some English.<br/>
🎧 <span>Continue</span> working on your English and your <span>shyness</span> can <span>gradually</span> go away.<br/>
🎧 I like what our <span>teacher</span> tells us.<br/>
🎧 I am also sometimes shy.<br/>
🎧 I know that I should practice <span>speaking</span> a lot but in some <span>situations</span>, I don't want to look <span>stupid</span> and I don't speak as much as I should.<br/>
🎧 I decide to be a bit more <span>brave</span> in these <span>situations</span> and use them to practice more.<br/>
🎧 Then one student says, Sometimes I want to say something but I don't know the <span>word</span> which I want to say.<br/>
🎧 Then I <span>stop</span> and I don't know what to do.<br/>
🎧 In these <span>situations</span>, I feel very <span>stupid</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then the next time when I can speak English, I don't want to speak because I don't want to be in this <span>stupid</span> <span>situation</span> again.<br/>
🎧 Can you help me with this?<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> says, When you start to speak English, you have to <span>prepare</span> for one thing.<br/>
🎧 There will be <span>moments</span> when you don't know a <span>word</span> which you want to say.<br/>
🎧 In such a <span>situation</span>, you will need to learn how to <span>describe</span> the <span>word</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>ability</span> is very important when <span>learning</span> a new <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 Since you are not a <span>native</span> English <span>speaker</span>, you will probably never know the same amount of <span>words</span> as you know in your <span>native</span> <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can tell you that you can <span>describe</span> almost every <span>word</span>.<br/>
🎧 You only need to <span>train</span> this <span>skill</span>.<br/>
🎧 You will have to <span>train</span> how to <span>express</span> <span>ideas</span> <span>within</span> the <span>vocabulary</span> you have.<br/>
🎧 For example, you don't know how to say the <span>word</span> key.<br/>
🎧 You can <span>describe</span> it as a small thing for <span>opening</span> a <span>door</span>.<br/>
🎧 You also <span>describe</span> <span>words</span> in your <span>native</span> <span>language</span> without <span>realizing</span> it.<br/>
🎧 If you don't know the <span>word</span> for something, you just <span>describe</span> it to the other person so that he or she <span>understands</span> what it is.<br/>
🎧 You can do the same thing in English, but you need to <span>train</span> this <span>ability</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thinking <span>aloud</span> is a very good <span>technique</span> to use when you want to be able to <span>describe</span> well.<br/>
🎧 Use thinking <span>aloud</span> every day and your <span>ability</span> to <span>describe</span> things will <span>improve</span>.<br/><br />
🎧 You can learn English only when you use English <br />
🎧 It is OK to by shy but it can't stop you from using English <br /><br />

<h2 id="es-2-824">Who Is Talented</h2>

🎧 The next day is <span>Friday</span> and I go to school again.<br/>
🎧 I am happy that I go to this class not only because of our <span>teacher</span>.<br/>
🎧 I like this class because there are students from many different <span>countries</span> in our class.<br/>
🎧 Some students are from <span>Europe</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some students are from <span>South</span> <span>America</span>.<br/>
🎧 There is also one student from <span>Japan</span> and one from <span>South</span> <span>Korea</span> in my class.<br/>
🎧 This is good for me because the students don't speak my <span>native</span> <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I speak to them, I have to use only English.<br/>
🎧 It is very good for my practice.<br/>
🎧 Today, we have another new student in our class.<br/>
🎧 Her name is <span>Sofia</span>.<br/>
🎧 She is from <span>Argentina</span>.<br/>
🎧 At the <span>beginning</span> of the <span>lesson</span>, <span>Sofia</span> says that she <span>thinks</span> that she doesn't have a <span>talent</span> for <span>studying</span> <span>languages</span>, but she <span>wants</span> to work <span>hard</span> to <span>improve</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>teacher</span> <span>asks</span> her, Why do you think that you don't have a <span>talent</span>?<br/>
🎧 She <span>answers</span>, I think that I don't have a <span>talent</span> because my <span>sister</span> <span>learns</span> English very <span>fast</span> but for me it is <span>difficult</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then our <span>teacher</span> <span>asks</span> <span>everybody</span> in the class, Do you think that you have a <span>talent</span> for <span>learning</span> <span>languages</span>?<br/>
🎧 Please put your <span>hand</span> up if you <span>believe</span> that you have a <span>talent</span>.<br/>
🎧 I look around the class and <span>nobody</span> <span>puts</span> their <span>hands</span> up.<br/>
🎧 My <span>teacher</span> <span>smiles</span>, then she says, Now, I want to tell you something.<br/>
🎧 Many people think that you need to have a <span>talent</span> if you really want to learn a new <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 I agree.<br/>
🎧 Yes, you need to have a <span>talent</span> if you want to learn a new <span>language</span>, but I also <span>believe</span> that you already have a <span>talent</span> for <span>learning</span> <span>languages</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why do you have a <span>talent</span>?<br/>
🎧 You have a <span>talent</span> because you already <span>learnt</span> one <span>language</span>, which is your <span>native</span> <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 You were <span>successful</span> at <span>learning</span> your <span>native</span> <span>language</span> and you speak that <span>language</span> <span>fluently</span>.<br/>
🎧 All people who are able to learn their <span>native</span> <span>language</span> have a <span>talent</span> for <span>learning</span> <span>languages</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why do many students <span>believe</span> that they are not <span>talented</span>?<br/>
🎧 The <span>reason</span> is this.<br/>
🎧 There are people who are <span>super-talented</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it is <span>true</span>.<br/>
🎧 These <span>super-talented</span> people remember new <span>words</span> very <span>fast</span> and for a <span>longer</span> time.<br/>
🎧 Maybe you know these people.<br/>
🎧 Maybe it is <span>somebody</span> at your work or in your <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are not many of these people, but they <span>exist</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>believe</span> that this can be <span>Sofia's</span> <span>sister</span> as well.<br/>
🎧 <span>Learning</span> a new <span>language</span> is fun for these people and they can do it <span>easily</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sofia</span> says that it is <span>true</span>, that her <span>sister</span> is really better than <span>everybody</span> else.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> <span>continues</span>, It is <span>true</span> that these <span>super-talented</span> people <span>exist</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is a <span>fact</span> and we <span>cannot</span> do anything about it.<br/>
🎧 And it is not a <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>problem</span> is that we <span>compare</span> <span>ourselves</span> to these people and if we don't learn as <span>fast</span> as they do, we think that we are not <span>talented</span>.<br/>
🎧 I want to ask you for one thing.<br/>
🎧 Please do not <span>compare</span> yourself to these <span>super-talented</span> people.<br/>
🎧 Yes, they are <span>lucky</span> and they have an <span>advantage</span>, but you can be <span>lucky</span> too and you are <span>super-talented</span> at doing other things.<br/>
🎧 Maybe you are more <span>talented</span> than <span>others</span> when you learn to <span>sing</span>, <span>swim</span>, play <span>tennis</span>, <span>count</span> <span>numbers</span>, <span>cook</span>, or <span>repair</span> <span>cars</span>.<br/>
🎧 People are not all the same.<br/>
🎧 It is a <span>beauty</span> of this <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, you can <span>believe</span> that you are also <span>talented</span>, maybe not <span>super-talented</span>, but <span>talented</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you <span>believe</span> that you are <span>talented</span>, <span>learning</span> English will be <span>easier</span> for you.<br/>
🎧 These <span>words</span> from our <span>teacher</span> are very <span>helpful</span> for us.<br/>
🎧 I know that I am <span>talented</span> at playing <span>football</span> and <span>tennis</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now I know that I am also <span>talented</span> at <span>learning</span> English.<br/>
🎧 It is great.<br/>
🎧 What is also great is that there is a school <span>party</span> in the <span>evening</span>.<br/>
🎧 I really look forward to this <span>party</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know that some girls from our class are going there.<br/>
🎧 I hope that our new student <span>Sofia</span> is also going to the <span>party</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know <span>Sofia</span> for only one day, but I like her a lot.<br/>
🎧 If you can speak your native language, then you have a talent for learning English. <br /><br />

<h2 id="es-2-1134">How to Speak Fluently</h2>

🎧 On <span>Monday</span>, I go to school again.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> <span>asks</span> us how <span>Friday's</span> school <span>party</span> was.<br/>
🎧 One student says that the <span>party</span> was great.<br/>
🎧 We had a lot of <span>drinks</span> and a lot of fun.<br/>
🎧 The girls from our class <span>enjoyed</span> the <span>party</span> as well.<br/>
🎧 I <span>enjoyed</span> the <span>party</span> a lot because <span>Sofia</span> was there.<br/>
🎧 I could talk to her, and we <span>danced</span> together.<br/>
🎧 It was all very nice.<br/>
🎧 There were also two <span>boys</span> from my <span>football</span> <span>team</span> at the <span>party</span>.<br/>
🎧 These <span>boys</span> were from <span>Brazil</span>.<br/>
🎧 Their English was simple.<br/>
🎧 They could speak only in short <span>sentences</span>, but they were <span>extremely</span> funny at the <span>party</span>.<br/>
🎧 They made a lot of <span>jokes</span> about life in <span>England</span>, about other <span>players</span> from our <span>team</span>, and about girls from their class.<br/>
🎧 <span>Everybody</span> <span>laughed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Their <span>sentences</span> were very short with only <span>three</span> or <span>four</span> <span>words</span>, but they were able to speak <span>fluently</span>.<br/>
🎧 When we speak about the <span>party</span>, I tell my <span>teacher</span>, It was really <span>interesting</span> to see that <span>somebody</span> who doesn't know many <span>words</span> can already speak <span>fluently</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know some students who are at a much <span>higher</span> <span>level</span> and have a <span>hard</span> time <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>teacher</span> says, This is really <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can tell you that the two <span>boys</span> from your <span>football</span> <span>team</span> <span>showed</span> you what all students should do.<br/>
🎧 The <span>boys</span> used what they <span>knew</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>cared</span> only about what was really important.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>communication</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then one girl <span>asks</span>, So, what should we do if we want to speak English <span>fluently</span>?<br/>
🎧 Should we go to <span>parties</span> and make <span>jokes</span>?<br/>
🎧 My <span>teacher</span> says, First, let me <span>explain</span> what <span>fluent</span> <span>speaking</span> is.<br/>
🎧 Many students think that <span>fluent</span> <span>speaking</span> is <span>fast</span> <span>speaking</span> with a lot of <span>words</span> and perfect <span>grammar</span>.<br/>
🎧 But there is a better, more <span>correct</span> <span>definition</span> of <span>fluent</span> <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Fluent</span> <span>speaking</span> is <span>speaking</span> without long <span>pauses</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some people can do it at <span>1000</span> <span>words</span>, some people can do it at <span>2000</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 But there are also people who know <span>3000</span> <span>words</span> and aren't able to speak <span>fluently</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you want to speak <span>fluently</span>, you have to practice <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 There is no other way to <span>improve</span> your <span>fluency</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Speaking</span> is a <span>physical</span> <span>activity</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is like playing a <span>musical</span> <span>instrument</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you want to play a <span>violin</span>, you need to <span>train</span> the <span>connection</span> between your <span>brain</span> and the <span>muscles</span> on your <span>fingers</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you want to speak well, you need to <span>train</span> the <span>connection</span> between your <span>brain</span> and the <span>muscles</span> in your <span>mouth</span>.<br/>
🎧 If the <span>connection</span> between your <span>brain</span> and your <span>mouth</span> is not often <span>trained</span>, you can't speak <span>fluently</span> no <span>matter</span> how many <span>words</span> you know.<br/>
🎧 You can't <span>complain</span> that you can't speak <span>fluently</span> if you don't practice <span>speaking</span> often.<br/>
🎧 You can have this <span>experience</span>.<br/>
🎧 You meet a <span>foreigner</span> who <span>wants</span> to speak with you in English.<br/>
🎧 You want to say <span>ideas</span> which are in your <span>head</span>, but you aren't able to do it.<br/>
🎧 You can't find the right <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then, when you end the <span>conversation</span> and play it back in your <span>head</span>, you <span>realize</span> that you actually know the right <span>words</span>, but the <span>conversation</span> is already <span>finished</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why do you <span>experience</span> such <span>situations</span>?<br/>
🎧 Because you have little <span>training</span>.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>speaking</span> isn't <span>automatic</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is not <span>automatic</span> because you don't practice it often enough.<br/>
🎧 When you want to speak <span>fluently</span>, I <span>recommend</span> <span>speaking</span> for at <span>least</span> <span>30</span> <span>minutes</span> a day.<br/>
🎧 You can speak to a <span>real</span> person.<br/>
🎧 If you don't have a <span>real</span> person to speak to, you can do thinking <span>aloud</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is <span>necessary</span> to really think <span>aloud</span> and not only think in your <span>head</span>.<br/>
🎧 You need to practice the <span>connection</span> between your <span>brain</span> and your <span>muscles</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can do this by thinking <span>aloud</span>.<br/>
🎧 Does it make <span>sense</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, says the girl.<br/>
🎧 If you want to speak fluently, speak for 30 minutes every day.<br/><br />

<h2 id="es-2-1409">What Is the Best School</h2>

🎧 At the next <span>lesson</span>, one of the students <span>asks</span> an <span>interesting</span> <span>question</span>.<br/>
🎧 She says, Next week, I am going home.<br/>
🎧 I would like to <span>continue</span> <span>studying</span> in my <span>country</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't know how to choose a good school there.<br/>
🎧 Could you help me?<br/>
🎧 How do I know if the school is good or not?<br/>
🎧 My <span>teacher</span> says, This is a very good <span>question</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>believe</span> that when you read, listen and speak a lot, you don't have to go to a school.<br/>
🎧 You will learn English <span>naturally</span> by <span>using</span> it.<br/>
🎧 However, if you want to pay for your <span>education</span>, a good <span>teacher</span> can help you <span>speed</span> up the <span>process</span> of <span>learning</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you want to know if your school is good, before the first lesson of the course go to www.testlanguages.com. <br />
🎧 There you can find how many words you know. <br />
🎧 After <span>5</span> <span>lessons</span> at the new school, do the <span>test</span> again and you can see how many new <span>words</span> you <span>learnt</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you are happy with your <span>progress</span>, you can <span>continue</span> <span>paying</span> for your <span>lessons</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is also important that you enjoy every <span>lesson</span> and you look forward to the next one.<br/>
🎧 It is important to enjoy every <span>activity</span> which you do with English.<br/>
🎧 I also give private lessons via Skype. If you are interested, I cateach you via Skype.<br />
🎧 If you don't find a good school in your town, you can contact me and I can help you. <br />
🎧 This is great, says the student. I want to have private lessons with you via Skype. <br />
🎧 This is great <span>news</span> for me.<br/>
🎧 I didn't know that it was <span>possible</span> to have a <span>private</span> <span>lesson</span> with my <span>teacher</span>.<br/>
🎧 Soon, I am also going back to my <span>country</span> and I want to have <span>private</span> <span>lessons</span> with my <span>teacher</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you go to school, you have to see your progress and enjoy every lesson. <br /><br />

<h2 id="es-2-1545">What to Do When You Need Help</h2>

🎧 It is <span>Wednesday</span> and I go to school again.<br/>
🎧 At the <span>beginning</span> of the next <span>lesson</span>, <span>Monica</span> has a <span>question</span> for my <span>teacher</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>asks</span> her, How do you know all of this?<br/>
🎧 Where did you learn <span>information</span> about <span>studying</span> <span>languages</span>?<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> says, There are many <span>ways</span> to get <span>knowledge</span> on how to learn and <span>teach</span> <span>languages</span>.<br/>
🎧 The first one is <span>experience</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have been <span>teaching</span> for more than <span>7</span> years.<br/>
🎧 I have many years of <span>experience</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I <span>teach</span> you, I <span>observe</span> what <span>works</span> and what doesn't and then I use only things which help.<br/>
🎧 I also <span>study</span> <span>materials</span> about <span>learning</span> <span>languages</span> on the <span>Internet</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I find something <span>interesting</span>, I <span>test</span> it in one of my <span>classes</span>.<br/>
🎧 If it <span>works</span>, I use it in all other <span>classes</span>.<br/>
🎧 There is also another way I get <span>information</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is usually during <span>moments</span> when I have a <span>question</span> but I can't find an answer.<br/>
🎧 During these <span>moments</span>, I go and visit my <span>magic</span> <span>park</span> and I get the answer there.<br/>
🎧 <span>Monica</span> tells my <span>teacher</span>, This is <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 How do you get the <span>answers</span> in the <span>magic</span> <span>park</span>.<br/>
🎧 Where is the <span>magic</span> <span>park</span>?<br/>
🎧 Can we go there too?<br/>
🎧 My <span>teacher</span> says, What I am going to tell you is not <span>real</span> to <span>everybody</span>.<br/>
🎧 If it sounds <span>crazy</span>, I am sorry.<br/>
🎧 But you <span>asked</span> for it, so I am <span>giving</span> you the answer.<br/>
🎧 I <span>believe</span> that if you have a <span>question</span> and you ask the <span>universe</span> for an answer, the answer comes.<br/>
🎧 When I have a <span>question</span>, I go to the <span>magic</span> <span>park</span>.<br/>
🎧 I sit on a <span>bench</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>relax</span> my <span>body</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>slow</span> down my <span>breathing</span> and I try to free my <span>mind</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then I ask the <span>question</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is all.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes the answer comes as a new idea in my <span>head</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes <span>somebody</span> who I speak to later tells me something which helps me get the answer.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes I <span>watch</span> an <span>interesting</span> <span>video</span> on the <span>Internet</span> and I find the answer there.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes the <span>answers</span> come the next day in the morning when I <span>wake</span> up.<br/>
🎧 What is <span>interesting</span> is the <span>fact</span> that the <span>answers</span> keep <span>coming</span>.<br/>
🎧 I am so <span>grateful</span> for them.<br/>
🎧 As I said, you don't have to <span>believe</span> what I am <span>telling</span> you, but this is what I do and how it <span>works</span> for me.<br/>
🎧 The <span>park</span> is not very <span>far</span> from here.<br/>
🎧 It is a ten <span>minute</span> <span>walk</span>.<br/>
🎧 A lot of people go to the <span>park</span> to <span>relax</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is <span>beautiful</span>.<br/>
🎧 It has a very nice <span>atmosphere</span>.<br/>
🎧 I call it a <span>magic</span> <span>park</span> because it is <span>magical</span> for me.<br/>
🎧 My <span>teacher's</span> <span>words</span> are very <span>interesting</span> for me.<br/>
🎧 I didn't know that people can ask the <span>universe</span> for <span>answers</span>.<br/>
🎧 Maybe in the future, when I have some <span>interesting</span> <span>question</span>, I can go to the <span>park</span> and also ask for an answer.<br/>
🎧 When you have a problem with something, ask for help.<br /><br />

<h2 id="es-2-1755">Summary</h2>

🎧 The next day, one girl <span>asks</span> our <span>teacher</span> an <span>interesting</span> <span>question</span>.<br/>
🎧 She says, Thank you for the <span>information</span> you are <span>giving</span> us on how to learn English.<br/>
🎧 Could you give us a <span>summary</span> with some <span>rules</span> on what we can do every day to learn English well?<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> says, OK, I will try to give you a simple <span>summary</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you want to speak English well, you need to do <span>3</span> things.<br/>
🎧 You have to read, listen and speak.<br/>
🎧 You already know that.<br/>
🎧 What is important is that you do all these <span>3</span> <span>activities</span> about the same amount of time.<br/>
🎧 If you leave one out, then your <span>progress</span> will not be as <span>fast</span> as it could be.<br/>
🎧 From my <span>experience</span>, I can say that it is important to use English every day for at <span>least</span> <span>90</span> <span>minutes</span>.<br/>
🎧 You don't have to <span>study</span>, but you should use English <span>actively</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, I will <span>explain</span> every <span>activity</span> in more <span>detail</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's start with <span>reading</span>.<br/>
🎧 You should read for at <span>least</span> <span>30</span> <span>minutes</span> every day.<br/>
🎧 It is the <span>minimum</span>.<br/>
🎧 Don't read to <span>study</span> English.<br/>
🎧 Read to get some new <span>information</span>.<br/>
🎧 Read to enjoy an <span>interesting</span> <span>story</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know that I <span>repeat</span> this <span>information</span> again and again but it is really important.<br/>
🎧 Then, you should listen to English for at <span>least</span> <span>30</span> <span>minutes</span> every day.<br/>
🎧 Again, it should be something which you are interested in.<br/>
🎧 You should enjoy getting the <span>information</span>.<br/>
🎧 You should start to listen to simple <span>audio</span> books or <span>news</span> first.<br/>
🎧 Then you should go to a <span>higher</span> and <span>higher</span> <span>level</span> of books and <span>news</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you know <span>2000</span> <span>words</span>, you should start watching <span>films</span> and <span>videos</span> on the <span>Internet</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then there is <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 You already know how important it is to speak when you <span>study</span> English.<br/>
🎧 Again it is important to speak for at <span>least</span> <span>30</span> <span>minutes</span> every day.<br/>
🎧 Of course, the best way is to speak to <span>real</span> people.<br/>
🎧 It can be your <span>teacher</span>, your <span>classmates</span>, <span>colleagues</span> or friends.<br/>
🎧 Try to find <span>somebody</span> who is at your <span>level</span> of English or a little bit better and speak with this person.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, if you have <span>nobody</span> to speak to, with <span>shadowing</span> and thinking <span>aloud</span>, you can also get a lot of <span>speaking</span> practice every day.<br/>
🎧 I use these <span>techniques</span> very often when I learn <span>Spanish</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't have any <span>native</span> <span>Spanish</span> <span>speakers</span> in my life who I would meet every day.<br/>
🎧 I use these two <span>techniques</span> to <span>improve</span> my <span>Spanish</span>.<br/>
🎧 As you can see, <span>studying</span> English is simple.<br/>
🎧 All you have to do is read, listen and speak.<br/>
🎧 This is all.<br/>
🎧 Now, you know how to do it.<br/>
🎧 Thank you, says the girl.<br/>
🎧 This is what I <span>needed</span> to hear.<br/>
🎧 You are the best.<br/>
🎧 I am also very glad that the girl <span>asked</span> this <span>question</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is my last day at school and I <span>needed</span> some kind of <span>summary</span> on what I can do.<br/>
🎧 During the <span>four</span> <span>weeks</span> I have <span>spent</span> with my <span>teacher</span>, I have <span>learnt</span> a lot.<br/>
🎧 I have also <span>improved</span> my English very much.<br/>
🎧 My <span>teacher</span> <span>knows</span> that this is my last day at school.<br/>
🎧 She <span>asks</span> me if I want to say something to the other students in the class.<br/>
🎧 I say that I was very happy to be a <span>part</span> of this class, and I <span>met</span> a lot of nice people.<br/>
🎧 I give <span>everybody</span> my <span>email</span> <span>address</span> and I tell them that they can <span>contact</span> me if they want to.<br/>
🎧 Then I say <span>goodbye</span> to <span>everybody</span>.<br/>
🎧 I am a little sad but I know that I have to <span>continue</span> with my life.<br/>
🎧 I can't be at school <span>forever</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, it is up to me to <span>improve</span> my English.<br/>
🎧 I have all the <span>tools</span> I need.<br/>
🎧 Now, it is one year after my last day at school.<br/>
🎧 I used English every day.<br/>
🎧 I used the <span>techniques</span> from my <span>teacher</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, I know <span>4000</span> <span>words</span> in English.<br/>
🎧 It is great.<br/>
🎧 I also have a new <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 I start to <span>teach</span> English.<br/>
🎧 I <span>teach</span> <span>beginners</span>.<br/>
🎧 They know only <span>500</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is good for me because I know that I need a lot of practice as a <span>teacher</span> before I can <span>teach</span> at <span>higher</span> <span>levels</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have one great <span>advantage</span> in my new <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 I had a great <span>teacher</span> in <span>London</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>learnt</span> a lot from her.<br/>
🎧 Now, I am trying to give all I <span>learnt</span> from my <span>teacher</span> to my students.<br/>
🎧 I want them to be <span>successful</span> as well.<br/>
🎧 When you want to learn English, read, listen and speak. <br />
🎧 Do each activity for 30 minutes every day. <br/>
