<h2>I Go to London</h2>

🎧 It is a <span>beautiful</span> <span>summer</span> day, and I am <span>travelling</span> on a <span>train</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are two <span>ladies</span> <span>sitting</span> <span>opposite</span> me.<br/>
🎧 I don't know them, but from their <span>conversation</span>, I know they are <span>foreigners</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't <span>understand</span> much of what they are saying, but I know they speak English.<br/>
🎧 I also want to speak English, but I am a <span>beginner</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't know many <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, this is an <span>opportunity</span> for me to speak English.<br/>
🎧 I decide to try to speak to the <span>ladies</span>.<br/>
🎧 I say some <span>sentences</span> in my <span>Basic</span> English, and they <span>understand</span> what I say.<br/>
🎧 I don't know many <span>words</span>, and I speak <span>slowly</span>, but the <span>ladies</span> are kind and <span>patient</span>.<br/>
🎧 I am able to have a simple <span>conversation</span> with them.<br/>
🎧 I tell them that I want to learn English.<br/>
🎧 They are happy when they hear that, and they tell me that they are from <span>England</span>.<br/>
🎧 They are <span>travelling</span> home from a <span>conference</span>.<br/>
🎧 We speak for about <span>10</span> <span>minutes</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then it's time for me to get off the <span>train</span>.<br/>
🎧 While I am <span>thanking</span> them for <span>speaking</span> with me, they give me their <span>address</span> and phone number.<br/>
🎧 They tell me I can visit them in <span>England</span> if I want to, and then we say <span>goodbye</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is how my <span>journey</span> in <span>learning</span> English <span>begins</span>.<br/>
🎧 After this <span>meeting</span>, I decide to work on my English <span>skills</span> more.<br/>
🎧 I <span>translate</span> <span>texts</span>, and I <span>watch</span> <span>films</span> in English.<br/>
🎧 I work on my English for two hours almost every day.<br/>
🎧 In six <span>months</span>, I am able to speak quite well.<br/>
🎧 It is great, but I want to know more.<br/>
🎧 I decide to go to <span>London</span> to <span>study</span> English there.<br/>
🎧 In <span>London</span>, I choose a school which I <span>expect</span> is good.<br/>
🎧 I really look forward to my first <span>lesson</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>lesson</span> is on <span>Monday</span>.<br/>
🎧 On my first day at school, I meet my <span>teacher</span> and the other students in the class.<br/>
🎧 My <span>teacher</span> is a young <span>lady</span>.<br/>
🎧 She is very nice.<br/>
🎧 She <span>asks</span> <span>everybody</span> to <span>introduce</span> <span>themselves</span> and say where they are from.<br/>
🎧 Then the <span>lesson</span> <span>starts</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> <span>asks</span> us how we <span>studied</span> English before and what we <span>suppose</span> is the best <span>method</span> to learn English.<br/>
🎧 I tell my <span>teacher</span> that I like <span>translating</span> <span>songs</span> and other <span>texts</span>, but I don't know what the best <span>method</span> to learn English is.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> says that she will <span>teach</span> us a very <span>effective</span> <span>method</span> which is <span>based</span> on <span>using</span> the <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> tells us that we will not have to <span>study</span>, and we will not use <span>textbooks</span>.<br/>
🎧 We will <span>immerse</span> <span>ourselves</span> in the <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is great for me since I don't like <span>studying</span>, and I don't like <span>textbooks</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then we speak about what we should focus on when we learn a new <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> tells us, We need <span>languages</span> for <span>communication</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Languages</span> help us say <span>ideas</span> and <span>understand</span> <span>ideas</span>.<br/>
🎧 So when you learn a new <span>language</span>, the best way to learn is to use it for <span>exchanging</span> <span>ideas</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is what we will do in our course.<br/>
🎧 Most of the time we will speak.<br/>
🎧 You <span>spoke</span> a lot when you <span>learnt</span> your <span>native</span> <span>language</span> as a <span>child</span>, and you should speak a lot when you learn English as an <span>adult</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Unfortunately</span>, many students <span>spend</span> a lot of time on <span>memorizing</span> new <span>words</span> or <span>learning</span> <span>grammar</span> <span>rules</span>.<br/>
🎧 They don't use English for <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>study</span> about the <span>language</span>, but they don't use it very much.<br/>
🎧 Of course, you need to learn new <span>words</span> and new <span>grammar</span>, but you don't actually have to <span>study</span> them.<br/>
🎧 During this course, I will show you a very simple and <span>effective</span> way on how to learn new <span>words</span> and <span>grammar</span>.<br/>
🎧 I like what our <span>teacher</span> says.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>lesson</span> <span>continues</span>.<br/>
🎧 We speak about our <span>hobbies</span> and what we do in our free time.<br/>
🎧 We speak in <span>pairs</span> or with our <span>teacher</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is great, and we speak for the <span>entire</span> <span>lesson</span>.<br/>
🎧 I enjoy it so much.<br/>
🎧 I have never <span>spoken</span> so much English during one <span>lesson</span> in my life.<br/>
🎧 I have never <span>learnt</span> this way before.<br/>
🎧 I am happy, and I look forward to the next <span>lesson</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you want to learn English, use English for <span>communication</span>.<br/><br />

<h2>How to Learn Words</h2>

🎧 I go to school on <span>Tuesday</span> again.<br/>
🎧 One of the students <span>asks</span> a <span>question</span> that is <span>interesting</span> for me.<br/>
🎧 She <span>asks</span>, What is the best way to learn new <span>words</span>?<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> says, There are many things you can do to learn new <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 I will tell you what is <span>statistically</span> the most <span>effective</span> way for <span>learning</span> new <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is <span>reading</span>.<br/>
🎧 When people read when they learn a new <span>language</span>, they learn <span>twice</span> as <span>fast</span> as people who don't read.<br/>
🎧 It is good to read for at <span>least</span> <span>30</span> <span>minutes</span> every day.<br/>
🎧 I want to show you what you should do if you want to get the <span>maximum</span> <span>gains</span> from <span>reading</span>.<br/>
🎧 First, it is very important that the book or <span>text</span> which you read is <span>interesting</span> for you.<br/>
🎧 It is important that you enjoy <span>reading</span>.<br/>
🎧 The book can be a nice <span>story</span>, or it can have some <span>useful</span> <span>information</span> for your <span>job</span> or your hobby.<br/>
🎧 Don't read a <span>text</span> that isn't <span>interesting</span> for you.<br/>
🎧 It is also good to read a <span>text</span> in which you know most of the <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you don't know many <span>words</span>, you can get <span>frustrated</span>.<br/>
🎧 You always want to enjoy everything you do while <span>using</span> English.<br/>
🎧 It is good to choose a <span>text</span> which is <span>interesting</span> and also <span>suitable</span> for your <span>level</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you read the <span>text</span> and you see a <span>word</span> that you don't <span>understand</span>, you get a <span>dictionary</span>, and you look up the <span>word</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then you <span>continue</span> <span>reading</span>.<br/>
🎧 You don't have to <span>write</span> the <span>word</span> <span>anywhere</span>.<br/>
🎧 You don't have to make a <span>list</span> of new <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 You don't have to try to remember the <span>word</span>.<br/>
🎧 You only focus on <span>understanding</span> the <span>text</span>.<br/>
🎧 When it is <span>clear</span> to you what the <span>word</span> <span>means</span>, you <span>continue</span> <span>reading</span>.<br/>
🎧 Any time there is a new <span>word</span> for you, you do the same.<br/>
🎧 <span>Reading</span> also has another great <span>advantage</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you read, you learn new <span>words</span>, and you also learn how every <span>word</span> is <span>connected</span> to other <span>words</span> in the <span>sentence</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then you can see how to <span>link</span> the <span>words</span> <span>correctly</span>.<br/>
🎧 This way of <span>learning</span> new <span>words</span> is very <span>effective</span>.<br/>
🎧 Give it a try, and you will see how <span>fast</span> you can learn new <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then we <span>continue</span> with the <span>lesson</span>.<br/>
🎧 We speak about the <span>situation</span> in <span>England</span> and about the best <span>jobs</span> for students.<br/>
🎧 This is good for me because I want to have a <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 I want to do something after my class.<br/>
🎧 I ask other students if they know where I can find a <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 They tell me that I should go to a <span>job</span> <span>center</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>job</span> <span>center</span> <span>offers</span> a lot of <span>jobs</span> for students.<br/>
🎧 This is good for me, and I am happy that I know where I can find a <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 When my day at school is <span>finished</span>, I go to the <span>job</span> <span>center</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't know what <span>jobs</span> I can do, so I ask the <span>lady</span> at the <span>job</span> <span>center</span> what the best <span>job</span> for a student is.<br/>
🎧 The <span>lady</span> tells me that they have some good <span>jobs</span> for students.<br/>
🎧 She tells me that I can be a <span>cleaner</span> or a <span>waiter</span> in a <span>café</span>.<br/>
🎧 I tell the <span>lady</span> I have no <span>experience</span> doing these <span>jobs</span>.<br/>
🎧 She tells me that my English is good enough to work at the <span>café</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>training</span> is not <span>difficult</span>, and I can have more <span>chances</span> to speak English than being a <span>cleaner</span>.<br/>
🎧 She tells me that I can start my <span>job</span> on <span>Thursday</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is all good for me.<br/>
🎧 I'm happy that I have a <span>job</span> where I can practice English.<br/>
🎧 When you want to learn new <span>words</span> <span>effectively</span>, read for <span>30</span> <span>minutes</span> every day.<br/><br />

<h2>How to Learn Pronunciation</h2>

🎧 On <span>Wednesday</span>, I go to school again.<br/>
🎧 There is one student in the class who is <span>quieter</span> than the other students.<br/>
🎧 He is from <span>South</span> <span>Korea</span>.<br/>
🎧 When our <span>teacher</span> <span>asks</span> if we have any <span>questions</span> for her, this student from <span>Korea</span> says that he has a <span>question</span>.<br/>
🎧 He says that he has a big <span>problem</span> with <span>pronunciation</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>knows</span> that his <span>pronunciation</span> is not very good, but he doesn't know how to <span>improve</span> it.<br/>
🎧 He doesn't speak much because he doesn't want <span>others</span> to listen to his bad <span>pronunciation</span>.<br/>
🎧 He says that he <span>reads</span> and <span>watches</span> <span>films</span> in English a lot.<br/>
🎧 He <span>understands</span> very well, but he also <span>wants</span> to <span>improve</span> his <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>asks</span> if there is something he could do to <span>improve</span> his <span>pronunciation</span>.<br/>
🎧 When my <span>teacher</span> <span>hears</span> this, she says, OK, I will tell you something about <span>pronunciation</span> and how to practice it.<br/>
🎧 I will also <span>teach</span> you a great <span>technique</span> that can help all of you to be better at <span>pronunciation</span>.<br/>
🎧 First, we have to look at why students have <span>problems</span> with <span>pronunciation</span>.<br/>
🎧 When we speak, we have to move our <span>mouth</span>.<br/>
🎧 We have to use <span>muscles</span> in our <span>mouth</span>.<br/>
🎧 We all do that.<br/>
🎧 The <span>problem</span> is that when you speak English, sometimes you use your <span>muscles</span> the same way you would use them in your <span>native</span> <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then your <span>pronunciation</span> is different from the <span>pronunciation</span> of <span>native</span> <span>speakers</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>happens</span> to many students who learn English.<br/>
🎧 Almost <span>everybody</span> has a bit different <span>pronunciation</span> than they should have.<br/>
🎧 In <span>fact</span>, it is not a big <span>problem</span> because usually people <span>understand</span> what you want to say even though your <span>pronunciation</span> is not perfect.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, you can work on your <span>pronunciation</span> and make it better.<br/>
🎧 There is a great <span>technique</span> that can help you a lot.<br/>
🎧 The name of this <span>technique</span> is <span>shadowing</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>technique</span> is very simple.<br/>
🎧 When you do <span>shadowing</span>, you <span>simply</span> <span>copy</span> the sound that you hear <span>immediately</span> after <span>hearing</span> it.<br/>
🎧 When children learn their first <span>language</span>, they learn it by <span>copying</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>copy</span> after their <span>parents</span> again and again until their <span>pronunciation</span> is perfect.<br/>
🎧 You can learn English <span>pronunciation</span> in the same way.<br/>
🎧 This is what you can do.<br/>
🎧 Take some <span>video</span> or <span>audio</span> <span>recording</span> that is not very <span>fast</span> and that you <span>understand</span> very well.<br/>
🎧 You listen and you <span>copy</span> what you hear when you hear it.<br/>
🎧 That is all.<br/>
🎧 Then our <span>teacher</span> tells us, <span>Shadowing</span> is also good when you are <span>preparing</span> for a <span>presentation</span> you have to give in English, and you want to have your <span>pronunciation</span> as <span>close</span> as <span>possible</span> to the <span>pronunciation</span> of <span>native</span> <span>speakers</span>.<br/>
🎧 Before the <span>presentation</span>, you can go to some place where you are <span>alone</span>, and you can do <span>shadowing</span> for about <span>10</span> <span>minutes</span>.<br/>
🎧 You will see how much it will help you to have better <span>pronunciation</span> during the <span>presentation</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is very <span>interesting</span> for me.<br/>
🎧 I haven't heard about this <span>technique</span> before.<br/>
🎧 When the <span>lesson</span> <span>finishes</span>, I go to the school <span>reception</span>.<br/>
🎧 I ask the <span>lady</span> if there are any <span>sport</span> <span>activities</span> at school.<br/>
🎧 I would like to play some <span>sport</span> in <span>England</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>lady</span> at the <span>reception</span> says, Yes, we have a <span>table</span> <span>tennis</span> <span>team</span> and a <span>football</span> <span>team</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>football</span> <span>team</span> has <span>training</span> today at <span>5</span> <span>o'clock</span>.<br/>
🎧 I am very happy because <span>sport</span> is very important in my life.<br/>
🎧 I go to the <span>training</span> of the <span>football</span> <span>team</span>.<br/>
🎧 I meet a lot of <span>players</span> from different <span>countries</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>players</span> are from <span>Brazil</span>, <span>Japan</span>, <span>Russia</span>, <span>Spain</span>, <span>Argentina</span>, and <span>Italy</span>.<br/>
🎧 I like the <span>training</span>.<br/>
🎧 I am very happy that my time in <span>England</span> <span>starts</span> well.<br/>
🎧 I have a great <span>teacher</span>.<br/>
🎧 I also have some new friends from my <span>football</span> <span>team</span>.<br/>
🎧 Also, <span>tomorrow</span> I am <span>starting</span> my <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you want to have good <span>pronunciation</span>, <span>repeat</span> after <span>native</span> <span>speakers</span>.<br/><br />

<h2>How to Practice Speaking</h2>

🎧 On <span>Thursday</span>, I go to school again.<br/>
🎧 We have a new student in our class.<br/>
🎧 Her name is <span>Monica</span>, and she is from <span>Italy</span>.<br/>
🎧 At the <span>beginning</span> of the <span>lesson</span>, my <span>teacher</span> <span>asks</span> her how her life is.<br/>
🎧 My <span>teacher</span> <span>knows</span> <span>Monica</span> from one year ago when she <span>attended</span> her class.<br/>
🎧 That one was a class for <span>beginners</span>, and it was only for two <span>weeks</span> during <span>summer</span> <span>holiday</span>.<br/>
🎧 When <span>Monica</span> <span>speaks</span>, her English is <span>beautiful</span>.<br/>
🎧 Her <span>pronunciation</span> is very good, and she is very <span>fluent</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>teacher</span> is very happy and she <span>asks</span> <span>Monica</span>, Where did you learn English so well?<br/>
🎧 You speak very <span>fluently</span>.<br/>
🎧 What school did you go to?<br/>
🎧 <span>Monica</span> <span>replies</span>, I didn't go to school.<br/>
🎧 I <span>learnt</span> English at home.<br/>
🎧 I used the advice and <span>techniques</span> that you <span>taught</span> us last <span>summer</span>.<br/>
🎧 I did a lot of <span>reading</span>, <span>shadowing</span> and thinking <span>aloud</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>tried</span> to think more in English than in <span>Italian</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is how I <span>improved</span> my English.<br/>
🎧 The two <span>weeks</span> I <span>spent</span> last <span>summer</span> at your class <span>helped</span> me a lot.<br/>
🎧 You <span>showed</span> me the way.<br/>
🎧 I <span>knew</span> exactly how to work on my English every day.<br/>
🎧 That's why I wanted to go to your class again because one year ago, I was a <span>beginner</span> and now I can speak English.<br/>
🎧 I want to learn from you again.<br/>
🎧 My <span>teacher</span> is very happy when she <span>hears</span> these <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 She thanks <span>Monica</span> for <span>sharing</span> her <span>experience</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is all very <span>interesting</span> for me.<br/>
🎧 I already know about the <span>importance</span> of <span>reading</span>.<br/>
🎧 I also know the <span>shadowing</span> <span>technique</span>.<br/>
🎧 But <span>Monica</span> also <span>mentions</span> thinking <span>aloud</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't know what it is.<br/>
🎧 So I ask our <span>teacher</span>, What is thinking <span>aloud</span>?<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> says, It is a very simple and <span>powerful</span> <span>technique</span>.<br/>
🎧 But you have to have a <span>strong</span> <span>motivation</span> to learn English if you want to <span>benefit</span> from this <span>technique</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is also good to know that for some people this <span>technique</span> is a little bit <span>crazy</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, when you start to think <span>aloud</span>, your English can <span>improve</span> very <span>fast</span>.<br/>
🎧 I say, I have a <span>strong</span> <span>motivation</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't <span>care</span> if the <span>technique</span> is <span>crazy</span>.<br/>
🎧 If it helps, I want to learn it.<br/>
🎧 Can you <span>teach</span> us this <span>technique</span>?<br/>
🎧 OK, it is actually very simple.<br/>
🎧 You usually think in your <span>native</span> <span>language</span> all day every day.<br/>
🎧 It is <span>normal</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, you can start to think in English <span>instead</span> of your <span>native</span> <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 And when you start thinking in English, then you can think <span>aloud</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>means</span> that you actually say <span>aloud</span> what you think.<br/>
🎧 It is all.<br/>
🎧 I say, It looks very simple.<br/>
🎧 You said that it is a <span>powerful</span> <span>technique</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why is it <span>powerful</span>?<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> says, Maybe you can ask <span>Monica</span>.<br/>
🎧 She has used this <span>technique</span> for a year.<br/>
🎧 Maybe she can tell us what she has <span>found</span> out about this <span>technique</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then our <span>teacher</span> <span>asks</span> <span>Monica</span> if she is <span>willing</span> to speak about her <span>experience</span> with thinking <span>aloud</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is no <span>problem</span> for <span>Monica</span>.<br/>
🎧 She says, When I <span>started</span> with this <span>technique</span>, it wasn't easy.<br/>
🎧 I <span>started</span> with very simple <span>sentences</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, <span>‘I</span> can speak English.<br/>
🎧 It is good that I can speak English.<br/>
🎧 I want to be better.<br/>
🎧 I need to practice every day.<br/>
🎧 I don't know many <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 But I can use these <span>words</span> well.<br/>
🎧 I can <span>express</span> my <span>ideas</span> with these <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can do this.<br/>
🎧 This is great.<br/>
🎧 The <span>sentences</span> were really simple.<br/>
🎧 I <span>realized</span> that <span>sentences</span> that I thought in <span>Italian</span> were long and <span>complicated</span>.<br/>
🎧 I wasn't able to say in English exactly what I was saying in <span>Italian</span>.<br/>
🎧 I had to find a <span>simpler</span> <span>form</span>.<br/>
🎧 To think in simple English was the <span>hardest</span> <span>part</span>.<br/>
🎧 But after some time I got used to it.<br/>
🎧 Then it was <span>normal</span> for me to think in English.<br/>
🎧 Then something <span>interesting</span> <span>happened</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>met</span> a man from <span>Australia</span>.<br/>
🎧 He was on <span>holiday</span> in <span>Italy</span>.<br/>
🎧 I was still a <span>beginner</span> but we <span>started</span> to speak English.<br/>
🎧 I could see that I was able to speak with him without big <span>problems</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>sentences</span> were still simple and short, but because I said them many <span>times</span> before when I was thinking <span>aloud</span>, I was able to speak.<br/>
🎧 I didn't have to <span>translate</span> in my <span>head</span> from <span>Italian</span> to English as I did before <span>using</span> this <span>technique</span>.<br/>
🎧 After the <span>meeting</span> with the man from <span>Australia</span>, I <span>started</span> to use thinking <span>aloud</span> even more.<br/>
🎧 This <span>technique</span> <span>helped</span> me a lot.<br/>
🎧 It <span>improved</span> my <span>ability</span> to <span>express</span> my <span>ideas</span> very much.<br/>
🎧 I still use it every day.<br/>
🎧 It is really a <span>powerful</span> <span>technique</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> thanks <span>Monica</span> for <span>sharing</span> her <span>experience</span> with thinking <span>aloud</span>.<br/>
🎧 I decide to use this <span>technique</span> because I also want to be better at <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you want to speak English <span>fluently</span>, think <span>aloud</span>.<br/><br />

<h2>How to Learn Grammar</h2>

🎧 After school, I go to the <span>café</span> where my <span>job</span> <span>training</span> <span>starts</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't know what to <span>expect</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have never <span>worked</span> at a <span>café</span>.<br/>
🎧 I am not sure if I can do this <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I come to the <span>café</span>, I am very <span>surprised</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is a <span>modern</span> <span>café</span> which <span>sells</span> <span>coffee</span>, tea and also <span>chocolate</span> <span>cakes</span> and <span>sandwiches</span>.<br/>
🎧 And my <span>boss</span> is only <span>25</span> years old, but she has been working at the <span>café</span> for more than <span>2</span> years.<br/>
🎧 She has a lot of <span>experience</span> and she <span>knows</span> everything <span>perfectly</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>shows</span> me how to <span>prepare</span> <span>coffee</span>, how to <span>wash</span> the <span>dishes</span> and how to <span>deal</span> with <span>customers</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is all new for me.<br/>
🎧 I remember only about <span>20%</span> of what she is <span>telling</span> me.<br/>
🎧 But then she <span>lets</span> me do the work and she <span>corrects</span> me when I make a <span>mistake</span>.<br/>
🎧 She is very <span>friendly</span> and I learn <span>fast</span>.<br/>
🎧 After the first day at work, I am very <span>tired</span>.<br/>
🎧 I had to learn many new things, but I am happy that I have a <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 The next day is <span>Friday</span> and I go to school again.<br/>
🎧 One student <span>asks</span> an <span>interesting</span> <span>question</span>, Sometimes when I speak I am not sure if I speak <span>correctly</span>.<br/>
🎧 I am not sure if I use <span>correct</span> <span>grammar</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can you help me what to do if I want to learn <span>grammar</span>?<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> says, Thank you for your <span>question</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are two <span>groups</span> of students.<br/>
🎧 Some students <span>study</span> English because they want to be able to speak.<br/>
🎧 Some students <span>study</span> English because they want to <span>pass</span> an <span>exam</span>.<br/>
🎧 For each group there is a different <span>approach</span>.<br/>
🎧 First, I will speak about those who need English for <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 If this is your case, you don't have to <span>study</span> <span>grammar</span> a lot.<br/>
🎧 When you <span>learnt</span> your <span>native</span> <span>language</span>, you also <span>learnt</span> it without <span>studying</span> <span>grammar</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can learn English <span>grammar</span> <span>naturally</span> by <span>using</span> the <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 The best way to learn <span>grammar</span> <span>naturally</span> is by <span>reading</span> a lot.<br/>
🎧 Books are <span>written</span> in good <span>grammar</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you read, you will learn <span>grammar</span> in the <span>context</span> of the whole <span>sentence</span>.<br/>
🎧 I also <span>recommend</span> <span>shadowing</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you do <span>shadowing</span>, you practice the <span>correct</span> <span>grammar</span>.<br/>
🎧 You do it <span>naturally</span>.<br/>
🎧 You don't have to try to remember anything.<br/>
🎧 You only <span>copy</span> <span>sentences</span> with <span>correct</span> <span>grammar</span>.<br/>
🎧 The second group of students are those who <span>study</span> English for <span>passing</span> an <span>exam</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you are one of these students, I <span>recommend</span> <span>studying</span> <span>specifically</span> for this <span>exam</span>.<br/>
🎧 It might be <span>helpful</span> to get the <span>versions</span> of this <span>exam</span> from the <span>past</span> years if they are <span>available</span> and <span>train</span> with them.<br/>
🎧 Of course, your <span>exam</span> will be a little different, but the <span>structure</span> is usually the same or very <span>similar</span>.<br/>
🎧 From my <span>point</span> of <span>view</span>, the <span>versions</span> of the <span>exam</span> from the <span>past</span> years are good <span>training</span> <span>materials</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then I <span>recommend</span> going to the <span>exam</span> only when your <span>results</span> in the <span>training</span> <span>materials</span> are such that you could <span>pass</span> the <span>exam</span> <span>successfully</span>.<br/>
🎧 Did I answer your <span>question</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, thank you, says the student.<br/>
🎧 This is good <span>news</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't like <span>studying</span> <span>grammar</span>.<br/>
🎧 I learn English because I want to be able to speak.<br/>
🎧 I don't need to <span>pass</span> any <span>exam</span>.<br/>
🎧 I am happy that I don't have to <span>study</span> <span>grammar</span> much.<br/>
🎧 In the <span>afternoon</span>, I go to my work.<br/>
🎧 It is my second day and I can already do a lot of things by myself, but my <span>boss</span> helps me <span>whenever</span> I need it.<br/>
🎧 I see that my work is not very <span>difficult</span>.<br/>
🎧 Also, I can practice English when I speak to our <span>customers</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you want to have good <span>grammar</span>, read a lot.<br/><br />

<h2>How to Test Your English</h2>

🎧 It is <span>Monday</span> again, and I go to my school.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> <span>asks</span> us what we did during the weekend.<br/>
🎧 I say that I was at work on <span>Saturday</span>.<br/>
🎧 I say that I can already do my work quite well.<br/>
🎧 I say that I am happy when I can speak to our <span>customers</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I speak, one of the girls in the class <span>asks</span> me, What <span>happened</span> to your <span>voice</span>?<br/>
🎧 You sound very different from what we heard last week.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>pronunciation</span> is very good.<br/>
🎧 I <span>smile</span> and I say, Thank you, I <span>tried</span> to do <span>shadowing</span> on <span>Saturday</span> <span>evening</span> after my work and for all of <span>Sunday</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>tried</span> to speak like a <span>native</span> <span>speaker</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know that it is still not perfect, but I also <span>noticed</span> a big change in my <span>pronunciation</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> <span>asks</span> if <span>anybody</span> else <span>tried</span> to practice <span>shadowing</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Three</span> students <span>raise</span> their <span>hands</span>.<br/>
🎧 One of them is the student from <span>South</span> <span>Korea</span>.<br/>
🎧 He also likes this <span>technique</span>.<br/>
🎧 One student says that she <span>tried</span> the <span>technique</span> but her <span>mouth</span> <span>hurt</span> a lot after <span>5</span> <span>minutes</span> of <span>shadowing</span> and she had to <span>stop</span>.<br/>
🎧 She also says that she wasn't always able to <span>repeat</span> everything.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes it was <span>hard</span> for her to keep up with the <span>speed</span> of the <span>recording</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> says, Thank you for trying out this <span>technique</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you do <span>shadowing</span> for the first time and your <span>mouth</span> <span>hurts</span> after <span>5</span> <span>minutes</span>, it <span>means</span> that you are doing it <span>correctly</span>.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>muscles</span> need to be <span>trained</span> to this new way of <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is like going to the gym for the first time.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>muscles</span> can <span>hurt</span> if they are not <span>trained</span>.<br/>
🎧 If your <span>mouth's</span> <span>muscles</span> <span>hurt</span>, you can take a <span>break</span> after <span>5</span> <span>minutes</span> and <span>continue</span> a bit later.<br/>
🎧 With every <span>5</span> <span>minutes</span> of practice, your <span>pronunciation</span> should be a little bit better.<br/>
🎧 <span>Shadowing</span> has also other <span>advantages</span>.<br/>
🎧 You practice the <span>correct</span> <span>pronunciation</span> in English, and you also practice other things such as <span>intonation</span>, <span>rhythm</span> and <span>connecting</span> <span>words</span> in whole <span>sentences</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know that at the <span>beginning</span>, the <span>recording</span> can sometimes be too <span>fast</span>.<br/>
🎧 If this <span>happens</span>, you can <span>repeat</span> only the first or the last <span>word</span> in the <span>sentence</span>.<br/>
🎧 With practice you will be able to <span>repeat</span> more.<br/>
🎧 I agree that it is <span>true</span>.<br/>
🎧 On <span>Saturday</span> when I <span>started</span> with <span>shadowing</span>, it was quite <span>difficult</span> for me.<br/>
🎧 Yet by <span>Sunday</span> <span>evening</span>, it was quite easy to <span>repeat</span> what I heard.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> <span>asks</span> other students if they know how many <span>words</span> they know in English.<br/>
🎧 It is <span>interesting</span> to see that <span>nobody</span> <span>knows</span>.<br/>
🎧 We know that we are <span>intermediate</span> students but we don't know how many <span>words</span> we know.<br/>
🎧 I want to know how many <span>words</span> I know.<br/>
🎧 I do the <span>test</span> <span>immediately</span>.<br/>
🎧 I see that I know <span>2100</span> <span>words</span> in English.<br/>
🎧 Most of the students know between <span>2000</span> and <span>2200</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 Only <span>Monica</span> and the boy from <span>South</span> <span>Korea</span> know <span>2500</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
 <span><br />

<h2>How to Handle Mistakes</h2>

🎧 On <span>Tuesday</span>, I go to school again.<br/>
🎧 One student <span>asks</span> our <span>teacher</span> an <span>interesting</span> <span>question</span>.<br/>
🎧 She says, I would like to practice <span>speaking</span> with people around me but I am <span>afraid</span> of <span>making</span> <span>mistakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't want to look <span>stupid</span>.<br/>
🎧 Can you help me?<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> says, <span>Making</span> <span>mistakes</span> is a very <span>interesting</span> <span>topic</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are a lot of <span>opinions</span> on it.<br/>
🎧 I want to show you what I <span>believe</span> is the best <span>approach</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have a lot of <span>experience</span> with this because I also <span>learnt</span> new <span>languages</span>.<br/>
🎧 I still <span>continue</span> doing it.<br/>
🎧 For example, now I am <span>learning</span> <span>Spanish</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I speak <span>Spanish</span>, I don't <span>care</span> if I make <span>mistakes</span> or not.<br/>
🎧 The <span>reason</span> why I don't <span>care</span> about <span>mistakes</span> is simple.<br/>
🎧 When I <span>learnt</span> my <span>native</span> <span>language</span>, I didn't <span>care</span> about <span>making</span> <span>mistakes</span>, either.<br/>
🎧 So why should I <span>care</span> now?<br/>
🎧 My <span>main</span> <span>goal</span> when I use any <span>language</span> is to <span>express</span> my <span>ideas</span>.<br/>
🎧 That is all.<br/>
🎧 I know that when I read a lot, speak and do <span>shadowing</span>, my <span>Spanish</span> will be better and better.<br/>
🎧 I know that this can sound <span>incredibly</span> simple but it is my <span>opinion</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is what I have <span>found</span> after many years of both <span>teaching</span> and <span>learning</span> <span>languages</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>works</span> very well for me and many of my students.<br/>
🎧 When I speak, I only <span>concentrate</span> on <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 At the <span>moment</span> I know <span>1500</span> <span>words</span> in <span>Spanish</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is the <span>level</span> of a <span>two-year-old</span> <span>child</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Two-year-old</span> children make a lot of <span>mistakes</span> when they speak, but they don't <span>care</span> about their <span>mistakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>continue</span> <span>using</span> their <span>native</span> <span>language</span> and when they are <span>three</span> years old, they make very few <span>mistakes</span> and when they are <span>four</span> years old, they already speak very well with <span>hardly</span> <span>making</span> any <span>mistakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 You should have the same <span>attitude</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now most of you know about <span>2000</span> <span>words</span>, so it is absolutely OK to make <span>mistakes</span> time to time.<br/>
🎧 When you <span>continue</span> <span>using</span> English, there will be <span>fewer</span> and <span>fewer</span> <span>mistakes</span> in your <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is not <span>possible</span> to get better without <span>making</span> <span>mistakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you practice English, it is OK not to be perfect.<br/>
🎧 <span>Perfection</span> comes with practice.<br/>
🎧 <span>Anybody</span> who <span>started</span> to learn English, <span>started</span> from the <span>beginning</span>, from the same <span>level</span>, which is <span>level</span> <span>zero</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Learning</span> <span>languages</span> is like <span>learning</span> to play a <span>musical</span> <span>instrument</span>.<br/>
🎧 It needs to be <span>trained</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you start your <span>training</span>, it is not perfect at first and you make <span>mistakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is <span>normal</span>.<br/>
🎧 Take it as a <span>necessary</span> <span>part</span> of your <span>learning</span> <span>process</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you didn't go through this <span>period</span> of <span>making</span> <span>mistakes</span>, you could not get to <span>higher</span> <span>levels</span>.<br/>
🎧 By <span>continuing</span> to do what you want to learn, the <span>mistakes</span> are <span>gradually</span> being <span>eliminated</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you want to make <span>fewer</span> and <span>fewer</span> <span>mistakes</span>, do a lot of <span>reading</span> and <span>shadowing</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you read, you can read <span>aloud</span>.<br/>
🎧 It can also help you make <span>fewer</span> <span>mistakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 In <span>real</span> <span>conversations</span>, <span>care</span> only about <span>exchanging</span> <span>ideas</span>.<br/>
🎧 Don't <span>care</span> about <span>making</span> <span>mistakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you speak, you practice <span>changing</span> your <span>thoughts</span> into <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 You don't learn <span>grammar</span> or <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 You have other <span>activities</span> for that.<br/>
🎧 Don't <span>worry</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Everybody</span> who <span>learns</span> a <span>foreign</span> <span>language</span> makes <span>mistakes</span> from time to time, even famous people, <span>bosses</span> of big <span>companies</span> or <span>politicians</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you listen to these people on <span>TV</span>, you see that they don't <span>care</span> about <span>mistakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>care</span> about what is important and that is <span>expressing</span> their <span>ideas</span>.<br/>
🎧 You should do the same.<br/>
🎧 Does it make <span>sense</span>?<br/>
🎧 The girl says, Yes, thank you.<br/>
🎧 If you don't want to make <span>mistakes</span>, do a lot of <span>reading</span> and <span>shadowing</span>.<br/>
 <span><br />

<h2>How to Remember Words</h2>

🎧 On <span>Wednesday</span>, I go to school again.<br/>
🎧 At the <span>beginning</span> of the <span>lesson</span>, one student says, I <span>started</span> to read more.<br/>
🎧 I feel that it is good for me.<br/>
🎧 I can see how my <span>grammar</span> is better, but I have a <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I read, I look up a new <span>word</span> in a <span>dictionary</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then I <span>continue</span> <span>reading</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes when I see the same <span>word</span> again only <span>10</span> <span>minutes</span> later, I don't remember the <span>word</span> and I have to look it up again.<br/>
🎧 Can you help me to remember the <span>words</span> better?<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> says that it is an <span>interesting</span> <span>question</span> and she <span>gives</span> this <span>explanation</span>, It is absolutely <span>normal</span> that you don't remember the new <span>word</span> <span>immediately</span>.<br/>
🎧 Usually, you will have to look up the <span>word</span> <span>5</span> <span>times</span> before you remember it.<br/>
🎧 There will be also <span>words</span> that you will have to look up <span>10</span> or <span>15</span> <span>times</span>.<br/>
🎧 These <span>words</span> are usually <span>verbs</span>.<br/>
🎧 When we learn a new <span>word</span>, the <span>word</span> <span>goes</span> through <span>phases</span>.<br/>
🎧 Only when you <span>achieve</span> the last <span>phase</span>, you remember the <span>word</span> very well.<br/>
🎧 There are <span>five</span> of these <span>phases</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's have a look at them.<br/>
🎧 The first <span>phase</span> is the <span>moment</span> when you see the <span>word</span> for the first time and you don't know the <span>word</span>.<br/>
🎧 You look it up in the <span>dictionary</span>.<br/>
🎧 The second <span>phase</span> is the <span>moment</span> when you see the <span>word</span> that you have already <span>looked</span> up in the <span>dictionary</span> or heard or saw it in the <span>past</span>.<br/>
🎧 You know that you saw this <span>word</span> before, but you still don't remember its <span>meaning</span>.<br/>
🎧 You look up the <span>word</span> again.<br/>
🎧 The <span>third</span> <span>phase</span> is the <span>moment</span> when you see the <span>word</span> again and you feel what it could mean but you are not sure.<br/>
🎧 For example, you know that the <span>word</span> is some kind of <span>object</span> or some <span>animal</span> or a <span>verb</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>fourth</span> <span>phase</span> is the <span>moment</span> when you already know what the <span>word</span> <span>means</span> when you see it, but you are not able to <span>recall</span> the <span>word</span> when you want to say it.<br/>
🎧 When this <span>phase</span> <span>happens</span>, the <span>word</span> is in your <span>passive</span> <span>vocabulary</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>fifth</span> <span>phase</span> is the <span>moment</span> when you are able to use the <span>word</span> when you speak.<br/>
🎧 Now you can see there are <span>five</span> <span>phases</span> all together.<br/>
🎧 Do you <span>understand</span> now why it is not <span>possible</span> to remember a new <span>word</span> when you see it for the first time?<br/>
🎧 You would have to <span>jump</span> across all the <span>phases</span> with the first <span>encounter</span> with the <span>word</span>.<br/>
🎧 You have to see or hear every <span>word</span> <span>several</span> <span>times</span> and let it go through all the <span>phases</span> until you get to <span>phase</span> number <span>five</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can be happy not only when you learn a new <span>word</span> <span>perfectly</span> but also when you get from one <span>phase</span> to the other.<br/>
🎧 When it <span>happens</span>, you are <span>closer</span> to the <span>final</span> <span>goal</span> and it is to use the <span>word</span> without <span>problems</span> in everyday <span>communication</span>.<br/>
🎧 All of this is <span>interesting</span> to me.<br/>
🎧 I didn't know about these <span>phases</span>, but it is all <span>logical</span>.<br/>
🎧 It also <span>happened</span> to me that I <span>looked</span> up a new <span>word</span> in the <span>dictionary</span> but two <span>minutes</span> later I didn't know what the <span>word</span> was and I had to look it up again.<br/>
🎧 I <span>felt</span> <span>stupid</span> that I didn't remember the <span>word</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, I know that it is absolutely OK not to remember the <span>word</span> <span>forever</span> when I see it for the first time.<br/>
🎧 I need <span>several</span> <span>encounters</span> with the <span>word</span> before I can use the <span>word</span> well.<br/>
🎧 After school, I go to my <span>football</span> <span>training</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>coach</span> tells us that there will be a <span>match</span> on <span>Saturday</span>.<br/>
🎧 The school <span>team</span> will play <span>against</span> another school <span>team</span> from <span>Cambridge</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>coach</span> tells me to come and play for the school <span>team</span>.<br/>
🎧 I am very happy and I am looking forward to the <span>Saturday</span> <span>match</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you want to remember a new <span>word</span>, you need to see or hear the <span>word</span> about ten <span>times</span>.<br/>
 <span><br />

<h2>How to Improve Listening</h2>

🎧 The next day, I go to school again.<br/>
🎧 One of the students has an important <span>question</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>wants</span> to know how to <span>improve</span> his <span>listening</span> <span>skills</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>wants</span> to know what the best <span>approach</span> is.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> says, Thank you for your <span>question</span>.<br/>
🎧 Good <span>listening</span> <span>skills</span> are very important for <span>communication</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you don't <span>understand</span> what people are saying, it will be <span>difficult</span> for you to speak with them.<br/>
🎧 There are a lot of <span>materials</span> on the <span>Internet</span> for students of English.<br/>
🎧 Some students can have a <span>problem</span> with <span>finding</span> the right <span>listening</span> <span>materials</span> for them.<br/>
🎧 Let's have a look at what you should listen to.<br/>
🎧 There are two <span>types</span> of <span>materials</span> which you can listen to.<br/>
🎧 You can listen to some <span>audio</span> or you can <span>watch</span> a <span>film</span>.<br/>
🎧 These are quite different <span>materials</span> and different <span>rules</span> <span>apply</span> to them.<br/>
🎧 When you listen to some <span>audio</span>, you should know <span>95%</span> of the <span>words</span> or more.<br/>
🎧 If the <span>audio</span> has a lot of new <span>words</span>, read the <span>text</span> first if <span>possible</span> and make sure you know all the <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you practice <span>listening</span>, you practice getting <span>information</span> from a <span>spoken</span> <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 You don't try to learn new <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course, sometimes you can learn new <span>words</span>, but it is not the <span>main</span> <span>goal</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you listen, <span>concentrate</span> on getting <span>information</span> from <span>spoken</span> English.<br/>
🎧 It is important to use <span>materials</span> at your <span>level</span> of English.<br/>
🎧 For example, you can use books in <span>simplified</span> English which <span>contain</span> an <span>audio</span> <span>recording</span>.<br/>
🎧 I really <span>recommend</span> these books to you.<br/>
🎧 They are <span>fantastic</span> because you can choose a book at your <span>level</span> of English.<br/>
🎧 The second <span>type</span> of <span>materials</span> for <span>listening</span> practice are <span>films</span> and <span>videos</span> on <span>YouTube</span>.<br/>
🎧 These are also great.<br/>
🎧 You can start <span>using</span> them when you know <span>2000</span> <span>words</span> in English or more.<br/>
🎧 This is what you should do with a <span>film</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Watch</span> it for the first time with <span>subtitles</span> so that you know what the <span>film</span> is about.<br/>
🎧 Then <span>watch</span> the <span>film</span> without <span>subtitles</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you like the <span>film</span> very much, you can <span>watch</span> it more than once.<br/>
🎧 When you <span>watch</span> one <span>film</span> many <span>times</span>, with every <span>view</span>, you will <span>understand</span> more.<br/>
🎧 It is also good to <span>watch</span> <span>videos</span> on the <span>Internet</span> about <span>interesting</span> <span>subjects</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, if you like <span>nature</span>, you can <span>watch</span> <span>documentaries</span> about <span>nature</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can also <span>watch</span> <span>reality</span> <span>shows</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Reality</span> <span>shows</span> are much <span>easier</span> to <span>understand</span> than <span>films</span> or <span>documentaries</span> because the <span>structure</span> of the show is usually the same.<br/>
🎧 It is <span>necessary</span> to have at <span>least</span> <span>30</span> <span>minutes</span> a day of <span>listening</span>.<br/>
🎧 The more you listen, the <span>faster</span> you will <span>understand</span> more <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 When <span>listening</span>, you should always look at what you already <span>understand</span>, even if it is just <span>10%</span> at the <span>beginning</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is very easy to <span>demotivate</span> yourself by <span>realizing</span> all of the <span>parts</span> that you don't <span>understand</span> yet.<br/>
🎧 Look at what you already know.<br/>
🎧 Be happy for every new <span>sentence</span> you have <span>understood</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Listening</span> is the <span>easiest</span> way to learn.<br/>
🎧 You don't have to do anything.<br/>
🎧 You just listen.<br/>
🎧 Did this <span>information</span> help you?<br/>
🎧 Yes, says the student, Thank you.<br/>
🎧 The <span>listening</span> <span>topic</span> is very <span>interesting</span> for me.<br/>
🎧 Now, I know what to do to <span>improve</span> my <span>listening</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you want to be good at <span>listening</span>, listen for <span>30</span> <span>minutes</span> every day.<br/><br />

<h2>What You Need Before You Start</h2>

🎧 On <span>Friday</span>, we have an <span>interesting</span> <span>conversation</span> in our class.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> has a <span>question</span> for us.<br/>
🎧 She <span>asks</span>, What was your first <span>reason</span> to learn English?<br/>
🎧 Do you remember the <span>moment</span> when you <span>started</span> to learn English?<br/>
🎧 When did you start to be really interested in the <span>language</span>?<br/>
🎧 I say that I remember the <span>moment</span> when I <span>started</span> to be interested in English.<br/>
🎧 My <span>teacher</span> says, Can you tell us what <span>happened</span>?<br/>
🎧 I say, Yes.<br/>
🎧 First I have to say that English wasn't always my <span>favourite</span> <span>subject</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>started</span> to learn English at high school.<br/>
🎧 At the <span>beginning</span>, it was very <span>difficult</span> for me.<br/>
🎧 I didn't <span>understand</span> the <span>structure</span> of the <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>illogical</span> to me.<br/>
🎧 I <span>tried</span> to remember <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>tried</span> to learn <span>grammar</span> but it was very <span>hard</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I <span>finished</span> high school, I was still only a <span>beginner</span>.<br/>
🎧 I couldn't speak English and I <span>believed</span> that I would never learn this <span>language</span> <span>properly</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>simply</span> <span>believed</span> that English wasn't for me.<br/>
🎧 Then something <span>happened</span>.<br/>
🎧 I always <span>liked</span> music and when I was <span>twenty</span>, I <span>started</span> to listen to the <span>Beatles</span>.<br/>
🎧 I wanted to <span>understand</span> what they were <span>singing</span>, so I <span>started</span> to <span>translate</span> their <span>songs</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Slowly</span> I <span>understood</span> more and more.<br/>
🎧 Then I <span>met</span> two <span>ladies</span> from <span>England</span> on a <span>train</span>.<br/>
🎧 We had a simple <span>conversation</span> but it <span>helped</span> me very much.<br/>
🎧 I <span>started</span> to <span>believe</span> that I could learn English.<br/>
🎧 From that <span>moment</span> on, I was working on my English almost every day and I was getting better and better.<br/>
🎧 Then I <span>decided</span> to go to <span>England</span> and <span>improve</span> English here.<br/>
🎧 My <span>teacher</span> thanks me for <span>sharing</span> my <span>story</span>.<br/>
🎧 She also tells me, Here is something very <span>interesting</span> about your <span>story</span>.<br/>
🎧 You are still you.<br/>
🎧 The first you didn't have <span>motivation</span> to learn English.<br/>
🎧 The second you had a <span>motivation</span>.<br/>
🎧 You wanted to <span>understand</span> <span>songs</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can see that <span>motivation</span> is very important.<br/>
🎧 When you have it, you can <span>succeed</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you don't have it, it is very <span>hard</span> to be <span>successful</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then our <span>teacher</span> <span>asks</span> <span>everybody</span> in the class about their <span>motivation</span> to learn English.<br/>
🎧 The <span>stories</span> are very <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 One <span>girl's</span> <span>motivation</span> is to be able to read <span>historical</span> books in <span>original</span> English.<br/>
🎧 One student <span>wants</span> to be a <span>professional</span> <span>tennis</span> <span>coach</span> in <span>England</span>.<br/>
🎧 He <span>wants</span> to speak perfect English before he <span>starts</span> his <span>career</span> as a <span>coach</span>.<br/>
🎧 One <span>woman</span> <span>wants</span> to work for a big <span>international</span> company and she needs English for her <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can see that <span>everybody</span> has some kind of <span>motivation</span> to use English in <span>real</span> life or to get <span>information</span> from books.<br/>
🎧 At the end of the <span>lesson</span> our <span>teacher</span> <span>asks</span> us if we like English.<br/>
🎧 I say, I didn't like English at my high school but now I like it a lot.<br/>
🎧 I can see how <span>useful</span> it is to know this <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> says, This is another important <span>factor</span> when you learn a new <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is good when you like something which is <span>connected</span> to English.<br/>
🎧 It can be people, music, <span>culture</span>, or <span>history</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you like English, it is <span>easier</span> for you to learn it.<br/>
🎧 If you want to be able <span>communicate</span> in English, it is good to know <span>3000</span> <span>words</span> or more.<br/>
🎧 If you don't like English, it is more <span>difficult</span> to find time to practice enough to get to the <span>level</span> of <span>3000</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can agree with my <span>teacher</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, I like not only the <span>Beatles</span> but also my <span>teacher</span> and my <span>boss</span> who is also English.<br/>
🎧 I also like English <span>humour</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now it is much <span>easier</span> for me to find time to practice English every day.<br/>
🎧 On <span>Saturday</span>, I go to play <span>football</span> for my school <span>team</span>.<br/>
🎧 We have some very good <span>players</span> on our <span>team</span> and we win <span>3-2</span>.<br/>
🎧 We are all very happy.<br/>
🎧 We go to the pub after the <span>match</span> and we <span>celebrate</span> our <span>victory</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you want to learn English, you need to have <span>motivation</span> to use English every day.<br/><br />

<h2>How to Learn 3000 Words</h2>

🎧 During the next <span>lesson</span>, one of the students <span>asks</span> our <span>teacher</span> this <span>question</span>, You told us that it is good to know <span>3000</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 Where can I find these <span>3000</span> <span>words</span> which are the most important for me to learn?<br/>
🎧 My <span>teacher</span> <span>replies</span>, You can <span>google</span> a <span>list</span> of the <span>3000</span> most <span>frequent</span> <span>words</span> in English, but such a <span>list</span> will not help you much.<br/>
🎧 When you start to learn <span>words</span> from this <span>list</span>, you will learn <span>words</span> outside the <span>context</span>.<br/>
🎧 You will learn the <span>words</span> which are not <span>connected</span> with any <span>story</span>.<br/>
🎧 You will not learn what other <span>words</span> are <span>connected</span> with these <span>words</span> in <span>sentences</span>.<br/>
🎧 You will learn these <span>words</span> in your <span>short-term</span> <span>memory</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>system</span> <span>works</span> only for some <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 These are <span>basic</span> <span>words</span> which <span>describe</span> things and people around us, for example <span>mother</span>, <span>father</span>, <span>apple</span>, <span>blue</span>, <span>orange</span>, dog, cat, book, car, house, <span>city</span>, boy, girl, water, <span>cinema</span>, or <span>paper</span>.<br/>
🎧 These are <span>words</span> which <span>represent</span> something which you can <span>imagine</span> <span>easily</span>.<br/>
🎧 For example, when you learn the <span>word</span> dog, you know <span>immediately</span> what it is.<br/>
🎧 You have a <span>clear</span> idea in your <span>head</span> what the <span>word</span> <span>means</span>.<br/>
🎧 But when you want to learn <span>words</span> such as <span>appreciate</span> or <span>suppose</span>, this <span>system</span> doesn't work well.<br/>
🎧 This is a <span>problem</span> many students <span>experience</span>.<br/>
🎧 They start their <span>studying</span> by <span>using</span> <span>lists</span> of <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 It <span>works</span> at the <span>beginning</span> and they <span>believe</span> that they can learn English this way.<br/>
🎧 They don't know that when they <span>achieve</span> the <span>level</span> of <span>1000</span> <span>words</span>, they have to start <span>using</span> a different <span>system</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you want to learn <span>words</span> from a <span>higher</span> <span>level</span>, you have to learn them from whole <span>sentences</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you <span>understand</span> the <span>meaning</span> of a <span>word</span> in the <span>context</span> of a <span>sentence</span>, you will learn the <span>word</span> much better.<br/>
🎧 You can learn <span>words</span> from <span>lists</span>, but there is usually a <span>limit</span> where you can go with this way of <span>learning</span>, and it is <span>1000</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 Also, this way of <span>learning</span> is very <span>slow</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are much better <span>ways</span> which we have already <span>spoken</span> about such as <span>reading</span>.<br/>
🎧 For <span>beginners</span>, the best book to read is <span>Robinson</span> <span>Crusoe</span> in simple English.<br/>
🎧 There is also one <span>interesting</span> <span>rule</span> which <span>applies</span> here.<br/>
🎧 Every <span>word</span> which is important for you will come back to your life again and again until you learn the <span>word</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is very <span>similar</span> to the way which we learn your own <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 When we are children, we don't <span>study</span> from <span>lists</span> of <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 We just use the <span>language</span> and important <span>words</span> keep <span>coming</span> into our lives again and again until one day we know what the <span>words</span> mean.<br/>
🎧 We keep <span>learning</span> new <span>words</span> this way all our lives.<br/>
🎧 For example, the <span>verb</span> <span>google</span> is a new <span>word</span> in many <span>languages</span>.<br/>
🎧 We <span>learnt</span> this <span>word</span> by <span>using</span> the <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 We didn't learn this <span>word</span> from any <span>list</span> of <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you heard the <span>word</span> <span>google</span> for the first time, you probably didn't know what the <span>word</span> <span>meant</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then you heard it again and again as the <span>word</span> was important for you and after some time you <span>understood</span> the <span>word</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can <span>forget</span> about <span>lists</span> of <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 Learn new <span>words</span> by <span>reading</span> <span>stories</span> and other <span>interesting</span> <span>texts</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you use English a lot every day, soon you will know <span>3000</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 Does it make <span>sense</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, says the student, Thank you.<br/>
🎧 After school I go to my work.<br/>
🎧 I already know my work very well.<br/>
🎧 Things start to be <span>automatic</span>.<br/>
🎧 I am happy that I <span>understand</span> my <span>customers</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is not very <span>difficult</span> because the <span>conversations</span> are usually very <span>similar</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>customers</span> want some <span>coffee</span> or <span>sandwiches</span>, so the <span>words</span> are usually the same or very <span>similar</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>confidence</span> <span>goes</span> <span>higher</span> and sometimes I start to have <span>longer</span> <span>conversations</span> with our <span>customers</span>.<br/>
🎧 Everything is good but then something <span>happens</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is a little bit <span>shocking</span> for me.<br/><br />

<h2>How to Improve Your Accent</h2>

🎧 On <span>Tuesday</span>, when I am at my work, something <span>interesting</span> <span>happens</span>.<br/>
🎧 Two <span>customers</span> come to our <span>café</span>.<br/>
🎧 They are a <span>husband</span> and a <span>wife</span>.<br/>
🎧 The man <span>starts</span> to speak to me.<br/>
🎧 I know that he <span>speaks</span> English, but I don't <span>understand</span> him.<br/>
🎧 I don't <span>understand</span> what he <span>wants</span>.<br/>
🎧 I think that he <span>wants</span> something we don't have, so I call my <span>boss</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>speaks</span> with the man and she <span>sells</span> him two <span>coffees</span> and two of our <span>regular</span> <span>sandwiches</span>.<br/>
🎧 I am <span>surprised</span>.<br/>
🎧 When they leave, I go to my <span>boss</span> and I tell her that I am sorry I didn't <span>understand</span> the man.<br/>
🎧 She says that it is OK.<br/>
🎧 She says that this can <span>happen</span> when people speak with an <span>accent</span> which is new to us.<br/>
🎧 She tells me that the <span>pair</span> was from <span>Scotland</span>.<br/>
🎧 The next day, I go to school and I tell this <span>story</span> to my <span>teacher</span>.<br/>
🎧 I tell her that I <span>felt</span> really <span>stupid</span> that I didn't <span>understand</span> our <span>customer</span>.<br/>
🎧 I wasn't sure if my English was good enough for my <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>started</span> to <span>doubt</span> myself.<br/>
🎧 My <span>boss</span> was OK with it but I still <span>needed</span> some help from my <span>teacher</span>.<br/>
🎧 I wanted to know what I could do in these <span>situations</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>teacher</span> says, I <span>understand</span>.<br/>
🎧 You are used to English which people speak in <span>London</span>, but you aren't used to the <span>Scottish</span> <span>accent</span>.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>ears</span> aren't used to <span>listening</span> to the <span>Scottish</span> <span>accent</span>.<br/>
🎧 All you have to do is to listen more to <span>Scottish</span> English.<br/>
🎧 You need to <span>train</span> your <span>ears</span> to this <span>accent</span> as well.<br/>
🎧 What <span>happened</span> to you can <span>happen</span> to <span>everybody</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you already speak English at some <span>level</span> and you go to a <span>country</span> where people speak with a different <span>accent</span>, you shouldn't be <span>surprised</span> if you don't <span>understand</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is OK and it usually takes two <span>weeks</span> to get used to this new <span>accent</span>.<br/>
🎧 Don't think that there is something wrong with you when you don't <span>understand</span> a new <span>accent</span>.<br/>
🎧 With practice, you can <span>train</span> your <span>ears</span> to any <span>accent</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then I ask, So what can I do to <span>understand</span> the <span>Scottish</span> <span>accent</span>?<br/>
🎧 I don't live in <span>Scotland</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> says, You can <span>watch</span> <span>films</span> with <span>Scottish</span> English or you can <span>watch</span> <span>situation</span> <span>comedies</span> from <span>Scotland</span> and soon you can <span>understand</span>.<br/>
🎧 I tell her, Thank you.<br/>
🎧 After school, I go to my work again.<br/>
🎧 At about <span>4</span> <span>o'clock</span>, two <span>interesting</span> <span>customers</span> come to our <span>café</span>.<br/>
🎧 This time, they are not from <span>Scotland</span>.<br/>
🎧 They are <span>foreigners</span>.<br/>
🎧 They want to buy some <span>coffee</span>.<br/>
🎧 They are two <span>ladies</span> and it is <span>clear</span> that their English is very <span>basic</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>boss</span> is <span>serving</span> them.<br/>
🎧 When she <span>hears</span> that they don't speak English very well, she does something very <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 She changes her English.<br/>
🎧 She <span>uses</span> very simple <span>sentences</span> with only <span>three</span> or <span>four</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can see that the <span>ladies</span> <span>understand</span> her.<br/>
🎧 They buy two <span>coffees</span>, two <span>sandwiches</span>, and two <span>cakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 They are happy, and my <span>boss</span> is happy too.<br/>
🎧 When the <span>ladies</span> leave, I tell my <span>boss</span> that it was very nice how she <span>changed</span> her English so that the two <span>ladies</span> would <span>understand</span> her.<br/>
🎧 My <span>boss</span> says that sometimes she has to speak in very simple English.<br/>
🎧 It doesn't <span>matter</span> if the <span>customers</span> speak English well or not.<br/>
🎧 They are our <span>customers</span> and we have to do everything <span>possible</span> to make them feel <span>comfortable</span>.<br/>
🎧 If they see that they can speak English here, they can come to our <span>café</span> every day.<br/>
🎧 I think that our <span>boss</span> is a good <span>businesswoman</span>.<br/>
🎧 She does everything <span>possible</span> to make our <span>customers</span> happy.<br/>
🎧 It is <span>true</span> that we have a lot of <span>customers</span>.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>café</span> is <span>busy</span> every day.<br/><br />

<h2>What You Can Do at Your Level</h2>

🎧 The next day at school, I tell my <span>teacher</span> about my <span>experience</span> with my <span>boss</span> and the two <span>ladies</span> who didn't speak English very well.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> says, Great, your <span>boss</span> must be a very <span>clever</span> young <span>lady</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is <span>true</span> that you can <span>communicate</span> with <span>everybody</span>.<br/>
🎧 Even people who speak English very well can have a <span>conversation</span> with those who are just at the <span>beginning</span> of their <span>journey</span>.<br/>
🎧 Today, we will speak about different <span>levels</span> of English and what you should be able to do at these <span>levels</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's start with the <span>lowest</span> <span>level</span> of <span>1000</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 At this <span>level</span>, students can speak about some <span>basic</span> things from everyday life.<br/>
🎧 The <span>speaking</span> is very <span>limited</span>, but it is already <span>possible</span> to <span>communicate</span> <span>slowly</span> for a short time with people who want to speak with you.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>sentences</span> are short.<br/>
🎧 They usually have <span>4</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 If the <span>others</span> also speak in short <span>sentences</span>, you can have a <span>basic</span> <span>conversation</span>.<br/>
🎧 When students move to a <span>higher</span> <span>level</span>, which is <span>2000</span> <span>words</span>, the <span>conversations</span> are <span>easier</span> and the <span>sentences</span> are <span>longer</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is the <span>level</span> most of you in this class are at right now.<br/>
🎧 You should be able to speak about many things from your life.<br/>
🎧 You can speak about your <span>family</span>, <span>hobbies</span>, <span>job</span>, and <span>traveling</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes you can have a <span>problem</span> when you want to go into a <span>deeper</span> <span>conversation</span> on some <span>topics</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, this <span>level</span> is usually <span>sufficient</span> enough for everyday use of English.<br/>
🎧 If you want to be able to have a <span>deeper</span> <span>conversation</span> on many <span>topics</span>, it is good to know <span>3000</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>goal</span>, as a student of English who <span>wants</span> to be able to speak English well, should be to learn <span>3000</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 Of course, you can learn more than <span>3000</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 The more <span>words</span> you know, the <span>easier</span> it will be for you to <span>communicate</span> in English, but <span>3000</span> <span>words</span> is the <span>level</span> which is usually enough for <span>communicating</span> in English about almost everything.<br/>
🎧 I think that the two <span>ladies</span> at your <span>café</span> <span>knew</span> about <span>1000</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>boss</span> went to their <span>level</span>, and she had a <span>basic</span> <span>conversation</span> with them.<br/>
🎧 After my school, I go to my work.<br/>
🎧 The two <span>ladies</span> come to our <span>café</span> again.<br/>
🎧 They also <span>bring</span> two of their friends.<br/>
🎧 It is my <span>turn</span> to <span>serve</span> them.<br/>
🎧 I speak to them in simple short <span>sentences</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>understand</span> me.<br/>
🎧 This is great.<br/>
🎧 They tell me that they are <span>tourists</span> from <span>Japan</span>.<br/>
🎧 They tell me that they like our <span>café</span> because people <span>understand</span> them here.<br/><br />

🎧 On <span>Thursday</span>, I go to school again.<br/>
🎧 One student has a very <span>interesting</span> <span>question</span>.<br/>
🎧 She says, I am very shy when I have to speak English.<br/>
🎧 Can you help me to <span>overcome</span> my <span>shyness</span>?<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> says, It is <span>true</span> that when we use <span>foreign</span> <span>languages</span>, it is <span>natural</span> that we feel <span>uncertain</span> or shy.<br/>
🎧 We are doing something which we are not perfect at.<br/>
🎧 The <span>possibility</span> of <span>making</span> a <span>mistake</span> is great.<br/>
🎧 I was also very shy when I <span>learnt</span> <span>foreign</span> <span>languages</span>.<br/>
🎧 I remember well how I was <span>afraid</span> to make a <span>mistake</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I made a <span>mistake</span>, I <span>felt</span> <span>stupid</span> and sometimes I <span>blushed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, it is different.<br/>
🎧 I use <span>languages</span> for <span>communication</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>care</span> only about <span>communication</span>.<br/>
🎧 You know that I am <span>learning</span> <span>Spanish</span> these <span>days</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Embarrassing</span> <span>situations</span> can <span>happen</span>, but they can't <span>stop</span> me from <span>using</span> <span>Spanish</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is <span>true</span> that sometimes I still feel shy when I have to speak <span>Spanish</span>.<br/>
🎧 I also sometimes <span>blush</span>, but I don't <span>care</span> much about it.<br/>
🎧 It is a <span>natural</span> <span>human</span> feeling and it never <span>lasts</span> <span>forever</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>continue</span> <span>using</span> <span>Spanish</span> because I know that only by <span>using</span> it I can <span>improve</span>.<br/>
🎧 I also try to see things as they are.<br/>
🎧 I am a student and I am on the way to good <span>Spanish</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is not <span>possible</span> to <span>skip</span> <span>several</span> <span>levels</span> in one day.<br/>
🎧 The <span>beginner</span> can't become a perfect <span>speaker</span> in one <span>hour</span>.<br/>
🎧 I also see what I mean to people around me.<br/>
🎧 When I already speak some <span>Spanish</span>, I have <span>value</span> to people who speak <span>Spanish</span>.<br/>
🎧 You should see the same.<br/>
🎧 When you already speak some English, you can have a <span>conversation</span> with other people in English.<br/>
🎧 That's great.<br/>
🎧 Look at what you already know.<br/>
🎧 You know <span>2000</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 You have already <span>gone</span> from <span>0</span> to <span>2000</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Appreciate</span> it.<br/>
🎧 Some students have a feeling that to know English <span>means</span> to be able to speak like a <span>native</span> <span>speaker</span>, to have perfect <span>pronunciation</span>, perfect <span>grammar</span>, and just speak <span>perfectly</span> without any <span>mistakes</span>.<br/>
🎧 They think that if they are not doing that, then they don't know English.<br/>
🎧 They are <span>embarrassed</span> because they are not perfect.<br/>
🎧 These students are very <span>hard</span> on <span>themselves</span>.<br/>
🎧 And it is not <span>necessary</span>.<br/>
🎧 You are great because you already speak some English.<br/>
🎧 <span>Continue</span> working on your English and your <span>shyness</span> can <span>gradually</span> go away.<br/>
🎧 I like what our <span>teacher</span> tells us.<br/>
🎧 I am also sometimes shy.<br/>
🎧 I know that I should practice <span>speaking</span> a lot but in some <span>situations</span>, I don't want to look <span>stupid</span> and I don't speak as much as I should.<br/>
🎧 I decide to be a bit more <span>brave</span> in these <span>situations</span> and use them to practice more.<br/>
🎧 Then one student says, Sometimes I want to say something but I don't know the <span>word</span> which I want to say.<br/>
🎧 Then I <span>stop</span> and I don't know what to do.<br/>
🎧 In these <span>situations</span>, I feel very <span>stupid</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then the next time when I can speak English, I don't want to speak because I don't want to be in this <span>stupid</span> <span>situation</span> again.<br/>
🎧 Can you help me with this?<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> says, When you start to speak English, you have to <span>prepare</span> for one thing.<br/>
🎧 There will be <span>moments</span> when you don't know a <span>word</span> which you want to say.<br/>
🎧 In such a <span>situation</span>, you will need to learn how to <span>describe</span> the <span>word</span>.<br/>
🎧 This <span>ability</span> is very important when <span>learning</span> a new <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 Since you are not a <span>native</span> English <span>speaker</span>, you will probably never know the same amount of <span>words</span> as you know in your <span>native</span> <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can tell you that you can <span>describe</span> almost every <span>word</span>.<br/>
🎧 You only need to <span>train</span> this <span>skill</span>.<br/>
🎧 You will have to <span>train</span> how to <span>express</span> <span>ideas</span> <span>within</span> the <span>vocabulary</span> you have.<br/>
🎧 For example, you don't know how to say the <span>word</span> key.<br/>
🎧 You can <span>describe</span> it as a small thing for <span>opening</span> a <span>door</span>.<br/>
🎧 You also <span>describe</span> <span>words</span> in your <span>native</span> <span>language</span> without <span>realizing</span> it.<br/>
🎧 If you don't know the <span>word</span> for something, you just <span>describe</span> it to the other person so that he or she <span>understands</span> what it is.<br/>
🎧 You can do the same thing in English, but you need to <span>train</span> this <span>ability</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thinking <span>aloud</span> is a very good <span>technique</span> to use when you want to be able to <span>describe</span> well.<br/>
🎧 Use thinking <span>aloud</span> every day and your <span>ability</span> to <span>describe</span> things will <span>improve</span>.<br/><br />

<h2>Who Is Talented</h2>

🎧 The next day is <span>Friday</span> and I go to school again.<br/>
🎧 I am happy that I go to this class not only because of our <span>teacher</span>.<br/>
🎧 I like this class because there are students from many different <span>countries</span> in our class.<br/>
🎧 Some students are from <span>Europe</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some students are from <span>South</span> <span>America</span>.<br/>
🎧 There is also one student from <span>Japan</span> and one from <span>South</span> <span>Korea</span> in my class.<br/>
🎧 This is good for me because the students don't speak my <span>native</span> <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I speak to them, I have to use only English.<br/>
🎧 It is very good for my practice.<br/>
🎧 Today, we have another new student in our class.<br/>
🎧 Her name is <span>Sofia</span>.<br/>
🎧 She is from <span>Argentina</span>.<br/>
🎧 At the <span>beginning</span> of the <span>lesson</span>, <span>Sofia</span> says that she <span>thinks</span> that she doesn't have a <span>talent</span> for <span>studying</span> <span>languages</span>, but she <span>wants</span> to work <span>hard</span> to <span>improve</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>teacher</span> <span>asks</span> her, Why do you think that you don't have a <span>talent</span>?<br/>
🎧 She <span>answers</span>, I think that I don't have a <span>talent</span> because my <span>sister</span> <span>learns</span> English very <span>fast</span> but for me it is <span>difficult</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then our <span>teacher</span> <span>asks</span> <span>everybody</span> in the class, Do you think that you have a <span>talent</span> for <span>learning</span> <span>languages</span>?<br/>
🎧 Please put your <span>hand</span> up if you <span>believe</span> that you have a <span>talent</span>.<br/>
🎧 I look around the class and <span>nobody</span> <span>puts</span> their <span>hands</span> up.<br/>
🎧 My <span>teacher</span> <span>smiles</span>, then she says, Now, I want to tell you something.<br/>
🎧 Many people think that you need to have a <span>talent</span> if you really want to learn a new <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 I agree.<br/>
🎧 Yes, you need to have a <span>talent</span> if you want to learn a new <span>language</span>, but I also <span>believe</span> that you already have a <span>talent</span> for <span>learning</span> <span>languages</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why do you have a <span>talent</span>?<br/>
🎧 You have a <span>talent</span> because you already <span>learnt</span> one <span>language</span>, which is your <span>native</span> <span>language</span>.<br/>
🎧 You were <span>successful</span> at <span>learning</span> your <span>native</span> <span>language</span> and you speak that <span>language</span> <span>fluently</span>.<br/>
🎧 All people who are able to learn their <span>native</span> <span>language</span> have a <span>talent</span> for <span>learning</span> <span>languages</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why do many students <span>believe</span> that they are not <span>talented</span>?<br/>
🎧 The <span>reason</span> is this.<br/>
🎧 There are people who are <span>super-talented</span>.<br/>
🎧 Yes, it is <span>true</span>.<br/>
🎧 These <span>super-talented</span> people remember new <span>words</span> very <span>fast</span> and for a <span>longer</span> time.<br/>
🎧 Maybe you know these people.<br/>
🎧 Maybe it is <span>somebody</span> at your work or in your <span>family</span>.<br/>
🎧 There are not many of these people, but they <span>exist</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>believe</span> that this can be <span>Sofia's</span> <span>sister</span> as well.<br/>
🎧 <span>Learning</span> a new <span>language</span> is fun for these people and they can do it <span>easily</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Sofia</span> says that it is <span>true</span>, that her <span>sister</span> is really better than <span>everybody</span> else.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> <span>continues</span>, It is <span>true</span> that these <span>super-talented</span> people <span>exist</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is a <span>fact</span> and we <span>cannot</span> do anything about it.<br/>
🎧 And it is not a <span>problem</span>.<br/>
🎧 The <span>problem</span> is that we <span>compare</span> <span>ourselves</span> to these people and if we don't learn as <span>fast</span> as they do, we think that we are not <span>talented</span>.<br/>
🎧 I want to ask you for one thing.<br/>
🎧 Please do not <span>compare</span> yourself to these <span>super-talented</span> people.<br/>
🎧 Yes, they are <span>lucky</span> and they have an <span>advantage</span>, but you can be <span>lucky</span> too and you are <span>super-talented</span> at doing other things.<br/>
🎧 Maybe you are more <span>talented</span> than <span>others</span> when you learn to <span>sing</span>, <span>swim</span>, play <span>tennis</span>, <span>count</span> <span>numbers</span>, <span>cook</span>, or <span>repair</span> <span>cars</span>.<br/>
🎧 People are not all the same.<br/>
🎧 It is a <span>beauty</span> of this <span>world</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, you can <span>believe</span> that you are also <span>talented</span>, maybe not <span>super-talented</span>, but <span>talented</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you <span>believe</span> that you are <span>talented</span>, <span>learning</span> English will be <span>easier</span> for you.<br/>
🎧 These <span>words</span> from our <span>teacher</span> are very <span>helpful</span> for us.<br/>
🎧 I know that I am <span>talented</span> at playing <span>football</span> and <span>tennis</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now I know that I am also <span>talented</span> at <span>learning</span> English.<br/>
🎧 It is great.<br/>
🎧 What is also great is that there is a school <span>party</span> in the <span>evening</span>.<br/>
🎧 I really look forward to this <span>party</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know that some girls from our class are going there.<br/>
🎧 I hope that our new student <span>Sofia</span> is also going to the <span>party</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know <span>Sofia</span> for only one day, but I like her a lot.<br/><br />

<h2>How to Speak Fluently</h2>

🎧 On <span>Monday</span>, I go to school again.<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> <span>asks</span> us how <span>Friday's</span> school <span>party</span> was.<br/>
🎧 One student says that the <span>party</span> was great.<br/>
🎧 We had a lot of <span>drinks</span> and a lot of fun.<br/>
🎧 The girls from our class <span>enjoyed</span> the <span>party</span> as well.<br/>
🎧 I <span>enjoyed</span> the <span>party</span> a lot because <span>Sofia</span> was there.<br/>
🎧 I could talk to her, and we <span>danced</span> together.<br/>
🎧 It was all very nice.<br/>
🎧 There were also two <span>boys</span> from my <span>football</span> <span>team</span> at the <span>party</span>.<br/>
🎧 These <span>boys</span> were from <span>Brazil</span>.<br/>
🎧 Their English was simple.<br/>
🎧 They could speak only in short <span>sentences</span>, but they were <span>extremely</span> funny at the <span>party</span>.<br/>
🎧 They made a lot of <span>jokes</span> about life in <span>England</span>, about other <span>players</span> from our <span>team</span>, and about girls from their class.<br/>
🎧 <span>Everybody</span> <span>laughed</span>.<br/>
🎧 Their <span>sentences</span> were very short with only <span>three</span> or <span>four</span> <span>words</span>, but they were able to speak <span>fluently</span>.<br/>
🎧 When we speak about the <span>party</span>, I tell my <span>teacher</span>, It was really <span>interesting</span> to see that <span>somebody</span> who doesn't know many <span>words</span> can already speak <span>fluently</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know some students who are at a much <span>higher</span> <span>level</span> and have a <span>hard</span> time <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 My <span>teacher</span> says, This is really <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 I can tell you that the two <span>boys</span> from your <span>football</span> <span>team</span> <span>showed</span> you what all students should do.<br/>
🎧 The <span>boys</span> used what they <span>knew</span>.<br/>
🎧 They <span>cared</span> only about what was really important.<br/>
🎧 It was <span>communication</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then one girl <span>asks</span>, So, what should we do if we want to speak English <span>fluently</span>?<br/>
🎧 Should we go to <span>parties</span> and make <span>jokes</span>?<br/>
🎧 My <span>teacher</span> says, First, let me <span>explain</span> what <span>fluent</span> <span>speaking</span> is.<br/>
🎧 Many students think that <span>fluent</span> <span>speaking</span> is <span>fast</span> <span>speaking</span> with a lot of <span>words</span> and perfect <span>grammar</span>.<br/>
🎧 But there is a better, more <span>correct</span> <span>definition</span> of <span>fluent</span> <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Fluent</span> <span>speaking</span> is <span>speaking</span> without long <span>pauses</span>.<br/>
🎧 Some people can do it at <span>1000</span> <span>words</span>, some people can do it at <span>2000</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 But there are also people who know <span>3000</span> <span>words</span> and aren't able to speak <span>fluently</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you want to speak <span>fluently</span>, you have to practice <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 There is no other way to <span>improve</span> your <span>fluency</span>.<br/>
🎧 <span>Speaking</span> is a <span>physical</span> <span>activity</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is like playing a <span>musical</span> <span>instrument</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you want to play a <span>violin</span>, you need to <span>train</span> the <span>connection</span> between your <span>brain</span> and the <span>muscles</span> on your <span>fingers</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you want to speak well, you need to <span>train</span> the <span>connection</span> between your <span>brain</span> and the <span>muscles</span> in your <span>mouth</span>.<br/>
🎧 If the <span>connection</span> between your <span>brain</span> and your <span>mouth</span> is not often <span>trained</span>, you can't speak <span>fluently</span> no <span>matter</span> how many <span>words</span> you know.<br/>
🎧 You can't <span>complain</span> that you can't speak <span>fluently</span> if you don't practice <span>speaking</span> often.<br/>
🎧 You can have this <span>experience</span>.<br/>
🎧 You meet a <span>foreigner</span> who <span>wants</span> to speak with you in English.<br/>
🎧 You want to say <span>ideas</span> which are in your <span>head</span>, but you aren't able to do it.<br/>
🎧 You can't find the right <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then, when you end the <span>conversation</span> and play it back in your <span>head</span>, you <span>realize</span> that you actually know the right <span>words</span>, but the <span>conversation</span> is already <span>finished</span>.<br/>
🎧 Why do you <span>experience</span> such <span>situations</span>?<br/>
🎧 Because you have little <span>training</span>.<br/>
🎧 Your <span>speaking</span> isn't <span>automatic</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is not <span>automatic</span> because you don't practice it often enough.<br/>
🎧 When you want to speak <span>fluently</span>, I <span>recommend</span> <span>speaking</span> for at <span>least</span> <span>30</span> <span>minutes</span> a day.<br/>
🎧 You can speak to a <span>real</span> person.<br/>
🎧 If you don't have a <span>real</span> person to speak to, you can do thinking <span>aloud</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is <span>necessary</span> to really think <span>aloud</span> and not only think in your <span>head</span>.<br/>
🎧 You need to practice the <span>connection</span> between your <span>brain</span> and your <span>muscles</span>.<br/>
🎧 You can do this by thinking <span>aloud</span>.<br/>
🎧 Does it make <span>sense</span>?<br/>
🎧 Yes, says the girl.<br/><br />

<h2>What Is the Best School</h2>

🎧 At the next <span>lesson</span>, one of the students <span>asks</span> an <span>interesting</span> <span>question</span>.<br/>
🎧 She says, Next week, I am going home.<br/>
🎧 I would like to <span>continue</span> <span>studying</span> in my <span>country</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't know how to choose a good school there.<br/>
🎧 Could you help me?<br/>
🎧 How do I know if the school is good or not?<br/>
🎧 My <span>teacher</span> says, This is a very good <span>question</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>believe</span> that when you read, listen and speak a lot, you don't have to go to a school.<br/>
🎧 You will learn English <span>naturally</span> by <span>using</span> it.<br/>
🎧 But if you want to pay for your <span>education</span>, a good <span>teacher</span> can help you <span>speed</span> up the <span>process</span> of <span>learning</span>.<br/>
🎧 After <span>5</span> <span>lessons</span> at the new school, do the <span>test</span> again and you can see how many new <span>words</span> you <span>learnt</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you are happy with your <span>progress</span>, you can <span>continue</span> <span>paying</span> for your <span>lessons</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is also important that you enjoy every <span>lesson</span> and you look forward to the next one.<br/>
🎧 It is important to enjoy every <span>activity</span> which you do with English.<br/>
🎧 This is great <span>news</span> for me.<br/>
🎧 I didn't know that it was <span>possible</span> to have a <span>private</span> <span>lesson</span> with my <span>teacher</span>.<br/>
🎧 Soon, I am also going back to my <span>country</span> and I want to have <span>private</span> <span>lessons</span> with my <span>teacher</span>.<br/><br />

<h2>What to Do When You Need Help</h2>

🎧 It is <span>Wednesday</span> and I go to school again.<br/>
🎧 At the <span>beginning</span> of the next <span>lesson</span>, <span>Monica</span> has a <span>question</span> for my <span>teacher</span>.<br/>
🎧 She <span>asks</span> her, How do you know all of this?<br/>
🎧 Where did you learn <span>information</span> about <span>studying</span> <span>languages</span>?<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> says, There are many <span>ways</span> to get <span>knowledge</span> on how to learn and <span>teach</span> <span>languages</span>.<br/>
🎧 The first one is <span>experience</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have been <span>teaching</span> for more than <span>7</span> years.<br/>
🎧 I have many years of <span>experience</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I <span>teach</span> you, I <span>observe</span> what <span>works</span> and what doesn't and then I use only things which help.<br/>
🎧 I also <span>study</span> <span>materials</span> about <span>learning</span> <span>languages</span> on the <span>Internet</span>.<br/>
🎧 When I find something <span>interesting</span>, I <span>test</span> it in one of my <span>classes</span>.<br/>
🎧 If it <span>works</span>, I use it in all other <span>classes</span>.<br/>
🎧 There is also another way I get <span>information</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is usually during <span>moments</span> when I have a <span>question</span> but I can't find an answer.<br/>
🎧 During these <span>moments</span>, I go and visit my <span>magic</span> <span>park</span> and I get the answer there.<br/>
🎧 <span>Monica</span> tells my <span>teacher</span>, This is <span>interesting</span>.<br/>
🎧 How do you get the <span>answers</span> in the <span>magic</span> <span>park</span>.<br/>
🎧 Where is the <span>magic</span> <span>park</span>?<br/>
🎧 Can we go there too?<br/>
🎧 My <span>teacher</span> says, What I am going to tell you is not <span>real</span> to <span>everybody</span>.<br/>
🎧 If it sounds <span>crazy</span>, I am sorry.<br/>
🎧 But you <span>asked</span> for it, so I am <span>giving</span> you the answer.<br/>
🎧 I <span>believe</span> that if you have a <span>question</span> and you ask the <span>universe</span> for an answer, the answer comes.<br/>
🎧 When I have a <span>question</span>, I go to the <span>magic</span> <span>park</span>.<br/>
🎧 I sit on a <span>bench</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>relax</span> my <span>body</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>slow</span> down my <span>breathing</span> and I try to free my <span>mind</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then I ask the <span>question</span>.<br/>
🎧 This is all.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes the answer comes as a new idea in my <span>head</span>.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes <span>somebody</span> who I speak to later tells me something which helps me get the answer.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes I <span>watch</span> an <span>interesting</span> <span>video</span> on the <span>Internet</span> and I find the answer there.<br/>
🎧 Sometimes the <span>answers</span> come the next day in the morning when I <span>wake</span> up.<br/>
🎧 What is <span>interesting</span> is the <span>fact</span> that the <span>answers</span> keep <span>coming</span>.<br/>
🎧 I am so <span>grateful</span> for them.<br/>
🎧 As I said, you don't have to <span>believe</span> what I am <span>telling</span> you, but this is what I do and how it <span>works</span> for me.<br/>
🎧 The <span>park</span> is not very <span>far</span> from here.<br/>
🎧 It is a ten <span>minute</span> <span>walk</span>.<br/>
🎧 A lot of people go to the <span>park</span> to <span>relax</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is <span>beautiful</span>.<br/>
🎧 It has a very nice <span>atmosphere</span>.<br/>
🎧 I call it a <span>magic</span> <span>park</span> because it is <span>magical</span> for me.<br/>
🎧 My <span>teacher's</span> <span>words</span> are very <span>interesting</span> for me.<br/>
🎧 I didn't know that people can ask the <span>universe</span> for <span>answers</span>.<br/>
🎧 Maybe in the future, when I have some <span>interesting</span> <span>question</span>, I can go to the <span>park</span> and also ask for an answer.<br/><br />

<h2>Summary</h2>

🎧 The next day, one girl <span>asks</span> our <span>teacher</span> an <span>interesting</span> <span>question</span>.<br/>
🎧 She says, Thank you for the <span>information</span> you are <span>giving</span> us on how to learn English.<br/>
🎧 Could you give us a <span>summary</span> with some <span>rules</span> on what we can do every day to learn English well?<br/>
🎧 Our <span>teacher</span> says, OK, I will try to give you a simple <span>summary</span>.<br/>
🎧 If you want to speak English well, you need to do <span>3</span> things.<br/>
🎧 You have to read, listen and speak.<br/>
🎧 You already know that.<br/>
🎧 What is important is that you do all these <span>3</span> <span>activities</span> about the same amount of time.<br/>
🎧 If you leave one out, then your <span>progress</span> will not be as <span>fast</span> as it could be.<br/>
🎧 From my <span>experience</span>, I can say that it is important to use English every day for at <span>least</span> <span>90</span> <span>minutes</span>.<br/>
🎧 You don't have to <span>study</span>, but you should use English <span>actively</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, I will <span>explain</span> every <span>activity</span> in more <span>detail</span>.<br/>
🎧 Let's start with <span>reading</span>.<br/>
🎧 You should read for at <span>least</span> <span>30</span> <span>minutes</span> every day.<br/>
🎧 It is the <span>minimum</span>.<br/>
🎧 Don't read to <span>study</span> English.<br/>
🎧 Read to get some new <span>information</span>.<br/>
🎧 Read to enjoy an <span>interesting</span> <span>story</span>.<br/>
🎧 I know that I <span>repeat</span> this <span>information</span> again and again but it is really important.<br/>
🎧 Then, you should listen to English for at <span>least</span> <span>30</span> <span>minutes</span> every day.<br/>
🎧 Again, it should be something which you are interested in.<br/>
🎧 You should enjoy getting the <span>information</span>.<br/>
🎧 You should start to listen to simple <span>audio</span> books or <span>news</span> first.<br/>
🎧 Then you should go to a <span>higher</span> and <span>higher</span> <span>level</span> of books and <span>news</span>.<br/>
🎧 When you know <span>2000</span> <span>words</span>, you should start watching <span>films</span> and <span>videos</span> on the <span>Internet</span>.<br/>
🎧 Then there is <span>speaking</span>.<br/>
🎧 You already know how important it is to speak when you <span>study</span> English.<br/>
🎧 Again it is important to speak for at <span>least</span> <span>30</span> <span>minutes</span> every day.<br/>
🎧 Of course, the best way is to speak to <span>real</span> people.<br/>
🎧 It can be your <span>teacher</span>, your <span>classmates</span>, <span>colleagues</span> or friends.<br/>
🎧 Try to find <span>somebody</span> who is at your <span>level</span> of English or a little bit better and speak with this person.<br/>
🎧 <span>However</span>, if you have <span>nobody</span> to speak to, with <span>shadowing</span> and thinking <span>aloud</span>, you can also get a lot of <span>speaking</span> practice every day.<br/>
🎧 I use these <span>techniques</span> very often when I learn <span>Spanish</span>.<br/>
🎧 I don't have any <span>native</span> <span>Spanish</span> <span>speakers</span> in my life who I would meet every day.<br/>
🎧 I use these two <span>techniques</span> to <span>improve</span> my <span>Spanish</span>.<br/>
🎧 As you can see, <span>studying</span> English is simple.<br/>
🎧 All you have to do is read, listen and speak.<br/>
🎧 This is all.<br/>
🎧 Now, you know how to do it.<br/>
🎧 Thank you, says the girl.<br/>
🎧 This is what I <span>needed</span> to hear.<br/>
🎧 You are the best.<br/>
🎧 I am also very glad that the girl <span>asked</span> this <span>question</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is my last day at school and I <span>needed</span> some kind of <span>summary</span> on what I can do.<br/>
🎧 During the <span>four</span> <span>weeks</span> I have <span>spent</span> with my <span>teacher</span>, I have <span>learnt</span> a lot.<br/>
🎧 I have also <span>improved</span> my English very much.<br/>
🎧 My <span>teacher</span> <span>knows</span> that this is my last day at school.<br/>
🎧 She <span>asks</span> me if I want to say something to the other students in the class.<br/>
🎧 I say that I was very happy to be a <span>part</span> of this class, and I <span>met</span> a lot of nice people.<br/>
🎧 I give <span>everybody</span> my <span>email</span> <span>address</span> and I tell them that they can <span>contact</span> me if they want to.<br/>
🎧 Then I say <span>goodbye</span> to <span>everybody</span>.<br/>
🎧 I am a little sad but I know that I have to <span>continue</span> with my life.<br/>
🎧 I can't be at school <span>forever</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, it is up to me to <span>improve</span> my English.<br/>
🎧 I have all the <span>tools</span> I need.<br/>
🎧 Now, it is one year after my last day at school.<br/>
🎧 I used English every day.<br/>
🎧 I used the <span>techniques</span> from my <span>teacher</span>.<br/>
🎧 Now, I know <span>4000</span> <span>words</span> in English.<br/>
🎧 It is great.<br/>
🎧 I also have a new <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 I start to <span>teach</span> English.<br/>
🎧 I <span>teach</span> <span>beginners</span>.<br/>
🎧 They know only <span>500</span> <span>words</span>.<br/>
🎧 It is good for me because I know that I need a lot of practice as a <span>teacher</span> before I can <span>teach</span> at <span>higher</span> <span>levels</span>.<br/>
🎧 I have one great <span>advantage</span> in my new <span>job</span>.<br/>
🎧 I had a great <span>teacher</span> in <span>London</span>.<br/>
🎧 I <span>learnt</span> a lot from her.<br/>
🎧 Now, I am trying to give all I <span>learnt</span> from my <span>teacher</span> to my students.<br/>
🎧 I want them to be <span>successful</span> as well.<br/>
🎧 Hope you have <span>enjoyed</span> the <span>reading</span>.<br/>
🎧 Thanks for watching!<br/>
