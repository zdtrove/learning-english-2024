Dress Down - Wear Casual Clothes

Did you see the email about Friday’s team outing? They said we can dress down for the day.
Yeah, it’s nice to have a break from the usual business attire. I’m thinking of wearing jeans and a T-shirt since they mentioned games and a barbecue.
That sounds good. It’s always funny seeing everyone out of their formal office wear, isn’t it?
Definitely, but it’s a nice change. It helps everyone relax and connect better.
True, and it’s way easier to join activities when you’re not in a suit.
Exactly! I’m looking forward to it. Let’s hope the weather cooperates.
Me too. Casual Fridays don’t happen often, so let’s make the most of it!

Mark Down - Reduce the Price

Have you been to the new store downtown yet?
Not yet. What’s it like?
I went yesterday, and they have tons of items marked down.
Really? How big are the discounts?
Some items are up to 50% off. I got a new jacket for half the original price.
That’s amazing! I’ve been looking for deals on winter clothes.
You should check it out. They have a great selection, and the markdowns are substantial.
Do you think the sale will last long?
Not sure, but the salesperson said they’re clearing out inventory, so it might go on for a while.
Good to know. I’ll try to go this weekend and see what I can find.
Sounds like a plan—you might find some great deals!

Jump In - Enter Into an Activity With Enthusiasm

Have you ever tried salsa dancing? I’m thinking about signing up for classes.
Actually, I’ve been going for a couple of months now. You should jump in—the classes are a blast!
Really? It sounds like fun, but I’m a bit nervous since I’ve never danced before.
I felt the same way at first, but the instructors are great. Everyone is a beginner at some point, so there’s no pressure to be perfect.
That’s reassuring. What should I expect from my first class?
They usually start with simple steps and timing, then gradually add more complex moves as you get comfortable. It’s very progressive.
That sounds manageable. How often do the classes meet?
They’re held twice a week, but you can jump in anytime. There’s no set sequence, so you won’t fall behind.
Great! That flexibility helps. Maybe I’ll join you next week.
Absolutely! I think you’ll enjoy it—it’s a great way to unwind and meet new people.

Catch Off Guard - Surprise Someone Unexpectedly

Did you hear about Sarah’s surprise party last weekend?
No, I missed it. How did it go?
It was incredible. We totally caught her off guard—she thought she was going to a dinner for her brother’s promotion.
That’s brilliant! Her reaction must have been priceless.
Absolutely. She was speechless at first. It took her a moment to take it all in, and everyone did a great job keeping it a secret.
Who all was there?
Pretty much the whole gang and some of her family members. We had it at her favorite restaurant downtown, and the place was decorated beautifully.
That sounds like a lot of fun. Did you guys do anything special?
Yeah, we put together a video montage of memories from everyone. It was a mix of funny and heartfelt messages, and it definitely caught her off guard too.
Wow, that’s so thoughtful. I’ll have to check in with her—it sounds like it was a night to remember.

Give Back - Return Something to Its Original Owner

Did you manage to give back those books you borrowed from Steve?
Yes, I dropped them off yesterday. He was really glad to get them back since some of them were first editions.
That’s thoughtful. It’s important to respect other people’s belongings, especially when they have sentimental value.
Absolutely. I always make sure to return things in the condition I received them. Giving back what isn’t yours is just the right thing to do.
Definitely. I lent a rare book to a friend once and never got it back—it was disheartening.
I can imagine. That’s why I never delay returning things. It helps avoid awkward situations later on.
True, it’s all about maintaining trust. Speaking of which, do you need any books? I just got a few new ones—you’re welcome to borrow them.
I might take you up on that! Thanks. I’ll make sure to give them back as soon as I’m done.

Flesh Out - Add More Details to Something to Make It More Complete

So, you mentioned you’re working on a new story for that writing competition. How’s it going?
It’s going well, but I’m still trying to flesh out the main characters. I want them to be more than just stereotypes.
What’s the story about?
It’s a mystery set in a small coastal town. The main character is a retired detective who gets pulled back into solving crimes.
That sounds intriguing. To flesh out your characters, maybe you could give them quirks or backstories that influence how they solve problems.
That’s a good idea. I’ve been thinking about giving the detective a reason for retiring early that ties into the main plot.
That could add a lot of depth. Maybe his last case went wrong, and this new case somehow connects to it.
I like that! It ties everything together and gives the character a personal stake in solving the mystery. Thanks for the suggestion.

Light Up - Illuminate

Did you see the new park renovations? They did a great job, especially with the lighting.
I haven't had the chance yet. What did they change?
They've installed these new LED light paths that light up beautifully at night. It completely transforms the place.
That sounds amazing! It must make the park look so different in the evenings.
It does, and it feels safer too. The whole area is well illuminated, which makes it perfect for evening walks.
That's a smart upgrade. Good lighting can really enhance the atmosphere of a place.
Absolutely! And it's not just the paths—they’ve added lights to the trees and benches too. The entire space just lights up so well.
I'll have to check it out. Maybe we can go for a walk there this weekend.
Sounds like a plan! You’ll love how it looks, plus it’s a good way to enjoy the outdoors after sunset.
Great! I’m looking forward to it. It’ll be nice to see how the lights add to the ambiance.

Shake Up - Make Significant Changes or Cause a Disturbance

Did you hear about the new management at Jenna's company? They're planning to really shake things up.
Really? I hadn’t heard that. What kind of changes are they thinking about?
From what Jenna told me, the new CEO wants to restructure several departments and possibly introduce flexible working hours. They're even considering remote work options.
That sounds like a big shake-up. Do you think it’ll be good for the company in the long run?
It could be. Jenna seems optimistic. She thinks the changes could lead to better work-life balance and might even boost productivity.
It's interesting how many companies are switching to these kinds of policies now. It must be a challenge to implement, but I guess it’s necessary for keeping up with the times.
Definitely. It's all about adapting to new realities. Plus, the flexibility could really help attract and retain talented employees.
True. I wish our company would take some notes. It’d be nice to have more flexible working conditions here too.

Mull Over - Think About Deeply or at Length

Have you decided on the vacation spot yet?
I’m still mulling over a couple of options. It’s hard to choose between the beach resort and the mountain cabin.
Both sound like great choices. What’s making it difficult to decide?
Well, the beach is ideal for relaxation, and I love the ocean. But the cabin offers solitude and hiking, which I also enjoy.
Sounds like you’ve got some good options. Maybe think about what kind of break you really need right now.
That’s good advice. I’ve been mulling over what would be more refreshing. The beach has the sun and surf, but the mountains might be cooler this time of year.
Maybe consider the activities each place offers and who you're going with. That might help narrow it down.
True. I’ll take a deeper look at the amenities and nearby attractions for both. Thanks for helping me sort this out!
Anytime! Once you’ve mulled it over a bit more, let me know. I’m excited to hear about your choice.

Tune Out - Stop Listening or Paying Attention

Did you go to the town hall meeting last night?
I did, but I have to admit I tuned out after the first hour. It was so long and repetitive.
I know what you mean. They tend to drag on. Was anything important discussed before you tuned out?
Just the usual updates on community projects. They spent a lot of time on budget allocations.
That can get tedious. Did they mention anything about the new park proposal?
They did, but it was buried in so much other stuff. I think I missed some details when I tuned out.
No worries. I’ll check the minutes when they’re posted online. It’s easier to catch up that way.
Good idea. Next time, I might just read the summary instead of attending the whole meeting.
Same here. It’s hard to stay focused for that long.

play up - emphasize or exaggerate 

I just got back from the car dealership you wouldn't believe the sales pitch I got today 
oh do tell was it the usual Spiel or something else out of the ordinary they were really playing up the features of the latest model I mean the car does have some nice upgrades but the way they talked about the onboard technology was as if it could drive itself that's salespeople for you always making things sound more revolutionary than they are did you end up liking the car though I liked it yes it's sleek and drives smoothly but with how they were pushing it I felt like I was buying a spaceship not a sedan sounds like they know how to make an impression are you thinking about going for it or are you looking at other options I'm considering it the car's good but I need to do a bit more research I don't want to make a decision based solely on an exaggerated sales pitch smart move take your time and maybe you'll find something even better without all the hype 

Gear Up - prepare for an event or action 

are you getting excited about the hiking trip next weekend I've started to gear up already 
absolutely I can't wait I've been checking my equipment too what all have you prepared so far 
I've got my backpack sorted out with the Essentials water filter first aid kit and extra layers in case it gets cold I also upgraded my hiking boots what about you 
I'm focusing on the technical gear just picked up a new lightweight tent and a better Sleeping Bag suitable for the colder temperatures we might face at night 
good call on the sleeping bag it's supposed to cool down quite a bit have you thought about meals 
yeah I'm planning to pack high energy foods like nuts dried fruits and granola bars plus I'll bring some dehydrated meals just add water 
sounds like we're both well prepared it's going to be an amazing trip I'm glad we took the time to properly Gear Up 
me too a good prep can make all the difference out there can't wait to hit the trail with you 

Jazz up - make something more interesting or Lively 

have you thought about how we can make the party more exciting 
yeah I think we need to Jazz up the decorations a bit the current setup feels too plain 
I agree how about adding some string lights and colorful balloons that could make the space feel more festive 
good idea we could also set up a photo booth with fun props it'll give people something to do and create great memories 
I love that what about the music should we create a more lively playlist 
definitely a mix of upbeat tracks and some old favorites should get everyone dancing 
sounds perfect do you think we should have a themed dress code to add some flare 
that could be fun maybe a retro theme it's easy for people to dress up for and always looks great 
retro it is then this is going to be a party to remember 

usher in - Mark the beginning of something 

have you seen the decorations downtown they're really going all out for the Centennial Celebration 
yes I noticed them setting up last night it seems like it's going to be a huge event 
definitely they're saying it's going to usher in a new annual tradition if this turns out well a lot of history to commemorate 
that would be wonderful it's about time we had something regular to bring the community together what's on the agenda for the event 
there are parades live music and a lot of local food vendors plus a fireworks show to cap off the night 
sounds like it's not just a celebration but a real boost for local businesses too 
absolutely it's a win-win for everyone I'm planning on spending the whole day there 

rush off - leave in a hurry 

hey are you still free to grab lunch today 
I was actually about to text you I have to rush off to an unexpected meeting at 1 pm can we reschedule 
no problem I understand stand how about tomorrow does that work for you 
tomorrow should be perfect I'm really sorry for the short notice today it just came up and I couldn't push it back 
it's totally fine I get it we all have those days hope the meeting goes well 
thanks I appreciate it it's about the new project launch so it's pretty important 
sounds like a big deal well good luck with everything just let me know what time works for you tomorrow 
we'll do I'll check my schedule and confirm by tonight thanks for being flexible 
of course catch up soon and don't rush too much make sure to grab some lunch 
I will thanks talk soon 

lay down - establish rules or guidelines 

have you thought about how we're going to manage the book club meetings 
yes I think we should lay down some guidelines to keep everything organized and enjoyable for everyone 
that's a good idea what kind of guidelines are you thinking about 
first we should lay down a rule about meeting times I'm thinking we should meet once a month on the first Saturday 
that works for me what about the book selection process 
we could take turns choosing books each month a different member gets to pick the book but we'll make sure it's announced at least a month in advance 
sounds fair should we also lay down some rules about the discussions like staying on topic and giving everyone a chance to speak 
definitely we want to ensure it's a respectful and engaging environment for everyone 
great these guidelines should help make our book club successful and enjoyable 

hook up - connect equipment 

did you manage to hook up the new sound system in the living room 
yeah I set it up yesterday the sound quality is incredible compared to the old one 
that's great was it difficult to connect everything 
not really the instructions were clear and it was mostly just plugging in a few cables the wireless subwoofer was the easiest part it connected automatically 
nice we should test it with a movie night maybe something with a great soundtrack 
definitely how about something action-packed that should really show off the system's capabilities 
sounds good I'll bring over some Classics maybe star war zers or jurass Jurassic Park 
perfect choices Jurassic Park especially with those dinosaur roars it'll be like they're right in the room with us 
it's settled then I'll bring the popcorn 
and I'll make sure we have plenty of drinks it's going to be a good one 

live up to - meet expectations or standards 

have you seen the new superhero movie everyone's talking about 
yeah I watched it last night it was good but I don't think it lived up to all the hype 
really I've heard mixed reviews what didn't you like about it 
the story line was a bit predictable and some of the characters didn't live up to their potential 
that's disappointing I was hoping it would be as good as the last one 
the special effects were great but overall it didn't live up to my expectations 
I guess I'll lower my expectations before I watch it 
that might be a good idea it's still entertaining just not as amazing as everyone made it out to be 
got it thanks for the heads up I'll give it it a shot this weekend 
no problem let me know what you think after you watch it 

clamp down on - suppress or restrict strictly 

have you heard about the new rules at the gym 
no what new rules 
they're clamping down on using cell phones in the workout area 
really that's a bit strict why did they do that 
apparently too many people were taking selfies and not actually working out it was becoming a problem 
I guess that makes sense it can be annoying when people are more focused on their phones than exercising 
exactly they've also started clamping down on people not wiping down the equipment after use 
that's a good move hygiene is important especially in a gym 
for sure I think it'll make the gym experience better overall 
I agree sometimes you need strict rules to keep things in order 

grind out - produce in a mechanical unenthusiastic way 

hey did you finish the report for the meeting tomorrow 
yeah I managed to grind it out last night it wasn't my best work but it's done 
I get it sometimes you just have to push through what was the toughest part 
honestly the data analysis was a real headache I felt like I was just going through the motions 
I can relate when you're not inspired it's hard to do more than just grind out the task 
exactly I wish I had more time to really dig into it but deadlines are deadlines 
true at least it's done we can always improve it later if we need to 
that's a good point maybe we can revisit it next week when things are less hectic 
sounds like a plan let's focus on getting through the meeting first 

hold back - restrain or keep from acting or knowing something 

have you told your family about your travel plans yet 
not yet I've been holding back because I'm not sure how they'll react 
I get that they might be worried but it's important for them to know when are you planning to leave 
next month I just don't want to deal with the stress of their concerns right now 
understandable but holding back might make it harder in the long run maybe ease them into the idea 
you're right I'll probably start by mentioning the benefits of the trip and how I've planned everything out 
that sounds like a good approach they might be more supportive if they see you've thought it through 
exactly I'll talk to them this weekend and try to address their concerns upfront 
good plan it's better to be open about it they'll appreciate your honesty 

use up - consume all of something 

hey do you know where the rest of the printer ink went I was about to print some documents and it looks like we're out 
oh I used up the last of it yesterday there were a ton of forms I needed to print for the meeting next week so sorry I forgot to mention it 
no worries but we should probably order more soon do we have a regular supplier or should I look for a deal online 
we usually order from that online office supply store they deliver pretty quickly maybe check if they have any specials on ink 
sounds good I'll place an order today how many cartridges should I get this time 
maybe get a few extra just to avoid running out against soon especially with the end of the quarter coming up 
agreed I'll order several to keep us stocked up I'll also make sure to track the ink levels regularly now 
great idea let me know if you need the account details for the store 

own up to - admit or confess something 

did you see the news about the project delay 
yeah I did apparently there were some issues with the planning 
I heard it was because someone missed a crucial deadline 
actually I need to own up to that I was the one who missed the deadline 
really what happened 
I underestimated the time needed for one of the tasks and it set everything back 
that's tough it's good of you to own up to it though what are you going to do now 
I've already spoken to the team and we're working on a plan to catch up 
that's a good approach admitting the mistake is the first step to fixing it 
exactly I just hope we can get back on track quickly 

dress up - wear fancy or formal clothes 

so are you excited about the charity gala next weekend 
definitely I love any excuse to dress up and this event sounds fantastic have you decided what you're going to wear 
I'm thinking about wearing that black suit I bought last year it's been hanging in my closet waiting for an occasion like this 
that sounds perfect for a Gala I picked out a navy blue gown it's a bit more formal than what I usually wear but it's nice to go all out sometimes 
absolutely it's not every day we get to wear something really fancy plus it's for a good good cause so that makes it even better 
right the funds go to local art programs right it's great to support the community and have a fun evening out 
exactly it's a win-win looking forward to seeing everyone all dressed up and enjoying the night 
me too it'll be a night to remember for sure 

wash up - clean dishes hands Etc 

did you finish your lunch 
yeah just now I'm about to wash up the kitchen is a bit of a mess 
do you need any help with the dishes 
that would be great thanks there are a few pots and pans that need scrubbing too 
no problem I'll start with the plates did you cook something special today 
just tried out a new pasta recipe it turned out pretty decent I left some in the pot if you want to try 
sounds good I'll definitely have a taste pasta dishes always make for an easier cleanup thankfully 
true except for the sauce pan that one might need a bit more elbow grease 
got it I'll handle the saucepan then it's nice to team up like this makes the task go faster 
absolutely it's always better with some company plus we can get to the dessert quicker this way 

fizzle out - gradually end usually in a disappointing way 

have you been following that new TV series that started last month 
yes I started watching it but I haven't caught up on the latest episodes how's it going 
honestly it started off really strong but the last couple of episodes just seemed to fizzle out 
that's disappointing what happened 
the plot just lost momentum it feels like they're dragging the story out without much happening 
I was worried that might happen after such a dramatic opening do you think it's worth continuing 
maybe give it another episode or two sometimes shows have a midseason slump but pick up again towards the end 
true I'll stick with it a bit longer then it's a shame though I had High Hopes after the first few episodes 
same here hopefully the writers turn things around otherwise it's just another series that had potential but couldn't keep up the pace 
I'll keep my fingers crossed maybe we can discuss it again once the season wraps up 
sounds good let's hope for a strong finish 

tip off secretly inform or warn someone hey just a quick heads up I got tipped off that the main road is completely jammed because of the marathon today you might want to take the back streets oh really that's a great tip thanks I had no idea there was a marathon how did you find out my brother's part of the event organizing team he sent me a message early this morning so I could avoid the area it's going to be chaotic all day good to know I'll reroute and go through Elm Street then did he mention anything about when it might clear up he expects it'll be busy till late afternoon everything should be back to normal by evening perfect I'll plan my day accordingly I really appreciate the warning iron out remove difficulties or find solutions to a problem they tell me that I'm going to make it they me to do something that make sense have you made any progress with planning the reunion a bit but there are still a few issues we need to iron out before everything is set what kind of issues are you facing mainly with the venue and Catering the original venue is double booked and the caterer just informed us they're unavailable on our date that sounds challenging have you found any alternatives we're looking into a couple of other venues nearby as for catering I'm thinking about reaching out to a few local restaurants to see if they can help that could work if you need help contacting places or negotiating let me know thanks I might take you up on that hopefully we can iron out these details soon so we can focus on the fun stuff for sure once the main Logistics are settled the rest should fall into place fall four be deceived by so I heard you bought a car from that online ad how did it go not great actually I think I fell for one of those too good to be true deals oh no what happened the car looked perfect in the pictures and the price was incredibly low I contacted the seller and everything seemed fine until I paid a deposit after that communication just stopped that sounds like a classic scam did you manage to get your money back I've been trying but it's difficult the seller used a fake identity and now I'm going through the process with my bank to see if they can reverse the transaction I'm sorry to hear that it's easy to fall for something when it looks exactly like what you want definitely a lesson learned next time I'll be more cautious and probably insist on seeing the car in person before making any payments yeah that that's a safer approach it's tough out there with all these deceptive ads let me know if you need help sorting it out with your bank key in enter data V keyboard did you finish inputting the data for the survey not yet I still have a few more responses to key in it's taking longer than I thought I can imagine how many responses do you have left about 50 more I've been at it for hours just keying in each response one by one that sounds tedious do you need any help that would be great if you could key in some of the responses it would speed things up a lot sure just show me where to start I can take over for a bit thanks here's the spread sheet just keying the data from these forms got it I'll start with these and see how far I get perfect with your help we should be able to finish much faster queue up line up or arrange in a queue don't want to sleep cuz I got did you manage to get tickets for the concert next month yes I had to queue up online right when they went on sale the website was so busy I thought I might miss out that sounds stressful I'm glad you got them though how long did you have to wait it was about an hour of just refreshing the page and waiting in the digital queue everyone was trying to get the best seats an hour that's dedication I'm impressed it must be a popular band they are and it's their first tour after a long break so the tickets were in high demand it'll be worth it then who are you going with a couple of friends from college we used to listen to this band all the time back then we decided to queue up for tickets together even though we were all on different computers sounds like a mini reunion it's great that you all could coordinate like that yeah we're all looking forward to it should be a memorable night face up to accept and deal with a difficult reality have you talked to your landlord about the rent increase yet not yet I've been trying to avoid it but I know I need to face up to it soon it's tough but the sooner you address it the better what are your options I guess I could try negotiating a smaller increase or look for a cheaper place neither option is ideal though negotiating might be worth a shot Maybe your landlord would be willing to compromise true I'll need to gather some information first like rental prices in the area to make a strong case that sounds like a good plan it shows you're serious and informed yeah I just need to face up to the conversation once I do I'll feel better about whatever happens exactly it's always better to confront these things head on let me know how it goes gear down reduce in speed or intensity I've been thinking about our weekly routine and I feel like we might need to gear down a bit it's been non-stop lately I agree it's been quite hectic with all the activities and commitments we've packed into our schedule what if we limit our evening engagements maybe just one or two nights a week instead of almost every night that sounds like a good plan it would definitely help reduce the overall rush and give us more time to relax exactly we could use that extra time at home to unwind maybe R more or just enjoy some quiet evenings I'd love that it might also be nice to spend more time cooking together instead of always grabbing something on the go perfect let's start this week we can pick the nights we stay out based on what we really don't want to miss and keep the rest free I'm looking forward to this change it'll be a nice Pace adjustment ease into gradually start or adjust to a new situation I heard you started a new job recently how's it going so far it's going well thanks I'm trying to ease into the new role it's a bit different from what I'm used to but I'm getting the hang of it that's good to hear what's the biggest adjustment you've had to make the pace is much faster here I'm used to a more laid-back environment so I've been taking it one step at a time to keep up sounds like a smart approach have your colleagues been supportive yes they've been great they've given me space to ease into things and offered help whenever I need it that makes a big difference do you feel like you're settling in now slowly but surely I think in a few more weeks I'll feel fully comfortable with everything that's good it's important to take your time and not rush the process brush off ignore or dismiss someone or something did you mention the parking issue to the building manager yesterday I did but he just brushed it off said there's nothing they can do about the space limitations right now that's frustrating it's becoming a real problem for everyone here especially on weekends absolutely I suggested maybe marking designated spots or even a rotation system but he didn't seem interested in discussing it further maybe we should bring it up at the next tenants meeting if more people voice their concerns he might take it more seriously good idea a collective approach might make him reconsider it's worth a shot at least yeah let's prepare something for the meeting if we present a wellth thought up plan it'll be harder to ignore agreed we could draft a proposal outlining a few Solutions showing we're proactive about it exactly let's do that we'll gather some feedback from other tenants too to strengthen our case sounds like a plan I'll start reaching out to others this week to get their input add up makes [Applause] sense I just read about that new tech startup some of their claims seem a bit over the top don't you think yeah I saw that too their projected growth numbers I'm not sure how they plan to achieve that so quickly exactly and their business model doesn't fully explain how they'll sustain such rapid expansion doesn't really add up to me right there might be some key details they haven't disclosed yet or maybe it's just optimistic forecasting that could be have you looked into their funding that might give us a better idea of their capabilities they've secured Some solid Venture Capital but even that doesn't seem enough for the scale they're talking about it's a puzzle isn't it we should keep an eye on their next moves it'll be interesting to see if they adjust their strategy once they hit the market definitely watching how new startups navigate these challenges is always insightful we might even learn a thing or two for our own projects agreed it's one thing to have a vision executing it is a whole other challenge we're off fade away have you noticed how quickly the excitement of buying something new wears off absolutely it's like one moment you're thrilled and a week later it just Fades away same thing happened when I got my new phone exactly it's all exciting at first but then it just becomes another thing you own do you think that's why people shop so much probably it's that initial rush but it's interesting how the novelty wears off but the bills don't fade away as quickly that's the truth it makes you wonder if it's worth chasing those moments when The Thrill Is So temporary maybe it's better to find excitement in experiences not things those memories don't fade away as fast I agree next time instead of buying the latest gadget maybe I'll book a little trip somewhere sounds like a plan experiences over possessions right they say that's the key to happiness latch on to attach oneself to an idea or person have you seen the latest documentary on climate change yes I watched it last night it was really eye openening I agree it made me think a lot about our habits same here I've latched onto to the idea of reducing my carbon footprint that's a great initiative what changes are you planning to make I'm starting with simple things like using less plastic and conserving water those are good steps have you thought about any bigger changes yes I'm considering switching to a plant-based diet and using public transport more often that's impressive it's inspiring to see how you've latched on to these ideas thanks I feel like if everyone made small changes it could add up to a big impact absolutely every little bit helps maybe I should latch on to some of those ideas too walk off leave suddenly without explanation did you hear about what happened at the party last night Sarah just walked off without saying anything to anyone really that doesn't sound like her at all did something happen I'm not sure one moment she was there and the next she was gone no one saw her leave or knew why she left so suddenly that's bizarre did anyone try calling her to see if she's okay yeah I called her this morning she didn't give much detail but said she just needed some air and time to think she sounded all right just a bit overwhelmed I guess I hope she's okay maybe the crowd got to be too much it was pretty packed there that's what I was thinking we should probably give her some space for now but maybe in a couple of days we could check in on her see if she wants to talk good idea it's important to support friends especially when they do something out of the ordinary like that clear out remove everything from a place did you hear about the renovation they're planning for the old library downtown no I hadn't what are they doing they're going to completely clear out the inside to modernize it new furniture new technology even new layout it's supposed to make the space more usable for current needs that sounds like a massive project are they preserving any of the old features they plan to keep the exterior as is because of its historical significance but inside it's going to be totally transformed they want to incorporate more Community spaces and Tech friendly areas I guess that makes sense especially to attract younger crowds and keep up with Digital Trends how long will it be closed it'll be closed for about a year they need to clear out all the old shelving and seating first and then start with the tech upgrades and reconfiguration it's going to be worth it though our town could really use a space that caters to a wider audience and Embraces modern needs absolutely I'm looking forward to seeing how it turns out it could really rejuvenate the downtown area join in participate in an activity with others did you hear about the charity run happening next weekend in the park I was thinking about signing up yeah I saw the Flyers it looks like a good cause are you going to join in I'm planning to it supports local schools and I figured it would also be a great way to get a bit of exercise how about you want to run it with me I'm not much of a runner but it does sound like a fun event for a good cause sure I'll join in maybe I can convince a few others from the office to come along that would be fantastic the more the marrier they're also having a picnic afterwards for all the participants and their families a picnic sounds nice it could be a great day out I'll spread the word and see who else might be interested in joining awesome I'll send you the sign up link thanks for deciding to join in it's always more fun to do these things together absolutely thanks for the nudge it'll be good to do something different and help help out the community at the same time
