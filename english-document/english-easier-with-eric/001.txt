Ease off - reduce in intensity

🎧 Have you been following the weather forecast lately
🎧 Yes, I have, it seems like the rain is finally going to ease off this weekend
🎧 That's a relief! It's been raining non-stop for days
🎧 I know, right? I was starting to worry about flooding in some areas
🎧 Me too, but with the rain easing off, we can finally make plans to go hiking!
🎧 That sounds perfect! I've been looking forward to getting outside
🎧 Same here, do you have any particular trails in mind
🎧 I was thinking of trying that new trail near the lake, it's supposed to be really scenic
🎧 That's a great idea! Let's plan for Sunday then
🎧 Sounds good, hopefully the weather will be clear by then
🎧 Fingers crossed! It'll be nice to get some fresh air and sunshine

Fall for - be deceived by

🎧 So I heard you bought a car from that online ad, how did it go
🎧 Not great, actually, I think I fell for one of those too-good-to-be-true deals
🎧 Oh no, what happened
🎧 The car looked perfect in the pictures, and the price was incredibly low. I contacted the seller, and everything seemed fine until I paid a deposit. After that, communication just stopped
🎧 That sounds like a classic scam. Did you manage to get your money back
🎧 I've been trying, but it's difficult. The seller used a fake identity, and now I'm going through the process with my bank to see if they can reverse the transaction
🎧 I'm sorry to hear that. It's easy to fall for something when it looks exactly like what you want
🎧 Definitely a lesson learned. Next time I'll be more cautious and probably insist on seeing the car in person before making any payments
🎧 Yeah, that's a safer approach. It's tough out there with all these deceptive ads. Let me know if you need help sorting it out with your bank

Dial back - reduce or decrease

🎧 I've been thinking about how hectic our weekends have been lately. Maybe we should dial back on some of our plans
🎧 I was thinking the same. It feels like we're always rushing from one event to another without a moment to relax
🎧 Exactly. What if we start by choosing just one main activity per weekend instead of trying to fit three or four
🎧 That sounds like a good approach. It would give us more time to actually enjoy what we're doing and maybe even some downtime at home
🎧 Right. Like this Saturday, instead of going to the market, the park, and that evening show, we could just pick the show or even something simpler
🎧 I'd vote for something outdoors. How about we just plan for a morning hike? We could take a leisurely pace and have a picnic
🎧 That sounds perfect. Let's go with the hike then. It'll be nice to have a more relaxed day for a change

Brush off - ignore or dismiss someone or something

🎧 Did you mention the parking issue to the building manager yesterday
🎧 I did, but he just brushed it off, said there's nothing they can do about the space limitations right now
🎧 That's frustrating. It's becoming a real problem for everyone here, especially on weekends
🎧 Absolutely. I suggested maybe marking designated spots or even a rotation system, but he didn't seem interested in discussing it further
🎧 Maybe we should bring it up at the next tenants meeting. If more people voice their concerns, he might take it more seriously
🎧 Good idea. A collective approach might make him reconsider. It's worth a shot, at least
🎧 Yeah, let's prepare something for the meeting. If we present a well-thought-out plan, it'll be harder to ignore
🎧 Agreed. We could draft a proposal outlining a few solutions, showing we're proactive about it
🎧 Exactly. Let's do that. We'll gather some feedback from other tenants too to strengthen our case
🎧 Sounds like a plan. I'll start reaching out to others this week to get their input

Firm up - make more definite or secure

🎧 Have you thought about our vacation plans for this summer
🎧 Yes, I have. We need to firm up our dates soon
🎧 I agree. We should decide by the end of this week. Have you checked any destinations
🎧 I was thinking about going to the mountains. It's cooler there in the summer
🎧 That sounds great. We should also look at booking some activities
🎧 Definitely. I'll start researching hiking trails and maybe some local tours
🎧 Perfect. We should also firm up our accommodation. Hotels might get booked quickly
🎧 Good point. I'll check some options today and send you the links
🎧 Thanks. We should also consider renting a car for flexibility
🎧 Agreed. Let's make a list of everything we need to firm up before booking
🎧 Sounds like a plan. I'll draft a list and share it with you

Quiet down - become quiet, lighter, or calm down

🎧 Did you hear about the concert in the park this weekend? I'm thinking about going
🎧 Oh, that sounds like fun, but isn't it supposed to be really crowded? These events usually are
🎧 True, but I think it'll quiet down as the evening goes on. Some people just come for the opening acts and leave early
🎧 That's a good point. It might be nice to catch the main performance without the earlier hustle and bustle. Who's playing
🎧 The headliner is that new indie band that's been all over the radio lately. Plus, a couple of local groups are opening for them
🎧 I've heard a few songs from that band. They've got a great sound. Maybe I'll join you. We could grab a spot on the grass as it starts to quiet down
🎧 Perfect. It's settled then. We'll head over in the late afternoon, enjoy the music, and relax. It'll be a nice break from our usual weekends
🎧 Agreed. I'll bring some snacks. It'll be a good change of pace

Iron out - resolve or work out the details

🎧 We really need to iron out the details for our road trip next month
🎧 Definitely. Should we start with the route and stopovers? I think that's the biggest task
🎧 Good idea. We should map out the main stops we want to make and figure out how long we'll stay at each one
🎧 Right. And we should also look into accommodations. I'll research some places where we can stay along the way
🎧 Perfect. And let's not forget about meals and activities. Maybe we can find some interesting spots to eat and explore
🎧 I'll make a list. Also, we need to decide on the budget and how we're splitting costs
🎧 Yes, let's keep everything transparent. We can create a shared document and update it as we go along
🎧 That sounds efficient. Once we have all the information, we can review it together and make any necessary adjustments
🎧 Agreed. It's better to iron out all these issues now rather than deal with surprises on the road

Talk down - speak to someone as if they are inferior

🎧 I was at the electronic store yesterday trying to pick a new laptop, and the salesperson really started talking down to me when I asked about the specs
🎧 Oh no, that's the worst. What did they say
🎧 Well, when I mentioned I was looking for something with a high-performance processor and a solid-state drive, he kind of smirked and said, "Let me find you something easy to use, something more suited for your level."
🎧 That's incredibly condescending. You know your tech. Did you set him straight
🎧 I did. I told him I've been following the latest in tech developments for years and that I probably knew more about their products than he did. I could tell he didn't expect that
🎧 Good for you. It's frustrating how some people assume they need to simplify everything. Did you find a laptop you liked in the end
🎧 Yes, I ended up finding one with the exact specs I wanted, and I made sure to check out with another salesperson

X-ray - examine thoroughly

🎧 I finally took my car to the mechanic because it was making that strange noise again. They had to x-ray the whole engine to find the issue
🎧 X-ray the engine? I didn't know they could do that. What did they find
🎧 Well, not literally x-ray, but they did a thorough scan using some advanced diagnostic tools. Turns out a small part was about to fail inside the gearbox
🎧 That sounds serious. Good thing you got it checked out in time. What's the damage? Are repairs going to be costly
🎧 Thankfully, it's not as bad as it could have been. They can replace the part without having to rebuild the entire gearbox. It's still going to cost a bit, though
🎧 Better than needing a whole new gearbox. It's impressive how they can diagnose these things so precisely now
🎧 Absolutely. The technology they use these days allows them to examine everything so thoroughly. It's like giving the car a full-body scan
🎧 Makes me think I should get my car checked too. Better safe than sorry, right
🎧 Definitely a good idea. Regular checks can save you a lot in the long run

Act on - take action because of information or advice

🎧 I got an interesting tip from a friend about a new investment opportunity
🎧 Really? What's it about
🎧 It's about investing in renewable energy stocks. They've been performing well lately
🎧 That sounds promising. Are you planning to act on that advice
🎧 I'm considering it. I need to do a bit more research first. Have you heard anything about these stocks
🎧 Yes, I've read some articles saying they're a good long-term investment. It might be a good idea to act on it sooner rather than later
🎧 That's what I'm thinking. I just want to make sure I'm making an informed decision
🎧 Definitely. Maybe we could look into it together and share what we find
🎧 That's a great idea. Let's meet up this weekend and go through the information
🎧 Sounds like a plan

Kick around - Discuss informally

🎧 Have you thought anymore about the idea we were kicking around last week?
🎧 You mean the community garden project? Yeah, I've been thinking about it a lot. It could really bring people together.
🎧 Absolutely. I was thinking we could start by hosting a meeting to gather interest, see who else wants to get involved.
🎧 That's a good plan. We should also kick around some ideas for possible locations. Do you have any in mind?
🎧 There's that vacant lot near the library. It's been unused for years and gets plenty of sunlight.
🎧 That's a great spot. We'd need to get permission from the city, though. Should we kick around how we might present this to the council?
🎧 Sure, we could put together a proposal outlining the benefits like community engagement and fresh produce.
🎧 And we could include some success stories from other community gardens. It might help persuade them.
🎧 Good idea. Let's also think about potential sponsors. Local businesses might be willing to support us.
🎧 Yes, especially if we offer to feature them in any publicity. This is really coming together. We should set a date for our first meeting.
🎧 Agreed. I'll draft an announcement and we can start spreading the word.

Weigh in - Give an opinion or enter a discussion

🎧 Have you seen the new policy changes they're proposing in our community newsletter?
🎧 I skimmed through it, but I haven't gone into the details yet. What's it about?
🎧 They're considering implementing stricter parking regulations around Main Street. I think it might be a bit too restrictive.
🎧 Oh, that could be tricky for people who visit the shops there. What's their reasoning?
🎧 It's mainly to reduce congestion and make the area safer for pedestrians. I see their point, but I'm not sure it's the best approach.
🎧 Maybe they could introduce a permit system instead. That way, residents and shop owners aren't negatively impacted.
🎧 That's a good idea. Do you think we should weigh in on this? Maybe write a joint response?
🎧 Definitely. We should offer some alternatives. It's important to get involved, especially if it affects us directly.
🎧 Agreed. Let's draft something this weekend. I'll gather some more feedback from the neighbors too.
🎧 Perfect. I'll look into some other cities' policies and see if we can find a better solution.

Hold up - Delay or rob

🎧 Did you hear why the meeting started so late today?
🎧 Yeah, apparently there was a traffic accident that held everyone up.
🎧 That explains it. I thought something serious happened.
🎧 It was just a minor fender bender, but it caused a huge traffic jam.
🎧 I see. It's good that no one was hurt. By the way, did you hear about the bank robbery downtown?
🎧 No, I didn't. What happened?
🎧 Someone held up the bank yesterday afternoon. They got away with a lot of money.
🎧 That's crazy. Do they have any leads on who did it?
🎧 Not yet. The police are still investigating, but the robbers wore masks, so it's hard to identify them.
🎧 I hope they catch them soon. It's scary to think something like that could happen here.
🎧 Definitely. We need to stay alert.

Invite over - Ask someone to come to your home

🎧 Hey, are you free this Saturday evening? I was thinking of having a small get-together at my place.
🎧 That sounds like fun. What's the occasion?
🎧 No special occasion really. I just thought it would be nice to invite everyone over, catch up, and spend some time together. It's been a while since we all hung out.
🎧 You're right, it has been too long. Who else are you inviting over?
🎧 Just the usual gang. I'll make some appetizers, and we can play some games, maybe even watch a movie later in the evening.
🎧 Perfect. Do you need me to bring anything? Drinks? Snacks?
🎧 If you could bring some drinks, that would be great. I've got the food covered, but more drinks are always a good idea.
🎧 Consider it done. I'll bring a mix of sodas and some wine. Does that work?
🎧 That's perfect, thanks. It's going to be a relaxed evening, just what we all need.
🎧 Looking forward to it. Thanks for inviting me over. I'll see you Saturday then.
🎧 Great! See you Saturday.

Reach out - Attempt to contact or communicate

🎧 Have you heard from Sarah recently?
🎧 No, it's been a while. I was thinking I should reach out to her. We used to hang out all the time.
🎧 That's a good idea. I've been meaning to do the same. Maybe we can plan a get-together.
🎧 Definitely. She's probably busy with work, but I'm sure she'd appreciate it if we reached out.
🎧 How about we send her a message today and see if she's free this weekend?
🎧 Sounds perfect. We can suggest meeting for coffee or lunch, something casual to catch up.
🎧 I'll draft a message and include both of us. She'll love hearing from us.
🎧 Great! It'll be nice to reconnect. I miss our old group outings.
🎧 Me too. Let's make it a regular thing if she's up for it.
🎧 Absolutely. Reaching out more often will help keep our friendship strong.

Smooth over - Make problems seem less serious

🎧 Did you hear about the argument at Mark's party last night?
🎧 Yeah, I heard bits and pieces. What exactly happened?
🎧 Apparently, there was a misunderstanding between Jane and Tom. Things got heated pretty quickly.
🎧 That's unfortunate. Did anyone try to smooth things over?
🎧 Mark did. He stepped in and calmed them both down. He's good at making problems seem less serious.
🎧 That's good to hear. Mark's always been great at diffusing tense situations.
🎧 Yeah, he managed to get them talking and understanding each other's perspective. It ended on a much better note.
🎧 Glad to hear it. I was worried it might have ruined the party for everyone.
🎧 It could have, but Mark's intervention really helped smooth things over. By the end, everyone was enjoying themselves again.
🎧 That's a relief. I'll check in with Jane and Tom later, just to make sure they're okay.
🎧 Good idea. A little follow-up never hurts.

Whip up - Prepare quickly

🎧 Hey, I was thinking about inviting some friends over tonight. Do you have any ideas for what we could serve?
🎧 Sure, we can whip up some quick appetizers. How about a platter with cheese, crackers, and some fresh fruit?
🎧 That sounds good. What about something a bit more substantial?
🎧 We could also whip up a batch of mini sandwiches. They're quick to make and always a hit.
🎧 Great idea. Do you think we need anything sweet?
🎧 Absolutely. We could whip up some brownies or cookies. They're easy and everyone loves them.
🎧 Perfect. Do we have everything we need, or should we make a quick trip to the store?
🎧 Let me check. I think we might need more cheese and some chocolate chips for the brownies.
🎧 All right, let's make a quick shopping list and head out.

Barge in - Enter rudely or abruptly

🎧 Did you hear about the new café that opened downtown?
🎧 Yes, I did. It seems like everyone is talking about it. Have you been there yet?
🎧 Not yet, but I'm planning to go this weekend. I heard they have amazing pastries.
🎧 I love pastries. Maybe I'll check it out too. By the way, did you finish the report for our project?
🎧 Almost. I just need to add a few more details. How about you?
🎧 I'm done with mine. Oh, speaking of the café, I heard they have a live band playing on weekends.
🎧 That sounds fun. Maybe we can go together.
🎧 Sure, why not? Oh, remember last week when that guy barged in during our meeting?
🎧 Yeah, that was so unexpected. He didn't even apologize.
🎧 Some people have no manners. Anyway, let's plan for the café this Saturday.

Key in - Enter data via keyboard

🎧 Did you finish inputting the data for the survey?
🎧 Not yet. I still have a few more responses to key in. It's taking longer than I thought.
🎧 I can imagine. How many responses do you have left?
🎧 About 50 more. I've been at it for hours, just keying in each response one by one.
🎧 That sounds tedious. Do you need any help?
🎧 That would be great if you could key in some of the responses. It would speed things up a lot.
🎧 Sure, just show me where to start. I can take over for a bit.
🎧 Thanks. Here's the spreadsheet. Just key in the data from these forms.
🎧 Got it! I'll start with these and see how far I get.
🎧 Perfect. With your help, we should be able to finish much faster.

Catch up with - Reach someone ahead of you

🎧 I heard you've started running in the mornings. How's that going?
🎧 It's been good. I'm actually trying to catch up with Jenna's pace. She's been at it for years and is super fast now.
🎧 Jenna is quite the athlete. Catching up with her will definitely be a challenge.
🎧 Yeah, she runs like the wind, but it's a good target to aim for. It keeps me motivated.
🎧 Have you thought about joining any local races? That might give you an extra push.
🎧 I'm considering it. There's a 5k next month that Jenna mentioned. Maybe running the same race will help me gauge how much I've improved.
🎧 That sounds like a perfect opportunity. Plus, the competitive environment could really spur you on.
🎧 Exactly. I plan to sign up this week. Hopefully, I'll start closing the gap soon.
🎧 You're on the right track. Keep pushing, and you'll be at her level before you know it.

Die down - Decrease in intensity or volume

🎧 Have you noticed how the traffic has finally started to die down around here?
🎧 Yes, it's been a relief. During the construction last month, it was unbearable. How's the noise been on your end?
🎧 Much better now. The constant honking and engine noises have definitely decreased. It's quieter in the mornings, especially.
🎧 That's good to hear. I think they finished the major parts of the roadwork, so the worst should be over now.
🎧 I hope so. It was disrupting my work-from-home routine. I couldn't concentrate with all that noise.
🎧 Same here. Plus, it used to take me an extra 30 minutes just to get through that one congested area. It's nice to see things returning to normal.
🎧 Definitely. It's about time things started to settle down. Have you been using the new route now that the main road is clearer?
🎧 Yes, it's actually much faster. It seems like many haven't caught on yet, so it's less crowded too.
🎧 I'll have to try that then. Anything to avoid a repeat of last month's chaos.

Flake out - Fail to follow through or appear, also fall asleep

🎧 Did you go to Emily's party last night?
🎧 No, I planned to, but I completely flaked out. I fell asleep on the couch.
🎧 Really? That's too bad. It was a great party. Everyone was asking about you.
🎧 I know. I feel awful about it. I just got home from work and meant to rest for a bit, but I ended up flaking out.
🎧 It happens. You must have been really tired.
🎧 Yeah, it's been a busy week. Did I miss anything exciting?
🎧 A lot of people showed up, and there was live music. Emily even made a big announcement.
🎧 What was the announcement?
🎧 She's moving to New York for a new job.
🎧 Wow, that's huge. I really wish I hadn't flaked out.
🎧 Don't worry. We can catch up with her before she leaves.

Opt for - Choose one thing over others

🎧 So, what are you thinking for dinner tonight? There's a new Thai place that just opened up down the street.
🎧 Thai sounds good, but didn't you mention that sushi spot near the park last week? We could check that out instead.
🎧 True. I've heard good things about it, but I'm really in the mood for something spicy tonight. The Thai place is supposed to have the best curry in town.
🎧 Well, we had Japanese just last week, didn't we? Maybe it's better to try something different this time. Plus, a good curry does sound tempting.
🎧 All right, let's opt for the Thai place then. It'll be nice to try something new, and a little spice might be just what we need to liven up the week.
🎧 Agreed. I'll make a reservation. Maybe we can walk around the neighborhood after dinner too.

Hone in - Focus or concentrate on something

🎧 Have you started planning your vacation yet?
🎧 Not really. I'm trying to hone in on a destination first.
🎧 Any ideas so far? I'm torn between the mountains and the beach. Both sound appealing.
🎧 I understand. What are you looking for in a vacation?
🎧 I'm looking for relaxation, but also a bit of adventure. That's why it's hard to hone in on one place.
🎧 Have you considered a place that offers both, like a coastal town near the mountains?
🎧 That's a good idea. I hadn't thought of that. It would let me have the best of both worlds.
🎧 Exactly. You can relax by the sea and then go hiking or exploring in the mountains.
🎧 I'll definitely look into that. It might be just what I need.
🎧 Let me know what you decide. It sounds exciting.

Join in - Participate in an activity with others

🎧 Did you hear about the charity run happening next weekend in the park? I was thinking about signing up.
🎧 Yeah, I saw the flyers. It looks like a good cause. Are you going to join in?
🎧 I'm planning to. It supports local schools, and I figured it would also be a great way to get a bit of exercise. How about you? Want to run it with me?
🎧 I'm not much of a runner, but it does sound like a fun event for a good cause. Sure, I'll join in. Maybe I can convince a few others from the office to come along.
🎧 That would be fantastic! The more the merrier. They're also having a picnic afterward for all the participants and their families.
🎧 A picnic sounds nice. It could be a great day out. I'll spread the word and see who else might be interested in joining.
🎧 Awesome! I'll send you the sign-up link. Thanks for deciding to join in. It's always more fun to do these things together.
🎧 Absolutely! Thanks for the nudge. It'll be good to do something different and help out the community at the same time.

Bail out - Rescue from financial difficulties

🎧 I heard Tom's business is struggling. Have you talked to him lately?
🎧 Yes, I spoke with him yesterday. He's in quite a bit of financial trouble.
🎧 That's tough. Is there anything we can do to help?
🎧 He mentioned that he might need someone to bail him out. He's looking for investors to keep the business afloat.
🎧 Do you think it's a good idea to get involved?
🎧 It could be, but we'd need to look at his business plan first. If we decide to bail him out, we should make sure it's a sound investment.
🎧 Agreed. Maybe we can meet with him and discuss the details.
🎧 That's a good idea. We can get a clearer picture and decide if we want to bail him out.
🎧 Let's set up a meeting soon. I'll call him and arrange it.

Yell out - Shout or exclaim loudly

🎧 Did you hear that noise outside just now?
🎧 Yeah, I did. Sounded like someone was yelling out. Maybe someone's celebrating.
🎧 Could be, or maybe they need help. It was pretty loud and sudden.
🎧 True. Should we check it out? It came from the park across the street, right?
🎧 Yes, let's go see. Better safe than sorry. Plus, I could use a quick walk.
🎧 I'll grab my jacket. The weather's turned chilly, hasn't it?
🎧 Definitely has. I'm just hoping everything's okay. It's not like our neighborhood to have such loud disturbances.
🎧 Absolutely. I'll bring a flashlight too. It's getting dark earlier these days.
🎧 Good thinking. Let's be quick, though. If it's just a celebration, we shouldn't intrude for too long.
🎧 Agreed. If someone's in trouble, though, we'll be right there to help out.

Walk off - Leave suddenly without explanation

🎧 Did you hear about what happened at the party last night? Sarah just walked off without saying anything to anyone.
🎧 Really? That doesn't sound like her at all. Did something happen?
🎧 I'm not sure. One moment she was there, and the next she was gone. No one saw her leave or knew why she left so suddenly.
🎧 That's bizarre. Did anyone try calling her to see if she's okay?
🎧 Yeah, I called her this morning. She didn't give much detail but said she just needed some air and time to think. She sounded all right, just a bit overwhelmed, I guess.
🎧 I hope she's okay. Maybe the crowd got to be too much. It was pretty packed there.
🎧 That's what I was thinking. We should probably give her some space for now, but maybe in a couple of days we could check in on her to see if she wants to talk.
🎧 Good idea. It's important to support friends, especially when they do something out of the ordinary like that.

Double up - Share something intended for one person with another

🎧 Hey, did you know the new office policy now allows us to double up on hotel rooms during conferences? They're trying to cut down on travel expenses.
🎧 Really? Doubling up on hotel rooms? That could be a bit awkward depending on who you end up sharing with.
🎧 I had the same thought. They did mention that rooming assignments would be voluntary, so you can choose to share with someone you're comfortable with or opt out and pay the difference for a single room.
🎧 That's a relief. It's a good way to save money, I guess. Plus, it might make the trip more enjoyable if you're rooming with a friend.
🎧 Exactly. And it's not just about saving money—they're also framing it as a team-building opportunity. You know, more time to connect with colleagues in a less formal setting.
🎧 I can see the benefit in that. Maybe we should pair up for the next conference. We'd probably have a great time.
🎧 I'm in! It'll double the fun and halve the cost. Let's let HR know we're pairing up.

Play up - Emphasize or exaggerate

🎧 I just got back from the car dealership. You wouldn't believe the sales pitch I got today.
🎧 Oh, do tell. Was it the usual spiel or something out of the ordinary?
🎧 They were really playing up the features of the latest model. I mean, the car does have some nice upgrades, but the way they talked about the onboard technology was as if it could drive itself.
🎧 That's salespeople for you—always making things sound more revolutionary than they are. Did you end up liking the car, though?
🎧 I liked it, yes. It's sleek and drives smoothly, but with how they were pushing it, I felt like I was buying a spaceship, not a sedan.
🎧 Sounds like they know how to make an impression. Are you thinking about going for it, or are you looking at other options?
🎧 I'm considering it. The car's good, but I need to do a bit more research. I don't want to make a decision based solely on an exaggerated sales pitch.
🎧 Smart move. Take your time, and maybe you'll find something even better without all the hype.

Knockout - Defeat or overwhelm

🎧 Did you watch the boxing match last night?
🎧 Yes, I did. That knockout in the final round was unexpected.
🎧 Absolutely. I thought it was going to go the distance. The champion really knocked out the challenger with that last punch.
🎧 It was a stunning end. I read that it was considered one of the fastest knockouts in championship history.
🎧 Yeah, the precision was remarkable. Also, the way he managed to maintain his composure throughout the fight and then deliver such a powerful blow—truly professional.
🎧 Agreed. It's not just about the strength but also strategy and timing. Speaking of which, do you practice any martial arts yourself?
🎧 I used to do karate a few years back. It's a great way to stay fit and learn discipline. What about you?
🎧 I've been thinking about starting. After watching last night's match, I'm totally knocked out by the idea of learning those skills.
🎧 You should go for it. It's challenging but very rewarding. Maybe it'll be you in the ring someday.
🎧 Who knows? For now, I'll start with the basics.

Bear out - Confirm the truth

🎧 Did you hear back about the results from that study on climate change?
🎧 Yes, I did. The predictions about rising sea levels were actually borne out. The data confirmed what many scientists have been warning about for years.
🎧 That's alarming, yet somehow not surprising. It's a pity that such studies only confirm the dire situation rather than pointing to a slowdown in these trends.
🎧 Exactly. It seems like each new study just continues to bear out the previous findings, no matter how much we hope for different results.
🎧 What do you think it will take for more decisive action to be taken?
🎧 It'll require overwhelming public demand and possibly more immediate impacts that affect a broader range of areas. Unfortunately, as these studies bear out the predictions, it might just be what pushes people to finally act.
🎧 Let's hope it doesn't get to the worst before we start seeing some real changes.
🎧 Agreed. Sometimes confirming the truth isn't enough—it needs to translate into action.
