[033] Please

🎧 Can you pass me the salt, please?
🎧 Sure, here you go.
🎧 Thanks! Oh, and could you also hand me the pepper, please?
🎧 Of course, here it is.
🎧 Thanks again! Could you please pass me the water?
🎧 No problem, here's the water.
🎧 Please, could you also pass the napkins?
🎧 Sure thing, here are the napkins.
🎧 Thank you, and one last thing, could you please pass me the bread?
🎧 Here you go, enjoy!
🎧 Thanks a lot, that's all I needed.
🎧 You're welcome! If you need anything else, just let me know.
🎧 Will do, thanks again.
🎧 Please, don't mention it. Just happy to help.

[034] What Are You Up To

🎧 What are you up to?
🎧 Just finished work, heading home now.
🎧 Long day?
🎧 Yeah, pretty hectic. How about you?
🎧 Just got back from the gym, feeling exhausted.
🎧 I hear you, need some relaxation time then.
🎧 Definitely! Thinking of ordering some takeout and binge-watching Netflix.
🎧 Sounds like a plan. Any recommendations?
🎧 I've been hooked on that new series everyone's talking about.
🎧 Oh yeah? What's it called?
🎧 The Crown, it's really good.
🎧 I've heard about it, maybe I'll give it a shot tonight.
🎧 You should, it's worth it.
🎧 All right, I'll check it out. Thanks for the tip!
🎧 No problem. Anyway, I won't keep you. Enjoy your evening!
🎧 Thanks, you too. Take care!

[035] It's Worth a Shot

🎧 I've been thinking about asking for a promotion at work, but I'm not sure if it's the right time.
🎧 Well, if you feel you've put in the effort and have the qualifications, it's worth a shot.
🎧 Yeah, I've been taking on more responsibilities and achieving my targets consistently.
🎧 Then go for it, you never know unless you try.
🎧 I'm just worried about how my manager will react. What if they say no?
🎧 Don't let fear hold you back. If you don't ask, you never know what could have happened. Besides, even if they say no this time, it might pave the way for future opportunities.
🎧 That's a good point. I'll gather my achievements and set up a meeting with my manager. It's worth a shot.
🎧 That's the spirit! Take the initiative and who knows, it might pay off.

[036] That's a Tough One

🎧 Hey, I've been thinking about whether I should take that job offer in another city. It's a great opportunity, but I'm worried about leaving my family behind.
🎧 That's a tough one. On one hand, the job could be a game-changer for your career, but family is important too.
🎧 Yeah, exactly. I don't want to regret not taking the chance, but I also don't want to miss out on important moments with my loved ones.
🎧 Have you talked to your family about it? Maybe they have some insights or suggestions.
🎧 I haven't yet, but that's a good idea. It's just hard to make a decision when there are so many factors to consider.
🎧 It's a big decision for sure. Take your time, weigh the pros and cons, and listen to your heart. Ultimately, you'll figure out what's best for you.

[037] I'm Going to a Party

🎧 I'm going to a party this Friday.
🎧 Nice! Whose party is it?
🎧 It's a coworker's birthday. She's renting out a space downtown.
🎧 That sounds like fun. Are a lot of people from work going?
🎧 Yeah, quite a few. It's been a while since we all got together like this.
🎧 I bet it'll be a good break from the usual. What are you thinking of wearing?
🎧 I'm not sure yet, maybe something casual but nice. It's not super formal.
🎧 Sounds like a good choice. Are you taking anything with you, like a gift or something?
🎧 I was thinking of getting her a gift card, maybe to her favorite store or a nice restaurant.
🎧 That's thoughtful, she'll appreciate that.
🎧 I hope so. What about you, any plans this weekend?
🎧 Not yet, but hearing about your party is making me want to make some. Maybe I'll see what else is happening around town.
🎧 Definitely should! Let me know if you find something interesting.
🎧 Will do. Have a great time at the party!

[038] Do You Want to Hang Out

🎧 Do you want to hang out?
🎧 Sure, I'm down. What did you have in mind?
🎧 How about grabbing some lunch at that new place downtown?
🎧 Sounds good. What time?
🎧 Around 12:30.
🎧 Works for me, I'll meet you there.
🎧 Great! Anything you're in the mood for?
🎧 Not really, I'm open to anything.
🎧 All right, we'll figure it out when we get there.
🎧 Perfect. After lunch, do you want to catch a movie or something?
🎧 Actually, I was thinking we could go for a hike. The weather's nice today.
🎧 That sounds even better. Which trail were you thinking?
🎧 Maybe the one by the lake, it's scenic.
🎧 Sounds like a plan. Should we bring anything?
🎧 Just some water and maybe a snack.
🎧 Got it. Looking forward to it!
🎧 Me too. See you at 12:30 then.
🎧 See you there!

[039] Sibling Disputes

🎧 What's going on, guys? I can hear you arguing from the other room.
🎧 It's nothing, Mom. Just a stupid argument with my sister.
🎧 He started it! He took my phone without asking.
🎧 Hold on, let's take a deep breath and talk this out calmly. Son, did you take your sister's phone without permission?
🎧 Yeah, but I just wanted to use it for a minute.
🎧 Taking something without asking is not okay, son. You need to respect your sister's belongings.
🎧 And he never gives it back when I ask!
🎧 All right, let's find a solution here. Son, you need to ask before borrowing anything from your sister.
🎧 Okay, I'm sorry. I'll remember next time.
🎧 And daughter, try to communicate calmly when you want something back. Yelling won't solve anything.
🎧 Okay, I'll try.
🎧 Remember, you two are siblings and you need to treat each other with respect and kindness.

[040] How's Your Job

🎧 How's your job?
🎧 It's been going all right, just the usual grind, you know.
🎧 Yeah, I hear you. Anything new happening at work?
🎧 Not really, just the same projects and deadlines.
🎧 Have you been enjoying it, though?
🎧 It has its moments, but it can get stressful at times.
🎧 I understand. Do you have any upcoming projects you're excited about?
🎧 Not particularly, just trying to get through the current workload.
🎧 Fair enough. Have you thought about any career developments or changes?
🎧 I've been considering it, but nothing concrete yet.
🎧 Well, if you ever need advice or help with that, feel free to reach out.
🎧 Thanks, I appreciate it. How about you? How's your job going?
🎧 It's been good, actually. I've been working on some interesting projects lately.
🎧 That's great to hear. Glad things are going well for you.
🎧 Thanks. Hopefully, things will continue to improve for both of us.
🎧 Definitely. Here's to better opportunities ahead!

[041] Homework Help

🎧 All right, who needs help with homework first?
🎧 I do, Mom! I'm struggling with my math assignment.
🎧 I'll help you with that, buddy. Let's sit down together and go through the problems.
🎧 Can you help me with my history essay after you're done with him, Dad?
🎧 Of course, sweetie. We'll tackle it together. What's the topic?
🎧 The Industrial Revolution. I'm having trouble understanding the impact it had on society.
🎧 Well, you two work on that, and I'll help your sister with her science project. She needs to prepare a presentation on renewable energy sources.
🎧 Thanks, Mom. I appreciate it.
🎧 All right, son. Let's start with these math problems. Remember, take it step by step and don't hesitate to ask questions.
🎧 And for you, daughter, let's gather some research materials for your history essay. Understanding the context is key to crafting a strong argument.
🎧 Thanks, Mom. I feel better knowing you're here to guide me.

[042] Cut Back On (Reduce the Amount or Frequency of Something)

🎧 I noticed you've been working late every day. Don't you think it's time to cut back on your hours a bit?
🎧 Yeah, I know. It's just that we're facing tight deadlines, and I want to ensure everything is on track.
🎧 I understand the importance of meeting deadlines, but your health is crucial too. You need to cut back on the long hours before it takes a toll on you.
🎧 You're right. I'll try to cut back on the overtime starting next week. It's just been a hectic period.
🎧 Speaking of hectic, have you thought about cutting back on your caffeine intake? I heard it can negatively impact your sleep.
🎧 I've considered it, but with the workload, I rely on coffee to stay alert. Maybe I can cut back on other sources of caffeine.
🎧 Small changes can make a big difference. Cutting back on caffeine and getting enough rest will help you maintain a healthier work-life balance.
🎧 I appreciate your concern. I'll make an effort to cut back on both overtime and caffeine. It's time for a healthier routine.
🎧 Good to hear. Remember, it's crucial to cut back on stress and prioritize your wellbeing.

[043] Visiting the Museum

🎧 I am going to the museum.
🎧 I'm going to a museum this afternoon.
🎧 Oh, nice. Which one are you visiting?
🎧 The City Art Museum. They've got a new exhibit on impressionist painters.
🎧 That sounds interesting. I love impressionist art. What pieces are they featuring?
🎧 They've got a few Monets and a couple of pieces by Degas. There's also a special section for lesser-known artists from that period.
🎧 Sounds like a well-rounded exhibit. Do they have any interactive sections?
🎧 Yes, they've set up a studio where you can try your hand at painting with impressionist techniques. I'm thinking about joining in.
🎧 That's really cool. Makes the experience more immersive. How long is the exhibit running?
🎧 Until the end of next month. You should definitely check it out if you have time.
🎧 I think I will. Maybe we could go together one weekend.
🎧 Absolutely! Let's plan for that. It'd be fun to go with someone who appreciates the art.
🎧 Agreed. Enjoy your visit today!

[044] It Was Nice Meeting You

🎧 It was nice meeting you.
🎧 Yeah, I enjoyed our conversation. Hopefully, we'll run into each other again soon.
🎧 Definitely. Are you usually around this area?
🎧 I am, actually. I come to this cafe pretty often to work. It's quiet, and the coffee is good.
🎧 Good to know. I just moved into the neighborhood, so I'm still figuring out the best spots.
🎧 Well, you've found one of them. If you need any more recommendations, just ask.
🎧 I might take you up on that. It's always a bit overwhelming trying to settle into a new place.
🎧 For sure. What brought you to this area?
🎧 New job downtown. It's a bit of a commute, but this seemed like a good balance between city and suburbs.
🎧 Makes sense. Well, if you ever want to grab a coffee or need some tips on commuting, let me know.
🎧 Thanks, I appreciate it. I'll see you around then.

[045] Family Decision Making

🎧 All right, everyone, we need to make a decision about our upcoming vacation. Any ideas?
🎧 I was thinking we could go to the beach. It's been a while since we've had a relaxing beach vacation.
🎧 But what about going camping instead? I really enjoyed our last camping trip, and it would be a great opportunity to disconnect from technology.
🎧 How about we compromise and find a destination that offers both beach and camping activities? That way, we all get to do something we enjoy.
🎧 That's a good suggestion. Let's look into destinations that offer both options.
🎧 I like that idea. It would be nice to have a variety of activities to choose from.
🎧 Yeah, and we could try new things together as a family.
🎧 All right, let's start researching destinations that fit what we're looking for. We'll make a list of options and then vote on our favorite.
🎧 Sounds like a plan. We'll make this decision as a family.

[046] I'm at a Loss for Words

🎧 Did you hear about the surprise party we threw for Sarah last night?
🎧 No, I had no idea. How did it go?
🎧 Well, it was a disaster. The cake collapsed, and the entertainment canceled last minute.
🎧 That sounds like a nightmare. How did Sarah react?
🎧 Surprisingly, she took it all in stride and thanked us for the effort. I'm at a loss for words.
🎧 That's incredible. She must be really understanding.
🎧 Yeah, she handled it much better than we expected. We'll definitely make it up to her.
🎧 I'm sure she appreciates the thought, even if things didn't go as planned.
🎧 True, but I still can't believe how well she took it. She's one in a million.
🎧 Absolutely. Some people just have a knack for grace under pressure.

[047] Take On (Accept a Responsibility or Challenge)

🎧 Hey, I heard you're considering the new project at work. Are you going to take it on?
🎧 Yeah, I've been thinking about it. It's a bit challenging, but I'm ready to take on more responsibilities. It's a great opportunity to showcase my skills.
🎧 That's a big step. Are you confident about managing the extra workload?
🎧 I believe so. I've been looking for a chance to take on a more leadership role, and this project seems like the perfect opportunity. It's time to step up and prove myself.
🎧 I admire your enthusiasm. Taking on new challenges can be a game-changer for your career.
🎧 Absolutely. I think it's important to keep pushing ourselves to grow. Taking on this project might be demanding, but I'm ready to face it head-on.
🎧 Well, I have no doubt you'll do great. Let me know if you need any support along the way.

[048] I Need Your Help

🎧 I need your help.
🎧 Of course. What do you need assistance with?
🎧 I have a presentation due tomorrow, but my laptop just crashed and I lost all my files.
🎧 That sounds stressful. Do you have any backups?
🎧 Unfortunately, no. I didn't think it would crash like this.
🎧 All right, let's see what we can salvage. Do you have any notes or drafts saved elsewhere?
🎧 I have some printed notes and rough sketches, but the final slides are all gone.
🎧 Let's start by recreating the slides from your printed notes. I'll help you format them.
🎧 Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.
🎧 No problem. We'll make it work. Once we get the basic structure down, we can fine-tune it together.
🎧 Okay, let's get started. I'll go grab those printed notes.

[049] Bring About (Cause or Make Something Happen)

🎧 The recent policy changes in the company are quite significant. What do you think about these shifts, Brad?
🎧 I believe it's a response to the evolving market trends. The industry has been changing rapidly, and the company needed to adapt.
🎧 It's interesting how external factors can bring about internal changes. Do you think the employees are prepared for this?
🎧 Well, the management has been communicating the reasons behind the changes, so I think most people understand what's bringing about these shifts.
🎧 Communication is key in times of change. Do you think this will bring about positive outcomes for the company?
🎧 It's hard to say for sure, but if the changes are implemented effectively, they could bring about increased efficiency and competitiveness.
🎧 True, change can be challenging, but if managed well, it can bring about positive transformation.
🎧 Exactly. The key is to keep everyone informed and involved in the process. That way, the changes are more likely to bring about success rather than resistance.
🎧 Well, I hope the company can navigate these changes smoothly and bring about positive results for everyone involved.

[050] Fall Behind (Fail to Keep Up with a Schedule or Competition)

🎧 How's your coursework going this semester?
🎧 Not so well. I've been falling behind in a couple of classes. The workload is overwhelming.
🎧 Falling behind can happen, especially with a heavy workload. Have you considered talking to your professors about it?
🎧 I haven't yet. I'm worried they'll think I can't handle it, but falling behind is stressing me out.
🎧 Professors are usually understanding if you communicate early on. It's better than falling behind and trying to catch up later.
🎧 You're right. I'll email them today and explain the situation. Hopefully, they can offer some guidance.
🎧 That's a good plan. Falling behind can be discouraging, but taking proactive steps to catch up is crucial.
🎧 On another note, how's your training for the marathon going?
🎧 I was doing well, but recently I've been falling behind my training schedule. Work has been demanding.
🎧 Falling behind in marathon training can be tough to make up for. Maybe consider adjusting your schedule to avoid falling too far behind.
🎧 Yeah, I need to find a balance. Falling behind in both work and training isn't sustainable.
🎧 Agreed. Prioritize and communicate, whether it's with professors or in your personal goals. It helps prevent falling behind in the first place.

[051] What's Happening

🎧 What's happening?
🎧 Not much, just hanging out. You?
🎧 Same here. Anything interesting going on lately?
🎧 Well, I'm planning a trip to the mountains next month.
🎧 That sounds exciting. What are you going to do there?
🎧 Just some hiking and camping. Need a break from the city.
🎧 I hear you. It's good to get away once in a while.
🎧 Definitely. How about you? Any plans for the weekend?
🎧 Not really, just going to catch up on some reading and maybe see a movie.
🎧 Sounds relaxing. Which movie are you planning to watch?
🎧 Thinking of checking out the new thriller that just came out.
🎧 Nice. Let me know how it is.
🎧 Will do. Hey, did you hear about the new restaurant that opened downtown?
🎧 No, I haven't. What's it called?
🎧 Saver and Spice. They serve gourmet dishes from around the world.
🎧 Sounds delicious. We should check it out sometime.
🎧 Definitely. I'll let you know when I'm free.
🎧 Sounds good.

[052] Turn out to be (end up being a particular way)

🎧 So, how was the party last night? I couldn't make it.
🎧 It turned out to be more fun than I expected. The music was great, and a lot of people showed up.
🎧 Really? I thought it might be a big old oh.
🎧 Yeah, I thought so too at first, but it turned out to be a fantastic night. There were some unexpected surprises!
🎧 Surprises? What happened?
🎧 Well, we started playing games, and it turned out to be a lot of fun. I didn't expect everyone to get so into it.
🎧 That's great to hear. I regret missing it now.
🎧 Don't worry, there's always next time. You should definitely come to the next one.
🎧 Oh, I will for sure! It's funny how things can turn out to be different from what we anticipate.
🎧 Absolutely. Sometimes the most ordinary events turn out to be the most memorable ones.

[053] Do you have any outlets I can use to charge my phone?

🎧 Hey, do you have any outlets I can use to charge my phone?
🎧 Yeah, there's one over there by the window. You'll probably need to move the chair a bit to get to it.
🎧 Thanks, I really appreciate it. My phone's been on the brink of dying for the last hour.
🎧 No problem at all. It happens to the best of us. Do you have your charger with you, or do you need to borrow one?
🎧 I've got my charger, thanks. Just didn't see any free spots when I walked in.
🎧 Yeah, this place can get pretty packed. They really should put in more outlets.
🎧 Definitely. It's tough finding a spot to recharge, literally and figuratively, huh?
🎧 Exactly. If you need anything else, just let me know. I'm here quite often, so I know the ins and outs pretty well.
🎧 Will do. Thanks again for your help.

[054] Turn up at (arrive at a location or event)

🎧 I heard you're thinking about renting out your vacation home. How's that going?
🎧 It's going really well. I found a reliable family who wants to rent it for the summer.
🎧 That's great, but won't you miss using it yourself during the summer?
🎧 Well, here's the thing. They're offering a good rental price, which will cover all the expenses plus a little extra. So, I can use that extra income to explore other vacation options.
🎧 So, you get to make some money and still have the freedom to travel elsewhere. It's a win-win situation!
🎧 Exactly. It's a win for me financially, and they get a beautiful vacation home for the summer. Everyone's happy.
🎧 That sounds like a smart move, making the most of your assets and enjoying other experiences. It's definitely a win-win situation.

[055] I can't help it

🎧 I noticed you've been eating a lot of junk food lately. Trying to watch your diet?
🎧 Yeah, I know I should, but I can't help it. These snacks are just too tempting.
🎧 I get it. Sometimes those cravings are hard to resist.
🎧 And it's not just snacks. I've been binge-watching TV shows instead of studying.
🎧 Well, sometimes you need a break, but don't let it get in the way of your responsibilities.
🎧 I know, I know. I can't help it sometimes. It's like a habit.
🎧 It happens to the best of us. Just try to find a balance between indulging and staying on track.
🎧 You're right. I'll work on it. Thanks for the advice.
🎧 No problem. We all have our moments when we can't help ourselves.

[056] Bring around (convince or persuade someone to change their opinion)

🎧 I heard you're having trouble getting the team on board with the new project management software.
🎧 Yeah, it's been a challenge. Some team members are resistant to change.
🎧 I think if you can show them the benefits, you might be able to bring them around. Have you highlighted the efficiency improvements and time savings?
🎧 I've mentioned it, but I need a more convincing argument. Any suggestions on how to bring them around?
🎧 Maybe organize a demonstration or training session. Let them see firsthand how the new software can streamline tasks. Practical examples can bring people around more effectively than just talking about it.
🎧 That's a good idea. I'll schedule a hands-on session to demonstrate the features and benefits. Hopefully, that will bring them around.
🎧 Also, consider gathering feedback from those who have already adopted it successfully. Their positive experiences can help bring around those who are hesitant.
🎧 Excellent point. I'll reach out to the early adopters for testimonials. Hopefully, their positive feedback will bring around the skeptics.
🎧 Sounds like a solid plan. Remember, sometimes it takes time to bring people around, but persistence and evidence of success can make a significant difference.

[057] Brush up on (review or improve your knowledge or skills in a particular area)

🎧 I heard you're planning to take up photography again. How's that going?
🎧 Yeah, I used to be really into it, but it's been years. I need to brush up on my photography skills.
🎧 That's great! Any specific reason for getting back into it?
🎧 I got invited to a friend's wedding, and they asked if I could be the photographer. I couldn't refuse, but I realized I need to brush up on the latest techniques and equipment.
🎧 Weddings can be challenging to capture. Smart move to brush up on your skills before the big day.
🎧 Definitely. I want to make sure I do justice to their special day. Any suggestions on where I can brush up on the latest trends in wedding photography?
🎧 Online courses and tutorials are a good start. There are plenty of resources to help you brush up on both the technical and creative aspects.
🎧 Good idea. I'll look into that. I also need to brush up on using my camera. It's been gathering dust.
🎧 Practicing with your camera is crucial. You'll feel more confident once you've brushed up on the technical side.
🎧 Thanks for the advice. I'll make sure to brush up on everything before the wedding.

[058] Call on (visit or request someone to do something)

🎧 Have you had a chance to call on the new client yet?
🎧 Not yet. I was planning to call on them this afternoon. Do you have any specific points you want me to cover?
🎧 Yes, make sure to discuss the proposal we sent them last week. They called on us for more details, so be prepared to answer any questions.
🎧 Got it. I'll also call on them to understand their expectations and address any concerns they might have.
🎧 That's a good approach. Building a rapport is crucial during these initial meetings. Also, call on them to confirm the meeting time to avoid any misunderstandings.
🎧 Will do. I'll call on them first thing in the morning to confirm. By the way, did you call on the supplier about the delayed shipment?
🎧 Yes, I called on them earlier today. They assured me they would expedite the delivery.
🎧 Great. It's essential to call on them promptly to resolve issues and keep the projects on track.
🎧 Absolutely. Calling on suppliers and clients in a timely manner helps maintain good relationships and ensures smooth operations.

🎧 That's cool, have you met anyone interesting lately?  
🎧 Yeah, I actually met this fascinating person at a networking event last week.  
🎧 What were they like?  
🎧 They were very outgoing and had traveled to so many places. It was inspiring to hear about their experiences.  
🎧 Meeting new people can be so enriching. I met someone from a completely different industry at a conference last month.  
🎧 That's great, did you learn anything new from them?  
🎧 Definitely! They had a fresh perspective on some of the challenges I've been facing in my work.  
🎧 It's amazing how meeting new people can broaden your horizons.  
🎧 Absolutely! I always try to make connections wherever I go. You never know what you might learn or who you might meet.  
🎧 Exactly, every person has a story to tell, and it's exciting to discover those stories.  

[060] Meal Time Discussion

🎧 All right everyone, dinner's ready. Let's gather around the table.  
🎧 Smells delicious, honey! What's on the menu tonight?  
🎧 We're having spaghetti with meatballs and garlic bread.  
🎧 Yes! Spaghetti night is the best. Can we have extra parmesan cheese, please?  
🎧 Of course, sweetheart. Pass me the cheese grater, please.  
🎧 So, how was everyone's day today?  
🎧 Mine was awesome! We played soccer during recess, and I scored two goals. I finished my book report, and I think I did really well on it.  
🎧 That's wonderful to hear, both of you. And how about you, dear?  
🎧 Busy as usual, but nothing I couldn't handle. By the way, have you guys seen the news about the upcoming school fundraiser?  
🎧 Yeah, our class is doing a bake sale, right? Can we bake cookies to sell?  
🎧 Absolutely! We can make them together this weekend.  
🎧 Sounds like a plan! Let's eat up now, and then we can talk more about it.  

[061] Walk Out of (Leave a Place Often in Protest)

🎧 Did you hear about the meeting yesterday? It got pretty intense.  
🎧 Yeah, I heard. I actually walked out of it. I couldn't take the arguing anymore.  
🎧 Really? What happened?  
🎧 Well, it started off as a discussion, but it quickly turned into a heated argument. People were talking over each other, and it was going nowhere.  
🎧 That sounds frustrating. Why did you decide to walk out of the meeting?  
🎧 I felt like it wasn't productive, and no one was listening. I decided to walk out of the room to make a point. Maybe if people saw others leaving, they would realize how unproductive the whole thing was.  
🎧 Did it have any impact?  
🎧 Hard to say. Some others walked out after me, but I'm not sure if it made a difference. It was just so chaotic.  
🎧 Well, at least you took a stand. Sometimes you have to walk out when things are just too chaotic to handle.  

[062] How's the Weather Today

🎧 How's the weather today?  
🎧 Oh, it's quite sunny actually. A nice change from the rain we've had this week. What about over there?  
🎧 Still cloudy here, no sun yet. Planning on heading out?  
🎧 Yeah, I thought I might take a walk later. The fresh air would do me good. How about you?  
🎧 I'm thinking about it. If it clears up, I might go for a jog. Need to stretch my legs after being indoors for so long.  
🎧 Sounds like a good plan. Have you heard from the office about next week?  
🎧 Not yet, but I'm hoping we can continue working from home. It's been quite productive actually.  
🎧 Agreed! I've gotten used to the flexibility. Makes you wonder why we spent so much time commuting before this.  
🎧 Exactly! More time for walks and jogs, right?  
🎧 Right! Enjoy your jog if you manage to get out.

[063] Drop by (visit someone informally and without prior arrangement)

🎧 I heard you're in town, any plans for the weekend? 
🎧 Yeah, I thought I'd drop by and catch up with you. It's been ages since we last met. 
🎧 That sounds great, feel free to drop by anytime. I'll be home all weekend. 
🎧 Awesome, I'll probably drop by on Saturday afternoon. Does that work for you? 
🎧 Perfect, I'll make sure to be home. It'll be good to have you drop by. 
🎧 Is there anything specific you want to do when I drop by? Maybe grab a coffee or something? 
🎧 Yeah, we can drop by the new café that opened downtown. They have great coffee, it'll be a nice way to catch up. 
🎧 Sounds like a plan, I'll drop by around 2 pm on Saturday then. 
🎧 Looking forward to it. It's always nice when friends drop by unexpectedly. We can chat, have some coffee, and maybe even drop by the park if the weather's good. 
🎧 That sounds like a perfect Saturday afternoon. Can't wait to drop by and spend some quality time together.

[064] What's the best time to visit New York

🎧 What's the best time to visit New York? 
🎧 It depends on what you're looking for. Each season offers a different experience. 
🎧 I heard summer can get pretty hot and crowded. 
🎧 Yeah, summers can be sweltering and there are lots of tourists, but the city also comes alive with outdoor events and festivals. 
🎧 What about winter? 
🎧 Winter can be cold, especially in January and February, but it's also a magical time with holiday decorations and ice skating in Central Park. 
🎧 Spring must be nice with all the flowers blooming. 
🎧 Absolutely, spring is beautiful and the weather starts to warm up. Plus, you can catch the cherry blossoms in Central Park. 
🎧 Sounds lovely, what about fall? 
🎧 Fall is my favorite time to visit. The weather is mild and Central Park looks stunning with the changing leaves. 
🎧 Thanks for the info, I'll have to plan my trip accordingly.

[065] Ask for (request or demand something)

🎧 Have you finished that report I asked for last week? 
🎧 Oh, sorry, I forgot about it. I'll get it to you by the end of the day. 
🎧 It's crucial for the meeting tomorrow, so I need it as soon as possible. I specifically asked for it by yesterday. 
🎧 I know, and I apologize for the delay. I'll prioritize it and make sure to deliver it by this afternoon. 
🎧 I can't stress enough how important it is. We need that information for the client presentation. 
🎧 I understand, and I appreciate your patience. I'll make sure to finish it without any further delay. 
🎧 Good, also I wanted to ask for your input on the upcoming project. We need fresh ideas. 
🎧 I'm happy to help, just ask for my suggestions and I'll share my thoughts during the brainstorming session. 
🎧 Great, I'll schedule a meeting for later this week. Your input is always valuable. 
🎧 Thanks, I'm looking forward to it. Feel free to ask for any specific areas you want me to focus on.

[066] What's your favorite food

🎧 What's your favorite food? 
🎧 That's a tough one, but I'd probably say sushi. I love the variety. How about you? 
🎧 Pizza for me, can't go wrong with a classic pepperoni. 
🎧 Sushi and pizza, quite the combo. Do you have a favorite place to get your pizza from? 
🎧 There's this little Italian place down the street from my apartment. They make it in a wood-fired oven, it's the best. 
🎧 Sounds delicious, I've got a favorite sushi bar downtown. Ever been to Maki Express? 
🎧 I think I've heard of it, is it the one with the conveyor belt? 
🎧 Yeah, that's the one. Fresh sushi right off the belt. You should try it sometime. 
🎧 Definitely sounds worth a visit, maybe we could go together. 
🎧 I'd like that, it's always better to enjoy good food with good company. 
🎧 Agreed, let's plan for next week. 
🎧 Perfect, I'll look forward to it. 
🎧 Me too, it'll be a nice change from my usual pizza night.
