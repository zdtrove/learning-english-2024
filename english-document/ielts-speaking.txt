[001] Morning
 
ðŸŽ§ Do you usually do the same things in the mornings?
ðŸŽ§ As I'm a creature of habit, I would say yes. I always get up at 6:00 am, have noodles and tea for breakfast, brush my teeth, then brush up (quickly study) on what we learned the day before in class to make sure I'm well-prepared. After all of this, I start heading to class at 8:30am. However, on weekends, I tend to hit the snooze button and end up sleeping till 9:00am then start my day.
ðŸŽ§ Do you think breakfast is important?
ðŸŽ§ Absolutely. Many experts state that it is the most important meal of the day. I believe it gives me the fuel I need to tackle my day (to trongly take on the day). Moreover, I think it's critical to have a balanced breakfast to make sure I get all the proper nutrients. I cannot imagine starting my day on an empty stomach!
ðŸŽ§ Did you do the same morning routines in your early ages?
ðŸŽ§ Yes, pretty much! As I've always been a scholarly person, I've always had the motivation to get myself up earlier than expected to have a balanced breakfast and prepare myself for the day ahead of me. However, I used to have more of a sweet tooth (a person who lives sweets) as a child, so I used to munch on (eat) some sweet bread instead of noodles.
ðŸŽ§ Do you want to change your daily routines in the future?
ðŸŽ§ I think it's inevitable since I'll soon be joining the workforce! I want to keep my organized, prepared habits, but I hope to sleep in a bit more in the future. I would like to at least sleep 30 minutes to an hour later, and not have to spend as much time preparing for my day. Furthermore, I hope to have my own car instead of taking a Grab every morning.

[002] Study time
 
ðŸŽ§ What can you do to improve your learning efficiency?
ðŸŽ§ Hmm, I would say that meditation and physical exercise can certainly be of help. I believe that meditation can help you to become more aware of yourself and find your center of concentration. Furthermore, exercise releases tension and brings you back to focus. When I feel overwhelmed with my studies, I often take a break to go work out at the gym then afterwards feel more productive.
ðŸŽ§ Do you prefer to study in the morning or in the evening?
ðŸŽ§ Definitely the evening. When I have an exam the next morning, I feel that the information stays with me much more clearly when I cram (study at the last minute) the evening before. When I try to study in the morning, I often feel rushed or cannot stay focused, as I know all my daily tasks are awaiting me.
ðŸŽ§ What time do you like to study?
ðŸŽ§ Around dinnertime after I've finished all my tasks for the day; I feel most at ease at this time. When I study right before bed, I tend to even dream of that information, helping me to remember clearly for that exam.
ðŸŽ§ Why do people find it difficult to focus on studying?
ðŸŽ§ Well, for one, studying isn't something enjoyable for many people, so it's hard to concentrate on something you dislike. Moreover, it's difficult with all of the distractions of today- such as texting, instagram, facebook, etc. Lastly, some people become preoccupied with other tasks they need to do, such as cleaning or cooking.
ðŸŽ§ Do you like to study alone or with your friends?
ðŸŽ§ Both can be nice. But, I tend to be more efficient when I study alone. Sometimes when I study with friends, we get off topic and don't get much done. However, it is effective to quiz each other. So all in all, there are benefits to both.
 
[003] Plants
 
ðŸŽ§ Do you like plants?
ðŸŽ§ Frankly speaking, I'm quite drawn by plants and vegetation in general. I often find myself wandering about in the parks gazing aimlessly at the flowerbeds and enjoy the aroma that some beautiful flowers give off.
ðŸŽ§ Do you think plants can be a good gift?
ðŸŽ§ Definitely, plants usually feature in many occasions from casual birthdays to more formal dinners. It's common to bring a bunch of newly picked flowers or a bouquet of flowers to the host family.
ðŸŽ§ Can you grow plants? Do you know anything about growing a plant?
ðŸŽ§ I don't have a knack for gardening, so it's quite over my head when it comes to growing certain types of plants. My mother often takes care of this instead.
ðŸŽ§ Do you keep plants at home?
ðŸŽ§ Yes, I do. I mean I keep lily in my bedroom and I also plant some vegetables like cucumber, onions and tomatoes in the balcony. Now you can see everything covered in green.

[004] Films
 
ðŸŽ§ Do you like watch films?
ðŸŽ§ Absolutely! They are an excellent way to unwind (relax; free your mind). Moreover, my friends are reallt into films, so it's a fun, relaxing way to spend time together. Afterwards, we discuss and debate the film that we have just watched. Apart from just relaxing and enjoying the film, I like to delve deeper (get to the deeper meaning) to discover the subliminal messages.
ðŸŽ§ What kinds of movies do you like best?
ðŸŽ§ Well, I would say I'm still a kid at heart (a person who still feels like a child in their heart), so I really enjoy watching kids' movies. Although they seem simple and innocent, there are often many life lessons packed into these films. Moreover, I'm really into drama and historical movies. When I watch these, I feel that I can more deeply understand human emotions and re-live historical moments, like the Vietnam-America War or World War II.
ðŸŽ§ Do you prefer foreign films or films made in your country?
ðŸŽ§ Since my country doesn't have a huge film industry, I've always been really into American films. Not to knock (to insult; discredit) other film industries, but American ones are incredibly entertaining and well-made; the evolution of film continues to amaze me. Moreover, I only watch films in English so it helps me to learn new slang and expressions.
ðŸŽ§ How often do you watch films?
ðŸŽ§ Well, I am quite a busy bee (a busy person), but I manage to see about one or two films a week at home. After a long day of studying, I love snuggling up (getting comfortable with blankets) on the sofa and watching a film to unwind. I tend to do this on Friday and Sunday evenings with my friends.
ðŸŽ§ How often do you go to a cinema to watch a movie?
ðŸŽ§ Not too often actually. As the prices in my country are quite high, I usually opt to (choose) watch a movie at home instead to save on costs. Actually, I think it's kind of a waste of money to see a movie at a cinema when you can watch it from the comfort of your living room. I only go when a friend invites me, which is maybe 4 times a year.
ðŸŽ§ Do people in your country like to go to a cinema to watch a film?
ðŸŽ§ I would say so. Since people like to go out with their families on the weekends, this is often an activity that they would choose. Moreover, teenagers enjoy this activity as a way to get out of the house. Furthermore, it's often a popular date option for many people!
ðŸŽ§ What was the first film that you watched?
ðŸŽ§ Hmm it's hard to say the first, but I think it was the Lion King. I know it first came out in the early 90's when I was a child. It was my absolute favorite- I used to watch it repeatedly until my parents were really tired of it! I even built "pride rock" out of rocks that I found when we would go to visit my relatives who have a garden.
ðŸŽ§ Do you like to watch movies alone or with your friends?
ðŸŽ§ Both! On one hand, I find it extremely relaxing to chill out and fall asleep to a film by myself, but it's also enjoyable to have company. So, all in all, I prefer films with friends, since they are also into film. Afterwards, we can discuss the meaning and carry on inside jokes (jokes among friends) from quotes from the film later on!
ðŸŽ§ Would you like to be in a movie?
ðŸŽ§ Not one bit! As I have stage fright (fear of being on stage), I would never have the guts (never be brave enough to) to do it. Secondly, I feel awkward when I try to act and I have the memory of a goldfish (short memory) so I know I could never memorize my lines! All in all, acting is simply not my thing.

[005] Spare time/Hobbies

ðŸŽ§ Do you have any hobbies?
ðŸŽ§ Of course! My number one hobby is playing golf. Actually, my entire family, grandparents included, are really into golf. Ever since I was a child, my father used to take me to the driving range (the place to practice hitting golf balls) with him to practice. This planted the seed of interest for me. Now we all play together as a family, and actually I beat them all most of the time!
ðŸŽ§ What do you do when you have free time?
ðŸŽ§ My favorite things to do are play golf and see my friends and family. My top priority is spending time with those I love- and luckily most of us share the common interest of golf. For those who don't like golf, I enjoy spending time eating or at a coffeeshop together.
ðŸŽ§ What free time activities are popular with people in your country?
ðŸŽ§ As most countries in the world, soccer is quite popular. Furthermore, people tend to enjoy playing cricket and drinking tea with one another. Nowadays, backpacking across Southeast Asia is becoming quite popular too!
ðŸŽ§ What do you usually do after work or classes?
ðŸŽ§ Since I have an exhausting day in the office, I don't like to stay sedentary all day. I usually hit the gym and go to the driving range after work almost every single day. If I go straight home, I become glued to (attached to) the couch (another word for sofa) and don't do anything worthwhile.
ðŸŽ§ Do you prefer staying at home or going out during evenings?
ðŸŽ§ As I'm an extroverted, active person, I'd definitely rather hit the town (go out). I really enjoy going out with my college and golf mates fore some beers every weekend. Moreover, I always dedicate Sunday to my family. We usually have a lunch and tea time at my grandmother's house.
ðŸŽ§ What free-time activities would you like to try in the future?
ðŸŽ§ Lately I've had a growing interest in yoga and meditation. Some of my friends and family have recently gotten involved in it, and I see that it helps them maintain their calm regardless of the chaos around them. Furthermore, it improves balance, coordination, and body toning. I think it could benefit me, as I have a stressful office job.
ðŸŽ§ Do you like to spend your free time with families or friends?
ðŸŽ§ It's equal! I need both. However, family will always be my number one priority. Unlike some people, I always let loose and have fun with my family. On the other hand, I really enjoy spending time with my friends and discussing topics that would be inappropriate in front of family members.
