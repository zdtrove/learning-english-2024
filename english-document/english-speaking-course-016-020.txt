[Talking about Daily Routine in English]

🎧 Good morning.
🎧 It's 7:00.
🎧 Time to wake up.
🎧 Well, morning Anna.
🎧 Did you sleep well?
🎧 Morning, Lisa.
🎧 I slept okay, but I had a weird dream.
🎧 Weird dream? Tell me about it.
🎧 I dreamt I was flying, but then I started falling.
🎧 It was strange.
🎧 Maybe that says you're very stressed.
🎧 You have a lot of work to do on school projects these days.
🎧 Maybe...
🎧 After the projects.
🎧 I guess I need to rest.
🎧 How about you?
🎧 Any plans today?
🎧 Just some stuff to do at school.
🎧 Okay, let's go have breakfast.
🎧 What are we having for breakfast, Anna?
🎧 I think I'll make some toast with butter and jam
🎧 and a glass of orange juice.
🎧 Sounds good.
🎧 I'll have the same.
🎧 Let's prepare the toast together.
🎧 Sure.
🎧 You handle the toaster.
🎧 I'll get the jam and butter.
🎧 Deal.
🎧 How many slices do you want?
🎧 Two for me.
🎧 How about you?
🎧 I'll take two as well.
🎧 Did you study late last night?
🎧 Yeah, a bit.
🎧 Just trying to stay on top of everything.
🎧 This is very important to me.
🎧 What about you?
🎧 Did you finish that novel you were reading?
🎧 I did, the ending was a surprise.
🎧 I didn't see it coming at all.
🎧 Now I really want to read it.
🎧 Maybe I'll try when I'm less busy.
🎧 Oh, the toast is ready! Let’s butter it up.
🎧 Do you want a lot of butter?
🎧 Or just a little?
🎧 Just a little. Thanks.
🎧 And some strawberry jam, please.
🎧 Coming right up.
🎧 Here you are.
🎧 Let's try it.
🎧 Ooh, this is delicious.
🎧 I love toast and jam.
🎧 It's good to start a new day.
🎧 I'm happy that you like it.
🎧 Do you need any help with your project?
🎧 Thanks for offering.
🎧 But I think we've got it under control.
🎧 Tom and Sarah are great teammates.
🎧 That's good to hear.
🎧 Hey, Anna.
🎧 Ready to work on the project?
🎧 Yes. Let's get started.
🎧 We need to finish the research part today.
🎧 I brought some books from the library.
🎧 Great! I’ll start writing the introduction.
🎧 This is going well.
🎧 We're a good team.
🎧 Absolutely.
🎧 Let's keep it up.
🎧 Anna, can you check this paragraph?
🎧 Sure.
🎧 Let me see her.
🎧 It looks good, but maybe we should add more details here.
🎧 Anna, could you help me with this chart?
🎧 I'm not sure if I got the data right.
🎧 Of course, Tom.
🎧 Let's look at it together.
🎧 Tom, what do you think about this source?
🎧 Is it reliable?
🎧 Let's cross-check it with another book to be sure.
🎧 Good idea.
🎧 I'll look it up online to.
🎧 I found another book that has similar information.
🎧 Maybe we could use both sources.
🎧 That sounds perfect.
🎧 We can compare and add the best parts from each.
🎧 How are we doing on the timeline?
🎧 Are we on schedule?
🎧 I think we're doing fine.
🎧 If we keep up this pace, we should finish in time.
🎧 Yes. Let's keep pushing.
🎧 We're almost there.
🎧 What should we eat for lunch?
🎧 How about a salad at a sandwich?
🎧 Sounds good to me.
🎧 I'll have the chicken salad and a side of sweet potato fries.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 Wait for me a minute and I'll be right back.
🎧 I'm back.
🎧 Thank you so much, Tom.
🎧 They look so yummy.
🎧 Yeah.
🎧 So, any plans for tonight?
🎧 Yeah, we're having a party tonight.
🎧 You should come.
🎧 That sounds fun.
🎧 Come here.
🎧 I'll be there, too.
🎧 What time does it start?
🎧 Around 6 p.m.
🎧 It's going to be a blast.
🎧 I'm looking forward to it.
🎧 What should I bring?
🎧 Just bring yourself in a good mood.
🎧 Anna, what music will we have at the party?
🎧 Oh, I made a playlist with all our favorite songs.
🎧 We can also take requests.
🎧 Perfect. I love dancing to good music.
🎧 Should I bring some snacks or drinks?
🎧 That would be great, Tom. Thanks.
🎧 Do you guys think we'll have time to play some games?
🎧 Absolutely.
🎧 I have a few fun games in mind.
🎧 I can't wait.
🎧 It's going to be so much fun.
🎧 This is going to be so much fun.
🎧 I'm glad everyone could make it.
🎧 Me too.
🎧 Let's enjoy the evening.
🎧 This party is awesome.
🎧 Yeah, I'm having a blast.
🎧 I'm glad you guys are here.
🎧 Let's play some games.
🎧 How about we play a round of Werewolf?
🎧 It's always intense and fun.
🎧 Good idea.
🎧 Yes! I love Werewolf.
🎧 Alright, everyone close your eyes.
🎧 Werewolves, wake up and choose your victim.
🎧 Anna, you're so good at this game.
🎧 Thanks! I’ve had a lot of practice.
🎧 What's next?
🎧 How about some karaoke?
🎧 Yes, I love karaoke.
🎧 Great idea.
🎧 Let's put on some music and dance.
🎧 Tom, your singing is amazing!
🎧 Thanks, Anna.
🎧 I've practiced this song at home many times.
🎧 Come on, guys, let's take a group photo to remember the night.
🎧 This is going to be a great memory.
🎧 Absolutely.
🎧 We should print this and added to our photo wall.
🎧 That's so nice.
🎧 Alright. See you again guys.
🎧 I was really happy tonight.
🎧 Me too. Thanks for a great night.
🎧 Anytime, Sarah.
🎧 Goodbye. See you guys again.

[I'm AFRAID of Speaking English!]

🎧 Welcome to our new home, Chloe.
🎧 What do you think?
🎧 It's nice!
🎧 But I am worried.
🎧 My English is not very good. I'm afraid I won't fit in at school.
🎧 Don't worry, Chloe.
🎧 It will take some time, but you'll get used to it.
🎧 You'll make friends and your English will improve.
🎧 Just be patient.
🎧 I will try, Dad.
🎧 Thank you.
🎧 We're proud of you, Chloe.
🎧 Remember, we're always here to support you.
🎧 I miss my friends back home.
🎧 I wish I can make some new friends here.
🎧 You still have to go to school tomorrow, right?
🎧 That's right.
🎧 You will meet many new friends.
🎧 Here people are very open.
🎧 I hope so.
🎧 I will try to make friends and fit in.
🎧 I hope I can understand them.
🎧 Hi, class.
🎧 Today we will start a group project.
🎧 Please form groups of four.
🎧 Oh, what should I do?
🎧 Hey, do you want to join our group?
🎧 Yes. Thank you.
🎧 We need a good idea for a project.
🎧 Any suggestions?
🎧 Okay. We need to find an animal with interesting characteristics.
🎧 Only then will our presentation stand out.
🎧 Exactly.
🎧 What do you think, Chloe?
🎧 Do you have any ideas?
🎧 Um, maybe we can... do a project about... bats.
🎧 Bats are active at night.
🎧 They also typically sleep hanging upside down.
🎧 That's a great idea, Chloe!
🎧 Let's do that.
🎧 So we can start by studying bats and their habitat.
🎧 Yes. And, we can make a poster with pictures and information.
🎧 Do you like drawing, John?
🎧 Maybe you can help with the poster.
🎧 Yeah, I like drawing.
🎧 I can do that.
🎧 Great. I think I'm pretty good at finding information.
🎧 So I'll be in charge of that part.
🎧 We still have roles to present and prepare a slideshow for Kylie and Chloe to choose.
🎧 How about you, Chloe?
🎧 What do you want to do?
🎧 Can you give me time to think?
🎧 I'll answer you this afternoon.
🎧 Of course.
🎧 Okay. We can meet after school tomorrow to work on it.
🎧 Hi, Chloe! I’m Kylie.
🎧 My family just moved in next door.
🎧 I brought some fruit for your family.
🎧 Oh. Thank you, Kylie.
🎧 I didn't expect that you would be my new neighbor.
🎧 Come in. Please.
🎧 I noticed you seemed a bit nervous at school today.
🎧 Is everything okay?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 I'm just not good at English, so it's hard for me to talk to people.
🎧 Oh, I understand.
🎧 Moving to a new place and learning a new language can be tough.
🎧 I'd like to help you.
🎧 Can I give you some tips?
🎧 Yes, please. I would appreciate that.
🎧 Okay. First, try to speak English as much as you can.
🎧 Even if you make mistakes.
🎧 It's the best way to learn.
🎧 For example, when you go to a store, try to ask questions in English.
🎧 I saw that you wanted to say your idea this morning, but didn't dare, right?
🎧 That's right, thanks to you mentioning me I was able to share my idea.
🎧 When I spoke out, I found that speaking wasn't that scary.
🎧 That's right.
🎧 I'll try every day.
🎧 Second, listen to English music or watch English movies with subtitles.
🎧 It helps you get used to the sounds and rhythm of the language.
🎧 I'll bring some movies with English subtitles and we can watch them together.
🎧 I'll explain what you don't understand.
🎧 That sounds like fun.
🎧 Third, don't be afraid to ask people to speak slowly
🎧 or repeat themselves if you don't understand.
🎧 Most people are happy to help.
🎧 For example, it's me who's always willing to help you.
🎧 Thank you, Kylie. These tips are very helpful.
🎧 You're welcome, Chloe.
🎧 Now let's start with some practical exercises.
🎧 When you go to a store, try to ask for something specific.
🎧 For example, if you need bread, you can say,
🎧 "Excuse me, where is the bread?"
🎧 Excuse me, where is the bread?
🎧 Perfect.
🎧 And if they answer too quickly, you can say, "Can you please repeat that slowly?"
🎧 Can you please repeat that slowly?
🎧 Great. Now let's practice the conversation.
🎧 I'll pretend to be a cashier and you can ask me for help.
🎧 Okay. Let's try.
🎧 Hi, how can I help you today?
🎧 Hi. Can you help me find the bread?
🎧 Sure. It's in aisle five.
🎧 Can you please repeat that slowly?
🎧 Aisle five.
🎧 Thank you!
🎧 Perfect! You're doing great, Chloe.
🎧 I can see that you understand what I say.
🎧 It's just that you lack confidence,
🎧 and that's not a problem.
🎧 The more you practice, the easier it will become.
🎧 You make me feel so motivated.
🎧 Oh, about this morning.
🎧 Can I take over the group's presentation duties?
🎧 I want to try.
🎧 Of course. That means you need to practice more.
🎧 Please practice at home, and I'll come back tomorrow to help you.
🎧 Thank you so much.
🎧 Now, let's focus on your presentation.
🎧 How do you feel about it?
🎧 I'm still scared.
🎧 What if I forget what to say or I make a mistake?
🎧 It's normal to feel nervous.
🎧 Let's work on building your confidence
🎧 First, remember that everyone makes mistakes, and that’s okay.
🎧 and that's okay.
🎧 The important thing is to keep going.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 What should I do to feel more confident?
🎧 The more you practice, the more confident you'll become.
🎧 Let's go through your presentation step by step.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 You got this.
🎧 Start with your introduction.
🎧 Remember to speak slowly and clearly.
🎧 Good morning, everyone.
🎧 My name is Chloe, and today I want to talk about bats.
🎧 Great start!
🎧 Now let's practice making eye contact.
🎧 Look at different points in the room.
🎧 As if you're looking at your classmates.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 Bats are important to our world for many reasons.
🎧 They help reduce insect numbers and spread plant seeds.
🎧 That's great, Chloe!
🎧 Now let's add some gestures.
🎧 Use your hands to emphasize key points.
🎧 For example, a single bat can eat thousands of insects in one night.
🎧 Helping farmers by reducing the number of pests that damage crops.
🎧 Excellent.
🎧 You're doing so well.
🎧 Remember to pause, so your points are clear.
🎧 And to help you stay calm.
🎧 Okay, I'll try.
🎧 Let's practice a bit more.
🎧 Imagine the audience is really interested in what you're saying.
🎧 Smile and show them that you're excited about your topic.
🎧 Thank you, Kylie. Your help means a lot.
🎧 Here. Use this mirror to practice.
🎧 Look at yourself and practice speaking confidently.
🎧 It can help you see how you're doing.
🎧 That's a good idea. Thank you, Kylie.
🎧 Let's try something different now.
🎧 I'll ask you some questions, and you answer them as if you're in front of the class.
🎧 Ready?
🎧 Oh, I never thought about that, but I'm ready.
🎧 Okay. I can do it, Chloe.
🎧 Chloe!
🎧 Oh, what?
🎧 We just wanted to say that you can do it.
🎧 That's right. You've prepared the presentation well.
🎧 Don't worry.
🎧 Remember what I said?
🎧 I got it, guys.
🎧 Let me invite group 5 for the presentation.
🎧 Good morning, everyone.
🎧 My name is Chloe.
🎧 I am the representative of group 5.
🎧 And today I want to talk about bats.
🎧 She's doing great.
🎧 She's no longer as self-conscious as the first day.
🎧 Bats are important to our world for many reasons.
🎧 They help reduce insect numbers and spread plant seeds.
🎧 For example, a single bat can eat thousands of insects in one night.
🎧 Which helps farmers by reducing the number of pests that damage crops.
🎧 And that's why bats are necessary to our world.
🎧 They play important parts in our ecosystem and in our lives.
🎧 Thank you.
🎧 Excellent job, Chloe!
🎧 You spoke very well.
🎧 Keep up the good work.
🎧 Thank you.
🎧 Oh, I couldn't have done it without you, Kylie.
🎧 Thank you for everything.
🎧 You're welcome, Chloe.
🎧 I'm glad I could help.
🎧 Friends support each other, right?
🎧 Right. And now, I feel more confident in speaking English.
🎧 I'm so happy for you, Chloe.
🎧 You did an amazing job.
🎧 I want to thank you by inviting you to dinner with my family.
🎧 Is that okay?
🎧 Certainly!
🎧 Welcome, Kylie! We’re so glad you could join us for dinner.
🎧 Thank you for having me.
🎧 I'm happy to be here.
🎧 Chloe told us how much you helped her with her presentation.
🎧 We really appreciate it.
🎧 It was my pleasure.
🎧 Chloe did all the hard work.
🎧 She was amazing.
🎧 Your tips and support made all the difference.
🎧 How is your presentation, Chloe?
🎧 I guess it's good, right?
🎧 It went great, mom.
🎧 I was nervous, but I did it, and I got a good grade.
🎧 That's wonderful, Chloe. We're so proud of you.
🎧 I couldn't have done it without Kylie. She helped me so much.
🎧 It sounds like you've made a good friend.
🎧 Yes, I have.
🎧 And now I feel more confident in speaking English.
🎧 You know, Chloe, learning a new language and adapting to a new culture is not easy.
🎧 But you've shown great courage.
🎧 We're very proud of you.
🎧 Thank you, Dad.
🎧 I'm excited about the future now.
🎧 And remember, if you ever feel unsure or need help.
🎧 You have friends like Kylie and us to support you.
🎧 I know mom.

[I Can Understand English, But I Can’t Speak]

🎧 Everyone! This is Laura, our new team member.
🎧 Laura, please introduce yourself!
🎧 Hello, everyone.
🎧 My name is Laura.
🎧 I am new here.
🎧 Nice to meet you all.
🎧 Welcome, Laura!
🎧 We are very happy you are here.
🎧 Please tell us about yourself.
🎧 Okay, um...I am from Spain.
🎧 I moved here last month.
🎧 My English is not very good.
🎧 Please be patient with me.
🎧 No problem Laura!
🎧 We will help you with your English.
🎧 Yes. Don't worry.
🎧 It's okay.
🎧 Thank you.
🎧 I feel a little nervous today.
🎧 This is my first day.
🎧 No need to be nervous!
🎧 We are one team here.
🎧 Let me introduce everyone.
🎧 Okay team, let's begin.
🎧 Laura, you have the first presentation today.
🎧 Can you share the project details with us?
🎧 Y-yes, okay.
🎧 Um, this project is for...the new...um...
🎧 I'm sorry, I am having trouble expressing...
🎧 It's okay Laura, take your time.
🎧 Okay, I will try again...
🎧 Um, this project is for...the new...um...customer?
🎧 I think you mean "client", Laura.
🎧 Oh yes, client. This project is for new client.
🎧 They want...they want us to make...a website?
🎧 A website for them, yes. What else can you tell us?
🎧 Okay, um, the website must have...
🎧 it must... It must have shopping...ability?
🎧 You mean "online shopping cart", right?
🎧 Yes, online shopping cart. And also...
🎧 It must have...easy navigation?
🎧 No, that's not right...
🎧 I think you mean "user-friendly navigation".
🎧 Yes, user-friendly. I'm sorry.
🎧 It's okay, just take a breath. You're doing your best.
🎧 Okay, let me try again...
🎧 Thank you for trying Laura
🎧 but your English needs more practice.
🎧 You made many mistakes today.
🎧 Yes, you're right. I will work harder.
🎧 Why don't we get you an English tutor?
🎧 With some lessons, the presentations will get easier.
🎧 Yes sir!
🎧 Hey Laura, don't be too upset.
🎧 Public speaking in a new language is really hard.
🎧 But I made so many mistakes.
🎧 The manager is right, my English needs a lot of work.
🎧 I understand how you feel.
🎧 When I first joined this company, my English was terrible too.
🎧 Really? But you speak so well now!
🎧 Yes, but it took a lot of practice.
🎧 I was once in your position.
🎧 What did you do to improve?
🎧 Well, I started taking evening English classes.
🎧 And I practiced as much as possible by putting myself in
🎧 situations to use English.
🎧 Like what situations?
🎧 Like going to coffee shops or stores and making myself order in English
🎧 Even though it was scary at first.
🎧 Or watching English TV shows and movies.
🎧 Those are good ideas! I should try that.
🎧 And you know what really helped me?
🎧 Finding a partner to practice conversation with.
🎧 We can do that together if you want!
🎧 We can meet a few times a week, get a snack, and just chat in English.
🎧 I'll go slowly and correct
🎧 you when needed.
🎧 Thank you, Helen!
🎧 Okay, let's start with some basic conversations.
🎧 You order for us.
🎧 Good morning.
🎧 Can I get a small coffee, please?
🎧 And for you, Laura?
🎧 Um... I would like... a tea?
🎧 No, no.
🎧 One green tea, please.
🎧 Great job.
🎧 You remembered to say "one" instead of "a" for the tea.
🎧 Thanks! Oh, and can I also get a muffin?
🎧 Yes, nicely done. What kind of muffin would you like?
🎧 I want... the blueberry muffin, please.
🎧 Describe one of the trees or flowers
🎧 you see in as much detail as you can.
🎧 Okay...
🎧 I see a tree with a very tall,
🎧 thick trunk.
🎧 Its leaves are green and... oval-shaped?
🎧 With a pointed tip.
🎧 Good, good. What else?
🎧 Some of the leaves have... yellow or orange edges?
🎧 Is that normal?
🎧 Yes. That's perfect.
🎧 Those are the fall colors just starting to change.
🎧 Excuse me.
🎧 How much are these apples?
🎧 Two dollars a pound.
🎧 Ah ok, I would like...four apples please.
🎧 No, wait, I do not know the weight.
🎧 One pound of apples, please.
🎧 Here you go!
🎧 Fantastic! You corrected yourself perfectly.
🎧 Speaking more slowly is helping me catch my own mistakes.
🎧 All right, team.
🎧 It's time for the monthly presentations.
🎧 Laura, you're up first this time.
🎧 Can you give us an update on the website project?
🎧 Yes, of course. I'm ready.
🎧 For the new website project with our top client,
🎧 We have made good progress.
🎧 First, the design team created mockups
🎧 for the home page and other main pages.
🎧 These mock-ups follow the client's branding colors and style.
🎧 Laura's English has really improved.
🎧 She sounds so much better.
🎧 Next, the development team started building the website framework.
🎧 They used coding to add the main
🎧 navigation menus and layout structure.
🎧 As you can see here, the shopping cart feature is now working.
🎧 Users can add items, update quantities, and proceed to checkout.
🎧 Great work explaining that, Laura.
🎧 The client will be impressed.
🎧 Thank you.
🎧 Finally, some other key features are the live chat box for customer support,
🎧 and the user account login area.
🎧 And that's where we're at currently. Any other questions?
🎧 Excellent presentation, Laura.
🎧 Your English skills
🎧 have come such a long way.
🎧 Thanks to lots of practice...and help from Helen.
🎧 Well, keep up the great work, both of you!
🎧 Helen.
🎧 Helen! Thank you so much for everything.
🎧 Laura, your presentation was fantastic!
🎧 I'm so proud of you.
🎧 I couldn't have done it without your tips and practice sessions.
🎧 You really helped me improve my English.
🎧 Of course, I was happy to help.
🎧 but you put in all the hard work
🎧 and effort yourself.
🎧 Your advice about watching shows and movies in English was great too.
🎧 It helped me with vocabulary
🎧 and conversational phrases.
🎧 Keep doing that and your English
🎧 will just get better and better over time.
🎧 I will.
🎧 This is only the beginning for me.
🎧 Thank you, Helen.
🎧 You're a wonderful friend
🎧 and I truly appreciate your support.
🎧 Learning a language is never easy,
🎧 especially when it's not your mother tongue.
🎧 And English, a language full of quirks,
🎧 is a challenge with lots of learners.
🎧 I know it's an uphill task to learn English
🎧 and as an English learner, I agree.
🎧 It takes time and effort.
🎧 There were times that I also thought of giving up.
🎧 I felt helpless and desperate.
🎧 I don't know what I should do.
🎧 Everything seemed to be against me.
🎧 It was a hard time.
🎧 But then things changed.
🎧 I talked with my friends and they reminded me of what made me start all of this.
🎧 And what motivates me.
🎧 I pull myself together and get back to the right track.
🎧 Learning English is a journey without an ending.
🎧 You always learn and improve over time.
🎧 The thing is, you gotta set a clear goal and enjoy what you’re doing.
🎧 And I'm here to share with you my tips.
🎧 First, you need to figure out
🎧 why you want to learn English.
🎧 What is your true purpose for this?
🎧 You want a scholarship
🎧 or you need to apply for your job.
🎧 Seeking a new opportunity.
🎧 Or it can simply be to communicate with people around the world, to make new friends.
🎧 The reason for this can be diverse,
🎧 but it should be clear.
🎧 I need you to write it down on the paper.
🎧 Always remind yourself of that.
🎧 Once you identify your goal, let it be on the top of your priority list.
🎧 Make it engraved on your mind.
🎧 Expose yourself to it on a daily basis.
🎧 Stick them somewhere you see every day.
🎧 On the door, your desk, on the wall, etc..
🎧 A goal without a plan is just a wish.
🎧 When you've got your own goal,
🎧 put it into action.
🎧 Make time for it.
🎧 Spend a certain period of time
🎧 in one day for your learning.
🎧 For example, you can spend 2 hours per day practicing speaking English.
🎧 Or just 10 to 15 minutes to memorize new words.
🎧 And the important thing is, it doesn't matter how long.
🎧 What matters is how often you do it.
🎧 That's the difference.
🎧 You can save less time for your learning,
🎧 but do it on the regular.
🎧 It can be every day, three times per week.
🎧 For instance,
🎧 but it should be consistent.
🎧 You get it?
🎧 When you have time for learning,
🎧 think of a method which can help you learn at your best.
🎧 To me, I try to let myself see, listen and expose myself to English as much as possible.
🎧 Set your phone language to English.
🎧 This is an interesting and effective way to learn English,
🎧 because the phone is what I always have with me.
🎧 And it works because I am already familiar
🎧 with all the buttons,
🎧 functions, and all the apps.
🎧 But this is not really recommended for beginners.
🎧 They may get confused.
🎧 Instead of making things easier to learn,
🎧 they get frustrated and discouraged.
🎧 So my method may suit some, but it may not be the right one for others.
🎧 Be mindful. Ask yourself what motivates you the most.
🎧 And what can help you learn the most effectively,
🎧 but not make you bored and give up at the same time.
🎧 If you haven't found anything which can help you yet, don't worry.
🎧 It also took me months, even years to try and figure out what suits me best.
🎧 And remember, learning English takes time.
🎧 You will always have to keep learning
🎧 no matter what level you are right now.
🎧 Even after years of practicing and trying, I still tell myself to keep going.
🎧 and never give up at any cost.
🎧 You can take things slow, just don’t let things go.
🎧 Back in the time when I just began to study English.
🎧 I couldn't speak a word.
🎧 I spent months at my desk cramming and trying to learn by heart all the new words.
🎧 I wanted to learn as much as I could at that time.
🎧 I thought it would be easier if I shorten
🎧 the time of learning by learning more.
🎧 But I was wrong.
🎧 I was overwhelmed and got off track.
🎧 That was the time I realized that I needed to change.
🎧 I would not rush anymore and focus on what's more effective.
🎧 It worked and I made clear improvements.
🎧 So take small steps and enjoy the journey.
🎧 What you should do is to let your mind be stress free.
🎧 That's when you can learn the most.
🎧 If you feel things are getting too much, slow down.
🎧 Putting too much pressure on yourself
🎧 will not benefit you at all.
🎧 I know sometimes pressure might come in useful.
🎧 It makes people focus and encourages them to perform better.
🎧 However, excessive levels of pressure can result in negative outcomes.
🎧 Those are anxiety, nervousness, or even depression.
🎧 One more thing, your journey will be great when you have company.
🎧 Self-learning is important,
🎧 But having supportive friends who join with you is also perfect for learning.
🎧 You will be surprised by how much you can achieve together.
🎧 Learning in pairs, or groups can also help you to remember things better, and longer as well.
🎧 Also, when taking part in a group of learners,
🎧 they help each other to refine their understanding
🎧 or correct mistakes that they can't see by themselves.
🎧 Many hands make light work.
🎧 If you have any confusion, ask your friends who's learning with you
🎧 or the internet can be a great idea.
🎧 There are tons of learning websites,
🎧 platforms for English learners on the Internet.
🎧 You can ask or answer questions from someone who is thousands miles away from you.
🎧 It’s getting easier and easier nowadays to get help for something.
🎧 Especially when learning English becomes something popular and essential.
🎧 so you can consider looking for a company
🎧 when learning English.
🎧 It’s like having extra support, motivation and better retention as well.
🎧 So why not?
🎧 So learning English is not rocket science.
🎧 It’s also not a piece of cake.
🎧 But if I can do this, so will you.
🎧 Do not let anything stop you.
🎧 There are hundreds, thousands of people trying to learn English everyday,
🎧 but not everyone can actually manage to do it.
🎧 Having a strong motivation and the right method, is the base for you to start.
🎧 I hope you will make it.
