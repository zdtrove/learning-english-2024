🎧 Hi, I'm Oli. Welcome to Oxford Online English!
🎧 In this lesson, you can learn how to talk about your family in English.
🎧 Do you have a big family?
🎧 What do you like doing when you spend time with your family?
🎧 Talking about family can be a good way to start a conversation in English, so it's useful if you know what to say and if you have some questions to ask.
🎧 Let's start with something simple.
🎧 Part one: introducing your family.
🎧 Let's start with a simple sentence:
🎧 There are ________ people in my family.
🎧 So you can say:
🎧 There are five...
🎧 There are ten...
🎧 There are thirty people in my family.
🎧 That's not too hard, but it's not so interesting, either!
🎧 You should say who these people are.
🎧 There are ten people in my family: I have two sisters, one brother, my uncle and aunt, two grandparents and my parents of course.
🎧 There are four people in my family: my wife, my two sons and myself.
🎧 Part two: Talking about your brothers and sisters.
🎧 How many brothers and sisters do you have?
🎧 You could say:
🎧 I have two brothers and one sister.
🎧 I just have one sister.
🎧 I'm an only child.
🎧 Let's make it more interesting by adding more information.
🎧 Are your brothers and sisters older or younger?
🎧 Where are you in the family?
🎧 I have two older brothers and one older sister.
🎧 I'm the youngest in the family.
🎧 I just have one sister, who's five years older than me.
🎧 I'm the middle child: my brother is two years older, and I have a younger sister who's finishing university this year.
🎧 Part three: talking about your immediate and your extended family.
🎧 In English, we sometimes draw a line between your immediate family.
🎧 That means: you, your husband/wife, your children, parents, and brothers and sisters.
🎧 Then, you have your extended family.
🎧 That means: aunts, uncles, cousins, nephews, nieces, grandparents, grandchildren, and so on.
🎧 Now, you can give more details about the people in your family, like this:
🎧 My immediate family is quite small, because I'm an only child.
🎧 My mum is one of five children, so I have a lot of cousins, who are kind of like my brothers and sisters.
🎧 There are six people in my immediate family: my parents, my brother and his wife, my sister and me.
🎧 I have a lot of other relatives, but they live in Canada so we don't see them often.
🎧 Part four: talking about your children.
🎧 Do you have children?
🎧 Let's see what you can say:
🎧 I have three kids: two girls and a boy.
🎧 We have a newborn son.
🎧 We have one daughter, and my wife's expecting our second child.
🎧 As always, you should add details to make your answers longer and more interesting:
🎧 I have three kids: two girls and a boy.
🎧 Our eldest daughter has just started secondary school, and the two younger ones are still in primary school.
🎧 We have a newborn son.
🎧 He's just three weeks old now, so we're still getting used to things!
🎧 We have one daughter, and my wife's expecting our second child.
🎧 We don't know if it's a boy or a girl, but we'll find out in three months.
🎧 Part five: talking about your relationship with your family.
🎧 Finally, let's add some information about how often you see your family, and what you like to do together.
🎧 For example:
🎧 I'm very close to my family.
🎧 We have lunch together every weekend.
🎧 I see my older brother once a week; we play tennis or basketball together.
🎧 I try to spend as much time as possible with my kids.
🎧 What now? You should know the answer: add more details!
🎧 Let's look: I'm very close to my family.
🎧 We have lunch together every weekend at my grandmother's house.
🎧 She always cooks something delicious!
🎧 I see my older brother once a week; we play tennis or basketball together.
🎧 I don't see my other brother so often, because he lives overseas, although we talk on Skype every so often.
🎧 I try to spend as much time as possible with my kids.
🎧 We play cards, watch films, or go to the park if the weather's nice.
🎧 Part six: making a longer answer.
🎧 Now you should be able to make a longer answer talking about your family.
🎧 You should be able to talk about your relatives, your brothers and sisters, your children if
🎧 you have any, and your relationship with your family.
🎧 Let's look at a sample answer:
🎧 There are five people in my immediate family, although my extended family is quite large.
🎧 I have two sisters, both younger, so I'm the oldest child.
🎧 I don't have kids yet but I'd like to have a big family one day.
🎧 I see my parents and my sisters quite often, because we all live near each other, although
🎧 I don't see my other relatives that much. OK?
🎧 Could you make an answer like this?
🎧 Let's look at one more sample answer first:
🎧 I come from a big family: I'm the fifth child, and I have three brothers and one sister.
🎧 They're all close to each other in age, but there's a big gap between them and me.
🎧 I don't have children, but I have lots of nieces and nephews!
🎧 I don't see my family often because I live in a different country, but I speak to them regularly and we all get together once or twice a year, which is always very noisy but lots of fun.
🎧 What about you? Try to make a longer answer talking about your family.
🎧 Use the vocabulary and ideas from the lesson to help you.
🎧 Next time you talk about your family in English, hopefully you'll have lots to talk about!
🎧 That's the end of the lesson. I hope it was useful.
