🎧 Hello, I'm Michael. Welcome to Oxford Online English.
🎧 In this lesson, you'll learn how to talk about the weather in English.
🎧 Do you know what it means if someone says 'it's chucking it down today'?
🎧 If someone says 'it's baking today', do you know what they are talking about?
🎧 In this class, you'll learn words, phrases and idioms that you can use to describe different kinds of weather.
🎧 British people are famous for talking about the weather.
🎧 Do you know why?
🎧 It's because in the UK we have a lot of weather.
🎧 You never know what the weather will be like.
🎧 You can have all four seasons in one day.
🎧 We are going to look at a typical British day, so the weather is going to be very changeable.
🎧 This means that weather can change quickly and unpredictably.
🎧 It can be sunny, and then 30 minutes later, it will start snowing.
🎧 So, first we wake up and it is a bit cold.
🎧 How would we describe this?
🎧 I could say that it's a bit chilly.
🎧 This means that it's a little cold.
🎧 Not very cold, just a little cold.
🎧 Autumn mornings are often chilly.
🎧 In chilly weather, you might want a light jacket, but you won't need a heavy coat, or a scarf, or anything like that.
🎧 But what if it's very cold?
🎧 You could say that it's freezing.
🎧 You might say that you can see your breath.
🎧 Freezing means that it is very cold.
🎧 Not just chilly, but very cold.
🎧 Antarctica is freezing.
🎧 Northern Canada in winter is freezing.
🎧 To see your breath means that you can literally see the air when you breathe on it.
🎧 Usually if you can see your breath it is freezing.
🎧 If the weather is so freezing that you can see your breath you probably will need to bundle up.
🎧 Bundle up means to wear layers of clothes to keep yourself warm.
🎧 When the weather is freezing you need to bundle up.
🎧 On freezing mornings, it can be very, very difficult to get out of bed.
🎧 But let's imagine that we get up because we have to go to work.
🎧 So we leave the house and it's drizzling at the moment.
🎧 Drizzling means that it is raining lightly.
🎧 It's not heavy.
🎧 Drizzle is so light that it can look like mist.
🎧 We can also say that it is only spitting.
🎧 Spitting is even lighter than drizzling.
🎧 It means that a few raindrops are falling, but it isn't really raining.
🎧 Before it rains, it might start spitting and then get heavier.
🎧 Then, suddenly the heavens open.
🎧 This means that it starts raining heavily.
🎧 How else could I describe it if it is raining a lot?
🎧 I could say that it is chucking it down.
🎧 This means that it is raining a lot.
🎧 It is really heavy.
🎧 It is the type of rain that people find it difficult to drive in or walk in.
🎧 As I am walking to work my clothes are getting soaked.
🎧 This means that my clothes are very wet because of the rain.
🎧 Luckily I bought my umbrella today.
🎧 So we get to work, only a little damp from the rain thanks to the umbrella.
🎧 Damp means that something is slightly wet.
🎧 My clothes are a little wet because of the rain.
🎧 And from my window I can see that it's very overcast and dark overhead.
🎧 To say that it is overcast means that the clouds are covering the sky.
🎧 You cannot see the sun.
🎧 When it is dark overhead you are saying that the clouds are very black.
🎧 Most likely this is because it is raining or going to rain soon.
🎧 So it is dark overhead and overcast.
🎧 You think there's going to be a storm.
🎧 You could say that there is a storm brewing.
🎧 This means that you think a storm will start very soon.
🎧 You're sure there's going to be a storm; you can see it in the sky.
🎧 And then you see lightning.
🎧 Lightning is a large electric flash of light.
🎧 And after the lightning you hear thunder.
🎧 Thunder is the noise that you hear caused by lightning.
🎧 Usually you will hear thunder after you see lightning.
🎧 We call these storms thunderstorms.
🎧 Thunderstorms are storms that have lightning, thunder and it is also chucking it down as well.
🎧 When the storm starts, the wind picks up.
🎧 Soon, it's almost a gale.
🎧 The wind picks up when the wind becomes stronger.
🎧 A gale is a very strong wind, which can be dangerous.
🎧 Lucky for you when it is time to go home the storm has finished.
🎧 It is now sunny and hot.
🎧 You won't need your umbrella anymore.
🎧 You walk outside and there isn't a cloud in the sky and it is baking hot.
🎧 This means that it is very hot.
🎧 It is baking hot in the Sahara Desert.
🎧 It's completely still.
🎧 That means there's no wind at all.
🎧 We can also say that it is a scorcher today.
🎧 This also means that it is extremely hot.
🎧 In Australia, most days in the summer could be described as scorchers.
🎧 Another way to say this is to say that it is boiling.
🎧 So if the temperature is very hot we can say that it is baking hot, a scorcher or boiling.
🎧 The walk home from work is a lot better than your walk to work this morning in the rain.
🎧 So you get home and watch the weather forecast.
🎧 The weather forecast is the prediction for the next day or week of what the weather will be like.
🎧 The weather forecast tells you that tomorrow it will begin with a bit of frost on the ground and it will be sleeting.
🎧 In the afternoon there will be flurry of snow but then it will turn into a blizzard by the evening.
🎧 The snow on the floor will turn into slush.
🎧 It will be below freezing for most of the day.
🎧 What does this mean?
🎧 It will begin with a bit of frost on the ground.
🎧 Frost are ice crystals on a frozen surface.
🎧 When it is freezing the ground may be covered in frost.
🎧 Usually in winter in the UK we have very frosty mornings.
🎧 And it will be sleeting.
🎧 Sleet is rain and snow mixed together.
🎧 Sleet happens when snow melts as it falls.
🎧 In the afternoon there will be a flurry of snow.
🎧 A flurry of snow means that there will be light snow for a short time.
🎧 It won't be heavy and it usually doesn't stay on the ground.
🎧 But it will turn into a blizzard by the evening.
🎧 A blizzard is a storm with lots of snow and wind.
🎧 Usually planes can't take off or land when there is a heavy blizzard.
🎧 The snow on the floor will turn into slush.
🎧 Slush is snow or ice that has partly melted.
🎧 Usually snow will turn into slush when the weather gets warmer.
🎧 Walking in slush is very unpleasant, because cold water will get into your shoes!
🎧 It will be below freezing for most of the day.
🎧 When we say it is below freezing we are saying that the temperature is below 0°C.
🎧 This means that it's freezing.
🎧 So I‘ll probably want to bundle up tomorrow!
🎧 So what have we learnt today?
🎧 We have learned that Britain's weather is very changeable and hopefully we have learned how to describe the weather in more detail using phrases and expressions.
🎧 Thanks very much for watching!
🎧 I hope that you have found it useful.
