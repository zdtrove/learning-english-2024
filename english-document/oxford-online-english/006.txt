🎧 Hi, I'm Gina. Welcome to Oxford Online English.
🎧 In this lesson, you can learn how to talk about your vacation in English.
🎧 Where did you go for your last holiday?
🎧 What did you do there?
🎧 Did you have a good time?
🎧 In this lesson, you'll learn how to answer these questions and more in clear, natural English.
🎧 Did you notice how Jack says 'holiday', but I said 'vacation'?
🎧 This is a difference between British and American English.
🎧 Both words have the same meaning.
🎧 Let's start with some simple language you can use to start your answer.
🎧 Begin your answer by saying where you went, who with and how long for.
🎧 For example:
🎧 I went to the countryside with my family for a couple of weeks.
🎧 I went to Thailand with a group of friends for ten days.
🎧 My girlfriend and I went to Rome for a long weekend.
🎧 A long weekend means you go for three or four days, usually Friday-Monday or Saturday-Monday, maybe because there's a public holiday on the Monday.
🎧 What about you?
🎧 Where did you go for your last vacation?
🎧 Who did you go with, and how long for?
🎧 Pause the video and make your own sentence.
🎧 If you want extra practice, write your sentence down.
🎧 If you really want extra practice, write down three different sentences!
🎧 Okay?
🎧 Next, let's see how you can talk about what you did on your holiday.
🎧 What do you like doing on holiday?
🎧 Do you prefer a more active holiday, maybe with lots of adventure sports and activities, or would you rather do something more cultural?
🎧 Or, maybe you just like relaxing on the beach.
🎧 Whatever you prefer, it's good if you can say something about how you spent your time on holiday.
🎧 Let's look at some examples and some good vocabulary for you to use:
🎧 I went to the countryside with my family for a couple of weeks.
🎧 Mostly, we went hiking in the hills and mountains nearby.
🎧 We also just hung out in the village, playing cards and eating.
🎧 Do you like hiking?
🎧 Hiking means going for longer walks, often in the hills or the mountains.
🎧 If you hang out, you spend time without having any particular goal.
🎧 If you say we just hung out in the village, you mean that you spent time there in a relaxed way.
🎧 Let's look at our second example:
🎧 I went to Thailand with a group of friends for ten days.
🎧 We did some sightseeing in Bangkok: the Grand Palace, Wat Pho and so on.
🎧 Then we hit the beaches in Krabi for some sun, swimming and cocktails!
🎧 Sightseeing means visiting the famous places in a city.
🎧 You can go sightseeing or do sightseeing.
🎧 For example, if you go sightseeing in Paris, you'd probably visit the Eiffel Tower, the
🎧 Louvre, Notre Dame and so on.
🎧 Saying we hit the beaches is a very informal way of saying we went to the beaches.
🎧 You could also say we hit the bars or we hit the clubs.
🎧 Using hit suggests you're going somewhere to party and have a good time, so you probably wouldn't use it with other places.
🎧 Let's do one more example together:
🎧 My boyfriend and I went to Rome for a long weekend.
🎧 We went on a walking tour of the centre and the Vatican.
🎧 Mostly, we went to restaurants and cafes and sampled as much of the local cuisine as we could fit in our stomachs!
🎧 If you go on a tour, for example a walking tour, you pay for a guide.
🎧 Often, tours are in big groups.
🎧 Do you prefer to go on a tour with a guide, or do you like to explore by yourself?
🎧 Sample means to try many different things.
🎧 We sampled as much of the local cuisine as we could means that we tried many different dishes.
🎧 Alright, over to you!
🎧 What did you do on your last holiday?
🎧 Did you go hiking in the mountains, go sightseeing, or sample lots of delicious food?
🎧 Try to make two or three sentences.
🎧 Use the language from this section if you can.
🎧 Pause the video now and make your answer.
🎧 Next, let's see how you can describe the place you visited in more detail.
🎧 Can you think of three adjectives to describe where you went for your last vacation?
🎧 Here, try to avoid general adjectives like nice or good.
🎧 Try to find specific adjectives.
🎧 Your answer will be more interesting!
🎧 Let's look at an example:
🎧 I went to the countryside with my family for a couple of weeks.
🎧 We stayed in a very nice village surrounded by nice mountain scenery.
🎧 Do you see what we mean?
🎧 Saying nice doesn't say much.
🎧 This isn't a very good example.
🎧 How could you make it better?
🎧 Here's one way to improve it:
🎧 I went to the countryside with my family for a couple of weeks.
🎧 We stayed in a very picturesque, sleepy village surrounded by some dramatic mountain scenery.
🎧 What do you think dramatic scenery means?
🎧 It means the mountains were very impressive and beautiful.
🎧 Picturesque is another way to say ‘beautiful'.
🎧 If something is picturesque, it's beautiful like a painting.
🎧 So you can use picturesque to talk about scenery and places.
🎧 Sleepy means that the village was very quiet and peaceful.
🎧 You can see that using more specific adjectives like picturesque, sleepy or dramatic makes your answer more interesting and expressive.
🎧 Of course, you'll need different language to talk about different places.
🎧 Let's look at another example:
🎧 I went to Thailand with a group of friends for ten days.
🎧 Bangkok is a very cosmopolitan place but it could be a little overwhelming because there was so much going on!
🎧 Then we went to Krabi, which has some stunning beaches.
🎧 Do you know the meaning of the key words in this answer?
🎧 Cosmopolitan describes a city which has many different people and cultures mixed together.
🎧 Overwhelming describes something which is very intense.
🎧 For example, a city can be overwhelming if there are lots of people, noises, sights and smells all around you.
🎧 There's so much to take in that you don't know where to look!
🎧 Stunning means ‘very beautiful'.
🎧 Let's do one more example together:
🎧 My girlfriend and I went to Rome for a long weekend.
🎧 It's a fascinating place but it's quite touristy, too.
🎧 The best thing was the food, which was out of this world.
🎧 Here, we used the adjectives fascinating, touristy and out of this world.
🎧 Could you explain what these mean?
🎧 Fascinating means ‘very interesting'.
🎧 Touristy describes a place where tourism has grown too much.
🎧 Often, if you describe a place as touristy, you mean that it's lost some of its original atmosphere.
🎧 Finally, if you describe something as out of this world, you mean it's really good and you enjoyed it very much.
🎧 Now, it's your turn.
🎧 Can you describe the place you visited on your last vacation?
🎧 You can use the adjectives and language from this section, or you can find your own words and phrases.
🎧 Try to use at least three interesting adjectives in your answer.
🎧 Pause the video and do it now, either speaking or writing.
🎧 How was that?
🎧 Remember that you can always review a section if you found something difficult.
🎧 Next, how can you talk about what you liked or disliked on your vacation?
🎧 What's the best vacation you've ever had?
🎧 What about the worst vacation you've ever been on?
🎧 What made these holidays so good or so bad?
🎧 Let's see how you can talk about the positives and negatives of your holiday.
🎧 Here's our first example:
🎧 I went to the countryside with my family for a couple of weeks.
🎧 It was relaxing but by the end I was getting quite bored.
🎧 This is good, but it's always better to add a reason if you can:
🎧 I went to the countryside with my family for a couple of weeks.
🎧 It was relaxing but by the end I was getting quite bored, because each day was pretty similar.
🎧 What does that mean, each day was pretty similar?
🎧 Do you know?
🎧 It means that you did the same kind of things each day, so there wasn't much variety from one day to the next.
🎧 Let's look at our next example:
🎧 I went to Thailand with a group of friends for ten days.
🎧 I loved Krabi, because it was like nowhere I'd ever been before.
🎧 I wasn't so keen on Bangkok.
🎧 It's a cool place but it's a bit big and noisy for my tastes.
🎧 Saying it was like nowhere I'd ever been before means that the place you went to was really unique.
🎧 You can use I wasn't so keen on… to talk about something you didn't like very much in the past.
🎧 For example:
🎧 I wasn't so keen on the food in the hotel.
🎧 I wasn't so keen on the museums—I didn't think they were very interesting.
🎧 Adding for my tastes after you give your opinion shows that this is just your perspective.
🎧 You would use it after you give a negative opinion, to soften your idea slightly.
🎧 For example:
🎧 It's a nice area, but it's too developed and touristy for my tastes.
🎧 Adding for my tastes makes this sound slightly softer and less direct.
🎧 Okay, let's do one more example together:
🎧 My girlfriend and I went to Rome for a long weekend.
🎧 I think I liked the general atmosphere most of all.
🎧 Walking around the little streets in the centre felt like being in an old film.
🎧 I wish it had been less crowded, though.
🎧 Here, you can use the phrase I liked … most of all to talk about your favourite thing from your vacation.
🎧 Use I wish plus the past perfect (had done) to talk about something in the past which you would change if you could.
🎧 For example:
🎧 I wish we'd had more time to explore the city.
🎧 I wish we hadn't stayed in that awful hotel.
🎧 Okay, your turn again!
🎧 What did you like and dislike about your last holiday?
🎧 Make at least two or three sentences, and say them out loud.
🎧 Remember to give reasons to support your ideas.
🎧 Now, you should be ready to put everything together into a longer answer.
🎧 To make a longer answer, you need to:
🎧 Say where you went, who with, and for how long.
🎧 Say what you did.
🎧 Describe the place.
🎧 Talk about what you liked and disliked.
🎧 Let's do an example using language from the lesson:
🎧 I went to Thailand with a group of friends for ten days.
🎧 We did some sightseeing in Bangkok: the Grand Palace, Wat Pho and so on.
🎧 Then we hit the beaches in Krabi for some sun, swimming and cocktails!
🎧 Bangkok is a very cosmopolitan place but it could be a little overwhelming because there was so much going on!
🎧 Krabi has some stunning beaches, and I loved it there, because it was like nowhere I'd ever been before.
🎧 On the other hand, I wasn't so keen on Bangkok.
🎧 It's a cool place but it's a bit big and noisy for my tastes.
🎧 Do you see how using simple phrases and ideas, you can build a full, clear, detailed answer?
🎧 We've added some linking words, but otherwise this is only using language you've seen in this lesson.
🎧 Let's do one more example.
🎧 This time, we'll use original ideas:
🎧 I went to Siberia by myself for three weeks.
🎧 I travelled around, did some hiking and camping, and explored the countryside.
🎧 I was near Lake Baikal, which is a huge lake with mountains and villages dotted around the sides.
🎧 It was beautiful in a wild way, and the emptiness gave me a real feeling of isolation and solitude.
🎧 I liked the people I met—everyone was so open and welcoming.
🎧 On the other hand, even though it was summer, the nights were so cold!
🎧 I wish I'd taken a warmer sleeping bag.
🎧 This time, I'm using different ideas and some different language, but I'm still following the same structure.
🎧 Now, can you make a longer answer like these?
🎧 Try it!
🎧 If it's difficult, review the video or use a dictionary to get the vocabulary you need.
🎧 Practise your answer several times, until you can do it fluently and comfortably.
🎧 You could also talk about other vacations you had, not just the last one.
🎧 If you want feedback on your answer, put it in the comments.
🎧 We'll give you feedback and show you how you can improve.
