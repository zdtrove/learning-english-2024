[001] Are you serious?

🎧 Guess what. I just got a job offer from my dream company
🎧 Are you serious?
🎧 Yes I am they called me this morning and made the offer. I can't believe it
🎧 That's incredible news. I know how much you've wanted to work there
🎧 I've been waiting for this moment for so long. It feels surreal
🎧 You totally deserve it. Your hard work and dedication have paid off
🎧 Thank you for always believing in me and encouraging me along the way
🎧 Of course. Now when do you start? Do you know what your first day will be like?
🎧 I start in two weeks and they've already sent me some information about orientation and training. I can't wait to get started
🎧 I'm so happy for you. This is going to be an amazing journey
🎧 Thanks. And I'm glad I could share this moment with you. It means a lot to me
🎧 I'm here to celebrate all your achievements with you. Let's make some plans
🎧 To celebrate this big win
🎧 Absolutely. It's going to be a great adventure ahead

[002] Post office

🎧 Hello I need to send this package to New York. Can you tell me the best way to ship it?
🎧 Sure. I can help with that. How quickly does it need to arrive?
🎧 It's not super urgent. Within a week would be fine
🎧 In that case our standard shipping would be the most cost effective option. It usually takes 3 to 5 business days
🎧 Sounds good. How much will it cost?
🎧 It depends on the weight and size of the package. Let's weight it. It comes to $15. Would you like to add tracking or insurance to your package?
🎧 Yes please add tracking
🎧 That will be an additional $2.50. Your total is $17.50. How would you like to pay?
🎧 I'll pay with my credit card
🎧 All right. I'll get this process for you. Please swipe your card here
🎧 Thank you for your help
🎧 You're welcome. Here's your receipt and tracking number. Have a great day

[003] I'll pay

🎧 I'll pay
🎧 No, I've got this one
🎧 Seriously, it's on me this time
🎧 I appreciate it, but I insist. Let me cover it
🎧 Come on, you're always footing the bill. Let me treat you for once
🎧 It's not a big deal. Plus, you covered last time
🎧 Yeah, but still, I want to return the favor
🎧 Don't worry about it. We're friends. We can treat each other once in a while
🎧 All right, but next time, it's definitely my turn
🎧 Deal. But for now, let me handle this
🎧 Fine. Fine. Thanks, man
 
[004] Diet
 
🎧 I've been thinking of starting a new diet, maybe something plant-based. Have you ever tried anything like that?
🎧 Yeah I actually went vegan for a few months last year, it was an interesting experience. Why the sudden interest?
🎧 I've been reading about the health benefits and environmental impact, but I'm not sure where to start
🎧 It's all about finding what works for you. Maybe start by incorporating more veggies and plant-based meals into your diet gradually
🎧 That sounds doable, I'm a bit worried about missing certain foods though
🎧 It's normal to have those concerns. Maybe try finding plant-based alternatives for your favorite dishes, there are so many options out there now
🎧 Good idea, do you have any recipe recommendations or tips
🎧 Sure I can send you some. Also meal planning helps a lot, keeps you on track and makes grocery shopping easier
🎧 Thanks Kevin, I appreciate the advice. I'm excited to give this a try
 
[005] I'll take it
 
🎧 I'll take it 
🎧 Are you sure? It's quite expensive 
🎧 Yeah I've been saving up for it 
🎧 All right, if you're sure it's a great choice 
🎧 Thanks I've been eyeing it for a while 
🎧 Well I'm glad you finally decided to go for it 
🎧 Me too, it's going to be worth it 
🎧 Definitely, it's a quality product 
🎧 And it'll last me a long time
🎧 Absolutely, plus, it suits you 
🎧 Thanks for your input, I appreciate it 
 
[006] I'm going to leave
 
🎧 I'm going to leave 
🎧 Oh already, it's still early 
🎧 Yeah I have some things to take care of at home 
🎧 All right, then it was great catching up with you 
🎧 Definitely, let's plan something again soon 
🎧 Absolutely, we'll make it happen, take care on your way back 
🎧 Thanks, I will have a good one 
🎧 You too, see you later 
 
[007] When pigs fly: Something that is highly unlikely to happen
 
🎧 Did you hear that Joe is planning to quit his job and start at llama Farm
🎧 Seriously, when pigs fly?
🎧 I know it sounds completely out of character for him 
🎧 He's always been a city person, I can't imagine him taking care of llamas 
🎧 It's definitely a wild idea, I wonder if he's thought it through 
🎧 I doubt it, starting a farm is is a massive undertaking and he has no experience 
🎧 Yeah it's one of those ideas that people talk about but rarely follow through with 
🎧 Exactly, I'll believe it when I see it but I wouldn't hold my breath 
🎧 It's just one of those things people say like when pigs fly you know
🎧 Right and it's highly unlikely to happen, we'll see if he actually goes through with it
 
[008] I'm cleaning my room 
 
🎧 What are you up to 
🎧 I'm cleaning my room 
🎧 Ah spring cleaning 
🎧 Yeah I've been putting it off for too long 
🎧 I know the feeling. It always feels good once it's done though
🎧 Definitely, it's just getting started. That's the hard part 
🎧 Need any help?
🎧 No, I've got it under control, thanks though
🎧 All right, just let me know if you change your mind 
🎧 We'll do, so what's new with you?
🎧 Not much, just catching up on some reading and trying to stay organized
🎧 Sounds relaxing 
🎧 Yeah it is, but I should probably tackle some cleaning too eventually 
🎧 It's that time of year I guess
 
[009] Follow English language learning blogs and channels
 
🎧 I found a gold mine for learning English. I'm following these blogs and YouTube channels dedicated to language learning. It's not the usual drill and kill grammar stuff 
🎧 Oh, do they teach you how to order coffee in Shakespearean English or what?
🎧 Actually, yes. one blogger does weekly challenges like ordering food using only movie quotes. And there's this channel where the host explores idioms through hilarious skits 
🎧 That sounds like a blast. Imagine walking into a coffee shop and saying to brew or not to brew. That is the question
🎧 Exactly, and last week I learned business English by negotiating a peace treat between aliens and humans all through role play videos 
🎧 Aliens, huh? Did the aliens agree to the terms, or did they find our business lingo too perplexing?
🎧 We reached an agreement thanks to my newfound persuasive English skills. Next up I'm diving into poetry slams. They're teaching rhythmic patterns and intonation 
🎧 Poetry Slams with English Learners? That's innovative. I'm in. Let's rhyme our way to fluency 
 
[010] I'll think about it
 
🎧 Hey, I was wondering if you'd like to join me for a weekend camping trip in the mountains 
🎧 That sounds interesting, but I'll think about it 
🎧 Come on, it'll be so much fun. We'll be surrounded by Nature, have campfires and stargaze 
🎧 It does sound tempting, but I have a lot on my plate right now and I'm not sure if I can come in
🎧 I get it. Life can get busy. Take your time to think it over. The trip is still a few weeks away 
🎧 Thanks for understanding I'll let you know as soon as I make a decision 
🎧 No pressure at all. I know these things can be spontaneous. Just know that you're always welcome if you decide to join 
🎧 I appreciate that. I'll definitely give it some thought. It sounds like a fantastic opportunity 
🎧 It really is. And it would be great to have you there. But whatever you decide, I'll support it 
🎧 Thanks for being so understanding. I'll get back to you soon with my decision 
 
[011] You're so lucky
 
🎧 Guess what! I just found out I won tickets to that sold-out concert 
🎧 Wow. You're so lucky 
🎧 I couldn't believe it when I got the email. It's like a dream come true 
🎧 That's incredible. Who are you taking with you? 
🎧 I'm thinking of taking my best friend. They're a huge fan of the band too, and I know they'll be over the moon 
🎧 That's a great choice. You're going to have an unforgettable time 
🎧 I feel incredibly fortunate. It's not every day you get the chance to see your favorite band live 
🎧 I can only imagine the energy at that concert. It's going to be epic 
🎧 I can't wait. It's going to be an unforgettable night 
🎧 Well, enjoy every moment of it. You totally deserve this stroke of luck 
🎧 Thanks, and I'll make sure to savor every note and create memories that will last a lifetime 
🎧 Have a blast. And I can't wait to hear all about it afterward 
 
[012] Collecting Things 
 
🎧 Hey, have you always been into collecting things? 
🎧 Yeah, I've been collecting stamps since I was a kid. It's a hobby I've stuck with 
🎧 That's cool. I've never really collected anything. What do you like most about it?
🎧 Well, it's like a treasure hunt. You never know what you'll come across. Plus, it's a great way to learn about different cultures through their postage 
🎧 Sounds fascinating. Do you have a favorite stamp in your collection?
🎧 Oh, I do. I have a rare one from the early 1900s with a misprint. It's worth quite a bit 
🎧 Wow. That must be valuable. How do you find these rare stamps?
🎧 Mostly through online auctions and occasionally at antique shops. It's all about patience and luck 
🎧 That's impressive. Maybe I'll start collecting something someday too
🎧 You should. It's a rewarding hobby
 
[013] Playing Basketball 
 
🎧 Hey, do you want to shoot some hoops at the park later? 
🎧 Absolutely. It's been a while since we played basketball together 
🎧 Great. I'll bring my ball and we can work on our three-pointers 
🎧 Sounds like a plan. Maybe we can also practice some dribbling and passing drills 
🎧 Sure. That will help us improve our skills. Do you remember the last time we played one on one? You beat me by just one point
🎧 Haha. It was a close game. Let's have a rematch today 
🎧 You're on. And we can invite a few more friends to make it a mini pickup game 
🎧 That's a good idea. It's always more fun with a group 
🎧 I'm looking forward to it. Let's meet at the park around 4:00 PM 
🎧 Perfect. I'll be there with my sneakers on 
 
[014] Warranty
 
🎧 Hi. I purchased this coffee maker here 6 months ago and it stopped working. I think it's still under warranty. Can I get it repaired or replaced? 
🎧 I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have the receipt or proof of purchase with you? 
🎧 Yes, I have the receipt right here. It says there's a one-year warranty on the product 
🎧 Perfect. Let me take a look. Yes, it's still under warranty. We can definitely process a repair or replacement for you. Has it suffered any physical damage? 
🎧 No. It just suddenly stopped working one morning. It hasn't been dropped or anything 
🎧 Okay, in that case, we'll send it to our service center for a checkup. If it's a manufacturing defect, we'll either repair it or provide a replacement. How long will that take? 
🎧 It usually takes about 2 weeks. We'll contact you as soon as it's ready
🎧 Great. Thank you for your help 
🎧 You're welcome. We apologize for the inconvenience 
 
[015] Delivery Service
 
🎧 I'm looking for accessories to go with my outfit for the party. What do you think of these earrings?
🎧 They're stunning. Very unique. They'll definitely make a statement 
🎧 I was thinking the same, but I'm worried they might be too bold 
🎧 I think it's okay to go bold for a party. Plus, they complement your dress well
🎧 What about a necklace?
🎧 I was considering a simple pendant. Don't want to overdo it with the earrings already making a splash 
🎧 Smart choice. A pendant would add a nice touch without being overwhelming
🎧 Great. Now I need to decide on a handbag: clutch or a small shoulder bag? 
🎧 A clutch could be more elegant for the evening. Do you have one that matches? 
🎧 Yes, I have a black set and clutch. Should work perfectly 
🎧 Sounds like you're all set then. You're going to look fantastic 
🎧 Thanks for your help, Carlos. It's always good to have a second opinion
 
[016] Practice Describing Your Day 
 
🎧 I've got a quirky idea for practicing English. What if we described our day as if we were undercover spies?
🎧 Undercover spies? That sounds intriguing. So instead of saying I went to the store, it would be more like I ventured into enemy territory to acquire supplies 
🎧 Exactly, and cooking dinner becomes devising a potion to ensure survival. It makes the mundane exciting and enriches vocabulary 
🎧 Imagine reporting a mishap. I was intercepted by the feline agent causing the liquid asset to spill over the documents. A simple case of the cat knocking over your water 
🎧 Let's take it further. Meeting a friend is now rendezvousing with an ally at the predetermined coordinates. Adds an element of drama, doesn't it? 
🎧 And to add a twist we could swap stories and guess the real activities behind the descriptions. It's a fun way to test our understanding and creativity 
🎧 This could totally change how we view our daily routines. Learning through laughter and intrigue 
🎧 I'm in. Our mission to master English just got a whole lot more exciting 
 
[017] I Have No Idea
 
🎧 Hey, have you figured out how to solve this math problem? 
🎧 Um, I have no idea. It's a tough one 
🎧 Yeah, I've been staring at it for a while and I'm completely lost
🎧 Maybe we should ask the teacher for help after class 
🎧 That's a good idea. I hate feeling so clueless about this stuff
🎧 Don't worry. We're not alone. I've overheard a few others in class saying they're struggling too 
🎧 That's a relief, I guess. But I really want to understand this concept 
🎧 Same here. Let's make a plan to study together after school. Maybe we can figure it out with a fresh perspective 
🎧 Sounds like a plan. Thanks for being willing to tackle this with me
🎧 Of course. We're in this together. We'll get through it
 
[018] Sick as a dog: very ill 
 
🎧 How's John feeling these days 
🎧 Not good at all. He's sick as a dog 
🎧 Oh, no. What happened? 
🎧 He caught a nasty flu bug and has been bedridden for week now 
🎧 That's terrible. I hope he's getting proper rest and medical attention 
🎧 Yeah, he's been to the doctor and they prescribed some medication, but it's going to take a while for him to recover fully 
🎧 Being sick as a dog can be really tough. Has anyone been helping him out at home? 
🎧 His wife has been taking care of him, making sure he's comfortable and taking his meds 
🎧 That's good to hear. It's crucial to have support when you're so ill 
🎧 Definitely. Hopefully he'll start feeling better soon and get back on his feet 
🎧 I wish him a speedy recovery. Being sick like that is never fun 
 
[019] Drugstore
 
🎧 Hello. I need some help finding a few items 
🎧 Of course, I'm happy to help. What are you looking for?
🎧 I need some allergy medication, preferably non drowsy, and a good sunscreen 
🎧 For the allergy medication, we have several options. Claritin and Zeotec are popular non drowsy choices. They're over in aisle three 
🎧 Great. I'll take a look in the sunscreen 
🎧 For sunscreen I recommend SPF 30 or high for effective protection. We have a range of brands, including some with moisturizers in R5 
🎧 Do you have any that are good for sensitive skin? 
🎧 Absolutely. Aveeno and Neutrogena have products specifically formulated for sensitive skin. They're also in R5 
🎧 Perfect. Thanks for your help. Oh, and do you have bandaids? 
🎧 Yes, they're in R2, right next to the first aid supplies 
🎧 Thank you so much for your assistance 
🎧 You're welcome. Let me know if you need anything else 
 
[020] Attending the ball
 
🎧 This ballroom looks stunning, doesn't it?
🎧 Absolutely. The decorations are magnificent and the chandeliers are breathtaking 
🎧 I can't believe we got invited to this event. It's quite the affair 
🎧 Indeed. It's quite an honor. Are you looking forward to the dance? 
🎧 I am, but I'm a bit nervous about the walts. I haven't danced in a long time 
🎧 Don't worry, it's just for fun. And the orchestra is playing beautifully 
🎧 True. The music is enchanting. By the way, have you tried the hors d'oeuvres yet? 
🎧 Yes, they're delicious. The catering is top-notch tonight 
🎧 Everything seems so extravagant. It's like a fairy tale 
🎧 It truly is a magical evening. Let's make the most of it and enjoy the ball to the fullest 
🎧 Agreed. Let's dance and savor this memorable night
 
[021] Participate in English Quizzes and Games
 
🎧 I've discovered a fantastic and entertaining way to sharpen my English, engaging in English quizzes and games.
🎧 Quizzes and games, you say, like battling in a spelling bee dressed as a bee?
🎧 Not exactly dressing up, but close. There's this app where you solve puzzles and riddles entirely in English. Last week, I diffused a virtual bomb by correctly answering grammar questions.
🎧 Diffusing bombs with grammar? Talk about high stakes. What happens if you mix up there and their?
🎧 Then it's game over. Literally. But there's more. We also had a team quiz night. My favorite round was English karaoke, where you fill in the missing lyrics.
🎧 Karaoke? I hope no virtual bombs there, just explosive laughter. Count me in for the next round!
🎧 Definitely. And next month they're launching a detective game where we solve mysteries by completing language tasks. Imagine hunting clues by conjugating verbs.
🎧 Sherlock Holmes in the land of linguistics? This is the kind of adventure I need to improve my English. 
 
[022] Taking a Cruise
 
🎧 Hey, I'm really excited about our upcoming cruise. It's my first time. Do you have any tips or advice?
🎧 Absolutely. I've been on a few cruises. First, pack light but don't forget formal wear for dinner nights. Also, seasickness can be a thing, so maybe bring some medication just in case.
🎧 Good to know. What about on board activities? Should we book them in advance?
🎧 Definitely. Popular activities and excursions can fill up fast. And download the cruise line's app if they have one. It's really handy for schedules and bookings.
🎧 Oh, that sounds useful. How about dining? Are there any must-try restaurants?
🎧 Each ship usually has its specialties. Try to experience both the buffet and sit-down restaurants. And don't miss the midnight buffet. It's a cruise classic.
🎧 This is all great advice. Thanks. I can't wait for our trip.
🎧 You're going to have a blast. Cruises are a world of their own. Enjoy!
 
[023] I Lost My Watch
 
🎧 Hey, have you seen my watch anywhere?
🎧 Your watch? No, I haven't. When did you last have it?
🎧 I think I had it on this morning before leaving for work. I've checked everywhere, but it's nowhere to be found.
🎧 Did you check the bathroom? Sometimes things get left there.
🎧 Yeah, I looked there already. It's not there either.
🎧 Hmm, maybe it fell off while you were walking or something. Have you retraced your steps?
🎧 Yeah, I walked the same route back home, but no luck.
🎧 That's frustrating. Do you remember if you had it when we were at the cafe?
🎧 I can't recall, but I'll give them a call just to be sure.
🎧 Good idea. Hopefully, they found it. If not, maybe it'll turn up somewhere unexpected.
🎧 Yeah, fingers crossed. Thanks for the suggestion. I'll let you know if I find it.
 
[024] I'm Hungry
 
🎧 Hey, how's it going?
🎧 I'm hungry. And you?
🎧 Yeah, I could definitely go for something to eat too.
🎧 Any ideas on what you want?
🎧 Not really sure. Maybe some sushi or pizza?
🎧 Both sound good to me. Let's flip a coin.
🎧 Okay. Heads for sushi, tails for pizza.
🎧 Sounds fair. *Flips coin.* It's tails. Pizza it is.
🎧 Great. Any preferences on toppings?
🎧 I'm good with anything as long as there's no pineapple.
🎧 Agreed. How about pepperoni and mushrooms?
🎧 Perfect. Let's order that.
🎧 I'll grab my phone and place the order then.
🎧 Awesome. I'll set the table while we wait.
🎧 Sounds like a plan. I'm getting even hungrier just thinking about it.
🎧 Me too. Can't wait to dig in.
🎧 All right. Order's placed. It should be here in about 30 minutes.
🎧 Perfect timing. Let's get ready to feast!
 
[025] Doing Yoga
 
🎧 Hey, have you ever tried doing yoga before?
🎧 Yeah, I've done a few yoga classes. Why do you ask?
🎧 I've been thinking about giving it a try, but I'm not sure where to start.
🎧 You should definitely give it a shot. Yoga is great for relaxation and flexibility. You can start with some beginner videos online.
🎧 That sounds like a good idea. Do you have any recommendations for a beginner like me?
🎧 Sure, there are many apps and YouTube channels with beginner-friendly routines. I can send you some links.
🎧 Thanks, I'd appreciate that. But what about the whole mindfulness aspect of yoga? Does it really help with stress?
🎧 Absolutely. The combination of physical postures and mindfulness can do wonders for reducing stress and anxiety. It's worth trying, even if it takes a little time to get into it.
🎧 All right, I'll give it a go. Thanks for the advice.
 
[026] I'm Just Kidding
 
🎧 Did you hear that the boss wants us to work over the weekend?
🎧 What? Seriously? That's insane!
🎧 Gotcha! I'm just kidding. There's no weekend work.
🎧 Oh, you scared me for a moment there. Good one!
🎧 I couldn't resist. You looked so shocked.
🎧 Well, you got me. So what's the real plan for the weekend?
🎧 No big plans, just some errands and maybe catching up on that new series.
🎧 Sounds like a plan. I could use a relaxing weekend.
🎧 Yeah, we all deserve a break now and then.
🎧 Absolutely. By the way, have you seen the latest office memo?
🎧 No, what's it about?
🎧 It's about the upcoming team-building event. They're thinking of organizing a hiking trip.
🎧 Hiking? I hope they're kidding about that one.
🎧 Haha, yeah. We'll have to see. They might surprise us.
 
[027] Taking a Break
 
🎧 Finally, a break. This day has been non-stop. How's your day going?
🎧 It's been pretty hectic too. I'm just glad to sit down for a bit. How's that project you're working on?
🎧 Oh, it's coming along. Had a few challenges, but I'm making progress. I'm looking forward to the weekend. Any plans?
🎧 Not really, just some rest and maybe a hike if the weather's good. How about you?
🎧 I'm thinking about trying that new Italian restaurant downtown. Heard they have amazing pasta.
🎧 Sounds delicious! You'll have to tell me if it's worth checking out. I could use a good pasta place.
🎧 Definitely, I'll let you know. It's nice to have this break, isn't it? Just to step back and recharge a bit.
🎧 Absolutely. Sometimes a few minutes of downtime can make all the difference. Ready to tackle the rest of the day?
🎧 Yeah, let's do this. A little break does wonders.
 
[028] Playing Chess
 
🎧 Hey, do you want to play a game of chess later?
🎧 Sure, I haven't played in a while. It'll be fun.
🎧 Great, I'll set up the board. Do you prefer white or black?
🎧 I'll take white this time.
🎧 All right. I've been trying to improve my opening strategies. Let's see if I can give you a challenge.
🎧 I'm up for it. I've been working on my endgame lately.
🎧 Perfect. We can practice different phases of the game, plus it'll be a good mental workout.
🎧 Absolutely. Chess really gets your brain working. Any particular time you want to start?
🎧 How about 7:00 pm? We can grab some snacks and make it a relaxed evening.
🎧 Sounds good to me. Let's have a friendly match and enjoy the game.
🎧 Looking forward to it.
 
[029] Barking Up the Wrong Tree
 
🎧 I heard you were asking John about the budget projections for next year.
🎧 Yeah, but it turns out I was barking up the wrong tree.
🎧 What happened?
🎧 John isn't responsible for the budget. I should have asked Sarah from the finance department.
🎧 Well, at least you figured it out. It's important to know who to approach for the right information.
🎧 Absolutely. I wasted some time and effort there.
🎧 It happens to the best of us. The key is to learn from it.
🎧 Yeah, I'll definitely double-check in the future before reaching out to someone.
🎧 It's all part of the learning process. At least now you know not to bark up the wrong tree.
🎧 True, it's a valuable lesson. Thanks for understanding.
🎧 No problem. We all make mistakes. It's how we grow and improve.
 
[030] Piece of the Pie
 
🎧 I heard the company is going public soon. Are you planning to invest?
🎧 Yeah, I've been following their progress closely. I think it's a good opportunity.
🎧 I agree. Getting a piece of the pie in an upcoming company can be lucrative.
🎧 Definitely, but I'm still doing my research on their financials and market potential.
🎧 That's a wise approach. You don't want to rush into it without knowing all the details.
🎧 Exactly. I want to make sure I'm making an informed decision.
🎧 How much of a piece of the pie are you thinking of getting?
🎧 I'm considering investing a significant portion of my portfolio, but it depends on the valuation at the IPO.
🎧 Makes sense. It's essential to strike the right balance in your investment portfolio.
🎧 Right. I'm aiming for diversification while also trying to grab a substantial piece of the pie with this one.
🎧 Well, I wish you the best of luck with your investment decision.
 
[031] Ordering
 
🎧 Have you decided what you're getting?
🎧 I think so. I'm leaning towards the steak. How about you?
🎧 I can't decide between the chicken Alfredo or the shrimp scampi.
🎧 Why don't you get the shrimp scampi? You've been craving seafood lately.
🎧 Good point. Shrimp scampi it is. Are we doing appetizers?
🎧 How about the bruschetta? It's light and sounds delicious.
🎧 Sounds good to me. Oh, and we should try the house salad too.
🎧 Agreed. Let's do that. What are you drinking?
🎧 I'll stick with water. Maybe a glass of wine with the meal. You?
🎧 I'll go with an iced tea. I'm driving, so no wine for me.
🎧 All right. I think we're ready to order. This looks like a great meal.
🎧 Definitely! I'm already hungry just thinking about it.
 
[032] Your Guess Is as Good as Mine
 
🎧 Have you heard anything about the new office location?
🎧 Not really. Your guess is as good as mine.
🎧 I thought they were supposed to announce it this week, but there hasn't been any official communication.
🎧 Yeah, I've been checking my emails, but there's been no update.
🎧 I wonder when they'll finally let us know.
🎧 It's a bit frustrating not having the information we need.
🎧 Well, at least we're in the same boat. Neither of us has an advantage in this situation.
🎧 True. We'll just have to wait and see when they decide to reveal the news.
🎧 Hopefully, it won't be much longer. I'm curious to know where the new office will be.
🎧 Agreed. Until then, your guess is as good as mine.
