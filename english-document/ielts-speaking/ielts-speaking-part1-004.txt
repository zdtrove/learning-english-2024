[031] Neighbors

1. Do you know your neighbors?
Yes, I do. My family has been living on the same block since I was born, so we've gotten to know each other quite well. We are close to my next door neighbor in particular, Ms. Elizabeth. As she's a widowed (husband died) 80 year old woman in poor health, we keep a close eye on her to make sure she's managing on her own. The other neighbors have come and gone (many new ones have moved here, many have moved away) so we aren't as close with them.

2. Do you like your neighbors?
Some of them! We are all quite fond of Miss Elizabeth; she has always been like a grandmother to me. She has always been there during our important milestones (important life stages) in life. I'm always thrilled when she turns up at our door with freshly baked banana bread. On the other hand, some of our other neighbors are quite stand-offish (unfriendly) so we tend to keep our distance. However, Miss Elizabeth is family. 

3. What do you think of your neighbors?
I think they are just so-so people. It seems as though they lead stressful daily lives and cannot be bothered (making the effort would bother them) to talk to their neighbors. They are caught up in (lost in) their own family dramas. We used to be friends with another neighbor, but then she ended up being too nosey (too interested in the lives of others), so now we just smile at her but don't share our business.

4. How often do you see (or talk to) your neighbors?
Other than Ms. Elizabeth, I just see them in passing (see briefly). So, I see them everyday but really only talk to them once or twice a week when we are forced to be in the same vicinity. For example, when I take the garbage out, we usually make small talk (talk about unimportant things, like the weather etc.)
