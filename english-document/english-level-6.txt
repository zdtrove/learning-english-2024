🎧 1. THE HAIRSTYLE CHANGE
🎧 
🎧 A different hairstyle or color can change a person's entire look. 
🎧 It can make a person look better or worse. 
🎧 Jean was about to enter her first day of college. 
🎧 She wanted a new look. 
🎧 Her current hairstyle was nice, but it was boring. 
🎧 She had it since she was a 9th grader. 
🎧 Her hair right now was straight, long, and blonde.
🎧 She went into the hair salon and asked for the hairstylist. 
🎧 What kind of look are you going for? the hairstylist asked. 
🎧 I want to look like a model, Jean said. 
🎧 Well, we can add layers to your hair. 
🎧 We can also make your hair more blonde, the hairstylist said. 
🎧 That sounds good! Jean said. 
🎧 Jean sat in the chair while the hairstylist cut her hair. 
🎧 Jean couldn't see herself in the mirror because she didn't have her glasses on. 
🎧 She just trusted the hairstylist. 
🎧 An hour later, the hairstylist said, Done! Jean put on her glasses and looked at herself. 
🎧 She looked totally different! 
🎧 She liked it, but felt strange. 
🎧 She could barely even recognize herself.
🎧 Jean asked her friends and family what they thought. 
🎧 Most of them liked it. 
🎧 They said it made her look edgier, but very different. 
🎧 In fact, when she met up with her friends, they asked who she was. 
🎧 One of them even tried calling the police when Jean showed up in front of her house.
🎧 When Jean was shopping with her friends at the mall, a model scout came up to her and asked if she would consider modeling. 
🎧 Jean said she would think about it and took his business card. 
🎧 The new hairstyle was really working out for her.

🎧 Don't worry, I will go with you! Kelly said.
🎧 All of them went to the house to the right. 
🎧 They knocked on the door and said Trick-or-treat! 
🎧 The couple smiled and gave the kids a chocolate bar.

🎧 Ophelia was shocked. 
🎧 She went to her manager and asked him why. 
🎧 He said that many night shift workers who requested an earlier shift were elderly. 
🎧 Ophelia was only 25. 
🎧 The manager thought that the older employees needed an earlier shift more than Ophelia did.
🎧 Ophelia was mad at first, but she thought about the older employees.

🎧 They do need it more than her.

🎧 She settled on dying it a lighter brown. 
🎧 Michelle also wanted to get highlights instead of dying all her hair. 
🎧 She thought that would make it look more interesting.

🎧 She decided she would cut her hair and donate her hair. 
🎧 Her hair was long enough to donate. 
🎧 Her hair had also never been dyed, so she had extremely healthy hair.

🎧 Everyone at the restaurant surrounded Roberto. 
🎧 He felt nervous. In 3-2-1 go! the waiter said.

🎧 Pamela immediately knew that she wanted to go to Harvard, but she was worried about money.

🎧 Two weeks later, she got an email from Harvard telling her what she got for financial aid. 
🎧 Pamela did not get as much aid as she hoped for. 
🎧 There are two types of financial aid: grants and loans. 
🎧 Grants are good because it is money given to you from the school that you do not have to pay back.

🎧 Harvard offered Pamela a lot of loans but not much grants. 
🎧 Pamela told her parents that she would not go to Harvard.

🎧 It costs $200 for a whole year. 
🎧 The gym has everything she needs. 
🎧 There is even a spa in the gym.

🎧 Vanessa excitedly opened the package and the dress was perfect. 
🎧 It looked exactly the way it did on the website! 
🎧 Her cousin was throwing a party on a yacht that night. 
🎧 Vanessa wanted to wear the dress for that party.
🎧 When Vanessa arrived, everyone complimented on how she looked. 
🎧 The dress was definitely worth it. 
🎧 Where did you get that dress? her cousin asked. 
🎧 tula.com, Vanessa said. 
🎧 Her cousin went on the website. 
🎧 There were only two more in the size medium and one more in the size small.
🎧 The next day, Vanessa decided to wear the same dress at her friend's dinner party. 
🎧 Hey Vanessa! Nice dress. I just bought the same one today. It was such a good price, Jan said.

🎧 Isn't that illegal? Steven asked. 
🎧 I mean yes, but everyone does it, she said. 
🎧 Not me. I think it's wrong. The movie industry loses a lot of money and that affects the employees at the theater, actors, and actresses, he said.
🎧 Actors and actresses make so much money. 
🎧 They will be fine. 
🎧 Also employees get the same hourly wage no matter what, Norma said.

🎧 That's not funny, Clarence said. 
🎧 Look, Clarence, we all want things we will never have, Shawn said. 
🎧 What do you want that you don't have? Clarence asked.

🎧 Actually, I have a B+, Roy said. 
🎧 If it isn't an A, it's not good. Besides, I don't want to study with Louise. She's a girl, he said.
🎧 I may not be the smartest person in the class, but I'm doing well, Louise said when she heard this. 
🎧 I doubt it, Michael said. 
🎧 This motivated Louise to study harder.
