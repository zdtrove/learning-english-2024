Nice to meet you, my name is An, and I'm 32 years old. 
I graduated from the University of Natural Sciences in Ho Chi Minh City with a degree in Information Technology. 
Currently, my main focus is on web development. 
I specialize in using React JS, Next JS, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
I'm also involved in projects using Nest JS and Express JS, which helps me learn different ways to create websites and apps.

My career goal is to become really good at writing code as a software engineer. 
I want to be known for creating smart solutions that solve real problems. 
I'm always learning new things and finding better ways to write code, so I stay up to date with what's happening in the tech world.

Outside of work, I love playing badminton. 
Every Saturday morning, I play with my close friends, and sometimes during the week, I visit different places to play with other people who also enjoy badminton. 
I also spend time improving my English skills because I think it's important to be able to understand and speak well in English, especially in my job.

In short, I'm really passionate about technology and always want to learn more. 
I'm working hard to be a great software engineer while also making sure I have a balanced life. 
That means enjoying sports, learning new things all the time, and discovering different cultures through learning languages.

EVERYDAY ACTIVITIES

1. Wake up at 7 AM and do personal hygiene.
2. Take the food prepared the night before out of the fridge to bring to work, and also bring a water bottle.
3. Ride a motorbike to work, which takes about 25 minutes if there's no traffic, and 35 minutes if there is traffic.
4. Arrive at work at 8 AM, park the bike in the basement of the office building, then take the elevator to the second floor.
5. At the office, I have a pair of slippers on a shelf to wear inside. When I arrive, I change from my home shoes to my office slippers.
6. After that, I scan my fingerprint to clock in. Sometimes, the fingerprint scanner has errors, and I have to scan multiple times to get it authenticated.

So, my day starts pretty early. I wake up at 7 AM, right on the dot, and the first thing I do is take care of my personal hygiene. 
You know, the usual stuff – brushing my teeth, washing my face, and getting ready for the day ahead. 
Once I'm done with that, I head to the kitchen to grab the food I prepared the night before from the fridge. 
It's super convenient to have everything ready, especially when you're in a rush. 
I also make sure to fill up my water bottle and pack it in my bag.

Then, I hop on my motorbike and start my ride to work. 
On a good day with no traffic, it takes me about 25 minutes to get there. 
But if there's traffic, which happens quite often, it can take up to 35 minutes. 
The ride itself is pretty nice, gives me some time to wake up fully and mentally prepare for the day.

I usually get to work around 8 AM. 
First thing I do is park my bike in the basement of the office building. 
After that, I head to the elevator and ride up to the second floor where our office is. 
Once I get there, I follow a company requirement – I change out of my home shoes and into a pair of slippers I keep on a shelf in the office. 
It just feels more comfortable to wear slippers while working.

After changing into my office slippers, I head over to the fingerprint scanner to clock in. 
It's a simple process, but sometimes the scanner acts up and doesn't recognize my fingerprint right away. 
So, I end up scanning it a few times until it finally works. 
It's a bit annoying, but I've gotten used to it.

And that's basically how my morning goes before I start diving into my work tasks for the day.
