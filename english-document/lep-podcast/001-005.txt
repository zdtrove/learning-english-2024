[001] Stop Comparing Yourself to Anyone

Hello everyone. Welcome to Pod Chill.
We're so happy to have you here with us today.
If this is your first time listening to Pod Chill, think of it like we are sitting together in a small coffee shop.
Yeah, a small corner, warm lights, and no need to be perfect here. It's just you, me, and Gwen. Everything is very relaxed.
And today, we want to talk about something everyone has experienced.
Something that can make your heart feel tired faster than running.
Right — and that's when comparing yourself to others.
Sound familiar?
Definitely familiar.
But today, we won't give a lecture.
Not at all. We just want to share like friends, and we hope after this episode, you'll feel a little lighter.
Okay, let's get into the topic.
Well, Gwen, do you believe that a few minutes on your phone can change your mood?
Huh? What are you talking about?
I'm talking about how people compare themselves to others online. I mean how we sometimes start looking at other people's lives online and feel like our life is not enough.
Oh, about that — I believe people often feel others' lives are better after seeing them on social media.
Yes. Like someone online got a big achievement — maybe a promotion, a popular project, or even just what looks like a perfect life in their highlight reel, right?
And that highlight reel shows only the shiny parts.
That is the trick.
You are comparing your normal life with the best moments they show. So you ask yourself, *“If I had that, would I really be happy?”*
That is the hard question.
Sometimes we do not want big success. We just see the shine from far away.
Oh, it is like watching a movie trailer and thinking you want the whole life it shows, but you do not know the full story yet.
That is why comparison comes quietly. It makes you forget that your life has important moments too. Even if they are quiet or slow, your life has its own bright moments, its own problems, its own wins.
No video can show the full story of your life.
So when you feel the need to compare, take a deep breath. See the trap, and remember your own journey is important.
Yes, the best moments they show look shiny, but your real life is more important — with both good and hard times.
But I feel that after dealing with many things in life, people forget what is behind a smile.
Yes, I see that too. When we compare, we only see the bright part.
Exactly. We do not see the hard work, the late nights, or the small steps someone took. That is why comparison can hurt. It does not see your heart or your effort.
Right? It only shows the best moments. It makes you follow a shadow.
And following a shadow is always tiring. It does not make you stronger. You do not see the hours they spent practicing or the times they wanted to stop.
That is the point. Comparison does not see all the small hard times. It only shows the bright moments. Then we think we are not enough.
Yes, like we must reach that bright thing to be happy.
But happiness does not come from only bright moments. It comes from effort too.
I'm pretty sure my mom would totally agree with that. Back then, my mom was compared to other kids a lot, but she didn't care.
That already shows your mom has a strong personality.
Yeah, something like that. But she really believed in herself and did her best at that time. She always told herself, *“Look at your own steps, your own work.”*
Wow, your mom is amazing. That is a good idea.
Ah, sometimes talking with a friend helps too.
Yes, a friend can comfort you and make you feel really calm inside, because real love sees the heart, not only the shine.
Comparison does the opposite. It makes your heart heavy.
So when you see it, stop for a moment and breathe. Think about your own effort, your own wins.
Those are real. Even if quiet, they are yours — not someone else's best moments. Only we can understand the moments inside ourselves.
And here is the thing: every journey has its hidden chapters.
Hidden chapters — that sounds magical. I like that. Tell me more.
These are just the parts of life people do not show. The days they had problems, the nights they felt tired or unsure, the times they almost gave up.
Oh, so while we see the best and shiny moments they show, we don't see all the steps, the mistakes, and the effort behind it.
That makes a lot of sense.
I remember my friend posting about their trip around the world, and it looked perfect on Instagram.
Exactly. But I didn't know they had worked extra hours for months to save money, and they were probably very tired at times, right?
Yes, completely. But on the outside, it looks like a perfect life.
That's why comparison tricks us. We forget that every life has parts we cannot see.
And honestly, we cannot understand all someone else's hidden chapters.
So thinking too much about other people's lives just wastes our energy.
Much better to focus on our own hidden chapters — the effort and challenges we face every day.
Yes, even if nobody sees them, they shape us.
And those hidden chapters are what make our story real and strong.
So whenever you feel pulled into comparing, remember hidden chapters exist for everyone.
Exactly. That's a good way to start appreciating your own journey more.
And it gives us a natural step into the next thought: how we often measure ourselves unfairly.
True.
Wow, Gwen, I feel like our chat is making me think a lot.
Me too. And maybe our friends need a small pause to breathe.
That's a good idea. Let's take a little break.
Yes. Stretch a bit. Relax your shoulders. Maybe get a drink.

Okay, deep breath. Feel a little lighter?
I hope so. And now, let's get back to the conversation.
Right. Before the break, we talked about hidden chapters.
Yes, those unseen moments that make everyone's story real.
But here is the hard part. After seeing other people's shiny moments, we often compare ourselves in the wrong way.
That is true. We see our messy middle — the small problems we face every day — and compare them with someone else's success.
But nobody sees the hard work, the mistakes, or the stress they had.
And if we try to get the same results, we often feel unhappy.
Meanwhile, they are enjoying their success, smiling, and living their life — and we are still trying to catch up.
So what happens to us?
Stress, tiredness, maybe even sadness.
Yes, and it is not good for your heart.
Your heart needs kindness, not pressure from wrong comparisons.
That is why we need to stop and remember that we are on our own journey.
Comparing yourself with someone else's highlight is never fair.
When you understand this, it is easier to breathe and follow your own path.
But some of us still cannot stop thinking, *“I'm behind in life,”* right?
Yeah, that one never feels good.
But here's the thing: different speed doesn't mean slow.
People sometimes say others are “broken.”
I hate that word. It feels like a lazy label people use when they don't understand someone's life.
It's like they think everyone must live the same way.
Me too. And it's wrong. You are not broken just because your life moves differently from others.
Everyone has things others don't see — worries, family problems, healing, learning — and people forget that.
Yeah. That's why comparing is not fair.
So my speed is just my speed.
Yes, it is your life. No need to compare.
But life does not always go straight, right?
Of course not. Some days we move forward, some days we move very little.
Oh, and sometimes we are just trying to survive the day, not win anything.
Yep. That's still part of the journey.
So none of that means something's wrong with me.
Not at all.
People who call others broken often cannot accept their own good and bad days.
Can you explain more?
You know, it's easier for them to judge someone else than to face their own fears — fear of failing or going slowly.
That actually makes a lot of sense.
As long as you keep the desire to move forward, even slowly, you're not falling behind.
So the important thing is the direction, not the pace.
Exactly. You're not broken. You're growing.
Agreed.
Growth isn't always big or loud. It may be small, quiet, and slow — but it still matters.
We move fast, we stop, or even restart from zero. That's the process of growing.
Hm. If we're talking about growing, how do we measure it?
Growth seems like it should always be moving, right?
Well, yes, growth keeps going, but it doesn't mean you have to hurry all the time.
Sometimes growing is quiet and hard to notice, like learning to be patient or being kinder to yourself.
True. Those small things don't look big, but they change how we live every day.
Sometimes that quiet change is even stronger than big steps.
But sometimes I feel like if I'm not moving fast, I'm missing something.
That's exactly why I like this idea: *your pace is your path.*
Ah, the classic — but very real.
It makes me feel lighter. It shows me I don't have to follow someone else's speed.
Yeah. You can move slowly if you need to, and that's okay.
Your pace is your path, and your path is special because it belongs to you.
I like that. It's like saying no one else can walk your path for you.
Even when people give advice or try to compare, they don't really know what we feel or what we're trying to learn inside.
Well said. And growth doesn't follow a map.
Sometimes you grow a lot in one week, sometimes in one month, sometimes it takes years — and that's fine.
Success doesn't have only one meaning.
Right? In this world, there are many jobs and many ways to live.
So success can look very different for each person.
One person's dream might be building a family.
Another's might be traveling the world.
And another might find it in quiet days reading books at home,
or even just learning to take care of yourself every day.
That is also a big success.
And that reminds me — not all progress can be seen by others.
Right. Your progress is still important even if others don't notice.
The key is finding your own path, not someone else's path.
And that path — however slow or winding — is special because it's yours.
Gwen, I noticed one thing people don't see when they compare themselves.
Do you know what that is?
What's that?
Well, when people compare themselves, they often miss what is happening in their own life.
Even small things — a quiet morning, a walk outside, or a smile from a friend — can be very meaningful.
Oh, right. Those small moments are actually special.
They are experiences only you can have from your own view.
Your view is unique because no one else lives your life like you do.
No one else feels the sunlight through your window or tastes your morning coffee like you do.
Comparison tricks the mind.
It makes people chase moments that are not theirs and miss the moments that really belong to them.
Normal days are important.
Even if nothing special happens, they create the flow of life — little joys and small successes.
Noticing these moments can make you happier than always chasing other people's success.
Laughing at a small mistake, watching the sunset, or sitting quietly with a cup of tea —
these moments are calm and very valuable, right?
They show that your life is yours.
Your story, your speed, your experiences. No one else can take that from you.
When you feel like comparing yourself, pause and notice the normal moments around you.
They are special.
It helps you grow with more peace, without always measuring yourself against someone else.
And when we notice our simple moments, it also makes us think about how we see ourselves.
True. And I think that connects to confidence — not loud confidence, but something quiet and strong.
Yes. Quiet confidence is different from showing off or trying to be better than others.
It grows slowly inside you when you stop looking at others all the time.
It's about trusting your own steps instead of trying to run faster than someone else.
Exactly.
For example, I have a friend who used to feel small every time she checked social media.
She always compared her work with others and thought she was not good enough.
That sounds stressful.
Very stressful.
But then she started paying attention to her own progress, even if it was small.
She stopped copying anyone else's achievements.
And what happened?
She grew a lot. Her projects got better.
She felt proud and even got noticed at work — all because she stopped measuring herself by someone else's life.
Wow, that's great.
Quiet confidence is calm and works well.
Yes, and it lasts longer.
It makes decisions easier because you trust yourself.
It calms your mind because you don't need to compete with everyone else.
I see. It's like having a compass inside you that shows your own way instead of following other people's maps.
Exactly.
And the good part is, it helps even when life gets messy.
You can face hard days because you believe in yourself.
That's better than chasing someone else's success and feeling tired all the time.
Yes. Quiet confidence lets you move forward while keeping peace in your heart.
It grows with you — even when life is slow, confusing, or full of mistakes.
The more you practice this, the less you compare yourself to others.
You feel stronger being yourself.
That's right.
And when you feel that, you start seeing progress you never noticed before —
small wins, quiet successes, moments when you handled things well.
All of these matter.
So quiet confidence really gives you space to grow your life in your own way, without watching what others do.
Exactly. That is why it is worth building little by little, day by day.
So guys, comparison is never a good friend — especially when you compare yourself to others.
The friend who is always with you is yourself, and the loved ones around you.
So why give our peace to comparison, right?
Loving yourself and your efforts matters more.
Even small progress from yesterday counts.
Yes. Growth takes time.
Like a tree — little winds are important.
Seeing your quiet strength helps a lot.
And your journey is only yours. No one else can live it for you.
Celebrate yourself a bit each day.
Quiet confidence grows slowly, but it stays.
Thanks for listening and letting us share.
Take care of your heart and mind.
See you next time on Pod Chill. This is Gwen.
Bye. Keep noticing your little winds and growing your way.
I'm Leo, your chill friend.
