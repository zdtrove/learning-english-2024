🎧 Hello, Flanders conference hotel.
🎧 Oh, hi. I wanted to ask about conference facilities at the hotel.
🎧 Have I come through to the right person?
🎧 Hmm... You have. I'm the customer services manager.
🎧 My name's Angela.
🎧 So how can I help you?
🎧 Well, I'm calling from Barrett and Stansons,
🎧 we're a medical company based in Perth.
🎧 Oh yes.
🎧 And we're organising a conference for our clients to be held in Sydney.
🎧 It'll be held over two days and we're expecting about fifty or sixty people.
🎧 When were you thinking of having it?
🎧 Some time early next year, like the end of January?
🎧 It'd have to be a weekend.
🎧 Ah... let me see…
🎧 our conference facilities are already booked for the weekend beginning January the 28th.
🎧 We could do the first weekend in February?
🎧 How about January the 21st?
🎧 Oh.. I'm afraid that's booked too.
🎧 Well, let's go for the February date then.
🎧 So that's the weekend beginning the 4th.
🎧 OK.
🎧 Now can you tell me a bit about what conference facilities you have?
🎧 Sure.
🎧 So for talks and presentations we have the Tesla room.
🎧 Sorry?
🎧 Tesla - that's spelled TESLA.
🎧 it holds up to a hundred people,
🎧 and it's fully equipped with a projector and so on.
🎧 How about a microphone?
🎧 Yes, that'll be all set up ready for you,
🎧 and there'll be one that members of the audience can use too, for questions, if necessary.
🎧 Fine.
🎧 And we'll also need some sort of open area where people can sit and have a cup of coffee,
🎧 and we'd like to have an exhibition of our products and services there as well,
🎧 so that'll need to be quite a big space.
🎧 That's fine,
🎧 there's a central atrium with all those facilities,
🎧 and you can come before the conference starts if you want to set everything up.
🎧 Great.
🎧 And I presume there's wifi?
🎧 Oh yes, that's free and available throughout the hotel.
🎧 OK.
🎧 Would you also like us to provide a buffet lunch?
🎧 We can do a two-course meal with a number of different options.
🎧 What sort of price are we looking at for that?
🎧 Well, I can send you a copy of the standard menu.
🎧 That's $45 per person.
🎧 Or you can have the special for $25 more.
🎧 I think the standard should be OK, but yes, send me the menu.
🎧 Now we're also going to need accommodation on the Saturday night for some of the participants…
🎧 I'm not sure how many, but probably about 25.
🎧 So what do you charge for a room?
🎧 Well, for conference attendees we have a 25% reduction,
🎧 so we can offer you rooms at $135.
🎧 Normally a standard room's $180.
🎧 And does that include breakfast?
🎧 Sure.
🎧 And of course, guests can also make use of all the other facilities at the hotel.
🎧 So we've got a spa where you can get massages and facials and so on,
🎧 and there's a pool up on the roof for the use of guests.
🎧 Ah... great.
🎧 Now what about transport links?
🎧 The hotel's downtown, isn't it?
🎧 Yes, it's about 12 kilometres from the airport,
🎧 but there's a complimentary shuttle bus for guests.
🎧 And it's only about ten minutes' walk from the central railway station.
🎧 OK.
🎧 Now, I don't know Sydney very well,
🎧 can you just give me an idea of the location of the hotel?
🎧 Ah... well, it's downtown on Wilby Street,
🎧 ah... that's quite a small street, and it's not very far from the sea.
🎧 And of course if the conference attendees want to go out on the Saturday evening,
🎧 there's a huge choice of places to eat.
🎧 Then if they want to make a night of it,
🎧 they can go on to one of the clubs in the area -
🎧 there are a great many to choose from.
🎧 OK.
🎧 So if we go ahead with this,
🎧 Can you give me some information about how much…
🎧 
🎧 Good morning.
🎧 My name's Lucy Crittenden,
🎧 and I'm the Director of Operations for an organisation that arranges volunteering in this part of the country.
🎧 I'm hoping I can persuade one or two of you to become volunteers yourselves.
🎧 Let me start by briefly explaining what we mean by volunteering.
🎧 Volunteers are teenagers and adults who choose to spend some time, unpaid, helping other people in some way.
🎧 Most volunteers devote two or three hours to this every week, while a few do much more.
🎧 The people they help may have physical or behavioural difficulties, for example.
🎧 Volunteers can do all sorts of things, depending on their own abilities and interests.
🎧 If they're supporting a family that's struggling, for example,
🎧 they may be able to give them tips on cooking,
🎧 or recommend how to plan their budget
🎧 or how to shop sensibly on their income.
🎧 They might even do some painting or wallpapering,
🎧 perhaps alongside any members of the family who are able to do it.
🎧 Or even do some babysitting so that parents can go out for a while.
🎧 The benefit from volunteering isn't only for the people being helped.
🎧 Volunteers also gain from it:
🎧 they're using their skills to cope with somebody's mental or physical ill health,
🎧 and volunteering may be a valuable element of their CV when they're applying for jobs:
🎧 employers usually look favourably on someone who's given up time to help others.
🎧 Significantly, most volunteers feel that what they're doing gives them a purpose in their lives.
🎧 And in my opinion, they're lucky in that respect,
🎧 as many people don't have that feeling.
🎧 Now I'd like to tell you what some of our volunteers have said about what they do,
🎧 to give you an idea of the range of ways in which they can help people.
🎧 Habib supports an elderly lady who's beginning to show signs of dementia.
🎧 Once a week they, along with other elderly people, go to the local community centre,
🎧 where a group of people come in and sing.
🎧 The songs take the listeners back to their youth,
🎧 and for a little while they can forget the difficulties that they face now.
🎧 Our volunteer Consuela is an amazing woman.
🎧 She has difficulty walking herself, but she doesn't let that stop her.
🎧 She helps a couple of people with similar difficulties,
🎧 who had almost stopped walking altogether.
🎧 By using herself as an example,
🎧 Consuela encourages them to walk more and more.
🎧 Minh visits a young man who lives alone and can't leave his home on his own,
🎧 so he hardly ever saw anyone.
🎧 But together they go out to the cinema,
🎧 or to see friends the young man hadn't been able to visit for a long time.
🎧 Tanya visits an elderly woman once a week.
🎧 When the woman found out that Tanya is a professional dressmaker, she got interested.
🎧 Tanya showed her some soft toys she'd made,
🎧 and the woman decided to try it herself.
🎧 And now she really enjoys it, and spends hours making toys.
🎧 They're not perhaps up to Tanya's standard yet,
🎧 but she gains a lot of pleasure from doing it.
🎧 Alexei is a volunteer with a family that faces a number of difficulties.
🎧 By calmly talking over possible solutions with family members,
🎧 he's helping them to realise that they aren't helpless,
🎧 and that they can do something themselves to improve their situation.
🎧 This has been great for their self-esteem.
🎧 And the last volunteer I'll mention, though there are plenty more, is Juba.
🎧 She volunteers with a teenage girl with learning difficulties,
🎧 who wasn't very good at talking to other people.
🎧 Juba's worked very patiently with her,
🎧 and now the girl is far better at expressing herself,
🎧 and at understanding other people.
🎧 OK, I hope that's given you an idea of what volunteering is all about.
🎧 Now I'd like…
🎧 
🎧 So how are you getting on with your teaching practice at the High School, Joe?
🎧 Well I've been put in charge of the school marching band, and it's quite a responsibility.
🎧 I'd like to talk it over with you.
🎧 Go ahead.
🎧 You'd better start by giving me a bit of background.
🎧 OK.
🎧 Well the band has students in it from all years,
🎧 so they're aged 11 to 18, and there are about 50 of them altogether.
🎧 It's quite a popular activity within the school.
🎧 I've never worked with a band of more than 20 before, and this is very different.
🎧 I can imagine.
🎧 They aren't really good enough to enter national band competitions,
🎧 but they're in a regional one later in the term.
🎧 Even if they don't win, and I don't expect them to,
🎧 hopefully it'll be an incentive for them to try and improve.
🎧 Yes, hopefully.
🎧 Well, now the town council's organising a carnival in the summer,
🎧 and the band has been asked to perform.
🎧 If you ask me, they aren't really up to it yet,
🎧 and I need to get them functioning better as a band, and in a very short time.
🎧 Have you been doing anything with them?
🎧 Apart from practising the music, I mean.
🎧 I played a recording I came across,
🎧 of a drummer talking about how playing in a band had changed his life.
🎧 I think it was an after-dinner speech.
🎧 I thought it was pretty inspiring,
🎧 because being in the band had stopped him from getting involved in crime.
🎧 The students seemed to find it interesting, too.
🎧 That's good.
🎧 I'm planning to show them that old film from the 1940s 'Strike Up the Band',
🎧 and talk about it with the students.
🎧 What do you think?
🎧 Good idea.
🎧 As it's about a school band, it might make the students realise how much they can achieve if they work together.
🎧 That's what I've got in mind.
🎧 I'm hoping I can take some of the band to a parade that's going to take place next month.
🎧 A couple of marching bands will be performing, and the atmosphere should be quite exciting.
🎧 It depends on whether I can persuade the school to hire a coach or two to take us there.
🎧 They sound like good ideas to me.
🎧 Thanks.
🎧 Can I tell you about a few people in the band who I'm finding it quite difficult to cope with?
🎧 I'm sure you'll have some ideas about what I can do.
🎧 Go ahead.
🎧 There's a flautist who says she loves playing in the band.
🎧 We rehearse twice a week after school, but she's hardly ever there.
🎧 Then she looks for me the next day and gives me a very plausible reason -
🎧 she says she had to help her mother, or she's been ill,
🎧 but to be honest, I don't believe her.
🎧 Oh dear!
🎧 Any more students with difficulties?
🎧 Plenty!
🎧 There's a trumpeter who thinks she's the best musician in the band, though she certainly isn't.
🎧 She's always saying what she thinks other people should do, which makes my job pretty difficult.
🎧 She sounds a bit of a nightmare!
🎧 You can say that again.
🎧 Uh... one of the trombonists has got an impressive sense of rhythm,
🎧 and could be an excellent musician -
🎧 except that he has breathing difficulties,
🎧 and he doesn't really have enough breath for the trombone.
🎧 He'd be much better off playing percussion, for instance, but he refuses to give up.
🎧 So he ends up only playing half the notes.
🎧 I suppose you have to admire his determination.
🎧 Maybe.
🎧 One of the percussionists isn't too bad,
🎧 but he never seems to interact with other people,
🎧 and he always rushes off as soon as the rehearsal ends.
🎧 I don't know if there are family reasons, or what.
🎧 But it isn't good in a band, where people really need to feel they're part of a group.
🎧 There are others too, but at least that gives you an idea of what I'm up against.
🎧 Do you have any thoughts about what I can do, Lizzie?
🎧 
🎧 As you all know, the university is planning an arts festival for later this year,
🎧 and here in the music department we've planned three concerts.
🎧 These will be public performances, and the programme has just been finalised.
🎧 The theme of the festival is links between the UK and Australia,
🎧 and this is reflected in the music:
🎧 each concert will feature both British and Australian composers.
🎧 I'll tell you briefly about the Australian music,
🎧 as you probably won't be familiar with that.
🎧 The first concert will include music by Liza Lim,
🎧 who was born in Perth, Western Australia, in 1966.
🎧 As a child, Lim originally learned to play the piano - like so many children -
🎧 and also the violin.
🎧 But when she was 11 her teachers encouraged her to start composing.
🎧 She found this was her real strength,
🎧 and she studied and later taught composition,
🎧 both in Australia and in other countries.
🎧 As a composer, she has received commissions from numerous orchestras,
🎧 other performers and festivals in several countries.
🎧 Liza Lim's compositions are vibrant and full of energy,
🎧 and she often explores Asian and Australian Aboriginal cultural sources,
🎧 including the native instrument, the didgeridoo:
🎧 this is featured in a work called The Compass.
🎧 Her music is very expressive,
🎧 so although it is complex,
🎧 it has the power of connecting with audiences and performers alike.
🎧 In the festival we're going to give a semi-staged performance of The Oresteia.
🎧 This is an opera in seven parts,
🎧 based on the trilogy of ancient Greek tragedies by Aeschylus.
🎧 Lim composed this when she was in her mid-20s,
🎧 and she also wrote the text, along with Barrie Kosky.
🎧 It's performed by six singers, a dancer,
🎧 and an orchestra that, as well as standard orchestral instruments, includes electric guitar,
🎧 and a traditional Turkish stringed instrument.
🎧 Lim wrote that because the stories in the tragedies are not easy to tell,
🎧 the sounds she creates are also disturbing,
🎧 and they include breathing, sobbing, laughing and whistling.
🎧 The work lasts around 75 minutes,
🎧 and the rest of the concert will consist of orchestral works by the British composers
🎧 Ralph Vaughan Williams and Frederick Delius.
🎧 Moving on now to our second concert,
🎧 this will begin with instrumental music by British composers - Benjamin Britten and Judith Weir.
🎧 After the interval we'll go to Australia for a piece by Ross Edwards:
🎧 The Tower of Remoteness.
🎧 According to Edwards, the inspiration for this piece came from nature,
🎧 when he was sitting alone in the dry bed of a creek,
🎧 overshadowed by the leaves of palm trees,
🎧 listening to the birds and insects.
🎧 The Tower of Remoteness is scored for piano and clarinet.
🎧 Edwards says he realised years after writing the piece
🎧 that he had subconsciously modelled its opening phrase on a bird call.
🎧 Ross Edwards was born in 1943 in Sydney, Australia,
🎧 and studied at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music
🎧 and the universities of Adelaide and Sydney.
🎧 He's well known in Australia,
🎧 and in fact he's one of the country's most performed composers.
🎧 He's written a wide range of music,
🎧 from symphonies and concertos to some composed specifically for children.
🎧 Edwards's music has been described as being 'deeply connected to Australia',
🎧 and it can be regarded as a celebration of the diversity of cultures that Australia can be proud of.
🎧 The last of the three Australian composers to be represented in our festival is Carl Vine.
🎧 Born in 1954, Vine, like Liza Lim, comes from Perth, Western Australia.
🎧 He took up the cornet at the age of five, switching to the piano five years later.
🎧 However, he went to university to study physics, before changing to composition.
🎧 After graduating he moved to Sydney and worked as a freelance pianist and composer.
🎧 Before long he had become prominent in Australia as a composer for dance,
🎧 and in fact has written 25 scores of that type.
🎧 In our third concert,
🎧 Vine will be represented by his music for the flag hand-over ceremony of the Olympics held in 1996.
🎧 This seven-minute orchestral piece was of course heard by millions of people worldwide,
🎧 and we'll hear it alongside works written by British composers Edward Elgar and, more recently, Thomas Adès.
