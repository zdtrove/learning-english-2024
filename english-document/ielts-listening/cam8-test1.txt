[081] Cam8 - Test 1 - Part 1

🎧 Hi, George!
🎧 Glad you're back.
🎧 Loads of people have phoned you.
🎧 Really?
🎧 I felt just like your secretary!
🎧 Sorry!
🎧 I went into the library this afternoon to have a look at a newspaper and I came across something really interesting.
🎧 What? A book?
🎧 No, a brochure from a summer festival - mainly Spanish music.
🎧 Look, I've got it here.
🎧 Spanish music?
🎧 I really love the guitar.
🎧 Let's have a look.
🎧 So what's this group 'Guitarrini'?
🎧 They're really good.
🎧 They had a video with all the highlights of the festival at a stand in the lobby to the library,
🎧 so I heard them.
🎧 They play fantastic instruments - drums and flutes and old kinds of guitars.
🎧 I've never heard anything like it before.
🎧 Sounds great.
🎧 Okay. Shall we go then?
🎧 Spoil ourselves?
🎧 Yes, let's.
🎧 The only problem is there aren't any cheap seats…
🎧 it's all one price.
🎧 Well, in that case we could sit right at the front -
🎧 we'd have a really good view.
🎧 Yeah, though I think that if you sit at the back you can actually hear the whole thing better.
🎧 Yes, anyway we can decide when we get there.
🎧 So will you fill in the form or shall I?
🎧 I'll do it.
🎧 Name: George O'Neill.
🎧 Address:
🎧 48 North Avenue, Westsea.
🎧 Do you remember our new postcode?
🎧 Still can't remember it.
🎧 Just a minute, I've got it written down here.
🎧 WS62YH
🎧 Do you need the phone too?
🎧 Please.
🎧 I'm really bad at numbers.
🎧 01674553242.
🎧 So, let's book two tickets for Guitarrini.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 If you're sure 7.50 each is alright.
🎧 How do you feel about the singer?
🎧 I haven't quite decided.
🎧 But I've noticed something on the booking form that might just persuade me!
🎧 What's that then?
🎧 Free refreshments!
🎧 Really?
🎧 Yes, look here.
🎧 Sunday 17th of June.
🎧 Singer, ticket £6 includes drinks in the garden.
🎧 Sounds like a bargain to me!
🎧 Yes, let's book two tickets for that.
🎧 So, what else?
🎧 I'm feeling quite keen now!
🎧 How about the pianist on the 22nd of June?
🎧 Anna Ventura?
🎧 I've just remembered that's my evening class night.
🎧 That's okay.
🎧 I'll just have to go on my own -
🎧 but we can go to the Spanish dance and guitar concert together, can't we?
🎧 Yes - I'm sure Tom and Kieran would enjoy that too.
🎧 Good heavens - £10.50 a ticket!
🎧 I can see we're going to have to go without food for the rest of the week -
🎧 we'll need to book four!
🎧 Wish we were students - look!
🎧 Children, students and senior citizens get a 50% discount on everything.
🎧 If only!

[082] Cam8 - Test 1 - Part 2

🎧 Hello, and thank you for asking me to your teachers' meeting to talk about the Dinosaur Museum
🎧 and to tell you a bit about what you can do with your students there.
🎧 Well, let me give you some of the basic information first.
🎧 In regard to opening hours,
🎧 we're open every day of the week from 9 am to 8 pm
🎧 except on Mondays when we close at 1.30 pm.
🎧 And, in fact the only day in the year when we're closed is on the 25th of December.
🎧 You can book a guided tour for your school group any time that we're open.
🎧 If you bring a school group to the museum,
🎧 when you arrive we ask you to remain with your group in the car park.
🎧 One or more of the tour guides will welcome you there
🎧 and brief you about what the tour will be about.
🎧 We do this there because our entrance is quite small
🎧 and we really haven't got much room for briefing groups in the exhibition area.
🎧 As far as the amount of time you'll need goes,
🎧 if you bring a school group,
🎧 you should plan on allowing a minimum of 90 minutes for the visit.
🎧 This allows 15 minutes to get on and off the coach,
🎧 45 minutes for the guided tour
🎧 and 30 minutes for after-tour activities.
🎧 If you're going to have lunch at the museum,
🎧 you will, of course, have to allow more time.
🎧 There are two cafés in the museum, with seating for 80 people.
🎧 If you want to eat there you'll need to reserve some seating,
🎧 as they can get quite crowded at lunch time.
🎧 Then outside the museum at the back there are tables,
🎧 and students can bring their own lunch and eat it there in the open air.
🎧 When the students come into the museum foyer,
🎧 we ask them to check in their backpacks with their books, lunch boxes, etc, at the cloakroom
🎧 before they enter the museum proper.
🎧 I'm afraid in the past, we have had a few things gone missing after school visits,
🎧 so this is a strict rule.
🎧 Also, some of the exhibits are fragile
🎧 and we don't want them to be accidentally knocked.
🎧 But we do provide school students with handouts with questions and quizzes on them.
🎧 There's so much that students can learn in the museum
🎧 and it's fun for them to have something to do.
🎧 Of course, they'll need to bring something to write with for these.
🎧 We do allow students to take photographs.
🎧 For students who are doing projects
🎧 it's useful to make some kind of visual record of what they see
🎧 that they can add to their reports.
🎧 And finally, they should not bring anything to eat into the museum,
🎧 or drinks of any kind.
🎧 There are also a few things the students can do after the tour.
🎧 In the threatrette on the ground floor,
🎧 there are continuous screenings of short documentaries about dinosaurs which they can see at any time.
🎧 We used to have an activity room with more interactive things like making models of dinosaurs
🎧 and drawing and painting pictures, even hunting for dinosaur eggs,
🎧 but, unfortunately, the room was damaged in a bad storm recently when water came in the roof,
🎧 so that's closed at the moment.
🎧 But we do have an IT centre
🎧 where students have access to CD ROMs with a range of dinosaur games.
🎧 These games are a lot of fun,
🎧 but they also teach the students about the lives of dinosaurs,
🎧 how they found food, protected their habitat, survived threats, that kind of thing.
🎧 And… I think that's all I have to tell you.
🎧 Please feel free to ask any questions if you would like to know anything else…

[083] Cam8 - Test 1 - Part 3

🎧 Right, Sandra.
🎧 You wanted to see me to get some feedback on your group's proposal.
🎧 The one you're submitting for the Geography Society field trip competition.
🎧 I've had a look through your proposal and I think it's a really good choice.
🎧 In fact, I only have a few things to say about it, but...
🎧 even in an outline document like this,
🎧 you really have to be careful to avoid typos and problems with layout in the proposal,
🎧 and even in the contents page.
🎧 So read it through carefully before submitting it, okay?
🎧 Will do.
🎧 And, I've made a few notes on the proposal about things which could have been better sequenced.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 As for the writing itself,
🎧 I've annotated the proposal as and where I thought it could be improved.
🎧 Generally speaking, I feel you've often used complex structures and long sentences for the sake of it
🎧 and as a consequence….
🎧 although your paragraphing and inclusion of sub-headings help…
🎧 it's quite hard to follow your train of thought at times.
🎧 So cut them down a bit, can you?
🎧 Really?
🎧 Yes. And don't forget simple formatting like numbering.
🎧 Didn't I use page numbers?
🎧 I didn't mean that.
🎧 Look, you've remembered to include headers and footers, which is good,
🎧 but listing ideas clearly is important.
🎧 Number them or use bullet points, which is even clearer.
🎧 Then you'll focus the reader on your main points.
🎧 I thought your suggestion to go to the Navajo Tribal Park was a very good idea.
🎧 I've always wanted to go there.
🎧 My father was a great fan of cowboy films and the Wild West
🎧 so I was subjected to seeing all the epics,
🎧 many of which were shot there.
🎧 As a consequence, it feels very familiar to me
🎧 and it's awesome both geographically and visually,
🎧 so it's somewhere I've always wanted to visit.
🎧 The subsequent research I did
🎧 and the online photographs made me even keener.
🎧 Interesting.
🎧 Right, let's look at the content of your proposal now.
🎧 Did you find it comprehensive enough?
🎧 Well, yes and no.
🎧 You've listed several different topics on your contents page,
🎧 but I'm not sure they're all relevant.
🎧 No?
🎧 Well, I thought that from the perspective of a field trip,
🎧 one thing I needed to focus on was the sandstone plateau and cliffs themselves.
🎧 The way they tower up from the flat landscape is just amazing.
🎧 The fact that the surrounding softer rocks were eroded by wind and rain,
🎧 leaving these huge outcrops high above the plain.
🎧 It's hardly surprising that tourists flock to see the area.
🎧 Well, yes.
🎧 I'd agree with including those points…
🎧 And then the fact that it's been home to native American Navajos
🎧 and all the social history that goes with that.
🎧 The hardships they endured trying to save their territory from the invading settlers.
🎧 Their culture is so rich - all those wonderful stories.
🎧 Well, I agree it's interesting, but...
🎧 it's not immediately relevant to your proposal, Sandra, so...
🎧 at this stage, I suggest you focus on other considerations.
🎧 I think an indication of what the students on the trip could actually do when they get there
🎧 should be far more central,
🎧 so that certainly needs to be included and to be expanded upon.
🎧 And I'd like to see something about the local wildlife, and vegetation too,
🎧 not that I imagine there's much to see.
🎧 Presumably the tourist invasion hasn't helped.
🎧 Okay, I'll do some work on those two areas as well.
🎧 But you're right, there's not much apart from some very shallow-rooted species.
🎧 Although it's cold and snowy there in the winter,
🎧 the earth is baked so hard in the summer sun that rainwater can't penetrate.
🎧 So it's a case of flood or drought, really.
🎧 So, I understand.
🎧 Now, before we look at everything in more detail,
🎧 I've got a few factual questions for you.
🎧 It would be a good idea to include the answers in your finished proposal,
🎧 because they're missing from your draft.
🎧 Fine.
🎧 So, you mentioned the monoliths and the spires, which was good,
🎧 but what area does the tribal park cover?
🎧 Do you know?
🎧 12,000 hectares,
🎧 and the plain is at about 5,850 metres above sea level.
🎧 Larger than I expected.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 Where's the nearest accommodation?
🎧 That's a practical detail that you haven't included.
🎧 Have you done any research on that?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 There's nowhere to stay in the park itself,
🎧 but there's an old trading post called Goulding quite near.
🎧 All kinds of tours start from Goulding, too.
🎧 What kind of tours?
🎧 Well, the most popular are in four-wheel drive jeeps -
🎧 but I wouldn't recommend hiring those.
🎧 I think the best way to appreciate the area would be to hire horses instead
🎧 and trek around on those.
🎧 Biking is not allowed
🎧 and it's impossible to drive around the area in private vehicles.
🎧 The tracks are too rough.
🎧 Okay, lastly. What else is worth visiting there?
🎧 There are several caves,
🎧 but I haven't looked into any details.
🎧 I'll find out about them.
🎧 Okay, good.
🎧 Now what I'd like to know is…

[084] Cam8 - Test 1 - Part 4

🎧 So, welcome to your introductory geography lecture.
🎧 We'll begin with some basics.
🎧 Firstly, what do we learn by studying geography?
🎧 Well, we learn a great deal about all the processes
🎧 that have affected and that continue to affect the earth's surface.
🎧 But we learn far more than that,
🎧 because studying geography also informs us about the different kinds of relationships
🎧 that develop between a particular environment and the people that live there.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 We like to think of geography as having two main branches.
🎧 There's the study of the nature of our planet -
🎧 its physical features, what it actually looks like -
🎧 and then there's the study of the ways in which we choose to live
🎧 and of the impact of those on our planet.
🎧 Our current use of carbon fuels is a good example of that.
🎧 But there are more specific study areas to consider too,
🎧 and we'll be looking at each of these in turn throughout this semester.
🎧 These include bio-physical geography,
🎧 by which I mean the study of the natural environment and all its living things.
🎧 Then there's topography -
🎧 that looks at the shapes of the land and oceans.
🎧 There's the study of political geography and social geography too, of course,
🎧 which is the study of communities of people.
🎧 We have economic geography -
🎧 in which we examine all kinds of resource and their use - agriculture, for example.
🎧 Next comes historical geography -
🎧 the understanding of how people and their environments
🎧 and the ways they interact have changed over a period of time -
🎧 and urban geography,
🎧 an aspect I'm particularly interested in,
🎧 which takes as its focus: the location of cities,
🎧 the services that those cities provide.
🎧 and migration of people to and from such cities.
🎧 And lastly, we have cartography.
🎧 That's the art and science of map-making.
🎧 You'll be doing a lot of that!
🎧 So, to summarise before we continue,
🎧 we now have our key answer…
🎧 studying this subject is important
🎧 because without geographical knowledge, we would know very little about our surroundings
🎧 and we wouldn't be able to identify all the problems that relate to them.
🎧 So, by definition, we wouldn't be in an informed position to work out how to solve any of them.
🎧 Okay, now for some practicalities.
🎧 What do geographers actually do?
🎧 Well, we collect data to begin with!
🎧 You'll be doing a lot of that on your first field trip!
🎧 How do we do this?
🎧 There are several means.
🎧 We might, for example, conduct a census -
🎧 count a population in a given area perhaps.
🎧 We also need images of the earth's surface
🎧 which we can produce by means of computer-generation technology
🎧 or with the help of satellite relays.
🎧 We've come a very long way from the early exploration of the world by sailing ships
🎧 when geographers only had pens and paper at their disposal.
🎧 After we've gathered our information, we must analyse it!
🎧 We need to look for patterns, most commonly those of causes and consequences.
🎧 This kind of information helps us to predict and resolve problems that could affect the world we live in.
🎧 But we don't keep all this information confidential.
🎧 We then need to publish our findings so that other people can access it and be informed by it.
🎧 And one way which this information can be published is in the form of maps.
🎧 You'll all have used one at some stage of your life already.
🎧 Let's consider the benefits of maps from a geographer's perspective.
🎧 Maps can be folded and put in a pocket
🎧 and can provide a great store of reference when they're collected into an atlas.
🎧 They can depict the physical features of the entire planet if necessary,
🎧 or just a small part of it in much greater detail.
🎧 But there is a drawback.
🎧 You can't exactly replicate something that is three-dimensional, like our planet, on a flat piece of paper,
🎧 because paper has only two dimensions,
🎧 and that means there'll always be a certain degree of distortion on a map.
🎧 It can't be avoided.
🎧 We can also use aerial photographs…
🎧 pictures taken by cameras at high altitude above the earth.
🎧 These are great for showing all kinds of geographical features that are not easy to see from the ground.
🎧 You can easily illustrate areas of diseased trees or how much traffic is on the road at a given time
🎧 or information about deep sea beds, for example.
🎧 Then there are Landsats.
🎧 These are satellites that circle the earth
🎧 and transmit visual information to computers at receiving stations.
🎧 They circle the earth several times a day
🎧 and can provide a mass of information -
🎧 you'll all be familiar with the information they give us about the weather, for example.
🎧 So, what we're going to do now is look at a short presentation…
