🎧 Hello?
🎧 Hi, good morning, this is Talia from Parrot Bay Travel Agency.
🎧 Is Robert Goddard there?
🎧 Yes, speaking.
🎧 I'm so sorry that I made such an early phone call,
🎧 and I'm calling to ask a few questions about your most recent vacation.
🎧 Could I have five minutes of your time?
🎧 Sure thing.
🎧 Great, thanks.
🎧 Now, I see here that you visited Melbourne.
🎧 Was this your first visit to Melbourne?
🎧 No, I have actually been there twice before.
🎧 I see.
🎧 Now, what would you say was your favorite part about Melbourne?
🎧 Well, I did like seeing the exotic wildlife,
🎧 and there are great sites to see,
🎧 but I have to say I was most impressed by the amazing weather.
🎧 Yeah, the weather there is amazing.
🎧 Which of the sites listed as part of our official tour did you see,
🎧 and of those, which was your favorite?
🎧 First I saw the theatre, which was beautifully designed.
🎧 It was not nearly as cool as the Town Hall though -
🎧 the building is a huge part of Melbourne's history.
🎧 Definitely my favourite.
🎧 I saw the aquarium too, but wasn't too impressed.
🎧 I see.
🎧 Yes, people often have great reviews of Town Hall.
🎧 Now I would like to ask you about your dining experience.
🎧 Did you enjoy the food there?
🎧 Absolutely, I loved it!
🎧 I'm glad to hear it.
🎧 Could you tell me a little bit about what you most enjoyed about the food?
🎧 Being such an international city, I loved the variety -
🎧 I could find any type of food I wanted.
🎧 Whether I wanted seafood, burgers, or anything else, you name it and they had it.
🎧 Did you drive to Melbourne?
🎧 No, I flew.
🎧 I thought about going by train,
🎧 but in the interest of time I decided to go by plane.
🎧 Right, I see.
🎧 And would you mind telling me whether you are under 20,
🎧 between the ages of 20 and 40, or older than 40?
🎧 Er, it would be nice if I were still under 20.
🎧 My vacation probably would have been quite different.
🎧 Actually though, I just turned 41 last week.
🎧 Oh, happy birthday!
🎧 So did you treat yourself and fly first class?
🎧 Ha! No way.
🎧 I would love to have a budget that high.
🎧 I'm more in the mid-range income level.
🎧 I wasn't always though - I spent much of my life in a low-income household.
🎧 I see.
🎧 That answers my next question then, of income level.
🎧 And what was the purpose of this visit?
🎧 I had to go there on business a lot before and decided I would go there for tourism this time.
🎧 I see.
🎧 And what is your occupation?
🎧 I am mainly a computer programmer.
🎧 I also write for a travel magazine on the side,
🎧 which is why I visited Melbourne before,
🎧 but it's not my main source of income.
🎧 I see.
🎧 Wow, it sounds like you work a lot!
🎧 Yes, I am very busy,
🎧 which is exactly why I took a nice week-long vacation to Melbourne.
🎧 I completely agree.
🎧 Would you care to comment on your accommodation?
🎧 My hotel was a good value.
🎧 Staying in the city can get really expensive,
🎧 so it was nice to find such a good price for the location and quality.
🎧 I'm glad I didn't end up in some cheap motel in the middle of nowhere.
🎧 I'm glad you didn't either.
🎧 Well, thank you for taking part in our survey,
🎧 and I'm glad you enjoyed your vacation!
🎧 No problem. Take care!
🎧 
🎧 Thank you all for coming to our community meeting.
🎧 As you know, we are excited to unveil our improvement plan as we look forward to the influx of tourists in the summer months.
🎧 I'll start with a quick overview of the main points of interest in the area
🎧 for anyone who may not quite know his or her way around yet,
🎧 and then I'll get into the improvements made.
🎧 First off is my favorite, the Science Museum,
🎧 which is on the corner of Saint George Road.
🎧 If you have not visited it yet, I encourage you to go before the busy season.
🎧 It is absolutely spectacular -
🎧 there is even a flight simulator you can try out!
🎧 Just west of the Science Museum is the National History Museum.
🎧 It's a site not to be missed as well,
🎧 with each floor devoted to a different era in our nation's history.
🎧 There are special exhibits for children with interactive games and fun history lessons, too.
🎧 If you're looking for parking, it is available on the intersection of Queen Street and South King Street in the Car Park.
🎧 Standard hourly and daily rates do apply.
🎧 The best place for souvenirs is the Shopping Mall,
🎧 though it gets extremely busy during peak times.
🎧 You can get there from the tube, or the entrance on Timber Road,
🎧 just south of Cornwell Road.
🎧 This area has students everywhere,
🎧 usually from the Primary School across the street from the Shopping Mall.
🎧 Classes often take field trips and engage in guided tours through the area.
🎧 So that's the overview of the main sites
🎧 and hopefully by now I've given you a general idea of the area.
🎧 Now I'm going to outline the improvements we have made in our efforts to make the experience even better
🎧 for each and every one of our visitors.
🎧 You probably noticed when you first drove into the Car Park this morning,
🎧 that there is now additional signage to help avoid confusion.
🎧 The directions were not entirely clear at first,
🎧 so we have increased the number of one-way signs indicating the correct direction of traffic flow.
🎧 Not far from there, in line with our mission of giving back to the community,
🎧 we constructed a brand new playground for the Primary School.
🎧 It is really something to be excited for -
🎧 the equipment is state-of-the-art and includes swings, a small climbing wall, and even an obstacle course.
🎧 Now we'll head north and take a look at the Science Museum.
🎧 In response to our feedback from past visitors to the museum,
🎧 there is now free information available outlining not only upcoming IMAX showings,
🎧 but also natural wonders like meteor showers, eclipses, and other cool natural events.
🎧 The Science Museum isn't the only Museum improving the experience of its visitors.
🎧 The National History Museum has added an entire new wing to its facility
🎧 to accommodate the large crowds of people gathering to see the Civil War exhibit,
🎧 inventions timeline exhibit, and other wonderful sections of the museum.
🎧 The increase in space will definitely give a more calm, comfortable experience for visitors.
🎧 And finally, remember when there was actually a line at the mall entrance from the Tube Station?
🎧 It was terrible trying to get anywhere from the Tube
🎧 because foot traffic got so backed up sometimes.
🎧 We have addressed that by adding another entry point into the mall from the other end of the platform to disperse the crowd.
🎧 So those are the major improvements we have made.
🎧 Clearly having too many people that want to visit and enjoy what our community has to offer the public is a good problem to have,
🎧 and I am confident that we have made the changes necessary to accommodate the growing interest in the area.
🎧 As always, we welcome any questions, comments, or concerns about the new improvement plan.
🎧 In a few minutes I will open up the floor for questions
🎧 but you can also contact me or any other board member by email or through the city website.
🎧 Thank you for coming,
🎧 and I now encourage you to stay for the Questions and Answers panel occurring between now and…
🎧 
🎧 So you were both given your project assignments for your senior thesis today, right?
🎧 Yes, and we already have to submit our topics next week!
🎧 But how could they give us a grade this soon?
🎧 No, next week's due date will not be counted towards your final grade.
🎧 The teachers are just going to read your topic and give you feedback.
🎧 Oh, I see.
🎧 So first we should come up with our topics, and then what?
🎧 Well, once you know what you want to study,
🎧 you need to think about how you'll study it.
🎧 You need to decide on your research methods.
🎧 The methods will be the main part of your paper.
🎧 What about the results section?
🎧 Well, I can give you feedback on that,
🎧 but you will be the one carrying out an experiment
🎧 and thus will have to produce the results on your own.
🎧 What I would like to do today is practice writing research papers before you even begin your report.
🎧 I'll give you samples of old data from past experience.
🎧 And you can practice writing results and drawing conclusions.
🎧 I think that would be really helpful.
🎧 Yeah, it sounds like a lot of extra work,
🎧 but I'm sure it would make our actual project easier.
🎧 You're exactly right!
🎧 So let's get started.
🎧 First, let's try this simple experiment on fruit flies.
🎧 Read the information, and then take 25 minutes to summarise a results and conclusion section.
🎧 That's really important - pay attention to the time limit.
🎧 OK, does it still have to be 6,000 words?
🎧 No, don't worry about that.
🎧 What if we get off topic?
🎧 I wouldn't worry too much -
🎧 you will have so much information to write about
🎧 that it should be easy to stay on topic.
🎧 But what about other sources?
🎧 Well for this assignment, you can use the one from your textbook.
🎧 In your actual paper, you should find old experiments that support your topic.
🎧 So do we need to find different types of sources?
🎧 For instance, should I be conducting lots of interviews to use in my paper?
🎧 No, there's no need to conduct lots of interviews or anything like that.
🎧 OK, I'm ready to get started.
🎧 I'm still a little confused though, on how we should format our paper.
🎧 Don't worry about it for now,
🎧 but on your final paper, make sure to pay attention to the format.
🎧 It should follow the guidelines exactly.
🎧 Oh man, I'm starting to understand why they give us all semester to do this.
🎧 Are there any other small details like that that we should know about?
🎧 Not a whole lot,
🎧 make sure you provide two copies - one for your teacher of course,
🎧 but one for yourself as well.
🎧 And of course, you know the due date, right?
🎧 Uh, it's April the 11th, right?
🎧 What? No!
🎧 It's May 11th. Right?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 The due date is May 11.
🎧 Write it down!
🎧 Oh wow. Yeah, I need to note it.
🎧 Also, I'm having trouble finding information on my topic.
🎧 What if I can't find enough good sources?
🎧 It's alright to change your topic.
🎧 Just make sure to do it before the beginning of April.
🎧 Oh really?
🎧 Wow, I'm definitely going to change it then.
🎧 Just make sure to write a note to your teacher letting him or her know.
🎧 Okay. So getting back to writing this sample paper, where do we start?
🎧 Should I just explain the experiment and what happened?
🎧 Well, you need to start with your hypothesis -
🎧 what you think will happen -
🎧 and then describe your procedure.
🎧 Then you can write up the results and your conclusions.
🎧 Oh boy, I don't know if I can handle any more instructions…
🎧 
🎧 Hello class, and welcome back to Marketing Strategies.
🎧 This week I will expand upon last week's lecture by talking about factors you should consider
🎧 when creating advertising materials and the effects they can have on your product sales.
🎧 Lesson one: limit your advertising to the geographic area of your target market.
🎧 Though you may have a product that people want in a large area,
🎧 the distance that customers are willing to travel is a significant factor in their choice of where to purchase that product.
🎧 Take this example:
🎧 if you are really hungry and decide you want a burrito,
🎧 would you choose the restaurant that is a block from your apartment,
🎧 or the one that is just as good - or even slightly better - across town?
🎧 Of course you'll pick the closer restaurant.
🎧 Next, there's the method of communication to your target market.
🎧 How do you decide among radio ads, TV commercials, fliers,
🎧 or even word of mouth?
🎧 While we often think of the visual presentation of ads,
🎧 there is much more to advertising than the look.
🎧 Studies show that consumers are much more likely to remember advertising slogans
🎧 if there is also a sound played.
🎧 Did you know that your sense of smell is closely linked with memory?
🎧 Think about Mandy's Candy Store up the road.
🎧 Every time you walk past it, you can just smell the chocolate, right?
🎧 I bet you can almost smell it now.
🎧 Just mentioning the name brings about the smell memory,
🎧 and in turn a chocolate craving.
🎧 What better way to sell chocolate bars?
🎧 Obviously sometimes appealing to the senses isn't the most practical way to advertise.
🎧 For example, it is a good idea to come up with a marketing strategy that adapts to the product,
🎧 especially digital products.
🎧 The flexibility of this kind of products is extremely important,
🎧 so it is very common for advertisers to form one single layout for all of their ads -
🎧 the visual, the medium, even the majority of the content -
🎧 and simply update the ad each time they come out with a new version.
🎧 Remember, advertising is all about stirring up the right feeling in your potential customers,
🎧 whether by stimulating the senses, appealing to the intellect, and so on.
🎧 Once the customer experiences the ad,
🎧 the important thing is his or her reaction.
🎧 Someone could love the ad you made,
🎧 but unless he or she considers buying the product,
🎧 you have failed to get the reaction you were looking for.
🎧 So once you have successfully reached your target customer
🎧 and you have his or her business,
🎧 often you will want to expand to a larger market.
🎧 More often than not, the same marketing strategies you used in your small campaign
🎧 may not work for a larger audience.
🎧 The larger you scale your product, the more factors you must consider.
🎧 For instance, Apple operates worldwide,
🎧 so they must tailor their advertising for each market they enter.
🎧 Often you'll see Apple ads on international flights that appear not only in English,
🎧 which is the lingua franca of most regions,
🎧 but also in the native language of the majority of passengers.
🎧 I traveled to Russia last week,
🎧 and it was really interesting to see the same Nike ad that I have seen a hundred times -
🎧 except this time it was in Russian!
🎧 Okay, going back to the medium of the advertisement,
🎧 even after choosing to create print ads
🎧 (instead of radio announcements, television commercials, etc)
🎧 there is more to consider.
🎧 If you print your ad in a newspaper,
🎧 it will be read by a far different audience than if you print your ad in a popular magazine.
🎧 Would you put an ad for the new Justin Bieber album in a newspaper?
🎧 Probably not, because that product is most suitable for youths.
🎧 Let's face it - do you know anyone under the age of 25 that buys a newspaper?
🎧 Now let's try a few strategy exercises.
🎧 Imagine you are a company that is aiming to improve the environment by making products that reduce human waste.
🎧 How would you advertise your product?
🎧 Clearly it would send the wrong message if you put up fliers or other materials that cause lots of waste paper.
🎧 Consider instead putting commercials on the Health Channel, or buying ad space on websites like UNESCO.
🎧 Or here's another example: What is one great place to advertise suntan lotion?
🎧 How about a swimming pool?
🎧 It has the exact group of people that need the product.
🎧 Alright, one last thing.
🎧 Let's say you're filming a commercial for a water filter pitcher.
🎧 What would be good scenery to use for the background?
🎧 Think about somewhere calm and relaxing with clean, fresh water.
🎧 Can't you see how much more effective a commercial with the beautiful scenery and flowing rivers of a national park would be
🎧 than, say, water dripping from a tap?
🎧 So to wrap things up today,
🎧 think about the geography of your target market,
🎧 the type of marketing material you should use,
🎧 and the most effective way to appeal to the customer in order to make a successful ad campaign.
🎧 That is all I have for you today.
🎧 Make sure to read through chapter 8 for Monday if you have not done so already.
🎧 OK, now I'd be happy to answer...
