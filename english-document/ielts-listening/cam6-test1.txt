🎧 Good morning, oh sorry, it's gone 12, I'll start again,
🎧 good afternoon, Kingswell Sports Club, how can I help you?
🎧 Oh, good afternoon.
🎧 I was wondering if you could give me some information about membership and facilities.
🎧 Of course.
🎧 What would you like to know?
🎧 Do you have tennis courts, for example?
🎧 No, I'm afraid we don't.
🎧 We're primarily a golf club.
🎧 What about football?
🎧 I heard you had a team.
🎧 No, I'm sorry.
🎧 Perhaps you're thinking about Fresham Sports Centre.
🎧 Oh, right.
🎧 I know it.
🎧 I've played badminton there.
🎧 Have you?
🎧 They've got a lot of facilities we don't have and vice versa.
🎧 We do have a keep-fit studio, which is very popular with members,
🎧 and then as well as that there's swimming, of course.
🎧 That's good. I like to swim every day.
🎧 We have a range of classes too.
🎧 Do you have judo classes?
🎧 I'm keen to learn.
🎧 Well, at the moment, we offer kick-boxing.
🎧 We're planning to add judo and stretch classes soon.
🎧 We're currently running a range of yoga classes, too.
🎧 What about relaxing after exercise?
🎧 I assume you have a restaurant or something.
🎧 At the moment, we've got a salad bar which is very popular.
🎧 We'll also have a fully-licensed restaurant by the end of the year.
🎧 Sounds good!
🎧 What kind of membership are you interested in?
🎧 Um... I'm not really sure.
🎧 What are the options?
🎧 Well, there are three different membership schemes.
🎧 I see. What's the difference?
🎧 Well, the first one's called Gold,
🎧 and you can use all the facilities at any time of the day or week.
🎧 You can also join in as many classes as you like for free.
🎧 That sounds good.
🎧 Is it very expensive?
🎧 Well, you pay a £250 joining fee
🎧 and then it's 450 - oh no, I'm sorry,
🎧 it's just gone up by £50, sorry about that -
🎧 it's now £500 for the annual subscription fee.
🎧 Right, got that.
🎧 And what's the next type?
🎧 Well, that's Silver -
🎧 it's the same as Gold except you have to pay a small fee of £1.00 per lesson for any you do
🎧 and you can only use the centre at certain times.
🎧 I see. So when exactly?
🎧 You can only use the facilities between 10 am and 4.30 pm.
🎧 So I couldn't use the pool at 8 in the morning or evening, then?
🎧 That's right.
🎧 Okay. And the price for that?
🎧 Is the joining fee the same as for Gold?
🎧 Actually, it's slightly less than the £250 -
🎧 it's £225,
🎧 but the annual fee is only £300.
🎧 Does that sound more like what you want?
🎧 Well, it's still rather more expensive than I thought.
🎧 I'm a student here in England and I'm only here for six months.
🎧 Ah, then the Bronze scheme would probably suit you best.
🎧 How is that different?
🎧 Well, some of the facilities have restricted use.
🎧 And do I have to pay for classes?
🎧 Yes, it's £3 for each class you join.
🎧 I see. And what are the hours then?
🎧 Between 10.30 and 3.30 weekdays only
🎧 and you pay a £50 joining fee.
🎧 The annual fee is £180 -
🎧 it works out at £15 a month, so...
🎧 that would be quite a lot cheaper.
🎧 Oh, that should be all right.
🎧 I could come in my free periods.
🎧 What do I have to do if I want to join?
🎧 Well, we book you in for an assessment with an instructor,
🎧 who will show you how to use all the equipment.
🎧 If you want to organise a trial session and look around the centre,
🎧 you'll need to speak to David Kynchley.
🎧 Could you spell that please?
🎧 Yes, David KYNCHLEY.
🎧 I'll give you his direct line number.
🎧 It's 045895311.
🎧 Thanks.
🎧 Thank you for calling Kingswell Sports Club.

🎧 And here on Radio Rivenden we have Lynne Rawley, the Public Relations Officer of our own Rivenden City Theatre.
🎧 Hello, Lynne.
🎧 Hello.
🎧 Now, the theatre is reopening soon after its three-year redevelopment programme, isn't it?
🎧 That's right, and there are a lot of improvements.
🎧 The first thing people will see when they go in
🎧 is that the foyer has been repainted in the original green and gold.
🎧 Then the box office has been reoriented, with its own access from the side of the building instead of through the foyer,
🎧 which means it can be open longer hours, and has more space, too.
🎧 The shop that used to be in the foyer, which sold books and CDs,
🎧 is the one part of the redevelopment which isn't yet complete.
🎧 The plan is to find new premises for it near the theatre,
🎧 and we've had difficulty finding somewhere suitable.
🎧 We hope to reopen the shop in the next few months.
🎧 Will audiences find any difference in the auditorium?
🎧 Yes, we've increased the leg-room between the rows.
🎧 This means that there are now fewer seats
🎧 but we're sure audiences will be much happier.
🎧 And we've installed air conditioning, so it won't get so hot and stuffy.
🎧 We already had a few seats which were suitable for wheelchair users,
🎧 and now there are twice as many, which we hope will meet demand.
🎧 Something else that will benefit audiences is the new lifts.
🎧 The two we used to have were very small and slow.
🎧 They've now gone, and we've got much more efficient ones.
🎧 Anything for the performers?
🎧 Yes, we've made a number of improvements backstage.
🎧 The small, dark dressing rooms we used to have have been converted into two large airy rooms,
🎧 so they're much more comfortable now.
🎧 And the state-of-the-art electronic sound and lighting systems have been installed.
🎧 Okay, so what's the first play that audiences can see when the theatre reopens?
🎧 We've got a very exciting production of Peter Shaffer's Royal Hunt of the Sun, which is currently touring the country.
🎧 That starts on October the 13th and runs till the 19th.
🎧 We're experimenting a bit with the time the curtain goes up.
🎧 We used to start all our performances at 7.30,
🎧 but that made it difficult for people to go home by public transport,
🎧 so instead, we're beginning at 7,
🎧 because at 9.45, when it finishes, there are still buses running.
🎧 Tickets are already selling fast.
🎧 The Friday and Saturday performances sold out almost immediately
🎧 and, in fact, now there are only tickets for Monday and Thursday.
🎧 How much are they?
🎧 We've introduced a simpler price structure.
🎧 Ticket prices used to range from £6 to £30
🎧 but now they're all £18.
🎧 They're available from the box office, in person, by phone, fax or post, or online.
🎧 Okay, Lynne, now if you'd like to give the contact details...

[051] Cam6 - Test 1 - Part 3

🎧 Hi, can I help you?
🎧 I was told to come here, because I'd like to talk to someone about taking a management course.
🎧 Right. I'm one of the tutors, so I should be able to help you.
🎧 Oh, good.
🎧 My name's Brian Ardley.
🎧 I've decided to enroll on a part time management course.
🎧 A friend of mine took one last year, and recommended it to me.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Is there anything I should do before the course, like reading or anything?
🎧 We prefer to integrate reading with the course,
🎧 so we don't give out a reading list in advance.
🎧 But we like people to write a case study, describing an organisation they know.
🎧 I've already done that, as my friends told me you wanted one.
🎧 But would it be possible to sit in on a teaching session, to see what it's like?
🎧 I haven't been a student for quite a while.
🎧 Fine.
🎧 Just let me know which date, and I'll arrange it with the tutor.
🎧 Now, could I ask you about the college facilities, please?
🎧 Anything in particular?
🎧 Well, the course is one day a week, all day, isn't it?
🎧 So presumably it's possible to buy food?
🎧 Yes, the refectory's open all day.
🎧 Does it cater for special diets? I have some food allergies.
🎧 Provided you warn the refectory in advance, it won't be a problem.
🎧 Good.
🎧 What about facilities for young children?
🎧 I'd like to bring my daughter here while I'm studying.
🎧 How old is she?
🎧 Three.
🎧 Then she's eligible to join the nursery,
🎧 which is supervised by a qualified Nursery Nurse.
🎧 The waiting list for a place is quite long though, so you ought to apply now.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 I don't know if our careers advice service would be of any interest to you?
🎧 Yes, it might help me decide how to develop my career after the course.
🎧 The centre has a lot of reference materials, and staff qualified to give guidance on a one-to-one basis.
🎧 I noticed a fitness centre next to the college.
🎧 Is that for students?
🎧 It's open to everyone, but students pay an annual fee that's much less than the general public pay.
🎧 And presumably the college library stocks newspapers and journals, as well as books?
🎧 Yes, and there's also an audio-visual room, for viewing and listening to videos, cassettes, and so on.
🎧 Is there also access to computers?
🎧 Yes, your tutor will need to arrange with the technical support team for you to get a password,
🎧 so ask him or her about it when you start the course.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 By the way, do you know about our Business Centre?
🎧 No, What's that?
🎧 It's a training resource - a collection of materials for people to study on their own, or use in their own organisations.
🎧 You mean books and videos?
🎧 Yes, and manuals for self-study.
🎧 Plus a lot of computer-based materials, so people can work through them at their own speed,
🎧 and repeat anything they aren't sure about.
🎧 And you can hire laptops to use in your own home or workplace
🎧 as well as printers that you can take away.
🎧 Does it have anything that I could use to improve my study skills?
🎧 I don't have much idea about report writing,
🎧 and I'm sure I'll need it on the course.
🎧 Oh yes, there's plenty of useful material. Just ask one of the staff.
🎧 Does the centre cover all the main areas of business?
🎧 Yes, topics like finance, and of course marketing - that's a popular one.
🎧 Local managers seem to queue up to borrow the videos!
🎧 So it isn't just for students, then?
🎧 No, it's for members only, but anyone can join.
🎧 How much does it cost?
🎧 £100 a year for a company,
🎧 and £50 for an individual, with no discount for students, I'm afraid.
🎧 That's very helpful.
🎧 Well, I think that's all.
🎧 I'd better go home and fill in the enrollment form.
🎧 Thanks for all your help.
🎧 You're welcome.
🎧 Goodbye.
🎧 Goodbye.

[052] Cam6 - Test 1 - Part 4

🎧 In the last few weeks, we've been looking at various aspects of the social history of London,
🎧 and this morning we're continuing with a look at life in the area called the East End.
🎧 I'll start with a brief history of the district,
🎧 and then focus on life in the first half of the twentieth century.
🎧 Back in the first to the fourth centuries AD,
🎧 when the Romans controlled England,
🎧 London grew into a town of 45,000 people,
🎧 and what's now the East End -
🎧 the area by the river Thames, and along the road heading north-east from London to the coast -
🎧 consisted of farmland with crops and livestock
🎧 which helped to feed that population.
🎧 The Romans left in 410, at the beginning of the fifth century,
🎧 and from then onwards, the country suffered a series of invasions by tribes from present-day Germany and Denmark,
🎧 the Angles, Saxons and Jutes, many of whom settled in the East End.
🎧 The technology they introduced meant that metal and leather goods were produced there for the first time.
🎧 And as the East End was by the river,
🎧 ships could transport goods between there and foreign markets.
🎧 In the 11th century, in 1066 to be precise,
🎧 the Normans conquered England,
🎧 and during the next few centuries London became one of the most powerful and prosperous cities in Europe.
🎧 The East End benefited from this,
🎧 and because there were fewer restrictions there than in the city itself,
🎧 plenty of newcomers settled there from abroad,
🎧 bringing their skills as workers, merchants or money-lenders during the next few hundred years.
🎧 In the 16th century, the first dock was dug
🎧 where ships were constructed, eventually making the East End the focus of massive international trade.
🎧 And in the late 16th century,
🎧 when much of the rest of England was suffering economically,
🎧 a lot of agricultural workers came to the East End to look for alternative work.
🎧 In the seventeenth century, the East End was still a series of separate, semi-rural settlements.
🎧 There was a shortage of accommodation,
🎧 so marshland was drained and built on to house the large numbers of people now living there.
🎧 By the 19th century, London was the busiest port in the world,
🎧 and this became the main source of employment in the East End.
🎧 Those who could afford to live in more pleasant surroundings moved out,
🎧 and the area became one where the vast majority of people lived in extreme poverty,
🎧 and suffered from appalling sanitary conditions.
🎧 That brief outline takes us to the beginning of the 20th century,
🎧 and now we'll turn to housing.
🎧 At the beginning of the century,
🎧 living conditions for the majority of working people in East London were very basic indeed.
🎧 Houses were crowded closely together
🎧 and usually very badly built, because there was no regulation.
🎧 But the poor and needy were attracted by the possibility of work,
🎧 and they had to be housed.
🎧 It was the availability, rather than the condition, of the housing
🎧 that was the major concern for tenants and landlords alike.
🎧 Few houses had electricity at this time,
🎧 so other sources of power were used, like coal for the fires which heated perhaps just one room.
🎧 Of course, the smoke from these contributed a great deal to the air pollution
🎧 for which London used to be famous.
🎧 A tiny, damp, unhealthy house like this might well be occupied by two full families,
🎧 possibly including several children, grandparents, aunts and uncles.
🎧 Now, before I go on to health implications of this way of life,
🎧 I'll say something about food and nutrition.
