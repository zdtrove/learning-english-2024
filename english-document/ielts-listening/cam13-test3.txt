🎧 Hello, Linda speaking.
🎧 Oh hi, Linda.
🎧 This is Matt Brooks.
🎧 Alex White gave me your number.
🎧 He said you'd be able to give me some advice about moving to Banford.
🎧 Yes, Alex did mention you.
🎧 How can I help?
🎧 Well, first of all - which area to live in?
🎧 Well, I live in Dalton, which is a really nice suburb -
🎧 not too expensive, and there's a nice park.
🎧 Sounds good.
🎧 Do you know how much it would be to rent a two bedroom flat there?
🎧 Yeah, you should be able to get something reasonable for 850 pounds per month.
🎧 That's what people typically pay.
🎧 You certainly wouldn't want to pay more than 900 pounds.
🎧 That doesn't include bills or anything.
🎧 No. That sounds alright.
🎧 I'll definitely have a look there.
🎧 Are the transport links easy from where you live?
🎧 Well, I'm very lucky.
🎧 I work in the city centre so I don't have to use public transport.
🎧 I go by bike.
🎧 Oh, I wish I could do that.
🎧 Is it safe to cycle around the city?
🎧 Yes, it's fine.
🎧 And it keeps me fit.
🎧 Anyway, driving to work in the city centre would be a nightmare
🎧 because there's hardly any parking.
🎧 And the traffic during the rush hour can be bad.
🎧 I'd be working from home
🎧 but I'd have to go to London one or two days a week.
🎧 Oh, that's perfect.
🎧 Getting to London is no problem.
🎧 There's a fast train every 30 minutes which only takes 45 minutes.
🎧 That's good.
🎧 Yeah, the train service isn't bad during the week.
🎧 And they run quite late at night.
🎧 It's weekends that are a problem.
🎧 They're always doing engineering work
🎧 and you have to take a bus to Hadham
🎧 and pick up the train there, which is really slow.
🎧 But other than that, Banford's a great place to live.
🎧 I've never been happier.
🎧 There are some nice restaurants in the city centre
🎧 and a brand new cinema which has only been open a couple of months.
🎧 There's a good arts centre too.
🎧 Sounds like Banford's got it all.
🎧 Yes! We're really lucky.
🎧 There are lots of really good aspects to living here.
🎧 The schools are good
🎧 and the hospital here is one of the best in the country.
🎧 Everyone I know who's been there's had a positive experience.
🎧 Oh, I can give you the name of my dentist too in Bridge Street,
🎧 if you're interested.
🎧 I've been going to him for years and I've never had any problems.
🎧 Oh, OK. Thanks!
🎧 I'll find his number and send it to you.
🎧 Thanks, that would be really helpful.
🎧 Are you planning to visit Banford soon?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 My wife and I are both coming next week.
🎧 We want to make some appointments with estate agents.
🎧 I could meet you if you like and show you around.
🎧 Are you sure?
🎧 We'd really appreciate that.
🎧 Either a Tuesday or Thursday is good for me, after 5.30.
🎧 Thursday's preferable.
🎧 Tuesday I need to get home before 6 pm.
🎧 Okay great.
🎧 Let me know which train you're catching
🎧 and I'll meet you in the cafe outside.
🎧 You can't miss it.
🎧 It's opposite the station and next to the museum.
🎧 Brilliant.
🎧 I'll text you next week then.
🎧 Thanks so much for all the advice.
🎧 No problem.
🎧 I'll see you next week.
🎧 
🎧 So if you are one of those people who hasn't found the perfect physical activity yet,
🎧 here are some things to think about which might help you make the right decision for you.
🎧 The first question to ask yourself is whether you would enjoy training in a gym.
🎧 Many people are put off by the idea of having to fit a visit to the gym into their busy day.
🎧 You often have to go very early or late as some gyms can get very crowded
🎧 but with regular training you'll see a big difference in a relatively short space of time.
🎧 Running has become incredibly popular in recent years.
🎧 That's probably got a lot to do with the fact that it's a very accessible form of exercise
🎧 that anyone can run even if you could only run a few meters to begin with.
🎧 But make sure you get the right shoes.
🎧 It's worth investing in a high quality pair and they don't come cheap.
🎧 Another great thing about running is that you can do it at any time of day or night.
🎧 The only thing that may stop you is snow and ice.
🎧 Swimming is another really good way to build fitness.
🎧 What attracts many people is that you can swim in an indoor pool at any time of year.
🎧 On the other hand, it can be quite boring or solitary.
🎧 It's hard to chat to people while you're swimming lengths.
🎧 Cycling has become almost as popular as running in recent years.
🎧 That's probably because as well as improving their fitness
🎧 many people say being out in the fresh air in a park or in the countryside can be fun,
🎧 provided the conditions are right of course.
🎧 Only fanatics go out in the wind and rain.
🎧 Yoga is a good choice for those of you looking for exercise,
🎧 which focuses on developing both a healthy mind and body.
🎧 It's a good way of building strength
🎧 and with the right instructor there's less chance of hurting yourself than with other more active sports.
🎧 But don't expect to find it easy.
🎧 It can be surprisingly challenging, especially for people who aren't very flexible.
🎧 Getting a personal trainer is a good way to start your fitness program.
🎧 Obviously there can be significant costs involved.
🎧 But if you've got someone there to encourage you and help you achieve your goals,
🎧 you're less likely to give up.
🎧 Make sure you get someone with a recognised qualification though.
🎧 Or you could do yourself permanent damage.
🎧 Whatever you do, don't join a gym unless you're sure you'll make good use of it.
🎧 So many people waste lots of money by signing up for membership and then hardly ever go.
🎧 What happens to their good intentions?
🎧 I don't think people suddenly stop caring about improving their fitness
🎧 or decide they have more important things to do.
🎧 I think people lose interest when they don't think they're making enough progress.
🎧 That's when they give up hope and stop believing they'll ever achieve their goals.
🎧 Also, what people sometimes don't realize when they start
🎧 is that it takes a lot of determination and hard work to keep training week after week,
🎧 and lots of people don't have that kind of commitment.
🎧 One thing you can do to help yourself is to set manageable goals,
🎧 be realistic and don't push yourself too far.
🎧 Some people advise writing goals down
🎧 but I think it's better to have a flexible approach.
🎧 Give yourself a really nice treat every time you reach one of your goals
🎧 and don't get too upset if you experience setbacks.
🎧 It's a journey.
🎧 There are bound to be difficulties along the way.
🎧 
🎧 OK, Jim.
🎧 You wanted to see me about your textile design project.
🎧 That's right.
🎧 I've been looking at how a range of natural dyes can be used to colour fabrics like cotton and wool.
🎧 Why did you choose that topic?
🎧 Well, I got a lot of useful ideas from the museum,
🎧 you know, at that exhibition of textiles.
🎧 But I've always been interested in anything to do with colour.
🎧 Years ago, I went to a carpet shop with my parents when we were on holiday in Turkey,
🎧 and I remember all the amazing colours.
🎧 They might not all have been natural dyes.
🎧 Maybe not, but for the project I decided to follow it up.
🎧 And I found a great book about a botanic garden in California that specialises in plants used for dyes.
🎧 OK.
🎧 So, in your project, you had to include a practical investigation.
🎧 Yeah.
🎧 At first I couldn't decide on my variables.
🎧 I was going to just look at one type of fibre for example, like cotton…
🎧 and see how different types of dyes affected it?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 Then I decided to include others as well,
🎧 so I looked at cotton and wool and nylon.
🎧 With just one type of dye?
🎧 Various types, including some that weren't natural, for comparison.
🎧 OK.
🎧 So, I did the experiments last week.
🎧 I used some ready-made natural dyes.
🎧 I found a website which supplied them,
🎧 they came in just a few days, but I also made some of my own.
🎧 That must have taken quite a bit of time.
🎧 Yes,
🎧 I'd thought it'd just be a matter of a teaspoon or so of dye,
🎧 and actually that wasn't the case at all.
🎧 Like I was using one vegetable, beetroot, for a red dye,
🎧 and I had to chop up a whole pile of it.
🎧 So it all took longer than I'd expected.
🎧 One possibility is to use food colourings.
🎧 I did use one.
🎧 That was a yellow dye, an artificial one.
🎧 Tartrazine?
🎧 Yeah. I used it on cotton first.
🎧 It came out a great colour,
🎧 but when I rinsed the material, the colour just washed away.
🎧 I'd been going to try it out on nylon, but I abandoned that idea.
🎧 Were you worried about health issues?
🎧 I'd thought if it's a legal food colouring, it must be safe.
🎧 Well, it can occasionally cause allergic reactions, I believe.
🎧 So what natural dyes did you look at?
🎧 Well, one was turmeric.
🎧 The colour's great, it's a really strong yellow.
🎧 It's generally used in dishes like curry.
🎧 It's meant to be quite good for your health when eaten,
🎧 but you might find it's not permanent when it's used as a dye -
🎧 a few washes, and it's gone.
🎧 Right.
🎧 I used beetroot as a dye for wool.
🎧 When I chop up beetroot to eat I always end up with bright red hands,
🎧 but the wool ended up just a sort of watery cream shade. Disappointing.
🎧 There's a natural dye called Tyrian purple. Have you heard of that?
🎧 Yes. It comes from a shellfish,
🎧 and it was worn in ancient times but only by important people as it was so rare.
🎧 I didn't use it.
🎧 It fell out of use centuries ago,
🎧 though one researcher managed to get hold of some recently.
🎧 But that shade of purple can be produced by chemical dyes nowadays.
🎧 Did you use any black dyes?
🎧 Logwood.
🎧 That was quite complicated.
🎧 I had to prepare the fabric so the dye would take.
🎧 I hope you were careful to wear gloves.
🎧 Yes. I know the danger with that dye.
🎧 Good. It can be extremely dangerous if it's ingested.
🎧 Now, presumably you had a look at an insect-based dye? Like cochineal, for example?
🎧 Yes. I didn't actually make that,
🎧 I didn't have time to start crushing up insects to get the red colour
🎧 and anyway they're not available here,
🎧 but I managed to get the dye quite easily from a website.
🎧 But it cost a fortune.
🎧 I can see why it's generally just used in cooking, and in small quantities.
🎧 Yes, it's very effective, but that's precisely why it's not used as a dye.
🎧 I also read about using metal oxide.
🎧 Apparently you can allow iron to rust while it's in contact with the fabric, and that colours it.
🎧 Yes, that works well for dying cotton.
🎧 But you have to be careful as the metal can actually affect the fabric
🎧 and so you can't expect to get a lot of wear out of fabrics treated in this way.
🎧 And the colours are quite subtle, not everyone likes them.
🎧 Anyway, it looks as if you've done a lot of work…
🎧 
🎧 Last week, we started looking at reptiles, including crocodiles and snakes.
🎧 Today, I'd like us to have a look at another reptile - the lizard -
🎧 and in particular, at some studies that have been done on a particular type of lizard
🎧 whose Latin name is tiliqua rugosa.
🎧 This is commonly known as the sleepy lizard,
🎧 because it's quite slow in its movements and spends quite a lot of its time dozing under rocks or lying in the sun.
🎧 I'll start with a general description.
🎧 Sleepy lizards live in Western and South Australia, where they're quite common.
🎧 Unlike European lizards, which are mostly small, green and fast-moving,
🎧 sleepy lizards are brown,
🎧 but what's particularly distinctive about them is the colour of their tongue, which is dark blue,
🎧 in contrast with the lining of their mouth which is bright pink.
🎧 And they're much bigger than most European lizards.
🎧 They have quite a varied diet, including insects and even small animals,
🎧 but they mostly eat plants of varying kinds.
🎧 Even though they're quite large and powerful,
🎧 with strong jaws that can crush beetles and snail shells,
🎧 they still have quite a few predators.
🎧 Large birds like cassowaries were one of the main ones in the past,
🎧 but nowadays they're more likely to be caught and killed by snakes.
🎧 Actually, another threat to their survival isn't a predator at all, but is man-made -
🎧 quite a large number of sleepy lizards are killed by cars when they're trying to cross highways.
🎧 One study carried out by Michael Freake at Flinders University
🎧 investigated the methods of navigation of these lizards.
🎧 Though they move slowly, they can travel quite long distances.
🎧 And he found that even if they were taken some distance away from their home territory,
🎧 they could usually find their way back home as long as they could see the sky -
🎧 they didn't need any other landmarks on the ground.
🎧 Observations of these lizards in the wild have also revealed that their mating habits are quite unusual.
🎧 Unlike most animals, it seems that they're relatively monogamous,
🎧 returning to the same partner year after year.
🎧 And the male and female also stay together for a long time,
🎧 both before and after the birth of their young.
🎧 It's quite interesting to think about the possible reasons for this.
🎧 It could be that it's to do with protecting their young -
🎧 you'd expect them to have a much better chance of survival if they have both parents around.
🎧 But in fact observers have noted that once the babies have hatched out of their eggs,
🎧 they have hardly any contact with their parents.
🎧 So, there's not really any evidence to support that idea.
🎧 Another suggestion's based on the observation that male lizards in monogamous relationships
🎧 tend to be bigger and stronger than other males.
🎧 So maybe the male lizards stay around so they can give the female lizards protection from other males.
🎧 But again, we're not really sure.
🎧 Finally, I'd like to mention another study that involved collecting data by tracking the lizards.
🎧 I was actually involved in this myself.
🎧 So we caught some lizards in the wild
🎧 and we developed a tiny GPS system that would allow us to track them,
🎧 and we fixed this onto their tails.
🎧 Then we set the lizards free again,
🎧 and we were able to track them for twelve days and gather data,
🎧 not just about their location, but even about how many steps they took during this period.
🎧 One surprising thing we discovered from this
🎧 is that there were far fewer meetings between lizards than we expected -
🎧 it seems that they were actually trying to avoid one another.
🎧 So why would that be?
🎧 Well, again we have no clear evidence,
🎧 but one hypothesis is that male lizards can cause quite serious injuries to one another,
🎧 so maybe this avoidance is a way of preventing this - of self-preservation, if you like.
🎧 But we need to collect a lot more data before we can be sure of any of this.
