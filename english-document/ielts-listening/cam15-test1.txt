🎧 Hello William.
🎧 This is Amber -
🎧 you said to phone if I wanted to get more information about the job agency you mentioned.
🎧 Is now a good time?
🎧 Oh, hi Amber. Yes. Fine.
🎧 So the agency I was talking about is called Bankside -
🎧 they're based in Docklands -
🎧 I can tell you the address now - 497 Eastside.
🎧 OK, thanks.
🎧 So is there anyone in particular I should speak to there?
🎧 The agent I always deal with is called Becky Jamieson.
🎧 Let me write that down -
🎧 Becky…
🎧 Jamieson
🎧 Jamieson
🎧 Do you have her direct line?
🎧 Yes, it's in my contacts somewhere -
🎧 right, here we are:
🎧 07866510333.
🎧 I wouldn't call her until the afternoon if I were you -
🎧 she's always really busy in the morning trying to fill last-minute vacancies.
🎧 She's really helpful and friendly so I'm sure it would be worth getting in touch with her for an informal chat.
🎧 It's mainly clerical and admin jobs they deal with, isn't it?
🎧 That's right.
🎧 I know you're hoping to find a full-time job in the media eventually -
🎧 but Becky mostly recruits temporary staff for the finance sector -
🎧 which will look good on your CV - and generally pays better too.
🎧 Yeah - I'm just a bit worried because I don't have much office experience.
🎧 I wouldn't worry.
🎧 They'll probably start you as a receptionist, or something like that.
🎧 So what's important for that kind of job isn't so much having business skills or
🎧 knowing lots of different computer systems - it's communication that really matters -
🎧 so you'd be fine there.
🎧 And you'll pick up office skills really quickly on the job.
🎧 It's not that complicated.
🎧 OK good.
🎧 So how long do people generally need temporary staff for?
🎧 It would be great if I could get something lasting at least a month.
🎧 That shouldn't be too difficult.
🎧 But you're more likely to be offered something for a week at first, which might get extended.
🎧 It's unusual to be sent somewhere for just a day or two.
🎧 Right,
🎧 I've heard the pay isn't too bad -
🎧 better than working in a shop or a restaurant.
🎧 Oh yes - definitely.
🎧 The hourly rate is about £10, 11 if you're lucky.
🎧 That's pretty good.
🎧 I was only expecting to get eight or nine pounds an hour.
🎧 Do you want me to tell you anything about the registration process?
🎧 Yes, please.
🎧 I know you have to have an interview.
🎧 The interview usually takes about an hour
🎧 and you should arrange that about a week in advance.
🎧 I suppose I should dress smartly if it's for office work -
🎧 I can probably borrow a suit from Mum.
🎧 Good idea.
🎧 It's better to look too smart than too casual.
🎧 Will I need to bring copies of my exam certificates or anything like that?
🎧 No - they don't need to see those, I don't think.
🎧 What about my passport?
🎧 Oh yes - they will ask to see that.
🎧 OK.
🎧 I wouldn't get stressed about the interview though.
🎧 It's just a chance for them to build relationship with you -
🎧 so they can try and match you to a job which you'll like.
🎧 So there are questions about personality that they always ask candidates -
🎧 fairly basic ones.
🎧 And they probably won't ask anything too difficult like what your plans are for the future.
🎧 Hope not.
🎧 Anyway, there are lots of benefits to using an agency -
🎧 for example, the interview will be useful because they'll give you feedback on your performance
🎧 so you can improve next time.
🎧 And they'll have access to jobs which aren't advertised.
🎧 Exactly -
🎧 most temporary jobs aren't advertised.
🎧 And I expect finding a temporary job this way takes a lot less time -
🎧 it's much easier than ringing up individual companies.
🎧 Yes indeed.
🎧 Well I think…
🎧 
🎧 Good morning.
🎧 My name's Erica Matthews,
🎧 and I'm the owner of Matthews Island Holidays,
🎧 a company set up by my parents.
🎧 Thank you for coming to this presentation,
🎧 in which I hope to interest you in what we have to offer.
🎧 We're a small, family-run company,
🎧 and we believe in the importance of the personal touch,
🎧 so we don't aim to compete with other companies on the number of customers.
🎧 What we do is build on our many years' experience -
🎧 more than almost any other rail holiday company -
🎧 to ensure we provide perfect holidays in a small number of destinations,
🎧 which we've got to know extremely well.
🎧 I'll start with our six-day Isle of Man holiday.
🎧 This is a fascinating island in the Irish Sea,
🎧 with Wales to the south, England to the east,
🎧 Scotland to the north and Northern Ireland to the west.
🎧 Our holiday starts in Heysham,
🎧 where your tour manager will meet you,
🎧 then you'll travel by ferry to the Isle of Man.
🎧 Some people prefer to fly from Luton instead,
🎧 and another popular option is to go by train to Liverpool and take a ferry from there.
🎧 You have five nights in the hotel,
🎧 and the price covers five breakfasts and dinners,
🎧 and lunch on the three days when there are organised trips:
🎧 day four is free,
🎧 and most people have lunch in a café or restaurant in Douglas.
🎧 The price of the holiday includes the ferry to the Isle of Man,
🎧 all travel on the island, the hotel, and the meals I've mentioned.
🎧 Incidentally, we try to make booking our holidays as simple and fair as possible,
🎧 so unlike with many companies,
🎧 the price is the same whether you book six months in advance
🎧 or at the last minute,
🎧 and there's no supplement for single rooms in hotels.
🎧 If you make a booking then need to change the start date,
🎧 for example because of illness,
🎧 you're welcome to change to an alternative date or a different tour,
🎧 for a small administrative fee.
🎧 OK, so what does the holiday consist of?
🎧 Well, on day one
🎧 you'll arrive in time for a short introduction by your tour manager,
🎧 followed by dinner in the hotel.
🎧 The dining room looks out at the river,
🎧 close to where it flows into the harbour,
🎧 and there's usually plenty of activity going on.
🎧 On day two you'll take the coach to the small town of Peel,
🎧 on the way calling in at the Tynwald Exhibition.
🎧 The Isle of Man isn't part of the United Kingdom,
🎧 and it has its own parliament, called Tynwald.
🎧 It's claimed that this is the world's oldest parliament that's still functioning,
🎧 and that it dates back to 979.
🎧 However, the earliest surviving reference to it is from 1422,
🎧 so perhaps it isn't quite as old as it claims!
🎧 Day three we have a trip to the mountain Snaefell.
🎧 This begins with a leisurely ride along the promenade in Douglas in a horse-drawn tram.
🎧 Then you board an electric train which takes you to the fishing village of Laxey.
🎧 From there it's an eight-kilometre ride in the Snaefell Mountain Railway to the top.
🎧 Lunch will be in the café, giving you spectacular views of the island.
🎧 Day four is free for you to explore, using the pass which we'll give you.
🎧 So you won't have to pay for travel on local transport,
🎧 or for entrance to the island's heritage sites.
🎧 Or you might just want to take it easy in Douglas and perhaps do a little light shopping.
🎧 The last full day, day five, is for some people the highlight of the holiday,
🎧 with a ride on the steam railway, from Douglas to Port Erin.
🎧 After some time to explore,
🎧 a coach will take you to the headland that overlooks the Calf of Man,
🎧 a small island just off the coast.
🎧 From there you continue to Castletown,
🎧 which used to be the capital of the Isle of Man, and its mediaeval castle.
🎧 And on day six it's back to the ferry -
🎧 or the airport, if you flew to the island - and time to go home.
🎧 Now I'd like to tell you...
🎧 
🎧 Ed, how are you getting on with the reading for our presentation next week?
🎧 Well, OK, Ruth - but there's so much of it.
🎧 I know,
🎧 I hadn't realised birth order was such a popular area of research.
🎧 But the stuff on birth order and personality is mostly unreliable.
🎧 From what I've been reading,
🎧 a lot of the claims about how your position in the family determines certain personality traits are just stereotypes,
🎧 with no robust evidence to support them.
🎧 OK, but that's an interesting point -
🎧 we could start by outlining what previous research has shown.
🎧 There are studies going back over a hundred years.
🎧 Yeah - so we could just run through some of the typical traits.
🎧 Like the consensus seems to be that oldest children are generally less well-adjusted
🎧 because they never get over the arrival of a younger sibling.
🎧 Right, but on a positive note,
🎧 some studies claimed that they were thought to be good at nurturing -
🎧 certainly in the past when people had large families,
🎧 they would have been expected to look after the younger ones.
🎧 There isn't such a clear picture for middle children -
🎧 but one trait that a lot of the studies mention
🎧 is that they are easier to get on with than older or younger siblings.
🎧 Mm. Generally eager to please and helpful -
🎧 although that's certainly not accurate as far as my family goes -
🎧 my middle brother was a nightmare -
🎧 always causing fights and envious of whatever I had.
🎧 As I said - none of this seems to relate to my own experience.
🎧 I'm the youngest in my family
🎧 and I don't recognise myself in any of the studies I've read about.
🎧 I'm supposed to have been a sociable and confident child who made friends easily
🎧 but I was actually terribly shy.
🎧 Really? That's funny.
🎧 There have been hundreds of studies on twins but mostly about nurture versus nature…
🎧 There was one on personality, which said that a twin is likely to be quite shy in social situations
🎧 because they always have their twin around to depend on for support.
🎧 My cousins were like that when they were small -
🎧 they were only interested in each other and found it hard to engage with other kids.
🎧 They're fine now though.
🎧 Only children have had a really bad press -
🎧 a lot of studies have branded them as loners who think the world revolves around them
🎧 because they've never had to fight for their parents' attention.
🎧 That does seem a bit harsh.
🎧 One category I hadn't considered before was children with much older siblings -
🎧 a couple of studies mentioned that these children grow up more quickly
🎧 and are expected to do basic things for themselves - like getting dressed.
🎧 I can see how that might be true -
🎧 although I expect they're sometimes the exact opposite -
🎧 playing the baby role and clamouring for special treatment.
🎧 What was the problem with most of these studies, do you think?
🎧 I think it was because
🎧 in a lot of cases data was collected from only one sibling per family,
🎧 who rated him or herself and his or her siblings at the same time.
🎧 Some of the old research into the relationship between birth order and academic achievement has been proved to be accurate though.
🎧 Performances in intelligence tests decline slightly from the eldest child to his or her younger siblings.
🎧 This has been proved in lots of recent studies.
🎧 Yes. Although what many of them didn't take into consideration was family size.
🎧 The more siblings there are, the likelier the family is to have a low socioeconomic status -
🎧 which can also account for differences between siblings in academic performance.
🎧 The oldest boy might be given more opportunities than his younger sisters, for example.
🎧 Exactly.
🎧 But the main reason for the marginally higher academic performance of oldest children is quite surprising, I think.
🎧 It's not only that they benefit intellectually from extra attention at a young age -
🎧 which is what I would have expected.
🎧 It's that they benefit from being teachers for their younger siblings, by verbalising processes.
🎧 Right, and this gives them status and confidence,
🎧 which again contributes, in a small way, to better performance.
🎧 So would you say sibling rivalry has been a useful thing for you?
🎧 I think so, my younger brother was incredibly annoying.
🎧 And we fought a lot
🎧 but I think this has made me a stronger person.
🎧 I know how to defend myself.
🎧 We had some terrible arguments and I would have died rather than apologise to him.
🎧 But we had to put up with each other and most of the time we coexisted amicably enough.
🎧 Yes, my situation was pretty similar.
🎧 But I don't think having two older brothers made me any less selfish.
🎧 I was never prepared to let my brothers use any of my stuff...
🎧 That's perfectly normal...
🎧 
🎧 Today I'm going to talk about the eucalyptus tree.
🎧 This is a very common tree here in Australia,
🎧 where it's also sometimes called the gum tree.
🎧 First I'm going to talk about why it's important,
🎧 then I'm going to describe some problems it faces at present.
🎧 Right, well the eucalyptus tree is an important tree for lots of reasons.
🎧 For example, it gives shelter to creatures like birds and bats,
🎧 and these and other species also depend on it for food,
🎧 particularly the nectar from its flowers.
🎧 So it supports biodiversity.
🎧 It's useful to us humans too,
🎧 because we can kill germs with a disinfectant made from oil extracted from eucalyptus leaves.
🎧 The eucalyptus grows all over Australia
🎧 and the trees can live for up to 400 years.
🎧 So it's alarming that all across the country,
🎧 numbers of eucalyptus are falling because the trees are dying off prematurely.
🎧 So what are the reasons for this?
🎧 One possible reason is disease.
🎧 As far back as the 1970s the trees started getting a disease called Mundulla Yellows.
🎧 The trees' leaves would gradually turn yellow, then the tree would die.
🎧 It wasn't until 2004 that they found the cause of the problem was lime,
🎧 or calcium hydroxide to give it its proper chemical name,
🎧 which was being used in the construction of roads.
🎧 The lime was being washed away into the ground and affecting the roots of the eucalyptus trees nearby.
🎧 What it was doing was preventing the trees from sucking up the iron they needed for healthy growth.
🎧 When this was injected back into the affected trees, they immediately recovered.
🎧 But this problem only affected a relatively small number of trees.
🎧 By 2000, huge numbers of eucalyptus were dying along Australia's East Coast,
🎧 of a disease known as Bell-miner Associated Die-back.
🎧 The bell-miner is a bird,
🎧 and the disease seems to be common where there are high populations of bell-miners.
🎧 Again it's the leaves of the trees that are affected.
🎧 What happens is that insects settle on the leaves
🎧 and eat their way round them, destroying them as they go,
🎧 and at the same time they secrete a solution which has sugar in it.
🎧 The bell-miner birds really like this solution,
🎧 and in order to get as much as possible,
🎧 they keep away other creatures that might try to get it.
🎧 So these birds and insects flourish at the expense of other species,
🎧 and eventually so much damage is done to the leaves that the tree dies.
🎧 But experts say that trees can start looking sick before any sign of Bell-miner Associated Die-back.
🎧 So it looks as if the problem might have another explanation.
🎧 One possibility is that it's to do with the huge bushfires that we have in Australia.
🎧 A theory proposed over 40 years ago by ecologist William Jackson
🎧 is that the frequency of bushfires in a particular region affects the type of vegetation that grows there.
🎧 If there are very frequent bushfires in a region,
🎧 this encourages grass to grow afterwards,
🎧 while if the bushfires are rather less frequent,
🎧 this results in the growth of eucalyptus forests.
🎧 So why is this?
🎧 Why do fairly frequent bushfires actually support the growth of eucalyptus?
🎧 Well, one reason is that the fire stops the growth of other species
🎧 which would consume water needed by eucalyptus trees.
🎧 And there's another reason.
🎧 If these other quick-growing species of bushes and plants are allowed to proliferate,
🎧 they harm the eucalyptus in another way,
🎧 by affecting the composition of the soil, and removing nutrients from it.
🎧 So some bushfires are actually essential for the eucalyptus to survive
🎧 as long as they are not too frequent.
🎧 In fact there's evidence that Australia's indigenous people practised regular burning of bush land for thousands of years
🎧 before the arrival of the Europeans.
🎧 But since Europeans arrived on the continent,
🎧 the number of bushfires has been strictly controlled.
🎧 Now scientists believe that this reduced frequency of bushfires to low levels
🎧 has led to what's known as 'dry rainforest',
🎧 which seems an odd name as usually we associate tropical rainforest with wet conditions.
🎧 And what's special about this type of rainforest?
🎧 Well, unlike tropical rainforest which is a rich ecosystem,
🎧 this type of ecosystem is usually a simple one.
🎧 It has very thick, dense vegetation,
🎧 but not much variety of species.
🎧 The vegetation provides lots of shade,
🎧 so one species that does find it ideal is the bell-miner bird,
🎧 which builds its nests in the undergrowth there.
🎧 But again that's not helpful for the eucalyptus tree.
