🎧 Hi Coleman, how are you?
🎧 Good, thanks.
🎧 I wanted to have a chat with you
🎧 because our friend Josh told me that you've joined a guitar group
🎧 and it sounds interesting.
🎧 I'd really like to learn myself.
🎧 Why don't you come along?
🎧 I'm sure there's room for another person.
🎧 Really?
🎧 So... who runs the classes?
🎧 He's called a 'coordinator',
🎧 his name's Gary Mathieson.
🎧 Let me note that down.
🎧 Gary....
🎧 How do you spell his surname?
🎧 It's Mathieson.
🎧 Right, thanks.
🎧 He's retired, actually, but he's a really nice guy
🎧 and he used to play in a lot of bands.
🎧 Thanks.
🎧 So how long have you been going?
🎧 About a month now.
🎧 And could you play anything before you started?
🎧 I knew a few chords, but that's all.
🎧 I'm sure everyone will be better than me.
🎧 That's what I thought, too.
🎧 When I first spoke to Gary on the phone,
🎧 he said it was a class for beginners,
🎧 but I was still worried that everyone would be better than me,
🎧 but we were all equally hopeless!
🎧 Oh, that's reassuring.
🎧 So where do you meet?
🎧 Well, when I joined the group, they were meeting in Gary's home,
🎧 but as the group got bigger, he decided to book a room at the college in town.
🎧 I prefer going there.
🎧 I know that place.
🎧 I used to go to tap dancing classes there when I was at secondary school.
🎧 I haven't been since, though and I can't remember what road it's in...
🎧 Is it Lock Street?
🎧 It's just beyond there at the bottom of New Street near the city roundabout.
🎧 Yes, of course.
🎧 The guitar club is on the first floor in Room T347.
🎧 Right.
🎧 And when do you meet?
🎧 Is it at the weekend?
🎧 We meet on Thursdays.
🎧 It used to be 10.30 and that suited me well,
🎧 but now we meet at 11.
🎧 The class that's in there before us asked if they could have the room for another 30 minutes.
🎧 Oh, I see.
🎧 Well, I'd love to come, but I don't have a guitar.
🎧 Well, you can always buy a second-hand one.
🎧 There's a website called 'The perfect instrument' that sells all kinds of guitars, violins and so on.
🎧 I'm sure you'll find something there.
🎧 So what's a typical lesson like with Gary?
🎧 Well, he always starts by getting us to tune our guitars.
🎧 That takes about five minutes.
🎧 Uhuh...
🎧 Some people have an app they use, but others do it by ear.
🎧 Gary goes round and helps them.
🎧 And while he's doing that, he tells us what he's going to do during the lesson.
🎧 Right.
🎧 First, we usually spend about ten minutes doing some strumming.
🎧 So is that using...
🎧 Oh... what are they called...
🎧 Plectrums?
🎧 No, we just use our thumbs.
🎧 Oh... much easier.
🎧 Gary reminds us where to put our fingers for each chord and then we play them together.
🎧 Sometimes we all just start laughing because we're so bad at keeping time,
🎧 so Gary starts clapping to help us.
🎧 Do you learn to play any songs?
🎧 Yes, we do at least one song with words and chords.
🎧 I mean that's harder than you think.
🎧 Oh, I'm sure it is!
🎧 That part of the lesson takes about 15 minutes.
🎧 He often brings a recording of the song and plays it to us first.
🎧 Then he hands out the song and if there's a new chord in it,
🎧 we practise that before we play it together, but really slowly.
🎧 Do you do any finger picking?
🎧 That's the last ten minutes of the lesson,
🎧 when we pick out the individual notes from a tune he's made up.
🎧 It's always quite simple.
🎧 That must be hard, though.
🎧 It is.
🎧 But people like it because they can really concentrate
🎧 and if we're all playing well, it sounds quite impressive.
🎧 The only trouble is that he sometimes gets us to play one at a time, you know, alone.
🎧 Oh... that's scary.
🎧 Um... it is, but I've got used to it now.
🎧 At the end he spends about five minutes telling us what to practise for the following week.
🎧 Well, thanks Coleman.
🎧 I'll go and have a look at that website, I think.
🎧 
🎧 I never really planned to be a lifeboat volunteer when I came to live in Northsea.
🎧 I'd been working in London as a website designer,
🎧 but although that was interesting, I didn't like city life.
🎧 I'd been really keen on boats as a teenager,
🎧 and I thought if I went to live by the sea.
🎧 I might be able to pursue that interest a bit more in my free time.
🎧 Then I found that the Lifeboat Institution was looking for volunteers,
🎧 so I decided to apply.
🎧 The Lifeboat Institution building here in Northsea's hard to miss,
🎧 it's one of the largest in the country.
🎧 It was built 15 years ago with funds provided by a generous member of the public who'd lived here all her life.
🎧 As the Lifeboat Institution is a charity that relies on that kind of donation,
🎧 rather than funding provided by the government,
🎧 that was a huge help to us.
🎧 When I applied, I had to have a health assessment.
🎧 The doctors were particularly interested in my vision.
🎧 I used to be short-sighted,
🎧 so I'd had to wear glasses,
🎧 but I'd had laser eye surgery two years earlier so that was okay.
🎧 They gave me tests for colour blindness
🎧 and they thought I might have a problem there,
🎧 but it turned out I was okay.
🎧 When the coastguard gets an alert,
🎧 all the volunteers are contacted and rush to the lifeboat station.
🎧 Our target's to get there in five minutes,
🎧 then we try to get the boat off the dock and out to sea in another six to eight minutes.
🎧 Our team's proud that we usually achieve that.
🎧 The average time across the country's 8.5 minutes.
🎧 I've recently qualified as what's called a 'helmsman',
🎧 which means I have the ultimate responsibility for the lifeboat.
🎧 I have to check that the equipment we use is in working order,
🎧 the crew have special life jackets that can support up to four people in the water.
🎧 And it's ultimately my decision whether it's safe to launch the boat.
🎧 But it's very rare not to launch it, even in the worst weather.
🎧 As well as going out on the lifeboat, my work involves other things too.
🎧 A lot of people underestimate how quickly conditions can change at sea,
🎧 so I speak to youth groups and sailing clubs in the area
🎧 about the sorts of problems that sailors and swimmers can have if the weather suddenly gets bad.
🎧 We also have a lot of volunteers who organise activities to raise money for us,
🎧 and we couldn't manage without them.
🎧 The training we get is a continuous process,
🎧 focusing on technical competence and safe handling techniques,
🎧 and it's given me the confidence to deal with extreme situations without panicking.
🎧 I was glad I'd done a first aid course before I started,
🎧 as that's a big help with the casualty care activities we do.
🎧 We've done a lot on how to deal with ropes and tie knots,
🎧 that's an essential skill.
🎧 After a year, I did a one-week residential course, led by specialists.
🎧 They had a wave-tank where they could create extreme weather conditions,
🎧 so we could get experience of what to do if the boat turned over in a storm at night, for example.
🎧 Since I started, I've had to deal with a range of emergency situations.
🎧 But the work's hugely motivating.
🎧 It's not just about saving lives.
🎧 I've learned a lot about the technology involved.
🎧 My background in IT's been useful here,
🎧 and I can use my expertise to help other volunteers.
🎧 They're a great group, we're like a family really,
🎧 which helps when you're dragging yourself out of bed on a cold stormy night.
🎧 But actually, it's the colder months that can be the most rewarding time.
🎧 That's when the incidents tend to be more serious,
🎧 and you realise that you can make a huge difference to the outcome.
🎧 So if any of you listeners are interested....
🎧 
🎧 Hi Don.
🎧 Did you get the copy of the article on recycling footwear that I emailed you?
🎧 Yeah it's here...
🎧 I've had a look at it.
🎧 So do you think it's a good topic for our presentation?
🎧 Well, before I started reading it, I thought recycling footwear...
🎧 well, although it's quite interesting, perhaps there isn't enough to say about it,
🎧 cos we put shoes in recycling bins, they go to charity shops and that's about it.
🎧 But there's much more to it than that.
🎧 I realise that now and I'm keen to research the topic more.
🎧 That's great.
🎧 One of the things I didn't realise until I read the article was just how many pairs of trainers get recycled!
🎧 Well, a lot of young people wear them all the time now.
🎧 They've become more popular than ordinary shoes.
🎧 I know.
🎧 I guess they are very hard-wearing,
🎧 but don't they look a bit casual for school uniform?
🎧 I don't think they're right for that.
🎧 Actually, I think some of them look quite smart on pupils...
🎧 Better than a scruffy old pair of shoes.
🎧 So do you keep shoes a long time?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 Though I do tend to wear my old pairs for doing dirty jobs like cleaning my bike.
🎧 I must admit,
🎧 I've recycled some perfectly good shoes, that haven't gone out of fashion and still fit,
🎧 just because they don't look great on me anymore.
🎧 That's awful, isn't it?
🎧 I think it's common because there's so much choice.
🎧 The article did say that recent sales of footwear have increased enormously.
🎧 That didn't surprise me.
🎧 No.
🎧 But then it said that the amount of recycled footwear has fallen:
🎧 it's 6% now compared to a previous level of 11%.
🎧 That doesn't seem to make sense.
🎧 That's because not everything goes through the recycling process.
🎧 Some footwear just isn't good enough to re-sell, for one reason or another, and gets rejected.
🎧 So let's find some examples in the article of footwear that was rejected for recycling.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 I think there are some in the interview with the recycling manager.
🎧 Yeah... here it is.
🎧 Let's start with the ladies' high-heeled shoes.
🎧 What did he say about those?
🎧 He said they were probably expensive.
🎧 The material was suede and they were beige in colour.
🎧 It looked like someone had only worn them once, but in a very wet field
🎧 so the heels were too stained with mud and grass to re-sell them.
🎧 Okay...
🎧 And the leather ankle boots.
🎧 What was wrong with them?
🎧 Apparently, the heels were worn
🎧 but that wasn't the problem.
🎧 One of the shoes was a much lighter shade than the other one.
🎧 It'd obviously been left in the sun.
🎧 I suppose even second-hand shoes should look the same!
🎧 Sure.
🎧 Then there were the red baby shoes.
🎧 Oh yes...
🎧 we're told to tie shoes together when we put them in a recycling bin,
🎧 but people often don't bother.
🎧 You'd think it would have been easy to find the other, but it wasn't.
🎧 That was a shame because they were obviously new.
🎧 The trainers were interesting.
🎧 He said they looked like they'd been worn by a marathon runner.
🎧 Yeah... weren't they split?
🎧 Not exactly.
🎧 One of the soles was so worn under the foot that you could put your finger through it.
🎧 Well, we could certainly use some of those examples in our presentation to explain why 90% of shoes that people take to recycling centres or bins get thrown into landfill.
🎧 What did you think about the project his team set up to avoid this by making new shoes out of the good parts of old shoes?
🎧 It sounded like a good idea.
🎧 They get so many shoes, they should be able to match parts.
🎧 I wasn't surprised that it failed, though.
🎧 I mean who wants to buy second-hand shoes really?
🎧 Think of all the germs you could catch!
🎧 Well, people didn't refuse them for that reason, did they?
🎧 It was because the pairs of shoes weren't identical.
🎧 They still managed to ship them overseas, though.
🎧 That's another area we need to discuss.
🎧 You know I used to consider this topic just from my own perspective,
🎧 by thinking about my own recycling behaviour without looking at the bigger picture.
🎧 So much happens once shoes leave the recycling area.
🎧 It's not as simple as you first think,
🎧 and we can show that by taking a very different approach to it.
🎧 Absolutely.
🎧 So let's discuss...
🎧 
🎧 For my project on invertebrates, I chose to study tardigrades.
🎧 These are microscopic, or to be more precise, near-microscopic animals.
🎧 There are well over a thousand known species of these tiny animals,
🎧 which belong to the phylum Tardigrada.
🎧 Most tardigrades range in length from 0.05 to 1 millimetre,
🎧 though the largest species can grow to be 1.2 millimetres in length.
🎧 They are also sometimes called 'water bears':
🎧 'water' because that's where they thrive best,
🎧 and 'bear' because of the way they move.
🎧 'Moss piglet' is another name for tardigrades
🎧 because of the way they look when viewed from the front.
🎧 They were first discovered in Germany in 1773 by Johann Goeze,
🎧 who coined the name Tardigrada.
🎧 As I say, there are many different species of tardigrade,
🎧 too many to describe here, but generally speaking, the different species share similar physical traits.
🎧 They have a body which is short, and also rounded, a bit like a barrel,
🎧 and the body comprises four segments.
🎧 Each segment has a pair of legs,
🎧 at the end of which are between four and eight sharp claws.
🎧 I should also say that some species don't have any claws;
🎧 what they have are discs,
🎧 and these work by means of suction.
🎧 They enable the tardigrade to cling on to surfaces or to grip its prey.
🎧 Within the body, there are no lungs, or any organs for breathing at all.
🎧 Instead, oxygen and also blood are transported in a fluid that fills the cavity of the body.
🎧 As far as the tardigrade's head is concerned,
🎧 the best way I can describe this is that it looks rather strange, a bit squashed even,
🎧 though many of the websites I looked at described its appearance as cute,
🎧 which isn't exactly very scientific.
🎧 The tardigrade's mouth is a kind of tube
🎧 that can open outwards to reveal teeth-like structures known as 'stylets'.
🎧 These are sharp enough to pierce plant or animal cells.
🎧 So, where are tardigrades found?
🎧 Well, they live in every part of the world,
🎧 in a variety of habitats: most commonly, on the bed of a lake,
🎧 or on many kinds of plants or in very wet environments.
🎧 There's been some interesting research which has found that tardigrades are capable of surviving radiation
🎧 and very high pressure,
🎧 and they're also able to withstand temperatures as cold as -200 degrees centigrade,
🎧 or highs of more than 148 degrees centigrade,
🎧 which is incredibly hot.
🎧 It has been said that tardigrades could survive long after human beings have been wiped out,
🎧 even in the event of an asteroid hitting the earth.
🎧 If conditions become too extreme and tardigrades are at risk of drying out,
🎧 they enter a state called cryptobiosis.
🎧 They curl into a ball, called a tun,
🎧 that's T-U-N- by retracting their head and legs,
🎧 and their metabolism drops to less than one percent of normal levels.
🎧 They can remain like this until they are re-introduced to water,
🎧 when they will come back to life in a matter of a few hours.
🎧 While in a state of cryptobiosis, tardigrades produce a protein that protects their DNA.
🎧 In 2016, scientists revived two tardigrades that had been tuns for more than 30 years.
🎧 There was a report that, in 1948,
🎧 a 120-year-old tun was revived,
🎧 but this experiment has never been repeated.
🎧 There are currently several tests taking place in space,
🎧 to determine how long tardigrades might be able to survive there.
🎧 I believe the record so far is 10 days.
🎧 So, erm, moving on.
🎧 In terms of their diet, tardigrades consume liquids in order to survive.
🎧 Although they have teeth, they don't use these for chewing.
🎧 They suck the juices from moss, or extract fluid from seaweed,
🎧 but some species prey on other tardigrades,
🎧 from other species or within their own.
🎧 I suppose this isn't surprising, given that tardigrades are mainly comprised of liquid and are coated with a type of gel.
🎧 Finally, I'd like to mention the conservation status of tardigrades.
🎧 It is estimated that they have been in existence for approximately half a billion years
🎧 and, in that time, they have survived five mass extinctions.
🎧 So, it will probably come as no surprise to you,
🎧 that tardigrades have not been evaluated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature
🎧 and are not on any endangered list.
🎧 Some researchers have described them as thriving.
🎧 Does anyone have any questions they'd like to ask?
