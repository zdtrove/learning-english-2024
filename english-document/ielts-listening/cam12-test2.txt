[149] Cam12 - Test 2 - Part 1

🎧 Good morning, Kenton Festival box office. How can I help you?
🎧 Oh, good morning.
🎧 I'm coming to Kenton for a few days' holiday next month,
🎧 and a friend told me there's a festival.
🎧 She gave me this number to find out about it.
🎧 That's right, the festival begins on the 16th of May and goes on till the 19th.
🎧 Oh, that's great.
🎧 I'll be there from the 15th till the 19th.
🎧 So could you tell me the programme, please?
🎧 Well, on the first day, there's the opening ceremony, in the town centre.
🎧 People start gathering around 2 o'clock, to get a good place to see from,
🎧 and the events will start at 2.45, and finish about 5.30.
🎧 OK, thanks. I'll make sure I get there early to get a good spot.
🎧 The festival will be officially opened by the mayor.
🎧 He'll just speak for a few minutes, welcoming everyone to the festival.
🎧 All the town councillors will be there, and of course lots of other people.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Then there'll be a performance by a band.
🎧 Most years we have a children's choir,
🎧 but this year the local army cadets offered to perform,
🎧 and they're very good.
🎧 After that, a community group from the town will perform a play they've written themselves, just a short one.
🎧 It's about Helen Tungate.
🎧 I don't know if you've heard of her?
🎧 I certainly have.
🎧 She was a scientist years ago.
🎧 That's right.
🎧 She was born in Kenton exactly 100 years ago,
🎧 so we're celebrating her centenary.
🎧 I'm a biologist, so I've always been interested in her,
🎧 I didn't realise she came from Kenton.
🎧 Yes.
🎧 Well, all that will take place in the afternoon,
🎧 and later, as the sun sets, there'll be a firework display.
🎧 You should go to the park to watch, as you'll get the best view from there,
🎧 and the display takes place on the opposite side of the river.
🎧 It's always one of the most popular events in the festival.
🎧 Sounds great.
🎧 And what's happening on the other days?
🎧 There are several events that go on the whole time.
🎧 For example, the students of the art college have produced a number of videos,
🎧 all connected with relationships between children and their grandparents.
🎧 That sounds interesting.
🎧 It makes a change from children and parents, doesn't it!
🎧 Exactly.
🎧 Because the art college is in use for classes, throughout the festival,
🎧 the videos are being shown in Handsworth House.
🎧 How do you spell the name?
🎧 H-A-N-D-S-W-O-R-T-H.
🎧 Handsworth House.
🎧 It's close to the Town Hall.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Now let me see, what else can I tell you about?
🎧 Are there any displays of ballet dancing?
🎧 I'm particularly interested in that as I do it as a hobby.
🎧 There isn't any ballet, I'm afraid,
🎧 but there'll be a demonstration of traditional dances from all round the country.
🎧 Oh, that'd be nice.
🎧 Where's that being held?
🎧 It's in the market in the town centre - the outdoor one, not the covered market.
🎧 And it's on at 2 and 5 every afternoon of the festival, apart from the first day.
🎧 Lovely.
🎧 I'm interested in all kinds of dancing, so I'm sure I'll enjoy that!
🎧 I'm sure you will.
🎧 And I'd really like to go to some concerts, if there are any.
🎧 Yes, there are several.
🎧 Three performed by professionals, and one by local children.
🎧 And where is it being held?
🎧 It's in the library, which is in Part Street.
🎧 On the 18th, at 6.30 in the evening.
🎧 I presume I'll need tickets for that.
🎧 Yes, you can book online,
🎧 or you can buy them when you arrive in Kenton,
🎧 either at the festival box office, or from any shops displaying our logo in the windows.
🎧 Well, I think that'll keep me busy for the whole of my stay in Kenton.
🎧 Thank you so much for all your help.
🎧 You're welcome. I hope you enjoy your stay.
🎧 Thank you. Goodbye.

[150] Cam12 - Test 2 - Part 2

🎧 Right. I've now almost succeeded in finalising plans for our tour,
🎧 so I'll bring you up to date with what I know.
🎧 As you know, we're flying first to Munich, on Monday the 4th.
🎧 The flight is at 11.30,
🎧 so it's too early to have lunch at the airport.
🎧 I suggest we meet there for coffee at 10,
🎧 which should give us plenty of time for breakfast before we leave home.
🎧 When we arrive in Munich, we'll be met at the airport by Claus Bauer.
🎧 Claus works for a tour operator, and he'll look after us for the time we'll be in Germany.
🎧 He's already liaised with the managers of the theatres we're going to visit,
🎧 and he's also arranged for an officer of the National Theatre in Munich
🎧 to show us round the theatre one afternoon during our stay.
🎧 Now last time we discussed this trip,
🎧 I didn't have the precise cost for hotel rooms, but now I have.
🎧 The normal rate at the hotel where we're staying is 150 euros a night for a double room.
🎧 I'd hoped to get that down to 120 euros,
🎧 but in fact I've been able to negotiate a rate of 110.
🎧 That'll be reflected in the final payment which you'll need to make by the end of this week.
🎧 On Tuesday, the day after our arrival,
🎧 I had hoped we could sit in on a rehearsal at one of the theatres,
🎧 but unfortunately that's proved very difficult to arrange,
🎧 so instead we'll have a coach trip to one of the amazing castles in the mountains south of Munich.
🎧 On Tuesday evening, we'll all have dinner together in a restaurant near our hotel.
🎧 From talking to you all about your preferences,
🎧 it was clear that a typical local restaurant would be too meat-oriented for some of you.
🎧 Some of you suggested an Italian restaurant,
🎧 but I must confess that I decided to book a Lebanese one,
🎧 as we have plenty of opportunities to go to an Italian restaurant at home.
🎧 On Wednesday afternoon, the director of the play we're going to see that evening will talk to us at the theatre.
🎧 She'll describe the whole process of producing a play,
🎧 including how she chose the actors,
🎧 and, as the play we're going to see is a modern one, how she worked with the playwright.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Now I'd just like to make a few points about the plays we're going to see,
🎧 partly because it might influence your choice of clothes to take with you!
🎧 The play we're seeing on Wednesday evening is a modern one,
🎧 and we're going to the premiere, so it'll be quite a dressy occasion,
🎧 though of course you don't have to dress formally.
🎧 I gather it's rather a multimedia production,
🎧 with amazing lighting effects and a soundtrack of electronic music,
🎧 though unfortunately the playwright is ill and is unlikely to be able to attend.
🎧 On Thursday we're seeing a play that was first performed last year,
🎧 when it was commissioned to mark a hundred years since the birth in the town of a well-known scientist.
🎧 We're going to see a revival of that production, which aroused a lot of interest.
🎧 Friday's play will really make you think hard about what clothes to pack,
🎧 as it'll be in the garden of a palace.
🎧 It's a beautiful setting, but I'd better warn you, there won't be much protection from the wind.
🎧 On Saturday, we're going by coach to a theatre in another town, not far from Munich.
🎧 This will be the opening of a drama festival,
🎧 and the mayor and all the other dignitaries of the town will be attending.
🎧 After the performance, the mayor is hosting a reception for all the audience,
🎧 and there'll be a band playing traditional music of the region.
🎧 And after having a day off on Sunday, our final play is on Monday,
🎧 and it's in the stunning setting of the old Town Hall,
🎧 which dates back to the 14th century.
🎧 The performance marks the fifty years that the lead actor has been on stage,
🎧 and the play is the one where he made his first professional appearance, all those years ago.
🎧 And the day after that, we'll be flying back home.
🎧 Now have you got any questions...

[151] Cam12 - Test 2 - Part 3

🎧 Oh good morning. You must be James.
🎧 I'm Beth Cartwright - please call me Beth.
🎧 Thank you.
🎧 Now as this is your first tutorial since you started on the Scandinavian Studies course,
🎧 I'd like to find out something about you.
🎧 Why did you decide to take this course?
🎧 Well, my mother is Danish, and although we always lived in England, she used to talk about her home a lot,
🎧 and that made me want to visit Denmark.
🎧 We hardly ever did, though - my mother usually went on her own.
🎧 But whenever her relations or friends were in England they always came to see us.
🎧 I see.
🎧 So I assume you already speak Danish, one of the languages you'll be studying.
🎧 I can get by when I talk to people, though I'm not terribly accurate.
🎧 Now you probably know that you'll spend the third year of the course abroad.
🎧 Have you had any thoughts about that?
🎧 I'm really looking forward to it.
🎧 And although Denmark seems the obvious place to go, because of my family connections,
🎧 I'd love to spend the time in Iceland.
🎧 Oh, I'm sure it can be arranged.
🎧 Do you have any plans for when you graduate?
🎧 A lot of students go on to take a master's degree.
🎧 I think the four years of the undergraduate course will be enough for me.
🎧 I'm interested in journalism,
🎧 and I quite like the idea of moving to Scandinavia and writing for magazines.
🎧 I'd find that more creative than translating, which I suppose most graduates do.
🎧 OK.
🎧 Now how are you finding the courses you're taking this term, James?
🎧 Well, I'm really enjoying the one on Swedish cinema.
🎧 That'll continue next term,
🎧 but the one on Scandinavian literature that's running at the moment will be replaced by more specialised courses.
🎧 Oh, and by the way, if you're interested in watching Danish television programmes -
🎧 there's going to be a course on that the term after next.
🎧 That sounds good.
🎧 Have you started thinking about the literature paper that you have to write in the next few weeks?
🎧 Yes, my first choice would be to do something on the Icelandic sagas.
🎧 The trouble with that is that a lot of people choose that topic,
🎧 and it can be difficult to get hold of the books you'll need.
🎧 Why not leave that for another time?
🎧 Right.
🎧 You might find modern novels or 19th century playwrights interesting.
🎧 I've read or seen several plays in translation, so that would be a good idea.
🎧 Fine.
🎧 I'll put you down for that topic.
🎧 Right. So what would you advise me to aim at in the paper?
🎧 First I suggest you avoid taking one writer and going into a great deal of detail.
🎧 That approach certainly has its place,
🎧 but I think you first need to get an understanding of the literature in the context of the society in which it was produced -
🎧 who it was written for, how it was published, and so on.
🎧 I also think that's more fruitful than placing it within the history of the genre.
🎧 OK, that sounds reasonable.
🎧 Could I ask for some advice about writing the paper I'm working on about the Vikings?
🎧 I have to do that this week, and I'm a bit stuck.
🎧 Of course.
🎧 Have you decided yet what to write about?
🎧 No, I haven't.
🎧 There's so much that seems interesting -
🎧 Viking settlement in other countries, trade, mythology…
🎧 Well, what I suggest is that you read an assignment a student wrote last year, which is kept in the library.
🎧 It's short and well focused, and I'm sure you'll find it helpful.
🎧 I'll give you the details in a moment.
🎧 Textbooks usually cover so many topics, it can be very difficult to choose just one.
🎧 OK.
🎧 I've got a DVD of the film about the Vikings that came out earlier this year.
🎧 Should I watch that again?
🎧 If it's the one I am thinking of, hmm, I'd ignore it -
🎧 it's more fantasy than reality.
🎧 But I've got a recording of a documentary that you should watch.
🎧 It makes some interesting and provocative points, which I think will help you to focus your topic.
🎧 Right.
🎧 So then should I work out an outline?
🎧 Yes. Just headings for different sections, at this stage.
🎧 And then you should start looking for suitable articles and books to draw on,
🎧 and take notes which you organise according to those headings.
🎧 I see.
🎧 Then put short phrases and sentences as bullet points under each heading.
🎧 Make sure that this skeleton makes sense and flows properly, before writing up the paper in full.
🎧 OK.
🎧 Thanks, that's very helpful.

[152] Cam12 - Test 2 - Part 4

🎧 Over the years, attitudes towards workers have changed considerably.
🎧 After all, there was a time when workers had no rights at all, and laboured in appalling conditions.
🎧 Conditions have improved a lot, but conflict in the workplace is still common.
🎧 And human resources managers nowadays need to be able to deal with it when necessary.
🎧 What is conflict in the workplace?
🎧 Definitions vary, but I'm taking it to refer to a whole range of behaviours that the victim finds unacceptable,
🎧 from minor, harmless arguments to - at the opposite extreme - physical violence.
🎧 Much of this is covered by the term bullying,
🎧 by which I mean one or more people behaving abusively or aggressively against another who is in a weaker position.
🎧 Although all behaviour like this is a form of conflict, not all conflict can be described in these terms.
🎧 As with all human behaviour, there are numerous reasons for it.
🎧 But often it's caused by someone who feels the need to show their superiority over someone else,
🎧 in order to feel that they aren't at the lowest level in a hierarchy or a group of people.
🎧 In some cases one person simply dislikes the other,
🎧 on the basis that the personality of one is in some way incompatible with that of the other person.
🎧 A general habit of optimism in one person could make them intolerant of a colleague who's constantly pessimistic -
🎧 not that that justifies treating them badly, of course.
🎧 Some conflicts arise when people are more interested in promoting themselves and their team than in the company as a whole.
🎧 These conflicts are called 'structural',
🎧 and could come about, for example, when a sales team believe they are the only people in the business who do any useful work,
🎧 and look down on behind-the-scenes administrators.
🎧 Conflict obviously affects the individuals concerned -
🎧 the situation is likely to be very stressful for victims,
🎧 resulting in their absence from work, possibly for months.
🎧 For the company, if no effort is made to deal with conflict,
🎧 it can spiral out of control, and even lead to the breakdown of the business.
🎧 Some interesting work with chief executives - CEOs -
🎧 has uncovered some of the reasons why they may treat colleagues badly.
🎧 Many CEOs combine two opposing characteristics:
🎧 confidence - that is, the belief that they're capable of great achievements - with a high level of anxiety,
🎧 a fear of missing targets, whether set by themselves or by the directors of the company.
🎧 This combination can make them respond badly to anyone who questions their decisions.
🎧 In a high pressure work environment, such characteristics become problematic.
🎧 And it's particularly difficult to tackle the situation
🎧 where colleagues, managers and board members are all trying to achieve their own visions.
🎧 When they can't agree on strategic issues and on where they see the business going,
🎧 there are real problems.
🎧 For managers at lower levels within the organisation,
🎧 it might seem that an autocratic form of management -
🎧 where the chief executive gives orders and everyone else has to obey -
🎧 would see more conflict than others.
🎧 Interestingly, though, a company with a more democratic business model, can suffer more,
🎧 when uncertainty about who to report to leads to conflicting demands.
🎧 Now I'll say a little about dealing with the type of conflict that has harmful effects.
🎧 Of course the ideal is to prevent it arising in the first place.
🎧 A good manager, at any level, will make efforts to earn the respect of the people they work with,
🎧 particularly those who report to them.
🎧 That will involve politeness in all communications,
🎧 and treating them as equals who happen to have a different role within the organisation.
🎧 Sometimes, of course, conflict does occur, and can get out of hand.
🎧 In such cases the human resources department often gets involved.
🎧 However, if one of the parties in a conflict sees human resources as simply a mouthpiece for the chief executive,
🎧 then an external mediator might be able to help.
🎧 By talking to both sides, and trying to find the truth of what's been happening,
🎧 they can build a clear picture of the situation,
🎧 and give feedback that both sides will accept,
🎧 precisely because they're independent.
