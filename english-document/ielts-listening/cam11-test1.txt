🎧 Hello?
🎧 Oh, hello.
🎧 I wanted to enquire about hiring a room in the Village Hall,
🎧 for the evening of September the first.
🎧 Let me just see…
🎧 Yes, we have both rooms available that evening.
🎧 There's our Main Hall - that's got seating for 200 people.
🎧 Or there's the Charlton Room…
🎧 Sorry?
🎧 The Charlton Room - C-H-A-R-L-T-O-N.
🎧 That's got seating for up to one hundred.
🎧 Well, we're organising a dinner to raise money for a charity,
🎧 and we're hoping for at least 150 people,
🎧 so I think we'll go for the Main Hall.
🎧 How much would that cost?
🎧 Let's see.
🎧 You wanted it for the evening of September the 1st?
🎧 Yes, that's a Saturday.
🎧 So from six pm to midnight
🎧 that'd be £115.
🎧 That's the weekend price, it's £75 on weekdays.
🎧 That's all right.
🎧 And I have to tell you there's also a deposit of £250,
🎧 which is returnable of course as long as there's no damage.
🎧 But we do insist that this is paid in cash,
🎧 we don't take cards for that.
🎧 You can pay the actual rent of the room however you like though - cash, credit card, cheque…
🎧 Oh, well I suppose that's OK.
🎧 So does the charge include use of tables and chairs and so on?
🎧 Oh, yes.
🎧 And what about parking?
🎧 Yeah, that's all included.
🎧 The only thing that isn't included is…
🎧 you said you were organising a dinner?
🎧 Yeah.
🎧 Well, you'll have to pay extra for the kitchen if you want to use that.
🎧 It's £25.
🎧 It's got very good facilities -
🎧 good quality cookers and fridges and so on.
🎧 OK, well I suppose that's all right.
🎧 We can cover the cost in our entry charges.
🎧 Right.
🎧 So I'll make a note of that.
🎧 Now there are just one or two things you need to think about before the event.
🎧 For example, you'll have to see about getting a licence if you're planning to have any music during the meal.
🎧 Oh, really?
🎧 It's quite straightforward, I'll give you the details later on.
🎧 And about a week or ten days before your event you'll need to contact the caretaker, that's Mr Evans,
🎧 to make the arrangements for entry -
🎧 he'll sort that out with you.
🎧 And do I give him the payment as well?
🎧 No, you do that directly with me.
🎧 Right. Now is there anything I need to know about what happens during the event?
🎧 Well, as you'll be aware, of course the building is no smoking throughout.
🎧 Of course.
🎧 Now, are you having a band?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 Well, they'll have a lot of equipment,
🎧 so rather than using the front door they should park their van round the back
🎧 and use the stage door there.
🎧 You can open that from inside but don't forget to lock it at the end.
🎧 OK.
🎧 And talking of bands, I'm sure I don't need to tell you this,
🎧 but you must make sure that no one fiddles about with the black box by the fire door -
🎧 that's a system that cuts in when the volume reaches a certain level.
🎧 It's a legal requirement.
🎧 Sure.
🎧 Anyway, we want people to be able to talk to one another
🎧 so we don't want anything too loud.
🎧 Oh, that reminds me, we'll be having speeches.
🎧 Are there any microphones available?
🎧 Yeah. Just let the caretaker know, he'll get those for you.
🎧 Right, now when the event is over we do ask that the premises are left in good condition.
🎧 So there's a locked cupboard
🎧 and you'll be informed of the code you need to open that.
🎧 It's got all the cleaning equipment, brushes and detergent and so on.
🎧 Right.
🎧 So what do we need to do after everyone's gone?
🎧 Sweep the floors I suppose?
🎧 Well, actually they have to be washed, not just swept.
🎧 Then you'll be provided with black plastic bags,
🎧 so all the rubbish must be collected up and left outside the door.
🎧 Of course.
🎧 We'll make sure everything's left tidy.
🎧 Oh, and I forgot to ask,
🎧 I presume we can have decorations in the room?
🎧 Yes, but you must take them down afterwards.
🎧 Sure.
🎧 And the chairs and tables should be stacked up neatly at the back of the room.
🎧 I'll make sure I've got a few people to help me.

[130] Cam11 - Test 1 - Part 2

🎧 Welcome to the Fiddy Working Heritage Farm.
🎧 This open-air museum gives you the experience of agriculture and rural life in the English countryside at the end of the 19th century.
🎧 So you'll see a typical farm of that period,
🎧 and like me, all the staff are dressed in clothes of that time.
🎧 I must give you some advice and safety tips before we go any further.
🎧 As it's a working farm, please don't frighten or injure the animals.
🎧 We have a lot here, and many of them are breeds that are now quite rare.
🎧 And do stay at a safe distance from the tools:
🎧 some of them have sharp points which can be pretty dangerous,
🎧 so please don't touch them.
🎧 We don't want any accidents, do we?
🎧 The ground is very uneven,
🎧 and you might slip if you're wearing sandals
🎧 so I'm glad to see you're all wearing shoes -
🎧 we always advise people to do that.
🎧 Now, children of all ages are very welcome here,
🎧 and usually even very young children love the ducks and lambs,
🎧 so do bring them along next time you come.
🎧 I don't think any of you have brought dogs with you,
🎧 but in case you have, I'm afraid they'll have to stay in the car park unless they're guide dogs.
🎧 I'm sure you'll understand that they could cause a lot of problems on a farm.
🎧 Now let me give you some idea of the layout of the farm.
🎧 The building where you bought your tickets is the New Barn, immediately to your right,
🎧 and we're now at the beginning of the main path to the farmland -
🎧 and of course the car park is on your left.
🎧 The scarecrow you can see in the car park in the corner, beside the main path,
🎧 is a traditional figure for keeping the birds away from crops,
🎧 but our scarecrow is a permanent sculpture.
🎧 It's taller than a human being, so you can see it from quite a distance.
🎧 If you look ahead of you, you'll see a maze.
🎧 It's opposite the New Barn, beside the side path that branches off to the right just over there.
🎧 The maze is made out of hedges which are too tall for young children to see over them,
🎧 but it's quite small, so you can't get lost in it!
🎧 Now, can you see the bridge crossing the fish pool further up the main path?
🎧 If you want to go to the café, go towards the bridge and turn right just before it.
🎧 Walk along the side path and the café's on the first bend you come to.
🎧 The building was originally the schoolhouse, and it's well over a hundred years old.
🎧 As you may know, we run skills workshops here,
🎧 where you can learn traditional crafts like woodwork and basket-making.
🎧 You can see examples of the work, and talk to someone about the courses, in the Black Barn.
🎧 If you take the side path to the right, here, just by the New Barn,
🎧 you'll come to the Black Barn just where the path first bends.
🎧 Now I mustn't forget to tell you about picnicking,
🎧 as I can see some of you have brought your lunch with you.
🎧 You can picnic in the field, though do clear up behind you, of course.
🎧 Or if you'd prefer a covered picnic area, there's one near the farmyard:
🎧 just after you cross the bridge,
🎧 there's a covered picnic spot on the right.
🎧 And the last thing to mention is Fiddy House itself.
🎧 From here you can cross the bridge
🎧 then walk along the footpath through the field to the left of the farmyard.
🎧 That goes to the house, and it'll give you a lovely view of it.
🎧 It's certainly worth a few photographs,
🎧 but as it's a private home, I'm afraid you can't go inside.
🎧 Right. Well, if you're all ready, we'll set off on our tour of the farm.

[131] Cam11 - Test 1 - Part 3

🎧 OK, Greg, so I finally managed to read the article you mentioned -
🎧 the one about the study on gender in physics.
🎧 About the study of college students done by Akira Miyake and his team?
🎧 I was interested that the researchers were actually a mix of psychologists and physicists.
🎧 That's an unusual combination.
🎧 Yeah.
🎧 I got a little confused at first about which students the study was based on.
🎧 They weren't actually majoring in physics -
🎧 they were majoring in what's known as the STEM disciplines.
🎧 That's science, technology, engineering and… and math.
🎧 Yes, but they were all doing physics courses as part of their studies.
🎧 That's correct.
🎧 So as I understood it,
🎧 Miyake and co started from the fact that women are underrepresented
🎧 in introductory physics courses at college,
🎧 and also that on average,
🎧 the women who do enrol on these courses perform more poorly than the men.
🎧 No one really knows why this is the case.
🎧 Yeah. But what the researchers wanted to find out
🎧 was basically what they could do about the relatively low level of the women's results.
🎧 But in order to find a solution
🎧 they needed to find out more about the nature of the problem.
🎧 Right - now let's see if I can remember…
🎧 it was that in the physics class,
🎧 the female students thought the male students all assumed that women weren't any good at physics…
🎧 was that it?
🎧 And they thought that the men expected them to get poor results in their tests.
🎧 That's what the women thought, and that made them nervous, so they did get poor results.
🎧 But actually they were wrong…
🎧 No one was making any assumptions about the female students at all.
🎧 Anyway, what Miyake's team did was quite simple -
🎧 getting the students to do some writing before they went into the physics class.
🎧 What did they call it?
🎧 Values-affirmation -
🎧 they had to write an essay focusing on things that were significant to them,
🎧 not particularly to do with the subject they were studying,
🎧 but more general things like music or people who mattered to them.
🎧 Right.
🎧 So the idea of doing the writing is that this gets the students thinking in a positive way.
🎧 And putting these thoughts into words can relax them and help them overcome the psychological factors
🎧 that lead to poor performance. Yeah.
🎧 But what the researchers in the study hadn't expected
🎧 was that this one activity raised the women's physics grades from the C to the B range.
🎧 A huge change.
🎧 Pity it wasn't to an A, but still!
🎧 No, but it does suggest that the women were seriously underperforming beforehand, in comparison with the men.
🎧 Yes. Mind you, Miyake's article left out a lot of details.
🎧 Like, did the students do the writing just once, or several times?
🎧 And had they been told why they were doing the writing?
🎧 That might have affected the results.
🎧 You mean, if they know the researchers thought it might help them to improve,
🎧 then they'd just try to fulfill that expectation?
🎧 Exactly.
🎧 So anyway, I thought for our project we could do a similar study,
🎧 but investigate whether it really was the writing activity that had that result.
🎧 OK.
🎧 So we could ask them to do a writing task about something completely different…
🎧 something more factual?
🎧 Like a general knowledge topic.
🎧 Maybe…
🎧 or we could have half the students doing a writing task
🎧 and half doing something else, like an oral task.
🎧 Or even, half do the same writing task as in the original research
🎧 and half do a factual writing task.
🎧 Then we'd see if it really is the topic that made the difference, or something else.
🎧 That's it. Good.
🎧 So at our meeting with the supervisor on Monday
🎧 we can tell him we've decided on our project.
🎧 We should have our aims ready by then.
🎧 I suppose we need to read the original study - the article's just a summary.
🎧 And there was another article I read, by Smolinsky.
🎧 It was about her research on how women and men perform in mixed teams in class,
🎧 compared with single-sex teams and on their own.
🎧 Let me guess… the women were better at teamwork.
🎧 That's what I expected,
🎧 but actually the men and the women got the same results
🎧 whether they were working in teams or on their own.
🎧 But I guess it's not that relevant to us.
🎧 What worries me anyway is how we're going to get everything done in the time.
🎧 We'll be OK now we know what we're doing.
🎧 Though I'm not clear how we assess whether the students in our experiment actually make any progress or not…
🎧 No.
🎧 We may need some advice on that.
🎧 The main thing's to make sure we have the right size sample,
🎧 not too big or too small.
🎧 That shouldn't be difficult.
🎧 Right, what do we need to do next?
🎧 We could have a look at the timetable for the science classes…
🎧 or perhaps we should just make an appointment to see one of the science professors.
🎧 That'd be better.
🎧 Great.
🎧 And we could even get to observe one of the classes.
🎧 What for?
🎧 Well… OK maybe let's just go with your idea.
🎧 Right, well…

[132] Cam11 - Test 1 - Part 4

🎧 I've been looking at ocean biodiversity,
🎧 that's the diversity of species that live in the world's oceans.
🎧 About 20 years ago,
🎧 biologists developed the idea of what they called 'biodiversity hotspots'.
🎧 These are the areas which have the greatest mixture of species,
🎧 so one example is Madagascar.
🎧 These hotspots are significant
🎧 because they allow us to locate key areas for focusing efforts at conservation.
🎧 Biologists can identify hotspots on land, fairly easily,
🎧 but until recently, very little was known about species distribution and diversity in the oceans,
🎧 and no one even knew if hotspots existed there.
🎧 Then a Canadian biologist called Boris Worm
🎧 did some research in 2005 on data on ocean species that he got from the fishing industry.
🎧 Worm located five hotspots for large ocean predators like sharks,
🎧 and looked at what they had in common.
🎧 The main thing he'd expected to find was that they had very high concentrations of food,
🎧 but to his surprise that was only true for four of the hotspots -
🎧 the remaining hotspot was quite badly off in that regard.
🎧 But what he did find was that in all cases,
🎧 the water at the surface of the ocean had relatively high temperatures,
🎧 even when it was cool at greater depths,
🎧 so this seemed to be a factor in supporting a diverse range of these large predators.
🎧 However, this wasn't enough on its own,
🎧 because he also found that the water needed to have enough oxygen in it -
🎧 so these two factors seemed necessary to support the high metabolic rate of these large fish.
🎧 A couple of years later, in 2007,
🎧 a researcher called Lisa Balance, who was working in California,
🎧 also started looking for ocean hotspots, but not for fish -
🎧 what she was interested in was marine mammals, things like seals.
🎧 And she found three places in the oceans which were hotspots,
🎧 and what these had in common was that these hotspots were all located at boundaries between ocean currents,
🎧 and this seems to be the sort of place that has lots of the plankton that some of these species feed on.
🎧 So now people who want to protect the species that are endangered need to get as much information as possible.
🎧 For example, there's an international project called the Census of Marine Life.
🎧 They've been surveying oceans all over the world, including the Arctic.
🎧 One thing they found there which stunned other researchers
🎧 was that there were large numbers of species which live below the ice -
🎧 sometimes under a layer up to 20 metres thick.
🎧 Some of these species had never been seen before.
🎧 They've even found species of octopus living in these conditions.
🎧 And other scientists working on the same project,
🎧 but researching very different habitats on the ocean floor,
🎧 have found large numbers of species congregating around volcanoes,
🎧 attracted to them by the warmth and nutrients there.
🎧 However, biologists still don't know how serious the threat to their survival is for each individual species.
🎧 So a body called the Global Marine Species Assessment is now creating a list of endangered species on land,
🎧 so they consider things like the size of the population -
🎧 how many members of one species there are in a particular place -
🎧 and then they look at their distribution in geographical terms,
🎧 although this is quite difficult when you're looking at fish, because they're so mobile,
🎧 and then thirdly they calculate the rate at which the decline of the species is happening.
🎧 So far only 1,500 species have been assessed,
🎧 but they want to increase this figure to 20,000.
🎧 For each one they assess,
🎧 they use the data they collect on that species to produce a map showing its distribution.
🎧 Ultimately they will be able to use these to figure out not only where most species are located
🎧 but also where they are most threatened.
🎧 So finally, what can be done to retain the diversity of species in the world's oceans?
🎧 Firstly, we need to set up more reserves in our oceans,
🎧 places where marine species are protected.
🎧 We have some, but not enough.
🎧 In addition, to preserve species such as leatherback turtles,
🎧 which live out in the high seas but have their nesting sites on the American coast,
🎧 we need to create corridors for migration,
🎧 so they can get from one area to another safely.
🎧 As well as this, action needs to be taken to lower the levels of fishing quotas
🎧 to prevent overfishing of endangered species.
🎧 And finally, there's the problem of 'by-catch'.
🎧 This refers to the catching of unwanted fish by fishing boats -
🎧 they're returned to the sea, but they're often dead or dying.
🎧 If these commercial fishing boats used equipment which was more selective,
🎧 so that only the fish wanted for consumption were caught,
🎧 this problem could be overcome.
🎧 OK. So does anyone have any…
