🎧 Excuse me.
🎧 Would you mind if I asked you some questions?
🎧 We're doing a survey on transport.
🎧 Yes, that's OK.
🎧 First of all, can I take your name?
🎧 Yes. It's Sadie Jones.
🎧 Thanks very much.
🎧 And could I have your date of birth - just the year will do, actually.
🎧 Is that alright?
🎧 Yes, that's fine.
🎧 It's 1991.
🎧 So, next, your postcode, please.
🎧 It's DW307YZ.
🎧 Great. Thanks.
🎧 Is that in Wells?
🎧 No it's actually in Harborne.
🎧 Wells isn't far from there, though.
🎧 I really like that area.
🎧 My grandmother lived there when I was a kid.
🎧 Yes, it is nice.
🎧 Right, so now I want to ask you some questions about how you travelled here today.
🎧 Did you use public transport?
🎧 Yes. I came by bus.
🎧 OK. And that was today.
🎧 It's the 24th of April, isn't it?
🎧 Isn't it the 25th?
🎧 Ah... no, actually, you're right.
🎧 And what was the reason for your trip today?
🎧 I can see you've got some shopping with you.
🎧 Yes. I did some shopping
🎧 but the main reason I came here was to go to the dentist.
🎧 That's not much fun.
🎧 Hope it was nothing serious.
🎧 No, it was just a check-up.
🎧 It's fine.
🎧 Good.
🎧 Do you normally travel by bus into the city centre?
🎧 Yes. I stopped driving in ages ago
🎧 because parking was so difficult to find
🎧 and it costs so much.
🎧 I see.
🎧 The bus is much more convenient too.
🎧 It only takes about 30 minutes.
🎧 That's good.
🎧 So where did you start your journey?
🎧 At the bus stop on Claxby Street.
🎧 Is that C-L-A-X-B-Y?
🎧 That's right.
🎧 And how satisfied with the service are you?
🎧 Do you have any complaints?
🎧 Well, as I said, it's very convenient and quick when it's on time,
🎧 but this morning it was late.
🎧 Only about 10 minutes, but still.
🎧 Yes, I understand that's annoying.
🎧 And what about the timetable?
🎧 Do you have any comments about that?
🎧 I suppose I mainly use the bus during the day,
🎧 but any time I've been in town in the evening, for dinner or at the cinema,
🎧 I've noticed you have to wait a long time for a bus.
🎧 There aren't that many.
🎧 OK, thanks.
🎧 So now I'd like to ask you about your car use.
🎧 Well, I have got a car but I don't use it that often.
🎧 Mainly just to go to the supermarket.
🎧 But that's about it really.
🎧 My husband uses it at the weekends to go to the golf club.
🎧 And what about a bicycle?
🎧 I don't actually have one at the moment.
🎧 What about the city bikes you can rent?
🎧 Do you ever use those?
🎧 No, I'm not keen on cycling there because of all the pollution.
🎧 But I would like to get a bike, it would be good to use it to get to work.
🎧 So why haven't you got one now?
🎧 Well, I live in a flat, on the second floor
🎧 and it doesn't have any storage,
🎧 so we'd have to leave it in the hall outside the flat.
🎧 I see.
🎧 OK. Well, I think that's all...
🎧 
🎧 Good evening, everyone.
🎧 Let me start by welcoming you all to this talk and thanking you for taking the time to consider joining ACE voluntary organisation.
🎧 ACE offers support to people and services in the local area
🎧 and we're now looking for more volunteers to help us do this.
🎧 By the way, I hope you're all comfortable,
🎧 we have brought in extra seats so that no one has to stand,
🎧 but it does mean that the people at the back of the room may be a bit squashed.
🎧 We'll only be here for about half an hour so, hopefully, that's OK.
🎧 One of the first questions we're often asked is how old you need to be to volunteer.
🎧 Well, you can be as young as 16 or you can be 60 or over:
🎧 it all depends on what type of voluntary work you want to do.
🎧 Other considerations, such as reliability, are crucial in voluntary work
🎧 and age isn't related to these, in our experience.
🎧 Another question we get asked relates to training.
🎧 Well, there's plenty of that and it's all face-to-face.
🎧 What's more, training doesn't end when you start working for us.
🎧 It takes place before, during and after periods of work.
🎧 Often, it's run by other experienced volunteers as managers tend to prefer to get on with other things.
🎧 Now, I would ask you to consider a couple of important issues
🎧 before you decide to apply for voluntary work.
🎧 We don't worry about why you want to be a volunteer -
🎧 people have many different reasons that range from getting work experience to just doing something they've always wanted to do.
🎧 But it is critical that you have enough hours in the day for whatever role we agree is suitable for you -
🎧 if being a volunteer becomes stressful then it's best not to do it at all.
🎧 You may think that your income is important, but we don't ask about that.
🎧 It's up to you to decide if you can work without earning money.
🎧 What we value is dedication.
🎧 Some of our most loyal volunteers earn very little themselves
🎧 but still give their full energy to the work they do with us.
🎧 OK, so let's take a look at some of the work areas that we need volunteers for
🎧 and the sort of things that would help you in those.
🎧 You may wish simply to help us raise money.
🎧 If you have the creativity to come up with an imaginative or novel way of fundraising, we'd be delighted,
🎧 as standing in the local streets or shops with a collection box can be rather boring!
🎧 One outdoor activity that we need volunteers for is litter collection
🎧 and for this, it's useful if you can walk for long periods, sometimes uphill.
🎧 Some of our regular collectors are quite elderly,
🎧 but very active and keen to protect the environment.
🎧 If you enjoy working with children, we have three vacancies for what are called 'playmates'.
🎧 These volunteers help children learn about staying healthy through a range of out-of-school activities.
🎧 You don't need to have children yourself,
🎧 but it's good if you know something about nutrition and can give clear instructions.
🎧 If that doesn't appeal to you,
🎧 maybe you would be interested in helping out at our story club for disabled children,
🎧 especially if you have done some acting.
🎧 We put on three performances a year based on books they have read
🎧 and we're always looking for support with the theatrical side of this.
🎧 The last area I'll mention today is first aid.
🎧 Volunteers who join this group can end up teaching others in vulnerable groups who may be at risk of injury.
🎧 Initially, though, your priority will be to take in a lot of information
🎧 and not forget any important steps or details.
🎧 Right, so does anyone have any questions...
🎧 
🎧 Hi Chantal. What did you think of the talk, then?
🎧 Hi Hugo.
🎧 I thought it was good once I'd moved seats.
🎧 Oh, were the people beside you chatting or something?
🎧 It wasn't that.
🎧 I went early so that I'd get a seat and not have to stand,
🎧 but then this guy sat right in front of me and he was so tall!
🎧 It's hard to see through people's heads, isn't it?
🎧 Impossible!
🎧 Anyway, to answer your question,
🎧 I thought it was really interesting,
🎧 especially what the speaker said about the job market.
🎧 Me too.
🎧 I mean we know we're going into a really competitive field so it's obvious that we may struggle to get work.
🎧 That's right,
🎧 and we know we can't all have that 'dream job'.
🎧 Yeah, but it looks like there's a whole range of... areas of work that we hadn't even thought of,
🎧 like fashion journalism, for instance.
🎧 Yeah, I wasn't expecting so many career options.
🎧 Overall, she had quite a strong message, didn't she?
🎧 She did.
🎧 She kept saying things like 'I know you all think this, but...'
🎧 and then she'd tell us how it really is.
🎧 Perhaps she thinks students are a bit narrow-minded about the industry.
🎧 It was a bit harsh, though!
🎧 We know it's a tough industry.
🎧 Yeah, and we're only first-years, after all.
🎧 We've got a lot to learn.
🎧 Exactly.
🎧 Do you think our secondary school education should have been more career-focused?
🎧 Well, we had numerous talks on careers, which was good,
🎧 but none of them were very inspiring.
🎧 They could've asked more people like today's speaker to talk to us.
🎧 I agree.
🎧 We were told about lots of different careers, just when we needed to be,
🎧 but not by the experts who really know stuff.
🎧 So did today's talk influence your thoughts on what career you'd like to take up in the future?
🎧 Well. I promised myself that I'd go through this course and keep an open mind till the end.
🎧 But I think it's better to pick an area of the industry now and then aim to get better and better at it.
🎧 Well, I think we'll just have to differ on that issue!
🎧 One thing's for certain, though.
🎧 From what she said, we'll be unpaid assistants in the industry for quite a long time.
🎧 I'm prepared for that, aren't you?
🎧 Actually, I'm not going to accept that view.
🎧 Really?
🎧 But she knows it's the case,
🎧 and everyone else says the same.
🎧 That doesn't mean it has to be true for me.
🎧 OK.
🎧 Well, I hope you're right!
🎧 I thought the speaker's account of her first job was fascinating.
🎧 Yeah, she admitted she was lucky to get work being a personal dresser for a musician.
🎧 She didn't even apply for the job
🎧 and there she was getting paid to choose all his clothes.
🎧 It must have felt amazing,
🎧 though she said all she was looking for back then was experience, not financial reward.
🎧 And then he was so mean, telling her she was more interested in her own appearance than his!
🎧 But she did realise he was right about that,
🎧 which really made me think.
🎧 I'm always considering my own clothes
🎧 but now I can see you should be focusing on your client!
🎧 She obviously regretted losing the job.
🎧 Well, as she said, she should have hidden her negative feelings about him, but she didn't.
🎧 It was really brave the way she picked herself up and took that job in retail.
🎧 Fancy working in a shop after that!
🎧 Yeah, well, she recommended we all do it at some point.
🎧 I guess as a designer you'd get to find out some useful information,
🎧 like how big or small the average shopper is.
🎧 I think that's an issue for manufacturers, not designers.
🎧 However, it would be useful to know if there's a gap in the market, you know,
🎧 an item that no one's stocking but that consumers are looking for.
🎧 Yeah, people don't give up searching.
🎧 They also take things back to the store if they aren't right.
🎧 Yeah.
🎧 Imagine you worked in an expensive shop
🎧 and you found out the garments sold there were being returned because they... fell apart in the wash!
🎧 Yeah, it would be good to know that kind of thing.
🎧 
🎧 For my presentation today
🎧 I want to tell you about how groups of elephants have been moved and settled in new reserves.
🎧 This is known as translocation and has been carried out in Malawi in Africa in recent years.
🎧 The reason this is being done is because of overpopulation of elephants in some areas.
🎧 Overpopulation is a good problem to have
🎧 and not one we tend to hear about very often.
🎧 In Malawi's Majete National Park
🎧 the elephant population had been wiped out by poachers,
🎧 who killed the elephants for their ivory.
🎧 But in 2003,
🎧 the park was restocked and effective law enforcement was introduced.
🎧 Since then, not a single elephant has been poached.
🎧 In this safe environment, the elephant population boomed.
🎧 Breeding went so well that there were more elephants than the park could support.
🎧 This led to a number of problems.
🎧 Firstly, there was more competition for food,
🎧 which meant that some elephants were suffering from hunger.
🎧 As there was a limit to the amount of food in the national park,
🎧 some elephants began looking further afield.
🎧 Elephants were routinely knocking down fences around the park,
🎧 which then had to be repaired at a significant cost.
🎧 To solve this problem,
🎧 the decision was made to move dozens of elephants from Majete National Park to Nkhotakota Wildlife Park,
🎧 where there were no elephants.
🎧 But, obviously, attempting to move significant numbers of elephants to a new home 300 kilometres away is quite a challenge.
🎧 So how did this translocation process work in practice?
🎧 Elephants were moved in groups of between eight and twenty,
🎧 all belonging to one family.
🎧 Because relationships are very important to elephants,
🎧 they all had to be moved at the same time.
🎧 A team of vets and park rangers flew over the park in helicopters and targeted a group,
🎧 which were rounded up and directed to a designated open plain.
🎧 The vets then used darts to immobilise the elephants.
🎧 This was a tricky manoeuvre,
🎧 as they not only had to select the right dose of tranquiliser for different-sized elephants
🎧 but they had to dart the elephants as they were running around.
🎧 This also had to be done as quickly as possible
🎧 so as to minimise the stress caused.
🎧 As soon as the elephants began to flop onto the ground,
🎧 the team moved in to take care of them.
🎧 To avoid the risk of suffocation,
🎧 the team had to make sure none of the elephants were lying on their chests
🎧 because their lungs could be crushed in this position.
🎧 So all the elephants had to be placed on their sides.
🎧 One person stayed with each elephant
🎧 while they waited for the vets to do checks.
🎧 It was very important to keep an eye on their breathing.
🎧 If there were fewer than six breaths per minute,
🎧 the elephant would need urgent medical attention.
🎧 Collars were fitted to the matriarch in each group
🎧 so their movements could be tracked in their new home.
🎧 Measurements were taken of each elephant's tusks.
🎧 Elephants with large tusks would be at greater risk from poachers
🎧 and also of their feet.
🎧 The elephants were then taken to a recovery area
🎧 before being loaded onto trucks and transported to their new home.
🎧 The elephants translocated to Nkhotakota settled in very well
🎧 and the project has generally been accepted to have been a huge success
🎧 and not just for the elephants.
🎧 Employment prospects have improved enormously,
🎧 contributing to rising living standards for the whole community.
🎧 Poaching is no longer an issue,
🎧 as former poachers are able to find more reliable sources of income.
🎧 In fact, many of them volunteered to give up their weapons,
🎧 as they were no longer of any use to them.
🎧 More than two dozen elephants have been born at Nkhotakota since relocation.
🎧 With an area of more than 1,800 square kilometres,
🎧 there's plenty of space for the elephant population to continue to grow.
🎧 Their presence is also helping to rebalance Nkhotakota's damaged ecosystem
🎧 and providing a sustainable conservation model, which could be replicated in other parks.
🎧 All this has been a big draw for tourism,
🎧 which contributes five times more than the illegal wildlife trade to GDP,
🎧 and this is mainly because of the elephants.
🎧 There's also been a dramatic rise...
