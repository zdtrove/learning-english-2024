[017] Cam4 - Test 1 - Part 1

🎧 Good morning.
🎧 Good morning.
🎧 How can I help you?
🎧 I understand that the school organises... um, trips to different...
🎧 Yes, we run five every month:
🎧 three during weekends and two Wednesday afternoon trips.
🎧 What sort of places?
🎧 Well, obviously it varies,
🎧 but always places of historical interest
🎧 and also which offer a variety of shopping, because our students always ask about that...
🎧 and then we go for ones where we know there are guided tours,
🎧 because this gives a good focus for the visit.
🎧 Do you travel far?
🎧 Well, we're lucky here, obviously,
🎧 because we're able to say that all our visits are less than three hours drive.
🎧 How much do they cost?
🎧 Again, it varies,
🎧 between five and fifteen pounds a head, depending on distance.
🎧 Oh, and we do offer to arrange special trips if, you know, there are more than twelve people.
🎧 Oh right, I'll keep that in mind.
🎧 And what are the times normally?
🎧 We try to keep it pretty fixed so that, that students get to know the pattern.
🎧 We leave at 8.30 a.m. and return at 6 p.m.
🎧 We figure it's best to keep the day fairly short.
🎧 Oh yes. And, um, how do we reserve a place?
🎧 You sign your name on the notice board.
🎧 Do you know where it is?
🎧 Ah ha. I saw it this morning.
🎧 And we do ask that you sign up three days in advance
🎧 so we know we've got enough people interested to run it,
🎧 and we can cancel if necessary, with full refund of course.
🎧 That's fine, thanks.
🎧 And what visits are planned for this term?
🎧 Right, well, I'm afraid the schedule hasn't been printed out yet,
🎧 but, uh... we have confirmed the dates and planned the optional extra visits
🎧 which you can also book in advance if you want to.
🎧 Oh that's all right.
🎧 If you can just give some idea of the weekend ones
🎧 so I can, you know, work out when to see friends, etcetera.
🎧 Oh sure.
🎧 Well, the first one is St Ives.
🎧 That's on the 13th of February
🎧 and we'll have only sixteen places available 'cos we're going by minibus.
🎧 And that's a day in town with the optional extra of visiting the Hepworth Museum.
🎧 Oh right... yeah... that sounds good.
🎧 Then there's a London trip on the sixteenth of February
🎧 and we'll be taking a medium-sized coach so there'll be 45 places on that,
🎧 and, let's see, the optional extra is the Tower of London.
🎧 Oh, I've already been there.
🎧 After that there's Bristol on the 3rd of March.
🎧 Where?
🎧 Bristol...
🎧 BRISTOL.
🎧 Okay...
🎧 That's in a different minibus with 18 places available,
🎧 oh, and the optional extra is a visit to the S.S. Great Britain.
🎧 Okay...
🎧 We're going to Salisbury on the eighteenth of March
🎧 and that's always a popular one because the optional extra is Stonehenge,
🎧 so we're taking the large coach with fifty seats...
🎧 Oh good.
🎧 And then the last one is to Bath on the 23rd of March.
🎧 Oh yes. Is Bath the Roman city?
🎧 Yes, that's right,
🎧 and that's in the sixteen-seater minibus.
🎧 And where's the optional visit?
🎧 It's to the American Museum - well worth a visit.
🎧 Okay, well that's great, thanks for all that...
🎧 My pleasure.
🎧 By the way, if you want more information about any of the trips,
🎧 have a look in the student newspaper.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 Or, have a word with my assistant;
🎧 her name is Jane Yentob -
🎧 that's YENTOB.
🎧 Right, I've got that.
🎧 Thank you very much for all your help.
🎧 You're very welcome.
🎧 I hope you enjoy the trips.

[018] Cam4 - Test 1 - Part 2

🎧 Good afternoon everybody
🎧 and welcome to Riverside Industrial Village.
🎧 To start your visit, I'm just going to give you a brief account of the history of the museum
🎧 before letting you roam about on your own.
🎧 I won't keep you long. Okay?
🎧 Now, from where we're standing
🎧 you've got a good view of the river over there.
🎧 And it was because of this fast-flowing water
🎧 that this site was a natural place for manufacturing works.
🎧 The water and the availability of raw materials in the area, like minerals and iron ore,
🎧 and also the abundance of local fuels, like coal and firewood,
🎧 all made this site suitable for industry from a very early time.
🎧 Water was the main source of power for the early industries
🎧 and some of the water wheels were first established in the 12th century, would you believe?
🎧 At that time, local craftsmen first built an iron forge
🎧 just behind the village here, on the bend in the river.
🎧 By the 17th and 18th centuries,
🎧 the region's rivers supported more than 160 water mills -
🎧 and many of these continued to operate well into the 19th century.
🎧 But then, the steam engine was invented
🎧 and then the railways came
🎧 and the centres of industry were able to move away from the rivers and the countryside and into the towns.
🎧 So, industrial villages like this one became very rare.
🎧 So, that's the history for you.
🎧 If you'd like any more information, you can ask me some questions,
🎧 or you can read further in our excellent guide book.
🎧 Now I'm going to give you a plan of the site
🎧 and I'd just like to point out where everything is
🎧 and then you can take a look at everything for yourself.
🎧 I've already pointed out the river, which is on the left.
🎧 And of course, running along the bottom is Woodside Road,
🎧 got it?
🎧 Okay.
🎧 Now, we're standing at the entrance,
🎧 see it at the bottom,
🎧 and immediately to our right is the Ticket Office.
🎧 You won't need that because you've got your group booking,
🎧 but just past it are the toilets -
🎧 always good to know where they are.
🎧 In front of us is the car park, as you can see,
🎧 and to the left, by the entry gate is the Gift Shop.
🎧 That's where you can get copies of the guide, like this one here.
🎧 Now, beyond the car park,
🎧 all the buildings are arranged in a half circle with a yard in the middle.
🎧 The big, stone building at the top is the main Workshop.
🎧 That's where the furnace is
🎧 and where all the metal was smelted and the tools were cast,
🎧 as you'll be able to see.
🎧 Now, in the top right-hand corner,
🎧 that building with bigger windows is the Showroom,
🎧 where samples of all the tools that were made through the ages are on display.
🎧 In the top left corner is the Grinding Shop,
🎧 where the tools were sharpened and finished.
🎧 And on one side of that you can see the Engine Room
🎧 and on the other is the Café,
🎧 which isn't an antique, you'll be pleased to know,
🎧 though they do serve very nice old-fashioned teas.
🎧 The row of buildings you can see on the left are the cottages.
🎧 These were built for the workers towards the end of the 18th century
🎧 and they're still furnished from that period
🎧 so you can get a good idea of ordinary people's living conditions.
🎧 Across the yard from them,
🎧 you can see the stables where the horses were kept for transporting the products.
🎧 And the separate building in front of them is the Works Office
🎧 and that still has some of the old accounts on display.
🎧 Right, if anyone wants a guided tour then I'm starting at the Engine Room.
🎧 If you'd like to come along, this way please, ladies and gentlemen.

[019] Cam4 - Test 1 - Part 3

🎧 Excuse me, Dr Johnson.
🎧 May I speak to you for a minute?
🎧 Sure. Come in.
🎧 I'm Melanie Griffin.
🎧 I'm taking your course in Population Studies.
🎧 Right. Well, Melanie, how can I help you?
🎧 I'm having a bit of trouble with the second assignment,
🎧 and it's due in 12 days.
🎧 What sort of trouble are you having?
🎧 Is the assignment question a problem?
🎧 Well, that's part of the problem.
🎧 I'm also having - been having trouble getting hold of the books.
🎧 I've been to the library several times, and all the books are out.
🎧 Sounds like you should have started borrowing books a bit earlier.
🎧 Well, I had a really big assignment due in for another course, and...
🎧 I've been spending all my time on that, and I thought...
🎧 You might get an extension of time to finish your assignment for me?
🎧 If that's possible, but I don't know...
🎧 Well, yes, it is possible, but...
🎧 extensions are normally given only for medical or compassionate reasons,
🎧 otherwise, it's really a question of organising your study,
🎧 and we don't like giving extensions to students who simply didn't plan their work properly.
🎧 What did you get for your first assignment?
🎧 I got 87%.
🎧 Yes, you did very well indeed,
🎧 so obviously, you can produce good work.
🎧 I don't think I'll need too much extra time,
🎧 as long as I can get hold of some of the important references.
🎧 Well, since you did so well in your first assignment,
🎧 I'm prepared to give you an extra two weeks for this one,
🎧 so that'll mean you'll need to submit it about a month from now.
🎧 Thank you.
🎧 Now, what about the reading materials?
🎧 Have you checked out the journal articles in the list?
🎧 Umm, no, not yet,
🎧 there were about 20 of them, and...
🎧 I wasn't sure which ones would be most useful or important.
🎧 Well, they're all useful,
🎧 but I don't expect anyone to read them all, because a number of them deal with the same issues.
🎧 Let me give you some suggestions.
🎧 The article by Anderson and Hawker is really worth reading.
🎧 Right, I'll read that one.
🎧 You should also read the article by Jackson,
🎧 but just look at the part on the research methodology - how they did it.
🎧 Okay...
🎧 Jackson, got that...
🎧 And if you have time, the one by Roberts says very relevant things,
🎧 although it's not essential.
🎧 Okay, if it's useful, I'll try and read that one...
🎧 Now, the one by Morris.
🎧 I wouldn't bother with that at this stage, if I were you.
🎧 Okay, I won't bother with Morris.
🎧 Oh, now, someone told me the article by Cooper is important.
🎧 Well, yes, in a way,
🎧 but just look at the last part, where he discusses the research results.
🎧 And lastly, there's Forster -
🎧 I can't think why I included that one.
🎧 It's not bad and could be of some help, but not that much.
🎧 Now, let's deal with the assignment question.
🎧 What's the problem there?
🎧 It's the graph on page two.
🎧 What seems to be the problem? It's just the bar graph showing reasons why people change where they live.
🎧 Well, I've got a photocopy but the reasons at the bottom are missing.
🎧 Ah, okay.
🎧 Look at the first bar on the graph -
🎧 now that indicates the number of people who move because they want more space.
🎧 Oh I see...
🎧 bar one... okay...
🎧 Now what about the next bar?
🎧 Bar two is to do with the people living nearby disturbing them,
🎧 so they chose to move away to somewhere quieter.
🎧 Now let's look at bar number three...
🎧 another reason people change their place of living
🎧 is because they want to be closer to the city.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 Proximity to the city is an issue...
🎧 Now, bar number four refers to problems when the owner of the property won't help fix things that go wrong.
🎧 In other words, the owner is not helpful and so the tenants move out.
🎧 Okay...
🎧 Now what about bar five?
🎧 Bar five is about those people who move because...
🎧 they need a bus or train to get them into the city or to go to work.
🎧 Okay...
🎧 And bar six?
🎧 Bar number six is interesting.
🎧 That reason was given quite a lot -
🎧 people moving because they wanted to be in a more attractive neighbourhood.
🎧 Oh, yes, thank you very much.

[020] Cam4 - Test 1 - Part 4

🎧 Good day, ladies and gentlemen.
🎧 I have been asked today to talk to you about the urban landscape.
🎧 There are two major areas that I will focus on in my talk:
🎧 how vegetation can have a significant effect on urban climate,
🎧 and how we can better plan our cities using trees
🎧 to provide a more comfortable environment for us to live in.
🎧 Trees can have a significant impact on our cities.
🎧 They can make a city, as a whole, a bit less windy
🎧 or a bit more windy, if that's what you want.
🎧 They can make it a bit cooler if it's a hot summer day in an Australian city,
🎧 or they can make it a bit more humid if it's a dry inland city.
🎧 On the local scale - that is, in particular areas within the city -
🎧 trees can make the local area more shady, cooler,
🎧 more humid and much less windy.
🎧 In fact, trees and planting of various kinds
🎧 can be used to make city streets actually less dangerous in particular areas.
🎧 How do trees do all that, you ask?
🎧 Well, the main difference between a tree and a building
🎧 is a tree has got an internal mechanism to keep the temperature regulated.
🎧 It evaporates water through its leaves
🎧 and that means that the temperature of the leaves is never very far from our own body temperature.
🎧 The temperature of a building surface on a hot sunny day
🎧 can easily be twenty degrees more than our temperature.
🎧 Trees, on the other hand, remain cooler than buildings because they sweat.
🎧 This means that they can humidify the air and cool it -
🎧 a property which can be exploited to improve the local climate.
🎧 Trees can also help break the force of winds.
🎧 The reason that high buildings make it windier at ground level is that,
🎧 as the wind goes higher and higher, it goes faster and faster.
🎧 When the wind hits the building, it has to go somewhere.
🎧 Some of it goes over the top and some goes around the sides of the building,
🎧 forcing those high level winds down to ground level.
🎧 That doesn't happen when you have trees.
🎧 Trees filter the wind and considerably reduce it.
🎧 preventing those very large strong gusts
🎧 that you so often find around tall buildings.
🎧 Another problem in built-up areas
🎧 is that traffic noise is intensified by tall buildings.
🎧 By planting a belt of trees at the side of the road,
🎧 you can make things a little quieter,
🎧 but much of the vehicle noise still goes through the trees.
🎧 Trees can also help reduce the amount of noise in the surroundings,
🎧 although the effect is not as large as people like to think.
🎧 Low- frequency noise, in particular, just goes through the trees as though they aren't there.
🎧 Although trees can significantly improve the local climate,
🎧 they do however take up a lot of space.
🎧 There are root systems to consider
🎧 and branches blocking windows and so on.
🎧 It may therefore be difficult to fit trees into the local landscape.
🎧 There is not a great deal you can do if you have what we call a street canyon -
🎧 a whole set of high-rises enclosed in a narrow street.
🎧 Trees need water to grow.
🎧 They also need some sunlight to grow
🎧 and you need room to put them.
🎧 If you have the chance of knocking buildings down and replacing them,
🎧 then suddenly you can start looking at different ways to design the streets and to introduce...
