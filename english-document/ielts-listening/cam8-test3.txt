[089] Cam8 - Test 3 - Part 1

🎧 Good morning. How can I help you?
🎧 Hello. I'm interested in renting a house somewhere in the town.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Could I have your name please?
🎧 Yes, it's Steven Godfrey.
🎧 And tell me how many bedrooms you're looking for.
🎧 Well, we'd need 4, because I'm going to share the house with 3 friends.
🎧 Okay, there are several of that size on our books.
🎧 They mostly belong to families who are working abroad at the moment.
🎧 What about the location?
🎧 It'd be nice to be central.
🎧 That might be difficult, as most houses of that size are in the suburbs.
🎧 Still, there are a few.
🎧 What's your upper limit for the rent?
🎧 We'd like something around £500 a month,
🎧 but we could go up to £600 if we have to.
🎧 But we can't go beyond that.
🎧 Do you know how long you want to rent the house for?
🎧 The minimum let is 6 months, as you probably realise.
🎧 We're at college here for two years,
🎧 and we don't want to have to move during that time if we can avoid it.
🎧 Right.
🎧 And how soon do you want to move in?
🎧 All our lets start on the first of the month.
🎧 Well, as soon as possible, really, so that means September 1st.
🎧 Okay, let me have a look at what we've got….
🎧 We have photographs of all the houses on our books, so you can get an idea of what they're like.
🎧 There's this one in Oakington Avenue, at £550 a month.
🎧 Combined living room and dining room, with a separate kitchen.
🎧 It doesn't have a garage, though you can park in the road.
🎧 Ah, we'd prefer to have one, if possible.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Then have a look at this house, in Mead Street.
🎧 It's got a very large living room and kitchen, bathroom, cloakroom...
🎧 How much is it?
🎧 That one's 580.
🎧 It's very well furnished and equipped.
🎧 It also has plenty of space for parking, and it's available for a minimum of a year.
🎧 Oh, and there's a big garden.
🎧 I don't think we could cope with that, to be honest.
🎧 We'll be too busy to look after it.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 Then there's this older house in Hamilton Road:
🎧 living room, kitchen-diner, and it has a study.
🎧 550 a month.
🎧 That looks rather nice.
🎧 But whereabouts in Hamilton Road?
🎧 Towards the western end.
🎧 Oh, that'll be very noisy. I know the area.
🎧 Yes, it's pretty lively.
🎧 Some people like it, though.
🎧 Well, what about this house in Devon Close?
🎧 That looks lovely.
🎧 There's a big demand for houses in that area, so prices tend to be quite high.
🎧 But this one hasn't been decorated for a few years, which has kept the rent down a bit.
🎧 It's got a living room, dining room and small kitchen,
🎧 and it's 595 a month.
🎧 I think it would suit you, from what you've said.
🎧 It sounds fine.
🎧 Why's that part of town so popular?
🎧 Well, there's a big scheme to improve the district, and it'll soon have the best facilities for miles around.
🎧 What sort of thing?
🎧 There's a big sports centre under construction, which will be very impressive when it's finished.
🎧 In fact, the swimming pool's already opened, ahead of schedule,
🎧 and it's attracting a lot of people.
🎧 What about cinemas: are there any in the area?
🎧 The only one closed down last year,
🎧 and it's now in the process of being converted into a film museum.
🎧 The local people are trying to get a new cinema added to the scheme.
🎧 I think I heard something about a plan to replace the existing concert hall with a larger one.
🎧 Ah, that's due to start next year.
🎧 Well, it sounds an interesting area to live in.
🎧 Could I go and see the house, please?
🎧 Yes, of course.

🎧 Hello, and welcome to "Focus on the Arts".
🎧 I'm your host - Dave Green -
🎧 and this is your very own local radio programme.
🎧 Every Friday evening we put the spotlight on different arts and culture facilities,
🎧 and look at the shows and events that are on offer in the coming week.
🎧 And today the focus is on The National Arts Centre.
🎧 Now, if you don't already know it yourself,
🎧 I'm sure you've all heard of it.
🎧 It's famous throughout the world as one of the major venues for classical music.
🎧 But did you know that it is actually much more than just a place to hear concerts?
🎧 The Centre itself is a huge complex that caters for a great range of arts.
🎧 Under a single roof it houses concert rooms, theatres, cinemas, art galleries
🎧 and a wonderful public library,
🎧 as well as service facilities including three restaurants and a bookshop.
🎧 So at any one time, the choice of entertainment there is simply enormous.
🎧 So, how did they manage to build such a big arts complex right in the heart of the city?
🎧 Well, the area was completely destroyed by bombs during the war in 1940.
🎧 So the opportunity was taken to create a cultural centre that would be...
🎧 what they called: 'The City's gift to the Nation'.
🎧 Of course, it took a while for such a big project to get started,
🎧 but it was planned in the 60s, built in the 70s
🎧 and eventually opened to the public in 1983.
🎧 Ever since then, it has proved to be a great success.
🎧 It is not privately owned, like many arts centres,
🎧 but is still in public hands - it's run by the City Council.
🎧 Both our National Symphony Orchestra and National Theater Company were involved in the planning of the project,
🎧 and they are now based there - giving regular performances every week -
🎧 and as the Centre is open 363 days of the year,
🎧 there are plenty of performances to choose from.
🎧 So, to give you some idea of what's on,
🎧 and to help you choose from the many possibilities,
🎧 we've made a selection of the star attractions.
🎧 If you're interested in classical music,
🎧 then we recommend you go along to the National on either Monday or Tuesday evening at 7.30
🎧 for a spectacular production of 'The Magic Flute' -
🎧 probably the most popular of all Mozart's operas.
🎧 It's in the Garden Hall and tickets start at only £8,
🎧 but you'll have to be early if you want to get them that cheap!
🎧 And remember, it's only on for those two evenings.
🎧 For those more interested in the cinema,
🎧 you might like to see the new Canadian film
🎧 which is showing on Wednesday evening at 8 pm in Cinema 2.
🎧 And that's called 'Three Lives'.
🎧 It's had fantastic reviews
🎧 and tickets cost just £4.50,
🎧 which is a reduction on the usual price of £5.50.
🎧 So, it's really good value, especially for such a great movie.
🎧 But you can see the centre's main attraction at the weekend,
🎧 because on Saturday and Sunday, 11 am to 10 pm,
🎧 they're showing a wonderful new exhibition that hasn't been seen anywhere else in Europe yet.
🎧 It's a collection of Chinese Art called 'Faces of China' - that's in Gallery 1 -
🎧 and it has some really fascinating paintings and sculptures by leading artists from all over China -
🎧 and the good news is that it's completely free, so don't miss it!
🎧 So why not go along to the National Art Centre next week for one - or all - of these great events -
🎧 and you can always pick up a programme
🎧 and check out all the other performances and exhibitions on offer, or coming soon,
🎧 on almost every day of the year.
🎧 Next week, we'll be looking at the new Museum of Science…

[091] Cam8 - Test 3 - Part 3

🎧 I've been reading your personal statement, Paul.
🎧 First, let's talk about your work experience in South America.
🎧 What took you there?
🎧 Was it to gain more fluency in Spanish?
🎧 Well, as I'm combining Spanish with Latin American studies,
🎧 my main idea was to find out more about the way people lived there.
🎧 My spoken Spanish was already pretty good in fact.
🎧 So you weren't too worried about language barriers?
🎧 No.
🎧 In fact, I ended up teaching English there,
🎧 although that wasn't my original choice of work.
🎧 I see.
🎧 How did you find out about all this?
🎧 I found an agency that runs all kinds of voluntary projects in South America.
🎧 What kind of work?
🎧 Well, there were several possibilities.
🎧 You mean construction? Engineering work?
🎧 Yes, getting involved in building projects was an option.
🎧 Then there was tourism - taking tourists for walks around the volcanoes -
🎧 which I actually chose to do,
🎧 and then there was work with local farmers.
🎧 But you didn't continue with that project. Why not?
🎧 Because I never really knew whether I'd be needed or not.
🎧 I'd thought it might be difficult physically, but I was certainly fit enough…
🎧 now, I wanted to do something that had more of a proper structure to it, I suppose,
🎧 I get demotivated otherwise.
🎧 What do you think you learned from your experience?
🎧 It must have been a great opportunity to examine community life.
🎧 Yes, but it was difficult at first to be accepted by the locals.
🎧 It was a very remote village
🎧 and some of them were reluctant to speak to me -
🎧 although they were always interested in my clothes and how much I'd had to pay for them.
🎧 Well, that's understandable.
🎧 Yes, but things soon improved.
🎧 What struck me was that when people became more comfortable with me and less suspicious,
🎧 we really connected with each other in a meaningful way.
🎧 You made good friends?
🎧 Yes, with two of the families in particular.
🎧 Good.
🎧 What about management.
🎧 Did you have a project manager?
🎧 Yes, and he gave me lots of advice and guidance.
🎧 And was he good at managing too?
🎧 That wasn't his strong point!
🎧 I think he was often more interested in the academic side of things than filling reports.
🎧 He was a bit of a dreamer.
🎧 And did you have a contract?
🎧 I had to stay for a minimum of three months.
🎧 My parents were surprised when I asked to stay longer - six months in the end.
🎧 I was so happy there.
🎧 And did anything on the administration side of things surprise you?
🎧 What was the food and lodging like?
🎧 Simple… but there was plenty to eat and I only paid $7 a day for that, which was amazing really.
🎧 And they gave me all the equipment I needed… even a laptop.
🎧 You didn't expect that then?
🎧 No.
🎧 Well, I'll look forward to hearing more.
🎧 But now let's look at these modules.
🎧 You'll need to start thinking about which ones you'll definitely want to study.
🎧 The first one here is Gender Studies in Latin America.
🎧 It looks at how gender analysis is reconfiguring civil society in Latin America.
🎧 Women are increasingly occupying positions in government
🎧 and in other elected leadership positions in Latin America.
🎧 I think you'd find it interesting.
🎧 If it was to do with people in the villages rather than those in the public sphere, I would.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 What about Second Language Acquisition?
🎧 Do you think I'd find that useful?
🎧 Well, you've had some practical experience in the field, I think it would be.
🎧 I hadn't thought about that.
🎧 I'll put that down as a definite, then.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 What about indigenous Women's Lives.
🎧 That sounds appropriate.
🎧 I thought so too, but I looked at last year's exam questions and that changed my mind.
🎧 Don't judge the value of the course on that.
🎧 Maybe talk to some other students first and we can talk about it again later.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 Yes, and lastly, will you sign up for Portuguese lessons?
🎧 My Spanish is good, so would I find that module easy?
🎧 Not necessarily.
🎧 Some people find that Spanish interferes with learning Portuguese…
🎧 getting the accent right too.
🎧 It's quite different in a lot of ways.
🎧 Well, I'd much sooner do something else, then.
🎧 Alright.
🎧 Now, what we need to do...

[092] Cam8 - Test 3 - Part 4

🎧 Good morning, everyone.
🎧 In the last few lectures, I've been dealing with business finance,
🎧 but now I'm going to move on to business systems.
🎧 And in today's lecture,
🎧 I'm going to talk about what can go wrong when businesses try to copy their own best practices.
🎧 Once a business has successfully introduced a new process -
🎧 managing a branch bank, say, or selling a new product -
🎧 the parent organisation naturally wants to repeat that success,
🎧 and capture it if possible on a bigger scale.
🎧 The goal, then, is to utilise existing knowledge
🎧 and not to generate new knowledge.
🎧 It's a less glamorous activity than pure innovation,
🎧 but it actually happens more often, as a matter of fact.
🎧 However, surprisingly,
🎧 getting things right the second time is not necessarily any simpler than it was the first time.
🎧 Now, there's been a lot of research into how companies can repeat their previous successes,
🎧 and it certainly hasn't been confined to the United States.
🎧 It seems that most large industries are trying to repeat their own successes,
🎧 and manage the knowledge they've acquired -
🎧 but even so, it has been shown that the overwhelming majority of attempts fail.
🎧 A host of studies confirm this,
🎧 covering a wide range of business settings:
🎧 branch banks, retail stores, real estate agencies,
🎧 factories, call centres... to name but a few.
🎧 So why do so few managers get things right the second or third time?
🎧 Let's consider one reason for failure -
🎧 placing too much trust in the people who are running the successful operation,
🎧 the 'experts' shall we say.
🎧 Managers who want to apply existing knowledge typically start off by going to an expert -
🎧 such as the person who designed and is running a successful department store -
🎧 and picking their brains.
🎧 Now, this approach can be used if you want to gain a rough understanding of a particular system,
🎧 or understand smaller, isolated problems.
🎧 The trouble is, even the expert doesn't fully grasp the whole thing
🎧 because when it comes to complex systems,
🎧 the individual components of the process are interwoven with one another.
🎧 The expert never has complete access to the necessary information.
🎧 And the situation's complicated even further
🎧 by the fact that experts are usually not aware of their own ignorance.
🎧 The ignorance can take various forms.
🎧 For instance, a lot of details of the system are invisible to managers.
🎧 Some may be difficult to describe -
🎧 learned on the job and well known by workers perhaps,
🎧 but impossible to describe in a way that's helpful.
🎧 And there are some things that people know or do that they're not even aware of.
🎧 Now, let's consider two types of mistake
🎧 that can occur when a manager actually starts to set up a duplicate system to replicate a successful process.
🎧 Firstly, perhaps he forgets that he was just trying to copy another process,
🎧 and starts trying to improve on it.
🎧 Another mistake is trying to use the best parts of various different systems,
🎧 in the hope of creating the perfect combination.
🎧 Unfortunately, attempts like these usually turn out to be misguided and lead to problems.
🎧 Why?
🎧 Well, for various reasons.
🎧 Perhaps there weren't really any advantages after all,
🎧 because the information wasn't accurate.
🎧 Or perhaps the business settings weren't really comparable.
🎧 More typically, the advantages are real enough,
🎧 but there are also disadvantages that have been overlooked.
🎧 For example, the modifications might compromise safety in some way.
🎧 So, what's the solution?
🎧 Well, I don't intend to suggest that it's easy to get things right the second time...
🎧 it's not.
🎧 But the underlying problem has more to do with attitudes than the actual difficulty of the task,
🎧 and there are ways of getting it right.
🎧 These involve adjusting attitudes, first of all...
🎧 being more realistic and cautious really.
🎧 Secondly, they involve exerting strict controls on the organisational and operational systems.
🎧 And this, in turn, means copying the original as closely as possible.
🎧 Not merely duplicating the physical characteristics of the factory,
🎧 but also duplicating the skills that the original employees had.
🎧 Reliance on a template like this offers the huge advantage of built-in consistency.
