[005] Cam3 - Test 2 - Part 1

🎧 Sorry to keep you waiting.
🎧 Well, firstly, let me give you this booklet.
🎧 It tells you a bit more about the school,
🎧 the courses and the social activities we offer.
🎧 Now, on the first page,
🎧 there's an outline of this morning's activities.
🎧 There, you see?
🎧 The programme starts at 10 o'clock.
🎧 Try not to be late as it's a very full day.
🎧 At 10 o'clock, all the new students will gather in the Main Hall
🎧 to meet the Principal and the rest of the staff.
🎧 In fact, you spend most of the morning in the Main Hall.
🎧 Where's that?
🎧 I'll show you in a minute.
🎧 Just let me quickly run through this morning's events first
🎧 and then I'll explain how to get there.
🎧 Yes, okay.
🎧 Right. Where were we?
🎧 Yes, so, the Principal's talk will last about 15 minutes
🎧 and then the Director of Studies will talk to you for half an hour about the courses
🎧 and the different requirements for each.
🎧 After that, the Student Adviser will tell you about the various services and activities we offer to students.
🎧 Any questions?
🎧 So, all of this is in the Main Hall?
🎧 That's right.
🎧 And then you'll go next door to Classroom 5 at 11 o'clock.
🎧 What happens there?
🎧 You'll have a test.
🎧 Test?
🎧 I don't like the sound of that.
🎧 What sort of test?
🎧 Oh, it's nothing to worry about.
🎧 It's just a placement test to help us find your level of English
🎧 so that we can put you in the right class.
🎧 It won't last long.
🎧 But how do I find the Main Hall?
🎧 Right; if you look on the back of the booklet I gave you,
🎧 you'll see a map of the school.
🎧 Let me show you.
🎧 Look; you came in through the Main Entrance, here,
🎧 and now we're here at Reception.
🎧 Now, to get to the Main Hall,
🎧 you walk on to the end of this corridor in front of you
🎧 and then you turn left.
🎧 Walk along past the Language Laboratory
🎧 and then past the Library,
🎧 which is next to the Language Lab, on the same side,
🎧 and facing you is the Main Hall, at the end of the corridor.
🎧 You can't miss it.
🎧 So it's next to the Library, in fact.
🎧 Yes, that's right.
🎧 I should be able to find that.
🎧 And do you have a Computer Laboratory?
🎧 Yes, we do.
🎧 Could you tell me where that is?
🎧 Certainly, yes.
🎧 You go down to the end of this corridor again
🎧 but, this time, don't turn left;
🎧 turn right, away from the Main Hall.
🎧 The Computer Lab. is immediately on your right. Okay?
🎧 And where's the staff room, in case I need to find a teacher at some stage?
🎧 The staff room is near the main entrance,
🎧 on the left over there, just opposite the Reception desk.
🎧 In a day or two, I'm sure you'll find your way around very easily.
🎧 Oh, one last thing.
🎧 Is there a student common room?
🎧 Oh yes, I forgot to mention that.
🎧 It's this area here,
🎧 very close to where we are now,
🎧 to the right of the Reception desk as you come in the main entrance.
🎧 There's tea and coffee facilities there.
🎧 Great.
🎧 Thank you very much.
🎧 You're welcome.

🎧 Hello everybody and welcome to this informal meeting about the University Helpline.
🎧 The Helpline was set up ten years ago by the Students Union
🎧 and it aims to provide new students to the university
🎧 with a service that they can use if they need information
🎧 about practical areas of student life that they are unfamiliar with.
🎧 Let me give you some examples of the type of help we can offer.
🎧 We can provide information on financial matters;
🎧 for example, you may feel that your grant is insufficient to see you through college life
🎧 or you may have some queries regarding the fees you are paying
🎧 if you are an overseas student.
🎧 In both cases, the Helpline would be able to go through things with you
🎧 and see what the outcome might be.
🎧 Another area we can help with is what we generally term the 'domestic' area;
🎧 things such as childcare and the availability of nursery provision, for example, come under this.
🎧 Then there's 'academic' issues that may arise while you are in the early stages of your course
🎧 that you may not know what to do about.
🎧 You may wish to know more about essay deadlines, for example,
🎧 or how to use the library -
🎧 there are all kinds of questions you will find yourself asking
🎧 and not knowing where to get quick answers from.
🎧 The Helpline would be able to provide these.
🎧 The last example I've given here is simply termed 'social' -
🎧 and yes, there is a lot of social life here!
🎧 But you may have a particular interest you wish to pursue
🎧 or you may wish to participate in outings or trips
🎧 if you don't know many people at the moment.
🎧 Let me give you some details
🎧 so that you know where to go and who to see if you want to pay us a visit.
🎧 Generally you will see our Helpline officer Jackie Kouachi,
🎧 that's KOUACHI.
🎧 Jackie is a full-time employee of the Student Union
🎧 and she works in the Student Welfare Office -
🎧 that's the office that deals with all matters related to student welfare
🎧 and it's located at 13 Marshall Road.
🎧 I have some maps here for those of you who haven't been there yet.
🎧 If you wish to ring the office,
🎧 the number is 3269940.
🎧 That's 3269940.
🎧 The office is open between 9.30 and 6 o'clock on weekdays
🎧 and from 10 to 4 on Saturdays
🎧 and there'll be somebody there usually Jackie or myself - between those times.
🎧 If you want to make an appointment, you can phone or call at the office in person.
🎧 Please note that it may not be possible for anyone to see you straight away -
🎧 particularly if it is a busy time - lunch time for example -
🎧 and you may have to go on the waiting list and then come back later.
🎧 Well, enough from me.
🎧 Any questions?

[007] Cam3 - Test 2 - Part 3

🎧 Good morning.
🎧 So, we've looked at various aspects of staff selection this term and...
🎧 I think by now you should be beginning to see
🎧 how much more there is to it than just putting applicants through a short interview
🎧 or asking the 'right' questions.
🎧 So I think you should be ready for today's tutorial on 'matching the person to the job'.
🎧 We're going to talk today about the importance of choosing that all round 'right' person.
🎧 Right. So we have to put ourselves into the role of the manager or supervisor?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 And then we're going to imagine how different applicants would fit into the team or group they have to work with...
🎧 we'll look at some examples later.
🎧 It's just theoretical at the moment...
🎧 Yes.
🎧 The point is, you can select someone - even a friend -
🎧 who has all the right qualifications, degrees, certificates, whatever.
🎧 You can also check that they have a lot of experience...
🎧 that they've done the sort of tasks that you want them to do in your office already,
🎧 in a similar environment.
🎧 But if they start work
🎧 and you realise that they just don't get along with everybody else, that...
🎧 say, they've got sharply contrasting views on how something will work...
🎧 well, with the best will in the world, you may be backing a loser.
🎧 Wouldn't it be just a question of company training, though?
🎧 Not always.
🎧 Particularly in a team situation,
🎧 and I think it's important to think in terms of that type of working environment.
🎧 People have to have faith in each other's ability to carry out the task their boss has set them.
🎧 They have to trust that everyone will do their part of the job,
🎧 and you can't necessarily train people for this.
🎧 But it's like trying to find out what someone's personality is like in a job interview...
🎧 I mean... you just can't do that.
🎧 Even if you try, you won't find out what they're really like until they actually start work.
🎧 Well, in most interviews you usually ask candidates questions about their hobbies and...
🎧 what they like doing in their spare time...
🎧 that sort of thing...
🎧 so, employers are already involved in the practice of...
🎧 well, doing part of the task.
🎧 But it doesn't tell you anything.
🎧 It doesn't tell you if they're easy-going or hate smokers or whatever.
🎧 Well, arguably it does give you a bit of information about an applicant's character,
🎧 but also more and more employers around the world are making use of what are called 'personality questionnaires'
🎧 to help them select new staff and...
🎧 What's it called?
🎧 A Personality Questionnaire.
🎧 They have to be filled out by the candidates some time during the selection procedure,
🎧 often just before an interview.
🎧 The idea is actually quite old.
🎧 Apparently they were used by the ancient Chinese for picking out clerks and civil servants,
🎧 and then later they were used by the military to put people in appropriate areas of work.
🎧 They've gained a lot of ground since then
🎧 and there are about 80,000 different tests available now
🎧 and almost two thirds of the large employers use them.
🎧 Which makes you think that there must be something in them.
🎧 That's right.
🎧 They ask the sort of questions that you might expect,
🎧 like do you like working under pressure or...
🎧 are you good at keeping deadlines.
🎧 And what if people can see through them and just write what they think the employer wants to see?
🎧 Well that's always a possibility.
🎧 I mean, it's human nature to lie, isn't it?
🎧 Well, that's the point.
🎧 Apparently it isn't.
🎧 These tests are compiled by experts
🎧 and they believe that the answers can provide a few simple indicators
🎧 as to roughly the type of person that you are...
🎧 that people will generally be truthful in that situation.
🎧 And then you can go some way towards finding out whether someone's, say, forward-looking...
🎧 a go-ahead type of person... or resistant to change.
🎧 And there are all kinds of...

[008] Cam3 - Test 2 - Part 4

🎧 Right. Are we all here?
🎧 Okay.
🎧 As you know, today Vivien is going to do a presentation on the hat-making project
🎧 she did with her class during her last teaching practice. So...
🎧 Over to you, Vivien.
🎧 Thanks.
🎧 Mr Yardley has asked me to describe to you
🎧 the project I did as a student teacher at a secondary school in London.
🎧 I was at this school for six weeks
🎧 and I taught a variety of subjects to a class of 14 year old pupils.
🎧 The project I chose to do was a hat-making project
🎧 and I think this project could easily be adapted to suit any age.
🎧 So, to explain the project...
🎧 After we'd done the research,
🎧 we went back to the classroom to make two basic hat shapes using rolls of old wallpaper.
🎧 We each made, first of all, a conical hat by...
🎧 well, if I show you now...
🎧 cutting out a circle and then making one cut up to the centre
🎧 and then... er... overlapping the cut like this...
🎧 a conical hat that sits on your head.
🎧 The other hat we made was a little more complicated.
🎧 First of all, we cut out a circle again...
🎧 like this...
🎧 then you need a long piece with flaps on it.
🎧 I've already made that bit which I have here.
🎧 you bend the flaps over and stick them with glue or prittstick
🎧 to the underside of the circle... like this.
🎧 Again, I've prepared this so that I don't get glue everywhere.
🎧 The pupils do, of course, so you need plenty of covers for the table.
🎧 And there you have a pillbox hat as in pill and box.
🎧 Now variations and combinations of these two hat shapes formed the basis of the pupils' final designs.
🎧 The next stage of the project was the design phase
🎧 and this involved, first of all, using their pages of research to draw a design of their hat on paper.
🎧 That's the easy part.
🎧 They then had to translate their two-dimensional design into a form to fit their head.
🎧 I encouraged them to make a small-scale, three dimensional hat first
🎧 so that they could experiment with how to achieve the form they required
🎧 and I imposed certain constraints on them to keep things simple.
🎧 For example, they had to use paper not card.
🎧 Paper is more pliable and easier to handle.
🎧 They also had to limit their colours to white, grey or brown shades of paper
🎧 which reflected the colours of the buildings they were using as a model for their hats
🎧 and they had to make sure their glue didn't show!
🎧 Well, it was very enjoyable
🎧 and just to give you an idea of what they produced,
🎧 I've brought along three hats to show you.
🎧 This one here is based on a circular stairway in an old building in London.
🎧 It uses three pillbox hats, one on top of the other.
🎧 This was designed by Theresa.
🎧 Here's another one that has a simple strip going round the base of the hat
🎧 but has then gone on to add strips of paper that come out from the base
🎧 and that meet at the top of the hat - rather like a crown -
🎧 making a fairly tall hat.
🎧 This was made by Muriel.
🎧 And lastly, there's a combination of the pillbox or single strip around the base
🎧 and then the conical hat shape on top to form a castle turret.
🎧 This was made by Fabrice,
🎧 and there are many more that I could have brought.
🎧 Thank you, Vivien.
🎧 That was most interesting.
🎧 Now what we can learn from this...
