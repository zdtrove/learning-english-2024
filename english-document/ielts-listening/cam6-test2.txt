[053] Cam6 - Test 2 - Part 1

🎧 Good morning, Synmouth Museum. Can I help you?
🎧 Oh yes. Good morning.
🎧 I'm interested in the children's workshops and I'd like a little more information, please.
🎧 Do you mean the Art and Craft workshops?
🎧 Yes. A friend of a friend mentioned them -
🎧 the children do painting and make models and so forth.
🎧 Yes, of course.
🎧 Um, where to begin?
🎧 First of all, as you probably know, they run every Saturday.
🎧 Fine. And what about ages?
🎧 Well, all ages from five upwards are welcome,
🎧 though we do ask that children below eight years of age are accompanied by an adult.
🎧 Fine. That wouldn't be a problem.
🎧 What about cost?
🎧 Well, I think you'll find them very reasonable.
🎧 It's £2.50 a child,
🎧 with 80 pence off for two or more children from the same family.
🎧 Oh yes, very reasonable.
🎧 And are they held in the main museum?
🎧 Not exactly.
🎧 They're nearby.
🎧 Could you give me the full address?
🎧 I don't know the area very well.
🎧 Yes, it's Winter House.
🎧 Right.
🎧 And that's in Tamer Street.
🎧 Could you spell that please?
🎧 Yes, TAMER Street.
🎧 Lovely.
🎧 And I do need to tell you that there's a security entrance,
🎧 so you need to press the green button for someone to let you in.
🎧 Don't press the red button please,
🎧 but don't worry, it's all clearly labelled.
🎧 Okay. And one more question -
🎧 is parking available nearby?
🎧 We're driving in from out of town.
🎧 Your best bet is to leave your car at the back of the library -
🎧 on a Saturday morning, there are plenty of spaces there.
🎧 It's right next door to the museum.
🎧 And can I ask about booking places?
🎧 Yes, and I must tell you, you really should book by calling the education department here.
🎧 Oh, I'm sorry, should I have rung them instead of the main museum number?
🎧 No, that's fine this time, please don't worry.
🎧 But for future reference, I'll give you the direct number.
🎧 It's 200765.
🎧 Great, I've got that.
🎧 But I'm very happy to give you information about the next two workshops.
🎧 On Saturday the 16th, there's Building Castles.
🎧 Oh, sounds great!
🎧 This involves quite a bit of glue, so just make sure the kids are in old clothes.
🎧 I know, ones I don't mind getting mucky.
🎧 Exactly.
🎧 And if possible, could you bring along bottle tops
🎧 which the children might be able to use in the models, you know, as decoration?
🎧 We'll certainly try to find some for you.
🎧 Then the following week...
🎧 That'll be the 23rd, won't it?
🎧 Yes, that's right.
🎧 On that day, it's what we call Undersea Worlds.
🎧 This is where they make scenes with fishes, underground caverns and so on.
🎧 Is that likely to get very dirty?
🎧 Lots of paint splashes?
🎧 Not really, so we don't recommend any special clothes for that one.
🎧 But if you could search out some silver paper to bring along to use in the sessions,
🎧 you know, it's shiny - it looks like water, that'd be great.
🎧 Yes, of course. We'll see what we can come up with.
🎧 Well, thank you ever so much for all your help.
🎧 The sessions sound really good and I'll certainly book up for the next two.
🎧 Lovely.
🎧 Thanks very much for ringing.
🎧 Bye.
🎧 Bye-bye.

[054] Cam6 - Test 2 - Part 2

🎧 Hello.
🎧 Um... my family and I are staying here in Trebirch for a week or two
🎧 and we wanted to know about the train services.
🎧 We're hoping to do a few local trips.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 Well, I can give you lots of details about all the trains going from Trebirch in the South West.
🎧 This leaflet will be very helpful
🎧 but I can tell you some of the main things.
🎧 We've got two main train stations in the town.
🎧 King Street is for local commuter lines and regional services.
🎧 What about trains to London?
🎧 I'll need to go there on business for one day.
🎧 Then you need to go to Central Station -
🎧 that's for all the national services.
🎧 There are regular trains to London.
🎧 They leave Trebirch every half hour on weekdays and every hour at weekends.
🎧 It takes about two hours, a bit longer on Sundays.
🎧 You've got a choice of first and second class and there's a buffet car -
🎧 though refreshments are included in the cost of a first class ticket.
🎧 Ah, right.
🎧 Um, and have you got any information on different ticket types?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 There's a range of ticket prices depending on when you travel and when you buy your ticket.
🎧 There's a standard open ticket which doesn't have any restrictions.
🎧 This can be bought in advance or on the day.
🎧 You can also get various discounted tickets.
🎧 A popular one is called the Supersave
🎧 and, er, this is OK for travel after 8.45.
🎧 Then there is the Special ticket,
🎧 which is valid for travel after 10:15.
🎧 The Special tickets are also valid for travel at weekends.
🎧 The cheapest tickets are called Advance
🎧 and you have to buy them at least six days ahead.
🎧 Only a certain number are available
🎧 and you have to make seat reservations for these.
🎧 Thanks. And are there lots of places to go to around here?
🎧 Oh yes.
🎧 You can enjoy many days out.
🎧 Um there's the Merthyr Mining Museum,
🎧 which is only half an hour from Trebirch by train.
🎧 Your children will find it just as fascinating as any theme park
🎧 and they can ride in the original miners' lifts and on the coal trains.
🎧 There are special excursion tickets which include entrance fees.
🎧 Mainline trains also offer direct services to Bristol,
🎧 where you can visit the docks or spend a great day out with the children in the zoo,
🎧 which is set in the parkland that used to surround the old castle.
🎧 Er, special family awayday fares are available for this service now during the school holidays.
🎧 Er, alternatively, you can be in Birmingham in only an hour and a half,
🎧 where there's lots to see and do including the new and internationally-acclaimed climbing wall
🎧 built on the site of the old aquarium.
🎧 We will also be running a special service to Newport
🎧 when the new science museum opens next year,
🎧 as we anticipate a lot of visitors in the opening weeks.
🎧 I'd advise you to call early to book your tickets.
🎧 Is that OK?
🎧 Yes, thanks.

[055] Cam6 - Test 2 - Part 3

🎧 Hello, Sandy.
🎧 How have you been getting on with your dissertation?
🎧 Fine, and I've been working hard on the various action points we agreed on our last tutorial.
🎧 Do you want to talk me through what you've done?
🎧 Yeah, sure.
🎧 Well, we agreed on three main targets for me to aim for.
🎧 The first one was to find out about suitable data analysis software.
🎧 Yes.
🎧 And what I decided to do was to look through catalogues specialising in IT.
🎧 That's a good idea.
🎧 What did you come up with?
🎧 I found the names of two promising ones.
🎧 Right.
🎧 But I also thought it'd be worthwhile talking to a lecturer.
🎧 Oh right.
🎧 Who did you see?
🎧 Jane Prince. Do you know her?
🎧 She's in the Computer Centre.
🎧 Yes, of course, she's the new Head.
🎧 Yes. Well, she was very helpful.
🎧 Oh, that's good.
🎧 Did she suggest anything in particular?
🎧 Yeah. She recommended software called Vivat
🎧 and said I should book up for a couple of practice sessions using Vivat.
🎧 Great. I'm sure you'll find them useful.
🎧 And, of course, the second target was to draw up a survey checklist...
🎧 Yes, you emailed me it last week.
🎧 Have you had a chance to look...?
🎧 Of course,
🎧 um, I think it's good.
🎧 Very much on the right lines.
🎧 I'd say your first two sections are spot on.
🎧 I wouldn't suggest that you change anything there, but...
🎧 in section three you really do need to have questions on teaching experience.
🎧 Yeah. I was thinking that section looked a bit short.
🎧 Right.
🎧 And my third target was, do further reading on discipline.
🎧 Oh yes. I mentioned a couple of writers, didn't I?
🎧 Yes, well, I got hold of the Banerjee and I thought that was excellent.
🎧 But I'm afraid I didn't manage to get hold of the essays about classroom management,
🎧 you know, the ones by Simon Ericsson.
🎧 The bookshop said it was out of print and the library doesn't have a copy.
🎧 Oh right, and I'm afraid I've lent my copy to another student.
🎧 What I suggest you do is try the library again -
🎧 this time apply for it through the service called special loans.
🎧 Have you done that before?
🎧 You're entitled to six books a year.
🎧 Yes.
🎧 No problem. That's what I'll do.
🎧 So, lots of useful work done.
🎧 So, let's look at some new targets.
🎧 We'll start by having a chat about your Chapter One.
🎧 I very much enjoyed reading it.
🎧 Your written style is very clear
🎧 and you've included lots of interesting descriptions of education in your target area.
🎧 I've just got a couple of suggestions for some additional work.
🎧 Of course.
🎧 Could I just ask - what do you think I should call it?
🎧 Well, I'd go for something like Context Review.
🎧 What do you think?
🎧 Well, short and to the point.
🎧 Exactly.
🎧 Now, as regards specific areas to work on,
🎧 I'd be quite interested to have a few more statistics about the schools in the different zones.
🎧 Oh, that wouldn't be a problem. I can get them from the Internet.
🎧 Great,
🎧 and although you did make a reference to quite a few different writers,
🎧 I think you should aim to cite more works written later than 2000.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 That's more difficult, but I can try.
🎧 When do you want that done by?
🎧 Oh, it's not urgent.
🎧 Um, I should aim for the end of term.
🎧 But in the meantime, I think you should also be thinking about Chapter Two.
🎧 Should I be drafting it already?
🎧 No, but I think you should note down its main sections.
🎧 Yes.
🎧 You know, I always find that the hardest part.
🎧 I always find it helpful to put some ideas on index cards.
🎧 Um... and then you can sort them, and even lay them out on the floor.
🎧 It's a real help.
🎧 Well, I'll certainly try it!
🎧 When would the deadline be for that?
🎧 My advice would be to get it done before you embark upon the research.
🎧 You can always change it later if you need to.
🎧 Okay. I'll get going on that...

[056] Cam6 - Test 2 - Part 4

🎧 Many believe that the story first began in America in 1877,
🎧 when two friends were arguing over whether a horse ever had all four feet or hooves off the ground when it galloped.
🎧 To settle the bet, a photographer was asked to photograph a horse galloping
🎧 and the bet was settled because you could see that all the hooves were off the ground in some of the photos.
🎧 What was even more interesting was that if the photos were shown in quick succession
🎧 the horse looked like it was running -
🎧 in other words 'moving pictures'.
🎧 The person who became interested in taking the moving pictures to its next step
🎧 was the famous American inventor Thomas Edison.
🎧 Actually, he didn't do the work himself but rather asked a young Scotsman in his employ to design a system,
🎧 which he did.
🎧 Now this young fellow was clever
🎧 because the first thing he did was study other systems -
🎧 primitive as they were of moving pictures
🎧 and then put all the existing technologies together to make the first entire motion picture system.
🎧 He designed a camera, a projection device and the film.
🎧 The system was first shown in New York in 1894 and was really very popular.
🎧 Apparently, people lined up around the block to see the wonderful new invention.
🎧 There were, however, a couple of problems with the system.
🎧 The camera weighed over 200 kilograms
🎧 and only one person at a time could see the film.
🎧 Well now, news of the new system in America travelled fast
🎧 and a number of rival European systems started to appear once people had heard about it.
🎧 The single problem with all the systems was they couldn't really project the film onto a screen -
🎧 you know, so more than one person could see it.
🎧 Then in 1895;
🎧 three systems were all developed,
🎧 more or less at the same time and independently of each other.
🎧 I guess the most famous of these was by the Lumiere Brothers from France,
🎧 and they called their system the cinematographe
🎧 which of course is where the word cinema comes from.
🎧 There were also two brothers in Germany who developed a successful system and they called it a bioskop.
🎧 Well now, once the problem of projection had been solved,
🎧 the next challenge for the inventors was to make the films longer and more interesting.
🎧 A continuing problem at the time was that the films had a tendency to break when they were being played -
🎧 a problem which was caused by the tension between the two wheels,
🎧 or 'reels' as they are called, which hold the film.
🎧 Now this problem was solved by two American brothers.
🎧 They developed the 'Lantham Loop',
🎧 which was the simple addition of a third reel between the two main reels,
🎧 and this took all the tension away with the result that the film stopped snapping.
🎧 So now there was a real possibility of having films of more than two or three minutes,
🎧 and this led to the making of The Great Train Robbery - the very first movie made.
🎧 It only lasted 11 minutes but was an absolute sensation,
🎧 and there were cases of people watching the movie and actually fainting when the character fired a gun at the camera!
🎧 Almost overnight movies became a craze,
🎧 and by 1905, people in America were lining up to see movies in 'store theatres', as they were called then.
🎧 I guess the next big step in terms of development of technology
🎧 was to have people actually talking on the film,
🎧 and the first step towards this was in 1926
🎧 when sound effects were first used on a film.
🎧 It wasn't until the following year however that the first 'talkie', as they were called then, was made.
🎧 This film featured actors speaking only during parts of the film
🎧 and was called The Jazz Singer,
🎧 and it wasn't until 1928 that the first all-talking film was produced,
🎧 and this was called The Lights of New York.
🎧 Unfortunately, the sound on this early film was not very good
🎧 and I believe they put subtitles on the film -
🎧 that is, they printed the dialogue along the bottom of the film
🎧 to compensate for this poor sound quality.
🎧 Now, with the addition of sound,
🎧 moving pictures became far more difficult...
