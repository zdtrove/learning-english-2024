[078] Cam7 - Test 4 - Part 2

🎧 Welcome to all of you.
🎧 Can everybody see and hear me?
🎧 Good. I'm Sally, your guide for this tour of the Bicentennial Park.
🎧 I hope that you're all wearing your most comfortable shoes and that you can keep up the pace.
🎧 So let's get under way on our tour around this wonderful park.
🎧 I'll start today with some general background information.
🎧 There used to be a lot of factories in this area until the 1960s.
🎧 Creating the park required the demolition of lots of derelict buildings on the site,
🎧 so most of the exciting park space all around you was originally warehouses and storehouses.
🎧 The idea of building a public park here
🎧 was first discussed when a property developer proposed a high-rise housing development,
🎧 but the local community wasn't happy.
🎧 If the land was to be cleaned up,
🎧 they wanted to use the site for recreation.
🎧 Residents wanted open space for outdoor activities,
🎧 rather than housing or even an indoor sports complex.
🎧 Now, to the Bicentennial Park itself.
🎧 It has two areas,
🎧 a nature reserve and a formal park with man-made features and gardens.
🎧 The tall blue-and-white building in front of us is called The Tower
🎧 and is the centre point for the formal gardens.
🎧 It stands twelve metres high,
🎧 so, follow me up the stairs to where we can take advantage of the fantastic views.
🎧 Well, here we are at the top of The Tower,
🎧 and we're going to look at the view from each direction.
🎧 Out to the east, the large buildings about a kilometre away are on the Olympic site.
🎧 There's an indoor arena for gymnastics,
🎧 a stadium for track and field
🎧 and a swimming pool for races and synchronised swimming and also diving.
🎧 If you look carefully down there,
🎧 you can see the train lines.
🎧 The Olympic site has its own station to encourage the use of public transport.
🎧 There is also a car park, but it only holds a limited number of cars.
🎧 The formal park has some specially-created water features.
🎧 If you look out here to the south, you can see a circular ornamental pond.
🎧 And around to the west,
🎧 you can relax and sit on a bench to smell the flowers in the rose garden,
🎧 and finally up to the north, if you look in front of you now,
🎧 there's a lake with a small island in the centre,
🎧 you can hire rowing boats at the boat shed, which you can't see from here,
🎧 but if you look through the trees, you can see the café,
🎧 which has lovely views across the water.
🎧 Okay, let's climb down now.
🎧 We will go now and have a look at the nature reserve section of the park,
🎧 which has opened up natural wetland to the public.
🎧 The Mangroves have been made more accessible to visitors by the boardwalk built during the park's upgrade.
🎧 You'd think that people would come here to look at the unusual plant life of the area,
🎧 but in fact, it's more often used for cycling and is very popular with the local clubs.
🎧 This is the far end of the park
🎧 and over there you can see the Frog Pond,
🎧 a natural feature here long before the park was designed.
🎧 Just next to it we have our outdoor classroom,
🎧 a favourite spot for school parties.
🎧 The area is now most often used by primary schools for biology lessons.
🎧 And finally let's pass by the Waterbird Refuge.
🎧 This area is in a sheltered part of the estuary,
🎧 that's why the park's viewing shelter is a favourite spot for bird watchers who can use it to spy through binoculars.
🎧 You can watch a variety of water birds,
🎧 but most visitors expect to see black swans when they come to the shelter.
🎧 You might spot one yourself right now!
🎧 Well, here we are back at our starting point...

[079] Cam7 - Test 4 - Part 3

🎧 Remind me, Trevor, how long is the presentation?
🎧 Dr White said three per hour.
🎧 So about twenty minutes?
🎧 Well… it'll be fifteen minutes per presentation.
🎧 And five minutes for questions.
🎧 And is this one going to be assessed?
🎧 No, not this time round
🎧 because it's the first one… you know.
🎧 Oh, good news.
🎧 Well, Trevor, what are we going to include?
🎧 Well, do you think we ought to give some historical background?
🎧 Oh no, definitely not, we won't have time!
🎧 OK…
🎧 but I think we ought to say something about the geographical location
🎧 cos not a lot of people know where the islands are.
🎧 Yes, okay…
🎧 I'll take notes, shall I?
🎧 Yeah, that'll be a help.
🎧 So, geographical location…
🎧 Then we ought to give an overview of the whole education system.
🎧 Shouldn't we say something about the economy,
🎧 you know agricultural produce, minerals and so forth?
🎧 Well, Dr White said we shouldn't go into that sort of detail.
🎧 But it's pretty important when you think about it,
🎧 you know, because it does influence the education system.
🎧 Look, let's think about that one later shall we?
🎧 Let's see how we're doing for time.
🎧 Okay, so… general overview of education.
🎧 Of course… and then the role of English language.
🎧 Hmm... Nope, that goes in the Language Policy Seminar, don't you remember?
🎧 Are you sure?
🎧 Positive.
🎧 Alright.
🎧 so those are the topics we're going to be… to be covering.
🎧 We need to think about what to prepare…
🎧 Dr White said he wanted us to use plenty of visuals and things and...
🎧 we might as well try them out when we're not being assessed.
🎧 Well, the most important thing is the overhead projector.
🎧 No problem, we'll get that from the media room.
🎧 Must remember to book it.
🎧 Well… we'll need a map of course.
🎧 Probably two… one of the islands… large scale.
🎧 And one of West Africa.
🎧 Well, the West African one is no problem.
🎧 There's one in the Resources Room.
🎧 Oh yeah, of course, the resources room;
🎧 the islands are going to be more of a problem.
🎧 Tell you what, there's a very clear map of Santiago in that tourist brochure I showed you last week.
🎧 Don't you remember it?
🎧 Oh yeah, that's right;
🎧 we can just use the tourist brochure.
🎧 We also need statistics on several different things.
🎧 Literacy rates.
🎧 Yes, and school places.
🎧 How about the encyclopedia?
🎧 Nah… not up-to-date enough!
🎧 Mmm… why don't we call the embassy?
🎧 Oh… someone's enthusiastic!
🎧 Well… if something's worth doing…
🎧 I know… it's worth doing well… okay.
🎧 We can find out statistics on school places from them as well.
🎧 Might as well.
🎧 Look, Julie, it's almost time for our tutorials.
🎧 We can meet again on Monday
🎧 but we need to prepare...

[080] Cam7 - Test 4 - Part 4

🎧 In today's lecture, I'm going to talk about Monosodium Glutamate,
🎧 or MSG, as it's more commonly known.
🎧 Now, MSG as you probably know, is a flavour enhancer
🎧 which is used particularly in Chinese and Japanese cooking.
🎧 Today, I am going to explore why it is so popular in these cuisines
🎧 and, more importantly, how does it enhance the flavour of food?
🎧 The main reason why MSG is more commonly used in Japanese meals is tradition.
🎧 For many thousands of years,
🎧 the Japanese have incorporated a type of seaweed known as kombu in their cooking,
🎧 as they discovered it had the ability to make food taste better.
🎧 But it wasn't until 1908
🎧 that the ingredient in kombu, which was responsible for the improvement in flavour,
🎧 was actually discovered to be glutamate by scientists working there.
🎧 From 1908 until 1956,
🎧 glutamate was produced commercially in Japan
🎧 by a very slow and expensive means of extraction.
🎧 It was in 1956 that the speed of the process was improved,
🎧 and industrial production increased dramatically
🎧 and still continues to increase to this day.
🎧 In fact, hundreds of thousands of tonnes of MSG are produced all over the world today.
🎧 So what exactly is MSG?
🎧 Well, Monosodium Glutamate contains 78.2% glutamate,
🎧 12.2% sodium
🎧 and 9.6% water.
🎧 Glutamate is an amino acid that can be found naturally in all protein-containing foods,
🎧 erm, so this includes food such as meat and cheese.
🎧 It is widely known that Chinese and Japanese food contains MSG
🎧 but many people don't seem to be aware that it is also used in foods in other parts of the world.
🎧 For example, it is found in commercially made Italian pizzas,
🎧 in American fast food and in Britain, MSG is used in things like potato crisps.
🎧 So, how exactly does MSG work?
🎧 Well, in the Western world, we commonly talk of four 'tastes',
🎧 and I'm sure you're all familiar with the concepts of sweet, sour, bitter and salt.
🎧 Well, in 1908, Kikunae Ikeda identified a fifth 'taste'.
🎧 And it is thought that MSG intensifies this naturally occurring 'taste' in some food.
🎧 It does make perfect evolutionary sense that we should have the ability to detect or taste glutamate
🎧 because it is the amino acid which is most common in natural foods.
🎧 John Prescott, an associate professor at the University of Chicago,
🎧 suggests that this fifth taste serves a purpose just as the other tastes do.
🎧 He suggests that it signals to us the presence of protein in food,
🎧 in the same way that sweetness indicates that a food contains energy-giving carbohydrates.
🎧 Bitterness, he says, alerts us to toxins in the food,
🎧 while sourness warns us of spoilage
🎧 and saltiness signals the presence of minerals.
🎧 So, what else do we know about...
