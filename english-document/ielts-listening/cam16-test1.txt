🎧 Hello. Children's Engineering Workshops.
🎧 Oh hello.
🎧 I wanted some information about the workshops in the school holidays.
🎧 Sure.
🎧 I have two daughters who are interested.
🎧 The younger one's Lydia, she's four,
🎧 do you take children as young as that?
🎧 Yes,
🎧 our Tiny Engineers workshop is for four to five-year-olds.
🎧 What sorts of activities do they do?
🎧 All sorts.
🎧 For example, they work together to design a special cover that goes round an egg,
🎧 so that when it's inside they can drop it from a height and it doesn't break.
🎧 Well, sometimes it does break but that's part of the fun!
🎧 Right.
🎧 And Lydia loves building things.
🎧 Is there any opportunity for her to do that?
🎧 Well, they have a competition to see who can make the highest tower.
🎧 You'd be amazed how high they can go.
🎧 Right.
🎧 But they're learning all the time as well as having fun.
🎧 For example, one thing they do is to design and build a car that's attached to a balloon,
🎧 and the force of the air in that actually powers the car and makes it move along.
🎧 They go really fast too.
🎧 OK, well, all this sounds perfect.
🎧 Now Carly, that's my older daughter, has just had her seventh birthday,
🎧 so presumably she'd be in a different group?
🎧 Yes, she'd be in the Junior Engineers.
🎧 That's for children from six to eight.
🎧 And do they do the same sorts of activities?
🎧 Some are the same, but a bit more advanced.
🎧 So they work out how to build model vehicles,
🎧 things like cars and trucks,
🎧 but also how to construct animals using the same sorts of material and technique,
🎧 and then they learn how they can program them and make them move.
🎧 So they learn a bit of coding?
🎧 They do.
🎧 They pick it up really quickly.
🎧 We're there to help if they need it,
🎧 but they learn from one another too.
🎧 Right.
🎧 And do they have competitions too?
🎧 Yes, with the Junior Engineers,
🎧 it's to use recycled materials like card and wood to build a bridge,
🎧 and the longest one gets a prize.
🎧 That sounds fun.
🎧 I wouldn't mind doing that myself!
🎧 Then they have something a bit different,
🎧 which is to think up an idea for a five-minute movie and then film it,
🎧 using special animation software.
🎧 You'd be amazed what they come up with.
🎧 And of course, that's something they can put on their phone and take home to show all their friends.
🎧 Exactly.
🎧 And then they also build a robot in the shape of a human,
🎧 and they decorate it and program it so that it can move its arms and legs.
🎧 Perfect.
🎧 So, is it the same price as the Tiny Engineers?
🎧 It's just a bit more:
🎧 £50 for the five weeks.
🎧 And are the classes on a Monday, too?
🎧 They used to be,
🎧 but we found it didn't give our staff enough time to clear up after the first workshop,
🎧 so we moved them to Wednesdays.
🎧 The classes are held in the morning from ten to eleven.
🎧 OK.
🎧 That's better for me actually.
🎧 And what about the location?
🎧 Where exactly are the workshops held?
🎧 They're in building 10A,
🎧 there's a big sign on the door, you can't miss it,
🎧 and that's in Fradstone Industrial Estate.
🎧 Sorry?
🎧 Fradstone,
🎧 that's Fradstone
🎧 And that's in Grasford, isn't it?
🎧 Yes, up past the station.
🎧 And will I have any parking problems there?
🎧 No, there's always plenty available.
🎧 So would you like to enrol Lydia and Carly now?
🎧 OK.
🎧 So can I have...
🎧 
🎧 Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Stevenson's,
🎧 one of the country's major manufacturers of metal goods.
🎧 Thank you for choosing us for your two weeks of work experience.
🎧 My name is Julia Simmons,
🎧 and since the beginning of this year I've been the managing director.
🎧 Stevenson's is quite an old company.
🎧 Like me, the founder, Ronald Stevenson, went into the steel industry when he left school,
🎧 that was in 1923.
🎧 He set up this company when he finished his apprenticeship, in 1926,
🎧 although he actually started making plans two years earlier, in 1924.
🎧 He was a very determined young man!
🎧 Stevenson's long-term plan was to manufacture components for the machine tools industry,
🎧 although in fact that never came about,
🎧 and for the automotive industry, that is, cars and lorries.
🎧 However, there was a delay of five years before that happened,
🎧 because shortly before the company went into production,
🎧 Stevenson was given the opportunity to make goods for hospitals
🎧 and other players in the healthcare industry,
🎧 so that's what we did for the first five years.
🎧 Over the years, we've expanded the premises considerably,
🎧 we were lucky that the site is big enough,
🎧 so moving to a new location has never been necessary.
🎧 However, the layout is far from ideal for modern machinery and production methods,
🎧 so we intend to carry out major refurbishment of this site over the next five years.
🎧 I'd better give you some idea of what you'll be doing during your two weeks with us,
🎧 so you know what to expect.
🎧 Most mornings you'll have a presentation from one of the managers,
🎧 to learn about their department, starting this morning with research and development.
🎧 And you'll all spend some time in each department,
🎧 observing what's going on and talking to people,
🎧 as long as you don't stop them from doing their work altogether!
🎧 In the past, a teacher from your school has come in at the end of each week
🎧 to find out how the group were getting on,
🎧 but your school isn't able to arrange that this year.
🎧 OK, now I'll briefly help you to orientate yourselves around the site.
🎧 As you can see, we're in the reception area,
🎧 which we try to make attractive and welcoming to visitors.
🎧 There's a corridor running left from here,
🎧 and if you go along that,
🎧 the door facing you at the end is the entrance to the coffee room.
🎧 This looks out onto the main road on one side, and some trees on the other,
🎧 and that'll be where you meet each morning.
🎧 The factory is the very big room on the far side of the site.
🎧 Next to it is the warehouse,
🎧 which can be accessed by lorries going up the road to the turning area at the end.
🎧 You can get to the warehouse by crossing to the far side of the courtyard,
🎧 and then the door is on your right.
🎧 Somewhere you'll be keen to find is the staff canteen.
🎧 This is right next to reception.
🎧 I can confidently say that the food's very good,
🎧 but the view isn't.
🎧 The windows on one side look onto a corridor and courtyard,
🎧 which aren't very attractive at all,
🎧 and on the other onto the access road, which isn't much better.
🎧 You'll be using the meeting room quite often,
🎧 and you'll find it by walking along the corridor to the left of the courtyard,
🎧 and continuing along it to the end.
🎧 The meeting room is the last one on the right,
🎧 and I'm afraid there's no natural daylight in the room.
🎧 Then you'll need to know where some of the offices are.
🎧 The human resources department is at the front of this building,
🎧 so you head to the left along the corridor from reception,
🎧 and it's the second room you come to.
🎧 It looks out onto the main road.
🎧 And finally, the boardroom, where you'll be meeting sometimes.
🎧 That has quite a pleasant view, as it looks out onto the trees.
🎧 Go along the corridor past the courtyard, right to the end.
🎧 The boardroom is on the left, next to the factory.
🎧 OK, now are there any questions...
🎧 
🎧 How are you getting on with your art project, Tom?
🎧 OK.
🎧 Like, they gave us the theme of birds to base our project on,
🎧 and I'm not really all that interested in wildlife.
🎧 But I'm starting to get into it.
🎧 I've pretty well finished the introductory stage.
🎧 So have I.
🎧 When they gave us all those handouts with details of books and websites to look at,
🎧 I was really put off,
🎧 but the more I read, the more interested I got.
🎧 Me too.
🎧 I found I could research so many different aspects of birds in art - colour, movement, texture.
🎧 So I was looking forward to the Bird Park visit.
🎧 What a letdown!
🎧 It poured with rain and we hardly saw a single bird.
🎧 Much less use than the trip to the Natural History Museum.
🎧 Yeah, I liked all the stuff about evolution there.
🎧 The workshop sessions with Dr Fletcher were good too,
🎧 especially the brainstorming sessions.
🎧 Oh... I missed those because I was ill.
🎧 I wish we could've seen the projects last year's students did.
🎧 Mm. I suppose they want us to do our own thing, not copy.
🎧 Have you drafted your proposal yet?
🎧 Yes, but I haven't handed it in.
🎧 I need to amend some parts.
🎧 I've realised the notes from my research are almost all just descriptions,
🎧 I haven't actually evaluated anything.
🎧 So I'll have to fix that.
🎧 Oh, I didn't know we had to do that.
🎧 I'll have to look at that too.
🎧 Did you do a timeline for the project?
🎧 Yes, and a mind map.
🎧 Yeah, so did I.
🎧 I quite enjoyed that.
🎧 But it was hard having to explain the basis for my decisions in my action plan.
🎧 What?
🎧 You know, give a rationale.
🎧 I didn't realise we had to do that.
🎧 OK, I can add it now.
🎧 And I've done the video diary presentation,
🎧 and worked out what I want my outcome to be in the project.
🎧 Someone told me it's best not to be too precise about your actual outcome at this stage,
🎧 so you have more scope to explore your ideas later on.
🎧 So I'm going to go back to my proposal to make it a bit more vague.
🎧 Really? OK, I'll change that too then.
🎧 One part of the project I'm unsure about is where we choose some paintings of birds and say what they mean to us.
🎧 Like, I chose a painting of a falcon by Landseer.
🎧 I like it because the bird's standing there with his head turned to one side,
🎧 but he seems to be staring straight at you.
🎧 But I can't just say it's a bit scary, can I?
🎧 You could talk about the possible danger suggested by the bird's look.
🎧 Oh, OK.
🎧 There's a picture of a fish hawk by Audubon I like.
🎧 It's swooping over the water with a fish in its talons,
🎧 and with great black wings which take up most of the picture.
🎧 So you could discuss it in relation to predators and food chains?
🎧 Well actually I think I'll concentrate on the impression of rapid motion it gives.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Do you know that picture of a kingfisher by van Gogh -
🎧 it's perching on a reed growing near a stream.
🎧 Yes, it's got these beautiful blue and red and black shades.
🎧 I've actually chosen it because I saw a real kingfisher once when I was little,
🎧 I was out walking with my grandfather, and I've never forgotten it.
🎧 So we can use a personal link?
🎧 Sure.
🎧 OK.
🎧 There's a portrait called William Wells.
🎧 I can't remember the artist but it's a middle-aged man who's just shot a bird.
🎧 And his expression, and the way he's holding the bird in his hand
🎧 suggests he's not sure about what he's done.
🎧 To me it's about how ambiguous people are in the way they exploit the natural world.
🎧 Interesting.
🎧 There's Gauguin's picture Vairumati.
🎧 He did it in Tahiti.
🎧 It's a woman with a white bird behind her that is eating a lizard,
🎧 and what I'm interested in is what idea this bird refers to.
🎧 Apparently, it's a reference to the never-ending cycle of existence.
🎧 Wow.
🎧 I chose a portrait of a little boy, Giovanni de Medici.
🎧 He's holding a tiny bird in one fist.
🎧 I like the way he's holding it carefully so he doesn't hurt it.
🎧 Ah right.
🎧 
🎧 Ancient philosophy is not just about talking or lecturing,
🎧 or even reading long, dense books.
🎧 In fact, it is something people have used throughout history -
🎧 to solve their problems and to achieve their greatest triumphs.
🎧 Specifically, I am referring to Stoicism,
🎧 which, in my opinion, is the most practical of all philosophies
🎧 and therefore the most appealing.
🎧 Stoicism was founded in Ancient Greece by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC,
🎧 but was practised by the likes of Epictetus,
🎧 Cato, Seneca and Marcus Aurelius.
🎧 Amazingly, we still have access to these ideas,
🎧 despite the fact that the most famous Stoics never wrote anything down for publication,
🎧 Cato definitely didn't.
🎧 Marcus Aurelius never intended his Meditations to be anything but personal.
🎧 Seneca's letters were, well, letters
🎧 and Epictetus' thoughts come to us by way of a note-taking student.
🎧 Stoic principles were based on the idea that its followers could have an unshakable happiness in this life
🎧 and the key to achieving this was virtue.
🎧 The road to virtue, in turn, lay in understanding that destructive emotions, like anger and jealousy,
🎧 are under our conscious control,
🎧 they don't have to control us, because we can learn to control them.
🎧 In the words of Epictetus:
🎧 “external events I cannot control, but the choices I make with regard to them, I do control”.
🎧 The modern day philosopher and writer Nassim Nicholas Taleb
🎧 defines a Stoic as someone who has a different perspective on experiences
🎧 which most of us would see as wholly negative;
🎧 a Stoic “transforms fear into caution, pain into transformation,
🎧 mistakes into initiation and desire into undertaking”.
🎧 Using this definition as a model,
🎧 we can see that throughout the centuries Stoicism has been practised in more recent history
🎧 by kings, presidents, artists, writers and entrepreneurs.
🎧 The founding fathers of the United States were inspired by the philosophy.
🎧 George Washington was introduced to Stoicism by his neighbours at age seventeen,
🎧 and later, put on a play based on the life of Cato to inspire his men.
🎧 Thomas Jefferson kept a copy of Seneca beside his bed.
🎧 Writers and artists have also been inspired by the stoics.
🎧 Eugène Delacroix, the renowned French Romantic artist
🎧 (known best for his painting Liberty Leading the People)
🎧 was an ardent Stoic, referring to it as his “consoling religion”.
🎧 The economist Adam Smith's theories on capitalism were significantly influenced by the Stoicism
🎧 that he studied as a schoolboy, under a teacher who had translated Marcus Aurelius' works.
🎧 Today's political leaders are no different,
🎧 with many finding their inspiration from the ancient texts.
🎧 Former US president Bill Clinton rereads Marcus Aurelius every single year,
🎧 and many have compared former President Obama's calm leadership style to that of Cato.
🎧 Wen Jiabao, the former prime minister of China,
🎧 claims that Meditations is one of two books he travels with
🎧 and that he has read it more than 100 times over the course of his life.
🎧 Stoicism had a profound influence on Albert Ellis,
🎧 who invented Cognitive Behaviour Therapy,
🎧 which is used to help people manage their problems by changing the way that they think and behave.
🎧 It's most commonly used to treat depression.
🎧 The idea is that we can take control of our lives by challenging the irrational beliefs
🎧 that create our faulty thinking, symptoms and behaviours by using logic instead.
🎧 Stoicism has also become popular in the world of business.
🎧 Stoic principles can build the resilience and state of mind required to overcome setbacks
🎧 because Stoics teach turning obstacles into opportunity.
🎧 A lesson every business entrepreneur needs to learn.
🎧 I would argue that studying Stoicism is as relevant today as it was 2,000 years ago,
🎧 thanks to its brilliant insights into how to lead a good life.
🎧 At the very root of the thinking, there is a very simple way of living -
🎧 control what you can and accept what you can't.
🎧 This is not as easy as it sounds and will require considerable practice -
🎧 it can take a lifetime to master.
🎧 The Stoics also believed the most important foundation for a good and happy life is not money, fame, power or pleasure,
🎧 but having a disciplined and principled character -
🎧 something which seems to resonate with many people today.
