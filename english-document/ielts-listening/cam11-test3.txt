[137] Cam11 - Test 3 - Part 1

🎧 Good morning. This is Burnham tourist office, Martin speaking.
🎧 Oh, hello.
🎧 I saw a poster about free things to do in the area,
🎧 and it said people should phone you for information.
🎧 I'm coming to Burnham with my husband and two children for a few days on June the 27th,
🎧 or possibly the 28th,
🎧 and I'd like some ideas for things to do on the 29th.
🎧 Yes, of course. OK.
🎧 Then let's start with a couple of events especially for children.
🎧 The art gallery is holding an event called 'Family Welcome' that day,
🎧 when there are activities and trails to use throughout the gallery.
🎧 That sounds interesting.
🎧 What time does it start?
🎧 The gallery opens at 10, and the 'Family Welcome' event runs from 10.30 until 2 o'clock.
🎧 The gallery stays open until 5.
🎧 And several times during the day, they're going to show a short film that the gallery has produced.
🎧 It demonstrates how ceramics are made,
🎧 and there'll be equipment and materials for children to have a go themselves.
🎧 Last time they ran the event, there was a film about painting,
🎧 which went down very well with the children,
🎧 and they're now working on one about sculpture.
🎧 I like the sound of that.
🎧 And what other events happen in Burnham?
🎧 Well, do you all enjoy listening to music?
🎧 Oh, yes.
🎧 Well there are several free concerts taking place at different times -
🎧 one or two in the morning,
🎧 the majority at lunchtime, and a couple in the evening.
🎧 And they range from pop music to Latin American.
🎧 The Latin American could be fun.
🎧 What time is that?
🎧 It's being repeated several times, in different places.
🎧 They're performing in the central library at 1 o'clock,
🎧 then at 4 it's in the City Museum,
🎧 and in the evening, at 7.30, there's a longer concert, in the theatre.
🎧 Right. I'll suggest that to the rest of the family.
🎧 Something else you might be interested in is the boat race along the river.
🎧 Oh, yes, do tell me about that.
🎧 The race starts at Offord Marina, to the north of Burnham, and goes as far as Summer Pool.
🎧 The best place to watch it from is Charlesworth Bridge, though that does get rather crowded.
🎧 And who's taking part?
🎧 Well, local boat clubs, but the standard is very high.
🎧 One of them came first in the West of England regional championship in May this year -
🎧 it was the first time a team from Burnham has won.
🎧 It means that next year they'll be representing the region in the national championship.
🎧 Now I've heard something about Paxton Nature Reserve.
🎧 It's a good place for spotting unusual birds, isn't it?
🎧 That's right - throughout the year.
🎧 There is a lake there, as well as a river,
🎧 and they provide a very attractive habitat.
🎧 So it's a good idea to bring binoculars if you have them.
🎧 And just at the moment you can see various flowers that are pretty unusual -
🎧 the soil at Paxton isn't very common.
🎧 They're looking good right now.
🎧 Right.
🎧 My husband will be particularly interested in that.
🎧 And there's going to be a talk and slide show about mushrooms -
🎧 and you'll be able to go out and pick some afterwards and study the different varieties.
🎧 Uhuh. And is it possible for children to swim in the river?
🎧 Yes. Part of it has been fenced off to make it safe for children to swim in.
🎧 It's very shallow, and there's a lifeguard on duty whenever it's open.
🎧 The lake is too deep, so swimming isn't allowed there.
🎧 OK, we must remember to bring their swimming things, in case we go to Paxton.
🎧 How long does it take to get there by car from Burnham?
🎧 About 20 minutes,
🎧 but parking is very limited, so it's usually much easier to go by bus -
🎧 and it takes about the same time.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Well. I'll discuss the options with the rest of the family.
🎧 Thanks very much for all your help.
🎧 You're welcome.
🎧 Goodbye.
🎧 Bye.

[138] Cam11 - Test 3 - Part 2

🎧 First of all, let me thank you all for coming to this public meeting, to discuss the future of our town.
🎧 Our first speaker is Shona Ferguson, from Barford town council.
🎧 Shone.
🎧 Thank you.
🎧 First I'll briefly give you some background information,
🎧 then I'll be asking you for your comments on developments in the town.
🎧 Well, as you don't need me to tell you, Barford has changed a great deal in the last 50 years.
🎧 These are some of the main changes.
🎧 Fifty years ago, buses linked virtually every part of the town and the neighbouring towns and villages.
🎧 Most people used them frequently,
🎧 but not now because the bus companies concentrate on just the routes that attract most passengers.
🎧 So parts of the town are no longer served by buses.
🎧 Even replacing old uncomfortable buses with smart new ones has had little impact on passenger numbers.
🎧 It's sometimes said that bus fares are too high,
🎧 but in relation to average incomes, fares are not much higher than they were 50 years ago.
🎧 Changes in the road network are affecting the town.
🎧 The centre was recently closed to traffic on a trial basis, making it much safer for pedestrians.
🎧 The impact of this is being measured.
🎧 The new cycle paths separating bikes from cars in most main roads,
🎧 are being used far more than was expected reducing traffic and improving air quality.
🎧 And although the council's attempts to have a bypass constructed have failed,
🎧 we haven't given up hope of persuading the government to change its mind.
🎧 Shopping in the town centre has changed over the years.
🎧 Many of us can remember when the town was crowded with people going shopping.
🎧 Numbers have been falling for several years,
🎧 despite efforts to attract shoppers, for instance by opening new car parks.
🎧 Some people combine shopping with visits to the town's restaurants and cafés.
🎧 Most shops are small independent stores, which is good,
🎧 but many people prefer to use supermarkets and department stores in nearby large towns,
🎧 as there are so few well-known chain stores here.
🎧 Turning now to medical facilities,
🎧 the town is served by family doctors in several medical practices -
🎧 fewer than 50 years ago, but each catering for far more patients.
🎧 Our hospital closed 15 years ago,
🎧 which means journeys to other towns are unavoidable.
🎧 On the other hand, there are more dentists than there used to be.
🎧 Employment patterns have changed, along with almost everything else.
🎧 The number of schools and colleges has increased making that the main employment sector.
🎧 Services, such as website design and accountancy, have grown in importance,
🎧 and surprisingly, perhaps, manufacturing hasn't seen the decline that has affected it in other parts of the country.
🎧 Now I'll very quickly outline current plans for some of the town's facilities,
🎧 before asking for your comments.
🎧 As you'll know if you regularly use the car park at the railway station, it's usually full.
🎧 The railway company applied for permission to replace it with a multi-storey car park,
🎧 but that was refused.
🎧 Instead, the company has bought some adjoining land, and this will be used to increase the number of parking spaces.
🎧 The Grand, the old cinema in the high street will close at the end of the year,
🎧 and reopen on a different site.
🎧 You've probably seen the building under construction.
🎧 The plan is to have three screens with fewer seats, rather than just the one large auditorium in the old cinema.
🎧 I expect many of you shop in the indoor market.
🎧 It's become more and more shabby-looking,
🎧 and because of fears about safety, it was threatened with demolition.
🎧 The good news is that it will close for six weeks to be made safe and redecorated,
🎧 and the improved building will open in July.
🎧 Lots of people use the library, including school and college students who go there to study.
🎧 The council has managed to secure funding to keep the library open later into the evening, twice a week.
🎧 We would like to enlarge the building in the not-too-distant future,
🎧 but this is by no means definite.
🎧 There's no limit on access to the nature reserve on the edge of town,
🎧 and this will continue to be the case.
🎧 What will change, though, is that the council will no longer be in charge of the area.
🎧 Instead it will become the responsibility of a national body
🎧 that administers most nature reserves in the country.
🎧 OK, now...

[139] Cam11 - Test 3 - Part 3

🎧 Hello, Helen. Sorry I'm late.
🎧 Hi, Jeremy, no problem.
🎧 Well we'd better work out where we are on our project, I suppose.
🎧 Yeah. I've looked at the drawings you've done for my story, 'The Forest',
🎧 and I think they're brilliant - they really create the atmosphere I had in mind when I was writing it.
🎧 I'm glad you like them.
🎧 There are just a few suggestions I'd like to make.
🎧 Go ahead.
🎧 Now, I'm not sure about the drawing of the cave -
🎧 it's got trees all around it, which is great,
🎧 but the drawing's a bit too static, isn't it?
🎧 I think it needs some action.
🎧 Yes, there's nothing happening.
🎧 Perhaps I should add the boy - Malcolm, isn't it?
🎧 He would be walking up to it.
🎧 Yes, let's have Malcolm in the drawing.
🎧 And what about putting in a tiger -
🎧 the one that he makes friends with a bit later? Maybe it could be sitting under a tree washing itself.
🎧 And the tiger stops in the middle of what it's doing when it sees Malcolm walking past.
🎧 That's a good idea.
🎧 OK, I'll have a go at that.
🎧 Then there's the drawing of the crowd of men and women dancing.
🎧 They're just outside the forest, and there's a lot going on.
🎧 That's right, you wanted them to be watching a carnival procession, but I thought it would be too crowded.
🎧 Do you think it works like this?
🎧 Yes, I like what you've done.
🎧 The only thing is, could you add Malcolm to it, without changing what's already there.
🎧 What about having him sitting on the tree trunk on the right of the picture?
🎧 Yes, that would be fine.
🎧 And do you want him watching the other people?
🎧 No, he's been left out of all the fun, so I'd like him to be crying -
🎧 that'll contrast nicely with the next picture,
🎧 where he's laughing at the clowns in the carnival.
🎧 Right, I'll do that.
🎧 And then the drawing of the people ice skating in the forest.
🎧 I wasn't too happy with that one.
🎧 Because they're supposed to be skating on grass aren't they?
🎧 That's right, and it's frozen over.
🎧 At the moment it doesn't look quite right.
🎧 I see what you mean.
🎧 I'll have another go at that.
🎧 And I like the wool hats they're wearing.
🎧 Maybe you could give each of them a scarf as well.
🎧 Yeah, that's easy enough.
🎧 They can be streaming out behind the people to suggest they're skating really fast.
🎧 Great.
🎧 Well that's all on the drawings.
🎧 Right.
🎧 So you've finished writing your story and I just need to finish illustrating it,
🎧 and my story and your drawings are done.
🎧 So the next thing is to decide what exactly we need to write about in the report that goes with the stories,
🎧 and how we're going to divide the work.
🎧 Right, Helen.
🎧 What do you think about including a section on how we planned the project as a whole, Jeremy?
🎧 That's probably quite important.
🎧 Yeah. Well, you've had most of the good ideas so far.
🎧 How do you feel about drafting something,
🎧 then we can go through it together and discuss it?
🎧 OK, that seems reasonable.
🎧 And I could include something on how we came up with the ideas for our two stories, couldn't I?
🎧 Well, I've started writing something about that,
🎧 so why don't you do the same and we can include the two things.
🎧 Right.
🎧 So what about our interpretation of the stories?
🎧 Do we need to write about what we think they show,
🎧 like the value of helping other people, all that sort of thing?
🎧 That's going to come up later isn't it?
🎧 I think everyone in the class is going to read each other's stories
🎧 and come up with their own interpretations which we're going to discuss.
🎧 Oh, I missed that.
🎧 So it isn't going to be part of the report at all?
🎧 No.
🎧 But we need to write about the illustrations, because they're an essential element of children's experience of reading the stories.
🎧 It's probably easiest for you to write that section, as you know more about drawing than I do.
🎧 Maybe, but I find it quite hard to write about.
🎧 I'd be happier if you did it.
🎧 OK.
🎧 So when do you think…

[140] Cam11 - Test 3 - Part 4

🎧 So what I'm going to talk about to you today is something called Ethnography.
🎧 This is a type of research aimed at exploring the way human cultures work.
🎧 It was first developed for use in anthropology,
🎧 and it's also been used in sociology and communication studies.
🎧 So what's it got to do with business, you may ask.
🎧 Well, businesses are finding that ethnography can offer them deeper insight into the possible needs of customers,
🎧 either present or future,
🎧 as well as providing valuable information about their attitudes towards existing products.
🎧 And ethnography can also help companies to design new products or services that customers really want.
🎧 Let's look at some examples of how ethnographic research works in business.
🎧 One team of researchers did a project for a company manufacturing kitchen equipment.
🎧 They watched how cooks used measuring cups to measure out things like sugar and flour.
🎧 They saw that the cooks had to check and recheck the contents,
🎧 because although the measuring cups had numbers inside them,
🎧 the cooks couldn't see these easily.
🎧 So a new design of cup was developed to overcome this problem,
🎧 and it was a top seller.
🎧 Another team of ethnographic researchers looked at how cell phones were used in Uganda, in Africa.
🎧 They found that people who didn't have their own phones could pay to use the phones of local entrepreneurs.
🎧 Because these customers paid in advance for their calls,
🎧 they were eager to know how much time they'd spent on the call so far.
🎧 So the phone company designed phones for use globally with this added feature.
🎧 Ethnographic research has also been carried out in computer companies.
🎧 In one company, IT systems administrators were observed for several weeks.
🎧 It was found that a large amount of their work involved communicating with colleagues in order to solve problems,
🎧 but that they didn't have a standard way of exchanging information from spreadsheets and so on.
🎧 So the team came up with an idea for software that would help them to do this.
🎧 In another piece of research, a team observed and talked to nurses working in hospitals.
🎧 This led to the recognition that the nurses needed to access the computer records of their patients,
🎧 no matter where they were.
🎧 This led to the development of a portable computer tablet
🎧 that allowed the nurses to check records in locations throughout the hospital.
🎧 Occasionally, research can be done even in environments where the researchers can't be present.
🎧 For example, in one project done for an airline,
🎧 respondents used their smartphones to record information during airline trips,
🎧 in a study aiming at tracking the emotions of passengers during a flight.
🎧 So what makes studies like these different from ordinary research?
🎧 Let's look at some of the general principles behind ethnographic research in business.
🎧 First of all, the researcher has to be completely open-minded -
🎧 he or she hasn't thought up a hypothesis to be tested, as is the case in other types of research.
🎧 Instead they wait for the participants in the research to inform them.
🎧 As far as choosing the participants themselves is concerned,
🎧 that's not really all that different from ordinary research -
🎧 the criteria according to which the participants are chosen may be something as simple as the age bracket they fall into,
🎧 or the researchers may select them according to their income,
🎧 or they might try to find a set of people who all use a particular product, for example.
🎧 But it's absolutely crucial to recruit the right people as participants.
🎧 As well as the criteria I've mentioned,
🎧 they have to be comfortable talking about themselves
🎧 and being watched as they go about their activities.
🎧 Actually, most researchers say that people open up pretty easily,
🎧 maybe because they're often in their own home or workplace.
🎧 So what makes this type of research special is that it's not just a matter of sending a questionnaire to the participants,
🎧 instead the research is usually based on first-hand observation of what they are doing at the time.
🎧 But that doesn't mean that the researcher never talks to the participants.
🎧 However, unlike in traditional research,
🎧 in this case it's the participant rather than the researchers
🎧 who decides what direction the interview will follow.
🎧 This means that there's less likelihood of the researcher imposing his or her own ideas on the participant.
🎧 But after they've said goodbye to their participants and got back to their office,
🎧 the researchers' work isn't finished.
🎧 Most researchers estimate that 70 to 80 percent of their time is spent not on the collecting of data but on its analysis -
🎧 looking at photos listening to recordings and transcribing them and so on.
🎧 The researchers may end up with hundreds of pages of notes.
🎧 And to determine what's significant, they don't focus on the sensational things or the unusual things,
🎧 instead they try to identify a pattern of some sort in all this data,
🎧 and to discern the meaning behind it.
🎧 This can result in some compelling insights that can in turn feed back to the whole design process.
