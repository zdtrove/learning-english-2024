🎧 Hello. Do you mind if I ask you some questions about your journey today?
🎧 We're doing a customer satisfaction survey.
🎧 Yes. OK. I've got about ten minutes before my train home leaves.
🎧 I'm on a day trip.
🎧 Great. Thank you.
🎧 So first of all, could you tell me your name?
🎧 It's Sophie Bird.
🎧 Thank you.
🎧 And would you mind telling me what you do?
🎧 I'm a journalist.
🎧 Oh really? That must be interesting.
🎧 Yes. It is.
🎧 So was the reason for your visit here today work?
🎧 Actually, it's my day off.
🎧 I came here to do some shopping.
🎧 Oh right.
🎧 But I do sometimes come here for work.
🎧 OK.
🎧 Now I'd like to ask some questions about your journey today, if that's OK.
🎧 Yes. No problem.
🎧 Right, so can you tell me which station you're travelling back to?
🎧 Staunfirth, where I live.
🎧 Ah, can I just check the spelling?
🎧 STAUNFIRTH?
🎧 That's right.
🎧 And you travelled from there this morning?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 OK, good.
🎧 Next, can I ask what kind of ticket you bought?
🎧 I assume it wasn't a season ticket, as you don't travel every day.
🎧 That's right. No, I just got a normal return ticket.
🎧 I don't have a rail card so I didn't get any discount.
🎧 I keep meaning to get one because it's a lot cheaper.
🎧 Yes - you'd have saved 20% on your ticket today.
🎧 So you paid the full price for your ticket?
🎧 I paid £23.70.
🎧 OK.
🎧 Do you think that's good value for money?
🎧 Not really.
🎧 I think it's too much for a journey that only takes 45 minutes.
🎧 Yes, that's one of the main complaints we get.
🎧 So, you didn't buy your ticket in advance?
🎧 No.
🎧 I know it's cheaper if you buy a week in advance but I didn't know I was coming then.
🎧 I know.
🎧 You can't always plan ahead, so...
🎧 er.. did you buy it this morning?
🎧 No, it was yesterday.
🎧 Right.
🎧 And do you usually buy your tickets at the station?
🎧 Well, I do usually but the ticket office closes early and I hate using ticket machines.
🎧 I think ticket offices should be open for longer hours.
🎧 There's always a queue for the machines and they're often out of order.
🎧 Hmm... A lot of customers are saying the same thing.
🎧 So to answer your question… I got an e-ticket online.
🎧 OK.
🎧 Thank you.
🎧 Now I'd like to ask you about your satisfaction with your journey.
🎧 So what would you say you were most satisfied with today?
🎧 Well, I like the wifi on the train.
🎧 It's improved a lot.
🎧 It makes it easier for me to work if I want to.
🎧 That's the first time today anyone's mentioned that.
🎧 It's good to get some positive feedback on that.
🎧 And, um... is there anything you weren't satisfied with?
🎧 Well, normally, the trains run on time and are pretty reliable
🎧 but today there was a delay;
🎧 the train was about 15 minutes behind schedule.
🎧 OK. I'll put that down.
🎧 Now I'd also like to ask about the facilities at this station.
🎧 You've probably noticed that the whole station's been upgraded.
🎧 What are you most satisfied with?
🎧 Oh... I think the best thing is that they've improved the amount of information about train times etc. that's given to passengers -
🎧 it's much clearer -
🎧 before there was only one board and I couldn't always see it properly,
🎧 which was frustrating.
🎧 That's good.
🎧 And is there anything you're not satisfied with?
🎧 Let's see…
🎧 I think things have generally improved a lot.
🎧 The trains are much more modern and I like the new café.
🎧 But one thing is that there aren't enough places to sit down,
🎧 especially on the platforms.
🎧 OK,
🎧 so I'll put 'seating' down, shall I, as the thing you're least satisfied with?
🎧 Yes, OK.
🎧 Can I ask your opinion about some of the other facilities?
🎧 We'd like feedback on whether people are satisfied, dissatisfied or neither satisfied nor dissatisfied.
🎧 OK.
🎧 What about the parking at the station?
🎧 Well to be honest, I don't really have an opinion as I never use it.
🎧 So, neither satisfied nor dissatisfied for that then.
🎧 Yes, I suppose so…
🎧 OK, and what about…
🎧 
🎧 As chair of the town council subcommittee on park facilities,
🎧 I'd like to bring you up to date on some of the changes that have been made recently to the Croft Valley Park.
🎧 So if you could just take a look at the map I handed out,
🎧 let's begin with a general overview.
🎧 So the basic arrangement of the park hasn't changed -
🎧 it still has two gates, north and south, and a lake in the middle.
🎧 The café continues to serve an assortment of drinks and snacks
🎧 and is still in the same place,
🎧 looking out over the lake and next to the old museum.
🎧 We're hoping to change the location of the toilets,
🎧 and bring them nearer to the centre of the park
🎧 as they're a bit out of the way at present, near the adventure playground, in the corner of your map.
🎧 The formal gardens have been replanted and should be at their best in a month or two.
🎧 They used to be behind the old museum,
🎧 but we've now used the space near the south gate -
🎧 between the park boundary and the path that goes past the lake towards the old museum.
🎧 We have a new outdoor gym for adults and children,
🎧 which is already proving very popular.
🎧 It's by the glass houses, just to the right of the path from the south gate.
🎧 You have to look for it as it's a bit hidden in the trees.
🎧 One very successful introduction has been our skateboard ramp.
🎧 It's in constant use during the evenings and holidays.
🎧 It's near the old museum,
🎧 at the end of a little path that leads off from the main path between the lake and the museum.
🎧 We've also introduced a new area for wild flowers, to attract bees and butterflies.
🎧 It's on a bend in the path that goes round the east side of the lake,
🎧 just south of the adventure playground.
🎧 Now let me tell you a bit more about some of the changes to Croft Valley Park.
🎧 One of our most exciting developments has been the adventure playground.
🎧 We were aware that we had nowhere for children to let off steam,
🎧 and decided to use our available funds
🎧 to set up a completely new facility in a large space to the north of the park.
🎧 It's open year-round, though it closes early in the winter months,
🎧 and entrance is completely free.
🎧 Children can choose whatever activities they want to do, irrespective of their age,
🎧 but we do ask adults not to leave them on their own there.
🎧 There are plenty of seats where parents can relax and keep an eye on their children at the same time.
🎧 Lastly, the glass houses.
🎧 A huge amount of work has been done on them
🎧 to repair the damage following the disastrous fire that recently destroyed their western side.
🎧 Over £80,000 was spent on replacing the glass walls and the metal supports,
🎧 as well as the plants that had been destroyed,
🎧 although unfortunately the collection of tropical palm trees has proved too expensive to replace up to now.
🎧 At present the glass houses are open from 10 am to 3 pm Mondays to Thursdays,
🎧 and it's hoped to extend this to the weekend soon.
🎧 We're grateful to all those who helped us by contributing their time and money to this achievement.
🎧 
🎧 OK, Jack. Before we plan our presentation about refrigeration,
🎧 let's discuss what we've discovered so far.
🎧 Fine, Annie.
🎧 Though I have to admit I haven't done much research yet.
🎧 Nor me.
🎧 But I found an interesting article about icehouses.
🎧 I'd seen some 18th- and 19th-century ones here in the UK,
🎧 so I knew they were often built in a shady area or underground,
🎧 close to lakes that might freeze in the winter.
🎧 Then blocks of ice could be cut and stored in the icehouse.
🎧 But I didn't realise that insulating the blocks with straw or sawdust meant they didn't melt for months.
🎧 The ancient Romans had refrigeration, too.
🎧 I didn't know that.
🎧 Yes, pits were dug in the ground,
🎧 and snow was imported from the mountains -
🎧 even though they were at quite a distance.
🎧 The snow was stored in the pits.
🎧 Ice formed at the bottom of it.
🎧 Both the ice and the snow were then sold.
🎧 The ice cost more than the snow
🎧 and my guess is that only the wealthy members of society could afford it.
🎧 I wouldn't be surprised.
🎧 I also came across an article about modern domestic fridges.
🎧 Several different technologies are used,
🎧 but they were too complex for me to understand.
🎧 You have to wonder what happens when people get rid of old ones.
🎧 You mean because the gases in them are harmful for the environment?
🎧 Exactly.
🎧 At least there are now plenty of organisations that will recycle most of the components safely,
🎧 but of course some people just dump old fridges in the countryside.
🎧 It's hard to see how they can be stopped unfortunately.
🎧 In the UK we get rid of three million a year altogether!
🎧 That sounds a lot, especially because fridges hardly ever break down.
🎧 That's right.
🎧 In this country we keep domestic fridges for 11 years on average,
🎧 and a lot last for 20 or more.
🎧 So if you divide the cost by the number of years you can use a fridge, they're not expensive,
🎧 compared with some household appliances.
🎧 True.
🎧 I suppose manufacturers encourage people to spend more by making them different colours and designs.
🎧 I'm sure when my parents bought their first fridge they had hardly any choice!
🎧 Yes, there's been quite a change.
🎧 Right, let's make a list of topics to cover in our presentation,
🎧 and decide who's going to do more research on them.
🎧 Then later, we can get together and plan the next step.
🎧 OK.
🎧 How about starting with how useful refrigeration is,
🎧 and the range of goods that are refrigerated nowadays?
🎧 Because of course it's not just food and drinks.
🎧 No, I suppose flowers and medicines are refrigerated, too.
🎧 And computers.
🎧 I could do that, unless you particularly want to.
🎧 No, that's fine by me.
🎧 What about the effects of refrigeration on people's health?
🎧 After all, some of the chemicals used in the 19th century were pretty harmful,
🎧 but there have been lots of benefits too,
🎧 like always having access to fresh food.
🎧 Do you fancy dealing with that?
🎧 I'm not terribly keen, to be honest.
🎧 Nor me.
🎧 My mind just goes blank when I read anything about chemicals.
🎧 Oh, all right then, I'll do you a favour.
🎧 But you owe me, Jack.
🎧 OK.
🎧 What about the effects on food producers,
🎧 like farmers in poorer countries being able to export their produce to developed countries?
🎧 Something for you, maybe?
🎧 I don't mind. It should be quite interesting.
🎧 I think we should also look at how refrigeration has helped whole cities - like Las Vegas,
🎧 which couldn't exist without refrigeration
🎧 because it's in the middle of a desert.
🎧 Right.
🎧 I had a quick look at an economics book in the library that's got a chapter about this sort of thing.
🎧 I could give you the title, if you want to do this section.
🎧 Not particularly, to be honest.
🎧 I find economics books pretty heavy going, as a rule.
🎧 OK, leave it to me, then.
🎧 Thanks.
🎧 Then there's transport,
🎧 and the difference that refrigerated trucks have made.
🎧 I wouldn't mind having a go at that.
🎧 Don't forget trains, too.
🎧 I read something about milk and butter being transported in refrigerated railroad cars in the USA,
🎧 right back in the 1840s.
🎧 I hadn't thought of trains. Thanks.
🎧 Shall we have a separate section on domestic fridges?
🎧 After all, they're something everyone's familiar with.
🎧 What about splitting it into two?
🎧 You could investigate 19th- and 20th-century fridges,
🎧 and I'll concentrate on what's available these days,
🎧 and how manufacturers differentiate their products from those of their competitors.
🎧 OK, that'd suit me.
🎧 
🎧 Hi everyone,
🎧 in this session I'll be presenting my research about the social history of Britain during the Industrial Revolution.
🎧 I particularly looked at how ordinary lives were affected by changes that happened at that time.
🎧 This was a time that saw the beginning of a new phenomenon; consumerism -
🎧 where buying and selling goods became a major part of ordinary people's lives.
🎧 In fact, it was in the 19th century that the quantity and quality of people's possessions
🎧 was used as an indication of the wealth of the country.
🎧 Before this, the vast majority of people had very few possessions,
🎧 but all that was changed by the Industrial Revolution.
🎧 This was the era from the mid-18th to the late 19th century,
🎧 when improvements in how goods were made
🎧 as well as in technology triggered massive social changes
🎧 that transformed life for just about everybody in several key areas.
🎧 First let's look at manufacturing.
🎧 When it comes to manufacturing,
🎧 we tend to think of the Industrial Revolution in images of steam engines and coal.
🎧 And it's true that the Industrial Revolution couldn't have taken place at all
🎧 if it weren't for these new sources of power.
🎧 They marked an important shift away from the traditional watermills and windmills
🎧 that had dominated before this.
🎧 The most advanced industry for much of the 19th century was textiles.
🎧 This meant that fashionable fabrics, and lace and ribbons were made available to everyone.
🎧 Before the Industrial Revolution, most people made goods to sell in small workshops,
🎧 often in their own homes.
🎧 But enormous new machines were now being created
🎧 that could produce the goods faster and on a larger scale,
🎧 and these required a lot more space.
🎧 So large factories were built,
🎧 replacing the workshops, and forcing workers to travel to work.
🎧 In fact, large numbers of people migrated from villages into towns as a result.
🎧 As well as manufacturing, there were new technologies in transport,
🎧 contributing to the growth of consumerism.
🎧 The horse-drawn stagecoaches and carts of the 18th century,
🎧 which carried very few people and goods,
🎧 and travelled slowly along poorly surfaced roads,
🎧 were gradually replaced by the numerous canals that were constructed.
🎧 These were particularly important for the transportation of goods.
🎧 The canals gradually fell out of use, though, as railways were developed,
🎧 becoming the main way of moving goods and people from one end of the country to the other.
🎧 And the goods they moved weren't just coal, iron, clothes, and so on -
🎧 significantly, they included newspapers,
🎧 which meant that thousands of people were not only more knowledgeable about what was going on in the country,
🎧 but could also read about what was available in the shops.
🎧 And that encouraged them to buy more.
🎧 so faster forms of transport resulted in distribution becoming far more efficient -
🎧 goods could now be sold all over the country, instead of just in the local market.
🎧 The third main area that saw changes that contributed to consumerism was retailing.
🎧 The number and quality of shops grew rapidly,
🎧 and in particular, small shops suffered as customers flocked to the growing number of department stores -
🎧 a form of retailing that was new in the 19th century.
🎧 The entrepreneurs who opened these found new ways to stock them with goods,
🎧 and to attract customers:
🎧 for instance, improved lighting inside greatly increased the visibility of the goods for sale.
🎧 Another development that made goods more visible from outside resulted from the use of plate glass,
🎧 which made it possible for windows to be much larger than previously.
🎧 New ways of promoting goods were introduced, too.
🎧 Previously, the focus had been on informing potential customers about the availability of goods;
🎧 now there was an explosion in advertising trying to persuade people to go shopping.
🎧 Flanders claims that one of the great effects of the Industrial Revolution was that it created choice.
🎧 All sorts of things that had previously been luxuries -
🎧 from sugar to cutlery - became conveniences,
🎧 and before long they'd turned into necessities:
🎧 life without sugar or cutlery was unimaginable.
🎧 Rather like mobile phones these days!
