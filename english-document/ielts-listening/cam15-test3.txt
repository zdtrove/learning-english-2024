🎧 Good morning.
🎧 Thanks for coming in to see us here at the agency, Joe.
🎧 I'm one of the agency representatives, and my name's Sally Baker.
🎧 Hi Sally. I think we spoke on the phone, didn't we?
🎧 That's right, we did.
🎧 So thank you for sending in your CV.
🎧 We've had quite a careful look at it
🎧 and I think we have two jobs that might be suitable for you.
🎧 OK.
🎧 The first one is in a company based in North London.
🎧 They're looking for an administrative assistant.
🎧 OK.
🎧 What sort of company is it?
🎧 They're called Home Solutions
🎧 and they design and make furniture.
🎧 Oh, I don't know much about that,
🎧 but it sounds interesting.
🎧 Yes, well as I said, they want someone in their office,
🎧 and looking at your past experience
🎧 it does look as if you fit quite a few of the requirements.
🎧 So on your CV it appears you've done some data entry?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 So that's one skill they want.
🎧 Then they expect the person they appoint to attend meetings and take notes there…
🎧 OK.
🎧 I've done that before, yes.
🎧 And you'd need to be able to cope with general admin.
🎧 Filing, and keeping records and so on?
🎧 That should be OK.
🎧 And in my last job I also had to manage the diary.
🎧 Excellent.
🎧 That's something they want here too.
🎧 I'd suggest you add it to your CV.
🎧 I don't think you mentioned that, did you?
🎧 No.
🎧 So as far as the requirements go, they want good computer skills, of course,
🎧 and they particularly mention spreadsheets.
🎧 That should be fine.
🎧 And interpersonal skills,
🎧 which would be something they'd check with your references.
🎧 I think that should be OK, yes.
🎧 Then they mention that they want someone who is careful and takes care with details.
🎧 Just looking at your CV, I'd say you're probably alright there.
🎧 I think so, yes.
🎧 Do they want any special experience?
🎧 I think they wanted some experience of teleconferencing.
🎧 I've got three years' experience of that.
🎧 Let's see, yes, good.
🎧 In fact they're only asking for at least one year, so that's great.
🎧 So is that something that might interest you?
🎧 It is, yes.
🎧 The only thing is, you said they were in North London
🎧 so it would be quite a long commute for me.
🎧 OK.
🎧 So the second position might suit you better as far as the location goes;
🎧 that's for a warehouse assistant and that's in South London.
🎧 Yes, that would be a lot closer.
🎧 And you've worked in a warehouse before, haven't you?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 So as far as the responsibilities for this position go,
🎧 they want someone who can manage the stock, obviously, and also deliveries.
🎧 That should be OK.
🎧 You've got to keep track of stuff,
🎧 but I've always been quite good with numbers.
🎧 Good, that's their first requirement.
🎧 And they want someone who's computer literate, which we know you are.
🎧 Sure.
🎧 Then they mention organisational skills.
🎧 They want someone who's well organised.
🎧 Yes, I think I am.
🎧 And tidy?
🎧 Yes, they go together really, don't they?
🎧 Sure.
🎧 Then the usual stuff; they want someone who can communicate well both orally and in writing.
🎧 OK.
🎧 And for the last warehouse job I had,
🎧 one of the things I enjoyed most was being part of a team.
🎧 I found that was really essential for the job.
🎧 Excellent.
🎧 Yes, they do mention that they want someone who's used to that, yes.
🎧 Now when you were working in a warehouse last time,
🎧 what sorts of items were you dealing with?
🎧 It was mostly bathroom and kitchen equipment,
🎧 sinks and stoves and fridges.
🎧 So you're OK moving heavy things?
🎧 Sure.
🎧 I'm quite strong, and I've had the training.
🎧 Good.
🎧 Now as far as experience goes, they mention they want someone with a licence,
🎧 and that you have experience of driving in London -
🎧 so you can cope with the traffic and so on.
🎧 Yes, no problem.
🎧 And you've got experience of warehouse work…
🎧 and the final thing they mention is customer service.
🎧 I think looking at your CV you're OK there.
🎧 Right.
🎧 So what about pay?
🎧 Can you tell me a bit more about that, please…
🎧 
🎧 My guest on the show today is Alice Riches
🎧 who started the Street Play Scheme where she lives in Beechwood Road.
🎧 For those of you that don't already know,
🎧 Street Play involves local residents closing off their street for a few hours
🎧 so that children have a chance to play in the street safely.
🎧 She started it in her own street, Beechwood Road,
🎧 and the idea caught on,
🎧 and there are now Street Play Schemes all over the city.
🎧 So when did you actually start the scheme, Alice?
🎧 Well, I first had the idea when my oldest child was still a toddler,
🎧 so that's about six years ago now,
🎧 but it took at least two years of campaigning before we were actually able to make it happen.
🎧 So the scheme's been up and running for three years now.
🎧 We'd love to be able to close our road for longer,
🎧 for the whole weekend, from Saturday morning until Sunday evening, for example.
🎧 At the moment it's just once a week.
🎧 But when we started it was only once a month.
🎧 But we're working on it.
🎧 So what actually happens when Beechwood Road is closed?
🎧 We have volunteer wardens,
🎧 mostly parents but some elderly residents too,
🎧 who block off our road at either end.
🎧 The council have provided special signs
🎧 but there's always a volunteer there to explain what's happening to any motorists.
🎧 Generally, they're fine about it,
🎧 we've only had to get the police involved once or twice.
🎧 Now I should explain that the road isn't completely closed to cars.
🎧 But only residents' cars are allowed.
🎧 If people really need to get in or out of Beechwood Road,
🎧 it's not a problem,
🎧 as long as they drive at under 20 kilometres per hour.
🎧 But most people just decide not to use their cars during this time,
🎧 or they park in another street.
🎧 The wardens are only there to stop through traffic.
🎧 So can anyone apply to get involved in Street Play?
🎧 Absolutely!
🎧 We want to include all kids in the city,
🎧 especially those who live on busy roads.
🎧 It's here that demand is greatest.
🎧 Obviously, there isn't such demand in wealthier areas
🎧 where the children have access to parks or large gardens,
🎧 or in the suburbs where there are usually more places for children to play outside.
🎧 I'd recommend that anyone listening who likes the idea should just give it a go.
🎧 We've been surprised by the positive reaction of residents all over the city.
🎧 And that's not just parents.
🎧 There are always a few who complain but they're a tiny minority.
🎧 On the whole everyone is very supportive
🎧 and say they're very happy to see children out on the street,
🎧 even if it does get quite noisy.
🎧 There have been so many benefits of Street Play for the kids.
🎧 Parents really like the fact that the kids are getting fresh air
🎧 instead of sitting staring at a computer screen,
🎧 even if they're not doing anything particularly energetic.
🎧 And of course it's great that kids can play with their friends outside without being supervised by their parents,
🎧 but for me the biggest advantage is that kids develop confidence in themselves to be outside without their parents.
🎧 The other really fantastic thing is that children get to know the adults in the street,
🎧 it's like having a big extended family.
🎧 It certainly does have a lot of benefits.
🎧 I want to move on now and ask you about a related project in King Street.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Well this was an experiment I was involved in
🎧 where local residents decided to try and reduce the traffic along King Street,
🎧 which is the busiest main road in our area,
🎧 by persuading people not to use their cars for one day.
🎧 We thought about making people pay more for parking,
🎧 but we decided that would be really unpopular,
🎧 so instead we just stopped people from parking on King Street
🎧 but left the other car parks open.
🎧 It was surprising how much of a difference all this made.
🎧 As we'd predicted, air quality was significantly better
🎧 but what I hadn't expected was how much quieter it would be,
🎧 even with the buses still running.
🎧 Of course everyone said they felt safer
🎧 but we were actually amazed that sales in the shops went up considerably that day,
🎧 we thought there'd be fewer people out shopping, not more.
🎧 That's really interesting...
🎧 
🎧 Tom, could I ask you for some advice, please?
🎧 Yes of course, if you think I can help.
🎧 What's it about?
🎧 It's my first media studies assignment, and I'm not sure how to go about it.
🎧 You must have done it last year.
🎧 Is that the one comparing the coverage of a particular story in a range of newspapers?
🎧 That's right.
🎧 Oh yes, I really enjoyed writing it.
🎧 So what sort of things do I need to compare?
🎧 Well, there are several things.
🎧 For example, there's the question of which page of the newspaper the item appears on.
🎧 You mean, because there's a big difference between having it on the front page and the bottom of page ten, for instance?
🎧 Exactly.
🎧 And that shows how important the editor thinks the story is.
🎧 Then there's the size:
🎧 how many column inches the story is given,
🎧 how many columns it spreads over.
🎧 And I suppose that includes the headline.
🎧 It certainly does.
🎧 It's all part of attracting the reader's attention.
🎧 What about graphics -
🎧 whether there's anything visual in addition to the text?
🎧 Yes, you need to consider those, too,
🎧 because they can have a big effect on the reader's understanding of the story -
🎧 sometimes a bigger effect than the text itself.
🎧 Then you'll need to look at how the item is put together:
🎧 what structure is it given?
🎧 Bear in mind that not many people read beyond the first paragraph,
🎧 so what has the journalist put at the beginning?
🎧 And if, say, there are conflicting opinions about something,
🎧 does one appear near the end, where people probably won't read it?
🎧 And newspapers sometimes give wrong or misleading information, don't they?
🎧 Either deliberately or by accident.
🎧 Should I be looking at that, too?
🎧 Yes, if you can.
🎧 Compare what's in different versions, and as far as possible,
🎧 try and work out what's true and what isn't.
🎧 And that relates to a very important point:
🎧 what's the writer's purpose,
🎧 or at least the most important one, if they have several.
🎧 It may seem to be to inform the public,
🎧 but often it's that they want to create fear, or controversy,
🎧 or to make somebody look ridiculous.
🎧 Gosh, I see what you mean.
🎧 I suppose the writer may make assumptions about the reader.
🎧 That's right - about their knowledge of the subject, their attitudes, and their level of education,
🎧 which means writing so that the readers understand without feeling patronised.
🎧 All of that will make a difference to how the story is presented.
🎧 Does it matter what type of story I write about?
🎧 No, national or international politics, the arts… anything,
🎧 as long as it's covered in two or three newspapers.
🎧 Though of course it'll be easier and more fun if it's something you're interested in and know something about.
🎧 And on that basis a national news item would be worth analysing -
🎧 I'm quite keen on politics, so I'll try and find a suitable topic.
🎧 What did you choose for your analysis, Tom?
🎧 I was interested in how newspapers express their opinions explicitly,
🎧 so I wanted to compare editorials in different papers,
🎧 but when I started looking,
🎧 I couldn't find two on the same topic that I felt like analysing.
🎧 In that case, I won't even bother to look.
🎧 So in the end I chose a human interest story -
🎧 a terribly emotional story about a young girl who was very ill,
🎧 and lots of other people - mostly strangers -
🎧 raised money so she could go abroad for treatment.
🎧 Actually, I was surprised -
🎧 some papers just wrote about how wonderful everyone was,
🎧 but others considered the broader picture,
🎧 like why treatment wasn't available here.
🎧 Hmm, I usually find stories like that raise quite strong feelings in me!
🎧 I'll avoid that.
🎧 Perhaps I'll choose an arts topic,
🎧 like different reviews of a film, or something about funding for the arts -
🎧 I'll think about that.
🎧 Yes, that might be interesting.
🎧 OK, well thanks a lot for your help, Tom. It's been really useful.
🎧 You're welcome.
🎧 Good luck with the assignment, Hazel.
🎧 
🎧 Nowadays, we use different products for personal cleanliness, laundry, dishwashing and household cleaning,
🎧 but this is very much a 20th-century development.
🎧 The origins of cleanliness date back to prehistoric times.
🎧 Since water is essential for life,
🎧 the earliest people lived near water and knew something about its cleansing properties -
🎧 at least that it rinsed mud off their hands.
🎧 During the excavation of ancient Babylon,
🎧 evidence was found that soapmaking was known as early as 2800 BC.
🎧 Archaeologists discovered cylinders made of clay,
🎧 with inscriptions on them saying that fats were boiled with ashes.
🎧 This is a method of making soap,
🎧 though there's no reference to the purpose of this material.
🎧 The early Greeks bathed for aesthetic reasons and apparently didn't use soap.
🎧 Instead, they cleaned their bodies with blocks of sand, pumice and ashes,
🎧 then anointed themselves with oil,
🎧 and scraped off the oil and dirt with a metal instrument known as a strigil.
🎧 They also used oil mixed with ashes.
🎧 Clothes were washed without soap in streams.
🎧 The ancient Germans and Gauls are also credited with discovering how to make a substance called 'soap',
🎧 made of melted animal fat and ashes.
🎧 They used this mixture to tint their hair red.
🎧 Soap got its name, according to an ancient Roman legend, from Mount Sapo,
🎧 where animals were sacrificed, leaving deposits of animal fat.
🎧 Rain washed these deposits, along with wood ashes,
🎧 down into the clay soil along the River Tiber.
🎧 Women found that this mixture greatly reduced the effort required to wash their clothes.
🎧 As Roman civilisation advanced, so did bathing.
🎧 The first of the famous Roman baths, supplied with water from their aqueducts,
🎧 was built around 312 BC.
🎧 The baths were luxurious, and bathing became very popular.
🎧 And by the second century AD,
🎧 the Greek physician Galen recommended soap for both medicinal and cleansing purposes.
🎧 After the fall of Rome in 467 AD
🎧 and the resulting decline in bathing habits,
🎧 much of Europe felt the impact of filth on public health.
🎧 This lack of personal cleanliness and related unsanitary living conditions
🎧 were major factors in the outbreaks of disease in the Middle Ages,
🎧 and especially the Black Death of the 14th century.
🎧 Nevertheless, soapmaking became an established craft in Europe,
🎧 and associations of soapmakers guarded their trade secrets closely.
🎧 Vegetable and animal oils were used with ashes of plants,
🎧 along with perfume, apparently for the first time.
🎧 Gradually more varieties of soap became available for shaving and shampooing,
🎧 as well as bathing and laundering.
🎧 A major step toward large-scale commercial soapmaking occurred in 1791,
🎧 when a French chemist, Nicholas Leblanc, patented a process for turning salt into soda ash,
🎧 or sodium carbonate.
🎧 Soda ash is the alkali obtained from ashes that combines with fat to form soap.
🎧 The Leblanc process yielded quantities of good-quality, inexpensive soda ash.
🎧 Modern soapmaking was born some 20 years later,
🎧 in the early 19th century,
🎧 with the discovery by Michel Eugene Chevreul, another French chemist,
🎧 of the chemical nature and relationship of fats, glycerine and fatty acids.
🎧 His studies established the basis for both fat and soap chemistry,
🎧 and soapmaking became a science.
🎧 Further developments during the 19th century made it easier and cheaper to manufacture soap.
🎧 Until the 19th century, soap was regarded as a luxury item,
🎧 and was heavily taxed in several countries.
🎧 As it became more readily available, it became an everyday necessity,
🎧 a development that was reinforced when the high tax was removed.
🎧 Soap was then something ordinary people could afford,
🎧 and cleanliness standards improved.
🎧 With this widespread use came the development of milder soaps for bathing
🎧 and soaps for use in the washing machines that were available to consumers by the turn of the 20th century.
