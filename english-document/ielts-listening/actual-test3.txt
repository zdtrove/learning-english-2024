🎧 Hello. Is this the Triple A Employment agency?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 Hi. I rang before. My name's Andrew. Andrew Peterson.
🎧 I rang you earlier and gave you my personal details.
🎧 If you remember, I'm that student looking for work during the summer holidays.
🎧 Oh, sure. Actually, I have your file right here.
🎧 But... we still need to add some further information.
🎧 Yeah, that's what they told me, and that's why I'm ringing.
🎧 What do you need to know?
🎧 Well, we have to know your main level of education. It's a degree, I suppose.
🎧 Yes, but I'm still doing it, in engineering. It's quite interesting.
🎧 Some of my friends are studying computing though, so I'm interested in that, also.
🎧 Well, I'll just write in your main degree subject. Engineering.
🎧 We usually have a demand in computing though.
🎧 Have you worked with computers before?
🎧 No. I just do some programming for fun at the university,
🎧 but I almost got a job as a computer designer once.
🎧 Actually, the only job I've ever had was as a car salesman, believe it or not.
🎧 Well, at least you've had experience dealing with customers.
🎧 What about hobbies though?
🎧 Sometimes they can help develop useful skills.
🎧 Ummm... in my free time I don't do much - mostly study.
🎧 I play chess occasionally at the university chess club.
🎧 That's right next to the tennis courts,
🎧 but I'm not interested in that.
🎧 Chess helps develop analytical skills, so I'll put that down.
🎧 Of course, it's your main skills that employers want to know about
🎧 What would you say they are?
🎧 Well, I'm in my third year now, studying electrical machines and generating systems,
🎧 but I'd say electronics is my best skill
🎧 much better than, say, my machine skills, which aren't so good, actually.
🎧 Okay... machine skills are in demand, but so too are electronic ones,
🎧 so we might be able to find you a part-time job in that field.
🎧 But what sort of money do you expect to get?
🎧 Oh, anything really.
🎧 I'd want the standard payment, let's say.
🎧 What's normal? 1,000 a month? 1,500?
🎧 I'll just put $1,200, okay?
🎧 That's fine by me.
🎧 When can you start? Say, within two days?
🎧 Easily! Actually, less.
🎧 In fact, just give me a ring, and I'll be able to start immediately,
🎧 although I admit it'll take me a few days to get used to getting up early in the morning.
🎧 Okay! That's just about it,
🎧 unless you'd like to add anything else which may help with your application?
🎧 Ah, not really.
🎧 I ride a motorbike, but that's unimportant.
🎧 I'm friendly, but every applicant claims that, right?
🎧 I can speak another language.
🎧 Ah, that might be useful, depending on the language.
🎧 Is it Chinese? A Chinese speaker would go down well.
🎧 Spanish, I'm afraid.
🎧 You see, I grew up with some friends who came from South America.
🎧 Okay, I'll write that down, but I don't think it will help that much, sorry to say.
🎧 Well, thanks for your help, and hopefully I'll get a job soon,
🎧 but can I just ask one more question?
🎧 Sure!
🎧 What, basically, are employers looking for when they interview someone?
🎧 Oh, many things.
🎧 Being hardworking, diligent, and focused on your job is good,
🎧 but surprisingly, it often means you can't see the bigger picture,
🎧 or provide suggestions which help the company move forward.
🎧 That requires thinking for yourself, outside the box as they say,
🎧 and being free of the standard ways of approaching tasks.
🎧 Employers certainly value that.
🎧 I guess experience must help, though?
🎧 It depends. If it involved a routine job, one which didn't exercise your mind,
🎧 it might not mean that much at all.
🎧 But since companies are basically composed of people,
🎧 it is important to be able to get along with others.
🎧 There's no point in hiring someone whom the other employees don't like, right?
🎧 That just causes problems,
🎧 in fact, I would say that being friendly and approachable ranks far more highly than your academic qualifications.
🎧 Okay, and that's all assessed at the interview, right?
🎧 Yes, and your qualifications, experience, and approach to the job,
🎧 such as whether you can do different things, work overtime, or do long hours as needed.
🎧 But those latter qualities are pretty much standard.
🎧 What may be more important is based on the fact that things inevitably go wrong.
🎧 Mistakes are made, and someone's got to fix them in a way that creates the least disturbance.
🎧 People with demonstrated abilities to do this are certainly regarded highly.
🎧 I see. That's very interesting!
🎧 
🎧 Hello everyone, and welcome to the "Fit for Life" Health Centre,
🎧 a place which, as the name suggests, is not just for short-term solutions,
🎧 but rather, intends to put you on a sensible and achievable footing for the rest of your life.
🎧 And that's how we're different.
🎧 For example, we could immediately put you on a harsh exercise program,
🎧 expecting you to work out every day, but such a plan would see you quickly lose interest.
🎧 That's why the initial step is a one-and-a-half-hour consultation,
🎧 in which your lifestyle, current situation, and long-term goals, are all thoroughly analysed.
🎧 Now, an important part of this consultation involves analysing what you eat.
🎧 There's no point exercising here, and losing weight, then putting it all back on, later.
🎧 You will need to show self-control and discipline in your diet, and we'll work on that.
🎧 Similarly, we'll put you on an exercise regime suitable for your level of fitness,
🎧 so that will involve a test, where we will take you through some activities,
🎧 then measure your heart rate and blood pressure to determine how fit you are.
🎧 This will be monitored during every subsequent consultation,
🎧 along with your exercise schedule,
🎧 and that occurs monthly, and not half-yearly, as with many other centres.
🎧 As to our actual exercise machines and programs,
🎧 you will have to decide whether it is muscle mass,
🎧 stamina, or general fitness, that you want to develop.
🎧 Think about which of these three you want to target,
🎧 and we'll design a specific program for you,
🎧 but remember, bulging muscles aren't necessarily suitable for everyone.
🎧 Sometimes it's better to think in terms of two simple concepts:
🎧 muscle definition and stamina;
🎧 or, if you are female, being fit and healthy, in both mind and body.
🎧 Now, if you're going to work out at this gym,
🎧 you'll need to think about your reasons for exercising,
🎧 so let's consider that in more detail.
🎧 Muscle mass is certainly popular with the guys, probably seeking, to impress the girls,
🎧 and with muscles comes the confidence to do that, right?
🎧 Well, for that, you'll need our high-stress weight units, where pumping iron is all the rage.
🎧 Moving on to other benefits, one of the main ones is beating the tension of life, right,
🎧 and the longer the exercise is, the greater the rewards in this respect.
🎧 Thus, playing squash can certainly help, and so can swimming,
🎧 but what's much better, as every jogger will tell you, is their activity,
🎧 so we have ample jogging machines, and they're always popular.
🎧 They can provide good fitness too, as can the yoga classes;
🎧 however, again, let's not forget playing squash,
🎧 which, I would say, is the optimum way to improve your general wellbeing.
🎧 Such an active, energetic game, plus the competitive element,
🎧 drives you forward into high levels of health and fitness.
🎧 These, of course, are the ultimate purposes of being here,
🎧 but remember, the centre is full of like-minded people,
🎧 all of whom are interesting to meet, and valuable sources of information.
🎧 The yoga classes have a pre- and post-meeting session,
🎧 so you'll certainly meet others there,
🎧 although they'll all be yoga enthusiasts,
🎧 which limits the range somewhat.
🎧 But whether doing yoga, swimming, or exercising, everyone showers, right,
🎧 so those facilities are where you'll hear all sorts of interesting conversations, and really get to know people
🎧 not like the front-desk area,
🎧 which is mostly empty as patrons go immediately inside to do their exercise.
🎧 Of course, the front desk can answer all your questions,
🎧 and has information brochures, and such like,
🎧 but for knowing more about a greater variety of subjects and community concerns,
🎧 look at the notice board in the yoga studio,
🎧 where there's a huge array of papers, leaflets, and articles, all for you to read and consider.
🎧 
🎧 Okay, we've got to decide who to promote to Leading Education Officer.
🎧 Someone from the arts faculty, I suppose.
🎧 Well, it can be from any faculty, since the position requires more general skills:
🎧 handling personnel, settling disputes, and motivating them to focus on the task.
🎧 It was the last position which involved computer knowledge, not this one.
🎧 Surely computer knowledge would help.
🎧 So too would knowledge in the arts.
🎧 Sure, it would help, but the key criterion is being able to direct the staff appropriately.
🎧 So, it doesn't matter then from which faculty we select our candidates?
🎧 Not really, but I've already looked at those from computing, and rejected them all.
🎧 Why?
🎧 They're all too new, lacking in sufficient experience,
🎧 whereas these ones from the business faculty are longtimers,
🎧 so we'll take someone from there.
🎧 I suppose you're right.
🎧 The arts faculty doesn't present much in the way of suitable candidates either.
🎧 But we'll still have to train the person - teach the ropes, as they say.
🎧 And he or she will have to expect to do overtime, as needed.
🎧 Of course. It can get so busy that, if we were open on the weekend,
🎧 they'd have to work then as well.
🎧 Just as well we're a Monday to Friday university, right?
🎧 Right!
🎧 But are you sure these people will actually want the job?
🎧 The salary isn't such an improvement on their current ones.
🎧 I know, but there are benefits.
🎧 You get overtime rates, a nice place to put your car,
🎧 as well as additional petrol money if you drive for company purposes,
🎧 which they'll probably be required to do.
🎧 But those benefits are quite limited,
🎧 especially given all the work and responsibility involved.
🎧 People often don't like that.
🎧 They prefer the creative freedom of less-senior teaching positions.
🎧 Yeah I know,
🎧 but these candidates should realise that if they do this job well, there'll be more promotions down the line.
🎧 you know how everyone likes having their own office, right?
🎧 Sure.
🎧 Well, that would come after a few years,
🎧 if they're prepared to work hard and grow with the university.
🎧 Yes, that should attract these people.
🎧 Well, that's enough talk about the job.
🎧 What about the actual candidates?
🎧 How many do we have?
🎧 Ah, I've narrowed it down to four...
🎧 ah, just using their first names, that's Steven, Abdul, Lek, and Oscar.
🎧 As you said, there's quite a bit of experience between them, about 34 years in all.
🎧 What's the exact breakdown of figures?
🎧 Abdul and Steven both have seven years,
🎧 Lek has one more, and Oscar is the most experienced, at 12.
🎧 But who's the most qualified?
🎧 Steven and Abdul have an MBA
🎧 sorry! Abdul's got something called a M.B.P.
🎧 some foreign thing which translates as Master of Business Practice.
🎧 I'm not sure what that is, but does he do the job well?
🎧 Very well, apparently
🎧 better than Lek and Oscar, who hold a degree and some certificates, respectively.
🎧 But we have to think about any drawbacks,
🎧 y'know, possible issues with any of them.
🎧 I asked their respective deans for feedback, and I found out that Steven, the younger one, drinks a bit.
🎧 So, he has a problem with alcohol?
🎧 No, he never drinks to excess,
🎧 but at the bar he's often expressed his intention of moving on, of teaching abroad.
🎧 Ah, he's not stable.
🎧 Not stable at all, apparently.
🎧 We'll never know for how long he'll hold the job.
🎧 We need stable personnel,
🎧 and people without family problems, or sick relatives, like the last guy we promoted.
🎧 What about Abdul then? Will he do?
🎧 He might do, except his English language ability is limited.
🎧 It's functional, but a bit broken, and meaning is sometimes lost.
🎧 That's not the problem with the next candidate, Lek, who has good language ability,
🎧 but this job involves handling people,
🎧 and his dean says Lek's attitude is bad.
🎧 In what way?
🎧 His manners are okay, and he's interested in his job,
🎧 but he believes there should always be adequate leisure in life.
🎧 He definitely won't work overtime and complains a lot already about his job,
🎧 but this last candidate, Oscar, is probably not the right one, either.
🎧 Why not?
🎧 Not another problem with language?
🎧 His first language isn't English, but he speaks it well enough.
🎧 He's stable, with a good attitude, but his age is the problem.
🎧 Age is not a problem. That would be ageism, and I don't believe in that.
🎧 But with his age comes health problems as well,
🎧 and serious one is that.
🎧 Oh, that might be an issue then.
🎧 
🎧 If there is one natural feature which has long fascinated man, it is caves
🎧 those natural underground spaces into which people can enter.
🎧 No known cave in the world can exist without it being extensively explored,
🎧 whether it be in remote areas, such as the Clearwater Cave in Borneo,
🎧 or immensely long and difficult, such as Mammoth Cave in America,
🎧 or perhaps the most challenging: those caves below the water table, full with water,
🎧 in which case the exploration is known as cave diving.
🎧 Whatever the case, if the caves are known,
🎧 as complex and difficult as they usually are, they will be explored.
🎧 The formal name for the study of caves is speleology,
🎧 and involves many disciplines, such as chemistry,
🎧 geology, biology, and cartography,
🎧 or the science of making accurate maps,
🎧 since the largest caves can be hundreds of kilometers long and highly complicated.
🎧 If the exploration is just for fun, the activity is known as caving,
🎧 but with the difficulties and dangers involved,
🎧 the average caver is often involved with one of these speleological sciences.
🎧 As for the number of caves in the world,
🎧 research suggests that only a fraction have been found and documented,
🎧 mostly in the areas in which caving has long been a popular activity,
🎧 such as in America, France, or Australia.
🎧 China, for example, has huge areas of limestone bedrock,
🎧 prime material for cave formation,
🎧 and logically must contain among the largest number of caves in the world,
🎧 yet only few are documented due to the lack of interest in caving there.
🎧 Thus, as exploration continues, new caves will be discovered,
🎧 and it is likely that the numbers could radically change in the future.
🎧 With caves being such mysterious and intriguing places,
🎧 the obvious question concerns how they form.
🎧 The most common cause is the effect of slightly acidic water
🎧 in a process called 'dissolution'.
🎧 Here, water seeps into the ground, and down through rock masses.
🎧 If this rock is soluble, the water dissolves some of it,
🎧 and over time, the passage expands to become a cave, or cave system.
🎧 The largest and most common of these involves limestone,
🎧 although other materials are possible, including gypsum, marble, and even salt.
🎧 Now, if the cave is formed at the same time as the rock, it is called a primary cave,
🎧 and the most common of these are lava tubes.
🎧 When lava from volcanoes flows downhill,
🎧 the topmost surface cools and solidifies first,
🎧 leaving the hotter lava to continue to flow beneath.
🎧 If most of this eventually flows out, a hollow tube is left.
🎧 The country Iceland, has some excellent caves of this type,
🎧 and even far-flung Australia has a few.
🎧 Finally, there are sea caves, formed from waves pounding into coastal cliffs,
🎧 and eroding into fault lines, or softer rock.
🎧 These caves are usually the shortest, about 50 meters at most,
🎧 since the erosive action of the waves can only reach a certain distance.
🎧 However, it is limestone caves which will always be the most interesting.
🎧 This is due to the presence of limestone formations.
🎧 As the groundwater seeps downward through the ceiling of the caves,
🎧 it encounters a different pressure and temperature,
🎧 causing it to deposit a small amount of its dissolved calcium carbonate.
🎧 Over time, through the action of millions of drops,
🎧 this deposition process results in ever- growing masses,
🎧 known as stalactites (if hanging from the ceiling),
🎧 or stalagmites (if growing from the floor).
🎧 Alternatively, the water may flow over a large surface of rock, forming flowstone,
🎧 and with other sorts of processes,
🎧 can result in beautiful milky-white formations of astonishing complexity.
🎧 One of the best examples of this,
🎧 as well as of what surprising discoveries may yet await,
🎧 is the Lechuguilla Cave in New Mexico.
🎧 In the 1950s, some cavers heard the sound of wind underneath some large boulders on the cave floor,
🎧 a clear sign of a deeper passageway.
🎧 It took until 1984 for a group of cavers to gain permission to start digging,
🎧 and two years later, in 1986,
🎧 they broke through into a walkable passageway,
🎧 unlocking one of the longest cave systems in the world,
🎧 the deepest in America,
🎧 and some of the most beautiful formations ever found.
🎧 Unusually, many of these were yellow with sulphur,
🎧 suggesting that the caves were a result of hydrogen-sulfide from nearby oil deposits.
🎧 This was forced through fracture lines,
🎧 combining with existing groundwater to form sulfuric acid,
🎧 dissolving the limestone from the bottom up,
🎧 instead of the normal top-down seepage which characterises most limestone cave formations.
