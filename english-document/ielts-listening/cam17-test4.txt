🎧 Hello, Easy Life Cleaning Services, Jacinta speaking.
🎧 Oh hello.
🎧 I'm looking for a cleaning service for my apartment,
🎧 do you do domestic cleaning?
🎧 Sure.
🎧 Well, it's just a one-bedroom flat.
🎧 Do you have a basic cleaning package?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 For a one-bedroom flat we're probably looking at about two hours for a clean.
🎧 So we'd do a thorough clean of all surfaces in each room,
🎧 and polish them where necessary.
🎧 Does your apartment have carpets?
🎧 No, I don't have any, but the floor would need cleaning.
🎧 Of course, we'd do that in every room.
🎧 And we'd do a thorough clean of the kitchen and bathroom.
🎧 OK.
🎧 Then we have some additional services which you can request if you want,
🎧 so for example, we can clean your oven for you every week.
🎧 Actually, I hardly ever use that,
🎧 but can you do the fridge?
🎧 Sure.
🎧 Would you like that done every week?
🎧 Yes, definitely.
🎧 And would ironing clothes be an additional service you can do?
🎧 Yes, of course.
🎧 It wouldn't be much, just my shirts for work that week.
🎧 That's fine.
🎧 And we could also clean your microwave if you want.
🎧 No, I wipe that out pretty regularly so there's no need for that.
🎧 We also offer additional services that you might want a bit less often, say every month.
🎧 So for example, if the inside of your windows need cleaning, we could do that.
🎧 Yes, that'd be good.
🎧 I'm on the fifteenth floor, so the outside gets done regularly by specialists,
🎧 but the inside does get a bit grubby.
🎧 And we could arrange for your curtains to get cleaned if necessary.
🎧 No, they're OK.
🎧 But would you be able to do something about the balcony?
🎧 It's quite small and I don't use it much,
🎧 but it could do with a wash every month or so.
🎧 Yes, we can get the pressure washer onto that.
🎧 Now if you're interested,
🎧 we do offer some other possibilities to do with general maintenance.
🎧 For example, if you have a problem with water and you need a plumber in a hurry,
🎧 we can put you in touch with a reliable one who can come out straightaway.
🎧 And the same thing if you need an electrician.
🎧 Right. That's good to know.
🎧 I've only just moved here so I don't have any of those sorts of contacts.
🎧 And I don't know if this is of interest to you,
🎧 but we also offer a special vacuum cleaning system
🎧 which can improve the indoor air quality of your home by capturing up to 99% of all the dust in the air.
🎧 So if you're troubled by allergies, this can make a big difference.
🎧 Right. In fact, I don't have that sort of problem, but I'll bear it in mind.
🎧 Now can you tell me a bit about your cleaning staff?
🎧 Of course.
🎧 So all our cleaners are very carefully selected.
🎧 When they apply to us, they have to undergo a security check with the police
🎧 to make sure they don't have any sort of criminal background,
🎧 and, of course, they have to provide references as well.
🎧 Then if we think they might be suitable for the job, we give them training for it.
🎧 That lasts for two weeks so it's very thorough,
🎧 and at the end of it, they have a test.
🎧 If they pass that, we take them on,
🎧 but we monitor them very carefully,
🎧 we ask all our clients to complete a review of their performance after every visit and to email it to us.
🎧 So we can pick up any problems straightaway and deal with them.
🎧 OK, well that all sounds good.
🎧 And will I always have the same cleaner?
🎧 Yes, we do our best to organise it that way, and we usually manage it.
🎧 Good. That's fine.
🎧 Right, so I'd like to go ahead and...
🎧 
🎧 As many of you here today have worked in the hotel industry for some time,
🎧 I'm sure you have experienced the problem of high staff turnover in your hotels.
🎧 Every hotel relies on having loyal and experienced members of staff
🎧 who make sure that everything runs smoothly.
🎧 If staff are constantly changing,
🎧 it can make life difficult for everyone.
🎧 But why do staff leave frequently in many hotels?
🎧 Of course, many hotel jobs, such as cleaning, are low-skilled and are not well-paid.
🎧 A lot of managers think it's this and the long hours that are the main causes of high staff turnover -
🎧 but what they don't realise is that it's the lack of training in many hotel jobs which is a huge factor.
🎧 So, what kind of problems does a high turnover of staff cause?
🎧 Well, having to recruit new staff all the time can be very time-consuming,
🎧 and managers may have to cover some duties while waiting for new staff to arrive.
🎧 This means they don't have time to think about less immediate problems
🎧 such as how to improve their service.
🎧 When staff leave, it can also severely affect the colleagues they leave behind.
🎧 It has a negative effect on remaining staff,
🎧 who may start to feel that they too should be thinking about leaving.
🎧 So, what can be done to change this situation?
🎧 Firstly, managers should stop making basic errors
🎧 which leave their staff feeling upset and resentful.
🎧 When organising shifts, for example,
🎧 make sure you never give certain staff preferential treatment.
🎧 All staff should be given some choice about when they work,
🎧 and everyone should have to work some evening and weekend shifts.
🎧 If you treat staff fairly,
🎧 they'll be more likely to step in and help when extra staff are needed.
🎧 Keeping staff happy has other tangible benefits for the business.
🎧 Take the Dunwich Hotel as an example.
🎧 It had been experiencing a problem with staff complaints
🎧 and in order to deal with this,
🎧 invested in staff training
🎧 and improved staff conditions.
🎧 Not only did the level of complaints fall,
🎧 but they also noticed a significant increase in the amount each customer spent during their stay.
🎧 They have now introduced a customer loyalty scheme
🎧 which is going really well.
🎧 Now I'd like to look at some ways you can reduce staff turnover in your hotels,
🎧 and I'll do this by giving some examples of hotels where I've done some training recently.
🎧 The Sun Club received feedback which showed that staff thought managers didn't value their opinions.
🎧 They weren't made to feel they were partners who were contributing to the success of the business as a whole.
🎧 This situation has changed.
🎧 Junior staff at all levels are regularly invited to meetings where their ideas are welcomed.
🎧 A year ago, The Portland recognised the need to invest in staff retention.
🎧 Their first step was to introduce a scheme for recognising talent amongst their employees.
🎧 The hope is that organising training for individuals with management potential will encourage them to stay with the business.
🎧 At Bluewater, managers decided to recognise 50 high achievers from across the company's huge hotel chain.
🎧 As a reward, they're sent on an all-expenses-paid trip abroad every year.
🎧 Fun is an important element in the trips,
🎧 but there's also the opportunity to learn something useful.
🎧 This year's trip included a visit to a brewery,
🎧 where staff learned about the new beer that would be served in the hotel.
🎧 Pentlow Hotels identified that retention of junior reception staff was an issue.
🎧 In order to encourage them to see that working in a hotel could be worthwhile and rewarding, with good prospects,
🎧 they introduced a management programme.
🎧 These staff were given additional responsibilities and the chance to work in various roles in the hotel.
🎧 Green Planets wanted to be seen as a caring employer.
🎧 To make life easier for staff, many of whom had childcare responsibilities,
🎧 the hotel began issuing vouchers to help cover the cost of childcare.
🎧 Louise Marsh at The Amesbury has one of the best staff retention rates in the business.
🎧 Since she joined the company,
🎧 she's made a huge effort to achieve this by creating a co-operative and supportive environment.
🎧 For her, the staff are part of a large family where everyone is valued.
🎧 OK, now I'd like to...
🎧 
🎧 Hi Thomas, how are you enjoying the course so far?
🎧 Yeah, I think it's good.
🎧 Remind me, why did you decide to study sports science?
🎧 Didn't you want to be a professional athlete when you were at school?
🎧 Yeah, that was my goal,
🎧 and all my classmates assumed I would achieve it; they thought I was brilliant.
🎧 That must have been a nice feeling.
🎧 Mm, I thought I could win anything.
🎧 There was no one who could run faster than me.
🎧 Exactly, so what happened?
🎧 Did your mum and dad want you to be more 'academic'?
🎧 Not at all.
🎧 Perhaps they should have pushed me harder, though.
🎧 What do you mean?
🎧 I think I should have practised more.
🎧 What makes you say that?
🎧 Well, I went out to Kenya for a couple of weeks to train...
🎧 Really! I didn't know that.
🎧 I was chosen to go there out of loads of kids and run with some of the top teenage athletes in the world.
🎧 And... I was so calm about it.
🎧 I just kept thinking how fortunate I was.
🎧 What a great chance this was!
🎧 Everyone back home was so proud of me.
🎧 But once we started competing, I very quickly realised I wasn't good enough.
🎧 That must have been a huge shock.
🎧 I thought 'this can't be happening'!
🎧 I was used to winning.
🎧 I'm sorry to hear that.
🎧 It's OK.
🎧 I'm over it now
🎧 and I think it's much better to do a university course
🎧 and this one has such a variety of sports-related areas.
🎧 It's going to be good.
🎧 Oh, I agree, I chose it because of that.
🎧 So Jeanne, have you thought of any ideas for the discussion session next week on technology and sport?
🎧 We have to cover more than one sport, don't we?
🎧 Yeah.
🎧 You know, we always think technology is about the future,
🎧 but we could gather some ideas about past developments in sport.
🎧 Look at early types of equipment perhaps?
🎧 I remember reading something about table tennis bats once,
🎧 how they ended up being covered with pimpled rubber.
🎧 Cos they were just wooden at first, I'd imagine.
🎧 Yeah.
🎧 In about the 1920s,
🎧 a factory was making rolls of the rubber in bulk for something like horse harnesses.
🎧 Really!
🎧 Yeah, and someone realised that it would make a perfect covering for the wooden bats.
🎧 So what about cricket,
🎧 that's had a few innovative changes.
🎧 Maybe the pads they wear on their legs?
🎧 I don't think they've changed much but, I'm just looking on the internet...
🎧 and it says that when the first cricket helmet came in, in 1978,
🎧 the Australian batsman who first wore it was booed and jeered by people watching because it was so ugly!
🎧 Wow, players have to protect themselves from getting hurt!
🎧 I mean everyone wears one now.
🎧 Mm, unlike the cycle helmet.
🎧 Well, unless you're a professional,
🎧 but you're right, many ordinary bikers don't wear a helmet.
🎧 Hey, look at these pictures of original helmet designs.
🎧 This one looks like an upside-down bowl!
🎧 Yet, the woman's laughing,
🎧 she's so proud to be wearing it!
🎧 It says serious cyclists ended up with wet hair from all the hard exercise.
🎧 I guess that's why they have large air vents in them now
🎧 so that the skin can breathe more easily.
🎧 OK, so we've done helmets.
🎧 What about golf balls or better still golf clubs,
🎧 they've changed a lot.
🎧 Yeah, I remember my great grandfather telling me that because a club was made entirely of wood,
🎧 it would easily break and players had to get another.
🎧 There's no wood at all in them now, is there?
🎧 No, they're much more powerful.
🎧 The same must be true of hockey sticks.
🎧 I don't think so because players still use wooden sticks today.
🎧 What it does say here, though,
🎧 is that when the game started you had to produce a stick yourself.
🎧 I guess they just weren't being manufactured.
🎧 So, one more perhaps.
🎧 What about football?
🎧 Well, I know the first balls were made of animal skin.
🎧 Yeah, they covered them with pieces of leather that were stitched together,
🎧 but... the balls let in water when it rained.
🎧 Oh, that would have made them much heavier.
🎧 That's right.
🎧 You can imagine the damage to player's necks when the ball was headed.
🎧 Oh, how painful that must have been!
🎧 Yeah, well, I think we can put together some useful ideas...
🎧 
🎧 Hello everyone.
🎧 Today we're going to look at another natural food product
🎧 and that's maple syrup.
🎧 What is this exactly?
🎧 Well, maple syrup looks rather like clear honey,
🎧 but it's not made by bees;
🎧 it's produced from the plant fluid, or sap, inside the maple tree
🎧 and that makes maple syrup a very natural product.
🎧 Maple syrup is a thick, golden, sweet-tasting liquid
🎧 that can be bought in bottles or jars
🎧 and poured onto food such as waffles and ice cream
🎧 or used in the baking of cakes and pastries.
🎧 It contains no preservatives or added ingredients,
🎧 and it provides a healthy alternative to refined sugar.
🎧 Let's just talk a bit about the maple tree itself,
🎧 which is where maple syrup comes from.
🎧 So, there are many species of maple tree,
🎧 and they'll grow without fertilizer in areas where there's plenty of moisture in the soil.
🎧 However, they'll only do this if another important criterion is fulfilled,
🎧 which is that they must have full or partial sun exposure during the day and very cool nights,
🎧 and I'll talk more about that in a minute.
🎧 There are only certain parts of the world that provide all these conditions:
🎧 one is Canada,
🎧 and by that, I mean all parts of Canada,
🎧 and the other is the north-eastern states of North America.
🎧 In these areas, the climate suits the trees perfectly.
🎧 In fact, Canada produces over two-thirds of the world's maple syrup,
🎧 which is why the five-pointed maple leaf is a Canadian symbol
🎧 and has featured on the flag since 1964.
🎧 So how did maple syrup production begin?
🎧 Well, long before Europeans settled in these parts of the world,
🎧 the indigenous communities had started producing maple sugar.
🎧 They bored holes in the trunks of maple trees
🎧 and used containers made of tree bark to collect the liquid sap as it poured out.
🎧 As they were unable to keep the liquid for any length of time,
🎧 they didn't have storage facilities in those days,
🎧 they boiled the liquid by placing pieces of rock that had become scorching hot from the sun into the sap.
🎧 They did this until it turned into sugar,
🎧 and they were then able to use this to sweeten their food and drinks.
🎧 Since that time, improvements have been made to the process,
🎧 but it has changed very little overall.
🎧 So let's look at the production of maple syrup today.
🎧 Clearly, the maple forests are a valuable resource in many Canadian and North American communities.
🎧 The trees have to be well looked after
🎧 and they cannot be used to make syrup until the trunks reach a diameter of around 25 centimetres.
🎧 This can take anything up to 40 years.
🎧 As I've already mentioned,
🎧 maple trees need the right conditions to grow and also to produce sap.
🎧 Why is this?
🎧 Well, what happens is that during a cold night,
🎧 the tree absorbs water from the soil,
🎧 and that rises through the tree's vascular system.
🎧 But then in the warmer daytime,
🎧 the change in temperature causes the water to be pushed back down to the bottom of the tree.
🎧 This continual movement, up and down,
🎧 leads to the formation of the sap needed for maple syrup production.
🎧 When the tree is ready,
🎧 it can be tapped and this involves drilling a small hole into the trunk
🎧 and inserting a tube into it that ends in a bucket.
🎧 The trees can often take several taps,
🎧 though the workers take care not to cause any damage to the healthy growth of the tree itself.
🎧 The sap that comes out of the trees consists of 98% water
🎧 and 2% sugar and other nutrients.
🎧 It has to be boiled so that much of that water evaporates,
🎧 and this process has to take place immediately, using what are called evaporators.
🎧 These are basically extremely large pans,
🎧 the sap is poured into these,
🎧 a fire is built and the pans are then heated until the sap boils.
🎧 As it does this, the water evaporates, and the syrup begins to form.
🎧 The evaporation process creates large quantities of steam,
🎧 and the sap becomes thicker and denser, and, at just the right moment,
🎧 when the sap is thick enough to be called maple syrup,
🎧 the worker removes it from the heat.
🎧 After this process, something called 'sugar sand' has to be filtered out
🎧 as this builds up during the boiling and gives the syrup a cloudy appearance and a slightly gritty taste.
🎧 Once this has been done,
🎧 the syrup is ready to be packaged so that it can be used for a whole variety of products.
🎧 It takes 40 litres of sap to produce one litre of maple syrup
🎧 so you can get an idea of how much is needed!
🎧 So that's the basic process...
