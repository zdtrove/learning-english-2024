[065] Cam7 - Test 1 - Part 1

🎧 Hello, this is Land Transport Information at Toronto Airport.
🎧 How may I help you?
🎧 Oh, good morning.
🎧 I'm flying to Toronto Airport next week, and I need to get to a town called um, Milton.
🎧 Could you tell me how I can get there?
🎧 Milton, did you say?
🎧 Let me see.
🎧 I think that's about 150 miles southwest of here.
🎧 In fact, it's 147 miles to be exact,
🎧 so it'll take you at least - say, three to four hours by road.
🎧 Wow! Is it as far as that?
🎧 Yes, I'm afraid so.
🎧 But you have a number of options to get you there
🎧 and you can always rent a car right here at the airport, of course.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Well, I don't really want to drive myself, so...
🎧 I'd like more information about public transport.
🎧 OK.
🎧 In that case the quickest and most comfortable is a cab
🎧 and of course there are always plenty available.
🎧 But it'll cost you.
🎧 You can also take a Greyhound bus or there's an Airport Shuttle Service to Milton.
🎧 Uh, I think for that kind of distance a cab would be way beyond my budget.
🎧 But the bus sounds OK.
🎧 Can you tell me how much that would cost?
🎧 Sure.
🎧 Let's see, that would be $15 one way,
🎧 or 27.50 return...
🎧 that's on the Greyhound.
🎧 Oh, that's quite cheap - great!
🎧 Uh... but whereabouts does it stop in Milton?
🎧 It goes directly from the airport here to the City Centre, and it's pretty fast.
🎧 But you have to bear in mind that there is only one departure a day,
🎧 so it depends what time your flight gets in.
🎧 Oh, of course.
🎧 Hang on, we're due to get there at 11.30 am.
🎧 Hmmm, too bad,
🎧 the bus leaves at 3.45,
🎧 so you would have quite a wait - more than 4 hours.
🎧 Oh, I see.
🎧 Well, what about the shuttle you mentioned?
🎧 OK.
🎧 That's the Airport Shuttle that will take you from the airport right to your hotel or private address.
🎧 It's a door-to-door service and it would suit you much better, because there's one every two hours.
🎧 So how much does that cost?
🎧 Let's see.
🎧 Yeah, that's $35 one way, $65 return,
🎧 so I guess it's a bit more expensive than the Greyhound.
🎧 Oh, that doesn't sound too bad,
🎧 especially if it'll take me straight to the hotel.
🎧 But you do need to reserve a seat.
🎧 OK,
🎧 is it possible to make a booking right now? Through you?
🎧 Sure.
🎧 OK, I just have to fill this form out for you.
🎧 So what date do you want to book this for?
🎧 The 16th of October.
🎧 Oh, oh, no, sorry, that's my departure date.
🎧 I arrive on the 17th, so book it for then, please.
🎧 So, that's the Toronto Airport Shuttle to Milton.
🎧 And this is for just one person or…?
🎧 Yeah, just me, please.
🎧 Right.
🎧 And you said your expected time of arrival was 11.30?
🎧 So if I book your Shuttle for after 12.00 - let's say 12.30,
🎧 that should give you plenty of time to, you know, collect your baggage, maybe grab a coffee?
🎧 Yeah, that sounds fine, as long as we land on time!
🎧 Well, we'll take your flight details so you don't need to worry too much about that.
🎧 Now, what about the fare?
🎧 What sort of ticket do you want?
🎧 One way or…?
🎧 Yeah, that'll be fine, provided I can book the return trip once I'm there.
🎧 No problem - just allow a couple of days in advance to make sure you get a seat.
🎧 And what is your name, please?
🎧 Janet, Janet Thomson.
🎧 Is that Thompson spelt with a 'p'?
🎧 No, it's THOMSON.
🎧 OK.
🎧 And you'll be coming from the UK?
🎧 What flight will you be traveling on?
🎧 Oh, it's Air Canada flight number AC936, from London Heathrow.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Now, do you know where you'll be staying?
🎧 We need to give the driver an address.
🎧 Yes, it's called the Vacation Motel
🎧 and I think it's near the town centre.
🎧 Anyway, the address is 24, Kitchener Street -
🎧 that's KITCHENER Street.
🎧 That's fine.
🎧 Right, so that's $35 to pay, please. Have you got your credit card number there?
🎧 Yes, it's a VISA card,
🎧 and the number is 3303 8450 2045 6837.
🎧 OK. Well, that seems to be everything.
🎧 Have a good trip and we'll see you in Toronto next week!
🎧 Yes, bye. Oh, thanks for your help!

[066] Cam7 - Test 1 - Part 2

🎧 Thank you all for coming to my talk this evening.
🎧 It's nice to see so many people in the audience.
🎧 For those of you who don't know very much about PS Camping,
🎧 let me start by giving you some background information about the company.
🎧 The company started 25 years ago.
🎧 It actually opened as a retail chain selling camping equipment,
🎧 and then 20 years ago, it bought a small number of campsites in the UK,
🎧 and began offering camping holidays.
🎧 The company grew rapidly
🎧 and has been providing holidays in continental Europe for the last 15 years.
🎧 If you book a camping holiday with us,
🎧 you'll have a choice of over 300 sites.
🎧 In Italy, we now have some 64 sites that we either own, or have exclusive use of.
🎧 France is where we have the majority of sites,
🎧 and we currently have a project to expand into Switzerland.
🎧 We also have a number of sites in Northern Spain,
🎧 particularly in the mountainous region of Picos de Europa.
🎧 We've upgraded all these Spanish sites,
🎧 and improved them considerably from their original three-star rating.
🎧 We believe our holidays offer superb facilities for the whole family.
🎧 Parents who want their children to be fully occupied for all or part of the day
🎧 can take advantage of our children's activities.
🎧 These are organised by our well-qualified and enthusiastic staff.
🎧 Each day kicks off with a sports match, perhaps football, or volleyball,
🎧 followed by an hour of drama for everyone.
🎧 This may include singing or dancing, mime or other activities.
🎧 In the afternoon, there's a different art activity for each day of the week
🎧 including a poster competition or model making.
🎧 What's more, our sites are truly child-friendly,
🎧 and, with this in mind, we operate a no-noise rule in the evenings.
🎧 Children's evening activities usually finish at 9.30, or occasionally 10,
🎧 and from 10.30 holiday-makers are expected to be quiet in the areas where there are tents.
🎧 We want nothing to go wrong on a PS Camping holiday,
🎧 but if it does, we also want all our customers to be insured.
🎧 If you haven't organised an annual insurance policy of your own
🎧 you'll need to take out the low-cost cover we offer
🎧 and we require that you arrange this when you make your holiday reservation.
🎧 There are many advantages to choosing PS Camping, and to recommending it to others.
🎧 As a regular customer, you'll be kept informed of special offers,
🎧 and your friends can benefit from 10% off their holiday,
🎧 or book a luxury tent for the price of a standard one.
🎧 In return, we'll send you a thank-you present,
🎧 which you can choose from a list of high-quality items.
🎧 When it comes to our tents, these are equipped to the highest standard.
🎧 We really do think of every essential detail,
🎧 from an oven and cooking rings fuelled by bottled gas,
🎧 to mirrors in the bedroom areas.
🎧 If you don't want to cook indoors,
🎧 you can borrow a barbecue if you ask in advance for one to be made available,
🎧 and there's even a picnic blanket to sit on outside your tent.
🎧 Inside, a box of games and toys can be found,
🎧 and children's tents can be hired if required.
🎧 All tents have a fridge,
🎧 and if you want to spend the day on the beach, for example,
🎧 ask for a specially designed PS Camping cool box,
🎧 which will keep your food and drinks chilled.
🎧 There are excellent washing facilities at all our sites,
🎧 with washing machines and clothes lines in the central areas,
🎧 along with mops and buckets in case your tent needs cleaning during your stay.
🎧 All sites have a cafe and/or a shop
🎧 for those who'd rather 'eat in' than dine at a local restaurant.

[067] Cam7 - Test 1 - Part 3

🎧 Well, you've both been looking at different styles of managing individuals in companies and the workplace.
🎧 How's the research going, Philip?
🎧 Well, I've been looking at why individualism...
🎧 I mean individual differences, are such an important area of management studies.
🎧 When you think about any organization,
🎧 be it a family business or a multinational company,
🎧 they're all fundamentally a group of people working together.
🎧 But it's what these individuals contribute to their places of work that makes you realize how important they are.
🎧 Of course they bring different ideas,
🎧 but it's also their attitudes and their experiences of learning.
🎧 Diversity is important in these areas too.
🎧 So why do people behave so differently from one another at work?
🎧 There are lots of reasons
🎧 but research has shown that a lot of it comes down to personality.
🎧 And the other factor is gender.
🎧 It's a well known fact that men and women do lots of things in different ways,
🎧 and the workplace is no different.
🎧 Did you look at the effects of this variation on companies?
🎧 Yes, I did.
🎧 On the positive side,
🎧 exposure to such diversity helps encourage creativity
🎧 which is generally an asset to a company.
🎧 But unfortunately individual differences are also the root of conflict between staff
🎧 and they can lead to difficulties for management, which can sometimes be serious.
🎧 Thanks, Philip.
🎧 So, now, I guess the two main things to remember here are to identify individual talent and then to utilize it.
🎧 So, Janice, you were looking at identifying different talents in workers.
🎧 Do you think this is easy for managers to do?
🎧 Well, currently teamwork is in fashion in the workplace
🎧 and in my opinion the importance of the individual is generally neglected.
🎧 What managers should be targeting is those employees who can take the lead in a situation
🎧 and are not afraid to accept the idea of responsibility.
🎧 That's true Janice but...
🎧 unfortunately, many managers think the entire notion of encouraging individuality amongst their staff is far too hard.
🎧 Yes, that may be true
🎧 but I think one of the most important tasks of managers is to consider the needs of the individual on one hand
🎧 and group co-operation and conformity on the other.
🎧 It requires creative thinking on the part of management to avoid tension.
🎧 So Janice, what kind of people do you think companies should be looking for?
🎧 Well, it has to start from the very beginning
🎧 when companies are looking for new employees.
🎧 When the personnel department is choosing between applicants
🎧 they need to look for someone who's broken the mould and can think for themselves.
🎧 Instead, people making these decisions often use a range of psychological tests
🎧 to see if a person is a problem solver, or will do as they're told.
🎧 I'm not convinced these qualities are actually the most important.
🎧 So, do you think being a good team player is overrated?
🎧 No, it's not overrated.
🎧 You do need to learn the rules and learn them fast.
🎧 No individual can get around this if you're working in an organization.
🎧 So how should managers deal with this?
🎧 Rewards.
🎧 When an individual demonstrates the behaviour the organisation expects,
🎧 some kind of incentive can be given.
🎧 What's important here is that this happens right at the beginning
🎧 so new recruits learn the rules of the system immediately.
🎧 Also the incentive should be something the individual actually wants,
🎧 and this isn't always just money.
🎧 To come back to you, Philip.
🎧 You were saying that recognition of good performers is essential.
🎧 What else should managers be looking for?
🎧 Well, managing people means you not only have an understanding of your employees,
🎧 but you also recognise the culture of the organization.
🎧 In fact, for some organizations, creativity and individuality may be the last thing they want to see during working hours!
🎧 Very true.
🎧 Yes, but managing people isn't as easy as it looks.
🎧 For example, change in the workplace can be quite tricky,
🎧 especially if there's a need to increase profit.
🎧 And at times like these,
🎧 managers may have to give priority to profit rather than individual staff needs.
🎧 Yes, and that creates difficult situations for people.
🎧 Yes but what's important is that managers are able to deal with quite high levels of personal stress.
🎧 During times of change,
🎧 they should be thinking not only about the strain on their staff
🎧 but take time out to think of themselves.
🎧 Absolutely.
🎧 So what are the implications…

[068] Cam7 - Test 1 - Part 4

🎧 Good afternoon, everyone!
🎧 This is the first seminar in preparation for our archaeological fieldwork in Namibia;
🎧 we are fantastically lucky to have received partial research funding for this trip from our Institute,
🎧 so I shall expect 200% attention and participation from you all.
🎧 First in this seminar, I'm going to give a brief introduction to contemporary research on rock art,
🎧 and in the second part I'm going to give you some do's and don'ts for our fieldwork trip in April -
🎧 so please listen very carefully.
🎧 I'm first going to focus on the interpretation of rock art in Namibia.
🎧 We are very fortunate to be going to an area where you can find some of the most important sites in the entire world.
🎧 And I hope to show you how easy it is for everyone to make mistakes in looking at cultures which are different from our own -
🎧 the first and most important lesson we have to learn.
🎧 In Namibia, there are both paintings and engravings -
🎧 that's where the surface of the rock is cut out.
🎧 Many of the engravings show footprints of animals
🎧 and most scholars used to think that the purpose of these was simple and obvious:
🎧 this rock art was like a school book with pictures to teach children about tracks -
🎧 which track belonged to which animal - giraffe, lion and so on.
🎧 But there were some mysteries.
🎧 First, when you look at a typical Namibian painting or engraving,
🎧 you see the tracks are repeated, there are dozens of tracks for the same animal.
🎧 You'd expect just one clear illustration if the reason... the aim was to teach tracking.
🎧 Now, there were two more problems.
🎧 Why are some of the engravings of animals very accurate as you'd expect - all clearly identifiable,
🎧 and others quite unrealistic?
🎧 And another mystery:
🎧 some of these unrealistic animals that's in the engravings seem to be half human.
🎧 Some, for example, have got human faces.
🎧 Many researchers now think that these were pictures the wise men engraved of themselves.
🎧 They believed they could use magic to control the animals they had drawn,
🎧 so the hunters could then catch them for food.
🎧 This shows you some of the dangers of coming from one culture to another,
🎧 as we'll be doing, without understanding it fully.
🎧 Scholars imagined that children looked at rock art pictures to learn to track
🎧 just because they themselves had learnt skills from pictures;
🎧 many researchers now believe that rock art had a much more complex purpose.
🎧 And we'll talk more about it next week!
🎧 Now, before I invite you to join in a discussion in this second part of the seminar,
🎧 I'd like to make some very important points about our fieldwork
🎧 and in fact, any field trip to look at rock art.
🎧 We're going to a number of sites, and we won't always be together.
🎧 The single largest problem faced by people who manage the sites is...
🎧 yes, I'm sure you've guessed - damage caused by visitors,
🎧 even though it's usually unintentional.
🎧 Whenever you do go to a site,
🎧 don't forget you can learn many things from observing at a distance instead of walking all over it.
🎧 This can really help to reduce visitor pressure.
🎧 People often say, 'Well, there's only two of us and just this one time',
🎧 but maybe thousands of people are saying the same thing.
🎧 And then some basic rules to guide you:
🎧 we'll have our own camp near a village,
🎧 but remember, never to camp on a site if you go on your own.
🎧 It may be disrespectful to the people of that culture,
🎧 and certainly don't make fires, however romantic it may seem.
🎧 It's really dangerous in dry areas,
🎧 and you can easily burn priceless undiscovered material by doing so.
🎧 So, how are we going to enjoy the rock art on our field trip?
🎧 By looking at it, drawing it and photographing it,
🎧 never by touching it or even tracing it.
🎧 Rock art is fragile and precious.
🎧 Remember that climbing on rocks and in caves can destroy in a moment what has lasted for centuries.
🎧 So no heroics in Namibia, please!
🎧 Try to be extra careful and help others to be too.
🎧 And lastly, please don't even move rocks or branches to take photographs.
🎧 You should leave the site intact.
🎧 I'm sure I can rely on you to do that.
🎧 Well, that's about all I want to say before today's first discussion,
🎧 but if you have any questions, please ask them now
🎧 oh, and, don't forget you'll find some fascinating information about world-wide sites on the Internet.
🎧 Right, first question then?
