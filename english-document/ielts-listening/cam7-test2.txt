🎧 Hello… Motor Insurance Department…
🎧 Oh hello…
🎧 I'd like to ask about insurance for my car.
🎧 Yes, of course.
🎧 I'll just take a few details.
🎧 What's your name?
🎧 Patrick Jones.
🎧 And your address?
🎧 It's 27 Bank Road.
🎧 27 Bank Road.
🎧 Is that in Greendale?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 And what's your daytime phone number?
🎧 My work number is 730453.
🎧 And could I ask what your occupation is?

🎧 Okay…
🎧 Now, a few details about your car…
🎧 What size is the engine?
🎧 It's 1200 ccs.
🎧 Thank you…
🎧 and the make and model?
🎧 It's a Hewton Sable.
🎧 Could you spell the model name please?
🎧 Yes… SABLE.
🎧 Ah yes… thanks.
🎧 And when was it made?
🎧 1997.
🎧 Lovely…
🎧 right…
🎧 I presume you've had a previous insurer?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 Right…
🎧 we need to know the name of the company.
🎧 Yes… it was Northern Star.
🎧 Thank you,
🎧 and have you made any insurance claims in the last five years?
🎧 Yes…
🎧 one in 1999.
🎧 And what was the problem?
🎧 It was stolen… but…
🎧 That's fine, Mr Jones… that's all we need to know at the moment…
🎧 And will there be any other named drivers?
🎧 Just the one…
🎧 And his name?
🎧 Simon Paynter.
🎧 Could you spell the surname please?
🎧 PAYNTER.
🎧 Okay, thank you…
🎧 And what relationship is he to you?
🎧 He's my brother-in-law.
🎧 And what will you or Mr Paynter be using the car for?
🎧 Well… uh... mainly for social use…
🎧 Will you be using it to travel to work?
🎧 Yes… sometimes.
🎧 Anything else?
🎧 No. That's it.
🎧 And finally, when would you like to start the insurance?
🎧 I'll need it from the 31st of January.
🎧 Right…
🎧 Mr Jones… I'm getting a couple of quotes coming up on the computer now…
🎧 and the best bet looks like being with a company called Red Flag.
🎧 Yeah.
🎧 And that comes out at $450 per year…
🎧 That seems okay.
🎧 It's quite a bit lower than I've been paying up to now.
🎧 Great.
🎧 So, would you like me to go ahead with that?
🎧 Sure… why not?
🎧 How would you like to pay?

🎧 Thank you for calling the Tourist Line.
🎧 There are many different ways of getting round the city
🎧 and we'd like to suggest some you may not have thought of.
🎧 How about a city trip by boat?
🎧 There are four main stopping points - from west to east:
🎧 stop A: Green Banks,
🎧 stop B: City Bridge,
🎧 stop C: Roman Landing
🎧 and stop D: Newtown.
🎧 You can find the main booking office at stop A.
🎧 The first boat leaves at 8 a.m.
🎧 and the last one at 6.30 p.m.
🎧 There are also many attractions you can visit along the river.
🎧 At Stop A, if you have time,
🎧 you can visit the fine 16th century palace here
🎧 built for the king with its beautiful formal gardens.
🎧 It's very near the booking office.
🎧 Now, you can enjoy every corner of this superb residence.
🎧 Stop B - Why don't you visit Tower Restaurant with its wide range of refreshments?
🎧 This is a place where you can sit and enjoy the wonderful views over the old commercial and banking centre of the city.
🎧 Stop C is the area where, in the first century AD, invading soldiers crossed the river;
🎧 this was much shallower than it is now.
🎧 That's why this area is called Roman Landing.
🎧 There's an interactive museum to visit here
🎧 with a large shop which has a good range of local history books.
🎧 At the furthest point of the trip, stop D,
🎧 the most exciting place to visit is the new Entertainment Complex
🎧 with seven-screen cinema, bowling alley and video games arcade.
🎧 Besides the boat tours, there are city buses.
🎧 Two companies offer special services:
🎧 The Top Bus Company runs all its tours with a live commentary in English.

🎧 We're pleased to welcome Dr Martin Merrywhether of the Antarctic Centre in Christchurch, New Zealand
🎧 who has come along to talk to us today about the role of the Centre and the Antarctic Treaty.
🎧 Now my first question is about the choice of location for the centre.
🎧 Why Christchurch? Was it because of the climate?
🎧 Well, actually, New Zealand is the second closest country to Antarctica
🎧 and Christchurch is often used on Antarctic expeditions.
🎧 Right, so it's because of where we are… coupled with our historical role.
🎧 So tell us - what is the main purpose of the centre?
🎧 Oh well… we have two complementary roles.
🎧 One is as a scientific base for expeditions and research
🎧 and the other is as an information centre.
🎧 Tell us something about the role as a scientific base.
🎧 We're able to provide information about what scientists should take with them to the South Pole -
🎧 for example, the centre contains a clothing warehouse
🎧 where expeditions are supplied with suitable clothing for the extreme conditions.
🎧 I suppose you need a bit more than your normal winter coat!
🎧 Yes, exactly
🎧 and then there's also the specialist library and mapping services.
🎧 Right.
🎧 And which countries are actually located at the centre?
🎧 Well… the centre houses research programmes for New Zealand,
🎧 for The United States as well as for Italy…
🎧 there's even a US post office at the American airforce base here.
🎧 Really?
🎧 And what does the visitor's centre offer?
🎧 Well, since very few people will ever experience the Antarctic first hand,
🎧 the visitors' centre aims to recreate the atmosphere of Antarctica.
🎧 There's a mock camp site where you can see inside an Antarctic tent and imagine yourself sleeping there.
🎧 And the centre also acts as a showcase for the unique international co-operation
🎧 which exists in Antarctica today.
🎧 What is it actually like at the South Pole?
🎧 I know you've been there on a number of occasions.
🎧 Yes, I have and each time I'm struck by the awesome beauty of the place.
🎧 It's magnificent
🎧 but you can really only visit it in the summer months.
🎧 October to March.
🎧 Yes, because it's completely dark for four months of the year…
🎧 and, in addition, it has to be the coldest place on earth.
🎧 Colder than the North Pole?
🎧 Why's that?
🎧 Well, unlike the North Pole, which is actually a frozen sea,
🎧 Antarctica is a land mass shaped like a dome,
🎧 with the result that the winds blow down the slopes at speeds of up to 150 km an hour
🎧 and that's what makes it so cold.
🎧 And one other interesting thing is that Antarctica is the driest continent on earth,
🎧 surprisingly, and so you have to drink large amounts of water when you're there.
🎧 How old is Antarctica?
🎧 Oh, we're pretty sure it was part of a larger land mass but it broke away from the rest of the continent...
🎧 170 million years ago.
🎧 How can you be certain of this?
🎧 Because fossils and rocks have been discovered in Antarctica
🎧 which are the same as those found in places such as Africa and Australia.
🎧 Amazing… to think that it was once attached to Africa…
🎧 Now let's just have a look at the Antarctic Treaty.
🎧 How far back does the idea of an international treaty go?
🎧 Well, as far back as the 19th century,
🎧 when 11 nations organised an international event.
🎧 When was that exactly?
🎧 In 1870.
🎧 And it was called the Polar Research Meeting.
🎧 And then, not long after that,
🎧 they organised something called the First International Polar Year.
🎧 And that took place when exactly?
🎧 Over two years from 1882 to 1883.
🎧 But it wasn't until the 1950s that the idea of an international treaty was proposed.
🎧 And in 1959, the Treaty was actually signed.
🎧 What do you see as the main achievements of the treaty?
🎧 Well, firstly, it means that the continent is reserved for peaceful use.
🎧 That's Article 1, isn't it?
🎧 Yes…
🎧 That's important since the territory belongs to everyone.
🎧 Yes but not as important as Article 5,
🎧 which prohibits any nuclear explosions or waste disposal.
🎧 Which is marvellous.
🎧 Well, I'm afraid we're going to have to stop there because I'm afraid we've run out of time.
🎧 Thanks for coming along today and telling us all about the centre and its work.

[072] Cam7 - Test 2 - Part 4

🎧 My topic is handedness -
🎧 whether in different sports it is better to be left or right-sided
🎧 or whether a more balanced approach is more successful.
🎧 I'm left-handed myself
🎧 and I actually didn't see any relevance to my own life
🎧 when I happened to start reading an article by a sports psychologist called Peter Matthews.
🎧 He spent the first part of the article talking about handedness in music instead of sport,
🎧 which I have to say almost put me off from reading further.
🎧 But what I soon became struck by
🎧 was the sheer volume of both observation and investigation he had done in many different sports
🎧 and I felt persuaded that what he had to say would be of real interest.
🎧 I think Matthews' findings will be beneficial,
🎧 not so much in helping sportspeople to work on their weaker side,
🎧 but more that they can help them identify the most suitable strategies to use in a given game.
🎧 Although most trainers know how important handedness is,
🎧 at present they are rather reluctant to make use of the insights scientists like Matthews can give,
🎧 which I think is rather short-sighted
🎧 because focusing on individual flexibility is only part of the story.
🎧 Anyway, back to the article.
🎧 Matthews found a German study which looked at what he called 'mixed-handedness',
🎧 that is, the capacity to use both left and right hands equally.
🎧 It looked at mixed-handedness in 40 musicians on a variety of instruments.
🎧 Researchers examined a number of variables,
🎧 for example, type of instrument played,
🎧 regularity of practice undertaken
🎧 and length of time playing instrument…
🎧 and found the following:
🎧 keyboard players had high levels of mixed-handedness,
🎧 whereas string players like cellists and violinists strongly favoured one hand.
🎧 Also, those who started younger were more mixed-handed.
🎧 Matthews also reports studies of handedness in apes.
🎧 Apes get a large proportion of their food by 'fishing' ants from ant hills.
🎧 The studies show that apes, like humans, show handedness -
🎧 though, for them right and left-handedness is about equal,
🎧 whereas about 85% of humans are right-handed.
🎧 Studies showed that apes consistently using the same hand
🎧 fished out 30% more ants than those varying between the two.
🎧 Matthews started researching several different sports
🎧 and found different types of handedness in each.
🎧 By the way, he uses 'handedness'.
🎧 to refer to the dominant side for feet and eyes as well as hands.
🎧 Anyway, his team measured the hand, feet and eyes of 2,611 players
🎧 and found that there were really three main types of laterality:
🎧 mixed - you work equally well on both sides - both hand and eye;
🎧 single - you tend to favour one side but both hand and eye favour the same side;
🎧 and cross-laterality - a player's hands and eyes favour only one side
🎧 but they are opposite sides.
🎧 Let's start with hockey.
🎧 Matthews found that it was best to be mixed-handed -
🎧 this is because a hockey stick must be deployed in two directions -
🎧 it would be a drawback to have hand or eye favouring one side.
🎧 An interesting finding is that mixed-handed hockey players were significantly more confident than their single-handed counterparts.
🎧 Things are slightly different in racket sports like tennis.
🎧 Here the important thing is to have the dominant hand and eye on the one side.
🎧 This means that there is a bigger area of vision on the side where most of the action occurs.
🎧 If a player is cross lateral,
🎧 the racket is invisible from the dominant eye for much of the swing.
🎧 It means that they can only make corrections much later…
🎧 and often the damage has been done by then.
🎧 And moving to a rather different type of sport which involves large but precise movements - gymnastics.
🎧 It's been found that cross hand-eye favouring is best.
🎧 The predominant reason for this is because it aids balance,
🎧 which is of course absolutely central to performance in this sport.
