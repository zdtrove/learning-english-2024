[013] Cam3 - Test 4 - Part 1

🎧 John, I've just had some good news.
🎧 Susan has had her baby.
🎧 Do you know when she had it?
🎧 Yesterday.
🎧 The 10th of August.
🎧 Oh, my father was born on August the 10th.
🎧 Give me the details and I'll make a note for everyone at work.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 Well, was it a boy or a girl?
🎧 It's a boy.
🎧 And what are they going to call him?
🎧 Tom.
🎧 Tom Lightfoot.
🎧 It sounds quite good, don't you think?
🎧 Yes, that has quite a good ring to it.
🎧 You know he's quite a big baby.
🎧 He weighed 4.25 kilos when he was born.
🎧 That does sound big, 4.25 kilos.
🎧 And he's long too, 46 centimetres.
🎧 Mmmm. Tall parents.
🎧 He'll grow up to be over 2 metres, I'd say.
🎧 With masses of black hair, curly black hair.
🎧 You know, we should go and visit them in hospital.
🎧 What about tomorrow afternoon at around 1 pm?
🎧 Yes, okay.
🎧 Where should we meet?...
🎧 Ah, I could come and pick you up at your house, if you like.
🎧 Yes, that would be wonderful.
🎧 My car is still off the road.
🎧 Just refresh my memory....
🎧 What's the address again?
🎧 It's 15 Chesterfield Road, Paddington.
🎧 It's next to the library, isn't it?
🎧 Not exactly. It's next to a bank.
🎧 The State Bank actually.
🎧 The library is opposite us, on the corner.
🎧 That's right,
🎧 and there's a garage on the other street corner. I remember now.
🎧 So, you'll pick me up at 12.45
🎧 and we'll be there at one easily.
🎧 Now what should we take?
🎧 We must take them something.
🎧 I always think flowers are good to take to someone in hospital, don't you?
🎧 Well, not really.
🎧 Everyone always brings flowers and they don't last.
🎧 I think it's much better to take a pot plant,
🎧 so she can take it home with her.
🎧 Yes, but then she has to remember to water it.
🎧 What about a big box of chocolates?
🎧 Okay, chocolates sound fine.
🎧 We should get something for the baby too. What do you think?
🎧 Yes, you're right.
🎧 What do you think of something like baby shampoo or talcum powder?
🎧 Or we could get a little hat, or something like that.
🎧 We don't know the size, or the right colour, do we?
🎧 I think we should get something they wouldn't normally buy.
🎧 What about a soft toy of some sort?
🎧 Yes, a soft toy.
🎧 What about a teddy bear?
🎧 I could get one early tomorrow at the market
🎧 and I could probably get the chocolates there too.
🎧 Good.
🎧 So you'll pick me up at a quarter to one at my place
🎧 and I'll make sure that I've got the presents.
🎧 You must remember how much you paid for the gifts,
🎧 so I can pay you back for half.
🎧 If they're going to be from both of us, I would like to go shares.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 I'd say the chocolates would be about $15 for something nice and not too small
🎧 and the toy would be around $35 or so, I'd think.
🎧 Good, that'll be fine. About $25 each then.
🎧 Good, I'll pick you up then on Sunday at 12.45.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 See you then. Bye.

[014] Cam3 - Test 4 - Part 2

🎧 Good evening.
🎧 Tonight's show comes to you from the Good Home Exhibition in Duke's Court,
🎧 where we've been trying out some of the latest gadgets on show here
🎧 and getting our resident expert - Liz Shearer -
🎧 to tell us which ones are worth buying and which will die a death.
🎧 Well, hello.
🎧 Yes, John, I've been investigating four new household gadgets
🎧 and sorting out the advantages and disadvantages
🎧 and then really deciding what are 'Must buys',
🎧 what are 'Maybe buys' and what are 'Never buys'.
🎧 Let's start with this vacuum flask for keeping drinks hot.
🎧 I felt this had quite a lot going for it,
🎧 most of all is the fact that it contains no glass
🎧 and is therefore unbreakable to all intents and purposes.
🎧 It's made of stainless steel which is guaranteed for 20 years...
🎧 hope that's long enough...
🎧 and it's true what the manufacturer claims
🎧 that it does maintain heat for 18 hours.
🎧 So that's pretty good.
🎧 On the down side, it really works out to be quite expensive
🎧 and, much more surprisingly,
🎧 it unfortunately leaves a strange taste...
🎧 you know, when you've drunk from it...
🎧 so all in all, my recommendation would be it's got plenty of advantages,
🎧 but it is rather expensive so I'd say you should maybe buy it.
🎧 Moving on to a natty little device...
🎧 the Whistle Key Holder.
🎧 Basically this is where you whistle
🎧 and the key holder gives off a high pitched noise and flashes light
🎧 so you can find it.
🎧 One advantage of this model is that it also has a small light.
🎧 You press the button and this means you can find keyholes easily.
🎧 I also felt the small size was a real advantage.
🎧 On the weaker side, I did find the noise unpleasant.
🎧 Which I'm sure the designers could have done something about.
🎧 And I found that it didn't work through metal, so...
🎧 it's mainly used for finding in coat pockets, cushions, etc.
🎧 But taken as a whole I thought it was a masterpiece of design
🎧 and would highly recommend it.
🎧 The third gizmo is called the Army Flashlight
🎧 because it was developed initially for military use.
🎧 It works by squeezing the handle to generate the power.
🎧 Its advantages are that it can be used for outside activities,
🎧 and also... and, this is one of the surprising features...
🎧 it does work underwater.
🎧 My main objection to it though was, although it did work in these conditions,
🎧 this model gave off a weak light.
🎧 So my recommendation I'm afraid would have to be to avoid this one.
🎧 The decoy camera was last on my list.
🎧 This is a fake video camera which you fix to your wall to scare off burglars.
🎧 The advantage of this model is something which makes it look very realistic...
🎧 its flashing light.
🎧 On the down side, it was quite difficult to fix to the wall.
🎧 However, burglary is such a major problem these days that it is worth the effort, so...
🎧 this gets my strong recommendation.
🎧 Okay. Thanks for that, Liz.

[015] Cam3 - Test 4 - Part 3

🎧 Well, Amina, thanks for letting me have your draft in such good time.
🎧 Oh, that's alright.
🎧 I was just very anxious to hear what you think of it.
🎧 You can see that I decided to change the topic.
🎧 I had been interested in looking at Barings Factory.
🎧 Oh, I think the hospital was a much better choice.
🎧 In fact... well... I have to say that I thought it was good.
🎧 Oh?
🎧 There's still lots of work to be done...
🎧 Oh yes... of course.
🎧 But there's plenty of good ideas.
🎧 It opens well and the first chapter is fine
🎧 but the middle section really stood out for me... most interesting.
🎧 That's amazing
🎧 because I really didn't find it a bit easy to write...
🎧 How long did you work on the whole thing?
🎧 Well, I spent about two or three weeks reading and doing general research
🎧 and then I dashed the writing off very quickly...
🎧 so about four weeks in all.
🎧 Well, that's about par for the course.
🎧 You've got a while yet to make the changes.
🎧 Oh right... no problem...
🎧 Right. Let's have a look at my notes here.
🎧 Okay. Starting with section headings...
🎧 the broad divisions are good but you'll have to re-do the actual headings.
🎧 I've made some suggestions in the margins...
🎧 Okay. Thanks.
🎧 Now, this information on local housing...
🎧 I can see why you put it there
🎧 but it really isn't relevant to the approach you've taken.
🎧 I think I see what you mean.
🎧 Now... what did I say about the interviews?
🎧 I worked very hard on those.
🎧 I really thought they were valuable.
🎧 They are, Amina, but they're very complex and rather unclear at the moment.
🎧 You're going to have to spend a bit of time making the data a lot clearer.
🎧 Okay...
🎧 as long as I don't have to remove them altogether...
🎧 No, don't worry.
🎧 What about the chronology...
🎧 the list of dates?
🎧 I wasn't sure whether I should rewrite those.
🎧 My advice on that is to take them out. I feel it makes the whole piece appear too simplistic.
🎧 Okay, if it'll help.
🎧 Now, there are a couple of other books I'd like you to look at.
🎧 Have you got a pen?
🎧 Right... Approaches to Local History by John Mervis...
🎧 Right...
🎧 And then I think you need to think about ways of representing interview data.
🎧 Have a look at Sight and Sound by Kate Oakwell.
🎧 Sight and Sound.
🎧 Then you know I'm going away on holiday next week...
🎧 Yes.
🎧 So when you've made the changes, I suggest you show the work to your Support Tutor.
🎧 Support Tutor... right...
🎧 Then you do the proof reading...
🎧 Proof reading...
🎧 When by, do you think?
🎧 I'd aim for the 29th of June
🎧 and after that you should get it laser printed...
🎧 but be careful because the computer centre closes on 10 July.
🎧 And then I hand it in to...?
🎧 Oh, the Faculty Office as usual.
🎧 Okay, that's fine.
🎧 I think I'm all set now!
🎧 Thanks very much for all your help.
🎧 A pleasure.
🎧 See you when I get back.
🎧 Yep. Thanks, Dr Bryson.
🎧 Bye.
🎧 Bye.

[016] Cam3 - Test 4 - Part 4

🎧 Good afternoon.
🎧 I'm Paula Bundell
🎧 and I am giving you the lectures on Environmental Noise this term.
🎧 Today we are going to look into the effects of noise on a planned housing estate
🎧 in a particularly difficult part of the new Manchester Park area.
🎧 This site is not as bad as some I have researched in the past.
🎧 The Blacktown airport is closed from 6 pm to 7 am
🎧 and this is a great advantage to the site.
🎧 The only noise after dark is from the highway
🎧 and the traffic is somewhat reduced between 7.30 pm and 5.30 am.
🎧 So, the people most affected by the noise will be, I expect, housewives.
🎧 By the time most of the students and workers have arrived back home in the evening during the week,
🎧 the noise will have abated to a fairly large extent.
🎧 The weekends are still a problem of course,
🎧 but the traffic is certainly reduced on Saturdays to a large extent
🎧 and even more so on Sundays.
🎧 Of course, modifications to houses will be necessary at a site like this
🎧 and they come at a significant cost to the developer and home buyer.
🎧 The modifications I am about to outline
🎧 will add about $25,000 to the price of a newly-built house.
🎧 That will still mean a cheaper house than in a less noisy and more desirable area.
🎧 A bit of background would not go astray.
🎧 I understand that you are all familiar with the proposed development site at Manchester Park.
🎧 It's a particularly difficult one in terms of noise
🎧 with the highway along the eastern perimeter
🎧 and the Blacktown airport not 3 kilometres away to the north.
🎧 Of course, those nearest the highway will be the worst hit,
🎧 with heavy traffic noise as well as the noise from the light planes overhead.
🎧 As you all know, the normal noise threshold for private housing is 55 decibels.
🎧 At this site the levels have been recorded as high as 67 decibels.
🎧 The construction of the houses has to be somewhat modified from houses in most areas.
🎧 In the houses on the highway and in the noisiest areas of this site
🎧 there will be a need for specialised double glazing
🎧 and special acoustic seals will have to be fitted to the doors.
🎧 All exterior doors in this especially noisy pocket
🎧 will have to be solid core wood doors with hinges.
🎧 Every house built on this site,
🎧 not just those adjacent to the highway or nearest to the airport,
🎧 will require high density insulation materials in the roof.
🎧 Not only will all the roofs need insulating,
🎧 the exterior walls will be required to be double brick.
🎧 All ceilings will require double thickness plaster board to be used in the construction.
🎧 In the noisiest areas, mechanical ventilation will have to be installed in the exterior walls.
🎧 In those areas with sealed windows
🎧 it will be necessary to fit fans with absorbers to cut out the noise in those particular houses.
🎧 Air conditioning units could also be fitted in the ceilings of such houses
🎧 but this is substantially more expensive than fans,
🎧 and may not be needed on this site.
🎧 Coming back now to the double glazing I mentioned before.
🎧 Specialised double glazing requires a larger air gap
🎧 between the inner and outer glass than normal double glazing.
🎧 The gap must be at least 7 centimetres.
🎧 The thickness of the glass is also a factor,
🎧 8 millimetres on the outside and 6 on the inside pane.
🎧 It's essential that the glass be thicker on the outside than on the inside
🎧 and that the gap between the panes of glass be a minimum of 7 centimetres.
🎧 Obviously, the noise factor will have to be taken into consideration with the layout of the houses.
🎧 Living areas will have to be designed at the back of the houses away from the highway.
🎧 Bedrooms and living rooms will have to be built towards the back,
🎧 and for those houses closest to the highway
🎧 two layers of plasterboard will be needed for the interior bedroom walls.
🎧 Those rooms constructed at the front of the houses
🎧 should be garages, laundries, kitchens, bathrooms and dining rooms.
🎧 I have come to the conclusion that this development should go ahead,
🎧 but with various acoustic modifications according to the position of the block
🎧 in relation to the highway and intersection.
