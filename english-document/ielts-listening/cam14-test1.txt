🎧 Good morning. What can I do for you?
🎧 I want to report a theft.
🎧 I had some things stolen out of my bag yesterday.
🎧 I'm sorry to hear that.
🎧 Right, so I'll need to take a few details.
🎧 Can I start with your name?
🎧 Louise Taylor.
🎧 OK, thank you.
🎧 And are you resident in the UK?
🎧 No, I'm actually Canadian. Though my mother was British.
🎧 And your date of birth?
🎧 December 14th, 1977.
🎧 So you're just visiting this country?
🎧 That's right.
🎧 I come over most summers on business.
🎧 I'm an interior designer and I come over to buy old furniture, antiques you know.
🎧 There are some really lovely things around here,
🎧 but you need to get out to the small towns.
🎧 I've had a really good trip this year, until this happened.
🎧 OK.
🎧 So you've been here quite a while?
🎧 Yes, I'm here for two months.
🎧 I go back next week.
🎧 So may I ask where you're staying now?
🎧 Well at present I've got a place at Park Apartments, that's on King Street.
🎧 I was staying at the Riverside Apartments on the same street,
🎧 but the apartment there was only available for six weeks
🎧 so I had to find another one.
🎧 OK.
🎧 And the apartment number?
🎧 Fifteen.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Now, I need to take some details of the theft.
🎧 So you said you had some things stolen out of your bag?
🎧 That's right.
🎧 And were you actually carrying the bag when the theft took place?
🎧 Yes, I really can't understand it.
🎧 I had my backpack on.
🎧 And I went into a supermarket to buy a few things
🎧 and when I opened it up my wallet wasn't there.
🎧 And what did your wallet have in it?
🎧 Well, fortunately I don't keep my credit cards in that wallet,
🎧 I keep them with my passport in an inside compartment in my backpack.
🎧 But there was quite a bit of cash there…
🎧 about £250 sterling, I should think.
🎧 I withdrew £300 from my account yesterday,
🎧 but I did a bit of shopping,
🎧 so I must have already spent about £50 of that.
🎧 OK.
🎧 At first I thought, oh I must have left the wallet back in the apartment,
🎧 but then I realised my phone had gone as well.
🎧 It was only a week old,
🎧 and that's when I realised I'd been robbed.
🎧 Anyway at least they didn't take the keys to my rental car.
🎧 Yes.
🎧 So you say the theft occurred yesterday?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 So that was September the tenth.
🎧 And do you have any idea at all of where or when the things might possibly have been stolen?
🎧 Well at first I couldn't believe it because the bag had been on my back ever since I left the apartment after lunch.
🎧 It's just a small backpack,
🎧 but I generally use it when I'm travelling because it seems safer than a handbag.
🎧 Anyway, I met up with a friend,
🎧 and we spent a couple of hours in the museum.
🎧 But I do remember that as we were leaving there, at about 4 o'clock,
🎧 a group of young boys ran up to us,
🎧 and they were really crowding round us,
🎧 and they were asking us what time it was,
🎧 then all of a sudden they ran off.
🎧 Can you remember anything about them?
🎧 The one who did most of the talking was wearing a T-shirt with a picture of something…
🎧 let's see… a tiger.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Any idea of how old he might have been?
🎧 Around twelve years old?
🎧 And can you remember anything else about his appearance?
🎧 Not much.
🎧 He was quite thin…
🎧 Colour of hair?
🎧 I do remember that - he was blond.
🎧 All the others were dark-haired.
🎧 And any details of the others?
🎧 Not really.
🎧 They came and went so quickly.
🎧 Right.
🎧 So what I'm going to do now is give you a crime reference number so you can contact your insurance company.
🎧 So this is ten digits:
🎧 8795482361.
🎧 Thank you.
🎧 So should I contact…
🎧 
🎧 Good morning everyone.
🎧 My name's Janet Parker and I'm the human resources manager.
🎧 We're very happy to welcome you to your new apprenticeship.
🎧 I hope that the next six months will be a positive and enjoyable experience for you.
🎧 I'd like to start with some general advice about being an apprentice.
🎧 Most of you have very little or no experience of working for a big organisation
🎧 and the first week or so may be quite challenging.
🎧 There will be a lot of new information to take in
🎧 but don't worry too much about trying to remember everything.
🎧 The important thing is to check with someone if you're not sure what to do -
🎧 you'll find your supervisor is very approachable and won't mind explaining things or helping you out.
🎧 You're here to learn so make the most of that opportunity.
🎧 You'll be spending time in different departments during your first week
🎧 so make an effort to talk to as many people as possible about their work -
🎧 you'll make some new friends and find out lots of useful information.
🎧 As well as having a supervisor, you'll each be assigned a mentor.
🎧 This person will be someone who's recently completed an apprenticeship
🎧 and you'll meet with them on a weekly basis.
🎧 Their role is to provide help and support throughout your apprenticeship.
🎧 Of course, this doesn't mean they'll actually do any of your work for you -
🎧 instead they'll be asking you about what goals you've achieved so far,
🎧 as well as helping you to identify any areas for improvement.
🎧 You can also discuss your more long-term ambitions with them as well.
🎧 Now I just want to run through a few company policies for our apprenticeship scheme with you…
🎧 Most importantly, the internet.
🎧 As part of your job you'll be doing some research online
🎧 so obviously you'll have unlimited access for that
🎧 but please don't use it for personal use,
🎧 you'll have your own phones for that.
🎧 Some of you have already asked me about flexible working.
🎧 After your probationary three-month period,
🎧 some of you will be eligible for this,
🎧 but it will depend on which department you're in and what your personal circumstances are.
🎧 So please don't assume you'll automatically be permitted to do this.
🎧 I want to make sure there's no confusion about our holiday policy.
🎧 Apart from any statutory public holidays
🎧 we ask that you don't book any holidays until after your six-month apprenticeship has finished.
🎧 Time off should only be taken if you are unwell.
🎧 Please speak to your supervisor if this is going to be a problem.
🎧 You'll be expected to work a 40-hour week
🎧 but there may be opportunities to do overtime during busy periods.
🎧 Although you're not required to do this,
🎧 it can be a valuable experience -
🎧 so we advise you to take it up if possible.
🎧 Obviously, we understand that people do have commitments outside work,
🎧 so don't worry if there are times when you are unavailable.
🎧 As you know, we don't have a formal dress code here -
🎧 you may wear casual clothes as long as they're practical -
🎧 and the only restriction for shoes we have is on high heels for health and safety reasons.
🎧 Comfortable shoes like trainers are preferable.
🎧 There's a heavily subsidised canteen on site where you can get hot meals or salads cheaply.
🎧 Snacks and drinks are also provided -
🎧 so we've decided to introduce a no packed lunch policy.
🎧 This is partly to encourage healthy eating at work
🎧 and partly to stop people from eating at their workstation, which is unhygienic.
🎧 OK moving on to…
🎧 
🎧 OK, so what I'd like you to do now is to talk to your partner about your presentations on urban planning.
🎧 You should have done most of the reading now, so I'd like you to share your ideas,
🎧 and talk about the structure of your presentation and what you need to do next.
🎧 OK Rob.
🎧 I'm glad we chose quite a specific topic - cities built next to the sea.
🎧 It made it much easier to find relevant information.
🎧 Yeah. And cities are growing so quickly -
🎧 I mean, we know that more than half the world's population lives in cities now.
🎧 Yeah, though that's all cities, not just ones on the coast.
🎧 But most of the biggest cities are actually built by the sea.
🎧 I'd not realised that before.
🎧 Nor me.
🎧 And what's more, a lot of them are built at places where rivers come out into the sea.
🎧 But apparently this can be a problem.
🎧 Why?
🎧 Well, as the city expands,
🎧 agriculture and industry tend to spread further inland along the rivers,
🎧 and so agriculture moves even further inland up the river.
🎧 That's not necessarily a problem,
🎧 except it means more and more pollutants are discharged into the rivers.
🎧 So these are brought downstream to the cities?
🎧 Right.
🎧 Did you read that article about Miami, on the east coast of the USA?
🎧 No.
🎧 Well, apparently back in the 1950s,
🎧 they built channels to drain away the water in case of flooding.
🎧 Sounds sensible.
🎧 Yeah, they spent quite a lot of money on them.
🎧 But what they didn't take into account was global warming.
🎧 So they built the drainage channels too close to sea level,
🎧 and now sea levels are rising, they're more or less useless.
🎧 If there's a lot of rain, the water can't run away, there's nowhere for it to go.
🎧 The whole design was faulty.
🎧 So what are the authorities doing about it now?
🎧 I don't know.
🎧 I did read that they're aiming to stop disposing of waste water into the ocean over the next ten years.
🎧 But that won't help with flood prevention now, will it?
🎧 No. Really they just need to find the money for something to replace the drainage channels,
🎧 in order to protect against flooding now.
🎧 But in the long term they need to consider the whole ecosystem.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Really, though, coastal cities can't deal with their problems on their own, can they?
🎧 I mean, they've got to start acting together at an international level instead of just doing their own thing.
🎧 Absolutely.
🎧 The thing is, everyone knows what the problems are
🎧 and environmentalists have a pretty good idea of what we should be doing about them,
🎧 so they should be able to work together to some extent.
🎧 But it's going to be a long time before countries come to a decision on what principles they're prepared to abide by.
🎧 Yeah, if they ever do.
🎧 So I think we've probably got enough for our presentation.
🎧 It's only fifteen minutes.
🎧 OK.
🎧 So I suppose we'll begin with some general historical background
🎧 about why coastal cities were established.
🎧 But we don't want to spend too long on that,
🎧 the other students will already know a bit about it.
🎧 It's all to do with communications and so on.
🎧 Yes.
🎧 We should mention some geographical factors,
🎧 things like wetlands and river estuaries and coastal erosion and so on.
🎧 We could have some maps of different cities with these features marked.
🎧 On a handout you mean?
🎧 Or some slides everyone can see?
🎧 Yeah, that'd be better.
🎧 It'd be good to go into past mistakes in a bit more detail.
🎧 Did you read that case study of the problems there were in New Orleans with flooding a few years ago?
🎧 Yes, We could use that as the basis for that part of the talk.
🎧 I don't think the other students will have read it,
🎧 but they'll remember hearing about the flooding at the time.
🎧 OK.
🎧 So that's probably enough background.
🎧 So then we'll go on to talk about what action's being taken to deal with the problems of coastal cities.
🎧 OK.
🎧 What else do we need to talk about?
🎧 Maybe something on future risks, looking more at the long term, if populations continue to grow.
🎧 Yeah.
🎧 We'll need to do a bit of work there,
🎧 I haven't got much information, have you?
🎧 No. We'll need to look at some websites.
🎧 Shouldn't take too long.
🎧 OK.
🎧 And I think we should end by talking about international implications.
🎧 Maybe we could ask people in the audience.
🎧 We've got people from quite a lot of different places.
🎧 That'd be interesting, if we have time, yes.
🎧 So now…
🎧 
🎧 Producing enough energy to meet our needs has become a serious problem.
🎧 Demand is rising rapidly,
🎧 because of the world's increasing population and expanding industry.
🎧 Burning fossil fuels, like gas, coal and oil,
🎧 seriously damages the environment
🎧 and they'll eventually run out.
🎧 For a number of years now,
🎧 scientists have been working out how we can derive energy from renewable sources,
🎧 such as the sun and wind, without causing pollution.
🎧 Today I'll outline marine renewable energy - also called ocean energy -
🎧 which harnesses the movement of the oceans.
🎧 Marine renewable energy can be divided into three main categories:
🎧 wave energy, tidal energy and ocean thermal energy conversion,
🎧 and I'll say a few words about each one.
🎧 First, wave energy.
🎧 Numerous devices have been invented to harvest wave energy,
🎧 with names such as Wave Dragon, the Penguin and Mighty Whale,
🎧 and research is going on to try and come up with a really efficient method.
🎧 This form of energy has plenty of potential, as the source is constant,
🎧 and there's no danger of waves coming to a standstill.
🎧 Electricity can be generated using onshore systems,
🎧 using a reservoir, or offshore systems.
🎧 But the problem with ocean waves is that they're erratic,
🎧 with the winds making them travel in every direction.
🎧 This adds to the difficulty of creating efficient technology:
🎧 ideally all the waves would travel smoothly and regularly along the same straight line.
🎧 Another drawback is that sand and other sediment on the ocean floor
🎧 might be stopped from flowing normally,
🎧 which can lead to environmental problems.
🎧 The second category of marine energy that I'll mention is tidal energy.
🎧 One major advantage of using the tide, rather than waves, as a source of energy
🎧 is that it's predictable:
🎧 we know the exact times of high and low tides for years to come.
🎧 For tidal energy to be effective,
🎧 the difference between high and low tides needs to be at least five metres,
🎧 and this occurs naturally in only about forty places on Earth.
🎧 But the right conditions can be created by constructing a tidal lagoon,
🎧 an area of sea water separated from the sea.
🎧 One current plan is to create a tidal lagoon on the coast of Wales.
🎧 This will be an area of water within a bay at Swansea,
🎧 sheltered by a U-shaped breakwater, or dam, built out from the coast.
🎧 The breakwater will contain sixteen hydro turbines,
🎧 and as the tide rises, water rushes through the breakwater,
🎧 activating the turbines, which turn a generator to produce electricity.
🎧 Then, for three hours as the tide goes out,
🎧 the water is held back within the breakwater,
🎧 increasing the difference in water level,
🎧 until it's several metres higher within the lagoon than in the open sea.
🎧 Then, in order to release the stored water,
🎧 gates in the breakwater are opened.
🎧 It pours powerfully out of the lagoon,
🎧 driving the turbines in the breakwater in the opposite direction
🎧 and again generating thousands of megawatts of electricity.
🎧 As there are two high tides a day,
🎧 this lagoon scheme would generate electricity four times a day, every day,
🎧 for a total of around 14 hours in every 24,
🎧 and enough electricity for over 150,000 homes.
🎧 This system has quite a lot in its favour:
🎧 unlike solar and wind energy it doesn't depend on the weather;
🎧 the turbines are operated without the need for fuel,
🎧 so it doesn't create any greenhouse gas emissions;
🎧 and very little maintenance is needed.
🎧 It's estimated that electricity generated in this way will be relatively cheap,
🎧 and that manufacturing the components would create more than 2,000 jobs,
🎧 a big boost to the local economy.
🎧 On the other hand,
🎧 there are fears that lagoons might harm both fish and birds,
🎧 for example by disturbing migration patterns,
🎧 and causing a build-up of silt, affecting local ecosystems.
🎧 There are other forms of tidal energy,
🎧 but I'll go on to the third category of marine energy:
🎧 ocean thermal energy conversion.
🎧 This depends on there being a big difference in temperature
🎧 between surface water and the water a couple of kilometres below the surface,
🎧 and this occurs in tropical coastal areas.
🎧 The idea is to bring cold water up to the surface using a submerged pipe.
🎧 The concept dates back to 1881...
