🎧 Hello, Wayside Camera Club, Breda speaking.
🎧 Oh, hello, um, my name's Dan and I'd like to join your club.
🎧 That's great, Dan.
🎧 We have an application form,
🎧 would you like to complete it over the phone,
🎧 then you can ask any questions you might have?
🎧 Oh, yes, thanks.
🎧 OK, so what's your family name?
🎧 It's Green, Dan Green.
🎧 So, can I take your email address?
🎧 Yes, it's dan1068@market.com.
🎧 Thanks.
🎧 And what about your home address?
🎧 Well, I'm about ten miles away from your club in Peacetown.
🎧 I live in a house there.
🎧 OK, so what's the house number and street?
🎧 It's 52 Marrowfield Street.
🎧 Is that M-A-R-R-O-W-F-I-E-L-D?
🎧 That's right.
🎧 ...and that's Peacetown, you said?
🎧 So how did you hear about our club?
🎧 Did you look on the internet?
🎧 I usually do that, but this time...
🎧 well, I was talking to a relative the other day and he suggested it.
🎧 Oh, is he a member too?
🎧 He belongs to another club,
🎧 but he'd heard good things about yours.
🎧 OK.
🎧 So what do you hope to get from joining?
🎧 Well, one thing that really interests me is the competitions that you have.
🎧 I enjoy entering those.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Anything else?
🎧 Well, I also like to socialise with other photographers.
🎧 That's great.
🎧 So what type of membership would you like?
🎧 What are the options?
🎧 It's £30 a year for full membership
🎧 or £20 a year if you're an associate.
🎧 I think I'll go for the full membership, then.
🎧 That's a good idea
🎧 because you can't vote in meetings with an associate membership.
🎧 If I could just find out a bit more about you...
🎧 OK.
🎧 So you said you wanted to compete,
🎧 have you ever won any photography competitions?
🎧 Not yet, but I have entered three in the past.
🎧 Oh, that's interesting.
🎧 So why don't you tell me something about those?
🎧 Let's start with the first one.
🎧 Well, the theme was entitled 'Domestic Life'.
🎧 I see.
🎧 So it had to be something related to the home?
🎧 Yeah.
🎧 I chose to take a photo of a family sitting round the dinner table having a meal,
🎧 and, urn, I didn't win, but I did get some feedback.
🎧 Oh, what did the judges say?
🎧 That it was too 'busy' as a picture.
🎧 Aha, so it was the composition of the picture that they criticised?
🎧 That's right, and once they'd told me that, I could see my mistake.
🎧 So what was the theme of the second composition?
🎧 Well, my university was on the coast
🎧 and that area gets a lot of beautiful sunsets
🎧 so that was the theme.
🎧 Oh, sunsets, that's a great theme.
🎧 Yes.
🎧 The instructions were to capture the clouds as well,
🎧 it couldn't just be blue sky and a setting sun.
🎧 Sure, 'cause they give you all those amazing pinks and purples.
🎧 Yeah, and I thought I'd done that well,
🎧 but the feedback was that I should have waited a bit longer to get the shot.
🎧 I see.
🎧 So the timing wasn't right.
🎧 Yes, I took it too soon, basically.
🎧 And then the third competition I entered was called 'Animal Magic'.
🎧 Well, that's a difficult subject!
🎧 I know!
🎧 I had to take hundreds of shots.
🎧 I'm sure, because animals move all the time.
🎧 That's what we had to show,
🎧 there had to be some movements in the scene.
🎧 I got a great shot of a fox in the end,
🎧 but I took it at night and...
🎧 well, I suspected that it was a bit dark which is what I was told.
🎧 Well, Dan, you seem to be really keen and we'd be delighted to have you in our club.
🎧 I'm sure we can help with all those areas that you've outlined.
🎧 Thanks, that's great.
🎧 
🎧 This evening we're delighted to welcome Dan Beagle,
🎧 who's just written a book on looking for and finding food in the wild.
🎧 He's going to tell us everything we need to know about picking wild mushrooms.
🎧 Thank you very much.
🎧 Well, I need to start by talking about safety.
🎧 You really need to know what you're doing because some mushrooms are extremely poisonous.
🎧 Having said that, once you know what to look for,
🎧 it's really worth doing for the amazing variety of mushrooms available -
🎧 which you can't get in the shops.
🎧 But of course, you have to be very careful
🎧 and that's why I always say you should never consume mushrooms picked by friends or neighbours.
🎧 Always remember that some poisonous mushrooms look very similar to edible ones
🎧 and it's easy for people to get confused.
🎧 The other thing to avoid is mushrooms growing beside busy roads for obvious reasons.
🎧 But nothing beats the taste of freshly picked mushrooms.
🎧 Don't forget that the ones in the shops are often several days old and past their best.
🎧 There are certain ideas about wild mushrooms that it's important to be aware of.
🎧 Don't listen to people who tell you that it's only OK to eat mushrooms that are pale or dull.
🎧 This is completely untrue.
🎧 Some edible mushrooms are bright red, for example.
🎧 Personally, I prefer mushrooms cooked
🎧 but it won't do you any harm to eat them uncooked in salads,
🎧 it's not necessary to peel them.
🎧 Another thing you should remember is that you can't tell if a mushroom is safe to eat by its smell.
🎧 Some of the most deadly mushrooms have no smell and taste quite nice, apparently.
🎧 Finally, just because deer or squirrels eat a particular mushroom doesn't mean that you can.
🎧 Of course, mushroom picking is associated with the countryside
🎧 but if you haven't got a car, your local park can be a great place to start.
🎧 There are usually a range of habitats where mushrooms grow,
🎧 such as playing fields and wooded areas.
🎧 But you need to be there first thing in the morning,
🎧 as there's likely to be a lot of competition,
🎧 not just from people but wildlife too.
🎧 The deer often get the best mushrooms in my local park.
🎧 If you're a complete beginner,
🎧 I wouldn't recommend going alone or relying on photos in a book,
🎧 even the one I've written!
🎧 There are some really good phone apps for identifying mushrooms,
🎧 but you can't always rely on getting a good signal in the middle of a wood.
🎧 If possible, you should go with a group led by an expert.
🎧 You'll stay safe and learn a lot that way.
🎧 Conservation is a really important consideration
🎧 and you must follow a few basic rules.
🎧 You should never pick all the mushrooms in one area.
🎧 Collect only enough for your own needs.
🎧 Be very careful that you don't trample on young mushrooms or other plants.
🎧 And make sure you don't pick any mushrooms that are endangered and protected by law.
🎧 There's been a decline in some varieties of wild mushrooms in this part of the country.
🎧 Restaurants are becoming more interested in locally sourced food like wild mushrooms,
🎧 but the biggest problem is that so many new houses have been built in this area in the last ten years.
🎧 And more water is being taken from rivers and reservoirs because of this,
🎧 and mushroom habitats have been destroyed.
🎧 Anyway, a word of advice on storing mushrooms.
🎧 Collect them in a brown paper bag
🎧 and as soon as you get home, put them in the fridge.
🎧 They'll be fine for a couple of days,
🎧 but it's best to cook them as soon as possible
🎧 after washing them really carefully first, of course.
🎧 So everybody knows what a mushroom tastes like, right?
🎧 Well, you'll be surprised by the huge variety of wild mushrooms there are.
🎧 Be adventurous!
🎧 They're great in so many dishes:
🎧 stir fries, risottos, pasta.
🎧 But just be aware that some people can react badly to certain varieties
🎧 so it's a good idea not to eat huge quantities to begin with.
🎧 OK, so now I'm going to show you...
🎧 
🎧 That seminar yesterday on automation and the future of work was really good, wasn't it?
🎧 Looking at the first industrial revolution in Britain in the 19th century
🎧 and seeing how people reacted to massive change was a real eye opener.
🎧 Yes.
🎧 It was interesting to hear how people felt about automation then
🎧 and what challenges they faced.
🎧 I didn't know that first started with workers in the textile industry.
🎧 With those protesting workers called the Luddites
🎧 destroying their knitting machines because they were so worried about losing their jobs.
🎧 Yes, and ultimately, they didn't achieve anything.
🎧 And anyway, industrialisation created more jobs than it destroyed.
🎧 Yes, that's true,
🎧 but it probably didn't seem a positive thing at the time.
🎧 I can see why the Luddites felt so threatened.
🎧 I know.
🎧 I'm sure I would have felt the same.
🎧 The discussion about the future of work was really optimistic for a change.
🎧 I like the idea that work won't involve doing boring, repetitive tasks,
🎧 as robots will do all that.
🎧 Normally, you only hear negative stuff about the future.
🎧 Bit too optimistic, don't you think?
🎧 For example, I can't see how people are about to have more leisure time,
🎧 when all the evidence shows people are spending longer than ever at work.
🎧 No, that's true.
🎧 And what about lower unemployment?
🎧 I'm not so sure about that.
🎧 Perhaps in the long term,
🎧 but not in the foreseeable future.
🎧 And I expect most people will be expected to work until they're much older
🎧 as everyone's living much longer.
🎧 That's already happening.
🎧 I enjoyed all that stuff on how technology's changed some jobs
🎧 and how they're likely to change in the near future.
🎧 Yeah, incredible.
🎧 Like accountants.
🎧 You might think all the technological innovations would have put them out of a job,
🎧 but in fact there are more of them than ever.
🎧 They're still really in demand and have become far more efficient.
🎧 Right. That was amazing.
🎧 Twenty times more accountants in this country compared to the 19th century.
🎧 I know.
🎧 I'd never have thought that demand for hairdressing would have gone up so much in the last hundred years.
🎧 One hairdresser for every 287 people now,
🎧 compared to one for over 1,500.
🎧 Yeah because people's earning power has gone up so they can afford to spend more on personal services like that.
🎧 But technology hasn't changed the actual job that much.
🎧 No, they've got hairdryers, etc.
🎧 but it's one job where you don't depend on a computer...
🎧 The kind of work that administrative staff do has changed enormously, thanks to technology.
🎧 Even 20 years ago there were secretaries doing dictation and typing.
🎧 Yes. Really boring compared to these days,
🎧 when they're given much more responsibility and higher status.
🎧 A lot of graduates go in for this kind of work now...
🎧 I'd expected there to be a much bigger change in the number of agricultural workers in the 19th century.
🎧 But the 1871 census showed that roughly 25% of the population worked on the land.
🎧 Yeah, I'd have assumed it would be more than 50%.
🎧 Now it's less than 0.2%.
🎧 Hmm... What about care workers?
🎧 They barely existed in the 19th century
🎧 as people's lifespan was so much shorter.
🎧 But now of course this sector will see huge growth.
🎧 Yeah, and it's hard enough to meet current demand.
🎧 The future looks quite bleak for bank clerks.
🎧 They've been in decline since ATMs were introduced in the 80s.
🎧 And technology will certainly make most of the jobs they do now redundant, I think.
🎧 I agree, although the situation may change.
🎧 It's very hard to predict what will happen.
🎧 
🎧 In today's astronomy lecture,
🎧 I'm going to talk about the need for a system to manage the movement of satellites
🎧 and other objects in orbit around the Earth.
🎧 In other words, a Space Traffic Management system.
🎧 We already have effective Air Traffic Control systems
🎧 that are used internationally to ensure that planes navigate our skies safely.
🎧 Well, Space Traffic Management is a similar concept,
🎧 but focusing on the control of satellites.
🎧 The aim of such a system would be to prevent the danger of collisions in space
🎧 between the objects in orbit around the Earth.
🎧 In order to do this, we'd need to have a set of legal measures,
🎧 and we'd also have to develop the technical systems to enable us to prevent such accidents.
🎧 But unfortunately, at present we don't actually have a Space Traffic Management system that works.
🎧 So why not?
🎧 What are the problems in developing such a system?
🎧 Well, for one thing, satellites are relatively cheap these days,
🎧 compared with how they were in the past,
🎧 meaning that more people can afford to put them into space.
🎧 So there's a lot more of them out there,
🎧 and people aren't just launching single satellites
🎧 but whole constellations, consisting of thousands of them designed to work together.
🎧 So space is getting more crowded every day.
🎧 But in spite of this, one thing you may be surprised to learn
🎧 is that you can launch a satellite into space
🎧 and, once it's out there, it doesn't have to send back any information to Earth to allow its identification.
🎧 So while we have international systems for ensuring we know where the planes in our skies are,
🎧 and to prevent them from colliding with one another,
🎧 when it comes to the safety of satellites,
🎧 at present we don't have anything like enough proper ways of tracking them.
🎧 And it isn't just entire satellites that we need to consider.
🎧 A greater threat is the huge amount of space debris in orbit around the Earth -
🎧 broken bits of satellite and junk from space stations and so on.
🎧 And some of these are so small that they can be very hard to identify,
🎧 but they can still be very dangerous.
🎧 In addition, some operators may be unwilling to share information about the satellites they've launched.
🎧 For example, a satellite may be designed for military purposes,
🎧 or it may have been launched for commercial reasons,
🎧 and the operators don't want competitors to have information about it.
🎧 And even if the operators are willing to provide it,
🎧 the information isn't easy to collect.
🎧 Details are needed about the object itself,
🎧 as well as about its location at a particular time -
🎧 and remember that a satellite isn't very big,
🎧 and it's likely to be moving at thousands of kilometres an hour.
🎧 We don't have any sensors that can constantly follow something moving so fast,
🎧 so all that the scientists can do is to put forward a prediction concerning where the satellite is heading next.
🎧 So those are some of the problems that we're facing.
🎧 Let's consider now some of the solutions that have been suggested.
🎧 One key issue is the way in which information is dealt with.
🎧 We need more information,
🎧 but it also needs to be accessible at a global level,
🎧 so we need to establish shared standards that we can all agree on
🎧 for the way in which this information is presented.
🎧 We already do this in other areas of science,
🎧 so although this is a challenge, it's not an impossible task.
🎧 Then, as all this information's collected,
🎧 it needs to be put together so it can be used,
🎧 and that will involve creating a single database on which it can be entered.
🎧 As we continue to push forward new developments,
🎧 congestion of the space environment is only going to increase.
🎧 To cope with this, we need to develop a system like the one I've described
🎧 to coordinate the work of the numerous spacecraft operators,
🎧 but it's also essential that this system is one that establishes trust in the people that use it,
🎧 both nationally and at a global level.
🎧 One interesting development...
