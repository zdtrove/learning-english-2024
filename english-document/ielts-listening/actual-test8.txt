🎧 Hello, is this John Murphy?
🎧 Hi, yes it is.
🎧 Hi John, this is Ed Heisenburg from the Wild Dunes Spa and Resort
🎧 calling about your application for our lifeguard position.
🎧 Do you have a few minutes to talk?
🎧 Yes, absolutely.
🎧 Great. Could you give me your address?
🎧 Sure.
🎧 My address is 45 Elsinore Court.
🎧 I'm sorry, was that Eleanor? Could you spell that for me?
🎧 Sure - it's Elsinore.
🎧 E-L-S-I-N-O-R-E.
🎧 Okay, thanks.
🎧 And is this the number we should reach you at in the future?
🎧 099885767?
🎧 No, that's my home phone,
🎧 but let me give you my mobile number instead:
🎧 077896245.
🎧 Call me on that one.
🎧 Okay - I'll make a note of that.
🎧 Could you tell me your availability?
🎧 Sure. I am usually available during afternoons or weekends.
🎧 I'd prefer not to be scheduled on weeknights because I work part-time as a waiter.
🎧 That shouldn't be a problem,
🎧 since we don't stay open very late anyway.
🎧 Do you have any other employment experience?
🎧 Yes, I have worked at a few other places.
🎧 I was the baseball coach at Ridgemont High School last season.
🎧 I see.
🎧 And do you have any other experience that you would like us to note on your application?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 Last year I worked at the beach as a rescue diver.
🎧 Rescue diver?
🎧 That sounds intense!
🎧 Well, it's really just like being a lifeguard, except in the ocean instead of a pool.
🎧 So kind of like being a lifeguard at the world's largest pool.
🎧 Haha. I see.
🎧 So could you tell me about the relevant skills you have?
🎧 I'm guessing a lot, given your experience.
🎧 I am CPR certified and have 2 years of diving experience.
🎧 Great! It sounds like you are well qualified for this position.
🎧 When does your CPR certification expire?
🎧 Hm. I think in November, but let me quickly check my CPR card…
🎧 actually, it expires in October.
🎧 Okay, so regardless you have it through the end of the summer.
🎧 When is your ideal time to work?
🎧 Since I work in the restaurant on weeknights,
🎧 I like weekends best - specifically Saturday mornings.
🎧 I see.
🎧 We do already have a lot of staff available on Saturdays,
🎧 but I do need an early morning shift lifeguard.
🎧 How early could you work Saturday morning?
🎧 I can get there by 6 o'clock if need be.
🎧 You'll be happy to know we open a little later than that,
🎧 but I'll put you down for Saturday mornings here.
🎧 Oh awesome! I can't wait to get started.
🎧 How about you come in next Saturday, the 12th?
🎧 That sounds good.
🎧 Great.
🎧 We can figure out other shifts for you to work when you come in then.
🎧 One last thing - just out of curiosity, where did you hear about us?
🎧 I heard your ad on the radio while I was driving this morning.
🎧 You know, I think you're the first person who has responded to our radio ads.
🎧 It's almost always people who have seen us in the newspaper.
🎧 Yeah, I don't have time to read through the newspaper every morning.
🎧 I've plenty of time in the car to listen to radio ads.
🎧 That makes sense.
🎧 Well, thanks for your time, and we'll look forward to seeing you on the 12th.
🎧 
🎧 Good evening, I'm Geoffrey Miller, from the University of Nottingham Student Union.
🎧 And in this week's free class, Carlos Garcia is going to tell us about safety around campus.
🎧 Over to you, Carlos.
🎧 Thank you, Geoffrey. And thank you all for your attendance today.
🎧 Also, I would like to thank the student union here at the university for organising this lecture.
🎧 Well, I have been serving and protecting the city of Nottingham for over 20 years now
🎧 as a member of the police department.
🎧 Does anyone know what type of crime is the most prevalent on campus?
🎧 I heard someone say drugs and alcohol -
🎧 that actually isn't too much of an issue.
🎧 Violence? Nope.
🎧 Actually, the biggest thing we worry about here is theft.
🎧 The nature of crime on Nottingham's campus is quite different from that of the surrounding areas.
🎧 Crime rates across the East Midlands are very difficult to control.
🎧 We'd like to see the rate stay the same for this calendar year,
🎧 but it's been increasing steadily over the past three years.
🎧 On campus, however, I'm happy to say that the overall crime rate has fallen this year.
🎧 You wouldn't think so if you have seen the extremely exaggerated stories in the media.
🎧 The media has done nothing but cause more concern about crime in our area.
🎧 Even the crime shows you see today are a little bit farfetched,
🎧 but at least viewers know they are not real events.
🎧 We'd really like to see more factual news articles out there
🎧 so the public can have a rational sense of the safety level of our society.
🎧 OK, let's move on to what to do when you see a crime.
🎧 Do not get involved if at all possible,
🎧 and do not draw too much attention to yourself by running away in a conspicuous manner.
🎧 Though most likely and hopefully you will not have to experience this situation,
🎧 if you are being mugged please do not try to resist.
🎧 Instead, be compliant and, seek help after the incident.
🎧 Like I said, though, it is highly unlikely that you will find yourself amidst a crime,
🎧 but it is important to be prepared should it ever happen.
🎧 We find that educating students and staff on the correct precautions to take is the best way to increase your safety.
🎧 Just remember to be smart when you're out late at night,
🎧 and avoid any area or person that looks suspicious.
🎧 I know it sounds obvious, but I cannot stress this enough.
🎧 It's also not a bad idea to have your mobile phone with you at all times,
🎧 but be careful.
🎧 If you're chatting on your smart phone on your way home,
🎧 you're a prime target for thieves.
🎧 I'd like to see a show of hands -
🎧 how many people have left work or the library after 10 p.m. to go home before?
🎧 A lot of you, right?
🎧 If you do have to go home late at night, please don't walk home alone.
🎧 More often than not there's someone there that will be walking the same direction as you at some point.
🎧 Walk home with a friend or coworker.
🎧 Even if you must use your phone to call someone that's nearby to walk with you,
🎧 it's always safer to walk home with someone.
🎧 So when you're walking home,
🎧 you may feel more comfortable with some sort of self-defense,
🎧 such as pepper spray.
🎧 Now, it's your call whether you want to carry something like this or not.
🎧 However, I absolutely advise against carrying a knife or any other offensive weapon.
🎧 All too often they can be used against you if you're disarmed, putting yourself in more danger.
🎧 For all those interested, the recreation centre offers a free self-defense class to all students every Thursday evening.
🎧 While obviously an introductory self-defense class may not equip you to fight off villains like a regular superhero,
🎧 it does come in handy sometimes.
🎧 After taking a self-defense class,
🎧 you will surely be more aware of possible dangers and how to deal with them.
🎧 So hopefully now you have a more complete understanding of the nature of crimes committed on your campus,
🎧 and how to avoid being a victim.
🎧 I know most students at the University of Nottingham are not the criminal types,
🎧 but remember that there is no barrier like a wall or something keeping nonstudents out.
🎧 There is no army force securing the borders, and I doubt anyone wants it that way.
🎧 The campus is generally a safe place,
🎧 but it's not immune to small crimes once in a while.
🎧 Alright. That's all I have to say for today. Stay safe!
🎧 
🎧 Hi Bobby, go ahead and sit down.
🎧 Tell me about your research project.
🎧 Well, I decided to research football,
🎧 and keys for success on a football team.
🎧 That sounds great.
🎧 What are the guidelines for the test?
🎧 Did the teacher talk to you about it in class?
🎧 No, everything is on a handout that was passed out.
🎧 It says that the first draft is due at the end of next week,
🎧 and the second and third are due later on in the month.
🎧 I don't understand why we have to keep revising and fixing it.
🎧 Is this assignment really that important?
🎧 Well, this project is a major requirement for passing 11th grade English and will go on your permanent record.
🎧 Oh really?
🎧 Does that mean it will affect what English level I am placed in next year?
🎧 Well, not exactly.
🎧 You need a good grade to move on, but it is your overall grade
🎧 and teacher recommendation that determines what level of English you are placed in next year.
🎧 Anyway, tell me about your topic choice.
🎧 Do you play football?
🎧 Well, actually it's because my father loves the sport.
🎧 He watches it every weekend.
🎧 Cool! It's a good idea to report on something you're interested in.
🎧 I see you worked hard calling players and the head coach to talk,
🎧 so let's see what information you got.
🎧 Well, you have to listen carefully to the first call on the recording.
🎧 It's really hard to hear because the background noise is louder than the person's voice.
🎧 Yes, it is a bit tough to discern.
🎧 I'm afraid the player's answer is too short as well.
🎧 You will have to interview him again and try to get him to give a better answer.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 I thought that might happen.
🎧 I will call him again tomorrow.
🎧 Moving on, let's look back at this question.
🎧 You asked, “Tell me about a time when you learned a major life lesson through playing football,
🎧 and explain how that has shaped the person and player you have become now,
🎧 and how you hope to pass on that lesson.”
🎧 It is a great idea for a question,
🎧 but in an oral interview it is far too complex.
🎧 I would advise you to break it up into multiple parts to get a better response.
🎧 I guess you're right -
🎧 I wouldn't want to have to provide an answer to a question like that.
🎧 I will simplify it.
🎧 I found that when I asked players this question, it took too much time
🎧 because they were struggling to answer the question completely.
🎧 In fact, this is the question Joe Billings was answering when the tape ran out.
🎧 He did tend to ramble on all the questions, didn't he?
🎧 He sure did.
🎧 I would recommend that when you go back and interview players again
🎧 that you use a more sophisticated recording device.
🎧 This recording is spotty,
🎧 which indicates that the equipment wasn't working consistently.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 I guess it probably wasn't the best idea to use the sound recorder on my phone.
🎧 Hey, could you give me some feedback on the content of the report itself?
🎧 Sure!
🎧 Let's start by focusing on your topic.
🎧 While I like that you chose to cover football,
🎧 it seems inexplicit.
🎧 The keys for success of a player and team is quite an interesting topic,
🎧 but what is your thesis?
🎧 That is to say, what conclusions can you draw from your research?
🎧 I would suggest coming up with a strong thesis statement
🎧 and then shaping your report based on that.
🎧 Is it really too vague?
🎧 I put a whole lot of facts into it.
🎧 I list the top 10 goal-scorers in football history,
🎧 and later on provide statistics for a few of the most famous coaches and their records as coaches.
🎧 I think that's great that you included these facts,
🎧 but I think you focused too much on the facts
🎧 and not enough on connecting these facts to make your point.
🎧 Ah, I see. Okay.
🎧 So it looks like I have quite a bit of work to do before the deadline!
🎧 
🎧 Good morning. Today I am going to cover the daunting task of giving a quality speech -
🎧 a thought that makes most of us cringe.
🎧 In fact, 90% of all people feel nervous about public speaking,
🎧 about 10% of whom are described as genuinely terrified.
🎧 Hopefully when we are finished here today,
🎧 you all will be in the 10% of the population who do not feel nervous at all.
🎧 Did you know that lecturers tend to get more nervous if the speech they are giving is an important one?
🎧 It makes sense, right?
🎧 You probably wouldn't be nearly as nervous
🎧 to address your residence hall about the proper use of the recycle and compost bins
🎧 as you might be if you were asked to give the graduation speech
🎧 to your entire 5,000-student class.
🎧 So what is it that makes some people completely comfortable in front of crowds?
🎧 Some people think that the ability to give a good speech is a gift that others are simply born with.
🎧 This is almost never the case.
🎧 Public speaking can be learned with practice.
🎧 The first, most important thing you can do to improve your confidence in delivering a speech
🎧 is to prepare a quality speech.
🎧 Honestly, while the content of your speech is relatively important,
🎧 the audience will really only remember the last sentence you say.
🎧 It is a good idea to structure the rest of your speech
🎧 to lead up to this last point to really drive your message home.
🎧 This is a good way to ensure that your speech is well organized.
🎧 Once you are confident in the quality of the speech you have written,
🎧 the rest is just about your stage presence.
🎧 Let's go through some do's and don'ts of public speaking.
🎧 First, you want to command the attention of the room.
🎧 Do not - I repeat, do not proceed with your speech until the audience is paying attention.
🎧 Even Martin Luther King, Junior's "I Have a Dream" speech
🎧 wouldn't have made any difference in the world without the undivided attention of his audience.
🎧 To continue with the "I Have a Dream" example,
🎧 one of the reasons that MLK was such an effective orator
🎧 was his ability to speak with passion and engage with his audience.
🎧 That sort of charisma does not come from reading straight from paper.
🎧 Don't get me wrong -
🎧 it is a good idea to write your main ideas down on a note card, sheet of paper, or something.
🎧 But one factor that will consistently lead to a boring, forgettable speech
🎧 is writing down your entire speech.
🎧 Do not write your full speech down.
🎧 If you are constantly reading your paper,
🎧 you are not making eye contact with your audience,
🎧 and thus failing to really express the feeling that goes with your ideas.
🎧 I advise you write one or two ideas,
🎧 so, if you suddenly draw a blank you have something to jog your memory.
🎧 If you've written a good speech that you believe in,
🎧 those ideas should be sufficient to keep you on track.
🎧 Once you have those ideas written down,
🎧 give your speech a few practice runs in front of the mirror,
🎧 into your sound recorder on your phone,
🎧 or with a friend before it comes time to address a crowd.
🎧 That way you can hear how the ideas come across,
🎧 make sure there are no abrupt transitions,
🎧 and find out whether you're talking too fast or too slow.
🎧 Timing is important -
🎧 make sure you time yourself beforehand to see how long your speech is.
🎧 That is pretty much it!
🎧 With practice you'll be able to deliver an expert speech that engages and even maybe inspires your audience.
🎧 Just remember - speak with emotion.
🎧 No one wants to listen to someone reading from a script.
🎧 As I come to a close in my speech,
🎧 I'll point out that I have employed all of these tips that I have covered.
🎧 I practiced my speech ahead of time and timed it,
🎧 and I can even show you my one small index card with just three simple bullets on it.
🎧 It's as easy as that!
