[025] Cam4 - Test 3 - Part 1

🎧 Sara, I've heard that you want to move into a homestay family.
🎧 Is that correct?
🎧 Yes, that's right.
🎧 I've been staying with my aunt and now my cousin is arriving from Singapore
🎧 and my aunt needs the room for him.
🎧 Oh, that's bad luck.
🎧 Well, I'll need to get some particulars first.
🎧 Sara, what's your full name?
🎧 Sara Lim,
🎧 and that's Sara without the 'h' at the end.
🎧 How old are you, Sara?
🎧 23, only just.
🎧 It was my birthday on the 21st of August.
🎧 Happy birthday for yesterday.
🎧 How long have you been in Australia?
🎧 A year in Adelaide and 6 months in Sydney.
🎧 I prefer Sydney, I've got more friends here.
🎧 What's your address at your aunt's house?
🎧 Flat one, 539 Forest Road, Canterbury.
🎧 And the post code is 2036.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 What are you studying now?
🎧 I was studying General English in Adelaide
🎧 and now I'm doing Academic English,
🎧 because I'm trying to get into Medicine next year.
🎧 That sounds good, but it'll take you a long time.
🎧 When would you like to move out from your aunt's?
🎧 My cousin arrives on Friday morning,
🎧 so I'd better be out on Thursday.
🎧 What, the 7th of September?
🎧 Yes, that's right.
🎧 That doesn't leave us much time.
🎧 Right, okay.
🎧 I need to know what kind of accommodation you'd like,
🎧 so I can get you something suitable.
🎧 Can I share a room with someone else?
🎧 I've been alone in my room at my aunt's
🎧 and I've always shared with my sister and I like that.
🎧 Yes, fine.
🎧 That'll save you money too.
🎧 Would you like to live with a family or do you think that a single person would be better for you?
🎧 I have lots of very nice single people on my books.
🎧 Do you have any women living alone, retired women?
🎧 Yes, I have quite a few whose children have grown up and left home.
🎧 In fact, I have some really lovely retired ladies,
🎧 living by themselves, who just love the company of students.
🎧 Most of them live in flats, but that's not a problem for you, is it?
🎧 Not at all. I'm used to that.
🎧 My aunt lives in a flat too, remember.
🎧 I'm not used to a big house with a garden, swimming pool, pets and all that.
🎧 Okay, fine.
🎧 I know quite a bit about what you want now.
🎧 I should let you know that your rent will be 160 dollars per week.
🎧 You'll have to pay me 320 dollars as a deposit before you move in.
🎧 The deposit is as insurance, in case you break something.
🎧 You'll need to pay monthly to me, by cash or cheque, I don't mind.
🎧 You don't need to pay for gas, electricity or water,
🎧 but you will need to pay your proportion of the phone bill.
🎧 Most families do that on an honour system,
🎧 but you'll have to wait and see.
🎧 Have you got any more questions for me?
🎧 When will you know where I can go?
🎧 I'll work on it now,
🎧 so come and see me tomorrow and I should have some news for you then.
🎧 Thanks a lot.
🎧 Goodbye. See you tomorrow - after lunch would be better for me.
🎧 Okay, see you then. Bye.

[026] Cam4 - Test 3 - Part 2

🎧 Good evening,
🎧 and in this week's edition of 'Focus on the Arts',
🎧 Jane Hemmington is going to fill us in on what's in store for us at this year's Summer Festival.
🎧 Over to you, Jane.
🎧 Thank you, Geoffrey.
🎧 This year, the Summer Festival is the biggest we've ever seen,
🎧 so there should be something for everybody.
🎧 This is the third year they've run it and the timing's slightly different:
🎧 for the last couple of years it's been around the 5th to 17th,
🎧 but this year they wanted to allow everyone enough time to recover from the first of January celebrations
🎧 and they've put it at the end of the month.
🎧 The programme has sensational theatre, dance and also a large number of art exhibitions,
🎧 but the thing the Festival is most famous for is its great street music.
🎧 For today's report though, Geoffrey, I'm looking at some of the theatrical events that you might like to see;
🎧 in particular, at this year's theme - circuses.
🎧 I'm going to tell you about two circus performances,
🎧 but there are plenty of others in the programme.
🎧 I've chosen these because they represent distinct movements within circus performance.
🎧 The first is the Circus Romano from Italy.
🎧 As this is a travelling circus,
🎧 it follows a long tradition by performing in a marquee -
🎧 which is really like a canvas portable building,
🎧 usually put up in a green space or car park,
🎧 rather than in a theatre or stadium.
🎧 In spite of this, Circus Romano isn't at all like the traditional circuses I grew up with.
🎧 There are no animals - just very talented clowning and acrobatic routines.
🎧 The show has a lot of very funny moments, especially at the beginning,
🎧 but the best part is the music and lighting.
🎧 They're magical.
🎧 At forty-five dollars it's very expensive anyway -
🎧 it's really for adult tastes.
🎧 In fact, much of it would be wasted on children -
🎧 so I suggest you leave them at home.
🎧 The second circus performance is Circus Electrica at the Studio Theatre.
🎧 The purists are suggesting that this isn't a circus at all.
🎧 It's a showcase for skills in dance and magic,
🎧 rather than the usual ones you expect in a circus.
🎧 With only six performers it's a small production, which suits the venue well -
🎧 the Studio only seats about 200 people.
🎧 For my money, it's the aerial displays which are outstanding
🎧 as well as the magical tricks -
🎧 features which are missing from Circus Romano.
🎧 An interesting feature of the show is that the performers are so young -
🎧 the youngest is only 14.
🎧 But it's still well worth seeing: a good one for the whole family.
🎧 And finally, as it's summer,
🎧 you may wish to see some of the Festival performances that are being presented outdoors.
🎧 Like the famous Mekong Water Puppet Troupe,
🎧 performing in the City Gardens this week.
🎧 Now, water puppetry is amazing!
🎧 It's large puppets on long sticks,
🎧 controlled by puppeteers standing waist deep in the lake.
🎧 The puppets do comedy routines and there is some terrific formation dancing.
🎧 This is a fantastic show and the best moment comes at the end -
🎧 seeing the puppeteers.
🎧 When the troupe walks up out of the water, you get this amazing feeling.
🎧 It's really hard to believe that what you've been watching is lifeless wood and cloth.
🎧 As an adult, I had a great time,
🎧 but I did note that other older people in the audience weren't quite as taken with it as I was.
🎧 It's a must for young children though,
🎧 and that's the audience it's really aimed at.
🎧 Well, that's all I've time for today,
🎧 but I'll be back next week with more news of what's worth seeing and what it's best to miss.

[027] Cam4 - Test 3 - Part 3

🎧 Hello.
🎧 I'm Dawn Matthews.
🎧 Yes, hello.
🎧 I've been referred to you because I'm enquiring about the refresher courses that you run.
🎧 I'd like to find out a bit more about them.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 Well, we run quite a few different short courses for students who are either returning to study or studying part-time.
🎧 Um, tell me about your situation.
🎧 Well, I think that I really need some help in preparing for the coming semester,
🎧 especially to build up my confidence a bit
🎧 and help me study effectively because, you see,
🎧 I've been out in the work-force for nearly twelve years now, so...
🎧 it really is a long time since I was last a student.
🎧 Yes, it can seem like a long time, can't it?
🎧 Um, well, let me start by telling you what courses we have that might suit you.
🎧 Are you an undergraduate or a postgraduate?
🎧 Arts or Sciences?
🎧 Undergraduate, and I'm in the Business faculty.
🎧 Right then.
🎧 First of all, there's our intensive 'Study for Success' seminar
🎧 on the first and second of February.
🎧 It's aimed at students like you who are uncertain about what to expect at college,
🎧 and looks at a fairly wide range of approaches to university learning,
🎧 to motivate you to begin your study
🎧 and build on your own learning strategies.
🎧 Mm, that sounds good.
🎧 What are some of the strategies that are presented?
🎧 Well, we try to cover all aspects of study.
🎧 Some of the strategies in writing, for example,
🎧 would be improving your planning for writing,
🎧 organising your thinking
🎧 and building some techniques to help you write more clearly.
🎧 With reading, there'll be sessions aimed at getting into the habit of analysing material as you read it,
🎧 and tips to help you record and remember what you have read.
🎧 It really is very important to begin reading confidently right from the beginning.
🎧 There's also advice on how to get the most from your lectures
🎧 and practice in giving confident presentations,
🎧 as well as how to prepare for exams.
🎧 What about the motivational side of things?
🎧 Ah. Well, there's a range of motivational exercises that we do
🎧 to help the students feel positive and enthusiastic about their study.
🎧 The process of learning and exploring a subject can lead to a whole new way of looking at the world,
🎧 and the study skills and techniques that you build up
🎧 can be applied in all sorts of different ways.
🎧 Actually, I...
🎧 I'm very excited about the whole thing of taking up studying again but,
🎧 you know, I'm a little nervous about whether I'll manage to get everything done.
🎧 I suppose it's the same for all mature students?
🎧 Of course it is.
🎧 Two of the key components of the course are time management
🎧 and overcoming procrastination.
🎧 People discover that, once they learn to plan their days,
🎧 all the work can be accomplished and there'll still be time for leisure.
🎧 Is there an enrolment fee?
🎧 Well, er, oh, just a minute, let's see...
🎧 Ah, the cost is 30 pounds,
🎧 which includes all course materials and morning tea.
🎧 You have to arrange your own lunch.
🎧 That wouldn't be a problem.
🎧 I already make sandwiches for my three kids and my wife and myself every day.
🎧 I won't have to change my routine.
🎧 Now, I need to tell you that this is a very popular course
🎧 and it's essential that you book well ahead of time.
🎧 In fact, the Course Convenor tells me that there are only five places left.
🎧 What other course might be good for me?
🎧 There is one other that you could benefit from.
🎧 It's simply called 'Learning Skills for University Study'
🎧 and is on three consecutive mornings
🎧 starting on a Monday, from nine to twelve,
🎧 and costs 25 pounds.
🎧 This is aimed at upgrading the study skills most school-leavers have
🎧 and help them cope with the increased demands of university study.
🎧 It focuses mainly on making students more responsible for their own success.
🎧 What sort of things are covered in this course?
🎧 Well, basically it's more advanced thinking,
🎧 note-taking, reading and writing strategies,
🎧 but also some input about stress management.
🎧 I think I'd be better off starting from the basics and looking at all the strategies, don't you?
🎧 Yes, from what you've told me, I think that's more in line with your situation.
🎧 Alright then,
🎧 can I book a place on the 'Study for Success' seminar course now?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 Let me just get out a registration form and take down your details.

[028] Cam4 - Test 3 - Part 4

🎧 We're very grateful that the Committee has agreed that a representative for the Students' Union
🎧 can present students' suggestions about the design for the proposed new Union building.
🎧 We appreciate that some of our ideas may not be feasible in the circumstances,
🎧 but we do feel that it is important that the ultimate beneficiaries of the facilities should have some say in its design.
🎧 If I could start by briefly explaining what steps were taken to find out student opinion
🎧 and how we have arrived at conclusions.
🎧 Firstly, a meeting was held in the current Union for our SU Committee to explain the options.
🎧 Then we invited all students to submit written suggestions for the design,
🎧 placing cards in a suggestion box.
🎧 These suggestions then provided the basis for the design of a questionnaire,
🎧 which was completed by approximately 2000 of the College students
🎧 over a period of three weeks.
🎧 Finally, the SU Committee collated the results and drew up a report.
🎧 If I can just hand around a copy of that report.
🎧 This presentation is essentially a summary and discussion of the key points of this report.
🎧 So, in broad terms, the consensus was as follows.
🎧 Firstly, regarding the crucial matter of the site,
🎧 we presented the three options that you have proposed.
🎧 One: in the city centre, near the Faculty of Education;
🎧 two: on the outskirts of the city, near the park,
🎧 and three: out of town, near the halls of residence.
🎧 We asked students to cite reasons for and against these sites and,
🎧 and there was remarkable agreement on all three.
🎧 Site One was unpopular because of traffic and parking problems.
🎧 Site Two had a number of supporters,
🎧 mainly because it was close to most lecture rooms.
🎧 And Site Three, out of town, near the halls of residence,
🎧 was clearly the most popular because of access from living quarters.
🎧 It was clear that the Union was mainly to be used after lectures.
🎧 It was also felt that the larger site would allow more room for a choice of facilities.
🎧 Our second area of interest was obviously the facilities:
🎧 there was minimal interest in having a library on the premises,
🎧 but one option seemed to be a reading room instead - more useful.
🎧 We would like the current table games room to be replaced with a small gym.
🎧 And, if possible, a small swimming pool - not, of course, Olympic-sized!
🎧 There was a large number of respondents in favour of a travel agent's and insurance centre.
🎧 We also request that there be the offices of the Student Counselling Centre,
🎧 moving this from the Refectory.
🎧 There was, however, much disagreement about whether to build a drama theatre.
🎧 Just over forty per cent of the respondents were in favour,
🎧 but a largish minority were strongly against it,
🎧 claiming that it is elitist and a waste of funds.
🎧 Essentially the jury is out on that.
🎧 Finally, given the number of unfortunate incidents in the current Union over the past few months,
🎧 a strong point was repeatedly made about security.
🎧 The recommendations would be at least video surveillance
🎧 and security personnel who would check Student Union cards on request.
🎧 We doubt if it would be feasible to have a check at reception of all people coming in.
🎧 Well, this is the summary of the views of the student population.
🎧 As I say, fuller details are given in our report but
🎧 I'm happy to take any questions if...
