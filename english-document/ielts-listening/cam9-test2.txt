[101] Cam9 - Test 2 - Part 1

🎧 Good morning. Can I help you?
🎧 Yes. I've just been accepted on a course at the university
🎧 and I'd like to try and arrange accommodation in the hall of residence.
🎧 Yes, certainly.
🎧 Please sit down.
🎧 What I'll do is fill in a form with you to find out a little more about your preferences and so forth.
🎧 Thank you.
🎧 So, first of all, can I take your name?
🎧 It's Anu Bhatt.
🎧 Could you spell your name please?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 ANU... BHATT.
🎧 Thanks, and could I ask your date of birth?
🎧 The 31st March, 1972.
🎧 Thank you.
🎧 And where are you from?
🎧 India.
🎧 Oh right.
🎧 And um... what will you be studying?
🎧 I'm doing a course in nursing.
🎧 Right, thank you.
🎧 And how long would you want to stay in hall, do you think?
🎧 Well, it'll take three years
🎧 but I'd only like to stay in hall for two.
🎧 I'd like to think about living outside for the third year.
🎧 Fine.
🎧 And what did you have in mind for catering?
🎧 Do you want to cook for yourself or have all your meals provided, that's full board?
🎧 Is there something in between?
🎧 Yes. You can just have evening meal provided, which is half board.
🎧 That's what I'd prefer.
🎧 Yes, a lot of students opt for that.
🎧 Now, with that in mind, do you have any special diet, anything we should know about?
🎧 Yes, I don't take red meat.
🎧 No red meat.
🎧 Now, thinking about the room itself, we have a number of options.
🎧 You can have a single study bedroom or you can have a shared one.
🎧 These are both what we call simple rooms.
🎧 The other alternative is to opt for a single bedsit
🎧 which actually has more space and better facilities.
🎧 There's about £20 a week difference between them.
🎧 Well, actually my grant is quite generous and I think the bedsit sounds the best option.
🎧 Lovely.
🎧 I'll put you down for that and we'll see what availability is like.
🎧 Now can I ask some other personal details which we like to have on record?
🎧 Yes, of course.
🎧 I wonder if you could let us know what your interests are.
🎧 This might help us get a closer match for placing you in a particular hall.
🎧 Well. I love the theatre.
🎧 Right.
🎧 And I enjoy sports, particularly badminton.
🎧 Ah, that's worth knowing.
🎧 Now, what we finish with on the form is really a list from you of what your priorities are in choosing a hall
🎧 and we'll do our best to take these into account.
🎧 Well, the first thing is I'd prefer a hall where there are other mature students, if possible.
🎧 Yes, we do have halls which tend to cater for slightly older students.
🎧 Ummm and I'd prefer to be out of town.
🎧 That's actually very good for you because we tend to have more vacancies in out-of-town halls.
🎧 Lucky!
🎧 Yes.
🎧 Anything else?
🎧 Well, I would like somewhere with a shared area, a TV room for example, or something like that.
🎧 It's a good way to socialise.
🎧 Certainly is.
🎧 That's it.
🎧 Now, we just need a contact telephone number for you.
🎧 Sure, I'll just find it.
🎧 It's 667549.
🎧 Great, so we'll be in contact with you as soon as possible...

[102] Cam9 - Test 2 - Part 2

🎧 Hello,
🎧 I'm delighted to welcome you to our Wildlife Club,
🎧 and very pleased that you're interested in the countryside
🎧 and the plants and creatures of this area.
🎧 I think you'll be surprised at the variety we have here,
🎧 even though we're not far from London.
🎧 I'll start by telling you about some of the parks and open spaces nearby.
🎧 One very pleasant place is Halland Common.
🎧 This has been public land for hundreds of years,
🎧 and what you'll find interesting is that the River Ouse, which flows into the sea eighty kilometres away,
🎧 has its source in the common.
🎧 There's an information board about the plants and animals you can see here,
🎧 and by the way, the common is accessible 24 hours a day.
🎧 Then there's Holt Island, which is noted for its great range of trees.
🎧 In the past willows were grown here commercially for basket-making,
🎧 and this ancient craft has recently been reintroduced.
🎧 The island is only open to the public from Friday to Sunday,
🎧 because it's quite small,
🎧 and if there were people around every day, much of the wildlife would keep away.
🎧 From there it's just a short walk across the bridge to Longfield Country Park.
🎧 Longfield has a modern replica of a farm from over two thousand years ago.
🎧 Children's activities are often arranged there, like bread-making and face-painting.
🎧 The park is only open during daylight hours, so bear that in mind if you decide to go there.
🎧 Longfield Park has a programme of activities throughout the year,
🎧 and to give you a sample, this is what's happening in the next few days.
🎧 On Monday you can learn about herbs, and how they've been used over the centuries.
🎧 You'll start with a tour of our herb garden,
🎧 practise the technique of using them as colour dyes for cloth,
🎧 and listen to an illustrated talk about their use in cooking and medicine.
🎧 Then on Wednesday you can join local experts to discover the variety of insects and birds that appear in the evening.
🎧 We keep to a small number of people in the group,
🎧 so if you want to go, you'll need to phone the park ranger a few days ahead.
🎧 There's a small charge, which you should pay when you turn up.
🎧 I'm sure you're all keen to help with the practical task of looking after the park,
🎧 so on Saturday you can join a working party.
🎧 You'll have a choice of all sorts of activities, from planting hedges to picking up litter,
🎧 so you'll be able to change from one to another when you feel like it.
🎧 The rangers will be hard at work all day,
🎧 but do come and join in, even for just a short while.
🎧 One thing, though, is to make sure you're wearing something that you don't mind getting dirty or torn.
🎧 And finally I'd like to tell you about our new wildlife area, Hinchingbrooke Park,
🎧 which will be opened to the public next month.
🎧 This slide doesn't really indicate how big it is,
🎧 but anyway, you can see the two gates into the park, and the main paths.
🎧 As you can see, there's a lake in the north west of the park,
🎧 with a bird hide to the west of it, at the end of a path.
🎧 So it'll be a nice quiet place for watching the birds on the lake.
🎧 Fairly close to where refreshments are available,
🎧 there's a dog-walking area in the southern part of the park, leading off from the path.
🎧 And if you just want to sit and relax, you can go to the flower garden;
🎧 that's the circular area on the map surrounded by paths.
🎧 And finally, there's a wooded area in the western section of the park, between two paths.
🎧 Okay, that's enough from me, so let's...

[103] Cam9 - Test 2 - Part 3

🎧 Hi Jun.
🎧 As you know, I've asked you here today to discuss the future of our Self-Access Centre.
🎧 We have to decide what we want to do about this very important resource for our English language students.
🎧 So, can you tell me what the students think about this?
🎧 Well, from the students' point of view, we would like to keep it.
🎧 The majority of students say that they enjoy using it
🎧 because it provides a variation on the classroom routine
🎧 and they see it as a pretty major component of their course,
🎧 but we would like to see some improvements to the equipment, particularly the computers;
🎧 there aren't enough for one each at the moment and we always have to share.
🎧 Well, yes, the teachers agree that it is a very valuable resource
🎧 but one thing we have noticed is that a lot of the students are using it to check their personal emails.
🎧 We don't want to stop you students using it,
🎧 but we think the computers should be used as a learning resource, not for emails.
🎧 Some of us also think that we could benefit a lot more by relocating the Self-Access Centre
🎧 to the main University library building.
🎧 How do you think the students would feel about that, Jun?
🎧 Well, the library is big enough to incorporate the Self-Access Centre,
🎧 but it wouldn't be like a class activity anymore.
🎧 Our main worry would be not being able to go to a teacher for advice.
🎧 I'm sure there would be plenty of things to do
🎧 but we really need teachers to help us choose the best activities.
🎧 Well, there would still be a teacher present and he or she would guide the activities of the students,
🎧 we wouldn't just leave them to get on with it.
🎧 Yes, but I think the students would be much happier keeping the existing set-up;
🎧 they really like going to the Self-Access Centre with their teacher
🎧 and staying together as a group to do activities.
🎧 If we could just improve the resources and facilities, I think it would be fine.
🎧 Is the cost going to be a problem?
🎧 It's not so much the expense that I'm worried about,
🎧 and we've certainly got room to do it,
🎧 but it's the problem of timetabling a teacher to be in there outside class hours.
🎧 If we're going to spend a lot of money on equipment and resources,
🎧 we really need to make sure that everything is looked after properly.
🎧 Anyway, let's make some notes to see just what needs doing to improve the Centre.
🎧 Now, what about the computers?
🎧 I think it might be a good idea to install some new models.
🎧 They would take up a lot less room
🎧 and so that would increase the work space for text books and so on.
🎧 That would be great.
🎧 It is a bit cramped in there at times.
🎧 What about other resources?
🎧 Do you have a list of things that the students would like to see improved?
🎧 Yes, one of the comments that students frequently make
🎧 is that they find it difficult to find materials that are appropriate for their level,
🎧 especially reading resources,
🎧 so I think we need to label them more clearly.
🎧 Well, that's easy enough, we can get that organised very quickly.
🎧 In fact, I think we should review all of the study resources as some of them are looking a bit out-of-date.
🎧 Definitely.
🎧 The CD section especially needs to be more current.
🎧 I think we should get some of the ones that go with our latest course books
🎧 and also make multiple copies.
🎧 Good.
🎧 Now, I was also thinking about some different materials that we haven't got in there at all.
🎧 What do you think of the idea of introducing some workbooks?
🎧 If we break them up into separate pages and laminate them,
🎧 they'd be a great resource.
🎧 The students could study the main course book in class
🎧 and then do follow-up practice in the Self-Access Centre.
🎧 That sounds good.
🎧 Okay, now, finally we need to think about how the room is used.
🎧 I'll have to talk to the teachers
🎧 and make sure we can all reach some agreement on a timetable to supervise the centre after class.
🎧 But we also need to think about security, too.
🎧 Especially if we're going to invest in some new equipment.
🎧 Umm... what about putting in an alarm?
🎧 Good idea.
🎧 The other thing I'd like to do is talk to our technicians
🎧 and see whether we could somehow limit the access to email.
🎧 I really don't want to see that resource misused.
🎧 What about if we agree to only use it before and after class?
🎧 Yes, that would be fine.
🎧 OK, anyway...that's great for now.
🎧 We'll discuss it further when we've managed...

[104] Cam9 - Test 2 - Part 4

🎧 Good morning everyone.
🎧 Now whether you're going to university to study business or some other subject,
🎧 many of you will eventually end up working for a company of some kind.
🎧 Now, when you first start working somewhere you will realise that the organisation you've joined has certain characteristics.
🎧 And we often refer to these social characteristics as the culture of the organisation.
🎧 This includes its unwritten ideas, beliefs, values and things like that.
🎧 One well known writer has classified company cultures by identifying four major types.
🎧 The first type is called the Power Culture,
🎧 and it's usually found in small organisations.
🎧 It's the type of culture that needs a central source of power to be effective,
🎧 and because control is in the hands of just one or two people,
🎧 there aren't many rules or procedures.
🎧 Another characteristic is that communication usually takes the form of conversations
🎧 rather than, say, formal meetings or written memos.
🎧 Now one of the benefits of this culture is that the organisation has the ability to act quickly,
🎧 so it responds well to threat, or danger on the one hand, and opportunity on the other.
🎧 But on the negative side, this type of organisation doesn't always act effectively,
🎧 because it depends too much on one or two people at the top,
🎧 and when these people make poor decisions, there's no-one else who can influence them.
🎧 And the kind of person who does well in this type of business culture is one who is happy to take risks,
🎧 and for whom job security is a low priority.
🎧 The next type is known as Role Culture -
🎧 that's ROLE, not ROLL, by the way,
🎧 and this type is usually found in large companies,
🎧 which have lots of different levels in them.
🎧 These organisations usually have separate departments
🎧 that specialise in things like finance, or sales, or maintenance, or whatever.
🎧 Each one is co-ordinated at the top by a small group of senior managers,
🎧 and typically everyone's job is controlled by sets of rules and procedures.
🎧 For example, there are specific job descriptions, rules for discipline, and so on.
🎧 What are the benefits of this kind of culture?
🎧 Well firstly, because it's found in large organisations,
🎧 its fixed costs, or overheads as they're known, are low in relation to its output, or what it produces.
🎧 In other words it can achieve economies of scale.
🎧 And secondly, it is particularly successful in business markets where technical expertise is important.
🎧 On the other hand, this culture is often very slow to recognise the need for change,
🎧 and even slower to react.
🎧 What kind of person does this type of culture suit?
🎧 Well, it suits employees who value security,
🎧 and who don't particularly want to have responsibility.
🎧 Moving on now to Task Cultures.
🎧 This type is found in organisations that are project-oriented.
🎧 You usually find it where the market for the company's product is extremely competitive,
🎧 or where the products themselves have a short life-span.
🎧 Usually top management delegates the projects, the people and other resources.
🎧 And once these have been allocated, little day-to-day control is exercised from the top,
🎧 because this would seem like breaking the rules'.
🎧 Now one of the major benefits of this culture is that it's flexible.
🎧 But it does have some major disadvantages too.
🎧 For instance, it can't produce economies of scale or great depth of expertise.
🎧 People who like working in groups or teams prefer this type of culture.
🎧 And finally, the fourth category is called the Person Culture...
