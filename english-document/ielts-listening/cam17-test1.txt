🎧 Hello?
🎧 Oh hello. My name's Jan.
🎧 Are you the right person to talk to about the Buckworth Conservation Group?
🎧 Yes, I'm Peter. I'm the secretary.
🎧 Good. I've just moved to this area, and I'm interested in getting involved.
🎧 I was in a similar group where I used to live.
🎧 Could you tell me something about your activities, please?
🎧 Of course.
🎧 Well, we have a mixture of regular activities and special events.
🎧 One of the regular ones is trying to keep the beach free of litter.
🎧 A few of us spend a couple of hours a month on it,
🎧 and it's awful how much there is to clear.
🎧 I wish people would be more responsible and take it home with them.
🎧 I totally agree.
🎧 I'd be happy to help with that.
🎧 Is it OK to take dogs?
🎧 I'm afraid not, as they're banned from the beach itself.
🎧 You can take them along the cliffs, though. And children are welcome.
🎧 Right.
🎧 We also manage a nature reserve, and there's a lot to do there all year round.
🎧 For example, because it's a popular place to visit,
🎧 we spend a lot of time looking after the paths
🎧 and making sure they're in good condition for walking.
🎧 I could certainly help with that.
🎧 Good.
🎧 And we have a programme of creating new habitats there.
🎧 We've just finished making and installing nesting boxes for birds to use,
🎧 and next we're going to work on encouraging insects,
🎧 they're important for the biodiversity of the reserve.
🎧 They certainly are.
🎧 Oh, and we're also running a project to identify the different species of butterflies that visit the reserve.
🎧 You might be interested in taking part in that.
🎧 Sure.
🎧 I was involved in something similar where I used to live,
🎧 counting all the species of moths.
🎧 I'd enjoy that.
🎧 Another job we're doing at the reserve is replacing the wall on the southern side,
🎧 between the parking area and our woodshed.
🎧 It was badly damaged in a storm last month.
🎧 OK.
🎧 Then as I said, we have a programme of events as well, both at the weekend, and during the week.
🎧 Right.
🎧 I presume you have guided walks?
🎧 I'd like to get to know the local countryside, as I'm new to the area.
🎧 Yes, we do. The next walk is to Ruston Island, a week on Saturday.
🎧 We'll be meeting in the car park at Dunsmore Beach at low tide,
🎧 that's when the sands are dry enough for us to walk to the island without getting wet.
🎧 Sounds good.
🎧 The island's a great place to explore.
🎧 It's quite small, and it's got a range of habitats.
🎧 It's also an ideal location for seeing seals just off the coast, or even on the beach.
🎧 OK.
🎧 And is there anything we should bring, like a picnic, for instance?
🎧 Yes, do bring one, as it's a full-day walk.
🎧 And of course it'll be wet walking across and back,
🎧 so make sure your boots are waterproof.
🎧 I must buy a new pair, there's a hole in one of my current ones!
🎧 Well, I'd definitely like to come on the walk.
🎧 Great.
🎧 Then later this month we're having a one-day woodwork session in Hopton Wood.
🎧 I've never tried that before.
🎧 Is it OK for beginners to take part?
🎧 Definitely.
🎧 There'll be a couple of experts leading the session,
🎧 and we keep the number of participants down, so you'll get as much help as you need.
🎧 Excellent!
🎧 I'd love to be able to make chairs.
🎧 That's probably too ambitious for one day!
🎧 You'll be starting with wooden spoons,
🎧 and of course learning how to use the tools.
🎧 And anything you make is yours to take home with you.
🎧 That sounds like fun.
🎧 When is it?
🎧 It's on the 17th, from 10 a.m. until 3.
🎧 There's a charge of £35, including lunch
🎧 or £40 if you want to camp in the wood.
🎧 I should think I'll come home the same day.
🎧 Well, I'd certainly like to join the group.
🎧 
🎧 So, hello everyone.
🎧 My name's Lou Miller and I'm going to be your tour guide today
🎧 as we take this fantastic boat trip around the Tasmanian coast.
🎧 Before we set off, I just want to tell you a few things about our journey.
🎧 Our boats aren't huge as you can see.
🎧 We already have three staff members on board
🎧 and on top of that,
🎧 we can transport a further fifteen people, that's you - around the coastline.
🎧 But please note if there are more than nine people on either side of the boat,
🎧 we'll move some of you over, otherwise all eighteen of us will end up in the sea!
🎧 We've recently upgraded all our boats.
🎧 They used to be jet black,
🎧 but our new ones now have these comfortable dark red seats and a light-green exterior
🎧 in order to stand out from others and help promote our company.
🎧 This gives our boats a rather unique appearance, don't you think?
🎧 We offer you a free lunchbox during the trip
🎧 and we have three types.
🎧 Lunchbox 1 contains ham and tomato sandwiches.
🎧 Lunchbox 2 contains a cheddar cheese roll
🎧 and Lunchbox 3 is salad-based and also contains eggs and tuna.
🎧 All three lunchboxes also have a packet of crisps and chocolate bar inside.
🎧 Please let staff know which lunchbox you prefer.
🎧 I'm sure I don't have to ask you not to throw anything into the sea.
🎧 We don't have any bins to put litter in,
🎧 but Jess, myself or Ray, our other guide, will collect it from you after lunch
🎧 and put it all in a large plastic sack.
🎧 The engine on the boat makes quite a lot of noise so before we head off,
🎧 let me tell you a few things about what you're going to see.
🎧 This area is famous for its ancient lighthouse,
🎧 which you'll see from the boat as we turn past the first little island.
🎧 It was built in 1838 to protect sailors
🎧 as a number of shipwrecks had led to significant loss of life.
🎧 The construction itself was complicated
🎧 as some of the original drawings kept by the local council show.
🎧 It sits right on top of the cliffs in a very isolated spot.
🎧 In the nineteenth century there were many jobs there,
🎧 such as polishing the brass lamps,
🎧 chopping firewood and cleaning windows, that kept lighthouse keepers busy.
🎧 These workers were mainly prison convicts until the middle of that century
🎧 when ordinary families willing to live in such circumstances took over.
🎧 Some of you have asked me what creatures we can expect to see.
🎧 I know everyone loves the penguins,
🎧 but they're very shy and, unfortunately, tend to hide from passing boats,
🎧 but you might see birds in the distance, such as sea eagles,
🎧 flying around the cliff edges where they nest.
🎧 When we get to the rocky area inhabited by fur seals,
🎧 we'll stop and watch them swimming around the coast.
🎧 They're inquisitive creatures so don't be surprised if one pops up right in front of you.
🎧 Their predators, orca whales, hunt along the coastline too,
🎧 but spotting one of these is rare.
🎧 Dolphins, on the other hand,
🎧 can sometimes approach on their own or in groups as they ride the waves beside us.
🎧 Lastly, I want to mention the caves.
🎧 Tasmania is famous for its caves
🎧 and the ones we'll pass by are so amazing that people are lost for words when they see them.
🎧 They can only be approached by sea.
🎧 but if you feel that you want to see more than we're able to show you,
🎧 then you can take a kayak into the area on another day
🎧 and one of our staff will give you more information on that.
🎧 What we'll do is to go through a narrow channel,
🎧 past some incredible rock formations
🎧 and from there we'll be able to see the openings to the caves,
🎧 and at that point we'll talk to you about what lies beyond.
🎧 
🎧 So, Tim, we have to do a short summary of our work experience on a farm.
🎧 Right. My farm was great,
🎧 but arranging the work experience was hard.
🎧 One problem was it was miles away and I don't drive.
🎧 And also, I'd really wanted a placement for a month,
🎧 but I could only get one for two weeks.
🎧 I was lucky,
🎧 the farmer let me stay on the farm so I didn't have to travel.
🎧 But finding the right sort of farm to apply to wasn't easy.
🎧 No, they don't seem to have websites, do they.
🎧 I found mine through a friend of my mother's, but it wasn't easy.
🎧 No.
🎧 My farm was mostly livestock, especially sheep.
🎧 I really enjoyed helping out with them.
🎧 I was up most of one night helping a sheep deliver a lamb...
🎧 On your own?
🎧 No, the farmer was there,
🎧 and he told me what to do.
🎧 It wasn't a straightforward birth, but I managed.
🎧 It was a great feeling to see the lamb stagger to its feet and start feeding almost straightaway,
🎧 and to know that it was OK.
🎧 Then another time a lamb had broken its leg,
🎧 and they got the vet in to set it,
🎧 and he talked me through what he was doing.
🎧 That was really useful.
🎧 Yes, my farm had sheep too.
🎧 The farm was in a valley and they had a lowland breed called Suffolks,
🎧 although the farmer said they'd had other breeds in the past.
🎧 So were they bred for their meat?
🎧 Mostly, yes.
🎧 They're quite big and solid.
🎧 My farm was up in the hills and they had a different breed of sheep,
🎧 they were Cheviots.
🎧 Oh, I heard their wool's really sought after.
🎧 Yes. It's very hardwearing and they use it for carpets.
🎧 Right.
🎧 I was interested in the amount of supplements they add to animals' feed nowadays.
🎧 Like, even the chickens got extra vitamins and electrolytes in their feed.
🎧 Yes, I found that too.
🎧 And they're not cheap.
🎧 But my farmer said some are overpriced for what they are.
🎧 And he didn't give them as a matter of routine,
🎧 just at times when the chickens seemed to particularly require them.
🎧 Yes, mine said the same.
🎧 He said certain breeds of chickens might need more supplements than the others,
🎧 but the cheap and expensive ones are all basically the same.
🎧 So did your farm have any other livestock, Diana?
🎧 Yes, dairy cows.
🎧 I made a really embarrassing mistake when I was working in the milk shed.
🎧 Some cows had been treated with antibiotics,
🎧 so their milk wasn't suitable for human consumption,
🎧 and it had to be put in a separate container.
🎧 But I got mixed up,
🎧 and I poured some milk from the wrong cow in with the milk for humans,
🎧 so the whole lot had to be thrown away.
🎧 The farmer wasn't too happy with me.
🎧 I asked my farmer how much he depended on the vet to deal with health problems.
🎧 I'd read reports that the livestock's health is being affected
🎧 as farmers are under pressure to increase production.
🎧 Well, he didn't agree with that,
🎧 but he said that actually some of the stuff the vets do, like minor operations,
🎧 he'd be quite capable of doing himself.
🎧 Yeah. My farmer said the same.
🎧 But he reckons vets' skills are still needed.
🎧 Now we've got to give a bit of feedback about last term's modules,
🎧 just short comments, apparently.
🎧 Shall we do that now?
🎧 OK.
🎧 So medical terminology.
🎧 Well, my heart sank when I saw that,
🎧 especially right at the beginning of the course.
🎧 And I did struggle with it.
🎧 I thought it'd be hard,
🎧 but actually I found it all quite straightforward.
🎧 What did you think about diet and nutrition?
🎧 OK, I suppose.
🎧 Do you remember what they told us about pet food
🎧 and the fact that there's such limited checking into whether or not it's contaminated?
🎧 I mean in comparison with the checks on food for humans,
🎧 I thought that was terrible.
🎧 I think the module that really impressed me was the animal disease one,
🎧 when we looked at domesticated animals in different parts of the world,
🎧 like camels and water buffalo and alpaca.
🎧 The economies of so many countries depend on these,
🎧 but scientists don't know much about the diseases that affect them.
🎧 Yes,
🎧 I thought they'd know a lot about ways of controlling and eradicating those diseases,
🎧 but that's not the case at all.
🎧 I loved the wildlife medication unit.
🎧 Things like helping birds that have been caught in oil spills.
🎧 That's something I hadn't thought about before.
🎧 Yeah, I thought I might write my dissertation on something connected with that.
🎧 Right. So, actually I was thinking...
🎧 
🎧 Labyrinths have existed for well over 4,000 years.
🎧 Labyrinths and labyrinthine symbols have been found in regions as diverse as modern-day Turkey,
🎧 Ireland, Greece, and India
🎧 There are various designs of labyrinth
🎧 but what they all have in common is a winding spiral path which leads to a central area
🎧 There is one starting point at the entrance and the goal is to reach the central area.
🎧 Finding your way through a labyrinth involves many twists and turns,
🎧 but it's not possible to get lost as there is only one single path.
🎧 In modern times, the word labyrinth has taken on a different meaning
🎧 and is often used as a synonym for a maze.
🎧 A maze is quite different
🎧 as it is a kind of puzzle with an intricate network of paths.
🎧 Mazes became fashionable in the 15th and 16th centuries in Europe,
🎧 and can still be found in the gardens of great houses and palaces.
🎧 The paths are usually surrounded by thick, high hedges so that it's not possible to see over them.
🎧 Entering a maze usually involves getting lost a few times
🎧 before using logic to work out the pattern and find your way to the centre and then out again.
🎧 There are lots of dead ends and paths which lead you back to where you started.
🎧 The word 'maze' is believed to come from a Scandinavian word for a state of confusion.
🎧 This is where the word 'amazing' comes from.
🎧 Labyrinths, on the other hand, have a very different function.
🎧 Although people now often refer to things they find complicated as labyrinths,
🎧 this is not how they were seen in the past.
🎧 The winding spiral of the labyrinth has been used for centuries as a metaphor for life's journey.
🎧 It served as a spiritual reminder that there is purpose and meaning to our lives
🎧 and helped to give people a sense of direction.
🎧 Labyrinths are thought to encourage a feeling of calm
🎧 and have been used as a meditation and prayer tool in many cultures over many centuries.
🎧 The earliest examples of the labyrinth spiral pattern have been found carved into stone,
🎧 from Sardinia to Scandinavia, from Arizona to India to Africa.
🎧 In Europe, these spiral carvings date from the late Bronze Age.
🎧 The Native American Pima tribe wove baskets with a circular labyrinth design that depicted their own cosmology.
🎧 In Ancient Greece, the labyrinth spiral was used on coins around 4000 years ago.
🎧 Labyrinths made of mosaics were commonly found in bathhouses,
🎧 villas and tombs throughout the Roman Empire.
🎧 In Northern Europe, there were actual physical labyrinths designed for walking on.
🎧 These were cut into the turf or grass, usually in a circular pattern.
🎧 The origin of these walking labyrinths remains unclear,
🎧 but they were probably used for fertility rites
🎧 which may date back thousands of years.
🎧 Eleven examples of turf labyrinths survive today,
🎧 including the largest one at Saffron Walden, England,
🎧 which used to have a large tree in the middle of it.
🎧 More recently labyrinths have experienced something of a revival.
🎧 Some believe that walking a labyrinth promotes healing and mindfulness,
🎧 and there are those who believe in its emotional and physical benefits,
🎧 which include slower breathing
🎧 and a restored sense of balance and perspective.
🎧 This idea has become so popular that labyrinths have been laid into the floors of spas, wellness centres
🎧 and even prisons in recent years.
🎧 A pamphlet at Colorado Children's Hospital informs patients that
🎧 'walking a labyrinth can often calm people in the midst of a crisis'.
🎧 And apparently, it's not only patients who benefit.
🎧 Many visitors find walking a labyrinth less stressful than sitting in a corridor or waiting room.
🎧 Some doctors even walk the labyrinth during their breaks.
🎧 In some hospitals, patients who can't walk
🎧 can have a paper 'finger labyrinth' brought to their bed.
🎧 The science behind the theory is a little sketchy,
🎧 but there are dozens of small-scale studies which support claims about the benefits of labyrinths.
🎧 For example, one study found that walking a labyrinth provided 'short-term calming,
🎧 relaxation, and relief from anxiety' for Alzheimer's patients.
🎧 So, what is it about labyrinths that makes their appeal so universal?...
