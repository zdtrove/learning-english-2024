🎧 Hi Shannon, how are you settling into your new flat?
🎧 Really well, thanks.
🎧 You look like you're going shopping.
🎧 Yes, I am.
🎧 My cousins are coming to stay for a couple of days, and I have to cook for them.
🎧 Well, there are plenty of places to buy food in Kite Place,
🎧 it's the area by the harbour.
🎧 Oh, okay, I'll find that on the map.
🎧 Thanks.
🎧 What sort of food do you need to get?
🎧 Well, neither of them eats meat but they both like fish.
🎧 Well, there's a really good fish market there.
🎧 Oh great!
🎧 Where is it exactly?
🎧 It's at the far end of Kite Place,
🎧 so you have to go over the bridge and then it's on the right.
🎧 Okay, is it open all day?
🎧 It doesn't close until four,
🎧 but I'd recommend going earlier than that,
🎧 it does run out of some things.
🎧 Oh, I don't want that to happen.
🎧 As long as you get there by 3:30, you should be fine.
🎧 It's only 11 now, so plenty of time.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Do you need to buy vegetables too?
🎧 I do, and I want to avoid all the plastic packaging in the supermarket!
🎧 Well, there's a really nice organic shop there.
🎧 Now what's it called...
🎧 It's the name of a flower.
🎧 I know, it's 'Rose'.
🎧 Oh, that's a nice name.
🎧 Yeah, it sells vegetables and quite a lot of other stuff.
🎧 And where's that?
🎧 Well, as you reach the market,
🎧 you'll see a big grey building on your left,
🎧 I think it used to be a warehouse.
🎧 Anyway, now it's a restaurant upstairs,
🎧 but the ground floor has two shops either side of the entrance and it's the one on the left.
🎧 That's easy enough.
🎧 You can't miss it,
🎧 there's also a big sign on the pavement so you can look for that.
🎧 Fine!
🎧 I guess if I need anything else, I'll have to go to the supermarket.
🎧 Yeah, you should be able to get everything you need,
🎧 but there's a minibus that goes to the supermarket if you need it.
🎧 It's purple and the number is 289.
🎧 Thanks, that's great.
🎧 So what do you need to get at the fish market?
🎧 The salmon is always very good and the shellfish...
🎧 I'm going to make a curry, I think,
🎧 and I need about 12 prawns for that.
🎧 They'll have plenty of those.
🎧 Have you ever tried samphire?
🎧 No, what's that?
🎧 It's a type of seaweed.
🎧 I just ask for a handful and you fry it in butter.
🎧 It's delicious!
🎧 Oh, I might try that,
🎧 how do you spell it?
🎧 It's SAMPHIRE.
🎧 Great! It's always good to try something different.
🎧 I'll see what beans they have in the organic shop
🎧 and I think I'll get something for dessert there.
🎧 How about a mango?
🎧 I'm not sure, they're not always ripe.
🎧 I'd prefer a melon, it's bigger too.
🎧 Good idea.
🎧 The owner also sells a lot of spices there that you can put in a curry,
🎧 and things like coconut.
🎧 Oh, that's very helpful.
🎧 I'll have a look.
🎧 No problem.
🎧 I know bread doesn't really go with curry
🎧 but I always like to have some in case.
🎧 As I said, all the bread is home-made and there's lots of variety.
🎧 I like the brown bread myself.
🎧 Mm, sounds good.
🎧 They sell other things there too.
🎧 Like cakes?
🎧 I love chocolate cake.
🎧 Well, not that,
🎧 but they have a whole range of tarts
🎧 and the best are the strawberry ones.
🎧 Perfect!
🎧 Hopefully I won't even have to go to the supermarket!
🎧 
🎧 The children's book festival is coming up again soon
🎧 and here to tell us all about it is the festival's organiser, Jenny Morgan.
🎧 So tell us what we can expect this year, Jenny.
🎧 Well, as usual we've got five days of action-packed exciting events for children,
🎧 with writers coming from all over the country getting involved.
🎧 Just to give you an idea of what's on offer in the workshops,
🎧 first of all, there's a very special event called Superheroes.
🎧 This is a chance for deaf children to share their reading experiences with author Madeleine Gordon,
🎧 who is herself hearing impaired.
🎧 'Just do it' is a practical workshop led by the well-known illustrator Mark Keane.
🎧 He'll take participants on a magical journey to faraway lands
🎧 with an opportunity for aspiring actors to do some role play.
🎧 'Count on me' is an inspiring and entertaining look at the issues of friendship for 13 to 14-year-olds.
🎧 It looks at some of the friendships described in popular books
🎧 and asks participants to compare these with their own experiences.
🎧 'Speak up' is part of a series of workshops on the subject of mental health.
🎧 This is a creative writing workshop encouraging children to describe situations
🎧 where young people experience loneliness.
🎧 A recent survey revealed that children can be lonely
🎧 even when they're at home with their families.
🎧 'Jump for joy', as many of you will know,
🎧 is the heart-warming, best-selling story by Nina Karan
🎧 about a young girl's trip to visit her relatives in India.
🎧 It recently received the gold medal at the Waterford Awards.
🎧 Nina will get children to celebrate the word 'joy' by writing a poem.
🎧 'Sticks and stones' is the beautifully illustrated picture book for young readers
🎧 about a community who organise an African-Caribbean festival
🎧 to help local children learn about their Jamaican roots.
🎧 This will be a musical event where children will have the chance to play steel drums.
🎧 This is bound to be very popular, so please book as soon as possible.
🎧 Thanks Jenny. That all sounds really interesting.
🎧 I'm just wondering if you have a favourite book you could recommend for our readers?
🎧 It's hard to choose, but 'Alive and Kicking' is definitely worth mentioning.
🎧 You won't have heard of the writer as it's her first book - which is really impressive.
🎧 It's basically the teenage diary of a boy from Somalia who comes to live in the UK.
🎧 It deals with the serious issue of immigration
🎧 and all the challenges the boy has to face at school and with the language barrier, etc.
🎧 Usually, books like this are quite sad,
🎧 but this one actually made me cry with laughter.
🎧 On each page, there are simple but hilarious black and white stick drawings of the boy with his friends and teachers.
🎧 At the end of each diary entry, there are new English words the boy learns each day,
🎧 which may help develop some children's vocabulary.
🎧 I think my kids would enjoy that.
🎧 What about any advice for parents on how to encourage their children to read more?
🎧 Well, this is something I get asked about a lot.
🎧 There are so many distractions for kids these days that it can be hard to find time for reading.
🎧 One thing I'd say is to make time to sit down with your child and share books with them.
🎧 A lot of parents give up reading aloud to their children as soon as they learn to read independently,
🎧 but this is a mistake.
🎧 It's good to read more advanced books to them as it helps to develop their vocabulary.
🎧 If you don't have time for this, then let them listen to audio books.
🎧 Often, they'll want to read books they've listened to for themselves.
🎧 I think it's a good idea to make a mental note of the type of books your child is reading.
🎧 Often, they just read the same genre all the time, which can get a bit boring.
🎧 You can introduce new authors and genres to them.
🎧 Librarians should be able to help you with this.
🎧 Well Jenny, I think...
🎧 
🎧 Hi Jake.
🎧 How are you getting on with the practical teaching?
🎧 Ah... it's harder than I expected, but I've got some great classes.
🎧 How about you?
🎧 Not brilliant.
🎧 I'm really struggling with my Year 12 science class.
🎧 Are they hard to control?
🎧 Well, I don't have discipline problems as such.
🎧 It's just that they don't seem to think that science has anything to do with their lives.
🎧 It's depressing.
🎧 They listen to what I say,
🎧 and I gave them a test last week and the results weren't too bad,
🎧 but there's no real engagement.
🎧 Right.
🎧 And as part of my teaching practice, I have to design an experiment for them to do.
🎧 I was wondering about something on the children's diets...
🎧 You know, asking them to record what they eat and maybe linking it to their state of health.
🎧 Mmm. Let's think.
🎧 So your methodology would involve the children recording what they eat.
🎧 Okay, but you'd also need to have access to the children's medical records
🎧 and I don't think people would be happy about that;
🎧 confidentiality would be an issue.
🎧 If you could get the right data, the conclusions might be significant,
🎧 but I suspect it's not going to be easy.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Have you thought about doing an experiment using animals?
🎧 Wouldn't that be upsetting for the children?
🎧 Well, the animals don't have to be harmed in any way.
🎧 It could just be an experiment where they're given a certain diet and the effects are observed.
🎧 Would I have to get permission to use animals?
🎧 Yes, you'd have to submit an outline of the experiment and fill in a form,
🎧 but it's quite straightforward.
🎧 But if we found out that, say, a particular diet affects the health of animals,
🎧 the same thing wouldn't necessarily be true for people, would it?
🎧 No, that's true,
🎧 but the findings for any experiment are going to be limited.
🎧 It's inevitable.
🎧 I suppose so.
🎧 So what animals could I use to investigate the effects of diet?
🎧 Mice?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 You'd need experimental mice - ones that have been specially bred for experiments.
🎧 Okay, so what will your experiment be investigating exactly?
🎧 Well, something to do with nutrition.
🎧 So maybe we could look at food supplements...
🎧 Things like extra iron and extra protein, and their impact on health.
🎧 Mmm. That might be rather broad.
🎧 Maybe just look at the effects of one supplement, like sugar, on the health of the mice?
🎧 In fact, maybe the focus could be on whether mice can control their own diet.
🎧 So, what happens when they have access to more sugar that they don't really need?
🎧 Exactly.
🎧 Do they eat it or do they decide to leave it?
🎧 Great.
🎧 Then later on, you could do a follow-up experiment adding another variable.
🎧 Like, you could give some of the mice the chance to be more active,
🎧 running on a wheel or something,
🎧 and the others just sit around and don't do much.
🎧 Or I could repeat the experiment but change the type of food I provided...
🎧 or use mice with a different genetic structure.
🎧 But I think your idea would be more interesting,
🎧 I might think about that some more.
🎧 So can I talk through a possible procedure for the experiment where mice are given a sugar supplement?
🎧 Sure.
🎧 I did a similar experiment in college actually.
🎧 Great.
🎧 So how many mice would I need?
🎧 I'd say about 12.
🎧 And all young ones, not a mixture of old and young.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 And I'd need two groups of equal sizes, so six in each group.
🎧 And how would I tell them apart?
🎧 I suppose I could put some sort of tag on one group... or just mark them in some way?
🎧 You could use food colouring, that wouldn't hurt them.
🎧 Perfect.
🎧 Then each group would go into a separate cage,
🎧 and one group, let's call them group A, would be the control group.
🎧 So they'd just have ordinary mouse food.
🎧 I suppose you can buy that?
🎧 Yes, it comes in dry pellets.
🎧 And the other group would have the same as the first group,
🎧 but they'd also have the extra sugar.
🎧 Would you just give them straight sugar?
🎧 It might be better to give them something like cereal with it.
🎧 Mmm. Then you'd need to weigh the mice, I should think once a week.
🎧 And you'd need an electronic balance.
🎧 But we can't hold them on the balance, or it'd affect the reading.
🎧 Exactly.
🎧 So you need something called a weighing chamber to stop the mice from running away.
🎧 It sounds complicated, but actually you can just use a plastic box with holes in the top.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 So once we've measured the weight gain of each mouse
🎧 we can work out the average for each group, as well as the standard deviation.
🎧 And then see where we go from there.
🎧 That sounds cool!
🎧 I think the students will enjoy it.
🎧 Yes. One thing...
🎧 
🎧 In today's lecture, I'm going to be talking about microplastics.
🎧 Microplastics are tiny pieces of plastic smaller than five millimetres in size.
🎧 Recently, there's been a greater awareness that there are large quantities of plastic waste - big and small - in the environment.
🎧 The amount of plastic waste in the oceans has received widespread attention,
🎧 but far less is known about the effects of microplastics in freshwater and particularly in soil.
🎧 Microplastics can enter the environment via a number of different sources.
🎧 Threads and microfibres detach from synthetic clothing every time they're put in a washing machine,
🎧 and these find their way into the water system.
🎧 Other sources include big pieces of plastic waste that are already in the environment,
🎧 and these break down into microscopic particles over a period of time.
🎧 On a larger scale, factory waste is another route,
🎧 as are tyres which wear down as cars, lorries and so on travel along road surfaces.
🎧 We already understand some of the impacts of microplastics from studies involving fish and other animals.
🎧 There is evidence that microplastics harm small creatures in a variety of ways,
🎧 such as by damaging their mouths,
🎧 or by impairing their ability to feed,
🎧 for example, when microplastics get lodged in their digestive system.
🎧 Surprisingly perhaps, it is likely that humans consume microplastics,
🎧 as these have been detected in a wide range of food and drink products, including bottled water,
🎧 as well as in water that comes direct from the tap.
🎧 What's more, salt and many kinds of seafood have also been found to contain microplastics.
🎧 However, it's important to underline that there is not yet conclusive proof
🎧 that microplastics cause significant harm to people.
🎧 In many countries, including here in the UK,
🎧 there is legislation which prevents manufacturers from adding plastic microbeads to shower gels, facial cleansers and toothpaste.
🎧 It is very difficult to accurately estimate the total amount of microplastic particles in the soil
🎧 as they can be hard to detect,
🎧 but we do know they are carried in the air and deposited in the soil by rain.
🎧 What's more, many of the fertilisers used by both farmers and gardeners contain microplastics.
🎧 A team from the Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge
🎧 has carried out a study of the effects of microplastics on the digestive tracts of earthworms.
🎧 These worms, which live in topsoil, are an essential component of our agricultural system.
🎧 By feeding on soil, they mix nutrients into it, thereby making it more fertile.
🎧 The researchers set out to discover whether the introduction of microplastics into the soil,
🎧 and the subsequent ingestion of these by earthworms,
🎧 would impact soil quality and ultimately inhibit plant growth.
🎧 The short answer was, yes, it did.
🎧 After placing three different types of microplastic particles into the soil,
🎧 they planted perennial rye grass.
🎧 The particles of microplastic, which included biodegradable PLA and conventional high-density polyethylene, or HDPE,
🎧 were then ingested by the earthworms in the soil.
🎧 The result was that the worms lost weight rapidly.
🎧 What's more, a lower percentage than normal of the rye grass seeds germinated,
🎧 and the researchers concluded
🎧 that this was a direct result of the earthworms being unable to fulfil their normal role in making soil more fertile.
🎧 The team also discovered that there was an increase in the amount of acid found in the soil,
🎧 and this was attributed mainly to the microplastic particles from conventional HDPE plastic.
🎧 The conclusions of the study make for very interesting reading.
🎧 I've included the reference in the notes to give you at the end of this session.
🎧 To summarise, the authors proposed the idea that we need to regard soil as we would regard any other process in nature.
🎧 This means we should accept the implications of soil being dependent on decaying and dead matter
🎧 constantly being passed through the bodies of earthworms.
🎧 That is, when soil becomes impoverished by the presence of microplastics,
🎧 not only ecosystems but also the whole of society are negatively impacted.
