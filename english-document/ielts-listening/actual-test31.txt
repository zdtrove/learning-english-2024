🎧 Hello, and welcome to "Under Pressure Enterprises", Customer Service Department.
🎧 This is Kelly. How may I help you?
🎧 Yes, I'm calling about one of your rice cookers I just purchased.
🎧 What seems to be the problem, sir?
🎧 Seems? There's no seeming about it!
🎧 The blasted thing shoots hot steam all over the place, that's what!
🎧 It nearly scalded my hand when I went to open it.
🎧 While it could have killed the cat or something. It could have exploded and killed my wife and me!
🎧 Sir, sir, please calm down.
🎧 As long as the steam escapes the cooker, it won't explode.
🎧 So you're telling me there's no problem!
🎧 Are you calling me a liar?
🎧 Sir, no one is calling you a liar.
🎧 Yes! So I demand a full refund!
🎧 Under Pressure will be happy to refund your money, sir.
🎧 Now I just need some basic information.
🎧 OK, OK. Sorry. I do tend to get a little hot under the collar.
🎧 My wife tells me to slow down...
🎧 So, what do you need to know?
🎧 Sir, don't worry. I just need to ask you the model number of the cooker.
🎧 Hmmm...
🎧 where are my glasses? Ah, here!
🎧 Let's see...
🎧 It's R242.
🎧 R242? OK.
🎧 And how much did you pay for the product?
🎧 89.99 pounds.
🎧 It was on sale, I guess I should tell you.
🎧 Thank you, that's honest of you.
🎧 Now, where did you buy the cooker?
🎧 Which store and which branch?
🎧 At that big Electric Life appliance store downtown.
🎧 The City Centre Branch?
🎧 That's the one.
🎧 And you say the problem is that the steam escapes?
🎧 Yes, it does!
🎧 No problem, sir.
🎧 If there's steam escaping, clearly the cooker is broken or defective.
🎧 So we have an R242 cooker with an escaping steam problem.
🎧 It was bought from Electric Life's City Centre Branch for 89.99.
🎧 Is that correct?
🎧 Yes, that is correct.
🎧 Oh, I nearly forgot. When did you buy the cooker?
🎧 Just as soon as my wife got the crazy idea she'll live longer if she stops eating good English food: roast beef and mash.
🎧 No, all she says she wants is rice and vegetables and sauces you'd not soak your feet in!
🎧 Sir, sir! When did you buy it?
🎧 Oh, there I go again. Let's see...
🎧 we bought it just 6 months ago!
🎧 We hardly used it either.
🎧 But 6 months? Is that too long?
🎧 I mean for the warranty?
🎧 Very well, that's well within the warranty period.
🎧 Now, what's your name and address?
🎧 Name and address! What for?
🎧 Sir, it is company policy. If you want your money, you must inform me.
🎧 Money you say?
🎧 Oh, my name is Herbert Hewitt and my address is 84 Park Road.
🎧 Is that here in Coventry?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 The postal code is B0241DJ.
🎧 But I don't think sending things in the mail is very secure or very efficient.
🎧 I mean...
🎧 Don't worry, Mr. Hewitt, don't worry.
🎧 We can credit the money to your credit card.
🎧 You do have one, don't you?
🎧 Yes, that's how we paid for the cooker.
🎧 Oh, yes. We still have the number on the computer.
🎧 I only need to ask your card's expiry date.
🎧 I'm afraid I never give that sort of information out.
🎧 I mean, once you have that, anyone could go charging things and...
🎧 Sir! I said your expiry date, not your card's password.
🎧 Oh, er, yes. Foolish me.
🎧 Of course, you didn't say "password".
🎧 Let's see.
🎧 That will be April 2008.
🎧 April 2008.
🎧 Very well, your card still has nearly 2 months left to go.
🎧 We'll get that refund right to you, probably by 5 o'clock this evening.
🎧 You had better!
🎧 If I don't get my money...
🎧 wait, wait. Yes, I know I'm losing my temper again.
🎧 I really am sorry.
🎧 I haven't had my medicine today.
🎧 And sir, just one more question for our record.
🎧 How often do you go shopping at the City Centre Branch?
🎧 Oh, well it's hard to say.
🎧 I suppose maybe once a month.
🎧 But I can tell you this, if I don't get my refund, I'll never shop there again!
🎧 Oh.. I think it's time to start looking for another job!
🎧 
🎧 Hello everyone, and welcome to the University of New South Wales.
🎧 The first thing I'd like to do at today's Orientation Session is get you all oriented!
🎧 That means tell you the location of some useful facilities and services.
🎧 So, first of all, take out the maps we gave you all as you came in the door.
🎧 The map is the big yellow sheet of paper.
🎧 As you can see on the map, North is at the top, South at the bottom, et cetera.
🎧 Which way's North?
🎧 Well, look through that window on my left, your right.
🎧 See the rising sun?
🎧 That would have to be East.
🎧 So North must be directly behind me.
🎧 Now, we are at the campus' Main Gate.
🎧 The Recreational Facilities are on my right hand and its opposite is the Student Centre.
🎧 No questions? Good. Pretty easy, right?
🎧 OK, did everyone eat breakfast at the Student Food Service this morning?
🎧 Was the food good?
🎧 Yes, yes. I am joking. I've eaten there, too.
🎧 So after a meal like that, you must be eager to go to a doctor. Right?
🎧 Well, I have good news for you:
🎧 the Student Health Centre is located about half a kilometre straight north of here.
🎧 Look on your maps.
🎧 You see the street on the east side of this building?
🎧 Ned Kelly Avenue?
🎧 Just follow that about 500 metres,
🎧 and the Health Centre will be on your left at the third cross street.
🎧 Now, I know you all just got here.
🎧 So you must be wondering how to tell your folks you've arrived safely,
🎧 how much you miss the dog, and how you already need more money.
🎧 If you don't have an Iphone, you probably are wondering where to find a computer.
🎧 Well, I have good news.
🎧 If you go straight out of this door and walk down the Garden Street,
🎧 you'll see the Internet Unit on your left side, just next to the Gym.
🎧 The hours are posted on the door, and the computers are free,
🎧 but you must bring your student ID card with you.
🎧 Like I tell everyone, if you need help with anything,
🎧 you can probably find right here in the Student Centre.
🎧 Do you see the 4 buildings there between the Student Centre and the library?
🎧 Those are the dormitories.
🎧 The men's dorms are the two on the south;
🎧 the women's the two on the north.
🎧 OK, I'm sorry to have to tell you,
🎧 but the university has been doing a lot of repairs and remodelling, and it's not all done yet.
🎧 So there may be some small problems with your dorm rooms.
🎧 Maybe the window doesn't open.
🎧 Maybe an air conditioner is missing or does not work.
🎧 If there are any problems, you can go to the Complaint Office,
🎧 which is right beside the Teaching Building between the Parker Street and the Crammer Street.
🎧 Just tell them your problem and they should have it fixed by the time you graduate in 4 years.
🎧 I'm joking, but please be patient.
🎧 There are a lot of little things they need to take care of.
🎧 Tired of the school food?
🎧 No? Give it a week.
🎧 Or maybe you just need a place to get coffee in the wee hours of the night during one of those marathon study sessions.
🎧 Either way, you definitely have to check out the little Cafe just past the women's dormitories.
🎧 They've got free Wi-Fi, so a lot of students saddle up with coffee and a bagel for hours on end to get work done.
🎧 As for the dorm rooms, I have some bad news and some good news.
🎧 The bad news is the rooms are small and you'll probably be sharing space with at least three other students.
🎧 The good news is that each room has its own bathroom.
🎧 What's good about sharing a bathroom with three strangers?
🎧 Hmmm... good question.
🎧 OK, call it bad news and worse news.
🎧 Hey, maybe try this for good news: each dorm has a kitchen.
🎧 If you want to make snacks or meals, you can do it there.
🎧 You can buy food containers at any campus convenience store, so you can store your food in the kitchen.
🎧 But a word of warning: you should definitely write your name on your food containers.
🎧 Sad to say, there are food thieves among your fellow students.
🎧 Speaking of thieves, a word about security.
🎧 I mean this is Australia and we do get drunken bushrangers wandering onto campus.
🎧 Each of you will be given a key for your dorm room.
🎧 Don't lose it.
🎧 You have to pay for any replacement and fill out a bunch of papers, too.
🎧 Red tape, huh?
🎧 Your key does not work for the front door of your dorm, however.
🎧 To the right of each door, there's a keypad with numbers.
🎧 When you move in, they will tell you the code you use to enter the door.
🎧 Please do not tell the code to people who do not live in the dorm.
🎧 Let's see. Have I forgotten anything?
🎧 Oh, yes. Most of you are not rich, correct?
🎧 So when your clothes get dirty, you can't just throw them away and buy new ones.
🎧 That means you have to learn to do laundry.
🎧 Or, men, that means you have to hurry up and get married.
🎧 If you decide to wash those clothes and not get married, there are laundries in each dorm.
🎧 Where? Oh, I almost forgot to tell you.
🎧 The laundry for each dorm is in the basement.
🎧 Some real good news this time: if you are a student, it is free.
🎧 You do have to buy your own soap, however.
🎧 The laundry closes, by the by, at 11:30
🎧 And, now that I've mentioned 11:30,
🎧 please remember the dorm doors are locked at 11:30 p.m.
🎧 Your code will not work.
🎧 If you want to get in, you'll have to call the night watchman.
🎧 Don't worry, you can get that number at the Dorm Office.
🎧 Yes, the Dorm Office and the Complaint Office are the same office.
🎧 All right, then. Before we continue, are there any questions?
🎧 
🎧 Come in!
🎧 Professor Dundee? We're ready to make our presentation.
🎧 Oh, yes. I did say 1 o'clock, didn't I?
🎧 Please, sit down.
🎧 So, who goes first? Bruce? Or you, Betty?
🎧 I guess I could. Bruce is always a little shy.
🎧 Not after he's had a lager for lunch, eh Bruce?
🎧 Heh, heh. No, Betty really should go first.
🎧 OK. Well, I'm reporting on the effects of different marketing strategies on the cheese and oil markets.
🎧 Different strategies obviously affect the sales volume differently.
🎧 I looked at the sales in two countries, New Zealand and Colombia.
🎧 And what did you find, pray tell?
🎧 Well, in New Zealand, the sales of both oil and cheese have declined pretty steadily.
🎧 And in fact, the sales have decreased more quickly than the population.
🎧 On the other hand, in Colombia, the volume of sales for both products has remained the same.
🎧 Wait, so you said sales in New Zealand have been going down?
🎧 Correct.
🎧 Suppliers have introduced two new upscale brands of each product,
🎧 which are a bit expensive but very tasty.
🎧 The big ad agencies are trying out a new series of ads that shift the focus from health to great taste.
🎧 They think that will get sales moving up in New Zealand,
🎧 where the population is less affluent and generally less health-conscious.
🎧 Brilliant. Thank you. And Bruce?
🎧 Uhhh... yeah. My report is about chocolate sales in Italy and Germany.
🎧 The two countries' marketers have found out that you have to market chocolate differently in each country.
🎧 For example?
🎧 In Italy, "Kostig", the most expensive brand,
🎧 pays shop owners to put the candy just about knee-high for an adult.
🎧 I don't see...
🎧 For little kids, that's about eye level!
🎧 That bright red candy is the first one they see, so they buy it!
🎧 Even better, they start telling their moms to buy it, too!
🎧 So, you mean...
🎧 Well, I mean, in Italy if you locate your product at the right location of shelves, sales do great.
🎧 They say it doesn't matter much what brand of chocolate you're selling.
🎧 As for Germany...
🎧 "Das Land der Schokolade".
🎧 Huh?
🎧 That's German. It means "The Land of Chocolate".
🎧 Germans love the stuff, so people make a joke and call Germany that.
🎧 Oh... uh, right...
🎧 So, you were saying?
🎧 Well, like you pointed out, Germans love chocolate.
🎧 But they're thrifty.
🎧 For a long time, the biggest selling brand was "Schmutzig",
🎧 mostly because it was the second cheapest, but didn't taste too bad.
🎧 Again brilliant!
🎧 A pretty good job, both of you.
🎧 Tell me, what do you plan to investigate next week?
🎧 I'm especially interested in the effects of colour on sales of products,
🎧 so I'll be looking at ads for cosmetics and cleaning products in the local market.
🎧 You know, like the distinct orange colour of Mr. Muscle, lavatory cleaning products.
🎧 And you, Bruce?
🎧 I'm focusing on the effects of different containers on sales of cookies.
🎧 So I'm going to look into packaging for cookies and how the materials they use will affect the image, and in turn sales.
🎧 You know, most containers are paper,
🎧 but some expensive cookies come in metal boxes.
🎧 The shiny metal boxes catch people's attention
🎧 and the image remains in the memory longer.
🎧 Well, it sounds like you two are all set.
🎧 But as always in this course,
🎧 I urge you both to pay much more attention to the advertisement extensions.
🎧 That's often the key.
🎧 Alright, any questions for me before you go?
🎧 No, I think I'm all set. Thanks!
🎧 Me too. Thanks, Professor Dundee. See ya later.
🎧 
🎧 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome you to our exhibition,
🎧 "Two Centuries of the Bike".
🎧 Let's stroll around the exhibition, shall we?
🎧 Although there were a few early efforts back in the 1700s,
🎧 you didn't really see many bikes till, say, the 1830s in England.
🎧 Bikes were a response to the rapid growth of cities early in the 19th century.
🎧 Cities like London were getting too big to walk across!
🎧 The early bike let people travel with less effort than walking.
🎧 Plus a bike was a lot cheaper than a horse!
🎧 Think of it. No one invented a bike for, what, 5000 years of human history?
🎧 Why did people do it then?
🎧 Probably because this was the start of the Machine Age:
🎧 people wanted machines to do all the work.
🎧 There were some drawbacks, however.
🎧 For one thing, there were no pedals.
🎧 You simply pushed yourself along using your feet.
🎧 Kind of like today's skateboard.
🎧 That meant you went fairly slow.
🎧 And uphill, you actually worked harder, pushing that two-wheeler.
🎧 Plus, the wheels were made of wood covered with metal, as you can see from this model.
🎧 So the downside was that the ride was quite uncomfortable on most roads.
🎧 Only a few gadget lovers had or used them.
🎧 By the 1860s, though, improvements were being made.
🎧 As you can see from this specimen, metal frames had become the rule.
🎧 They're more durable than wood, and they don't warp in the rain.
🎧 The biggest improvement however was the development of the chain and sprocket system.
🎧 They're connected.
🎧 This meant you did not push the bike.
🎧 You used pedals just like today.
🎧 You had to try harder to balance, so it took some practice to figure out how to use the pedals.
🎧 But it made the ride so much easier.
🎧 As a result, the good thing was that you could ride a lot more smoothly and with very little effort.
🎧 By the 1880s, another big change was the use of rubber wheels.
🎧 These became pretty common at that time.
🎧 Though the first ones were solid rubber,
🎧 the ride was a good deal more comfortable than the old iron and wood system.
🎧 This is a big consideration because the faster you go, the more you feel every bump.
🎧 Air-filled tyres - "pneumatic tyres" - didn't really come into use till around the year 1900,
🎧 as you can see from this exhibition over here.
🎧 That made the ride even more comfortable.
🎧 So, by 1890 or so, people were going a lot faster and a lot more smoothly.
🎧 There was one problem when you were going quickly and comfortably:
🎧 "OH NO! HOW DO I STOP?"
🎧 Yes, we all laugh now.
🎧 But for a long time, the only way to stop was drag your feet.
🎧 That didn't work very well and it would be dangerous if you were going fast.
🎧 In the crowded cities of those years - New York, Chicago, and so on,
🎧 you'd get killed if you couldn't stop for, say, a streetcar.
🎧 Plus look at this bike.
🎧 The front wheel is nearly a metre and 2/3 tall!
🎧 They made them that way so you could see over people and wagons.
🎧 But you couldn't drag your feet.
🎧 This model is called a "velocipede" - a "speed pedal".
🎧 Another characteristic of the bike in this period is that it has 2 equal-sized wheels,
🎧 which signalled a big change in bikes.
🎧 For with the velocipede, brakes appeared.
🎧 If you wanted to stop, you just pushed the pedal backwards.
🎧 Doing that stopped the back wheel of the bike.
🎧 This technique worked a lot better than dragging your feet or jumping off the high seat there!
🎧 This meant that bikes became a great deal safer.
🎧 It would've been safer if people wore helmets,
🎧 but the first bicycle helmet wasn't invented until years later,
🎧 and even then it was little more than a leather ballcap.
🎧 It really wasn't until the 1970s that the bike helmet was modified to provide some real protection.
🎧 Before continuing on to look at developments since the 1890s, let's say a word more about safety.
🎧 Everyone knows if you're going downhill, you can get going dangerously fast.
🎧 To go more than a hundred kilometres an hour isn't all that difficult!
🎧 But even on level ground it's easy to go too quickly.
🎧 On a city street, today's bicycles can be ridden at a speed of over 40 miles an hour, over a short distance.
🎧 That's about 64 kilometres an hour.
🎧 Remember you're on a bike, not in a car.
🎧 There's nothing to protect you.
🎧 People are killed in single-bicycle accidents every day, just from hitting the road.
🎧 A good rule to remember is, if you're going faster than the cars, slow down.
🎧 And please wear a helmet.
🎧 Nearly one quarter of the epilepsy cases come from head injuries in accidents on bikes and motorcycles.
🎧 I don't mean to scare you, but safety is everyone's business.
🎧 What? Now that's a good question.
🎧 Why are today's bikes so much faster?
🎧 Well, it's not just that today's athletes are faster.
🎧 The answer is partly mechanical.
🎧 If you look closely here, at the back wheel you'll see a number of gears.
🎧 Changing gears is what makes those fast speeds possible.
🎧 You can shift gears depending on the terrain and how hard you wish to pedal.
🎧 So you can put it on a higher gear for downhill,
🎧 and a lower gear for uphill travel to make it easier to climb that slope.
🎧 You'll notice this gear-shifting mechanism is attached to the back wheel,
🎧 and when the rider shifts on the handlebar gear shifter,
🎧 the chain moves to the appropriate sprocket.
🎧 And, speaking of changing gears,
🎧 let's look over here at our "Tour de France" exhibit...
