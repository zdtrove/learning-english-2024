[105] Cam9 - Test 3 - Part 1

🎧 Greek Island Holidays, can I help you?
🎧 Yes, I hope so.
🎧 I have a friend who's just come back from Corfu
🎧 and she's recommended some apartments in Arilas.
🎧 She thought they might be on your list.
🎧 Arilas, Arilas... let me see.
🎧 Can you give me the names?
🎧 Yes, the first's Rose Garden Apartments.
🎧 I'd like to go with another friend in the last week of October.
🎧 Well, we've got a lovely studio flat available at that time.
🎧 I'm sure you'd enjoy the entertainment programme there too,
🎧 with Greek dancing in the restaurant.
🎧 And the cost for each of us?
🎧 £219.
🎧 That sounds very reasonable!
🎧 I'm just jotting down some notes.
🎧 Now the second one she mentioned was called Blue Bay.
🎧 Blue Bay?
🎧 Yes, in fact that's very popular and it has some special features.
🎧 Really?
🎧 The main attraction is the large swimming pool with salt water.
🎧 Much healthier, I understand.
🎧 That's right.
🎧 And it isn't far from the beach, either - only 300 metres,
🎧 and only around half a kilometre to some shops,
🎧 so you don't have to be too energetic.
🎧 Is it much more expensive than the first one?
🎧 Let me just check.
🎧 I think at the time you want to go it's around £260
🎧 No, £275 to be exact.
🎧 Right, I've got that.
🎧 Now there are just two more apartments to ask you about.
🎧 Um, I can't read my own writing!
🎧 Something to do with sun... Sunshine, is it?
🎧 I think you meant the Sunshade Apartments.
🎧 They're on a mountainside.
🎧 Any special features?
🎧 Yes, each room has its own sun terrace
🎧 and there are shared barbecue facilities.
🎧 Oh, sounds lovely!
🎧 Yes, it is rather well-equipped.
🎧 It also provides water sports, it has its own beach.
🎧 There are facilities for water-skiing.
🎧 Any kite-surfing? My friend's quite keen.
🎧 Not at the hotel but I'm sure you'll find some in Arilas.
🎧 There's also satellite TV in the apartments.
🎧 And how much is that one?
🎧 £490 with two sharing.
🎧 You mean £245 each?
🎧 I'm afraid not!
🎧 Each person has to pay that amount and there must be at least two in an apartment.
🎧 I don't think that would be within our budget, unfortunately.
🎧 And the last one sounds a bit expensive too - the Grand!
🎧 Actually it's quite reasonable.
🎧 It's an older style house with Greek paintings in every room, and a balcony outside.
🎧 Sounds nice. What are the views like?
🎧 Well, there are forests all round and they hide a supermarket just down the road,
🎧 so that's very useful for all your shopping needs.
🎧 There's a disco in the area too.
🎧 And the price?
🎧 £319 at that time,
🎧 but if you leave it till November it goes down by 40%.
🎧 Hmm... Too late, I'm afraid.
🎧 Well, why don't i send you a brochure with full details, Ms...?
🎧 Nash.
🎧 But don't worry about that.
🎧 I'm coming to Upminster soon and I'll call and get one.
🎧 I just wanted to get an idea first.
🎧 Well, that's fine.
🎧 Uhh... We've got plenty here when you come.
🎧 If you've got a minute, could I just check a couple of points about insurance?
🎧 I got one policy through the post but I'd like to see if yours is better.
🎧 Fine.
🎧 What would you like to know?
🎧 Well, the one I've got has benefits and then the maximum amount you can claim.
🎧 Is that like yours?
🎧 Yes, that's how most of them are.
🎧 Well, the first thing is cancellation.
🎧 If the holiday's cancelled on the policy I've got, you can claim £8,000.
🎧 We can improve on that, Ms Nash.
🎧 For Greek Island holidays, our maximum is £10,000.
🎧 That's good - of course our holiday won't even cost £1,000 together!
🎧 It's still sensible to have good cover.
🎧 Now, if you go to hospital, we allow £600.
🎧 Yes, mine's similar.
🎧 And we also allow a relative to travel to your holiday resort.
🎧 My policy just says their representative will help you.
🎧 You can see there's another difference there.
🎧 And what happens if you don't get on the plane?
🎧 Nothing, as far as I can see on this form.
🎧 Don't you have missed departure?
🎧 No, I'll just jot that down.
🎧 We pay up to £1,000 for that, depending on the reason.
🎧 And we're particularly generous about loss of personal belongings -
🎧 up to £3,000, but not more than £500 for a single item.
🎧 Then I'd better not take my laptop!
🎧 Not unless you insure it separately.
🎧 Okay, thanks very much for your time, you've really been helpful.
🎧 Can I get back to you? Your name is?
🎧 Ben Ludlow.
🎧 That's LUDLOW.
🎧 I'm the Assistant Manager here.
🎧 I'll give you my number.
🎧 It's 081260543216.
🎧 But didn't I phone 081260567294?
🎧 That's what I've got on the paper.
🎧 That's the main switchboard.
🎧 I've given you my direct line.
🎧 Right, thank you very much for your time.

[106] Cam9 - Test 3 - Part 2

🎧 For the second in our series about locally-run businesses, we meet Simon Winridge,
🎧 co-founder of the hugely-successful Winridge Forest Railway Park.
🎧 Welcome, Simon.
🎧 Now, perhaps you can begin by telling us a little bit about how it all started.
🎧 Well, during the 1970s, my wife, Liz and I had just acquired 80 acres of sheep-farming land,
🎧 and we decided to settle down and have children.
🎧 Pretty soon we had a daughter, Sarah, and a son, Duncan.
🎧 The place was wonderful for the kids:
🎧 they particularly loved trains and gradually built up an enormous network of miniature railway track.
🎧 I began to develop larger-scale models of locomotives
🎧 but we didn't think anything more of it until I went on a trip to a theme park near Birmingham
🎧 and decided we could do a much better job!
🎧 So we set up a small one ourselves based on the miniature railway
🎧 and we opened to the public for just a month that year, 1984 -
🎧 in July - our driest month -
🎧 because our children said they didn't want our guests to have a miserable, wet visit.
🎧 I dealt with park business and Liz carried on with the farm work.
🎧 It soon became clear that we were onto a winner.
🎧 We began to extend the railway track and lay it among more interesting landscape by planting trees,
🎧 which in turn attracted more wildlife,
🎧 and by making cuttings through the rock.
🎧 Nowadays, we're open all year round
🎧 and we're pleased to say that Winridge is one of the most popular visitor attractions in the area -
🎧 with 50,000 visitors a year -
🎧 a million and a half people have been through our doors since we opened.
🎧 All these visitors mean we have had to expand our operation
🎧 and it's now a truly family concern.
🎧 I'm near to retirement age so...
🎧 I only concern myself with looking after the mechanical side of things - keeping the trains going.
🎧 Liz now devotes all her energies to recruiting and supporting the large squadron of workers,
🎧 which keep the place running smoothly.
🎧 We're really pleased that after some years away teaching,
🎧 Sarah has now returned to the park and makes sure the visitors are kept fed and watered,
🎧 which keeps her pretty busy as you can imagine.
🎧 Our son, Duncan, has been a stalwart of the park for the last ten years,
🎧 taking over from me in the area of construction -
🎧 and I'll say a little bit more about that in a moment -
🎧 and his new wife - Judith, has also joined the team in charge of retail.
🎧 That's becoming a tremendous growth area for us -
🎧 a lot of people want to buy souvenirs.
🎧 So have you finished your development of the site for the moment?
🎧 Not at all!
🎧 We're constantly looking for ways to offer more to our visitors.
🎧 The railway remains the central feature
🎧 and there's now 1.2 kilometres of the line laid but we'd like to lay more.
🎧 Because of the geology of the area, our greatest problem is digging tunnels.
🎧 But we're gradually overcoming that.
🎧 We're also very pleased with a new installation of the Go-Kart arena
🎧 which is 120 square metres in area.
🎧 Again the problem is the geology;
🎧 we had to level the mounds on the track for safety reasons.
🎧 We wanted to enable 5 to 12 year olds to use the go-karts.
🎧 And the main attraction here is the Formula 1 Kart.
🎧 We've known fights to break out over who gets it!
🎧 And then, finally, to our most recent...

[107] Cam9 - Test 3 - Part 3

🎧 Ah Caroline... come on in. Sit down.
🎧 Thanks.
🎧 So how's the dissertation planning going?
🎧 Well Dr Schulmann, I'm still having a lot of trouble deciding on a title.
🎧 Well, that's perfectly normal at this stage.
🎧 And this is what your tutorials will help you to do.
🎧 Right.
🎧 What we'll do is jot down some points that might help you in your decision.
🎧 First of all, you have chosen your general topic area, haven't you?
🎧 Yes, it's the fishing industry.
🎧 Oh yes, that was one of the areas you mentioned.
🎧 Now, what aspects of the course are you good at?
🎧 Well, I think I'm coping well with statistics,
🎧 and I'm never bored by it.
🎧 Good. Anything else?
🎧 Well, I found computer modelling fascinating -
🎧 I have no problem following what's being taught,
🎧 whereas quite a few of my classmates find it difficult.
🎧 Well, that's very good.
🎧 Do you think these might be areas you could bring into your dissertation?
🎧 Oh yes, if possible.
🎧 It's just that I'm having difficulty thinking how I can do that.
🎧 You see, I feel I don't have sufficient background information.
🎧 I see.
🎧 Well, do you take notes?
🎧 I'm very weak at note-taking.
🎧 My teachers always used to say that.
🎧 Well, I think you really need to work on these weaknesses before you go any further.
🎧 What do you suggest?
🎧 Well, I can go through the possible strategies with you and let you decide where to go from there.
🎧 Okay, thanks.
🎧 Well, some people find it helpful to organise peer-group discussions -
🎧 you know, each week a different person studies a different topic and shares it with the group.
🎧 Oh right.
🎧 It really helps build confidence, you know, having to present something to others.
🎧 I can see that.
🎧 The drawback is that everyone in the group seems to share the same ideas...
🎧 they keep being repeated in all the dissertations.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 You could also try a service called 'Student Support'.
🎧 It's designed to give you a structured programme over a number of weeks to develop your skills.
🎧 Sounds good.
🎧 Yes, unfortunately there are only a few places.
🎧 But it's worth looking into.
🎧 Yes, of course.
🎧 I know I've got to work on my study skills.
🎧 And then there are several study skills books you can consult.
🎧 Right.
🎧 They'll be a good source of reference
🎧 but the problem is they are sometimes too general.
🎧 Yes, that's what I've found.
🎧 Other than that, I would strongly advise quite simple ideas like using a card index.
🎧 Well, yes, I've never done that before.
🎧 It's simple, but it really works because you have to get points down in a small space.
🎧 Another thing I always advise is don't just take your notes and forget about them.
🎧 Read everything three times - that'll really fix them in your mind.
🎧 Yes, I can see it'd take discipline but...
🎧 Well, if you establish good study skills at this stage, they'll be with you all your life.
🎧 Oh yes. I completely agree.
🎧 It's just that I don't seem to be able to discipline myself.
🎧 I need to talk things over.
🎧 Well, we'll be continuing these tutorials of course.
🎧 Let's arrange next month's now. Let's see...
🎧 I can see you virtually any time during the week starting the 22nd of January.
🎧 What about the 24th?
🎧 I'm free in the afternoon.
🎧 Sorry, I'm booked then.
🎧 What about the following day?
🎧 The Thursday?
🎧 I can make the morning.
🎧 Fine, we'll go for the 25th then.
🎧 That's great, thanks.

[108] Cam9 - Test 3 - Part 4

🎧 Good morning.
🎧 In the last few lectures, I've been talking about the history of domestic building construction.
🎧 But today I want to begin looking at some contemporary, experimental designs for housing.
🎧 So, I'm going to start with a house which is constructed more or less under the ground.
🎧 And one of the interesting things about this project is...
🎧 that the owners - both professionals but not architects - wanted to be closely involved,
🎧 so they decided to manage the project themselves.
🎧 Their chief aim was to create somewhere that was as environmentally-friendly as possible.
🎧 But at the same time they wanted to live somewhere peaceful -
🎧 they'd both grown up in a rural area and disliked urban life.
🎧 So the first thing they did was to look for a site.
🎧 And they found a disused stone quarry in a beautiful area.
🎧 The price was relatively low,
🎧 and they liked the idea of recycling the land, as it were.
🎧 As it was, the quarry was an ugly blot on the landscape,
🎧 and it wasn't productive any longer, either.
🎧 They consulted various architects
🎧 and looked at a number of designs before finally deciding on one.
🎧 As I've said,
🎧 it was a design for a sort of underground house,
🎧 and it was built into the earth itself, with two storeys.
🎧 The north, east and west sides were set in the earth,
🎧 and only the sloping, south-facing side was exposed to the light.
🎧 That was made of a double layer of very strong glass.
🎧 There were also photovoltaic tiles fixed to the top and bottom of this sloping wall.
🎧 These are tiles that are designed to store energy from the sun.
🎧 And the walls had a layer of foam around them too, to increase the insulation.
🎧 Now, what is of interest to us about this project
🎧 is the features which make the building energy-efficient.
🎧 Sunlight floods in through the glass wall,
🎧 and to maximise it, there are lots of mirrors and windows inside the house.
🎧 That helps to spread the light around.
🎧 So that's the first thing - light is utilised as fully as possible.
🎧 In addition, the special tiles on the outside convert energy from the sun
🎧 and generate some of the house's electricity.
🎧 In fact, and it's possible that in future the house may even generate an electricity surplus,
🎧 and that the owners will be able to sell some to the national grid.
🎧 As well as that, wherever possible, recycled materials have been used.
🎧 For example, the floors are made of reclaimed wood.
🎧 And the owners haven't bought a single item of new furniture -
🎧 they just kept what they already had.
🎧 And then there's the system for dealing with the waste produced in the house.
🎧 This is dealt with organically -
🎧 it's purified by being filtered through reed beds
🎧 which have been planted for that purpose in the garden.
🎧 So the occupants of the house won't pollute the land or use any damaging chemicals.
🎧 It's true that the actual construction of the house was harmful to the environment,
🎧 mainly because they had to use massive amounts of concrete -
🎧 one of the biggest sources of carbon dioxide in manufacturing.
🎧 And, as you know, this is very damaging to the environment.
🎧 In total, the house construction has released 70 tons of carbon dioxide into the air.
🎧 Now that's a frightening thought.
🎧 However, once the initial 'debt' has been cleared -
🎧 and it's been calculated that this will only take fifteen years -
🎧 this underground house won't cost anything - environmentally I mean -
🎧 because unlike ordinary houses,
🎧 it is run in a way that is completely environmentally friendly.
🎧 So, eco-housing like this is likely to become...
