🎧 Jack, I'm thinking of taking the kids to the seaside on a surfing holiday this summer
🎧 and I wanted to ask your advice
🎧 as I know you're such an expert.
🎧 Well, I don't know about that,
🎧 but yes, I've done a bit of surfing over the years.
🎧 I'd thoroughly recommend it.
🎧 I think it's the kind of holiday all the family can enjoy together.
🎧 The thing about surfing is that it's great for all ages and all abilities.
🎧 My youngest started when he was only three!
🎧 Wow!
🎧 But it's quite physically demanding, isn't it?
🎧 I've heard you need to be pretty fit.
🎧 Yes. You'll certainly learn more quickly and won't tire as easily.
🎧 Well - that should be OK for us.
🎧 You've been surfing a few times in Ireland, haven't you?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 There's some great surfing there, which people don't always realise.
🎧 And which locations would you recommend?
🎧 There seem to be quite a few.
🎧 Yes, there are loads.
🎧 Last year we went to County Donegal.
🎧 There are several great places to surf there.
🎧 What about in County Clare?
🎧 I read that's also really good for surfing.
🎧 Yes, it is.
🎧 I've been there a few times.
🎧 Most people go to Lahinch.
🎧 My kids love it there.
🎧 The waves aren't too challenging and the town is very lively.
🎧 Are there good hotels there?
🎧 Yes - some very nice ones
🎧 and there are also a few basic hostels and campsites.
🎧 It's great if you need lessons as the surf schools are excellent.
🎧 Sounds good.
🎧 Yes and there's lots to see in the area,
🎧 like those well-known cliffs...
🎧 I've forgotten the name of them...
🎧 Oh don't worry - I can look them up.
🎧 I've also been surfing in County Mayo,
🎧 which is less well-known for surfing, but we had a really good time.
🎧 That was a few years ago when the kids were younger.
🎧 There's a good surf school at Carrowniskey beach.
🎧 How do you spell that?
🎧 Carrowniskey
🎧 OK.
🎧 I put the kids into the surf camp they run during the summer for 10-16 year olds
🎧 Oh right.
🎧 How long was that for?
🎧 Three hours every day for a week.
🎧 It was perfect.
🎧 They were so tired out after that.
🎧 I can imagine.
🎧 One thing we did while the kids were surfing
🎧 was to rent some kayaks to have a look around the bay which is nearby.
🎧 It's really beautiful.
🎧 Oh, I'd love to do that.
🎧 Now the only time I went to Ireland it rained practically every day.
🎧 Yes, that can be a problem,
🎧 but you can surf in the rain, you know.
🎧 It doesn't have the same appeal, somehow.
🎧 Well, the weather's been fine the last couple of years when I've been there,
🎧 but actually, it tends to rain more in August than in the spring or autumn.
🎧 September's my favourite month because the water is warmer then.
🎧 The only problem is that the kids are back to school then.
🎧 I know.
🎧 But one good thing about Irish summers is that it doesn't get too hot.
🎧 The average temperature is about 19 degrees
🎧 and it usually doesn't go above 25 degrees.
🎧 That sounds alright.
🎧 Now what about costs?
🎧 Surfing is a pretty cheap holiday really,
🎧 the only cost is the hire of equipment.
🎧 You can expect to pay a daily rate of about 30 euros for the hire of a wetsuit and board,
🎧 but you can save about 40 euros if you hire by the week.
🎧 That's not too bad.
🎧 No.
🎧 It's important to make sure you get good quality wetsuits.
🎧 You'll all get too cold if you don't.
🎧 And make sure you also get boots.
🎧 They keep your feet warm and it's easier to surf with them on too.
🎧 OK. Well, thanks very much...
🎧 
🎧 Good afternoon.
🎧 My name's Mrs Carter
🎧 and I run the before and after school extended hours childcare service.
🎧 I hope you've had a chance to have a good look around the school and talk to staff and pupils.
🎧 I know that many of you are interested in using our childcare service
🎧 when your child joins the school,
🎧 and perhaps you already know something about it,
🎧 but for those that don't, I'll go through the main details now.
🎧 We offer childcare for children from the ages of four to eleven
🎧 both before and after school.
🎧 I know that many parents who work find this service invaluable.
🎧 You can leave your child with us safe in the knowledge that they will be extremely well cared for.
🎧 We are insured to provide care for up to 70 children,
🎧 although we rarely have this many attending at any one session.
🎧 I think we generally expect around 50 to 60 children for the afternoon sessions
🎧 and about half that number for the breakfast sessions.
🎧 Although we currently do have 70 children registered with us,
🎧 not all of these attend every day.
🎧 It's ten years since we began offering an extended hours service
🎧 and we've come a long way during that time.
🎧 When we first opened, we only had about 20 children attending regularly.
🎧 We try to keep our costs as low as we can
🎧 and we think we provide very good value for money.
🎧 For the afternoon sessions, which run from 3:30 until 6 p.m.,
🎧 it's £7.20.
🎧 But if you prefer, you can pay for one hour only,
🎧 which costs £3.50
🎧 or two hours which costs £5.70.
🎧 The cost of the childcare includes food and snacks.
🎧 They'll be given breakfast in the morning
🎧 and in the afternoon, a healthy snack as soon as they finish school.
🎧 At 5 p.m. children are given something more substantial,
🎧 such as pasta or a casserole.
🎧 Please inform us of any allergies that your child might have
🎧 and we'll make sure they're offered a suitable alternative.
🎧 As you may know,
🎧 the childcare service runs through the school holidays from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.
🎧 We offer a really varied and exciting programme to keep the children entertained,
🎧 we don't want them to feel as if they are still at school!
🎧 It will also feel different
🎧 because they'll get the chance to make new friends with children from other schools.
🎧 Spaces are available for them
🎧 because a lot of our term-time children don't always attend during the holiday.
🎧 In the past,
🎧 parents have asked if children over the age of 11 are allowed to come with their younger brothers and sisters,
🎧 but I'm afraid we're unable to do this
🎧 because of the type of insurance we have.
🎧 So now let me tell you about some of the activities that your child can do during the after-school sessions.
🎧 As well as being able to use the playground equipment, computers and the library,
🎧 there is usually at least one 'special' activity that children can do each day.
🎧 For example, Spanish.
🎧 We have a specialist teacher coming in every Thursday
🎧 to give a basic introduction to the language through games and songs.
🎧 She does two sessions:
🎧 one for the over 8s and one for the younger children.
🎧 This is the only activity which we have to make an extra charge for
🎧 but it's well worth it.
🎧 Once a week the children have the opportunity to do some music.
🎧 We're very lucky that one of our staff is a member of a folk band.
🎧 On Mondays, she teaches singing and percussion to groups of children.
🎧 We do rely on parental support for this,
🎧 so if any of you sing or play an instrument
🎧 and would be prepared to help out at these sessions, we'd be delighted.
🎧 Painting continues to be one of the most popular activities.
🎧 To begin with we weren't keen on offering this because of the extra mess involved,
🎧 but children kept asking if they could do some art
🎧 and so we finally gave in.
🎧 Art is great for helping the children to relax after working hard at school all day.
🎧 Yoga is something that we've been meaning to introduce for some time
🎧 but haven't been able to find anyone available to teach it,
🎧 until now that is.
🎧 So we'll see how this goes.
🎧 Hopefully, children will benefit in all sorts of ways from this.
🎧 Cooking is another popular activity.
🎧 They make a different sort of cake, or pizza or bread each week.
🎧 Although the younger children love doing it,
🎧 we found that the mess was just too much,
🎧 so we've decided to restrict this to the over 8s,
🎧 as they are better able to clean up after themselves.
🎧 
🎧 Hello Dr Green,
🎧 I'm here to talk to you about my work placement.
🎧 Oh yes, it's Holly, isn't it?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 So, which work placement have you chosen?
🎧 I decided to go for the Orion Stadium placement.
🎧 The event I'll be managing is one where I'm helping to set up a sports competition for primary school children.
🎧 Yup. That's always a popular placement,
🎧 even though it can be tougher than you think working with children.
🎧 I know, but it's the fresh air that attracts me,
🎧 organising something indoors doesn't have the same appeal,
🎧 even though it might be fun.
🎧 OK, so obviously safety's going to be one of your key concerns for this event.
🎧 Yes, I've already thought about that.
🎧 I'll need to make sure none of the equipment's damaged.
🎧 Ah well, you'll be working with schools, so the equipment will be their responsibility.
🎧 However, the grounds and what goes on there will be yours.
🎧 Oh I see,
🎧 that'll include keeping everyone within the boundary once they're in their kit and on the field?
🎧 Exactly,
🎧 you'll need to inspect areas like changing rooms as well for anything someone can trip over,
🎧 but your main priority will be not to lose anyone!
🎧 Right.
🎧 I'll need staff to help with that.
🎧 And don't forget about the spectators.
🎧 I was thinking that many of them will be parents, who could help run the event.
🎧 I wouldn't rely on that.
🎧 They'll be more interested in filming their children than volunteering.
🎧 I'll need to make sure they don't interfere with events doing that!
🎧 And that's not always easy,
🎧 especially when a proud parent's trying to get a snap of their child
🎧 and you want them to move elsewhere.
🎧 OK.
🎧 What about the scheduling?
🎧 With sporting events there are all sorts of things that can alter the timetable,
🎧 like rain, for instance, though so far, we've always been lucky with that.
🎧 Yeah, and I was thinking about what to do if someone got hurt as well.
🎧 I know that last year that caused a terrible delay.
🎧 You have to be prepared for such things.
🎧 Oh. What if a match ends in a draw,
🎧 do you let the teams keep going until someone wins?
🎧 That'll be up to you,
🎧 and again, you need to plan for it.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Now, the aim of your work placement is to give you the opportunity to develop the skills that an events manager needs.
🎧 So, let's talk about those a bit.
🎧 Well, I think my communication skills are pretty good.
🎧 I can talk on the phone to people and book venues and that kind of thing.
🎧 Good, just remember it isn't only about what you say.
🎧 If you meet someone face-to-face and want to persuade them to be a sponsor, for example…
🎧 Oh, I'll dress up for that! Sure.
🎧 Good.
🎧 Let's go on to think about your organisational skills.
🎧 You're working in a very people-based industry
🎧 and that means things won't always go to plan.
🎧 I guess it's being prepared to make changes that matters.
🎧 That's right.
🎧 You may have to make an on-the-spot change to a timetable because of a problem you hadn't anticipated...
🎧 ...just do it! OK
🎧 How's your time management these days?
🎧 I'm working on it,
🎧 I'm certainly better when I have a deadline, which is why this work suits me.
🎧 Yes, but it's how you respond as that deadline approaches!
🎧 I know I've got to look calm even if I'm in a panic.
🎧 Just think to yourself,
🎧 no one must know I'm under pressure.
🎧 Yeah, even though I'm multi-tasking like crazy!
🎧 Another skill that events managers need is creativity.
🎧 Often your client has what we call the 'big picture' idea,
🎧 but it's up to the events manager to think of all the fine points that go to making it work.
🎧 Right, so I need to listen carefully to that idea and then fill in all the gaps.
🎧 That's right.
🎧 And you'll have a team working under you,
🎧 so another key skill is leadership.
🎧 Your team may have lots of ideas too,
🎧 but you've got to make the ultimate choices.
🎧 Do we have refreshments inside or out, for example?
🎧 Isn't it better to be democratic?
🎧 It's a nice idea, but you have the ultimate responsibility.
🎧 So, believe in what you think best.
🎧 Be prepared to say 'yes', that's a good idea but it won't work here.
🎧 I see what you mean.
🎧 What about the networking side of things?
🎧 I know it's an area that a lot of students worry about
🎧 because we don't have much experience to offer others.
🎧 But even without it, you can still be an interesting person with useful ideas.
🎧 And the more people you impress, the better.
🎧 I guess that will help me when I apply for a real job.
🎧 Exactly, think ahead, remember what your ambitions are and keep them in mind.
🎧 Definitely.

🎧 Scientists believe that a majority of the earth's bird population migrate in some fashion or other.
🎧 Some travel seasonally for relatively short distances,
🎧 such as birds that move from their winter habitats in lowlands to mountain tops for the summers.
🎧 Others, like the Arctic Tern,
🎧 travel more than 25,000 miles seasonally between the northern and southern poles.
🎧 Bird migration has been studied over many centuries through a variety of observations.
🎧 But until relatively recently,
🎧 where birds went to in the winter was considered something of a mystery.
🎧 The lack of modern science and technology led to many theories that we now recognize as error-filled
🎧 and even somewhat amusing.
🎧 Take hibernation theory for example,
🎧 2000 years ago, it was commonly believed that when birds left an area,
🎧 they went underwater to hibernate in the seas and oceans.
🎧 Another theory for the regular appearance and disappearance of birds
🎧 was that they spend winter hidden in mud till the weather changed and food became abundant again.
🎧 The theory that some birds hibernate persisted until experiments were done on caged birds in the 1940s
🎧 which demonstrated that birds have no hibernation instinct.
🎧 One of the earliest naturalists and philosophers from ancient Greece was Aristotle
🎧 who was the first writer to discuss the disappearance and reappearance of some bird species at certain times of year.
🎧 He developed the theory of transmutation -
🎧 the seasonal change of one species into another -
🎧 by observing redstarts and robins.
🎧 He observed that in the autumn,
🎧 small birds called 'redstarts' began to lose their feathers,
🎧 which convinced Aristotle that they changed into robins for the winter,
🎧 and back into redstarts in the summer.
🎧 These assumptions are understandable given that this pair of species are similar in shape,
🎧 but are a classic example of an incorrect interpretation based on correct observations.
🎧 The most bizarre theory was put forward by an English amateur scientist,
🎧 Charles Morton, in the seventeenth century.
🎧 He wrote a surprisingly well-regarded paper
🎧 claiming that birds migrate to the moon and back every year.
🎧 He came to this conclusion as the only logical explanation for the total disappearance of some species.
🎧 One of the key moments in the development of migration theory came in 1822
🎧 when a white stork was shot in Germany.
🎧 This particular stork made history because of the long spear in its neck
🎧 which incredibly had not killed it,
🎧 everyone immediately realised this spear was definitely not European.
🎧 It turned out to be a spear from a tribe in Central Africa.
🎧 This was a truly defining moment in the history of ornithology
🎧 because it was the first evidence that storks spend their winters in sub-Saharan Africa.
🎧 You can still see the 'arrow stork' in the Zoological Collection of the University of Rostock in Germany.
🎧 People gradually became aware that European birds moved south in autumn and north in summer
🎧 but didn't know much about it until the practice of catching birds and putting rings on their legs became established.
🎧 Before this, very little information was available about the actual destinations of particular species
🎧 and how they travelled there.
🎧 People speculated that larger birds provided a kind of taxi service for smaller birds
🎧 by carrying them on their backs.
🎧 This idea came about
🎧 because it seemed impossible that small birds weighing only a few grams could fly over vast oceans.
🎧 This idea was supported by observations of bird behaviour
🎧 such as the harassment of larger birds by smaller birds.
🎧 The development of bird ringing, by a Danish schoolteacher,
🎧 Hans Christian Cornelius Mortensen,
🎧 made many discoveries possible.
🎧 This is still common practice today and relies upon what is known as 'recovery',
🎧 this is when ringed birds are found dead in the place they have migrated to, and identified.
🎧 Huge amounts of data were gathered in the early part of the twentieth century
🎧 and for the first time in history people understood where birds actually went to in winter.
🎧 In 1931, an atlas was published showing where the most common species of European birds migrated to.
