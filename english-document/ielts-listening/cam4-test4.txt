[029] Cam4 - Test 4 - Part 1

🎧 Hi Tony, thanks ever so much for coming.
🎧 You know we've been asked to organise something for John's farewell?
🎧 Yeah, sure, it's about time we started working out details.
🎧 Exactly.
🎧 We don't want to leave it so late that it's double the work.
🎧 Mmm, mm, right, do you want me to take notes?
🎧 That'd be great, thanks.
🎧 Right, first thing is,
🎧 when is the best time to hold it?
🎧 Well, he leaves on the 24th of December.
🎧 So what about the 22nd?
🎧 Yeah, I think that's about right.
🎧 We want it quite near the time, don't we?
🎧 Sure, and what about a venue?
🎧 In college? A hotel?
🎧 I think a hotel will probably work out rather expensive,
🎧 and I've been looking at the College Dining Room.
🎧 That seems pretty reasonable.
🎧 Fine, yeah, why not?
🎧 And then we ought to be thinking about invitations...
🎧 Who mustn't we forget to invite?
🎧 Well, obviously John and his wife.
🎧 Right.
🎧 And the Director.
🎧 The office staff.
🎧 And all the teachers and all the students.
🎧 Anyone else?
🎧 Faculty Heads?
🎧 No, better draw the line, I don't think it's necessary.
🎧 Yeah, you're right.
🎧 I don't mind writing the invitations.
🎧 When shall we get them out for?
🎧 Enough time but not too early.
🎧 What about the fifteenth of December?
🎧 Well, there are exams on the 16th - better avoid them.
🎧 10th?
🎧 Yeah, that should do it.
🎧 So what does that leave?
🎧 Oh yes, a present.
🎧 Would you mind doing that?
🎧 No, not at all;
🎧 we usually go round with an envelope during coffee break, don't we?
🎧 Yeah, coffee break's always the best time,
🎧 'cos people have got their money handy.
🎧 Yeah, exactly.
🎧 Do we suggest an amount?
🎧 Or does it seem a bit unfair?
🎧 No, I think people welcome it.
🎧 We suggested 6 dollars last time, is that okay?
🎧 Yeah, plenty, I would have thought,
🎧 which should leave us with about 90 dollars.
🎧 Have you any ideas for presents?
🎧 Well, I've been having a little think.
🎧 I thought...
🎧 you know, he loves music.
🎧 Yeah, and books.
🎧 So, I thought I'd check on prices for, well, perhaps CD players.
🎧 Yeah, that's a, that's a good idea,
🎧 and also I thought maybe, you know, a set of dictionaries.
🎧 I heard him say he needed a good one.
🎧 The other thing he was saying last week was that his computer printer had broken.
🎧 Umm. No, I'd be really frightened about getting the wrong type.
🎧 Okay, yeah.
🎧 The other thing is something for the home.
🎧 Jill suggested a coffee maker.
🎧 I'll certainly find out what they cost.
🎧 Okay, have you got all that down?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 Now we need to think a little more about the money.
🎧 I know we've got a set amount from the Social Fund.
🎧 Right, what does that cover?
🎧 It's meant to cover the cost of the room.
🎧 And a certain amount for food.
🎧 And also drinks?
🎧 Oh yeah, certainly.
🎧 But will it be enough?
🎧 What we've done in the past is to ask guests to bring some snacks.
🎧 Right.
🎧 We don't ask them to bring more drinks because we figure that's...
🎧 that should come from the Social Fund.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 Anything else for the guests to bring?
🎧 Well, oh, some music,
🎧 because there'll be a tape deck there in the room, and we can have some dancing later on.
🎧 Anything else?
🎧 It's just a thought, but a couple of years ago we had a really good party where we set up...
🎧 you know, some simple games.
🎧 Yeah, great.
🎧 Wasn't it based on photos from the students and teachers?
🎧 That's right.
🎧 So we should ask the guests to bring photos.
🎧 Okay. I'll put it on the invitations.
🎧 Now the last thing is,
🎧 who shall we ask to do the speech?
🎧 Don't you think it might be nice to have one of the students?
🎧 Well then, the Student Leader?
🎧 Yeah, much better than the Director giving speeches again.
🎧 Okay then, I'll ask her.
🎧 Lovely!
🎧 So, is that all?
🎧 Looks like it.
🎧 Great! Thanks ever so much...

[031] Cam4 - Test 4 - Part 3

🎧 Hi Sue.
🎧 Hi Mike.
🎧 So what happened to you last week?
🎧 Oh, I was sick with the flu.
🎧 What's this I hear about a big assignment we've got to do?
🎧 Oh, well, basically, we've got to find two science experiments
🎧 to do with a group of 8-year-old children at the local primary school,
🎧 and we've got to complete it by the end of the week.
🎧 That sounds like hard work.
🎧 Where are we supposed to get the ideas for these experiments from?
🎧 Well, I managed to get hold of two books from the library.
🎧 Oh, well done!
🎧 How about if we take a look at the experiments in this book first
🎧 and see if anything looks suitable?
🎧 I can make notes as we go, about equipment and the purpose of the experiments.
🎧 Okay, let's see...
🎧 the first experiment is called 'Make your own hovercraft',
🎧 which sounds very ambitious!
🎧 Mind you, you only need 20 balloons and a table -
🎧 you don't need any special engines or anything like that!
🎧 What do you do with it all?
🎧 Er, you blow up the balloons and you balance the table on them,
🎧 upside down of course, and the kids get to ride around on it.
🎧 You know, the other kids sort of push them around the room.
🎧 The main purpose is to show how hovercrafts work,
🎧 and how things hover around on just a cushion of air.
🎧 Okay, that doesn't sound too bad.
🎧 Okay, ready for number two?
🎧 Now this one is called 'Unusual Measures of Lengths',
🎧 and you basically use lots of paperclips.
🎧 The kids go around the class measuring things -
🎧 you know, how long the desk is, and that sort of thing,
🎧 and then they all compare their answers.
🎧 And, basically, because not all paperclips are the same lengths,
🎧 they should come up with some strange answers.
🎧 It's supposed to demonstrate the importance of having fixed units of measurement.
🎧 Yeah, that's not bad.
🎧 Okay, now for number three you need rock salt or copper sulphate.
🎧 Oh, I'm not sure about that!
🎧 Well, just put down the rock salt then...
🎧 apart from that you only need a jar of water.
🎧 And basically you dissolve lots of salt into the water
🎧 and watch the crystals form,
🎧 so it basically teaches the kids about growing crystals.
🎧 Yeah, I suppose it would be nice to grow something.
🎧 Hmm, let's move on and have a look at number four.
🎧 Okay, this one is called 'Spinning colour wheel'.
🎧 It looks like you get some cardboard and draw a circle on it,
🎧 divide it into six equal segments and colour each one in using different colours,
🎧 then you thread a piece of string through the middle.
🎧 So we'd need some string as well.
🎧 Yes, sorry...
🎧 and you spin the wheel around
🎧 and if you can get it spinning fast enough,
🎧 hopefully the colours all merge and show up as white.
🎧 Oh, I didn't know that.
🎧 What's the principle behind it?
🎧 Well it's pretty elementary physics, really.
🎧 It teaches them about how white light or ordinary light is made up.
🎧 Hmm, well that doesn't sound too bad.
🎧 Now there's only one more left in this book isn't there?
🎧 What does that one say?
🎧 Um, well it's another one where they'd get to make something.
🎧 Sounds very interesting.
🎧 You need quite a lot of equipment actually -
🎧 a hand drill, an old record,
🎧 a pin or needle, some paper and a bolt.
🎧 Hmm, go on, what do they have to do?
🎧 Well, they basically make a record player.
🎧 The main idea is to teach them about recording sound,
🎧 but hopefully they'd also see that you need motion and an amplifier to make the sound heard.
🎧 Okay, well it does sound interesting.
🎧 Shall we go through all of those again and decide if any of them are going to be suitable?
🎧 Right, number one.
🎧 I thought this one sounded nice: there'd be lots of activity
🎧 and it doesn't need too much in the way of equipment.
🎧 Yes, that's true, but...
🎧 don't you think it's a bit risky to get a group of 8-year-olds pushing each other around a classroom like that?
🎧 Someone could get hurt.
🎧 No, I don't like the sound of that one at all!
🎧 Maybe you're right.
🎧 What about number two, with the paperclips?
🎧 It sounds tame enough.
🎧 Yes, a bit too tame if you ask me.
🎧 I think it needs to be something a bit more active and interesting than that, don't you?
🎧 Yes, I suppose you're right.
🎧 We won't get a very good mark if the children don't actually enjoy the experiments,
🎧 and I suppose we could turn them off science for good!
🎧 Well, what about the next one, number three?
🎧 Now, I quite like the idea of this one.
🎧 Yes, so do I,
🎧 but I seem to remember when we did it at high school
🎧 we had to wait up to a fortnight before we saw any halfway decent results.
🎧 Oh, yes well, that won't be any good then.
🎧 We'll only see the kids for one or two hours at the most.
🎧 Yes, and we have to do the experiments and write up our results within a week,
🎧 so that one won't do at all.
🎧 Okay, well, what did you think of number four?
🎧 I like the idea of it, but
🎧 do you think it will be a bit elementary for them?
🎧 Well, they are only eight you know!
🎧 I know, but you know what I mean.
🎧 Don't you think the activity itself is a bit babyish?
🎧 Hmm, maybe you're right.
🎧 They might have fun but, I mean, cutting out a circle and colouring it in?
🎧 Okay, well, what about number five?
🎧 I thought this one sounded a bit too good to be true - great equipment!
🎧 Yeah.
🎧 But don't you think it's a bit ambitious for this age group?
🎧 I mean, I don't want to start off something and then have to abandon it if they just can't cope with it.
🎧 I could see us ending up doing just about all of the work for them.
🎧 I guess you're right.
🎧 Oh well, maybe we could store that idea away for later.
🎧 Yep, let's hope this second book has something better!

[032] Cam4 - Test 4 - Part 4

🎧 Today we're going to look at one of my favourite fish -
🎧 the shark.
🎧 As you know, sharks have a reputation for being very dangerous creatures
🎧 capable of injuring or killing humans,
🎧 and I'd like to talk about sharks in Australia.
🎧 Sharks are rather large fish,
🎧 often growing to over 10 metres
🎧 and the longest sharks caught in Australia have reached sixteen metres.
🎧 Sharks vary in weight with size and breed, of course,
🎧 but the heaviest shark caught in Australia was a White Pointer -
🎧 that weighed 795 kilograms -
🎧 quite a size!
🎧 Sharks have a different structure to most fish:
🎧 instead of a skeleton made of bone,
🎧 they have a tough elastic skeleton of cartilage.
🎧 Unlike bone, this firm, pliable material is rather like your nose,
🎧 and allows the shark to bend easily as it swims.
🎧 The shark's skin isn't covered with scales, like other fish,
🎧 instead, the skin's covered with barbs, giving it a rough texture like sandpaper.
🎧 As you know, sharks are very quick swimmers.
🎧 This is made possible by their fins,
🎧 one set at the side and another set underneath the body,
🎧 and the tail also helps the shark move forward quickly.
🎧 Unlike other fish,
🎧 sharks have to keep swimming if they want to stay at a particular depth,
🎧 and they rarely swim at the surface.
🎧 Mostly, they swim at the bottom of the ocean,
🎧 scavenging and picking up food that's lying on the ocean floor.
🎧 While most other animals, including fish, hunt their prey by means of their eyesight,
🎧 sharks hunt essentially by smell.
🎧 They have a very acute sense of smell -
🎧 and can sense the presence of food long before they can see it.
🎧 In Australia, where people spend a lot of time at the beach,
🎧 the government has realised that it must prevent sharks from swimming near its beaches.
🎧 As a result, they've introduced a beach-netting program.
🎧 Beach-netting, or meshing, involves setting large nets parallel to the shore;
🎧 this means that the nets on New South Wales beaches are set on one day,
🎧 and then lifted and taken out to sea on the next day.
🎧 When shark-netting first began in 1939,
🎧 only the Sydney metropolitan beaches were meshed -
🎧 these beaches were chosen because beaches near the city are usually the most crowded with swimmers.
🎧 Ten years later, in 1949,
🎧 systematic meshing was extended to include the beaches to the south of Sydney.
🎧 As a result of the general success of the program in Sydney,
🎧 shark-meshing was introduced to the state of Queensland around 1970.
🎧 The New Zealand authorities also looked at it,
🎧 but considered meshing uneconomical - as did Tahiti in the Pacific.
🎧 At around the same time, South Africa introduced meshing to some of its most popular swimming beaches.
🎧 When meshing began, approximately 1500 sharks were caught in the first year.
🎧 However, this declined in the years that followed,
🎧 and since that time, the average annual catch has been only about 150 a year.
🎧 The majority of sharks are caught during the warmest months, from November to February,
🎧 when sharks are most active
🎧 and when both the air and the ocean are at their maximum temperature.
🎧 Despite quite large catches,
🎧 some people believe that shark meshing is not the best way to catch sharks.
🎧 It's not that they think sharks are afraid of nets, or because they eat holes in them,
🎧 because neither of these is true.
🎧 But meshing does appear to be less effective than some other methods,
🎧 especially when there are big seas with high rolling waves and strong currents
🎧 and anything that lets the sand move -
🎧 the sand that's holding the nets down.
🎧 When this moves the nets will also become less effective.
