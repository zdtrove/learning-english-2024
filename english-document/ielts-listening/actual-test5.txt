🎧 Okay, Ella. As you know, the deadline for this project is the end of the month, so we'd better plan it well.
🎧 Yes, I've already been thinking along those lines,
🎧 and I've decided we should divide this project into three phases:
🎧 the Pre-phase, then Phase 1, and then Phase 2,
🎧 with strict deadlines involved for each one.
🎧 Given that we have to finish this quickly, that sounds good. Tell me more.
🎧 The Pre-phase is the simplest.
🎧 We just need to allocate a space or a place to do our planning,
🎧 and this space will need to be quite big.
🎧 Sure, and we have to decide on the equipment needed as well.
🎧 Remember the last project, when we didn't have enough projectors to present our ideas?
🎧 We lost lots of time there.
🎧 Yes, that was a bad start.
🎧 That's why, after the Pre-phase is finished, I've allocated a mere three days for Phase One.
🎧 That will involve drawing the plans.
🎧 We'll need Jenna to help us.
🎧 And Marco.
🎧 Yes, but not Susan.
🎧 Susan is just far too busy to participate, as much as I'd like her in the team.
🎧 Let's just take Fred instead. He'll do.
🎧 Sure. Fred's not as experienced as Greg, but I agree, he'll do fine for this job.
🎧 Then it's straight into Phase 2, collecting, collating, analysing, and preparing the final report.
🎧 Can we do that in five days?
🎧 I think that's optimistic, which is why I scheduled six.
🎧 That's almost a week! Do we have that much time?
🎧 We do, and with the right people, six days should see the job done.
🎧 Who are the people for this phase? Arthur and Rob, right?
🎧 No, Arthur's got other things to do, and Rob's on leave,
🎧 so Mike alone will be the main man on this part.
🎧 He's done it before, so it should be fine.
🎧 But he may need some help with the smaller tasks.
🎧 Someone who is good with detail and procedures.
🎧 Hmmm. Peter's not free at the moment, so I can arrange Leo to chip in some time and advice.
🎧 Leo's very useful, particularly under pressure.
🎧 And that's everything sorted!
🎧 Well done Ella. This report should certainly be ready in time.
🎧 Okay, Ella, you've done a good job with the basic time frame of this project, but what about specifics?
🎧 What sort of specifics?
🎧 Well, things like information gathering.
🎧 Are we going to use questionnaires like we did last time?
🎧 I was thinking of using the Internet to ask people to give their views,
🎧 but you often get such silly responses when you do that.
🎧 I'm of the view that the best way to find out things is to ask people directly,
🎧 so that's what we'll do.
🎧 Okay, but that will take longer.
🎧 We'll probably even have to do some of the work at home.
🎧 No, I don't think so, as long as we stay back at work for some after-hours meetings.
🎧 Well, that's better than coming in early.
🎧 No one functions well in the morning.
🎧 Also, the final report will need at least two appendices.
🎧 Not only that, we'll have to attach a small booklet to the end,
🎧 containing printouts of the relevant parts from all the foreign websites we accessed.
🎧 That will take even more time.
🎧 Are you sure we can meet this deadline?
🎧 Yep, I've worked it all out, and I'm confident we can do it.
🎧 Phase 1 should be finished by the 5th,
🎧 leaving Phase 2 to begin about the 8th or 9th.
🎧 Now, there's a public holiday on the 10th,
🎧 Meaning that everything should be able to be submitted on the 15th,
🎧 and after that, we can relax,
🎧 and celebrate on the 25th when the Design Division gives us approval to go ahead.
🎧 Hah, you're assuming that the Design Division will approve this, and that's not guaranteed at all.
🎧 Oh come on Marcus, be positive.
🎧 You know this should be approved,
🎧 in fact, I'm even planning the celebration when this is all over.
🎧 Oh yeah, what's on the agenda, then?
🎧 Well, we definitely don't want a party in the office, do we?
🎧 We'll want to get away from this place,
🎧 and we're all too busy with our own lives and families to find a mutual time free for a dinner party,
🎧 so I thought we'd just buy some nice expensive gifts for everyone who participated.
🎧 We can just give these to the people here in the office.
🎧 That sounds fine to me, but make sure they're not too expensive.
🎧 The Budget Department will never approve the cost.
🎧 Don't worry; I know how much I can get away with.
🎧 Alright. I'll leave that with you.
🎧 
🎧 Hello there.
🎧 I was asked to tell you about the extent of the damage to the main building, caused by the recent storm.
🎧 Oh, that's right. I take it that most of the damage is just to the main building?
🎧 It is indeed, since the building is so old.
🎧 However, luckily, the damage is minor,
🎧 and all of it can be fixed in one day, given that we have five people in our team.
🎧 What will you be doing first? I understand you start at 8 in the morning.
🎧 That's right,
🎧 and we were going to remove the fallen tree,
🎧 but we've been told there are exams that morning,
🎧 and I'm sure the sound of those saws and other heavy equipment will disturb all the students,
🎧 so instead we'll fix that leaky roof.
🎧 That's a 4-hou job, since it involves substantial repair,
🎧 not like fixing broken windows, which can be done quite quickly.
🎧 So you'll fix the broken window after that, from midday?
🎧 We could do that,
🎧 but since we'll be working in the ceiling, it's more logical to get rid of those birds' nests there.
🎧 It's a small job but will require crawling inside the ceiling cavity,
🎧 which is not an easy exercise, so that will take about an hour.
🎧 But this is good, since by that time the exams should be over,
🎧 and we can address that tree which has been blown over,
🎧 after our 1-hour lunch break of course.
🎧 It will be quite noisy dealing with that, but it will be finished by three o'clock.
🎧 Some of our staff will then leave to fix things on another site,
🎧 an office nearby needs a new window,
🎧 but two of us, including myself, will remain here to paint over that discoloured patch of wall in your office.
🎧 Oh good, it looks so horrible at the moment.
🎧 Well, we'll certainly make it look good once again,
🎧 and in the last hour of our working day, we'll fix up that problem with the wiring.
🎧 Apparently the power doesn't go to one of the classrooms.
🎧 Probably some water has gotten into the fuse box,
🎧 so we'll just change a few wires, and clean up the moisture, and it should be fine.
🎧 I certainly appreciate all the effort you and your team are taking to fix things here,
🎧 but I do have one request.
🎧 And what is that?
🎧 You said you're going to paint the back wall in my office.
🎧 Will it be the same colour as before?
🎧 Yes, we'll make it a nice white colour.
🎧 Well that's the point. I'd prefer it to be yellow, to match the furniture.
🎧 The furniture is orange, actually, but I think yellow is a nice match.
🎧 Can you do that?
🎧 We can certainly do that. Yellow it is.
🎧 Certainly a prettier colour than just plain white,
🎧 or the blue in my kitchen at home for that matter.
🎧 And we can leave the paint can with you, in case you need to do some touch-ups,
🎧 or if the stain reappears.
🎧 I'll just leave it in the garden shed, the one next to the main classroom.
🎧 And incidentally, about those birds in the ceiling.
🎧 I was just investigating, and I heard the chirping of little baby birds in there,
🎧 so there must be some young ones in a nest.
🎧 I just thought you'd like to know that we can give them to a wildlife reserve.
🎧 There's one in the next suburb, so that should not be too much trouble.
🎧 Or you could give them to one of our teachers.
🎧 I have a colleague who can raise them.
🎧 I would say the wildlife reserve is a better option,
🎧 since the people there are used to dealing with animals,
🎧 and as for that fallen tree, we'll cut it up into small pieces
🎧 and that can be firewood in my house, so that won't be wasted either,
🎧 although the smoke will cause some pollution,
🎧 but I have a special licence for my fireplace, so no one can object to that.
🎧 I've noticed also that the university has a garden bin, for the smaller items,
🎧 leaves and sticks and bark, and so on,
🎧 so we can dispose of material in that, also.
🎧 You do have some waste piles out the back,
🎧 but a proper garden bin means that the material will be recycled,
🎧 and that's better for the environment, so you can rest assured we will use that.
🎧 
🎧 Well gentlemen, we've almost finished our second semester at this university.
🎧 What do you think of all the courses we attend?
🎧 On the whole, I'd say they're quite good,
🎧 apart from Social History, which I find to be a little too inexact.
🎧 Yes, the lecturer's style is also very very dull.
🎧 I certainly agree with you there,
🎧 although I would say that the textbook is more interesting. 'Welfare State'.
🎧 The subtitle says, 'An examination of social development in the 20th century.'
🎧 Yes, 'Welfare State' is a good book, but look how many pages it has.
🎧 458!
🎧 I agree. It's just too long to be easily read.
🎧 Far too long, although it's certainly well written in parts.
🎧 Yes, and if you compare it to the textbook for Cultural Studies, what's it called?
🎧 'Inner Views', I think.
🎧 No, that's the book for Media Studies, and we finished that subject last semester.
🎧 The book you're thinking of is 'In Perspective'.
🎧 Sorry, you're right. 'In Perspective'.
🎧 And the subtitle says, 'A comparison of social groups.'
🎧 Somewhat interesting, wouldn't you say?
🎧 Well, mildly so, as is the subject,
🎧 dealing as it does with such a wide variety of issues,
🎧 but the book itself certainly oversimplifies a very complex subject.
🎧 I agree. I also got annoyed at its constant oversimplification.
🎧 Life is more complicated than what it suggests.
🎧 Yes, but what you call 'oversimplifying' may well be considered 'clarifying'.
🎧 Look at this other textbook, 'Government in Action'.
🎧 Some may say that it also oversimplifies,
🎧 but it must do so in order to present a coherent picture of an equally complex subject.
🎧 'Government in Action'? Which subject...?
🎧 It's the textbook for 'Political Theory'.
🎧 Oh, I hate politics.
🎧 That's why I don't like the 'Active Leadership' subject, either.
🎧 And most of the stuff in that 'Political Theory' textbook is based on the American system.
🎧 You see, it's written by Americans, so it's not even relevant to us here.
🎧 I'd agree with you there,
🎧 it's not relevant to us at all, since our government uses the Westminster system.
🎧 Yes, I suppose that is a problem.
🎧 Well, it seems we all have certain criticisms about the textbooks we're using,
🎧 but at the same time, we all like some elements, at least, of the subjects we're studying.
🎧 What's your favourite subject, David?
🎧 I'm not sure. I like Political Theory, but...
🎧 Cultural Studies is by far the best, even better than Political Theory,
🎧 which I also like, but just not as much.
🎧 Why do you say that, Steve?
🎧 I was thinking, perhaps, Social History is worth considering as best.
🎧 Social History is good, but I made my choice because the subject is relevant to this modern society.
🎧 But so is Social History, and I like the historical element,
🎧 which the other subjects lack.
🎧 Even Political Theory examines history only briefly, and in a very narrow way,
🎧 so I'd say Social History is the most rewarding for me.
🎧 What about you, Susan?
🎧 I think Social History is certainly very good,
🎧 but Political Theory is, in fact, the best,
🎧 since basically, every human system boils down to politics.
🎧 So, despite a certain irrelevancy in the details,
🎧 the basic message remains as relevant as ever.
🎧 Oh Susan, you can't be serious.
🎧 Let's ask Olive, again.
🎧 She's over there.
🎧 Olive! Which subject do you think is the best?
🎧 Ah, a difficult question.
🎧 I'm very interested in culture,
🎧 so Cultural Studies is certainly my cup of tea,
🎧 but I'm politically active also, and hope to pursue this as a career,
🎧 so Political Theory would be the one I'd pick.
🎧 I don't believe it. Even with that irrelevant textbook?
🎧 Don't listen to him, Olive; you have a right to your own opinion.
🎧 
🎧 If you consider the farms of old - the type your father or grandfather grew up on,
🎧 they were small and labour-intensive, requiring lots of workers.
🎧 In addition, they often had a diversity of products,
🎧 be that animal or vegetable - say, cows and sheep,
🎧 or oranges and lemons, with some peaches,
🎧 and a few chickens on the side, for the production of eggs.
🎧 The many workers involved raised their families, who needed products and support services,
🎧 such as medical clinics and schools,
🎧 so the small country towns had mercantile activity,
🎧 store fronts, and community participation, with all ages present and a distinct town culture.
🎧 And how it has changed!
🎧 Travel to any small country town in virtually any developed country,
🎧 and you will often see that these places are now somewhat forlorn and deserted,
🎧 lacking life and vigour.
🎧 Many of the residents have long since moved towards the big cities,
🎧 so the country areas have become depopulated, and their downtowns empty.
🎧 This phenomenon is so predictable and widespread that it even has a name,
🎧 rural flight, or rural exodus,
🎧 and it has produced some fairly predictable problems.
🎧 As for the causes of rural exodus, the most obvious is the industrialisation of agriculture.
🎧 This comes in two aspects,
🎧 one of them being monocultural farming practices.
🎧 What this means is that it is now more efficient to have one product, and focus on its needs almost exclusively.
🎧 So, for example, animal husbandry will usually involve a single type of animal, say pigs,
🎧 but with huge factory farming techniques,
🎧 or, in other words, the second aspect: economies of scale.
🎧 This means instead of 200 pigs, there'll be 2000,
🎧 tightly fitted into small pens or cages,
🎧 with high density waste disposal and automatic feeding systems.
🎧 Yet despite this huge size, it can all be controlled by just a dozen farm workers pushing the right button.
🎧 You might not like it, but in a competitive market,
🎧 the cheaper the overheads, the better, and one can't argue with market economics.
🎧 It's simply the way of the modern world,
🎧 and it has changed the face of rural districts, mostly for the worst.
🎧 We can talk at length about the problem of rural exodus, but what about solutions?
🎧 Well, there is certainly some cause for hope,
🎧 since many are now feeling the negatives of increasing urbanisation,
🎧 negatives which the countryside generally does not have.
🎧 Thus, tourism, for example, is certainly one avenue of revenue and revitalisation.
🎧 The most important consideration here is that the local residents themselves participate in developing such initiatives,
🎧 and deciding what happens, since outsiders, be they state government or city-based planners,
🎧 do not fully understand the local settings,
🎧 the possibilities which may be on offer, or the town culture,
🎧 since even small rural areas can be highly distinctive from neighbouring ones.
🎧 For example, the Daylesford area has developed a tourist industry based on the natural springs there,
🎧 putting forward the angle that this water is relaxing and revitalising for the health.
🎧 There has been the development of spas, saunas, and small-scale accommodation within its picturesque hillsides.
🎧 And another solution is to utilise the predominant local product.
🎧 This takes advantage of the fact that many city-people are developing a dislike for factory-produce and packaged foodstuffs.
🎧 They are becoming interested in products that can be sold directly to them, at a cheaper price,
🎧 while preserving all the freshness from the tree or animal.
🎧 It is important here that the country area is not only characterised by a specific product,
🎧 but markets this idea well.
🎧 For example, many areas of country Victoria have developed widespread grape-growing and winemaking facilities,
🎧 and encourage wine tasting tourism -
🎧 now a thriving industry, with an international patronage.
🎧 Similarly, Harcourt is famous for apples,
🎧 Shepparton for mature cheeses,
🎧 and Mildura for its citrus products.
🎧 Such strategies, done well, give hope that rural areas can revitalise somewhat,
🎧 and once again be lively and interesting places to live in.
