🎧 Thorndyke's
🎧 Good morning. Is that Mr Thorndyke?
🎧 Speaking.
🎧 How can I help?
🎧 I've got quite a few things which need painting and fixing in the flat
🎧 and I wonder whether you'd be able to do the work.
🎧 I'm sure I'd be able to help but let me take down a few details.
🎧 Yes, of course.
🎧 Well, firstly, how did you hear about us?
🎧 It was my friend May Hampton…
🎧 you did some excellent work for her a couple of years ago.
🎧 Do you remember?
🎧 Oh, yes, that was in West Park Flats, lovely lady.
🎧 Yes, she is.
🎧 And what's your name, please?
🎧 It's Edith Pargetter.
🎧 can you spell your surname, please?
🎧 It's P-A-R-G-E-T-T-E-R.
🎧 Double T, right.
🎧 And do you live in West Park Flats as well?
🎧 No, actually it's East Park, Flat 4.
🎧 Oh, right, that's over the road, I seem to remember - quite difficult to get to.
🎧 Yes, it's at the back of the library.
🎧 Right, I know.
🎧 And what's your phone number?
🎧 875934
🎧 but I'm out a great deal in the afternoons and evenings.
🎧 So would the best time to ring you be in the morning?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 Fine. I've made a note of that.
🎧 Can I just ask, I'll be in a van and I know parking's rather difficult round your flats.
🎧 Where would you recommend?
🎧 Well, I always tell people in larger vehicles to park by the postbox on the other side of the road from the entrance.
🎧 Good, thanks.
🎧 And will you be able to give me a full itemised quote?
🎧 Oh, yes, I'll list all the jobs separately with individual prices.
🎧 That'd be a great help.
🎧 No problem.
🎧 Now, what would you like me to do?
🎧 Firstly and most urgently is in the kitchen.
🎧 With all the weather damage, the glass in the door has cracked and I'd need that fixing…
🎧 I presume you mean replacing?
🎧 Oh, yes. And as soon as possible…
🎧 What I'll do is come round tomorrow morning and do that immediately.
🎧 Oh, thank you so much.
🎧 The other things aren't so urgent but…
🎧 Now, I'll make a note of everything you want doing.
🎧 Well, in the kitchen I'd like some painting doing.
🎧 All the kitchen walls?
🎧 Just the area over the cooker.
🎧 It's very greasy…
🎧 Right… it does tend to get that way!
🎧 Yes!
🎧 Well, if you want a proper job done what I'd need to do is strip the old paint and plaster it about a week before I paint it.
🎧 Of course.
🎧 Now, May tells me you also do work in the garden.
🎧 That's right.
🎧 Well, I'd like you to replace a fence.
🎧 Just one?
🎧 Yes, at the far end.
🎧 Fine. Shouldn't be a problem.
🎧 And that's the lot.
🎧 Fine.
🎧 Yeah, as I say I can come round tomorrow morning to look over things with you.
🎧 Oh, that's great, thank you.
🎧 So, I'll look forward to seeing you tomorrow at…

🎧 Welcome to Manham Port, where a thousand years of history are brought to life.
🎧 All the family can enjoy a day out at Manham:
🎧 visit our copper mine, see models of the machinery it used,
🎧 have your photo taken in nineteenth century costume,
🎧 experience at first hand how people lived at different stages throughout history,
🎧 and especially how children studied, worked and played.
🎧 The port of Manham is located in beautiful and peaceful countryside,
🎧 on a bend in the great River Avon,
🎧 and developed here because it's the highest navigable point of the Avon -
🎧 boats can go no higher up this river -
🎧 and proved a handy place to load and unload cargo to and from the sea,
🎧 which is over 23 miles away.
🎧 A small port was already established here when, about 900 years ago, tin was discovered nearby,
🎧 though it wasn't until the Industrial Revolution, when a tremendous need for metals of all kinds developed,
🎧 that Manham expanded to become one of the busiest ports in the country.
🎧 And because it was already so busy, prospectors began to look for other minerals,
🎧 and by the end of the nineteenth century, lead, copper, manganese and arsenic were added to the cargos leaving Manham.
🎧 In the early days, the ores had been smelted - or processed - in the same area they were mined.
🎧 But, as demand grew, the smelting process required huge factory furnaces or fires to melt the metal from the rock
🎧 and there was not enough coal in the local area, so the rocks containing minerals had to be shipped long distances.
🎧 Sadly, in the twentieth century, the great port of Manham declined,
🎧 and thousands of workers were forced to emigrate out of the area.
🎧 The building at the port fell into disrepair,
🎧 and the place became almost forgotten.
🎧 But then, the Manham Trust was formed to conserve the historical resources of the area.
🎧 It organised scores of local volunteers to remove undergrowth to find the original outlines of the installations.
🎧 It then brought in paid professionals to match installations with maps of the original port complex
🎧 and to set about reconstructing it.
🎧 Today you can see the results of this ambitious programme of restoration.
🎧 The intention, and we believe this will be realised before the end of the year,
🎧 is to return Manham Port to the condition it reached at its peak as 'the greatest copper port in the country'.
🎧 But what can you do and see on your visit today?
🎧 Here are just a few highlights.
🎧 We suggest you start with the visit to the copper mine.
🎧 Travel on converted mining trains and journey into the depths of the mountain along seams once worked by hundreds of miners.
🎧 Watch out especially for the great pumping machines which rid the mine of water.
🎧 But please be warned that, like all mines, ours is very dark and closed in
🎧 and we do say that children under five and also dogs should NOT be taken into the mine.
🎧 The next recommended visit is to the village school.
🎧 While looking round the classrooms, take a special look at our display of games, which is one of the largest in the world.
🎧 And it's recommended that you time your visit to coincide with a guided tour.
🎧 This will give you the opportunity to ask lots of questions.
🎧 Near the school is the beautiful old sailing ketch called 'The George'.
🎧 You are welcome to board the boat and look round the cabins.
🎧 Look out for the ship's wheel which was missing until only five years ago
🎧 when it was dredged out of the silt by a local fisherman.
🎧 We have no idea how it got there
🎧 but it's been polished and proudly restored to its original place on the boat.
🎧 Please take care going down the ladders if you wish to visit the lower deck -
🎧 we don't recommend you allow young children to use them.
🎧 So we hope you have a memorable visit to Manham Port
🎧 and will tell your friends all about us.

[127] Cam10 - Test 4 - Part 3

🎧 Hi, Laura - could you spare a few minutes to talk about the work placement you did last summer?
🎧 I'm thinking of doing one myself…
🎧 Hi, Tim. Sure.
🎧 Didn't you do yours at an environmental services company?
🎧 That's right…
🎧 It's only a very small company
🎧 and they needed someone to produce a company brochure,
🎧 and I wanted to get some business experience
🎧 because I'm interested in a career in occupational psychology in a business environment.
🎧 It was good because I had overall responsibility for the project.
🎧 What kind of skills do you think you developed on the placement?
🎧 I mean, apart from the ones you already had…
🎧 Did you have to do all the artwork for the brochure, the layout and everything?
🎧 We hired the services of a professional photographer for that.
🎧 I did have to use my IT skills to a certain extent
🎧 because I cut and pasted text from marketing leaflets,
🎧 but that didn't involve anything I hadn't done before.
🎧 Do you think you got any better at managing your time and prioritizing things?
🎧 You always used to say you had trouble with that…
🎧 Oh, definitely.
🎧 There was so much pressure to meet the project deadline.
🎧 And I also got better at explaining things and asserting my opinions,
🎧 because I had to have weekly consultations with the marketing manager and give him a progress report.
🎧 It sounds as if you got a lot out of it then.
🎧 Absolutely.
🎧 It was really worthwhile…
🎧 But you know, the company benefited too…
🎧 Yes, they must have done.
🎧 After all, if they'd used a professional advertising agency to produce their brochure instead of doing it in-house,
🎧 presumably they'd have paid a lot more?
🎧 Oh, yes.
🎧 I worked it out -
🎧 it would have been 250% more.
🎧 And I thought the end result was good,
🎧 even though we did everything on site.
🎧 The company has quite a powerful computer
🎧 and I managed to borrow some scanning software from the university.
🎧 The new brochure looks really professional;
🎧 it enhances the image of the company straight away.
🎧 So in the long run it should help them to attract clients, and improve their sales figures?
🎧 That's the idea. Yeah.
🎧 Well, all in all it sounds very positive -
🎧 I think I will go ahead and apply for a placement myself.
🎧 How do I go about it?
🎧 It's easy enough to do,
🎧 because there's a government agency called STEP
🎧 - S-T-E-P
🎧 - that organises placements for students.
🎧 You should start by getting their booklet with all the details -
🎧 I expect you can download one from their website.
🎧 Actually, they've got copies in the psychology department -
🎧 I've seen them there.
🎧 I'll just go to the office and pick one up.
🎧 Right.
🎧 And then if I were you, after I'd looked at it I'd go over all the options with someone…
🎧 I suppose I should ask my tutor's advice.
🎧 He knows more about me than anyone.
🎧 One of the career officers would be better,
🎧 they've got more knowledge about the jobs market than your personal tutor would have.
🎧 OK…
🎧 And then when you know what you want you can register with STEP -
🎧 you'll find their address in the booklet.
🎧 And once you've registered they assign you to a mentor who looks after your application.
🎧 And then I suppose you just sit back and wait till you hear something?
🎧 They told me at the careers office that it's best to be proactive, and get updates yourself
🎧 by checking the website for new placement alerts.
🎧 Your mentor is supposed to keep you informed, but you can't rely on that.
🎧 I don't suppose it's a good idea to get in touch with companies directly, is it?
🎧 Not really…
🎧 But it is the company who notifies you if they want you to go for an interview.
🎧 You get a letter of invitation or an email from personnel departments.
🎧 And do I reply directly to them?
🎧 Yes, you do.
🎧 STEP only gets involved again once you've been made a job offer.
🎧 Right…
🎧 So, once you've had an interview you should let your mentor know what the outcome is?
🎧 I mean whether you're offered a job, and whether you've decided to accept it?
🎧 That's right.
🎧 They'll inform the careers office once a placement has been agreed,
🎧 so you don't have to do that.
🎧 Is that all then?
🎧 More or less.
🎧 Only once you've accepted an offer you'll probably have to supply a reference,
🎧 because the placement will be conditional on that.
🎧 And that's something you should ask your own tutor to provide.
🎧 He knows about your academic ability and also about your qualities, like reliability.
🎧 Well, thanks very much for the information -
🎧 I'm starting to look…

[128] Cam10 - Test 4 - Part 4

🎧 Today we're going to look at an important area of science, namely nanotechnology.
🎧 So what is it?
🎧 Nano means tiny,
🎧 so it's science and engineering on the scale of atoms and molecules.
🎧 The idea is that by controlling and rearranging atoms, you can literally create anything.
🎧 However, as we'll see, the science of the small has some big implications affecting us in many ways.
🎧 There's no doubt that nanotechnology promises so much for civilisation.
🎧 However, all new technologies have their teething problems.
🎧 And with nanotechnology, society often gets the wrong idea about its capabilities.
🎧 Numerous science-fiction books and movies have raised people's fears about nanotechnology -
🎧 with scenarios such as inserting little nano-robots into your body that monitor everything you do without you realising it,
🎧 or self-replicating nano-robots that eventually take over the world.
🎧 So how do we safeguard such a potentially powerful technology?
🎧 Some scientists recommend that nano-particles be treated as new chemicals with separate safety tests and clear labelling.
🎧 They believe that greater care should also be taken with nano-particles in laboratories and factories.
🎧 Others have called for a withdrawal of new nano products such as cosmetics
🎧 and a temporary halt to many kinds of nanotech research.
🎧 But as far as I'm concerned there's a need to plough ahead with the discoveries and applications of nanotechnology.
🎧 I really believe that most scientists would welcome a way to guard against unethical uses of such technology.
🎧 We can't go around thinking that all innovation is bad, all advancement is bad.
🎧 As with the debate about any new technology, it is how you use it that's important.
🎧 So let's look at some of its possible uses.
🎧 Thanks to nanotechnology, there could be a major breakthrough in the field of transportation
🎧 with the production of more durable metals.
🎧 These could be virtually unbreakable, lighter and much more pliable
🎧 leading to planes that are 50 times lighter than at present.
🎧 Those same improved capabilities will dramatically reduce the cost of travelling into space
🎧 making it more accessible to ordinary people and opening up a totally new holiday destination.
🎧 In terms of technology, the computer industry will be able to shrink computer parts down to minute sizes.
🎧 We need nanotechnology in order to create a new generation of computers
🎧 that will work even faster and will have a million times more memory
🎧 but will be about the size of a sugar cube.
🎧 Nanotechnology could also revolutionise the way that we generate power.
🎧 The cost of solar cells will be drastically reduced
🎧 so harnessing this energy will be far more economical than at present.
🎧 But nanotechnology has much wider applications than this
🎧 and could have an enormous impact on our environment.
🎧 For instance, tiny airborne nano-robots could be programmed to actually rebuild the ozone layer,
🎧 which could lessen the impact of global warming on our planet.
🎧 That's a pretty amazing thought, isn't it?
🎧 On a more local scale,
🎧 this new technology could help with the clean-up of environmental disasters
🎧 as nanotechnology will allow us to remove oil and other contaminants from the water far more effectively.
🎧 And, if nanotechnology progresses as expected -
🎧 as a sort of building block set of about 90 atoms -
🎧 then you could build anything you wanted from the bottom up.
🎧 In terms of production, this means that you only use what you need
🎧 and so there wouldn't be any waste.
🎧 The notion that you could create anything at all has major implications for our health.
🎧 It means that we'll eventually be able to replicate anything.
🎧 This would have a phenomenal effect on our society.
🎧 In time it could even lead to the eradication of famine
🎧 through the introduction of machines that produce food to feed the hungry.
🎧 But it's in the area of medicine that nanotechnology may have its biggest impact.
🎧 How we detect disease will change as tiny biosensors are developed to analyse tests in minutes rather than days.
🎧 There's even speculation nano-robots could be used to slow the ageing process, lengthening life expectancy.
🎧 As you can see, I'm very excited by the implications that could be available to us in the next few decades.
🎧 Just how long it'll take, I honestly don't know.
