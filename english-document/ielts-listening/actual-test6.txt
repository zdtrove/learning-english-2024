🎧 Hi, Richard. I'm glad I caught you here.
🎧 Can I just talk to you about something?
🎧 Our new flatmate - Anders - is not quite what I had hoped
🎧 I was wondering if you shared my concerns about some of his behaviour.
🎧 Ah, yes, Tom, I know what you mean, but we can't be entirely negative.
🎧 He has good points. I mean, at least he's quiet.
🎧 He doesn't play loud music all night, or bother others, or turn his TV up, disturbing everyone.
🎧 Sure, he's quiet, but remember our last flatmate?
🎧 He'd say 'hi' to you, and smile, and treat everyone politely.
🎧 In comparison, this new guy is very impolite.
🎧 He just grunts in reply, and sometimes ignores me altogether.
🎧 I guess that's just his way, y'know, just his character.
🎧 I don't think he realises he's being impolite, and it shouldn't matter to us too much.
🎧 We can just ignore him, too, and quietly live our own lives.
🎧 But his friends are hard to ignore, when they visit.
🎧 I know what you mean, but how often does that happen?
🎧 I rarely see them, maybe once or twice a month.
🎧 If they came more often, it might be a problem,
🎧 but as it is, such rare visits don't matter so much.
🎧 Wouldn't you say so?
🎧 Well, I'm not sure, since it's very obvious when they're here because of all the cigarette smoke in the house.
🎧 It stinks up the place, and you know we don't allow smoking on the premises.
🎧 Well, I've never seen them doing this.
🎧 Maybe they do it outside.
🎧 Perhaps we can talk to Anders about it.
🎧 Always remember, though, in one respect, he's a good tenant.
🎧 And it's the most important aspect.
🎧 The previous flatmate would always pay the rent late.
🎧 I know what you're going to say. This guy pays promptly.
🎧 But there's more to being a good tenant than prompt payment.
🎧 I mean, you need to turn off the TV, clean up your dishes, dress respectably, be polite, and so on.
🎧 I guess what I'm saying is that, basically, you need to co-operate with the others,
🎧 and this new guy fails significantly in this respect.
🎧 Okay, I suppose you have a point there.
🎧 I tell you what, Tom, why don't we talk to our new flatmate, Anders, about these issues?
🎧 If we throw him out, we'll have to go to all the trouble of finding another flatmate,
🎧 who might not necessarily be much better.
🎧 So, let's give the current guy a chance.
🎧 Here. I've got a piece of paper, so let's make a short list of issues to discuss with him.
🎧 Get it out into the open.
🎧 Sure. We'll give him one more chance.
🎧 So, write, 'Communication', and let's tell him to...
🎧 Well, we can't change a person's personality overnight,
🎧 so why don't we have a weekly tenants' meeting, and we can just ask him to attend?
🎧 That way we can get to know him better.
🎧 I'll write 'attend meeting', and we can take it from there.
🎧 Okay, but we have to tell him about his friends.
🎧 They can't just do whatever they want.
🎧 Write a heading 'friends' and then write 'don't smoke, anywhere, inside or outside'.
🎧 Well, instead of being so direct, and possibly causing offense,
🎧 I'll just write, 'follow rules',
🎧 and verbally mention the rules:
🎧 TV off by 10 pm, no loud music, or bad behaviour, including smoking.
🎧 Okay, do that, but I still think we need to specifically mention that last issue.
🎧 You know how I can't stand the habit,
🎧 so I'd like this to be another and separate point. Cigarettes! Strictly forbidden!
🎧 And it's important to include the 'strictly' here.
🎧 We can't pussyfoot around too much.
🎧 Sometimes directness is necessary.
🎧 Okay, I'll write that... 'forbidden'...
🎧 Okay. And what about cleaning duties?
🎧 Anders is a little too relaxed about that.
🎧 Dishes are sometimes not washed, dirty tea cups are left around the place, and so on.
🎧 So, write 'must do better!'
🎧 Yeah, again Tom, he might take that personally, and it could cause a scene.
🎧 I'd rather be general. I'll write 'must be done'
🎧 and I'll tell him that that's for everyone, not just him. Okay?
🎧 Okay. As long as he gets the message.
🎧 
🎧 Hello, everyone. Now, you know why I'm here.
🎧 You all work in a factory, and in this environment,
🎧 there always remains a significant possibility of accidents happening,
🎧 in which case, first aid will be necessary.
🎧 What is first aid?
🎧 It is the provision of emergency on-site care when an injury occurs,
🎧 and it is essential for everyone to know, if only simply, the steps which must be followed.
🎧 There are, of course, minor injuries which may happen,
🎧 not needing further medical care beyond the intervention of the first-aider,
🎧 but you can never be sure, thus the following steps must always be followed.
🎧 These can be abbreviated to the words "Dr ABC",
🎧 in other words. D-R-A-B-C.
🎧 The 'D' stands for "danger", and that's the first issue to keep in mind.
🎧 When an accident happens, immediately ascertain that the environment is safe -
🎧 that, for example, nothing else will fall or break or cause accidents.
🎧 If you, the first-aider, are also injured, the problem is even worse.
🎧 The 'R' stands for 'respond'.
🎧 You must then ascertain the best response.
🎧 Once all the danger has been eliminated, and the distress calls sent out,
🎧 the appropriate action is, obviously, to help the injured party.
🎧 Alright, that leads to 'A', which stands for "airway".
🎧 In order to stay alive, all people need to have an open airway to allow breathing.
🎧 A conscious person will automatically clear their own airway,
🎧 but if unconscious, this may not happen.
🎧 The brain is stopped or hindered from properly directing the body
🎧 and, obviously, in the worst case, death can result,
🎧 for this reason, the injured person is normally put into the 'recovery' position -
🎧 placed on the side, tilting the head back, and ensuring that there are no blockages in the mouth.
🎧 To free any such blockages, the back can be slapped,
🎧 or the chest compressed, allowing anything to be spat out.
🎧 Now that the airway is free, check for 'B' or 'breathing'.
🎧 If breathing is not happening, or is irregular,
🎧 the first-aider may have to assist with what is technically known as cardiopulmonary resuscitation,
🎧 or more commonly, CPR.
🎧 This involves breathing for the patient, through mouth-to-mouth contact,
🎧 while periodically massaging the heart through compressions to the chest.
🎧 This combination allows blood, and oxygen, to flow around the body, keeping the patient alive,
🎧 hopefully until medics, such as doctors, advanced first-aiders, or ambulance staff, arrive.
🎧 Now, it's certainly good to have knowledge of emergency first aid
🎧 but. obviously, the best situation is simply not to have accidents occur in the first place,
🎧 for that, you need to be aware of safety issues,
🎧 but just saying "be aware" does not usually achieve much.
🎧 It is more important to have an appointed person whose job is to ensure awareness and work-safety.
🎧 Safety inspections would obviously be part of their job,
🎧 whereby they can make sure, for example, that the first-aid boxes are fully equipped.
🎧 Another idea is to put posters on the walls,
🎧 but, interestingly, research has proven that these tend to be ignored,
🎧 becoming just part of the wallpaper - seen, but not put into practice.
🎧 It is much better if everyone is just instilled to not be reckless,
🎧 that is, to not rush into situations without thinking about the possibility of accidents,
🎧 and instilling this mindset is part of the job of the safety officer.
🎧 Some other suggestions are ongoing first-aid training,
🎧 and "no accident" reward or star systems.
🎧 These have had some success, but nothing beats a regular meeting, say, once a month,
🎧 in which the subject of safety is brought to the attention of everyone,
🎧 and any outstanding issues related to this are thoroughly discussed.
🎧 
🎧 Hi, Nicole.
🎧 As you know, we've got to decide on the best ways this university can reduce its waste.
🎧 You inspected the eastern campus, and I did the western buildings.
🎧 Did you do all the interviews as well?
🎧 Yes, I interviewed all the staff, who made some good observations,
🎧 and I interviewed some of the students.
🎧 The students said little that was interesting.
🎧 They don't seem to care that much.
🎧 It was the cleaners, surprisingly, who revealed the most relevant facts.
🎧 That's not surprising to me.
🎧 They empty all the bins, so they see the waste first-hand,
🎧 whereas the staff just throw things away without thinking.
🎧 What item was most commonly disposed of?
🎧 Well, it really depended on where I interviewed.
🎧 In the cafeteria precinct,
🎧 obviously paper plates and cups were thrown away all over the place.
🎧 There was almost no attempt at recycling.
🎧 However, across the university in general,
🎧 it was paper copying that filled up most bins,
🎧 far more than plastic, or other forms of waste.
🎧 Do people care about this, then?
🎧 Well, some do, if you can believe them.
🎧 I must have interviewed about 30% of customers in the cafeteria,
🎧 and the results were mixed.
🎧 Out of all the people I interviewed, well over half,
🎧 maybe about 55% of them, were quite honest about it,
🎧 telling me that they had little concern.
🎧 The other fraction, 45%, were more troubled.
🎧 Yes, but do they do anything about it?
🎧 Surprisingly, quite a significant percentage do do something,
🎧 even if they aren't particularly concerned.
🎧 I mean, small things.
🎧 About 10% bring their own cups to the cafeteria, for example,
🎧 and at least 1/3 said they use recycling bins,
🎧 so, in total, it's an equal split between those who do something, or those who don't.
🎧 So why do so many people remain inactive,
🎧 particularly over an issue they should care about more?
🎧 I think they do care, and many of them are prepared to do something.
🎧 Obviously, there's an element of laziness,
🎧 but I'd say that it's relatively small.
🎧 If they knew what to do, and if stringent systems existed,
🎧 or if the importance of this was made clearer to them,
🎧 I'm sure you'd see a much larger percentage of people actively working towards helping our environment.
🎧 Well, there's cause for optimism, at least.
🎧 Clearly then, there's a significant waste of paper here at this university,
🎧 so I've worked out one practical suggestion which could help reduce it -
🎧 specifically, the waste from the excess photocopying.
🎧 Let me hear it, then.
🎧 Ah obviously, for a start,
🎧 we've got to ensure that people, including the staff,
🎧 without exception, copy both sides of a page.
🎧 We can't tolerate single-sided copying. It's just far too wasteful.
🎧 Absolutely. Just more trees being chopped down.
🎧 But as people are doing copying,
🎧 there may be adjustments, and practice copying,
🎧 producing single-sided copies or blank pages not wanted and not intended for use.
🎧 These need to be deposited into a tray for intended recycling -
🎧 you know, for recopying onto the blank side of the page.
🎧 But people don't usually do that.
🎧 I'm afraid it's just human nature.
🎧 No matter how unimportant the copying is, they prefer to use fresh paper.
🎧 Yeah, I agree with you,
🎧 which is why you need to display these papers right in front of everyone,
🎧 with a clear sign, 'Please Reuse', to make it easy for them to do so.
🎧 They still won't do it.
🎧 I know. That's why you take some of these papers, and regularly stack them inside the copier,
🎧 in a special tray, once a day, say, in the morning.
🎧 Well, that's getting better, making it easier for them to use the paper,
🎧 but still, I'm afraid many won't.
🎧 That's why you allow everyone to select this tray when copying.
🎧 You distribute numbers or codes to every person,
🎧 giving them special access to this recycling tray.
🎧 Every time they use papers from this, it's tallied up to their account.
🎧 I know I'm sounding a bit negative, or even cynical here...
🎧 but why should they bother using that tray?
🎧 Because the person who does the most copying from this recycling tray gets, say, a cinema pass,
🎧 or lottery ticket, or some other sort of reward.
🎧 Ah, right! Now that's a system which might just work.
🎧 Let's trial it in the office and see what happens.
🎧 
🎧 We all know about the role of carbon dioxide in causing global warming.
🎧 Obviously, society needs to reduce the release of carbon dioxide, otherwise known as CO2.
🎧 This gas comes from the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil,
🎧 and it is virtually impossible for society to prevent, or even limit such activity.
🎧 Our need for energy and power is just too great.
🎧 Instead, a more practical idea is to collect the carbon dioxide from the burning process,
🎧 for example, directly from the chimneys of power stations,
🎧 and somehow prevent this gas from being released into the environment.
🎧 To do that, you need to store it somehow, and that has to be essentially forever.
🎧 It is perhaps for this reason that many believe that,
🎧 rather than storing the carbon dioxide as a gas,
🎧 it is better to react it with metal oxides, such as magnesium or calcium,
🎧 which results in the formation of a hard carbonate material.
🎧 The gas is, in effect, turned into a stable and unreactive solid,
🎧 which can simply be dumped anywhere.
🎧 This process actually occurs naturally, although very very slowly,
🎧 and is one cause of the surface limestone in the world.
🎧 But this slow reaction speed is the problem.
🎧 Even when enhancing this process through high temperature and pressure,
🎧 or pre-treatment of the mineral, it is still far too slow to be economical.
🎧 One other technique which has been suggested is to pump the gas to the bottom of the ocean,
🎧 where it would react with compounds in the seawater, forming carbonic acid.
🎧 However, this alternative has now been ruled out.
🎧 The CO2 may be removed from the atmosphere,
🎧 but the high oceanic acidity which would result raises its own set of problems,
🎧 mostly with all the delicate life and the intricate food chains in the seawater,
🎧 some on which we ourselves depend,
🎧 and that's something which no one wants to experiment with.
🎧 Perhaps because of the lack of alternatives,
🎧 the most commonly discussed solution to the problem of disposing of carbon dioxide is to pump the gas underground -
🎧 a technique known as 'geosequestration'.
🎧 In this system, the CO2, for example,
🎧 could be pumped into underground pockets within depleted oil wells, or disused coal tunnels.
🎧 This carries, however, three serious disadvantages,
🎧 namely: the risk of leaks, the considerable costs involved,
🎧 and finally, the unproven effectiveness.
🎧 Let us look at those three disadvantages in detail.
🎧 Firstly, there is the risk of leaks.
🎧 Although the gas would be deep and sealed over by masses of rock and earth,
🎧 the huge pressures in these spaces would turn the gas into a liquid state
🎧 capable of moving through rock fissures or faults.
🎧 This could allow the gas to eventually be released to the surface.
🎧 Since CO2 is heavier than air,
🎧 and thus pushes oxygen aside,
🎧 such leaks could result in the suffocation of thousands, or tens of thousands of people -
🎧 certainly not a consequence to be taken lightly.
🎧 Natural CO2 leakage from volcanic build-up has already witnessed such deadly events.
🎧 The other problem of geosequestration is the cost.
🎧 The time and effort spent on materials and construction,
🎧 primarily the pipework through which the gas would travel, does not come cheaply.
🎧 So, if this system were to be implemented in, say, coal-fired power plants,
🎧 the extra cost would have to be paid by the electricity user,
🎧 whose bills would almost double as a consequence.
🎧 Few people are prepared to pay this much simply to make a small dent on the effects of global warming.
🎧 And this leads to the final problem.
🎧 The most basic question is whether geosequestration actually reduces global warming.
🎧 The problem here is that the energy needed to create
🎧 and drive the sequestration process would require approximately
🎧 a quarter of a coal-fired electricity plant's output.
🎧 In other words, the plant would have to burn one quarter more of its coal
🎧 just to account for the sequestration of the carbon dioxide,
🎧 and with coal producing other noxious pollutants,
🎧 such as sulphur, ash, and heavy metals,
🎧 the environment is hardly benefited at all.
🎧 Nevertheless, there are many active experimental efforts underway,
🎧 primarily in oil production sites.
🎧 These are small but intensively monitored and analysed.
🎧 All we can say now is that the jury is still out on whether underground carbon storage will one day be feasible.
