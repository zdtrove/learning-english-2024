[061] Cam6 - Test 4 - Part 1

🎧 Conference Centre Reservations. Good morning.
🎧 Hi. I'm interested in the computing conference next month.
🎧 Future Directions in Computing?
🎧 Yes, that's right.
🎧 Could I ask you a few questions about it?
🎧 Of course.
🎧 OK.
🎧 I know the conference is for three days
🎧 but actually I want to attend on the Friday and Saturday only.
🎧 Will that work out to be any cheaper?
🎧 Let me have a look.
🎧 Well, you could register for the two days separately,
🎧 but that wouldn't actually save you very much
🎧 as it still costs £35 for each day.
🎧 In fact, if you could register for the three days,
🎧 you also get an invitation to a free dinner on the Saturday night,
🎧 so that's probably the better option.
🎧 Right, I'll do that.
🎧 How much will the fees be in that case?
🎧 It's £75.
🎧 All right.
🎧 I'd like to register for the full three days.
🎧 Now, can I pay that by credit card?
🎧 I'm afraid not.
🎧 You'll have to send a cheque to us,
🎧 or you can pay at the conference office.
🎧 Fine.
🎧 So it's probably easiest if I pay by cheque.
🎧 Now then, what else do I need to arrange?
🎧 Right. How about accommodation?
🎧 I guess that's not included in the price?
🎧 No, I'm sorry, it's not,
🎧 but we do have a few rooms available for delegates at the conference centre if you'd like.
🎧 Those are very cheap but if you're interested you'll need to book soon,
🎧 because there's always a heavy demand for them.
🎧 They are only £15 per night,
🎧 but they are very basic and you'd have to get your own breakfast,
🎧 because they don't provide you with that.
🎧 But it's very convenient,
🎧 because it's in the same building as the conference rooms.
🎧 Uhuh.
🎧 Or there's a very reasonable guest house which is £25 per night.
🎧 And I think that includes your breakfast.
🎧 Is it close to the conference centre?
🎧 It would be about a ten-minute walk away from here.
🎧 I see.
🎧 That sounds quite reasonable.
🎧 The details are all in our conference pack, which I'll send you.
🎧 Great, thanks.
🎧 That'll be very useful.
🎧 Oh, and can you also send me an application form?
🎧 Of course.
🎧 I'll get that in the post to you straight away.
🎧 Is there anything else?
🎧 Yes, actually.
🎧 Can you tell me where exactly the conference centre is?
🎧 Well, it's on South Park Road and it's right at the end of the road next to the library.
🎧 It's a ten-minute taxi ride from the station
🎧 and will cost you £5.
🎧 Otherwise, you can take the bus which runs every half an hour from the station,
🎧 that's the 21A,
🎧 and it brings you straight to the conference centre.
🎧 Right, got that.

[062] Cam6 - Test 4 - Part 2

🎧 Good morning and welcome, everybody.
🎧 I'm Jenny Stewart
🎧 and I'm the Staff Manager here at the exhibition centre.
🎧 We're expecting this year's International Travel Exhibition
🎧 to attract over 10,000 visitors a day, ladies and gentlemen,
🎧 and you are among the 200 extra staff recruited to help look after them.
🎧 Now, to help things run smoothly,
🎧 we have divided you into four teams -
🎧 the blue team, the green team, the red team, and the yellow team.
🎧 So first, I'll explain how the teams are divided up,
🎧 and then we'll be giving you colour-coded T-shirts so we can identify you more easily.
🎧 First of all, those who will be looking after the phones
🎧 and handling all calls regarding the exhibition,
🎧 you will be on the red team.
🎧 Now, we've also put the entrance staff on the red team
🎧 and you'll be stamping the entrance tickets and giving out publicity leaflets, okay?
🎧 Those of you involved in distributing entrance tickets will be on the yellow team
🎧 and we've also put those of you who'll be staffing the information booths around the conference centre on the yellow team, so...
🎧 you'll be getting a yellow T-shirt.
🎧 Now, most of the hospitality staff have been put in the blue team,
🎧 so the chefs among you and the kitchen hands will all need a blue T-shirt, but...
🎧 because of the sheer numbers,
🎧 all waiting staff will be on the yellow team,
🎧 and this includes the bar staff among you.
🎧 Those who will be monitoring and directing the traffic in the car parks are on the green team,
🎧 so you'll need to get a green T-shirt.
🎧 This year, we've also employed a considerable number of attendants
🎧 to direct the human traffic around the conference centre.
🎧 Now, you'll be working in the exhibition hall at all times,
🎧 giving directions and generally helping people whenever you can,
🎧 and you will be in the red team, so please collect a red T-shirt.
🎧 Right, now that everyone knows what team they're in,
🎧 we'll get on with the orientation and training programme
🎧 and first, I'll run through the rest of today's programme,
🎧 which you should have in front of you,
🎧 so that you can get a general idea of what else is in store today.
🎧 This introduction finishes at 9.30
🎧 and then you'll be hearing from Anne Smith.
🎧 Anne works in the accounts department on level two
🎧 and she looks after all temporary staff,
🎧 and so she is the person to see if you have any problems regarding pay.
🎧 Anne will be explaining when and how you get this.
🎧 She will also be handing out your tax forms.
🎧 And I will just stress that all tax forms must be completed
🎧 and returned to Anne before your pay can be processed.
🎧 Following Anne's talk you'll hear from Peter Chen, our Conference Manager,
🎧 and he will be going over a plan of the conference centre with you,
🎧 which will help you to orient yourselves.
🎧 He will also go through the security arrangements with you
🎧 and show you the fire exits.
🎧 Then at 10.30,
🎧 there will be a coffee break in the staff canteen,
🎧 which is located down on the ground floor.
🎧 Now, after the break,
🎧 we'll be moving to a different location for a video presentation,
🎧 so instead of coming back here,
🎧 we'd like you all to go to Lecture Room 311.
🎧 You'll find it on this same level, just down the hall,
🎧 and there you will be shown a video about important safety issues in the workplace,
🎧 called Safety at Work.
🎧 We'll finish off the morning with lunch,
🎧 which should give everyone a chance to meet and get to know each other,
🎧 and we'll be serving you a buffet lunch in the Main Hall,
🎧 which is on the first floor, from 12.00 o'clock.
🎧 After lunch, you'll be divided up into your teams to meet your team leaders
🎧 and we're hoping to be all finished by 3.00, so...
🎧 I won't delay you any longer...

[063] Cam6 - Test 4 - Part 3

🎧 Good afternoon. Can I help you?
🎧 Good afternoon.
🎧 Yes, I've just transferred to the School of Education,
🎧 and I'd like information about joining the library.
🎧 Well, the School of Education has libraries on two sites, as I'm sure you know.
🎧 This one here is the Fordham Site, and the other is on Castle Road.
🎧 And is there any difference between the two libraries?
🎧 Not in terms of their facilities.
🎧 Access to online databases and the Internet is available at both sites
🎧 and each site has a range of reference materials on education.
🎧 Oh yes. I see.
🎧 But the Castle Road site has books on the sociology of education
🎧 and a collection of textbooks and teaching resources
🎧 covering most of the subjects taught in secondary schools.
🎧 Ah, right,
🎧 but I'm training to be a primary teacher
🎧 so I need to look at materials for the five to eleven age group.
🎧 Then you've come to the right place.
🎧 At Fordham we hold material relating to primary education,
🎧 as well as special needs,
🎧 but of course you'll need to familiarise yourself with both sites to make the most of our resources.
🎧 You haven't mentioned periodicals.
🎧 Are they held at both sites?
🎧 Current issues, yes but if you want to look at back issues
🎧 you'll need to use the CD-ROM databases which are held here at Fordham.
🎧 I see.
🎧 Now, about borrowing books.
🎧 I'm living out of town, so I'm hoping I can borrow quite a few items,
🎧 and cut down on the number of trips I have to make.
🎧 Right, well, members can borrow two books at a time from each site.
🎧 Only two books?
🎧 Only two from each site, but that's four altogether.
🎧 Oh I see,
🎧 and how long can I hang on to them for?
🎧 The borrowing period is one month, but of course books can be renewed.
🎧 You can renew any item a maximum of three times.
🎧 Do I have to come to the library to do that?
🎧 No, you can do it by telephone or email,
🎧 but you can't renew overdue books this way,
🎧 only before or on the due date stamped in the book.
🎧 We'll need your full name, your borrower number
🎧 and the name of the site library you borrowed the items from.
🎧 So theoretically I can borrow books for up to three months -
🎧 is that what you're saying?
🎧 Yes, provided they're not recalled.
🎧 So, what happens then?
🎧 Well, sometimes an item is requested by another borrower,
🎧 in which case we'd send you a letter,
🎧 and you'd have to return the book within seven working days.
🎧 Don't forget we're closed on Sundays.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 I expect it'll take me a while to find what I need.
🎧 There's such a lot here.
🎧 Yes, there is,
🎧 but if you need help getting started,
🎧 this term we're running three study skills workshops.
🎧 Oh?
🎧 What are they on?
🎧 Er, let me see.
🎧 The first one's on resources...
🎧 yes, here it is.
🎧 How to use the library's resources.
🎧 That includes everything, not just the print and technical resources.
🎧 That sounds useful.
🎧 Is there anything on using the Internet?
🎧 Er, let's see.
🎧 The one on the Internet for beginners was last term.
🎧 This term it's finding research materials online.
🎧 That sounds interesting too,
🎧 hm, what's the last one?
🎧 It's a workshop on dissertations.
🎧 What do you mean? how to write one?
🎧 Er, no it's more to do with academic writing conventions,
🎧 you know, writing a bibliography and how to refer to sources in your text.
🎧 That sort of thing.
🎧 Anyway, here's a leaflet with information about all three.
🎧 Thanks a lot.
🎧 That'll be very useful.
🎧 You're welcome.

[064] Cam6 - Test 4 - Part 4

🎧 Well, most people think that lions only come from Africa.
🎧 And you would be forgiven for thinking this,
🎧 because in fact, most lions do come from Africa.
🎧 But this hasn't always been the case.
🎧 If we go back 10,000 years, we would find that there were lions roaming vast sections of the globe.
🎧 But now, unfortunately,
🎧 only very small sections of the lions' former habitat remain.
🎧 My particular interest is Asiatic lions,
🎧 which are a sub-species of African lions.
🎧 It's almost 100,000 years since the Asiatic lions split off and developed as a sub-species.
🎧 At one time the Asiatic lion was living as far west as Greece
🎧 and they were found from there,
🎧 in a band that spread east through various countries of the Middle East,
🎧 all the way to India.
🎧 In museums, you can now see Greek coins that have clear images of the Asiatic lion on them.
🎧 Most of them are dated at around 500 B.C.
🎧 However, Europe saw its last Asiatic lion roaming free 2000 years ago.
🎧 Over the next nineteen hundred years the numbers of Asiatic lions in the other areas declined steadily,
🎧 but it was only in the nineteenth century that they disappeared from everywhere but India.
🎧 So, how can you tell an Asiatic lion from an African lion,
🎧 with which you're probably more familiar?
🎧 Well, in general, Asiatic lions are not as big as African lions.
🎧 The colour is more or less the same, but the appearance of the mane is different -
🎧 that's the hair around the lion's face and neck.
🎧 The Asiatic lion's mane is noticeably shorter than the African lion's.
🎧 Asiatic lions also have a long fold of skin on their undersides,
🎧 whereas not many African lions have this.
🎧 Well, I'd like to talk to you now about the Gir Sanctuary in India.
🎧 That's where I've just come back from.
🎧 The sanctuary was established specifically to protect the Asiatic lion.
🎧 It's 1.450 square kilometres in area and most of it is forest.
🎧 There are now around 300 Asiatic lions in India
🎧 and almost all of them are in this sanctuary.
🎧 But despite living in a sanctuary, which makes them safe from hunters,
🎧 they still face a number of problems that threaten their survival.
🎧 One of these is the ever-present danger of disease.
🎧 This is what killed more than a third of Africa's Serengeti lions in 1994,
🎧 and people are fearful that something similar could happen in the Gir Sanctuary
🎧 and kill off many of the Asiatic lions there.
🎧 India's lions are particularly vulnerable because they have a limited gene pool.
🎧 The reason for this is interesting -
🎧 it's because all of them are descended from a few dozen lions that were saved by a prince
🎧 who took a particular interest in them.
🎧 He was very wealthy, and he managed to protect them -
🎧 otherwise they'd probably have died out completely.
🎧 When you see the Asiatic lion in India,
🎧 what you sense is enormous vitality.
🎧 They're very impressive beasts
🎧 and you would never guess that they had this vulnerability when you look at them.
🎧 The Asiatic lions don't have the Gir Sanctuary to themselves, I should add.
🎧 They actually share it with about 2000 farmers.
🎧 A significant proportion of the lions' diet is made up of the livestock of these farmers -
🎧 goats, chickens and so on -
🎧 as much as a third, in fact.
🎧 And they've even been known to attack humans, especially in times of drought.
🎧 One final piece of interesting information -
🎧 in ancient India, one of the greatest tests of leadership for a man was to fight a lion.
🎧 Now it seems, in modern India it will be a great test to see if the lion can be saved.
🎧 I'm sure this is something that all of you will share concern for too.
