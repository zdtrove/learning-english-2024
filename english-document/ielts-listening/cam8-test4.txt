[093] Cam8 - Test 4 - Part 1

🎧 Hello, West Bay Hotel. Can I help you?
🎧 Oh, good morning.
🎧 I'm ringing about your advertisement in the Evening Gazette.
🎧 Is that the one for temporary staff?
🎧 That's right.
🎧 Yes.
🎧 I'm afraid the person who's dealing with that isn't in today,
🎧 but I can give you the main details if you like.
🎧 Yes, please.
🎧 Could you tell me what kind of staff you are looking for?
🎧 We're looking for waiters at the moment.
🎧 There was one post for a cook, but that's already been taken.
🎧 Oh right.
🎧 What are the hours of work?
🎧 There are two different shifts -
🎧 there's a day shift from 7 to 2
🎧 and a late shift from 4 till 11.
🎧 And can people choose which one they want to do?
🎧 Not normally, because everyone would choose the day shift I suppose.
🎧 You alternate from one week to another.
🎧 Okay. I'm just writing all this down.
🎧 What about time off?
🎧 You get one day off
🎧 and I think you can negotiate which one you want,
🎧 it's more or less up to you.
🎧 But it has to be the same one every week.
🎧 Do you know what the rates of pay are?
🎧 Yes, I've got them here.
🎧 You get £5.50 an hour,
🎧 and that includes a break.
🎧 Do I have to go home to eat or…
🎧 You don't have to.
🎧 You can get a meal in the hotel if you want to,
🎧 and there's no charge for it so you might as well.
🎧 Oh good.
🎧 Yes, so let's see.
🎧 I'd get er..., 221, no, no, £231 a week?
🎧 You'd also get tips.
🎧 Our guests tend to be quite generous.
🎧 Erm, is there a uniform?
🎧 What about clothes?
🎧 Yes, I forgot to mention that.
🎧 You need to wear a white shirt, just a plain one,
🎧 and dark trousers.
🎧 You know, not green or anything like that.
🎧 And we don't supply those.
🎧 That's okay, I've got trousers,
🎧 I'd just have to buy a couple of shirts.
🎧 What about anything else?
🎧 Do I need a waistcoat or anything?
🎧 You have to wear a jacket, but the hotel lends you that.
🎧 I see.
🎧 One last thing - I don't know what the starting date is.
🎧 Just a minute, I think it's sometime around the end of June.
🎧 Yes, the 28th, in time for the summer.
🎧 That's great. I'm available from the 10th.
🎧 Oh good.
🎧 Well, if you can call again you need to speak to the Service Manager.
🎧 Her name's Jane Urwin,
🎧 that's URWIN,
🎧 and she'll probably arrange to meet you.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 And when's the best time to ring?
🎧 Could you call tomorrow?
🎧 She usually starts checking the rooms at midday,
🎧 so before then if you can, so she'll have more time to chat.
🎧 I'll just give you her number because she's got a direct line.
🎧 Thanks.
🎧 It's 832009.
🎧 823009?
🎧 832.
🎧 Oh, okay.
🎧 Yes, I'll do that.
🎧 And by the way, she will ask you for a reference,
🎧 so you might like to be thinking about that.
🎧 You know, just someone who knows you and can vouch for you.
🎧 Yes, no problem.
🎧 Well, thanks very much for your help.
🎧 You're welcome.
🎧 Bye.
🎧 Bye.

[094] Cam8 - Test 4 - Part 2

🎧 Good morning and welcome again to Your City Today.
🎧 With me today is Graham Campbell, a councillor from the city council.
🎧 He'll be telling us about the plan to improve the fast-growing suburb of Red Hill.
🎧 Good morning Graham and welcome to the show.
🎧 Good morning, Carol.
🎧 Now, Graham, I understand that there has been a lot of community consultations for the new plan?
🎧 Yes, we've tried to address some of the concerns that local groups told us about.
🎧 People we've heard from are mainly worried about traffic in the area,
🎧 and, in particular, the increasing speed of cars near schools.
🎧 They feel that it is only a matter of time before there is an accident as a lot of the children walk to the school.
🎧 So we're trying to do something about that.
🎧 Another area of concern is the overhead power lines.
🎧 These are very old and a lot of people we spoke to asked if something could be done about them.
🎧 Well, I'm happy to report
🎧 the power company have agreed to move the power lines underground at a cost of $800,000.
🎧 I think that will really improve the look of the area, as well as being safer.
🎧 That's good to know,
🎧 but will that mean an increase in rates for the local businesses in that area?
🎧 Well, the power company have agreed to bear the cost of this themselves after a lot of discussion with the council.
🎧 This is wonderful news
🎧 as the council now has some extra funds for us to put into other things like tree planting and art work.
🎧 Now, we've also put together a map which we've sent out to all the residents in the area.
🎧 And on the map we've marked the proposed changes.
🎧 Firstly, we'll plant mature pine trees to provide shelter and shade just to the right of the supermarket in Days Road.
🎧 In order to address the traffic problems,
🎧 the pavements on the corner of Carberry and Thomas Street will be widened.
🎧 This will help to reduce the speed of vehicles entering Thomas Street.
🎧 We think it's very important to separate the local residential streets from the main road.
🎧 So the roadway at the entry to Thomas Street from Days Road will be painted red.
🎧 This should mark it more clearly and act as a signal for traffic to slow down.
🎧 One way of making sure that the pedestrians are safe is to increase signage at the intersections.
🎧 A 'keep clear' sign will be erected at the junction of Evelyn Street and Hill Street,
🎧 to enable traffic to exit at all times.
🎧 Something we're planning to do to help control the flow of traffic in the area
🎧 is to install traffic lights half way down Hill Street where it crosses Days Road.
🎧 Now, we haven't only thought about the cars and traffic, of course,
🎧 there's also something for the children.
🎧 We're going to get school children in the area to research a local story, the life of a local sports hero perhaps,
🎧 and an artist will incorporate that story into paintings on the wall of a building on the other side of Hill Street from the supermarket.
🎧 And finally, we've agreed to build a new children's playground
🎧 which will be at the other end of Hill Street, close to the intersection with Carberry Street.
🎧 Wonderful!
🎧 Now, what's the next stage?
🎧 Well, the final plan…

[095] Cam8 - Test 4 - Part 3

🎧 Hi Jeannie. How's it going?
🎧 Oh. Hello Dan.
🎧 Pretty well, thanks.
🎧 Have you managed to get the money for the course yet?
🎧 Yes, that's all sorted out now, thanks.
🎧 It took long enough, though.
🎧 It was practically a year ago that I applied to my local council for a grant,
🎧 and it took them six months to turn me down.
🎧 That's really slow.
🎧 And I thought I was eligible for government funding,
🎧 but it seems I was mistaken.
🎧 So then I asked the boss of the company I used to work for if they would sponsor me,
🎧 and much to my surprise, he said they'd make a contribution.
🎧 But what about college grants and scholarships?
🎧 There must be some you could apply for.
🎧 Yes, there are,
🎧 but they're all so small that I decided to leave them until I was desperate.
🎧 And in fact, I didn't need to apply.
🎧 My parents had been saying that as I already had a job, I ought to support myself through college.
🎧 But in the end, they took pity on me, so now I've just about got enough.
🎧 That's good.
🎧 So now I can put a bit of effort into meeting people.
🎧 Haven't had time so far.
🎧 Any suggestions?
🎧 What about joining some college clubs?
🎧 Oh right. You joined several, didn't you?
🎧 Yes, I'm in the drama club.
🎧 It's our first performance next week,
🎧 so we're rehearsing frantically, and I've got behind with my work,
🎧 but it's worth it.
🎧 I'm hoping to be in the spring production, too.
🎧 I've never liked acting.
🎧 Are you doing anything else?
🎧 I enjoyed singing when I was at school,
🎧 so I joined a group when I came to college.
🎧 I don't think the conductor stretches us enough, though
🎧 so I'll give up after the next concert.
🎧 And I also joined the debating society.
🎧 It's fun, but with all the rehearsing I'm doing, something has to go,
🎧 and I'm afraid that's the one.
🎧 Do you do any sports?
🎧 Yes, I'm in one of the hockey teams.
🎧 I'm not very good, but I'd really miss it if I stopped.
🎧 I decided to try tennis when I came to college,
🎧 and I'm finding it pretty tough going.
🎧 I'm simply not fit enough.
🎧 Nor me.
🎧 I think I'll give that a miss!
🎧 I'm hoping it'll help me to build up my stamina,
🎧 but it'll probably be a long haul.
🎧 Good luck.
🎧 Thanks.
🎧 How are you finding the course?
🎧 I wish we had more seminars.
🎧 What?
🎧 I'd have thought we had more than enough already.
🎧 All those people saying clever things that I could never think of -
🎧 it's quite interesting, but I wonder if I'm clever enough to be doing this course.
🎧 I find it helpful to listen to the other people.
🎧 I like the way we're exploring the subject,
🎧 and working towards getting insight into it.
🎧 How do you get on with your tutor?
🎧 I don't think I'm on the same wavelength as mine,
🎧 so I feel I'm not getting anything out of the tutorials.
🎧 It would be more productive to read a book instead.
🎧 Oh, mine's very demanding.
🎧 She gives me lots of feedback and advice,
🎧 so I've got much better at writing essays.
🎧 And she's helping me plan my revision for the end-of-year exams.
🎧 Do you tell me, I always struggle with revision.
🎧 Well, the first thing is to find out exactly what's required in the exams.
🎧 Would it help to get hold of some past papers?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 They'll help to make it clear.
🎧 Right, I'll do that.
🎧 Then what?
🎧 Then you can sort out your revision priorities,
🎧 based on what's most likely to come up.
🎧 I put these on a card, and read them through regularly.
🎧 But that isn't enough in itself.
🎧 You also need a timetable, to see how you can fit everything in, in the time available.
🎧 Then keep it in front of you while you're studying.
🎧 I've done that before, but it hasn't helped me!
🎧 Maybe you need to do something different every day,
🎧 so if you break down your revision into small tasks, and allocate them to specific days,
🎧 there's more incentive to tackle them.
🎧 With big topics you're more likely to put off starting.
🎧 Good idea.
🎧 And as I revise each topic
🎧 I write a single paragraph about it -
🎧 then later I can read it through quickly, and it helps fix things in my mind.
🎧 That's brilliant.
🎧 I also write answers to questions for the exam practice.
🎧 It's hard to make myself do it, though!
🎧 Well, I'll try.
🎧 Thanks a lot, Jeannie. That's a great help.
🎧 No problem.
🎧 See you around.
🎧 Bye.

[096] Cam8 - Test 4 - Part 4

🎧 Good morning, everyone.
🎧 I've been invited to talk about my research project into Australian Aboriginal rock paintings.
🎧 The Australian Aborigines have recorded both real and symbolic images of their time on rock walls for many thousands of years.
🎧 Throughout the long history of this tradition,
🎧 new images have appeared and new painting styles have developed.
🎧 And these characteristics can be used to categorise the different artistic styles.
🎧 Among these are what we call the Dynamic, Yam and Modern styles of painting.
🎧 One of the most significant characteristics of the different styles is the way that humans are depicted in the paintings.
🎧 The more recent paintings show people in static poses.
🎧 But the first human images to dominate rock art paintings, over 8,000 years ago, were full of movement.
🎧 These paintings showed people hunting and cooking food
🎧 and so they were given the name 'Dynamic' to reflect this energy.
🎧 It's quite amazing considering they were painted in such a simple stick-like form.
🎧 In the Yam period, there was a movement away from the stick figures to a more naturalistic shape.
🎧 However, they didn't go as far as the Modern style,
🎧 which is known as 'X-ray' because it actually makes a feature of the internal skeleton
🎧 as well as the organs of animals and humans.
🎧 The Yam style of painting got its name from the fact that it featured much curvier figures
🎧 that actually resemble the vegetable called a yam,
🎧 which is similar to a sweet potato.
🎧 The Modern paintings are interesting because they include paintings at the time of the first contact with European settlers.
🎧 Aborigines managed to convey the idea of the settlers' clothing by simply painting the Europeans without any hands,
🎧 indicating the habit of standing with their hands in their pockets!
🎧 Size is another characteristic.
🎧 The more recent images tend to be life size or even larger,
🎧 but the Dynamic figures are painted in miniature.
🎧 Aboriginal rock art also records the environmental changes that occurred over thousands of years.
🎧 For example, we know from the Dynamic paintings that over 8,000 years ago,
🎧 Aborigines would have rarely eaten fish
🎧 and sea levels were much lower at this time.
🎧 In fact, fish didn't start to appear in paintings until the Yam period
🎧 along with shells and other marine images.
🎧 The paintings of the Yam tradition also suggest that, during this time,
🎧 the Aborigines moved away from animals as their main food source
🎧 and began including vegetables in their diet, as these feature prominently.
🎧 Freshwater creatures didn't appear in the paintings until the Modern period from 4,000 years ago.
🎧 So, these paintings have already taught us a lot.
🎧 But one image that has always intrigued us is known as the 'Rainbow Serpent'.
🎧 The Rainbow Serpent, which is the focus of my most recent project,
🎧 gets its name from its snake or serpent-like body
🎧 and it first appeared in the Yam period 4 to 6,000 years ago.
🎧 Many believe it is a curious mixture of kangaroo, snake and crocodile.
🎧 But we decided to study the Rainbow Serpent paintings
🎧 to see if we could locate the animal that the very first painters based their image on.
🎧 The Yam period coincided with the end of the last ice age.
🎧 This brought about tremendous change in the environment,
🎧 with the sea levels rising and creeping steadily inland.
🎧 This flooded many familiar land features
🎧 and also caused a great deal of disruption to traditional patterns of life,
🎧 hunting in particular.
🎧 New shores were formed and totally different creatures would have washed up onto the shores.
🎧 We studied 107 paintings of the Rainbow Serpent
🎧 and found that the one creature that matches it most closely was the Ribboned Pipefish,
🎧 which is a type of sea horse.
🎧 This sea creature would have been a totally unfamiliar sight in the inland regions where the image is found
🎧 and may have been the inspiration behind the early paintings.
🎧 So, at the end of the ice age, there would have been enormous changes in animal and plant life.
🎧 It's not surprising then, that the Aborigines linked this abundance to the new creatures they witnessed.
🎧 Even today, Aborigines see the Rainbow Serpent as a symbol of creation,
🎧 which is understandable given the increase in vegetation and the new life forms that featured when the image first appeared.
