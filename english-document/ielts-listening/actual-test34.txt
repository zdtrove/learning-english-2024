🎧 Good morning. City House Services. How may I help you?
🎧 Good morning. I'd like to arrange to have my house cleaned.
🎧 Certainly. I just need to ask a few questions.
🎧 First, could I take your name?
🎧 Yes, it's Barbara Hill.
🎧 Thank you. Next, is your house in London?
🎧 Yes, it's in Kingston in Southwest London.
🎧 OK, Southwest London and... er, what's the postcode?
🎧 SW105.
🎧 And what is the square footage and what rooms will we be cleaning?
🎧 The whole house is 268 square feet,
🎧 and there is no need to clean all the rooms.
🎧 I only want to have my bedrooms cleaned.
🎧 OK, how many bedrooms does the house have?
🎧 3 bedrooms.
🎧 Oh no, sorry, we used to have 3 bedrooms, but we only have 2 bedrooms now.
🎧 Are those single bedrooms or doubles?
🎧 Doubles.
🎧 Fine, 2 doubles...
🎧 There's one more room which needs cleaning.
🎧 It was used as a bedroom before, and now we have converted it into an office.
🎧 I understand.
🎧 3 rooms have got to be cleaned, and are all of those rooms upstairs?
🎧 Yes. Then, downstairs we have a kitchen-diner, conservatory, and lounge.
🎧 The kitchen-diner is quite large and has the usual equipment:
🎧 cooker with oven, refrigerator, cupboards, and worktops.
🎧 The conservatory has a lot of plants, but there's no need to take care of them.
🎧 The lounge has a leather three-piece suite and a large coffee table.
🎧 Thank you. And do you keep any pets?
🎧 Yeah, I really love keeping them.
🎧 I've got 2 dogs and 3 cats.
🎧 OK, then if our staff come over to offer the service, please take your pets away.
🎧 Have you looked at our service packages?
🎧 Yes, I have one in front of me.
🎧 Excellent.
🎧 Any extra services you need,
🎧 switching bed linen, working in the garden, cleaning the glass in the conservatory, that kind of thing?
🎧 Err... no... err...
🎧 actually, replacing the bed linen...
🎧 yeah.. that would be good.
🎧 No problem. I'll just make a note of that.
🎧 How about curtains, mats, and carpets?
🎧 What would you like us to do with those items?
🎧 The curtains... I'll have to think about that.
🎧 I think we should have the carpets cleaned really well every quarter.
🎧 Mats can just be done with the laundry.
🎧 Of course.
🎧 How about clothes?
🎧 We can have our staff wash and iron them,
🎧 or we can have them taken to a dry cleaner.
🎧 Washing and ironing. No, just ironing. That'll be OK.
🎧 OK, fine. I know quite a bit about what you want now.
🎧 I should let you know that we are located on 12 Amyes Road,
🎧 that's A-M-Y-E-S.
🎧 And we work on from Monday to Sunday except Tuesday and Wednesday.
🎧 Could you let me know when is convenient for you?
🎧 Next Friday...
🎧 err... no, oh, that's no good.
🎧 My son invites his friends over in the afternoon that day.
🎧 Perhaps next Thursday or next Saturday.
🎧 Let me check, OK, next Thursday.
🎧 When is it convenient for us to come over and provide the service?
🎧 Is it OK if we come in the morning?
🎧 Or we may come in the afternoon? It depends on your schedule.
🎧 I'm OK with any time.
🎧 Just give me a call to let me know you're coming before you arrive.
🎧 Sure, we will.
🎧 By the way, how long will it take for the service?
🎧 We usually work 1 to 3 hours for house cleaning,
🎧 and the work will take 3 hours at most.
🎧 And of course, if it takes more than 3 hours, you should pay extra for it.
🎧 Er... fine.
🎧 So, let me just do some calculations...
🎧 
🎧 Hi everyone, and welcome to Sydney Airport.
🎧 Today, I'll be giving you the inside information on the day-to-day operations of the Australian Quarantine Service here.
🎧 We hope to provide you with a better understanding of why such heavy security regulations are necessary
🎧 by educating you on how we operate and why we do the things we do.
🎧 We're not here to try to persuade you to fly through Sydney Airport,
🎧 though we hope you'll find your experience relatively stress-free and comfortable.
🎧 First things first, our personnel.
🎧 Can anyone guess how many people work at Sydney Airport?
🎧 We have 200 alone working in Terminal 2,
🎧 so can you guess how many in the whole airport?
🎧 I heard someone say 360, that's getting closer...
🎧 What?
🎧 Did someone say 2,000?
🎧 That's way too high.
🎧 Sydney Airport actually employs 440 people.
🎧 A lot, right?
🎧 And about half of those employees work in security-related matters.
🎧 Moving on to our not-so-human employees,
🎧 let's come and see our favourite pooch, Milton.
🎧 Milton is our best drug-sniffing dog on the force.
🎧 He's friendly to most people - you can even come pet him at the end of our tour.
🎧 Burnouts beware, though, he'll find everything.
🎧 Notice that even though there are so many of us around him, Milton stays quite calm.
🎧 This is the precise reason he was chosen for the job.
🎧 Dogs that are chosen are not predisposed to sniff out different narcotics,
🎧 that's something we teach them already.
🎧 So here's a part of the airport most people never notice - the cargo transport terminal.
🎧 This is where packages are shipped to and from.
🎧 Normally we ship around 4,400 packages per month.
🎧 In this airport alone, over 52,000 packages were shipped in and out over the past year.
🎧 We ship to and from 170 different countries.
🎧 Not bad, eh?
🎧 Probably it will go up to over 72,000 packages this year.
🎧 And despite over 100 flights in and out of here daily,
🎧 the number of lost or delayed packages is impressively low.
🎧 If you send your package through here, rest assured we'll get it where it's going.
🎧 Let's move on to the area most of us are familiar with, the passenger terminals.
🎧 In order to be allowed into this area, you must pass through security with your ticket
🎧 and if you're travelling internationally, your passport.
🎧 If you're travelling domestically, you just need a legal form of ID.
🎧 If you don't have those, you will not be allowed to pass through security and board your flight.
🎧 During the security scan,
🎧 your carry-on items will be checked for dangerous items such as weapons,
🎧 sharp objects, and liquids that exceed our specified limit.
🎧 If you attempt to pass any of the prohibited items on this list posted at the entrance,
🎧 you are still allowed to board the plane,
🎧 but you'll be given a warning and your item will be confiscated.
🎧 Don't worry, we will not arrest you for having too much shampoo in your bag, or anything like that.
🎧 We also search your carry-ons and parcels for any perishable items.
🎧 We prohibit the transportation of local vegetation
🎧 and prohibit parcels containing any insects in them.
🎧 You may or may not have learned about this in Biology class,
🎧 but when some plants are introduced to a new environment,
🎧 they spread wildly and wipe out the current species around it.
🎧 It is important to control the introduction of new plants into an ecosystem,
🎧 so we must prohibit the transport of any fertile seeds.
🎧 So what happens to parcels containing possibly suspicious items?
🎧 It's of course something we do not take lightly here.
🎧 If an object passes through the scanner that appears suspicious in any way,
🎧 it is separated out for manual search by a member of our trained security personnel.
🎧 If an illegal plant or simple sharp object like a pocket knife is found,
🎧 it is simply disposed of in our biohazard waste containers,
🎧 and the package itself is returned to the sender
🎧 (or passenger, if it is for a passenger flight).
🎧 More serious weapons are reported to higher authorities for investigation.
🎧 As far as parcel security, the material of the parcel is important.
🎧 For shipped goods, the most common material used (and the most widely accepted) is paper.
🎧 Make sure it is packed sturdy enough, with no rips or tears.
🎧 We've definitely had packages rip open before due to haphazard packing.
🎧 A more common problem, though, is the package labels.
🎧 When an item does not make it to the right place, this is the most common reason.
🎧 The label may not be in the right place or marked clearly enough.
🎧 If you're receiving any items from abroad that must be declared,
🎧 please remember our guidelines in order to ensure the timely delivery of your item.
🎧 Make sure it is packed correctly,
🎧 and we ask that you notify customs between 2 and 10 days within the item's scheduled arrival date.
🎧 Okay, before we move on, are there any questions?
🎧 
🎧 Welcome! Please come in and gather over here around the tables.
🎧 My name is Adam Smith, and I'm the librarian here.
🎧 I'll show you around today and explain how to use these facilities.
🎧 Hopefully when I'm done with it, you'll know the ropes,
🎧 and please feel free to let me know of any questions or concerns that you may have.
🎧 Now, we're at the gate of the library.
🎧 Upon entering into the door, you'll find that the restrooms are on your left-hand side,
🎧 and opposite them is a Photocopy Room.
🎧 Many of you are wondering about the check-in and check-out process.
🎧 What you have to do is go to the Circulation Desk,
🎧 which is to the east of the Photocopy Room.
🎧 The Reading Room is a really large area in the centre of the library,
🎧 just to the north of the Circulation Desk.
🎧 I'm sure you won't miss it.
🎧 If you're here to do research, this is where you should bring books to look through.
🎧 However, if you're here to do any group projects or other interactive activities,
🎧 I advise you to use one of the study rooms,
🎧 which are just to the east of the Reading Room.
🎧 Moving on to the southeast corner,
🎧 we have the Periodicals Section, just next to the study rooms.
🎧 We have a collection of different newspapers and magazines in this section.
🎧 You can get last week's weather reports, or all the top stories 5 years ago,
🎧 our periodicals can be traced back 20 years to the time when our school library was built.
🎧 Ah, our first question! Yes?
🎧 Can we check out magazines from the library?
🎧 I'm sorry, but you cannot take any periodicals out of the library.
🎧 You're welcome to read them for as long as you want while you're here,
🎧 but you cannot check them out.
🎧 I wonder if there is any place where we can get some food in the library.
🎧 Do we have a store here?
🎧 Of course.
🎧 The Food Service Centre is just metres away from the study rooms.
🎧 It's on the northeast corner as you look at the map.
🎧 The Food Service Centre offers different kinds of snacks though it's not big.
🎧 Well, moving on along to the west,
🎧 you will find the Video Resource Centre on your right hand.
🎧 We have educational videos and documentaries, as well as major motion pictures.
🎧 We ask that you pay attention to the tag on the video that you pick up,
🎧 as many of our documentaries are for on-site viewing only and may not be taken out of the library.
🎧 To the west of the Video Resource Centre is our Satellite TV Station.
🎧 Here we stream the news from Channel 19 for most of the day.
🎧 How many channels does it have?
🎧 It does have nearly 200 channels,
🎧 but we generally will give top priority to channels with some big events,
🎧 like presidential addresses or other breaking news.
🎧 During the coverage of the presidential debate,
🎧 students will take a break from studying and flock to watch it.
🎧 Last but perhaps most important is the Enquiry Desk.
🎧 It's just on the left-hand side when you walk into the library,
🎧 so it's impossible to miss it.
🎧 If you have any questions about how to use equipment or where to find something, come and ask the assistant.
🎧 Don't be shy, because that's what they're here for!
🎧 Speaking of questions,
🎧 one of the questions we get asked is how to actually check out a book once a student has picked one out.
🎧 If it's a fiction or non-fiction book,
🎧 look for the pink and yellow check-out card inside the back cover of the book.
🎧 You can also find information about the book on these cards,
🎧 including its publishing date, genre, ISBN, and a log of dates it's been checked out before.
🎧 Present this card to me or any library assistant,
🎧 and we'll stamp it and then the book can be kept for 3 weeks.
🎧 You can find general information on a field of study by using one of our subject guides.
🎧 We have them on paper here, but any of our computers will allow you to search within fields as well.
🎧 What if the library doesn't have a resource we're looking for?
🎧 Great question, I'm going to address that.
🎧 Our library is a network with a number of other universities in the area,
🎧 so if there is something you're looking for and it's available somewhere in the area,
🎧 we'll be able to get it for you.
🎧 However, there are universities which are not part of the network,
🎧 so we do not share resources with them.
🎧 If you want more information about the library and its resources,
🎧 you'll find it in a labelled blue folder on my desk in the enquiry section.
🎧 Okay, so that's a lot of information all at once,
🎧 and I don't expect you to remember it all.
🎧 The most important thing is, please be respectful of the staff
🎧 and if you need help with anything at all, come and ask me or one of the assistants.
🎧 Alright, any questions?
🎧 
🎧 Good morning.
🎧 Today, we will continue our study of Crocodylus niloticus by talking about its living habits.
🎧 We've already discussed the evolutionary attributes that set it apart from its crocodile relatives.
🎧 Does everyone remember that?
🎧 Yes, it has an extremely narrow snout, and 3 or 4 rows of protective scales on its back,
🎧 as compared to 2 rows on other members of the Crocodylus genus.
🎧 Let's take a look at how these carnivorous man-eaters live,
🎧 where they live, and finally, whether they really deserve their vicious reputation.
🎧 To start, I'd like to address a great question posed to me by a student during yesterday's office hours.
🎧 We talked about the distribution of crocodiles in Africa
🎧 and saw that they are highly concentrated in the South and West of the continent.
🎧 This student noticed that on the map displaying the distribution of crocodiles across Africa,
🎧 there were no crocodiles in the Northern Region,
🎧 and found no mention in the literature of the existence of crocodiles in the North of Africa.
🎧 Why might there be no crocodiles in North Africa?
🎧 Let's save this question for later in the lecture.
🎧 To find out more about the social habits of the African crocodile,
🎧 one researcher named Tara Shine of the University of Ulster in Northern Ireland
🎧 conducted a survey of the wetlands in Mauritania
🎧 and received reports of 46 crocodiles living in one group,
🎧 or float as we say when referring to crocodiles,
🎧 though the usual number is a little less than half of that.
🎧 In general, crocodiles are more highly concentrated in wet, subtropical environments
🎧 near bodies of water and rich vegetation.
🎧 While South American crocodiles thrive in cool rainforests,
🎧 the African crocodile is more equipped for heat.
🎧 Though they can survive at the hot temperatures found in some deserts,
🎧 they're not equipped to handle dry climates
🎧 and thus cannot survive in places like the Sahara Desert of North Africa.
🎧 As cold-blooded animals,
🎧 crocodiles' core temperatures fluctuate from their average of 38 degrees Celsius as external conditions change,
🎧 thus they need to avoid extreme temperatures.
🎧 Others live an underwater life, keeping a body temperature close to that of the water.
🎧 As their own unique method of regulating their body temperatures,
🎧 some African crocodiles have made dens
🎧 by digging holes in the ground to provide themselves with a cool, dark place to retreat from the hot African sun.
🎧 Speaking of the hot African sun,
🎧 let's go back to the question asked at the beginning of the lecture.
🎧 We know that there used to be crocodiles in Northern Africa, yet today there are none.
🎧 What are some possible explanations for this?
🎧 Some students have suggested that the African crocodile has evolved
🎧 from a desert creature into a wetland creature,
🎧 thus causing them to migrate south for more appropriate conditions.
🎧 Others presume the crocodile was hunted out of Northern Africa by a fiercer predator.
🎧 While these are intelligent guesses, the real story is a little bit different.
🎧 The key to this migration is that the Sahara Desert did not always cover the North of Africa.
🎧 About 8,000 years ago, the land was fertile wetlands perfect for breeding crocodiles.
🎧 Over time, though, the area dried out and the wetland slowly turned to desert,
🎧 leading the African crocodile to migrate south to the marshlands they call home today.
🎧 Some crocodiles did, however, adapt to living in dry conditions.
🎧 In Mauritania, some crocodiles have learned to survive in an area where they can go up to 8 months with no water
🎧 by spending the driest of times in what's called a torpor, or short period of hibernation.
🎧 To utilise every bit of rainfall,
🎧 these desert crocodiles dig underground caves that collect runoff,
🎧 thus staying cool and hydrated.
🎧 During the mating period in November and December,
🎧 males attract females to their viciously protected territory through a number of behaviours
🎧 that range from snapping their jaws all the way to sending infrasonic pulses through the water.
🎧 Afterwards, the female digs a hole up to 60 centimetres in depth
🎧 to store the eggs for an 80-day incubation period.
🎧 The female protects these eggs during the period,
🎧 and sometimes even helps crack the eggs with her snout at the end.
🎧 These teeth-gnashing carnivores are softer than we think.
🎧 Although these vicious creatures have attacked humans on a few occasions,
🎧 the residents are not afraid of them.
🎧 In fact, they show a great deal of reverence towards these wondrous creatures.
🎧 Some say that crocodiles bring water to their habitat,
🎧 so if they leave, they will bring the water with them.
🎧 Obviously this is not true,
🎧 but it demonstrates the admiration the inhabiting people have for crocodiles.
🎧 Generally, crocodiles do not predate on humans.
🎧 They attack when humans populate the crocodiles' habitat,
🎧 instilling fear and uneasiness in the crocs.
🎧 Like any other species, crocodiles are known to attack when feeling fear.
🎧 There's still a lot more to be discovered about the African crocodile.
🎧 Researchers want to know more about the population size,
🎧 how many crocodiles inhabit Africa in all,
🎧 how they form separate floats, etc.
🎧 There is still also much to learn about migration patterns,
🎧 and relations to other populations of crocodiles now found in other parts of the world.
🎧 Next time, we'll examine a few specific case studies of crocodile populations in Southern Africa.
