🎧 Good evening. King's Restaurant.
🎧 Good evening.
🎧 I'm ringing about the job I understand you have vacant.
🎧 Oh yes.
🎧 I'd like to find out a few more details, if i may.
🎧 Yes, of course. Can i take your name?
🎧 It's Peter Chin.
🎧 Okay Peter.
🎧 Well, if you want to ask about the job and then if we're both still interested,
🎧 we could arrange for you to come for an interview.
🎧 Great, thanks.
🎧 I'm afraid i missed the advert for the job but heard about it from a friend.
🎧 That's no problem at all.
🎧 What would you like to know?
🎧 Well, um, what sort of work is it? Washing up?
🎧 It's answering the phone.
🎧 Oh, right, fine.
🎧 And not waiting at table.
🎧 That'd be good.
🎧 And how many nights a week would it be?
🎧 Well, we're really only busy at the weekend.
🎧 So two nights?
🎧 Three actually, so it would work out at twelve hours a week.
🎧 That'd be fine.
🎧 It wouldn't interfere with my studies.
🎧 Are you at the university?
🎧 Yes. First year Physics student.
🎧 Oh right.
🎧 Um, and because I'm not an EU national, would I need a work permit?
🎧 Yes you would.
🎧 Just get your tutor to sign it.
🎧 That wouldn't be a problem, if i were to get the job.
🎧 Um, where exactly is the restaurant?
🎧 Well, we have two branches -
🎧 the one we're recruiting for is in Hillsdunne Road.
🎧 I don't know that.
🎧 How do you spell it please?
🎧 It's HILLSDUNNE Road.
🎧 Got that. Thanks.
🎧 is it near a bus stop?
🎧 Yes. The nearest one would probably be just beside the library.
🎧 Oh yes, I know it. That'd be fine for me.
🎧 And could I ask about the pay?
🎧 We're offering £4.45 an hour.
🎧 That's very good.
🎧 My last job was £3.95 an hour.
🎧 We feel it's pretty good and we also offer some good fringe benefits.
🎧 Really?
🎧 Well, we give you a free dinner, so you eat well.
🎧 Right, better than hostel food!
🎧 We certainly hope so!
🎧 And we also offer extra pay for working on national holidays.
🎧 Oh, that's a really good perk, isn't it?
🎧 Yes, we think so.
🎧 And then because of the difficulties of getting public transport,
🎧 if you're working after 11 o'clock we drive you home.
🎧 Oh, that's good to know.
🎧 Well, we'd certainly be interested in inviting you for an interview, if you're still interested?
🎧 Oh yes, certainly.
🎧 Could I just also ask what qualities you're looking for?
🎧 Well, for this particular job we want a clear voice, which you obviously do have!
🎧 Thanks.
🎧 And you must be able to think quickly, you know.
🎧 Well, I hope I'd...
🎧 So, when could you come in for an interview?
🎧 We're actually quite quiet tonight?
🎧 Sorry, I couldn't come tonight...
🎧 or tomorrow, I'm afraid.
🎧 Thursday's okay, that'd be 22nd of October.
🎧 Fine, after 5 p.m?
🎧 Yes, fine. Would 6 o'clock be okay?
🎧 Perfect.
🎧 And could you bring along the names of two referees?
🎧 Yes, that's fine, no problem.
🎧 Good, I look forward to seeing you.
🎧 Oh, by the way, who should i ask for?
🎧 Oh yes, of course, sorry.
🎧 My name is Samira Manuja.
🎧 Can you spell that, please?
🎧 MANUJA.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 I've got that. Thanks very much.
🎧 Look forward to seeing you later on then.
🎧 
🎧 Now we go to Jane who is going to tell us about what's happening in town this weekend.
🎧 Right, thanks Andrew,
🎧 and now on to what's new,
🎧 and do we really need yet another sports shop in Bradcaster?
🎧 Well, most of you probably know Sports World -
🎧 the branch of a Danish sports goods company that opened a few years ago -
🎧 it's attracted a lot of custom,
🎧 and so the company has now decided to open another branch in the area.
🎧 It's going to be in the shopping centre to the west of Bradcaster.
🎧 So that will be good news for all of you who found the original shop in the north of the town hard to get to.
🎧 I was invited to a special preview
🎧 and I can promise you, this is the ultimate in sports retailing.
🎧 The whole place has been given a new minimalist look
🎧 with the company's signature colours of black and red.
🎧 The first three floors have a huge range of sports clothing as well as equipment,
🎧 and on the top floor, there's a cafe and a book and DVD section.
🎧 You'll find all the well-known names as well as some less well-known ones.
🎧 If they haven't got exactly what you want in stock,
🎧 they promise to get it for you in ten days.
🎧 Unlike the other store, where it can take up to fourteen days.
🎧 They cover all the major sports, including football, tennis and swimming,
🎧 but they particularly focus on running.
🎧 and they claim to have the widest range of equipment in the country.
🎧 As well as that, a whole section of the third floor is devoted to sports bags,
🎧 including the latest designs from the States.
🎧 If you can't find what you want here, it doesn't exist!
🎧 The shop will be open from 9.00 am this Saturday
🎧 and if you go along to the opening
🎧 then you'll have the chance to meet the national 400 metres running champion - Paul King,
🎧 who's coming along to open the shop,
🎧 and he will be staying around until about midday
🎧 to chat to any fans who want to meet him and sign autographs.
🎧 Then there will be a whole range of special attractions all weekend.
🎧 There will be free tickets for local sporting events for the first 50 customers,
🎧 and also a special competition open to all.
🎧 Just answer fifteen out of twenty sports questions correctly
🎧 to win a signed copy of Paul King's DVD - 'Spring Tips',
🎧 while the first person to get all the questions correct gets a year's free membership of the Bradcaster Gym.
🎧 All entrants will receive a special Sports calendar
🎧 with details of all Bradcaster fixtures in the coming year.
🎧 One of the special opening offers is a fitness test -
🎧 a complete review of your cardiac fitness and muscle tone,
🎧 actually done in the shop by qualified staff.
🎧 This would normally cost £30
🎧 but is available at half price for this month only.
🎧 There are only a limited number of places available for this,
🎧 so to make a booking, phone 560341.
🎧 In addition, if you open an account you get lots more special offers
🎧 including the chance to try out equipment...
🎧 
🎧 Before we start, Spiros and Hiroko,
🎧 thanks for coming in today to talk about your recent study experiences
🎧 and congratulations to you both in doing so well in your first semester exams!
🎧 I'd like to discuss with you the value of the English for Academic Purposes course you did here last year
🎧 before starting your university course.
🎧 Spiros, if I could start with you,
🎧 what parts of the programme have now proved to be particularly valuable to you?
🎧 Um... I think that having to do a seminar presentation really helped me.
🎧 For example, a couple of weeks ago in our marketing subject,
🎧 when it was my turn to give a presentation I felt quite confident.
🎧 Of course, I was still nervous but...
🎧 because I had done one before, I knew what to expect.
🎧 Also, I know I was well-prepared and I had practised my timing.
🎧 In fact, I think that in relation to some of the other people in my group,
🎧 I did quite a good job because my overall style was quite professional.
🎧 What about you, Hiroko?
🎧 Mmm, that's interesting.
🎧 In my group, I was really surprised by the way the students did their presentations -
🎧 they just read their notes aloud!
🎧 Can you believe that?
🎧 They didn't worry about their presentation style or keeping eye contact with their audience
🎧 and I remember that these things were really stressed to us in the course here.
🎧 So, how did you approach your presentation, Hiroko?
🎧 Well, to speak frankly, I read my notes too!
🎧 At the time, it was a relief to do it this way, but...
🎧 actually, when I had finished, I didn't feel any real sense of satisfaction.
🎧 I didn't feel positive about the experience at all.
🎧 That's a pity.
🎧 You know, although I was pleased with my presentation,
🎧 I am not so pleased with my actual performance right now in the tutorials -
🎧 during the whole semester, I've not said anything in our tutorial discussions.
🎧 Not a word.
🎧 Really, Spiros?
🎧 Why's that?
🎧 Do the other students talk too much?
🎧 It's partly that,
🎧 but it's mostly because I have had no confidence to speak out.
🎧 Their style of speaking is so different.
🎧 It's not the style we were used to during the course.
🎧 They use so many colloquialisms,
🎧 they're not very polite and sometimes there seems to be no order in their discussion.
🎧 Also, they are very familiar with each other,
🎧 so because they know each other's habits,
🎧 they can let each other into the discussion.
🎧 You're right, Spiros, I've experienced that too.
🎧 For most of this semester, I've said absolutely nothing in tutorials.
🎧 But recently, I've been trying to speak up more and I just jump in,
🎧 and I've noticed an interesting thing.
🎧 I've noticed that if they thought my point was interesting or new,
🎧 then the next time they actually asked for my opinion,
🎧 and then it was much easier for me to be part of the discussion.
🎧 That's great, Hiroko!
🎧 I hope that happens for me next semester.
🎧 I'll have to work hard to find some interesting points.
🎧 What helped you to find these ideas?
🎧 I think that one thing that helped me with this was the reading.
🎧 I've had to do so much reading this semester just to help me make sense of the lectures.
🎧 At first, I couldn't understand what the lecturers were talking about,
🎧 so I had to turn to the books and journals.
🎧 Every night I read for hours,
🎧 using the lists of references that were given, and I made pages of notes.
🎧 At breakfast, I read and read my notes again.
🎧 This habit has helped me to follow the ideas in the lectures,
🎧 and it's also given me some ideas to use in the tutorials.
🎧 But i did so much reading anyway.
🎧 I don't think there's any time left over for anything extra.
🎧 My reading speed is still quite slow,
🎧 though I'm much better at dealing with vocabulary than I used to be.
🎧 What else do you think we could add to the course program to help with this reading problem?
🎧 There's not really anything because it's my problem.
🎧 I remember we were given long articles to read.
🎧 We didn't like that but now I realise that reading those long articles was good preparation for the things I need to read now.
🎧 Also, in class, we regularly had speed-reading tasks to do,
🎧 and we kept a record of our reading speed,
🎧 so the teachers were encouraging us to work on that.
🎧 That's true, Spiros,
🎧 but what we read could have been different.
🎧 Sometimes in the English class, I felt frustrated when I had to read articles about the environment or health or education,
🎧 because I wanted to concentrate on my own field,
🎧 but we didn't read anything about engineering.
🎧 So, I think I wasted some time learning vocabulary I didn't need.
🎧 Hmm... but surely the strategies you were taught for dealing with that vocabulary were helpful.
🎧 Yes, but psychologically speaking,
🎧 I would have felt much better working on reading from my own field.
🎧 What do you think Spiros?
🎧 Oh, I agree, that would have helped my confidence too
🎧 and I would have been more motivated.
🎧 It was good though that we could work on our own topics when we wrote the research assignments.
🎧 Okay, let's move on to writing now...
🎧 
🎧 Good afternoon everyone.
🎧 Well, with some of you about to go out on field work
🎧 it's timely that in this afternoon's session I'll be sharing some ideas about the reasons why groups of whales and dolphins
🎧 sometimes swim ashore from the sea right onto the beach and...
🎧 most often, die in what are known as 'mass strandings'.
🎧 Unfortunately, this type of event is a frequent occurrence in some of the locations that you'll be travelling to,
🎧 where sometimes the tide goes out suddenly, confusing the animals.
🎧 However, there are many other theories about the causes of mass strandings.
🎧 The first is that the behaviour is linked to parasites.
🎧 It's often found that stranded animals were infested with large numbers of parasites.
🎧 For instance, a type of worm is commonly found in the ears of dead whales.
🎧 Since marine animals rely heavily on their hearing to navigate,
🎧 this type of infestation has the potential to be very harmful.
🎧 Another theory is related to toxins, or poisons.
🎧 These have also been found to contribute to the death of many marine animals.
🎧 Many toxins, as I'm sure you're aware, originate from plants, or animals.
🎧 The whale ingests these toxins in its normal feeding behaviour
🎧 but whether these poisons directly or indirectly lead to stranding and death
🎧 seems to depend upon the toxin involved.
🎧 In 1988, for example,
🎧 14 humpback whales examined after stranding along the beaches of Cape Cod
🎧 were found to have been poisoned after eating tuna that contained saxitoxin,
🎧 the same toxin that can be fatal in humans.
🎧 Alternatively, it has also been suggested that some animals strand accidentally by following their prey ashore in the confusion of the chase.
🎧 In 1995, David Thurston monitored pilot whales that beached after following squid ashore.
🎧 However, this idea does not seem to hold true for the majority of mass strandings
🎧 because examination of the animals' stomach contents reveal that most had not been feeding as they stranded.
🎧 There are also some new theories which link strandings to humans.
🎧 A growing concern is that loud noises in the ocean cause strandings.
🎧 Noises such as those caused by military exercises are of particular concern
🎧 and have been pinpointed as the cause of some strandings of late.
🎧 One of these, a mass stranding of whales in 2000 in the Bahamas
🎧 coincided closely with experiments using a new submarine detection system.
🎧 There were several factors that made this stranding stand out as different from previous strandings.
🎧 This led researchers to look for a new cause.
🎧 For one, all the stranded animals were healthy.
🎧 In addition, the animals were spread out along 38 kilometres of coast,
🎧 whereas it's more common for the animals to be found in a group when mass strandings occur.
🎧 A final theory is related to group behaviour,
🎧 and suggests that sea mammals cannot distinguish between sick and healthy leaders
🎧 and will follow sick leaders, even to an inevitable death.
🎧 This is a particularly interesting theory
🎧 since the whales that are thought to be most social - the toothed whales -
🎧 are the group that strand the most frequently.
🎧 The theory is also supported by evidence from a dolphin stranding in 1994.
🎧 Examination of the dead animals revealed that apart from the leader,
🎧 all the others had been healthy at the time of their death.
🎧 Without one consistent theory however,
🎧 it is very hard for us to do anything about this phenomenon
🎧 except to assist animals where and when we can.
🎧 Stranding networks have been established around the world
🎧 to aid in rescuing animals and collecting samples from those that could not be helped.
🎧 I recommend John Connor's Marine Mammals Ashore as an excellent starting point
🎧 if you're interested in finding out more about these networks, or establishing one yourself.
