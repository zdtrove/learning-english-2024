🎧 Hello?
🎧 Oh, hello. Is that Julie Davison?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 This is Greg Preston from the Employment Agency.
🎧 We met last week when you came in to enquire about office work.
🎧 Oh, that's right.
🎧 Now we've just had some details come in of a job which might interest you.
🎧 OK.
🎧 So this is a position for a receptionist,
🎧 I believe you've done that sort of work before?
🎧 Yes, I have,
🎧 I worked in a sports centre for a couple of years before I got married and had the children.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Well, this job's in Fordham, so not too far away for you,
🎧 and it's at the medical centre there.
🎧 OK.
🎧 So where exactly is that?
🎧 It's quite near the station, on Chastons Road.
🎧 Sorry?
🎧 Chastons Road,
🎧 that's C-H-A-S-T-O-N-S.
🎧 OK, thanks.
🎧 So what would the work involve?
🎧 Dealing with enquiries from patients?
🎧 Yes,
🎧 and you'd also be involved in making appointments,
🎧 whether face to face or on the phone.
🎧 And rescheduling them if necessary.
🎧 Fine, that shouldn't be a problem.
🎧 And another of your duties would be keeping the centre's database up-to-date.
🎧 Then you might have other general administrative duties as well,
🎧 but those would be the main ones.
🎧 OK.
🎧 Now when the details came in, I immediately thought of you
🎧 because one thing they do require is someone with experience,
🎧 and you did mention your work at the sports centre when you came in to see us.
🎧 Yes, in fact I enjoyed that job.
🎧 Is there anything else they're looking for?
🎧 Well, they say it's quite a high-pressure environment,
🎧 they're always very busy,
🎧 and patients are often under stress,
🎧 so they want someone who can cope with that and stay calm,
🎧 and at the same time be confident when interacting with the public.
🎧 Well, after dealing with three children all under five,
🎧 I reckon I can cope with that.
🎧 I'm sure you can.
🎧 And then another thing they mention is that they're looking for someone with good IT skills...
🎧 Not a problem.
🎧 So you'd be interested in following this up?
🎧 Sure.
🎧 When would it start?
🎧 Well, they're looking for someone from the beginning of next month,
🎧 but I should tell you that this isn't a permanent job,
🎧 it's temporary, so the contract would be just to the end of September.
🎧 But they do say that there could be further opportunities after that.
🎧 OK.
🎧 And what would the hours be?
🎧 Well, they want someone who can start at 7:45 in the morning.
🎧 Could you manage that?
🎧 Yes, my husband would have to get the kids up and off to my mother's,
🎧 she's going to be looking after them while I'm at work.
🎧 What time would I finish?
🎧 1:15
🎧 That should work out all right.
🎧 I can pick the kids up on my way home,
🎧 and then I'll have the afternoon with them.
🎧 Oh, one thing...
🎧 is there parking available for staff at the centre?
🎧 Yes, there is.
🎧 and it's also on a bus route.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Well, I expect I'll have the car but it's good to know that.
🎧 OK, so where do I go from here?
🎧 Well, if you're happy for me to do so,
🎧 I'll forward your CV and references,
🎧 and then the best thing would probably be for you to phone them
🎧 so they can arrange for an interview.
🎧 Great. Well thank you very much.
🎧 You're welcome. Bye now.
🎧 Bye.
🎧 
🎧 Good morning everyone, and welcome to the Museum of Farming Life.
🎧 I understand it's your first visit here,
🎧 so I'd like to give you some background information about the museum
🎧 and then explain a little about what you can see during your visit.
🎧 So, where we're standing at the moment is the entrance to a large building
🎧 that was constructed in 1880
🎧 as the home of a local businessman, Alfred Palmer, of the Palmer biscuit factory.
🎧 It was later sold and became a hall of residence for students in 1911,
🎧 and a museum in 1951.
🎧 In 2005, a modern extension was built to accommodate the museum's collections.
🎧 The museum's owned by the university,
🎧 and apart from two rooms that are our offices,
🎧 the university uses the main part of the building.
🎧 You may see students going into the building for lessons,
🎧 but it's not open to museum visitors, I'm afraid.
🎧 It's a shame because the interior architectural features are outstanding,
🎧 especially the room that used to be the library.
🎧 Luckily, we've managed to keep entry to the museum free.
🎧 This includes access to all the galleries, outdoor areas and the rooms for special exhibitions.
🎧 We run activities for children and students,
🎧 such as the museum club, for which there's no charge.
🎧 We do have a donation box just over there
🎧 so feel free to give whatever amount you consider appropriate.
🎧 We do have a cloakroom,
🎧 if you'd like to leave your coats and bags somewhere.
🎧 Unlike other museums, photography is allowed here,
🎧 so you might like to keep your cameras with you.
🎧 You might be more comfortable not carrying around heavy rucksacks,
🎧 though keep your coats and jackets on as it's quite cold in the museum garden today.
🎧 I'd like to tell you about the different areas of the museum.
🎧 Just inside, and outside the main gallery,
🎧 we have an area called Four Seasons.
🎧 Here you can watch a four-minute animation of a woodland scene.
🎧 It was designed especially for the museum
🎧 by a group of young people on a film studies course, and it's beautiful.
🎧 Children absolutely love it, but then, so do adults.
🎧 The main gallery's called Town and Country.
🎧 It includes a photographic collection of prize-winning sheep and shepherds.
🎧 Leaving Town and Country, you enter Farmhouse Kitchen,
🎧 which is... well, self-explanatory.
🎧 Here we have the oldest collection of equipment for making butter and cheese in the country.
🎧 And this morning, a specialist cheesemaker will be giving demonstrations of how it's produced.
🎧 You may even get to try some.
🎧 After that, you can go in two directions.
🎧 To the right is a staircase
🎧 that takes you up to a landing from where you can look down on the galleries.
🎧 To the left is a room called A Year on the Farm.
🎧 There's lots of seating here as sometimes we use the room for school visits,
🎧 so it's a good place to stop for a rest.
🎧 If you're feeling competitive,
🎧 you can take our memory test in which you answer questions about things you've seen in the museum.
🎧 The next area's called Wagon Walk.
🎧 This contains farm carts from nearly every part of the country.
🎧 It's surprising how much regional variation there was.
🎧 Beside the carts are display boards with information about each one.
🎧 The carts are old and fragile,
🎧 so we ask you to keep your children close to you
🎧 and ensure they don't climb on the carts.
🎧 From Wagon Walk, you can either make your way back to reception
🎧 or go out into the garden
🎧 or even go back to take another look in the galleries.
🎧 In the far corner of the garden is Bees are Magic,
🎧 but we're redeveloping this area so you can't visit that at the moment.
🎧 You can still buy our honey in the shop, though.
🎧 Finally, there's The Pond,
🎧 which contains all kinds of interesting wildlife.
🎧 There are baby ducks that are only a few days old, as well as tiny frogs.
🎧 The Pond isn't deep and there's a fence around it,
🎧 so it's perfectly safe for children.
🎧 
🎧 So now I want you to discuss the lesson we've just been watching on the video
🎧 and think about the ways in which origami can be a useful educational tool.
🎧 Can you all work with the person sitting next to you...
🎧 I had no idea that such a simple thing like folding squares of paper to make the shape of something like a bird could be such an amazing tool.
🎧 It's made me see origami in a whole new light.
🎧 I know.
🎧 It was interesting to see the educational skills the children were developing by doing origami.
🎧 On the video you could see them really listening hard
🎧 to make sure they did all the steps in the right order to make the bird.
🎧 That's right.
🎧 In this lesson they were working individually
🎧 but it would also be interesting to see if the children could work out how to make something simple
🎧 without being given any direction.
🎧 That would help with building teamwork as well.
🎧 Yes, but much more of a challenge.
🎧 One thing that really stood out for me was that the children were all having fun while being taught something new.
🎧 Which is a key aim of any lesson with this age group.
🎧 And although these kids had no problems with folding the paper,
🎧 with younger children you could do origami to help practise fine motor skills.
🎧 Absolutely.
🎧 Shall we talk about the individual children we saw on the video?
🎧 I wrote all their names down and took some notes.
🎧 Yes, I did too.
🎧 OK, good.
🎧 Let's start with Sid.
🎧 He was interesting because before they started doing the origami, he was being quite disruptive.
🎧 Yes.
🎧 He really benefited from having to use his hands,
🎧 it helped him to settle down and start concentrating.
🎧 Yes, I noticed that too.
🎧 What about Jack?
🎧 I noticed he seemed to want to work things out for himself.
🎧 You could see him trying out different things rather than asking the teacher for help.
🎧 What did you make of Naomi?
🎧 She seemed to be losing interest at one point
🎧 but then she decided she wanted her mouse to be the best
🎧 and that motivated her to try harder.
🎧 She didn't seem satisfied with hers in the end, though.
🎧 No.
🎧 Anya was such a star.
🎧 She listened so carefully
🎧 and then produced the perfect bird with very little effort.
🎧 I think the teacher could have increased the level of difficulty for her.
🎧 Hmm... maybe.
🎧 I think it was the first time Zara had come across origami.
🎧 She looked as if she didn't really get what was going on.
🎧 She seemed unsure about what she was supposed to do.
🎧 but in the end hers didn't turn out too badly.
🎧 Yeah. I'm sure it was a positive learning experience for her.
🎧 I think one reason why the origami activity worked so well in this class
🎧 was that the teacher was well prepared.
🎧 Right.
🎧 I think it would have taken me ages to prepare examples,
🎧 showing each of the steps involved in making the bird.
🎧 But that was a really good idea.
🎧 The children could see what they were aiming for,
🎧 and much better for them to be able to hold something,
🎧 rather than just looking at pictures.
🎧 Those physical examples supported her verbal explanations really well.
🎧 It's strange that origami isn't used more widely.
🎧 Why do you think that is?
🎧 Well, teachers may just feel it's not that appealing to children who are used to doing everything on computers,
🎧 especially boys.
🎧 Even if they're aware of the benefits.
🎧 Oh, I don't know. It's no different to any other craft activity.
🎧 I bet it's because so many teachers are clumsy like me.
🎧 That's true,
🎧 too much effort required if you're not good with your hands.
🎧 Well, anyway, I think we should try it out in our maths teaching practice with Year 3.
🎧 I can see using origami is a really engaging way of reinforcing children's knowledge of geometric shapes,
🎧 like they were doing in the video,
🎧 but I think it would also work really well for presenting fractions, which is coming up soon.
🎧 Good idea, that's something most of the kids in that class might struggle with.
🎧 Origami would also be good practice for using symmetry,
🎧 but I think they did that last term.
🎧 OK, well let's try and get some ideas together and plan the lesson next week.
🎧 OK, if you could...
🎧 
🎧 The person I've chosen to talk about is the French writer Victor Hugo -
🎧 many people have heard of him because his novel, Les Miserables,
🎧 which he wrote in 1862, is famous around the world.
🎧 It became a stage musical in the 1980s,
🎧 and a film version was also released in 2012.
🎧 So, some of us, I'm sure, have a pretty general idea of the plot,
🎧 but we know much less about the author.
🎧 Today, I'm going to provide a little more insight into this talented man
🎧 and I'm going to talk particularly about the home he had on the island of Guernsey in the British Channel Islands.
🎧 But first, his early career...
🎧 as I've said, he was a writer,
🎧 he was at the height of his career in Paris
🎧 and he was very highly regarded by his colleagues.
🎧 As far as literature was concerned,
🎧 he was the leading figure of the Romantic movement.
🎧 However, as well as being a literary genius,
🎧 he also gave many speeches about issues like the level of poverty in his society.
🎧 He felt very strongly about this
🎧 and about other areas where change was needed, like education.
🎧 This kind of outspoken criticism was not well liked by the rulers of France
🎧 and, eventually, the emperor - Napoleon III -
🎧 told Victor Hugo to leave Paris and not return;
🎧 in other words, he sent him into exile.
🎧 So Victor Hugo was forced to reside in other parts of Europe.
🎧 Guernsey was actually his third place of exile
🎧 and he landed there in 1855.
🎧 He produced a lot while on Guernsey - including Les Miserables -
🎧 and to do this, he had to spend a great deal of time in the home that he had there.
🎧 This was a property that he bought using the money he'd made in France
🎧 from the publication of a collection of his poetry.
🎧 It was the only property he ever owned, and he was very proud of it.
🎧 The property Victor Hugo bought on Guernsey was a large, five-storey house in the capital town of St Peter Port
🎧 and he lived there for 15 years,
🎧 returning to France in 1870 when Napoleon's Empire collapsed.
🎧 He decorated and furnished each level, or floor, of the house in unique and wonderful ways,
🎧 and many people consider the inside of the house to be a 'work of art'.
🎧 Today it's a museum that attracts 200,000 visitors a year.
🎧 He lived in the house with his family...
🎧 and portraits of its members still hang in rooms on the ground floor,
🎧 along with drawings that he did during his travels that he felt were important to him.
🎧 In other ground-floor rooms, there are huge tapestries
🎧 that he would've designed and loved.
🎧 The walls are covered in dark wood panelling that Victor Hugo created himself
🎧 using wooden furniture that he bought in the market.
🎧 The items were relatively inexpensive,
🎧 and he used them to create intricate carvings.
🎧 They gave an atmosphere on the lower level that was shadowy and rather solemn.
🎧 On the next level of the house there are two impressive lounges,
🎧 where he entertained his guests.
🎧 One lounge has entirely red furnishings,
🎧 such as sofas and wall coverings, and the other blue.
🎧 There's a strong Chinese influence in these areas
🎧 in things like the wallpaper pattern and the lamps -
🎧 which he would have made himself by copying original versions.
🎧 His library, where he left many of his favourite books,
🎧 forms the hallway to the third floor
🎧 and was a comfortable area where he could relax and enjoy his afternoons.
🎧 And then, at the very top of the house,
🎧 there's a room called the Lookout -
🎧 called that because it looks out over the harbour.
🎧 In contrast to the rather dark lower levels,
🎧 it's full of light and was like a glass office where he would write until lunchtime -
🎧 often at his desk.
🎧 So, Victor Hugo was a man of many talents,
🎧 but he was also true to his values.
🎧 While living in his house on Guernsey,
🎧 he entertained many other famous writers,
🎧 but he also invited a large group of local children from the deprived areas of the island to dinner once a week.
🎧 What's more, he served them their food,
🎧 which was an extraordinary gesture for the time period.
🎧 In 1927, the house was owned by his relatives,
🎧 and they decided to donate it to the city of Paris.
🎧 It has since been restored using photographs from the period
🎧 and, as I mentioned earlier, is now a museum that is open to the public.
