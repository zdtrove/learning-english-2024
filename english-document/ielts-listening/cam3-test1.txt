[001] Cam3 - Test 1 - Part 1

🎧 Hello... Flagstone.
🎧 Oh hello.
🎧 Is that Flagstone Properties?
🎧 Yes that's right.
🎧 Flagstone here. How can I help you?
🎧 Hello.
🎧 I'm ringing just to make enquiries about renting a house.
🎧 My name's Jon Anderson.
🎧 Yes, Mr Anderson.
🎧 What sort of thing were you looking for?
🎧 Umm... Two-bedroomed house with garden.
🎧 Well... yes, sir, that shouldn't be any problem...
🎧 just to let you know that our main areas,
🎧 the main areas we deal with are the city centre itself...
🎧 City centre...
🎧 And the north suburbs.
🎧 Oh well...
🎧 we were most interested in the Northern areas actually.
🎧 Right... yes... What sort of price were you thinking of?
🎧 Well... uh... could you give me some idea?
🎧 Certainly.
🎧 It really ranges from £250 per month.
🎧 Only £250?
🎧 Yes, to about £500 depending on a number of different factors.
🎧 Oh, what does it depend on?
🎧 Well, obviously the quality of the area.
🎧 And then whether there's a garden.
🎧 Well, as I said, we'd want a garden.
🎧 And a garage pushes up the price.
🎧 Right...
🎧 well, we wouldn't necessarily need one.
🎧 I think about £350 a month would be our limit.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 Well... would you like to have a look at a couple of properties, sir?
🎧 Yes, that'd be great.
🎧 Um... Looking at our files... I think we've got two which might suit you...
🎧 Hang on. I'll just get a pen.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Okay. Well, there's one on West Park Road
🎧 which is £325 a month.
🎧 Are the bills included?
🎧 Well, that one just includes the water bill.
🎧 Okay, right.
🎧 And the second house is in Tithe Road.
🎧 I'll just spell that for you, okay?
🎧 Yep.
🎧 TITHE Road.
🎧 Got that.
🎧 And how much is that one?
🎧 That's £380.
🎧 380.
🎧 Uh... Is that including water?
🎧 No, I'm afraid not, but it does include the telephone rental.
🎧 Oh well, that's not too bad then.
🎧 So, when would you be available to see them?
🎧 Well, uh... I'll be in town next week... say... Thursday?
🎧 No, I'm sorry we don't have any availability for Thursday.
🎧 How about Wednesday afternoon?
🎧 Okay. That's fine.
🎧 Would 5 be okay?
🎧 Yes, fine.
🎧 5 o'clock it is.
🎧 Just come to the Flagstone Offices.
🎧 Oh, before I forget.
🎧 What sort of things do I need to get done... to rent with you?
🎧 Well, the most important thing is a letter from your bank...
🎧 No problem...
🎧 And then a reference letter from your employer.
🎧 Yes, that's okay.
🎧 Great, and then we would need you to give 2 weeks' notice of moving in...
🎧 Right... 2 weeks' notice.
🎧 And what about a deposit?
🎧 That's one month's rent, whatever the amount is.
🎧 Okay. One month.
🎧 Is that it?
🎧 No, sorry, one more...
🎧 you will have to pay for the contract.
🎧 Oh yes. I'd forgotten about that.
🎧 Okay, fine.
🎧 So I'll start arranging those.
🎧 I'll see you next week.
🎧 Yes. Thanks very much.
🎧 Bye.
🎧 Goodbye.

[002] Cam3 - Test 1 - Part 2

🎧 Hello, Mrs Sutton. Come in.
🎧 How are you settling in next door?
🎧 Have all your things from Canada arrived yet?
🎧 I thought I saw a removals van outside your house yesterday afternoon.
🎧 Yes. They came yesterday.
🎧 We spent all day yesterday arranging them.
🎧 It's beginning to feel a bit more like home now.
🎧 Oh that's good.
🎧 Look, come in and sit down.
🎧 Are you alright?
🎧 You look a bit worried.
🎧 Well, I am a bit.
🎧 I'm sorry to bother you so early, Mrs Smith, but
🎧 I wonder if you could help me.
🎧 Could you tell me how I can get hold of a doctor?
🎧 Our daughter, Anna, isn't very well this morning and...
🎧 I may have to call somebody out.
🎧 She keeps being sick and I am beginning to get a bit worried.
🎧 I just don't know how the health system works here in England.
🎧 All I know is that it's very different from ours back in Canada.
🎧 Well, I don't know really where to start.
🎧 Let me think.
🎧 Well, the first thing you have to do is find a family doctor -
🎧 sometimes we call them general practitioners as well -
🎧 and register with him or her.
🎧 If you live here, you've got to be on a doctor's list.
🎧 If you're not, things can be a bit difficult.
🎧 Nobody will come out to you if you're not registered.
🎧 Anyway, they work in things called practices.
🎧 Sort of small groups of family doctors all working together in the same building.
🎧 Now what you've got to do this morning is register with one of them.
🎧 There are two practices near here,
🎧 so we're quite well off for doctors in this part of Manchester.
🎧 There's the Dean End Health Centre about ten minutes' walk away
🎧 and there's another practice in South Hay.
🎧 That's about five minutes away going towards the town centre.
🎧 We're registered at the Dean End one,
🎧 but they're both okay.
🎧 There are about six doctors in our practice and four in the other.
🎧 So ours is quite big in comparison.
🎧 And the building and everything's a bit more modern.
🎧 South Hay is a bit old-fashioned but the doctors are okay.
🎧 Their only problem is that they don't have a proper appointment system.
🎧 Sometimes you have to wait for ages there to see someone.
🎧 Anyway, you go to the receptionist in whichever health centre
🎧 and ask her to register you with a doctor there.
🎧 You have to fill in a form, but it doesn't take long.
🎧 Ours is called Dr Jones
🎧 and we've been going to him for years -
🎧 ever since we moved here fifteen years ago.
🎧 I wouldn't say he's brilliant but I suppose he's alright really.
🎧 We're used to him now.
🎧 They say he's very good with elderly people,
🎧 but he does tend to get a bit impatient with children.
🎧 Listen, the one who's supposed to be really good with small children is Dr Shaw.
🎧 I've heard lots of people say that.
🎧 She's young and she's got small children of her own.
🎧 So you could try registering with her.
🎧 And if her list's full,
🎧 I heard somebody say the other day that there's a really nice young doctor at South Hay,
🎧 a Dr Williams.
🎧 He holds special clinics for people with back trouble.
🎧 But that's not really your problem, is it?
🎧 If you want a doctor to visit you at home,
🎧 you have to ask for a home visit.
🎧 You're supposed to do that before 10.30 in the morning,
🎧 but obviously, if it's an emergency, you can phone at any time, night or day.
🎧 It might not be your doctor that comes, though.
🎧 It's quite often one of the other doctors in the practice.
🎧 It doesn't really seem to make much difference.
🎧 Otherwise you make an appointment to see your doctor at the health centre.
🎧 You usually get seen the same day.
🎧 Not always of course, but usually, as I say.
🎧 They hold surgeries between 9 and 11.30 every weekday,
🎧 and from 4 to 6.30 Monday to Thursday.
🎧 Saturdays are only for emergencies.
🎧 When the doctor sees you, he gives you a prescription.
🎧 He writes what medication you need on it and you take it to a chemist's shop.
🎧 There's one opposite the centre.
🎧 If it's for a child under 16, you don't have to pay.
🎧 So if it's for Anna, there's no problem.
🎧 The same thing goes if you're unemployed or retired, or if you're pregnant.
🎧 Just as well because it's not cheap.
🎧 You pay the same price for each item the doctor has prescribed.
🎧 At the moment it's something like £5 per item.
🎧 So you pay for the medication but the consultation with the doctor doesn't cost you anything.
🎧 It's completely free as long as you're a resident here.
🎧 You're going to be here for three years, aren't you?
🎧 So there shouldn't be any question of you paying anything to see the doctor.
🎧 So that's one less problem to worry about.
🎧 Look, Mrs Sutton. If you want,
🎧 I'll sit with your daughter for half an hour if you want to go down to the health centre to register.
🎧 It's no trouble really, don't worry.
🎧 Are you sure you wouldn't mind?
🎧 That would really help me a lot.
🎧 I'll ask them if they can send someone round later to see Anna.
🎧 I think I'll try the Dean End Centre.
🎧 Good idea.
🎧 Don't worry about Anna.
🎧 Right. I'll be back as soon as I can.

[003] Cam3 - Test 1 - Part 3

🎧 Hello. Jonathan Briggs, isn't it?
🎧 Yes, that's right.
🎧 Do come in and sit down.
🎧 Thanks.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Well, Jonathan, as we explained in your letter,
🎧 in this part of the interview, we like to talk through your application form...
🎧 your experience to date, etc....
🎧 and then in the second part,
🎧 you go for a group interview.
🎧 Group interview... yes, I understand...
🎧 So... your first degree was in Economics?
🎧 Yes, but I also did Politics as a major strand.
🎧 And you graduated in 1989.
🎧 And I see you have been doing some teaching...
🎧 Yes. I worked as a volunteer teacher in West Africa.
🎧 I was there for almost three years in total from....
🎧 1990 to... 1992.
🎧 How interesting.
🎧 What organisation was that with?
🎧 It's not one of the major ones. It's called Teach South.
🎧 Oh, right.
🎧 Yes, I have heard of it.
🎧 It operates in several African countries, doesn't it?
🎧 And what kind of school was it?
🎧 A rural co-operative.
🎧 Oh, a rural co-operative, how interesting...
🎧 and what did you teach?
🎧 A variety of things in different years...
🎧 I did... with Forms 1 to 3 mainly Geography
🎧 and some English with Form 5.
🎧 Then in my final year,
🎧 I took on some Agricultural Science with the top year...
🎧 that's Form 6.
🎧 Right. Quite a variety then...
🎧 I also ran the school farm.
🎧 How interesting...
🎧 And how did you find the whole experience?
🎧 I'll be honest with you.
🎧 At the end of the first year I really wanted to leave and come home.
🎧 Oh, why was that?
🎧 Well... I was very homesick at first and missed my family...
🎧 Yes, I can understand that.
🎧 and I also found it frustrating to have so few teaching resources,
🎧 but I did decide to stay
🎧 and in the end I extended my tour to a third year.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Things must have looked up then?
🎧 Yes. We set up a very successful project breeding cattle to sell locally.
🎧 Really?
🎧 And then after a lot of hard work we finally got funds for new farm buildings.
🎧 And you wanted to see things through?
🎧 And that's why you want to train to teach Geography?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 I've had a couple of jobs since then
🎧 but I now realise I like teaching best.
🎧 And I chose Geography because...
🎧 because it is my favourite subject...
🎧 and also because I think it has so many useful applications.
🎧 Well... you certainly have had some interesting work experience.
🎧 I'll ask you now to go on to the next stage...

[004] Cam3 - Test 1 - Part 4

🎧 Today's Health Counsel is presented by Paula Clayburg,
🎧 who is the chief Counsellor at Liverpool's famous pain clinic:
🎧 The Wilton Clinic.
🎧 Paula...
🎧 Do you know what Prince Charles, Seve Ballesteros and Elizabeth Taylor have in common?
🎧 They all suffer from chronic back pain.
🎧 In fact, bad backs are one of the most common health problems today,
🎧 affecting people in all walks of life.
🎧 The most recent available figures show that about a quarter of a million people
🎧 are incapacitated with back pain every day.
🎧 And many sufferers don't know the cause or the solution to their problem.
🎧 The majority of our patients at the clinic tend to be women.
🎧 They are especially vulnerable because of pregnancy
🎧 but also because of osteoporosis,
🎧 which I personally believe to be the major cause of problems for women.
🎧 I have many women patients who say they have completely given up exercise
🎧 because the pain makes them so miserable.
🎧 But of course that starts up a vicious circle.
🎧 Bed rest, giving up exercise and pain killers are traditional responses to back pain
🎧 but, although there are many excellent drugs on the market,
🎧 at our clinic we are beginning to realise the unique benefits of relaxation therapy.
🎧 Other specialists in the field make a strong case for certain types of exercise,
🎧 but in our experience they are easily mishandled
🎧 and can lead to more harm than good.
🎧 Now, let's look at some of the reasons why back pain is developing into such a unique menace.
🎧 In general, the body is pretty good at self-repair.
🎧 A strain or a blow to a limb, though painful at the time, generally resolves itself.
🎧 But the body's response to back injury can be very counter-productive.
🎧 When pain strikes,
🎧 we attempt to keep the back as immobile as possible,
🎧 which makes the muscles tense up.
🎧 Research shows that they often go into spasm,
🎧 which causes further twisting of the spine.
🎧 A vicious circle is underway.
🎧 The second mistake we often make when stricken with extreme back pain
🎧 is to go to bed and stay there.
🎧 Although at the clinic, we recognise that a short rest in bed can be helpful...
🎧 up to two days...
🎧 any longer makes our back muscles become weaker and unable to hold up our spine.
🎧 The pain therefore becomes worse.
🎧 Another problem is being overweight.
🎧 Anyone a stone or more over-weight
🎧 who already has back pain is not doing himself any favours:
🎧 though it won't actually set it off in the first place,
🎧 the weight will increase the strain and make things worse.
🎧 The British diet could be partially to blame for the increase in back pain:
🎧 over the last ten years the average weight of men has risen by 11 lbs
🎧 and of women by 9 lbs.
🎧 So much for the causes and aggravations of pain.
🎧 But what can we do to help?
🎧 There are many ways in which simple day-to-day care can make all the difference.
🎧 The first point to watch of course is weight.
🎧 If you are overweight, a diet will make all the difference.
🎧 Also, studies have shown that just one hour sitting in a slouched position
🎧 can strain ligaments in the back which can take months to heal.
🎧 At the clinic, we have come to the conclusion
🎧 that the major cause of the problem is not with the design of chairs, as some have suggested,
🎧 but in the way we sit in them.
🎧 It can be useful to get special orthopaedic chairs,
🎧 but remember the most important improvement should be in our posture.
🎧 Another enemy of your back is, of course, your beds.
🎧 If your bed doesn't give enough support,
🎧 back muscles and ligaments work all night trying to correct spinal alignment,
🎧 so you wake up with a tired aching back.
🎧 Try out an orthopaedic mattress or a spring slatted bed.
🎧 Research shows that both can be beneficial for certain types of back pain.
🎧 Another hazard for your back are the shock waves which travel up your spine when you walk,
🎧 known as heel strike.
🎧 A real find for our patients has been the shock-absorbing shoe insert.
🎧 A cheap but very effective solution.
🎧 And you might be better off avoiding shoes with heels higher than one and a half inches.
🎧 Though absolutely flat shoes can be a solution for some,
🎧 others find their posture suffers.
🎧 Finally, a word about the state-of-the-art relief - the TENS machine -
🎧 a small battery-powered gadget
🎧 which delivers subliminal electrical pulses to the skin.
🎧 Our experience indicates that your money is better spent on the more old-fashioned remedies.
