🎧 Hello?
🎧 Hello? Who is this?
🎧 Hello. I'm a representative of the Tallyho Survey Company,
🎧 and I'd like to ask you a few questions regarding exercise.
🎧 Ah, that's an interesting subject.
🎧 Yes, we think so, too.
🎧 But I'm afraid I'm a bit busy at the moment.
🎧 Don't worry. This will only take about four minutes at the most.
🎧 It's 10:25 now, so it will all be over by 10:30.
🎧 Well... alright, if it's that short.
🎧 It will be.
🎧 So, one of the first things I need to know is where you are,
🎧 that is, which suburb or area of the city?
🎧 The last client was in Blackburn, for example.
🎧 Blackburn. That's close to me. I'm in Box Hill.
🎧 Another eastern suburb then.
🎧 I have a friend in Box Hill, too. Interesting place.
🎧 Now, I need your approximate age for this survey.
🎧 Are you younger than 20, between 20 and 29, 30 and 39, and so on?
🎧 I'll turn 40 in a few months,
🎧 so that puts me in the 40 to 49 age group.
🎧 Well, that's in a few months, so right now you're in the 30 to 39.
🎧 Oh, right. So put that then.
🎧 Okay. Now, I need to know your occupation.
🎧 The last caller was a housewife, for example; the one before that a teacher.
🎧 I used to be a teacher, too, teaching cookery.
🎧 And now?
🎧 Now you can just put 'domestic duties'.
🎧 Actually, I hope to begin a new job soon, as a cook,
🎧 but that won't be for some time yet.
🎧 I have to wait for my husband's restaurant to open.
🎧 Cook? That sounds interesting,
🎧 but it's 'domestic duties' for now.
🎧 Okay, that just leaves some information about your family.
🎧 This is not obligatory at all, so if you don't want to answer, that's fine.
🎧 What sort of information, exactly?
🎧 Oh, it's very broad.
🎧 Married, with children; single mother, that sort of thing.
🎧 The last customer said she was a single mother.
🎧 I'm married, and not a mother. Put 'married, no children'.
🎧 I'm married with children, myself.
🎧 But I'll put in your details, and that finishes the profile,
🎧 and just leaves the actual survey itself, if you're ready to proceed.
🎧 Alright, let's begin the survey now, about your exercise habits.
🎧 I'm afraid I don't exercise much at all.
🎧 Well, the main question is in what form you take your exercise, however little that may be,
🎧 for example, in just cleaning. Do you clean the house?
🎧 My husband does the cleaning, actually,
🎧 but I walk to the supermarket and shops very often, up to four times a week.
🎧 I'll put that then, unless there's something else.
🎧 Nothing else, really. But I diet. I'm very strict about what I eat.
🎧 Oh, and I do yoga, although that's not very energetic,
🎧 more a form of relaxation, and to tighten my muscles.
🎧 They're both important, of course,
🎧 but what about sport?
🎧 Do you undertake any sporting activities?
🎧 This could be very infrequent. In the past, for example.
🎧 My husband plays basketball at the local school, and I sometimes watch.
🎧 When he was younger he was in a basketball team, but I never participated.
🎧 Have you done anything at all?
🎧 I used to hike in a nearby national park.
🎧 Well that's a definite physical activity, so I'll put that - but not basketball.
🎧 Alright, that just leaves future exercise intentions.
🎧 Do you plan, or expect to do, at some stage, any form of exercise?
🎧 I once dreamt of doing modern dance, but that's never going to happen.
🎧 Realistically, I'm thinking about going swimming, at the local aquatic centre,
🎧 although my husband thinks we should just jog.
🎧 I can't see myself doing that, though, too tiring.
🎧 I can understand.
🎧 I used to jog, too, and it really makes you sweat.
🎧 I'd say swimming's a much better option.
🎧 But I'll be starting this job as a cook in my husband's restaurant.
🎧 I imagine I'll be very tired doing all those late shifts.
🎧 But if I have any energy left over, I might go to the aquatic centre to release some stress.
🎧 Alright. Well, that's the end of the survey.
🎧 Thank you very much for your time.
🎧 
🎧 Welcome to the library, or the I.L.C., which means Independent Learning Centre,
🎧 and let me explain about some of its facilities.
🎧 We're standing here at the entry gates, next to the borrowing desk.
🎧 That's where you check out any books,
🎧 but you are also advised to study in the library here,
🎧 since most of our material cannot be borrowed.
🎧 Thus, we have Seating along the middle of the library,
🎧 and in that far corner in front of us. on the left,
🎧 we have the Quiet Reading Section, for some serious reading activity.
🎧 We used to have the computers there
🎧 but then realised that that corner was very quiet,
🎧 and thus better suited for the purpose it now has.
🎧 The computers were instead shifted to a more central location,
🎧 right beside us here, on the left.
🎧 Again, somewhat confusingly,
🎧 this area once housed the Newspaper and Magazine Section,
🎧 but the people in the Quiet Reading Area had to walk too far to collect this literature,
🎧 so it was moved to right beside them, in the adjacent corner.
🎧 So, feel free to read the newspapers there.
🎧 But the reference books, those huge weighty dictionaries, atlases, and encyclopedias,
🎧 were all situated at the opposite end of the building, against the wall.
🎧 This was because they weren't generally that popular,
🎧 and we wanted more space for the magazine racks,
🎧 always a favourite with readers.
🎧 Okay, as well as reading, you need to work on your listening skills,
🎧 and for that you need the Audio Section.
🎧 Again, such an activity needs a quiet area,
🎧 so we put this in the last remaining corner, up there on your right, as you can see.
🎧 There are CD players and headphones, so just borrow the listening packs,
🎧 sit down there, and listen away.
🎧 Right, that just leaves the main library.
🎧 In other libraries, that's often right beside the Newspaper and Magazine Section,
🎧 allowing freedom to choose from all genres of literature,
🎧 but here, we've got them further apart.
🎧 For the main library, just follow your nose,
🎧 past the Central Seating there, and it's there among all that shelving,
🎧 upon which you'll find an abundance of interesting books and listening packs to use.
🎧 Now, I'd like to tell you a bit more about an excellent service offered in the I.L.C. here
🎧 that we call the 'Special Sessions'.
🎧 What can you do in them?
🎧 For a start, many of you need practice in speaking English.
🎧 and for that we hold a special Discussion Session, led by a teacher.
🎧 That can be noisy, in fact, we hope that it is noisy,
🎧 since that would mean many people are talking.
🎧 It's in the Central Seating area,
🎧 and it used to be from 10:30 to 1:30.
🎧 but we found that the noise was disturbing the regular I.L.C patrons,
🎧 so we shortened and moved this discussion to the morning,
🎧 9 am time slot, when fewer people are in the centre.
🎧 It goes for one and a half hours.
🎧 Alright, what about Writing Skills?
🎧 Well, we can help you there with another teacher.
🎧 Now, writing is a fairly quiet activity,
🎧 so that teacher stations him or herself in the Quiet Reading area
🎧 from 1:30 until 3.
🎧 The 10:30-to-midday time slot cannot have a teacher for such writing skills,
🎧 as they are all teaching in the morning.
🎧 For this reason, of course, there cannot be an on-call teacher in the morning either,
🎧 although many people would like one, particularly the 10.30-to-noon crowd,
🎧 having just finished their early morning class.
🎧 These students all have to wait until midday onwards,
🎧 when, for three hours, a teacher will be stationed in the Audio Section,
🎧 ready to deal with all those questions.
🎧 Until recently, we had another teacher doing the 3-pm-to-6-pm time slot,
🎧 in the Central Seating,
🎧 but all the noise interfered with the late users of the I.L.C., so we had to cancel that.
🎧 Also noisy can be the Language Exchange,
🎧 where local students who want to learn your language will help you practise English.
🎧 This is generally done in pairs,
🎧 so the noise level is low enough not to need this exchange to run at 9 am,
🎧 but at the more congenial time of 10:30, among the Central Seating.
🎧 That must finish by 1:30 though,
🎧 after which quieter and more individual activities take place.
🎧 
🎧 Hi, Emily. What did you think of that lecture?
🎧 A bit hard to follow, but I have some good lecture-listening note-taking strategies which really help,
🎧 so I can review the lecturer's message later.
🎧 Lecture-listening note-taking strategies? Review it later?
🎧 That sounds interesting.
🎧 I must admit, I struggle a bit to take down the gist of what I hear.
🎧 Look at my notes.
🎧 Well, I can see a basic problem immediately.
🎧 You're writing full words, such as 'century' when all you need is a 'C',
🎧 And don't write 'increase'; just draw an 'up' arrow.
🎧 And why write 'thousand' when a 'th' will do?
🎧 I see. Just use symbols. That's not a bad idea at all.
🎧 It's the most basic strategy, allowing you to record information at a faster pace.
🎧 These lecturers can talk faster than others, too,
🎧 so you don't want to waste any time.
🎧 But you need to be very familiar with your set of symbols.
🎧 Why?
🎧 Because you'll have to look at these notes days, weeks, or even months afterwards,
🎧 when you begin writing your essay,
🎧 so you'll need to be able to interpret them at a later stage.
🎧 I think I can do this, even by looking at your notes.
🎧 'Immed' must mean immediately.
🎧 But regarding the lecture as a whole,
🎧 I knew the professor would be giving a set of specific recommendations,
🎧 and comparing two alternative approaches, so I formatted my page in advance,
🎧 adding the features consistent with the nature of what I was going to hear.
🎧 I think I need an example of what you mean.
🎧 Well, look at my page.
🎧 Before the lecture, I drew large headings saying 'recommendations'.
🎧 You should always draw these, and I drew a table saying, 'Approach 1' and 'Approach 2'.
🎧 At the end I drew a flowchart,
🎧 as obviously the final recommendation would be a step-by-step approach.
🎧 Then I was prepared in advance to simply fill in the spaces.
🎧 Wow! Now that's clever.
🎧 Your advice about note taking sounds great, but I still have one question, Emily.
🎧 How are you able to design your page in advance?
🎧 I mean, how can you predict the nature of the talk,
🎧 and know which design is likely to work best?
🎧 It's rather obvious when you think about it.
🎧 What's your next lecture about?
🎧 Legal Studies.
🎧 Well, that suggests to me that you'll need a flowchart,
🎧 since the judicial system has a very logical 'do this first, do that second' approach,
🎧 which must be followed in that order,
🎧 y'know, all the processes that happen in the courtroom,
🎧 and the procedures that must take place to ensure complete legality.
🎧 Sure. That's the way law is, very linear and orderly,
🎧 but what about Culture Studies?
🎧 That's just a mass of comparisons of different cultures.
🎧 Which tells you that you will need a table, where, in tabular form, you can efficiently write down information.
🎧 But often the lecture's not that simple.
🎧 The professor throws in a really complex mix of ideas.
🎧 Then use a spider graph, like the web a spider makes,
🎧 where there's a central idea around which you attach all the associated thoughts, and ideas, and impressions.
🎧 I see. I think I understand.
🎧 And that would be very quick, too; very efficient.
🎧 I like that. But what about Management Theory?
🎧 How would you approach that?
🎧 The same as with Culture Studies.
🎧 I'd use a network, which is basically the same as a spider graph, linking thoughts,
🎧 although this time there are directions involved.
🎧 It is this element that makes it different,
🎧 the fact that the thoughts go one way and not the other.
🎧 Okay... has directions.
🎧 It sounds logical.
🎧 What about the other subjects, such as Political Science?
🎧 There's no predictable order to that.
🎧 Well, for that I'd just put my notes in a line,
🎧 that is, in linear, or straight-line fashion,
🎧 and these notes would use symbols, of course, to save time.
🎧 Okay, that just leaves Mass Media.
🎧 For that, I wouldn't have any special design at all.
🎧 As you say, sometimes it's impossible to predict in what way lecturers will present their information,
🎧 in which case the best you can do is pre-write headings,
🎧 but not specific, just general,
🎧 as in Main One, Main Two, Sub One, Two, and Three, and so on.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 But always be prepared to adapt to the nature of the talk,
🎧 using any one of the other methods if it becomes appropriate at the time.
🎧 
🎧 When considering the smallest unit of matter - the atom
🎧 most people know of electrons, protons, and neutrons,
🎧 but almost none know of another particle,
🎧 even though they are constantly emitted from the sun in the trillions,
🎧 with 100 to 200 billion of them regularly passing through your body every second.
🎧 To repeat, that's not thousands, not millions, but billions, every second.
🎧 You don't feel them because they are small,
🎧 in fact, so tiny that we can barely detect their presence at all.
🎧 These mysterious particles are called neutrinos.
🎧 Despite such an abundance, detecting them is a huge undertaking,
🎧 and there are many reasons for this.
🎧 Firstly, the neutrino itself is so small that you need to eliminate absolutely all other particles around.
🎧 To do this, you need what is called a clean room,
🎧 one that has an extremely low level of dust, microbes, floating particles, or chemical vapours.
🎧 You probably don't know it, but the air around you right now has almost 40 million particles per cubic meter.
🎧 In contrast, the cleanest of clean rooms has less than 10.
🎧 The second problem is that you also need an environment with absolutely no background radiation.
🎧 At the surface of the Earth, such radiation is all around,
🎧 from the sun and sky, and from TVs and communication devices.
🎧 The only way to screen out all that is to go underground, and I mean deep underground.
🎧 For example, the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory in Canada uses an old nickel mine, one of the deepest in the world,
🎧 and puts the Observatory in its lowest tunnel, more than two kilometers below the surface.
🎧 At such depths, stray radiation is sufficiently screened out to allow neutrinos only to pass by.
🎧 The final problem is that you need an elaborate detection system,
🎧 and this apparatus is huge,
🎧 and its installation in this deep underground cavity presents quite a headache.
🎧 Holding such a weighty construction safe and secure requires complex engineering work,
🎧 such as rock-bolting and support structuring.
🎧 This obviously requires great care, and takes a lot of effort.
🎧 So, I've told you about the difficulty in detecting neutrinos.
🎧 They are tiny, virtually weightless, have no electric charge,
🎧 and hardly interact with anything at all.
🎧 Yet we can detect them, and to see how, let's consider the Sudbury installation once again.
🎧 The detector there consists of a spherical container filled with heavy water.
🎧 This rests inside another vessel filled with normal water,
🎧 which helps support the weight of the inner sphere,
🎧 as well as providing further shielding from any stray radiation.
🎧 At the edge of this inner sphere are about 10,000 electronic detectors.
🎧 These are extremely sensitive, able to multiply a hundred million times any electric current which occurs.
🎧 So, as the neutrinos pass through this sphere of water,
🎧 there is a very very very small chance that one of them may hit a water molecule.
🎧 To increase the likelihood of this, two strategies are used.
🎧 One. the larger the sphere of water, the better,
🎧 and the Sudbury tank holds not 10 tons, not 100 tons, but 1000 tons.
🎧 Two, the water is special, consisting as it does of heavier molecules.
🎧 So, what happens is this.
🎧 If the neutrino hits the water molecule, the neutrino is absorbed,
🎧 but the molecule itself splits apart, producing a tiny electric current.
🎧 It is this which is detected, and analysed, giving key information about the neutrino.
🎧 The final question is why do we care about these elusive particles?
🎧 Well, just think,
🎧 they can pass right through the core of our sun at the speed of light without being affected or losing strength.
🎧 No other form of radiation can do that,
🎧 meaning that the knowledge we get about neutrinos can help us to control them.
🎧 With this ability, we can probe the centre of our Earth,
🎧 the inner layers of our sun, and the outer limits of our solar system,
🎧 and that makes it all worth the effort.
