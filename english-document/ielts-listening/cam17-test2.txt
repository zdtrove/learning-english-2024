🎧 Hello, Jane Fairbanks speaking.
🎧 Oh, good morning.
🎧 My name's Frank Pritchard.
🎧 I've just retired and moved to Southoe.
🎧 I'd like to become a volunteer,
🎧 and I gather you co-ordinate voluntary work in the village.
🎧 That's right.
🎧 What sort of thing could I do?
🎧 Well, we need help with the village library.
🎧 We borrow books from the town library,
🎧 and individuals also donate them.
🎧 So, one thing you could do is get involved in collecting them,
🎧 if you've got a car, that is.
🎧 Yes, that's no problem.
🎧 The times are pretty flexible so we can arrange it to suit you.
🎧 Oh, another thing is the records that we keep of the books we're given,
🎧 and those we borrow and need to return to the town library.
🎧 It would be very useful to have another person to help keep them up to date.
🎧 Right.
🎧 I'm used to working on a computer.
🎧 I presume they're computerised?
🎧 Oh yes.
🎧 Is the library purpose-built?
🎧 I haven't noticed it when I've walked round the village.
🎧 No, we simply have the use of a room in the village hall,
🎧 the West Room.
🎧 It's on the left as you go in.
🎧 I must go and have a look inside the hall.
🎧 Yes, it's a nice building.
🎧 Do you run a lunch club in the village for elderly people?
🎧 I know a lot of places do.
🎧 Yes, we have a very successful club.
🎧 I could help with transport, if that's of any use.
🎧 Oh definitely!
🎧 People come to the club from neighbouring villages,
🎧 and we're always in need of more drivers.
🎧 And does the club have groups that focus on a particular hobby, too?
🎧 I could get involved in one or two,
🎧 particularly if there are any art groups.
🎧 Excellent.
🎧 I'll find out where we need help and get back to you.
🎧 Fine.
🎧 What about help for individual residents.
🎧 Do you arrange that at all?
🎧 Yes, we do it as a one-off.
🎧 In fact, there's Mrs Carroll.
🎧 She needs a lift to the hospital next week,
🎧 and we're struggling to find someone.
🎧 When's her appointment?
🎧 On Tuesday. It would take the whole morning.
🎧 I could do that.
🎧 Oh, that would be great. Thank you.
🎧 And also, next week,
🎧 we're arranging to have some work done to Mr Selsbury's house before he moves,
🎧 as he isn't healthy enough to do it himself.
🎧 We've got some people to decorate his kitchen,
🎧 but if you could do some weeding in his garden,
🎧 that would be wonderful.
🎧 OK. I'd enjoy that.
🎧 And presumably the day and time are flexible.
🎧 Oh yes. Just say when would suit you best, and we'll let Mr Selsbury know.
🎧 Good.
🎧 The volunteers group also organises monthly social events,
🎧 which is a great way to meet other people, of course.
🎧 So next month, on the 19th of October,
🎧 we're holding a quiz,
🎧 a couple of residents are great at planning unusual ones,
🎧 and we always fill the village hall.
🎧 That sounds like fun.
🎧 Can I do anything to help?
🎧 Well, because of the number of people,
🎧 we need plenty of refreshments for halfway through.
🎧 So, if you could provide any, we'd be grateful.
🎧 I'm sure I could.
🎧 I'll think about what to make, and let you know.
🎧 Thank you.
🎧 Then on November the 18th,
🎧 we're holding a dance, also in the village hall.
🎧 We've booked a band that specialises in music of the 1930s,
🎧 they've been before, and we've had a lot of requests to bring them back.
🎧 I'm not really a dancer, but I'd like to do something to help.
🎧 Well, we sell tickets in advance,
🎧 and having an extra person to check them at the door, as people arrive, would be good,
🎧 it can be quite a bottleneck if everyone arrives at once!
🎧 OK, I'm happy with that.
🎧 Oh, we're also arranging a New Year's Eve party.
🎧 We're expecting that to be a really big event,
🎧 so instead of the village hall, it'll be held in the Mountfort Hotel.
🎧 The...?
🎧 Mountfort.
🎧 Mountfort Hotel.
🎧 It isn't in Southoe itself, but it's only a couple of miles away.
🎧 The hotel will be providing dinner and we've booked a band.
🎧 The one thing we haven't got yet is a poster.
🎧 That isn't something you could do, by any chance, is it?
🎧 Well actually, yes.
🎧 Before I retired I was a graphic designer, so that's right up my street.
🎧 Oh perfect!
🎧 I'll give you the details,
🎧 and then perhaps you could send me a draft...
🎧 Of course.
🎧 
🎧 Good morning, and welcome to Oniton Hall,
🎧 one of the largest estates in the area.
🎧 My name's Nick, and I'm one of the guides.
🎧 I'll give you a brief introduction to the estate while you're sitting down,
🎧 and then we'll walk round.
🎧 The estate consists of the house, gardens, parkland and farm,
🎧 and it dates back to the fourteenth century.
🎧 The original house was replaced in the late seventeenth century,
🎧 and of course it has had a large number of owners.
🎧 Almost all of them have left their mark,
🎧 generally by adding new rooms, like the ballroom and conservatory,
🎧 or by demolishing others.
🎧 The farm looks much as it's always done,
🎧 although the current owner has done a great deal of work to the flower beds.
🎧 In the seventeenth century, the estate was owned by a very wealthy man called Sir Edward Downes.
🎧 His intention was to escape from the world of politics,
🎧 after years as an active politician,
🎧 and to build a new house worthy of his big collection of books, paintings and sculptures.
🎧 He broke off contact with his former political allies,
🎧 and hosted meetings of creative and literary people, like painters and poets.
🎧 Unusually for his time, he didn't care whether his guests were rich or poor,
🎧 as long as they had talent.
🎧 Big houses like Oniton had dozens of servants until the 1920s or 30s,
🎧 and we've tried to show what their working lives were like.
🎧 Photographs of course don't give much of an idea,
🎧 so instead, as you go round the house,
🎧 you'll see volunteers dressed up as nineteenth-century servants, going about their work.
🎧 They'll explain what they're doing,
🎧 and tell you their recipes, or what tools they're using.
🎧 We've just introduced this feature to replace the audio guide we used to have available.
🎧 I see there are a number of children here with you today.
🎧 Well, we have several activities specially for children,
🎧 like dressing up in the sorts of clothes that children wore in the past,
🎧 and as it's a fine day, some of you will probably want to play in the adventure playground.
🎧 Our latest addition is child-sized tractors, that you can drive around the grounds.
🎧 We'll also be going into the farm that's part of the estate, where there's plenty to do.
🎧 Most of the buildings date from the eighteenth century,
🎧 so you can really step back into an agricultural past.
🎧 Until recently, the dairy was where milk from the cows was turned into cheese.
🎧 It's now the place to go for lunch, or afternoon tea,
🎧 or just a cup of coffee and a slice of homemade cake.
🎧 The big stone building that dominates the farm is the large barn,
🎧 and in here is our collection of agricultural tools.
🎧 These were used in the past to plough the earth, sow seeds, make gates, and much more.
🎧 There's a small barn, also made of stone,
🎧 where you can groom the donkeys and horses, to keep their coats clean.
🎧 They really seem to enjoy having it done,
🎧 and children love grooming them.
🎧 The horses no longer live in the stables,
🎧 which instead is the place to go to buy gifts, books,
🎧 our own jams and pickles, and clothes and blankets made of wool from our sheep.
🎧 Outside the shed, which is the only brick building,
🎧 you can climb into a horse-drawn carriage for a lovely, relaxing tour of the park and farm.
🎧 The carriages are well over a hundred years old.
🎧 And finally, the parkland, which was laid out in the eighteenth century,
🎧 with a lake and trees that are now well established.
🎧 You'll see types of cattle and sheep that are hardly ever found on farms these days.
🎧 We're helping to preserve them, to stop their numbers falling further.
🎧 OK, well, if you'd like to come with me, we will start...
🎧 
🎧 Did you make notes while you were watching the performances of Romeo and Juliet, Gemma?
🎧 Yes, I did. I found it quite hard though.
🎧 I kept getting too involved in the play.
🎧 Me too.
🎧 I ended up not taking notes.
🎧 I wrote down my impressions when I got home.
🎧 Do you mind if I check a few things with you?
🎧 In case I've missed anything.
🎧 And I've also got some questions about our assignment.
🎧 No, it's good to talk things through.
🎧 I may have missed things too.
🎧 OK great.
🎧 So first of all,
🎧 I'm not sure how much information we should include in our reviews.
🎧 Right. Well, I don't think we need to describe what happens.
🎧 Especially as Romeo and Juliet is one of Shakespeare's most well-known plays.
🎧 Yeah, everyone knows the story.
🎧 In an essay we'd focus on the poetry and Shakespeare's use of imagery etc.,
🎧 but that isn't really relevant in a review.
🎧 We're supposed to focus on how effective this particular production is.
🎧 We should say what made it a success or a failure.
🎧 And part of that means talking about the emotional impact the performance had on us.
🎧 I think that's important.
🎧 Yes.
🎧 And we should definitely mention how well the director handled important bits of the play -
🎧 like when Romeo climbs onto Juliet's balcony.
🎧 And the fight between Mercutio and Tybalt.
🎧 Yes.
🎧 It would also be interesting to mention the theatre space
🎧 and how the director used it
🎧 but I don't think we'll have space in 800 words.
🎧 No. OK.
🎧 That all sounds quite straightforward.
🎧 So what about The Emporium Theatre's production of the play?
🎧 I thought some things worked really well but there were some problems too.
🎧 Yeah. What about the set, for example?
🎧 I think it was visually really stunning.
🎧 I'd say that was probably the most memorable thing about this production.
🎧 You're right. The set design was really amazing,
🎧 but actually I have seen similar ideas used in other productions.
🎧 What about the lighting?
🎧 Some of the scenes were so dimly lit it was quite hard to see.
🎧 I didn't dislike it.
🎧 It helped to change the mood of the quieter scenes.
🎧 That's a good point.
🎧 What did you think of the costumes?
🎧 I was a bit surprised by the contemporary dress, I must say.
🎧 Yeah - I think it worked well, but I had assumed it would be more conventional.
🎧 Me too.
🎧 I liked the music at the beginning and I thought the musicians were brilliant,
🎧 but I thought they were wasted because the music didn't have much impact in Acts 2 and 3.
🎧 Yes - that was a shame.
🎧 One problem with this production was that the actors didn't deliver the lines that well.
🎧 They were speaking too fast.
🎧 It was a problem I agree,
🎧 but I thought it was because they weren't speaking loudly enough,
🎧 especially at key points in the play.
🎧 I actually didn't have a problem with that.
🎧 It's been an interesting experience watching different versions of Romeo and Juliet, hasn't it?
🎧 Definitely.
🎧 It's made me realise how relevant the play still is.
🎧 Right. I mean a lot's changed since Shakespeare's time,
🎧 but in many ways nothing's changed.
🎧 There are always disagreements and tension between teenagers and their parents.
🎧 Yes, that's something all young people can relate to -
🎧 more than the violence and the extreme emotions in the play.
🎧 How did you find watching it in translation?
🎧 Really interesting.
🎧 I expected to find it more challenging, but I could follow the story pretty well.
🎧 I stopped worrying about not being able to understand all the words and focused on the actors' expressions.
🎧 The ending was pretty powerful.
🎧 Yes. That somehow intensified the emotion for me.
🎧 Did you know Shakespeare's been translated into more languages than any other writer?
🎧 What's the reason for his international appeal, do you think?
🎧 I was reading that it's because his plays are about basic themes that people everywhere are familiar with.
🎧 Yeah, and they can also be understood on different levels.
🎧 The characters have such depth.
🎧 Right - which allows directors to experiment and find new angles.
🎧 That's really important...
🎧 
🎧 Right, everyone, let's make a start.
🎧 Over the past few sessions,
🎧 we've been considering the reasons why some world languages are in decline,
🎧 and today I'm going to introduce another factor that affects languages,
🎧 and the speakers of those languages,
🎧 and that's technology, and, in particular, digital technology.
🎧 In order to illustrate its effect,
🎧 I'm going to focus on the Icelandic language,
🎧 which is spoken by around 321,000 people,
🎧 most of whom live in Iceland - an island in the North Atlantic Ocean.
🎧 The problem for this language is not the number of speakers,
🎧 even though this number is small.
🎧 Nor is it about losing words to other languages, such as English.
🎧 In fact, the vocabulary of Icelandic is continually increasing
🎧 because when speakers need a new word for something,
🎧 they tend to create one, rather than borrowing from another language.
🎧 All this makes Icelandic quite a special language,
🎧 it's changed very little in the past millennium,
🎧 yet it can handle twenty-first-century concepts related to the use of computers and digital technology.
🎧 Take, for example, the word for web browser...
🎧 this is vafri in Icelandic,
🎧 which comes from the verb 'to wander'.
🎧 I can't think of a more appropriate term because that's exactly what you do mentally when you browse the internet.
🎧 Then there's an Icelandic word for podcast,
🎧 which is too hard to pronounce!
🎧 And so on.
🎧 Icelandic, then, is alive and growing, but - and it's a big but,
🎧 young Icelanders spend a great deal of time in the digital world
🎧 and this world is predominantly English.
🎧 Think about smartphones.
🎧 They didn't even exist until comparatively recently,
🎧 but today young people use them all the time to read books, watch TV or films,
🎧 play games, listen to music, and so on.
🎧 Obviously, this is a good thing in many respects because it promotes their bilingual skills,
🎧 but the extent of the influence of English in the virtual world is staggering
🎧 and it's all happening really fast.
🎧 For their parents and grandparents,
🎧 the change is less concerning because they already have their native-speaker skills in Icelandic.
🎧 But for young speakers -
🎧 well, the outcome is a little troubling.
🎧 For example, teachers have found that playground conversations in Icelandic secondary schools
🎧 can be conducted entirely in English,
🎧 while teachers of much younger children have reported situations
🎧 where their classes find it easier to say what is in a picture using English, rather than Icelandic.
🎧 The very real and worrying consequence of all this
🎧 is that the young generation in Iceland is at risk of losing its mother tongue.
🎧 Of course, this is happening to other European languages too,
🎧 but while internet companies might be willing to offer, say, French options in their systems,
🎧 it's much harder for them to justify the expense of doing the same for a language
🎧 that has a population the size of a French town, such as Nice.
🎧 The other drawback of Icelandic is the grammar,
🎧 which is significantly more complex than in most languages.
🎧 At the moment, the tech giants are simply not interested in tackling this.
🎧 So, what is the Icelandic government doing about this?
🎧 Well, large sums of money are being allocated to a language technology fund
🎧 that it is hoped will lead to the development of Icelandic sourced apps
🎧 and other social media and digital systems,
🎧 but clearly this is going to be an uphill struggle.
🎧 On the positive side,
🎧 they know that Icelandic is still the official language of education and government.
🎧 It has survived for well over a thousand years
🎧 and the experts predict that its future in this nation state is sound and will continue to be so.
🎧 However, there's no doubt that it's becoming an inevitable second choice in young people's lives.
🎧 This raises important questions.
🎧 When you consider how much of the past is tied up in a language,
🎧 will young Icelanders lose their sense of their own identity?
🎧 Another issue that concerns the government of Iceland is this.
🎧 If children are learning two languages through different routes,
🎧 neither of which they are fully fluent in,
🎧 will they be able to express themselves properly?
