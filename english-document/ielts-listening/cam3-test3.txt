[009] Cam3 - Test 3 - Part 1

🎧 Right... let's try and get it sorted out today
🎧 so we don't have it hanging over us. Okay?
🎧 Good idea. I'll take notes.
🎧 First thing... numbers...
🎧 have we got anything definite?
🎧 Well... I've been working it out and I think 40 to 43.
🎧 Shall we put 45 to be on the safe side?
🎧 Yep, fine.
🎧 Dates... well, that's straightforward.
🎧 The last working day before Christmas... which is...
🎧 which is December the 21st.
🎧 which is going to be pretty difficult to book at Christmas
🎧 so we'd better think of two or three places just to be on the safe side.
🎧 Well, last year's was hopeless.
🎧 The Red Lion, wasn't it?
🎧 Yep.
🎧 We ought to go for something more expensive, cos you...
🎧 ...you gets what you pay for.
🎧 That new Indian restaurant in Wetherfield is supposed to be excellent...
🎧 the Rajdoot.
🎧 How do you spell that?
🎧 RAJDOOT.
🎧 But it's bound to be packed.
🎧 Well, let's put that down as the first choice and have some back-ups.
🎧 What about the Park View Hotel as a second choice?
🎧 Yes, that's always reliable.
🎧 Park View Hotel...
🎧 And the London Arms in case.
🎧 London Arms...
🎧 I'll call them now if you want.
🎧 No. I'll do it, Joan.
🎧 You're really busy.
🎧 Oh, have you got the numbers?
🎧 Not for the Rajdoot, but...
🎧 right... Park View Hotel:
🎧 777192.
🎧 And London Arms: 208657.
🎧 Great.
🎧 Before I ring, we'd better just make sure they're within the price range.
🎧 Up to £15 a head?
🎧 I think you'll find some people won't be able to go that high.
🎧 Well, you can't get anything decent under £10.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 We'll say £12?
🎧 Okay.
🎧 And we'd better make sure there's good vegetarian food.
🎧 And a non-smoking section!
🎧 You know what the boss is like.
🎧 Don't remind me.
🎧 I'll let you know as soon as I get anything.
🎧 Good news. I found Rajdoot's number straight away
🎧 and they can fit us in.
🎧 Their Christmas menu sounds great.
🎧 What is it?
🎧 French onion soup or fruit juice.
🎧 Roast dinner or lentil curry...
🎧 sounds ordinary but my friend said it was really tasty.
🎧 Umm... lentil curry... that's unusual.
🎧 And then for dessert, there's traditional plum pudding
🎧 or apple pie, plus coffee.
🎧 That sounds really good for £12.
🎧 Did you book it?
🎧 Well, I said I'd check with the staff first.
🎧 But they did say they'd hold the booking until next Wednesday anyway.
🎧 Oh, and if we go ahead, they'd like a £50 deposit.
🎧 50 is normal... that's fine.
🎧 And they want a letter.
🎧 Right... to confirm.
🎧 They say with such large numbers we have to choose the menu in advance.
🎧 That won't be a problem.
🎧 I'll put up a notice with details of the restaurant and the menu.
🎧 When did you say they wanted confirmation by?
🎧 It was... let's see...
🎧 the 4th of November.
🎧 Where do you think I should put up the notice?
🎧 Where everyone's guaranteed to see it.
🎧 On the café noticeboard I should think.
🎧 Hardly anyone looks at that.
🎧 Well, the Newsletter is probably your best bet.
🎧 Good idea.
🎧 I'll go and do that now.

[010] Cam3 - Test 3 - Part 2

🎧 Welcome to the Sports Centre.
🎧 It's good to see that there are so many people wanting to find out about our sports facilities.
🎧 First of all, membership.
🎧 All students at the college are entitled to become members of the Sports Centre,
🎧 for an annual fee of £9.50.
🎧 To register with us and get your membership card,
🎧 you need to come to reception, between 2 and 6 pm,
🎧 Monday to Thursday.
🎧 I'm afraid we can't register new members on Friday,
🎧 so it's Monday to Thursday, 2 to 6, at reception.
🎧 Now, there are three things that you must remember to bring with you when you come to register;
🎧 they are: your Union card,
🎧 a recent passport-sized photograph of yourself, and the fee.
🎧 It doesn't matter whether you bring cash or a cheque.
🎧 We can't issue your card unless you bring all three; so, don't forget:
🎧 your Union card, passport photo and fee.
🎧 Then once you have got your sports card,
🎧 you will need to bring it with you whenever you come to book or use any Sports Centre facilities.
🎧 Booking over the phone is not allowed,
🎧 so you have to come here in person, with your card, when you want to book.
🎧 Our opening hours seem to get longer every year.
🎧 We are now open from 9am to 10pm on weekdays
🎧 and from 10am to 6pm on Saturdays.
🎧 For those of you who are up and about early in the morning,
🎧 we are introducing a 50% 'morning discount' this year.
🎧 This is because the facilities tended to be under-used in the mornings last year.
🎧 It means that all the sessions will be half-price between 9 am and 12 noon on weekdays.
🎧 So, what exactly are the facilities?
🎧 What sports can you play here?
🎧 Well, this room we are in at the moment is called the Main Hall,
🎧 and it's used mainly for team sports such as football, volleyball and basketball,
🎧 but also for badminton and aerobics.
🎧 On the other side of the reception area there is the dance studio;
🎧 this provides a smaller, more intimate space,
🎧 which we use for ballet, modern dance and martial arts -
🎧 not at the same time, of course.
🎧 Then, in a separate building, which you may have noticed on your way here...
🎧 it's on the other side of the car park...
🎧 there are the squash courts, six of them,
🎧 and at the far end of the building a fitness room.
🎧 This is our newest facility, only completed in the Spring,
🎧 but it is already proving to be one of the most popular.
🎧 As well as all these facilities available here on the campus,
🎧 we also have an arrangement with the local tennis club,
🎧 which is only two miles away,
🎧 entitling our students to use their courts on weekday mornings in the Summer.
🎧 So, I think that there should be something here for everybody,
🎧 and I hope to see all of you at the Centre, making use of the facilities.
🎧 If, in the course of the year,
🎧 you have any suggestions as to how the service we provide might be improved
🎧 or its appeal widened,
🎧 I'll be interested to hear from you.

[011] Cam3 - Test 3 - Part 3

🎧 Good morning, Mrs Collins.
🎧 I just wondered if you could help me with this entry form for the Young Electronic Engineer competition.
🎧 Hello, John.
🎧 Oh, you've made the jigsaw for blind children, with the bleeper.
🎧 When they put a piece in correctly, that's right.
🎧 Okay, let's have a look at the form.
🎧 Right, thanks.
🎧 I've never filled in one of these before, so...
🎧 Well, let's just do it in pencil first.
🎧 So, name of designers...
🎧 Well, Anne helped me with some of the electronics work.
🎧 Then you must put her name in as well.
🎧 Right...
🎧 Ann Ray.
🎧 Sorry. It's ANNE
🎧 and her surname is spelt REA.
🎧 Good start! Okay...
🎧 REA.
🎧 And age is easy. You're both 16.
🎧 What have you called the design? Keep it short.
🎧 What about jigsaw puzzle design for visually handicapped?
🎧 Too long.
🎧 Just say blind puzzle, that'll do.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 Right, now, size of equipment?
🎧 I've got it noted down here...
🎧 um, yes, length, sorry, width is 20 centimetres.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 Length is 50 centimetres,
🎧 and then the depth is... well, it's very little.
🎧 What would you say? I think you can be approximate.
🎧 I'd say 2.5 centimetres.
🎧 And the electricity supply?
🎧 Is it mains operated?
🎧 No it isn't, it's actually battery.
🎧 Okay, write battery.
🎧 Fine.
🎧 Okay. It's the next bit that I'm really not sure what to put.
🎧 Well, special features means...
🎧 what is really new about this, you know, suitable for the group you made it for.
🎧 Well, it's safe for children.
🎧 That's fine. Put that in.
🎧 Okay, and of course we think it's educational.
🎧 There you are, you've done it.
🎧 Anything else?
🎧 Well, I think the price is good.
🎧 That's probably the most important factor.
🎧 Okay... cheap price.
🎧 Which brings us on to the next bit.
🎧 What's the cost?
🎧 Well, the pieces we made out of old wood...
🎧 they cost, ooh, $5.
🎧 And the electrics?
🎧 They were more expensive... say, $9.50.
🎧 Brilliant.
🎧 Now what do they mean by other comments?
🎧 It's just a chance for you to say anything about the equipment, and problems you envisage.
🎧 Well, we would really like help with making plastic instead of wooden pieces.
🎧 Well, put something like, need help to make plastic pieces.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 And the other thing is, we'd like to develop a range of sizes.
🎧 That's fine, then, just put that.
🎧 And the last bit is,
🎧 when will you send the equipment?
🎧 Well, we've got a lot of work on at the moment and...
🎧 we want to get it as good as we can.
🎧 Well, say 25th of June?
🎧 Can't we make it later?
🎧 Well, the last date is the 1st of July.
🎧 Why not say that?
🎧 Okay, that's what I'll put.
🎧 So, that's the lot!
🎧 That's brilliant.
🎧 Thanks very much, Mrs Collins.
🎧 I'll send it off straight away.
🎧 Glad to be of help.
🎧 Very best of luck to you both.
🎧 Thanks, bye.
🎧 Bye.

[012] Cam3 - Test 3 - Part 4

🎧 Today I'd like to introduce Ted Hunter,
🎧 who used to rear sheep and poultry
🎧 but who is here to tell us about a rather unusual type of livestock
🎧 that he's been concentrating on in the last few years.
🎧 Ted Hunter is a member of the Domesticated Ostrich Farming Association,
🎧 and is here to tell us about the possibilities of breeding and rearing these birds in this country.
🎧 Thank you, Paula.
🎧 When you look at international restaurant menus and supermarkets,
🎧 they all tend to feature the same range of meats -
🎧 beef, lamb, chicken, pork, that sort of thing.
🎧 But people are always interested in something different
🎧 and we're now finding that farming can bring new types of meat to our tables.
🎧 The kangaroo is one animal that's now being farmed for its meat
🎧 and eaten outside Australia, where it comes from.
🎧 It looks and tastes rather like rabbit,
🎧 though it's slightly darker in colour,
🎧 but it is rather tough, so that's a problem for some people.
🎧 Crocodiles are also being farmed for their meat.
🎧 This is rather like chicken,
🎧 pale and tender, and it's getting quite fashionable.
🎧 Some people also find it's rather fatty, but
🎧 I think it makes a really tasty sandwich.
🎧 Now a third type of meat becoming increasingly available,
🎧 and the one that I think is by far the nicest of the three, is ostrich,
🎧 which most people say has a similar taste and texture to beef.
🎧 However, it's much better for you than beef, as we'll see later.
🎧 Most people think of ostriches as wild animals,
🎧 but in fact ostriches have been farmed in South Africa since around 1860.
🎧 At first they were produced for their feathers.
🎧 In Africa they were used for tribal ceremonial dress
🎧 and they were also exported to Europe and America
🎧 where they were made into ladies' fans and used for decorating hats.
🎧 Later, feather fans and big, decorated hats went out of fashion
🎧 but ostriches were still bred,
🎧 this time for their hide.
🎧 This can be treated to produce about half a square metre of leather -
🎧 very delicate, fine stuff of very good quality.
🎧 At the same time, some of the meat was used for biltong -
🎧 the air-dried strips of meat popular in South Africa as a sort of fast food.
🎧 However, recently there's been more and more interest in the development of ostrich farming in other parts of the world,
🎧 and more people are recognising its value as a food source.
🎧 Ostrich meat is slightly higher in protein than beef -
🎧 and much lower in fats and cholesterol.
🎧 It tastes good too.
🎧 A series of European taste tests
🎧 found that 82% of people prefer ostrich to beef.
🎧 And one ostrich produces a lot of meat -
🎧 from around 30 to 50 kg mostly from the hindquarters of the bird.
🎧 Farmed ostriches don't need African climates,
🎧 and in fact ostrich farming is now becoming well established in other parts of the world.
🎧 However, setting up an ostrich farm isn't something to embark on lightly.
🎧 Mature breeding birds are very expensive -
🎧 even a fertilised ostrich egg isn't cheap
🎧 so you need quite a bit of capital to begin with.
🎧 Then the farmer needs special equipment such as incubators for the eggs.
🎧 The young chicks are very dependent on human minders,
🎧 and need a lot of attention from the people looking after them.
🎧 In addition, ostriches can't be intensively farmed -
🎧 they need space and exercise.
🎧 But in spite of this, they make good farming sense.
🎧 A cow produces only one calf a year
🎧 whereas a female ostrich can lay an egg every other day.
🎧 And because the farmers can use incubators and...
🎧 hatched chicks are nourished well and protected from danger,
🎧 the failure rate on farms is very low indeed
🎧 and almost all the fertilised eggs will hatch out into chicks
🎧 which will in turn reach maturity.
🎧 This is very different from the situation in the wild,
🎧 where the vast majority of chicks will die or be killed
🎧 before they grow up into mature ostriches.
🎧 So it's possible, once the initial outlay has been made,
🎧 for the farmer to be looking at very good profit margins indeed.
🎧 Ostrich farming is still in its early days outside Africa
🎧 but we hope that ostrich meat will be freely available soon
🎧 and before long will be as cheap as beef.
