[113] Cam10 - Test 1 - Part 1

🎧 Good morning. World Tours.
🎧 My name is Jamie.
🎧 How can I help you?
🎧 Good morning.
🎧 I want some information on self-drive tours in the USA.
🎧 Could you send me a brochure?
🎧 Of course.
🎧 Could I have your name please?
🎧 Andrea Brown.
🎧 Thank you.
🎧 And your address?
🎧 24, Ardleigh Road.
🎧 Can you spell that?
🎧 A-R-D-L-E-I-G-H Road.
🎧 Postcode?
🎧 BH52OP
🎧 Thanks.
🎧 And can I have your phone number?
🎧 Is a mobile alright?
🎧 Fine.
🎧 It's 07786643091.
🎧 Thank you.
🎧 And can I ask you where you heard about World Tours?
🎧 From a friend? Or did you see an advert somewhere?
🎧 No, I read about you in the newspaper.
🎧 OK, I'll get the brochures in the post to you but can I give you some information over the phone.
🎧 What kinds of things do you want to do on your holiday?
🎧 I'm interested in going to California with my family.
🎧 I've got two children and we want to hire a car.
🎧 OK.
🎧 We have a couple of self-drive tours there visiting different places of interest in California.
🎧 The first one begins in Los Angeles and there's plenty of time to visit some of the theme parks there.
🎧 That's something on my children's list so I'd want to include that.
🎧 Good. Then you drive to San Francisco.
🎧 From San Francisco you can drive to Yosemite Park where you spend a couple of nights.
🎧 You can choose to stay in a lodge or on the campsite.
🎧 I don't like the idea of staying in a tent.
🎧 It'd be too hot.
🎧 Right.
🎧 And the tour ends in Las Vegas.
🎧 OK.
🎧 The other trip we can arrange is slightly different.
🎧 It starts in San Francisco.
🎧 Then you drive south to Cambria.
🎧 Someone told me there's a really nice castle near Cambria.
🎧 Will we go near that?
🎧 Hearst Castle is on that road so you could stop there.
🎧 Good. I'd like to do that.
🎧 Does this trip also go into the desert?
🎧 No, it continues to Santa Monica where most people like to stop and do some shopping.
🎧 We have enough of that at home so that doesn't interest us.
🎧 OK. Well you could go straight on to San Diego.
🎧 That's good for beaches isn't it?
🎧 That's right, that's a good place to relax and your children might like to visit the zoo before flying home.
🎧 I don't think so.
🎧 We want some time for sunbathing and swimming.
🎧 So how many days are the trips and how much do they cost?
🎧 The first one I told you about is a self-drive tour through California
🎧 which lasts twelve days and covers 2,020 kilometres.
🎧 The shortest journey is 206 kilometres
🎧 and the longest is 632 kilometres.
🎧 The cost is £525 per person.
🎧 That includes accommodation, car rental and a flight but no meals.
🎧 OK. And the other trip?
🎧 That lasts nine days but you spend only three days on the road.
🎧 You cover about 980 kilometres altogether.
🎧 So is that cheaper then?
🎧 Yes, it's almost a hundred pounds cheaper.
🎧 It's £429 per person, which is a good deal.
🎧 So that covers accommodation and car hire.
🎧 What about flights?
🎧 They aren't included.
🎧 But these hotels offer dinner in the price.
🎧 OK. Well, thank you very much.
🎧 I'll be in touch when I've had a chance to look at the brochure.
🎧 I'm pleased to help.
🎧 Goodbye.
🎧 Goodbye.

[114] Cam10 - Test 1 - Part 2

🎧 On behalf of LP Clubs, I'd like to welcome you all here today.
🎧 My name's Sandy Fisher and I'm one of the fitness managers here.
🎧 Before we start our tour of the club
🎧 I'll just run through some basic information about the facilities we have here,
🎧 including recent improvements, and explain the types of membership available.
🎧 Our greatest asset is probably our swimming pool
🎧 which at 25 metres isn't Olympic-sized,
🎧 but now we've expanded it to eight lanes, it's much wider.
🎧 This means there are rarely more than a couple of people at a time in each lane.
🎧 Unfortunately, there isn't space for an outdoor pool here
🎧 but the glass roof on the swimming pool is partly retractable,
🎧 which means you can enjoy something of the open-air experience on warmer days.
🎧 Our recently refurbished fitness suite has all the latest exercise equipment
🎧 including ten new running machines, and a wide range of weight-training machines.
🎧 Each member is given full training in how to operate the equipment
🎧 and there is always a trainer on duty to offer help and advice.
🎧 Although we do have adult-only times after 6 and at certain times at weekends,
🎧 children are well catered for.
🎧 Older children continue to benefit from a wide range of tuition;
🎧 anything from trampolining to yoga.
🎧 One thing all our members appreciate about us is that we take very good care of them.
🎧 This starts on day one with your personal assessment.
🎧 You are asked to fill in a questionnaire giving details of any health problems.
🎧 One of our personal trainers will then go through this with you.
🎧 The trainer will then take you through the safety rules for using the equipment in the fitness suite.
🎧 During your next exercise session, a personal trainer will work with you to make sure you understand these.
🎧 It's very important to do this because we really do want to avoid having any sports injuries.
🎧 There's a lot more to looking after yourself than simply lifting weights!
🎧 At the end of the personal assessment,
🎧 the trainer will draw up a plan, outlining what you should try to achieve within a six-week period.
🎧 This will then be reviewed at the end of the six weeks.
🎧 Now, I'll just quickly run through the types of membership we have available.
🎧 All members must pay a joining fee of £90
🎧 in addition to the rates for the monthly membership fees.
🎧 Gold membership entitles you to free entry at all LP Clubs.
🎧 There are now LP clubs in all major cities and towns
🎧 so if you travel a lot, this will be a great advantage.
🎧 Individual gold membership costs £50 a month
🎧 and joint membership for you and your partner will cost £75.
🎧 Premier membership is for professional people
🎧 whose work commitments make it difficult for them to use the club during the day
🎧 and so LP gives booking preferences to Premier members at peak times.
🎧 This means you will find it easier to book the sessions at times that suit you.
🎧 Reciprocal arrangements with other LP Clubs are available to Premier members.
🎧 Premier membership is for individuals only,
🎧 but you will be sent passes for guests every month.
🎧 The monthly fee is £65.
🎧 You don't have to have any special clothes or equipment when you visit the club.
🎧 We provide robes and hairdryers in the changing rooms,
🎧 but it's very important to remember your photo card
🎧 because you won't be able to get in without it.
🎧 For people who aren't working...

[115] Cam10 - Test 1 - Part 3

🎧 Erm… hello Professor, I'm John Wishart.
🎧 I'm working on my entry for the Global Design Competition.
🎧 My tutor said you might be able to help me with it.
🎧 Ah, yes, I got a copy of your drawings.
🎧 Come in and tell me about it.
🎧 What sort of competition is it?
🎧 Well, it's an international design competition
🎧 and we have to come up with a new design for a typical domestic kitchen appliance.
🎧 I see, and are there any special conditions? Does it have to save energy for example?
🎧 Actually that was the focus in last year's competition.
🎧 This year's different.
🎧 We have to adopt an innovative approach to existing technology,
🎧 using it in a way that hasn't been thought of before.
🎧 I see, that sounds tricky.
🎧 And what kitchen appliance have you chosen?
🎧 Well, I decided to choose the dishwasher.
🎧 Interesting, what made you choose that?
🎧 Well, they're an everyday kitchen appliance in most Australian houses
🎧 but they're all pretty boring and almost identical to each other.
🎧 I think some people will be prepared to pay a little extra for something that looks different.
🎧 That's a nice idea.
🎧 I see you've called your design 'the Rockpool'; why is that?
🎧 Basically because it looks like the rock pools you find on a beach.
🎧 The top is made of glass so that you can look down into it.
🎧 And there's a stone at the bottom.
🎧 Is that just for decoration?
🎧 Actually it does have a function.
🎧 Instead of pushing a button, you turn the stone.
🎧 So it's really just a novel way of starting the dishwasher.
🎧 That's right.
🎧 It's a really nice design, but what makes it innovative?
🎧 Well, I decided to make a dishwasher that uses carbon dioxide.
🎧 In place of water and detergent?
🎧 How will you manage that?
🎧 The idea is to pressurize the carbon dioxide so that it becomes a liquid.
🎧 The fluid is then released into the dishwasher where it cleans the dishes all by itself.
🎧 Sounds like a brilliant idea!
🎧 Your system will totally do away with the need for strong detergents.
🎧 So what happens once the dishes are clean?
🎧 Well, to allow them to dry,
🎧 the liquid carbon dioxide and the waste materials all go to an area called the holding chamber.
🎧 That's where the liquid is depressurised and so it reverts to a gas.
🎧 Then the oil and grease are separated out and sent to the waste system.
🎧 It sounds like you've thought it all out very thoroughly.
🎧 So, what happens to the carbon dioxide once the process is complete?
🎧 Not wasted I hope.
🎧 Actually, that's where the real savings are made.
🎧 The carbon dioxide is sent back to the cylinder and can be used again and again.
🎧 What a terrific idea.
🎧 Do you think it will ever be built?
🎧 Probably not, but that's OK.
🎧 Well, I'm sure a lot of positive things will come out of your design.
🎧 Now, you seem to have thought about everything so what exactly did you need me to help you with?
🎧 Well, my design has made it to the final stage of the competition
🎧 and, in a few months' time. I have to give a presentation,
🎧 and that's the part I was hoping you could help me with.
🎧 Right, well that should be easy enough.
🎧 What have you managed to do so far?
🎧 Well, I've got detailed drawings to show how it will work
🎧 and I've also written a 500-word paper on it.
🎧 I see.
🎧 Well, if you want to stand a good chance of winning you really need a model of the machine.
🎧 Yes, I thought I might but I'm having a few problems.
🎧 What is the main difficulty so far?
🎧 Let me guess - is it the materials?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 I want it to look professional but everything that's top quality is also very expensive.
🎧 Look, projects like this are very important to us.
🎧 They really help lift our profile.
🎧 So why don't you talk to the university about a grant?
🎧 I can help you fill out the application forms if you like.
🎧 That would be great.
🎧 You'd better show me this paper you've written as well.
🎧 For a global competition such as this
🎧 you need to make sure the technical details you've given are accurate and thorough.
🎧 Oh, that would be a great help.
🎧 Is there anything else I can do?
🎧 Well, I'm really…

[116] Cam10 - Test 1 - Part 4

🎧 Today we continue our series on ecology and conservation
🎧 with a look at a particularly endangered member of the black bear family.
🎧 One in ten black bears is actually born with a white coat,
🎧 which is the result of a special gene that surfaces in a few.
🎧 Local people have named it 'the spirit bear'.
🎧 And according to the legends of these communities,
🎧 its snowy fur brings with it a special power.
🎧 Because of this, it has always been highly regarded by them -
🎧 so much that they do not speak of seeing it to anyone else.
🎧 It is their way of protecting it when strangers visit the area.
🎧 The white bear's habitat is quite interesting.
🎧 The bear's strong relationship with the old-growth rainforest is a complex one.
🎧 The white bear relies on the huge centuries-old trees in the forest in many ways.
🎧 For example, the old-growth trees have extremely long roots
🎧 that help prevent erosion of the soil along the banks of the many fish streams.
🎧 Keeping these banks intact is important
🎧 because these streams are home to salmon,
🎧 which are the bear's main food source.
🎧 In return, the bear's feeding habits nurture the forest.
🎧 As the bears eat the salmon,
🎧 they discard the skin and bones in great amounts on the forest floor,
🎧 which provide vital nutrients.
🎧 These produce lush vegetation that sustains thousands of other types of life forms,
🎧 from birds to insects and more.
🎧 Today, the spirit bear lives off the coast of the province of British Columbia on a few islands.
🎧 There is great concern for their survival
🎧 since it is estimated that less than 200 of these white bears remain.
🎧 The best way to protect them is to make every effort to preserve the delicate balance of their forest environment -
🎧 in other words, their ecosystem.
🎧 The greatest threat to the bear's existence is the loss of its habitat.
🎧 Over many years, logging companies have stripped the land by cutting down a large number of trees.
🎧 In addition, they have built roads which have fractured the areas where the bear usually feeds,
🎧 and many hibernation sites have also been lost.
🎧 The logging of the trees along the streams has damaged the places where the bears fish.
🎧 To make matters worse,
🎧 the number of salmon in those streams is declining
🎧 because there is no legal limit on fishing at the moment.
🎧 All these influences have a negative impact on the spirit bear's very existence,
🎧 which is made all the more fragile
🎧 by the fact that reproduction among these bears has always been disappointingly low.
🎧 And so, what's the situation going forward?
🎧 Community organizations, environmental groups and the British Columbia government
🎧 are now working together on the problem.
🎧 The government is now requiring logging companies
🎧 to adopt a better logging method, which is a positive step.
🎧 However, these measures alone may not be sufficient to ensure a healthy population of the spirit bear in the future.
🎧 Other steps also need to be taken.
🎧 While it is important to maintain the spirit bear's habitat,
🎧 there also needs to be more emphasis on its expansion.
🎧 The move is justified as it will also create space for other bears that are losing their homes…
