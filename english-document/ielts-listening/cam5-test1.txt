[033] Cam5 - Test 1 - Part 1

🎧 Good afternoon, Dreamtime Travel.
🎧 How can I help you?
🎧 Oh hello.
🎧 I'm interested in the holidays you offer along the coast near here.
🎧 Yes. We operate several tours up the coast.
🎧 Where in particular did you want to go?
🎧 Well, I like the sound of the holiday that mentioned whales.
🎧 Was it 'Whale Watching"?
🎧 Oh, that's our Whale Watch Experience.
🎧 It's very popular
🎧 and it's based in a lovely little town with nice beaches.
🎧 Oh right, and how long does it last?
🎧 It's two days
🎧 that includes four hours' travel time each way from here.
🎧 Good, I don't want to be away any longer than that.
🎧 So is that by coach?
🎧 Actually it's by minibus.
🎧 We like to keep those tours small and personal so we don't take a whole coachload of people.
🎧 In fact, we only take up to fifteen people on this tour,
🎧 although we do run it with just twelve or thirteen.
🎧 Oh, right.
🎧 So do you run these tours often?
🎧 Well, it depends on the time of year.
🎧 Of course in peak times like the summer holidays, we do them every weekend,
🎧 but at the moment, it's usually once a month at most.
🎧 And when is the next one going?
🎧 Mmm, let me see.
🎧 Um, there's one in three weeks' time which is April the 18th,
🎧 and then we don't have another one until June the 2nd.
🎧 And is April a good time to go?
🎧 Pretty good.
🎧 Though the really good time is later in the year.
🎧 I have to say though that the whale sighting is only one of the many things offered.
🎧 Really?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 The hotel itself where you stay has great facilities.
🎧 It's called The Pallisades.
🎧 The Paris what?
🎧 No, it's actually The Pallisades,
🎧 PALLISADES.
🎧 It's right on the main beach there.
🎧 Oh, I see.
🎧 All of the rooms have nice views and the food is really good there too.
🎧 Oh right.
🎧 And what about the other things?
🎧 You know, that are included in the price.
🎧 Oh, there are lots of things.
🎧 If you don't want to do the whale watch cruise,
🎧 your guide will take anyone who is interested either on a bushwalk through the national park near the hotel,
🎧 and there's no extra charge for that,
🎧 or on a fishing trip.
🎧 That's an extra $12 I think.
🎧 And there's also a reptile park in town -
🎧 that costs more or less the same.
🎧 No, I think I'd prefer whales to snakes.
🎧 Yeah.
🎧 And if you just want to relax, you are free to sit by the hotel pool or go down the beach.
🎧 Oh, and they also have tennis courts at the hotel,
🎧 but you have to pay for those by the hour.
🎧 But there are table tennis tables downstairs
🎧 and they're part of the accommodation package.
🎧 Just speak to your guide.
🎧 Well, that sounds good.
🎧 So how much is the basic tour price?
🎧 At this time of year, it's usually around $300 but...
🎧 let me check.
🎧 Oh, it's actually $280.
🎧 And the next tour, are there any places on that one?
🎧 How many people is it for?
🎧 There are two of us.
🎧 Yes, that should be fine.
🎧 Can I just mention that we require all bookings to be made at least 14 days before you travel
🎧 to avoid cancellations of tours.
🎧 And if you cancel within seven days of departure,
🎧 you will have to pay 50% of your total booking.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 And you also need to pay a 20% deposit at the time of booking.
🎧 Can I pay that by credit card?
🎧 Yes, you can.
🎧 All right, what I'll do is I'll talk to my partner and get back to you.
🎧 Fine.
🎧 So, I'll make a provisional booking, shall I?
🎧 Two for the Whale Watch Experience.
🎧 Let me issue you with a customer reference number for when you call back.
🎧 Do you have a pen?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 OK, it's 39745T.
🎧 That's T for tango.
🎧 When you call back, ask to speak to the Tour Manager, that's me, Tracy.
🎧 Fine, I will.

[034] Cam5 - Test 1 - Part 2

🎧 Hello and welcome to today's 'Buyer Beware' programme,
🎧 where we give you some tips on how to spend your money wisely.
🎧 Now, in today's show we're looking at beds for children and babies.
🎧 Let's start by looking at baby cots,
🎧 that's for children of up to three years old.
🎧 We tested three different cots all in the budget price range and, as usual,
🎧 we will feature the good points, the problems and our verdict.
🎧 The first cot we looked at was by Baby Safe
🎧 and it had several good points to recommend it.
🎧 Our testers liked the fact that it had four wheels,
🎧 so it was easy to move around.
🎧 The only slight problems with this cot were that it had no brakes,
🎧 but they didn't think that mattered too much.
🎧 At first they were a bit concerned about the side bar,
🎧 because they felt babies could trap their fingers in it,
🎧 but our testers felt that this was unlikely to happen,
🎧 so they have given this one a verdict of 'satisfactory'.
🎧 The next cot was by Choice Cots
🎧 and this time our testers were pleased to find a cot which is simple to put together -
🎧 unlike others we looked at.
🎧 On the minus side, our testers did not like the fact that the side of the cot did not drop down,
🎧 making it difficult to pick up newborn babies.
🎧 However, the real problem with this cot was the space between the bars;
🎧 our testers found they were too wide
🎧 and a baby could easily trap his head.
🎧 We felt this was a real safety hazard
🎧 and so we have labelled this one dangerous, I'm afraid.
🎧 And finally better news for the Mother's Choice cot.
🎧 This cot was slightly different in that, although the side bar did not drop down,
🎧 the base could be raised or lowered into two different positions
🎧 making it safe as well as convenient.
🎧 The negatives for this one were quite minor;
🎧 the only niggle everyone had was the fact that it has no wheels
🎧 and the only other problem anyone could find was that there were pictures
🎧 which were simply stuck on and so could easily become detached.
🎧 The makers have now promised to discontinue this practice.
🎧 As this cot will then be safe in every way,
🎧 we have made the Mother's Choice cot our best buy,
🎧 Congratulations Mother's Choice!
🎧 So, what features should you look for in a baby's cot?
🎧 Well obviously safety is a very important factor as well as comfort and convenience.
🎧 We recommend that, if you are buying a cot,
🎧 do make sure that any metal present is not rusted or bent in any way.
🎧 You should ensure your cot has only rounded or smooth edging without any sharp edges,
🎧 this is especially important for wooden cots.
🎧 And now on to beds...

[035] Cam5 - Test 1 - Part 3

🎧 Excuse me, I was told to come here for advice about...
🎧 Management Diploma courses?
🎧 You've certainly come to the right place.
🎧 Hi, my name is Monica.
🎧 Nice to meet you.
🎧 My name is Andrew, Andrew Harris.
🎧 So, Andrew, have you seen our diploma course prospectus yet?
🎧 Yes, I've already looked at it.
🎧 In fact, I thought the information on course content was really useful,
🎧 but I'm afraid I'm a bit confused by all the different ways you can do the course:
🎧 full-time intensive, part-time and so on.
🎧 Well, let's see if I can help.
🎧 I think each course type has its advantages and disadvantages, so it really depends on you -
🎧 your own study habits, and your financial circumstances, of course.
🎧 Are you working at the moment?
🎧 Yes. I've been working in the administration section of the local hospital for the last three years.
🎧 And before that I worked in the office of a computer engineering company for two years.
🎧 So, I've got about five years of relevant work experience.
🎧 And what I'm hoping to focus on is Personnel Management.
🎧 I see.
🎧 And are you planning to leave your current job to study,
🎧 or are you thinking about just taking a year off?
🎧 I want to know what my options are, really.
🎧 I don't want to quit my job or anything
🎧 and my employers are keen for me to get some more qualifications
🎧 but obviously, it would be better if I could do a course without taking too much time away from work.
🎧 Right, so you don't really want to do the full-time course, then?
🎧 No, not really.
🎧 It's also a question of finances.
🎧 You see, my office have agreed to pay the cost of the course itself,
🎧 but I would have to take unpaid leave if I want to study full-time and, well...
🎧 I don't think I could afford to support myself with no salary for a whole year.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 Well, you have two other possibilities:
🎧 you could either do the part-time course -
🎧 that would be over two years and you wouldn't have to take any time off work -
🎧 or you could do what we call a 'modular' course.
🎧 You could do that in eighteen months if you wanted or longer,
🎧 it's quite flexible and it would be up to you.
🎧 So what does the part-time course involve?
🎧 For that you would join an evening class and have a lecture twice a week.
🎧 Then, you'd have to attend a seminar or discussion workshop one weekend a month.
🎧 What kind of coursework would I have to do?
🎧 Well, it's a mixture.
🎧 You'd be expected to write an essay each month, which counts towards your final assessment.
🎧 You have a case study to do by the end of the course,
🎧 which might involve doing a survey or something like that,
🎧 and also you need to hand in a short report every four weeks.
🎧 So, that's quite a lot of work, then, on top of working every day.
🎧 It sounds like a lot of studying and really tiring.
🎧 Yeah, you certainly wouldn't have much free time!
🎧 What about the 'modular' course?
🎧 What would I have to do for that?
🎧 That's where you get the opportunity to study full-time for short periods.
🎧 That way you can cover a lot of coursework
🎧 and attend lectures and seminars during the day.
🎧 And each module lasts for one term, say, about twelve weeks at a time.
🎧 There are obvious advantages in this -
🎧 the main one being that you can study in a much more intensive way,
🎧 which suits some people much better.
🎧 And how many of these 'modules' would I have to do to get the diploma?
🎧 The current programme is two modules -
🎧 and then you have to choose a topic to work in more depth -
🎧 but you can base that on your job,
🎧 and so you don't need to be away from the office,
🎧 and how long it takes is up to you.
🎧 The important thing is that you don't have to study and work.
🎧 You can focus on one thing at a time.
🎧 Yes, I can see that.
🎧 It certainly sounds attractive!
🎧 It would be more expensive, though.
🎧 I mean, I'd have to support myself without pay for each module.
🎧 That's true, so that might be a problem for you.
🎧 Look, why don't you talk this over with your employers...

[036] Cam5 - Test 1 - Part 4

🎧 Okay, so we've been looking at the attitudes of various social and cultural groups towards the management of their personal finances -
🎧 how important they feel it is to save money,
🎧 and what they save their money for.
🎧 One aspect that we haven't yet considered is gender.
🎧 So if we consider gender issues,
🎧 we're basically asking whether men and women have different attitudes towards saving money,
🎧 and whether they save money for different things.
🎧 Back in 1928 the British writer George Bernard Shaw
🎧 wrote in his Intelligent Women's Guide to Socialism and Capitalism
🎧 that 'a man is supposed to understand politics. economics and finance'
🎧 'and is therefore unwilling to accept essential instruction.'
🎧 He also said, 'A woman, having fewer pretensions, is far more willing to learn'.
🎧 Now, though these days people might question a lot of the assumptions contained in those statements,
🎧 recent research does suggest that there are some quite fundamental differences between men and women
🎧 in their attitudes to economic matters.
🎧 Let's look at what men and women actually save for.
🎧 Research studies of women in North America have found that...
🎧 women are far more likely to save for their children's education
🎧 and they are also more likely to save up in order to buy a house one day.
🎧 The same studies have found that men, on the other hand,
🎧 tend to save for a car,
🎧 which, by the way, takes a surprisingly large amount of the household budget in North America.
🎧 But the other main priority for men when saving money is their retirement.
🎧 When they're earning, they're far more likely to put money aside for their old age than women are.
🎧 Now, this is rather disturbing,
🎧 because in fact the need for women to save for their old age is far greater than for men.
🎧 Let's consider this for a moment.
🎧 To start with, it is a fact that throughout the world,
🎧 women are likely to live many years longer than men,
🎧 so they need money to support them during this time.
🎧 Since women are likely to be the ones left without a partner in old age,
🎧 they may therefore have to pay for nursing care,
🎧 because they don't have a spouse to look after them.
🎧 Furthermore the high divorce rates in North America are creating a poverty cycle for women.
🎧 It is the divorced women who will most often have to look after the children
🎧 and thus they need more money to look after not just themselves but others.
🎧 So what can be done about this situation?
🎧 The population in North America is likely to contain an increasing number of elderly women.
🎧 The research indicates that at present
🎧 for women, it takes a crisis to make them think about their future financial situation.
🎧 But of course, this is the very worst time for anyone to make important decisions.
🎧 Women today need to look ahead, think ahead -
🎧 not wait until they're under pressure.
🎧 Even women in their early twenties need to think about pensions, for example,
🎧 and with increasing numbers of women in professional positions,
🎧 there are signs that this is beginning to happen.
🎧 Then research also suggests that
🎧 women avoid dealing effectively with their economic situation
🎧 because of a lack of confidence.
🎧 The best way for them to overcome this
🎧 is by getting themselves properly informed
🎧 so they are less dependent on other people's advice.
🎧 A number of initiatives have been set up to help them do this.
🎧 This College, for example, is one of the educational institutions
🎧 which offers night classes in Money Management,
🎧 and increasing numbers of women are enrolling on such courses.
🎧 Here, they can be given advice on different ways of saving.
🎧 Many women are unwilling to invest in stocks and shares, for instance,
🎧 but these can be extremely profitable.
🎧 It is usually advised that at least 70% of a person's savings should be in low-risk investments
🎧 but for the rest, financial advisors often advise taking some well-informed risks.
🎧 Initiatives such as this can give women the economic skills and knowledge they need
🎧 for a comfortable, independent retirement.
🎧 The increasing proportion of elderly women in the population...
