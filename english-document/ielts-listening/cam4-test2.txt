[021] Cam4 - Test 2 - Part 1

🎧 Oh, Peter, there you are.
🎧 You've been ages. What kept you so long?
🎧 I'm sorry I'm so late, Sally.
🎧 Have you been waiting long?
🎧 Oh, half an hour.
🎧 But it doesn't matter.
🎧 I've had a coffee and I've been reading this guidebook for tourists.
🎧 Sit down.
🎧 You look very hot and tired.
🎧 What would you like to drink?
🎧 I'd love a really chilled mineral water or something.
🎧 Will you have another coffee?
🎧 Yes, I will.
🎧 The waitress will be back in a moment.
🎧 Why were you so late?
🎧 Did something happen?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 You know, I went to the bank to cash some travellers cheques?
🎧 Well, the exchange rate was looking healthy, but...
🎧 when I went to the teller, they told me the computer system was temporarily down,
🎧 so they couldn't do any transactions.
🎧 They said the problem would be fixed in a few minutes, so I waited.
🎧 And then I started talking to another guy in the bank,
🎧 and I forgot the time.
🎧 Oh, really?
🎧 Someone you met in the bank?
🎧 Does he work there?
🎧 No, he was a tourist, from New York.
🎧 His name's Henry,
🎧 and he's been here for a week, but he's moving on to Germany tomorrow.
🎧 He's an architect,
🎧 and he's spending four weeks travelling around Europe.
🎧 Just like us!
🎧 Yeah, just like us.
🎧 He told me the names of some places where we should eat.
🎧 Great food, and not too expensive, he said.
🎧 Oh, and he also gave me this map of the bus system.
🎧 He said he didn't need it any more.
🎧 That's useful.
🎧 Pity he's moving on tomorrow.
🎧 Ah, here's the waitress. Let's order.
🎧 Do you want anything to eat, or shall we just have a drink?
🎧 Well, I'm hungry,
🎧 and we've got a lot of sightseeing to do, so let's just have a snack and a drink.
🎧 Sounds good to me!
🎧 Well, let's decide what we'll see today.
🎧 I guess the best place to start is the Cathedral,
🎧 and then the Castle.
🎧 What are the opening times for those two?
🎧 Well, according to this guidebook,
🎧 the Cathedral is only open from 9:30 in the morning until midday.
🎧 No, hang on.
🎧 That's the Cathedral Museum.
🎧 The Cathedral itself is open morning and afternoon.
🎧 The Castle is just open from one to five,
🎧 so we can't go there until after lunch.
🎧 I really want to spend some time in the Art Gallery,
🎧 because they've got this wonderful painting by Rembrandt that I've always wanted to see.
🎧 What else should we see?
🎧 Well, the guidebook says the Botanical Gardens are worth spending some time in,
🎧 and they're open all day, from eight to six, so we can go there any time.
🎧 I'd like to go to the Markets near the river too, but...
🎧 oh... no, wait, that's only in the mornings, too.
🎧 As well as today and tomorrow, we can see some other places on Monday, you know.
🎧 But I don't think the Markets will be open then: they only open on Thursdays,
🎧 so we've missed them for this week.
🎧 Maybe we should go to the Cathedral today
🎧 because it's Sunday tomorrow, and even though it's open every day,
🎧 it might be more difficult to get in tomorrow because of the church services.
🎧 That's true,
🎧 but the Art Gallery isn't open on Sundays at all,
🎧 so we'll have to go there today.
🎧 The Castle's open every day except Mondays, so we're okay there,
🎧 and the Gardens of course only close at night.
🎧 Are all these places free or do we have to pay to go in?
🎧 What does the guidebook say?
🎧 I think there's a charge for all of them except the Botanical Gardens.
🎧 Oh, and the Markets, of course you don't pay to go in.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 Well, it looks like our plan is this:
🎧 we'll go to see the painting you like first, the Rembrandt,
🎧 then have lunch and go on to the Castle after that, and then the Cathedral.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 It says here that the roof of the Cathedral is really beautiful.
🎧 Is that right?
🎧 What I really want to do at the Cathedral is climb the tower.
🎧 The view is supposed to be spectacular.
🎧 Okay, well, that'll be more than enough for today.
🎧 Then, tomorrow, let's go to the Botanical Gardens and have a picnic.
🎧 I want to sit by the river and watch the swans.
🎧 This city's famous for them.

[022] Cam4 - Test 2 - Part 2

🎧 So the counselling services we offer deal with any problems arising from your studies,
🎧 or in your life outside the university.
🎧 Let's take academic counselling.
🎧 If you're confused about subjects or how to combine them in your degree,
🎧 then we can advise you and discuss the career you are aiming for,
🎧 so that you can see it all in context.
🎧 We can also chase up your tutor if you're not getting proper feedback on how you are getting on in your subject.
🎧 Besides help with academic problems,
🎧 you may also need personal counselling:
🎧 if you think you're already under stress,
🎧 well, just wait till classes begin next week.
🎧 You'll have to start adjusting to teaching and learning methods that may be unfamiliar to you,
🎧 as well as the mounting pressure as the deadline for that first assignment creeps up on you.
🎧 And of course, you have to cope with all this without your usual social network -
🎧 you know, the social contacts, family and friends you could normally rely on for help.
🎧 All of this causes anxiety.
🎧 Studying overseas can trigger a personal crisis -
🎧 you may have left a lot of what you might call 'unfinished business' back in your own country,
🎧 or you may have interrupted personal relationships
🎧 or even sometimes have broken them off to come overseas,
🎧 and so the student often feels lonely, unhappy, unmotivated
🎧 and unable to concentrate on studying.
🎧 Or there may be other things bothering you.
🎧 Our resident chaplain can offer you spiritual guidance if that's what you want,
🎧 or we can put you in touch with community groups that can provide you with social contacts and friendship.
🎧 What about exam stress?
🎧 It affects nearly everyone to some extent,
🎧 but especially overseas students like yourselves.
🎧 There may be a huge amount of family pressure on you to succeed,
🎧 and if you fail a subject or drop out of a course because it's too difficult
🎧 then your self-esteem can suffer.
🎧 But it's not the end of the world if you don't pass an exam -
🎧 I had to resit First Year Anthropology, so I can certainly offer you a sympathetic ear!
🎧 Anyway, exam failure can lead to worrying changes in the way you normally behave.
🎧 You may also be off your food,
🎧 or you may have dietary problems
🎧 because the local food is not to your liking and upsets you,
🎧 and this can affect your health and studies.
🎧 Glenda Roberts is our dietician in the Health Service
🎧 and we can put you on to her.
🎧 And we all have money problems, don't we?
🎧 But remember, full-time students can get a low-interest loan of up to six hundred dollars to buy books
🎧 and for similar study-related expenses.
🎧 That's right,
🎧 and you can get double that amount if you can't afford an item of equipment you need for your course -
🎧 a musical instrument, for example.
🎧 And it doesn't stop there.
🎧 When you move into a flat,
🎧 starting-up expenses, including furniture for it,
🎧 can be covered by a loan through the Welfare Service.
🎧 See Jill Freeman for details.
🎧 Can we help you?
🎧 Well, last academic year, in spite of staff cuts,
🎧 we counselled 240 international students for a total of 2600 hours counselling,
🎧 and, finally we won all but just 1 of the 12 appeals that we launched on behalf of students.
🎧 Not too bad for an understaffed service, don't you think?
🎧 That's all from me.
🎧 Thank you.

[023] Cam4 - Test 2 - Part 3

🎧 Oh, there you are, good.
🎧 Sorry, I'm a bit late - there was a long queue.
🎧 So, have you worked out how to deal with this assignment then?
🎧 Not yet, we've only been here a couple of minutes ourselves.
🎧 Can you just remind me what the task is exactly?
🎧 Well, there are two, no, three, parts to it:
🎧 first, we've got to write an essay about ways of collecting data.
🎧 What's the title of the essay exactly?
🎧 I've got it here:
🎧 'Assess the two main methods of collecting data in social science research'.
🎧 And how much do we need to write?
🎧 Fifteen hundred words.
🎧 That's for the essay.
🎧 Then, for the second part of the assignment, we have to choose one method of data collection,
🎧 and 'carry out a small-scale study',
🎧 'making appropriate use of the method chosen to gather data from at least five subjects'.
🎧 And then we have to write a report on the study?
🎧 That's right, of three to four thousand words.
🎧 Did you get as far as discussing which form of data collection we should go for -
🎧 questionnaire or interview, isn't it?
🎧 Yeah, I think we should use a questionnaire.
🎧 It'll be so much less time-consuming than organising interviews, I reckon.
🎧 Once we've agreed on the wording of it, we only have to send it out and wait for the responses.
🎧 Yes, I think it probably would be quicker.
🎧 But what did that article he gave us last week say about the quality of data from questionnaires?
🎧 I'm pretty sure it recommended questionnaires as a source of 'highly reliable data'.
🎧 As long as you design the questionnaire properly in the first place, the data will be fine.
🎧 No, I'm sure it talked about drawbacks as well, didn't it?
🎧 Something about the response rate and the problems you get if it's too low.
🎧 Yeah, but we only need data from five subjects anyway.
🎧 I suppose so.
🎧 Another drawback I remember it mentioned was that
🎧 questionnaire data tends not to reveal anything unexpected, because...
🎧 it is limited to the questions fixed in advance by the researcher.
🎧 Come on, Rosa. This is only a practice.
🎧 It's not meant to be real research, is it?
🎧 Well, not sure about that.
🎧 Maybe I'd better go through the article again, just to be sure.
🎧 Can you remember what it was called?
🎧 Sample Surveys in Social Science Research', I think.
🎧 By Mehta.
🎧 MEHTA?
🎧 Yeah.
🎧 And he also recommended a more recent book, called...
🎧 'Survey Research', by Bell, I think.
🎧 It's in that series published by London University.
🎧 And if we tried to use interviews instead,
🎧 I saw a book in the departmental library that'll be helpful: it's called 'Interviews That Work',
🎧 by Wilson, published in Oxford in 1988.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Oh, I've got a tutorial now.
🎧 Can we meet up again later this week?
🎧 What about Friday morning?
🎧 Suits me. 11 o'clock?
🎧 Fine.
🎧 Before Friday, I think we should all look through the reading list.

[024] Cam4 - Test 2 - Part 4

🎧 So far, in these lectures, we've been looking at crimes like robbery and murder -
🎧 both from a historical viewpoint and also in contemporary society -
🎧 and we've seen that the preoccupation in Western society with crime and with lawlessness
🎧 is part of a long and continuous tradition,
🎧 rather than something which is new and unique to modern society.
🎧 But over the past seventy years or so, there has been a massive increase in one type of crime,
🎧 which is what's known as 'corporate crime'.
🎧 Corporate crime is crime which, as the name suggests,
🎧 is connected with companies, with business organisations.
🎧 It includes illegal acts of either individuals or a group within the company,
🎧 but what is important is that these acts are normally in accordance with the goals of the company -
🎧 they're for the good of the company rather than the individual.
🎧 It's been defined as,
🎧 quote, 'crime which is committed for the corporate organisation' - the company - 'not against it', unquote.
🎧 So crimes like theft by employees -
🎧 things like embezzlement or fraud against one's actual employer are excluded according to this definition.
🎧 The employees may be involved
🎧 but they're acting in the first place for the company -
🎧 they may not even realise they're committing a crime
🎧 or they may realise but they feel it's excusable because it's policy,
🎧 or because otherwise they may lose their jobs.
🎧 So here, really, we're talking about the links between power and crime.
🎧 Now, this is one area that much less is generally known about than conventional or traditional crime.
🎧 It has been relatively ignored by the mass media -
🎧 for example, it tends to be under-reported in comparison with conventional crime in news broadcasts,
🎧 and in crime serials and films and so on -
🎧 they very rarely deal with corporate crime.
🎧 And it also tends to be ignored in academic circles -
🎧 there's been far more research on conventional crime and far more data is available.
🎧 There are several reasons for this lack of interest in corporate crime, compared with other types of crime.
🎧 It's often very complex,
🎧 whereas with conventional crime, it's usually possible to follow what's going on without specialist knowledge.
🎧 As well as this, whereas conventional crime usually has a lot of human interest,
🎧 corporate crime often has much less.
🎧 The third reason, and possibly the most significant one,
🎧 is that very often the victims are unaware -
🎧 they think their misfortune is an accident
🎧 or that it's the fault of no-one in particular.
🎧 They're unaware that they've been victims of a crime.
🎧 So, when we look at the effects of corporate crime,
🎧 we may find it's very difficult to assess the costs.
🎧 But these costs can be very considerable in both their economic and social aspects.
🎧 Let's look at the economic costs first.
🎧 For example, if a company is producing fruit juice
🎧 and it dilutes its product so that it's just a little below the concentration it should be,
🎧 many millions of people may be paying a small amount extra for their carton of orange juice.
🎧 Now small amounts like this may seem insignificant for individual customers -
🎧 too small to worry about -
🎧 but for the company, this deception might result in massive illegal profit.
🎧 However, all studies of corporate crime agree
🎧 that the individuals are in fact deprived of far more money by such crime
🎧 than they are by conventional crime like robbery and theft.
🎧 In addition to this, we have to consider the social costs of corporate crime
🎧 and these are again very difficult to assess, but they are considerable.
🎧 They're important because they can undermine the faith of the public in the business world
🎧 and also, more importantly,
🎧 because the main group of people they affect are, in fact, not the richer sections of society but the poorer.
🎧 So here companies are robbing the poor to benefit the rich.
🎧 There are two more points to do with corporate crime
🎧 that I'd like to illustrate with reference to a specific event
🎧 which occurred several years ago.
🎧 This was an explosion of a large oil tanker
🎧 which caused the loss of more than fifty lives of the crew.
🎧 It was an explosion which never should have happened
🎧 and a subsequent inquiry laid the blame not on anyone who had actually been on the tanker at the time,
🎧 but on the owners of the tanker.
🎧 They had deliberately decided not to carry out necessary repair work on the tanker as it was due to be sold,
🎧 and it was this lack of repair work which was directly responsible for the explosion.
🎧 Now this illustrates two points to do with corporate crime.
🎧 First of all, that it does not have to be intentional.
🎧 The owners of the tanker certainly did not intend it to explode.
🎧 But very serious consequences can result from people or organisations
🎧 not considering the possible results of their actions seriously enough.
🎧 The main crime here was indifference to the human results
🎧 rather than actual intention to harm anyone,
🎧 but that didn't make the results any less tragic.
🎧 And this leads me to my second point
🎧 that corporate crime can have very severe consequences.
🎧 It's not just a matter of companies making bigger profits than they should do,
🎧 but of events which may affect the lives of innocent people,
🎧 and yet very often, companies, because they say they didn't intend to harm anyone,
🎧 can avoid taking responsibility for the results of their actions.
🎧 And that has been a very dangerous loophole in the law.
🎧 A further example of corporate crime was...
