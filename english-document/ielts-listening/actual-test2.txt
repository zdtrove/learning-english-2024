🎧 Okay Mary, I know I'm putting on weight with all my bad eating habits.
🎧 That's right. Chocolate bars, pizzas, and all washed down with litres of soft drink.
🎧 And with all the sugar in soft drink,
🎧 I think we can say you're definitely overindulging, don't you think?
🎧 I know, I know.
🎧 I intend to definitely stop drinking that from now on.
🎧 And that's part of the sensible eating plan that we have agreed we need to formulate -
🎧 one that we can both follow.
🎧 That's right, sensible, and practical -
🎧 allowing us to indulge in some sweet foods on occasions.
🎧 On rare occasions,
🎧 and we're going to cut out all the pizzas and hamburgers.
🎧 Well, not totally.
🎧 I thought you said pizzas could be eaten once a week.
🎧 You know how I like pizzas.
🎧 No. I said once every two months.
🎧 Once a week was ice cream, not pizza.
🎧 Yeah, that's because you like ice cream.
🎧 I prefer pizza.
🎧 Peter, if you want to lose weight, you need to be disciplined,
🎧 in both what you eat, and what you do,
🎧 which brings us to the issue of exercise.
🎧 That's right.
🎧 So, jogging twice a week, and hiking on Saturdays, right?
🎧 No, hiking is Sundays,
🎧 allowing Saturdays for the light walking exercise.
🎧 I've investigated, and discovered there are a lot of walking trails around this suburb,
🎧 with many beautiful places if you just look around.
🎧 So what's happening this Saturday?
🎧 A walk around the city?
🎧 That's later in the month.
🎧 This Saturday we'll visit Pine Park.
🎧 Hill Park is nicer, with great views, too.
🎧 Yes, but we have to travel too far to reach Hill Park,
🎧 so I ruled that out, and I love the smell of pines.
🎧 And what about the weekday meals?
🎧 Salads every night, I suppose?
🎧 No, it's important to vary the meals so that the food remains interesting and fun.
🎧 The only common factor is the fruit juice,
🎧 but otherwise we'll have a variety of healthy fare,
🎧 from salads, to fish, to lean meat.
🎧 I'd rather have meat every night, but you're the boss.
🎧 If you want to lose weight, you'll have to accept this program, okay?
🎧 Okay.
🎧 Now Mary, you said we could have a little treat in our diet plan three times a week:
🎧 specifically, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays.
🎧 Yes. A very small treat, but something to reward us for all the discipline shown.
🎧 Such rewards will motivate us to continue the diet.
🎧 So, on Tuesdays, what can I choose?
🎧 You have a choice between a small serving of chocolate, ice cream, or biscuits.
🎧 Okay, well, I'll go for the biscuits.
🎧 I love those crunchy little things with my cup of tea.
🎧 So do you, right?
🎧 I do indeed, so I'll have them, too, saving the ice cream for later.
🎧 But I know how much you like ice cream,
🎧 so why don't you save it for the end of the week?
🎧 That will give you the motivation to keep going,
🎧 and you can have chocolate midweek?
🎧 That's a good idea,
🎧 but I think the most important thing is for you and I to eat different things on those other two days.
🎧 Well, if you think that way,
🎧 I'll eat the ice cream on Thursdays, not the chocolate. Okay?
🎧 Well, if you're having that, then I can't have ice cream.
🎧 In order to be different, I'll have the chocolate.
🎧 So, we can compare our different snacks,
🎧 and maybe even share a little with each other.
🎧 Exactly! And the variety and fun involved will take our minds of wanting more.
🎧 Eating for fun! A good idea!
🎧 And then you can have the chocolate on Sunday, right?
🎧 But I like biscuits?
🎧 Actually, I want biscuits again - to have with my cup of tea.
🎧 But you have the biscuits on Monday, remember, and we can't repeat.
🎧 Ah come on! This isn't fixed in concrete.
🎧 I can have them again instead of chocolate.
🎧 You might like variety, but I don't.
🎧 I'm a creature of habit.
🎧 Well, the whole point of this was to taste different snacks,
🎧 but if you want the same thing, okay.
🎧 I, for one, am sticking to the original plan,
🎧 with ice cream to finish the week, and not another dose of chocolate.
🎧 
🎧 Hello everyone, and welcome to the Stanfield Childcare Centre.
🎧 Now I know you're all new mothers, and you like to cling to your children.
🎧 You've certainly spent a lot of time raising them to the age of four
🎧 and are perhaps reluctant to leave them here at our centre.
🎧 Well, one of the first things you should understand is that here it is safe - very safe.
🎧 Look around and you'll see that every room has padded walls.
🎧 Other centres have standard painted walls,
🎧 but here, we have invested a lot to ensure your children will not hurt themselves
🎧 when running around and possibly tripping over.
🎧 This padding extends around all corners
🎧 that is, the areas most likely to bruise and cut your active little child.
🎧 So, you can rest assured that any accidents of a physical nature are not likely to happen here.
🎧 Now, you don't want to dump your child at this centre and let them waste their time.
🎧 You want them to learn, and that's one of the greatest assets of our establishment.
🎧 Our staff are not only trained childcare workers,
🎧 but all of them have a special skill, which they can impart to your child,
🎧 whether it be teaching the ABC, some basic mathematics,
🎧 artistic skills, or physical education.
🎧 We are particularly known for our pre-school literacy program
🎧 and have a wealth of learning toys, specially designed to develop your child's potential.
🎧 Of course, one concern many mothers have is that,
🎧 in environments such as these,
🎧 colds and flus and other viral nasties can be easily spread around.
🎧 It's a very legitimate concern,
🎧 and one which we take seriously,
🎧 and we pride ourselves on our precautions.
🎧 For a start, unlike most centres which clean with standard detergents,
🎧 we disinfect every surface at the end of every day,
🎧 using a special disinfectant wash.
🎧 Some places just wipe surfaces daily with a damp cloth,
🎧 but not us. And that's just the start.
🎧 We also physically check your children when they arrive every day,
🎧 and if we feel your child is sick,
🎧 we ask him or her to wear a face mask to ensure germs are not transmitted.
🎧 If your child is noticeably sick, then we ask you to take them back home to recover.
🎧 This might sound a little unkind,
🎧 but we hope parents can understand that these measures are for the benefit of all.
🎧 Now, at Stanfield Childcare Centre we have excellent childcare officers,
🎧 and let me briefly introduce them.
🎧 We have Susan, Andrea, Bella, Cathy, Lisa, and Liz.
🎧 They're all fully trained and come with some individual assets which make them even better.
🎧 Bella, for instance, knows children very well, having worked here for five years,
🎧 and Cathy has her own family - two little girls
🎧 so she can talk to you with first-hand knowledge of what it's really like to raise children.
🎧 But getting back to Bella, she often relaxes here after work,
🎧 spending long hours chatting to parents, as does Cathy in fact.
🎧 But in terms of hours, nothing can compare to Andrea,
🎧 who will sometimes spend the night here, staying in our overnight room.
🎧 Why? Because this centre is very friendly, and simply a great place to be.
🎧 Bella, for example, used to be quite shy herself
🎧 but now is marvelous with the little kiddies, as outgoing as any of them.
🎧 We let Cathy, though, deal with the particularly quiet and introverted children,
🎧 since having her own family, she knows what can really bring them out.
🎧 Of course, what better way to do this than with yummie homemade cakes,
🎧 and Cathy often gets these from Bella, who can make some of the best in town.
🎧 Yes, everyone here brings something special,
🎧 which is why we're one of the best childcare centres in the business.
🎧 
🎧 Hi, Ms Harris. Here we are, talking once again.
🎧 Well, I'm always willing to help out wherever possible.
🎧 Is anything troubling you?
🎧 Well, your advice last week about writing summaries was very useful,
🎧 and I'm using these summaries a lot in order to prepare my final master's thesis.
🎧 But you're having problems, right?
🎧 Yes, I have a few issues to discuss.
🎧 Obviously I want a good essay, and I want to achieve high marks.
🎧 But I'm not sure on the best way to start.
🎧 That's an easy question.
🎧 Start with a topic, but not one that I necessarily suggest,
🎧 but one that you want to explore.
🎧 You'll always write better when doing so on a topic you're interested in,
🎧 not one imposed upon you by others.
🎧 Well, I'm interested in management theory.
🎧 Then pursue that.
🎧 However, that alone is far too broad.
🎧 Break it into various current areas of discussion and relevance,
🎧 then look more carefully at one of them -
🎧 say, management and cultural differences,
🎧 or management and motivation,
🎧 or other aspects, such as the role of salary, group cohesion, or leadership.
🎧 I would say I'm interested in group cohesion,
🎧 that is, how people interact in the workplace.
🎧 Well, that's a start,
🎧 but you can't then just write planlessly,
🎧 without defining exactly what you intend to do within the area you've chosen.
🎧 You'll have to think of a thesis, and this statement could be of several types.
🎧 Such as what?
🎧 Oh, you could argue a point, something that you believe in;
🎧 or discuss an issue, looking at its various perspectives;
🎧 or critique the opinions of others, pointing out the pitfalls and flaws.
🎧 The thesis statement will make that very clear because it will say,
🎧 in simple terms, what you intend to achieve in your essay.
🎧 I see. And then I can just begin writing, right?
🎧 Wrong!
🎧 If your essay is going to be clear, it needs to be logical and organised,
🎧 and this means you'll need an outline.
🎧 This could be written as a flowchart, or spider graph,
🎧 that is, a series of connected lines,
🎧 but whatever shape the outline takes,
🎧 there must be a sense of progress, in, more or less, a straight line, towards a goal.
🎧 And then my essay will be good?
🎧 With such progression, definitely
🎧 as long as you do achieve everything that you set out to do,
🎧 as specified in the beginning, okay?
🎧 Well, Ms Harris, your advice about essay writing all sounds very useful:
🎧 solid, and step by step, so I'll certainly follow that.
🎧 But can you tell me in more general terms,
🎧 what constitutes the best essay?
🎧 Oh, there are many aspects to consider,
🎧 but one of the most important is certainly, original thinking.
🎧 The best essays are written by people who think for themselves,
🎧 and not just copy or imitate established views.
🎧 I think I can do that.
🎧 But remember, you can't just give a list of unsupported assertions.
🎧 There needs to be support as well -
🎧 a chain of logic linking each step in your argument.
🎧 Right!
🎧 Yet that alone is not enough.
🎧 Your argument may be logically sound, but is it practically so?
🎧 For that, you need examples, from real-life, to illustrate your points or sub-points.
🎧 I've got lots of examples from my course readings.
🎧 I suppose I could use them.
🎧 But remember, whenever you use an example,
🎧 or facts or figures that are not commonly known,
🎧 you must give a reference.
🎧 That's an academic necessity, without which your writing will automatically fail.
🎧 So, it's necessary to give these. Right.
🎧 Absolutely! And with that, your essay will be fine,
🎧 but always ensure that you format it clearly.
🎧 What do you mean?
🎧 I mean the practical considerations,
🎧 as written in the university style guide,
🎧 such as leaving appropriate margins,
🎧 using double spacing, Arial font, and so on.
🎧 You see, your writing must look good, as well as be good.
🎧 I can certainly do that.
🎧 And, finally, related to the previous point,
🎧 you need to respect the number of words required.
🎧 Your individual lecturers will give you a word-count figure,
🎧 so follow what they say, making your essay neither too long, nor too short,
🎧 perhaps 10% either way should be acceptable.
🎧 15% was common when I was younger,
🎧 but it's a lot stricter now,
🎧 and 20% would be pushing the boundaries just a little too far.
🎧 I guess I can do all that. Thanks for your advice.
🎧 
🎧 In the night sky, the stars appear to revolve around the Earth,
🎧 rising in the east, and disappearing in the west.
🎧 The Earth itself seems solid, fixed, and stable,
🎧 and such common sense perception suggests that the Earth is the centre of the universe.
🎧 This is known as "geocentrism", with geo meaning Earth,
🎧 and all pre-modern civilisations drew this conclusion.
🎧 We now know, of course, that the Earth revolves around the sun,
🎧 and this is called "heliocentrism", with helio meaning sun,
🎧 but historically, it took quite a while for this to be deduced.
🎧 As early as the third century BC,
🎧 an ancient Greek astronomer, Aristarchus of Samos,
🎧 proposed heliocentrism, but received little support from his peers.
🎧 Similarly, throughout subsequent history, isolated individuals proposed this new idea,
🎧 but again, no one was listening.
🎧 Geocentrism just seemed too logical to refute.
🎧 Geocentrism also fitted the views of the established Christian church,
🎧 who could quote biblical passages such as 'the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved'.
🎧 Those who dared to disagree were subject to accusations of heresy
🎧 often with dire punishments to follow.
🎧 The trouble was, as the night sky was observed more closely,
🎧 that simple revolution of the stars proved not so simple at all.
🎧 In relation to the other stars, some steadily wandered in given directions,
🎧 then sometimes reversed for months, and disappeared altogether.
🎧 They were called planets, meaning 'wanderers'.
🎧 In addition, the position of the sun and moon altered slightly over the year,
🎧 and comets, those mysterious glowing spots, would come and go.
🎧 In order to predict the motion of the planets,
🎧 and accurately serve the primary purpose of navigation for sailing ships,
🎧 increasingly elaborate mathematical models were needed -
🎧 a sure sign that something was not quite right.
🎧 Heliocentrism, or the belief that the sun is the centre of the solar system,
🎧 still needed a mathematically-sound description before it could be scientifically accepted,
🎧 and it was a Polish astronomer, Nicolaus Copernicus,
🎧 who, in 1543, first published this.
🎧 This event is sometimes referred to as the Copernican revolution.
🎧 Copernicus himself certainly feared the consequences of his proof,
🎧 knowing full well it might invoke the anger of the established church.
🎧 Probably for this reason, he waited until the last year of his life,
🎧 when he was sick and dying, to release his findings.
🎧 In addition, the preface of the book,
🎧 written by a respected member of the church,
🎧 stated that the model was not necessarily correct.
🎧 As a result of this, there was no "revolution" whatsoever,
🎧 in fact, the book received scant attention in the subsequent decades,
🎧 apart from a few irate clergy men who angrily dismissed the whole scheme as irrelevant.
🎧 Yet the following generations of astronomers did not always fare so well.
🎧 The Italian scientist, Galileo, got into trouble,
🎧 as did a fellow Italian, with the surname Bruno, Giordono Bruno,
🎧 who was burnt at the stake,
🎧 yet ultimately, nothing could slow the spread of heliocentrism across Europe.
🎧 It formed the basis of Isaac Newton's great work on the motion of the planets,
🎧 a work which implied that even the sun, around which the Earth circled,
🎧 was itself in motion around a common centre of gravity.
🎧 No discourse about heliocentrism could finish without mentioning that,
🎧 somewhat unbelievably, there still exists those today who choose to believe that the Earth is the centre of the universe.
🎧 Modern geocentrism is usually the result of literal interpretations of the Bible,
🎧 which is the cornerstone of these people's beliefs.
🎧 They, therefore, also believe in creationism,
🎧 that is, that a God created everything,
🎧 and while we may smile at this,
🎧 it is sobering to consider that surveys have revealed that up to 10% of British people,
🎧 12% of Europeans. 20% of the USA,
🎧 and 25% of the Middle East,
🎧 still hold the belief that the sun revolves around the Earth.
🎧 One can only wonder what Copernicus would have thought of this.
