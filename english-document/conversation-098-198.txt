[098] Going to the Zoo

🎧 Hey Steve. My family and I want to do something fun this weekend? Do you have any suggestions?
🎧 The weather is going to be nice. You should do something outdoors.
🎧 Yeah, it's supposed to be sunny all weekend.
🎧 How about a picnic at the park?
🎧 We do that often. I want to do something more fun.
🎧 How about the city zoo? I heard that bear cubs were recently born there.
🎧 That's a good idea. We haven't been to the zoo in a long time.
🎧 Then you should definitely go this weekend.
🎧 The last time we were there, it started raining. None of the animals wanted to come out.
🎧 That must've been boring.
🎧 It was boring. The kids wanted to go home early.
🎧 The animals should be more visible since the weather is going to be sunny this weekend.
🎧 Yeah. I think we will go to the zoo. Hopefully, this time it'll be more fun.
🎧 Actually, I have four tickets to the zoo. You can have them. Our family won't be able to go. The tickets expire this weekend.
🎧 Thanks, Steve! Let me pay you for them. Zoo tickets are expensive.
🎧 Don't worry about it. It's my gift to you since your last visit was not fun.
🎧 Are you sure! This is very generous of you.
🎧 Also, you mowed my lawn a few times after I had back surgery last year. I really appreciated that.
🎧 I'm glad we're neighbors.
 
[099] Going to the Beach
 
🎧 Carl. Are you going to watch television all day?
🎧 No. Is there something you want to do?
🎧 It's a beautiful day. The sun is shining. We should do something outdoors.
🎧 Ok. What should we do?
🎧 Let's go to the beach.
🎧 OK. I'll grab the beach chairs and towels.
🎧 Great! I'll pack some snacks and drinks. Don't forget the sunscreen.
🎧 Where is it?
🎧 It's in the bathroom cabinet.
🎧 Is there anything else we need to bring?
🎧 I'll bring the camera. I want to take pictures of the sunset.
🎧 Good idea! The sunset is beautiful at the beach.
🎧 Do you remember the last time we went to the beach?
🎧 No. It's been a long time. Why don't we go more often?
🎧 Because you're always watching TV.
🎧 Ok. Let's go to the beach when the weather is nice and watch TV when it rains.
🎧 That's a deal!
 
[100] Going to the Amusement Park
 
🎧 Hi Sheila. Have you been to the new amusement park yet?
🎧 No. When did it open?
🎧 Last weekend.
🎧 Was it crowded?
🎧 It was very crowded. Parking is terrible too.
🎧 Did you have fun?
🎧 Oh yes! The roller coasters are really fun. My kids had a great time. It was even fun for the adults too.
🎧 I didn't know it was open yet. I will have to take my son soon.
🎧 You should. They will love it.
🎧 Are the tickets expensive?
🎧 Yeah, they're pretty expensive. But your family will enjoy it.
🎧 Maybe we'll go this weekend. We don't have any plans on Saturday. My son has been asking about it.
🎧 If you go on Saturday, try to go early. There aren't enough parking spots. They need to add more.
🎧 Ok. That's good to know. Do you have any other tips?
🎧 The lines for the rides are very long, so be patient.
🎧 Ok. I assumed that. Now I have to convince my husband to go.
🎧 He doesn't like amusement parks?
🎧 No. I have motion sickness, so I can't ride any of the roller coasters. That means my husband has to ride all of them with our son.
🎧 Tell him to be prepared. There are a lot of roller coasters.
 
[101] Afternoon Picnic
 
🎧 Mom, can we have a picnic this afternoon?
🎧 Sure, Cathy. Where should we have it?
🎧 How about the lake?
🎧 That's a great idea.
🎧 What should we pack for lunch?
🎧 I can make ham sandwiches and potato salad.
🎧 Yummy. I love ham sandwiches and potato salad.
🎧 Tell your sisters about the picnic.
🎧 Ok. I think it is going to get hot later today.
🎧 That's good. It will be a good day for a swim in the lake.
🎧 I'll tell Cindy and Alison to wear their swimsuits.
🎧 Don't forget to pack your life jackets too.
🎧 Ok. Will Andy be joining us?
🎧 Of course, your brother will be joining us. Where is he?
🎧 He's taking a nap on the couch.
🎧 Let's wake him up.
🎧 You can wake him up. I'll get my sisters.
🎧 Andy, wake up. We're going to the lake.
 
[102] Picnic by the Lake
 
🎧 Hi Mike. What are you doing today?
🎧 Hi Joe. My family and I are going to the lake. We're going to have picnic.
🎧 That sounds like fun.
🎧 Do you want to join us?
🎧 May I? I would love to join.
🎧 Sure. We are leaving at 10:30.
🎧 Ok. Let me ask my parents. What should I bring?
🎧 You should pack swim trunks and a life jacket.
🎧 Ok. How about food?
🎧 My parents are going to pack some food. There will be plenty for you too.
🎧 Thanks. I'll be back as soon as possible.
🎧 Try to come back before 10:30.
🎧 I will. If I can't go, I will call you.
🎧 I hope you can come with us.
🎧 Me too. I have no plans today.
🎧 See you soon.
🎧 I hope so!
 
[103] Going to the Lake
 
🎧 Dad, what are we doing today?
🎧 Cathy, it's a surprise.
🎧 Is it a special occasion?
🎧 No. Just a short family trip.
🎧 Does Mom know?
🎧 Of course. It was her idea.
🎧 Where is Mom?
🎧 She is at the store getting things for our trip.
🎧 I'm so curious. Can you please tell me?
🎧 No. You have to be patient.
🎧 Ok. Can I help you with anything?
🎧 Sure. Why don't you pack your swimsuit and life jacket?
🎧 I know what we're doing!
🎧 You do?
🎧 Yes. We're going to the lake!
🎧 How did you know?
🎧 You asked me to pack a swimsuit and a life jacket. Also, you are pulling out the canoe from the garage.
🎧 It looks like I can't keep a secret.
 
[104] Fishing with Dad
 
🎧 Dad, what are we doing this weekend?
🎧 I have a surprise for you, Timothy.
🎧 What is it?
🎧 Here. Open it.
🎧 I think I know what it is?
🎧 Can you tell by the shape?
🎧 Yeah. Is it a fishing pole?
🎧 Well, open it up and find out.
🎧 It is! I love it. I've never gone fishing before.
🎧 Your grandfather and I used to go fishing when I was a child. Now, I can take you.
🎧 I can't wait!
🎧 You also need a life jacket.
🎧 Why?
🎧 You should always wear a life jacket if you're going in a boat.
🎧 Ok, dad.
🎧 Now let's go to the fishing store and buy some bait.
🎧 What's bait?
🎧 Things that will attract the fish to the hook.
🎧 Like worms?
🎧 Exactly!
🎧 This is going to be so much fun!
 
[105] Fishing with Buddies
 
🎧 Hey Phil, I'm so glad it's Friday.
🎧 I agree, James. It was a stressful work week.
🎧 Have any fun plans this weekend?
🎧 Yeah, I'm going fishing with my buddies.
🎧 Lucky!
🎧 Do you want to join us?
🎧 I can't. I'm helping my brother move. He recently bought a house.
🎧 That's too bad. We're going to have beautiful weather too.
🎧 I'm glad we're going to have good weather. I don't want to move boxes and furniture in the rain.
🎧 That's true. When are you going to be done?
🎧 I don't know. He has a lot of stuff. It could be all day.
🎧 Well, if you get done early, why don't you meet us at the lake?
🎧 Are you going out on a boat?
🎧 No, we're going to fish on the lake shore. None of us have a boat.
🎧 My brother has a boat. I can ask him if we can borrow it sometime.
🎧 That would be awesome! Thanks!
🎧 Well, I'm going to head home now. I'm tired.
🎧 Yeah. Me too. Call me this weekend if you get done early.
 
[106] Talking about Fishing
 
🎧 Hey John! Did you see the fish Sam just caught?
🎧 No. What did he catch? How big was it?
🎧 A 20 pound salmon.
🎧 Wow! I've been here all day and have caught nothing. Have you caught anything?
🎧 Yeah, just a couple of small trout.
🎧 That's better than me. I just want to give up and go home.
🎧 Don't give up. You might catch something soon.
🎧 My wife told me to bring home dinner.
🎧 Fish?
🎧 Yeah. I may have to go to the market and buy one.
🎧 That's silly. Just wait.
🎧 The sun is starting to set and I'm tired of being out here.
🎧 At least it didn't rain today. We had clear skies all day.
🎧 That's true. It was nice today. Hey, can you hold my fishing pole? I need to go to the restroom.
🎧 Sure. Wait, John!
🎧 Steve, what?
🎧 Something is pulling on your fishing pole! Here, grab it!
🎧 Wow! That's a huge salmon!
🎧 I told you to be patient and you would catch something.
🎧 Now I can take home dinner. Want to come over and have salmon with us?
 
[107] Hiking Injury
 
🎧 Hey Joe. What happened to your ankle?
🎧 Hey Kevin. I broke it while hiking last weekend.
🎧 That's terrible. How?
🎧 We were hiking down a steep trail. I lost my balance and fell.
🎧 Ouch!
🎧 Yeah, it hurt badly.
🎧 How did you get back to your car?
🎧 It was a long, painful walk.
🎧 Were you alone?
🎧 No, I was with my wife. But I'm too heavy for her to carry me.
🎧 Why didn't you call someone?
🎧 There was no cell phone coverage in that area.
🎧 How long do you have to wear your cast?
🎧 Six weeks.
🎧 Six weeks? Are you going to miss the marathon next month?
🎧 Yeah! Looks like I am. I'm so disappointed. I've been training for that for a year. Why don't you go in my place?
🎧 No, thanks. Do you know what I hate more than hiking?
🎧 What?
🎧 Marathons!
 
[108] Hiking for Beginners
 
🎧 Hey Sue. What are you doing this weekend?
🎧 Hi Sandy. I'm going hiking with some friends. Do you want join?
🎧 No, that's ok. I've never gone hiking before.
🎧 Really? It's a lot of fun and great exercise.
🎧 It sounds fun and good for you.
🎧 It is. You should come.
🎧 I don't even have the correct shoes.
🎧 I have an extra pair. What size do you wear?
🎧 I wear a size 7.
🎧 What a coincidence! Me too!
🎧 What else do I need?
🎧 Comfortable clothes, a jacket, a water bottle, snacks, a flashlight, and a map.
🎧 Wow! That's a lot of stuff to bring.
🎧 Do you have a small backpack to put these items in?
🎧 Yeah.
🎧 Well then, you are ready to go.
🎧 How long are you going to be hiking?
🎧 We usually hike about 10 miles, but this weekend we're going to hike a much shorter distance.
🎧 Why?
🎧 My friend is bringing her sister. She has never gone hiking before either. So, it'll be a fun experience for the both of you.
 
[109] Borrowing Things from a Friend
 
🎧 Hello?
🎧 Mike. This is Dan. Do you have a lantern I can borrow?
🎧 I think so. I have to check.
🎧 Our lantern is broken.
🎧 What do you need a lantern for?
🎧 We are going camping this weekend.
🎧 We went camping last month.
🎧 How was the weather last month?
🎧 It was great! Sunny all weekend.
🎧 I think it is going to rain this weekend.
🎧 That's not good. Why are you going camping if it's going to rain?
🎧 The kids still want to go.
🎧 I'm sure you will still have fun.
🎧 I hope so. We're going to pack some extra clothes.
🎧 Let me check on that lantern.
🎧 Mike.
🎧 What's wrong, Dan?
🎧 Do you have a tent I can borrow?
🎧 Sure. Why?
🎧 I just discovered a hole in our tent.
 
[110] Family Camping
 
🎧 Susan, what should we do this weekend?
🎧 I don't know. What would you like to do?
🎧 Should we take the kids camping.
🎧 That sounds like a fun plan.
🎧 Do you know what the weather forecast for this weekend?
🎧 No. I have to check.
🎧 I think it is supposed to be sunny and clear.
🎧 That's perfect weather for camping.
🎧 We can go fishing too.
🎧 The kids are going to love it.
🎧 Let's not tell them yet.
🎧 Why?
🎧 I need to make a reservation. There may not be space available.
🎧 Oh yeah. We better think of another option just in case.
🎧 Yeah. How about going to the beach?
🎧 That would be fun too.
🎧 Let me try to make a reservation for camping first.
🎧 Ok. Here's the number.
 
[111] Going Fishing
 
🎧 Billy, are you all packed?
🎧 No, Dad. I can't find my fishing pole.
🎧 Where did you see it last?
🎧 In the garage. I'll look again.
🎧 Ok. I'm almost done packing too. I just need to load the tents into the car.
🎧 I found my fishing pole. It was behind the skis.
🎧 Good. What is your mom doing?
🎧 She is packing food and snacks into the ice chest.
🎧 Hopefully, we will catch some fish to eat too.
🎧 Yeah. Dad, where is your fishing pole?
🎧 I forgot it. Thanks for reminding me.
🎧 Are we going to the same campsite?
🎧 No. I want to try a new place.
🎧 Cool. Can I bring my camera?
🎧 Of course. But be careful not to lose it.
🎧 I'll be careful. I want to take a lot of pictures.
🎧 Make sure to take pictures of our fish.
🎧 I hope we catch big ones. I love camping and fishing.
🎧 I love spending time as a family.
 
[112] Looking for Airline Deals
 
🎧 Hi Carol. Have you seen any airline deals lately?
🎧 Hi Ruth. No, I haven't. Are you planning a trip?
🎧 Yeah. Stan and I want to visit our daughter in London. She moved there last year.
🎧 Why?
🎧 Her job was transferred there.
🎧 Does she like living there?
🎧 She loves living in England. She wants us to visit, but the airfare is very expensive.
🎧 Have you called any travel agencies? Sometimes they have special deals.
🎧 I've called travel agencies and looked online, but everything is expensive.
🎧 Yeah, airfare is getting more and more expensive every year.
🎧 I know. You travel a lot. Where do you buy your airplane tickets?
🎧 My traveling is for work. My company pays for the tickets.
🎧 That's nice.
🎧 Yeah. One of my business trips was to Hawaii. I got to fly in First Class.
🎧 That's amazing! We rarely travel by plane. I'd rather take the train.
🎧 Well, you can't take the train across the ocean.
🎧 I wish we could.
 
[113] Planning a Boat Trip
 
🎧 Hi Jane. Isn't it a beautiful day?
🎧 Hi Sarah. Yeah, it's sunny and clear. I think we're going to take our boat out.
🎧 It's a great day for it.
🎧 Would you and Paul like to join us?
🎧 I would love to. I need to ask Paul. He's at the store. He should be home in a few minutes.
🎧 Great! We can pack a lunch and eat on the boat.
🎧 Sounds like fun. I've never been on a boat before.
🎧 You haven't? Do you get seasick?
🎧 I've never been on a boat so I wouldn't know.
🎧 Do you get airsick? Do you have any kind of motion sickness?
🎧 I don't think so. I don't get sick on planes or trains or long car rides.
🎧 That's good. Then you'll probably be ok on the boat.
🎧 Are you really worried about me being seasick?
🎧 Yes and there is a reason why.
🎧 What is it?
🎧 Tom and I took my friend out on our boat once and she got very sick. I felt terrible for her.
🎧 Oh, I see. I should be ok.
🎧 What about Paul?
🎧 He used to be a fisherman. He is definitely not going to be seasick.
 
[114] Train Ride
 
🎧 What are you doing this weekend?
🎧 We're going to take the train to my mother's house.
🎧 That should be fun.
🎧 Yeah. We usually drive, but we decided to take the train this time.
🎧 Why?
🎧 My son loves trains, so I thought it would be a good idea to take the train up there.
🎧 Does he have a train set?
🎧 Oh yes. He has several trains and Jason built him a big wooden train track.
🎧 Then he's going to love this ride.
🎧 I know. We haven't told him yet. It's going to be a surprise.
🎧 I remember riding the train as a child. It was a lot of fun.
🎧 One of his toy trains looks just like the train we're going to take.
🎧 Make sure to take a picture of it.
🎧 That's a great idea. I'll frame it and hang it on his bedroom wall.
🎧 Have a great train ride!
 
[115] Lost Reservation
 
🎧 Mary, I am so angry!
🎧 What happened, Susan?
🎧 Our hotel lost our reservations?
🎧 How did that happen?
🎧 I don't know. They didn't have a reasonable explanation.
🎧 Well, can't you just make another reservation?
🎧 No. They said there are no more rooms available.
🎧 Oh no! That's terrible.
🎧 We are attending my niece's wedding this weekend and everyone is staying at that hotel.
🎧 What about another hotel in that area.
🎧 There's going to be a big doctor's conference this weekend. There are no rooms available at any of the nearby hotels.
🎧 Did the hotel apologize?
🎧 Yes and they offered us a discount on our next visit.
🎧 Did you accept it?
🎧 No. I was so mad. I told them that I would never stay at a place that lost our original reservations.
🎧 What did they say?
🎧 They just kept apologizing.
🎧 What are you going to do?
🎧 I don't know. My niece is very upset. Our daughter is the photographer.
 
[116] Great Hotel Experience
 
🎧 Hi Alice. How did you like the hotel?
🎧 It was lovely, Barbara. The rooms were spacious and clean.
🎧 Did you get a good deal on it?
🎧 Yeah. They had an online special. If you reserved a room three weeks early, you got 20% off the regular room rate.
🎧 That's a good deal.
🎧 The swimming pool and spa were really nice too. The swimming pool was warm. There was also a sauna.
🎧 Oh, that's very nice. Joe loves saunas. I need to tell him about this place.
🎧 The parking is free and so is the Wi-Fi.
🎧 That's good to know.
🎧 There's a shuttle bus that takes you to the downtown area where all of the shops and restaurants are. It was very convenient.
🎧 Anything else?
🎧 The concierge was very helpful and the front desk clerks were very nice.
🎧 Sounds like it was a wonderful place to stay.
🎧 It was. I would recommend this place to everyone.
🎧 Is there a restaurant in the hotel?
🎧 Yes. They have great food. It's a little expensive, but very delicious. They have a fantastic breakfast buffet every morning too.
🎧 Wow! I'm definitely going to make a reservation here.
🎧 I can't wait to go back.
 
[117] Bad Hotel Experience
 
🎧 How was the hotel?
🎧 It was awful. We had to switch rooms a couple of times.
🎧 Why?
🎧 Well, we found bugs in the carpet in one room. We had already unpacked. So, we had to re-pack everything and ask for another room.
🎧 What was wrong with the second room?
🎧 We paid for a garden room and it was a view of the parking lot.
🎧 That's terrible. Did you finally get a good room?
🎧 They were out of garden view rooms, so they upgraded us to an ocean view room.
🎧 That's nice! So, why was it so awful?
🎧 Our next door neighbor snored so loudly. He kept us awake every night.
🎧 Did you ask for another room?
🎧 Yes, but they said that there were no more rooms available.
🎧 I'm sorry you had a terrible time.
🎧 That's ok. The manager was really nice about it. He offered us a free stay next time.
🎧 Are you going to go back there?
🎧 Of course. It'll be free.
 
[118] New Friend at School
 
🎧 Jane, how was school today?
🎧 Mom, it was fun. I made a new friend.
🎧 That's nice. What's her name?
🎧 Her name is Cindy.
🎧 Is she new to your school?
🎧 Yeah, she's a new student. She moved here from Seattle, Washington.
🎧 You have an aunt who lives in Seattle.
🎧 I know. I like Seattle. It's beautiful there, but it rains too much.
🎧 Yeah. That's why we're staying in sunny California.
🎧 Cindy and I have a lot in common. We both like drawing, playing with dogs, and eating pizza.
🎧 You should invite her over for dinner one night.
🎧 Can we, Mom?
🎧 Sure. We can order pizza.
🎧 Maybe I'll ask her if she can come over on Friday.
🎧 Ok. Let's invite her parents too. We can get to know them.
🎧 That's a good idea. They don't have any friends here, yet.
 
[119] Meeting Someone at the Apartment
 
🎧 Hi. Are you new to the apartment building?
🎧 Yes. My name is Monica.
🎧 Nice to meet you, Monica. My name is Paul. I live on the third floor, apartment number 305.
🎧 I live on the fourth floor in 405.
🎧 Hey, you live right above me.
🎧 That's funny. I hope I'm not too noisy. I've been moving furniture around.
🎧 That's ok. It doesn't bother me. Have you met any of the other neighbors?
🎧 I met a few people. Everyone seems friendly here.
🎧 Yeah. Every month, we have a party on the rooftop. It's a potluck, so you can bring a dish to share.
🎧 That sounds fun! I love parties and potlucks.
🎧 Our next one is on Saturday at 5 pm. You should come. I'm bringing my famous pasta salad.
🎧 Sounds delicious. I'll make a chocolate cake.
🎧 I love chocolate cake. I can't wait to try it.
🎧 Thanks for letting me know about the party.
🎧 There should be an invitation in your mailbox. Everyone gets one.
🎧 I better check the mailbox then. I still have so much unpacking to do.
🎧 Do you need help moving any more furniture?
🎧 No. My brother helped me last night. I'm done with the big items. I just need to unpack pots and pans and dishes now.
🎧 Ok. Let me know if you need help. See you at the party.
 
[120] Riding School Bus with Friend
 
🎧 Hi Billy, how was your first day at a new school?
🎧 It was ok, Mom.
🎧 Did you make any new friends?
🎧 Yeah. A boy in my class.
🎧 Is he nice? What's his name?
🎧 He's cool. His name is Brian. He plays soccer.
🎧 You love soccer. You were on the soccer team at your old school.
🎧 Yeah, I miss my old team with Ted, Mark, and Richard.
🎧 I know you do. Do you want to invite Brian over to play one day?
🎧 Sure. He rides the school bus on our street.
🎧 Do you want to start riding the school bus too.
🎧 Yeah. Then I can meet more of the neighborhood kids.
🎧 Ok. Let's plan for you to ride the bus tomorrow morning.
🎧 Brian said the bus comes at 7:45.
🎧 Then you need to wake up at 7 o'clock.
🎧 I know. I'll set my alarm. 
 
[121] Misunderstanding
 
🎧 Hey Joe. Have you seen Sandy?
🎧 No, Bill. Why?
🎧 We had a misunderstanding and she is not talking to me.
🎧 Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.
🎧 Yeah. I said something silly and hurt her feelings.
🎧 What did you say?
🎧 It's not important. I don't want to discuss it. I just want to apologize to her.
🎧 She always hangs out at Linda's house or the library.
🎧 I've already checked both places.
🎧 How about her house.
🎧 Her roommate said she wasn't home.
🎧 Have you called her cell phone.
🎧 Yeah, several times.
🎧 She must really be mad at you.
🎧 She was! She stormed off and I didn't get to explain what I meant.
🎧 I'm really curious now. What did you say to her?
🎧 I told her to exercise.
🎧 Well, that probably wasn't a smart thing to say to a woman.
🎧 I meant that she should exercise to stay healthy.
🎧 That sounds better. Hope you find her.
 
[122] Buying a New Necklace
 
🎧 Hi Sally. What are you doing here?
🎧 Hey Susie. I need to buy my sister a new necklace. I accidentally lost her necklace and she is really mad at me now.
🎧 But you said it was an accident.
🎧 Yeah, but I didn't ask if I could borrow it.
🎧 Oh, that's not good.
🎧 She wasn't home and it looked nice with my outfit, so I wore it.
🎧 That's like stealing.
🎧 I know. I feel terrible. I was going to put it back when I got home.
🎧 How did you lose it?
🎧 I don't know. I was on my way home and I noticed it was gone.
🎧 Was it an expensive necklace?
🎧 I don't know. I'm looking for a replacement here.
🎧 What does it look like?
🎧 It's a gold butterfly.
🎧 Like this one?
🎧 That's it! That's exactly like hers? How much is it?
🎧 The price tag says $100.
🎧 Wow! That's expensive. Now I see why she was really mad.
🎧 Are you going to buy it?
🎧 Yeah. That's all the money I have until my next paycheck.
 
[123] Argument with Roommate
 
🎧 Hey Nancy, why do you look so worried?
🎧 Oh, hi Betty. Christine and I had a big argument and she has decided to move out.
🎧 What did you argue about?
🎧 I told her that she needs to help clean up around the apartment.
🎧 What happened after you told her that?
🎧 She got upset and said she is moving out. But it's the truth. She never helps around house.
🎧 Yeah, that could be a problem.
🎧 I had to say something since we're roommates and I'm tired of cleaning her mess.
🎧 I totally understand. I like things neat and organized too.
🎧 But the bigger problem is that she never pays her rent on time. She is late every month.
🎧 What are you going to do?
🎧 I need to find a roommate soon. I can't afford the rent by myself. Do you know anyone looking for a roommate?
🎧 Yes, I do.
🎧 Who?
🎧 Me.
🎧 That would be awesome!
 
[124] Planning to Hangout
 
🎧 Hello?
🎧 Hi John. This is Steven. What are you doing tonight?
🎧 Hey Steven. Nothing much. I don't have any plans yet.
🎧 Do you want to hang out?
🎧 Sure. What did you have in mind?
🎧 I don't know. It's Friday and I'm bored.
🎧 Want to go to the movies?
🎧 Is there a good movie to see?
🎧 Let's check the Internet.
🎧 Ok. Let me log onto my computer.
🎧 Do you want to see a comedy or a drama?
🎧 Nothing sad or depressing. I had a hard work week. I want to see something funny.
🎧 I agree. Work was stressful for me too.
🎧 There aren't any new comedies right now. I only see dramas and horror movies.
🎧 Yeah, that's all I see too.
🎧 Hey, let's go to comedy club. My favorite comedian is performing tonight at the local theater.
🎧 That sounds great. What time?
🎧 It starts at 7 pm. Let's do dinner too.
🎧 Good idea! I'll meet you at your house at 5 pm.
🎧 See you tonight.
 
[125] Going to the Mall
 
🎧 Hey Carol, are you done with your final exams?
🎧 Yes, Jane! I had my last one this morning. How about you?
🎧 Yeah, I got done an hour ago.
🎧 Do you want to celebrate?
🎧 Sure! What should we do?
🎧 I don't know. Should we throw a party?
🎧 What if our friends are not done with exams.
🎧 Yeah, you're right. Do you want to go dancing?
🎧 I don't know how to dance.
🎧 You don't? It's easy. Just move your body to music.
🎧 I look silly when I dance.
🎧 Me too. I don't care.
🎧 Let's do something else.
🎧 Ok. Do you have any ideas?
🎧 Do you want to go see a play?
🎧 That sounds boring. I want to do something active.
🎧 I think we have different ideas of fun.
🎧 Yeah. How about shopping? Do you want to go to the mall?
🎧 I love shopping. Let's do that. We can eat dinner there too.
🎧 Great! Let's meet at the department store at 4 pm.
 
[126] Sleepover
 
🎧 Hello?
🎧 Hi Linda. This is Stacy. Are you free tomorrow night?
🎧 No, I'm not. Why?
🎧 I'm inviting a couple of friends to sleep over.
🎧 I wish I could go, but I have to babysit my younger sister.
🎧 That's too bad. We were going to rent a movie and order pizza.
🎧 Now I really wish I could go. That sounds like so much fun.
🎧 Can your parents find another babysitter?
🎧 No. Our regular babysitter got sick, so they asked me.
🎧 I see. What time will your parents be back?
🎧 9 o'clock pm.
🎧 Do you want to come over after you finish babysitting?
🎧 Will you still be awake?
🎧 Of course! It's a sleepover party. We're all going to sleep late.
🎧 Ok! Please save me some pizza.
🎧 I will. See you tomorrow night.
 
[127] Coworker Moving Away
 
🎧 Hello?
🎧 Hi Karen. This is Janet. Did you hear that Joanne is moving to England?
🎧 Yeah, what a great opportunity for her.
🎧 I'm thinking about throwing her a going-away party. What do you think?
🎧 I think that's wonderful idea. She is such a good co-worker.
🎧 Would you like to help me plan it?
🎧 Sure. Let's make it a potluck, so everyone can bring a dish to share.
🎧 That's a great idea. Less stress if I don't have to cook.
🎧 Right! How many people do you want to invite?
🎧 How about all of the people she works with. How many is that?
🎧 I think there are about 30 people in our department, including us.
🎧 Should we keep it a secret or let her know?
🎧 She doesn't like people making a big fuss over her, so let's keep it a secret.
🎧 When should we have the party?
🎧 When is she moving?
🎧 Next month, I think.
🎧 Then we should do it soon. She'll be busy packing and getting ready for the move.
🎧 How about next Friday? It's her last day at work too.
🎧 Perfect!
🎧 I'll send out an email to everyone tonight. Thanks for your help.
 
[128] Daughter's friend Moving Away
 
🎧 Sally, what's wrong? Why do you look so sad?
🎧 Mom, Candace is moving away.
🎧 Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Why is she moving?
🎧 Her dad got a job in another state.
🎧 Where is she moving?
🎧 To California. That's across the country.
🎧 There are many ways you can still keep in touch. You can e-mail, text, and call each other on the phone.
🎧 But it won't be the same as seeing each other every day. She is my best friend. I'm going to miss her.
🎧 I know you will. When are they moving?
🎧 At the end of June when the school year ends. In two months.
🎧 Would you like to invite her over this weekend? You can have a sleepover.
🎧 Yes, please. That would be great. We're going to try to hang out as much as possible before she moves.
🎧 That sounds like a good plan.
🎧 Can we visit her in California?
🎧 It's pretty far from us. We don't know anyone there.
🎧 Yes, we do. Candace and her family.
 
[129] Selling the House
 
🎧 Hey Jeff. Are you ok?
🎧 Hi Dad. Yeah, I'm just a little sad that we are selling my childhood home.
🎧 I know. I'm sad too. But it's just too big for your mother and me.
🎧 I understand. I just have a lot of memories here.
🎧 Me too. This is the first home your mother and I bought.
🎧 Do you remember all of our holiday parties here? Everyone came to our house.
🎧 Of course I remember them. Those were the best times.
🎧 Now I'm married and have a family of my own.
🎧 I wish we didn't have to sell it, but we can no longer take care of it. We're getting old and it's too much work.
🎧 Do you know who bought our house?
🎧 A young couple with two kids. They seem like a loving family.
🎧 Where will you and mom go?
🎧 We found a beautiful, small condo a few blocks away.
🎧 That's nice. Will there be enough room when the grandchildren visit?
🎧 Yes. We have an extra room for guests, so your kids can stay over any time.
🎧 Where's Mom?
🎧 She's at the fabric store. She wants to sew new curtains for the condo.
 
[130] Loud Dog Barking
 
🎧 Hi Carol. You look tired today.
🎧 I am tired. I didn't get any sleep last night.
🎧 Why?
🎧 Our neighbor's dog would not stop barking. He barked all night long.
🎧 That's awful! Did you complain to your neighbor?
🎧 I knocked on his door, but he didn't answer. I don't think he was home.
🎧 What did you do all night?
🎧 I couldn't sleep, so I tried to read a book. But the dog's barking kept distracting me. So, I just watched TV.
🎧 I would be so angry. You should've called the police.
🎧 I didn't want to bother the police with a barking dog.
🎧 I would have called them. What if there was an emergency at your neighbor's house and the dog was trying to alert someone.
🎧 That's true. I didn't think about that. But this dog usually barks because he's bored.
🎧 That's annoying.
🎧 I know.
🎧 Hey Carol. Is that your neighbor? He's walking towards us.
🎧 What is he holding?
🎧 It looks like a plate of cookies.
 
[131] Loud Neighborhood Music
 
🎧 Hi Helen. What's wrong?
🎧 I couldn't sleep until 3 o'clock in the morning.
🎧 Why? What happened?
🎧 Our neighbors' children threw a big party last night. The music was so loud.
🎧 Wow! Where were their parents?
🎧 They are on vacation. They left the kids home.
🎧 How old are the kids?
🎧 They're teenagers. They're old enough to be home alone.
🎧 Did you complain to them?
🎧 Yes! I went over there three times. I told them that their music was too loud and we were trying to sleep.
🎧 What did they do?
🎧 Nothing. They wouldn't turn the music down.
🎧 That is so rude! Why didn't you call the police?
🎧 I finally did. The police found some of the teens drinking alcohol.
🎧 I bet that ended the party.
🎧 Yeah. Now my neighbors are heading back home from their vacation.
🎧 Do they know what happened?
🎧 Yes. They are not happy. Those kids are in big trouble.
 
[132] Helping a Neighbor
 
🎧 I feel so bad for Mary.
🎧 Me too. I can't believe her husband died. They were married for a long time.
🎧 I know. What is she going to do now?
🎧 I don't know. Does she have any children?
🎧 No, I don't think they had any children.
🎧 How about other family members?
🎧 I think she had one sister, but she passed away several years ago.
🎧 So, she's all alone now?
🎧 Yeah. Isn't that sad?
🎧 Yes, it is very sad.
🎧 She is always so nice to everyone. I think we should all get together and do something nice for her.
🎧 I like that idea. What should we do?
🎧 Let's take turns helping her around the house?
🎧 Great idea! We can take care of her yard, help clean her house, and bring her meals.
🎧 I love this. Let's talk to the other neighbors soon.
 
[133] Small Talk at the Bus Stop
 
🎧 Has Bus 47 come yet?
🎧 No. I think it's late today.
🎧 Do you ride this bus every day?
🎧 Yeah. Do you?
🎧 Not every day. Only a couple of times a week.
🎧 Well, I think the bus is late today because of the rain.
🎧 Oh. Does the weather make a difference?
🎧 Yes. The bus is usually several minutes late when it rains.
🎧 Because of bad traffic?
🎧 Yeah and probably because of car accidents.
🎧 That makes sense. I must have picked the wrong day to ride the bus.
🎧 Actually, I think riding the bus on rainy days is better.
🎧 Why?
🎧 Then you don't have to drive in bad traffic. Someone is driving for you.
🎧 You are totally right! I'm going to check the weather from now on. I'm going to take the bus when it rains.
🎧 Then I'll see you here at the bus stop.
🎧 Great! It was nice talking with you.
🎧 Yes, it was. I think our bus is coming now.
 
[134] Small Talk about Sports
 
🎧 I like your sports jersey.
🎧 Thanks! You must be a fan too.
🎧 I am. I went to that college.
🎧 Really? Me too.
🎧 What year did you graduate?
🎧 2000.
🎧 I graduated in 2004.
🎧 What was your major?
🎧 I studied Law.
🎧 I studied Law, too!
🎧 I'm Matthew, by the way.
🎧 I'm Karen. Nice to meet you, Matthew.
🎧 Are you going to the game tonight?
🎧 No. I'm going to watch it at home.
🎧 I have an extra ticket. Would you like to go to the game with me?
🎧 I'd love to. We can watch our college football team win tonight!
🎧 Ok! What about dinner first?
🎧 Sounds great.
🎧 I'll meet you at this coffee shop at 5 pm.
🎧 Ok. See you tonight, Matthew.
 
[135] Taxi Small Talk
 
🎧 Can we share this cab?
🎧 Where are you going?
🎧 To 5th Avenue and Main Street.
🎧 That's where I'm going too.
🎧 Great! It's so hard to catch a cab at this time.
🎧 I know! Are you going to work?
🎧 No, I'm meeting some friends at a restaurant.
🎧 Is it the new Thai place?
🎧 Yes. Have you been there?
🎧 Yeah.
🎧 How is it?
🎧 It's pretty good.
🎧 Oh good. It's my first time trying Thai food.
🎧 Really? Everything is freshly made.
🎧 That's good to hear. I'm a little picky about food.
🎧 I hope you like it.
🎧 Thanks. Where are you going?
🎧 Work.
🎧 Where do you work?
🎧 I'm a chef at the new Thai restaurant.
🎧 That's awesome!
🎧 Let the chef know what you think later. If you liked it, you may get a free dessert.
🎧 You're funny!
 
[136] Family Reunion
 
🎧 Mom, are we having a big party tonight?
🎧 Yes, Robert. All of our relatives are coming. Did you forget?
🎧 Oh yeah. It's our annual family reunion.
🎧 How could you forget? We have a big party every year. This year it is at our house.
🎧 I remember it was at Uncle Walter's house last year. That was fun.
🎧 Do you need any help?
🎧 Yes. Could you please go to the store and buy some ice?
🎧 I made some lemonade and I want to keep it cold during the party.
🎧 That's a good idea. It's going to be hot today.
🎧 I hope the food stays fresh.
🎧 I'm sure it will be fine. What are you making?
🎧 It's going to be a potluck. I am serving barbeque ribs and potatoes.
🎧 Do you know what other people are bringing.
🎧 I think some people are going to bring salads, appetizers, and desserts.
🎧 Sounds like a feast.
🎧 I think everyone is coming, except Aunt Linda. She's feeling sick today.
🎧 That's too bad. She is my favorite aunt.
🎧 I know. She's my favorite sister.
🎧 I can't wait to see all of my cousins.
🎧 They're excited to see you too. But right now, please go buy some ice.
 
[137] Boring Family Reunion
 
🎧 Mom, do I have to go to the family reunion?
🎧 Yes, Sam. Why don't you want to go?
🎧 It's boring and I have no one to talk to.
🎧 You have a lot of cousins.
🎧 I know, but they are all younger than me.
🎧 So, you could entertain them.
🎧 Ok.
🎧 Your grandparents will be very disappointed if you do not attend.
🎧 Ok. Where is it going to be?
🎧 It is going to be at an Italian restaurant. Italian food is your favorite.
🎧 I know. How long is it going to be?
🎧 Probably a few hours.
🎧 Can I leave early?
🎧 If you can find a ride home, you can leave early.
🎧 I wish I knew how to drive.
🎧 You will learn someday. But tonight you are going to the reunion.
 
[138] Unhappy Family Reunion
 
🎧 Hello?
🎧 Hi Jane. This is Susan.
🎧 Hi Susan. How are you?
🎧 Did you receive an invitation to the family reunion?
🎧 Yeah.
🎧 Are you going to go?
🎧 I don't think so.
🎧 Why?
🎧 Remember our cousin Bill and I had a disagreement at the last reunion?
🎧 Yes. But it was all a misunderstanding.
🎧 I know, but I still feel uncomfortable about it.
🎧 I would really like to see you there. I haven't seen you in a while.
🎧 I know. I feel the same way.
🎧 If you don't go to the reunion, maybe I can visit you.
🎧 That sounds like a great idea. Have you ever been to New York?
🎧 No. I would love to visit you and check out the city.
🎧 Let's plan to do that.
🎧 I still want you to come to the reunion.
🎧 I'll think about it.
🎧 Ok. I hope to see you there.
 
[139] Having a Baby
 
🎧 Hello.
🎧 Hi Mom. This is Linda.
🎧 Hi Linda. Why are you calling so early in the morning? Is something wrong?
🎧 No, not at all. Actually, I have some good news.
🎧 What is it?
🎧 I'm having a baby.
🎧 That's great news! When did you find out?
🎧 Last night. It was too late to call you. I thought you might be sleeping.
🎧 You can call me anytime, Linda. How does Dan feel?
🎧 He's so happy. He went out this morning to buy the baby a gift?
🎧 Already? That is funny! When is the baby due?
🎧 In June. I am 3 months pregnant.
🎧 How are you feeling? Do you feel sick at all?
🎧 Just a little.
🎧 Are you able to eat anything?
🎧 Yeah, I'm actually really hungry right now.
🎧 Let me come over and make you something to eat.
🎧 Mom, let's go out for breakfast. I'll treat you.
🎧 Don't be silly. I'll buy you breakfast. I'll be there in 30 minutes.
🎧 Ok, Mom. See you at 8 am.
 
[140] Grandchildren
 
🎧 Why do you look so happy, Carol?
🎧 I was just on the phone with my daughter. She is having a baby.
🎧 How exciting!
🎧 This will be our first grandchild.
🎧 Is the baby a boy or a girl?
🎧 She doesn't know yet. She is only three months pregnant.
🎧 Three months? So, the baby is due in June?
🎧 Yes. I'm going to be a grandmother in June. How many grandchildren do you have, Joan?
🎧 I have three. Two grandsons and one granddaughter.
🎧 Yes, I remember now. They visit you often.
🎧 Yes, they do. I love when they visit.
🎧 I'm so excited. I'm going to go shopping to buy my grandchild some clothes.
🎧 But the baby hasn't been born yet.
🎧 I know. But I love looking at baby clothes. Do you want to go with me?
🎧 Sure. Maybe I'll get something for my grandkids too. Let me grab my purse.
 
[141] Sister's Baby
 
🎧 Hi Susie. Where are you going? Are you taking a trip?
🎧 Yeah, I'm going to Chicago. My sister just had a baby. I'm going to be helping her for a couple of weeks.
🎧 That's so nice of you. Did she have a boy or a girl?
🎧 A girl. Her name is Rose.
🎧 What a beautiful name!
🎧 Yeah. She is named after our grandmother.
🎧 My daughter is also named after my grandmother. Her name is Marie.
🎧 That's also a beautiful name.
🎧 Thanks. Is this your sister's first child?
🎧 Yeah. This is my first niece too. She's also the first grandchild in the family.
🎧 How special!
🎧 I know. My mother is so excited. She's only lives a few blocks away from my sister. So, she will be helping a lot too.
🎧 That's wonderful. It's nice to have a lot of help with your first child.
🎧 Yeah. I agree. Well, I better go now. I have to be at the airport by 1 pm.
🎧 Ok. See you in two weeks.
 
[142] Small Auto Accident
 
🎧 Hi Carol. Did you get a new car?
🎧 Hi Jane. No, this is a rental car. I was in an auto accident yesterday.
🎧 Are you ok?
🎧 Yeah. My back hurts a little, but luckily I wasn't seriously injured.
🎧 Did you go to the hospital?
🎧 Yeah. I went there this morning. The doctor took some did x-rays. Nothing is serious. I just have some bruises.
🎧 I'm glad you are ok. Was there another car involved?
🎧 Yeah, the other driver rear-ended me at a red light.
🎧 Wow! Is he or she ok?
🎧 Yeah. He seemed ok at the scene.
🎧 This could've been a serious accident.
🎧 I know. We were both lucky.
🎧 Where is your car? Is it getting fixed?
🎧 No. It's too damaged to be repaired. It's at the junkyard now.
🎧 That's terrible. Is your insurance going to pay for a new car?
🎧 Well, it was the other driver's fault, so his insurance is going to take care of it.
🎧 That's good. Are you going to buy the same type of car?
🎧 I think so. I loved that car. It protected me in this accident.
 
[143] Big Auto Accident
 
🎧 Hi Mary. What's wrong?
🎧 Oh hi Alice. I just got back from the hospital.
🎧 Is something wrong?
🎧 My son was in an auto accident last night.
🎧 Oh dear. I'm sorry to hear that. Was he seriously injured?
🎧 Yes. He broke both of his legs and his ribs.
🎧 That's awful!
🎧 I know. He just got his driver's license a month ago.
🎧 How scary for him.
🎧 It wasn't his fault though. He was hit by a drunk driver.
🎧 That's terrible!
🎧 I'm so angry about it! My son could've been killed by an irresponsible driver.
🎧 You're right! Did they catch the other driver? Was he or she injured?
🎧 Yeah, he was arrested. He wasn't injured.
🎧 Do you think he will go to jail?
🎧 I don't know. I'm just worried about my son right now.
🎧 Can I help you with anything?
🎧 Well, I just came home to get a change of clothes. I'm going to go back to the hospital soon. Would you be able to feed our cats tonight?
🎧 Of course. Please let me know if there is anything else I can help you with.
🎧 Thanks Alice.
 
[144] Freeway Auto Accident
 
🎧 Why are you so late?
🎧 There was big accident on the freeway. The police closed all the lanes. We had to take a detour.
🎧 Was anyone hurt?
🎧 I think so. I saw two ambulances and a fire truck driving by.
🎧 That's terrible.
🎧 I know. I hope no one was seriously injured.
🎧 That's scary. Do you know what caused the accident?
🎧 I don't know. I didn't see it happen.
🎧 You should've called me. We were supposed to meet Cathy and Rick for dinner at 6 pm.
🎧 After seeing the accident, I didn't want to use my phone while driving.
🎧 That was smart.
🎧 We should just eat at home tonight. I think traffic is going to be bad.
🎧 Oh no!
🎧 What's wrong?
🎧 I just got a text from Cathy. She said she and Rick were in an accident on the freeway! They're at the hospital.
🎧 Oh my goodness. Let's go to the hospital now.
 
[145] Finding a Car Mechanic
 
🎧 Hey Stan. Do you know any good mechanics around here?
🎧 Yeah. I use a really good one. What's wrong with your car?
🎧 I'm not sure. I think there is a problem with my transmission.
🎧 Transmission problems can be very expensive.
🎧 I know. I took it to an auto shop yesterday and it was so expensive. I'm looking for someone cheaper, but who can also do a good job.
🎧 You should go to my mechanic. You can trust him and his repair costs are pretty reasonable.
🎧 Is he close to us?
🎧 Yeah. His shop is just a few blocks away.
🎧 That's good. I hope I don't have to replace the transmission. That will be really expensive.
🎧 I know. I had to replace the transmission on my old car. The repair cost more than the price of the car.
🎧 That's crazy! If my repair costs too much, I'm just going to buy a new car.
🎧 Can you afford a new car?
🎧 No. I would have to buy a used car.
🎧 Let me get my mechanic's phone number. You can decide what you want to do after he takes a look at your car.
🎧 Thanks.
🎧 I can give you a ride home if you need to leave your car there.
🎧 If it's only a few blocks away, I'll walk. If my car is too expensive to fix, I better get used to walking.
 
[146] Fixing the Car
 
🎧 Hey Sam. You're home? Where's your car?
🎧 Oh hey John. It's in the auto shop.
🎧 Again? What's wrong with it this time?
🎧 I'm not sure. It's making a lot of strange noises.
🎧 That's weird. It's not even an old car.
🎧 I know. I've only had it for three years. My mechanic doesn't know what the problem is.
🎧 He doesn't know? What is he doing then?
🎧 Trying all different things. I'm getting tired of waiting for him to fix it.
🎧 You should take it to another mechanic.
🎧 I should, but I already paid him. He just keeps saying he will fix it.
🎧 He doesn't sound very trustworthy.
🎧 I know. I should've gone somewhere else. But he was so cheap. He was the cheapest I could find.
🎧 Maybe too cheap isn't always better.
🎧 I'm learning that now.
🎧 You should demand a refund.
🎧 I wish I could, but it's a little complicated.
🎧 Why is it complicated?
🎧 The mechanic is my brother-in-law.
 
[147] Auto Shop
 
🎧 Hey Jason. Is that a new car?
🎧 Hey Dan. No, this is a rental car?
🎧 Where is your car?
🎧 At the auto shop. I was in an accident yesterday. The car is getting repaired.
🎧 Are you ok?
🎧 Yeah. Luckily, it wasn't a serious accident. There were just some minor damages to the fender and bumper.
🎧 That's good. When do you get your car back?
🎧 It's supposed to be ready this afternoon.
🎧 That's quick.
🎧 Yeah, my auto shop is pretty fast. They have a lot of mechanics.
🎧 Do they do a good job? Are they reasonably priced?
🎧 Oh yes. They do a great job. I haven't had any problems yet. They're a little more expensive than other places, but their work and service is excellent.
🎧 I may have to get their name and number. My car needs some regular maintenance work.
🎧 They have a website. Sometimes, they offer discounts on certain services.
🎧 Really? That's good to know.
🎧 Yeah. I'll e-mail you the website link.
🎧 Thanks. I'll check it out tonight.
 
[148] Gas prices
 
🎧 Hey Ben, have you seen the price of gas lately?
🎧 Yeah Mike. It's really high. That's why I've been riding the bus to work.
🎧 I wish I could ride the bus, but I would have to take three buses to get to work.
🎧 Three?
🎧 Yeah. It would take me twice as long to get to work.
🎧 That's not good. I only have to take one bus and it takes me directly from my home to my office building.
🎧 You're lucky!
🎧 I know. What about riding your bike to work?
🎧 No, I'm not very good at cycling and it's too far.
🎧 You can carpool with someone.
🎧 That's a good idea. Then we could share the cost of gas and ride in the carpool lane.
🎧 Do you work with anyone who lives near you?
🎧 Yeah, my boss.
🎧 Would you want to ride with your boss?
🎧 No, not really. I think I'd rather pay more for gas.
 
[149] Bad Traffic
 
🎧 The traffic is really getting bad these days.
🎧 I agree. I sat in traffic for two hours last night.
🎧 I've started to leave work late just to beat rush hour traffic.
🎧 I wish I could do that. I have to pick up my son before the daycare closes.
🎧 Oh, I see. What time does the daycare close?
🎧 6 o'clock.
🎧 What time do you usually get there?
🎧 Just a few minutes before they close.
🎧 What happens if you're late?
🎧 They will wait with the child, of course. But you have to pay extra.
🎧 Have you ever been late?
🎧 Yeah, a few times. I was late yesterday. I don't want to pay extra. Daycare is already expensive.
🎧 Yeah, I'm sure it is. Do you have other people who can help you?
🎧 No, I just listen to the traffic report and leave earlier if the roads sound bad.
🎧 Is your boss understanding?
🎧 Yeah, she's very understanding. She has children too.
 
[150] Son's driver's license
 
🎧 My son is taking his driver's license test today.
🎧 Is he nervous?
🎧 He's a little nervous.
🎧 It's normal to be nervous.
🎧 I told him that. He just wants to pass the test, so he can start driving to school.
🎧 Does he have a car?
🎧 No, he has to share with my wife.
🎧 Are you going to get him a car?
🎧 No, not yet. First, he has to show us that he is a responsible driver.
🎧 Did your auto insurance go up a lot?
🎧 Yes! Our insurance rate doubled.
🎧 Wow! Are you serious?
🎧 Yes, that's what makes me nervous. I don't know how we'll be able to afford insurance when my younger son starts to drive.
🎧 When will that be?
🎧 In two years.
🎧 Better start saving or better have your sons get part-time jobs.
🎧 I think I like the part-time job idea better.
 
[151] Making Dentist Appointment
 
🎧 Hello. Thank you for calling Dr. Smith's office. How can I help you?
🎧 This is Eleanor Johnson. I'd like to make an appointment to see the dentist.
🎧 Will this be your first visit?
🎧 Yes. I haven't been to the dentist in a while. I'm afraid of going to the dentist.
🎧 Oh. You will like Dr. Smith. He is very gentle.
🎧 That's nice to hear.
🎧 Is there anything wrong with your teeth?
🎧 I have a toothache.
🎧 We have an opening tomorrow morning at 9 am.
🎧 Do you have anything this afternoon. My tooth hurts very much.
🎧 We are very busy this afternoon, but I can squeeze you in around 4 pm. Does that work for you?
🎧 Yes! 4 pm is perfect.
🎧 Do you have dental insurance?
🎧 Yes, I do.
🎧 Ok. Please come 15 minutes early to fill out some forms.
🎧 Ok. I will be there at 3:45. Thank you so much.
🎧 You're welcome. We'll see you soon.
🎧 Bye.
 
[152] Talking about Dentist Appointment
 
🎧 Susie, I'm picking you up from school early today.
🎧 Why Mom?
🎧 You have a dentist appointment.
🎧 I don't want to go.
🎧 It's just a check-up.
🎧 But it hurt last time.
🎧 That is because you had a cavity.
🎧 But I brush my teeth every day.
🎧 I know, but you eat too much candy.
🎧 I hope I don't have any cavities this time.
🎧 Me too.
🎧 What time are you picking me up?
🎧 2 o'clock.
🎧 Ok. I'll tell my teacher.
🎧 I will also call the school office.
🎧 Ok. I'll see you later.
 
[153] At the Dentist
 
🎧 Hi Alice. What are you doing here?
🎧 Hi Linda. I'm here for a check-up. How about you?
🎧 I'm here for a procedure.
🎧 What kind of procedure?
🎧 A root canal.
🎧 A root canal? That's pretty serious, isn't it?
🎧 Yeah. I didn't take care of a tooth and now it's infected.
🎧 Wow! I'm sorry to hear that. Are you in pain?
🎧 A little. I took some medicine this morning.
🎧 That should help.
🎧 I don't have dental insurance, so it's going to be very expensive.
🎧 That's terrible. Why don't you have dental insurance?
🎧 I didn't think it was important.
🎧 I think it's important to have dental insurance.
🎧 Yeah. And it's important to take care of your teeth.
🎧 I agree.
 
[154] Working Out and Exercising
 
🎧 Hey Paul, have you been working out?
🎧 Hey David. Yeah, I've been going to the gym every day before work.
🎧 I need to go too, but I'm so lazy now.
🎧 I needed to lose a few pounds. That's what motivated me. Now, I just like going.
🎧 I need to lose some weight too. I gained around 20 pounds this year.
🎧 You did? Why don't you come with me tomorrow morning?
🎧 What time do you go in the morning?
🎧 5 am. I work out for about an hour.
🎧 5 am? That's too early.
🎧 You should try it. It feels great to work out early in the morning.
🎧 I'm asleep at 5 am.
🎧 I'll wake you up tomorrow morning. We can start slow by doing just a little running on the treadmill.
🎧 I hate running.
🎧 Ok, how about lifting weights?
🎧 I don't have the strength to lift weights.
🎧 Ok. How about aerobics?
🎧 That's too much jumping around?
🎧 Yoga?
🎧 Too boring.
🎧 You're right, David. You're too lazy to work out.
 
[155] Late Library Books
 
🎧 Hi Janet. Where are you going with those books?
🎧 To the library. I found these under Joseph's bed.
🎧 Under his bed?
🎧 Yeah. They are all overdue.
🎧 How did you find them?
🎧 We got a notice from the library that he had several overdue books, so I started searching his room.
🎧 How late are they?
🎧 About two months.
🎧 Didn't you receive notices before?
🎧 I found the notices in his room too.
🎧 Why didn't he return them?
🎧 He said he couldn't find them.
🎧 Is he in trouble?
🎧 Of course he's in trouble. He doesn't get to play video games for each book that is late.
🎧 That's five weeks.
🎧 Yes. That's his punishment. He needs to learn not to hide letters that come in the mail. He also needs to learn to clean his room, so things don't get lost.
 
[156] Opening a Bank Account for Child
 
🎧 What are you doing today?
🎧 Hi Peter. I'm taking my son to the bank. He got his first paycheck yesterday, so we're going to open a bank account for him.
🎧 That's a great idea.
🎧 Yeah, I hope this will teach him how to save money and use it wisely.
🎧 We did that with our kids too. Is he excited about it?
🎧 Not really. He wants to spend it all on video games.
🎧 Well, it's his first paycheck, so I'm sure he wants to spend his own money.
🎧 I understand that. He knows he can spend it any way he wants to. I just want him to be able to learn how to save some too.
🎧 Yeah, I totally understand. My first son spent his whole paycheck each time. Now he doesn't have anything saved. My second son saves and saves.
🎧 I'm hoping Jonathan saves and saves.
🎧 Now my older son always borrows money from his younger brother.
🎧 Wow! Does your younger son loan him money?
🎧 Yeah, but he adds on interest.
🎧 That's funny and smart. He's like a bank.
🎧 He wants to be a banker one day.
🎧 This is giving him great experience.
🎧 Yeah, but not a great relationship with his brother.
 
[157] Post Office Talk with Friend
 
🎧 Hey Joe. What are you doing?
🎧 Hi Mark. I'm getting ready to send a package.
🎧 Do you need to go to the post office?
🎧 Yeah, but the line is usually very long.
🎧 Where are you sending your package?
🎧 Overseas to Korea.
🎧 Is it a big package?
🎧 Yeah. Some books and clothes for my nephew and nieces.
🎧 That's nice.
🎧 Do you think the line will be long today?
🎧 I think so. Today is Monday. Most people go on Monday since the post office is closed on Sunday.
🎧 You're right! Maybe I should wait until tomorrow.
🎧 I think that's a better idea.
🎧 Thanks for reminding me. I don't like waiting in long lines.
🎧 Me too.
🎧 Do you want to go have lunch instead?
🎧 Sure.
🎧 I'll be right back. I'm going to put my package away.
 
[158] At the Post Office
 
🎧 Hi. How can I help you?
🎧 I need to mail this package to Italy.
🎧 What is in the package?
🎧 Some toys and baby clothes.
🎧 Are there any breakables? Is it fragile?
🎧 No.
🎧 What is the address?
🎧 I have it here.
🎧 Please fill out this form. Print clearly. Sometimes, it is hard to read.
🎧 Ok. When will my package arrive?
🎧 It depends on your shipping choice.
🎧 I would like your fastest shipping.
🎧 It will be there in one week.
🎧 Great! That's perfect.
🎧 This is the cost. How would you like to pay?
🎧 With my credit card.
🎧 Ok. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
🎧 No. That's it.
🎧 Thank you. Have a nice day.
🎧 You too.
 
[159] Running into Friend at Post Office
 
🎧 Hey Robert. What are you doing here?
🎧 Hi Kevin. I need to buy some stamps. What about you?
🎧 I was checking my post office box, but my key won't work.
🎧 Do you know why?
🎧 I think they canceled my account because I forgot to pay.
🎧 That's too bad.
🎧 Yeah. I use it for my business.
🎧 How long have you been waiting?
🎧 I've been here since 8 am.
🎧 That's 30 minutes.
🎧 I know. It's been a long wait.
🎧 There are still several people ahead of us.
🎧 Many people left. They were tired of waiting.
🎧 I don't think I can wait either. I have a dentist appointment at 9 am.
🎧 I'm going to wait. I need to re-open my account.
🎧 Yeah. I understand. I'm going to come back later.
🎧 Ok. See you another time.
🎧 Bye Kevin.
 
[160] Supermarket Talk with Daughter
 
🎧 Sally, I'm going to the supermarket this afternoon. Do you need anything?
🎧 Yes Mom. Can you buy some snacks for school?
🎧 Sure. What kind of snacks?
🎧 I like pretzels and potato chips.
🎧 Ok. I will pick up some fruits too.
🎧 I don't like fruits.
🎧 Fruits are healthy for you.
🎧 Can I go to the market with you?
🎧 Are you done with your homework?
🎧 No. I have to study for a math test tomorrow.
🎧 Then you should stay home and study.
🎧 I need to take break. I've been studying all day.
🎧 Ok. We will only be gone for about an hour.
🎧 Can we get ice cream on the way home?
🎧 I thought you needed to study.
🎧 I've studied enough. I'm ready for my math test.
 
[161] Supermarket Talk with Friend
 
🎧 Hi Jane. Where are you going?
🎧 Hi Sandra. I'm heading to the market.
🎧 Which one?
🎧 The one down the street.
🎧 Today is a good day to go. There are a lot of items on sale.
🎧 That's great to know. I need to buy a lot of stuff.
🎧 The market is going out of business?
🎧 Why?
🎧 Not enough customers.
🎧 That's not good. I always go to that market.
🎧 Me too. But more people are going to the bigger market a few blocks away.
🎧 It's always so crowded there.
🎧 I know. But it has a bigger selection of things.
🎧 Yeah, but I still like the smaller store.
🎧 Well, you better leave soon. There were a lot of people today because of the big sale.
🎧 Ok. Thanks for letting me know. I'll see you later.
 
[162] Shopping List
 
🎧 Hi Carol. What are you doing?
🎧 Hi Jane. I'm making a shopping list for the supermarket.
🎧 I need to go too. But my car is at the repair shop.
🎧 What's wrong with it?
🎧 Nothing serious. Just an oil change.
🎧 Do you want to join me?
🎧 Sure. Which one are you going to?
🎧 ABC Grocery. I have coupons for that market.
🎧 Let me check my purse and see if I have any coupons too.
🎧 You can get good deals on a lot of things if you have their coupons.
🎧 I know. I use their coupons all the time.
🎧 So, do you have any?
🎧 No. I think I used them all. Where did you get your coupons?
🎧 They came in the mail today. Have you looked in your mail box?
🎧 No, not yet. I'll go do that right now. What time are you leaving?
🎧 Don't worry. I can wait for you.
🎧 Thanks. I'll be right back.
 
[163] Asking for a Raise
 
🎧 Hey Ted, why do you look so nervous?
🎧 I'm going to ask the boss for a raise.
🎧 You should. You deserve a raise. You work very hard.
🎧 I do work hard. I'm here early every day and I leave late every night.
🎧 Yeah, you do. You also help other people when they need help. You've helped me many times.
🎧 Also, I've been here for 10 years. My last raise was three years ago.
🎧 Three years? Then I think it's definitely time for a raise.
🎧 Do you think she will say yes?
🎧 I think she will. She is nice. She listens well and she is also very fair.
🎧 I wrote a short report about why I deserve a raise.
🎧 Only you would do that. You are so detail-oriented.
🎧 I like to be prepared about everything.
🎧 That's another reason why you should get a raise.
🎧 Ok. I'm ready to talk to her?
🎧 You can't talk to her today.
🎧 Why not?
🎧 She's on a business trip.
 
[164] Asking for a Promotion
 
🎧 Hey James, I'm thinking about asking the boss for a promotion.
🎧 Lisa, you definitely deserve a promotion. You are too qualified for this job.
🎧 Really? You think so?
🎧 You have a lot of experience and you're very good with people. You should be a manager.
🎧 That's the position I was going to ask for, but I was worried.
🎧 What are you worried about?
🎧 I don't have a college degree. You have to have a college degree for that position.
🎧 But you have lots of experience. You have more experience than some of the current managers.
🎧 I know, but degrees are important too.
🎧 I know they are. Did you ever think about going back to school and getting your degree?
🎧 I have, but I am so busy these days. I don't have time to work and study.
🎧 I understand. When I'm not at work, I'm spending time with my family. Life is so busy these days for many people.
🎧 That's true. I'm not married yet, but I take care of my elderly parents.
🎧 That's a lot of work too.
🎧 Yeah. Well, thanks for your support. I'll let you know what happens.
 
[165] Asking for a Vacation
 
🎧 I need a vacation.
🎧 What's wrong?
🎧 This job is so stressful, Karen!
🎧 I think you should ask the boss for some time off?
🎧 I can't right now. I have a big presentation on Friday.
🎧 Take a break next week after the presentation.
🎧 I have another project after this one.
🎧 You need to make a change. You're going to get sick.
🎧 I know. But I have a lot of responsibilities.
🎧 I know you do. But you also have to take care of yourself too.
🎧 You're right. I need to talk to the boss and tell him that I need a vacation. Do you think he will understand?
🎧 I think so. He had a heart attack a few years ago. He understands that health is very important.
🎧 Ok. I will talk to him today. Thanks for your advice.
🎧 You're welcome. Where do you plan to go on vacation?
🎧 A nice, warm beach.
🎧 That sounds great!
 
[166] Big Project
 
🎧 Hey Tom. Are you working late again?
🎧 Yeah, Peter. I have a big project I'm working on.
🎧 How's it going?
🎧 Not well. We keep running into problems with the client.
🎧 What kind of problems.
🎧 The client either doesn't like our designs or keeps changing his mind. It's very frustrating.
🎧 That can be very annoying.
🎧 It is. So, my group has to start over each time. It's such a waste of time and money.
🎧 When is the deadline?
🎧 In two weeks. I don't know how we're going to make it.
🎧 Where's the rest of your group?
🎧 They went to eat. I told them to go. They're going to bring me back some dinner.
🎧 That's good. What are you going to do after your deadline is over?
🎧 Go on a long vacation.
🎧 Good for you!
🎧 Well, I better get back to work. See you in the morning.
 
[167] Too Busy for Vacation
 
🎧 What's wrong, Ted.
🎧 Hey Jim. My family and I planned a trip to Hawaii and I'm not sure I can go now.
🎧 Why?
🎧 I'm so busy at work. I have too many things to do.
🎧 What do you have to do?
🎧 I have a big presentation due soon.
🎧 What are you going to do?
🎧 I don't know. The airline tickets are non-refundable and my family is going to be very sad.
🎧 Is there any way you can finish everything before your trip?
🎧 That's what I'm trying to do, but I don't know if I can.
🎧 Is there anyone at work who can help you?
🎧 Yeah, but he's been sick.
🎧 Oh. That's terrible. Why don't you talk to your boss?
🎧 He's not very understanding. He just wants the work to be completed.
🎧 Maybe you can take work with you on your trip.
🎧 That's not a vacation. But I may have to do that. My wife is not going to be happy.
🎧 I wish I could help you.
🎧 Thanks. Do you know anything about presentations?
🎧 No, I'm an accountant.
 
[168] Dad is too Busy
 
🎧 What's wrong, Jane? Why do you look so sad?
🎧 Hi Sally. My dad is not in the audience. He's not coming for my first piano recital.
🎧 Why?
🎧 He has to work late tonight. He is really busy at work.
🎧 I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe he will come to the next one.
🎧 I hope so. I really wanted him to be here today.
🎧 Yeah. I understand.
🎧 He missed my ballet performance last week too.
🎧 Oh, he did?
🎧 Yeah. He has a lot of projects at work.
🎧 What does he do?
🎧 He's an architect. He designs buildings and houses.
🎧 That's cool! Did he design your house?
🎧 Yeah. He's really good at his job. That's why he is so busy.
🎧 Hey Jane. Look!
🎧 What, Sally?
🎧 Your dad is in the audience and he's waving at you!
🎧 He's here!
🎧 
 
[169] Getting Fired from Work
 
🎧 Hey Stan. Did you hear what happened to Winston?
🎧 No, Mark. What happened?
🎧 He got fired this morning.
🎧 Why?
🎧 He got caught stealing money from the company.
🎧 How did he steal it?
🎧 I don't know.
🎧 Did the boss call the police?
🎧 No, not yet.
🎧 Why not?
🎧 He said that if he returns the money, they will not call the police.
🎧 What if he doesn't return the money.
🎧 Then he's going to call the police.
🎧 He better return the money.
🎧 I know. He is so foolish. Why would he do this?
🎧 I always thought there was something strange about him.
🎧 He's going to have a hard time finding another job after this.
🎧 I agree. How can anyone trust him after this?
 
[170] Losing a Job
 
🎧 Hey Matt, you're home early today.
🎧 Oh, hi Bill. I got laid off today.
🎧 I'm sorry to hear that. Why?
🎧 The company is downsizing and they eliminated my position.
🎧 That's terrible. How long did you work there?
🎧 15 years.
🎧 Wow! That's a long time.
🎧 I know. I worked very hard, but I guess it wasn't enough.
🎧 Don't say that. Companies usually downsize because they are losing money.
🎧 I know. I just don't know what to do now. I have a family to take care of.
🎧 Does your wife know?
🎧 Not yet. She's at work. I didn't want to give her bad news there.
🎧 I understand. What kind of work did you do?
🎧 I'm a graphic designer.
🎧 Really? My son is a website developer. Do you know anything about web design?
🎧 That's my specialty.
🎧 Let me give him a call. Maybe he can help you find a job.
🎧 That would be great! I really appreciate it.
 
[171] Company Downsizing Rumors
 
🎧 Hey Joe, did you hear the rumors?
🎧 No, Jason. What rumors?
🎧 The company is laying people off?
🎧 When?
🎧 I'm not sure. I heard this from Susan in Accounting.
🎧 Why are they laying people off?
🎧 The company is not making a profit.
🎧 Are you worried?
🎧 Yeah. I'm very worried. I just bought a house.
🎧 I'm really worried too. My wife and I just had a baby. Also, I haven't been at this company for very long. I would be the first one to get laid off.
🎧 This is terrible. What should we do?
🎧 Maybe we should start looking for other jobs.
🎧 But what if it's all a rumor and not true.
🎧 Well, if you heard it from Susan, it must be true.
🎧 Why?
🎧 Her mom is our boss.
 
[172] Job Search
 
🎧 Hey, how's the job search going, Rick?
🎧 Not well, Sean. I've sent out over 30 resumes and no one has called me.
🎧 I think a lot of people are looking for jobs right now. The economy isn't very good, so companies aren't hiring people.
🎧 That's what it seems like. But I need a job.
🎧 How long have you been out of work?
🎧 3 months.
🎧 What kind of work do you do?
🎧 I'm an electrician.
🎧 Have you thought about opening your own business?
🎧 Yeah, but that takes money.
🎧 I understand. If I hear anyone looking for an electrician, I'll let you know.
🎧 Thanks. It's been frustrating.
🎧 Why did you leave your last job?
🎧 I didn't get along with my boss.
🎧 Maybe you should've stayed until you found another job.
🎧 Yeah. That was my mistake. I thought it would be easy to find another job. I was wrong.
🎧 Don't worry. You'll find one soon. Come on, let me buy you a cup of coffee.
🎧 Thanks.
 
[173] Interview for a Job
 
🎧 Why are you so dressed up, Jane?
🎧 Oh, hi Sally. I have a job interview today.
🎧 That's great. Where?
🎧 At the bank. I'm applying for a teller position.
🎧 But why do you look so nervous?
🎧 Because I don't have much work experience, but I'm a hard worker and good with numbers.
🎧 Tell them that.
🎧 I'm going to. I just hope I don't mess up.
🎧 Don't worry so much. You're smart and you get along well with everyone.
🎧 Thanks. I'm just afraid that I won't be able to answer their questions.
🎧 Just answer them the best you can. Be confident.
🎧 Ok. I just need to relax.
🎧 What time is your interview?
🎧 In an hour. I better leave soon. I don't want to be late.
🎧 Yeah, don't be late. That would be a bad first impression.
🎧 You're right. Thanks for your advice and encouragement. I feel much better.
🎧 Good. Now go!
 
[174] Getting a Job
 
🎧 Hello?
🎧 Hi Helen. This is Cathy. I have great news!
🎧 What is it?
🎧 I got the job!
🎧 Congratulations! I knew you would get it.
🎧 Thanks! I'm so excited. I beat out 4 other applicants.
🎧 That's great! When is your first day of work?
🎧 Next Monday.
🎧 What are you going to do for the next few days?
🎧 I'm going to go shopping for some new suits. We have to dress nicely in the office.
🎧 Have you told anyone else yet?
🎧 No, I wanted to tell you first. You're my best friend.
🎧 Well, we should celebrate.
🎧 Ok! What should we do?
🎧 I'll buy you dinner.
🎧 You don't have to do that.
🎧 I know. But you can buy me dinner after you get your first paycheck.
🎧 That's a deal!
 
[175] Buying a Dishwasher
 
🎧 Do you know where I can buy a new dishwasher?
🎧 I think the home improvement store is having a big sale this weekend. Is your dishwasher broken?
🎧 Yeah. I need to replace it.
🎧 Have you tried to repair it?
🎧 Yeah, we called a repairman yesterday. He said that it would cost more to repair than to replace it.
🎧 Wow. At least he was honest about it.
🎧 I know. I appreciated that. We really can't afford to buy a new one right now. We just had a baby a couple of months ago. But I really need one.
🎧 That's right. You had a baby not too long ago. Why don't you buy a used one?
🎧 Where can I get a used one that's in good condition?
🎧 I actually have a friend who is selling hers. She said there isn't anything wrong with her current one. She just wants a different color. Her current one is white.
🎧 I don't care what color it is. I just want one that works well. Do you know how much it is?
🎧 I don't know. Let me call her right now.
🎧 Thanks. I'll talk to my husband too. He may not want a used one. He's a little picky about appliances.
🎧 Ok. Let me know if he's interested.
 
[176] Needing a New Refrigerator
 
🎧 Something is wrong with my refrigerator.
🎧 What's wrong with it?
🎧 It's not staying cold.
🎧 That could be a big problem.
🎧 I know. I'm worried that my food is going to spoil. I just went grocery shopping yesterday.
🎧 I have room in my second refrigerator if you need to store some things.
🎧 You have two refrigerators?
🎧 Yeah. We needed two refrigerators because I cook a lot. There was a big sale at the appliance store, so we bought another one last week.
🎧 Is the sale still going on? I may need to buy a new one.
🎧 Today is the last day of the sale.
🎧 Then I better tell my husband. We need to go today.
🎧 Isn't your husband a great repairman. Maybe he can fix your refrigerator.
🎧 It's getting old. I'd rather buy a new one.
🎧 If your husband can fix your broken one, you can have two refrigerators like me.
🎧 I don't cook that much.
 
[177] New Appliance Store
 
🎧 Hi Carol. There's a new appliance store opening downtown today. Have you seen the flyer for the grand opening?
🎧 Hi Joan. Yeah, I was thinking about checking it out.
🎧 Do you want to go together?
🎧 Sure. I don't need a new appliance, but I would love to update my washer and dryer one day.
🎧 I just bought a new washer and dryer set. I love it!
🎧 I'm jealous. My set is really old. It takes a long time to wash and dry.
🎧 You should really look into upgrading your set. It can save you money?
🎧 How can it save me money?
🎧 The new washers use less water and the dryers uses less energy.
🎧 Really? Maybe it's time for an upgrade.
🎧 I can show you what I bought.
🎧 That would great! Maybe it will be on sale.
🎧 I wish I knew about the new store when I bought my set. I paid full price for mine.
🎧 You didn't buy it on sale?
🎧 No, I was foolish.
🎧 I'm not jealous anymore.
🎧 Let's go check out the new store.
 
[178] Buying First Car
 
🎧 I am so excited today!
🎧 What's going on today?
🎧 I'm buying my first car.
🎧 That is exciting!
🎧 I've been saving money for the last couple of years and now I have enough to put a down payment on a car.
🎧 Are you going to buy a new or used car?
🎧 A new one.
🎧 Do you know which one you want?
🎧 Yeah, I have a picture of it on my phone.
🎧 That's nice!
🎧 But I want it in blue. Blue is my favorite color.
🎧 Make sure you negotiate a good deal.
🎧 I know. That's my problem. I'm not good at negotiating.
🎧 I'm great at it. Do you want me to go with you to the dealership?
🎧 That would be awesome!
🎧 Ok. I'll drive since you will be driving your car home today.
🎧 Let's go!
 
[179] Buying Daughter a Car
 
🎧 Hey Todd. What are you doing today?
🎧 Hey Bill. My wife and I are going to buy our daughter a car.
🎧 Wow! That's quite a gift!
🎧 I know. It's a graduation gift.
🎧 Are you going to buy a new or used car?
🎧 Used. It will be her first vehicle, so she doesn't need a brand new one.
🎧 I'm actually selling my car. Would you be interested?
🎧 Is it the red one?
🎧 Yeah, that's the one.
🎧 My daughter would love that car.
🎧 It's in great condition. I've taken good care of it.
🎧 How many miles does it have on it? And, how much do you want for it?
🎧 35,000 miles. $7,000.
🎧 That's pretty good. Why are you selling it?
🎧 My wife and I are having a baby. We need to get a bigger car.
🎧 Congratulations on your new baby!
🎧 Thanks. Would you like to take a look at the car?
🎧 Yeah. Can I take it for a test drive?
🎧 Of course.
 
[180] Talking to a Friend about a New Car
 
🎧 Hey Ashley! Is that your new car?
🎧 Yeah. I just got it yesterday.
🎧 That's nice! I love the color.
🎧 Me too. Green is my favorite color.
🎧 How do you like it?
🎧 I love it. It has great gas mileage and it has lot of cool features.
🎧 What is your favorite feature?
🎧 The sunroof.
🎧 Did you get a good deal?
🎧 Yeah. My cousin is a car salesman, so he helped me out.
🎧 I need to buy a new car soon. Do you think your cousin could help me too?
🎧 Of course, that's his job. And, he would love the commission.
🎧 Where does he work?
🎧 Downtown. I can go with you when you're ready to buy a car.
🎧 I need to save a little more money first. It's a big purchase.
🎧 I know. I don't think I can go out to dinner for a while.
🎧 Yeah, it's expensive to eat out all the time.
🎧 I better learn how to cook.
 
[181] Needing a New Computer
 
🎧 I think I need a new computer.
🎧 Why?
🎧 Mine is so slow now. It takes a long time to start up and it keeps freezing.
🎧 That's not good. How old is it?
🎧 Several years old. It was a high school graduation gift from my parents.
🎧 Yeah, it's probably time to replace it.
🎧 I don't know what to buy. There are so many different models these days.
🎧 You should go to a computer store and ask about the different kinds?
🎧 That's a good idea. Do you want to go with me?
🎧 When? I have to work today. Can you wait until tomorrow?
🎧 Sure. I have to work until 5 pm tomorrow. Can you go around 6 o'clock tomorrow evening?
🎧 Yeah. Let's meet at your place at 6 pm.
🎧 Ok. I'll do some research on computers tonight.
🎧 My brother just bought a brand new computer too. I can ask him if he likes it.
🎧 That would be great!
🎧 See you tomorrow around 6 pm.
 
[182] Getting a Cell Phone
 
🎧 I think I am finally going to get a cell phone.
🎧 You don't have a cell phone?
🎧 No. I didn't think it was necessary, but now I think I should get one.
🎧 What made you decide to get one now?
🎧 My car broke down in the middle of the road last night and I had to walk to the nearest pay phone to call a friend. It was scary walking alone at night.
🎧 Yeah, cell phones are very convenient. Do you know what kind you want to get?
🎧 Just a basic one. I don't need anything fancy.
🎧 Do you want a smartphone?
🎧 What is that?
🎧 You don't know what a smartphone is?
🎧 No. Can you explain it to me?
🎧 A smartphone is a cell phone that also has computer features. You have e-mail and Internet access.
🎧 I don't need those things. I don't even have an e-mail address.
🎧 You don't have an e-mail address?
🎧 No.
🎧 Then how do you send written communication to other people?
🎧 I write and mail letters.
🎧 Wow! That's amazing! People don't mail letters anymore.
🎧 But I think I will get a cell phone, just in case of an emergency.
🎧 That's a good idea! Welcome to modern technology, Ruth!
 
[183] Buying a Tablet
 
🎧 Hey Mark. What are you doing today?
🎧 I'm going to the electronics store with my son.
🎧 Are you buying a new TV?
🎧 No. My son has been saving money to buy a tablet. They're so expensive, so I told him I would pay for half of it.
🎧 That's so nice of you.
🎧 His birthday is next week, so this is his birthday present.
🎧 Why don't you buy one for yourself?
🎧 I already have one. My son really likes it. So, he wants one of his own.
🎧 Oh, I see. They're great. They're like mini computers. I love the touch screen feature.
🎧 I know. My son keeps taking mine. I'm tired of sharing it with him all the time.
🎧 Is that why you are helping him buy one?
🎧 Yes. Do you have one?
🎧 Yeah. I should get another one too.
🎧 Why?
🎧 My daughter keeps taking mine. Let me know if there are any sales.
 
[184] Buying a New Sofa
 
🎧 Hey Joe. What are you doing today?
🎧 Oh, hey Sam. I'm going furniture shopping with my wife.
🎧 Are you looking for anything special?
🎧 Yeah. We need a new sofa. Our old one is ripping.
🎧 We just bought a new sofa.
🎧 Did you get a good deal?
🎧 Yeah, it was on sale. You should go check it out.
🎧 Where did you go?
🎧 We went to the new store across the street.
🎧 I saw a flyer for that in the mail. I think that's where my wife wants to go.
🎧 If you bring the flyer, you get 10% off this weekend.
🎧 That's good to know! Thanks for telling me.
🎧 Do you know what kind of sofa you want?
🎧 Yeah. We want a dark brown leather sofa.
🎧 That's exactly what we bought.
🎧 Your wife and my wife must have the same taste in furniture.
 
[185] Furniture for Apartment
 
🎧 Mom, can we go furniture shopping?
🎧 Sure. What do you need to buy?
🎧 Something for my new apartment.
🎧 How do you like your first apartment? Do you like living alone?
🎧 Yes, it's great. But my apartment is so empty. I need some furniture to make it feel cozy.
🎧 What do you need?
🎧 I already have a bed and a sofa that you and Dad gave me. I need to buy a dining table and chairs.
🎧 Where do you sit to eat?
🎧 Right now, I eat on the sofa. But I'd like to invite people over for dinner and be able to dine comfortably.
🎧 Can you afford to buy a new dining table and chairs?
🎧 I have some money saved, but not a lot.
🎧 Why don't we try a yard sale? I always see people selling their dining room furniture at yard sales.
🎧 That's a great idea! Maybe if the furniture looks really old, I can get a good deal. I can just paint them.
🎧 Right! We should go today.
🎧 Yes! I'm excited to see what I can find.
🎧 Maybe I'll find something too.
 
[186] Making Furniture
 
🎧 Hey Carl, what are you doing with all that wood?
🎧 Hi Bill. I'm going to make a coffee table for Jill.
🎧 That's nice! You know how to build things with wood?
🎧 Yeah. We just got back from furniture shopping and the price of furniture is expensive.
🎧 So, you're going to make a coffee table instead of buying one?
🎧 That's right. Furniture is too expensive these days.
🎧 You're lucky you know how to build things.
🎧 My dad used to make furniture when he was younger. He taught me a lot.
🎧 Hey, could you make me something if I pay you?
🎧 Sure. What is it?
🎧 Carol has been asking for a new desk. Can you build a desk?
🎧 Yeah. I built a desk for my daughter when she was in college. She still has it.
🎧 How much would you charge me?
🎧 It depends on what kind of desk you want. Show me a picture later.
🎧 Ok! I'll ask Carol to find a picture.
🎧 Maybe I should quit being an accountant and go into furniture making instead.
 
[187] Vacuum Cleaner Gift
 
🎧 Hi John. What's wrong?
🎧 Sarah and I had an argument.
🎧 Why?
🎧 It's our anniversary today.
🎧 Why did you argue on your anniversary?
🎧 She didn't like the gift I got her.
🎧 What was it?
🎧 A vacuum cleaner.
🎧 A vacuum cleaner? That's not a very romantic gift.
🎧 That's what she said. Now she's mad at me.
🎧 Well, I can understand her.
🎧 It's a practical gift. Something she can use all the time.
🎧 What did she get you?
🎧 A watch.
🎧 That's a very nice gift.
🎧 It's a practical gift. Something I can use all the time.
🎧 That's really the same thing, John.
🎧 What should I do?
🎧 Return the vacuum and buy her jewelry.
 
[188] Buying a Present
 
🎧 Hello?
🎧 Hi Linda. This is Sharon. Do you have time for lunch today?
🎧 No, I have to go to the mall. I have to get a birthday present for Phil.
🎧 What are you going to get him?
🎧 I don't know. He seems to have everything.
🎧 Does he have a hobby?
🎧 Yeah. He loves golf, but he has everything he needs for golf.
🎧 What about clothes or shoes?
🎧 He has plenty of clothes and shoes.
🎧 Jewelry?
🎧 He doesn't wear jewelry.
🎧 Wow! I don't know what else to suggest.
🎧 That's what I mean. He has everything!
🎧 What are you going to do?
🎧 I don't know. I'm just going to go to the mall and hope I find something. Would you like to come with me?
🎧 Sure. We can grab lunch at the mall.
🎧 That's a good idea. We'll need a break from searching for his gift.
🎧 When is Phil's birthday?
🎧 Tomorrow.
🎧 Tomorrow? We better leave now.
 
[189] Trip Graduation Gift
 
🎧 Hi Carol. What are you doing at a travel agency? Are you planning a trip?
🎧 Oh Hi Cathy. My son is graduating college and Joe and I thought a trip would be a good graduation gift.
🎧 That's a great graduation gift! He's a lucky boy.
🎧 He's a good son, so Bob and I wanted to give him something special.
🎧 Where are you sending him?
🎧 China. He studied the Chinese language in college and really enjoyed learning about the culture.
🎧 Does he know anyone there?
🎧 My brother moved there last year for work. He is going to show him around.
🎧 That's nice. It will be more fun if he knows someone there.
🎧 Yeah. And it will be safer too.
🎧 Does he know about this trip?
🎧 No, it's going to be a surprise. So, if you see him, please don't mention anything.
🎧 I promise I won't.
🎧 Cathy, what are you doing here?
🎧 I'm planning a trip to Hawaii. Bill and I go every summer.
🎧 Now that's being really lucky!
 
[190] Back to School Shopping
 
🎧 Hi Jane. What are you doing today?
🎧 Hi Kathy. I'm going back-to-school shopping with the kids.
🎧 We did that last week.
🎧 Are there any good sales going on?
🎧 Yeah, the mall is having great sales.
🎧 Good. I need to buy clothes and shoes for my daughter. She has outgrown all of her clothes.
🎧 Really? My kids are still wearing the same size.
🎧 Jenny grew four inches during the summer.
🎧 Wow! That's amazing!
🎧 I know. She eats a lot these days.
🎧 Probably because she is growing. Do you need to buy school supplies, too?
🎧 Yeah, I will be shopping for clothes, shoes, and school supplies today.
🎧 I'm glad I'm done. The mall was really crowded last week. I think everyone is shopping for school.
🎧 I do not like crowds. We should've done this earlier. We always wait until the last minute every year.
🎧 Good luck! I hope you find everything you need.
🎧 Thanks. It's going to be a long day.
 
[191] Buying a Bike for Kid
 
🎧 Hi. How can I help you today?
🎧 I'm looking for a bike for my daughter.
🎧 How old is your daughter?
🎧 She is five years old. This will be her first bike.
🎧 We have lots of cute bikes for girls. Does she like a particular color?
🎧 Yes, her favorite color is purple.
🎧 We have a few purple bikes. Let me show you.
🎧 I really like this one. This has stars on it. She loves stars.
🎧 Would you like to add a basket to the front of the bike?
🎧 That would be wonderful. How much is this bike?
🎧 $50.
🎧 That's a little more than I wanted to spend. Do you have anything cheaper?
🎧 Unfortunately, this is one of the least expensive bikes we have.
🎧 I see.
🎧 This bike has an adjustable height. So, it will grow a few inches as your child grows.
🎧 That's a great feature. I think I will buy it. What is your return policy?
🎧 We have a 100% money-back guarantee.
🎧 What does that mean?
🎧 You can return it for a full refund if you are not satisfied with the product.
 
[192] Buying a Toy
 
🎧 Mom, can I get a new toy?
🎧 No, Billy. We're here to buy your cousin a birthday present.
🎧 Please, Mom.
🎧 No. Can you help me find something for your cousin? What does he like?
🎧 This toy helicopter.
🎧 I think that's what you like.
🎧 He'll like it too.
🎧 Are you sure?
🎧 Yeah. He and I like the same things.
🎧 Ok. Let's get him that helicopter.
🎧 I can play with it at his house. If I like it, then can I get one, too?
🎧 Maybe for your birthday.
🎧 Great! My birthday is next month.
🎧 You are a smart boy, Billy.
🎧 Thanks, Mom.
 
[193] Talking about a New Cell Phone
 
🎧 Hi Mike. What are you doing?
🎧 Hi James. I got a new cell phone. I'm reading the manual.
🎧 That's a nice phone.
🎧 Thanks. I really like it.
🎧 I need to get a new one too. My phone is old.
🎧 Would you like to look at my phone?
🎧 That would be great.
🎧 Be careful with it.
🎧 Don't worry. I will.
🎧 It is very light. It has a lot of functions.
🎧 I like your phone. How much did it cost?
🎧 It was expensive. It was $100.
🎧 Wow! That's too much for me. I think I will wait for a sale.
🎧 This was a gift from my parents. It was my birthday yesterday.
🎧 Oh, happy birthday!
🎧 Thanks!
🎧 Let's get some ice cream to celebrate.
🎧 Ok. I'm tired of reading this manual. I need a break.
 
[194] Replacing a Broken Cell Phone
 
🎧 Hello?
🎧 Hi Carol. This is Jane. What are you doing today?
🎧 I have to go to the mall. I broke my phone.
🎧 What happened?
🎧 I dropped it outside on the concrete ground.
🎧 Oh no! That's terrible.
🎧 I hope it can be fixed or I have to buy a new one.
🎧 Would you like me to go with you?
🎧 Sure. If they can't fix it, maybe you can help me pick out a new phone.
🎧 Ok. Do you want to have lunch together afterwards?
🎧 I don't think I will have time. I have to pick up my children from school at 3 pm.
🎧 How about tomorrow?
🎧 Tomorrow is better. Where do you want to go?
🎧 You pick the restaurant. It will be my treat since you're having a bad day.
🎧 Thanks! That's so nice of you.
🎧 My pleasure. Let's go check out the phone store.
 
[195] Buying a Cell Phone
 
🎧 Hi. How can I help you?
🎧 I would like to get a new phone.
🎧 Great! I can help you with that. What is your name?
🎧 John Taylor.
🎧 Ok, Mr. Taylor. My name is Simon. What kind of phone would you like?
🎧 I have a basic phone right now. I would like to upgrade.
🎧 Do you want a smart phone?
🎧 Yes. I would like to be able to check e-mails and surf the Internet.
🎧 Ok. We have many phones to choose from.
🎧 I would like something that is not too expensive.
🎧 Ok. We can find you something for sure.
🎧 I would also like a good camera.
🎧 What about this phone? It has many good features and it is on sale.
🎧 It feels a little heavy. Do you have anything lighter in weight?
🎧 How about this one? It is the same price as the other one.
🎧 This one seems nice. Does it come with a warranty?
🎧 Yes. If it stops working within one year, we will replace it for free.
🎧 That's great! I will get this one.
🎧 Wonderful. Is there anything else I can help you with?
🎧 No. You have been very helpful.
 
[196] Old Computer
 
🎧 Hello?
🎧 Hi Kate. This is Mary. Are you busy?
🎧 No. Why?
🎧 Do you know anything about computers?
🎧 It depends. What's the matter?
🎧 My computer is running really slow. I don't know what's going on.
🎧 Have you tried to restart it?
🎧 Yeah. But it's still slow.
🎧 Do you think it was infected by a virus?
🎧 I don't think so. I scanned it for viruses.
🎧 I think you should have a professional take a look at it.
🎧 Yeah. Maybe it's time to get a new computer. This one is really old.
🎧 How old is it?
🎧 Ten years?
🎧 Ten years. I think that's the problem.
🎧 I think you're right. I guess it's time to buy a new one.
🎧 We just bought a new one. It works great. Do you want to come over and take a look?
🎧 That would be wonderful. I'll be right over.
 
[197] Using a Public Computer
 
🎧 Hey Charlie. Why are you in such a hurry?
🎧 Hi Tim. I'm going to the school library.
🎧 I was just at the library. I had to check out some books. It was really crowded today.
🎧 My computer isn't working and I need to finish a report.
🎧 Good luck finding a spot. All the computers were taken when I was there.
🎧 Oh no! My report is due tomorrow.
🎧 Do you want to use my computer?
🎧 Are you done with your report?
🎧 Yeah. I stayed up all night to finish it.
🎧 I should've worked on it last night too.
🎧 Were you busy?
🎧 No. I fell asleep. I was so tired.
🎧 I'm heading home right now. Do you want to go with me?
🎧 That would be great! Can I buy you coffee?
🎧 Sure. After you finish your report.
🎧 Good idea!
 
[198] Computer Classes
 
🎧 Hello?
🎧 Hi Mom. This is Sarah. How are you doing today?
🎧 Hi Sarah. I'm fine. I'm working on my new computer.
🎧 Computer? Did you buy a one?
🎧 Yes. I signed up for a computer class for senior citizens.
🎧 That's great! Have you learned a lot of stuff?
🎧 Oh, yes. It's been really fun. I'm just learning the basics right now.
🎧 Do you get homework?
🎧 We have homework once a week. This week we have to type a short essay about ourselves.
🎧 Do you know how to open and save documents?
🎧 Yes. That's what we're learning.
🎧 Let me know if you need any help?
🎧 Actually, I'm not confident about editing yet. Can you help me?
🎧 Of course. I will come over tonight.
🎧 Ok. Do you want me to make you dinner?
🎧 No, Mom. I'll eat before I come over.
🎧 Ok. I'll make us dessert.
🎧 Sounds wonderful. See you around 8 pm.
 
[199] Breakfast with Grandparents
 
🎧 Lucy, can you help me with breakfast?
🎧 Sure, Mom? Is someone coming over this morning?
🎧 Your grandparents are coming.
🎧 Oh, how nice. What are we making?
🎧 Pancakes, eggs, bacon, and hash browns.
🎧 Yummy! That sounds delicious.
🎧 I hope so. Your grandfather has a big appetite. I hope there's enough food.
🎧 Mom, you always make too much food. It looks like a breakfast buffet every time they come over.
🎧 I want to make sure there is enough food. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.
🎧 Should I make freshly-squeezed orange juice?
🎧 That would be great. Do you know where the juicer is?
🎧 Yeah, it's on the top shelf of the pantry.
🎧 Oh no!
🎧 What's wrong, Mom?
🎧 I'm all out of eggs. Tell your Dad to go to the store and buy some eggs. I'll start on the bacon and hash browns.
🎧 Dad! Mom needs you to buy some eggs!
 
[200] Breakfast at Home or the Diners
 
🎧 Hey Kevin, do you want to try the new diner down the street?
🎧 Sure. I hear they have really good food especially their omelets.
🎧 Susan went their last weekend and said it was the best breakfast place in town.
🎧 Yeah, I heard the same thing from Janet. She waited an hour for a table.
🎧 I don't think I can wait an hour. I'm hungry right now.
🎧 Do you want to make breakfast at home?
🎧 Ok. What do you want to eat?
🎧 I'd like a ham and cheese omelet.
🎧 That sounds good. Do we have all of the ingredients?
🎧 Well, we only need eggs, ham, and cheese.
🎧 I think we may be out of ham. I used the last few slices for a sandwich yesterday.
🎧 Ok. How about a vegetable omelet?
🎧 That's good too. We have green peppers, mushrooms, and onions.
🎧 That's perfect.
🎧 Great! I'll brew some coffee and you make the omelet.
🎧 I don't know how to make an omelet.
🎧 You don't? Well, I don't either.
🎧 Let's just go to the new diner.
🎧 That sounds like a better plan.
 
[201] Pancake Breakfast
 
🎧 Hi Sally. My kids want to go out for breakfast this weekend. Do you have a favorite restaurant?
🎧 Hi Mary. Yeah, our favorite place is the pancake house on Main Street.
🎧 Oh, I haven't been there yet.
🎧 We love it. Kids eat free on their birthdays too.
🎧 What do your kids like there?
🎧 They love the chocolate chip pancakes.
🎧 Oh, my children would love those. They like anything with chocolate.
🎧 I like their waffles. They're thick and fluffy. They put fresh strawberries over them.
🎧 I may want to try that. I'm getting hungry now.
🎧 Me too.
🎧 Would you like to join us on Saturday morning?
🎧 I can't on Saturday. Joanne has a soccer game in the morning. What about Sunday?
🎧 We have church in the morning, but we are free around 10 am.
🎧 10 am is good for us too.
🎧 Ok. Let's meet on Sunday at 10 am at the restaurant.
🎧 That sounds wonderful.
 
[202] Preparing Dinner for Guests
 
🎧 Hey Sue. What are you doing today?
🎧 Hey Alice. I'm going to the market later. My husband's boss and his wife are coming over for dinner tonight.
🎧 Wow! What are you making?
🎧 I don't know. His wife is a vegetarian, so I need to make one dish without meat.
🎧 My mother-in-law is a vegetarian. I can ask her for some recipes.
🎧 That would be great. I'm a little nervous about hosting dinner.
🎧 You shouldn't worry. You're a great cook.
🎧 I've never cooked for Jeff's boss before. I want to make sure everything is perfect.
🎧 I understand. I cooked for my boss once. It was a disaster. I burned the roast beef.
🎧 Oh no! What happened?
🎧 I was too busy talking and forgot to take it out of the oven. We all laughed, but I was so embarrassed.
🎧 I'll make sure to use a timer.
🎧 Great idea!
🎧 I think I will make lasagna.
🎧 Your lasagna is delicious. My mother-in-law makes great vegetarian lasagna. I'll call her right now.
🎧 Thank you so much! I'll go the market after you talk to her.
🎧 Good luck tonight.
 
[203] Dinner with Grandparents
 
🎧 Ethan, get ready. We're going to your grandparents' house for dinner.
🎧 Again? We went there last weekend.
🎧 That's right. Remember we go every Sunday evening.
🎧 But grandma's food tastes weird.
🎧 Don't be rude. She loves to cook for us.
🎧 I know. I love them. But she always makes the same dish, chicken pot pie.
🎧 Your grandfather likes it. It's his favorite, so we're going to eat it too.
🎧 Ok, Mom. Sorry for being rude.
🎧 Why don't we pick up a dessert on the way to their house?
🎧 Ok! Can we get ice cream?
🎧 Sure. We can make ice cream sundaes after dinner.
🎧 Mom, that's funny.
🎧 What's funny?
🎧 Sundaes on Sundays.
🎧 That is funny. This will be our new tradition.
🎧 Grandpa will love it. He loves ice cream too.
 
[204] No Time to Eat
 
🎧 Hey Jane. Did you eat lunch?
🎧 No, I don't have time. I have a big test today at 1 pm.
🎧 You still need to eat or you won't have energy for the test.
🎧 I know. I'll grab something on the way to class.
🎧 Fast food?
🎧 Yeah, I'll grab a burger.
🎧 That's not healthy for you. Let me make you something to eat.
🎧 Thanks. But I don't have time.
🎧 You never have the time to eat a proper meal anymore.
🎧 I like fast food meals anyway. They're quick and easy.
🎧 Let me pack you some fruits.
🎧 Mom, please. I'm in college now. I can cut my own fruits.
🎧 But you won't do it.
🎧 I'll take this banana. It's quick and easy. See you later, Mom.
🎧 Eat something nutritious!
 
[205] Quick Bite to Eat
 
🎧 Hey Jesse, should we grab a bite to eat before the concert?
🎧 Yeah, I'm getting a little hungry.
🎧 Let's get some fast food here.
🎧 Burgers and fries?
🎧 Yeah, that sounds good.
🎧 Why is the drive-thru line so long?
🎧 It's dinner time. Should we go inside?
🎧 It might be busier inside?
🎧 Looks like the line is really long inside too.
🎧 Let's head to another place.
🎧 Can we go to one closer to the concert arena?
🎧 That's a good idea!
🎧 There are many fast food places around there.
🎧 Yeah, we should be able to find one that's not too crowded.
🎧 Fast food is great. Fast and cheap.
🎧 But not very healthy.
 
[206] Working at a Fast Food Place
 
🎧 Hey Sam. What was your first job?
🎧 I worked at a fast food restaurant.
🎧 Did you like it?
🎧 It was ok. It was always busy.
🎧 What did you do there?
🎧 I took orders at the counter and sometimes at the drive-thru window.
🎧 Was it fun?
🎧 It wasn't fun. It was just a job. We had to work fast.
🎧 I need to find a job. I was thinking about applying at a fast food restaurant.
🎧 It's a good place to learn how to work quickly.
🎧 I'm a fast learner and I can move pretty quickly.
🎧 Also, it's a good place to learn how to handle customers.
🎧 I don't have any customer service experience.
🎧 They will train you. You just have to be polite and listen well.
🎧 I can do that.
🎧 You should apply then.
🎧 Did you get to eat a lot of the food?
🎧 I ate too much fast food working there. I got sick of it.
🎧 I love fast food. I may eat it every day.
🎧 That's probably not a good thing.
 
[207] Planning for Lunch with Friend
 
🎧 Hello?
🎧 Hi Joan. This is Karen. Are you free for lunch today?
🎧 Hi Karen. No, I'm having lunch with my mom. It's her birthday today.
🎧 What about tomorrow?
🎧 I'm free tomorrow. Where should we go?
🎧 There's a new Chinese restaurant downtown.
🎧 I love Chinese food! Let's check it out.
🎧 Do you think we should make reservations.
🎧 Yeah, that might be a good idea.
🎧 Should we invite anyone else?
🎧 Sure. How about Cathy and Lisa?
🎧 Lisa is out of town. Let's invite Cathy and Sharon.
🎧 Ok. What time should we meet tomorrow?
🎧 Noon?
🎧 Noon is perfect.
🎧 Good. I'll call Cathy and Sharon right now.
🎧 Hopefully, then can meet at noon too.
🎧 If they can't, I'll let you know.
 
[208] Talking about your Lunch
 
🎧 Hey Steve, what did your mom pack for your lunch today?
🎧 Hey Bobby. She packs me the same lunch every day. A peanut butter and jelly sandwich, cookies, and milk.
🎧 I got something new today. It looks like a tuna sandwich. I'm not sure I like it.
🎧 I love tuna sandwiches. Do you want to trade?
🎧 Sure! But will your mom get mad?
🎧 No. She won't know. I won't tell her.
🎧 Do you ever buy the school lunch?
🎧 No, it looks gross.
🎧 It's actually not bad. Some dishes are pretty good.
🎧 Which ones have you tried?
🎧 The spaghetti and pizza are good. But the hamburgers and burritos are terrible. They taste like cardboard.
🎧 That's awful! Maybe I'll buy lunch when the cafeteria serves spaghetti and pizza. Those are my favorite dishes at home.
🎧 They're pretty good, but not as good as our moms' cooking.
🎧 Are you done with lunch? Let's go out to recess.
🎧 Yeah. Let's go!
 
[209] Lunch Decisions
 
🎧 Hey Bill, are you hungry?
🎧 Oh, hi Kathy. Yeah. Let's have lunch.
🎧 What do you want to eat?
🎧 How about pizza?
🎧 We always have pizza. Let's try something different.
🎧 Ok. Do you have any suggestions?
🎧 How about sushi?
🎧 I don't like raw fish.
🎧 All sushi isn't raw.
🎧 I know. I just don't feel like having sushi today.
🎧 Ok. Then what should we eat?
🎧 Maybe we should just order take-out. You get sushi and I'll get pizza.
🎧 That's a good idea. But I think I want Chinese food instead.
🎧 Chinese food sounds yummy.
🎧 Hey, we agree on something. Let's go out to a Chinese restaurant.
🎧 I'd rather eat at home.
🎧 We never agree on anything.
 
[210] Trying Different Restaurants
 
🎧 Do you want to try a new restaurant tonight?
🎧 Sure. I'm kind of getting sick of the same place.
🎧 Me too. What kind of food do you want to eat?
🎧 Do you want to try Indian?
🎧 Ok. I've never had Indian food before, so you'll have to choose the place.
🎧 I've never had it before either.
🎧 Then why do you want to go there?

🎧 That's a good idea.
🎧 There are many restaurants we haven't tried.
🎧 Should we try a new one each week?
🎧 Yeah. That will be fun.
🎧 Ok, so we'll have Indian tonight.
🎧 What about next week?
