[098] Going to the Zoo

🎧 Hey Steve. My family and I want to do something fun this weekend? Do you have any suggestions?
🎧 The weather is going to be nice. You should do something outdoors.
🎧 Yeah, it's supposed to be sunny all weekend.
🎧 How about a picnic at the park?
🎧 We do that often. I want to do something more fun.
🎧 How about the city zoo? I heard that bear cubs were recently born there.
🎧 That's a good idea. We haven't been to the zoo in a long time.
🎧 Then you should definitely go this weekend.
🎧 The last time we were there, it started raining. None of the animals wanted to come out.
🎧 That must've been boring.
🎧 It was boring. The kids wanted to go home early.
🎧 The animals should be more visible since the weather is going to be sunny this weekend.
🎧 Yeah. I think we will go to the zoo. Hopefully, this time it'll be more fun.
🎧 Actually, I have four tickets to the zoo. You can have them. Our family won't be able to go. The tickets expire this weekend.
🎧 Thanks, Steve! Let me pay you for them. Zoo tickets are expensive.
🎧 Don't worry about it. It's my gift to you since your last visit was not fun.
🎧 Are you sure! This is very generous of you.
🎧 Also, you mowed my lawn a few times after I had back surgery last year. I really appreciated that.
🎧 I'm glad we're neighbors.
 
[099] Going to the Beach
 
🎧 Carl. Are you going to watch television all day?
🎧 No. Is there something you want to do?
🎧 It's a beautiful day. The sun is shining. We should do something outdoors.
🎧 Ok. What should we do?
🎧 Let's go to the beach.
🎧 OK. I'll grab the beach chairs and towels.
🎧 Great! I'll pack some snacks and drinks. Don't forget the sunscreen.
🎧 Where is it?
🎧 It's in the bathroom cabinet.
🎧 Is there anything else we need to bring?
🎧 I'll bring the camera. I want to take pictures of the sunset.
🎧 Good idea! The sunset is beautiful at the beach.
🎧 Do you remember the last time we went to the beach?
🎧 No. It's been a long time. Why don't we go more often?
🎧 Because you're always watching TV.
🎧 Ok. Let's go to the beach when the weather is nice and watch TV when it rains.
🎧 That's a deal!
 
[100] Going to the Amusement Park
 
🎧 Hi Sheila. Have you been to the new amusement park yet?
🎧 No. When did it open?
🎧 Last weekend.
🎧 Was it crowded?
🎧 It was very crowded. Parking is terrible too.
🎧 Did you have fun?
🎧 Oh yes! The roller coasters are really fun. My kids had a great time. It was even fun for the adults too.
🎧 I didn't know it was open yet. I will have to take my son soon.
🎧 You should. They will love it.
🎧 Are the tickets expensive?
🎧 Yeah, they're pretty expensive. But your family will enjoy it.
🎧 Maybe we'll go this weekend. We don't have any plans on Saturday. My son has been asking about it.
🎧 If you go on Saturday, try to go early. There aren't enough parking spots. They need to add more.
🎧 Ok. That's good to know. Do you have any other tips?
🎧 The lines for the rides are very long, so be patient.
🎧 Ok. I assumed that. Now I have to convince my husband to go.
🎧 He doesn't like amusement parks?
🎧 No. I have motion sickness, so I can't ride any of the roller coasters. That means my husband has to ride all of them with our son.
🎧 Tell him to be prepared. There are a lot of roller coasters.
 
[101] Afternoon Picnic
 
🎧 Mom, can we have a picnic this afternoon?
🎧 Sure, Cathy. Where should we have it?
🎧 How about the lake?
🎧 That's a great idea.
🎧 What should we pack for lunch?
🎧 I can make ham sandwiches and potato salad.
🎧 Yummy. I love ham sandwiches and potato salad.
🎧 Tell your sisters about the picnic.
🎧 Ok. I think it is going to get hot later today.
🎧 That's good. It will be a good day for a swim in the lake.
🎧 I'll tell Cindy and Alison to wear their swimsuits.
🎧 Don't forget to pack your life jackets too.
🎧 Ok. Will Andy be joining us?
🎧 Of course, your brother will be joining us. Where is he?
🎧 He's taking a nap on the couch.
🎧 Let's wake him up.
🎧 You can wake him up. I'll get my sisters.
🎧 Andy, wake up. We're going to the lake.
 
[102] Picnic by the Lake
 
🎧 Hi Mike. What are you doing today?
🎧 Hi Joe. My family and I are going to the lake. We're going to have picnic.
🎧 That sounds like fun.
🎧 Do you want to join us?
🎧 May I? I would love to join.
🎧 Sure. We are leaving at 10:30.
🎧 Ok. Let me ask my parents. What should I bring?
🎧 You should pack swim trunks and a life jacket.
🎧 Ok. How about food?
🎧 My parents are going to pack some food. There will be plenty for you too.
🎧 Thanks. I'll be back as soon as possible.
🎧 Try to come back before 10:30.
🎧 I will. If I can't go, I will call you.
🎧 I hope you can come with us.
🎧 Me too. I have no plans today.
🎧 See you soon.
🎧 I hope so!
 
[103] Going to the Lake
 
🎧 Dad, what are we doing today?
🎧 Cathy, it's a surprise.
🎧 Is it a special occasion?
🎧 No. Just a short family trip.
🎧 Does Mom know?
🎧 Of course. It was her idea.
🎧 Where is Mom?
🎧 She is at the store getting things for our trip.
🎧 I'm so curious. Can you please tell me?
🎧 No. You have to be patient.
🎧 Ok. Can I help you with anything?
🎧 Sure. Why don't you pack your swimsuit and life jacket?
🎧 I know what we're doing!
🎧 You do?
🎧 Yes. We're going to the lake!
🎧 How did you know?
🎧 You asked me to pack a swimsuit and a life jacket. Also, you are pulling out the canoe from the garage.
🎧 It looks like I can't keep a secret.
 
[104] Fishing with Dad
 
🎧 Dad, what are we doing this weekend?
🎧 I have a surprise for you, Timothy.
🎧 What is it?
🎧 Here. Open it.
🎧 I think I know what it is?
🎧 Can you tell by the shape?
🎧 Yeah. Is it a fishing pole?
🎧 Well, open it up and find out.
🎧 It is! I love it. I've never gone fishing before.
🎧 Your grandfather and I used to go fishing when I was a child. Now, I can take you.
🎧 I can't wait!
🎧 You also need a life jacket.
🎧 Why?
🎧 You should always wear a life jacket if you're going in a boat.
🎧 Ok, dad.
🎧 Now let's go to the fishing store and buy some bait.
🎧 What's bait?
🎧 Things that will attract the fish to the hook.
🎧 Like worms?
🎧 Exactly!
🎧 This is going to be so much fun!
 
[105] Fishing with Buddies
 
🎧 Hey Phil, I'm so glad it's Friday.
🎧 I agree, James. It was a stressful work week.
🎧 Have any fun plans this weekend?
🎧 Yeah, I'm going fishing with my buddies.
🎧 Lucky!
🎧 Do you want to join us?
🎧 I can't. I'm helping my brother move. He recently bought a house.
🎧 That's too bad. We're going to have beautiful weather too.
🎧 I'm glad we're going to have good weather. I don't want to move boxes and furniture in the rain.
🎧 That's true. When are you going to be done?
🎧 I don't know. He has a lot of stuff. It could be all day.
🎧 Well, if you get done early, why don't you meet us at the lake?
🎧 Are you going out on a boat?
🎧 No, we're going to fish on the lake shore. None of us have a boat.
🎧 My brother has a boat. I can ask him if we can borrow it sometime.
🎧 That would be awesome! Thanks!
🎧 Well, I'm going to head home now. I'm tired.
🎧 Yeah. Me too. Call me this weekend if you get done early.
 
[106] Talking about Fishing
 
🎧 Hey John! Did you see the fish Sam just caught?
🎧 No. What did he catch? How big was it?
🎧 A 20 pound salmon.
🎧 Wow! I've been here all day and have caught nothing. Have you caught anything?
🎧 Yeah, just a couple of small trout.
🎧 That's better than me. I just want to give up and go home.
🎧 Don't give up. You might catch something soon.
🎧 My wife told me to bring home dinner.
🎧 Fish?
🎧 Yeah. I may have to go to the market and buy one.
🎧 That's silly. Just wait.
🎧 The sun is starting to set and I'm tired of being out here.
🎧 At least it didn't rain today. We had clear skies all day.
🎧 That's true. It was nice today. Hey, can you hold my fishing pole? I need to go to the restroom.
🎧 Sure. Wait, John!
🎧 Steve, what?
🎧 Something is pulling on your fishing pole! Here, grab it!
🎧 Wow! That's a huge salmon!
🎧 I told you to be patient and you would catch something.
🎧 Now I can take home dinner. Want to come over and have salmon with us?
 
[107] Hiking Injury
 
🎧 Hey Joe. What happened to your ankle?
🎧 Hey Kevin. I broke it while hiking last weekend.
🎧 That's terrible. How?
🎧 We were hiking down a steep trail. I lost my balance and fell.
🎧 Ouch!
🎧 Yeah, it hurt badly.
🎧 How did you get back to your car?
🎧 It was a long, painful walk.
🎧 Were you alone?
🎧 No, I was with my wife. But I'm too heavy for her to carry me.
🎧 Why didn't you call someone?
🎧 There was no cell phone coverage in that area.
🎧 How long do you have to wear your cast?
🎧 Six weeks.
🎧 Six weeks? Are you going to miss the marathon next month?
🎧 Yeah! Looks like I am. I'm so disappointed. I've been training for that for a year. Why don't you go in my place?
🎧 No, thanks. Do you know what I hate more than hiking?
🎧 What?
🎧 Marathons!
 
[108] Hiking for Beginners
 
🎧 Hey Sue. What are you doing this weekend?
🎧 Hi Sandy. I'm going hiking with some friends. Do you want join?
🎧 No, that's ok. I've never gone hiking before.
🎧 Really? It's a lot of fun and great exercise.
🎧 It sounds fun and good for you.
🎧 It is. You should come.
🎧 I don't even have the correct shoes.
🎧 I have an extra pair. What size do you wear?
🎧 I wear a size 7.
🎧 What a coincidence! Me too!
🎧 What else do I need?
🎧 Comfortable clothes, a jacket, a water bottle, snacks, a flashlight, and a map.
🎧 Wow! That's a lot of stuff to bring.
🎧 Do you have a small backpack to put these items in?
🎧 Yeah.
🎧 Well then, you are ready to go.
🎧 How long are you going to be hiking?
🎧 We usually hike about 10 miles, but this weekend we're going to hike a much shorter distance.
🎧 Why?
🎧 My friend is bringing her sister. She has never gone hiking before either. So, it'll be a fun experience for the both of you.
 
[109] Borrowing Things from a Friend
 
🎧 Hello?
🎧 Mike. This is Dan. Do you have a lantern I can borrow?
🎧 I think so. I have to check.
🎧 Our lantern is broken.
🎧 What do you need a lantern for?
🎧 We are going camping this weekend.
🎧 We went camping last month.
🎧 How was the weather last month?
🎧 It was great! Sunny all weekend.
🎧 I think it is going to rain this weekend.
🎧 That's not good. Why are you going camping if it's going to rain?
🎧 The kids still want to go.
🎧 I'm sure you will still have fun.
🎧 I hope so. We're going to pack some extra clothes.
🎧 Let me check on that lantern.
🎧 Mike.
🎧 What's wrong, Dan?
🎧 Do you have a tent I can borrow?
🎧 Sure. Why?
🎧 I just discovered a hole in our tent.
 
[110] Family Camping
 
🎧 Susan, what should we do this weekend?
🎧 I don't know. What would you like to do?
🎧 Should we take the kids camping.
🎧 That sounds like a fun plan.
🎧 Do you know what the weather forecast for this weekend?
🎧 No. I have to check.
🎧 I think it is supposed to be sunny and clear.
🎧 That's perfect weather for camping.
🎧 We can go fishing too.
🎧 The kids are going to love it.
🎧 Let's not tell them yet.
🎧 Why?
🎧 I need to make a reservation. There may not be space available.
🎧 Oh yeah. We better think of another option just in case.
🎧 Yeah. How about going to the beach?
🎧 That would be fun too.
🎧 Let me try to make a reservation for camping first.
🎧 Ok. Here's the number.
 
[111] Going Fishing
 
🎧 Billy, are you all packed?
🎧 No, Dad. I can't find my fishing pole.
🎧 Where did you see it last?
🎧 In the garage. I'll look again.
🎧 Ok. I'm almost done packing too. I just need to load the tents into the car.
🎧 I found my fishing pole. It was behind the skis.
🎧 Good. What is your mom doing?
🎧 She is packing food and snacks into the ice chest.
🎧 Hopefully, we will catch some fish to eat too.
🎧 Yeah. Dad, where is your fishing pole?
🎧 I forgot it. Thanks for reminding me.
🎧 Are we going to the same campsite?
🎧 No. I want to try a new place.
🎧 Cool. Can I bring my camera?
🎧 Of course. But be careful not to lose it.
🎧 I'll be careful. I want to take a lot of pictures.
🎧 Make sure to take pictures of our fish.
🎧 I hope we catch big ones. I love camping and fishing.
🎧 I love spending time as a family.
 
[112] Looking for Airline Deals
 
🎧 Hi Carol. Have you seen any airline deals lately?
🎧 Hi Ruth. No, I haven't. Are you planning a trip?
🎧 Yeah. Stan and I want to visit our daughter in London. She moved there last year.
🎧 Why?
🎧 Her job was transferred there.
🎧 Does she like living there?
🎧 She loves living in England. She wants us to visit, but the airfare is very expensive.
🎧 Have you called any travel agencies? Sometimes they have special deals.
🎧 I've called travel agencies and looked online, but everything is expensive.
🎧 Yeah, airfare is getting more and more expensive every year.
🎧 I know. You travel a lot. Where do you buy your airplane tickets?
🎧 My traveling is for work. My company pays for the tickets.
🎧 That's nice.
🎧 Yeah. One of my business trips was to Hawaii. I got to fly in First Class.
🎧 That's amazing! We rarely travel by plane. I'd rather take the train.
🎧 Well, you can't take the train across the ocean.
🎧 I wish we could.
 
[113] Planning a Boat Trip
 
🎧 Hi Jane. Isn't it a beautiful day?
🎧 Hi Sarah. Yeah, it's sunny and clear. I think we're going to take our boat out.
🎧 It's a great day for it.
🎧 Would you and Paul like to join us?
🎧 I would love to. I need to ask Paul. He's at the store. He should be home in a few minutes.
🎧 Great! We can pack a lunch and eat on the boat.
🎧 Sounds like fun. I've never been on a boat before.
🎧 You haven't? Do you get seasick?
🎧 I've never been on a boat so I wouldn't know.
🎧 Do you get airsick? Do you have any kind of motion sickness?
🎧 I don't think so. I don't get sick on planes or trains or long car rides.
🎧 That's good. Then you'll probably be ok on the boat.
🎧 Are you really worried about me being seasick?
🎧 Yes and there is a reason why.
🎧 What is it?
🎧 Tom and I took my friend out on our boat once and she got very sick. I felt terrible for her.
🎧 Oh, I see. I should be ok.
🎧 What about Paul?
🎧 He used to be a fisherman. He is definitely not going to be seasick.
 
[114] Train Ride
 
🎧 What are you doing this weekend?
🎧 We're going to take the train to my mother's house.
🎧 That should be fun.
🎧 Yeah. We usually drive, but we decided to take the train this time.
🎧 Why?
🎧 My son loves trains, so I thought it would be a good idea to take the train up there.
🎧 Does he have a train set?
🎧 Oh yes. He has several trains and Jason built him a big wooden train track.
🎧 Then he's going to love this ride.
🎧 I know. We haven't told him yet. It's going to be a surprise.
🎧 I remember riding the train as a child. It was a lot of fun.
🎧 One of his toy trains looks just like the train we're going to take.
🎧 Make sure to take a picture of it.
🎧 That's a great idea. I'll frame it and hang it on his bedroom wall.
🎧 Have a great train ride!
 
[115] Lost Reservation
 
🎧 Mary, I am so angry!
🎧 What happened, Susan?
🎧 Our hotel lost our reservations?
🎧 How did that happen?
🎧 I don't know. They didn't have a reasonable explanation.
🎧 Well, can't you just make another reservation?
🎧 No. They said there are no more rooms available.
🎧 Oh no! That's terrible.
🎧 We are attending my niece's wedding this weekend and everyone is staying at that hotel.
🎧 What about another hotel in that area.
🎧 There's going to be a big doctor's conference this weekend. There are no rooms available at any of the nearby hotels.
🎧 Did the hotel apologize?
🎧 Yes and they offered us a discount on our next visit.
🎧 Did you accept it?
🎧 No. I was so mad. I told them that I would never stay at a place that lost our original reservations.
🎧 What did they say?
🎧 They just kept apologizing.
🎧 What are you going to do?
🎧 I don't know. My niece is very upset. Our daughter is the photographer.
 
[116] Great Hotel Experience
 
🎧 Hi Alice. How did you like the hotel?
🎧 It was lovely, Barbara. The rooms were spacious and clean.
🎧 Did you get a good deal on it?
🎧 Yeah. They had an online special. If you reserved a room three weeks early, you got 20% off the regular room rate.
🎧 That's a good deal.
🎧 The swimming pool and spa were really nice too. The swimming pool was warm. There was also a sauna.
🎧 Oh, that's very nice. Joe loves saunas. I need to tell him about this place.
🎧 The parking is free and so is the Wi-Fi.
🎧 That's good to know.
🎧 There's a shuttle bus that takes you to the downtown area where all of the shops and restaurants are. It was very convenient.
🎧 Anything else?
🎧 The concierge was very helpful and the front desk clerks were very nice.
🎧 Sounds like it was a wonderful place to stay.
🎧 It was. I would recommend this place to everyone.
🎧 Is there a restaurant in the hotel?
🎧 Yes. They have great food. It's a little expensive, but very delicious. They have a fantastic breakfast buffet every morning too.
🎧 Wow! I'm definitely going to make a reservation here.
🎧 I can't wait to go back.
 
[117] Bad Hotel Experience
 
🎧 How was the hotel?
🎧 It was awful. We had to switch rooms a couple of times.
🎧 Why?
🎧 Well, we found bugs in the carpet in one room. We had already unpacked. So, we had to re-pack everything and ask for another room.
🎧 What was wrong with the second room?
🎧 We paid for a garden room and it was a view of the parking lot.
🎧 That's terrible. Did you finally get a good room?
🎧 They were out of garden view rooms, so they upgraded us to an ocean view room.
🎧 That's nice! So, why was it so awful?
🎧 Our next door neighbor snored so loudly. He kept us awake every night.
🎧 Did you ask for another room?
🎧 Yes, but they said that there were no more rooms available.
🎧 I'm sorry you had a terrible time.
🎧 That's ok. The manager was really nice about it. He offered us a free stay next time.
🎧 Are you going to go back there?
🎧 Of course. It'll be free.
 
[118] New Friend at School
 
🎧 Jane, how was school today?
🎧 Mom, it was fun. I made a new friend.
🎧 That's nice. What's her name?
🎧 Her name is Cindy.
🎧 Is she new to your school?
🎧 Yeah, she's a new student. She moved here from Seattle, Washington.
🎧 You have an aunt who lives in Seattle.
🎧 I know. I like Seattle. It's beautiful there, but it rains too much.
🎧 Yeah. That's why we're staying in sunny California.
🎧 Cindy and I have a lot in common. We both like drawing, playing with dogs, and eating pizza.
🎧 You should invite her over for dinner one night.
🎧 Can we, Mom?
🎧 Sure. We can order pizza.
🎧 Maybe I'll ask her if she can come over on Friday.
🎧 Ok. Let's invite her parents too. We can get to know them.
🎧 That's a good idea. They don't have any friends here, yet.
 
[119] Meeting Someone at the Apartment
 
🎧 Hi. Are you new to the apartment building?
🎧 Yes. My name is Monica.
🎧 Nice to meet you, Monica. My name is Paul. I live on the third floor, apartment number 305.
🎧 I live on the fourth floor in 405.
🎧 Hey, you live right above me.
🎧 That's funny. I hope I'm not too noisy. I've been moving furniture around.
🎧 That's ok. It doesn't bother me. Have you met any of the other neighbors?
🎧 I met a few people. Everyone seems friendly here.
🎧 Yeah. Every month, we have a party on the rooftop. It's a potluck, so you can bring a dish to share.
🎧 That sounds fun! I love parties and potlucks.
🎧 Our next one is on Saturday at 5 pm. You should come. I'm bringing my famous pasta salad.
🎧 Sounds delicious. I'll make a chocolate cake.
🎧 I love chocolate cake. I can't wait to try it.
🎧 Thanks for letting me know about the party.
🎧 There should be an invitation in your mailbox. Everyone gets one.
🎧 I better check the mailbox then. I still have so much unpacking to do.
🎧 Do you need help moving any more furniture?
🎧 No. My brother helped me last night. I'm done with the big items. I just need to unpack pots and pans and dishes now.
🎧 Ok. Let me know if you need help. See you at the party.
 
[120] Riding School Bus with Friend
 
🎧 Hi Billy, how was your first day at a new school?
🎧 It was ok, Mom.
🎧 Did you make any new friends?
🎧 Yeah. A boy in my class.
🎧 Is he nice? What's his name?
🎧 He's cool. His name is Brian. He plays soccer.
🎧 You love soccer. You were on the soccer team at your old school.
🎧 Yeah, I miss my old team with Ted, Mark, and Richard.
🎧 I know you do. Do you want to invite Brian over to play one day?
🎧 Sure. He rides the school bus on our street.
🎧 Do you want to start riding the school bus too.
🎧 Yeah. Then I can meet more of the neighborhood kids.
🎧 Ok. Let's plan for you to ride the bus tomorrow morning.
🎧 Brian said the bus comes at 7:45.
🎧 Then you need to wake up at 7 o'clock.
🎧 I know. I'll set my alarm. 
 
[121] Misunderstanding
 
🎧 Hey Joe. Have you seen Sandy?
🎧 No, Bill. Why?
🎧 We had a misunderstanding and she is not talking to me.
🎧 Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.
🎧 Yeah. I said something silly and hurt her feelings.
🎧 What did you say?
🎧 It's not important. I don't want to discuss it. I just want to apologize to her.
🎧 She always hangs out at Linda's house or the library.
🎧 I've already checked both places.
🎧 How about her house.
🎧 Her roommate said she wasn't home.
🎧 Have you called her cell phone.
🎧 Yeah, several times.
🎧 She must really be mad at you.
🎧 She was! She stormed off and I didn't get to explain what I meant.
🎧 I'm really curious now. What did you say to her?
🎧 I told her to exercise.
🎧 Well, that probably wasn't a smart thing to say to a woman.
🎧 I meant that she should exercise to stay healthy.
🎧 That sounds better. Hope you find her.
 
[122] Buying a New Necklace
 
🎧 Hi Sally. What are you doing here?
🎧 Hey Susie. I need to buy my sister a new necklace. I accidentally lost her necklace and she is really mad at me now.
🎧 But you said it was an accident.
🎧 Yeah, but I didn't ask if I could borrow it.
🎧 Oh, that's not good.
🎧 She wasn't home and it looked nice with my outfit, so I wore it.
🎧 That's like stealing.
🎧 I know. I feel terrible. I was going to put it back when I got home.
🎧 How did you lose it?
🎧 I don't know. I was on my way home and I noticed it was gone.
🎧 Was it an expensive necklace?
🎧 I don't know. I'm looking for a replacement here.
🎧 What does it look like?
🎧 It's a gold butterfly.
🎧 Like this one?
🎧 That's it! That's exactly like hers? How much is it?
🎧 The price tag says $100.
🎧 Wow! That's expensive. Now I see why she was really mad.
🎧 Are you going to buy it?
🎧 Yeah. That's all the money I have until my next paycheck.
 
[123] Argument with Roommate
 
🎧 Hey Nancy, why do you look so worried?
🎧 Oh, hi Betty. Christine and I had a big argument and she has decided to move out.
🎧 What did you argue about?
🎧 I told her that she needs to help clean up around the apartment.
🎧 What happened after you told her that?
🎧 She got upset and said she is moving out. But it's the truth. She never helps around house.
🎧 Yeah, that could be a problem.
🎧 I had to say something since we're roommates and I'm tired of cleaning her mess.
🎧 I totally understand. I like things neat and organized too.
🎧 But the bigger problem is that she never pays her rent on time. She is late every month.
🎧 What are you going to do?
🎧 I need to find a roommate soon. I can't afford the rent by myself. Do you know anyone looking for a roommate?
🎧 Yes, I do.
🎧 Who?
🎧 Me.
🎧 That would be awesome!
 
[124] Planning to Hangout
 
🎧 Hello?
🎧 Hi John. This is Steven. What are you doing tonight?
🎧 Hey Steven. Nothing much. I don't have any plans yet.
🎧 Do you want to hang out?
🎧 Sure. What did you have in mind?
🎧 I don't know. It's Friday and I'm bored.
🎧 Want to go to the movies?
🎧 Is there a good movie to see?
🎧 Let's check the Internet.
🎧 Ok. Let me log onto my computer.
🎧 Do you want to see a comedy or a drama?
🎧 Nothing sad or depressing. I had a hard work week. I want to see something funny.
🎧 I agree. Work was stressful for me too.
🎧 There aren't any new comedies right now. I only see dramas and horror movies.
🎧 Yeah, that's all I see too.
🎧 Hey, let's go to comedy club. My favorite comedian is performing tonight at the local theater.
🎧 That sounds great. What time?
🎧 It starts at 7 pm. Let's do dinner too.
🎧 Good idea! I'll meet you at your house at 5 pm.
🎧 See you tonight.
 
[125] Going to the Mall
 
🎧 Hey Carol, are you done with your final exams?
🎧 Yes, Jane! I had my last one this morning. How about you?
🎧 Yeah, I got done an hour ago.
🎧 Do you want to celebrate?
🎧 Sure! What should we do?
🎧 I don't know. Should we throw a party?
🎧 What if our friends are not done with exams.
🎧 Yeah, you're right. Do you want to go dancing?
🎧 I don't know how to dance.
🎧 You don't? It's easy. Just move your body to music.
🎧 I look silly when I dance.
🎧 Me too. I don't care.
🎧 Let's do something else.
🎧 Ok. Do you have any ideas?
🎧 Do you want to go see a play?
🎧 That sounds boring. I want to do something active.
🎧 I think we have different ideas of fun.
🎧 Yeah. How about shopping? Do you want to go to the mall?
🎧 I love shopping. Let's do that. We can eat dinner there too.
🎧 Great! Let's meet at the department store at 4 pm.
 
[126] Sleepover
 
🎧 Hello?
🎧 Hi Linda. This is Stacy. Are you free tomorrow night?
🎧 No, I'm not. Why?
🎧 I'm inviting a couple of friends to sleep over.
🎧 I wish I could go, but I have to babysit my younger sister.
🎧 That's too bad. We were going to rent a movie and order pizza.
🎧 Now I really wish I could go. That sounds like so much fun.
🎧 Can your parents find another babysitter?
🎧 No. Our regular babysitter got sick, so they asked me.
🎧 I see. What time will your parents be back?
🎧 9 o'clock pm.
🎧 Do you want to come over after you finish babysitting?
🎧 Will you still be awake?
🎧 Of course! It's a sleepover party. We're all going to sleep late.
🎧 Ok! Please save me some pizza.
🎧 I will. See you tomorrow night.
 
[127] Coworker Moving Away
 
🎧 Hello?
🎧 Hi Karen. This is Janet. Did you hear that Joanne is moving to England?
🎧 Yeah, what a great opportunity for her.
🎧 I'm thinking about throwing her a going-away party. What do you think?
🎧 I think that's wonderful idea. She is such a good co-worker.
🎧 Would you like to help me plan it?
🎧 Sure. Let's make it a potluck, so everyone can bring a dish to share.
🎧 That's a great idea. Less stress if I don't have to cook.
🎧 Right! How many people do you want to invite?
🎧 How about all of the people she works with. How many is that?
🎧 I think there are about 30 people in our department, including us.
🎧 Should we keep it a secret or let her know?
🎧 She doesn't like people making a big fuss over her, so let's keep it a secret.
🎧 When should we have the party?
🎧 When is she moving?
🎧 Next month, I think.
🎧 Then we should do it soon. She'll be busy packing and getting ready for the move.
🎧 How about next Friday? It's her last day at work too.
🎧 Perfect!
🎧 I'll send out an email to everyone tonight. Thanks for your help.
 
[128] Daughter's friend Moving Away
 
🎧 Sally, what's wrong? Why do you look so sad?
🎧 Mom, Candace is moving away.
🎧 Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Why is she moving?
🎧 Her dad got a job in another state.
🎧 Where is she moving?
🎧 To California. That's across the country.
🎧 There are many ways you can still keep in touch. You can e-mail, text, and call each other on the phone.
🎧 But it won't be the same as seeing each other every day. She is my best friend. I'm going to miss her.
🎧 I know you will. When are they moving?
🎧 At the end of June when the school year ends. In two months.
🎧 Would you like to invite her over this weekend? You can have a sleepover.
🎧 Yes, please. That would be great. We're going to try to hang out as much as possible before she moves.
🎧 That sounds like a good plan.
🎧 Can we visit her in California?
🎧 It's pretty far from us. We don't know anyone there.
🎧 Yes, we do. Candace and her family.
 
[129] Selling the House
 
🎧 Hey Jeff. Are you ok?
🎧 Hi Dad. Yeah, I'm just a little sad that we are selling my childhood home.
🎧 I know. I'm sad too. But it's just too big for your mother and me.
🎧 I understand. I just have a lot of memories here.
🎧 Me too. This is the first home your mother and I bought.
🎧 Do you remember all of our holiday parties here? Everyone came to our house.
🎧 Of course I remember them. Those were the best times.
🎧 Now I'm married and have a family of my own.
🎧 I wish we didn't have to sell it, but we can no longer take care of it. We're getting old and it's too much work.
🎧 Do you know who bought our house?
🎧 A young couple with two kids. They seem like a loving family.
🎧 Where will you and mom go?
🎧 We found a beautiful, small condo a few blocks away.
🎧 That's nice. Will there be enough room when the grandchildren visit?
🎧 Yes. We have an extra room for guests, so your kids can stay over any time.
🎧 Where's Mom?
🎧 She's at the fabric store. She wants to sew new curtains for the condo.
 
[130] Loud Dog Barking
 
🎧 Hi Carol. You look tired today.
🎧 I am tired. I didn't get any sleep last night.
🎧 Why?
🎧 Our neighbor's dog would not stop barking. He barked all night long.
🎧 That's awful! Did you complain to your neighbor?
🎧 I knocked on his door, but he didn't answer. I don't think he was home.
🎧 What did you do all night?
🎧 I couldn't sleep, so I tried to read a book. But the dog's barking kept distracting me. So, I just watched TV.
🎧 I would be so angry. You should've called the police.
🎧 I didn't want to bother the police with a barking dog.
🎧 I would have called them. What if there was an emergency at your neighbor's house and the dog was trying to alert someone.
🎧 That's true. I didn't think about that. But this dog usually barks because he's bored.
🎧 That's annoying.
🎧 I know.
🎧 Hey Carol. Is that your neighbor? He's walking towards us.
🎧 What is he holding?
🎧 It looks like a plate of cookies.
