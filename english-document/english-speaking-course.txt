Starting the day

🎧 Oh good morning, Tom!
🎧 How are you today?
🎧 Did you get enough sleep last night?
🎧 I feel like I barely slept at all.
🎧 Morning, Alice!
🎧 I'm okay, I guess.
🎧 But to be honest, I stayed up a bit too late watching that new series on TV.
🎧 You know how it goes.
🎧 You say, “Just one more episode,” and then suddenly it's 1 AM.
🎧 How about you?
🎧 Oh, I know that feeling all too well.
🎧 I was up late to trying to finish a book I was reading.
🎧 It was so good that I couldn't put it down.
🎧 But now I'm definitely feeling it.
🎧 I need a strong coffee to wake me up.
🎧 Me too!
🎧 A good cup of coffee sounds like the perfect way to start the day.
🎧 Let's do this and make it a productive day.

Team Meetings

🎧 Good morning, everyone.
🎧 I hope you're all ready for today's meeting.
🎧 Let's start by going over the progress on our current projects.
🎧 Alice, would you like to begin?
🎧 Of course, Mr. Smith.
🎧 The research phase is complete, and we've started the development stage.
🎧 We did face a slight delay due to some unexpected challenges with the data,
🎧 but we managed to resolve them quickly.
🎧 Actually, Alice, I'm not sure I agree with that.
🎧 I think the delay was longer than you're suggesting,
🎧 and it's going to push us behind schedule if we don't address it properly.
🎧 I understand your concern, Jimmy,
🎧 but I've already made changes to handle the delay.
🎧 I'm sure we can still meet our deadlines.
🎧 But Alice, we need to be realistic about what we can achieve.
🎧 Alright, I see both of your points.
🎧 Let's go over the timeline and see what changes we can make to stay on track.
🎧 We'll solve any issues to make sure we deliver great results for our clients.
🎧 That makes sense, Mr. Smith.
🎧 I didn't mean to ignore the issue. I just wanted to stay positive.
🎧 I get that, Alice.

Lunch Break

🎧 Hi Alice, hi Tom! Mind if I join you for lunch today?
🎧 I brought my lunch from home, but it's always nicer to eat with company.
🎧 Sure, Sarah. I could use a break after that meeting.
🎧 Yeah, let's take a breather.
🎧 That meeting was a bit intense, huh?
🎧 But, hey, we're all on the same team, right?
🎧 Oh no, what happened in the meeting?
🎧 You both look like you can use some comfort food.
🎧 Just a little disagreement about our project timeline.
🎧 I know Tom was just trying to be realistic,
🎧 but it felt like he was challenging everything I said.
🎧 I didn't mean to come off that way, Alice.
🎧 I respect your work a lot.
🎧 I just think we need to be careful with our deadlines.
🎧 It's good for us, right?
🎧 You're right. I don't want a small disagreement to spoil our day.
🎧 We're all putting in a lot of effort and I appreciate your feedback, Tom.
🎧 Let's take a break, enjoy lunch, and come back to the project with a fresh perspective.
🎧 Agreed. I'm glad we talked it out.

Client Calls

🎧 Hello, this is Alice from Brand New Company.
🎧 How can I help you today?
🎧 Hi Alice, I wanted to discuss the details of our new project.
🎧 Certainly! Let me pull up the information.
🎧 What specific details would you like to go over?
🎧 I want to confirm the timeline and the main tasks.
🎧 We have an eight-week schedule,
🎧 with the first task due in two weeks.
🎧 Does that work for you?
🎧 Yes, that's perfect. Thank you for the clarification.
🎧 You're welcome.
🎧 Please feel free to reach out if you have any other questions.
🎧 I will. Thanks, Alice.
🎧 How did the call go, Alice?
🎧 It went well.
🎧 The client is happy with the timeline.
🎧 I'm glad to hear that!
🎧 Me too.

Reporting to the Manager

🎧 Here are your documents, sir.
🎧 Tom, do you have a moment to discuss your report?
🎧 Of course, Mr. Smith.
🎧 Here is the latest update.
🎧 I see you've made great progress.
🎧 Just a few more details to add.
🎧 Can you include the client feedback in the next report?
🎧 Sure. I'll add that right away.
🎧 Thank you. Tom. Keep up the good work.
🎧 Thank you, Mr. Smith.
🎧 I'll send you the revised report by the end of the day.
🎧 Perfect. Let me know if you need any help.
🎧 Sure, Mr. Smith.

Leaving the Office

🎧 Alice, are you heading out now?
🎧 Yes, I am. It's been a long day.
🎧 Me too. Ready to go home and relax.
🎧 I have to go to the grocery store to buy some things for dinner.
🎧 It's tiring.
🎧 Oh, if that's the case, it'll take you at least two hours to finish dinner.
🎧 Why don't we go out for dinner?
🎧 Just for today. Because we've worked hard all day long.
🎧 That sounds good.
🎧 I agree.
🎧 The Korean restaurant near my house is famous.
🎧 You should definitely try it once.
🎧 Deal. Let's fill our empty stomachs.
🎧 Go go go!

Waking Up

🎧 Ugh, is it morning already?
🎧 I feel like I just went to bed.
🎧 Yeah, it's morning.
🎧 The alarm's been going off for a while now.
🎧 We should probably get up.
🎧 Another busy day ahead.
🎧 I know, I know. But five more minutes wouldn't hurt, right?
🎧 So cozy here.
🎧 You always say that, and then we end up rushing.
🎧 But I get it.
🎧 Mornings are tough.
🎧 Let's make a deal, five more minutes, and then we'll start the day.
🎧 Deal.
🎧 You know, I've been thinking about changing our morning routine.
🎧 Maybe adding some stretches or a quick workout.
🎧 It might help us wake up better.
🎧 That's not a bad idea.

Morning Exercise

🎧 Alright, so I've found a short morning workout routine online.
🎧 It's only 15 minutes. It's perfect for beginners like us.
🎧 Ready to give it a try?
🎧 As ready as I'll ever be.
🎧 I'm still waking up, but I think this could be good for us.
🎧 Lead the way, Coach Emma!
🎧 Okay, let's start with some light stretches.
🎧 I'm not usually a morning person, but this actually feels nice.
🎧 Yeah, I can see why people do this.
🎧 It's like we're shaking off the sleepiness.
🎧 Exactly! Just something to get us moving.
🎧 Now, let's try some jumping jacks,
🎧 just a few to get our heart rates up.
🎧 Jumping jacks, huh? Alright, let's do this.
🎧 You know, this might be the first time I've done jumping jacks since school.
🎧 Really?
🎧 But it's kind of fun, right?
🎧 For sure.

Breakfast

🎧 Morning exercise done, now it's time for breakfast.
🎧 I'm making pancakes with banana and honey!
🎧 It's been a long time since I cooked this dish.
🎧 That sounds fancy! Do you need any help?
🎧 Yes, can you mash the bananas?
🎧 I'll mix the batter.
🎧 Pancakes are a nice change.
🎧 We haven't had them in a while.
🎧 What made you think of this?
🎧 I wanted something comforting and sweet.
🎧 Plus, it's quick and easy.
🎧 We can add some fresh berries on top to.
🎧 I'll get the berries ready.
🎧 Oh, these are turning out perfectly.
🎧 I love the smell of pancakes cooking.
🎧 It's so warm and inviting.
🎧 It's the perfect way to start the day.

Getting Ready for Work

🎧 What to wear, what to wear…
🎧 I've got a meeting today, so...
🎧 I should probably go with something a little bit more formal.
🎧 You always look great, Emma.
🎧 But yeah, a meeting calls for the power outfit.
🎧 You want to make a good impression?
🎧 Thanks, James.
🎧 I think I'll go with the blue blouse and black pants.
🎧 It's professional, but still comfortable.
🎧 Good choice.
🎧 Comfort is key, especially when you're going to be stuck in meetings all day.
🎧 I'm going with my usual shirt and tie.
🎧 Nothing fancy.
🎧 Yeah. It's funny how getting dressed can set the tone for the day, too
🎧 When I wear something I feel good in, it boosts my confidence.
🎧 I get that.
🎧 Ready to head out?
🎧 Ready!

Lunch Break

🎧 Hey, Emma! How's your day going?
🎧 Do you want to grab lunch together?
🎧 Sure, Emily!
🎧 My day's been pretty busy, but I'm surviving.
🎧 How about you?
🎧 Same here. I've been running around all morning.
🎧 I'm so glad it's lunch time.
🎧 I need a break.
🎧 What did you bring?
🎧 Oh, just a simple salad with grilled chicken.
🎧 I'm trying to keep it healthy, especially after our morning workout.
🎧 Oh. That's awesome!
🎧 I brought a sandwich,
🎧 but now I'm wishing I had something healthier.
🎧 Maybe I'll join you on the salad train tomorrow.
🎧 Oh, it's never too late to start.

Evening Relaxation

🎧 Finally home.
🎧 What a day!
🎧 How about we do something relaxing?
🎧 What about a board game?
🎧 We haven't played one in ages, and it could be fun.
🎧 That's a great idea! Let's play Settlers of Catan.
🎧 It's been a while, and I'm feeling competitive.
🎧 You're on. I'll grab the game.
🎧 Just remember, I've won the last few rounds,
🎧 so don't get too upset if I win again.
🎧 We'll see about that! Tonight might be my night.
🎧 Alright, let the best player win!
🎧 And by that, I mean me, of course.
🎧 Let's go!

Preparing Dinner

🎧 So, what should we make for dinner?
🎧 I'm thinking of something quick and easy.
🎧 Maybe pasta?
🎧 Pasta sounds good.
🎧 How about we make a simple tomato and basil sauce?
🎧 We've got all the ingredients.
🎧 Perfect.
🎧 I'll start boiling the water, and you can chop the tomatoes.
🎧 We make a pretty good team in the kitchen, don't we?
🎧 Definitely.
🎧 Cooking together is one of my favorite parts of the day.
🎧 It's like our own little ritual.
🎧 You're so funny.

Bedtime Routine

🎧 I'm so ready for bed. How about you?
🎧 Definitely.
🎧 I'm going to read a bit before sleeping.
🎧 Do you want to join me?
🎧 Sure, just a few pages of my mystery novel.
🎧 Sounds good. Let's relax for a bit.
🎧 Reading before bed is the best way to relax.
🎧 It helps me clear my mind.
🎧 I'm re-reading “The Alchemist.”
🎧 It always helps me reflect on life a bit.
🎧 That's a good choice. I'm reading a mystery novel.
🎧 It keeps me guessing until the end.
🎧 Perfect way to end the day.
🎧 Let's read for a bit and then lights out.
🎧 Okay, I'm done for the night.
🎧 I feel sleepy already.
🎧 Let's get some rest. Tomorrow's another busy day.
🎧 Goodnight, James. Sweet dreams.
🎧 Good night, Emma. Sleep well.

Planning the Trip

🎧 I'm so excited for our trip!
🎧 But I don't know where to start. How do we plan it?
🎧 Don't worry, Anna.
🎧 First we need to decide where to go.
🎧 Do you guys have a place in mind?
🎧 I've always wanted to visit Japan.
🎧 The cherry blossoms look so beautiful.
🎧 Japan is a great choice!
🎧 We can start by booking our flights and accommodation.
🎧 Do you have a budget?
🎧 I think around 1500. Is that enough?
🎧 Yes, that should be enough.
🎧 That's great!
🎧 We'll find some good deals.
🎧 Let's check online for flights first.

Packing the Luggage

🎧 Are you all set for packing, Anna?
🎧 Not really... I'm confused about what to pack.
🎧 It's my first time traveling.
🎧 Just pack the essentials.
🎧 Clothes, phone backup charger, and don't forget your passport!
🎧 Right! Should I bring a lot of clothes?
🎧 No need to overpack. Just enough for a few days.
🎧 You can always do laundry there.
🎧 I got it. What about shoes?
🎧 Should I bring fancy ones?
🎧 Comfortable shoes are a must.
🎧 You'll be walking a lot.
🎧 Okay, I'm packing my sneakers.
🎧 I think I'm ready.
🎧 Awesome!

Airport Check-In

🎧 I'm so nervous.
🎧 What do we do now?
🎧 Relax, Anna.
🎧 First, we need to check in.
🎧 Do you have your passport and ticket?
🎧 Yes. I have them here.
🎧 Katherine reminded me of this.
🎧 Great! Let's go to the counter.
🎧 Hello! May I have your passports, please?
🎧 Here you go.
🎧 Thank you. How many bags are you checking in?
🎧 Just one for me.
🎧 Same here.
🎧 Me too.
🎧 Alright. Your flight leaves from Gate 5.
🎧 Have a nice trip!
🎧 Thank you!
🎧 See, that wasn't so bad.
🎧 You're right. I feel better now.

Boarding the Flight

🎧 They're calling our row.
🎧 Are you two ready to board?
🎧 Ready as ever.
🎧 Yes. I'm ready.
🎧 What do we do?
🎧 Just follow the line.
🎧 Have your boarding pass and passport ready.
🎧 Boarding passes, please.
🎧 Thank you.
🎧 Enjoy your flight!
🎧 Wow, this is exciting! Where are our seats?
🎧 Right here. You have the window seat.
🎧 Yay! I can't wait to see the view.

Call a Taxi

🎧 How do we get to the hotel?
🎧 They have subways, taxis, and many other means of transportation here.
🎧 Let's call a taxi. It's the easiest way.
🎧 That's a good idea.
🎧 But we don't speak Japanese.
🎧 What if they don't understand us?
🎧 Don't worry. Many drivers speak some English.
🎧 Let's give it a try.
🎧 We can also use translation apps if needed.
🎧 Hello! Where to go?
🎧 Hi, we're going to the Grand Tokyo Hotel.
🎧 Grand Tokyo Hotel? Okay!
🎧 That was easier than I thought!
🎧 See? No problem at all.

Buying Souvenirs

🎧 These are so cute! I want to buy something for my family.
🎧 Good idea.
🎧 What about those keychains?
🎧 They're small and easy to carry.
🎧 I also want to buy them.
🎧 Let me ask the shopkeeper about the cost.
🎧 Hello! Can I help you with anything?
🎧 Yes, I'd like to buy these keychains.
🎧 How much are they?
🎧 500 yen each.
🎧 I'll take four, please.
🎧 Thank you! Do you need a bag?
🎧 Yes, please.
🎧 Oh, you guys found some great souvenirs.
🎧 I'm so excited to give these to my family.

Local Food

🎧 This place looks amazing.
🎧 I've never tried sushi before.
🎧 You'll love it.
🎧 Let's order a few dishes to share.
🎧 Good evening! Are you ready to order?
🎧 Yes, we'll have some sushi, tempura, and miso soup, please.
🎧 Great choices! Anything to drink?
🎧 Matcha tea for me, please.
🎧 I'll have a green tea, please.
🎧 Same for me.
🎧 Coming right up!
🎧 I'm a little nervous to try new food, but I'm excited too.
🎧 Don't worry, it's delicious.
🎧 Just take small bites and enjoy the flavors.
🎧 Wow, this is so good! I'm glad I tried it.
🎧 I knew you'd like it.
🎧 Trying local food is one of the best parts of traveling.
🎧 I agree! I can't wait to try more.

First Impressions

🎧 Sophie, I'm so nervous!
🎧 What if he doesn't like me?
🎧 Relax, Emily. Just be yourself.
🎧 He's already interested, so you're halfway there!
🎧 But what if I say something silly?
🎧 It's okay.
🎧 Just smile, be polite, and ask him about himself.
🎧 Everyone likes to talk about themselves.
🎧 You're right. I'll just focus on having a good time.
🎧 Exactly!
🎧 And remember, first impressions matter.
🎧 But they're not everything.
🎧 Just enjoy the moment.
🎧 What about clothes, should I dress mature or sweet?
🎧 Which style do you feel most comfortable with?
🎧 I like sweet things,
🎧 But I'm also a grown woman,
🎧 I'm worried if it's okay to dress like that.
🎧 Why not?
🎧 If he is a good man, he will respect your style.
🎧 You can't live your whole life for someone else, right?
🎧 Wear what you like,
🎧 as long as it's polite and comfortable.
🎧 Thanks, Sophie.
🎧 You always know what to say.
🎧 Hey man, are you ready for the date?
🎧 I think so, but I'm kind of nervous.
🎧 It's been a while since my last date.
🎧 Just remember, it's not about impressing her with big gestures.
🎧 Focus on having a good time and getting to know her.
🎧 I got it.
🎧 But there is one more thing.
🎧 I can't decide what to wear.
🎧 Should I go with the blue shirt or the grey one?
🎧 Go with the blue. It's more casual but still looks sharp.
🎧 Also, it brings out your eyes.
🎧 Good point. What about jeans or chinos?
🎧 Chinos, definitely.
🎧 They're a bit more dressed up but still comfortable.
🎧 You want to look like you put in some effort without overdoing it.
🎧 Got it.
🎧 Should I bring flowers or is that too much for a first date?
🎧 How about something simple, like a box of chocolates?
🎧 It's thoughtful without being overwhelming.
🎧 Thanks, Lucas. I feel more prepared now.

Planning the Date

🎧 So, Emily, do you have any favorite places in town?
🎧 I really like the park by the river.
🎧 It's peaceful and has a great view.
🎧 That sounds nice.
🎧 How about we take a walk there after dinner?
🎧 I love that. It's a perfect spot for a quiet chat.
🎧 Great! We can grab some ice cream on the way too.
🎧 That sounds like a perfect evening.
🎧 I'm in.
🎧 What time should we meet?
🎧 How about 7 PM tomorrow?
🎧 That gives us plenty of time to enjoy dinner
🎧 and catch the music before it gets too late.
🎧 7 PM works for me.
🎧 Okay. See you later.

Choosing the Restaurant

🎧 Have you been to the AC Italian Cuisine restaurant before?
🎧 I tried that restaurant once a year ago,
🎧 but I want to make sure it is still as good as before.
🎧 I need to prepare carefully so that Emily will have good memories.
🎧 No, but I've heard good things about it.
🎧 You know Jimmy?
🎧 He just proposed to his girlfriend successfully two weeks ago at that restaurant.
🎧 That place is Cupid.
🎧 That might be a good start for you and Emily.
🎧 I don't believe in such things, but it seems like a good thing.
🎧 Thanks, Lucas.
🎧 I'll invite Emily to this restaurant.
🎧 Good luck, Jake.
🎧 Emily, would you like to try the Italian restaurant near the city center?
🎧 It's worth a try.
🎧 Of course, I'm looking forward to it.
🎧 You plan so carefully.
🎧 No big deal.
🎧 I just want us to have a great date.
🎧 See you tomorrow.
🎧 Cool.

Conversation Starters

🎧 So, Emily, what do you like to do in your free time?
🎧 I enjoy reading and painting.
🎧 It helps me relax.
🎧 That's cool.
🎧 What kind of books do you like?
🎧 Mostly fiction.
🎧 I love getting lost in a good story.
🎧 What about you?
🎧 I'm into hiking and photography.
🎧 Nature is my escape.
🎧 That sounds amazing. I've always wanted to try hiking.
🎧 Maybe we can go together sometime.
🎧 I know some great trails.
🎧 I'd like that.
🎧 Are you ready to order?
🎧 Yes, we'll start with the bruschetta,
🎧 and then we'd like to share the lasagna and carbonara.
🎧 Excellent choices.
🎧 I'll bring those out shortly.
🎧 This place has such a nice atmosphere.
🎧 It's perfect for a first date.
🎧 I'm glad you like it.
🎧 I wanted to choose somewhere special.

Saying Goodbye

🎧 I had a really great time tonight, Emily.
🎧 Dinner, the walk, the music. It was all perfect.
🎧 I did too, Jake. Everything was just right.
🎧 You planned it so well.
🎧 I'm glad you think so.
🎧 I was a little nervous about everything going smoothly,
🎧 but it turned out better than I hoped.
🎧 You didn't need to worry.
🎧 It was one of the best evenings I've had in a long time.
🎧 So I guess this is where we say goodbye.
🎧 Yeah, I suppose so. But hopefully, not for too long.
🎧 Definitely. I'd love to do this again sometime soon.
🎧 Maybe next weekend.
🎧 I'd like that.
🎧 Let's keep in touch and plan something.
🎧 Do you need a ride home?
🎧 I can call a taxi for you.
🎧 That's sweet, but I'm okay.
🎧 Sophie has something to do nearby,
🎧 so she'll be here to pick me up in five minutes.
🎧 Emily, here!
🎧 She was faster than I thought.
🎧 Take care, Emily. I had a great time.
🎧 You too, Jake. Have a good night.

A Day In My Life

🎧 Hey, Brie! How's the new apartment?
🎧 It's great, but I need some furniture.
🎧 What do you need?
🎧 Probably a sofa and some lamps.
🎧 I'm also looking for a bookshelf.
🎧 Oh, there's a garage sale down the street.
🎧 Wanna go with me?
🎧 Sure. When?
🎧 How about today, after work?
🎧 Sounds good. Let's go up to work.
🎧 Awesome.
🎧 I have to get back to work now.
🎧 See you later.
🎧 See ya.
🎧 Look, Brie! That sofa is nice.
🎧 Yeah, and it's the right size.
🎧 Excuse me, how much is this sofa?
🎧 It's $40.
🎧 Can I take a closer look?
🎧 Sure, go ahead.
🎧 Elle, what do you think?
🎧 I like it, but $40 is a bit much.
🎧 You're right.
🎧 Do you have any lamps?
🎧 Yes, over there. $10 each.
🎧 Oh, this one is nice.
🎧 Is it in good condition?
🎧 Yes, it works perfectly.
🎧 Hardly used.
🎧 Does it come with extra bulbs?
🎧 I can give you two extra bulbs with each.
🎧 Can I take both the sofa and the lamps for $50?
🎧 How about $55?
🎧 How could you do $52?
🎧 Alright, $52 it is!
🎧 For the sofa, two lamps, and four extra bulbs.
🎧 Thank you. Here you are.
🎧 Thanks! Here is your change!
🎧 Thank you! Can you help me carry them to the car?
🎧 Of course.
🎧 Hi! Excuse me!
🎧 Yes? How can I help you?
🎧 I'm Brie. I just moved into room 405 last week.
🎧 Nice to meet you!
🎧 Oh, so you must be my next-door neighbor!
🎧 I'm Sam, in room 406.
🎧 That's awesome!
🎧 If you need anything, feel free to ask me, Brie!
🎧 Well, actually, yes.
🎧 I want to ask you about something...
🎧 About what?
🎧 Someone is smoking a lot, and the smell comes into my apartment.
🎧 Oh, that's not good.
🎧 Do you know who it is?
🎧 No, I'm not sure.
🎧 It's really strong in the evening.
🎧 I've noticed it, too. It's annoying.
🎧 I want to file a complaint with the building manager.
🎧 Do you think it'll help?
🎧 Yes, it might help.
🎧 The manager should know about it.
🎧 Have you talked to the manager before?
🎧 Yes, I have.
🎧 The manager is nice and listens to problems.
🎧 Oh, that's good to know.
🎧 Can you come with me to talk to the manager?
🎧 Sure, I can do that.
🎧 When do you want to go?
🎧 How about tomorrow morning?
🎧 That works for me.
🎧 Let's meet at 9 am.
🎧 Great, thank you, Sam. See you tomorrow.
🎧 See you tomorrow, Brie. We'll get this sorted out.
🎧 Hi, excuse me. I need to return this toaster.
🎧 I just bought it last week.
🎧 Sure, what's the problem with it?
🎧 Well, it won't turn on.
🎧 I tried, but nothing happens.
🎧 I think it's broken!
🎧 I'm sorry to hear that!
🎧 Do you have the receipt with you?
🎧 Yes. Here it is.
🎧 Thank you! I'll check the toaster to see what the problem is.
🎧 Yes, please.
🎧 Could you tell me how you were trying to turn it on?
🎧 Well, I plugged it in...
🎧 And then.
🎧 I put two pieces of bread in... and waited... but nothing happened.
🎧 Oh, I see the issue here.
🎧 What is it?
🎧 The toaster is plugged in, but the switch isn't turned on.
🎧 Oh, what switch?
🎧 It's right here.
🎧 Oh, is that a switch?
🎧 I thought it was a timer or something!
🎧 The timer is this one.
🎧 Oh. How strange!
🎧 My previous toaster was from this brand too,
🎧 but I didn't have to turn on a switch.
🎧 Yes. You're right.
🎧 However, this is the latest model and it comes with a switch for safety reasons.
🎧 I see. Thank you for pointing that out! I feel so silly.
🎧 It happens to everyone.
🎧 Is there anything else I can help you with?
🎧 No. That's all.
🎧 Thank you for your help.
🎧 You're welcome.
🎧 Have a great day.
🎧 You too! Thanks again.
🎧 Hi, Brie! Can I sit here?
🎧 Of course!
🎧 You seem a bit upset. What's wrong?
🎧 Oh, I just had a terrible morning.
🎧 Oh, what happened?
🎧 Do you know I was supposed to have an important meeting this morning?
🎧 Yes! Was it the meeting with your client?
🎧 Yes! The client wanted to hear about our marketing plan for his upcoming product.
🎧 I was a presenter.
🎧 Was he unhappy with your plan?
🎧 No, he wasn't happy or unhappy.
🎧 So what happened?
🎧 Did you not finish it in time?
🎧 I finished the plan three days before the meeting! But...
🎧 But what?
🎧 My laptop decided to update Windows right before the meeting!!!
🎧 Oh, no. What happened next?
🎧 I had to present with no slides.
🎧 It was hard to convince my client without them!
🎧 That sounds like a nightmare!
🎧 What did your boss say?
🎧 Oh, he was speechless during the meeting.
🎧 How about afterward?
🎧 He gave me an earful right after the meeting ended.
🎧 He said I was unprofessional for not having a backup.
🎧 Well... I have to agree.
🎧 You should have a backup plan saved somewhere else.
🎧 I know. I've learned my lesson...
🎧 What did the client say?
🎧 He was confused, but more understanding than my boss.
🎧 He told me to email him the plan later.
🎧 Oh, how nice! Did you send it to him?
🎧 I already did.
🎧 Oh. That's rough.
🎧 How about a coffee to help you relax?
🎧 My treat!
🎧 Well, I'd rather have something sweet right now.
🎧 Oh, would you like some orange juice?
🎧 That sounds refreshing.
🎧 Wait here! I'll be back soon!
🎧 Thanks, Elle! You're so nice!
🎧 Oh, good morning, Brie! It's rare to see you this early!
🎧 Hi, Sam! I just got back from my morning run!
🎧 Oh, I wish I had your motivation.
🎧 I just started a few days ago.
🎧 I want to lose some extra weight after the holiday.
🎧 Me too! I've gained 4 pounds after the holiday!
🎧 Do you want to join me?
🎧 No, thanks! There's no way I can get up that early.
🎧 Do you run in the afternoon?
🎧 Actually, I don't run.
🎧 I go to the gym.
🎧 Really? Where is it?
🎧 Oh, it's right around the corner.
🎧 Oh, cool. What's it called?
🎧 It's called Elite Fitness.
🎧 It sounds... expensive!
🎧 Oh, it's actually affordable.
🎧 I can send you their membership fee if you're interested!
🎧 Yes, please! And how is the equipment?
🎧 They have a lot of equipment and great classes.
🎧 Plus, the trainers are really nice.
🎧 Oh, that's great because I have no idea how to use the gym equipment.
🎧 I'm sure you'll find some good trainers there!
🎧 Cool! Do they have a free trial?
🎧 Yes, they do. You can try it for a week for free.
🎧 Perfect.
🎧 How do I sign up for the trial?
🎧 Just go to the gym and ask at the front desk.
🎧 They'll set you up.
🎧 Thanks, Sam. I'll check it out!
🎧 You're welcome!
🎧 Hi, Mom!
🎧 Oh, Brie! How are you, sweetie?
🎧 I'm great, Mom! How are you?
🎧 I'm amazing, just missing you a lot!
🎧 Haha, me too, Mom! I really miss you!
🎧 How's your new job going?
🎧 It's going great!
🎧 In fact, I've just been invited to a party with my new colleagues this weekend!
🎧 Oh, that sounds lovely.
🎧 Yes, it is.
🎧 But, Mom, there's a problem!
🎧 What's that?
🎧 It's a potluck party, and I don't know what to bring! I need your help!
🎧 Sure, I can help.
🎧 Do you know what other people are bringing?
🎧 No, I don't.
🎧 They didn't say anything.
🎧 Maybe bring something simple, but tasty.
🎧 How about a salad?
🎧 Don't you think a salad is a bit plain?
🎧 Well, a salad can be great if you know how to make it right!
🎧 Mom... You know I'm a terrible cook, right?
🎧 I'll help you, honey, don't worry!
🎧 Okay! So, what kind of salad should I make?
🎧 Let's make a pasta salad.
🎧 It's easy to prepare, but very tasty!
🎧 I'll send you my special recipe!
🎧 That sounds great! So, what do I need?
🎧 Pasta, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, olives, and some cheese.
🎧 You can use a simple dressing like Italian.
🎧 And do I just put everything in a bowl and mix it?
🎧 No, Brie! You'll have to chop them up first.
🎧 That sounds like a hassle!
🎧 Well, how about I stop by tomorrow and help you make it?
🎧 That would be great, mom.
🎧 Good morning, Brie!
🎧 Good morning, Ian!
🎧 How is your weekend?
🎧 Amazing! I went fishing with my friends.
🎧 How about you?
🎧 Did you go on a shopping spree?
🎧 Yes, I did! There was a great sale at the mall last week!
🎧 But how did you know?
🎧 Well, the tag on your shirt is showing...
🎧 Oh my! How embarrassing!
🎧 I must have forgotten to remove it before washing.
🎧 Haha, it happens to me sometimes too!
🎧 Oh, thank you for telling me!
🎧 If you were my client, I'd probably quit my job out of embarrassment!
🎧 If that were the case,
🎧 you should definitely go to the restroom and fix it quickly before the morning meeting.
🎧 You're right! Do you have a pair of scissors?
🎧 No, I don't.
🎧 But there should be a pair in the photocopy room.
🎧 I think it's on the counter.
🎧 Thanks! You're a lifesaver!
🎧 You're welcome, Brie!

In A Meeting

🎧 Alright team, let's go over the Q3 sales report.
🎧 The numbers look good overall, but there's a drop in the Southeast area.
🎧 Yeah, I noticed that too.
🎧 Any ideas on what might be causing it?
🎧 We haven't figured out the exact cause yet.
🎧 It could be a seasonal slowdown
🎧 or maybe a competitor increase
🎧 their advertising in the area.
🎧 We should look into it more.
🎧 Maybe we could reach out to some of our top clients there to see what they're noticing.
🎧 Great suggestion, Jacob.
🎧 We can also check out any recent advertising
🎧 our competitors have done in the Southeast.
🎧 Have we thought about offering any local deals to boost sales there?
🎧 Interesting idea, Adam.
🎧 We could think of some special offers just for the Southeast.
🎧 But we'll need to be careful.
🎧 Maybe we could try a short-term plan focused on keeping customers.
🎧 Absolutely.
🎧 We can look into a loyalty program.
🎧 Or bonus points for people who buy more than once in the Southeast.
🎧 Agreed.
🎧 We'll put together a plan to talk with the Southeast team
🎧 and keep everyone updated on what we find.

Brainstorming Session

🎧 Alright team
🎧 Let's start thinking of ideas for the new marketing campaign!
🎧 We need to get a lot of attention
🎧 with this product launch.
🎧 I suggest holding a contest
🎧 on social media.
🎧 We could get people talking about it and increase interest.
🎧 Interesting, Beth.
🎧 But how would the contest connect to the product itself?
🎧 We don't want just short-term excitement.
🎧 Hmm, how about a contest where users make content
🎧 that shows off the product's benefits in a creative way?
🎧 That sounds good!
🎧 We could also work with influencers
🎧 to help the contest reach more people.
🎧 I like that idea.
🎧 But we also need to think about a traditional marketing plan.
🎧 We could focus on online ads,
🎧 or maybe a TV commercial.
🎧 Great point Lucy.
🎧 We should try using many different channels.
🎧 We could also use email marketing
🎧 to reach our existing customers.
🎧 A pre-launch campaign could be a great idea.
🎧 Absolutely, Donald.
🎧 All these ideas are fantastic!
🎧 Let's write them down and decide based on our budget
🎧 and how many people we can reach.
🎧 I think we should also think
🎧 about the timeline.
🎧 We need to start this campaign soon to take advantage of the current trends.
🎧 Let's keep working on these ideas.
🎧 Once we have a better plan, we can show it to the client for approval.

Presentation

🎧 Hey Tim, how's the presentation going?
🎧 Almost done, I think.
🎧 Just finishing up the slides.
🎧 Are you nervous?
🎧 A little, yeah.
🎧 It's a big proposal, and I want to make a good impression.
🎧 Don't worry, you've got this!
🎧 Your ideas are really good.
🎧 Just remember to keep it short and focus on what benefits they'll see.
🎧 That's the best way to win them over.
🎧 That's the problem, there's so much information I want to include!
🎧 I get it, but too many details might confuse them.
🎧 Maybe you could focus on the main points
🎧 and offer to send more details later in a document.
🎧 Hmm, that's a good idea.
🎧 I can also practice a few times to make sure I'm clear and interesting.
🎧 A smooth presentation will definitely leave a good impression.
🎧 Want to go over it with me this afternoon?
🎧 That would be great, thanks Paula!
🎧 You're a lifesaver.

Team-Building activities

🎧 Hey David, did you hear about the company picnic next month?
🎧 Yeah, I saw the email.
🎧 Sounds fun, free food and all.
🎧 Yeah, but I'm not a big fan of those team-building activities.
🎧 Remember the trust fall last year? So awkward!
🎧 Yeah, that was a bit much.
🎧 But maybe this year will be different?
🎧 I heard they're trying something new.
🎧 Really? What is it?
🎧 An escape room!
🎧 We'll work together to solve puzzles and escape a themed room in a set time.
🎧 That actually sounds fun.
🎧 I love puzzles, and a little friendly competition sounds good.
🎧 Right? Plus, it might be a good way to get to know some coworkers we don't know well.
🎧 Maybe I'll finally get to know
🎧 Kevin from accounting.
🎧 He always seems really quiet.
🎧 Maybe the escape room will show his puzzle skills.
🎧 We should sign up together!

Coffee breaks

🎧 Man, that report deadline was tough.
🎧 My brain feels like it's tired from staring at spreadsheets all morning.
🎧 Ready for a coffee break?
🎧 Almost. I just need to finish this email.
🎧 No worries, take your time.
🎧 But seriously, you've been looking at that screen for hours.
🎧 You deserve a break!
🎧 You're right.
🎧 My brain feels really tired.
🎧 Where are you thinking? The usual place?
🎧 Of course.
🎧 Maybe they finally restock those
🎧 blueberry muffins this time.
🎧 Now you're speaking my language!
🎧 Coffee and muffins are a perfect match.
🎧 So, what are you working on that's got you so focused today?
🎧 Is it another one of those big marketing
🎧 campaigns everyone's been talking about?
🎧 Just a presentation
🎧 for the marketing team.
🎧 We're thinking of some new social media ideas to get more people involved.
🎧 Oh, fun! Anything exciting you can share?
🎧 Maybe if you buy me that muffin...
🎧 Alright, alright, keep your secrets.
🎧 But seriously, I'm curious!
🎧 We'll see.
🎧 But for now, let's get some coffee, and maybe I'll tell you more.

Networking event

🎧 Hi there, I'm Duke!
🎧 I work in marketing at Green Tech Solutions.
🎧 Duke, nice to meet you!
🎧 I'm with Sun City Solar. We install solar panels.
🎧 Oh, cool! That's a growing business, isn't it?
🎧 Yes, a lot of people are interested in clean energy.
🎧 At GreenTech, we're working on a project to help eco-friendly businesses in the city.
🎧 Interesting!
🎧 Maybe we could find some ways to work together.
🎧 We always look for ways to connect with
🎧 people who care about the environment.
🎧 Would you like to exchange business cards?
🎧 We could talk more about working together.
🎧 Sure!
🎧 What kind of marketing are you working on?
🎧 We're focusing on social media and local events.
🎧 Here's my card. Let's connect on LinkedIn too.
🎧 Sure. It was nice meeting you!
🎧 You too, Patrick.
🎧 Maybe I'll see you at another event soon.

Project planning

🎧 Hey Mark, do you have a minute?
🎧 Sure, Amelia. Have a seat.
🎧 What's on your mind?
🎧 It's about the Johnson project.
🎧 I looked at our plan again,
🎧 and I think we need to change the time for the design part.
🎧 What's the problem?
🎧 Well, the client gave me new feedback yesterday
🎧 and it looks like the design needs
🎧 more work than I thought.
🎧 I see.
🎧 Maybe we should give the design an extra week.
🎧 Do you think that will change
🎧 the launch date?
🎧 I hope not.
🎧 We can move some other things,
🎧 like making the content or testing.
🎧 Okay, let's check the whole plan and see if we can change anything.
🎧 For sure.
🎧 I'll update the design schedule
🎧 and send it to you to look at.
🎧 Sounds good, Amelia.
🎧 Maybe we can have lunch this week
🎧 and talk about ideas for the new design.
🎧 Great idea!
🎧 Thanks, Mark.
🎧 I'm glad you're helping me with this.
🎧 No problem, Amelia.
🎧 We'll work it out!

Photography

🎧 Hey, I've noticed you've been posting some amazing photos recently.
🎧 Are you into photography?
🎧 Yeah, I've been getting into it lately.
🎧 It's such a fun hobby.
🎧 I can tell!
🎧 Your photos are really impressive.
🎧 What got you into photography?
🎧 I just want to capture special moments and memories.
🎧 Plus, it's a fun way to be creative.
🎧 Oh. That's cool.
🎧 What kind of things
🎧 do you usually take pictures of?
🎧 I love taking photos of landscapes,
🎧 especially at sunset.
🎧 The light is just beautiful.
🎧 Great choice.
🎧 I'm more into portraits,
🎧 but I haven't practiced much.
🎧 Portraits are great too.
🎧 You should try it out sometime.
🎧 It's all about experimenting
🎧 and enjoying the process.
🎧 Yeah, I'll have to dust off my camera and give it a try.
🎧 Thanks for the encouragement.
🎧 Anytime!
🎧 Let me know if you ever want to go on a photo adventure together.

Cooking

🎧 Hey Mike, what are you up to this weekend?
🎧 Nothing much, probably just relaxing at home.
🎧 How about you?
🎧 Me too, actually.
🎧 I'm thinking of trying a new recipe.
🎧 Have you been cooking anything fun lately?
🎧 You know me and fancy recipes, haha.
🎧 But I did try these veggie burgers the other day.
🎧 They were pretty good.
🎧 Veggie burgers, huh? Sounds healthy.
🎧 I'm in the mood for something a bit greasier.
🎧 Maybe some macaroni and cheese?
🎧 Not a bad idea.
🎧 Last night, I made a delicious pasta dish with homemade sauce.
🎧 That sounds amazing!
🎧 What's your secret
🎧 ingredient for the sauce?
🎧 I added a bit of red wine
🎧 for extra flavor.
🎧 It turned out really rich and tasty.
🎧 Nice touch!
🎧 I've been wanting to try more new things with cooking too.
🎧 Do you have any favorite cooking blogs
🎧 or YouTube channels that you watch?
🎧 I often watch Tasty videos on YouTube for quick and easy recipes.
🎧 Thanks, I'll check it out.

Painting

🎧 Wow, these colors are amazing.
🎧 What are you looking at?
🎧 This artist on Instagram, their paintings are so bright.
🎧 It makes me want to get out my old watercolors.
🎧 Really? You used to paint?
🎧 Yeah, back in high school.
🎧 I haven't used them in ages, though.
🎧 Life just got too busy.
🎧 I get that.
🎧 You should definitely try again.
🎧 Maybe even try something new,
🎧 like acrylics or something.
🎧 That's a good idea.
🎧 Maybe I'll look for a local art class for beginners.
🎧 There is a great community
🎧 art center downtown.
🎧 They offer all kinds of classes.
🎧 We could even check it out together sometime!
🎧 You'd come with me?
🎧 Of course.
🎧 We could make a day of it and explore the art supply store too.
🎧 That sounds like so much fun.
🎧 Let me know when you're free.

Hiking

🎧 Is it always this cold in the morning here?
🎧 Only in the spring and fall!
🎧 It gets nice and hot in the summer though.
🎧 Perfect for hiking.
🎧 Do you like hiking?
🎧 Of course.
🎧 I try to go at least once a month.
🎧 It's a great way to clear my head and get some exercise.
🎧 I'm the opposite.
🎧 I haven't been hiking in ages.
🎧 I'm not sure if my knees can handle it when I go again.
🎧 Don't worry.
🎧 You'll get beautiful views
🎧 without the really steep climbs.
🎧 Really?
🎧 I might have to check that out.
🎧 What do you usually take with you?
🎧 Just the basics: backpack, water, snacks, and a good pair of shoes.
🎧 And sometimes a camera
🎧 to take pictures of the scenery.
🎧 Sounds simple enough.
🎧 Maybe we could plan a hike together sometime?
🎧 I'd be up for that!

Knitting

🎧 This is for your birthday, Anna.
🎧 Thank you so much!
🎧 This must have taken you a lot of time, huh?
🎧 You're right, but it was worth it.
🎧 Did someone teach you to knit,
🎧 or did you learn by yourself?
🎧 I learned it by myself, actually.
🎧 I just started two weeks ago.
🎧 The pattern is really impressive for a beginner!
🎧 Thanks.
🎧 I wish I could knit like this.
🎧 Oh, trust me, it takes practice.
🎧 But it's really relaxing once you get the hang of it.
🎧 You should try it!
🎧 Maybe I should.
🎧 It seems like a good way to relax after work.
🎧 Do you think it's hard to learn?
🎧 Not at all!
🎧 I can teach you the basic stitches if you want.
🎧 We could even have a little knitting night sometime.
🎧 That would be amazing!
🎧 I'd love to learn from you.
🎧 Maybe we could pick out some yarn together too?
🎧 We can make a whole day of it.
🎧 Knitting, yarn shopping, maybe some coffee...
🎧 Sounds like my kind of day!
🎧 Let me know when you're free.

Playing musical instruments

🎧 How's the guitar practice going?
🎧 Not bad.
🎧 I'm finally getting the hang of that fingerpicking pattern you showed me.
🎧 Good job.
🎧 That one can be tricky.
🎧 You have to keep your fingers moving separately.
🎧 Yeah, it takes some practice for sure.
🎧 But it sounds so cool once you get it right.
🎧 Definitely.
🎧 By the way, did you see the flyer for the open mic night at our favorite coffee shop next week?
🎧 No, I must have missed it.
🎧 That sounds interesting.
🎧 Yeah, they have it every other Wednesday.
🎧 Local musicians can play a song or two. It's pretty relaxed.
🎧 Hmm, that could be fun.
🎧 Maybe I could try playing something simple.
🎧 You should!
🎧 It's a good way to get over stage fright and get feedback from other musicians.
🎧 Yeah. You're right.
🎧 Maybe I'll work on a short piece and give it a try.
🎧 Cool! Let me know if you do.
🎧 I'd love to come and cheer you on.

Blogging

🎧 Hey Nancy, how's it going?
🎧 Hey David, I'm good!
🎧 Just catching up on some emails.
🎧 What about you?
🎧 Same here.
🎧 Actually, I was checking out your social media earlier and saw you mentioned a blog.
🎧 Oh yeah!
🎧 I recently started one about baking.
🎧 I love trying new recipes and thought it'd be fun to share them.
🎧 That's awesome.
🎧 I've been thinking about starting a blog myself
🎧 but on something completely different.
🎧 More on the tech side of things.
🎧 You're a software developer, right?
🎧 So your blog must be about coding.
🎧 That's right.
🎧 I love sharing tips and tricks for beginners.
🎧 That sounds interesting!
🎧 I might need to check that out.
🎧 Definitely!
🎧 Maybe we can swap some blog promotion tips sometime.
🎧 We could even do a guest post on each
🎧 other's blogs to help promote them.
🎧 Oh no, that's a great idea.
🎧 Let's chat more about it later.
🎧 I have a presentation soon.
🎧 Good luck with your presentation.

In a study group

🎧 Okay everyone, let's start on this biology chapter.
🎧 The exam is next week, remember?
🎧 There's so much to study.
🎧 Don't worry.
🎧 If we work together, it won't feel so hard.
🎧 Exactly. Liam, you did great on the last bio exam.
🎧 Any tips for studying the cell cycle?
🎧 Sure! The most important thing is to understand the different phases.
🎧 Flashcards can really help
🎧 with learning the order.
🎧 Good idea. Maybe we can make some flashcards together for the key words?
🎧 I'm in! Flashcards are better than just reading the textbook again and again.
🎧 Liam, did you say something about practice problems?
🎧 Yeah, there are some good practice problems at the end of each chapter.
🎧 Doing those will help us use what we've learned.
🎧 I think we can split up the problems and quiz each other on them.
🎧 This is starting to feel a little less scary.
🎧 Thanks for setting up this study group, Chris!

In a club meeting

🎧 Alright everyone, thanks for coming to tonight's Green Club meeting!
🎧 Hey Isabella, glad I could make it!
🎧 What are we talking about tonight?
🎧 We have a lot to talk about.
🎧 First, I wanted to hear everyone's ideas
🎧 for the Earth Day event on campus.
🎧 I think we could set up a booth with information about how to live in an eco-friendly way.
🎧 Maybe we can have some fun games or activities.
🎧 Great idea, Sarah! 
🎧 We could also give away reusable shopping bags or seed packets.
🎧 Those are both good ideas!
🎧 We could work with the Environmental
🎧 Science Club to reach more people.
🎧 Love that idea, Noah!
🎧 We can talk to them later.
🎧 Now, let's think of more Earth Day event ideas.
🎧 We could have a clothing swap
🎧 to promote sustainable fashion.
🎧 People could bring clothes they don't want and trade them with others.
🎧 I had the same idea as Daniel!

Sport Practice

🎧 Oh my, that practice was tough!
🎧 Tell me about it.
🎧 Coach Miller really pushed us today.
🎧 Did you see him running with us during the drills?
🎧 Yeah, no kidding! He has more energy than all of us together.
🎧 It makes you want to work harder when you see your coach trying so much.
🎧 Totally. He really makes us want to do our best.
🎧 So how's your ankle?
🎧 I saw you fall hard during the practice game.
🎧 It's a little sore, but I think I'll be okay.
🎧 I'll put ice on it tonight and see how it feels in the morning.
🎧 Good.
🎧 We can't have any injuries
🎧 before the big game next week.
🎧 I know right?
🎧 We need everyone to be at their best to beat the Wildcats.
🎧 Speaking of the game, are you coming
🎧 to the pre-game pep rally on Friday?
🎧 Absolutely!
🎧 We need to get excited for the win!

Research Project

🎧 This research paper is giving me a headache.
🎧 I feel like I'm not getting anywhere.
🎧 Me too.
🎧 I've been looking at the same paragraph for about 20 minutes.
🎧 Maybe we're not on the right path.
🎧 Have you found any good sources recently?
🎧 Not really.
🎧 Most of the articles I found are too technical
🎧 and don't talk about the social impacts we wanted to focus on.
🎧 Ugh, that's frustrating.
🎧 Wait, Professor Lee mentioned a documentary that might help.
🎧 Did you check the library database for it?
🎧 No, I completely forgot!
🎧 That's a good idea.
🎧 Maybe it will give us some new ideas.
🎧 Hopefully.
🎧 In the meantime, I'll search some social science journals.
🎧 We just need to find the right keywords.
🎧 Maybe we can think of some together.
🎧 Definitely! Two heads are better than one.
🎧 Let's grab some coffee first.
🎧 Maybe a little caffeine will help us figure this out.
🎧 I totally agree.
🎧 If nothing works, we can always meet with Professor Lee for some help.

Career fair

🎧 May I ask you some questions about your company?
🎧 Absolutely! Welcome to the Technovation booth.
🎧 My name's Ben.
🎧 What are you interested in?
🎧 My name's Jake.
🎧 I'm studying computer science, and I'm
🎧 really interested in software development.
🎧 What kind of opportunities do
🎧 you have for new graduates?
🎧 Technovation is always looking for talented developers.
🎧 We have an internship program that's a great way to get started.
🎧 Oh, interesting! Can you tell me more about the internship program?
🎧 What kind of projects would interns work on?
🎧 Interns will get to work
🎧 on different projects,
🎧 from adding new features to our software
🎧 to creating new applications.
🎧 We encourage interns to share their ideas and take part in the development process.
🎧 That sounds really good.
🎧 Do you have any brochures or information I can take with me?
🎧 Absolutely! Here you go.
🎧 And be sure to check our website
🎧 for more details
🎧 on the internship program
🎧 and other career opportunities.
🎧 We also attend other career fairs
🎧 throughout the year
🎧 so if you don't hear back from us this time, feel free to meet us at another event.
🎧 Thank you so much.
🎧 This has been really helpful.
🎧 You're welcome, Jake!
🎧 Good luck with your job search.

Cultural Event

🎧 Hey May, have you seen this?
🎧 Oh wow, a Vietnamese Culture Festival on campus next week! That's cool!
🎧 Right? I didn't know they were doing something like this.
🎧 This makes me feel homesick already.
🎧 We should definitely go!
🎧 It would be a fun way
🎧 to celebrate our culture
🎧 and share Vietnamese traditions
🎧 with others.
🎧 The poster says there will be traditional food vendors.
🎧 I miss banh mi and rice noodles already.
🎧 My mouth is watering just thinking about them.
🎧 Maybe they'll even have sweet soup for dessert!
🎧 Will there be any performances?
🎧 Yes, there will be Vietnamese
🎧 folk music performances.
🎧 What about Vietnamese coffee?
🎧 I hope so!
🎧 Nothing beats a strong cup of iced milk
🎧 coffee to finish the experience.
🎧 We should bring some of our friends
🎧 who don't know about Vietnamese culture.
🎧 It would be a great way
🎧 to show them our traditions.
🎧 Let's check the poster for the time and place.
🎧 Okay, it looks like it's happening next Saturday afternoon at the student center.
🎧 Let's mark it on our calendars so we don't miss it.

[004] English Speaking Course 004

Do you like to dance?

🎧 Wow, that's beautiful! What song is that?
🎧 Thanks! It's a traditional tune called "Song of the Night Wind."
🎧 Welcome to the market! Can I interest you in anything?
🎧 The music is enough for me, but maybe later.
🎧 Do you play here often?
🎧 You're really good.
🎧 Most nights. Music is my passion.
🎧 Where are you visiting from?
🎧 All over! I love exploring new places and experiencing the culture.
🎧 This market is amazing!
🎧 Then you must see the silk scarves over there.
🎧 They're perfect for dancing under the stars.
🎧 Dancing?
🎧 Is there a party tonight?
🎧 Not exactly, but the music always draws a crowd.
🎧 Do you like to dance?
🎧 More than anything! I can't resist a good beat.
🎧 Then why don't you show me your moves?
🎧 I can provide the music.
🎧 Challenge accepted!

What is your favorite holiday?

🎧 This place has a really nice atmosphere.
🎧 Perfect for a first date, wouldn't you say?
🎧 Absolutely. It's even better than I expected from the pictures online.
🎧 So, Daniel, tell me a bit about yourself.
🎧 What do you like to do for fun outside of work?
🎧 Well, I'm a bit of a movie buff.
🎧 I try to catch at least a couple of new releases every month.
🎧 What about you?
🎧 Any hidden talents or hobbies?
🎧 Hmm, not exactly hidden, but I love baking.
🎧 Especially cakes and pastries.
🎧 There's something so relaxing about creating something delicious from scratch.
🎧 Speaking of next dates, what's your favorite holiday?
🎧 Does that sound like a weird question?
🎧 Not at all.
🎧 Actually, it's a great way to learn about someone's traditions and interests.
🎧 For me, it's hard to choose between Thanksgiving and New Year's Eve.
🎧 Thanksgiving because of the big family gathering and delicious food,
🎧 and New Year's because it's a chance for a fresh start.
🎧 Interesting! I love Thanksgiving too,
🎧 but my favorite is probably the summer solstice festival in my hometown.
🎧 We have a huge bonfire, live music, and everyone wears flower crowns.
🎧 It's a real celebration of life and nature.
🎧 Wow, that sounds amazing!
🎧 I'd love to experience something like that someday.
🎧 Maybe we could even plan a trip around it.
🎧 Who knows, maybe we'll be celebrating summer solstice together next year.

Do you like to exercise?

🎧 Hey there, sorry about the barking!
🎧 He gets excited around other people.
🎧 Don't worry at all. He looks friendly.
🎧 Golden retrievers are the best.
🎧 What's his name?
🎧 This is Charlie. He keeps me company on my walks.
🎧 What about you?
🎧 Training for a marathon or just enjoying the day?
🎧 Just a casual jog to clear my head after work.
🎧 It's amazing how a little exercise can improve your mood.
🎧 Do you like to exercise?
🎧 I try to!
🎧 Walking Charlie is definitely a workout in itself.
🎧 Sometimes I go for a swim too, especially on hot days like this.
🎧 Swimming sounds refreshing.
🎧 I used to do gymnastics when I was younger,
🎧 but these days it's mostly running.
🎧 Wow, gymnastics! That takes some serious dedication.
🎧 Maybe you could teach Charlie a trick or two?
🎧 He'd love that.
🎧 Mind if Charlie joins you on your next lap?
🎧 Maybe you two can become running buddies.
🎧 Running buddies? I think Charlie would love that company.
🎧 Perfect!

What is your favorite TV show?

🎧 First time at the dentist? You seem a little tense.
🎧 Maybe a little.
🎧 Need a cavity filled, nothing major.
🎧 What about you?
🎧 Nervous about the drill?
🎧 Actually, I'm just here for a checkup. Hopefully, a quick one!
🎧 So, to distract ourselves, what is your favorite TV show?
🎧 Movies, definitely! Big action films and comedies are my favorites.
🎧 It's a good way to escape from reality, you know?
🎧 I understand that!
🎧 What about TV shows? Any good ones you recommend?
🎧 Hmm, there's this new sci-fi show I love.
🎧 It's about a group of astronauts exploring a strange planet.
🎧 What's the name of the show? Maybe I'll give it a try.
🎧 It's called "Galaxy Quest."
🎧 It's pretty popular, so you might have heard of it already.
🎧 I actually haven't! But thanks for the recommendation.

What is your favorite dessert?

🎧 Wow, what is that incredible smell?
🎧 It smells like heaven.
🎧 Bonjour! That would be my croissants, fresh out of the oven this morning.
🎧 Would you like to try one?
🎧 Croissants? They look amazing! Yes, please!
🎧 Here you go. Be careful, it's hot!
🎧 Oh, my gosh, this is the best thing I have ever tasted!
🎧 So buttery and flaky...
🎧 I'm glad you like it.
🎧 We use a special recipe here, passed down through generations.
🎧 Thanks for inviting me over, Mary.
🎧 No problem at all.
🎧 Always happy to cook for a good friend.
🎧 And besides, I knew you'd appreciate a break from instant ramen.
🎧 You got that right.
🎧 Speaking of good food, what's your favorite dessert?
🎧 Hmm, that's a tough one.
🎧 I love a classic slice of chocolate cake,
🎧 but there's something so comforting about a warm apple pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
🎧 What about you?
🎧 I love a good brownie, especially with some chopped nuts and a glass of cold milk.

Do you have a best friend?

🎧 Still reading that same book?
🎧 Lost in the world again. It's amazing!
🎧 Fantasy adventure, huh? Not my thing, but you seem hooked.
🎧 It's more than that.
🎧 It's about friendship and loyalty... you know, the important stuff.
🎧 Loyalty?
🎧 Do you have a best friend, besides fictional characters?
🎧 You kidding? You're stuck with me, remember?
🎧 True, true.
🎧 But seriously, do you have someone you tell everything to?
🎧 Someone who gets you?
🎧 Absolutely.
🎧 We've been together for ten years.
🎧 Now that's the kind of loyalty I can appreciate.

What is your favorite subject in school?

🎧 Dude, where'd you get all that food? Sharing fries?
🎧 Maybe. Depends on your answer to a very important question.
🎧 Shoot. Math test tomorrow, do you need notes or something?
🎧 Nope. Easier. What is your favorite subject in school?
🎧 The one you actually enjoy, not the one that puts you to sleep.
🎧 Easy. Art class. Hands down.
🎧 Getting messy, creating stuff... way better than memorizing random numbers.
🎧 Sounds cool. I'm all about English class.
🎧 Telling stories, analyzing characters... feels like stepping into another world.
🎧 Are you good at making them up yourself?
🎧 Maybe. I write sometimes in a secret notebook.
🎧 Nothing too serious.
🎧 Maybe you could share some stories sometime?
🎧 Depends on the story.
🎧 Anything involving explosions or zombies and the fries are all yours.
🎧 Deal!

Do you like to draw or paint?

🎧 Hey Nadia! Nice drawing in class today.
🎧 Where are you headed?
🎧 Thanks! Just to the park.
🎧 Sunshine and fresh air, you know? Maybe draw a bit.
🎧 Do you like to draw or paint at all?
🎧 Yes, I want to learn, but I can't draw like you now!
🎧 Cool! I was just about to play frisbee with Ben. Want to join?
🎧 Hmm... frisbee, huh? Sounds fun, but I'm not very sporty.
🎧 No worries! It's easy.
🎧 You just throw the frisbee and catch it.
🎧 You make it sound interesting.
🎧 Okay, maybe I'll give it a try.
🎧 Not really.
🎧 I'm more into sports and video games.
🎧 But hey, maybe you can teach me some drawing stuff sometime?
🎧 Maybe! But first, let's see if I can catch this game without making a complete mess.

What is your favorite animal?

🎧 Hey Noah, what are you looking at on your phone?
🎧 It's a video about red pandas.
🎧 They're so cute.
🎧 Red pandas? I don't think I've ever seen one.
🎧 What do they look like?
🎧 They're kind of a mix between a fox and a raccoon.
🎧 But they're red and fluffy with a long, bushy tail.
🎧 Wow, that sounds adorable!
🎧 What are they doing in the video?
🎧 They're just climbing around in a tree, munching on leaves.
🎧 They're actually vegetarians, you know!
🎧 So, are red pandas your favorite animal?
🎧 I really like red pandas, but I also love dogs.
🎧 They're so loyal and playful.
🎧 What about you?
🎧 Do you have a favorite animal?
🎧 Oh yes! I love cats. They're so independent and cuddly at the same time.
🎧 Plus, they're always cleaning themselves, which is pretty cool.
🎧 Cats are great, too.

Do you enjoy playing video games?

🎧 Alex, what's up? You seem relaxed!
🎧 Yeah, I just beat the final level on that new space shooter game.
🎧 Feels good.
🎧 A space shooter, huh?
🎧 Do you enjoy playing video games?
🎧 Totally! I love the challenge and the feeling of accomplishment when you finally win.
🎧 What about you?
🎧 I used to play some when I was younger, but not so much anymore.
🎧 Maybe I should pick it back up again.
🎧 You should! There are so many great games out now
🎧 I love exploring new places and meeting interesting people.
🎧 Maybe there's a game like that?
🎧 There might be!
🎧 Maybe you can recommend one for me sometime?
🎧 Absolutely! We could even play together if you want.
🎧 Really? Thanks, Alex!

What is your favorite fruit?

🎧 Wow, this weather is perfect for a picnic!
🎧 Absolutely! Fresh air, good food... what more could you ask for?
🎧 Speaking of good food, I made this fruit salad.
🎧 Hope you like it.
🎧 Looks delicious! What kind of fruit did you put in?
🎧 Strawberries, blueberries, kiwi... oh, and some juicy mangoes!
🎧 Mangoes? You know they're my absolute favorite!
🎧 Really? They're not the easiest to eat at a picnic, are they?
🎧 Who cares? They're worth the mess!
🎧 What about you, Lisa? What's your favorite fruit?
🎧 Maybe watermelon?
🎧 It's so refreshing on a hot day like this.
🎧 Great choice!
🎧 Especially with a little sprinkle of salt, right?
🎧 Exactly! We can definitely share a slice later.
🎧 But first, let's dig into this fruit salad.
🎧 Can't wait!

Do you like to sing?

🎧 Wow, Liam, is that a guitar?
🎧 Yep! Thought it might be fun to play a few tunes after lunch.
🎧 That sounds lovely! Do you like to sing?
🎧 A little bit. Mostly just for myself, you know?
🎧 I bet you're great!
🎧 I used to sing in the school choir, but I wouldn't dare sing in front of people anymore.
🎧 Really? Why not?
🎧 My voice isn't exactly... award-winning.
🎧 But singing along to music, that's always fun!
🎧 How about this, after we eat, I play a few songs,
🎧 and you can sing along if you want.
🎧 Okay. Maybe I'll even surprise myself with some hidden talent.
🎧 Sounds good to me.

What is your favorite sport to watch?

🎧 Wow, close game! Who are they playing?
🎧 Oh, that's the city finals for basketball.
🎧 My team, the Hawks, are down by two points!
🎧 Really? Basketball? What is your favorite sport to watch?
🎧 Definitely basketball.
🎧 The fast pace, the teamwork, the buzzer-beater shots... it's all so exciting.
🎧 I can't say I understand the excitement of basketball.
🎧 Isn't it just running and throwing a ball?
🎧 There's a lot more to it than that, Ava!
🎧 The strategy, the skill... it's like watching a chess match played really fast.
🎧 Hmm, maybe. Still, I prefer watching something more graceful.

Do you enjoy going to the beach?

🎧 Ugh, this heat is unbearable! I wish I was somewhere cool right now.
🎧 Me too! How about a trip to the beach this weekend?
🎧 Do you enjoy going to the beach?
🎧 The beach? You know I love the beach!
🎧 Sun, sand, waves... sounds perfect.
🎧 Exactly! We could build sandcastles, swim in the ocean
🎧 Maybe even try some surfing lessons.
🎧 Surfing lessons? Are you sure?
🎧 I wouldn't want to wipe out in front of everyone.
🎧 Come on, it'll be fun.
🎧 We can learn together.

[005] English Speaking Course 005

Family Life

🎧 Good morning! How is everyone today?
🎧 Good morning, honey! I'm feeling good. And you?
🎧 I have a lot of work to do, but it should be okay.
🎧 You're lucky! I'm feeling terrible right now
🎧 What's wrong, Lily?
🎧 I'm having a math test this morning! Urgh! I hate math!
🎧 Math tests can be tough, but you'll be fine, honey!
🎧 Your dad is right! You will do well!
🎧 No, you don't understand how hard math can be!
🎧 Of course we do! We once went to school, just like you!
🎧 If so, can you tell me how to pass the test?
🎧 Just stay calm, and remember what you studied.
🎧 I don't even understand what I studied!
🎧 Lily, if you need help, just ask. We're here for you.
🎧 Thanks, Dad. Maybe I will need lots of it later!
🎧 Hey, kiddo, I have an important meeting today, too! Let's do our best, alright?
🎧 Fine, Dad...
🎧 Now, does anyone want some milk?
🎧 I'll pass that.
🎧 I prefer a fresh cup of orange juice
🎧 in the morning.
🎧 Here you are! And you, Lily? Would you like some?
🎧 No, thanks, Mom! I think I will skip breakfast today!
🎧 You should eat something or else your brain won't work!
🎧 Listen to your mom, Lily! Here, have some pancakes!
🎧 Thanks, Dad!
🎧 Donna, did you invite anyone else for dinner tonight?
🎧 No, why?
🎧 Because Aunt Martha is at the door.
🎧 Oh no, not her again.
🎧 Mom, I don't want to deal with her today.
🎧 She always complains.
🎧 Neither do I, honey!
🎧 What should we do?
🎧 You guys stay here. I'll handle this!
🎧 Oh, what a surprise!
🎧 What are you doing here?
🎧 I don't know, Donna.
🎧 I thought I'd drop by for dinner.
🎧 Oh, Aunt Martha! You should have told us earlier!
🎧 A little surprise is nice, isn't it?
🎧 Well, unfortunately, I'm not sure you should join us for dinner today?
🎧 Why not?
🎧 Because we have some pasta
🎧 with lots of nuts in it.
🎧 Oh my! Nuts?!!
🎧 Yes, and as far as I remember, you're allergic to them, right?
🎧 Definitely! They can send me straight to the emergency room!
🎧 Maybe you should let us know if you want to come next time, Auntie?
🎧 You're right! What a shame! I just wanted to see you all.
🎧 Maybe another time?
🎧 Alright, maybe another time. I'll just go then.
🎧 That was close. Why is she always dropping by uninvited?
🎧 I don't know. But it's better she didn't come in.
🎧 Let's hope we don't have to do that again.
🎧 Agreed. Now, let's enjoy our dinner.
🎧 Yeah, finally! I'm starving!
🎧 Alright, let's get some milk.
🎧 Which brand should we buy?
🎧 I think we should get the big brand. We always do, right?
🎧 No, I prefer the local brand. It's cheaper and better quality.
🎧 But look at this one! It's on sale. We should get this.
🎧 But the local brand is tastier...
🎧 I can't tell the difference, honey!
🎧 That's because you've never tried it before!
🎧 How about we get both?
🎧 Are you sure?
🎧 I'm sure we can compare and see which one we like best.
🎧 Alright, if you say so!
🎧 Now, let's move on to the next aisle.
🎧 Oh, right. We still need to get some bread.
🎧 Did Dad tell you what kind of bread he wanted us to buy?
🎧 Urgh! I completely forgot!
🎧 Well, I guess we'll have to call him to find out then!
🎧 Mom, we need eggs, too! We ran out this morning.
🎧 I see. A dozen should be enough.
🎧 Yeah, and don't forget we're also out of orange juice.
🎧 Speaking of juice, do we need anything for dinner? Like pasta or something?
🎧 Oh, good idea. I think we're low on pasta. Maybe some sauce too?
🎧 Definitely.
🎧 And I think we need some snacks for the weekend as well!
🎧 How about some chips?
🎧 Chips sound good. And maybe some cookies too?
🎧 Sure, cookies it is! Alright, let's grab all that and then call Dad about the bread.
🎧 Hey, Mom, Dad, I'm thinking about getting a part - time job!
🎧 Really? That's great! What kind of job are you looking at?
🎧 Well, I'm not sure. I have two options.
🎧 What are they?
🎧 I can work at the fast food place
🎧 or do babysitting.
🎧 Hmm, both sound good.
🎧 What do you think about the fast food place?
🎧 It's close to school, and I'll be working with friends.
🎧 That sounds great!
🎧 But it might be really busy and noisy.
🎧 And what about babysitting? How do you feel about that?
🎧 Babysitting is quieter and I like kids
🎧 This option isn't bad either!
🎧 But it might be less money and I'd have to go to different houses.
🎧 So, what do you think?
🎧 I'm thinking about working at a fast food place. But...
🎧 But?
🎧 But it might be more stressful.
🎧 Lily, working with kids is also stressful.
🎧 Your mom is right! Working with kids and playing with them are different!
🎧 Now you're scaring me!
🎧 I want you to know what you are getting in!
🎧 Well, if you say so, I think I will go for the fast food job!
🎧 Alright then, fast food job it is! When will you start?
🎧 I haven't even sent my resume yet!
🎧 Tell me if you need help with your resume!
🎧 Thanks, Dad! I will!
🎧 Guys! Sit up! We need to talk.
🎧 Why are you looking so serious, Mom? Am I in trouble?
🎧 What's up, honey? Is everything okay?
🎧 Not really. We need to talk about house chores. It's getting messy.
🎧 Is it? I think everything is going well...
🎧 Don't you see?! Our house is a mess!
🎧 Alright, alright! So, what do you think we should do?
🎧 We need to clean it up right away.
🎧 Right now?! But I'm in the middle of this movie! Can we do it later?
🎧 The movie can wait! The house can't!
🎧 Fine! What do you want me to do?
🎧 First, you need to clean up your bedroom and bathroom. They're disasters!
🎧 Got it, Mom!
🎧 I'll take care of the second floor.
🎧 Well, I can do the vacuuming and take out the trash.
🎧 And please clear out the garage as well, honey!
🎧 What's wrong with the garage?
🎧 Everything! You left your tools everywhere after you fixed the car last week!
🎧 Alright. I'll put them away.
🎧 Thanks! I really appreciate it! And don't forget to mow the lawn!
🎧 But I just did it last week!
🎧 I know, but the grass has already grown!
🎧 Fine... I think I really need a good massage after this.
🎧 So do I, Dad!
🎧 So, about our summer trip, where should we go this year?
🎧 I was thinking about the beach. It would be nice to relax by the sea.
🎧 That sounds great! I love the beach. We could swim and build sandcastles.
🎧 But didn't we go to the beach last year?
🎧 So? Beaches are always great, aren't they?
🎧 The beach is nice, but I was also thinking about a mountain trip.
🎧 What can we do on a mountain?!
🎧 Well, we can hike and enjoy nature.
🎧 Mountains are beautiful, but we'd need more preparation. The beach is simpler.
🎧 Plus, the beach sounds more fun to me!
🎧 How about a place that has both a beach and mountains?
🎧 Do such places exist?
🎧 Yes, actually. Some places have both. We could look for a location like that.
🎧 That sounds like a good idea. We get the best of both worlds.
🎧 I'm in! And it'll be better if there are some local attractions, like museums or parks.
🎧 I hope so!
🎧 Sounds like a plan.
🎧 Awesome! I can't wait to start planning.
🎧 Me too. I'll look up some places and we can decide.
🎧 Great. This is going to be a fun trip.
🎧 Definitely. I'm looking forward to it!
🎧 Mom, Dad, I want to have a sleepover party this weekend!
🎧 A sleepover? That sounds fun. Who's coming?
🎧 My friend Mina. We'll have snacks, games, and movies.
🎧 Sounds like a good time. What day are you thinking?
🎧 Saturday night. Mina can come after dinner. Is that okay?
🎧 Saturday works for us. But we need to plan a few things.
🎧 Sure, what do we need to do?
🎧 We need to make sure we have enough snacks and drinks.
🎧 Yes, and we should clean the living room so there's space to play games.
🎧 Well, actually, Mina and I will be in my room.
🎧 Lily, that's just an excuse your mom uses to get you to clean up the house!
🎧 Hey, I don't want Mina to come to a messy house, alright?
🎧 Fine, Mom! I'll make sure the house looks neat before she comes!
🎧 Thank you, Lily!
🎧 What are you going to watch?
🎧 Oh, Mina and I want to watch some comedies and maybe a scary movie.
🎧 That sounds perfect for a sleepover party!
🎧 But make sure you go to bed before 11 pm.
🎧 Mom, who sleeps before 11 pm at a sleepover party?
🎧 Lily's right, honey. It's Saturday. They can stay up a bit late!
🎧 Well, before midnight then.
🎧 I'll try my best, Mom! But please don't be mad if we're still awake after midnight!
🎧 As long as you're up at 7 am for breakfast, I'll be fine!
🎧 Who gets up at 7 am on a Sunday?!
🎧 Well, I do.
🎧 Honey, just let the girls sleep in! We can enjoy our own morning in peace.
🎧 Hm... Well, you're right.
