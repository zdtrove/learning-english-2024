[001] Unfulfilled New Year Resolution

On the first morning of the new year, as the sun gently spilled its golden hues over the sleepy town of Evergreen, Gloria sat by her window, writing down her New Year's resolution in her journal. 
It was a simple vow: "This year, I will learn to play the piano."
Gloria's days were consumed by her demanding job as a software developer. 
Nevertheless, she managed to rent a small piano, and squeezed it into her modest apartment. 
Her fingers fumbled across the piano keys. 
With each passing day, they began to dance more confidently, weaving simple tunes into the quiet evenings.
As January melted into February, Gloria's determination never wavered. 
She spent every evening practicing. 
However, as the weeks turned into months, unexpected challenges began to surface. 
Her job demanded increasingly more of her time. 
Over time, the melody of her piano-playing was gradually replaced by the dull drone of her laptop. 
By the time summer arrived, the piano stood silently in a corner of her room, gathering dust, a reminder of a dream gradually fading away.
One quiet evening in late August, as Gloria sat gazing at the untouched piano, a sense of longing washed over her. 
She realized that resolutions are not just about the end goal, but also about the journey and the challenges that come with it.

However, upon unboxing it, she realized it wasn't quite what she expected. 
It didn't feel right on her wrist. 
Frustrated, Cheryl decided to return the smartwatch to the store. 
She carefully repackaged it, and headed out. 
Little did she know, her journey was about to take an unexpected turn.
Arriving at the store, Cheryl approached the customer service desk, only to find a long line snaking its way through the aisles. 
She joined the queue, and shuffled forward. 
Finally reaching the front, she presented the smartwatch and explained her desire to return it. 
The clerk found it was purchased online, and said apologetically, "I'm sorry, ma'am, You'll have to ship it back to the warehouse."
Cheryl's heart sank. Now she faced the prospect of another round of packaging and shipping, with no guarantee of a prompt refund. 
Disheartened but undeterred, Cheryl hurried back home. 
She repackaged the smartwatch, and dropped the package off at the post office.
Cheryl couldn't help but reflect on the irony of the situation. 
In a world where online shopping promised convenience and efficiency, she found herself struggling with the complexities of returning a simple purchase. 
Nevertheless, Cheryl remained optimistic. 
She believed that a smoother online shopping experience would come in the future.
