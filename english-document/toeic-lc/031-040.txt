Hi Elizabeth, please take a seat, make yourself at home.
I called you up here because I have some bad news.
I just looked at the end of the month reports and they aren't good.
For the fifth month in a row, our profits have dropped.
This time, by 8%.
Ugh, I am sorry, Mr. Park.
I don't know what to say, but I share your disappointment.
Our crew is very dedicated,
but for some reason, we haven't been seeing the results we expected.
Well, we need to find a solution.
I am prepared to find new sales agents if that's what needs to be done.
I don't think we need to lay anyone off.
I've been speaking to sources at other companies and it seems like everyone is having this problem.
This time of year has always been a hard time to close deals.
I am going to mix up the sales teams and see if that makes any difference.
