🎧 Hi, I'd like to order a large "Super Supreme" pizza
🎧 and a small double pepperoni pizza with extra cheese
🎧 and extra jalapeno peppers on both.
🎧 I want both pizzas to go, by the way.
🎧 I'm sorry. The "Super Supreme" pizza is a specialty offered in certain outlets only.
🎧 Would you like to try our new stuffed crust pizza instead?
🎧 You may choose up to five toppings for just 17.99.
🎧 Thanks, but I've been meaning to try this specialty pizza for a while.
🎧 Could you point me to another outlet that serves it?
🎧 I live just outside Steveston Village.
🎧 No problem. Hold on...
🎧 uhh, the nearest branch for you is on Moncton Street.
🎧 You might want to call the place first at 888-555-7625.
🎧 Better act quickly.
🎧 I heard this outlet sells out fast.

🎧 Good morning, am I speaking with Rick Rows?
🎧 I'm Geri Calwell, from the head office.
🎧 I am still waiting for the expense reports from January.
🎧 The deadline for the reports is always on the 15th of the next month,
🎧 so I was wondering if something came up?
🎧 Hi, Geri. I'm sorry about that,
🎧 but I actually sent them off on the 12th using the interoffice mail.
🎧 I even remember placing them in the outgoing tray.
🎧 That's bizarre.
🎧 Hmm... Yeah, this has never happened before.
🎧 I will double check with the other departments
🎧 as maybe they got delivered somewhere else in the building.
🎧 Just in case, can you email me the reports as soon as possible?
🎧 I need to work on the report this afternoon,
🎧 so I will need a digital copy, just this once.
🎧 I actually have a meeting at the head office in about an hour.
🎧 I can quickly print another report and drop it off to your office before my meeting, if that suits you?
🎧 Yeah, that would be great.
🎧 I am on the fourth floor, office 402.
🎧 If for some reason I'm not in my office,
🎧 please leave it on my desk.

🎧 Good afternoon, Ms. Laws.
🎧 I'm Alex Jones, and my position is Head of People here at J.P. Bank.
🎧 I know you recently had an interview with the head of the Canal branch,
🎧 and he was very impressed.
🎧 I'm calling today to offer you the job.
🎧 Wow, thank you!
🎧 I am very excited,
🎧 but I am currently still working,
🎧 so I need to resign, which I can do today.
🎧 When did you want me to start?
🎧 Well, as we mentioned in your interview,
🎧 we were hoping the successful candidate would be able to start next week.
🎧 The branch manager said he would make a special exception for you,
🎧 as he thinks you would be a great team member.
🎧 We can extend the start date by an additional week,
🎧 so, two weeks from today.
🎧 I think I can make that work,
🎧 but I should check with my line manager.
🎧 I have been treated well by my current company,
🎧 so I don't want to leave them high and dry.
🎧 I am very excited to move.
🎧 How should I contact you after I speak with my manager?

🎧 Hi George, we really need to figure out a strategic communications campaign for our new jeans line.
🎧 I agree.
🎧 The line has been completed and we are ready to release it,
🎧 so the time has come to hire a public relations agency to oversee the launch.
🎧 I agree, but our budget for advertising is very low for this project.
🎧 I am a little bit stressed that we won't be able to afford a company.
🎧 Have you reached out to any agencies that are near us for an estimate?
🎧 I have worked with an agency called Watergate in the past,
🎧 and I remember they were very cost-effective.
🎧 The agency did a great job, do you remember, Daniel?
🎧 I remember working with them on a lipstick launch.
🎧 They were a great match.
🎧 Oh, fantastic!
🎧 I will reach out to them to see if we can arrange a meeting.
🎧 Thanks, guys!

🎧 Can you help me order a new office chair for the new assistant?
🎧 No problem.
🎧 Do you want me to take a look at the catalog?
🎧 It has chairs that swivel and turn and the ones that tilt back and forward.
🎧 That won't be necessary.
🎧 Just order an office chair that will allow her to adjust the height and comfort level.
🎧 Hmm... Also, keep in mind that our budget per chair is $70 maximum.
🎧 Well, in that case, I think we need to contact a new supplier.
🎧 Our current vendor has raised its prices.
🎧 Really? Do you have someone in mind?
🎧 Yeah, a potential supplier just sent us a catalog a few days ago.
🎧 I'll take a look at the prices and place your order.

🎧 Hey, James, let's go see the musical play Spear Of Hope while we're in New York.
🎧 Sounds good.
🎧 I read a rave review of the play in the paper last week.
🎧 It is said that the staging and costumes are really something to see.
🎧 I think we should buy tickets in advance.
🎧 Good idea.
🎧 I have a PhantomSeat member account,
🎧 so if I book online on this website,
🎧 I can get a maximum of two tickets at a discount price.
🎧 So when do you think we should go?
🎧 It is your call.
🎧 I wonder if the price is cheaper on weekdays.
🎧 I guess so.
🎧 Let me check the website...
🎧 Hmm, it seems like the price is a bit more expensive on weekends.
🎧 Say we go on Thursday at 8 P.M.
🎧 Does that work for you?
🎧 That works.
🎧 We could probably grab a bite to eat before the show.
🎧 Could you book the tickets for us?
🎧 Sounds good to me.
🎧 I'll go get my credit card.

🎧 Good morning.
🎧 I saw on the University's online job board that you were looking to hire a student receptionist.
🎧 Have you filled the position?
🎧 Hi, there.
🎧 We haven't filled the position, but have begun looking over applications.
🎧 We plan to conduct the interviews beginning on Monday.
🎧 Would you like to fill out an application?
🎧 Well, I am very interested,
🎧 but I am taking the maximum amount of credit hours.
🎧 Does the job guarantee flexibility?
🎧 I am concerned that with twenty credit hours, I may not be available as much as the job requires.
🎧 There's some flexibility involved,
🎧 and occasionally, we hire two students to fill one role if it works with their class schedule.
🎧 Please attach a copy of this semester's class schedule to your application.
🎧 This way we can determine the optimal workload for you.

🎧 Do you know how many people have signed up for our marketing conference at the hotel next week?
🎧 So far we have 50 attendees,
🎧 but people are still signing up.
🎧 Yesterday, we had 10 new registrations.
🎧 Do you want to see the list of people who have paid?
🎧 I have to jump on a conference call in five minutes, so I don't have time right now.
🎧 Will you just email me an updated list at the end of the day?
🎧 No problem.
🎧 I also keep a list of people who signed up for our monthly newsletter,
🎧 so I will highlight names of people who haven't signed up,
🎧 maybe we should reach out to them personally.

🎧 I am going ahead and starting installing the new doorknobs on all the doors on the third floor.
🎧 Have you got anything else that needs to be done more urgently?
🎧 I actually just got an email from Mr. Wilson on the third floor.
🎧 He says that his projector is acting up.
🎧 Oh yeah, those things often do.
🎧 I'm going to go ahead and work on the doorknobs
🎧 and then will work on the projector when the students are out of the building later this afternoon.
🎧 He mentioned that he is hoping to use the projector for a project in an hour.
🎧 I know his students are at lunch until 1 P.M.
🎧 So would you be able to go have a quick look now, please?

🎧 Thanks for the tour, Janice.
🎧 The townhouse is conveniently located, and the neighborhood is fairly safe.
🎧 I'm curious, though.
🎧 Do you help arrange mortgages with any banks?
🎧 I know I want the principal and interest payments to be predictable.
🎧 Certainly.
🎧 This brochure here lists all the banking partners that our agency has been working closely with.
🎧 And a word of advice,
🎧 a down payment of 20% or more will help you get a lower interest rate.
🎧 Thanks!
🎧 I'll take a look at it.
🎧 Hopefully, I'm eligible to apply for a home loan.
🎧 My pleasure.
🎧 Please feel free to contact me for any further information.
🎧 You can reach me at my office number.
