🎧 Hello, Osaka Today Restaurant.
🎧 How may I help you?
🎧 Hi, I'd like to make a reservation for 3 for 6 o'clock this Saturday in the name of Josh Price.
🎧 I'm afraid we're fully booked at that time.
🎧 Could an earlier or later time suit you?
🎧 I can fit you in at 5 or 7:30.
🎧 Well, 5 o'clock is a bit early for dinner.
🎧 Let's make it 7:30 then.
🎧 I might have to get back to you because I'm not too sure.
🎧 No problem, Mr. Price.
🎧 Your table will be kept for 15 minutes.
🎧 May I also have your phone number, please?
 
[012] 
🎧 Excuse me, do you have Paul Woodward's latest novel?
🎧 Do you mean The Ebony Snowman?
🎧 Yeah! Do you have it in hardcover?
🎧 Sorry, the hardcover's been sold out for a while.
🎧 But the paperback just came out this week, and we've got plenty.
🎧 Oh, wow. It seems like everyone loves his books.
🎧 Yeah! plus some big bloggers gave it great reviews,
🎧 so it's been flying off the shelves.
🎧 That's actually how I heard about it.
🎧 Where can I find it?
🎧 We're in the new releases section.
🎧 Just head straight to the bestsellers section,
🎧 and you'll find his books right after that.
 
[013]
🎧 Good afternoon, Mr. Peters.
🎧 Glad to see you made it back before the shop closed!
🎧 Did the meeting with the district manager go well?
🎧 I would say it went pretty well.
🎧 I was surprised that she made a couple of suggestions for how we can increase the sales at our store.
🎧 Hmm... interesting.
🎧 I thought our sales were pretty high.
🎧 What suggestions did she make?
🎧 She would like us to highlight our sale items in the front window.
🎧 As you know, once a T-shirt or a pair of trousers are reduced,
🎧 it moves to the back of the store in the sale section.
🎧 She is concerned our customers don't know about this part of the store.
🎧 Oh, I never thought of that.
🎧 I can begin working on the displays right now.
🎧 That would be great, thank you.
🎧 Don't forget, we never put our top selling items on sale,
🎧 so you don't need to make a sign for that.
🎧 Sarah is almost finished cashing out that customer,
🎧 so I will have her assist you when she's finished.

🎧 Hello, Andrea.
🎧 I wanted to reach out regarding your application for the copywriter position at The Everyday Bank.
🎧 My name is Quint Daniels,
🎧 I am the head of HR.
🎧 We would like to invite you in for an interview
🎧 and wanted to check your availability for this week?
🎧 Good morning, Mr. Daniels.
🎧 I appreciate you reaching out.
🎧 I am actually out of town and flying back tomorrow,
🎧 so I am not available until Thursday or Friday.
🎧 That isn't a problem.
🎧 Are you available to come in at noon on Thursday?
🎧 The next step will consist of two parts,
🎧 a small writing challenge and a conversation with the content team.
🎧 The whole process should take about an hour,
🎧 so we can have you out the door by 1.
 
[015]
🎧 Hilary, are you able to help me out?
🎧 My computer keeps disconnecting from the wifi and I don't know what to do.
🎧 Normally, I will Google whatever the problem is, but I can't even do that!
🎧 Ah, I'm sorry Steve.
🎧 I'm on my way to lunch with a client and already running late.
🎧 I won't be back for about two hours,
🎧 but I can try to help you then.
🎧 Andrew helped me with my computer yesterday,
🎧 maybe he is available now.
🎧 Hmm... I can't wait that long.
🎧 I have a lot of work to get done this morning and afternoon.
🎧 I will walk down to the technology department and see if he is available to help me.
🎧 That's a better idea.
🎧 Good luck!
 
[016]
🎧 Have you two taken a look at the progress they've made upstairs on the office expansion?
🎧 It looks great!
🎧 I know!
🎧 I can't believe it!
🎧 And the offices up there have amazing views of the city.
🎧 I wonder which division will move up there when it's finished.
🎧 I heard it's the research department.
🎧 Ah, because they have the most people.
🎧 Probably.
🎧 I'd love to have an office on that floor, though.
🎧 Yeah.
🎧 Well, the company must be making good money if they're adding that space!
🎧 I think you're right, there!
 
[017] 
🎧 Hey, Caroline.
🎧 I hear your agency is managing the largest luxury condo complex yet.
🎧 How's the presale going?
🎧 You mean Albert Park?
🎧 Yeah, homes are just flying off the shelf.
🎧 I'm surprised there's been so much interest in this residential development.
🎧 That's true, considering the hefty price tag.
🎧 But actually, my wife and I are interested since this condo complex is brand new and so close to everything.
🎧 Oh, really?
🎧 We're doing a special promotion.
🎧 If you buy a unit, you get the maximum level of protection for your new home
🎧 thanks to our extended new home warranty.
🎧 That's fantastic!
🎧 Could you tell me more about the proposed amenities?
🎧 Sure, I'd be happy to give you a brochure.
🎧 Hold on... It's in my car.
 
[018] 
🎧 Hello, I bought a laptop here a while back.
🎧 Recently, I've been having major battery life issues.
🎧 A full charge used to last about 5 hours,
🎧 but now my laptop runs out of charge rapidly.
🎧 Umm... This is SuperPad 4.
🎧 Did you apply the latest firmware and driver updates?
🎧 Yeah, back in September, if my memory serves me right.
🎧 Well, this particular firmware update was supposed to enhance battery performance,
🎧 but ever since the recent September update,
🎧 many people have complained about a battery drain of 20%
🎧 even when the machine is turned off.
🎧 That's a real curveball.
🎧 I know battery performance is not covered by the warranty the same way other components are.
🎧 So what would be my best course of action for now?
🎧 Well, you just have to wait until the company rolls out new updates.
🎧 The tech giant is said to be working on a solution.
 
[019] 
🎧 Sharon, how was the feedback on our new mascaras?
🎧 Did we stand out from other brands?
🎧 The product has been a success overall.
🎧 However, we did receive a number of complaints from the customers
🎧 saying that the product didn't live up to their expectations.
🎧 In what aspects exactly?
🎧 Most complaints are about the products not being clearly labeled.
🎧 The consumers feel cheated
🎧 because our mascaras boast an organic formula,
🎧 when, in fact, only a small part of the ingredients are.
🎧 I think we should arrange a discussion with the graphic designers and our product development teams.
🎧 For sure.
🎧 We should come up with a solution to the problem as soon as possible.
🎧 I'll reserve the boardroom for tomorrow morning right away.

🎧 Hello, there.
🎧 Your shop is having a year-end closeout sale this month, right?
🎧 I saw the advertisement on the Internet.
🎧 I'm curious, though, does the sale apply to all the products on display?
🎧 Certainly, they are all 60% off the retail price.
🎧 Today only, if you have a Wsun Bank's credit card,
🎧 you can get an extra 5% off just by using the bank's credit card.
🎧 Actually, I do, but I left it at the office.
🎧 I'd better run now,
🎧 but I'm definitely coming back to get the extra discount.
