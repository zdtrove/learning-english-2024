[Waking up]

🎧 Good morning, Dina. Time to wake up.
🎧 Just five more minutes, Alex.
🎧 Dina!
🎧 Alex, are you awake?
🎧 Did you hear that? Come on!
🎧 If you stay in bed any longer, you'll be late for school.
🎧 Alright.
🎧 Look, Dina, it's morning already.
🎧 The weather is beautiful today.
🎧 Oh, it really is.
🎧 I hope today will be wonderful.
🎧 Get up.
🎧 I'll wait for you so we can brush our teeth together.
🎧 I'll be right there.
 
[Brushing teeth]
 
🎧 Dina, you need to brush for at least two minutes.
🎧 It helps keep your teeth healthy and strong.
🎧 Oh, I know, I know.
🎧 You're always reminding me.
🎧 Do you think I don't brush long enough?
🎧 I'm just making sure you have a bright smile.
🎧 You want to impress your friends, right?
🎧 But you would say I'm late if I'm slow.
🎧 I just want to do it as fast as you say.
🎧 Just 1-2 minutes won't make you late for class.
🎧 I only say that because if you sleep for another 5 minutes,
🎧 it can become 15 minutes or half an hour.
🎧 You will have a hard time controlling yourself because sleep is so attractive.
🎧 You are really serious about everything, brother.
🎧 Anyway, thank you. Sometimes you're like another parent.
🎧 And you are always teasing me.
 
[Morning exercise]
 
🎧 Come on, Dad. Let's do ten more push-ups! You've got this.
🎧 You're really pushing me today, Alex.
🎧 I'm not as young as you are.
🎧 Just trying to keep us fit.
🎧 A healthy body means a healthy mind.
🎧 And you two look funny.
🎧 Want to join us, Dina?
🎧 It's good for you.
🎧 No way! I'll stick to watching.
🎧 Exercise isn't my thing.
🎧 I am preparing breakfast, athletes.
🎧 You guys should get ready.
🎧 Thanks, Mom. We'll be right there.
🎧 Great workout, son.
🎧 Now let's refuel with some delicious breakfast.
 
[Making breakfast]
 
🎧 Thanks for helping, Alex.
🎧 Can you pass me the eggs?
🎧 Sure, Mom. Here you go.
🎧 Do you need me to cut the vegetables too?
🎧 That would be wonderful. Thank you.
🎧 It's always nice to have an extra pair of hands.
🎧 It smells so good, Mom.
🎧 What are you making today?
🎧 I'm starving.
🎧 What's for breakfast?
🎧 Scrambled eggs, toast and orange juice.
🎧 Plus, Alex is cutting some vegetables for an omelet.
🎧 And some fruit, too. We have bananas and apples.
 
[Getting dressed]
 
🎧 Dina, do you need any help picking out your clothes?
🎧 No, Mom. I think I got it.
🎧 But can you help me find my blue sweater?
🎧 Okay.
🎧 Don't forget to pack your bags, sweetie.
🎧 Sure Mom.
🎧 Dina, your blue sweater is in the laundry room.
🎧 Thanks Mom.
🎧 And wear something warm.
🎧 It's chilly outside.
🎧 Don't forget your jackets.
🎧 Got it, Dad.
🎧 Ready, Alex?
🎧 Almost, Just need my shoes.
🎧 Do you think this outfit looks okay?
🎧 You look great. Now hurry up so we can get going.
 
[Commuting to work]
 
🎧 Have a great day at work, Alex.
🎧 Thanks, Mom.
🎧 And you too, my dear girl.
🎧 I love you so much.
🎧 And love you too, Buddy!
🎧 See you this afternoon, babe.
🎧 Dad, I'll walk home with Jimmy today.
🎧 You don't have to pick me up.
🎧 Really? Okay.
🎧 Jimmy just moved here, but you two are so close.
🎧 I'm so very happy about that.
🎧 Yes, Jimmy is in the same class as me, so we often do homework together.
🎧 He helps me a lot.
🎧 It's great to have such a good friend.
🎧 We're here, Dina. Have a nice day.
🎧 Thanks, Dad, have a good day at work.
 
[Morning coffee]
 
🎧 Good morning, Aunt Emma.
🎧 Good morning, Neo. Did you sleep well?
🎧 Yeah. What's for breakfast?
🎧 There's a cereal on the kitchen table.
🎧 I'm having coffee.
🎧 Do you want some toast with your cereal?
🎧 Can I have some juice, too?
🎧 Of course. Pour yourself a glass.
🎧 Do you need help with anything else?
🎧 No. I'm good.
🎧 What time are you leaving for work?
🎧 In about an hour.
🎧 Do you want me to drop you off at school?
🎧 Yes, please.
🎧 It's much faster when you drive me.
🎧 Alright.
🎧 Finish your breakfast and get your school bag ready.
🎧 Okay, Aunt Emma, I'll go get my bag first.
 
[Checking emails]
 
🎧 Let's see what we have today.
🎧 A few client emails and some internal messages.
🎧 Good morning, Ms.
🎧 You go to work early today.
🎧 Good morning, Alex. I just want to check some mail.
🎧 Ready for another busy day?
🎧 I'm always ready.
🎧 Is there anything urgent in the emails?
🎧 Just the usual. I'll forward you the important ones.
🎧 There's a meeting at 10, so make sure you're prepared.
🎧 Thanks. I'll get started right away.
🎧 Do you need any help with the presentation?
🎧 That would be great. Let's go over it together in a bit.
🎧 Sure thing.
 
[Team meeting]
 
🎧 Alright, everyone. Let's get started. We have a lot to cover today.
🎧 First up is the new marketing campaign.
🎧 We have a few important projects to cover.
🎧 I want to hear everyone's ideas and updates.
🎧 What's the priority for today?
🎧 Are we focusing on the new clients?
🎧 Yes, let's focus on the new marketing campaign first.
🎧 We need to finalize a strategy by the end of the week.
🎧 Sounds good. I have some ideas to share.
🎧 We can use social media more actively.
🎧 Great. Let's hear them.
🎧 We need to think outside the box.
🎧 And don't forget to consider our budget.
🎧 We need to be efficient with our resources.
🎧 We also need to tell our current clients.
🎧 Should we do that today?
🎧 Yes, but let's focus on the marketing campaign first.
🎧 After that's done, we can update our clients.
🎧 I'll begin writing the strategy document.
🎧 Everyone, please send them your ideas by the end of the day.
 
[Lunch break]
 
🎧 This sandwich is really good, Dina.
🎧 Thanks, Jimmy. My mom made it fresh this morning.
🎧 Your mom is a great cook.
🎧 I wish my mom could make sandwiches like this.
🎧 She is so busy with work that she rarely cooks lunch.
🎧 Yeah, she's the best.
🎧 Next time, I'll ask mom to bring you lunch too.
🎧 You should be understanding to your mom.
🎧 I got it.
🎧 Do you want to play video games after school?
🎧 Sure. That sounds fun.
🎧 What game do you want to play?
🎧 How about the new racing game?
🎧 It's really cool.
🎧 Great choice.
🎧 I'm so excited now.
 
[Afternoon tasks]
 
🎧 Do you need any help with the report, Ms.?
🎧 The data seems a bit complicated.
🎧 Yes, please.
🎧 Can you check the data for me and make sure everything is correct?
🎧 Of course.
🎧 I'll get right on it.
🎧 We need this report ready by tomorrow, right?
🎧 Yes, it's for the client meeting.
🎧 They want to see our progress.
🎧 No problem. That's what I'm here for.
🎧 Let's make sure everything is perfect.
🎧 Thanks, Alex. You're a big help.
🎧 How are your other tests going?
🎧 I'm almost done with the marketing strategy document.
🎧 I'll send it to you for review.
🎧 Excellent.
🎧 let's finish this up quickly so we can prepare for the client meeting.
🎧 Okay, I will finish the report right away.
 
[Taking a walk]
 
🎧 Dina, do you want to go to the playground?
🎧 I want to play on the swings.
🎧 Sure, Jimmy. Let's go.
🎧 I also want to rest a little before going on.
🎧 Come on, Dina! You're too slow.
🎧 I'm coming, Jimmy.
🎧 Don't go too far ahead.
🎧 I love our walks.
🎧 It's fun to spend time with you.
🎧 Me too, Dina. It's nice to relax and enjoy the outdoors.
🎧 Look, there's an ice cream truck.
🎧 Can we get some ice cream?
🎧 Why not? Let's have a treat.
🎧 What flavor do you want?
🎧 Chocolate, please! What about you, Jimmy?
🎧 I'll have vanilla.
🎧 Let's enjoy ice creams and then head on.
 
[Snack time]
 
🎧 Dad, can I have some cookies? I'm really hungry.
🎧 Sure. Just don't eat too many. You'll ruin your dinner.
🎧 Thanks, Dad.
🎧 Can Jimmy come over later?
🎧 We promised to play games after school.
🎧 Of course. You two have fun.
🎧 But remember to finish your homework first.
🎧 We will, Dad.
🎧 Jimmy is really good at math.
🎧 He helps me a lot.
🎧 That's great.
🎧 It's important to help each other out.
🎧 Do you need any help with your project?
🎧 No, we've got it under control. Thanks, Dad.
🎧 Alright. Let me know if you need anything.
🎧 I'll be in the living room.
🎧 Thanks, Dad. You're the best.
 
[Finishing work]
 
🎧 Great work today, Alex. We got a lot done.
🎧 Thanks, Emma. It was a productive day.
🎧 The report is ready and the strategy document is complete.
🎧 Let's review the report one more time before sending it to the client.
🎧 We want everything to be perfect.
🎧 I'll make the last changes and send it to you.
🎧 Do you need anything else?
🎧 No, that's all for today.
🎧 Let's head home and rest.
🎧 You deserve a break.
🎧 That sounds good.
🎧 See you tomorrow, Emma.
🎧 Have a good evening.
🎧 See you tomorrow, Alex.
🎧 Drive safely and enjoy your evening.
 
[Driving home]
 
🎧 What a busy day.
🎧 I can't wait to get home and relax.
🎧 Hi, Dina. Hi, Jimmy.
🎧 Hi, Alex! Welcome home.
🎧 How was work?
🎧 It was busy, but good.
🎧 How was your day?
🎧 It was great. We played a lot after school.
🎧 Yeah, and we finish your homework early.
🎧 So now we're just having fun.
🎧 That's awesome.
🎧 I'm glad you both had a good day.
🎧 Hi Buddy!
🎧 Let's go inside and see what Mom and Dad are doing.
 
[Grocery shopping]
 
🎧 Neo, can you grab some tomatoes and onions?
🎧 We need them for the pasta tonight.
🎧 Sure, Aunt Emma.
🎧 Do we have enough cheese at home?
🎧 Yes, we still have some from last week.
🎧 But we need more olive oil.
🎧 Can you get that too?
🎧 I got it.
🎧 What else do we need?
🎧 Let's check our list.
🎧 We need fresh bread, milk and some fruit for tomorrow's lunch.
🎧 Oh, and cereal for breakfast.
🎧 I'll get the bread and milk.
🎧 Do you want to pick the fruits?
🎧 Sure, I'll get some apples and bananas.
🎧 And I also want to get some extra snacks for the week.
🎧 Could I?
🎧 Of course. Good boy.
🎧 It's a reward for going shopping with me to prepare meals.
🎧 I love you the most, Aunt Emma!
🎧 Let's head to the checkout.
 
[Preparing dinner]
 
🎧 Dina, can you help me chop the vegetables?
🎧 Sure, Mom. I'll wash them first.
🎧 Alex, can you set the table?
🎧 Of course, Dad. How many plates do we need?
🎧 Seven. Jimmy's family is joining us for dinner.
🎧 Great, I'll get everything ready.
🎧 I'll start cooking the pasta.
🎧 It should be ready in about 20 minutes.
🎧 Dina, can you pass me the onions?
🎧 Here you go, Mom. I'll start with the tomatoes.
🎧 Thanks, sweetie.
🎧 Alex, do we have enough drinks for everyone?
🎧 Yes, I put some soda and juice in the fridge earlier.
 
[Family time]
 
🎧 Thanks for having us over, Lisa. The dinner was delicious.
🎧 You're welcome, Danny.
🎧 It's always nice to have your family here.
🎧 Jimmy, do you want to play a board game?
🎧 Sure, Dina. Let's play the one with the pirates.
🎧 These two kids are together all day.
🎧 I'm glad Dina has Jimmy.
🎧 You know, we're pretty busy and can't spend much time with him.
🎧 How about we all play together? It will be more fun.
🎧 Good idea. Let's set up the game.
🎧 Who wants to be the captain?
🎧 I do! I love being the captain.
🎧 I'll be the treasure hunter.
🎧 What about you, Alex?
🎧 I'll be the navigator.
🎧 Let's start the adventure!
🎧 I'll be the map reader.
🎧 Let's find that treasure!
🎧 This is going to be fun.
🎧 Let's see who wins.
 
[Watching TV]
 
🎧 Aunt Emma, can we watch the new superhero movie?
🎧 Sure, Neo. But only for an hour, okay?
🎧 You have school tomorrow.
🎧 Okay. I promise.
🎧 Can we have some popcorn too?
🎧 Of course, I'll make some. You get the movie ready.
🎧 I found the movie, Aunt Emma! It's starting soon.
🎧 Great! The popcorn will be ready in a minute.
🎧 Here you go, Neo. Enjoy the movie.
🎧 Thanks, Aunt Emma. This is the best part of the day.
🎧 I'm glad you're enjoying it. Remember, just one hour.
🎧 I remember. I'll go to bed right after.
 
[Laundry room]
 
🎧 More laundry?
🎧 It never seems to end, does it?
🎧 Between work, Jimmy's school uniforms,
🎧 It feels like I'm doing this every day.
🎧 Well, let's solve this together.
🎧 I'll fold the towels while you sort the clothes.
🎧 Deal.
🎧 By the way, did you notice that Jimmy's shirts are getting more wrinkled these days?
🎧 I think he's been skipping the ironing.
🎧 Ah, I'll have a talk with him.
🎧 Maybe we can teach him a thing or two about ironing this weekend.
🎧 Are you free?
🎧 Yes, I am.
🎧 And that's a good idea.
🎧 He's doing great at work, but some life skills wouldn't hurt.
🎧 You know, we make a pretty good team.
🎧 We do.
🎧 And it's nice to have some time together, even if it's just folding laundry.
🎧 Agreed. I'll handle the ironing this weekend.
🎧 We can make it a family lesson.
🎧 Sounds like a plan.
🎧 Maybe we can even ask Jimmy to help out.
 
[Cleaning the house]
 
🎧 Alex, can you help me move this rug?
🎧 I think Buddy's hair is all over it.
🎧 Sure, Dina. Let's roll it up and take it outside to shake it out.
🎧 Do you ever feel like we're just moving dirt around?
🎧 No matter how much we clean, it just keeps coming back.
🎧 That's just life, Dina. But it's worth it to have a clean house.
🎧 Plus, it's kind of nice to see everything neat and tidy.
🎧 I guess so. And it feels good to help out, too.
🎧 Exactly.
🎧 And once we're done, we can relax and enjoy the weekend.
🎧 How about we finish quickly and then take Buddy for a walk later?
🎧 That sounds awesome!
🎧 I'll vacuum the living room while you dust the shelves.
🎧 This place is really starting to shine.
🎧 We should do this more often.
🎧 It does feel good, doesn't it?
🎧 And it's nice that everyone is pitching in.
🎧 Yeah, it's a team effort.
🎧 Maybe we should make this a weekly thing.
🎧 I like that idea.
🎧 We'll keep the house clean, and it gives us some family time together.
🎧 It's good practice for the kids.
🎧 They're going to need these skills when they're out on their own.
🎧 Absolutely.
🎧 Let's finish up and see what the kids are up to.
 
[Walking the dog]
 
🎧 Buddy looks so happy to be outside.
🎧 I think this is his favorite part of the day.
🎧 It's probably mine, too.
🎧 It's nice to get some fresh air after being inside all day.
🎧 Plus, Buddy gets to meet all his dog friends.
🎧 Look, there's Max!
🎧 Mrs. Thompson! How's Max doing?
🎧 He's doing great! Buddy looks like he's having a blast.
🎧 He always does.
🎧 They should have a playdate sometime.
🎧 That's a great idea! We can set something up this weekend.
 
[Talking on the phone]
 
🎧 Yes, Mr. Johnson,
🎧 I have reviewed the proposal and I think we are ready to proceed.
🎧 I will send you the completed documents tomorrow morning.
🎧 That sounds perfect, Emma.
🎧 Your team has done an excellent job, as always.
🎧 Thank you.
🎧 I'll be in touch if there's anything else we need to discuss.
🎧 Have a great evening.
🎧 You too, Emma. Goodbye.
🎧 Another project wrapped up. Now I can finally relax.
🎧 I should probably check on Neo. He's been so quiet tonight.
 
[Evening exercise]
 
🎧 It's been a long day, but it's important to keep up with our exercise routine.
🎧 It is quite difficult to maintain in the beginning.
🎧 You're doing great, babe.
🎧 Just take it one step at a time.
🎧 Thanks, John.
🎧 I'm trying to stay consistent, but it's kind of hard after a long day.
🎧 I get it. But even a little bit each day makes a difference.
🎧 And it helps clear your mind.
🎧 Yeah, I feel that. It's like a reset button for the day.
🎧 Remember to breathe.
🎧 And don't forget to stretch after. It'll help you a lot.
🎧 I will.
🎧 I'll admit, I've been skipping the stretching part lately.
🎧 That's the key to staying flexible and avoiding injuries.
🎧 Let's finish with some stretches together.
🎧 Definitely going to need it.
 
[Taking a shower]
 
🎧 This feels amazing.
🎧 It's the perfect way to end the day.
🎧 Diana, sweetheart. Don't forget to wash your hair.
🎧 And don't take too long.
🎧 Your brother needs to shower, too.
🎧 Okay, mom.
🎧 I'm almost done.
🎧 I should wear a face mask tonight.
🎧 My skin feels a bit dry.
🎧 The bathroom's all yours, Alex.
🎧 Thanks, Diana. I'll be quick.
🎧 No rush.
🎧 I'm just going to relax in my room.
 
[Planning tomorrow]
 
🎧 Let's see.
🎧 I've got that meeting at 10 a.m,
🎧 followed by lunch with Mr. Collins.
🎧 I'll need to prepare those documents tonight.
🎧 I should also review the team's ideas on the project.
🎧 I want to make sure everything's on track.
🎧 Here's your lotus tea. Drink it before bed to help you sleep.
🎧 Thanks, Mom.
🎧 What are you doing?
🎧 I just want to review some work for tomorrow.
🎧 Don't overdo it.
🎧 Your health is the most important thing.
🎧 Thanks, mom.
🎧 I'll be done in a bit.
🎧 Good night, Mom.
🎧 I'll probably chat with Dina for a bit before I go to bed.
🎧 Good night.
🎧 It's going to be a hectic day, but I'm ready.
🎧 Just need to get a good night's sleep.
 
[Brushing hair]
 
🎧 Your hair looks lovely, Dina.
🎧 You've been doing a great job taking care of your hair.
🎧 It's so shiny and healthy.
🎧 Thanks, Mom.
🎧 I've been trying to brush it every night before bed.
🎧 I also use the conditioner that you bought for me.
🎧 That's a good habit to have.
🎧 And it's nice to have these moments together, isn't it?
🎧 Yeah. It is.
🎧 I like it when you braid my hair.
🎧 It's relaxing.
🎧 Me too.
🎧 It reminds me of when you were little.
🎧 You've grown up so fast.
🎧 But I'll always be your little girl, right?
🎧 Always.
🎧 Now I will read a little before going to bed.
🎧 Okay, sweetie, but remember not to read too long.
 
[Reading a book]
 
🎧 "The detective examined the footprint closely,
🎧 noticing the faint trace of mud on the heel…"
🎧 "Who could it be?"
🎧 This mystery book is so interesting.
🎧 I wonder who the thief is.
🎧 Time to go to sleep, Dina. Don't stay up too late reading.
🎧 I know, Mom, but the story is just so good!
🎧 I'm at the part where they're about to catch the thief.
🎧 I know how that feels.
🎧 But you don't want to be tired tomorrow, do you?
🎧 Just one more chapter, please.
🎧 Alright, but only one.
🎧 I love you, Mom.
🎧 Good girl. Sleep tight and don't stay up too late.
🎧 Goodnight, Mom.
 
[Setting an alarm]
 
🎧 Neo, are you still not asleep?
🎧 Yes, Aunt Emma.
🎧 I must have eaten too much popcorn while watching the movie.
🎧 So I'm so full that I can't sleep.
🎧 Oh, Neo.
🎧 You have to get up early tomorrow for school.
🎧 Oh, Aunt Emma, ​​can you set the alarm for me?
🎧 I forgot about that.
🎧 Okay, I'll do it
🎧 Done.
🎧 Do you want me to read you a book to help you sleep?
🎧 I think there's no need, Aunt Emma. You have to work tomorrow.
🎧 Good boy.
 
[Going to bed]
 
🎧 Remember to dust off the blanket before going to bed, son.
🎧 Sure, Mom.
🎧 Today was a good day.
🎧 I finished my homework and had a great time with Dina.
🎧 I wonder what tomorrow will bring.
🎧 I hope it's just as good as today.
🎧 It's great having Dina around.
🎧 Her family is so nice and kind.
🎧 They invited us to dinner so we could spend time together.
🎧 That's right. I'm so happy.
🎧 Tomorrow I'll continue to do homework with Dina,
🎧 and then help with the housework.
🎧 I really want to help you and Dad.
🎧 Such a good boy, Jimmy.
🎧 This weekend, we plan to teach you how to iron clothes properly.
🎧 Would you like to join us?
🎧 Of course, Mom.
🎧 It's been a long time since we had time together.
🎧 Deal.
🎧 Alright. Sleep tight, Jimmy.
🎧 Good night, Mom.
🎧 Even though they're busy, they still make time for me.
🎧 Time to sleep!

[The story ended in the simplest way]

🎧 Hey. Do you know the conflict
🎧 between Andrea and Mina?
🎧 Of course. I was there the whole time.
🎧 Me too.
🎧 But I didn't know what happened at the end.
🎧 Why?
🎧 I had to come back home. What happened after i left?
🎧 Well, they quarreled and had a little
🎧 scuffle and some teachers game.
🎧 Yeah, I left when Mr. David was coming.
🎧 Yes.
🎧 Then he was able to stop them.
🎧 And then?
🎧 Then they apologized to each other in front of everyone.
🎧 So what made them fight like that?
🎧 They misunderstood each other.
🎧 Only David knows because he spoke directly to them.
🎧 I got it. So it all ended well.
🎧 Yeah, they quarreled and they apologized. That's all.
🎧 The story ended in the simplest way.

[I had a hard time making this]

🎧 I have a present for you.

🎧 I love you, but how did you make it?
🎧 Well, I saw this model accidentally on the Internet.
🎧 I intended to buy it for you.
🎧 But why did you make it yourself?
🎧 I just thought that if I made it for you, you
🎧 would be happier when you see my effort.
🎧 Oh, so sweet.
🎧 It has some problems, but they're minor.
🎧 I hope you don't notice them.
🎧 No problem. This is the first time I received
🎧 such a wonderful handmade gift.
🎧 It's quite difficult to make it,
🎧 but it makes me feel great.
🎧 Thanks again.

[It was certainly worth it]

🎧 What's wrong? You look so tired!
🎧 Right. I'm not tired, I'm exhausted.
🎧 What did you do last night?
🎧 I spent my whole night reading all the articles as well as newspapers about the topic of the assignment.
🎧 Oh, really?
🎧 Yeah.
🎧 I found lots of useful information
🎧 but I feel exhausted now.
🎧 Why don't you continue reading today?

🎧 Right. The result was good.
🎧 Well, it was certainly worth it. You worked so hard.

[Keep it under your hat]

🎧 Sarah, It's Alex, Andrea's boyfriend.
🎧 Yeah. Why are you calling me?
🎧 I want to ask you something.
🎧 Go on.
🎧 You know, Andrea's birthday is coming but I haven't decided what I should give her.
🎧 Well. She likes a lot of things.
🎧 I asked her but she just said: "No, you don't need to buy me anything. It's fine".
🎧 She always thinks for you.
🎧 I know.
🎧 So I need your advice. You are her best friend.
🎧 Well, Andrea is the happiest girl in the world when she has a boyfriend like you.
🎧 Thank you.
🎧 She loves to make up so I think that
🎧 make-up items are the best choice.
🎧 That's a good idea. Thank you.
🎧 And please keep it under your hat.
🎧 Of course. I won't tell her.

[That girl is so strange]

🎧 Have you met our new classmate?
🎧 Yeah. Let me remember her name. Anne, right?
🎧 Right. She's quite pretty.
🎧 I was impressed by her smile.
🎧 She's got a bright smile.
🎧 I can see it. But that girl is so strange.
🎧 Why?
🎧 Yesterday was her first day at school
🎧 but she hadn't prepared anything.
🎧 Really?
🎧 Yeah. I sat next to her.
🎧 She didn't bring her textbooks, books, or pens. Not even her backpack.
🎧 Wow. So how could she learn?
🎧 She did nothing in class.
🎧 I can't understand her.
🎧 Neither can I. Anyway, she was kind
🎧 of sociable. She talked to everyone.
🎧 That's a good point.

[I've seen that guy before]

🎧 Is that guy looking at you?
🎧 Who?
🎧 Behind you. Can you see him?
🎧 Yeah.
🎧 Do you know him? Why is he looking at us?
🎧 Oh, that's Alex. I've seen him before.
🎧 Alex? Who is he?
🎧 We met each other at a party quite a long time ago. Maybe he still remember me.
🎧 I got it.
🎧 But are you close?
🎧 No. We didn't exchange numbers or Instagrams
🎧 Well, that's so strange.
🎧 Yeah. But I think I should go to say hello to him.
🎧 Sure. I will wait for you.
🎧 I will come back soon.

[Can I talk to you before you go home?]

🎧 Anne, can we talk now?
🎧 Oh, I'm sorry.
🎧 Mrs. Sarah asked me to do something for her.
🎧 Oh, I understand.
🎧 But what happened? Is there
🎧 anything bad? You look so serious.
🎧 No, no, I'm just a bit tired. I will talk to you later.
🎧 What is it about?
🎧 Our project. I have some plans next month and I wanna talk to you to arrange the time properly.
🎧 Are. Okay.
🎧 Can I talk to you before you go home?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 What time will you go home?
🎧 I'm not sure. When I finish my work.
🎧 Is 5:30 p.m good?
🎧 Yeah. Maybe.
🎧 Okay. If anything changes, please call me.
🎧 Sure.

[You should avoid alcohol]

🎧 Let me tell you, Liam.
🎧 the party last night was lit!
🎧 Jamie, are you drunk again?
🎧 Even when we're at the hospital.
🎧 Come on, you only live once!
🎧 I'm just here for a regular checkup.
🎧 Oh, it's my turn.
🎧 I'm going to go in and see the doctor.
🎧 Is everything okay?
🎧 What did the doctor say?
🎧 Oh, I messed up, dude.
🎧 The doctor said if I didn't quit drinking, I'll need proper therapy and treatment.
🎧 And it's getting worse.
🎧 I'm so sorry to hear that.
🎧 Jesus....
🎧 You should avoid alcohol.
🎧 I know. I know...
🎧 Hey, what's that?
🎧 Oh, the poor man got drunk,
🎧 then crashed his car into a bridge.
🎧 Seriously injured.
🎧 Gosh, I need to stop drinking.
🎧 Right...
🎧 Drinking is fun sometimes,
🎧 but the consequences are not worth it.

[I'd like to transfer some money to this account]

🎧 Hi, sir.
🎧 What can I do for you?
🎧 Unbelievable!!
🎧 My son hasn't got the money I sent last week!
🎧 I'm sorry to hear that, sir.
🎧 The receiving bank takes extra time to process it,
🎧 so your recipient will get the money by Wednesday.
🎧 Wednesday? Lord!
🎧 Whatever...
🎧 Well, now... I'd like to transfer some money to this account.
🎧 Not my son's, though.
🎧 For my aunt living in Israel.
🎧 It's written here.
🎧 Sir, this is an international bank transfer so we need to convert currencies first.
🎧 Alright, so my aunt will get the money after 2 days as usual, right?
🎧 Oh. I'm afraid to inform you of this, sir.
🎧 Because of the Yom Kippur holiday in Israel,
🎧 Your transfer may be delayed a couple of days.
🎧 Delayed again!!!

[Green with envy]

🎧 Rob! I'm tired of all the cooking and cleaning stuff!
🎧 Why don't we just eat out?
🎧 Oh, honey, you know we're saving money.
🎧 Next week, I'm gonna take you to Taco Bell, ok?
🎧 Taco Bell?
🎧 Are you kidding me?
🎧 Do you know that Smantha's husband took her to a 5-star Michelin restaurant down in Manhattan yesterday?
🎧 Her husband even plans to take her
🎧 to Italy for their anniversary next week.
🎧 Rachel, look at you.
🎧 You're green with envy.
🎧 Stop messing around!
🎧 Well, look at my so-called husband.
🎧 What did you get me for my birthday last year?
🎧 You totally forgot!!!
🎧 Jesus. Years ago.
🎧 Let it go, Rachel.

[Wait behind the yellow line]

🎧 Mommy, look!
🎧 The railway tunnel looks huge.
🎧 But where is the train?
🎧 The train hasn't come yet.
🎧 Come and stay behind the yellow line, Luca.
🎧 All right, Mommy.
🎧 Oh, I want to see what's in there.
🎧 Watch out!
🎧 You shouldn't cross that yellow line. It's dangerous!
🎧 Oh, my bad.
🎧 Oh, Is the train coming?
🎧 Oh, yes, honey, it's our train.
🎧 Can't wait!
🎧 I'm going to go first. Let's go, Mom.
🎧 Wait, Luca! The door hasn't been opened yet.
🎧 Remember what Mommy said...
🎧 You wait behind the yellow line!

[Could you trim my beard, please?]

🎧 Oh my god! I can't believe this.
🎧 Is that you, Jonathan?
🎧 Hey, Benjamin. It's been 5 years, right?
🎧 Oh, I almost didn't recognize you because of the beard.
🎧 Gosh, it's driving me crazy right now.
🎧 My daughter doesn't even talk to me.
🎧 What? Are you serious?
🎧 The little girl writes to you every week!
🎧 I know, but she doesn't recognize me with this long and thick beard.
🎧 She thought I was somebody else.
🎧 Every time I try to give her a hug,
🎧 she cries and pushes me away.
🎧 Poor you!
🎧 She was so little when you went overseas to work.
🎧 You're right.
🎧 Could you trim my beard, please?
🎧 Sure!

[A bad hair day]

🎧 Hi, Jesse.
🎧 Oh, my God.
🎧 What's wrong with your hair?
🎧 Hi. May.
🎧 I woke up this morning and my hair was a mess.
🎧 I decided to go to the salon to fix it and get a perm.
🎧 Okay, but your hair doesn't seem to be fixed.
🎧 I know... their dresser chopped off and then messed up everything.
🎧 My hair is unevenly cut and I look like a lion!
🎧 And I have a date tonight with Jim.
🎧 I'm sorry about your hair,
🎧 but I think it'll be all right.
🎧 Hope so!
🎧 Hey, Jesse.
🎧 It's pretty windy here.
🎧 Do you want to go inside?
🎧 Uhm… sure!
🎧 Oh, no...
🎧 Oh don't look at me. My hair is crazy!
🎧 I had a bad hair day.
🎧 Oh, so that's why you're wearing a cap?
🎧 Come on Jessie, I don't mind it.
🎧 You still look good.
🎧 Just a bad hair day.
🎧 Not a bad day

[On cloud nine]

🎧 Helen, the landlord's here again for the rent!
🎧 Just paid all my debt and I am totally broke right now!
🎧 Oh, Laura, things will be sorted out.
🎧 I don't even have a job.
🎧 How are these bills going to get paid?
🎧 I thought you had an interview last week.
🎧 I did. But I think I'm gonna fail that interview.
🎧 "They want a perfect fit for that position, requiring a lot of experience while I'm just a newbie."
🎧 Never stop believing, Helen. You're gonna get it, girl!
🎧 Look, you have mail.
🎧 Oh my god! Helen!
🎧 I passed the interview. Can you believe it?
🎧 I feel like I'm on cloud nine.

🎧 You'd better be able yourself today.
🎧 Where are we going, Grandpa?
🎧 Where's your friend?
🎧 We're almost there.
🎧 Look, Mike.
🎧 This is my friend.
🎧 We both served in the military 50 years ago, same unit.
🎧 We were very close then.
🎧 why is he dead?
🎧 Oh I feel like it just happened yesterday.
🎧 It was a merciless fight...
🎧 He took the bullet for me and saved my life.
🎧 Oh, Grandpa, I'm sorry for your loss.

🎧 Hello, sir.
🎧 What can I do for you today?
🎧 Hey, I rented an office at the back of this building.
🎧 Now I want to pay the rent to the account.
🎧 Can I see the name on the account, please?
🎧 Here you are.
🎧 Sir, it seems like you need to pay a security deposit if you want to sign the lease.

🎧 Can anybody tell me what plants need to grow?
🎧 They need water and sunlight.
🎧 That's correct, Mark. What else?
🎧 They need soil.
🎧 Very good, Jenny. Plants also need air to grow.
🎧 I have a plant at home.
🎧 It's growing fast!
🎧 That's great, Mark.
🎧 Taking care of plants is a good way to learn about nature.
🎧 Can we plant something in class?
🎧 Yes, we will plant some seeds today and watch them grow.
🎧 Cool.
🎧 What kind of seeds do we have?
🎧 We have sunflower and tomato seeds.
🎧 You can choose which one to plant.
🎧 I want to plant sunflowers.
🎧 They're so bright and happy.
🎧 I'll plant tomatoes. I love fresh tomatoes.
🎧 Great choices.
🎧 Teacher, how long does it take for them to grow?
🎧 Sunflowers can take a few weeks to sprout.
🎧 Tomatoes might take a bit longer, but we will see progress soon.
🎧 I can't wait to see my tomato plant grow.
🎧 I'll water it every day.
🎧 That's the spirit.
🎧 But make sure not to overwater them.
🎧 Plants need just the right amount of water.
🎧 This is going to be fun.
🎧 I'm glad you're excited.
🎧 Now let's get started.

[At the airport]

🎧 Jimmy, did you see the news?
🎧 Our flight is overbooked.
🎧 What? Are we not going to get on the plane?
🎧 No, they're asking for volunteers to take a later flight.
🎧 They're offering free tickets and hotel stays.
🎧 That sounds tempting. Should we volunteer?
🎧 I think so. We can have an extra day in the city.
🎧 Anyway, it's been a long time since we had a surprise adventure.
🎧 You're right. Let's go talk to the gate agent.
🎧 Hi. How can I help you?
🎧 We heard you need volunteers to take a later flight.
🎧 What's the offer?
🎧 Yes, we are offering free tickets for your next trip,
🎧 a night at a nearby hotel, and meal vouchers.
🎧 That sounds great. We'll take it.
🎧 Thank you! Here are your new tickets and hotel vouchers.
🎧 Your new flight is tomorrow at 10 AM.
🎧 Thank you so much.
🎧 Looks like we have an unexpected adventure.
🎧 Let's make the most of it.
🎧 We can explore the city more.
🎧 Maybe we can visit that museum we didn't have time for?
🎧 And try that famous restaurant. This turned out well!

[At the supermarket]

🎧 Tom, have you seen the new smart shopping carts?
🎧 No, what's so special about them?
🎧 They have screens that guide you through your shopping list and suggest recipes.
🎧 That's cool! Let's try one.
🎧 Alright, let's start with vegetables.
🎧 The cart says there's a discount on tomatoes.
🎧 Perfect timing. We need tomatoes for our salad tonight.
🎧 Now it's guiding us to the food section.
🎧 It's like we have a personal assistant.
🎧 Look, it's suggesting a fruit salad recipe.
🎧 Should we try this recipe?
🎧 Yes, let's get some strawberries and blueberries.
🎧 Next stop, dairy. It says there's a sale on milk.
🎧 This cart is amazing. We're saving so much time.
🎧 And money! Let's get some cheese and eggs too.
🎧 Don't forget to grab some yogurt. It's on sale too.
🎧 No, it's taking us to the pasta aisle.
🎧 How about we try that new brand of spaghetti?
🎧 Good idea. I've heard it's really good.
🎧 Let's get some sauce too
🎧 The cart suggests a marinara sauce. It's perfect for our dinner.
🎧 I love that it suggests side dishes, too.
🎧 Let's get some garlic bread.
🎧 This is the easiest shopping trip ever.
🎧 Let's head to the checkout.
🎧 I agree we should use this cart every time.

[At the library]

🎧 Jake, have you found any good books for our project?
🎧 I found a few on recycling and waste management.
🎧 They look really useful.
🎧 Great.
🎧 We should find some that explain how recycling helps the environment.
🎧 Good idea.
🎧 Let's check the science section.
🎧 Look, there's a whole shelf on recycling.
🎧 Wow, these books look detailed.
🎧 This one has a lot of pictures and diagrams.
🎧 Perfect! Visuals will make our presentation more interesting.
🎧 Should we get a book on how to start a recycling program at school?
🎧 Yes, that would add practical ideas to our project.
🎧 Do you think we need anything else?
🎧 Maybe a book on creative ways to reuse materials.
🎧 That would be fun to include.
🎧 Good thinking.
🎧 Let's grab this one to.
🎧 Find everything you need.
🎧 Yes, we're working on a science fair project about recycling.
🎧 That sounds interesting.
🎧 Good luck with your project.
🎧 Thank you.
🎧 Let's head back and start reading.
🎧 We have a lot to cover.
🎧 I'm looking forward to it.
🎧 This is going to be a great project.
🎧 Look at this part.
🎧 It says recycling helps to reduce pollution.
🎧 This is perfect for our project.
🎧 And this book shows how to start a recycling program at school.
🎧 That's important for the environment.
🎧 We could suggest having different bins for paper, plastic and glass.
🎧 That would make it easier for everyone to recycle.
🎧 Awesome.
🎧 And these ideas for reusing things are cool.
🎧 Our project will be really special.
🎧 Yes.
🎧 The more I read, the more excited I get.

[At the post office]

🎧 Ben, did you remember to bring the packages we need to mail?
🎧 Yes, they're right here.
🎧 Do you have the address labels?
🎧 Yep.
🎧 Let's get these sent off first.
🎧 Hi there! How can I help you today?
🎧 Hi, we need to send these packages.
🎧 Sure, place them on the scale, please.
🎧 Can you tell us how much postage we need for these?
🎧 Let me weigh them...
🎧 Okay, for these three, it will be $15.75.
🎧 Great, here's the money.
🎧 Thank you! Here are your tracking numbers.
🎧 Thanks! Also, can we check our post office box?
🎧 Of course. What's the number?
🎧 It's box 123.
🎧 Here you go. Looks like you have some letters.
🎧 I wonder who these letters are from.
🎧 It looks like one is from grandma and one is from the utility company.
🎧 Grandma's letters are always the best.
🎧 I can't wait to read her letter.
🎧 Me too. Let's head home and open these.
🎧 Don't forget, we also need to stop by the grocery store.
🎧 Right. Let's go! We've got a productive day ahead.
🎧 Yes, and we're off to a good start.

[At the railway station]

🎧 Ken, do you see the train schedule?
🎧 Emma's train should be arriving any minute now.
🎧 Yes, it says her train is on time.
🎧 It should be here in five minutes.
🎧 Great! I can't wait to see her. It's been so long.
🎧 Which platform is her train arriving at?
🎧 Platform 3. Let's head over there.
🎧 Look, there's her train! I hope she had a good journey.
🎧 There she is! I see her getting off the train.
🎧 Lisa! Ken! Over here!
🎧 Emma! It's so good to see you!
🎧 Welcome, Emma! How was your trip?
🎧 It was good, but I'm glad to be here.
🎧 The train was a bit crowded.
🎧 Oh, no. That seems uncomfortable.
🎧 Do you have a lot of luggage?
🎧 Just these two bags.
🎧 Thanks for coming to pick me up.
🎧 No problem at all.
🎧 Let me help you with your bags.
🎧 Thanks, Ken.
🎧 So what's the plan for today?
🎧 First, we'll drop your stuff off at our place.
🎧 and then we thought we'd take you out for lunch.
🎧 That sounds perfect. I'm starving!
🎧 Great! There's a nice café near our apartment. You'll love it.
🎧 And after lunch, we can show you around the city.
🎧 I can't wait.
🎧 It's my first time here, so I'm looking forward to exploring.
🎧 We're glad you're here.
🎧 It's going to be a fun visit.
🎧 Absolutely. Let's head out and start your adventure!

[At the police station]

🎧 I can't believe someone stole my bike, Mark.
🎧 I loved that bike.
🎧 I know, Jane.
🎧 Let's report it and see what the police can do to help.
🎧 Good afternoon. How can I help you today?
🎧 Hi, I need to report a stolen bike.
🎧 It was taken from my back yard last night.
🎧 I'm sorry to hear that.
🎧 Can you tell me what the bike looks like?
🎧 Yes, it's a blue mountain bike with a black seat and silver handlebars.
🎧 It also has a small bell on the left handlebar.
🎧 Okay, I have that.
🎧 Does it have any special numbers or marks?
🎧 Yes, there's a serial number on the frame near the pedals.
🎧 It's 12345AB.
🎧 And it has a scratch on the left side of the frame from a fall a few weeks ago.
🎧 That's very helpful.
🎧 Did you see anything strange or anyone near your house recently?
🎧 No, everything seemed normal.
🎧 We didn't hear anything either.
🎧 Okay. I'll write the report and tell our officers to look for your bike.
🎧 In the meantime, you might want to check local pawn shops and online marketplaces.
🎧 Thank you for your advice and your help.
🎧 We'll do our best to find your bike.
🎧 If we find any clues, we'll contact you right away.
🎧 And maybe we can put up some posters around the neighborhood too.
🎧 Good idea. We'll find it, Jane.
🎧 Great, you should do that.

[At the bar]

🎧 Congratulations on the new job, Alex!
🎧 This calls for a celebration.
🎧 Thanks, Sam! I'm really excited about it.
🎧 Hi there! What can I get for you?
🎧 Two beers, please. We're celebrating!
🎧 Coming right up.
🎧 What's the occasion?
🎧 I just got a new job at a tech company.
🎧 That's awesome! Congratulations!
🎧 Thanks!
🎧 Here's to new beginnings, Alex.
🎧 Cheers! This is such a big step for me.
🎧 You've worked hard for this. You deserve it.
🎧 Thanks, Sam.
🎧 Your support means a lot.
🎧 So, what will you be doing at the new job?
🎧 I'll be working as a software developer.
🎧 It's a great chance to learn and grow.
🎧 That sounds amazing.
🎧 I know you'll do great.
🎧 I'm really looking forward to it.
🎧 The team seems really nice too.
🎧 It's going to be a fantastic experience.
🎧 Let's toast to your success.
🎧 Cheers to that.
🎧 And thanks for being here to celebrate with me.
🎧 Always, Alex.
🎧 Here's to many more successes.

[014] English Speaking Course 014

[What do you want?]

🎧 Hey, Jim. Are you free now?
🎧 I think so. I don't have any homework to do now, so yeah!
🎧 Could you do me a favor?
🎧 Sure thing. What do you want?
🎧 I have homework for my business class.
🎧 That is to conduct an interview about fast food.

🎧 No, go ahead.
🎧 Okay, so what is your favorite fast-food restaurant?
🎧 Mcdonald, I guess.
🎧 Why do you like it?
🎧 Well, because of the varied menu and the comfortable and passionate decor.

🎧 Alright! Now let me check it once again.
🎧 And then we can send it to grandma, right?
🎧 Yeah!

[Stop kidding.]

🎧 Are you going to join the party tonight, Adam?
🎧 Which party?
🎧 Alex's birthday party. You didn't know about it?
🎧 No, I didn't.
🎧 But I don't think I can go...
🎧 You'd better go, man! It's gonna be super fun!
🎧 And maybe you can find a girlfriend there.
🎧 Stop kidding, man.
🎧 Seriously, bro! There will be a lot of pretty girls at the party!
🎧 Nah. Nobody's gonna pay attention to me.
🎧 Why don't you give it a try?
🎧 No, thanks. I already have a plan.
🎧 Oh! Come on!

[Are you sure?]

🎧 I think we're getting lost.
🎧 I agree! I don't know where are we right now.
🎧 Don't worry, just follow the map, okay?
🎧 Are you sure? What if we get stuck in this forest forever?
🎧 No way! Trust me, okay?
🎧 What if we meet any wild animals?
🎧 Like lions?!
🎧 Oh no! They're gonna eat us!
🎧 Stop it! Just follow me and don't say anything else!
🎧 Hey, look! I can see the village!
🎧 See, I told ya. All we have to do is to believe in the map!
🎧 Okay, we trust you now.

[No, I don't want to]

🎧 Jenny? Do you have a moment?
🎧 What's the matter, Luke?
🎧 Last night, I checked your file. And I saw that you haven't finished the report.
🎧 Oh, yeah...I'm sorry for that.
🎧 I couldn't meet the deadline.
🎧 Don't worry, we still have today to finish it.
🎧 You'd better work on it now before we submit it to our boss.
🎧 Should we just give up?
🎧 Listen, Jenny. Do you want to work overtime?
🎧 No, I don't want to.
🎧 And do you want to be scolded by our boss?
🎧 Definitely no!
🎧 That's why we cannot give up, Jen.
🎧 Let's work hard and go home early today.
🎧 Got it!

[That's strange.]

🎧 Are you in your room, Sarah?
🎧 Yes, mom.
🎧 Can you check for me whether there is any necklace there?
🎧 I think I dropped it in your room.
🎧 I'm looking for it now, Mom.
🎧 Sorry, but I couldn't find anything!
🎧 That's strange! I remember that I put it on your table.
🎧 I just checked my table and there's no necklace mom
🎧 That's so weird...
🎧 How about the bathroom?
🎧 Maybe you took it off when you were changing clothes.
🎧 Oh, yeah! It makes sense!
🎧 Let me check it!
🎧 Ah! Found it!
🎧 Thank God.

[Can you show me your answer sheet?]

🎧 I've just distributed to everybody a question sheet and an answer sheet.
🎧 Please fill in your answer in 15 minutes.
🎧 Don't forget to read the question as well.
🎧 Hey, Mike.
🎧 What?
🎧 Could you show me your answer sheet?
🎧 There are some parts that I'm not sure about...
🎧 I'm sorry, but I can't.
🎧 If Mr. Henry knew this, he would give us an F!
🎧 Dustin! Mike! Are there any problems?
🎧 No, Mr. Henry.
🎧 Please keep quiet and do your work.
🎧 Okay!

[I'm sorry to interrupt you.]

🎧 ...So, I just finished discussing the main goals of this project.
🎧 Excuse me?
🎧 Yes, please.
🎧 I'm sorry to interrupt you,
🎧 but I have a question about the deadline for this project.
🎧 Oh, don't worry. I haven't mentioned the deadline yet!
🎧 After talking about the marketing strategies, I'm gonna move to that part.
🎧 Thank you.
🎧 You're welcome.
🎧 Before I move to the next slide, does anyone have any other questions?
🎧 I'm sorry, could you explain the goals again for me?
🎧 I didn't really focus...
🎧 No problem. I will talk about the goals once again for everyone.

🎧 Nice to meet you, sir.
🎧 It's a pleasure to meet you.
🎧 Can I call you by your first name?
🎧 Yes. Please feel free to do so.

🎧 Oh, come on. Just sometimes, okay?
🎧 Hahaha. You don't have to be shy...
🎧 James always mentions how wonderful you are.
🎧 Stop it! Stop it!
🎧 Wow, that surprised me!

[Will you go there or shall I?]

🎧 Alright. We can end our lessons today.
🎧 Don't forget to clean the classroom before you leave!
🎧 It's our duty today, right, Nancy?
🎧 Yeah.
🎧 We have to borrow the vacuum first.
🎧 Where can we find it?
🎧 At the security office on the 1st floor, I guess.
🎧 Do you want to go there or should I?
🎧 Let me do it. While I'm gone, you can arrange the desks.
🎧 Okay, got it!
🎧 I've got the vacuum now.
🎧 I've also finished arranging the desks.
🎧 Maybe I can do the vacuum and you can clean the desks.
🎧 Sure thing.
🎧 Let's do it!

[What do you think?]

🎧 What's the date of today?
🎧 It's the 6th of July.
🎧 Oh...Wait! Isn't this Sunday Sandra's birthday?
🎧 Sunday is the 10th of July...Ah, yes!
🎧 We can go to the shopping center and buy a gift for her.
🎧 What do you think?
🎧 I'll go with it!
🎧 Do you know what she likes?
🎧 I guess she likes listening to US-UK music.
🎧 Then we can go to the CD shop to buy her a vinyl record!
🎧 Fantastic!
🎧 I believe she's gonna love it!
🎧 Let's go!

[What are your hobbies?]

🎧 Are you reading books, Tracy?
🎧 That's right. I'm reading a manga.
🎧 What is manga?
🎧 Oh, it's like comics. But it comes from Japan.
🎧 Ah, I see. Is it your hobby to read manga?
🎧 You can say so! And I also read sci-fi novels!
🎧 Hey, cool! I love sci-fi, but I tend to watch sci-fi movies!
🎧 What are your hobbies? I mean, other hobbies than movies.
🎧 Hmmm, let me think...
🎧 I enjoy listening to music in my free time.
🎧 Besides, I also love partying!
🎧 Partying? I love parties, too!
🎧 Talking about partying, I heard that there will be a farewell party before we graduate!
🎧 Yeah, I also heard about it!
🎧 We should definitely go!

[What did you say?]

🎧 Today is gonna be a great day!
🎧 Yeah! We finally have time to hang out together!
🎧 What do you want to do today?
🎧 I heard that there's a new cafe opening in town.
🎧 Want to check it out?
🎧 Sorry, what did you say?
🎧 I said there's a new coffee shop in town.
🎧 Oh, really?
🎧 Yeah! We can go there first if you want.
🎧 OK! Let's go!
🎧 I wanna take a lot of photos with you!
🎧 It's a great idea because this coffee has a city view!
🎧 City view?
🎧 That's the best!
🎧 I bet we're gonna have a lot of nice photo.

[What do you need?]

🎧 I'm going camping with my class
🎧 this Saturday, Mom.
🎧 Wonderful!
🎧 But I don't know how to prepare for the trip.
🎧 Alright... So what do you need?
🎧 My teacher only said that please prepare well. That's all!
🎧 Hahaha. Don't worry. You have me. I'll help you to prepare
🎧 Do I need to bring a lot of food, Mom?
🎧 It's a good idea, but you will need other things as well.
🎧 How about sleeping bags and pillows?
🎧 Oh, yeah! I will definitely need those things!
🎧 Please write it down so that you won't forget.
🎧 I think I'm gonna bring some water bottles as well.
🎧 You're going to need a flashlight as well.
🎧 Oh, yes! You are right.
🎧 Let me write it down.

[What do you want to do?]

🎧 Summer is coming.
🎧 What do you want to do?
🎧 Me? I think I will go swimming!
🎧 Are you going to the swimming pool?
🎧 No! I will go to the beach!
🎧 Wow! But there aren't any beaches here!
🎧 I intend to travel to Hawaii with my family.
🎧 Hawaii is paradise on Earth, right?
🎧 Exactly!
🎧 You can relax and enjoy the Hawaiian culture.
🎧 One day, I will definitely make enough money to go to Hawaii!

[What do you want?]

🎧 Today is your birthday, Lucas!
🎧 What do you want?

🎧 How rich you are! Hahaha!
🎧 Honestly, I just want to hang out with you today.
🎧 You don't have to buy me anything.
🎧 Are you sure?
🎧 You're gonna regret it if you don't receive my gifts.
🎧 Okay...okay...
🎧 I think I want a pair of shoes.
🎧 Alright, let's go to the shoe shop now.
🎧 What color do you like?
🎧 I love red.
🎧 How about this pair?
🎧 It's too big, I guess.
🎧 Will this one be better?
🎧 Wow! It looks so cool!
🎧 I'm going to choose it!
🎧 Sure! Let me pay it for you!
🎧 You're so generous!

[What's your email address?]

🎧 Oh..I was so sleepy this morning that I missed Economics class...
🎧 Wait...you didn't come to class?

🎧 Let me send it to you.
🎧 What's your email address?
🎧 It's linda@gmail.com

🎧 I've got a job and I will start working next week.
🎧 Wow! Congratulations! What is your job?
🎧 I'm a sales assistant in a small company.
🎧 Oh, really? I thought that you would become a teacher!
🎧 Well, I love talking and sharing experiences with people,
🎧 and becoming a teacher is one of them.
🎧 But after all, I feel like I'm not suitable for that job.
🎧 So how did you get your current job?
🎧 Well, I just found the company's job description on the Internet.
🎧 Then I thought, "Wow! Interesting!"
🎧 So I applied for the job, had an interview and got accepted!
🎧 This is your destiny!
🎧 I believe so!

[What's your phone number?]

🎧 Hello. I'm Joan.
🎧 I'm looking forward to being your deskmate through this semester.

[She is not my best friend]

🎧 Hey Jennifer. Are you going to Sally's birthday party tonight?
🎧 Is that tonight?
🎧 Yeah. Can you go?
🎧 I was thinking about it. Are you?
🎧 Yeah, I heard it's gonna be a lot of fun.
🎧 Oh.
🎧 Well... I think you should go. It's your best friend's birthday, after all.
🎧 No, she isn't my best friend.
🎧 What happened?
🎧 She slandered me.
🎧 Although she apologized, we can't be good friends anymore.
🎧 That's really bad.

[Even Steven]

🎧 Thank you so much.
🎧 If you hadn't helped me last week, I wouldn't have finished the job on time.
🎧 Oh. It's nothing.
🎧 We are friends and colleagues, aren't we?
🎧 And you often helped me.
🎧 It was such a difficult project.
🎧 Without your help, I wouldn't be able to do it alone.
🎧 So I have to say thank you, anyway.
🎧 I'm glad to have helped.
🎧 If there's anything else I can do, please let me know.
🎧 I will. And may I offer you a meal as a thank you?
🎧 Oh, just buy me a drink and we're even-steven.
🎧 Okay, so tomorrow morning I'll buy you a glass of starbuck.
🎧 Great! Well.. I have to go. See ya!
🎧 See ya!

[You have a lot of explaining to do]

🎧 Where have you been?
🎧 Do you know what time it is?
🎧 I'm sorry, Dad. I lost track of time.
🎧 Alright, I have something to tell you and you have a lot of explaining to do.
🎧 First, tell me why you're late.
🎧 I forgot my phone and had to go back to class to get it.
🎧 That still doesn't explain why you're late, but okay.
🎧 Now I want you to explain this.
🎧 What's the matter, Dad?
🎧 Why did you get an F in Literature?
🎧 I didn't study enough.
🎧 I'm disappointed in you.
🎧 You won't be allowed to go out until you pass the test.

[Feel free to call me any time]

🎧 We haven't been apart for so long.
🎧 I'll miss you.
🎧 Yeah, I'll miss you too. It's just a year.
🎧 I promise we'll stay in touch.
🎧 We can have video calls every week.
🎧 Yeah. Feel free to call me any time.
🎧 Sure. Maybe you could come visit me while I'm there.
🎧 I wish I could, but you know I need to finish my studies.
🎧 Yeah, right.
🎧 So we'll be in touch for sure.
🎧 Definitely!
🎧 Well, I have to go now. I need to pack my bags and get ready.
🎧 Thanks for having me and showing me around.
🎧 It was nothing, really.
🎧 Don't forget to let me know when you get there okay?
🎧 Will do. I'll text.
🎧 Now get going before you miss your flight.
🎧 Take care and see you again soon.
🎧 Bye!
🎧 Bye, Rachel.

[I love my job]

🎧 Hey, how are you?
