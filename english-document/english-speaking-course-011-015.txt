[Waking up]

🎧 Good morning, Dina. Time to wake up.
🎧 Just five more minutes, Alex.
🎧 Dina!
🎧 Alex, are you awake?
🎧 Did you hear that? Come on!
🎧 If you stay in bed any longer, you'll be late for school.
🎧 Alright.
🎧 Look, Dina, it's morning already.
🎧 The weather is beautiful today.
🎧 Oh, it really is.
🎧 I hope today will be wonderful.
🎧 Get up.
🎧 I'll wait for you so we can brush our teeth together.
🎧 I'll be right there.
 
[Brushing teeth]
 
🎧 Dina, you need to brush for at least two minutes.
🎧 It helps keep your teeth healthy and strong.
🎧 Oh, I know, I know.
🎧 You're always reminding me.
🎧 Do you think I don't brush long enough?
🎧 I'm just making sure you have a bright smile.
🎧 You want to impress your friends, right?
🎧 But you would say I'm late if I'm slow.
🎧 I just want to do it as fast as you say.
🎧 Just 1-2 minutes won't make you late for class.
🎧 I only say that because if you sleep for another 5 minutes,
🎧 it can become 15 minutes or half an hour.
🎧 You will have a hard time controlling yourself because sleep is so attractive.
🎧 You are really serious about everything, brother.
🎧 Anyway, thank you. Sometimes you're like another parent.
🎧 And you are always teasing me.
 
[Morning exercise]
 
🎧 Come on, Dad. Let's do ten more push-ups! You've got this.
🎧 You're really pushing me today, Alex.
🎧 I'm not as young as you are.
🎧 Just trying to keep us fit.
🎧 A healthy body means a healthy mind.
🎧 And you two look funny.
🎧 Want to join us, Dina?
🎧 It's good for you.
🎧 No way! I'll stick to watching.
🎧 Exercise isn't my thing.
🎧 I am preparing breakfast, athletes.
🎧 You guys should get ready.
🎧 Thanks, Mom. We'll be right there.
🎧 Great workout, son.
🎧 Now let's refuel with some delicious breakfast.
 
[Making breakfast]
 
🎧 Thanks for helping, Alex.
🎧 Can you pass me the eggs?
🎧 Sure, Mom. Here you go.
🎧 Do you need me to cut the vegetables too?
🎧 That would be wonderful. Thank you.
🎧 It's always nice to have an extra pair of hands.
🎧 It smells so good, Mom.
🎧 What are you making today?
🎧 I'm starving.
🎧 What's for breakfast?
🎧 Scrambled eggs, toast and orange juice.
🎧 Plus, Alex is cutting some vegetables for an omelet.
🎧 And some fruit, too. We have bananas and apples.
 
[Getting dressed]
 
🎧 Dina, do you need any help picking out your clothes?
🎧 No, Mom. I think I got it.
🎧 But can you help me find my blue sweater?
🎧 Okay.
🎧 Don't forget to pack your bags, sweetie.
🎧 Sure Mom.
🎧 Dina, your blue sweater is in the laundry room.
🎧 Thanks Mom.
🎧 And wear something warm.
🎧 It's chilly outside.
🎧 Don't forget your jackets.
🎧 Got it, Dad.
🎧 Ready, Alex?
🎧 Almost, Just need my shoes.
🎧 Do you think this outfit looks okay?
🎧 You look great. Now hurry up so we can get going.
 
[Commuting to work]
 
🎧 Have a great day at work, Alex.
🎧 Thanks, Mom.
🎧 And you too, my dear girl.
🎧 I love you so much.
🎧 And love you too, Buddy!
🎧 See you this afternoon, babe.
🎧 Dad, I'll walk home with Jimmy today.
🎧 You don't have to pick me up.
🎧 Really? Okay.
🎧 Jimmy just moved here, but you two are so close.
🎧 I'm so very happy about that.
🎧 Yes, Jimmy is in the same class as me, so we often do homework together.
🎧 He helps me a lot.
🎧 It's great to have such a good friend.
🎧 We're here, Dina. Have a nice day.
🎧 Thanks, Dad, have a good day at work.
 
[Morning coffee]
 
🎧 Good morning, Aunt Emma.
🎧 Good morning, Neo. Did you sleep well?
🎧 Yeah. What's for breakfast?
🎧 There's a cereal on the kitchen table.
🎧 I'm having coffee.
🎧 Do you want some toast with your cereal?
🎧 Can I have some juice, too?
🎧 Of course. Pour yourself a glass.
🎧 Do you need help with anything else?
🎧 No. I'm good.
🎧 What time are you leaving for work?
🎧 In about an hour.
🎧 Do you want me to drop you off at school?
🎧 Yes, please.
🎧 It's much faster when you drive me.
🎧 Alright.
🎧 Finish your breakfast and get your school bag ready.
🎧 Okay, Aunt Emma, I'll go get my bag first.
 
[Checking emails]
 
🎧 Let's see what we have today.
🎧 A few client emails and some internal messages.
🎧 Good morning, Ms.
🎧 You go to work early today.
🎧 Good morning, Alex. I just want to check some mail.
🎧 Ready for another busy day?
🎧 I'm always ready.
🎧 Is there anything urgent in the emails?
🎧 Just the usual. I'll forward you the important ones.
🎧 There's a meeting at 10, so make sure you're prepared.
🎧 Thanks. I'll get started right away.
🎧 Do you need any help with the presentation?
🎧 That would be great. Let's go over it together in a bit.
🎧 Sure thing.
 
[Team meeting]
 
🎧 Alright, everyone. Let's get started. We have a lot to cover today.
🎧 First up is the new marketing campaign.
🎧 We have a few important projects to cover.
🎧 I want to hear everyone's ideas and updates.
🎧 What's the priority for today?
🎧 Are we focusing on the new clients?
🎧 Yes, let's focus on the new marketing campaign first.
🎧 We need to finalize a strategy by the end of the week.
🎧 Sounds good. I have some ideas to share.
🎧 We can use social media more actively.
🎧 Great. Let's hear them.
🎧 We need to think outside the box.
🎧 And don't forget to consider our budget.
🎧 We need to be efficient with our resources.
🎧 We also need to tell our current clients.
🎧 Should we do that today?
🎧 Yes, but let's focus on the marketing campaign first.
🎧 After that's done, we can update our clients.
🎧 I'll begin writing the strategy document.
🎧 Everyone, please send them your ideas by the end of the day.
 
[Lunch break]
 
🎧 This sandwich is really good, Dina.
🎧 Thanks, Jimmy. My mom made it fresh this morning.
🎧 Your mom is a great cook.
🎧 I wish my mom could make sandwiches like this.
🎧 She is so busy with work that she rarely cooks lunch.
🎧 Yeah, she's the best.
🎧 Next time, I'll ask mom to bring you lunch too.
🎧 You should be understanding to your mom.
🎧 I got it.
🎧 Do you want to play video games after school?
🎧 Sure. That sounds fun.
🎧 What game do you want to play?
🎧 How about the new racing game?
🎧 It's really cool.
🎧 Great choice.
🎧 I'm so excited now.
 
[Afternoon tasks]
 
🎧 Do you need any help with the report, Ms.?
🎧 The data seems a bit complicated.
🎧 Yes, please.
🎧 Can you check the data for me and make sure everything is correct?
🎧 Of course.
🎧 I'll get right on it.
🎧 We need this report ready by tomorrow, right?
🎧 Yes, it's for the client meeting.
🎧 They want to see our progress.
🎧 No problem. That's what I'm here for.
🎧 Let's make sure everything is perfect.
🎧 Thanks, Alex. You're a big help.
🎧 How are your other tests going?
🎧 I'm almost done with the marketing strategy document.
🎧 I'll send it to you for review.
🎧 Excellent.
🎧 let's finish this up quickly so we can prepare for the client meeting.
🎧 Okay, I will finish the report right away.
 
[Taking a walk]
 
🎧 Dina, do you want to go to the playground?
🎧 I want to play on the swings.
🎧 Sure, Jimmy. Let's go.
🎧 I also want to rest a little before going on.
🎧 Come on, Dina! You're too slow.
🎧 I'm coming, Jimmy.
🎧 Don't go too far ahead.
🎧 I love our walks.
🎧 It's fun to spend time with you.
🎧 Me too, Dina. It's nice to relax and enjoy the outdoors.
🎧 Look, there's an ice cream truck.
🎧 Can we get some ice cream?
🎧 Why not? Let's have a treat.
🎧 What flavor do you want?
🎧 Chocolate, please! What about you, Jimmy?
🎧 I'll have vanilla.
🎧 Let's enjoy ice creams and then head on.
 
[Snack time]
 
🎧 Dad, can I have some cookies? I'm really hungry.
🎧 Sure. Just don't eat too many. You'll ruin your dinner.
🎧 Thanks, Dad.
🎧 Can Jimmy come over later?
🎧 We promised to play games after school.
🎧 Of course. You two have fun.
🎧 But remember to finish your homework first.
🎧 We will, Dad.
🎧 Jimmy is really good at math.
🎧 He helps me a lot.
🎧 That's great.
🎧 It's important to help each other out.
🎧 Do you need any help with your project?
🎧 No, we've got it under control. Thanks, Dad.
🎧 Alright. Let me know if you need anything.
🎧 I'll be in the living room.
🎧 Thanks, Dad. You're the best.
 
[Finishing work]
 
🎧 Great work today, Alex. We got a lot done.
🎧 Thanks, Emma. It was a productive day.
🎧 The report is ready and the strategy document is complete.
🎧 Let's review the report one more time before sending it to the client.
🎧 We want everything to be perfect.
🎧 I'll make the last changes and send it to you.
🎧 Do you need anything else?
🎧 No, that's all for today.
🎧 Let's head home and rest.
🎧 You deserve a break.
🎧 That sounds good.
🎧 See you tomorrow, Emma.
🎧 Have a good evening.
🎧 See you tomorrow, Alex.
🎧 Drive safely and enjoy your evening.
 
[Driving home]
 
🎧 What a busy day.
🎧 I can't wait to get home and relax.
🎧 Hi, Dina. Hi, Jimmy.
🎧 Hi, Alex! Welcome home.
🎧 How was work?
🎧 It was busy, but good.
🎧 How was your day?
🎧 It was great. We played a lot after school.
🎧 Yeah, and we finish your homework early.
🎧 So now we're just having fun.
🎧 That's awesome.
🎧 I'm glad you both had a good day.
🎧 Hi Buddy!
🎧 Let's go inside and see what Mom and Dad are doing.
 
[Grocery shopping]
 
🎧 Neo, can you grab some tomatoes and onions?
🎧 We need them for the pasta tonight.
🎧 Sure, Aunt Emma.
🎧 Do we have enough cheese at home?
🎧 Yes, we still have some from last week.
🎧 But we need more olive oil.
🎧 Can you get that too?
🎧 I got it.
🎧 What else do we need?
🎧 Let's check our list.
🎧 We need fresh bread, milk and some fruit for tomorrow's lunch.
🎧 Oh, and cereal for breakfast.
🎧 I'll get the bread and milk.
🎧 Do you want to pick the fruits?
🎧 Sure, I'll get some apples and bananas.
🎧 And I also want to get some extra snacks for the week.
🎧 Could I?
🎧 Of course. Good boy.
🎧 It's a reward for going shopping with me to prepare meals.
🎧 I love you the most, Aunt Emma!
🎧 Let's head to the checkout.
 
[Preparing dinner]
 
🎧 Dina, can you help me chop the vegetables?
🎧 Sure, Mom. I'll wash them first.
🎧 Alex, can you set the table?
🎧 Of course, Dad. How many plates do we need?
🎧 Seven. Jimmy's family is joining us for dinner.
🎧 Great, I'll get everything ready.
🎧 I'll start cooking the pasta.
🎧 It should be ready in about 20 minutes.
🎧 Dina, can you pass me the onions?
🎧 Here you go, Mom. I'll start with the tomatoes.
🎧 Thanks, sweetie.
🎧 Alex, do we have enough drinks for everyone?
🎧 Yes, I put some soda and juice in the fridge earlier.
 
[Family time]
 
🎧 Thanks for having us over, Lisa. The dinner was delicious.
🎧 You're welcome, Danny.
🎧 It's always nice to have your family here.
🎧 Jimmy, do you want to play a board game?
🎧 Sure, Dina. Let's play the one with the pirates.
🎧 These two kids are together all day.
🎧 I'm glad Dina has Jimmy.
🎧 You know, we're pretty busy and can't spend much time with him.
🎧 How about we all play together? It will be more fun.
🎧 Good idea. Let's set up the game.
🎧 Who wants to be the captain?
🎧 I do! I love being the captain.
🎧 I'll be the treasure hunter.
🎧 What about you, Alex?
🎧 I'll be the navigator.
🎧 Let's start the adventure!
🎧 I'll be the map reader.
🎧 Let's find that treasure!
🎧 This is going to be fun.
🎧 Let's see who wins.
 
[Watching TV]
 
🎧 Aunt Emma, can we watch the new superhero movie?
🎧 Sure, Neo. But only for an hour, okay?
🎧 You have school tomorrow.
🎧 Okay. I promise.
🎧 Can we have some popcorn too?
🎧 Of course, I'll make some. You get the movie ready.
🎧 I found the movie, Aunt Emma! It's starting soon.
🎧 Great! The popcorn will be ready in a minute.
🎧 Here you go, Neo. Enjoy the movie.
🎧 Thanks, Aunt Emma. This is the best part of the day.
🎧 I'm glad you're enjoying it. Remember, just one hour.
🎧 I remember. I'll go to bed right after.
 
[Laundry room]
 
🎧 More laundry?
🎧 It never seems to end, does it?
🎧 Between work, Jimmy's school uniforms,
🎧 It feels like I'm doing this every day.
🎧 Well, let's solve this together.
🎧 I'll fold the towels while you sort the clothes.
🎧 Deal.
🎧 By the way, did you notice that Jimmy's shirts are getting more wrinkled these days?
🎧 I think he's been skipping the ironing.
🎧 Ah, I'll have a talk with him.
🎧 Maybe we can teach him a thing or two about ironing this weekend.
🎧 Are you free?
🎧 Yes, I am.
🎧 And that's a good idea.
🎧 He's doing great at work, but some life skills wouldn't hurt.
🎧 You know, we make a pretty good team.
🎧 We do.
🎧 And it's nice to have some time together, even if it's just folding laundry.
🎧 Agreed. I'll handle the ironing this weekend.
🎧 We can make it a family lesson.
🎧 Sounds like a plan.
🎧 Maybe we can even ask Jimmy to help out.
 
[Cleaning the house]
 
🎧 Alex, can you help me move this rug?
🎧 I think Buddy's hair is all over it.
🎧 Sure, Dina. Let's roll it up and take it outside to shake it out.
🎧 Do you ever feel like we're just moving dirt around?
🎧 No matter how much we clean, it just keeps coming back.
🎧 That's just life, Dina. But it's worth it to have a clean house.
🎧 Plus, it's kind of nice to see everything neat and tidy.
🎧 I guess so. And it feels good to help out, too.
🎧 Exactly.
🎧 And once we're done, we can relax and enjoy the weekend.
🎧 How about we finish quickly and then take Buddy for a walk later?
🎧 That sounds awesome!
🎧 I'll vacuum the living room while you dust the shelves.
🎧 This place is really starting to shine.
🎧 We should do this more often.
🎧 It does feel good, doesn't it?
🎧 And it's nice that everyone is pitching in.
🎧 Yeah, it's a team effort.
🎧 Maybe we should make this a weekly thing.
🎧 I like that idea.
🎧 We'll keep the house clean, and it gives us some family time together.
🎧 It's good practice for the kids.
🎧 They're going to need these skills when they're out on their own.
🎧 Absolutely.
🎧 Let's finish up and see what the kids are up to.
 
[Walking the dog]
 
🎧 Buddy looks so happy to be outside.
🎧 I think this is his favorite part of the day.
🎧 It's probably mine, too.
🎧 It's nice to get some fresh air after being inside all day.
🎧 Plus, Buddy gets to meet all his dog friends.
🎧 Look, there's Max!
🎧 Mrs. Thompson! How's Max doing?
🎧 He's doing great! Buddy looks like he's having a blast.
🎧 He always does.
🎧 They should have a playdate sometime.
🎧 That's a great idea! We can set something up this weekend.
 
[Talking on the phone]
 
🎧 Yes, Mr. Johnson,
🎧 I have reviewed the proposal and I think we are ready to proceed.
🎧 I will send you the completed documents tomorrow morning.
🎧 That sounds perfect, Emma.
🎧 Your team has done an excellent job, as always.
🎧 Thank you.
🎧 I'll be in touch if there's anything else we need to discuss.
🎧 Have a great evening.
🎧 You too, Emma. Goodbye.
🎧 Another project wrapped up. Now I can finally relax.
🎧 I should probably check on Neo. He's been so quiet tonight.
 
[Evening exercise]
 
🎧 It's been a long day, but it's important to keep up with our exercise routine.
🎧 It is quite difficult to maintain in the beginning.
🎧 You're doing great, babe.
🎧 Just take it one step at a time.
🎧 Thanks, John.
🎧 I'm trying to stay consistent, but it's kind of hard after a long day.
🎧 I get it. But even a little bit each day makes a difference.
🎧 And it helps clear your mind.
🎧 Yeah, I feel that. It's like a reset button for the day.
🎧 Remember to breathe.
🎧 And don't forget to stretch after. It'll help you a lot.
🎧 I will.
🎧 I'll admit, I've been skipping the stretching part lately.
🎧 That's the key to staying flexible and avoiding injuries.
🎧 Let's finish with some stretches together.
🎧 Definitely going to need it.
 
[Taking a shower]
 
🎧 This feels amazing.
🎧 It's the perfect way to end the day.
🎧 Diana, sweetheart. Don't forget to wash your hair.
🎧 And don't take too long.
🎧 Your brother needs to shower, too.
🎧 Okay, mom.
🎧 I'm almost done.
🎧 I should wear a face mask tonight.
🎧 My skin feels a bit dry.
🎧 The bathroom's all yours, Alex.
🎧 Thanks, Diana. I'll be quick.
🎧 No rush.
🎧 I'm just going to relax in my room.
 
[Planning tomorrow]
 
🎧 Let's see.
🎧 I've got that meeting at 10 a.m,
🎧 followed by lunch with Mr. Collins.
🎧 I'll need to prepare those documents tonight.
🎧 I should also review the team's ideas on the project.
🎧 I want to make sure everything's on track.
🎧 Here's your lotus tea. Drink it before bed to help you sleep.
🎧 Thanks, Mom.
🎧 What are you doing?
🎧 I just want to review some work for tomorrow.
🎧 Don't overdo it.
🎧 Your health is the most important thing.
🎧 Thanks, mom.
🎧 I'll be done in a bit.
🎧 Good night, Mom.
🎧 I'll probably chat with Dina for a bit before I go to bed.
🎧 Good night.
🎧 It's going to be a hectic day, but I'm ready.
🎧 Just need to get a good night's sleep.
 
[Brushing hair]
 
🎧 Your hair looks lovely, Dina.
🎧 You've been doing a great job taking care of your hair.
🎧 It's so shiny and healthy.
🎧 Thanks, Mom.
🎧 I've been trying to brush it every night before bed.
🎧 I also use the conditioner that you bought for me.
🎧 That's a good habit to have.
🎧 And it's nice to have these moments together, isn't it?
🎧 Yeah. It is.
🎧 I like it when you braid my hair.
🎧 It's relaxing.
🎧 Me too.
🎧 It reminds me of when you were little.
🎧 You've grown up so fast.
🎧 But I'll always be your little girl, right?
🎧 Always.
🎧 Now I will read a little before going to bed.
🎧 Okay, sweetie, but remember not to read too long.
 
[Reading a book]
 
🎧 "The detective examined the footprint closely,
🎧 noticing the faint trace of mud on the heel…"
🎧 "Who could it be?"
🎧 This mystery book is so interesting.
🎧 I wonder who the thief is.
🎧 Time to go to sleep, Dina. Don't stay up too late reading.
🎧 I know, Mom, but the story is just so good!
🎧 I'm at the part where they're about to catch the thief.
🎧 I know how that feels.
🎧 But you don't want to be tired tomorrow, do you?
🎧 Just one more chapter, please.
🎧 Alright, but only one.
🎧 I love you, Mom.
🎧 Good girl. Sleep tight and don't stay up too late.
🎧 Goodnight, Mom.
 
[Setting an alarm]
 
🎧 Neo, are you still not asleep?
🎧 Yes, Aunt Emma.
🎧 I must have eaten too much popcorn while watching the movie.
🎧 So I'm so full that I can't sleep.
🎧 Oh, Neo.
🎧 You have to get up early tomorrow for school.
🎧 Oh, Aunt Emma, ​​can you set the alarm for me?
🎧 I forgot about that.
🎧 Okay, I'll do it
🎧 Done.
🎧 Do you want me to read you a book to help you sleep?
🎧 I think there's no need, Aunt Emma. You have to work tomorrow.
🎧 Good boy.
 
[Going to bed]
 
🎧 Remember to dust off the blanket before going to bed, son.
🎧 Sure, Mom.
🎧 Today was a good day.
🎧 I finished my homework and had a great time with Dina.
🎧 I wonder what tomorrow will bring.
🎧 I hope it's just as good as today.
🎧 It's great having Dina around.
🎧 Her family is so nice and kind.
🎧 They invited us to dinner so we could spend time together.
🎧 That's right. I'm so happy.
🎧 Tomorrow I'll continue to do homework with Dina,
🎧 and then help with the housework.
🎧 I really want to help you and Dad.
🎧 Such a good boy, Jimmy.
🎧 This weekend, we plan to teach you how to iron clothes properly.
🎧 Would you like to join us?
🎧 Of course, Mom.
🎧 It's been a long time since we had time together.
🎧 Deal.
🎧 Alright. Sleep tight, Jimmy.
🎧 Good night, Mom.
🎧 Even though they're busy, they still make time for me.
🎧 Time to sleep!
