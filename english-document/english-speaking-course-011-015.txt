[011] English Speaking Course 011

[Waking up]

Good morning, Dina. Time to wake up.
Just five more minutes, Alex.
Dina!
Alex, are you awake?
Did you hear that? Come on!
If you stay in bed any longer, you'll be late for school.
Alright.
Look, Dina, it's morning already.
The weather is beautiful today.
Oh, it really is.
I hope today will be wonderful.
Get up.
I'll wait for you so we can brush our teeth together.
I'll be right there.

[Brushing teeth]

Dina, you need to brush for at least two minutes.
It helps keep your teeth healthy and strong.
Oh, I know, I know.
You're always reminding me.
Do you think I don't brush long enough?
I'm just making sure you have a bright smile.
You want to impress your friends, right?
But you would say I'm late if I'm slow.
I just want to do it as fast as you say.
Just 1-2 minutes won't make you late for class.
I only say that because if you sleep for another 5 minutes,
it can become 15 minutes or half an hour.
You will have a hard time controlling yourself because sleep is so attractive.
You are really serious about everything, brother.
Anyway, thank you. Sometimes you're like another parent.
And you are always teasing me.

[Morning exercise]

Come on, Dad. Let's do ten more push-ups! You've got this.
You're really pushing me today, Alex.
I'm not as young as you are.
Just trying to keep us fit.
A healthy body means a healthy mind.
And you two look funny.
Want to join us, Dina?
It's good for you.
No way! I'll stick to watching.
Exercise isn't my thing.
I am preparing breakfast, athletes.
You guys should get ready.
Thanks, Mom. We'll be right there.
Great workout, son.
Now let's refuel with some delicious breakfast.

[Making breakfast]

Thanks for helping, Alex.
Can you pass me the eggs?
Sure, Mom. Here you go.
Do you need me to cut the vegetables too?
That would be wonderful. Thank you.
It's always nice to have an extra pair of hands.
It smells so good, Mom.
What are you making today?
I'm starving.
What's for breakfast?
Scrambled eggs, toast and orange juice.
Plus, Alex is cutting some vegetables for an omelet.
And some fruit, too. We have bananas and apples.

[Getting dressed]

Dina, do you need any help picking out your clothes?
No, Mom. I think I got it.
But can you help me find my blue sweater?
Okay.
Don't forget to pack your bags, sweetie.
Sure Mom.
Dina, your blue sweater is in the laundry room.
Thanks Mom.
And wear something warm.
It's chilly outside.
Don't forget your jackets.
Got it, Dad.
Ready, Alex?
Almost, Just need my shoes.
Do you think this outfit looks okay?
You look great. Now hurry up so we can get going.

[Commuting to work]

Have a great day at work, Alex.
Thanks, Mom.
And you too, my dear girl.
I love you so much.
And love you too, Buddy!
See you this afternoon, babe.
Dad, I'll walk home with Jimmy today.
You don't have to pick me up.
Really? Okay.
Jimmy just moved here, but you two are so close.
I'm so very happy about that.
Yes, Jimmy is in the same class as me, so we often do homework together.
He helps me a lot.
It's great to have such a good friend.
We're here, Dina. Have a nice day.
Thanks, Dad, have a good day at work.

[Morning coffee]

Good morning, Aunt Emma.
Good morning, Neo. Did you sleep well?
Yeah. What's for breakfast?
There's a cereal on the kitchen table.
I'm having coffee.
Do you want some toast with your cereal?
Can I have some juice, too?
Of course. Pour yourself a glass.
Do you need help with anything else?
No. I'm good.
What time are you leaving for work?
In about an hour.
Do you want me to drop you off at school?
Yes, please.
It's much faster when you drive me.
Alright.
Finish your breakfast and get your school bag ready.
Okay, Aunt Emma, I'll go get my bag first.

[Checking emails]

Let's see what we have today.
A few client emails and some internal messages.
Good morning, Ms.
You go to work early today.
Good morning, Alex. I just want to check some mail.
Ready for another busy day?
I'm always ready.
Is there anything urgent in the emails?
Just the usual. I'll forward you the important ones.
There's a meeting at 10, so make sure you're prepared.
Thanks. I'll get started right away.
Do you need any help with the presentation?
That would be great. Let's go over it together in a bit.
Sure thing.

[Team meeting]

Alright, everyone. Let's get started. We have a lot to cover today.
First up is the new marketing campaign.
We have a few important projects to cover.
I want to hear everyone's ideas and updates.
What's the priority for today?
Are we focusing on the new clients?
Yes, let's focus on the new marketing campaign first.
We need to finalize a strategy by the end of the week.
Sounds good. I have some ideas to share.
We can use social media more actively.
Great. Let's hear them.
We need to think outside the box.
And don't forget to consider our budget.
We need to be efficient with our resources.
We also need to tell our current clients.
Should we do that today?
Yes, but let's focus on the marketing campaign first.
After that's done, we can update our clients.
I'll begin writing the strategy document.
Everyone, please send them your ideas by the end of the day.

[Lunch break]

This sandwich is really good, Dina.
Thanks, Jimmy. My mom made it fresh this morning.
Your mom is a great cook.
I wish my mom could make sandwiches like this.
She is so busy with work that she rarely cooks lunch.
Yeah, she's the best.
Next time, I'll ask mom to bring you lunch too.
You should be understanding to your mom.
I got it.
Do you want to play video games after school?
Sure. That sounds fun.
What game do you want to play?
How about the new racing game?
It's really cool.
Great choice.
I'm so excited now.

[Afternoon tasks]

Do you need any help with the report, Ms.?
The data seems a bit complicated.
Yes, please.
Can you check the data for me and make sure everything is correct?
Of course.
I'll get right on it.
We need this report ready by tomorrow, right?
Yes, it's for the client meeting.
They want to see our progress.
No problem. That's what I'm here for.
Let's make sure everything is perfect.
Thanks, Alex. You're a big help.
How are your other tests going?
I'm almost done with the marketing strategy document.
I'll send it to you for review.
Excellent.
let's finish this up quickly so we can prepare for the client meeting.
Okay, I will finish the report right away.

[Taking a walk]

Dina, do you want to go to the playground?
I want to play on the swings.
Sure, Jimmy. Let's go.
I also want to rest a little before going on.
Come on, Dina! You're too slow.
I'm coming, Jimmy.
Don't go too far ahead.
I love our walks.
It's fun to spend time with you.
Me too, Dina. It's nice to relax and enjoy the outdoors.
Look, there's an ice cream truck.
Can we get some ice cream?
Why not? Let's have a treat.
What flavor do you want?
Chocolate, please! What about you, Jimmy?
I'll have vanilla.
Let's enjoy ice creams and then head on.

[Snack time]

Dad, can I have some cookies? I'm really hungry.
Sure. Just don't eat too many. You'll ruin your dinner.
Thanks, Dad.
Can Jimmy come over later?
We promised to play games after school.
Of course. You two have fun.
But remember to finish your homework first.
We will, Dad.
Jimmy is really good at math.
He helps me a lot.
That's great.
It's important to help each other out.
Do you need any help with your project?
No, we've got it under control. Thanks, Dad.
Alright. Let me know if you need anything.
I'll be in the living room.
Thanks, Dad. You're the best.

[Finishing work]

Great work today, Alex. We got a lot done.
Thanks, Emma. It was a productive day.
The report is ready and the strategy document is complete.
Let's review the report one more time before sending it to the client.
We want everything to be perfect.
I'll make the last changes and send it to you.
Do you need anything else?
No, that's all for today.
Let's head home and rest.
You deserve a break.
That sounds good.
See you tomorrow, Emma.
Have a good evening.
See you tomorrow, Alex.
Drive safely and enjoy your evening.

[Driving home]

What a busy day.
I can't wait to get home and relax.
Hi, Dina. Hi, Jimmy.
Hi, Alex! Welcome home.
How was work?
It was busy, but good.
How was your day?
It was great. We played a lot after school.
Yeah, and we finish your homework early.
So now we're just having fun.
That's awesome.
I'm glad you both had a good day.
Hi Buddy!
Let's go inside and see what Mom and Dad are doing.

[Grocery shopping]

Neo, can you grab some tomatoes and onions?
We need them for the pasta tonight.
Sure, Aunt Emma.
Do we have enough cheese at home?
Yes, we still have some from last week.
But we need more olive oil.
Can you get that too?
I got it.
What else do we need?
Let's check our list.
We need fresh bread, milk and some fruit for tomorrow's lunch.
Oh, and cereal for breakfast.
I'll get the bread and milk.
Do you want to pick the fruits?
Sure, I'll get some apples and bananas.
And I also want to get some extra snacks for the week.
Could I?
Of course. Good boy.
It's a reward for going shopping with me to prepare meals.
I love you the most, Aunt Emma!
Let's head to the checkout.

[Preparing dinner]

Dina, can you help me chop the vegetables?
Sure, Mom. I'll wash them first.
Alex, can you set the table?
Of course, Dad. How many plates do we need?
Seven. Jimmy's family is joining us for dinner.
Great, I'll get everything ready.
I'll start cooking the pasta.
It should be ready in about 20 minutes.
Dina, can you pass me the onions?
Here you go, Mom. I'll start with the tomatoes.
Thanks, sweetie.
Alex, do we have enough drinks for everyone?
Yes, I put some soda and juice in the fridge earlier.

[Family time]

Thanks for having us over, Lisa. The dinner was delicious.
You're welcome, Danny.
It's always nice to have your family here.
Jimmy, do you want to play a board game?
Sure, Dina. Let's play the one with the pirates.
These two kids are together all day.
I'm glad Dina has Jimmy.
You know, we're pretty busy and can't spend much time with him.
How about we all play together? It will be more fun.
Good idea. Let's set up the game.
Who wants to be the captain?
I do! I love being the captain.
I'll be the treasure hunter.
What about you, Alex?
I'll be the navigator.
Let's start the adventure!
I'll be the map reader.
Let's find that treasure!
This is going to be fun.
Let's see who wins.

[Watching TV]

Aunt Emma, can we watch the new superhero movie?
Sure, Neo. But only for an hour, okay?
You have school tomorrow.
Okay. I promise.
Can we have some popcorn too?
Of course, I'll make some. You get the movie ready.
I found the movie, Aunt Emma! It's starting soon.
Great! The popcorn will be ready in a minute.
Here you go, Neo. Enjoy the movie.
Thanks, Aunt Emma. This is the best part of the day.
I'm glad you're enjoying it. Remember, just one hour.
I remember. I'll go to bed right after.

[Laundry room]

More laundry?
It never seems to end, does it?
Between work, Jimmy's school uniforms,
It feels like I'm doing this every day.
Well, let's solve this together.
I'll fold the towels while you sort the clothes.
Deal.
By the way, did you notice that Jimmy's shirts are getting more wrinkled these days?
I think he's been skipping the ironing.
Ah, I'll have a talk with him.
Maybe we can teach him a thing or two about ironing this weekend.
Are you free?
Yes, I am.
And that's a good idea.
He's doing great at work, but some life skills wouldn't hurt.
You know, we make a pretty good team.
We do.
And it's nice to have some time together, even if it's just folding laundry.
Agreed. I'll handle the ironing this weekend.
We can make it a family lesson.
Sounds like a plan.
Maybe we can even ask Jimmy to help out.

[Cleaning the house]

Alex, can you help me move this rug?
I think Buddy's hair is all over it.
Sure, Dina. Let's roll it up and take it outside to shake it out.
Do you ever feel like we're just moving dirt around?
No matter how much we clean, it just keeps coming back.
That's just life, Dina. But it's worth it to have a clean house.
Plus, it's kind of nice to see everything neat and tidy.
I guess so. And it feels good to help out, too.
Exactly.
And once we're done, we can relax and enjoy the weekend.
How about we finish quickly and then take Buddy for a walk later?
That sounds awesome!
I'll vacuum the living room while you dust the shelves.
This place is really starting to shine.
We should do this more often.
It does feel good, doesn't it?
And it's nice that everyone is pitching in.
Yeah, it's a team effort.
Maybe we should make this a weekly thing.
I like that idea.
We'll keep the house clean, and it gives us some family time together.
It's good practice for the kids.
They're going to need these skills when they're out on their own.
Absolutely.
Let's finish up and see what the kids are up to.

[Walking the dog]

Buddy looks so happy to be outside.
I think this is his favorite part of the day.
It's probably mine, too.
It's nice to get some fresh air after being inside all day.
Plus, Buddy gets to meet all his dog friends.
Look, there's Max!
Mrs. Thompson! How's Max doing?
He's doing great! Buddy looks like he's having a blast.
He always does.
They should have a playdate sometime.
That's a great idea! We can set something up this weekend.

[Talking on the phone]

Yes, Mr. Johnson,
I have reviewed the proposal and I think we are ready to proceed.
I will send you the completed documents tomorrow morning.
That sounds perfect, Emma.
Your team has done an excellent job, as always.
Thank you.
I'll be in touch if there's anything else we need to discuss.
Have a great evening.
You too, Emma. Goodbye.
Another project wrapped up. Now I can finally relax.
I should probably check on Neo. He's been so quiet tonight.

[Evening exercise]

It's been a long day, but it's important to keep up with our exercise routine.
It is quite difficult to maintain in the beginning.
You're doing great, babe.
Just take it one step at a time.
Thanks, John.
I'm trying to stay consistent, but it's kind of hard after a long day.
I get it. But even a little bit each day makes a difference.
And it helps clear your mind.
Yeah, I feel that. It's like a reset button for the day.
Remember to breathe.
And don't forget to stretch after. It'll help you a lot.
I will.
I'll admit, I've been skipping the stretching part lately.
That's the key to staying flexible and avoiding injuries.
Let's finish with some stretches together.
Definitely going to need it.

[Taking a shower]

This feels amazing.
It's the perfect way to end the day.
Diana, sweetheart. Don't forget to wash your hair.
And don't take too long.
Your brother needs to shower, too.
Okay, mom.
I'm almost done.
I should wear a face mask tonight.
My skin feels a bit dry.
The bathroom's all yours, Alex.
Thanks, Diana. I'll be quick.
No rush.
I'm just going to relax in my room.

[Planning tomorrow]

Let's see.
I've got that meeting at 10 a.m,
followed by lunch with Mr. Collins.
I'll need to prepare those documents tonight.
I should also review the team's ideas on the project.
I want to make sure everything's on track.
Here's your lotus tea. Drink it before bed to help you sleep.
Thanks, Mom.
What are you doing?
I just want to review some work for tomorrow.
Don't overdo it.
Your health is the most important thing.
Thanks, mom.
I'll be done in a bit.
Good night, Mom.
I'll probably chat with Dina for a bit before I go to bed.
Good night.
It's going to be a hectic day, but I'm ready.
Just need to get a good night's sleep.

[Brushing hair]

Your hair looks lovely, Dina.
You've been doing a great job taking care of your hair.
It's so shiny and healthy.
Thanks, Mom.
I've been trying to brush it every night before bed.
I also use the conditioner that you bought for me.
That's a good habit to have.
And it's nice to have these moments together, isn't it?
Yeah. It is.
I like it when you braid my hair.
It's relaxing.
Me too.
It reminds me of when you were little.
You've grown up so fast.
But I'll always be your little girl, right?
Always.
Now I will read a little before going to bed.
Okay, sweetie, but remember not to read too long.

[Reading a book]

"The detective examined the footprint closely,
noticing the faint trace of mud on the heel…"
"Who could it be?"
This mystery book is so interesting.
I wonder who the thief is.
Time to go to sleep, Dina. Don't stay up too late reading.
I know, Mom, but the story is just so good!
I'm at the part where they're about to catch the thief.
I know how that feels.
But you don't want to be tired tomorrow, do you?
Just one more chapter, please.
Alright, but only one.
I love you, Mom.
Good girl. Sleep tight and don't stay up too late.
Goodnight, Mom.

[Setting an alarm]

Neo, are you still not asleep?
Yes, Aunt Emma.
I must have eaten too much popcorn while watching the movie.
So I'm so full that I can't sleep.
Oh, Neo.
You have to get up early tomorrow for school.
Oh, Aunt Emma, ​​can you set the alarm for me?
I forgot about that.
Okay, I'll do it
Done.
Do you want me to read you a book to help you sleep?
I think there's no need, Aunt Emma. You have to work tomorrow.
Good boy.

[Going to bed]

Remember to dust off the blanket before going to bed, son.
Sure, Mom.
Today was a good day.
I finished my homework and had a great time with Dina.
I wonder what tomorrow will bring.
I hope it's just as good as today.
It's great having Dina around.
Her family is so nice and kind.
They invited us to dinner so we could spend time together.
That's right. I'm so happy.
Tomorrow I'll continue to do homework with Dina,
and then help with the housework.
I really want to help you and Dad.
Such a good boy, Jimmy.
This weekend, we plan to teach you how to iron clothes properly.
Would you like to join us?
Of course, Mom.
It's been a long time since we had time together.
Deal.
Alright. Sleep tight, Jimmy.
Good night, Mom.
Even though they're busy, they still make time for me.
Time to sleep!
