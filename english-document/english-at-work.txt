[001 The Interview]

🎧 Hold tight please! This is Anna, on a bus going to an interview for a job as a sales executive at Tip Top Trading – one of London's fastest growing companies. How are you feeling Anna?
🎧 Oh, a little nervous but I really want this job.
🎧 Well don't worry Anna, as long as you say the right things, you'll be fine.
🎧 The right things!? Like what?
🎧 You need to sell yourself, be confident, not arrogant and give examples. Like: A good example that comes to mind. I'm particularly proud of. Timekeeping is important to me.
🎧 Oh right. Thanks. Perhaps you can come with me?
🎧 Sorry Anna, you're on your own now – but we'll be listening in. Look! You've just arrived. Good luck!
🎧 Come in. Hello, I'm Paul, the Manager of Tip Top Trading. And you must be….?
🎧 It's Anna.
🎧 Yes, very good. Thanks for coming. Now somewhere in this pile, I've got your CV…
🎧 Err, is that it there?
🎧 Oh yes, thanks Hannah. Your qualifications look impressive but what sales experience can you bring to our company?
🎧 I worked in a shop once.
🎧 Ohhh Anna! Sell yourself. Give a good example!
🎧 Oh right…mmm….well a good example that comes to mind is when I was involved with a campaign to promote and sell a new range of clothes – I loved doing it and it was…
🎧 Oh sorry, excuse me, here's your tea Paul.: Thanks Denise. Now Anna, it looks like you've achieved a lot during your time at university. Could you give me an example of good team working during your time there?
🎧 Sorry! I forgot the sugar.
🎧 Thank you Denise.
🎧 Hmm, so you want an example? I was the treasurer of the debating society at university. That was OK I suppose.
🎧 Come on Anna. Be more enthusiastic – the debating society is exciting!
🎧 I mean… I'm particularly proud of how I organised the finances for the debating society. We had a very small budget and I had to make decisions on what to buy.
🎧 I like it! "I'm particularly proud of" - Positive but not boasting. You're doing well.
🎧 Very impressive – so you're a good planner Anna! We like organised people here... ooops, silly me. I seemed to have spilt tea over your CV.
🎧 Oh, do you need some help?
🎧 Oh no…I'm sure it'll dry out… carry on please…
🎧 Also… timekeeping is important to me…
🎧 "Timekeeping is important to me" – that's good!
🎧 I always try to complete my work on time. At university I never handed my assignments in late.
🎧 That's good to hear. We like punctuality here…
🎧 Excuse me Paul. Sorry it's a bit late – but I thought you might like a biscuit with your tea.
🎧 Hmm thanks….oh lovely, custard creams… mmm. Now Hannah, finally I wanted to ask you what exactly made you apply for this job at this company?
🎧 Errrr… ooo… well. The reason I applied is….
🎧 Yes, yes, yes Anna? Do you need a bit more time to think?
🎧 Errr…mmm…
🎧 What's she going to say? How would you answer that? Join us next time to find out. Before we go, here's a reminder of some of the great lines Anna's used today… A good example that comes to mind I'm particularly proud of. Timekeeping is important to me. Until next time, bye bye! ·

[002 The Interruption]

🎧 Hello! Welcome back to the offices of Tip Top Trading, where Anna's interview for a sales job continues. When we last said goodbye, Tip Top boss Paul had asked Anna why she wanted the job. First she said:
🎧 Errr... mmmmm...
🎧 Since then, she's added:
🎧 Mmmm... errr...
🎧 And as we join her again, Anna is saying:
🎧 Well, errrr... I'm errr.
🎧 Come on, Anna! If you can't think of the word you need, find another way of saying it.
🎧 I am... Well, I really, really want this job and I am willing to work very hard if I get it.
🎧 So you’re very motivated, then?
🎧 Motivated! Yes, that’s it. I am really motivated.
🎧 Good! Why?
🎧 Now over to you Anna; structure your answer! Say, 'firstly', then give your first reason, 'secondly' and then a second reason. Then say, 'above all' and give a really, really good, enthusiastic final reason! Go for it: firstly!
🎧 Firstly!
🎧 Firstly...?
🎧 Firstly, this job is an ideal match for my skills and experience: I've spent several years working in sales and I get on with people easily. Well, I mean, apart from the ones I don't like, of course. Secondly, I know Tip Top Trading is one of the fastest-growing companies in London, and I want to be part of that.
🎧 That's absolutely right. Tip Top Trading is the fastest-growing company in the plastic fruit sector. But enough about the company; this is all about you, Annabel.
🎧 Anna.
🎧 Sorry, Anna. Where were we?
🎧 Well, I said that firstly, this job is an ideal match for my skills and experience, secondly, the company is growing fast... and… and… above all… the reason I want this job is…
🎧 Yes? (knock on the door) Denise! Is everything alright?
🎧 No Paul, it’s not. Everything is not OK!
🎧 You look pale. Here, sit down, drink what's left of my tea.
🎧 Oh, thank you! Oh… what are those bits floating in it?
🎧 Oh they're just lumps of soggy biscuit. In fact, if I can just... get that bit out... with my finger... for you… Mmm, delicious! Now, tell me what happened.
🎧 Well, it's terrible...
🎧 Oh dear! Just as Anna was doing really well, it looks like her interview has come to a sudden end. What’s happened? Join us next time to find out. But before we go, here's a reminder of how Anna structured her response:
🎧 Firstly, this job is an ideal match for my skills and experience
🎧 Secondly, I know Tip Top Trading is one of the fastest-growing companiesin London and…
🎧 above all… the reason I want this job is…
🎧 Anna couldn’t remember the word 'motivated’, so she just found another way of saying what she meant.
🎧 I really, really want the job and I am willing to work very hard if I get it.
🎧 Nice work, Anna! Let's hope you get the chance to finish your interview next week!

[003 The Crisis]

🎧 Here we are again at Tip Top Trading, where Anna's interview for a sales job has been suddenly interrupted. Office assistant Denise has entered the room, looking very worried. What's wrong? And will Anna have any suggestions that might help?
🎧 I don't know what to do!
🎧 So what's the matter Denise?
🎧 You know the PowerPoint presentation?
🎧 The one we've been preparing for the last two months?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 The one that's very, very important and that we need this afternoon?
🎧 That one.
🎧 Aha.
🎧 We've lost everything!
🎧 No!
🎧 I had it on a USB stick, to transfer it, but the stick has vanished!
🎧 Right Anna, now is your chance to help them find solutions to the problem.
🎧 You'll need phrases like:
🎧 Can I make a suggestion?
🎧 Why don't you...?
🎧 Have you tried...?
🎧 Maybe we could...?
🎧 How about...?
🎧 I have an idea!
🎧 But don't you have it saved on your computer?
🎧 No, it was taking up a lot of space, so I deleted it.
🎧 So you have lost the only copy we have.
🎧 Yes.
🎧 What idiots! I've never seen such a disorganised office. Go on, you'd better help them, Anna.
🎧 Can I make a suggestion?
🎧 Yes, please do!
🎧 Why don't you try looking in your recycle bin? It might still be there.
🎧 I did. It isn't.
🎧 Have you tried asking your colleagues if they've seen the memory stick?
🎧 I did. They haven't.
🎧 How about looking through your rubbish bin to see if you threw it away by mistake?
🎧 (getting shirty) I don't do silly things like that!
🎧 All very sensible suggestions Anna, thank you.
🎧 Maybe I could do a big office search for you...? I'm good at finding things.
🎧 There are confidential documents in this office – non-staff are not allowed to see them.
🎧 Now, now Denise. Why don't you drink up that nice tea?
🎧 I have an idea! Did you ever email the presentation to anyone?
🎧 Golly gosh, you did Denise! You emailed it to me to proof-read. It'll be in my inbox somewhere. Good thinking Anna!
🎧 I was just about to suggest that myself.
🎧 Problem solved. Thank you Anna!
🎧 Pleasure.
🎧 Well done Anna!
🎧 Right, now please leave us Denise. Anna and I will continue our interview. Would you like a biscuit Anna?
🎧 Thank you. Oh, what's that?
🎧 Oh golly gosh, the USB stick! It was mixed in with the plate of biscuits that Denise brought in.
🎧 It's wet
🎧 Yes, I think maybe I stirred my tea with it at one point. Oh well. Now, where were we...? My goodness, it's 11 o'clock! I have a meeting right now! I'm afraid I'm going to have to go. But I've made my mind up about you anyway. I suppose you'd like to know if you've got the job?
🎧 Yes please!
🎧 Ah - Stop right there! I'm sure everybody would like to know if Anna's got the job – but everybody's going to have to wait until we've heard her helpful phrases once again:
🎧 Can I make a suggestion?
🎧 Why don't you try looking in your recycle bin?
🎧 Have you tried asking your colleagues if they've seen the memory stick?
🎧 How about...?
🎧 Maybe I could do a big office search for you...?
🎧 How about looking through your rubbish bin...?
🎧 I have an idea!
🎧 Anna, we need someone who can think on her feet and who is a first-rate people person. Someone who sees solutions, not problems... someone like you! So if you want the job, it's yours!
🎧 Ah, now think carefully Anna – do you really want to work for these people? They seem a bit... disorganised.
🎧 I would definitely like the job! Thank you!
🎧 So be it. Join us again next week for Anna's first day as a sales executive at Tip Top Trading.

[004 Doing lunch]

🎧 Last week, Anna got the job of sales executive at Tip Top Trading, thanks to her quick-thinking in an office crisis. Today it's her first day in the office. How are you feeling now, Anna?
🎧 Excited, but a bit worried. I really want to make a good first impression.
🎧 Well, you're going to need some phrases to introduce yourself politely, such as:
🎧 Hello, I don't think we've met.
🎧 You must be – and say the person's name.
🎧 I've just joined the team.
🎧 Nice to meet you.
🎧 Have you worked here long?
🎧 Why don't you start by saying hello to Tom Darcy, the Senior Account Manager?
🎧 Yah, yah, no, yah, yah, OK, yah. I'll seal the deal, yah, no worries. OK, see ya mate, bye!
🎧 Hello, I don't think we've met.
🎧 No.
🎧 You must be Tom. I'm Anna. I've just joined the team.
🎧 Uh huh.
🎧 Nice to meet you. Have you worked here long?
🎧 Sorry, I'm quite busy right now – I've got a big deal just coming through. But let's get together sometime. Um... can you do lunch tomorrow?
🎧 You want me to do lunch? Well, I'm not very -
🎧 Sorry, important client. Lunch tomorrow at 12.30 then?
🎧 (On the phone) Tom speaking. Yah! Frankie! So what's the latest, are we on?
🎧 Well, OK then.
🎧 Great Anna! You used some nice phrases to introduce yourself. It's a shame Tom thinks he's too important to do the same.
🎧 I'm sure he's just busy. But I'm a bit worried about tomorrow!
🎧 (The next day…)
🎧 Good morning Paul!
🎧 Good morning Anna, are you OK?
🎧 Fine, the kitchen's through there, isn't it?
🎧 Er, yes.
🎧 Anna!
🎧 Oh hi, Denise!
🎧 What are you doing?
🎧 Cooking lunch for Tom.
🎧 You what? asked me to have lunch ready for 12.30.
🎧 Did he indeed?
🎧 Er, Anna.
🎧 Hi Tom!
🎧 What are you doing?
🎧 Spring rolls, followed by crispy duck in black bean sauce.
🎧 No, I mean, why are you cooking?
🎧 Well, if I don't start now, it won't be ready for you by 12.30.
🎧 Oh, you misunderstood me, Anna. When I said "Can you do lunch?" it didn't mean "Can you make lunch?" It meant "Are you available to come to lunch with me?" In a cafe or something.
🎧 Oh!
🎧 Mmm... something smells good, but what's going on here?
🎧 Anna thinks it's her job to cook for people!
🎧 No, no, I misunderstood!
🎧 Anna just got a bit confused.
🎧 Well, never mind, it looks tasty.
🎧 There's enough for everyone if you want some.
🎧 I think that's a splendid idea, we can have an office picnic!
🎧 Yes!
🎧 Mmm, that sauce looks delicious.
🎧 Yes, it's my favourite.
🎧 Well, once again everything has worked out well for Anna! Before we go, a reminder of the phrases she used:
🎧 Hello, I don't think we've met.
🎧 You must be Tom.
🎧 I've just joined the team.
🎧 Nice to meet you.
🎧 Have you worked here long?
🎧 Just remember - if somebody says "Would you like to do lunch?" they're not usually expecting you to cook for them! Goodbye.

[005 The Queen of Sheba]

🎧 Welcome back to English at Work. We're still in Anna's first week in the busy offices of Tip Top Trading. How's it going Anna?
🎧 Everything's still so new to me. I keep needing to ask people for help!
🎧 Well, that's only natural at the beginning. To ask people politely for help use the words would and could. You can also use the word please, but don't make the mistake of thinking's enough to make what you say polite.
🎧 Er, ok.
🎧 Hello Anna!
🎧 Oh hi, Paul!
🎧 I was wondering if you could do something for me?
🎧 Yes of course.
🎧 Would you be able to print out a file for me? It's a document on CBL – Convincing Bananas Limited – they're one of our suppliers. The file should
🎧 be on the system and could I have it in the next ten minutes please, as they're on their way here for a meeting?
🎧 Yes. Oh no, I've no idea how to find it! Tom...?!
🎧 Er, ask Denise. She should know.
🎧 Ok, thanks Tom, I'll ask her.
🎧 (on the phone to Sharon) I'd warned her, you know, I said 'Victoria, if you don't change your hairdresser?
🎧 One day you'll… hold on a moment. Anna?
🎧 Please email me the background file on CBL.
🎧 Er!
🎧 Thank you.
🎧 (on the phone) Who does that girl think she is?... Anna... new girl... I told you about her... yes with the saucepans, that's the one. She's only been
🎧 here five minutes and she's already acting like the Queen of Sheba... 
🎧 Oh and Denise, please send it to me within five minutes, Paul needs it soon. Thank you.
🎧 Really!
🎧 He he, good to see who's the boss, eh Denise?
🎧 Really!
🎧 Er, Anna, I think you've upset Denise...?
🎧 Upset Denise?
🎧 You were a bit rude when you asked her to help.
🎧 Was I?
🎧 Remember what I said Anna. Just using 'please’ to ask someone to do something can sound a little rude.
🎧 Oh.
🎧 Instead of saying 'Please send me the file' you could say 'Could you possibly send me the file?' or 'Would you mind sending me the file?'
🎧 Oh! English is so confusing! I'll try to remember that. Oh no, the printer isn't even set up! Tom?
🎧 Yeah?
🎧 Please help me with…I mean, could you possibly help me with the printer?
🎧 Er... I need to finish this email to a really important new client.
🎧 But it's really urgent. Would you mind writing your email later?
🎧 Okay, since you asked so nicely. Let's have a look...
🎧 Well, it's a good thing Anna has understood how to use 'could' and 'would' to ask for things, before she upsets anyone else. Let's hear those phrases
🎧 again:
🎧 I was wondering if you could do something for me?
🎧 Would you be able to print out a file for me?
🎧 Could I have it within ten minutes please?
🎧 Could you possibly help me with the printer?
🎧 Would you mind writing your email later?
🎧 The printer seems to be working well, but how well are Anna and Denise working together? Are these two going to be enemies?
🎧 Really! 'Denise do this! Denise do that!' I'm telling you Sharon, I've almost had enough! I get treated like I'm some kind of servant!

[006 Double-booked]

🎧 'Look forward to hearing from you soon. Kind regards, Anna.’
🎧 (on the phone) ... And Margery said: 'I don't think I've ever seen a vegetable quite that size before...'
🎧 Where's that hole-punch?!
🎧 Ah, business as usual in the offices of Tip Top Trading.
🎧 Oh for goodness sake! What a disaster! I can't believe it!
🎧 But one member of the team seems bothered.
🎧 Arrgh!
🎧 Anna, this is the moment to show you’re willing to help.
🎧 Yes!
🎧 Use phrases like 'Is there anything I can do?' 'Let me help!' or, to be more informal, you can say, 'Can I give you a hand?' or 'Give me a shout if you need anything!'
🎧 Right.
🎧 Go on!
🎧 Are you okay Tom?
🎧 (grumpily) No.
🎧 Is there anything I can do?
🎧 (grumpily) No.
🎧 Oh. What's wrong?
🎧 Everything.
🎧 I see. Can I give you a hand?
🎧 My computer has crashed. I've lost my phone. And there's a big, big problem with my timetable. I’ve got two meetings scheduled at the same
🎧 time with two extremely important clients. I can't do them both at once!
🎧 Let me help.
🎧 Thanks Anna, but these are big, big clients. They need someone of experience.
🎧 Well, give me a shout if you need anything!
🎧 I can handle this, alright?
🎧 'I can handle this'... ungrateful idiot. But you used all the right phrases Anna, well done. Anyway, I bet he'll change his mind.
🎧 Oooh, I know, and the purple ones are so much more powerful...
🎧 Anna? Could you help me?
🎧 Ha! I told you so!
🎧 They've both arrived at once! Oh god! I'll deal with Mrs Kumquat...
🎧 Okay.
🎧 You talk to Mr Lime, he's from a company called Citrus Ventures. They own hundreds of juice bars.
🎧 Are you sure that's a good idea Tom?
🎧 I don't have much choice, do I?
🎧 Well I could
🎧 Just keep him occupied Anna, tell him how great he is... no, no, tell him how great I am. Find out what he wants. If it's about the - well, never
🎧 mind, just be nice. 
🎧 Understood.
🎧 Mr Lime! Are you well?
🎧 Yes, but I'm actually rather angry too.
🎧 Ah, well let me introduce you to Anna!
🎧 Mr Lime, it's a pleasure to meet you! Let me help with your coat.
🎧 Oh er... Thank you.
🎧 Can I give you a hand with your scarf too, Mr Lime?
🎧 Oh... Thanks.
🎧 Now, please come this way and you can tell me what's wrong.
🎧 Well done! Anna used some good phrases to step in and help with this mess. Let's hear them again:
🎧 Is there anything I can do?
🎧 Let me help.
🎧 Can I give you a hand?
🎧 Give me a shout if you need anything.
🎧 But Mr Lime is obviously upset about something. What is it? And how will Anna deal with the problem? Let's hope it doesn't end in disaster!

[007 Mr Lime's grapefruits]

🎧 Ah hello! Welcome back to Tip Top Trading – the UK's leading wholesaler of imitation fruit. Today you're joining us in the middle of the action! Anna is with an important client Mr Lime, from Citrus Ventures. He's angry and she'll have to calm him down. She could cope brilliantly here or this could be a horrible mess!
🎧 Well Mr Lime, how can I help you?
🎧 On Monday I was meant to receive 8,000 plastic grapefruit from Tip Top Trading.
🎧 Yes.
🎧 The delivery was made on Tuesday.
🎧 Oh dear.
🎧 And instead of 8,000 plastic grapefruit, I got 800,000 plastic pineapples!
🎧 Right Anna, this is serious. You're going to have to apologise and show that you really mean it. Say: I'm really sorry to hear that.
🎧 I'm really sorry to hear that, Mr Lime.
🎧 What on earth am I going to do with 800,000 plastic pineapples?
🎧 Show Mr Lime that you understand the problem. These are phrases you can use: That's totally unacceptable. That must have been very inconvenient for you. And then promise to fix the problem. Say: You have my word that we will sort this out. We can do something to make up for the inconvenience. It won't happen again.
🎧 800,000 plastic pineapples!
🎧 That's totally unacceptable.
🎧 I didn't even have anywhere to put them - and pineapples are so much bigger than grapefruit!
🎧 It must have been very inconvenient for you.
🎧 It certainly was! When he took my order, your colleague Tom told me that Tip Top Trading was the most reliable firm in the industry!
🎧 You have my word that we will sort this out. We'll remove the pineapples and have your grapefruit sent via express delivery this afternoon.
🎧 Good. Thank you.
🎧 And we could include some of our latest-edition imitation oranges to make up for the inconvenience.
🎧 Oh! Well, that would be nice!
🎧 Tip top Anna! Excellent work and excellent words.
🎧 They're made with revolutionary premium faux-orange, laser-curve definition technology... you will be the first to have them!
🎧 Wow, now that's good customer service! Tell me, do you have any other artificial fruits in this range?
🎧 Yes. Well, it's a bit of a secret, but you're a trusted client, so I think I can tell you...
🎧 Go on...
🎧 We're about to unveil a new Imperial Lemon.
🎧 Really?
🎧 I can't tell you any more for now. But…
🎧 Yes...
🎧 Maybe we could present it to you more formally in a couple of weeks, when it's ready for release...?
🎧 Sounds perfect.
🎧 You would be the first to see it!
🎧 Excellent. Thank you, er... Anna, isn't it?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 A very pretty name.
🎧 Thanks. It's spelled the same forwards and backwards. 
🎧 Is it really?
🎧 Anyway, Mr Lime, we'll fix this grapefruit problem for you, and I promise you, it won't happen again.
🎧 Good, good. You're new here, aren't you Anna?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 Well I look forward to working with you.
🎧 What a success! Mr Lime has come away a very happy customer! Here are the phrases Anna used while apologising:
🎧 I'm really sorry to hear that, Mr Lime.
🎧 That's totally unacceptable.
🎧 It must have been very inconvenient for you.
🎧 You have my word that we will sort this out.
🎧 And we could include some of our latest-edition imitation oranges to make up for the inconvenience.
🎧 I promise you, it won't happen again.
🎧 What will Anna's boss Paul have to say about her work today? Join us next week to find out.

[008 Room 301]

🎧 Good afternoon.
🎧 Hi, good afternoon.
🎧 Anna, Tom, room 301 please. Now.
🎧 Welcome back to Tip Top Trading, where things are a teeny bit tense today. Paul has called Tom and Anna into room 301, the place where difficult conversations happen. Perhaps Paul has found out about yesterday's unhappy clients.
🎧 Oh dear.
🎧 You should be okay Anna. After the way you coped with Mr Lime, you should be praised.
🎧 Really? What do you think Paul will say?
🎧 Well, if he is pleased, he'll say things like:
🎧 Well done.
🎧 You handled it well.
🎧 Great job.
🎧 I'm really impressed.
🎧 And if he's not?
🎧 Well, I suppose – oop. Here’s Paul now!
🎧 Well, Tom, Anna... Yesterday was not a great day. Two clients came in with serious complaints. Mrs Kumquat received a delivery of imitation bananas that were purple, not very convincing. And Mr Lime ordered grapefruits, but got pineapples. Tom.
🎧 Yes.
🎧 Were you responsible for these errors?
🎧 Well... yes, but…
🎧 Look, mistakes happen. But it seems that Mrs Kumquat left our offices even angrier than when she came in and she says she will never use Tip Top Trading again.
🎧 I tried my best.
🎧 Hmmm. I understand you told her to spray-paint the bananas and to 'stop being such a miserable old witch'.
🎧 Yeah, well look, she'd been very rude to me.
🎧 If you weren't such a good salesman I would fire you for that. Anna.
🎧 Yes.
🎧 Well done. Not only was Mr Lime satisfied that his problem would be resolved, but we might even get some extra business from him, thanks to your Imperial Lemon proposal.
🎧 I hope so.
🎧 You were in a difficult situation and you handled it well. You remained calm, friendly and professional. So, great job. I'm really impressed. I'm going to…
🎧 (phone rings)
🎧 Who's that? Oh no. It's a call from the USA.
🎧 Oh god!
🎧 What?
🎧 It's the boss!
🎧 Whose boss?
🎧 Ours! The big, big boss, based in America.
🎧 Shhhh! (on the phone) Hellooo? Ah, good afternoon Mr Socrates, I mean, er- morning, ha ha, where you are it's … yes, no, n-yes …. I'm not sure. Mrs Kumquat … did she? … well, it was very unfortunate …. purple, yes …. totally unacceptable …. I will. If you'd like I could …. Mr Socrates? Hello? Mr Socrates? Oh, he's gone. Right where was I? Tom, great work. Anna, I'm disappointed. No, no, Anna, great work, I want you to take charge of the Imperial Lemon presentation. Tom, if you speak to a client like that again there will be disciplinary action. Mrs Kumquat was so angry she even emailed Mr Socrates. Ok, that’s it.
🎧 Phew! What a relief for Anna. Let's listen again to some of the phrases Paul used to praise her:
🎧 Well done.
🎧 You were in a difficult situation and you handled it well.
🎧 So, great job. I'm really impressed.
🎧 He also explained why he thought Anna had done a good job:
🎧 You remained calm, friendly and professional.
🎧 Excellent work Anna. But Tom's mistakes have given everyone a lot of work to do tomorrow.
🎧 First thing tomorrow we need to sort this mess out. Tom, I want you to phone every single client and check the orders. Anna, you can go to the warehouse and find out what's going on in there!

[009 The warehouse]

🎧 Welcome back! This is what's happening today: as a result of some embarrassing mistakes in deliveries, Tip Top Trading's big boss in America has ordered a re-check of every order this month. So, Paul is talking to key customers to see if they've got what they needed:
🎧 I just want to check you're happy with the grapes?, whom we all know was responsible for the disaster, is phoning his clients to make sure he has the correct information about what they want:
🎧 Ya, yah, I just want to make absolutely sure we get the order right for you and have the correct number of fruit...
🎧 Denise is, well, talking on the phone to a friend.
🎧 Brown shoes don't look right on him! He's not a brown shoe sort of person...
🎧 Anna has to go down to the warehouse, where the products are prepared for delivery.
🎧 I have to speak to Mr Ingle. Apparently he's not very friendly! He might not like me asking lots of questions!
🎧 Well, be polite, and start your sentences with things like:
🎧 I just want to make sure that...
🎧 Could you possibly clarify...
🎧 I just want to check...
🎧 Just to be absolutely clear...
🎧 One thing I wasn't sure of was...
🎧 Good luck!
🎧 Mr Ingle, I don't think we've met yet, I'm Anna.
🎧 Hello. Oi! What are you doing with those boxes? I told you to put them in storage. Anna, is it?
🎧 Yes, sorry to bother you, I just want to check something. We've had a few problems with orders….
🎧 Well, that's not my fault. I do exactly what I'm asked to do. (To workers) No, not there, in storage!
🎧 Oh, well, I just want to make sure that….
🎧 Thirty years I've been doing this job, and I've never made a mistake.
🎧 Of course, but because we've had problems, we need to make absolutely sure that all deliveries are correct.
🎧 Humph.
🎧 Could you possibly clarify what went out in today's delivery to Mr Berry of, er, Bluetree Enterprises?
🎧 500 redcurrants.
🎧 Right. That's fine.
🎧 Well done Anna, this is going very well. Remember that other phrase – "I just want to check…"
🎧 OK. Now, I just want to check what was sent to Cocoline Limited – it should have been fifteen mangos...
🎧 Yeah. That's right.
🎧 Great, and just to be absolutely clear, you sent the soft mangos, not the plastic ones?
🎧 Yes, just like I was told to.
🎧 Good. One thing I wasn't sure of was whether we had enough yellow bananas in stock – I know there are some purple ones, but...
🎧 Yeah well, we do need more yellow bananas.
🎧 Okay, I'll just write that down. Thank you Mr Ingle. By the way, I like your overalls!
🎧 Oh thanks.
🎧 Well he was a bit unfriendly, but Anna got what she needed. Here are the phrases she used:
🎧 I just want to make sure that...
🎧 Could you possibly clarify...
🎧 I just want to check...
🎧 Just to be absolutely clear...
🎧 One thing I wasn't sure of was... 
🎧 Well, everything in the warehouse seems to be okay. Back in the office, Tom is having less luck.
🎧 (on the phone) Really? Here it says 5,000 not five... oh...
🎧 It's going to be a long day for him! Until next time. Bye!

[010 The brainstorm]

🎧 Welcome! The team at Tip Top Trading are hard at work, making plans for the launch and presentation of their latest product: the revolutionary, almost real Imperial Lemon. They are 'brainstorming', sharing ideas on how to make their lemon a success.
🎧 But it needs to be bright!
🎧 This is much more exciting.
🎧 But having three colours would work better.
🎧 There is a lot of disagreement going on, which is putting Anna's vocabulary to the test!
🎧 Right, I'm taking the final decision: the colour scheme will be green and yellow, so that's that. Now, the first presentation will be to er, Mr, er, Slime.
🎧 Mr Lime.
🎧 Oh, er, Mr Lime - that bit of biscuit looked like an 's' – Mr Lime, thank you Annabel.
🎧 Anna.
🎧 Mr Lime and his team at Citrus Ventures. Ideas please!
🎧 Why don't we offer Citrus Ventures a special opening offer: 20% off Imperial Lemon orders made this month.
🎧 Hmm...
🎧 We could even do that for all our regular clients.
🎧 That would be a big risk.
🎧 No.
🎧 If we do that once, all our clients will start asking for 20% off everything.
🎧 No, I disagree.
🎧 We'll be bankrupt!
🎧 No, you're wrong.
🎧 Er- Anna, maybe you should find a better way of saying you disagree with Denise.
🎧 I'm so frustrated! I can't think of the right words.
🎧 It helps if you try phrases like:
🎧 Well, I'm not so sure about that... then explain why.
🎧 Or start your sentence with 'but' when you want to disagree with what has just been said.
🎧 Or, to seem more polite, you can try:
🎧 I see your point, but actually I think...
🎧 I'll try.
🎧 And don't be aggressive Anna - and give your reasons too, or you'll upset Denise again!
🎧 OK. Well, I'm not so sure about that. I think it will improve our sales of lemons and make our clients happy. Happy clients will come back to buy more.
🎧 Yes, that's a good point Annabe - Anna.
🎧 But 20% is a lot – maybe 5% would be better.
🎧 But if we're going to make a special offer, we should make it so good that everyone will say yes!
🎧 But people might think there's something wrong with our lemons and that we're desperate to get rid of them.
🎧 I see your point, but, if we explain this is just a special offer for special clients, they'll understand.
🎧 I like that idea. Good: 20% off for all regular clients just for this month. Anna, you'll be making the presentation to Citrus Ventures, so make sure you include that offer.
🎧 Uh-huh.
🎧 Yes.
🎧 Right, next, what photos do we have of the lemons...?
🎧 Finding the right words to disagree in meetings isn't always easy, but Anna managed in the end. She started sentences with this short word to show that she was about to disagree with what had just been said:
🎧 But...
🎧 And used these phrases:
🎧 I'm not so sure about that......
🎧 I see your point, but actually I think...
🎧 The next big challenge for Anna will be her presentation to Citrus Ventures. Join us again soon to find out what happens!
🎧 I've got to do a good job but it's going to take me ages. Ah well, I had better get started otherwise I'm going to be here all night!

[011 Overtime]

🎧 It's late at the offices of Tip Top Trading. Anna is alone, working. Again. She's been doing this all week, she wants her presentation to Mr Lime to be perfect so she's been spending hours and hours on it. Anna?
🎧 Don't interrupt! I'm busy.
🎧 Woah!
🎧 Sorry.
🎧 Anna, you're really burning the candle at both ends.
🎧 What?
🎧 Burning the candle at both ends – it means working very hard – working late and getting up early to work all the time.
🎧 Oh. I didn't know that expression.
🎧 Well here are some more:
🎧 You're doing overtime; which means you're working longer than office hours.
🎧 You're putting in the hours; which means you are spending all the time needed to achieve something.
🎧 Yes, I'm putting in the hours to make sure my presentation is perfect.
🎧 And if you don't mind me saying so, you might burn out; which means you are working so hard that you might get very tired and run out of energy.
🎧 I'm not burning out. I'm full of energy. I just need to finish this bit...
🎧 My goodness, nothing's locked. Do you think we've been burgled?
🎧 Oh no! I left my lap-book and my me-pad on the desk... and my i-top – they're worth thousands! They're all the latest versions!
🎧 I left out my elephant mug and my lady-curve nail file. They better not have stolen them!
🎧 (Talking in her sleep) but it's premium, premium, faux-orange premium!
🎧 Anna?
🎧 It's Anna, she's asleep. Anna!
🎧 (waking up with a jump) Oh! Lemons! Denise? Tom?
🎧 Have you spent the night asleep at your desk Anna?
🎧 Is it morning? Oh dear, yes I think so.
🎧 Well, at least we haven't been burgled then.
🎧 Tom, you've really been burning the candle at both ends lately.
🎧 Yes, you've been doing hours and hours of overtime. Most people get their work done within office hours and anyway, we don't pay overtime here. You’ll never find me working late!
🎧 Yes, I'd noticed that Denise.
🎧 But this presentation must be perfect.
🎧 If you're not careful, you'll burn out! Then you'll really be of no use to anyone. You'll be as useful as a chocolate teapot.
🎧 It's good that you're putting in the hours Anna, but you should calm down. Look at me, I do very successful presentations without spending hours preparing.
🎧 Ha!
🎧 In my presentation to Every Apple I just swooshed in with no preparation after a night on the town. I charmed them. They loved me!
🎧 Idiot. I bet he actually spent hours preparing he just can't admit it.
🎧 Well, maybe you're right. I can't think clearly anymore, I'm so tired. I need to sleep properly otherwise I'll end up trying to sell bananas instead of lemons.
🎧 Anna has finally got the message: she's realised she's been working too much. She needs to be realistic. Here's a reminder of some of the phrases we heard to talk about how much Anna had been working:
🎧 Burning the candle at both ends.
🎧 Doing overtime.
🎧 Putting in the hours.
🎧 Burning out.
🎧 Let's hope she's thinking clearly by the time she has to do her presentation. Join us next time to find out! Bye.

[012 The big day]

🎧 Hello, welcome to the offices of Citrus Ventures! It's a big day for Anna, she's about to present Tip Top Trading's new Imperial Lemon to Mr Lime and his colleagues. This must not go wrong.
🎧 …revoltionary laser-curve.... revolUtionary laser-curve... revol-
🎧 How are you feeling today Anna?
🎧 Scared! I want to do really well. If I mess up and Citrus Ventures doesn't place an order, I'll be so upset.
🎧 You're well prepared, that's the main thing. Explain clearly how your presentation will be organised.
🎧 OK. Oh dear, I didn't think of the very beginning. Can you give me examples of what I should say?
🎧 After you've introduced yourself, you could say:
🎧 Today I'm going to... and explain. Then say:
🎧 I'll start by...
🎧 And then I'm going to move on to discuss…
🎧 And finally...
🎧 OK, like this:
🎧 Today I'm going to...
🎧 I'll start by...
🎧 And then I'm going to move on to discuss…
🎧 And finally...
🎧 Exactly.
🎧 Right, thanks, I'll try. Everything will be fine. I feel relaxed now.
🎧 Anna!
🎧 Mr Lime!
🎧 How lovely to see you. You look absolutely... I've been looking forward to this for days! Everyone is waiting in the meeting room. Come this way....
🎧 Oh gosh.
🎧 Everyone in Citrus Ventures is very excited about this new Imperial Lemon, so I allowed a few extras to come and watch, I hope you don't mind. All your equipment has been set up so you can begin!
🎧 Hello, I'm Anna of Top Tip Trading… I mean, Tip Top Trading, sorry! I'm very unhappy to be here.
🎧 Anna- focus!
🎧 I mean, I'm very happy to be here.
🎧 Anna, breathe deeply, then say:
🎧 Today I'm going to...
🎧 Today I'm going to... Today I'm going to present our revolutionary, new Imperial Lemon. I'll start by telling you a bit about Tip Top Trading and some of the exciting new developments at our company. And then…I’m going to move on to explain how the Imperial Lemon is designed and what makes it so revolutionary. And finally, you will all have a chance to see it close up for yourselves and ask questions. So, let's begin. This picture shows...
🎧 Well, as usual, Anna seems to be turning a difficult situation into a success. She used the phrases we discussed, which made her opening clear and well-structured. She said:
🎧 Today I'm going to...
🎧 I'll start by...
🎧 And then I'm going to move on to discuss…
🎧 And finally...
🎧 But that's just the beginning, now she's got to get through the rest of the pitch – how will that go?
🎧 …this picture shows….oh no, why isn’t it working…I should just click on this….oh, what’s wrong with this stupid computer!
🎧 Uh oh! It was all going so well but now Anna’s got computer problems. What is she going to do? We'll find out next time. Bye!

[013 The Imperial Lemon]

🎧 Hello, welcome back to the offices of Citrus Ventures! Anna's presentation to Mr Lime and his colleagues continues... Well, almost! Her computer has jammed and the presentation, along with her notes, are frozen.
🎧 Oh no, this is terrible!
🎧 Anna, you're going to have to manage without the slideshow or notes. Just talk!
🎧 Just talk! Just talk! You just talk! What on earth am I going to say? My mind is blank.
🎧 Try to remember the key points you wanted to share, and give them one by one. If you can, give some facts that support each point. For example:
🎧 Tip Top Trading is growing fast – our number of clients doubled last year.
🎧 Use phrases like this:
🎧 The company has a strong track record of...
🎧 Let me share with you...
🎧 The Imperial Lemon's key strengths are...
🎧 OK. Ahem! Sorry about that, I'll just have to continue talking without the slideshow. So, ahem.... Tip Top Trading is growing fast – our number of clients doubled last year. This is because our company-
🎧 Yes, but try not to bark out information like a robot.
🎧 Look people in the eye, slow down and try to be more conversational….oh, and smile!
🎧 Tip Top Trading is growing fast – our number of clients doubled last year. This is because our company has a strong track record of reliability and because, thanks to new technology, our fruits are more and more convincing. Our bananas have won awards for being the most authentic-looking fruits in Europe. We are very happy that Citrus Ventures is already among our clients and we hope to build on that by offering you more exciting new fruits. Let me share with you our latest product: the Imperial Lemon.
🎧 The Imperial Lemon's key strengths are its design and flexibility. It is made with revolutionary faux-orange-premium, laser-curve-definition technology... 
🎧 What an excellent performance from Anna. She focussed on some key points, supported them with facts and structured her answer clearly. She also managed to relax and sound more natural. She used these phrases:
🎧 The company has a strong track record of...
🎧 Let me share with you..
🎧 The Imperial Lemon's key strengths are...
🎧 Let's fast-forward to after the meeting to see if she gets an order.
🎧 …so thank you for your time, I hope you're impressed with our Imperial Lemon.
🎧 Fantastic Anna, fantastic!
🎧 Thank you.
🎧 Those... lemons – wow. I'd like to put in an order for three hundred thousand right away.
🎧 Of course.
🎧 Now, what's your direct phone number?
🎧 Good work. Although, I must say, Mr Lime seems just as excited about Anna as he is about the lemons. Hmm....watch out Anna! Until next time!

[014 Telephone tell-tale]

🎧 Hello. We're back at Tip Top Trading. Anna is very busy dealing with Mr Lime's big order for Imperial Lemons.
🎧 Yes?... Who?... I can't hear you. Mr what? What? Mr Who? I don't know, you tell me. Oh, you are Mr Hu... H-U: Hu. Er... No, Tom's busy. Call back later. Bye. Tom, Mr Hu called you.
🎧 Mr Hu-
🎧 Mr Hu: H-U
🎧 Tom, Mr Hu is a very important-
🎧 Oh! What now?! Yes?
🎧 I'm going to have to talk to the boss about this.
🎧 No. I'm busy, give me your number, I'll call you later. Yep, yep, 6... 8... thanks. Bye! Right, now where was I?
🎧 Anna, could I have a word?
🎧 Yes. Ohhh, he must want to tell me how pleased he is with the Citrus Ventures deal.
🎧 Now, Anna... biscuit?
🎧 Thank you.
🎧 I'm a little bit concerned about something.
🎧 "I'm a little bit concerned..." Doesn't that mean something bad?
🎧 Yes, Anna, Paul is using a polite turn of phrase to say he is unhappy about something. Let's see what he's got to say....
🎧 I think you need to work on your telephone manner.
🎧 Work on my telephone manner?
🎧 It means the way you talk on the phone is not good enough and you have to improve it – to work on it to make it better.
🎧 Perhaps you should think about …
🎧 Perhaps you should think about – that's a polite way of telling you to do something!
🎧 Anna, are you listening to me?
🎧 Yes, sorry, I was just sort of, err, talking to myself. Could you repeat what you said please?
🎧 Right, I'll start again. I said: I'm a little bit concerned about your telephone manner. You need to work on the way you speak to clients. Perhaps you should think about being a bit more polite to clients; it's important for the image of the company.
🎧 Oh okay.
🎧 You can go now – take another biscuit with you – that's my last chocolate wafer, you lucky thing!
🎧 Anna? Is everything all right?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 What's the matter? says I need to w-w-w-work on my telephone manner.
🎧 Well I was a bit concerned about it myself. And I think Tom actually mentioned it to Paul.
🎧 But, look, I'll help you if you like. I'm a bit of an expert on the phone. I'll give you some lessons.
🎧 Oh thank you.
🎧 Come in early tomorrow morning, before the others get here and we'll practise.
🎧 Thank you Denise, that's very kind.
🎧 Wow! Denise is actually being nice to Anna. Amazing! Although from what I've heard of Denise on the phone, she's only ever gossiping with friends. Paul was very gentle and polite in the way he explained to Anna there was a problem and that she needed to improve some things. He used these phrases:
🎧 I'm a little bit concerned about...
🎧 You need to work on...
🎧 Perhaps you should think about...
🎧 Let's see if Denise manages to teach Anna anything useful next time. Until then!

[015 Seb Lime]

🎧 (answering the phone) Yes?
🎧 Stop! That's all wrong. I'm going to call you again. This time…
🎧 Hello. Here we are in the middle of a telephone training session with Denise and Anna. What fun!
🎧 …this time, you don't say 'yes' when you answer, it's rude. Call me and I'll show you how it's done.
🎧 (sound of 4-digit dialling, then phone rings)
🎧 Hello? Tip Top Trading.
🎧 Wow, that’s good.
🎧 And, you can say your name. Hello? Tip Top Trading. Denise speaking. Try it.
🎧 (dialling, then ring)
🎧 Hello? Tip Top Trading. Denise speaking.
🎧 No!
🎧 What?
🎧 Say: "Anna speaking!"
🎧 Oh, sorry, I'm so stressed by all this. Hello Anna speaking.
🎧 You sound like you're sitting on a pineapple. Listen to my voice: Hello? Denise speaking.
🎧 Hello? Anna speaking.
🎧 Good. Now, when the person has introduced themself – this is Mrs Smith or whatever, say: Hello Mrs Smith, how can I help you? Or, if you know them already, you might say: Hello Mrs Smith, how are you?
🎧 Okay, what if Mrs Smith wants to speak to Tom but he's not there?
🎧 You say: "I'm really sorry, he's not available at the moment. Can I take a message?" Or: "I'm afraid he's busy, shall I ask him to call you back?"
🎧 Okay.
🎧 And, to end a conversation, you can say: "Thank you for calling, goodbye." Let's do another practice!
🎧 (phone rings)
🎧 Hello? Tip Top Trading.
🎧 Hello, this is Mrs Smith.
🎧 Hello Mrs Smith, how can I help you?
🎧 I'd like to speak to Tom please.
🎧 I'm really sorry, he's not available at the moment. Can I take a message?
🎧 That's okay, I'll try again later.
🎧 Okay. Thank you for calling, goodbye.
🎧 Excellent!
🎧 (phone rings)
🎧 Oh!
🎧 How did you call me without dialling?
🎧 I didn't, that's a real call!
🎧 Oh no, I'm all nervous now. Hello? Tip Top Trading. This is Anna speaking.
🎧 Hello Anna, this is Seb Lime.
🎧 Sublime?
🎧 Mr Lime from Citrus Ventures. But I think we should be on first name terms now, so call me Seb.
🎧 Okay, er, Seb. How can I help you?
🎧 I just wanted to say again that your Imperial Lemon is fantastic... and I was wondering if you'd like to do lunch with me sometime?
🎧 Lunch? Er...
🎧 I knew it! Mr Lime is interested in more than just your lemons!
🎧 Would you like to discuss the Imperial Lemon?
🎧 Forget the lemons Anna! The reason I want to see you is more of a personal nature.
🎧 Personnel? Er... Can I call you back? I'm afraid I'm a bit busy at the moment...
🎧 …bbbut…
🎧 Well Anna! Mr Lime eh?
🎧 Oh dear Denise, I think I need a bit more help from you. He wants to talk about personnel…people, staffing…
🎧 Are you sure? I think he means a personal nature, not personnel! That Mr Lime!
🎧 Oh!
🎧 Mr Lime indeed. Anyway, Anna had an excellent phone manner. Let's hear those phrases again:
🎧 Hello? Tip Top Trading. This is Anna speaking.
🎧 Hello? Anna speaking.
🎧 Hello Mrs Smith, how can I help you?
🎧 Hello Mrs Smith, how are you?
🎧 I'm really sorry, he's not available at the moment. Can I take a message?
🎧 I'm afraid he's busy – shall I ask him to call you back?
🎧 Thank you for calling, goodbye.
🎧 But how is Anna going to handle Mr Lime's request? I can't wait till next time! Bye!
