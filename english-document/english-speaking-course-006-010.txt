Making a Reservation

🎧 Good evening! Fancy Dining.
🎧 How can I help you?
🎧 Hi! I would like to make a reservation for dinner.
🎧 Great! May I know how many people?
🎧 Well, that will be just me and my hunger. So... just one, please.
🎧 A table for one? Wow, what a bold move!
🎧 What time would you and your hunger like to come?
🎧 We would probably show up at 7 pm. I'll be fashionably early.
🎧 Unfortunately, Sir, our restaurant is fully booked at 7 pm.
🎧 Would you mind coming a bit later, like 8 pm?
🎧 I guess I have no choice. Fine, 8 pm it is!
🎧 So, a table for you and your hunger at 8 pm!
🎧 Do you have any special requests?
🎧 Yes. Can I sit by the window?
🎧 I need good lighting for my food selfies.
🎧 Of course! We'll make sure your food shines as bright as you do.
🎧 Perfect. Should I dress fancy, or can I rock my pyjamas?
🎧 We're all about style, but maybe save the pyjamas for Netflix.
🎧 Wise words! That will be well noted.
🎧 Well, thank you, see you at 8!
🎧 You're welcome, Sir! Looking forward to it!
🎧 Good evening! Welcome to Gourmet Delights.
🎧 Do you have a reservation?
🎧 Hi! No, we're just walk-ins. Is that okay?
🎧 Walk-ins? You're living dangerously, I like it.
🎧 Let me see... Ah, you're in luck.
🎧 I can get you a table right away.
🎧 Perfect! I hope the food comes as fast as the table.
🎧 Well, our chef moves fast, but don't expect magic.
🎧 Follow me, please.
🎧 Ooh, a table by the window! Isn't it great?
🎧 Yes, it's great for watching people's heads while we eat!
🎧 Well, people-watching is a part of fine dining, isn't it?
🎧 Here are your menus!
🎧 Thanks!
🎧 Honey, be careful, please try not to spill anything on it this time.
🎧 It's not like I have a glass of wine in my hand right now!
🎧 Oh, please don't!
🎧 I think our menus have had enough wine for today.
🎧 They're a bit tipsy already, in fact!
🎧 Well, if so, I'd be more careful!
🎧 Hi there! I'll be your server tonight.
🎧 Can I start you off with some drinks?
🎧 Actually, I'm clueless.
🎧 What do you recommend for someone who is bad at making decisions?
🎧 I'd say the pasta.
🎧 It's delicious, and you can't go wrong with carbs.
🎧 That sounds great, but what if I regret it halfway?
🎧 You won't. But if you do, we'll just bring more bread.
🎧 Sold! Pasta it is.
🎧 But wait, what about dessert?
🎧 Oh, we have an amazing chocolate cake.
🎧 It's like a hug, but from inside your stomach.
🎧 That's exactly what I need after this long day.
🎧 You're a lifesaver.
🎧 Just doing my part to keep the world happy.
🎧 One slice of cake at a time.
🎧 So one garden salad, one grilled salmon and a bottle of sparkling water.
🎧 Is everything correct?
🎧 Yes, everything is correct.
🎧 Great! Your order will be ready in 15 minutes!
🎧 Oh, hold on!
🎧 What's the matter, Ma'am?
🎧 Well, I'm so sorry, but can I change my order?
🎧 Sure! What would you like to change?
🎧 I want some fries instead of that garden salad!
🎧 And a Coke instead of sparkling water...
🎧 Alright.
🎧 In fact, can I switch to the burger?
🎧 I'm suddenly craving something less... green.
🎧 Of course, you can!
🎧 A burger is a salad's cooler, tastier cousin.
🎧 Yeah, you're right!
🎧 I'll make sure your burger comes out as quickly as your stomach changes its mind.
🎧 Thank you so much!
🎧 How was everything tonight?
🎧 I see you've left nothing but crumbs!
🎧 Honestly, I think I just fell in love... with your chef.
🎧 I'll let him know. He loves fan mail.
🎧 Seriously, that steak was so good, that I almost wrote it a love letter.
🎧 Do you take requests? Can I meet the chef?
🎧 We want to personally thank the magician behind the magic.
🎧 I can arrange that.
🎧 But fair warning, if you shower him with too many compliments,
🎧 he might make you eat the whole menu!
🎧 Actually, I don't mind that at all...
🎧 But we'd need quite a lot of digestive pills for that!
🎧 You're too kind.
🎧 I'll tell him to prepare for his standing ovation.
🎧 And give him our deepest compliments.
🎧 This meal was unforgettable.
🎧 I will.
🎧 And next time, I'll let him know he has fans waiting.
🎧 We'll even put up a red carpet.
🎧 Perfect. We'll bring the applause!
🎧 Hello! Thank you for calling Seaside Hotel.
🎧 How can I help you?
🎧 Hi, I would like to book a room for the weekend.
🎧 Do you have anything available?
🎧 Let me check.
🎧 Yes, we have a few rooms left.
🎧 May I know your name, Sir?
🎧 I'm Ian Brown.
🎧 So, Mr. Brown, do you prefer a single or double room?
🎧 I'll go with a double. You know, in case I roll around too much at night.
🎧 All right, a double it is.
🎧 How many nights would you like to stay at our hotel?
🎧 Just two. Friday and Saturday.
🎧 Great! Do you have any special requests?
🎧 Uh, yeah, actually... Can I get extra pillows?
🎧 Like, five of them. I mean... I just really love pillows.
🎧 I'll make a note.
🎧 Your pillow kingdom will be ready.
🎧 Perfect! Do I need to pay now?
🎧 No, you can pay when you check in.
🎧 We'll have your room ready when you arrive.
🎧 Awesome. I can't wait to dive into those pillows.
🎧 You're all set. See you on Friday!
🎧 Good afternoon! Welcome to the Grand Hotel.
🎧 Do you have a reservation?
🎧 Yes, I do. It's under Mia Thompson.
🎧 Let me check… Ah, here you are!
🎧 Mrs. Thompson, are you staying for two nights?
🎧 Yep! Just so you know, I'm here for a “do-nothing” weekend.
🎧 That sounds like a solid plan.
🎧 Here's your room key.
🎧 Room 305. It's on the third floor.
🎧 Is there an elevator?
🎧 Or do I need to start my “do-nothing” weekend by taking the stairs?
🎧 Yes. Mrs. Thompson, we have an elevator, so no need for a stair workout.
🎧 Oh, that's such a relief.
🎧 I didn't bring my workout clothes anyway.
🎧 Just the “do-nothing” clothes, right?
🎧 Exactly! Thanks for your understanding.
🎧 Enjoy your stay!
🎧 And if you need help doing nothing, just let us know.
🎧 Certainly! I'll keep that in mind.
🎧 The elevator is over there, Ma'am!
🎧 Oh, right! How did I miss that?
🎧 I think my brain's already doing nothing!
🎧 Sounds like you're on the right track for a complete rest.
🎧 Hello, I'd like to order room service, please.
🎧 Sure! What can I get for you today?
🎧 I'm feeling fancy.
🎧 Do you have anything... five stars? Some Michelin choices?
🎧 Well, we have a sandwich with five slices of bread.
🎧 Does that count?
🎧 Hmm, that's… creative. Do you have a steak?
🎧 Yes, we do! Medium, rare, or… very well done, as in “crispy”?
🎧 Medium, please.
🎧 And maybe some fries.
🎧 Absolutely! A steak without some crispy fries is like day without night!
🎧 Exactly. And for dessert?
🎧 We have chocolate cake, or if you're feeling adventurous, a mystery dessert.
🎧 Mystery dessert?
🎧 Yep. It could be chocolate cake... or something we found in the fridge.
🎧 I'll just take the cake, thanks.
🎧 Good choice. We'll send everything up shortly!
🎧 Please, no surprises, okay?
🎧 Only good ones. Promise!
🎧 Oh, how lucky! Hi, Miss!
🎧 Good morning, Ma'am! How may I help you?
🎧 Can I request some extra towels, please?
🎧 Of course. How many would you like?
🎧 Uh... ten?
🎧 Ten towels? Are you planning a pool party in your room?
🎧 No, just... well, you never know. I mean, I have two teenage daughters with me...
🎧 Better safe than sorry, right?
🎧 I'll send ten towels your way.
🎧 Anything else?
🎧 Actually, do you happen to have some extra pillows?
🎧 Sure, how many pillows? Don't tell me, ten?
🎧 No, just two, please. I don't need to build a pillow fort... yet.
🎧 Good plan.
🎧 Is there anything else that you need? Snacks? A pet elephant?
🎧 Hmm, an elephant might be too big for the room.
🎧 But maybe some extra shampoo?
🎧 Shampoo, got it! I'll send the towels, pillows, and shampoo up right away.
🎧 Thanks! And maybe I'll save the elephant for next time.
🎧 We'll be ready for it!
🎧 Good evening! How can I help you?
🎧 Oh, hi! I'm staying in room 412,
🎧 and... I think there are some uninvited guests in my room...
🎧 Oh my! What do you mean by "uninvited guests?"
🎧 Is somebody trying to get inside your room?
🎧 Well, I'm not sure... But there's a strange noise coming from the bathroom.
🎧 A strange noise? Like… singing?
🎧 No, more like a dripping tap mixed with a haunted house...
🎧 Ah, the classic “ghost with plumbing problems.”
🎧 We'll send someone to fix that. Anything else?
🎧 The window won't open. I tried everything.
🎧 Well, our windows are on strike.
🎧 They refuse to work unless treated nicely.
🎧 Funny, but I really need some fresh air.
🎧 No problem, we'll take care of that. Anything else?
🎧 The bed... it's a bit lumpy.
🎧 I feel like I'm lying on Mount Everest here.
🎧 Got it. We'll bring you a flatter one. Anything else?
🎧 No, that covers it.
🎧 Just fix my haunted tap, please!
🎧 On it! Hopefully, no ghosts involved.
🎧 Good evening! How can I assist you?
🎧 Hi! I need a wake-up call for tomorrow morning.
🎧 I've got an early flight.
🎧 What time would you like the wake-up call?
🎧 Ugh, 5 am... Is that even a real time?
🎧 Unfortunately, yes. We can call you at 5 am, though.
🎧 Please do! I'm not great at waking up, so I'll need all the help I can get.
🎧 We'll make sure you get up bright and early.
🎧 Well, whether you like it or not.
🎧 Exactly what I need!
🎧 Thanks for the assist.
🎧 No problem. We'll be your morning alarm clock.
🎧 Let's just hope I don't hit the snooze button on you.
🎧 Luckily, there's no snooze button here, so you're safe.
🎧 Have a good night, Sarah.
🎧 Thanks again!
🎧 Good afternoon!
🎧 How can I help you today?
🎧 Hi! I need laundry service.
🎧 My suitcase exploded and I've got nothing clean left.
🎧 I see! We can help with that. What do you need washed?
🎧 Pretty much everything in my suitcase.
🎧 Is that okay?
🎧 Absolutely! Just leave it in the bag, and we'll take care of it.
🎧 Great!
🎧 Oh, and please don't judge my crazy sock collection.
🎧 Certainly, no judgment! We'll wash them without a second thought.
🎧 Thanks!
🎧 Just so you know, I can't survive without my lucky socks.
🎧 Of course, lucky socks are important!
🎧 We'll have everything ready for you by tomorrow.
🎧 You guys are lifesavers.
🎧 I was about to accept the fate of my dirty clothes.
🎧 We'll save you from that fate.
🎧 Good morning, Sam! Time to wake up!
🎧 Do I have to? My bed is calling my name.
🎧 It's 7 am, not a phone call. Up you get!
🎧 but I'm not a morning person. I'm more of a sleep until lunch person.
🎧 Well, you can't sleep all day.
🎧 We've got breakfast. Pancakes!
🎧 Pancakes? Now you're speaking my language.
🎧 See? It's not so bad.
🎧 Get up and get dressed. Breakfast won't wait.
🎧 Fine, but I'm still in bed mentally.
🎧 My body is just catching up.
🎧 Just try to make it to the table before the pancakes are gone.
🎧 No promises. I might need a wake-up call.
🎧 Here's your call.
🎧 Get up
🎧 or you'll be eating cold pancakes! Or maybe AIR PANCAKES!
🎧 Okay, okay. I'm moving.
🎧 Pancakes are my motivation.
🎧 I mean, the real and hot ones.
🎧 Good choice. Now, brush your teeth.
🎧 Deal. I'll be there in five minutes...
🎧 if I don't get lost on the way.
🎧 Dad, can I have a new backpack for school?
🎧 Why? Is your old one broken?
🎧 No, but it's not sparkly enough. I need sparkle power!
🎧 Sparkle power? Is that a thing now?
🎧 Totally! If my backpack doesn't sparkle, I can't be the coolest kid in class.
🎧 Well, if we get you a sparkly backpack,
🎧 can you promise to actually use it for school and not just as a fashion statement?
🎧 I promise.
🎧 Plus, I'll help you with the groceries.
🎧 Ah, a deal. And if you forget to help, we're keeping the sparkles to ourselves.
🎧 Deal! Let's go get sparkles.
🎧 And don't worry, Dad, I'll carry all the groceries and the sparkles.
🎧 Good.
🎧 And remember, no sparkles in the living room.
🎧 We don't need extra glitter on the couch.
🎧 Got it! Sparkles only in the classroom, I swear.
🎧 And no extra sparkle on the homework. That's still a big no!
🎧 Okay, okay. Sparkles for school, homework for brains.
🎧 Can I play on the swings? Mom? Dad?
🎧 Sure thing! But remember, no flying too high.
🎧 Your mom is right.
🎧 I'm not ready for a space mission.
🎧 Don't worry, I won't fly to the moon.
🎧 Just a bit higher than the slides.
🎧 Let's swing, but if we see a UFO, I'm taking cover!
🎧 Dad, if we see a UFO, I'm asking them for a ride. I want to see Mars!
🎧 And what if they bring you back with alien homework?
🎧 Alien homework?
🎧 I'll do it on the spaceship.
🎧 It'll be out of this world!
🎧 Well, if that happens, tell them we're busy with park swings first.
🎧 And make sure they don't take the dog. He's already got his own plans!
🎧 Got it! No aliens, no taking the dog!
🎧 Just swings and fun!
🎧 Finally, it's family movie night! What should we watch?
🎧 Can we watch the new superhero movie?
🎧 Again? Didn't we just watch it last week?
🎧 It will never be enough! How can you say no to superpowers?
🎧 How about a comedy?
🎧 I could use a laugh.
🎧 Comedies are good. But superheroes are… super!
🎧 Okay, how about both? Let's watch a superhero comedy?
🎧 Superhero comedy?
🎧 Now, that sounds amazing.
🎧 Deal. As long as it makes me laugh!
🎧 I promise it'll be fun. And popcorn is ready!
🎧 Good! A movie night would not be complete without popcorn!
🎧 Popcorn is life. Just make sure it doesn't end up all over the couch.
🎧 We'll do our best.
🎧 Let's get started.
🎧 Superhero comedy and popcorn.
🎧 Best combination.
🎧 This is going to be epic.
🎧 Remember, no fighting over the remote!
🎧 Or the popcorn!
🎧 Ugh, homework. Why do I feel it is never-ending?!
🎧 I know, right? I'm buried in math problems.
🎧 Just think of it as a puzzle.
🎧 The more you solve, the easier it gets.
🎧 I'm not a fan of puzzles, Dad.
🎧 I'd rather play video games.
🎧 Me, too.
🎧 But I have to get this done so I can play later.
🎧 You'll thank yourself later when you have all your work finished.
🎧 Yeah, yeah, I know, Dad.
🎧 I'm trying my best to finish this grammar exercise.
🎧 Why do I have to learn French?
🎧 Stop complaining and try to finish it up
🎧 Once you're done, I will let you have more screen time.
🎧 Deal! But if I don't finish, can I have an extra hour of playtime?
🎧 Nice try. Just get it done.
🎧 It'll be over before you know it.
🎧 Hopefully! Homework, here I come.
🎧 Alright sons, it's cleaning day! Please try your best, okay?
🎧 Can we just pretend the house is clean?
🎧 Yeah, like a magic spell.
🎧 Poof! All clean.
🎧 Nice try, but we need to actually clean!
🎧 Let's make it fun. Whoever cleans the most gets ice cream!
🎧 Ice cream?! How old do you think I am?!
🎧 Well, that sounds awesome to me.
🎧 I'm on it.
🎧 I'm cleaning the attic.
🎧 Are you sure you don't want ice cream, Nate?
🎧 Well... I guess some ice cream doesn't hurt...
🎧 Great enthusiasm! Just remember to dust off those old toys.
🎧 Old toys? I haven't seen those in ages.
🎧 I bet they are dinosaurs up there.
🎧 They've been hiding.
🎧 Dinosaurs or not, let's get this done.
🎧 We'll have the cleanest house in town.
🎧 And the biggest ice cream sundaes.
🎧 Wish I had some magic brooms...
🎧 Time to go grocery shopping.
🎧 Get your bags.
🎧 Do we have to?
🎧 Can't we just order pizza?
🎧 No.
🎧 We need food for the week.
🎧 I'll help pick out the cereal. I'm an expert!
🎧 And I'll choose the snacks. I'm also an expert.
🎧 Just don't make the cart a snack monster.
🎧 Promise! But can we get some cookies?
🎧 Cookies are a must. They should be in every cart.
🎧 Cookies, yes. But let's not forget the veggies.
🎧 Veggies are boring.
🎧 Can we get extra cookies instead?
🎧 We need balance. Healthy food and cookies.
🎧 Fine. I'll sneak in some extra snacks.
🎧 As long as you help me find the milk.
🎧 Deal.
🎧 And make sure we get the best cereal!
🎧 You can count on us, Mom!
🎧 Alright, everyone, let's go for our evening walk!
🎧 I'm ready! I've got my sneakers on.
🎧 Do I have to?
🎧 I have an important game to win… in my video game.
🎧 Oh. Come on.
🎧 It's just a walk.
🎧 Besides, your video game will still be there when we get back.
🎧 I'm not sure. What if I miss a level?
🎧 You'll be fine.
🎧 The only level you're miss here is the level of fitness.
🎧 Fitness?
🎧 I didn't sign up for a gym membership.
🎧 It's not a gym.
🎧 It's a walk with your Mom and Dad!
🎧 How come you don't want to have a walk with us, Dave?!
🎧 Don't make your Mom sad, Dave!
🎧 Think of it as a break from the screen.
🎧 Okay, okay, I got it!
🎧 I bet it will be great!
🎧 Let's see...
🎧 All right, that's it for tonight! Time to close your eyes!
🎧 But Dad, I'm not tired yet. Can you just read one more chapter?
🎧 You know, if you stay up too late, you'll turn into a zombie.
🎧 I don't think I want to be a zombie.
🎧 Do zombies get extra sleep?
🎧 I don't think they even sleep.
🎧 They probably just wander around.
🎧 Urgh... If so, I wouldn't want to become a zombie!
🎧 Of course, honey!
🎧 You won't become a zombie as long as you go to sleep right away.
🎧 But Dad, this book is so interesting!
🎧 I want to know what will happen next.
🎧 Can we just save it for tomorrow?
🎧 I don't think I can sleep in peace tonight without knowing the princess's fate!
🎧 All right, but just one chapter. Then it's lights out.
🎧 Thank you, Dad!

What did you do last weekend?

🎧 Hey Liam! What a surprise to see you here!
🎧 Hey Sarah! Same here.
🎧 What are you up to?
🎧 Oh, you know, just grabbing an iced latte.
🎧 It's so hot out!
🎧 What did you do last week?
🎧 I feel like I haven't seen you in forever.
🎧 Yeah, it's been crazy busy.
🎧 I was working on a big project all week,
🎧 but I finally finished it yesterday.
🎧 What about you?
🎧 Did you do anything fun?
🎧 Working on a project sounds intense!
🎧 Glad you finished.
🎧 For me, last week was pretty chill.
🎧 I spent most of the time reading that book you recommended.
🎧 Remember?
🎧 The one about the surfing competition?
🎧 Oh yeah, right!
🎧 "Waves of Courage"
🎧 Did you like it?
🎧 Loved it! Made me want to learn how to surf, actually.
🎧 Maybe we could check out some lessons sometime.
🎧 Mind if I sit here?
🎧 Not at all.
🎧 Hey Maya, how was your day?
🎧 It was good, thanks for asking!
🎧 Relaxing mostly.
🎧 What about you?
🎧 Did you do anything fun?
🎧 Actually, yeah! I went hiking with some friends on Saturday.
🎧 It was a beautiful trail, with a great view at the top.
🎧 Sounds awesome! Do you have any hobbies like that?
🎧 Hiking, I mean.
🎧 Hiking's definitely one of them.
🎧 I also love reading, and going to the movies.
🎧 What about you?
🎧 Anything you like to do in your free time?
🎧 Hmm, reading sounds nice.
🎧 I haven't had much time for that lately.
🎧 But I do love to bake!
🎧 Like cookies, cakes, all sorts of things.
🎧 It's relaxing for me.
🎧 Maybe you could bake us some cookies sometime?
🎧 I'd be happy to be your taste tester.
🎧 Sure, maybe! We could even try a new recipe together sometime.
🎧 Daniel, what's for lunch today?
🎧 Just a sandwich and some fruit.
🎧 Healthy stuff, you know?
🎧 What about you?
🎧 Same here, boring salad.
🎧 Ugh, I wish I had something more exciting.
🎧 Well, you can always have some of my sandwich.
🎧 It's ham and cheese, pretty classic.
🎧 Thanks, but I'm good.
🎧 Speaking of exciting food, what's your favorite food?
🎧 If you could eat anything right now, what would it be?
🎧 Oh, that's a tough one.
🎧 Maybe some spicy noodles from that new place downtown?
🎧 They're incredible.
🎧 Spicy noodles? Sounds interesting.
🎧 I haven't tried them yet.
🎧 Do they have anything vegetarian?
🎧 For sure! They have lots of options. We should go try it together sometime.
🎧 Maybe next weekend?
🎧 I'm always up for trying new food.
🎧 Wow, this place is beautiful.
🎧 It looks like a postcard.
🎧 Right? I'm glad you like it.
🎧 This is Capri, a famous island near Naples.
🎧 Amazing! So, where do you like to travel the most?
🎧 Beach places like this, or somewhere else?
🎧 I love beaches for relaxing, for sure.
🎧 But I also enjoy cities with a lot of history, like Rome or London.
🎧 There's always something new to learn.
🎧 Me too! Last summer, I went to Prague.
🎧 The buildings were incredible, especially the old castle.
🎧 Prague sounds amazing.
🎧 Maybe someday we can travel together.
🎧 We could find a place with both beaches and history.
🎧 Now that's an idea!
🎧 Greece maybe? They have beautiful islands and amazing ruins too.
🎧 We could even learn a few basic Greek phrases before we go.
🎧 Deal! This trip is already giving me ideas for the next one.
🎧 Wow, that's an amazing throw!
🎧 Your dog is super fast.
🎧 Thanks! This is Charlie. He loves to play fetch.
🎧 What about your cute dog?
🎧 This is Max. He likes to sniff around for squirrels, but he loves to play too.
🎧 Do you have any other pets besides Charlie?
🎧 Nope, Charlie's my only pet.
🎧 What about you? Any other pets at home?
🎧 Actually, I have an old cat named Mittens.
🎧 He mostly tolerates Max, but he would never chase a frisbee!
🎧 Cats are always so dignified.
🎧 Maybe Mittens would like a nap in the sun while we play fetch?
🎧 Probably a good idea.
🎧 Listen, it was nice meeting you and Charlie.
🎧 Hey Ethan! Small world, seeing you here.
🎧 Hey Ava! Yeah, crazy coincidence.
🎧 Just grabbing a coffee before my next class. What about you?
🎧 Same here.
🎧 Studying for that literature test tomorrow?
🎧 Those poems are confusing!
🎧 You can say that again.
🎧 You can say that again. But I did find "Ode to a Nightingale" kind of beautiful.
🎧 Nature and all that.
🎧 Interesting! What is your favorite movie?
🎧 Sometimes movies can explain things books can't.
🎧 Hmm, that's a tough one.
🎧 Maybe "Spirited Away"?
🎧 It's an animated movie, but the story about growing up is amazing.
🎧 Have you seen it?
🎧 Actually, no! But it sounds interesting.
🎧 Would you want to watch it with me sometime?
🎧 I'd love that.
🎧 We could grab coffee and popcorn, make a whole night of it.
🎧 Excuse me, is this seat taken?
🎧 Oh, no, not at all! Please, take a seat.
🎧 Thanks. Busy day?
🎧 Just finishing up some work for class. You?
🎧 Same here. Heading to a lecture on ancient Egypt.
🎧 I love history.
🎧 Cool!
🎧 I just finished reading a book about Cleopatra.
🎧 She was really interesting.
🎧 Do you enjoy reading books often?
🎧 Not many people I know do these days.
🎧 Absolutely! There's just something about getting lost in a good story.
🎧 What about you?
🎧 Any favorite genres?
🎧 Hmm, I do like a good mystery novel every now and then.
🎧 Something to keep me guessing.
🎧 Mysteries are fun!
🎧 Maybe we could swap recommendations sometime?
🎧 I'd like that!
🎧 Oh, no. I'm so sorry!
🎧 Let me help you pick those up.
🎧 No worries, it happens! Thanks for the help.
🎧 Wow, Led Zeppelin?
🎧 Those guys are legends.
🎧 You a big fan?
🎧 Absolutely!
🎧 "Stairway to Heaven" is one of my favorite songs.
🎧 What about you?
🎧 What kind of music do you like?
🎧 Mostly electronic music.
🎧 Anything with a good beat.
🎧 This new remix album by DJ Kai is great.
🎧 Have you heard it?
🎧 Hmm, not yet. I usually stick to classic rock and some indie stuff.
🎧 Maybe we could trade some suggestions sometime?
🎧 I could introduce you to some electronic music that might surprise you.
🎧 OK! Maybe we can grab coffee sometime and swap playlists?
🎧 Sounds like a deal! By the way, I'm Paule. And you are?
🎧 I'm Jennie. Nice to meet you, Paule.
🎧 Phew, that grammar explanation was confusing!
🎧 Tell me about it.
🎧 Past perfect continuous tense?
🎧 Sounds like a tongue twister.
🎧 Right? At least the upcoming activity looks fun.
🎧 True, writing a fake movie review.
🎧 I wonder what kind of movie we can choose.
🎧 Hmm, maybe something spooky?
🎧 Haunted house comedy?
🎧 Sounds interesting, but I wouldn't mind doing something with more action.
🎧 Like a superhero movie.
🎧 Oh, I'm not a huge fan of superhero movies.
🎧 They all seem kind of the same.
🎧 Fair enough. What do you like to watch in your free time?
🎧 Maybe we can get some inspiration.
🎧 I mostly watch documentaries or historical dramas.
🎧 Learning about different cultures and time periods is fascinating.
🎧 Documentaries, huh?
🎧 Not really my thing, but I can see the appeal.
🎧 What do you do in your free time besides watching movies?
🎧 Well, I enjoy reading and going for walks.
🎧 Sometimes I even try to write short stories myself.
🎧 Wow, that's cool! Writing can be tough.
🎧 Maybe you can share one of your stories with me sometime.
🎧 Maybe! But first, let's focus on this crazy grammar activity.
🎧 Agreed.
🎧 Finally! That history lecture felt like forever.
🎧 Couldn't agree more!
🎧 What are you up to this afternoon, Joe?
🎧 Probably just chilling at home, catching up on some homework.
🎧 What about you? Any exciting plans?
🎧 Actually, yeah! I'm meeting some friends for a game of volleyball down at the beach.
🎧 Want to join?
🎧 Volleyball, huh? Sounds fun!
🎧 I used to play a bit in high school, but I'm not sure I'm exactly beach-ready.
🎧 Come on, don't be a scaredy-cat!
🎧 It's all about having fun, not winning a championship.
🎧 Besides, the sand is soft and the water's amazing if you get too hot.
🎧 Hmm, you make a good point.
🎧 Do you play any sports regularly, or is this just a casual thing?
🎧 I try to play volleyball whenever I can.
🎧 It's a great workout, and being outside is always nice.
🎧 Do you play any sports?
🎧 I used to play basketball a lot, but these days it's mostly just pick-up games with friends.
🎧 Maybe if you ever need someone on your volleyball team, I could give it a shot.
🎧 Consider it done! The more the merrier, right?
🎧 So, are you in for some beach fun or not?
🎧 Alright, you convinced me.
🎧 Perfect! See you down there in a bit, Joe!

Am I Too Old to Learn Something New?

🎧 Mr. Henry sits quietly in his small house in Toronto.
🎧 A photo of his son, Michael, is on the table.
🎧 Michael's face in the photo is smiling,
🎧 very different from the deep sadness in Mr. Henry's eyes.
🎧 Michael, I really don't know what to do now.
🎧 This place... everything reminds me of you.
🎧 Mr. Henry stands up and looks out the window.
🎧 Outside, it is lightly raining.
🎧 Maybe, it's time for me to find a more peaceful place.
🎧 A place where this pain can't follow me.
🎧 Mr. Henry sighs and looks at the house one last time before making his decision.
🎧 Mr. Henry chose a small, quiet town, hoping to find peace in his life.
🎧 This town looks peaceful.
🎧 I hope I can start a new life here.
🎧 However, he had trouble because he only spoke a little English.
🎧 Mr. Henry tried to talk to people, but it was hard.
🎧 His English was not very good and he felt alone.
🎧 Excue mi, whee i the gloerly stor?
🎧 I'm sorry. Can you say that again?
🎧 Grociry strere... food?
🎧 The resident tried to help
🎧 But it was clear that communication would be a big challenge for Mr. Henry.
🎧 However, an unexpected help knocks on Henry's door
🎧 Hello! My name is Emily. I live next door.
🎧 Hello.
🎧 I brought you some cookies.
🎧 I made them myself.
🎧 Thank you, but I don't like sweet...
🎧 Oh okay! Maybe you can try them....
🎧 Maybe.
🎧 Hi, Mr. Henry! You're early!
🎧 Yes...
🎧 I see you often in the garden.
🎧 Seems like you love trees and gardening!
🎧 Yes, I do.
🎧 The weather today is so weird.
🎧 It's making me feel grumpy.
🎧 Yes, it is.
🎧 Ouais. Today, it may rain.
🎧 Wow, is that French? You speak French?
🎧 Yes I do.
🎧 I'm from Canada.
🎧 That's amazing! I had no idea!
🎧 Maybe you can help me with my French?
🎧 I... I don't know. I busy...
🎧 Oh... okay. Tell me whenever you have free time
🎧 Here, money...
🎧 Thank you, sir. Have a nice day.
🎧 Excuse me, sir. Did you pay for those fruits?
🎧 Yes, I pay.
🎧 So may I see your receipt?
🎧 I pay... at cashir. Mony... already give.
🎧 I'm sorry, but if you don't pay, you can't take the fruits.
🎧 I... already pay... here
🎧 What's going on?
🎧 This man is trying to take fruits without paying!
🎧 Mr. Henry, Can you show them the receipt?
🎧 Yes. Here... receipt.
🎧 Oh, yes, I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, sir.
🎧 It's okay, Mr. Henry. It's just a misunderstanding.
🎧 Thank you, Emily.
🎧 No problem. Are you buying things to make dinner?
🎧 Yes. And you can join... Si vous voulez.
🎧 Of course! Happy to join!
🎧 Great. Come by around 6 PM.
🎧 I'll be there. Thank you for inviting me.
🎧 I hope you like the food.
🎧 It's a recipe from Canada.
🎧 It's delicious.
🎧 Thank you for making it.
🎧 Emily, I was thinking... since you're learning French,
🎧 maybe I can help you with it.
🎧 Really? That would be amazing!
🎧 Thank you, Mr. Henry!
🎧 And in return, can you help me with my English?
🎧 Of course! I'd be happy to help.
🎧 But, I'm worried. I'm too old to learn new things.
🎧 No, Mr. Henry, you're never too old to learn.
🎧 It's hard for me. My brain isn't as quick as it used to be.
🎧 That's okay.
🎧 We can go slowly.
🎧 It's about practice and patience.
🎧 You really think I can do it?
🎧 Absolutely!
🎧 You've already helped me so much.
🎧 It's my turn to help you.
🎧 Alright, Emily. Let's do this together.
🎧 Great! We'll start tomorrow. It'll be fun, I promise
🎧 Hi, Henry!
🎧 Hi Henry! I brought you a book. It's called "Learn English for Beginners."
🎧 Oh, thank you, Emily! That's very kind of you.
🎧 I have some tips that can help older adults learn English.
🎧 Would you like to hear them?
🎧 Yes, please! I need all the help!
🎧 First, don't worry about making mistakes.
🎧 It's normal and part of learning.
🎧 That's good to know.
🎧 I always feel a bit shy about speaking.
🎧 Practice speaking as much as you can.
🎧 You can talk to me or even yourself.
🎧 I'll try that. Any other tips?
🎧 Yes! Try to read every day.
🎧 Books, newspapers or even labels can help you learn new words.
🎧 I like reading.
🎧 That should be fun.
🎧 Also, listen to English radio or watch TV shows.
🎧 It helps you get used to the sound of the language.
🎧 I enjoy watching TV.
🎧 I'll start watching English shows.
🎧 Great. Flashcards can be helpful too.
🎧 You can write new words on them and review them often.
🎧 Flashcards? That sounds interesting.
🎧 I'll give it a try.
🎧 And don't forget to take breaks.
🎧 Learning a new language can be tiring, so it's important to rest.
🎧 That's good advice.
🎧 I don't want to get too tired.
🎧 Oh, and one more thing! You can listen to podcasts.
🎧 There's a great one called LEP - Learn English Podcast. It's really helpful.
🎧 Podcasts? That sounds good.
🎧 I'll definitely check out LEP - Learn English Podcast.
🎧 Also, try to set small, achievable goals.
🎧 For example, learn five new words a day.
🎧 Sound manageable.
🎧 Use apps for language learning.
🎧 Some are designed for beginners and can be very interactive.
🎧 I have a smartphone so I can try using apps.
🎧 Any recommendations?
🎧 Duolingo and Memrise are great for beginners. They make learning fun.
🎧 Right!
🎧 You're welcome!
🎧 And don't forget to review what you've learned regularly.
🎧 It helps to remember better.
🎧 Well, lots of things to do...
🎧 You know, sometimes I feel like my age is a barrier to learning new things.
🎧 Oh, Henry, age is never a limit for learning!
🎧 With the right method, anyone can learn at any age.
🎧 Really?
🎧 But I feel like younger people learn faster.
🎧 It's true that young people might pick up new things quickly,
🎧 but older learners have advantages too.
🎧 You have life experience and patience.
🎧 That's a good point.
🎧 Also, older learners often have better study habits.
🎧 You can set a regular schedule and stick to it.
🎧 Consistency is key.
🎧 I can definitely do that.
🎧 What else can help?
🎧 You can even find online communities to practice with others.
🎧 That's a great idea.
🎧 It's nice to know I'm not alone in this.
🎧 You're definitely not alone.
🎧 Many people of all ages are learning new things every day.
🎧 It's all about finding what works best for you.
🎧 I feel more confident now.
🎧 Maybe I can learn even more things besides English.
🎧 Of course, learning keeps our minds active and healthy.
🎧 It's never too late to start something new.
🎧 You're right.
🎧 I guess I've been holding myself back with negative thoughts and doubts.
🎧 It's normal to have doubts.
🎧 But don't let them stop you.
🎧 Believe in yourself and keep going.

How Can I Learn English By Myself?

🎧 It's okay, Lily. You've done this before.
🎧 It's just a new school. Just smile and be friendly.
🎧 Maybe… maybe they won't notice that your English isn't that good.
🎧 Oh, sorry! Are you okay?
🎧 Uh… yes… I… I'm okay. Sorry.
🎧 That was so stupid.
🎧 I couldn't even say a full sentence without messing up.
🎧 How am I going to survive here?
🎧 Good morning, Lily! Welcome to your new school.
🎧 Good morning, Ms.
🎧 I'm sure you're feeling a bit nervous,
🎧 but don't worry, we're all very happy to have you here.
🎧 Are you ready to meet your new classmates?
🎧 Um… yes… I think so.
🎧 That's the spirit! Just be yourself, and you'll do great.
🎧 Let's go meet your teacher.
🎧 Good morning, Principal.
🎧 And you must be Lily!
🎧 We've been looking forward to meeting you.
🎧 Everyone, this is Lily.
🎧 She's new to our school, so please make her feel welcome.
🎧 Lily, would you like to introduce yourself to the class?
🎧 Um… My name is Lily… and…
🎧 I just moved here because of… my parents' work.
🎧 Thank you, Lily.
🎧 It's not easy being a new student,
🎧 but I'm sure you'll make friends in no time.
🎧 Just find a seat, eat quickly, and don't talk to anyone…
🎧 Maybe they won't notice you.
🎧 Hey, new girl! You dropped something!
🎧 I-I'm sorry… I didn't mean to…
🎧 Nice one! Maybe next time, use your hands properly!
🎧 Oh my god, she can't even handle her lunch. How clumsy!
🎧 Tell them you can do it.
🎧 What should I say?
🎧 Something like...
🎧 I can't do this… I just want to go home…
🎧 Hey, don't worry about them. Let me help you.
🎧 Thank you...
🎧 It's okay. We've all had embarrassing moments.
🎧 Trust me, I've been there too.
🎧 I'm Sharon, by the way.
🎧 I've seen you around, but I guess we haven't had a chance to talk yet.
🎧 I'm Lily. I… just moved here.
🎧 Yeah, I figured
🎧 Moving to a new school is tough.
🎧 I moved here last year, and it was really hard at first.
🎧 Especially with all the new faces and, well… the language.
🎧 My English… it's not good.
🎧 I get so scared to talk… and then… this happens.
🎧 You're doing fine, Lily.
🎧 English is hard, but you're here and you're trying.
🎧 That's what matters.
🎧 And trust me, it gets better.
🎧 Is it?
🎧 Sure.
🎧 And one more thing, it's not your fault.
🎧 They're just bullying you with words.
🎧 But everyone was laughing… They must think I'm so stupid.
🎧 Even if they are such rude ones, who cares?
🎧 You're here to learn, not to impress everyone.
🎧 And besides, I think you're brave for even trying.
🎧 When I first got here, I was too scared to even speak up in class.
🎧 You were?
🎧 Absolutely. I messed up so many times.
🎧 But I learned that the only way to get better is to keep trying.
🎧 No matter how embarrassing it gets.
🎧 Anyway, if you practice more,
🎧 you'll have the confidence to speak up for yourself in such situations.
🎧 You're not alone. I'll help you, okay?
🎧 But… what if I mess up again?
🎧 You probably will. But that's okay!
🎧 Each time you try, you'll get a little better.
🎧 We can practice together.
🎧 Maybe after school, we can go over some things?
🎧 I've got a few tips that really helped me when I was struggling.
🎧 Really? You'd do that?
🎧 Of course! We're in this together.
🎧 You'll see, it'll get easier.
🎧 And one day, you'll look back on today and realize how far you've come.
🎧 Thank you, Sharon. I… I really appreciate it.
🎧 Anytime, Lily. We're friends now, right?
🎧 And friends help each other out.
🎧 Is it far from your house?
🎧 It only took me 3 minutes to get here.
🎧 Really? How did you get there?
🎧 On foot. I realized you were my neighbor.
🎧 Oh. I didn't expect it.
🎧 Coincidence brings us closer together.
🎧 I'm so glad about that.
🎧 I want to come to your house to play once, is that okay?
🎧 Absolutely. Staying at home is so boring.
🎧 Now let's get started.
🎧 I've got a few tips that helped me a lot when I was in your shoes.
🎧 Do you want to hear them?
🎧 Yes, please.
🎧 Okay. First, one thing that really helped me
🎧 was practicing English in small, everyday situations.
🎧 Like when you're at home.
🎧 Try thinking in English or even talking to yourself in English.
🎧 It might feel weird at first,
🎧 but it really helps get your brain used to the language.
🎧 Talking to myself? Like… just saying what I'm doing?
🎧 Exactly!
🎧 Like, if you're making breakfast,
🎧 you can say, ‘I'm cracking an egg,' or ‘I'm spreading butter on the toast.'
🎧 It's a great way to practice without any pressure.
🎧 And the more you do it, the more natural it will feel.
🎧 That sounds like something I can try.
🎧 What else?
🎧 Another thing is reading out loud.
🎧 Even if it's just a paragraph or a short story,
🎧 reading out loud helps you get used to the sounds of the words.
🎧 And it's okay to go slow, you don't have to rush.
🎧 It's about getting comfortable with the language.
🎧 I've always been afraid to read out loud because I didn't want to mess up.
🎧 I totally get that.
🎧 But the more you do it, the less scary it becomes.
🎧 And if you make a mistake, just correct it and keep going.
🎧 It's all part of the learning process.
🎧 And you can even record yourself and listen back to see how you're improving.
🎧 Talking to myself?
🎧 That sounds helpful. I'll give it a try.
🎧 And here's another tip:
🎧 When you're listening to English,
🎧 like in movies, songs, or even in class,
🎧 try to mimic what you hear.
🎧 Repeat phrases all sentences to yourself.
🎧 It's a great way to practice pronunciation and intonation.
🎧 Plus, it's fun to imitate your favorite characters.
🎧 I love watching movies.
🎧 I never thought about repeating what they say.
🎧 It's one of my favorite ways to practice!
🎧 And don't worry if it doesn't sound perfect right away.
🎧 The more you mimic,
🎧 the better you'll get at capturing the flow of the language.
🎧 I'm going to start doing that.
🎧 It sounds like a fun way to practice.
🎧 It's good to hear that.
🎧 In the beginning, you can start with short videos cut from movies.
🎧 That way, you won't feel bad quickly because it's easy to learn and interesting.
🎧 Thank you so much.
🎧 Remember, it's okay to pause and think about what you want to say.
🎧 You don't have to rush.
🎧 The more you practice, the more natural it will feel.
🎧 Okay. I'll try.
🎧 Sometimes words just get mixed up in my head and I panic.
🎧 That's totally normal.
🎧 I still get nervous sometimes,
🎧 but it's all about taking it one step at a time.
🎧 And if you ever get stuck, just take a deep breath and start again.
🎧 No one's perfect.
🎧 I'll keep practicing.
🎧 I want to get better so I don't have to feel so scared all the time.
🎧 And you will. You've already made so much progress, Lily.
🎧 I'm really proud of you.
🎧 I wouldn't have been able to do it without you, Sharon.
🎧 Thank you so much.
🎧 Hey, you're doing all the hard work.
🎧 I'm just here to cheer you on.
🎧 Alright, class! It's time for our presentations.
🎧 Who would like to go first?
🎧 Teacher, I… I'll go first.
🎧 Wonderful! Come on up, Lily.
🎧 Come on!
🎧 The key to a successful presentation is preparation and confidence.
🎧 You've already prepared, so there's nothing to be afraid of.
🎧 The only thing left to do is believe in yourself.
🎧 The eyes of others can hurt you.
🎧 Hey. Look at that clumsy girl.
🎧 I remember!
🎧 How did she have the courage to volunteer today?
🎧 I thought she would be quiet like before.
🎧 I don't know.
🎧 Maybe she just wants attention.
🎧 Let's see what she can do.
🎧 Alright. Just remember what Sharon said.
🎧 Good morning, everyone.
🎧 Today, I want to talk about… the importance of protecting our environment.
🎧 We all have a part to play in keeping our planet safe.
🎧 Simple things like recycling and reducing waste can make a big difference.
🎧 If we work together, we can create a better future for everyone
🎧 Thank you for listening.
🎧 I hope we can all do our part to protect the environment.
🎧 That was excellent, Lily!
🎧 You've improved so much. I'm very proud of you.
🎧 Lily, you were amazing up there! I knew you could do it!
🎧 Thanks, Sharon. But I still feel like I have a long way to go.
🎧 I want to get even better at speaking English.
🎧 And you can definitely do it.
🎧 Did you see the surprised look on Danny and his friends faces
🎧 when you finished your presentation?
🎧 I'm glad I was able to change and improve so quickly.
🎧 I did. I'm glad I was able to change positively so quickly.
🎧 As you said, knowing how to speak and communicate
🎧 gives me the confidence to face other people.
🎧 You've helped me a lot.
🎧 Would you like to get something to eat?
🎧 I'd like to treat you to thank you.
🎧 Then I can't refuse this tempting invitation!

Somebody help me!

🎧 Dad! Where's mom?
🎧 She went out to run some errands.
🎧 Oh, I hope she remembered to get some flour for me.
🎧 What's that for?
🎧 It's for baking. I want to make a birthday cake for Laura.
🎧 I didn't know you baked.
🎧 Well, you're right. I've never made a cake before.
🎧 Liz, be careful not to burn the kitchen down, alright?
🎧 Well, let's hope for the best...
🎧 I'm serious, Liz. My back's been bothering me, and I don't have the energy to clean up a mess.
🎧 Absolutely, dad.
🎧 You won't have to help me eat the cake either.
🎧 Somebody help me!
🎧 Is that mom?
🎧 Sounds like it. Let's go see what's going on!
🎧 Oh, thank goodness you're both here!
🎧 Mom, what happened? Why is everything on the floor?
🎧 Well, the supermarket bags ripped, and my groceries went everywhere.
🎧 Dad, what are you waiting for? Help Mom pick things up!
🎧 Looks like my back doesn't get a day off, then.
🎧 What are you doing this weekend?
🎧 Napping.
🎧 I mean, what else are you doing
🎧 besides napping?
🎧 Well, you might not believe me, but that's all I can really manage right now.
🎧 Don't tell me you plan to sleep all day?
🎧 Yes. What's wrong with that?
🎧 Naps are good for you.
🎧 You deserve some relaxation, but naps shouldn't be your only activity.
🎧 You don't know the half of it.
🎧 I've been sleep deprived all week.
🎧 What's going on?
🎧 I've had to stay up
🎧 super late, finishing reports
🎧 Like every single day! I almost didn't even have time to shower!
🎧 Sounds like your workload is crazy.
🎧 Absolutely! So is my sleep schedule.
🎧 That's definitely not healthy in the long run, Mia! You should do something!
🎧 So what am I supposed to do?
🎧 Well, maybe you should change your schedule
🎧 How about going to bed earlier?
🎧 As if my boss would let me turn
🎧 in all those reports late.
🎧 You could finish them during your working hours!
🎧 There is no way I can finish those reports within 8 hours.
🎧 Plus, I have other tasks to do...
🎧 Well, in that case, I guess you should change your boss then.
🎧 Deb?
🎧 Yes, Rob? What's up?
🎧 Can I ask you something?
🎧 Of course. Honey. What is it?
🎧 Why are you with me?
🎧 You ask this like... every other week, Rob.
🎧 I know, I know, sweetie... But it feels like you never really explain it.
🎧 Explain what exactly?
🎧 Well, why does an amazing woman like you choose to be with... someone like me?
🎧 And what's wrong with someone like you?
🎧 You know, I'm not exactly good looking.
🎧 I don't drive a fancy car.
🎧 I work a boring 9 to 5 job.
🎧 So?
🎧 You could have chosen someone else... Someone who is more... exciting, you know?
🎧 You mean someone who is handsome, has a fast car and a glamorous life?
🎧 Well...
🎧 Rob, you make me so happy. Truly happy. That's all that matters.
🎧 But, Deb...
🎧 No buts, Rob. Now please help me set the table. 
🎧 Dinner is ready.
🎧 Woah, you look stressed! What's up?
🎧 The upcoming annual party! It's getting on my nerves!
🎧 I know, right? It's on our day off.
🎧 Can you believe it?
🎧 I'll have to cancel my whole holiday
🎧 trip with my husband.
🎧 Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
🎧 But actually, there's something else stressing me out.
🎧 What's that?
🎧 Finding a dress for the party!
🎧 Don't you have like a wardrobe full of dresses?
🎧 My closet is full, but nothing feels fancy enough.
🎧 I feel you! Maybe you could buy something new?
🎧 I don't know if I can even afford a new dress right now...
🎧 Everything is so expensive.
🎧 How about renting?
🎧 Have you considered renting a dress?
🎧 Renting? Is that even a thing?
🎧 Totally! My friend actually runs a rental shop with amazing dresses at reasonable prices.
🎧 Really?
🎧 Absolutely.
🎧 We can swing by after work.
🎧 How does that sound?
🎧 That's amazing, thank you so much!
🎧 No problem, happy to help!
🎧 Oh, hey, Paul! What's up?
🎧 Well, I'm here about my son, Jake...
🎧 What's wrong with Jake?
🎧 So, he told me he got a little carried away while playing at your house this afternoon...
🎧 Ah, yeah, the kids definitely had a wild time running around.
🎧 And he ended up breaking your vase...
🎧 Well, it's true.
🎧 Jake accidentally hit the table and broke the vase.
🎧 But thankfully, no one got hurt!
🎧 Yeah, thankfully! 
🎧 Speaking of the vase, I heard it was a sentimental piece...
🎧 Well, it was from my grandma.
🎧 She gave it to my wife and me on our wedding day.
🎧 Is there anything I can do
🎧 to make it up to you?
🎧 Like replacing it with another one.
🎧 Don't worry about it, Paul! 
🎧 Actually, my grandma heard about it
🎧 and said she will send me a new one.
🎧 She did?
🎧 Well, that's a relief.
🎧 But please, let me at least replace this one.
🎧 Come on Paul.
🎧 You helped us out a ton over the years.
🎧 This is nothing.
🎧 Plus, it's not like Jake did it intentionally!
🎧 If you say so...
🎧 Um, I will tell Jake to be more careful next time!
🎧 Hey, I didn't see you in history today.
🎧 Well, something came up this morning,
🎧 and I had to skip a few classes.
🎧 Oh. What happened?
🎧 My little sister tripped while playing with her friends
🎧 and I had to take her to the hospital.
🎧 Oh my, is she alright?
🎧 Aside from a broken leg,
🎧 I guess she's fine.
🎧 A broken leg is not fine, Jake!
🎧 Well, she's in good spirits considering everything.
🎧 They set the cast, and she's resting now.
🎧 So, she's fine, I guess.
🎧 Oh, your sister is such a brave little girl!
🎧 She is! Bet she got her courage from our Grandpa!
🎧 Have you told your parents?
🎧 They are on a trip, right?
🎧 Yes. I called them this morning
🎧 and they told me they would book
🎧 the first flight to get home.
🎧 They must be worried sick!
🎧 They are! Anyway, can I borrow your history notes?
🎧 No problem! I will send them to your email!
🎧 Thank you, dude! You're a lifesaver.
🎧 Mike, why are you still here?
🎧 What do you mean, Mom?
🎧 I thought you had a project at Simon's house today? 
🎧 The science project, right?
🎧 Yes, Mom. But we canceled it. I'm staying home today.
🎧 Oh. Why did you cancel it?
🎧 It's raining outside. Don't you see?
🎧 Rain or shine, it doesn't necessarily affect school projects, does it?
🎧 Well, it kind of does in this case. Our project is all about the sun.
🎧 Interesting! What do you have to do?
🎧 We need to track the sun's position
🎧 throughout the day.
🎧 How are you planning to do that?
🎧 That's the whole point! 
🎧 We have to find a way
🎧 to measure its movement.
🎧 So what is your and Simon's plan?
🎧 We are going to use a tree as a marker...
🎧 And then?
🎧 And then we will measure its shadow to see how the sun moves.
🎧 That's actually a clever idea! 
🎧 I bet you and Simon will get an A for this project!
🎧 I'm not sure if it's possible.
🎧 Why not?
🎧 Because if it continues to rain, we won't get a chance to do our project.
🎧 You're right. Hopefully, tomorrow will be sunny for you.
🎧 Thank you. Mom.
🎧 Hey, Amy! It's nice to see you here!
🎧 Oh, Laura! Hi! What a nice surprise!
🎧 What are you doing here?
🎧 This is a bookstore. Of course, I'm looking for some books.
🎧 Have you found them?
🎧 Unfortunately, not yet.
🎧 May I see your book list?
🎧 Sure, here you go.
🎧 Hmm, interesting choices.
🎧 These are some real classics! But... I don't think you'll find them here.
🎧 This is the biggest bookstore in town. I think they would have everything!
🎧 True, but these books might
🎧 be a bit out of print.
🎧 They were published quite a while ago.
🎧 Um... You're right...
🎧 But hey, don't worry!
🎧 Our local library probably has them all.
🎧 I know, but I want to buy them
🎧 as a present for my sister's birthday.
🎧 I see... Is she a bookworm?
🎧 Yes, she reads a lot.
🎧 So how about buying her something else?
🎧 Like a reading lamp?
🎧 You know what, that's 
🎧 actually a great idea!
🎧 Thanks for the suggestion.
🎧 I heard that you got into some trouble with a client?
🎧 Oh, already?
🎧 The office gossip sure spreads like wildfire.
🎧 Well, it's hard not to hear the argument between you and the boss this morning.
🎧 Yeah, he left his door open, so I'm sure the whole floor heard it.
🎧 So what happened?
🎧 My client didn't like my proposal.
🎧 She made me change it like... 6 times.
🎧 Six times?
🎧 What exactly did she hate
🎧 about your proposal?
🎧 Apparently the cost.
🎧 She said it was out of her budget.
🎧 And what did you do?
🎧 I changed the whole plan 
🎧 completely to fit her budget, but...
🎧 But?
🎧 But then she didn't like the plan.
🎧 She said it was too plain.
🎧 Things aren't always easy. She can't have it all.
🎧 Funny thing is, that's exactly what I told her.
🎧 I guess that didn't go over well?
🎧 Absolutely! That's why I got a lecture from the boss this morning.
🎧 Hey Nicole!
🎧 Hi Lily! How was your day?
🎧 Pretty good! How about yours?
🎧 Not bad! Are you cooking dinner? It smells amazing!
🎧 Yes, I'm making pasta. Do you want some?
🎧 Really? That would be great.
🎧 Sure, but it'll take another half hour or so.
🎧 I can wait all day for your pasta.
🎧 Oh, I wonder if Maya would want some as well!
🎧 Speaking of Maya, did she tell you?
🎧 Maya? About what? I haven't seen her since this morning.
🎧 She's moving out at the end of the year.
🎧 We should probably start
🎧 looking for a new roommate.
🎧 Wow, that's sudden!
🎧 She didn't mention anything to me.
🎧 Actually, she just mentioned it to me last night.
🎧 Maybe she will tell you later
🎧 when she comes home.
🎧 Did she say why she's moving out?
🎧 Apparently, she has to move to Shanghai for work.
🎧 Oh wow, that's exciting!
🎧 I lived in Shanghai for a long time.
🎧 It was an amazing experience.
🎧 Really? You should definitely give Maya some tips!
🎧 Absolutely!
🎧 Ava, come on, dinner's ready.
🎧 Actually, can you tell Mom and Dad I'm skipping dinner tonight?
🎧 Hey, what's wrong? Stomach ache?
🎧 No, I'm just not really feeling hungry.
🎧 Do you want to talk about
🎧 what's bothering you?
🎧 It's just... I miss my best friend.
🎧 You mean, Olivia?
🎧 Of course, Dave! Who else could be my best friend?
🎧 She moved to the UK with her family, didn't she?
🎧 Yeah, and it feels like she already forgot about me.
🎧 We haven't spoken in a week.
🎧 Ava, she's probably super busy getting settled in.
🎧 You don't get it, Dave!
🎧 We always talked every day.
🎧 No matter how busy we were.
🎧 That was when she lived here.
🎧 Give her some time to adjust, trust me.
🎧 Fine. I trust you.
🎧 But I still don't want dinner.
🎧 Ava, you weren't even this bad when you broke up with your ex!
🎧 Oh, don't even remind me of that guy!
🎧 Okay, okay, sorry!
🎧 How about I save you a plate?
🎧 You can heat it up whenever you're hungry.
🎧 Thanks, Dave. That sounds good.
🎧 Ben, what are you doing out here?
🎧 Oh, Sophie! I'm just... looking.
🎧 Looking at what?
🎧 Um, those cakes!
🎧 Oh, they look delicious!
🎧 They do! I'm so hungry!
🎧 Why don't you head inside
🎧 and grab a slice?
🎧 I can't really afford it right now.
🎧 Why not?
🎧 Did you already blow your allowance?
🎧 No, I haven't touched it.
🎧 But I'm saving for a gaming console.
🎧 I see...
🎧 That's why you're standing outside a bakery and staring longingly at their cakes.
🎧 Yeah, well, dinner's almost ready anyway, so I shouldn't eat cake.
🎧 We could get some for dessert, though.
🎧 Don't try to talk me into buying it!
🎧 No worries, little brother! It's on me!
🎧 Really?!
🎧 Why are you suddenly generous today?
🎧 What's the occasion?
🎧 Because I feel like eating some tasty cakes!
🎧 Come on, let's go in and pick your favorite!
🎧 Alright, alright! You're the best, sis!
🎧 There, finally finished that report!
🎧 You look rough, Brandon.
🎧 Well, time is money.
🎧 I have to invest it in something useful, like my report!
🎧 Yes, you're right, but your health is an investment too.
🎧 Easy for you to say, Isa.
🎧 Some of us have deadlines to meet.
🎧 Yeah, you seem to meet those deadlines successfully
🎧 because you look really dead right now!
🎧 What do you mean?
🎧 Look in the mirror, Brandon!
🎧 You look like you haven't slept for weeks.
🎧 Well, actually, I haven't slept for only 2 days!
🎧 Oh my goodness.
🎧 You go to bed right now!
🎧 Come on, it's not that bad!
🎧 Let me send out some emails first.
🎧 No emails tonight, honey.
🎧 It's time to wind down.
🎧 Your eyes are getting heavy.
🎧 Alright, alright! But can I at least brush my teeth first?
🎧 Hey, do you mind if I sit here?
🎧 Sure, no problem!
🎧 Just let me just move my bag a sec.
🎧 Thanks!
🎧 Wow, your lunch smells amazing!
🎧 Thanks!
🎧 It's actually leftovers from dinner last night.
🎧 You must be a great cook!
🎧 Actually, my husband's the one who cooks most of the time.
🎧 He's amazing.
🎧 Lucky you!
🎧 What about you?
🎧 What did you pack for lunch?
🎧 Fish tacos! Do you want to try a bite?
🎧 That's really nice of you
🎧 But I'll have to pass.
🎧 You don't like fish?
🎧 Fish upsets my stomach.
🎧 I will get sick from that.
🎧 Oh no, I'm so sorry!
🎧 I had no idea.
🎧 No worries! I'm used to it!
🎧 Wow, that's tough!
🎧 I don't think I could survive without fish.
🎧 Well, my husband makes up for it with all sorts of delicious non-fishy dishes, so...
🎧 You're right!
🎧 Hey, Liam, guess what?!
🎧 What's up? Emma?
🎧 I'm wondering what can make you that excited.
🎧 There's a new vinyl record store that just opened!
🎧 Right in the next block!
🎧 Sounds cool!
🎧 We absolutely have to check it out!
🎧 Imagine all the hidden treasures we might find!
🎧 You mean right now?
🎧 Yes, right now!
🎧 That'll have to wait.
🎧 I'm working on my presentation.
🎧 Oh, I thought you were done with that?
🎧 Turned out I misunderstood the assignment
🎧 and now I have to do it all over again.
🎧 Sorry to hear that!
🎧 Is there any way I can help you?
🎧 Um... I'm thirsty?
🎧 How about some bubble tea?
🎧 That sounds tasty.
🎧 Perfect.
🎧 I'll order some online right now.
🎧 In the meantime, want some water?
🎧 Sure!
🎧 I'll be right back!
🎧 Thank you, Emma!
🎧 Here is your water!
🎧 Thanks, Isa! Where are the kids?
🎧 Dave is at his friend's house.
🎧 Beth is studying at the library.
🎧 Oh, at the library?
🎧 Shouldn't she be enjoying the summer break?
🎧 Why is she studying so hard?
🎧 She wants to be a dentist.
🎧 You know, it's a lot of work
🎧 to become one.
🎧 I had no idea.
🎧 I always thought she was more into literature and would become a writer.
🎧 To be honest, that surprised me, too!
🎧 Did you ask her why she wanted to become a dentist?
🎧 Well, Beth mentioned that dentists make good money, so...
🎧 Well, that's true, although dental school tuition can be incredibly expensive.
🎧 Did you talk to her about that?
🎧 Yes, we discussed her options and available resources.
🎧 Sounds like she's well-informed then!
🎧 Well, let's hope so!
🎧 Hey, Wilson!
🎧 How's the college application going?
🎧 Hey, Eddie!
🎧 It's alright, I sent out my applications last week.
🎧 How many colleges did you apply to?
🎧 Five. Let's hope I get into one.
🎧 Dude, seriously, you'll get into all of them!
🎧 Thanks, Eddie! How about you?
🎧 I haven't been clear
🎧 about what I want yet.
🎧 So I decided to take a gap year.
🎧 Have you made up your mind?
🎧 Yes, I've made up my mind.
🎧 So what are your plans for the gap year?
🎧 I'm going to help my mom out at her bakery.
🎧 Cool. What will you do?
🎧 I'm going to bake.
🎧 Plus, I'll take care of some marketing, too.
🎧 That'll be a lot of work! Are you nervous?
🎧 In fact, I'm excited about the future.
🎧 I'm glad to hear that.
🎧 Hey Sarah, have you seen the construction site?
🎧 No. What's that?
🎧 Apparently, they're starting construction next month, right on 5th Street.
🎧 So what does that mean for us?
🎧 That means they're rerouting the bus lane.
🎧 Oh, no.
🎧 How am I going to get to work?
🎧 That's the thing.
🎧 your nearest bus stop will be four blocks away once they change the route.
🎧 Maybe I can see if they'll let me work from home for a bit.
🎧 That's a good idea!
🎧 Or you could ask Daniel.
🎧 Ask him about what?
🎧 He drives to work, and you guys live in the same neighborhood?
🎧 Yeah...
🎧 Maybe he could give you a ride for a month until things settle down?
🎧 That's actually a great idea! I'll definitely ask him.
🎧 Dude, what's with the long face?
🎧 Oh, you wouldn't want to hear that.
🎧 Come on, man, spill it.
🎧 You know I'm your best friend.
🎧 It's about my birthday presents...
🎧 Carry on, I'm all ears...
🎧 So, you know, I am a football fan.
🎧 Yeah, everybody knows you're a football fan. A huge one.
🎧 Except for my parents.
🎧 Oh, really?
🎧 They got me a ticket to a basketball game and a pair of basketball sneakers.
🎧 Ouch, that's bad...
🎧 Sounds like someone got their sports mixed up.
🎧 They're the basketball fans, aren't they?
🎧 Bingo!
🎧 Did you tell them how you're feeling?
🎧 Yeah, but things got a bit heated.
🎧 Hence the grumpy face.
🎧 Hey Mia, what are you up to?
🎧 I'm looking for some ideas.
🎧 Ideas about what?
🎧 House renovation.
🎧 I have a small house, and I'm thinking of renovating it.
🎧 Oh, cool.
🎧 What made you decide on a renovation?
🎧 It is a bit old. I got it so cheap though.
🎧 So, I guess there is nothing to complain about.
🎧 Do you have any photos on you? I'd love to see it!
🎧 Not right now, but I'll take some and show them to you tomorrow.
🎧 Great.
🎧 And, are you going to do it yourself or hire a pro?
🎧 I'm still thinking about it.
🎧 Renovations can get expensive, and I'm not sure my budget can handle it.
🎧 That's true. They can definitely add up.
