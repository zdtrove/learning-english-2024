At the Convenience Store

ðŸŽ§ Hey there! Do you have any gluten-free snacks?  
ðŸŽ§ Yes, we do! Right over there in aisle 3, we've got some gluten-free chips and protein bars.  
ðŸŽ§ Awesome! I'll check those out. Oh, I'll also grab a bottle of sparkling water.  
ðŸŽ§ Great choice! We have a few flavors in the fridge if you want to take a look.  
ðŸŽ§ I'll go with the lemon-lime.  
ðŸŽ§ Perfect! That'll be $88.50.  
ðŸŽ§ Here you go.  
ðŸŽ§ Thanks! Enjoy your snacks!  
ðŸŽ§ Hey, do you have any energy drinks?  
ðŸŽ§ Yep! We have a whole section in the cooler. It's next to the snacks.  
ðŸŽ§ Cool! I'll check it out. Oh, and do you have any sugar-free options?  
ðŸŽ§ Yes, we do! Just look for the labels; they're marked.  
ðŸŽ§ Got one. How much is it?  
ðŸŽ§ That'll be $3.25.  
ðŸŽ§ Thanks. By the way, do you sell phone chargers?  
ðŸŽ§ Sure do! We have a few different types. Here they are.  
ðŸŽ§ This one is perfect.  
ðŸŽ§ Okay. Is that everything?  
ðŸŽ§ Yep, that's it.  
ðŸŽ§ All right, your total is $10.50.  
ðŸŽ§ Thanks.  
ðŸŽ§ Hi there! Do you have any fresh fruit?  
ðŸŽ§ Yes, we do! We've got apples, bananas, and some oranges over by the front.  
ðŸŽ§ Great! I'll take a couple of bananas. And I also need some avocados, too.  
ðŸŽ§ I'm afraid we ran out of avocados. We should have more in tomorrow if you want to check back.  
ðŸŽ§ That sounds good. I'll just grab some bananas then. And do you have any yogurt?  
ðŸŽ§ We do! It's in the dairy section at the back.  
ðŸŽ§ What types of yogurt do you have?  
ðŸŽ§ We have plain and flavored yogurt.  
ðŸŽ§ I'll go take a look.  
ðŸŽ§ Your total is $10.75.  
ðŸŽ§ I'll pay by card.  
ðŸŽ§ Thank you! Here you go. Have a great day!  

A Visit to the Doctor

ðŸŽ§ Good morning, John. How are you today?  
ðŸŽ§ Morning, Doc. I'm okay, I guess. Just here for my regular checkup.  
ðŸŽ§ Great, let's get started. Any concerns or symptoms you want to discuss?  
ðŸŽ§ Actually, yeah. I've been having some abdominal pain and cramping lately.  
ðŸŽ§ I see. How often does that happen?  
ðŸŽ§ It varies, but I've noticed it happens more when I eat certain foods. Plus, I've been bloated, gassy, and sometimes I either have diarrhea or constipation. It's frustrating.  
ðŸŽ§ That does sound uncomfortable. Have you noticed any patterns with your diet?  
ðŸŽ§ Yeah, I think certain things like dairy and spicy foods might trigger it, but I'm not sure.  
ðŸŽ§ It sounds like you might be dealing with irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS. Let's talk about some dietary changes that could help.  
ðŸŽ§ IBS? What does that mean for me?  
ðŸŽ§ It means we need to pay attention to what you're eating. Reducing high-fat foods, increasing fiber gradually, and keeping a food diary can help identify triggers.  
ðŸŽ§ Sounds manageable. What about medication?  
ðŸŽ§ I'm going to prescribe you a medication that can help with the cramps and discomfort. It should ease your symptoms a bit.  
ðŸŽ§ Thanks, Doc. I appreciate it.  
ðŸŽ§ Of course! Let's schedule a follow-up in a month to see how you're doing with the changes.  
ðŸŽ§ Sounds good. I'll do my best.  
ðŸŽ§ That's the spirit! Take care, John.  
ðŸŽ§ You too, Doc. Thanks again.

At the Dentist

ðŸŽ§ Let's take a look at your x-rays. It looks like you have some overcrowding and a bit of misalignment. I recommend braces to help straighten everything out.  
ðŸŽ§ Braces? Really? I thought I was too old for that.  
ðŸŽ§ Not at all! It's quite common for adults to get braces. We have several options you can choose from.  
ðŸŽ§ Like what?  
ðŸŽ§ We have traditional metal braces, ceramic braces, and even clear aligners like Invisalign.  
ðŸŽ§ Hm, what's the difference in terms of visibility?  
ðŸŽ§ Well, metal braces are the most visible, but they're very effective. Ceramic braces blend in more with your teeth, so they're less noticeable. Invisalign is completely clear, but it requires more discipline to wear them for the recommended hours.  
ðŸŽ§ Gotcha. What about the price?  
ðŸŽ§ The metal braces cost $3,000. The ceramic braces are a bit more, around $4,000. Invisalign is around $4,500, but it varies based on your treatment plan.  
ðŸŽ§ Okay, I see. I think I prefer the ceramic braces since I want something less noticeable.  
ðŸŽ§ Great choice! They'll work well for you. Let's get you started with the next steps.  
ðŸŽ§ Awesome! I'm excited to see the results.  
ðŸŽ§ You will be amazed! Let's schedule your appointment for the fitting.

At the Pizza Place

ðŸŽ§ Hi, welcome to Tony's Pizza Place! Are you ready to order?  
ðŸŽ§ Hi, yes, we're ready. I'll have the barbecue chicken pizza, please. Can I get extra chicken and red onions on that?  
ðŸŽ§ Of course! And what kind of crust would you like with that?  
ðŸŽ§ Thin crust, please, and could it be a small size?  
ðŸŽ§ Got it! And for you, sir?  
ðŸŽ§ I'll have the Caprese pizza. Could I get extra basil and cherry tomatoes, but hold the balsamic glaze?  
ðŸŽ§ Absolutely! What size and crust would you like?  
ðŸŽ§ Medium size, and could I get a stuffed crust, please?  
ðŸŽ§ Stuffed crust it is! Would you like any drinks to go with that?  
ðŸŽ§ What do you recommend for a refreshing drink?  
ðŸŽ§ Our homemade lemonade is quite popular. It's sweet and tangy, perfect for pairing with pizza.  
ðŸŽ§ Sounds good! I'll add the lemonade then. Do you have any specialty sodas?  
ðŸŽ§ Yes, we have a selection of craft sodas. Do you have a preference for flavor?  
ðŸŽ§ What do you recommend?  
ðŸŽ§ The Cherry Cola is a customer favorite. It's rich and bubbly.  
ðŸŽ§ I'll go with the Cherry Cola then, thank you!  
ðŸŽ§ Great choices! I'll be right back with your drinks.

shave but honestly I'm not sure what

style I should go

for no worries man let's figure it out

what's your usual

style I usually just go with

whatever I was thinking maybe something

different this

time all right how how about I show you

a few options you could go for a classic

crew cut a nice fade or even something

like a buzz cut where the length of hair

is the same on all parts of the

head H I've never tried a buzz cut

what's a crew cut

like a crew cut is short on the sides

and back with a bit more length on

top it's clean and easy to

manage sounds good and what about the

fade a fade Gra gradually shortens the

hair from top to bottom creating a nice

blend I like the sound of that but I

think I want something really low

maintenance then I'd recommend the buzz

cut super low maintenance and it looks

sharp plus it's a good look for a fresh

start you know what let's do the buzz

cut and I definitely need that shave too

okay

yours what

happened so I was trying to fix this

leaky tap in my

kitchen you know the classic DIY

project uh the infamous DIY project gone

wrong exactly I thought I could save a

few bucks but apparently I'm no

plumber well let's see what we're

working with it's not pretty

I cut my hand badly on the

pipe yikes that sounds painful did you

at least turn off the water

first of course I'm not completely

Reckless I just didn't expect it to be

so

sharp all right it's a bit

deep I'm going to clean it up and we

might need to stitch

it Stitch it like actually sew it up

yeah yep just a few stitches but you'll

be back to your DIY adventures in no

time great just what I needed an excuse

to avoid fixing my sink

forever well at least you have a good

story

now true next time I'll call a

[Music]

professional decorating the

[Music]

house so Edward what do you envision for

this

space well I want something cozy where I

can relax and

entertain how about starting with a

large sectional sofa it'll be perfect

for lounging and hosting

friends yes a sectional sounds great

maybe in a light yellow love that choice

we could pair it with some white and

green

pillows that sounds perfect what about a

coffee

table yes a round one would be nice for

conversations and maybe a few plants

around great idea a couple of tall

potted plants behind the sofa would

really liven up the

space speaking of which how do you feel

about wall art yes some abstract pieces

would be great they could go between the

plants perfect abstract art would really

add some character do you have any

thoughts on what kind of rug you might

want

I was thinking something plush and

neutral like a cream or light

gray that's a great choice and what

about some

lighting a nice floor lamp next to the

sectional could create a warm glow in

the

evenings I love that idea now what about

a TV set do you have a specific spot in

mind for

it I was thinking of putting it on that

wall opposite the sofa it would be

perfect for movie Nights

perfect we could even add some shelves

for books or decor items around

it I can't wait to see it all come

[Music]

together renting an

apartment wow this place is amazing it

feels so

spacious right

the high ceilings and those big Windows

really make a

difference you get a ton of natural

light

here I love that how much is the rent

it's listed at

$11,200 a

month that includes water and trash

removal by the

way okay that's within my

budget what about the security

deposit it's usually one month's rent so

$1,200

it's standard for most

places got it and how about the

neighborhood what's it like around here

you're going to love

it it's a vibrant area with lots of

cafes parks and

shops the local farmers market is just a

couple of blocks away on

Sundays that sounds

perfect I've been looking for something

with a community Vibe absolutely

plus there's a great gym just around the

corner and a couple of co-working spaces

if you ever need to work outside of

[Music]

home oh that's really

convenient how's the public transport

situation the subway station is a

5-minute walk you can get to downtown in

less than 15

minutes super

easy nice and how's the noise level I've

had some bad experiences with that this

building has excellent

soundproofing you'll hardly hear

anything from the

street the neighbors are pretty quiet

noisy
