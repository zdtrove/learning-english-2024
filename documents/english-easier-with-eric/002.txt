Dress Down - Wear Casual Clothes

🎧 Did you see the email about Friday’s team outing? They said we can dress down for the day.
🎧 Yeah, it’s nice to have a break from the usual business attire. I’m thinking of wearing jeans and a T-shirt since they mentioned games and a barbecue.
🎧 That sounds good. It’s always funny seeing everyone out of their formal office wear, isn’t it?
🎧 Definitely, but it’s a nice change. It helps everyone relax and connect better.
🎧 True, and it’s way easier to join activities when you’re not in a suit.
🎧 Exactly! I’m looking forward to it. Let’s hope the weather cooperates.
🎧 Me too. Casual Fridays don’t happen often, so let’s make the most of it!

Mark Down - Reduce the Price

🎧 Have you been to the new store downtown yet?
🎧 Not yet. What’s it like?
🎧 I went yesterday, and they have tons of items marked down.
🎧 Really? How big are the discounts?
🎧 Some items are up to 50% off. I got a new jacket for half the original price.
🎧 That’s amazing! I’ve been looking for deals on winter clothes.
🎧 You should check it out. They have a great selection, and the markdowns are substantial.
🎧 Do you think the sale will last long?
🎧 Not sure, but the salesperson said they’re clearing out inventory, so it might go on for a while.
🎧 Good to know. I’ll try to go this weekend and see what I can find.
🎧 Sounds like a plan—you might find some great deals!

Jump In - Enter Into an Activity With Enthusiasm

🎧 Have you ever tried salsa dancing? I’m thinking about signing up for classes.
🎧 Actually, I’ve been going for a couple of months now. You should jump in—the classes are a blast!
🎧 Really? It sounds like fun, but I’m a bit nervous since I’ve never danced before.
🎧 I felt the same way at first, but the instructors are great. Everyone is a beginner at some point, so there’s no pressure to be perfect.
🎧 That’s reassuring. What should I expect from my first class?
🎧 They usually start with simple steps and timing, then gradually add more complex moves as you get comfortable. It’s very progressive.
🎧 That sounds manageable. How often do the classes meet?
🎧 They’re held twice a week, but you can jump in anytime. There’s no set sequence, so you won’t fall behind.
🎧 Great! That flexibility helps. Maybe I’ll join you next week.
🎧 Absolutely! I think you’ll enjoy it—it’s a great way to unwind and meet new people.

Catch Off Guard - Surprise Someone Unexpectedly

🎧 Did you hear about Sarah’s surprise party last weekend?
🎧 No, I missed it. How did it go?
🎧 It was incredible. We totally caught her off guard—she thought she was going to a dinner for her brother’s promotion.
🎧 That’s brilliant! Her reaction must have been priceless.
🎧 Absolutely. She was speechless at first. It took her a moment to take it all in, and everyone did a great job keeping it a secret.
🎧 Who all was there?
🎧 Pretty much the whole gang and some of her family members. We had it at her favorite restaurant downtown, and the place was decorated beautifully.
🎧 That sounds like a lot of fun. Did you guys do anything special?
🎧 Yeah, we put together a video montage of memories from everyone. It was a mix of funny and heartfelt messages, and it definitely caught her off guard too.
🎧 Wow, that’s so thoughtful. I’ll have to check in with her—it sounds like it was a night to remember.

Give Back - Return Something to Its Original Owner

🎧 Did you manage to give back those books you borrowed from Steve?
🎧 Yes, I dropped them off yesterday. He was really glad to get them back since some of them were first editions.
🎧 That’s thoughtful. It’s important to respect other people’s belongings, especially when they have sentimental value.
🎧 Absolutely. I always make sure to return things in the condition I received them. Giving back what isn’t yours is just the right thing to do.
🎧 Definitely. I lent a rare book to a friend once and never got it back—it was disheartening.
🎧 I can imagine. That’s why I never delay returning things. It helps avoid awkward situations later on.
🎧 True, it’s all about maintaining trust. Speaking of which, do you need any books? I just got a few new ones—you’re welcome to borrow them.
🎧 I might take you up on that! Thanks. I’ll make sure to give them back as soon as I’m done.

Flesh Out - Add More Details to Something to Make It More Complete

🎧 So, you mentioned you’re working on a new story for that writing competition. How’s it going?
🎧 It’s going well, but I’m still trying to flesh out the main characters. I want them to be more than just stereotypes.
🎧 What’s the story about?
🎧 It’s a mystery set in a small coastal town. The main character is a retired detective who gets pulled back into solving crimes.
🎧 That sounds intriguing. To flesh out your characters, maybe you could give them quirks or backstories that influence how they solve problems.
🎧 That’s a good idea. I’ve been thinking about giving the detective a reason for retiring early that ties into the main plot.
🎧 That could add a lot of depth. Maybe his last case went wrong, and this new case somehow connects to it.
🎧 I like that! It ties everything together and gives the character a personal stake in solving the mystery. Thanks for the suggestion.

Light Up - Illuminate

🎧 Did you see the new park renovations? They did a great job, especially with the lighting.
🎧 I haven't had the chance yet. What did they change?
🎧 They've installed these new LED light paths that light up beautifully at night. It completely transforms the place.
🎧 That sounds amazing! It must make the park look so different in the evenings.
🎧 It does, and it feels safer too. The whole area is well illuminated, which makes it perfect for evening walks.
🎧 That's a smart upgrade. Good lighting can really enhance the atmosphere of a place.
🎧 Absolutely! And it's not just the paths—they’ve added lights to the trees and benches too. The entire space just lights up so well.
🎧 I'll have to check it out. Maybe we can go for a walk there this weekend.
🎧 Sounds like a plan! You’ll love how it looks, plus it’s a good way to enjoy the outdoors after sunset.
🎧 Great! I’m looking forward to it. It’ll be nice to see how the lights add to the ambiance.

Shake Up - Make Significant Changes or Cause a Disturbance

🎧 Did you hear about the new management at Jenna's company? They're planning to really shake things up.
🎧 Really? I hadn’t heard that. What kind of changes are they thinking about?
🎧 From what Jenna told me, the new CEO wants to restructure several departments and possibly introduce flexible working hours. They're even considering remote work options.
🎧 That sounds like a big shake-up. Do you think it’ll be good for the company in the long run?
🎧 It could be. Jenna seems optimistic. She thinks the changes could lead to better work-life balance and might even boost productivity.
🎧 It's interesting how many companies are switching to these kinds of policies now. It must be a challenge to implement, but I guess it’s necessary for keeping up with the times.
🎧 Definitely. It's all about adapting to new realities. Plus, the flexibility could really help attract and retain talented employees.
🎧 True. I wish our company would take some notes. It’d be nice to have more flexible working conditions here too.

Mull Over - Think About Deeply or at Length

🎧 Have you decided on the vacation spot yet?
🎧 I’m still mulling over a couple of options. It’s hard to choose between the beach resort and the mountain cabin.
🎧 Both sound like great choices. What’s making it difficult to decide?
🎧 Well, the beach is ideal for relaxation, and I love the ocean. But the cabin offers solitude and hiking, which I also enjoy.
🎧 Sounds like you’ve got some good options. Maybe think about what kind of break you really need right now.
🎧 That’s good advice. I’ve been mulling over what would be more refreshing. The beach has the sun and surf, but the mountains might be cooler this time of year.
🎧 Maybe consider the activities each place offers and who you're going with. That might help narrow it down.
🎧 True. I’ll take a deeper look at the amenities and nearby attractions for both. Thanks for helping me sort this out!
🎧 Anytime! Once you’ve mulled it over a bit more, let me know. I’m excited to hear about your choice.

Tune Out - Stop Listening or Paying Attention

🎧 Did you go to the town hall meeting last night?
🎧 I did, but I have to admit I tuned out after the first hour. It was so long and repetitive.
🎧 I know what you mean. They tend to drag on. Was anything important discussed before you tuned out?
🎧 Just the usual updates on community projects. They spent a lot of time on budget allocations.
🎧 That can get tedious. Did they mention anything about the new park proposal?
🎧 They did, but it was buried in so much other stuff. I think I missed some details when I tuned out.
🎧 No worries. I’ll check the minutes when they’re posted online. It’s easier to catch up that way.
🎧 Good idea. Next time, I might just read the summary instead of attending the whole meeting.
🎧 Same here. It’s hard to stay focused for that long.

Gear Up - Prepare for an event or action

🎧 Are you getting excited about the hiking trip next weekend? I've started to gear up already.
🎧 Absolutely! I can't wait. I've been checking my equipment too. What all have you prepared so far?
🎧 I've got my backpack sorted out with the essentials: water filter, first aid kit, and extra layers in case it gets cold. I also upgraded my hiking boots. What about you?
🎧 I'm focusing on the technical gear. I just picked up a new lightweight tent and a better sleeping bag suitable for the colder temperatures we might face at night.
🎧 Good call on the sleeping bag! It's supposed to cool down quite a bit. Have you thought about meals?
🎧 Yeah, I'm planning to pack high-energy foods like nuts, dried fruits, and granola bars. Plus, I'll bring some dehydrated meals—just add water.
🎧 Sounds like we're both well prepared. It's going to be an amazing trip. I'm glad we took the time to properly gear up.
🎧 Me too. A good prep can make all the difference out there. Can't wait to hit the trail with you!

Jazz up - Make something more interesting or lively

🎧 Have you thought about how we can make the party more exciting?
🎧 Yeah, I think we need to jazz up the decorations a bit. The current setup feels too plain.
🎧 I agree. How about adding some string lights and colorful balloons? That could make the space feel more festive.
🎧 Good idea! We could also set up a photo booth with fun props. It'll give people something to do and create great memories.
🎧 I love that! What about the music? Should we create a more lively playlist?
🎧 Definitely! A mix of upbeat tracks and some old favorites should get everyone dancing.
🎧 Sounds perfect. Do you think we should have a themed dress code to add some flair?
🎧 That could be fun! Maybe a retro theme—it's easy for people to dress up for and always looks great.
🎧 Retro it is, then! This is going to be a party to remember!

Usher in - Mark the beginning of something

🎧 Have you seen the decorations downtown? They're really going all out for the Centennial Celebration.
🎧 Yes, I noticed them setting up last night. It seems like it's going to be a huge event.
🎧 Definitely. They're saying it's going to usher in a new annual tradition. If this turns out well, there will be a lot of history to commemorate.
🎧 That would be wonderful. It's about time we had something regular to bring the community together. What's on the agenda for the event?
🎧 There are parades, live music, and a lot of local food vendors, plus a fireworks show to cap off the night.
🎧 Sounds like it's not just a celebration, but a real boost for local businesses too.
🎧 Absolutely! It's a win-win for everyone. I'm planning on spending the whole day there.

Rush off - Leave in a hurry

🎧 Hey, are you still free to grab lunch today?
🎧 I was actually about to text you. I have to rush off to an unexpected meeting at 1 p.m. Can we reschedule?
🎧 No problem. I understand. How about tomorrow? Does that work for you?
🎧 Tomorrow should be perfect. I'm really sorry for the short notice today. It just came up, and I couldn't push it back.
🎧 It's totally fine. I get it. We all have those days. Hope the meeting goes well.
🎧 Thanks, I appreciate it. It's about the new project launch, so it's pretty important.
🎧 Sounds like a big deal. Well, good luck with everything. Just let me know what time works for you tomorrow.
🎧 Will do! I'll check my schedule and confirm by tonight. Thanks for being flexible.
🎧 Of course! Catch up soon, and don't rush too much. Make sure to grab some lunch.
🎧 I will, thanks! Talk soon.

Grind out - Produce in a mechanical unenthusiastic way

🎧 Hey, did you finish the report for the meeting tomorrow?
🎧 Yeah, I managed to grind it out last night. It wasn't my best work, but it's done.
🎧 I get it. Sometimes you just have to push through. What was the toughest part?
🎧 Honestly, the data analysis was a real headache. I felt like I was just going through the motions.
🎧 I can relate. When you're not inspired, it's hard to do more than just grind out the task.
🎧 Exactly. I wish I had more time to really dig into it, but deadlines are deadlines.
🎧 True. At least it's done. We can always improve it later if we need to.
🎧 That's a good point. Maybe we can revisit it next week when things are less hectic.
🎧 Sounds like a plan. Let's focus on getting through the meeting first.

Hold back - Restrain or keep from acting or knowing something

🎧 Have you told your family about your travel plans yet?
🎧 Not yet. I've been holding back because I'm not sure how they'll react.
🎧 I get that. They might be worried, but it's important for them to know. When are you planning to leave?
🎧 Next month. I just don't want to deal with the stress of their concerns right now.
🎧 Understandable. But holding back might make it harder in the long run. Maybe ease them into the idea.
🎧 You're right. I'll probably start by mentioning the benefits of the trip and how I've planned everything out.
🎧 That sounds like a good approach. They might be more supportive if they see you've thought it through.
🎧 Exactly. I'll talk to them this weekend and try to address their concerns upfront.
🎧 Good plan. It's better to be open about it. They'll appreciate your honesty.

Use up - Consume all of something

🎧 Hey, do you know where the rest of the printer ink went? I was about to print some documents, and it looks like we're out.
🎧 Oh, I used up the last of it yesterday. There were a ton of forms I needed to print for the meeting next week. So sorry, I forgot to mention it.
🎧 No worries, but we should probably order more soon. Do we have a regular supplier, or should I look for a deal online?
🎧 We usually order from that online office supply store. They deliver pretty quickly. Maybe check if they have any specials on ink.
🎧 Sounds good. I'll place an order today. How many cartridges should I get this time?
🎧 Maybe get a few extra just to avoid running out again soon, especially with the end of the quarter coming up.
🎧 Agreed. I'll order several to keep us stocked up. I'll also make sure to track the ink levels regularly now.
🎧 Great idea. Let me know if you need the account details for the store.

Own up to - Admit or confess something

🎧 Did you see the news about the project delay?
🎧 Yeah, I did. Apparently, there were some issues with the planning.
🎧 I heard it was because someone missed a crucial deadline.
🎧 Actually, I need to own up to that. I was the one who missed the deadline.
🎧 Really? What happened?
🎧 I underestimated the time needed for one of the tasks, and it set everything back.
🎧 That's tough. It's good of you to own up to it, though. What are you going to do now?
🎧 I've already spoken to the team, and we're working on a plan to catch up.
🎧 That's a good approach. Admitting the mistake is the first step to fixing it.
🎧 Exactly. I just hope we can get back on track quickly.

Dress up - Wear fancy or formal clothes

🎧 So, are you excited about the charity gala next weekend?
🎧 Definitely! I love any excuse to dress up, and this event sounds fantastic. Have you decided what you're going to wear?
🎧 I'm thinking about wearing that black suit I bought last year. It's been hanging in my closet, waiting for an occasion like this.
🎧 That sounds perfect for a gala! I picked out a navy blue gown. It's a bit more formal than what I usually wear, but it's nice to go all out sometimes.
🎧 Absolutely! It's not every day we get to wear something really fancy. Plus, it's for a good cause, so that makes it even better.
🎧 Right! The funds go to local art programs, right? It's great to support the community and have a fun evening out.
🎧 Exactly! It's a win-win. Looking forward to seeing everyone all dressed up and enjoying the night.
🎧 Me too! It'll be a night to remember for sure.

Wash up - Clean dishes, hands, etc.

🎧 Did you finish your lunch?
🎧 Yeah, just now. I'm about to wash up. The kitchen is a bit of a mess.
🎧 Do you need any help with the dishes?
🎧 That would be great, thanks! There are a few pots and pans that need scrubbing too.
🎧 No problem. I'll start with the plates. Did you cook something special today?
🎧 Just tried out a new pasta recipe. It turned out pretty decent. I left some in the pot if you want to try.
🎧 Sounds good! I'll definitely have a taste. Pasta dishes always make for an easier cleanup, thankfully.
🎧 True. Except for the saucepan. That one might need a bit more elbow grease.
🎧 Got it! I'll handle the saucepan then. It's nice to team up like this. Makes the task go faster.
🎧 Absolutely! It's always better with some company. Plus, we can get to the dessert quicker this way.

Fizzle out - Gradually end, usually in a disappointing way

🎧 Have you been following that new TV series that started last month?
🎧 Yes, I started watching it, but I haven't caught up on the latest episodes. How's it going?
🎧 Honestly, it started off really strong, but the last couple of episodes just seemed to fizzle out.
🎧 That's disappointing. What happened?
🎧 The plot just lost momentum. It feels like they're dragging the story out without much happening.
🎧 I was worried that might happen after such a dramatic opening. Do you think it's worth continuing?
🎧 Maybe give it another episode or two. Sometimes shows have a midseason slump but pick up again towards the end.
🎧 True. I'll stick with it a bit longer then. It's a shame though. I had high hopes after the first few episodes.
🎧 Same here. Hopefully, the writers turn things around. Otherwise, it's just another series that had potential but couldn't keep up the pace.
🎧 I'll keep my fingers crossed. Maybe we can discuss it again once the season wraps up.
🎧 Sounds good. Let's hope for a strong finish.

Tip off - secretly inform or warn someone

🎧 Hey! Just a quick heads-up—I got tipped off that the main road is completely jammed because of the marathon today. You might want to take the back streets.
🎧 Oh, really? That's a great tip, thanks! I had no idea there was a marathon. How did you find out?
🎧 My brother's part of the event organizing team. He sent me a message early this morning so I could avoid the area. It's going to be chaotic all day.
🎧 Good to know. I'll reroute and go through Elm Street then. Did he mention anything about when it might clear up?
🎧 He expects it'll be busy till late afternoon. Everything should be back to normal by evening.
🎧 Perfect. I'll plan my day accordingly. I really appreciate the warning.

Iron out - remove difficulties or find solutions to a problem

🎧 Have you made any progress with planning the reunion?
🎧 A bit, but there are still a few issues we need to iron out before everything is set.
🎧 What kind of issues are you facing?
🎧 Mainly with the venue and catering. The original venue is double-booked, and the caterer just informed us they're unavailable on our date.
🎧 That sounds challenging. Have you found any alternatives?
🎧 We're looking into a couple of other venues nearby. As for catering, I'm thinking about reaching out to a few local restaurants to see if they can help.
🎧 That could work. If you need help contacting places or negotiating, let me know.
🎧 Thanks. I might take you up on that. Hopefully, we can iron out these details soon so we can focus on the fun stuff.
🎧 For sure. Once the main logistics are settled, the rest should fall into place.

Queue up - line up or arrange in a queue

🎧 Did you manage to get tickets for the concert next month?
🎧 Yes! I had to queue up online right when they went on sale. The website was so busy I thought I might miss out.
🎧 That sounds stressful. I'm glad you got them, though. How long did you have to wait?
🎧 It was about an hour of just refreshing the page and waiting in the digital queue. Everyone was trying to get the best seats.
🎧 An hour? That's dedication. I'm impressed. It must be a popular band.
🎧 They are, and it's their first tour after a long break, so the tickets were in high demand.
🎧 It'll be worth it, then. Who are you going with?
🎧 A couple of friends from college. We used to listen to this band all the time back then. We decided to queue up for tickets together, even though we were all on different computers.
🎧 Sounds like a mini-reunion. It's great that you all could coordinate like that.
🎧 Yeah, we're all looking forward to it. It should be a memorable night.

Face up to - accept and deal with a difficult reality

🎧 Have you talked to your landlord about the rent increase yet?
🎧 Not yet. I've been trying to avoid it, but I know I need to face up to it soon.
🎧 It's tough, but the sooner you address it, the better. What are your options?
🎧 I guess I could try negotiating a smaller increase or look for a cheaper place. Neither option is ideal, though.
🎧 Negotiating might be worth a shot. Maybe your landlord would be willing to compromise.
🎧 True. I'll need to gather some information first, like rental prices in the area, to make a strong case.
🎧 That sounds like a good plan. It shows you're serious and informed.
🎧 Yeah, I just need to face up to the conversation. Once I do, I'll feel better about whatever happens.
🎧 Exactly. It's always better to confront these things head-on. Let me know how it goes.

Gear down - reduce in speed or intensity

🎧 I've been thinking about our weekly routine, and I feel like we might need to gear down a bit. It's been non-stop lately.
🎧 I agree. It's been quite hectic with all the activities and commitments we've packed into our schedule.
🎧 What if we limit our evening engagements? Maybe just one or two nights a week instead of almost every night.
🎧 That sounds like a good plan. It would definitely help reduce the overall rush and give us more time to relax.
🎧 Exactly. We could use that extra time at home to unwind, maybe read more or just enjoy some quiet evenings.
🎧 I'd love that. It might also be nice to spend more time cooking together instead of always grabbing something on the go.
🎧 Perfect. Let's start this week. We can pick the nights we stay out based on what we really don't want to miss and keep the rest free.
🎧 I'm looking forward to this change. It'll be a nice pace adjustment.

Ease into - gradually start or adjust to a new situation

🎧 I heard you started a new job recently. How's it going so far?
🎧 It's going well, thanks. I'm trying to ease into the new role. It's a bit different from what I'm used to, but I'm getting the hang of it.
🎧 That's good to hear. What's the biggest adjustment you've had to make?
🎧 The pace is much faster here. I'm used to a more laid-back environment, so I've been taking it one step at a time to keep up.
🎧 Sounds like a smart approach. Have your colleagues been supportive?
🎧 Yes, they've been great. They've given me space to ease into things and offered help whenever I need it.
🎧 That makes a big difference. Do you feel like you're settling in now?
🎧 Slowly but surely. I think in a few more weeks I'll feel fully comfortable with everything.
🎧 That's good. It's important to take your time and not rush the process.

Add up - makes sense

🎧 I just read about that new tech startup. Some of their claims seem a bit over the top, don't you think?
🎧 Yeah, I saw that too. Their projected growth numbers... I'm not sure how they plan to achieve that so quickly.
🎧 Exactly. And their business model doesn't fully explain how they'll sustain such rapid expansion. Doesn't really add up to me.
🎧 Right. There might be some key details they haven't disclosed yet, or maybe it's just optimistic forecasting.
🎧 That could be. Have you looked into their funding? That might give us a better idea of their capabilities.
🎧 They've secured some solid venture capital, but even that doesn't seem enough for the scale they're talking about.
🎧 It's a puzzle, isn't it? We should keep an eye on their next moves. It'll be interesting to see if they adjust their strategy once they hit the market.
🎧 Definitely. Watching how new startups navigate these challenges is always insightful. We might even learn a thing or two for our own projects.
🎧 Agreed. It's one thing to have a vision; executing it is a whole other challenge.

Wear off - fade away

🎧 Have you noticed how quickly the excitement of buying something new wears off?
🎧 Absolutely. It's like one moment you're thrilled, and a week later, it just fades away. Same thing happened when I got my new phone.
🎧 Exactly. It's all exciting at first, but then it just becomes another thing you own. Do you think that's why people shop so much?
🎧 Probably. It's that initial rush. But it's interesting how the novelty wears off, but the bills don't fade away as quickly.
🎧 That's the truth. It makes you wonder if it's worth chasing those moments when the thrill is so temporary.
🎧 Maybe it's better to find excitement in experiences, not things. Those memories don't fade away as fast.
🎧 I agree. Next time, instead of buying the latest gadget, maybe I'll book a little trip somewhere.
🎧 Sounds like a plan. Experiences over possessions, right? They say that's the key to happiness.

Latch onto - attach oneself to an idea or person

🎧 Have you seen the latest documentary on climate change?
🎧 Yes, I watched it last night. It was really eye-opening.
🎧 I agree. It made me think a lot about our habits.
🎧 Same here. I've latched onto the idea of reducing my carbon footprint.
🎧 That's a great initiative. What changes are you planning to make?
🎧 I'm starting with simple things like using less plastic and conserving water.
🎧 Those are good steps. Have you thought about any bigger changes?
🎧 Yes, I'm considering switching to a plant-based diet and using public transport more often.
🎧 That's impressive. It's inspiring to see how you've latched onto these ideas.
🎧 Thanks. I feel like if everyone made small changes, it could add up to a big impact.
🎧 Absolutely. Every little bit helps. Maybe I should latch onto some of those ideas too.

Clear out - remove everything from a place

🎧 Did you hear about the renovation they're planning for the old library downtown?
🎧 No, I hadn't. What are they doing?
🎧 They're going to completely clear out the inside to modernize it. New furniture, new technology, even a new layout. It's supposed to make the space more usable for current needs.
🎧 That sounds like a massive project. Are they preserving any of the old features?
🎧 They plan to keep the exterior as is because of its historical significance, but inside it's going to be totally transformed. They want to incorporate more community spaces and tech-friendly areas.
🎧 I guess that makes sense, especially to attract younger crowds and keep up with digital trends. How long will it be closed?
🎧 It'll be closed for about a year. They need to clear out all the old shelving and seating first and then start with the tech upgrades and reconfiguration.
🎧 It's going to be worth it, though. Our town could really use a space that caters to a wider audience and embraces modern needs.
🎧 Absolutely. I'm looking forward to seeing how it turns out. It could really rejuvenate the downtown area.
