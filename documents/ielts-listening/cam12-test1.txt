[145] Cam12 - Test 1 - Part 1

🎧 Hi. Can I help you?
🎧 I'd like to find out if you have any excursions suitable for families.
🎧 Sure.
🎧 How about taking your family for a cruise?
🎧 We have a steamship that takes passengers out several times a day -
🎧 it's over 100 years old.
🎧 That sounds interesting.
🎧 How long is the trip?
🎧 About an hour and a half.
🎧 And don't forget to take pictures of the mountains.
🎧 They're all around you when you're on the boat and they look fantastic.
🎧 OK.
🎧 And I assume there's a café or something on board?
🎧 Sure. How old are your children?
🎧 Er, my daughter's fifteen and my son's seven.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Well, there are various things you can do once you've crossed the lake, to make a day of it.
🎧 One thing that's very popular is a visit to the Country Farm.
🎧 You're met off the boat by the farmer and he'll take you to the holding pens, where the sheep are kept.
🎧 Children love feeding them!
🎧 My son would love that.
🎧 He really likes animals.
🎧 Well, there's also a 40-minute trek round the farm on a horse, if he wants.
🎧 Do you think he'd manage it?
🎧 He hasn't done that before.
🎧 Sure. It's suitable for complete beginners.
🎧 Good.
🎧 And again, visitors are welcome to explore the farm on their own,
🎧 as long as they take care to close gates and so on.
🎧 There are some very beautiful gardens along the side of the lake which also belong to the farm -
🎧 they'll be just at their best now.
🎧 You could easily spend an hour or two there.
🎧 OK. Well that all sounds good.
🎧 And can we get lunch there?
🎧 You can, and it's very good, though it's not included in the basic cost.
🎧 You pay when you get there.
🎧 Right.
🎧 So is there anything else to do over on that side of the lake?
🎧 Well, what you can do is take a bike over on the ship and then go on a cycling trip.
🎧 There's a trail there called the Back Road -
🎧 you could easily spend three or four hours exploring it,
🎧 and the scenery's wonderful.
🎧 They'll give you a map when you get your ticket for the cruise -
🎧 there's no extra charge.
🎧 What's the trail like in terms of difficulty?
🎧 Quite challenging in places.
🎧 It wouldn't be suitable for your seven-year-old.
🎧 It needs someone who's got a bit more experience.
🎧 Well, my daughter loves cycling and so do I, so maybe the two of us could go,
🎧 and my wife and son could stay on the farm.
🎧 That might work out quite well.
🎧 But we don't have bikes here…
🎧 is there somewhere we could rent them?
🎧 Yes, there's a place here in the city.
🎧 It's called Ratchesons.
🎧 I'll just make a note of that...
🎧 er, how do you spell it?
🎧 RATCHESONS.
🎧 It's just by the cruise ship terminal.
🎧 OK.
🎧 You'd also need to pick up a repair kit for the bike from there to take along with you,
🎧 and you'd need to take along a snack and some water -
🎧 it'd be best to get those in the city.
🎧 Fine.
🎧 That shouldn't be a problem.
🎧 And I assume I can rent a helmet from the bike place?
🎧 Sure, you should definitely get that.
🎧 It's a great ride, but you want to be well prepared because it's very remote -
🎧 you won't see any shops round there, or anywhere to stay,
🎧 so you need to get back in time for the last boat.
🎧 Yeah. So what sort of prices are we looking at here?
🎧 Let's see, that'd be one adult and one child for the cruise with farm tour,
🎧 that's $117
🎧 and an adult and a child for the cruise only so that's $214 altogether.
🎧 Oh, wait a minute,
🎧 how old did you say your daughter was?
🎧 Fifteen.
🎧 Then I'm afraid it's $267
🎧 because she has to pay the adult fare, which is $75
🎧 instead of the child fare which is $22.
🎧 Sorry about that.
🎧 That's OK.

[146] Cam12 - Test 1 - Part 2

🎧 Good morning everyone.
🎧 My name's Joy Parkins and I'm the restaurant manager.
🎧 And I understand that none of you've had any previous experience as kitchen assistants?
🎧 Well, you might be feeling a bit nervous now,
🎧 but most of our kitchen assistants say they enjoy the work.
🎧 OK, they might get shouted at sometimes, but it's nothing personal,
🎧 and they're pleased that they have so many different things to do, which means they never get bored.
🎧 And I'll tell you straightaway that if you do well,
🎧 we might think about moving you up and giving you some more responsibility.
🎧 Right, well, you've all shown up on time, which is an excellent start.
🎧 Now I'm glad to see none of you have unsuitable footwear, so that's good -
🎧 you need to be careful as the floors can get very wet and slippery.
🎧 Those of you with long hair have got it well out of the way,
🎧 but some of you'll need to remove your rings and bracelets - just put them somewhere safe for today,
🎧 and remember to leave them at home tomorrow, as they can be a safety hazard.
🎧 Now it's going to be a busy day for you all today -
🎧 we don't have any tables free for this evening,
🎧 and only a few for lunch.
🎧 Fortunately we've got our Head Chef back -
🎧 he was away on holiday all last week which meant the other chefs had extra work.
🎧 Now, I'll tell you a bit more about the job in a minute
🎧 but first, some general regulations.
🎧 For all of you, whatever your age,
🎧 there's some equipment you mustn't use until you've been properly trained,
🎧 like the waste disposal system for example,
🎧 for health and safety reasons.
🎧 Then I think there are two of you here who are under 18 -
🎧 that's Emma and Jake, isn't it?
🎧 Right, so for you two, the meat slicer is out of bounds.
🎧 And of course none of you are allowed to use the electric mixer
🎧 until you've been shown how it works.
🎧 Now you may have heard that this can be a stressful job,
🎧 and I have to say that can be true.
🎧 You'll be working an eight-hour day for the first week,
🎧 though you'll have the chance to do overtime after that as well if you want to.
🎧 But however long the hours are, you'll get a break in the middle.
🎧 What you will find is that you're on your feet all day long, lifting and carrying,
🎧 so if you're not fit now you soon will be!
🎧 You'll find you don't have much chance to take it easy -
🎧 when someone tells you to do something you need to do it straightaway -
🎧 but at least we do have a very efficient air conditioning system compared with some kitchens.
🎧 Now let me tell you about some of the people you need to know.
🎧 So as I said, I'm Joy Parkins
🎧 and I decide who does what during the day and how long they work for.
🎧 I'll be trying to get you to work with as many different people in the kitchen as possible,
🎧 so that you learn while you're on the job.
🎧 One person whose name you must remember is David Field.
🎧 If you injure yourself at all, even if it's really minor,
🎧 you must report to him and he'll make sure the incident is recorded
🎧 and you get the appropriate treatment.
🎧 He's trained to give basic treatment to staff himself,
🎧 or he'll send you off somewhere else if necessary.
🎧 Then there's Dexter Wills -
🎧 he's the person you need to see if you smash a plate or something like that.
🎧 Don't just leave it and hope no one will notice -
🎧 it's really important to get things noted and replaced or there could be problems later.
🎧 And finally, there's Mike Smith.
🎧 He's the member of staff who takes care of all the stores of perishables,
🎧 so if you notice we're getting low in flour or sugar or something,
🎧 make sure you let him know so he can put in an order.
🎧 OK, now the next thing…

[147] Cam12 - Test 1 - Part 3

🎧 OK, Stewart. We need to start planning our paper on public libraries.
🎧 Have you thought of an angle yet?
🎧 Well, there's so much we could look into.
🎧 How libraries have changed over the centuries, for instance, or...
🎧 how different countries organise them.
🎧 What do you think, Trudie?
🎧 Maybe we should concentrate on this country, and try and relate the changes in libraries to external developments,
🎧 like the fact that far more people can read than a century ago,
🎧 and that the local population may speak lots of different languages.
🎧 We could include something about changes in the source of funding, too.
🎧 Yes, but remember we're only supposed to write a short paper,
🎧 so it's probably best if we don't go into funding in any detail.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Well, shall we just brainstorm a few ideas, to get started?
🎧 OK.
🎧 We obviously need to look at the impact of new technology, particularly the internet.
🎧 Now that lots of books have been digitalised, people can access them from their own computers at home.
🎧 And if everyone did that, libraries would be obsolete.
🎧 Yes.
🎧 But the digitalised books that are available online for free are mostly out of copyright, aren't they?
🎧 And copyright in this country lasts for 70 years after the author dies.
🎧 So you won't find the latest best-seller or up-to-date information.
🎧 That's an important point.
🎧 Anyway, I find it hard to concentrate when I'm reading a long text on a screen.
🎧 I'd much rather read a physical book.
🎧 And it takes longer to read on a screen.
🎧 Oh, I prefer it.
🎧 I suppose it's just a personal preference.
🎧 I expect that libraries will go on evolving in the next few years.
🎧 Some have already become centres where community activities take place,
🎧 like local clubs meeting there.
🎧 I think that'll become even more common.
🎧 I'd like to think so,
🎧 and that they'll still be serving their traditional function, but I'm not so sure.
🎧 There are financial implications, after all.
🎧 What I'm afraid will happen is that books and magazines will all disappear, and there'll just be rows and rows of computers.
🎧 They won't look anything like the libraries we're used to.
🎧 Well, we'll see.
🎧 I've just had an idea.
🎧 Why don't we make an in-depth study of our local public library as background to our paper?
🎧 Yes, that'd be interesting, and raise all sorts of issues.
🎧 Let's make a list of possible things we could ask about,
🎧 then work out some sort of structure.
🎧 For instance, um, we could interview some of the staff,
🎧 and find out whether the library has its own budget, or if that's controlled by the local council.
🎧 And what their policies are.
🎧 I know they don't allow food,
🎧 but I'd love to find out what types of noise they ban -
🎧 there always seems to be a lot of talking, but never music.
🎧 I don't know if that's a policy or it just happens.
🎧 Ah, I've often wondered.
🎧 Then there are things like how the library is affected by employment laws.
🎧 I suppose there are rules about working hours, facilities for staff, and so on.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Then there are other issues relating to the design of the building and how customers use it.
🎧 Like what measures does the library take to ensure their safety?
🎧 They'd need floor coverings that aren't slippery, and emergency exits, for instance.
🎧 Oh, and another thing -
🎧 there's the question of the kind of insurance the library needs to have, in case anyone gets injured.
🎧 Yes, that's something else to find out.
🎧 You know something I've often wondered?
🎧 What's that?
🎧 Well, you know they've got an archive of local newspapers going back years?
🎧 Well, next to it they've got the diary of a well-known politician from the late 19th century.
🎧 I wonder why it's there.
🎧 Do you know what his connection was with this area?
🎧 No idea.
🎧 Let's add it to our list of things to find out.
🎧 Oh, I've just thought -
🎧 you know people might ask in the library about local organisations, like sports clubs?
🎧 Well, I wonder if they keep a database, or whether they just look online.
🎧 Right.
🎧 I quite fancy finding out what the differences are between a library that's open to the public
🎧 and one that's part of a museum, for example -
🎧 they must be very different.
🎧 Then something else I'd like to know is…

[148] Cam12 - Test 1 - Part 4

🎧 In public discussion of business, we take certain values for granted.
🎧 Today I'm going to talk about four of them:
🎧 collaboration, hard work, creativity and excellence.
🎧 Most people would say they're all 'good things'.
🎧 I'm going to suggest that's an over-simple view.
🎧 The trouble with these values is that they're theoretical concepts,
🎧 removed from the reality of day-to-day business.
🎧 Pursue values by all means,
🎧 but be prepared for what may happen as a result.
🎧 They can actually cause damage, which is not at all the intention.
🎧 Business leaders generally try to do the right thing.
🎧 But all too often the right thing backfires,
🎧 if those leaders adopt values without understanding and managing the side effects that arise.
🎧 The values can easily get in the way of what's actually intended.
🎧 OK. So the first value I'm going to discuss is collaboration.
🎧 Er, let me give you an example.
🎧 On a management training course I once attended,
🎧 we were put into groups and had to construct a bridge across a stream,
🎧 using building blocks that we were given.
🎧 The rule was that everyone in the team had to move at least one building block during the construction.
🎧 This was intended to encourage teamwork.
🎧 But it was really a job best done by one person.
🎧 The other teams tried to collaborate on building the structure,
🎧 and descended into confusion, with everyone getting in each other's way.
🎧 Our team leader solved the challenge brilliantly.
🎧 She simply asked everyone in the team to move a piece a few centimetres, to comply with the rule,
🎧 and then let the person in the team with an aptitude for puzzles like this build it alone.
🎧 We finished before any other team.
🎧 My point is that the task wasn't really suited to teamworking,
🎧 so why make it one?
🎧 Teamwork can also lead to inconsistency - a common cause of poor sales.
🎧 In the case of a smartphone that a certain company launched,
🎧 one director wanted to target the business market,
🎧 and another demanded it was aimed at consumers.
🎧 The company wanted both directors to be involved,
🎧 so gave the product a consumer-friendly name,
🎧 but marketed it to companies.
🎧 The result was that it met the needs of neither group.
🎧 It would have been better to let one director or the other have his way,
🎧 not both.
🎧 Now industriousness, or hard work.
🎧 It's easy to mock people who say they work hard:
🎧 after all, a hamster running around in a wheel is working hard - and getting nowhere.
🎧 Of course hard work is valuable, but only when properly targeted.
🎧 Otherwise it wastes the resources that companies value most: time and energy.
🎧 And that's bad for the organisation.
🎧 There's a management model that groups people according to four criteria:
🎧 clever, hard-working, stupid and lazy.
🎧 Here 'lazy' means having a rational determination not to carry out unnecessary tasks.
🎧 It doesn't mean trying to avoid work altogether.
🎧 Most people display two of these characteristics,
🎧 and the most valuable people are those who are both clever and lazy:
🎧 they possess intellectual clarity, and they don't rush into making decisions.
🎧 They come up with solutions to save the time and energy spent by the stupid and hard-working group.
🎧 Instead of throwing more man-hours at a problem,
🎧 the clever and lazy group looks for a more effective solution.
🎧 Next we come to creativity.
🎧 This often works well - creating an attention-grabbing TV commercial, for example,
🎧 might lead to increased sales.
🎧 But it isn't always a good thing.
🎧 Some advertising campaigns are remembered for their creativity,
🎧 without having any effect on sales.
🎧 This happened a few years ago with the launch of a chocolate bar:
🎧 subsequent research showed that plenty of consumers remembered the adverts,
🎧 but had no idea what was being advertised.
🎧 The trouble is that the creator derives pleasure from coming up with the idea,
🎧 and wrongly assumes the audience for the campaign will share that feeling.
🎧 A company that brings out thousands of new products may seem more creative than a company that only has a few,
🎧 but it may be too creative, and make smaller profits.
🎧 Creativity needs to be targeted, to solve a problem that the company has identified.
🎧 Just coming up with more and more novel products isn't necessarily a good thing.
🎧 And finally, excellence.
🎧 We all know companies that claim they 'strive for excellence',
🎧 but it takes a long time to achieve excellence.
🎧 In business, being first with a product is more profitable than having the best product.
🎧 A major study of company performance compared pioneers -
🎧 that is, companies bringing out the first version of a particular product -
🎧 with followers, the companies that copied and improved on that product.
🎧 The study found that the pioneers commanded an average market share of 29%,
🎧 while the followers achieved less than half that, only 13% -
🎧 even though their product might have been better.
🎧 Insisting on excellence in everything we do is time-consuming, wastes energy
🎧 and leads to losing out on opportunities.
🎧 Sometimes, second-rate work is more worthwhile than excellence.
🎧 'Make sure it's excellent' sounds like a good approach to business,
🎧 but the 'just-get-started' approach is likely to be more successful.
