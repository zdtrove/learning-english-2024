🎧 Hello, South City Cycling Club.
🎧 Oh, hi.
🎧 I want to find out about joining the club.
🎧 Right. I can help you there.
🎧 I'm the club secretary and my name's Jim Hunter.
🎧 Oh, hi Jim.
🎧 So, are you interested in membership for yourself?
🎧 That's right.
🎧 OK. Well there are basically two types of adult membership.
🎧 If you're pretty serious about cycling, there's the Full membership.
🎧 That costs $260
🎧 and that covers you not just for ordinary cycling
🎧 but also for races both here in the city and also in other parts of Australia.
🎧 Right. Well, I'm not really up to that standard.
🎧 I was more interested in just joining a group to do some cycling in my free time.
🎧 Sure.
🎧 That's why most people join.
🎧 So, in that case you'd be better with the Recreational membership.
🎧 That's $108 if you're over 19, and $95 if you're under.
🎧 I'm 25.
🎧 OK.
🎧 It's paid quarterly, and you can upgrade it later to the Full membership if you want to, of course.
🎧 Now both types of membership include the club fee of $20.
🎧 They also provide insurance in case you have an accident, though we hope you won't need that, of course.
🎧 No.
🎧 OK, well, I'll go with the Recreational membership, I think.
🎧 And that allows me to join in the club activities, and so on?
🎧 That's right.
🎧 And once you're a member of the club, you're also permitted to wear our kit when you're out cycling.
🎧 It's green and white.
🎧 Yes, I've seen cyclists wearing it.
🎧 So, can I buy that at the club?
🎧 Ah.. no, it's made to order by a company in Brisbane.
🎧 You can find them online: they're called Jerriz.
🎧 That's J-E-R-R-I-Z.
🎧 You can use your membership number to put in an order on their website.
🎧 OK.
🎧 Now, can you tell me a bit about the rides I can do?
🎧 Sure.
🎧 So we have training rides pretty well every morning,
🎧 and they're a really good way of improving your cycling skills as well as your general level of fitness,
🎧 but they're different levels.
🎧 Level A is pretty fast - you're looking at about 30 or 35 kilometres an hour.
🎧 If you can do about 25 kilometres an hour, you'd probably be level B,
🎧 and then level C are the novices, who stay at about 15 kilometres per hour.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Well I reckon I'd be level B.
🎧 So, when are the sessions for that level?
🎧 Ah... there are a couple each week.
🎧 They're both early morning sessions.
🎧 There's one on Tuesdays, and for that one you meet at 5.30 am,
🎧 and the meeting point's the stadium.
🎧 Do you know where that is?
🎧 Yes, it's quite near my home, in fact.
🎧 OK, and how about the other one?
🎧 That's on Thursdays.
🎧 It starts at the same time, but they meet at the main gate to the park.
🎧 Is that the one just past the shopping mall?
🎧 That's it.
🎧 So how long are the rides?
🎧 Ah.. they're about an hour and a half.
🎧 So, if you have a job it's easy to fit in before you go to work.
🎧 And the members often go somewhere for coffee afterwards, so it's quite a social event.
🎧 OK. That sounds good.
🎧 I've only just moved to the city so I don't actually know many people yet.
🎧 Well, it's a great way to meet people.
🎧 And does each ride have a leader?
🎧 Sometimes, but not always.
🎧 But you don't really need one; the group members on the ride support one another, anyway.
🎧 How would we know where to go?
🎧 If you check the club website, you'll see that the route for each ride is clearly marked.
🎧 So you can just print that out and take it along with you.
🎧 It's similar from one week to another, but it's not always exactly the same.
🎧 And what do I need to bring?
🎧 Well, bring a bottle of water, and your phone.
🎧 You shouldn't use it while you're cycling, but have it with you.
🎧 Right.
🎧 And in winter, it's well before sunrise when we set out,
🎧 so you need to make sure your bike's got lights.
🎧 That's OK.
🎧 Well, thanks Jim. I'd definitely like to join.
🎧 So what's the best way of going about it?
🎧 Ah.. you can…
🎧 
🎧 Thanks for coming everyone.
🎧 OK, so this meeting is for new staff and staff who haven't been involved with our volunteering projects yet.
🎧 So basically, the idea is that we allow staff to give up some of their work time
🎧 to help on various charity projects to benefit the local community.
🎧 We've been doing this for the last five years and it's been very successful.
🎧 Participating doesn't necessarily involve a huge time commitment.
🎧 The company will pay for eight hours of your time.
🎧 That can be used over one or two days all at once,
🎧 or spread over several months throughout the year.
🎧 There are some staff who enjoy volunteering so much
🎧 they also give up their own free time for a couple of hours every week.
🎧 It's completely up to you.
🎧 Obviously, many people will have family commitments and aren't as available as other members of staff.
🎧 Feedback from staff has been overwhelmingly positive.
🎧 Because they felt they were doing something really useful,
🎧 nearly everyone agreed that volunteering made them feel more motivated at work.
🎧 They also liked building relationships with the people in the local community and felt valued by them.
🎧 One or two people also said it was a good thing to have on their CVs.
🎧 One particularly successful project last year was the Get Working Project.
🎧 This was aimed at helping unemployed people in the area get back to work.
🎧 Our staff were able to help them improve their telephone skills,
🎧 such as writing down messages and speaking with confidence to potential customers,
🎧 which they had found quite difficult.
🎧 This is something many employers look for in job applicants -
🎧 and something we all do without even thinking about, every day at work.
🎧 We've got an exciting new project starting this year.
🎧 Up until now, we've mainly focused on projects to do with education and training.
🎧 And we'll continue with our reading project in schools and our work with local charities.
🎧 But we've also agreed to help out on a conservation project in Redfern Park.
🎧 So if any of you fancy being outside and getting your hands dirty, this is the project for you.
🎧 I also want to mention the annual Digital Inclusion Day, which is coming up next month.
🎧 The aim of this is to help older people keep up with technology.
🎧 And this year, instead of hosting the event in our own training facility,
🎧 we're using the ICT suite at Hill College,
🎧 as it can hold far more people.
🎧 We've invited over 60 people from the Silver Age Community Centre to take part,
🎧 so we'll need a lot of volunteers to help with this event.
🎧 If you're interested in taking part,
🎧 please go to the volunteering section of our website and complete the relevant form.
🎧 We won't be providing any training for this
🎧 but you'll be paired with an experienced volunteer if you've never done it before.
🎧 By the way, don't forget to tell your manager about any volunteering activities you decide to do.
🎧 The participants on the Digital Inclusion Day really benefited.
🎧 The majority were in their seventies,
🎧 though some were younger and a few were even in their nineties!
🎧 Quite a few owned both a computer and a mobile phone,
🎧 but these tended to be outdated models.
🎧 They generally knew how to do simple things, like send texts,
🎧 but weren't aware of recent developments in mobile phone technology.
🎧 A few were keen to learn but most were quite dismissive at first -
🎧 they couldn't see the point of updating their skills.
🎧 But that soon changed.
🎧 The feedback was very positive.
🎧 The really encouraging thing was that participants all said
🎧 they felt much more confident about using social media to keep in touch with their grandchildren,
🎧 who prefer this form of communication to phoning or sending emails.
🎧 A lot of them also said playing online games would help them make new friends and keep their brains active.
🎧 They weren't that impressed with being able to order their groceries online,
🎧 as they liked going out to the shops,
🎧 but some said it would come in handy if they were ill or the weather was really bad.
🎧 One thing they asked about was using tablets for things like reading newspapers -
🎧 some people had been given tablets as presents but had never used them,
🎧 so that's something we'll make sure we include this time…
🎧 
🎧 Ah… come in, Russ.
🎧 Thank you.
🎧 Now you wanted to consult me about your class presentation on nanotechnology -
🎧 you're due to give it in next week, aren't you?
🎧 That's right. And I'm really struggling.
🎧 I chose the topic because I didn't know much about it and wanted to learn more,
🎧 but now I've read so much about it, in a way there's too much to say -
🎧 I could talk for much longer than the twenty minutes I've been allocated.
🎧 Should I assume the other students don't know much, and give them a kind of general introduction,
🎧 or should I try and make them share my fascination with a particular aspect?
🎧 You could do either,
🎧 but you'll need to have it clear in your own mind.
🎧 Then I think I'll give an overview.
🎧 OK.
🎧 Now, one way of approaching this is to work through developments in chronological order.
🎧 On the other hand, you could talk about the numerous ways that nanotechnology is being applied.
🎧 You mean things like thin films on camera displays to make them water-repellent,
🎧 and additives to make motorcycle helmets stronger and lighter.
🎧 Exactly.
🎧 Or another way would be to focus on its impact in one particular area,
🎧 say medicine, or space exploration.
🎧 That would make it easier to focus.
🎧 Perhaps I should do that.
🎧 I think that would be a good idea.
🎧 Right.
🎧 How important is it to include slides in the presentation?
🎧 They aren't essential, by any means.
🎧 And there's a danger of tailoring what you say to fit whatever slides you can find.
🎧 While it can be good to include slides,
🎧 you could end up spending too long looking for suitable ones.
🎧 You might find it better to leave them out.
🎧 I see.
🎧 Another thing I was wondering about was how to start.
🎧 I know presentations often begin with
🎧 'First I'm going to talk about this, and then I'll talk about that',
🎧 but I thought about asking the audience what they know about nanotechnology.
🎧 That would be fine if you had an hour or two for the presentation,
🎧 but you might find that you can't do anything with the answers you get,
🎧 and it simply eats into the short time that's available.
🎧 So, maybe I should mention a particular way that nanotechnology is used, to focus people's attention.
🎧 That sounds sensible.
🎧 What do you think I should do next?
🎧 I really have to plan the presentation today and tomorrow.
🎧 Well, initially I think you should ignore all the notes you've made,
🎧 take a small piece of paper, and write a single short sentence that ties together the whole presentation:
🎧 it can be something as simple as 'Nanotechnology is already improving our lives'.
🎧 Then start planning the content around that.
🎧 You can always modify that sentence later, if you need to.
🎧 OK.
🎧 OK, now let's think about actually giving the presentation.
🎧 You've only given one before, if I remember correctly,
🎧 about an experiment you'd been involved in.
🎧 That's right.
🎧 It was pretty rubbish!
🎧 Let's say it was better in some respects than in others.
🎧 With regard to the structure.
🎧 I felt that you ended rather abruptly, without rounding it off.
🎧 Be careful not to do that in next week's presentation.
🎧 OK.
🎧 And you made very little eye contact with the audience,
🎧 because you were looking down at your notes most of the time.
🎧 You need to be looking at the audience and only occasionally glancing at your notes.
🎧 Your body language was a little odd.
🎧 Every time you showed a slide, you turned your back on the audience so you could look at it -
🎧 you should have been looking at your laptop.
🎧 And you kept scratching your head,
🎧 so I found myself wondering when you were next going to do that,
🎧 instead of listening to what you were saying!
🎧 Oh dear.
🎧 What did you think of the language?
🎧 I knew that not everyone was familiar with the subject,
🎧 so I tried to make it as simple as I could.
🎧 Yes, that came across.
🎧 You used a few words that are specific to the field,
🎧 but you always explained what they meant,
🎧 so the audience wouldn't have had any difficulty understanding.
🎧 I must say the handouts you prepared were well thought out.
🎧 They were a good summary of your presentation,
🎧 which people would have been able to refer to later on.
🎧 So well done on that.
🎧 Thank you.
🎧 Well, I hope that helps you with next week's presentation.
🎧 Yes, it will. Thanks a lot.
🎧 I'll look forward to seeing a big improvement, then.
🎧 
🎧 Today, we'll be continuing the series of lectures on memory
🎧 by focusing on what is called episodic memory
🎧 and what can happen if this is not working properly.
🎧 Episodic memory refers to the memory of an event or 'episode'.
🎧 Episodic memories allow us to mentally travel back in time to an event from the past.
🎧 Episodic memories include various details about these events,
🎧 for example, when an event happened
🎧 and other information such as the location.
🎧 To help understand this concept,
🎧 try to remember the last time you ate dinner at a restaurant.
🎧 The ability to remember where you ate,
🎧 who you were with and the items you ordered are all features of an episodic memory.
🎧 Episodic memory is distinct from another type of memory called semantic memory.
🎧 This is the type of factual memory that we have in common with everyone else -
🎧 that is your general knowledge of the world.
🎧 To build upon a previous example,
🎧 remembering where you parked your car is an example of episodic memory,
🎧 but your understanding of what a car is
🎧 and how an engine works are examples of semantic memory.
🎧 Unlike episodic memory, semantic memory isn't dependent on recalling personal experiences.
🎧 Episodic memory can be thought of as a process with several different steps of memory processing:
🎧 encoding, consolidation and retrieval.
🎧 The initial step is called encoding.
🎧 This involves the process of receiving and registering information,
🎧 which is necessary for creating memories of information or events that you experience.
🎧 The degree to which you can successfully encode information
🎧 depends on the level of attention you give to an event while it's actually happening.
🎧 Being distracted can make effective encoding very difficult.
🎧 Encoding of episodic memories is also influenced by how you process the event.
🎧 For example, if you were introduced to someone called Charlie,
🎧 you might make the connection that your uncle has the same name.
🎧 Future recollection of Charlie's name is much easier
🎧 if you have a strategy to help you encode it.
🎧 Memory consolidation, the next step in forming an episodic memory,
🎧 is the process by which memories of encoded information are strengthened,
🎧 stabilised and stored to facilitate later retrieval.
🎧 Consolidation is most effective when the information being stored
🎧 can be linked to an existing network of information.
🎧 Consolidation makes it possible for you to store memories for later retrieval indefinitely.
🎧 Forming strong memories depends on the frequency with which you try to retrieve them.
🎧 Memories can fade or become harder to retrieve if they aren't used very often.
🎧 The last step in forming episodic memories is called retrieval,
🎧 which is the conscious recollection of encoded information.
🎧 Retrieving information from episodic memory depends upon
🎧 semantic, olfactory, auditory and visual factors.
🎧 These help episodic memory retrieval by acting as a prompt.
🎧 For example, when recalling where you parked your car
🎧 you may use the colour of a sign close to where you parked.
🎧 You actually have to mentally travel back to the moment you parked.
🎧 There are a wide range of neurological diseases
🎧 and conditions that can affect episodic memory.
🎧 These range from Alzheimer's to schizophrenia to autism.
🎧 An impairment of episodic memory can have a profound effect on individuals' lives.
🎧 For example, the symptoms of schizophrenia can be reasonably well controlled by medication;
🎧 however, patients' episodic memory may still be impaired
🎧 and so they are often unable to return to university or work.
🎧 Recent studies have shown that computer-assisted games designed to keep the brain active
🎧 can help improve their episodic memory.
🎧 Episodic memories can help people connect with others,
🎧 for instance by sharing intimate details about their past;
🎧 something individuals with autism often have problems with.
🎧 This may be caused by an absence of a sense of self.
🎧 This is essential for the storage of episodic memory,
🎧 and has been found to be impaired in children with autism.
🎧 Research has shown that treatments that improve memory
🎧 may also have a positive impact on children's social development.
