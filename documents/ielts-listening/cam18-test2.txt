🎧 So, I understand you're interested in restaurant work?
🎧 Yes. I've got a bit of experience and I can provide references.
🎧 That's good. I can check all that later.
🎧 Now, Milo's Restaurants have some vacancies at the moment.
🎧 They're a really good company to work for.
🎧 Lots of benefits.
🎧 Oh right.
🎧 Yes. They've got a very good reputation for looking after staff.
🎧 For example, all employees get training, even temporary staff.
🎧 Oh really? That's quite unusual, isn't it?
🎧 Certainly is.
🎧 And do staff get free uniforms too?
🎧 Um... you just need to wear a white T-shirt and black trousers, it says here.
🎧 So I guess not...
🎧 But another benefit of working for a big company like this
🎧 is that you can get a discount at any of their restaurants.
🎧 Even at weekends?
🎧 No, but you'll be working then anyway.
🎧 Oh yes. I suppose so.
🎧 Um... most of their restaurants are in the city centre, aren't they?
🎧 So, easy to get to by bus?
🎧 Yes. That's right.
🎧 But if you have to do a late shift and finish work after midnight,
🎧 the company will pay for you to get a taxi home.
🎧 I probably won't need one. I think I'd use my bike.
🎧 OK.
🎧 Now, they do have some quite specific requirements for the kind of person they're looking for.
🎧 Milo's is a young, dynamic company
🎧 and they're really keen on creating a strong team.
🎧 It's really important that you can fit in and get on well with everyone.
🎧 Yeah. I've got no problem with that.
🎧 It sounds good, actually.
🎧 The last place I worked for was quite demanding too.
🎧 We had to make sure we gave a really high level of service.
🎧 That's good to hear because that will be equally important at Milo's.
🎧 I know they want people who have an eye for detail.
🎧 That's fine. I'm very used to working in that kind of environment.
🎧 Perfect.
🎧 So the only other thing that's required is good communication skills,
🎧 so you'll need to have a certificate in English.
🎧 Sure.
🎧 OK. Let's have a look at the current job vacancies at Milo's.
🎧 The first one is in Wivenhoe Street.
🎧 Sorry, where?
🎧 Wivenhoe.
🎧 W-I-V-E-N-H-O-E.
🎧 It's quite central, just off Cork Street.
🎧 Oh right.
🎧 They're looking for a breakfast supervisor.
🎧 That would be OK.
🎧 So you're probably familiar with the kind of responsibilities involved.
🎧 Obviously checking that all the portions are correct, etc.,
🎧 and then things like checking all the procedures for cleaning the equipment are being followed.
🎧 OK.
🎧 And what about the salary?
🎧 In my last job I was getting £9.50 per hour.
🎧 I was hoping to get a bit more than that.
🎧 Well, to begin with, you'd be getting £9.75
🎧 but that goes up to £11.25 after three months.
🎧 That's not too bad.
🎧 And I suppose it's a very early start?
🎧 That's the only unattractive thing about this job.
🎧 But then you have the afternoons and evenings free.
🎧 So the restaurant starts serving breakfast from 7 a.m.
🎧 And you'd have to be there at 5.30 to set everything up.
🎧 But you'd be finished at 12.30.
🎧 Well, as you say, there are advantages to that.
🎧 Now, you might also be interested in the job at the City Road branch.
🎧 That's for a junior chef, so again a position of responsibility.
🎧 I might prefer that, actually.
🎧 Right, well obviously this role would involve supporting the sous chef and other senior staff.
🎧 And you'd be responsible for making sure there's enough stock each week
🎧 and sorting out all the deliveries.
🎧 I've never done that before,
🎧 but I imagine it's fairly straightforward, once you get the hang of it.
🎧 Yes, and you'd be working alongside more experienced staff to begin with,
🎧 so I'm sure it wouldn't be a problem.
🎧 The salary's slightly higher here.
🎧 It's an annual salary of £23,000.
🎧 Right.
🎧 I know that if they like you, it's likely you'll be promoted quite quickly.
🎧 So that's worth thinking about.
🎧 Yes. It does sound interesting.
🎧 What are the hours like?
🎧 The usual, I think.
🎧 There's a lot of evening and weekend work, but they're closed on Mondays.
🎧 But you do get one Sunday off every four weeks.
🎧 So would you like me to send off your...
🎧 
🎧 Hello everyone.
🎧 It's good to see that so many members of the public have shown up for our presentation
🎧 on the new housing development planned on the outskirts of Nunston.
🎧 I'm Mark Reynolds and I'm Communications Manager at the development.
🎧 I'll start by giving you a brief overview of our plans for the development.
🎧 So one thing I'm sure you'll want to know is why we've selected this particular site for a housing development.
🎧 At present it's being used for farming,
🎧 like much of the land around Nunston.
🎧 But because of the new industrial centre in Nunston,
🎧 there's a lot of demand for housing for employees in the region,
🎧 as many employees are having to commute long distances at present.
🎧 Of course, there's also the fact that we have an international airport just 20 minutes' drive away,
🎧 but although that's certainly convenient,
🎧 it wasn't one of our major criteria for choosing the site.
🎧 We were more interested in the fact that there's an excellent hospital just 15 kilometres away,
🎧 and a large secondary school even closer than that.
🎧 One drawback to the site is that it's on quite a steep slope,
🎧 but we've taken account of that in our planning
🎧 so it shouldn't be a major problem.
🎧 We've had a lot of positive feedback about the plans.
🎧 People like the wide variety of accommodation types and prices,
🎧 and the fact that it's only a short drive to get out into the countryside from the development.
🎧 We were particularly pleased that so many people liked the designs for the layout of the development,
🎧 with the majority of people saying it generally made a good impression
🎧 and blended in well with the natural features of the landscape,
🎧 with provision made for protecting trees and wildlife on the site.
🎧 Some people have mentioned that they'd like to see more facilities for cyclists,
🎧 and we'll look at that,
🎧 but the overall feedback has been that the design and facilities of the development
🎧 make it seem a place where people of all ages can live together happily.
🎧 OK. So I'll put a map of the proposed development up on the screen.
🎧 You'll see it's bounded on the south side by the main road,
🎧 which then goes on to Nunston.
🎧 Another boundary is formed by London Road, on the western side of the development.
🎧 Inside the development, there'll be about 400 houses and 3 apartment blocks.
🎧 There'll also be a school for children up to 11 years old.
🎧 If you look at the South Entrance at the bottom of the map,
🎧 there's a road from there that goes right up through the development.
🎧 The school will be on that road, at the corner of the second turning to the left.
🎧 A large sports centre is planned with facilities for indoor and outdoor activities.
🎧 This will be on the western side of the development,
🎧 just below the road that branches off from London Road.
🎧 There'll be a clinic where residents can go if they have any health problems.
🎧 Can you see the lake towards the top of the map?
🎧 The clinic will be just below this, to the right of a street of houses.
🎧 There'll also be a community centre for people of all ages.
🎧 On the northeast side of the development,
🎧 there'll be a row of specially designed houses specifically for residents over 65.
🎧 And the community centre will be adjoining this.
🎧 We haven't forgotten about shopping.
🎧 There'll be a supermarket between the two entrances to the development.
🎧 We're planning to leave the three large trees near London Road,
🎧 and it'll be just to the south of these.
🎧 It's planned to have a playground for younger children.
🎧 If you look at the road that goes up from the South Entrance,
🎧 you'll see it curves round to the left at the top,
🎧 and the playground will be in that curve, with nice views of the lake.
🎧 OK, so now...
🎧 
🎧 So, Michelle, shall we make a start on our presentation?
🎧 We haven't got that much time left.
🎧 No, Adam.
🎧 But at least we've done all the background reading.
🎧 I found it really interesting.
🎧 I'd never even heard of the Laki eruption before this.
🎧 Me neither.
🎧 I suppose 1783 is a long time ago.
🎧 But it was a huge eruption
🎧 and it had such devastating consequences.
🎧 I know.
🎧 It was great there were so many primary sources to look at.
🎧 It really gives you a sense of how catastrophic the volcano was.
🎧 People were really trying to make sense of the science for the first time.
🎧 That's right.
🎧 But what I found more significant was how it impacted directly and indirectly on political events,
🎧 as well as having massive social and economic consequences.
🎧 I know.
🎧 That should be the main focus of our presentation.
🎧 The observations made by people at the time were interesting, weren't they?
🎧 I mean, they all gave a pretty consistent account of what happened,
🎧 even if they didn't always use the same terminology.
🎧 Yeah.
🎧 I was surprised there were so many weather stations established by that time,
🎧 so, you know, you can see how the weather changed, often by the hour.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Writers at the time talked about the Laki haze to describe the volcanic fog that spread across Europe.
🎧 They all realised that this wasn't the sort of fog they were used to,
🎧 and of course this was in pre-industrial times,
🎧 so they hadn't experienced sulphur-smelling fog before.
🎧 No, that's true.
🎧 Reports from the period blamed the haze for an increase in headaches,
🎧 respiratory issues and asthma attacks.
🎧 And they all describe how it covered the sun and made it look a strange red colour.
🎧 Must have been very weird.
🎧 It's interesting that Benjamin Franklin wrote about the haze.
🎧 Did you read that?
🎧 He was the American ambassador in Paris at the time.
🎧 Yeah.
🎧 At first no one realised that the haze was caused by the volcanic eruption in Iceland.
🎧 It was Benjamin Franklin who realised that before anyone else.
🎧 He's often credited with that, apparently.
🎧 But a French naturalist beat him to it. I can't remember his name.
🎧 I'd have to look it up.
🎧 Then other naturalists had the same idea,
🎧 all independently of each other.
🎧 Oh right.
🎧 We should talk about the immediate impact of the eruption, which was obviously enormous,
🎧 especially in Iceland, where so many people died.
🎧 You'd expect that.
🎧 And the fact that the volcanic ash drifted so swiftly
🎧 but not that the effects would go on for so long.
🎧 Or that two years after the eruption,
🎧 strange weather events were being reported as far away as North America and North Africa.
🎧 No.
🎧 I found all that hard to believe too.
🎧 It must have been terrible
🎧 and there was nothing anyone could do about it,
🎧 even if they knew the ash cloud was coming in their direction.
🎧 We should run through some of the terrible consequences of the eruption experienced in different countries.
🎧 There's quite a varied range.
🎧 Starting with Iceland, where the impact on farming was devastating.
🎧 One of the most dramatic things there was the effect on livestock as they grazed in the fields.
🎧 They were poisoned because they ate vegetation that had been contaminated with fluorine
🎧 as a result of the volcanic fallout.
🎧 That was horrible.
🎧 In Egypt, the bizarre weather patterns led to a severe drought
🎧 and as a result the Nile didn't flood,
🎧 which meant the crops all failed.
🎧 It's so far from where the eruption happened
🎧 and yet the famine there led to more people dying than any other country.
🎧 It was worse than the plague.
🎧 OK.
🎧 Then in the UK the mortality rate went up a lot, presumably from respiratory illnesses.
🎧 According to one report it was about double the usual number
🎧 and included an unusually high percentage of people under the age of 25.
🎧 I think people will be surprised to hear that the weather in the USA was badly affected too.
🎧 George Washington even makes a note in his diary that they were snowbound until March in Virginia.
🎧 That was before he became president.
🎧 Yes, and there was ice floating down the Mississippi, which was unprecedented.
🎧 Astonishing, really.
🎧 Anyway, what do you think...
🎧 
🎧 Good morning.
🎧 Now, we've been asked to choose an aspect of European clothing or fashion
🎧 and to talk about its development over time.
🎧 I decided to focus on a rather small area of clothing and that's pockets.
🎧 I chose pockets for two reasons, really.
🎧 We all have them - in jeans, jackets, coats, for example -
🎧 and even though we often carry bags or briefcases as well,
🎧 nothing is quite as convenient as being able to pop your phone or credit card into your pocket.
🎧 Yet, I suspect that, other than that, people don't really think about pockets too much
🎧 and they're rather overlooked as a fashion item.
🎧 It's certainly very interesting to go back in time
🎧 and see how pockets developed for men and women.
🎧 In the 18th century,
🎧 fashions were quite different from the way they are now,
🎧 and pockets were too.
🎧 If we think about male fashion first...
🎧 that was the time when suits became popular.
🎧 Trousers were knee-length only and referred to as 'breeches',
🎧 the waistcoats were short and the jackets were long,
🎧 but all three garments were lined with material
🎧 and pockets were sewn into this cloth by whichever tailor the customer used.
🎧 The wearer could then carry small objects such as pencils or coins on their person
🎧 and reach them through a gap in the lining.
🎧 Coat pockets became increasingly decorative on the outside for men who wanted to look stylish,
🎧 but they were often larger but plainer
🎧 if the wearer was someone with a profession who needed to carry medical instruments -
🎧 a doctor or physician, for example.
🎧 The development of women's pockets was a little different.
🎧 For one thing, they weren't nearly as visible or as easy to reach as men's.
🎧 In the 18th and 19th centuries,
🎧 women carried numerous possessions on their person
🎧 and some of these could be worth a lot of money.
🎧 Women were more vulnerable to theft and wealthy women, in particular, worried constantly about pickpockets.
🎧 So, what they did was to have a pair of pockets made that were tied together with string.
🎧 The pockets were made of fabric,
🎧 which might be recycled cloth if the wearer had little money
🎧 or something more expensive, such as linen,
🎧 sometimes featuring very delicate embroidery.
🎧 Women tied the pockets around their waist so that they hung beneath their clothes.
🎧 Remember, skirts were long then
🎧 and there was plenty of room to hide a whole range of small possessions between the layers of petticoats that were commonly worn.
🎧 They would have an opening in the folds of their skirts,
🎧 through which they could reach whatever they needed, like their perfume.
🎧 Working women, of course, also needed to carry around items that they might use for whatever job or trade they were involved in,
🎧 but their pairs of pockets still remained on the inside of their clothing,
🎧 they just got bigger or longer,
🎧 sometimes reaching down to their knees!
🎧 So, the tie on pockets went well into the 19th century
🎧 and only changed when fashion altered towards the end of that period.
🎧 That's when dresses became tighter and less bulky,
🎧 and the pairs of pockets became very noticeable.
🎧 They stood out too much and detracted from the woman's image.
🎧 Women who had been used to carrying around a range of personal possessions - and still wanted to -
🎧 needed somewhere to carry these items about their person.
🎧 That was when small bags, or pouches as they were known, came into fashion
🎧 and, of course, they inevitably led on to the handbag of more modern times,
🎧 particularly when fashion removed pockets altogether.
