🎧 Good morning, ma'am, and welcome to "Australia's Moving Experience"!
🎧 How can I help you?
🎧 Well, I... I hope you can help me. I'm so up in the air right now...
🎧 Just calm down, now.
🎧 Let me guess: you're moving and it has you a little confused.
🎧 That's it exactly.
🎧 You see, I'm relocating to the United States next month
🎧 and I'm having a hard time getting organised.
🎧 Here, fill out your name and address, and let me ask you a few questions.
🎧 Oh, what should I call you?
🎧 My name is Jane, Jane Bond.
🎧 OK, Jane, first of all, what's your work phone number?
🎧 In case I have any questions about things.
🎧 My work phone is 94635550.
🎧 But please try not to call me too often there.
🎧 My boss hates personal calls.
🎧 So does mine, ma'am, so does mine.
🎧 And what address should we ship your things to?
🎧 My new company is letting me stay temporarily
🎧 at 509 Clark House,
🎧 that's C-L-A-R-K,
🎧 1137 University Drive in Seattle.
🎧 Seattle? Beautiful city, I hear.
🎧 Mountains right beside the ocean, almost.
🎧 Cooler than Australia, too.
🎧 OK, and when should we come pack your things?
🎧 Ah... I guess that would be on Monday, March 11th.
🎧 Do you want any help with an after-packing clean-up?
🎧 We do that for a small additional charge.
🎧 Yes, that would be helpful.
🎧 I promised the landlord I'd give her the keys back by 5 pm on Thursday, the 14th.
🎧 Great, we'll just schedule the clean-up for that day.
🎧 That way, the place will smell clean and there'll be no dust.
🎧 Well, you do think of everything!
🎧 Oh, how much is this going to cost?
🎧 Here is a list of our basic prices.
🎧 Oh dear, this seems rather expensive!
🎧 Yes ma'am, but you're paying for the best.
🎧 We're careful and we're fast.
🎧 Like we say, the only thing we break are speed records getting you moved.
🎧 Well... maybe that's so...
🎧 Oh, I nearly forgot to tell you.
🎧 I don't want my furniture shipped with me.
🎧 I won't be looking for an apartment till after I arrive in America.
🎧 Would it be possible to put my furniture in storage here for a month,
🎧 then have it sent along later?
🎧 Of course, we do that all the time.
🎧 A couple of other things.
🎧 Here at "A Moving Experience", we try to pack your things logically.
🎧 We don't just throw stuff in boxes.
🎧 Do you have any special requests?
🎧 You know, things you want packed in some special place,
🎧 so you know where to find them?
🎧 Like what?
🎧 Oh, I don't know... Things like dishes maybe.
🎧 Not to be rude, but you look like a lady who likes to eat.
🎧 Ahhh! Yes, I need my dishes and things where I can find them quickly.
🎧 Great. We'll put those dishes and cutlery in what we call the emergency pack.
🎧 Can you think of anything else?
🎧 Ummm, I do have an antique tea kettle my great-grandmother gave my mother.
🎧 I wouldn't want to lose that.
🎧 So I guess you'd better put that in storage with the furniture.
🎧 Grandma's tea kettle with the furniture, got it!
🎧 Say, how about things like your alarm clock?
🎧 You don't want to miss your plane on the big day, right?
🎧 Well, you certainly think of everything!
🎧 Yes, that's right.
🎧 I'll also need my alarm clock where I can find it.
🎧 Fine, we'll put that in your personal package.
🎧 And of course, we'll give you a list of where we pack everything.
🎧 So, all you'll have to do on Thursday, the 14th, is grab your luggage on your way out the door.
🎧 Um, I couldn't help noticing the new CD player you're carrying.
🎧 Is that a Samsung?
🎧 Why? Yes, it is.
🎧 One of their best.
🎧 Cost me nearly a hundred dollars, it did!
🎧 Do you want to take special care of it?
🎧 I mean it's brand new.
🎧 Take care of it, but nothing special.
🎧 You can just put it in storage with the furniture.
🎧 That looks like everything we need here.
🎧 I guess you're all set.
🎧 That was certainly quick.
🎧 Thank you, young man.
🎧 This has been a most moving experience!
🎧 
🎧 Good morning everyone,
🎧 and welcome to the 2nd Annual Wullaballoo Conference on Mastering Computer Languages.
🎧 I hope you all had a good trip.
🎧 Before we get underway with today's programme,
🎧 let me fill you in as to what's on tap for tomorrow,
🎧 Sunday, February 19th.
🎧 At 9 am right here in the Main Hall,
🎧 we'll be hearing a lecture from Dr John Smith about "Computer as Teacher".
🎧 Professor Smith, from the University of Melbourne,
🎧 is a world-class expert in the field of computer-assisted education,
🎧 and his talk promises to be both stimulating and informative.
🎧 Immediately afterwards, at 10:30,
🎧 there'll be a presentation of papers by various delegates.
🎧 That, however, will take place in the Garden Room on the ground floor.
🎧 If you don't yet know,
🎧 the Garden Room is also called the Ballroom,
🎧 and we'll be gathering at the west end,
🎧 the slightly raised area called Level 2.
🎧 Just look for the crowd.
🎧 If you get lost, there are signs in the foyer.
🎧 After all that thinking, talking, and listening,
🎧 I expect everyone will be a bit weary.
🎧 So at 11:15,
🎧 there will be a break for coffee, cookies, and other light refreshments.
🎧 These will be available at the aptly named Refreshment Stand,
🎧 placed by the door back here in the Main Hall.
🎧 Also, if you choose to skip the formal lunch,
🎧 you can buy a packed lunch at the stand for a reasonable price.
🎧 I strongly urge you, however, to join us at the formal lunch.
🎧 That won't be till one o'clock sharp,
🎧 so you have time to stroll about town a bit.
🎧 We'll be eating at the Sea View Restaurant.
🎧 The restaurant is located right here in the hotel, on the top floor.
🎧 It's a good dozen flights of stairs,
🎧 so I suggest you take the lift on the ground floor, eh?
🎧 If you're not fond of fish,
🎧 there's an all-you-can-eat barbecue available as well.
🎧 They even offer wallaby meat!
🎧 After lunch, we'll troop back downstairs to Level 2 in the Ballroom
🎧 for the presentation of further papers,
🎧 which will begin at 2 pm.
🎧 Please try to be on time.
🎧 I know you'll be a bit tired after lunch,
🎧 but the Ballroom echoes so with people coming in late.
🎧 Thank you in advance.
🎧 Once we've heard the papers,
🎧 we'll break for afternoon tea at 3:10 p.m.
🎧 No need to walk.
🎧 The manager of the refreshment stand has graciously agreed to have tea served in the Ballroom.
🎧 He's even promised us some special scones, baked from a recipe of his dear old Scottish grandmother.
🎧 Then, tea being drunk and scones munched,
🎧 we'll retire here to the Main Hall for some closing remarks and questions.
🎧 So, by 5 o'clock we should have the conference wrapped up.
🎧 But the fun isn't over!
🎧 This is Australia mates!
🎧 We'll be flocking to the hotel's own Palm Lounge on the east side of the foyer for an informal reception.
🎧 You can relax, mingle with the other delegates, and let your hair down a bit.
🎧 This will run from 5:10 to 6:10, though you're free to stay as long as you like.
🎧 The lounge manager has informed me that, for the duration of the actual reception,
🎧 you can have all-you-can-drink beer for $20 with purchase of an advance ticket.
🎧 And, yes, tickets can be purchased from any conference organiser
🎧 or at the front desk anytime between now and the start of the reception.
🎧 I suggest you come by tomorrow evening to pick up the tickets
🎧 since the conference hall only holds 800 people.
🎧 That way, you can also get your journey planned ahead of time
🎧 and be sure not to miss this truly memorable conference.
🎧 If you want cocktails, however, I'm sorry.
🎧 You'll have to pay for those at the regular price.
🎧 Oh my goodness! Speaking of paying,
🎧 I see I forgot to tell you a couple of things.
🎧 The first is about lunch.
🎧 The charge for the lunch will be $15 for all you delegates.
🎧 If you have guests with you,
🎧 the cost is $25 for the general public,
🎧 and $6.50 for children under the age of 10.
🎧 That's $15 each, not total for everyone!
🎧 Another item is about the lunch menu.
🎧 I very much urge you to try the fish.
🎧 I mean, look at the restaurant's name: Sea View.
🎧 As the name suggests, it is a famous seafood restaurant.
🎧 The chef is a Basque from Spain,
🎧 and he really gets quite put out when people ignore his fish specialities for burgers or barbecue.
🎧 If fish isn't your thing though, try the steak,
🎧 he makes an exquisite Filet mignon topped with bleu cheese and mushrooms.
🎧 Finally, if you'd like to buy a ticket,
🎧 you can have both lunch and unlimited beer for $35.
🎧 I should have mentioned that earlier,
🎧 but I am a bit forgetful.
🎧 Maybe I should avoid the beer after the conference, eh?
🎧 Well, I've said my bit. Are there any questions?
🎧 
🎧 Hello... are you Professor Van Diezen?
🎧 Yes, I am. And who might you be?
🎧 Oh! Sorry, my name is Tina. I'm a freshman here.
🎧 They told me I should ask you for advice in choosing courses.
🎧 Well, that's part of what I'm here for.
🎧 Please come in and sit down.
🎧 Now, what are your questions?
🎧 I, I almost don't know!
🎧 Everything is so confusing!
🎧 Like what is a specialised course?
🎧 Oh, easy. A specialised course is one that is compulsory,
🎧 meaning it's a requirement for your major and regular,
🎧 so you can't place out by taking a proficiency exam.
🎧 That sounds pretty strict.
🎧 Then what are all these general courses?
🎧 I seem to have to take so many.
🎧 Nothing to be alarmed over.
🎧 These are courses open to all students and not directly related to your major.
🎧 The university offers these general courses to choose
🎧 so that you can become more well-rounded individuals.
🎧 For example, I see you're a Microbiology major.
🎧 So it might be a good idea to take some literature or history courses
🎧 so that you can know something besides all science.
🎧 You mean these courses are, like, for fun?
🎧 That might be one way to look at it,
🎧 but don't tell the literature professor such a thing.
🎧 Think of a general course as the opposite of a specified course.
🎧 A specified course is one that pertains directly to your major.
🎧 So can I take any Microbiology course I want?
🎧 Let's see.
🎧 Oh, those courses used to be open to Microbiology students only.
🎧 The good thing is, now it's open to students on a flexible schedule,
🎧 so it's not only for full-time students.
🎧 So the answer is yes, if you have the instructor's permission.
🎧 May I ask you why you chose Microbiology?
🎧 Well, I also like plain old Biology, too.
🎧 You know, full sized animals.
🎧 I might even become a veterinarian.
🎧 Could I take some Biology classes?
🎧 Well, they are open to full-time students only,
🎧 which I believe is what you are.
🎧 I don't know how a freshman would get along with Microbiology, though.
🎧 I mean, most of the students presently looking into it are from off-campus.
🎧 Off-campus?
🎧 Yes, you know, people who use it in their work at hospitals, laboratories, even a police detective.
🎧 Why did you choose Microbiology, if I may ask?
🎧 I don't think you've quite answered that.
🎧 Well, eventually I want to be a doctor.
🎧 At least my dad tells me so.
🎧 If I may say so, young lady, you seem a little uncertain.
🎧 Still, I think that might be a good idea for a career.
🎧 Of course, if you're thinking about being either a doctor or a vet,
🎧 you should take some Medical Science classes before you even think of applying to med school.
🎧 Great! What should I take?
🎧 There is one small problem.
🎧 The new Medical Sciences building is under construction,
🎧 so there are no experimental facilities available until next year.
🎧 I'm afraid you'll have to wait.
🎧 But don't forget to take those courses at the first opportunity!
🎧 Oh, bummer.
🎧 Is there any other course you'd recommend for someone like me?
🎧 Well, since you seem to like animals,
🎧 have you ever thought about looking into Environmental Science?
🎧 No, I never really thought about it before.
🎧 Is it worthwhile?
🎧 Quite! In fact, it's the fastest growing subject on this campus.
🎧 I'm sorry, I couldn't help noticing the long list of classes you've written out there.
🎧 May I have a look?
🎧 Oh, sure.
🎧 Medical Science, Statistics, Laboratory Techniques,
🎧 Medicine, Mathematics, Computing.
🎧 My, my, a bit of everything here.
🎧 Is it too much?
🎧 For your first semester, yes.
🎧 What I suggest is starting out by taking the compulsory courses.
🎧 Like we said before, the Medical Science can wait.
🎧 Consider taking that in your sophomore year.
🎧 I think I'd put off Computing, too.
🎧 I recommend to all freshmen that I talk to
🎧 to get the compulsory Mathematics out of the way as early as possible,
🎧 so take that one.
🎧 It'll be one less difficult course you have to focus on when the science lab opens next year,
🎧 and you have to catch up on classes like Laboratory Techniques.
🎧 Your major also requires Statistics so you have to balance two Math classes,
🎧 and no doubt you should take that.
🎧 Otherwise, get your required Medicine course out of the way by taking something theory-based.
🎧 Oh, of course and your Environmental Science class if you're interested.
🎧 The others can wait, though I think Computing is definitely a good idea,
🎧 even though it's not required.
🎧 I see too, on your paper there, you seem to have had high marks on the entrance exam.
🎧 Uhhh, yeah. I guess so.
🎧 Don't be shy! Have you thought about applying for a scholarship?
🎧 Do they have any?
🎧 I mean, my dad is always complaining about how much money it costs him.
🎧 In your department, there are actually three full scholarships available.
🎧 They cover tuition and provide $1,500 cash.
🎧 $1,500 cash?! Party!
🎧 Please, Miss. The money is intended more as a textbook allowance, not party money.
🎧 If you promise to behave, I'll show you how to apply.
🎧 Great, and thanks!
🎧 
🎧 We've been talking about choosing building materials in the last week.
🎧 Now, a great many factors influence the choice of building materials.
🎧 You can't make a house of cards, right?
🎧 And "people who live in glass houses..." and all that...
🎧 Anyhow, today I'd like to say a few words about flooring.
🎧 Some artificial materials can be used, like plastic for instance,
🎧 which offer mixed blessings when used as a flooring surface.
🎧 On the one hand, plastic is cheaper than nearly any other alternative, short of bare ground.
🎧 Plastic also does not warp like wood.
🎧 On the other hand, the best that can be said about plastic is that it "looks like" wood or stone.
🎧 However, it cannot replace the real materials.
🎧 As I have mentioned, I'm fixing up a new house.
🎧 The decorator my wife hired told me,
🎧 "Plastic does a great job of looking exactly like plastic".
🎧 Besides, it scratches easily, fades or discolours,
🎧 and starts cracking within a year or two.
🎧 So, if you're fitting out a sleazy hotel or plan to live in a trailer park,
🎧 go with the plastic.
🎧 Really, though, for all intents and purposes,
🎧 this leaves us with wood or stone as choices for flooring.
🎧 Stone and wood are alike in at least one respect:
🎧 both go through processing before they can be put to use.
🎧 Since few of us cut our own lumber or quarry our own stone,
🎧 this is not perhaps a pressing concern.
🎧 Still, do-it-yourselfers would do well to remember to buy only properly seasoned wood.
🎧 Unseasoned wood warps and a warped floor quickly becomes firewood
🎧 (and its owner quickly becomes poorer).
🎧 Likewise, except for dull-hued materials like slate or sandstone,
🎧 most stone floors are polished before installation.
🎧 The choice goes well beyond just wood or stone -
🎧 each type requires many further considerations.
🎧 A few special remarks are called for when considering wood, for example.
🎧 As always, aesthetics, personal taste,
🎧 and layout all play roles as well as the type of house or room.
🎧 Oh, and certainly don't forget the cost.
🎧 When it comes to cost, a rule of thumb is that the softer and less exotic the wood,
🎧 the lower the cost.
🎧 In the US, for instance, pine is both ubiquitous and cheap.
🎧 Mahogany is imported and exorbitantly expensive.
🎧 If you're on any kind of budget when remodeling,
🎧 it's really helpful to remember to go for the softer woods.
🎧 Aside from cost, there are still lots of different factors that are important in choosing the best flooring for the job.
🎧 Continuing with the example of wood,
🎧 one must consider the effects of each type of wood on the mood of the room.
🎧 When selecting the best wood to use,
🎧 particular attention needs to be paid to its grain patterns, texture, and colour.
🎧 In rooms where relaxation or deep thought is the aim,
🎧 (say bedrooms or the study) dark, strong grained woods are the rule.
🎧 Here the grain ought to match the furniture for a feeling of homogeneity.
🎧 In rooms where activity and motion are typical,
🎧 (dining room or living room)
🎧 lighter, finer-grained lumber is more suitable.
🎧 In such a setting, the wood grain might be useful in offering a contrast to the furniture.
🎧 This leads to a feel of subconscious excitement, in keeping with the room's function.
🎧 In either case, though, consult a decorator.
🎧 It is a decorator's job to know what materials to use to fit the function of the room.
🎧 Though some things about putting together a room are subjective and based on one's individual taste,
🎧 materials appropriate to a room's function are much more straightforward.
🎧 A decorator takes the needs of the customer and uses a mathematical formula, rather than subjective words.
🎧 Since feelings vary from person to person,
🎧 verbal descriptions of wood types tend to be ambiguous.
🎧 You want the wood you select, not something approximate!
🎧 And if you do decide to do it yourself,
🎧 remember that all wood must be treated with preservatives to enhance its appearance
🎧 and preserve its natural beauty.
🎧 In the case of stone, or "quarry tile" as flat-cut flooring stone is properly called,
🎧 a new set of considerations must be weighed up.
🎧 Simple colour aside, the degree of reflection must be kept in mind.
🎧 This is called the "reflectance rate",
🎧 which is expressed in a number between 0.0 and 1.0,
🎧 depending on the amount of light it reflects.
🎧 At one end of the scale is polished silver.
🎧 At a rating of 1.0, this shiny surface reflects nearly all of the light directed at it.
🎧 Numbers closer to zero describe materials that absorb more light.
🎧 Moving down the scale a bit,
🎧 we see the plastic that has been painted white has a rate of 0.8, which makes sense.
🎧 We know that the colour white reflects all other colours while black absorbs all colours,
🎧 and plastic itself is a relatively reflective material.
🎧 Materials that are denser and darker have reflectance rates much closer to zero.
🎧 The quarry tile I mentioned a while ago has a rate of 0.1.
🎧 As you may know,
🎧 quarry tile is generally dark brown and made from clay so it is quite dense.
🎧 Of course, there is considerable variation among types of quarry tile
🎧 because of the hue or treatment of the clay during its creation.
🎧 Does anyone have any guesses as to what material may have a rate of almost 0.0?
🎧 We can guess most of these materials are black in colour,
🎧 but plastic, wood, and even stone reflect some light.
🎧 One material with a rate of almost 0.0 is black velvet.
🎧 The texture produces almost no shine at all.
🎧 Carrara marble, despite its white hue,
🎧 is actually lower in reflectivity than black onyx!
🎧 In any case, the fact that tiles vary somewhat should not be forgotten.
🎧 A highly reflective floor would not be suitable in a library;
🎧 it would be indispensable in a ballroom (should your home be large enough to feature one).
🎧 Again, a rule of thumb is that "light means lively".
🎧 Since form and material follow function,
🎧 one should only use the more reflective materials in rooms
🎧 where the cultivation and expression of energy is important.
🎧 Bear in mind too that most types of stone cost more than all but the rarest of wood.
🎧 Of course, there is no reason why some rooms of a house should not feature wood floors or other stone tiles.
🎧 You can even mix the two.
🎧 A room with wood panels on the walls can have a beautiful stone floor.
🎧 My bedroom has white birch walls and a light blue slate floor.
🎧 The place looks like a Russian hunting lodge.
🎧 Remember, though, go with what feels right for you.
🎧 Good taste and the "laws" of interior design are the homeowner's servants, not his master.
🎧 It's only beautiful when you decide it is.
🎧 I mean, you're the one who lives there, not the decorator, right?
🎧 OK, are there any questions?
