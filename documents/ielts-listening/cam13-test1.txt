🎧 Hello, Tourist Information Centre, Mike speaking, how can I help you?
🎧 Oh, hi.
🎧 I wanted to find out about cookery classes.
🎧 I believe there are some one-day classes for tourists?
🎧 Well, they're open to everyone, but tourists are always welcome.
🎧 OK, let me give you some details of what's available.
🎧 There are several classes.
🎧 One very popular one is at the Food Studio.
🎧 OK
🎧 They focus on seasonal products,
🎧 and as well as teaching you how to cook them, they also show you how to choose them.
🎧 Right, that sounds good.
🎧 How big are the classes?
🎧 I'm not sure exactly, but they'll be quite small.
🎧 And could I get a private lesson there?
🎧 I think so… let me check,
🎧 yes, they do offer those.
🎧 Though in fact most of the people who attend the classes find it's a nice way of getting to know one another.
🎧 I suppose it must be, yes.
🎧 And this company has a special deal for clients
🎧 where they offer a discount of 20% if you return for a further class.
🎧 OK.
🎧 But you said there were several classes?
🎧 That's right.
🎧 Another one you might be interested in is Bond's Cookery School.
🎧 They're quite new,
🎧 they just opened six months ago, but I've heard good things about them.
🎧 They concentrate on teaching you to prepare healthy food,
🎧 and they have quite a lot of specialist staff.
🎧 So is that food for people on a diet and things like that?
🎧 I don't know if I'd be interested in that.
🎧 Well, I don't think they particularly focus on low calorie diets or weight loss.
🎧 It's more to do with recipes that look at specific needs,
🎧 like including ingredients that will help build up your bones and make them stronger, that sort of thing.
🎧 I see.
🎧 Well, I might be interested, I'm not sure.
🎧 Do they have a website I could check?
🎧 Yes, just key in the name of the school - it'll come up.
🎧 And if you want to know more about them, every Thursday evening they have a lecture at the school.
🎧 It's free and you don't need to book or anything, just turn up at 7.30.
🎧 And that might give you an idea of whether you want to go to an actual class.
🎧 OK, there's one more place you might be interested in.
🎧 That's got a rather strange name, it's called The Arretsa Centre -
🎧 that's spelled ARRETSA.
🎧 OK.
🎧 They've got a very good reputation.
🎧 They do a bit of meat and fish cookery but they mostly specialise in vegetarian dishes.
🎧 Right.
🎧 That's certainly an area I'd like to learn more about.
🎧 I've got lots of friends who don't eat meat.
🎧 In fact, I think I might have seen that school today.
🎧 Is it just by the market?
🎧 That's right.
🎧 So they don't have any problem getting their ingredients.
🎧 They're right next door.
🎧 And they also offer a special two-hour course in how to use a knife.
🎧 They cover all the different skills - buying them, sharpening, chopping techniques.
🎧 It gets booked up quickly though so you'd need to check it was available.
🎧 Right, well thank you very much.
🎧 I'll go and…
🎧 
🎧 Good evening everyone.
🎧 My name's Phil Sutton, and I'm chairman of the Highways Committee.
🎧 We've called this meeting to inform members of the public
🎧 about the new regulations for traffic and parking we're proposing for Granford.
🎧 I'll start by summarising these changes before we open the meeting to questions.
🎧 So, why do we need to make these changes to traffic systems in Granford?
🎧 Well, we're very aware that traffic is becoming an increasing problem.
🎧 It's been especially noticeable with the increase in heavy traffic while they've been building the new hospital.
🎧 But it's the overall rise in the volume of traffic of all kinds that's concerning us.
🎧 To date there's not been any increase in traffic accidents,
🎧 but that's not something we want to see happen, obviously.
🎧 We recently carried out a survey of local residents,
🎧 and their responses were interesting.
🎧 People were very concerned about the lack of visibility on some roads
🎧 due to cars parked along the sides of the roads.
🎧 We'd expected complaints about the congestion near the school
🎧 when parents are dropping off their children or picking them up,
🎧 but this wasn't top of the list,
🎧 and nor were noise and fumes from trucks and lorries,
🎧 though they were mentioned by some people.
🎧 We think these new traffic regulations would make a lot of difference.
🎧 But we still have a long way to go.
🎧 We've managed to keep our proposals within budget, just, so they can be covered by the Council.
🎧 But, of course, it's no good introducing new regulations
🎧 if we don't have a way of making sure that everyone obeys them,
🎧 and that's an area we're still working on with the help of representatives from the police force.
🎧 OK, so this slide shows a map of the central area of Granford,
🎧 with the High Street in the middle and School Road on the right.
🎧 Now, we already have a set of traffic lights in the High Street at the junction with Station Road,
🎧 but we're planning to have another set at the other end, at the School Road junction,
🎧 to regulate the flow of traffic along the High Street.
🎧 We've decided we definitely need a pedestrian crossing.
🎧 We considered putting this on School Road, just outside the school,
🎧 but in the end we decided that could lead to a lot of traffic congestion
🎧 so we decided to locate it on the High Street, crossing the road in front of the supermarket.
🎧 That's a very busy area, so it should help things there.
🎧 We're proposing some changes to parking.
🎧 At present, parking isn't allowed on the High Street outside the library,
🎧 but we're going to change that, and allow parking there,
🎧 but not at the other end of the High Street near School Road.
🎧 There'll be a new 'No Parking' sign on School Road,
🎧 just by the entrance to the school, forbidding parking for 25 metres.
🎧 This should improve visibility for drivers and pedestrians,
🎧 especially on the bend just to the north of the school.
🎧 As far as disabled drivers are concerned,
🎧 at present they have parking outside the supermarket,
🎧 but lorries also use those spaces,
🎧 so we've got two new disabled parking spaces on the side road up towards the bank.
🎧 It's not ideal, but probably better than the present arrangement.
🎧 We also plan to widen the pavement on School Road.
🎧 We think we can manage to get an extra half-metre on the bend just before you get to the school,
🎧 on the same side of the road.
🎧 Finally, we've introduced new restrictions on loading and unloading for the supermarket,
🎧 so lorries will only be allowed to stop there before 8 am.
🎧 That's the supermarket on School Road -
🎧 we kept to the existing arrangements with the High Street supermarket.
🎧 OK. So that's about it...
🎧 
🎧 We've got to choose a topic for our experiment, haven't we, Jack?
🎧 Were you thinking of something to do with seeds?
🎧 That's right.
🎧 I thought we could look at seed germination - how a seed begins to grow.
🎧 OK.
🎧 Any particular reason?
🎧 I know you're hoping to work in plant science eventually…
🎧 Yeah, but practically everything we do is going to feed into that.
🎧 No, there's an optional module on seed structure and function in the third year that I might do,
🎧 so I thought it might be useful for that.
🎧 If I choose that option, I don't have to do a dissertation module.
🎧 Good idea.
🎧 Well, I thought for this experiment we could look at the relationship between seed size and the way the seeds are planted.
🎧 So, we could plant different sized seeds in different ways, and see which grow best.
🎧 OK.
🎧 We'd need to allow time for the seeds to come up.
🎧 That should be fine if we start now.
🎧 A lot of the other possible experiments need quite a bit longer.
🎧 So that'd make it a good one to choose.
🎧 And I don't suppose it'd need much equipment;
🎧 we're not doing chemical analysis or anything.
🎧 Though that's not really an issue,
🎧 we've got plenty of equipment in the laboratory.
🎧 Yeah. We need to have a word with the tutor if we're going to go ahead with it though.
🎧 I'm sure our aim's OK.
🎧 It's not very ambitious but the assignment's only ten percent of our final mark, isn't it?
🎧 But we need to be sure we're the only ones doing it.
🎧 Yeah, it's only five percent actually,
🎧 but it'd be a bit boring if everyone was doing it.
🎧 Did you read that book on seed germination on our reading list?
🎧 The one by Graves?
🎧 I looked through it for my last experiment,
🎧 though it wasn't all that relevant there.
🎧 It would be for this experiment, though.
🎧 I found it quite hard to follow -
🎧 lots about the theory, which I hadn't expected
🎧 Yes, I'd been hoping for something more practical.
🎧 It does include references to the recent findings on genetically-modified seeds, though.
🎧 Yes, that was interesting.
🎧 I read an article about seed germination by Lee Hall.
🎧 About seeds that lie in the ground for ages and only germinate after a fire?
🎧 That's the one.
🎧 I knew a bit about it already, but not about this research.
🎧 His analysis of figures comparing the times of the fires and the proportion of seeds that germinated
🎧 was done in a lot of detail - very impressive.
🎧 Was that the article with the illustrations of early stages of plant development?
🎧 They were very clear.
🎧 I think those diagrams were in another article.
🎧 Anyway, shall we have a look at the procedure for our experiment?
🎧 We'll need to get going with it quite soon.
🎧 Right.
🎧 So the first thing we have to do is find our seeds.
🎧 I think vegetable seeds would be best.
🎧 And obviously they mustn't all be the same size.
🎧 So, how many sorts do we need?
🎧 About four different ones?
🎧 I think that would be enough.
🎧 There'll be quite a large number of seeds for each one.
🎧 Then, for each seed we need to find out how much it weighs,
🎧 and also measure its dimensions,
🎧 and we need to keep a careful record of all that.
🎧 That'll be quite time-consuming.
🎧 And we also need to decide how deep we're going to plant the seeds -
🎧 right on the surface, a few millimetres down, or several centimetres.
🎧 OK.
🎧 So then we get planting.
🎧 Do you think we can plant several seeds together in the same plant pot?
🎧 No, I think we need a different one for each seed.
🎧 Right. And we'll need to label them.
🎧 We can use different coloured labels.
🎧 Then we wait for the seeds to germinate.
🎧 I reckon that'll be about three weeks, depending on what the weather's like.
🎧 Then we see if our plants have come up, and write down how tall they've grown.
🎧 Then all we have to do is look at our numbers, and see if there's any relation between them.
🎧 That's right. So …
🎧 
🎧 Hi.
🎧 Today we're going to be looking at animals in urban environments
🎧 and I'm going to be telling you about some research on how they're affected by these environments.
🎧 Now, in evolutionary terms,
🎧 urban environments represent huge upheavals,
🎧 the sorts of massive changes that usually happen over millions of years.
🎧 And we used to think that only a few species could adapt to this new environment.
🎧 One species which is well known as being highly adaptable is the crow,
🎧 and there've been various studies about how they manage to learn new skills.
🎧 Another successful species is the pigeon,
🎧 because they're able to perch on ledges on the walls of city buildings,
🎧 just like they once perched on cliffs by the sea.
🎧 But in fact,
🎧 we're now finding that these early immigrants were just the start of a more general movement of animals into cities,
🎧 and of adaptation by these animals to city life.
🎧 And one thing that researchers are finding especially interesting
🎧 is the speed with which they're doing this -
🎧 we're not talking about gradual evolution here -
🎧 these animals are changing fast.
🎧 Let me tell you about some of the studies that have been carried out in this area.
🎧 So, in the University of Minnesota,
🎧 a biologist called Emilie Snell-Rood and her colleagues
🎧 looked at specimens of urbanised small mammals such as mice and gophers
🎧 that had been collected in Minnesota, and that are now kept in museums there.
🎧 And she looked at specimens that had been collected over the last hundred years,
🎧 which is a very short time in evolutionary terms.
🎧 And she found that during that time,
🎧 these small mammals had experienced a jump in brain size when compared to rural mammals.
🎧 Now, we can't be sure this means they're more intelligent,
🎧 but since the sizes of other parts of the body didn't change,
🎧 it does suggest that something cognitive was going on.
🎧 And Snell-Rood thinks that this change might reflect the cognitive demands of adjusting to city life -
🎧 having to look in different places to find food, for example,
🎧 and coping with a whole new set of dangers.
🎧 Then over in Germany at the Max Planck Institute,
🎧 there's another biologist called Catarina Miranda
🎧 who's done some experiments with blackbirds living in urban and rural areas.
🎧 And she's been looking not at their anatomy but at their behaviour.
🎧 So as you might expect, she's found that the urban blackbirds tend to be quite bold -
🎧 they're prepared to face up to a lot of threats that would frighten away their country counterparts.
🎧 But there's one type of situation that does seem to frighten the urban blackbirds,
🎧 and that's anything new - anything they haven't experienced before.
🎧 And if you think about it, that's quite sensible for a bird living in the city.
🎧 Jonathan Atwell, in Indiana University,
🎧 is looking at how a range of animals respond to urban environments.
🎧 He's found that when they're under stress,
🎧 their endocrine systems react by reducing the amount of hormones such as corticosterone into their blood.
🎧 It's a sensible-seeming adaptation.
🎧 A rat that gets scared every time a subway train rolls past won't be very successful.
🎧 There's just one more study I'd like to mention which is by Sarah Partan and her team,
🎧 and they've been looking at how squirrels communicate in an urban environment,
🎧 and they've found that a routine part of their communication is carried out by waving their tails.
🎧 You do also see this in the country, but it's much more prevalent in cities,
🎧 possibly because it's effective in a noisy environment.
🎧 So what are the long-term implications of this?
🎧 One possibility is that we may see completely new species developing in cities.
🎧 But on the other hand, it's possible that not all of these adaptations will be permanent.
🎧 Once the animal's got accustomed to its new environment,
🎧 it may no longer need the features it's developed.
🎧 So, now we've had a look…
