🎧 Hello?
🎧 Oh hello.
🎧 I was hoping to speak to Jack Fitzgerald about renting a cottage.
🎧 I'm his wife, Shirley, and we own the cottages together,
🎧 so I'm sure I can help you.
🎧 Great.
🎧 My name's Tom.
🎧 Some friends of ours rented Granary Cottage from you last year,
🎧 and they thought it was great.
🎧 So my wife and I are hoping to come in May for a week.
🎧 What date did you have in mind?
🎧 The week beginning the 14th, if possible.
🎧 I'll just check...
🎧 I'm sorry, Tom, it's already booked that week.
🎧 It's free the week beginning the 28th, though, for seven nights.
🎧 In fact, that's the only time you could have it in May.
🎧 Well, we could manage that, I think.
🎧 We'd just need to change a couple of things.
🎧 How much would it cost?
🎧 That's the beginning of high season,
🎧 so it'd be £550 for the week.
🎧 That's a bit more than we wanted to pay, I'm afraid.
🎧 We've budgeted up to £500 for accommodation.
🎧 Well, we've just finished converting another building into a cottage,
🎧 which we're calling Chervil Cottage.
🎧 Sorry? What was that again?
🎧 Chervil.
🎧 C H E R V for Victor I L.
🎧 Oh, that's a herb, isn't it?
🎧 That's right.
🎧 It grows fairly wild around here.
🎧 You could have that for the week you want for £480.
🎧 OK.
🎧 So could you tell me something about it, please?
🎧 Of course.
🎧 The building was built as a garage.
🎧 It's a little smaller than Granary Cottage.
🎧 So that must sleep two people, as well?
🎧 That's right.
🎧 There's a double bedroom.
🎧 Does it have a garden?
🎧 Yes, you get to it from the living room through French doors,
🎧 and we provide two deckchairs.
🎧 We hope to build a patio in the near future,
🎧 but I wouldn't like to guarantee it'll be finished by May.
🎧 OK.
🎧 The front door opens onto the old farmyard,
🎧 and parking isn't a problem -
🎧 there's plenty of room at the front for that.
🎧 There are some trees and potted plants there.
🎧 What about facilities in the cottage?
🎧 It has standard things like a cooker and fridge, I presume.
🎧 In the kitchen area there's a fridge-freezer
🎧 and we've just put in an electric cooker.
🎧 Is there a washing machine?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 There's also a TV in the living room, which plays DVDs too.
🎧 The bathroom is too small for a bath,
🎧 so there's a shower instead.
🎧 I think a lot of people prefer that nowadays, anyway.
🎧 It's more environmentally friendly, isn't it?
🎧 Unless you spend half the day in it!
🎧 Exactly.
🎧 What about heating?
🎧 It sometimes gets quite cool at that time of year.
🎧 There's central heating, and if you want to light a fire, there's a stove.
🎧 We can provide all the wood you need for it.
🎧 It smells so much nicer than coal,
🎧 and it makes the room very cosy -
🎧 we've got one in our own house.
🎧 That sounds very pleasant.
🎧 Perhaps we should come in the winter, to make the most of it!
🎧 Yes, we find we don't want to go out when we've got the fire burning.
🎧 There are some attractive views from the cottage, which I haven't mentioned.
🎧 There's a famous stone bridge -
🎧 it's one of the oldest in the region,
🎧 and you can see it from the living room.
🎧 It isn't far away.
🎧 The bedroom window looks in the opposite direction,
🎧 and has a lovely view of the hills and the monument at the top.
🎧 Well, that all sounds perfect.
🎧 I'd like to book it, please.
🎧 Would you want a deposit?
🎧 Yes, we ask for 30% to secure your booking,
🎧 so that'll be... £144.
🎧 And when would you like the rest of the money?
🎧 You're coming in May, so the last day of March, please.
🎧 Fine.
🎧 Excellent.
🎧 Could I just take your details...
🎧 
🎧 Right. Next on the agenda we have traffic and highways.
🎧 Councillor Thornton.
🎧 Thank you.
🎧 Well, we now have the results of the survey carried out last month
🎧 about traffic and road transport in the town.
🎧 People were generally satisfied with the state of the roads.
🎧 There were one or two complaints about potholes which will be addressed,
🎧 but a significant number of people complained about the increasing number of heavy vehicles
🎧 using our local roads to avoid traffic elsewhere.
🎧 We'd expected more complaints by commuters
🎧 about the reduction in the train service,
🎧 but it doesn't seem to have affected people too much.
🎧 The cycle path that runs alongside the river
🎧 is very well used by both cyclists and pedestrians
🎧 since the surface was improved last year,
🎧 but overtaking can be a problem
🎧 so we're going to add a bit on the side to make it wider.
🎧 At some stage, we'd like to extend the path so that it goes all the way through the town,
🎧 but that won't be happening in the immediate future.
🎧 The plans to have a pedestrian crossing next to the Post Office
🎧 have unfortunately had to be put on hold for the time being.
🎧 We'd budgeted for this to be done this financial year,
🎧 but then there were rumours that the Post Office was going to move,
🎧 which would have meant there wasn't really a need for a crossing.
🎧 Now they've confirmed that they're staying where they are,
🎧 but the Highways Department have told us that it would be dangerous to have a pedestrian crossing
🎧 where we'd originally planned it as there's a bend in the road there.
🎧 So that'll need some more thought.
🎧 On Station Road near the station and level crossing,
🎧 drivers can face quite long waits if the level crossing's closed,
🎧 and we've now got signs up requesting them not to leave their engines running at that time.
🎧 This means pedestrians waiting on the pavement to cross the railway line
🎧 don't have to breathe in car fumes.
🎧 We've had some problems with cyclists leaving their bikes chained to the railings outside the ticket office,
🎧 but the station has agreed to provide bike racks there.
🎧 So next on the agenda is 'Proposals for improvements to the recreation ground'.
🎧 Councillor Thornton again.
🎧 Well, since we managed to extend the recreation ground,
🎧 we've spent some time talking to local people
🎧 about how it could be made a more attractive and useful space.
🎧 If you have a look at the map up on the screen,
🎧 you can see the river up in the north,
🎧 and the Community Hall near the entrance from the road.
🎧 At present, cars can park between the Community Hall and that line of trees to the east,
🎧 but this is quite dangerous for pedestrians
🎧 so we're suggesting a new car park on the opposite side of the Community Hall,
🎧 right next to it.
🎧 We also have a new location for the cricket pitch.
🎧 As we've now purchased additional space to the east of the recreation ground,
🎧 beyond the trees,
🎧 we plan to move it away from its current location,
🎧 which is rather near the road, into this new area beyond the line of trees.
🎧 This means there's less danger of stray balls hitting cars or pedestrians.
🎧 We've got plans for a children's playground
🎧 which will be accessible by a footpath from the Community Hall
🎧 and will be alongside the river.
🎧 We'd originally thought of having it close to the road,
🎧 but we think this will be a more attractive location.
🎧 The skateboard ramp is very popular with both younger and older children -
🎧 we had considered moving this up towards the river,
🎧 but in the end we decided to have it in the southeast corner near the road.
🎧 The pavilion is very well used at present by both football players and cricketers.
🎧 It will stay where it is now -
🎧 to the left of the line of trees and near to the river -
🎧 handy for both the football and cricket pitches.
🎧 And finally, we'll be getting a new notice board for local information,
🎧 and that will be directly on people's right
🎧 as they go from the road into the recreation ground.
🎧 
🎧 Now that we've done all the research into bike-sharing schemes in cities around the world,
🎧 we need to think about how we're going to organise our report.
🎧 Right.
🎧 I think we should start by talking about the benefits.
🎧 I mean it's great that so many cities have introduced these schemes
🎧 where anyone can pick up a bike from dozens of different locations
🎧 and hire it for a few hours.
🎧 It makes riding a bike very convenient for people.
🎧 Yes, but the costs can add up
🎧 and that puts people on low incomes off in some places.
🎧 I suppose so,
🎧 but if it means more people in general are cycling rather than driving,
🎧 then because they're increasing the amount of physical activity they do,
🎧 it's good for their health
🎧 OK.
🎧 But isn't that of less importance?
🎧 I mean, doesn't the impact of reduced emissions on air pollution
🎧 have a more significant effect on people's health?
🎧 Certainly, in some cities bike-sharing has made a big contribution to that.
🎧 And also helped to cut the number of cars on the road significantly.
🎧 Which is the main point.
🎧 Exactly.
🎧 But I'd say it's had less of an impact on noise pollution
🎧 because there are still loads of buses and lorries around.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Shall we quickly discuss the recommendations we're going to make?
🎧 In order to ensure bike-sharing schemes are successful?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 OK.
🎧 Well, while I think it's nice to have really state-of-the-art bikes with things like GPS,
🎧 I wouldn't say they're absolutely necessary.
🎧 But some technical things are really important -
🎧 like a fully functional app -
🎧 so people can make payments and book bikes easily.
🎧 Places which haven't invested in that have really struggled.
🎧 Good point...
🎧 Some people say there shouldn't be competing companies offering separate bike-sharing schemes,
🎧 but in some really big cities, competition's beneficial
🎧 and anyway one company might not be able to manage the whole thing.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Deciding how much to invest is a big question.
🎧 Cities which have opened loads of new bike lanes
🎧 at the same time as introducing bike-sharing schemes have generally been more successful -
🎧 but there are examples of successful schemes where this hasn't happened...
🎧 What does matter though - is having a big publicity campaign.
🎧 Definitely.
🎧 If people don't know how to use the scheme or don't understand its benefits,
🎧 they won't use it.
🎧 People need a lot of persuasion to stop using their cars.
🎧 Shall we look at some examples now?
🎧 And say what we think is good or bad about them.
🎧 I suppose we should start with Amsterdam
🎧 as this was one of the first cities to have a bike-sharing scheme.
🎧 Yes.
🎧 There was already a strong culture of cycling here.
🎧 In a way it's strange that there was such a demand for bike-sharing
🎧 because you'd have thought most people would have used their own bikes.
🎧 And yet it's one of the best-used schemes...
🎧 Dublin's an interesting example of a success story.
🎧 It must be because the public transport system's quite limited.
🎧 Not really -
🎧 there's no underground, but there are trams and a good bus network.
🎧 I'd say price has a lot to do with it.
🎧 It's one of the cheapest schemes in Europe to join.
🎧 But the buses are really slow -
🎧 anyway the weather certainly can't be a factor!
🎧 No - definitely not.
🎧 The London scheme's been quite successful
🎧 Yes - it's been a really good thing for the city.
🎧 The bikes are popular and the whole system is well maintained
🎧 but it isn't expanding quickly enough.
🎧 Basically, not enough's been spent on increasing the number of cycle lanes.
🎧 Hopefully that'll change.
🎧 Yes.
🎧 Now what about outside Europe?
🎧 Well bike-sharing schemes have taken off in places like Buenos Aires.
🎧 They built a huge network of cycle lanes to support the introduction of the scheme there, didn't they?
🎧 It attracted huge numbers of cyclists where previously there were hardly any.
🎧 An example of good planning.
🎧 Absolutely.
🎧 New York is a good example of how not to introduce a scheme.
🎧 When they launched it,
🎧 it was more than ten times the price of most other schemes.
🎧 More than it costs to take a taxi, crazy.
🎧 I think the organisers lacked vision and ambition there.
🎧 I think so too.
🎧 Sydney would be a good example to use.
🎧 I would have expected it to have grown pretty quickly here.
🎧 Yes.
🎧 I can't quite work out why it hasn't been an instant success like some of the others.
🎧 It's a shame really.
🎧 I know.
🎧 OK so now we've thought about...
🎧 
🎧 One of the most famous cases of extinction is that of a bird known as the dodo.
🎧 In fact there's even a saying in English, 'as dead as the dodo',
🎧 used to refer to something which no longer exists.
🎧 But for many centuries the dodo was alive and well,
🎧 although it could only be found in one place,
🎧 the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean.
🎧 It was a very large bird, about one metre tall,
🎧 and over the centuries it had lost the ability to fly,
🎧 but it survived happily under the trees that covered the island.
🎧 Then in the year 1507,
🎧 the first Portuguese ships stopped at the island.
🎧 The sailors were carrying spices back to Europe,
🎧 and found the island a convenient stopping place
🎧 where they could stock up with food and water for the rest of the voyage,
🎧 but they didn't settle on Mauritius.
🎧 However, in 1638
🎧 the Dutch arrived and set up a colony there.
🎧 These first human inhabitants of the island
🎧 found the dodo birds a convenient source of meat,
🎧 although not everyone liked the taste.
🎧 It's hard to get an accurate description of what the dodo actually looked like.
🎧 We do have some written records from sailors,
🎧 and a few pictures,
🎧 but we don't know how reliable these are.
🎧 The best-known picture is a Dutch painting,
🎧 in which the bird appears to be extremely fat,
🎧 but this may not be accurate -
🎧 an Indian painting done at the same time shows a much thinner bird.
🎧 Although attempts were made to preserve the bodies of some of the birds,
🎧 no complete specimen survives.
🎧 In the early 17th century
🎧 four dried parts of a bird were known to exist -
🎧 of these, three have disappeared,
🎧 so only one example of soft tissue from the dodo survives,
🎧 a dodo head.
🎧 Bones have also been found,
🎧 but there's only one complete skeleton in existence.
🎧 This single dodo skeleton has recently been the subject of scientific research
🎧 which suggests that many of the earlier beliefs about dodos
🎧 may have been incorrect.
🎧 For example,
🎧 early accounts of the birds mention how slow and clumsy it was,
🎧 but scientists now believe
🎧 the bird's strong knee joints would have made it capable of movement which was not slow,
🎧 but actually quite fast.
🎧 In fact, one 17th century sailor wrote that he found the birds hard to catch.
🎧 It's true that the dodo's small wings wouldn't have allowed it to leave the ground,
🎧 but the scientists suggest that these were probably employed for balance
🎧 while going over uneven ground.
🎧 Another group of scientists carried out analysis of the dodo's skull.
🎧 They found that the reports of the lack of intelligence of the dodo
🎧 were not borne out by their research,
🎧 which suggested the bird's brain was not small,
🎧 but average in size.
🎧 In fact, in relation to its body size,
🎧 it was similar to that of the pigeon,
🎧 which is known to be a highly intelligent bird.
🎧 The researchers also found that the structure of the bird's skull
🎧 suggested that one sense which was particularly well-developed was that of smell.
🎧 So the dodo may also have been particularly good at locating ripe fruit
🎧 and other food in the island's thick vegetation.
🎧 So it looks as if the dodo was better able to survive and defend itself than was originally believed.
🎧 Yet less than 200 years after Europeans first arrived on the island,
🎧 they had become extinct.
🎧 So what was the reason for this?
🎧 For a long time, it was believed that the dodos were hunted to extinction,
🎧 but scientists now believe the situation was more complicated than this.
🎧 Another factor may have been the new species brought to the island by the sailors.
🎧 These included dogs, which would have been a threat to the dodos,
🎧 and also monkeys,
🎧 which ate the fruit that was the main part of the dodos' diet.
🎧 These were brought to the island deliberately,
🎧 but the ships also brought another type of creature - rats,
🎧 which came to land from the ships and rapidly overran the island.
🎧 These upset the ecology of the island,
🎧 not just the dodos but other species too.
🎧 However,
🎧 they were a particular danger to the dodos
🎧 because they consumed their eggs,
🎧 and since each dodo only laid one at a time,
🎧 this probably had a devastating effect on populations.
🎧 However,
🎧 we now think that probably the main cause of the birds' extinction
🎧 was not the introduction of non-native species,
🎧 but the introduction of agriculture.
🎧 This meant that the forest that had once covered all the island,
🎧 and that had provided a perfect home for the dodo,
🎧 was cut down so that crops such as sugar could be grown.
🎧 So although the dodo had survived for thousands of years,
🎧 suddenly it was gone.
