🎧 Good morning, Clare House Hotel.
🎧 Andrew speaking.
🎧 I'm the Events Manager.
🎧 Good morning, Andrew.
🎧 My name's Samantha.
🎧 I'm arranging a party for my parents' fiftieth wedding anniversary,
🎧 and I'm ringing to ask about hiring a room some time next September.
🎧 Also my parents and several of the guests will need accommodation.
🎧 OK, I'm sure we can help you with that.
🎧 Will you be having a sit-down meal or a buffet?
🎧 Probably a sit-down.
🎧 And do you know how many people there'll be?
🎧 Around eighty, I think.
🎧 Well we have two rooms that can hold that number.
🎧 One is the Adelphi Room.
🎧 That can seat 85, or hold over a hundred if people are standing for a buffet.
🎧 Right.
🎧 If you have live music, there's room for four or five musicians in the gallery overlooking the room.
🎧 Our guests usually appreciate the fact that the music can be loud enough for dancing,
🎧 but not too loud for conversation.
🎧 Yes, I really don't like it when you can't talk.
🎧 Exactly.
🎧 Now the Adelphi Room is at the back of the hotel,
🎧 and there are French windows leading out onto the terrace.
🎧 This has a beautiful display of pots of roses at that time of the year.
🎧 Which direction does it face?
🎧 Southwest,
🎧 so that side of the hotel gets the sun in the afternoon and early evening.
🎧 Very nice.
🎧 From the terrace you can see the area of trees within the grounds of the hotel,
🎧 or you can stroll through there to the river - that's on the far side,
🎧 so it isn't visible from the hotel.
🎧 OK.
🎧 Then another option is the Carlton Room.
🎧 This is a bit bigger - it can hold up to 110 people
🎧 and it has the advantage of a stage, which is useful if you have any entertainment,
🎧 or indeed a small band can fit onto it.
🎧 And can you go outside from the room?
🎧 No, the Carlton Room is on the first floor,
🎧 but on one side the windows look out onto the lake.
🎧 Lovely.
🎧 I think either of those rooms would be suitable.
🎧 Can I tell you about some of the options we offer in addition?
🎧 Please do.
🎧 As well as a meal, you can have an MC, a Master of Ceremonies,
🎧 who'll be with you throughout the party.
🎧 What exactly is the MC's function?
🎧 I suppose they make a speech during the meal if we need one, do they?
🎧 That's right.
🎧 All our MCs are trained as public speakers,
🎧 so they can easily get people's attention -
🎧 many guests are glad to have someone who can make themselves heard above the chatter!
🎧 And they're also your support -
🎧 if anything goes wrong, the MC will deal with it, so you can relax.
🎧 Great!
🎧 I'll need to ask you about food,
🎧 but something else that's important is accommodation.
🎧 You obviously have rooms in the hotel,
🎧 but do you also have any other accommodation, like cabins, for example?
🎧 Yes, there are five in the grounds, all self-contained.
🎧 They each sleep two to four people and have their own living room, bathroom and small kitchen.
🎧 That sounds perfect for what we'll need.
🎧 Now you have various facilities, don't you?
🎧 Are they all included in the price of hiring the room?
🎧 The pool, for instance.
🎧 Normally you'd be able to use it,
🎧 but it'll be closed throughout September for refurbishment, I'm afraid.
🎧 The gym will be available, though, at no extra charge.
🎧 That's open all day, from six in the morning until midnight.
🎧 Right.
🎧 And the tennis courts, but there is a small additional payment for those.
🎧 We have four courts, and it's worth booking in advance if you possibly can,
🎧 as there can be quite a long waiting list for them!
🎧 Right.
🎧 Now could we discuss the food?
🎧 This would be dinner, around seven o'clock…
🎧 
🎧 Hello everyone.
🎧 I'm Jake Stevens and I'm your rep here at the hotel.
🎧 I'm sure you'll all have a great time here.
🎧 So let me tell you a bit about what's on offer.
🎧 I'll start by telling you about some of the excursions that are available for guests.
🎧 One thing you have to do while you're here is go dolphin watching.
🎧 On our boat trips, we pretty well guarantee you'll see dolphins -
🎧 if you don't you can repeat the trip free of charge.
🎧 We organise daily trips for just 35 euros.
🎧 Unfortunately there aren't any places left for this afternoon's trip,
🎧 but come and see me to book for later in the week.
🎧 If you're energetic, I'd recommend our forest walk.
🎧 It's a guided walk of about seven kilometres.
🎧 There'll be a stop half way, and you'll be provided with a drink and sandwiches.
🎧 There's some fairly steep climbs up the hills,
🎧 so you need to be reasonably fit for this one,
🎧 with good shoes, and bring a waterproof in case it rains.
🎧 It's just 25 euros all inclusive, and it's every Wednesday.
🎧 Then on Thursdays we organise a cycle trip,
🎧 which will give you all the fun of biking without the effort.
🎧 We'll take you and your bike up to the top of Mount Larna,
🎧 and leave you to bike back -
🎧 it's a 700-metre drop in just 20 kilometres
🎧 so this isn't really for inexperienced cyclists as you'll be going pretty fast.
🎧 And if it's a clear day, you'll have fantastic views.
🎧 On our local craft tour you can find out about the traditional activities in the island.
🎧 And the best thing about this trip is that it's completely free.
🎧 You'll be taken to a factory where jewellery is made, and also a ceramics centre.
🎧 If you want, you can buy some of the products but that's entirely up to you.
🎧 The trip starts after lunch on Thursday, and you'll return by 6 pm.
🎧 If you're interested in astronomy you may already know that the island's one of the best places in the world to observe the night sky.
🎧 We can offer trips to the observatory on Friday for those who are interested.
🎧 They cost 90 euros per person
🎧 and you'll be shown the huge telescopes and have a talk from an expert,
🎧 who'll explain all about how they work.
🎧 Afterwards we'll head down to Sunset Beach,
🎧 where you can have a dip in the ocean if you want before we head off back to the hotel.
🎧 Finally, there's horse riding.
🎧 This is organised by the Equestrian Centre over near Playa Cortino
🎧 and it's a great experience if you're a keen horseback rider,
🎧 or even if you've never been on a horse before.
🎧 They take you down to the beach,
🎧 and you can canter along the sand and through the waves.
🎧 It costs 35 euros and it's available every day.
🎧 So there's plenty to do in the daytime, but what about night life?
🎧 Well, the number one attraction's called 'Musical Favourites'.
🎧 Guests enjoy a three-course meal and unlimited free drinks, and watch a fantastic show,
🎧 starting with musicals set in Paris and then crossing the Atlantic to Las Vegas
🎧 and finally Copacabana.
🎧 At the end the cast members come down from the stage, still in their stunning costumes,
🎧 and you'll have a chance to chat with them.
🎧 It's hugely popular, so let me know now if you're interested because it's no good leaving it until the last minute.
🎧 It's on Friday night.
🎧 Tickets are just 50 euros each, but for an extra 10 euros you can have a table right by the stage.
🎧 If you'd like to go back in time, there's the Castle Feast on Saturday evening.
🎧 It's held in a twelfth-century castle, and you eat in the great courtyard,
🎧 with ladies in long gowns serving your food.
🎧 You're given a whole chicken each, which you eat in the medieval way, using your hands instead of cutlery,
🎧 and you're entertained by competitions where the horseback riders attempt to knock one another off their horses.
🎧 Then you can watch the dancers in the ballroom and join in as well if you want.
🎧 OK, so now if anyone…
🎧 
🎧 Hello, Trevor.
🎧 Hello, Stephanie.
🎧 You said you wanted to talk about the course I'm taking on literature for children.
🎧 That's right.
🎧 I'm thinking of doing it next year, but I'd like to find out more about it first.
🎧 OK, well, as you probably know, it's a one-year course.
🎧 It's divided into six modules, and you have to take all of them.
🎧 One of the most interesting ones, for me, at least,
🎧 was about the purpose of children's literature.
🎧 You mean, whether it should just entertain children or should be educational, as well.
🎧 Right, and whether the teaching should be factual - giving them information about the world - or ethical, teaching them values.
🎧 What's fascinating is that the writer isn't necessarily conscious of the message they're conveying.
🎧 For instance, a story might show a child who has a problem as a result of not doing what an adult has told them to do,
🎧 implying that children should always obey adults.
🎧 Ah... I see what you mean.
🎧 That module made me realise how important stories are -
🎧 they can have a significant effect on children as they grow up.
🎧 Actually, it inspired me to have a go at it myself, just for my own interest.
🎧 I know I can't compete with the really popular stories, like the Harry Potter books - they're very good,
🎧 and even young kids like my seven-year-old niece love reading them.
🎧 I'm very interested in illustrations in stories.
🎧 Is that covered in the course?
🎧 Yes, there's a module on pictures,
🎧 and how they're sometimes central to the story.
🎧 Mm.. that's good.
🎧 I remember some frightening ones I saw as a child and I can still see them vividly in my mind, years later!
🎧 Pictures can be so powerful, just as powerful as words.
🎧 I've always enjoyed drawing, so that's the field I want to go into when I finish the course.
🎧 I bet that module will be really helpful.
🎧 I'm sure it will.
🎧 We also studied comics in that module,
🎧 but I'm not convinced of their value, not compared with books.
🎧 One of the great things about words is that you use your imagination,
🎧 but with a comic you don't have to.
🎧 But children are so used to visual input - on TV, video games, and so on.
🎧 There are plenty of kids who wouldn't even try to read a book,
🎧 so I think comics can serve a really useful purpose.
🎧 You mean, it's better to read a comic than not to read at all?
🎧 Yes, I suppose you're right.
🎧 I just think its sad when children don't read books.
🎧 What about books for girls and books for boys?
🎧 Does the course go into that?
🎧 Yes, there's a module on it.
🎧 For years, lots of stories, in English, at least, assumed that boys went out and did adventurous things
🎧 and girls stayed at home and played with dolls.
🎧 I was amazed how many books were targeted at just one sex or the other.
🎧 Of course this reflects society as it is when the books are written.
🎧 That's true.
🎧 So it sounds as though you think it's a good course.
🎧 Definitely.
🎧 Have you been reading lots of children's stories, to help you decide whether to take the course?
🎧 Yeah. I've gone as far back as the late seventeenth century,
🎧 though I know there were earlier children's stories.
🎧 So does that mean you've read Perrault's fairy tales?
🎧 Cinderella, The Sleeping Beauty, and so on.
🎧 Yes!
🎧 They must be important, because no stories of that type had been written before,
🎧 these were the first.
🎧 Then there's The Swiss Family Robinson.
🎧 I haven't read that.
🎧 The English name makes it sound as though Robinson is the family's surname,
🎧 but a more accurate translation would be The Swiss Robinsons,
🎧 because it's about a Swiss family who are shipwrecked,
🎧 like Robinson Crusoe in the novel of a century earlier.
🎧 Well I never knew that!
🎧 Have you read Hoffmann's The Nutcracker and the Mouse King?
🎧 Wasn't that the basis for Tchaikovsky's ballet The Nutcracker?
🎧 That's right.
🎧 It has some quite bizarre elements.
🎧 I hope you've read Oscar Wilde's The Happy Prince.
🎧 It's probably my favourite children's story of all time.
🎧 Oh.. mine too!
🎧 And it's so surprising, because Wilde is best known for his plays,
🎧 and most of them are very witty, but The Happy Prince is really moving.
🎧 I struggled with Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings...
🎧 three long books, and I gave up after one.
🎧 It's extremely popular, though.
🎧 Yeah, but whereas something like The Happy Prince just carried me along with it,
🎧 The Lord of the Rings took more effort than I was prepared to give it.
🎧 I didn't find that - I love it.
🎧 Another one I've read is War Horse.
🎧 Oh yes. It's about the First World War, isn't it?
🎧 Hardly what you'd expect for a children's story.
🎧 Exactly, but it's been very successful.
🎧 Have you read any…
🎧 
🎧 In today's class I'm going to talk about marine archaeology,
🎧 the branch of archaeology focusing on human interaction with the sea, lakes and rivers.
🎧 It's the study of ships, cargoes, shipping facilities, and other physical remains.
🎧 I'll give you an example,
🎧 then go on to show how this type of research is being transformed by the use of the latest technology.
🎧 Atlit-Yam was a village on the coast of the eastern Mediterranean,
🎧 which seems to have been thriving until around 7,000 BC.
🎧 The residents kept cattle, caught fish and stored grain.
🎧 They had wells for fresh water,
🎧 many of their houses were built around a courtyard and were constructed of stone.
🎧 The village contained an impressive monument:
🎧 seven half-tonne stones standing in a semicircle around a spring,
🎧 that might have been used for ceremonial purposes.
🎧 Atlit-Yam may have been destroyed swiftly by a tsunami,
🎧 or climate change may have caused glaciers to melt and sea levels to rise, flooding the village gradually.
🎧 Whatever the cause, it now lies ten metres below the surface of the Mediterranean,
🎧 buried under sand at the bottom of the sea.
🎧 It's been described as the largest and best preserved prehistoric settlement ever found on the seabed.
🎧 For marine archaeologists, Atlit-Yam is a treasure trove.
🎧 Research on the buildings, tools and the human remains has revealed how the bustling village once functioned,
🎧 and even what diseases some of its residents suffered from.
🎧 But of course this is only one small village, one window into a lost world.
🎧 For a fuller picture, researchers need more sunken settlements,
🎧 but the hard part is finding them.
🎧 Underwater research used to require divers to find shipwrecks or artefacts,
🎧 but in the second half of the twentieth century, various types of underwater vehicles were developed,
🎧 some controlled from a ship on the surface, and some of them autonomous,
🎧 which means they don't need to be operated by a person.
🎧 Autonomous underwater vehicles, or AUVs,
🎧 are used in the oil industry, for instance, to create maps of the seabed before rigs and pipelines are installed.
🎧 To navigate they use sensors, such as compasses and sonar.
🎧 Until relatively recently they were very expensive, and so heavy that they had to be launched from a large vessel with a winch.
🎧 But the latest AUVs are much easier to manoeuvre -
🎧 they can be launched from the shore or a small ship.
🎧 And they're much cheaper, which makes them more accessible to research teams.
🎧 They're also very sophisticated.
🎧 They can communicate with each other and, for example,
🎧 work out the most efficient way to survey a site,
🎧 or to find particular objects on the seabed.
🎧 Field tests show the approach can work.
🎧 For example, in a trial in 2015,
🎧 three AUVs searched for wrecks at Marzamemi, off the coast of Sicily.
🎧 The site is the final resting place of an ancient Roman ship,
🎧 which sank in the sixth century AD
🎧 while ferrying prefabricated marble elements for the construction of an early church.
🎧 The AUVs mapped the area in detail, finding other ships carrying columns of the same material.
🎧 Creating an internet in the sea for AUVs to communicate is no easy matter.
🎧 Wifi networks on land use electromagnetic waves,
🎧 but in water these will only travel a few centimetres.
🎧 Instead, a more complex mix of technologies is required.
🎧 For short distances, AUVs can share data using light,
🎧 while acoustic waves are used to communicate over long distances.
🎧 But more creative solutions are also being developed,
🎧 where an AUV working on the seabed offloads data to a second AUV,
🎧 which then surfaces and beams the data home to the research team using a satellite.
🎧 There's also a system that enables AUVs to share information from seabed scans, and other data.
🎧 So if an AUV surveying the seabed finds an intriguing object,
🎧 it can share the coordinates of the object - that is, its position -
🎧 with a nearby AUV that carries superior cameras,
🎧 and arrange for that AUV to make a closer inspection of the object.
🎧 Marine archaeologists are excited about the huge potential of these AUVs for their discipline.
🎧 One site where they're going to be deployed is the Gulf of Baratti, off the Italian coast.
🎧 In 1974, a 2,000-year-old Roman vessel was discovered here, in 18 metres of water.
🎧 When it sank, it was carrying medical goods, in wooden or tin receptacles.
🎧 Its cargo gives us insight into the treatments available all those years ago,
🎧 including tablets that are thought to have been dissolved to form a cleansing liquid for the eyes.
🎧 Other Roman ships went down nearby, taking their cargoes with them.
🎧 Some held huge pots made of terracotta.
🎧 Some were used for transporting cargoes of olive oil, and others held wine.
🎧 In many cases it's only these containers that remain,
🎧 while the wooden ships have been buried under silt on the seabed.
🎧 Another project...
