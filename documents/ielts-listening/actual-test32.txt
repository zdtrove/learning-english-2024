🎧 Hello, how may I help you?
🎧 Well, I've been seeing these yellow boxes in front of a lot of houses in my neighbourhood.
🎧 just wondered what they were for.
🎧 I noticed your phone number on all of them, so I called.
🎧 Could you tell me about your business?
🎧 We do do recycling, but we're not a business.
🎧 Gaea's Guardians is a non-profit group.
🎧 We encourage recycling as a way of protecting the environment.
🎧 I don't know.
🎧 I mean it is a good idea.
🎧 But I really don't read the newspaper every day or anything.
🎧 And we don't come collect newspapers every day!
🎧 In fact, we only do pickups every other week.
🎧 Oh, well then maybe I could help.
🎧 I mean in my neighbourhood, there's too much rubbish lying around everywhere.
🎧 I'd like to help out, I guess.
🎧 That's great, sir.
🎧 You're doing the right thing.
🎧 OK, I need to get your contact information.
🎧 What's your name, please?
🎧 Peter Wisrough.
🎧 Peter... how do you spell your last name?
🎧 Wisrow?
🎧 No, actually it's Wisrough.
🎧 Oh, I'm sorry. I'm a terrible speller.
🎧 You're a good speller.
🎧 It's just that my family are terrible pronouncers!
🎧 You're quite a card, Peter!
🎧 OK, now what's your address?
🎧 No. 168 Bridge Road.
🎧 That's here in London.
🎧 How about if I have any questions?
🎧 I'm sending you a copy of our booklet, too.
🎧 The booklet has our phone number and our e-mail address,
🎧 helpline@blackcat.com,
🎧 that's helpline@blackcat.com
🎧 But I nearly forgot to ask, what's your postcode?
🎧 BS97PU.
🎧 PS97BU?
🎧 No. That's B as in "boy" S-9-7-P as in "Peter" U.
🎧 So, I'm guessing those yellow boxes I saw are for recycled newspapers?
🎧 Yes, that is correct, and it's free of charge.
🎧 Wow, that's good news!
🎧 Do you recycle anything besides newspaper?
🎧 Oh yes, we recycle most everything.
🎧 Glass, plastic, paper...
🎧 Oh, so I can put like glass and plastic bottles in the box?
🎧 Sorry again. Things like that you have to bring to our collection centre
🎧 And where is that?
🎧 Our main centre isn't that far from you.
🎧 It's actually right on the East Side of Central Park.
🎧 That new blue building?
🎧 That's the one!
🎧 Cool. Hey, what's with all those different coloured boxes outside that place?
🎧 Oh, that's for the different materials we recycle.
🎧 The blue is for metal, the green is for glass and plastics,
🎧 and the yellow of course is for paper.
🎧 Hmm, okay. I'll try and manage to keep all that straight.
🎧 Oh, no need, they're each labelled.
🎧 Great. So which one would I put magazines in?
🎧 Actually, they don't go in any of the bins.
🎧 Unfortunately, magazines can't be recycled because of the material they're made of.
🎧 It's such a waste.
🎧 So would you be interested in volunteering?
🎧 Um, I'll think about it.
🎧 Could you send me some more info?
🎧 Absolutely.
🎧 Along with the newspaper box, I'll be sending you our booklet,
🎧 "Savvy", that is S-A-V-V-Y.
🎧 It tells you about what you can do to protect the environment in your daily life.
🎧 Plus it lists things you can do as a volunteer with our group.
🎧 Hey, that's cool, thanks!
🎧 My pleasure.
🎧 Do you have any other questions or concerns?
🎧 Nope, that's it!
🎧 
🎧 Welcome everyone to today's seminar on "CV and Interview Skills".
🎧 Remember, your CV is probably the most important document you will ever write.
🎧 It opens the door to your career!
🎧 And that job interview is probably the most important meeting you will ever attend.
🎧 It's like stepping through that open door.
🎧 So let's roll up our sleeves and get down to work, shall we?
🎧 First of all, I cannot possibly tell you everything you need to know about writing a résumé in the time we have.
🎧 But let me tell you that there are dozens of great websites on the Internet.
🎧 These will give you all the suggestions you need.
🎧 If you look at the paper I gave you,
🎧 you will see a list of the dozen most popular sites.
🎧 I can mention a couple of important points, however.
🎧 One is that your CV or résumé should not be too long.
🎧 A page is about right. Why?
🎧 HR departments do not have the time to read long documents.
🎧 Too many people are sending too many CVs!
🎧 After all, the economic crisis of 2008 is still very much alive.
🎧 Everyone needs a job now.
🎧 No matter how short you make that résumé, though,
🎧 you do not want to forget to tell HR how to contact your references.
🎧 References are people who will give you a recommendation for a job.
🎧 That's usually an ex-boss or a professor who knows you well.
🎧 Do not use relatives!
🎧 I don't care how much your mum loves you.
🎧 Also, when you send that CV, be sure to include a typed cover letter.
🎧 A cover letter is a letter where you, basically, are asking for a job.
🎧 It's like introducing yourself.
🎧 Make it brief.
🎧 The real information about you is on that CV of yours.
🎧 And, please make sure the letter is typed!
🎧 It doesn't matter if your handwriting is beautiful or not.
🎧 Companies only read typed letters.
🎧 Another point about CVs is you should try to have an attractive layout.
🎧 Maybe use different typefonts or colours to highlight information.
🎧 Some people include a photo.
🎧 You can find dozens of examples on the Internet.
🎧 Whatever layout you decide to use, however, avoid all spelling and grammar errors.
🎧 I used to be an HR manager.
🎧 If I saw a mistake, that CV went into the garbage.
🎧 Something you write in a CV is a description of your skills and experiences in an interesting way.
🎧 Mention training, too.
🎧 I mean these are what get you hired!
🎧 Do not just say, "I have lots of experience." or "I have many skills".
🎧 Tell that boss what you did, for what company, and when.
🎧 Better, tell him how well you did it!
🎧 Don't just say, "I sold houses".
🎧 Say, "I sold two million pounds worth of houses in my first year".
🎧 That is, say something to make the person reading excited and curious.
🎧 Finally, speaking of CVs, it's sad.
🎧 But some people actually forget to provide a contact number.
🎧 That's pretty silly.
🎧 You wrote a great CV, you have HR dying to meet you...
🎧 and they don't know how.
🎧 You forgot your phone number!
🎧 Oh sure, if you apply online, they have your e-mail address.
🎧 But you just showed them you're forgetful.
🎧 Why are they going to want to talk to you after that?
🎧 Alright, moving on to the actual interview,
🎧 I'll go over what you need to know by the end of it,
🎧 and what you can discuss and negotiate on later once it looks like you'll be offered the job.
🎧 First, there's working hours.
🎧 It's not that necessary to hammer out the hours off the bat,
🎧 especially since it's easy to come off as lazy when the first thing you bring up is how much you're going to have to work.
🎧 You can also find out more about possible promotions later on.
🎧 It is important, however, to get a feel for how much you'll be paid.
🎧 You should make sure the salary range is commensurate with what you're worth,
🎧 and if you're not, you can move on to better opportunities.
🎧 Being sure you're going to make what you want to live on
🎧 is much more important than issues like your pension,
🎧 you're all so young that your pension is not going to matter for quite a long time.
🎧 You should find out about what skills you must know for the job and what they'll teach you.
🎧 In addition, if the company will provide training,
🎧 you should find out how long the training period is and whether it is paid.
🎧 Beware of any jobs that want you to train for a long time without appropriate compensation.
🎧 Speaking of compensation, find out about holidays as well.
🎧 Do you get paid vacation time?
🎧 Are you allowed to take personal days?
🎧 Do you have to work on national holidays?
🎧 Once you work out these main issues,
🎧 you can move on later to details like the location and expected attire and whatnot.
🎧 Wow, that's a lot of information!
🎧 Let's take a break so you can think everything over and ask any questions you may have.
🎧 Don't hesitate to come and see me if you need any clarification on all this stuff!
🎧 
🎧 Hello, are you Dr Lindsey?
🎧 The Returning Students Advisor?
🎧 Yes, that's right. Are you Frank?
🎧 Your appointment wasn't until 2:00, but that's OK.
🎧 Please come in and have a seat.
🎧 Thanks, I like to arrive early whenever I have anything to do.
🎧 That's certainly a praiseworthy habit.
🎧 Let me see, it looks like you've taken a long break from school,
🎧 and I understand you wanted to have a chat about what you should study
🎧 if and when you return for further classes.
🎧 It's such a big challenge.
🎧 I don't know if I'm crazy for doing this or not!
🎧 Believe it or not, I know exactly what you mean.
🎧 Before I began working here at the university, I taught primary school for nearly 10 years.
🎧 It takes a lot of courage to go back to school!
🎧 I feel more shy and scared than the primary students I teach!
🎧 In the schools I taught, I found today's youngsters are very sure of themselves.
🎧 In terms of intelligence, I have a lot to teach them.
🎧 And the maturity level of much of my class leaves something to be desired.
🎧 But in terms of confidence, wow!
🎧 A lot more confident than I am now, that's for sure!
🎧 Stop fretting.
🎧 "A brave man is a coward who refuses to run".
🎧 Let's talk about your strong points.
🎧 You seem an intelligent man.
🎧 What is it you would like to study?
🎧 You see, I've been teaching children for a few years,
🎧 but I think I'm happier teaching adults.
🎧 I think teaching students in middle school is much more satisfying
🎧 because they end up being much more grateful for your work.
🎧 If I may ask, what got you interested in teaching adults?
🎧 A lot of things, I guess.
🎧 I met my future wife back in my first year of college.
🎧 She always complains that I was more interesting then.
🎧 She says that now I talk like I'm 7 years old!
🎧 That's probably from being with children all day.
🎧 Haha! Again I know just what you mean.
🎧 My husband used to say the same thing about me when I taught kindergarten.
🎧 Anything else?
🎧 Well, yes.
🎧 Fairly often now I run into former students and we talk.
🎧 Some of them are getting close to being grown up.
🎧 I guess I think more and more about how people develop over time.
🎧 So, I'm interested in the results of education, you know, the final stages.
🎧 I see.
🎧 Well, coming back to the university can be both difficult and very rewarding.
🎧 There are some problems unique to returning students, you know, older students like yourself.
🎧 What do you think is your greatest weakness?
🎧 Well, I actually think my confidence is getting better.
🎧 I'm definitely overcoming my introversion
🎧 and starting to be much more comfortable in front of a class.
🎧 To tell the truth, I'm afraid I'm rather behind the times about many things.
🎧 It's more difficult for me to chase after the popular things youngsters are fond of
🎧 such as Iphone, Twitter, if you name it!
🎧 I think I understand.
🎧 How old are you, 35?
🎧 People at your age still go back to school for further education.
🎧 I was a bit the same way.
🎧 I mean I didn't study at university till after I had a family: a husband and one child.
🎧 My point of view was a lot different from your average eighteen-year-old girl's, I can tell you!
🎧 Gee, that sounds pretty rough.
🎧 A family and college?
🎧 Clearly you weren't unsuccessful though!
🎧 It was, Frank. It truly was.
🎧 My first term at school was extremely stressful.
🎧 But excuse me! You're not here to listen to my life story.
🎧 We're talking about your plans.
🎧 Is there anything unique I should know about you or your past experience or plans?
🎧 I'm afraid not. There is nothing interesting about my career or plans.
🎧 It's really not too impressive.
🎧 Now, I forbid you to talk like that.
🎧 This is your one life, and if you're not interested, why bother living it?
🎧 Don't be so humble, Frank.
🎧 OK, OK. My wife says I'm a wimp.
🎧 Let's talk about your dreams a bit.
🎧 You want to teach adults, you said.
🎧 What would you like to teach them?
🎧 Well, when I first came to college, I really liked Languages and Literature.
🎧 A lot of people have told me that for practical reasons,
🎧 it'd be more rewarding to choose Business Management as my major,
🎧 but I made up my mind to study Liberal Arts once I got the idea of going back to school.
🎧 I must say it's refreshing to meet someone who knows there's more to an education than computers and finance.
🎧 Let's have a look at the university course catalogue...
🎧 Excuse me, Dr Lindsey. Before we do that,
🎧 could I maybe ask you some questions about changes in university life?
🎧 I think I need to discuss that so I know what to expect.
🎧 Of course. I'm here to help you.
🎧 The biggest thing to get used to is the change in technology.
🎧 Professors present things on huge screens,
🎧 many of which are interactive computerised whiteboards.
🎧 You can write on them still and use them like a touch screen.
🎧 They're really handy!
🎧 No more sloppy scribbled notes on the projector.
🎧 Let's see, I doubt you'll be living in student housing,
🎧 so I won't go into all the improvements there.
🎧 Another major change that you'll enjoy is the plethora of resources available for students.
🎧 As a student, you have 24-hour access to the gym,
🎧 and library privileges that include the use of school computers to scan, copy, and print,
🎧 and of course the Media Library, which contains movies from all genres
🎧 and most of the movies listed on AFI's Top 100 Movies of All Time.
🎧 The dining facilities are also not what they used to be.
🎧 They offer choices for all diets, and you can expect a hot meal any time of day.
🎧 Wow, things really have changed!
🎧 I'll be sure to utilise all those great facilities in my time here.
🎧 Thanks for all your help, Dr Lindsey.
🎧 I think that's all the questions I have for now.
🎧 
🎧 OK and welcome back.
🎧 During the short break we just took,
🎧 several of you approached me with questions.
🎧 So, before going on with the orientation talk,
🎧 I'd like to address those queries.
🎧 As I've found, if one person asks a question,
🎧 probably a dozen others are wondering about the same thing!
🎧 The first question is whether Wassamatta University employs modules technology as an instruction method.
🎧 The answer is yes, we do.
🎧 At least that's what the university catalogue says.
🎧 If some of you don't understand what "modules technology" is, don't worry.
🎧 I googled the word but couldn't find it.
🎧 Apparently, though, it's a method of broadband, wireless access.
🎧 At least that's what an American company's website told me.
🎧 But again, don't worry.
🎧 If you need to know something more, your professor can tell you.
🎧 Another question someone asked me
🎧 was what tomorrow's workshop on "Research Methods and Skills" was about.
🎧 Well, research skills include any method you can imagine
🎧 for finding and presenting any information you need.
🎧 That's not just schoolwork, either.
🎧 Writing English - the native language for most of you,
🎧 and finding a job are also research skills.
🎧 And, yes, those will be addressed in tomorrow's workshop.
🎧 As you know, Wassamatta University
🎧 is one of this country's premier universities for the study of "the dismal science", economics.
🎧 Some of you, it seems, want to get a jump on their classmates.
🎧 During the break, half a dozen of you came up and asked me where to find economics tomes.
🎧 I know it's odd, but this school's library holdings are divided up between two libraries.
🎧 Economics books are in the old library.
🎧 If you look out of the window behind me, you can see it.
🎧 It's the red brick building.
🎧 Oh, before I forget, you economics types also need a lot of math, am I right?
🎧 Well, those Math books are neither in the old library nor in the new one.
🎧 They can be found in the Maths Department Building.
🎧 Why am I telling you this?
🎧 Doesn't "the Invisible Hand" guide economists?
🎧 Maybe it's good you asked:
🎧 in 2008, that Hand shoved most of the world economy off a cliff, didn't it?
🎧 Now I realise that most of you couldn't bring a computer printer or a photocopier from home.
🎧 So I'm sure you're already wondering where you can copy things like term papers,
🎧 Internet articles, and things like that.
🎧 I have some good news and some bad news.
🎧 The good news is that there are a number of places you can make copies.
🎧 These include both libraries and Student Union Building.
🎧 Now the bad news. I'm sorry to say,
🎧 most classroom buildings and academic departments do not have copiers students can use.
🎧 So most of the large buildings you see around campus do not have copiers for students.
🎧 The copiers there are reserved for professors and office staff.
🎧 Oh, yes! I nearly forgot to tell you.
🎧 If you need to have printing done, all the copiers available to students are laser printers.
🎧 Plus, for your convenience, you can pay using prepaid cards.
🎧 You can get those in the Student Union Building.
🎧 That just covers the questions put to me.
🎧 If you have more, please see me during the next break at 2:15.
🎧 Right now, though, I'd like to start to give you a rundown on the various facilities here on campus.
🎧 That way, you won't get lost so easily in the weeks to come.
🎧 I've been told that this year's incoming class features a large number of married students and parents.
🎧 So, you must be wondering where to put the baby while you're in class.
🎧 OK, right now, we're in the Student Union Building, right?
🎧 Remember the big doors in front where you all came in?
🎧 If you go out of the building, you can see the Nursery is just on the other side of this building.
🎧 It's only about 20 metres away!
🎧 Convenient, eh?
🎧 Next, we're all from different places around the country.
🎧 Some of you are from other countries.
🎧 That means we're pretty likely to get sick during the first months of school as we expose each other to many new viruses.
🎧 So, where's the doctor?
🎧 Of course, you need to find the Medical Services Centre
🎧 which is on the right as you leave the building.
🎧 Remember, that's the second building on the right.
🎧 And if you look out of that window,
🎧 you can see a lot of antennae and satellite dishes on the roof.
🎧 So that's what we call the Media Centre.
🎧 Yeah, I know, I think it's confusing, too.
🎧 The Media Centre is next to the Medical Centre.
🎧 The chairwoman of the Journalism School on the first floor
🎧 doesn't like it when people who wander in there mistake her for a nurse!
🎧 Chances are you'll have at least one Math class while you're here.
🎧 That red building there just outside to the left is the Math Department Building.
🎧 I know, it looks about as old as the subject of Math,
🎧 but I assure you that the inside is equipped with state-of-the-art classroom equipment
🎧 including interactive chalkboards and surround sound in every room.
🎧 Oh, can you see the back building there?
🎧 Yes, behind the Media Centre. Quite new, isn't it?
🎧 That's the new library, just decorated.
🎧 They're back-to-back, you might say.
🎧 If you look just to the left of it at the lower, older-looking building, you'll find the old library.
🎧 It's nice and quiet - perfect for those marathon study sessions during exam week.
🎧 Since the weather is so nice,
🎧 why don't we stop looking at our maps but go for a walk around the campus?
