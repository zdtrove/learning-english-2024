[153] Cam12 - Test 3 - Part 1

🎧 Hello?
🎧 Hi, Susie, it's Paul here.
🎧 How are you?
🎧 Enjoying your new job?
🎧 You're working at the library, aren't you?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 I started when the library re-opened a month ago.
🎧 It's great.
🎧 Actually Carol and I have been meaning to join for a while.
🎧 Oh, you should.
🎧 It doesn't cost anything,
🎧 and the new library has all sorts of facilities.
🎧 It's not just a place where you borrow books.
🎧 For instance, there's an area with comfortable seats where you can sit and read the magazines they have there.
🎧 Some people spend the whole morning there.
🎧 Wish I had that amount of time to spend!
🎧 Yes, you must be pretty busy at present, with the children and everything?
🎧 We are, yes.
🎧 But we're hoping to get away this summer.
🎧 We're thinking of going to Greece.
🎧 Well, we've got a much larger section of the library devoted to travel books now,
🎧 so you should come and have a look.
🎧 I can't remember if there's anything specifically on Greece,
🎧 but I should think so.
🎧 OK.
🎧 Now Carol's organising a project for the history class she teaches at school,
🎧 it's about life in the town a hundred years ago.
🎧 Do you have anything that might be useful?
🎧 Yes, actually we've now got a new section with materials on the history of the town and surrounding region.
🎧 Right. I'll tell her.
🎧 You can't always find that sort of thing on the internet.
🎧 Now in the old library there used to be a separate room with reference books.
🎧 It was a really nice quiet room.
🎧 Yes. We've put those books in the main part of the library now,
🎧 but we do have a room called the community room.
🎧 It can be hired out for meetings,
🎧 but at other times people can use it to study.
🎧 I might use that.
🎧 It's hard to find anywhere quiet at home sometimes.
🎧 I can't remember how old your son and daughter are…
🎧 we've introduced a special section of fiction written specially for teenagers,
🎧 but they might be a bit young for that?
🎧 Yes, they would be.
🎧 Well, we do have lots of activities for younger children.
🎧 Yes?
🎧 For example we have a Science Club.
🎧 At the next meeting, they're going to be doing experiments with stuff that everyone has in the kitchen -
🎧 sugar and flour and so on.
🎧 They might be interested, yes.
🎧 And we have a competition for children called Reading Challenge.
🎧 That doesn't begin until after the end of term.
🎧 They have to read six books,
🎧 and they get a certificate if they manage it.
🎧 So that gives them something to do while they're on holiday, instead of getting bored.
🎧 That's the idea.
🎧 And there's special activities for adults too.
🎧 On Friday we have a local author called Tanya Streep,
🎧 who's going to be talking about her new novel.
🎧 It's called 'Catch the Mouse'
🎧 and she based the story on a crime that actually took place here years ago.
🎧 Right.
🎧 We're not free on Friday, but I'll look out for the book.
🎧 Now this probably isn't for you,
🎧 but we do have IT support available for members.
🎧 We get quite a few older people coming along
🎧 who are wanting to get up to speed with computer technology.
🎧 It's on Tuesday mornings -
🎧 they don't need to make an appointment or anything, they just turn up.
🎧 Well, my mother might be interested,
🎧 I'll let her know.
🎧 OK.
🎧 And there's another service which you wouldn't expect from a library,
🎧 which is a free medical check-up.
🎧 The hospital arranges for someone to come along
🎧 and measure the level of sugar in your blood,
🎧 and they check cholesterol levels at the same time.
🎧 Really?
🎧 Yes, but that's only for the over-60s,
🎧 so you wouldn't qualify.
🎧 OK.
🎧 Well, I'll tell my mother, she might be interested.
🎧 What other information…
🎧 well, we do have a little shop with things like wallcharts and greetings cards,
🎧 and also stamps so you can post the cards straightaway, which is really useful.
🎧 Yeah.
🎧 Well, I'll bring the children round at the weekend and we'll join.
🎧 Oh, one more thing - I'll be bringing the car, is there parking available?
🎧 Yes, and it's free in the evening and at weekends.
🎧 Perfect.
🎧 Well, thanks, Susie...

[154] Cam12 - Test 3 - Part 2

🎧 In this session in your training day we're going to look at some of the more specialised holidays we offer at BC Travel.
🎧 Now, the travel business is very competitive
🎧 and it's important to be aware of how the market's changing and developing.
🎧 In terms of age groups,
🎧 the over-65s are an important market,
🎧 and one that's increasing steadily year on year.
🎧 The fewest holidays are taken by the 31 to 42-year-olds,
🎧 and that figure shows no sign of rising.
🎧 The biggest market at present is still the youngest group,
🎧 the 16 to 30s,
🎧 but this group's also seen the biggest drop over the last few years,
🎧 whereas there's a noticeable growth in the number of holidays taken by the 55 to 64-year-olds.
🎧 As far as the 43 to 54-year-olds are concerned,
🎧 bookings there are steady,
🎧 but I have to say we haven't seen the increase we expected.
🎧 One trend we're noticing with nearly all age groups is the growing popularity of holidays
🎧 in which clients do some kind of specialised activity.
🎧 I'm not talking here about adventure holidays,
🎧 where clients take part in high-risk activities like white water rafting just for the thrill of it.
🎧 Activity holidays usually involve rather less high-risk sports, or things like art and music.
🎧 They're not necessarily cheaper than ordinary holidays, often the opposite, in fact.
🎧 But they do often take place outside the main tourist centres,
🎧 which gives an opportunity for clients to find out more about the local people and customs,
🎧 and many say this is one of the most positive features of these holidays.
🎧 Of course, they offer the chance to develop a new skill or talent,
🎧 but clients often say that more than this,
🎧 it's the chance to create lasting relationships with other like-minded people,
🎧 that's the main draw.
🎧 Let me give you some examples of BC Travel activity holidays.
🎧 Our painting holidays take place in four different centres in France and Italy
🎧 and they're very popular with clients of all abilities from beginners onwards.
🎧 We've got an excellent team of artists to lead the classes -
🎧 some of them have been with us from the start, and five additional ones will be joining us this year
🎧 so that we can offer a greater number of classes in each centre.
🎧 As far as cooking holidays are concerned,
🎧 I know a lot of agents offer holidays where clients cook recipes related to one particular country,
🎧 usually the one they're staying in, but we focus on dishes from a great many different ones.
🎧 Apart from that you'll find the usual emphasis on good quality, organic ingredients -
🎧 that's more or less a given nowadays -
🎧 and there are generally some meat-free recipes included.
🎧 Our photography holidays take place in a wide range of countries from Iceland to Vietnam,
🎧 and clients have the opportunity to see some stunning scenery.
🎧 Groups are small, no more than eight,
🎧 so clients can have one-on-one tuition during the holiday,
🎧 and excursions are arranged with fully-trained guides.
🎧 At the end of each holiday an exhibition is held of the photographs taken
🎧 so that clients can see one another's work and receive valuable feedback from the tutor.
🎧 Finally, let me tell you about our fitness holidays.
🎧 In Ireland and Italy we run one-week general fitness classes for all ages and levels of fitness.
🎧 Clients start the course with a consultation with a trainer,
🎧 and together they draw up an individual programme.
🎧 As well as improving general fitness,
🎧 clients find that they end up losing much of the stress they've built up in their daily lives.
🎧 In Greece, we have a two-week holiday for clients who want to do something about their weight.
🎧 This has all the features you'd expect, like a personalised diet programme,
🎧 but one of its most popular features is that the exercise classes are all held on the beach.
🎧 People say it's far preferable to being in a gym.
🎧 Finally, we offer several holidays in Morocco.
🎧 One very popular one is the mountain biking holiday.
🎧 Bikes are provided and there are different routes according to people's ability.
🎧 We offer one which is tailored to the needs of families, which is particularly popular.
🎧 OK, so that's about all the time I have today, so...

[155] Cam12 - Test 3 - Part 3

🎧 Dave, I'm worried about our case study.
🎧 I've done a bit of reading, but I'm not sure what's involved in actually writing a case study.
🎧 I missed the lecture where Dr Baker talked us through it.
🎧 OK, well it's quite straightforward.
🎧 We've got our focus - that's tourism at the Horton Castle site.
🎧 And you said you'd done some reading about it.
🎧 Yes, I found some articles and made notes of the main points.
🎧 Did you remember to keep a record of where you got the information from?
🎧 Sure.
🎧 I know what a pain it is when you forget that.
🎧 OK, so we can compare what we've read.
🎧 Then we have to decide on a particular problem or need at our site.
🎧 And then think about who we're going to interview to get more information.
🎧 OK.
🎧 So who'd that be?
🎧 The people who work there?
🎧 And presumably some of the tourists too?
🎧 Yes, both those groups.
🎧 So we'll have to go to the site to do that, I suppose.
🎧 But we might also do some of our interviewing away from the site -
🎧 we could even contact some people here in the city,
🎧 like administrators involved in overseeing tourism.
🎧 OK. So we'll need to think about our interview questions and...
🎧 fix times and places for the meetings.
🎧 It's all going to take a lot of time.
🎧 And if we can, we should ask our interviewees if they can bring along some numerical data
🎧 that we can add to support our findings.
🎧 And photographs?
🎧 I think we have plenty of those already.
🎧 But Dr Baker also said
🎧 we have to establish with our interviewees whether we can identify them in our case study,
🎧 or whether they want to be anonymous.
🎧 Oh, I wouldn't have thought of that.
🎧 OK, once we've got all this information, I suppose we have to analyse it.
🎧 Yes, put it all together and choose what's relevant to the problem we're focusing on,
🎧 and analyse that carefully to find out if we can identify any trends or regularities there.
🎧 That's the main thing at this stage, rather than concentrating on details or lots of facts.
🎧 OK. And then once we've analysed that, what next?
🎧 Well, then we need to think about what we do with the data we've selected
🎧 to make it as clear as possible to our readers.
🎧 Things like graphs, or tables, or charts.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Then the case study itself is mostly quite standard;
🎧 we begin by presenting the problem, and giving some background,
🎧 then go through the main sections,
🎧 but the thing that surprised me is that in a normal report
🎧 we'd end with some suggestions to deal with the problem or need we identified,
🎧 but in a case study we end up with a question or a series of questions to our readers,
🎧 and they decide what ought to be done.
🎧 Oh, I hadn't realised that.
🎧 So basically, the problem we're addressing in our case study of the Horton Castle site
🎧 is why so few tourists are visiting it.
🎧 And we'll find out more from our interviews,
🎧 but I did find one report on the internet that suggested that one reason might be because...
🎧 as far as transport goes, access is difficult.
🎧 I read that too, but that report was actually written ten years ago,
🎧 when the road there was really bad, but that's been improved now.
🎧 And I think there's plenty of fascinating stuff there for a really good day out,
🎧 but you'd never realise it from the castle website -
🎧 maybe that's the problem.
🎧 Yes, it's really dry and boring.
🎧 I read somewhere a suggestion that what the castle needs is a visitor centre.
🎧 So we could have a look for some information about that on the internet.
🎧 What would we need to know?
🎧 Well, who'd use it for a start.
🎧 It'd be good to know what categories the visitors fell into too,
🎧 like school parties or retired people,
🎧 but I think we'd have to talk to staff to get that information.
🎧 OK. And as we're thinking of suggesting a visitor centre
🎧 we'd also have to look at potential problems.
🎧 I mean, obviously it wouldn't be cheap to set up.
🎧 No, but it could be a really good investment.
🎧 And as it's on a historical site it'd need to get special planning permission, I expect.
🎧 That might be hard.
🎧 Right, especially as the only possible place for it would be at the entrance,
🎧 and that's right in front of the castle.
🎧 But it could be a good thing for the town of Horton.
🎧 At present it's a bit of a ghost town.
🎧 Once they've left school and got any skills or qualifications,
🎧 the young people all get out as fast as they can to get jobs in the city,
🎧 and the only people left are children and those who've retired.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Something else we could investigate would be the potential damage that tourists might cause to the castle site,
🎧 I mean their environmental impact.
🎧 At present the tourists can just wander round wherever they want,
🎧 but if numbers increase, there might have to be some restrictions, like sticking to marked ways.
🎧 And there'd need to be guides and wardens around to make sure these were enforced.
🎧 Yes, we could look at that too.
🎧 OK, well…

[156] Cam12 - Test 3 - Part 4

🎧 OK, so we've been looking at how man-made changes in our environment can affect wildlife.
🎧 Now I'll discuss a particular example.
🎧 Let's take a look at mercury.
🎧 Mercury's one of the 120 or so elements that make up all matter,
🎧 and it has the symbol Hg.
🎧 It's a shiny, silvery substance.
🎧 You may have seen it in old-fashioned thermometers,
🎧 but it's not used much for domestic purposes now
🎧 because it's highly toxic.
🎧 But the problem is that the amount of mercury in the environment's increasing.
🎧 The main reason for this is the power plants used to produce electricity.
🎧 The main source of energy that most of them use is still coal,
🎧 and when it's burned it releases mercury into the atmosphere.
🎧 Some of this gets deposited into lakes and rivers,
🎧 and if it's ingested by a fish it's not excreted,
🎧 it stays in the fish's body and it enters the food chain.
🎧 So it's been known for some time that birds which eat fish may be affected,
🎧 but what wasn't known until quite recently is that those that eat insects can also be affected.
🎧 So a woman called Claire Varian-Ramos is doing some research on how this is affecting birds.
🎧 And rather than looking at how many birds are actually killed by mercury poisoning,
🎧 she's looking for more subtle sub-effects.
🎧 And these may be to do with the behaviour of the birds,
🎧 or with the effect of mercury on the way their brain works,
🎧 so whether it leads to problems with memory, for example.
🎧 And she's particularly focusing on the effects of mercury on bird song.
🎧 Now, the process of song learning happens at a particular stage in the birds' development,
🎧 and what you may not know
🎧 is that a young bird seems to acquire this skill by listening to the songs produced by its father,
🎧 rather than by any other bird.
🎧 And Varian-Ramos has already found in her research
🎧 that if young male birds are exposed to mercury,
🎧 if they eat food contaminated with mercury,
🎧 then the songs they produce aren't as complex as those produced by other birds.
🎧 So quite low-level exposure to mercury is likely to have an impact on male birds in a natural situation,
🎧 because it can mean that they're less attractive to female birds,
🎧 and so it can affect their chances of reproduction.
🎧 Now the way she's carrying out this research is worth thinking about.
🎧 She's using a mixture of studies using birds kept in laboratories,
🎧 and studies carried out outdoors in the wild.
🎧 The lab-based studies have the advantage that you don't get all the variables you would in a natural setting,
🎧 so the experimenter has a much higher level of control,
🎧 and that means they can be more confident about their results in some ways.
🎧 And of course they don't have to worry about going out and finding the birds in order to observe them.
🎧 So what are the implications here for humans?
🎧 Well, because many birds are migratory,
🎧 they may be transporting mercury far from contaminated sites.
🎧 For example, it's been found that ducks who'd been feeding at a contaminated site
🎧 were later shot by hunters over a thousand kilometres away,
🎧 and presumably eaten.
🎧 But these birds likely had mercury levels high enough to warrant concern for human consumption.
🎧 In addition, going back to song learning by birds,
🎧 we saw that this may be affected by mercury contamination.
🎧 Well, we also know that in humans,
🎧 mercury causes developmental delays in the acquisition of language,
🎧 and in fact this process is very similar in the brain regions it involves
🎧 and even the genes that are involved.
🎧 But mercury contamination has other important implications for humans as well.
🎧 It's now known that an unborn child can be affected
🎧 if the food eaten by its mother contains high levels of mercury,
🎧 and these effects can be quite substantial.
🎧 In the end, it comes down to whether more value is placed on human economic wellbeing or environmental wellbeing.
🎧 It's true there are new regulations for mercury emissions from power plants,
🎧 but these will need billions of dollars to implement,
🎧 and increase costs for everyone.
🎧 Some argue that's too much to pay to protect wildlife.
🎧 But as we've seen, the issues go beyond that,
🎧 and I think it's an issue we need to consider very carefully.
