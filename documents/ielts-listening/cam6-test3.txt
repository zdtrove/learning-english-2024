[057] Cam6 - Test 3 - Part 1

🎧 Good morning. I'd like to open a bank account, please.
🎧 Certainly.
🎧 If you'd like to take a seat, I'll just get some details from you.
🎧 It won't take long.
🎧 Thanks.
🎧 Is it a current account or a deposit account you wanted?
🎧 A current account.
🎧 Right.
🎧 I've got the application form here then.
🎧 We have different types - I see you've got our leaflet there.
🎧 I've decided on the one called 'Select.'
🎧 Right, that's fine, so, first of all, can I have your full name please?
🎧 Yes, it's Pieter Henes.
🎧 That's PIETER.
🎧 Is it HENNES?
🎧 Uh, only one N actually. It's a less common spelling of the name.
🎧 Oh, right. Okay.
🎧 And what's your date of birth please?
🎧 The 27th of the first, 1973.
🎧 Right.
🎧 And will this be a joint account?
🎧 No, just myself.
🎧 Okay, fine.
🎧 And where are you living, Mr Henes?
🎧 15, Riverside.
🎧 Is that all one word?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 Exeter?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 How long have you been at your present address?
🎧 Er, is it more than two years?
🎧 Ah, just two weeks actually.
🎧 I only arrived in the country a month ago.
🎧 I'm from Holland.
🎧 Oh, that's fine.
🎧 But we normally ask for a previous address in that case.
🎧 Oh yes, well, it's Rielsdorf 2.
🎧 That's RIELSDORF 2, Utrecht.
🎧 Holland.
🎧 Okay. Thank you.
🎧 Do you have a daytime telephone number?
🎧 Yes, I think the number at my office is 606295.
🎧 Um, just a minute, I'd better check.
🎧 Oh, no, sorry, 616. I'm not used to it yet.
🎧 Would you like my home number too?
🎧 Yes please.
🎧 It's 796431.
🎧 Are they both local numbers?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 ﻿Right. And your occupation?
🎧 Well, I'm in Britain as a project manager, but that's not my main job.
🎧 I'm an engineer by profession.
🎧 I see.
🎧 I think I'll put that then. It's shorter!
🎧 Now, we usually ask for a piece of information which we can use to check your identity, for security reasons.
🎧 You know, if you phone us.
🎧 Like, erm, my wife's first name?
🎧 Mother's might be better. It's less likely to be known.
🎧 Okay. Hers is Siti.
🎧 Siti?
🎧 Yes, SITI.
🎧 It's Indonesian.
🎧 Fine.
🎧 And how much would you like to open your account with?
🎧 We usually ask for a minimum sum of £50.
🎧 That's about €75.
🎧 Well, I'm going to transfer €2,000 from my Dutch account, just till I get paid.
🎧 In fact, I wanted to ask you about that.
🎧 What's the best way to do it?
🎧 It depends which bank you're with.
🎧 It's the Fransen Bank in Utrecht.
🎧 OK, fine. I'll check that in a minute.
🎧 If we have links with them we can do a direct transfer. But it's not a big problem either way.
🎧 Um, let's see.
🎧 How often would you like to receive statements?
🎧 I haven't really thought.
🎧 What's the usual thing?
🎧 It's up to you. Some people like them weekly.
🎧 Oh, no, that's too often.
🎧 Can I have them sent, um, once a month?
🎧 Yes, that's fine.
🎧 Is there anything else?
🎧 I was thinking of registering for your internet service at some stage.
🎧 Oh, yes.
🎧 Would you like me to send you information about that?
🎧 Please, yes.
🎧 And would you like to receive information about the bank's other services -
🎧 insurance, loans, anything like that?
🎧 Hmm, I don't think so, thanks.
🎧 That's okay then.
🎧 And one last thing, if you agree...

[058] Cam6 - Test 3 - Part 2

🎧 Welcome, everybody, to the lovely house and gardens of Rosewood,
🎧 once the home of the famous writer, Sebastian George.
🎧 He bought the house in 1902
🎧 although he had first seen it two years earlier.
🎧 At that time, the owners let it out to a tenant
🎧 because George was too slow making up his mind to buy it.
🎧 When it came back on the market, there was no hesitation
🎧 and he bought it immediately, for £9,300,
🎧 even though the house had no bathroom, no running water upstairs, and no electricity.
🎧 When he came here, he'd been married for ten years.
🎧 During that time, he'd become one of the most famous writers in the English-speaking world.
🎧 His professional success was enormous,
🎧 but his personal life wasn't as successful.
🎧 He was no longer on speaking terms with his brother
🎧 and had been devastated by the death at the age of seven of his elder daughter, Josephine.
🎧 Moving to Rosewood allowed the family to start a new life.
🎧 George regarded Rosewood as a pure example of a traditional country house of this part of England
🎧 and did some of his most successful writing here.
🎧 The house and its grounds became the family haven
🎧 and their escape to privacy and quiet.
🎧 The walls, and the mullioned windows were built of the local sandstone,
🎧 the tiles on the roofs and the bricks of the chimney stack were baked from local clay,
🎧 and the wooden structures inside came from oak trees which grow around here.
🎧 Now, please look at the map I've given you of the house and gardens.
🎧 We're here at the Information Centre.
🎧 Follow the path marked with the arrow
🎧 and the first area you come to is the orchard on your left.
🎧 As you go further down the path, there's the kitchen garden on the right
🎧 and as you go round the first sharp corner
🎧 you will find, to your left, an area where different types of pear tree have been planted
🎧 as well as some lovely flowers,
🎧 and this is known as Pear Alley - designed by George himself.
🎧 Next to this is the greenhouse
🎧 where some exotic plants and fruits are grown.
🎧 Follow the path round the second corner
🎧 and on your right you will see the entrance to the Mulberry Garden
🎧 with its 500-year-old tree.
🎧 Past the Mulberry Garden, follow the path until you reach the front of the house.
🎧 I suggest you spend a good hour wandering around this lovely building.
🎧 A guide takes visitor groups round every two hours.
🎧 If you would like to purchase any of George's books or other souvenirs,
🎧 then leave the house by the side entrance,
🎧 where you will find our shop, which is situated between the house and the garage
🎧 which contains the magnificent old Rolls-Royce car
🎧 which used to belong to George.
🎧 I expect by this time you may also be in need of a rest and some refreshment.
🎧 Most visitors are, so why don't you visit the tea room on the far side of the garage?
🎧 If you have time, there is a lovely walk down towards the River Dudwell.
🎧 For me, this is the best part of the estate.
🎧 This isn't on the map but it is all clearly signposted.
🎧 You cross the field which spreads along the banks of the river.
🎧 In spring, this area is well worth a visit.
🎧 Spend a minute or two watching the water pass by underneath as you cross the footbridge,
🎧 and then continue along the River Walk through the woodland.
🎧 On a hot summer's day the trees along this path provide welcome shade.
🎧 Eventually, you come to the water mill
🎧 which used to provide the electricity for the house -
🎧 only about four hours every evening - in George's time.
🎧 And, finally, for those of you who would like to see stunning views of the surrounding countryside
🎧 and who are a little bit more energetic,
🎧 when you return from the mill, take the first turning on your left
🎧 and climb up to the viewpoint.
🎧 You won't regret it.
🎧 Enjoy your visit!

🎧 Lucy, we really need to get working on this marketing assignment.
🎧 We've only got five weeks left to the end of term to design it,
🎧 carry it out, and then write up the results.
🎧 Sure. Well, let's get started right now.
🎧 Let's go over the instructions.
🎧 What exactly do we have to do?
🎧 Well, it says here we have to look at one area of the entertainment industry.
🎧 There's a list of the different types.
🎧 What are they?
🎧 Music, cinema, theatre, sport, and eating out.
🎧 Is that all?
🎧 Looks like it.
🎧 So we choose one branch of the industry
🎧 and then we look at how two different groups of people use it?
🎧 Is that right?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 And do we have to use any particular method to get our data?
🎧 Can we mail out a questionnaire, or do face-to-face interviews, or maybe even observations?
🎧 Well actually, it looks like we don't have a choice.
🎧 We have to do telephone interviews.
🎧 Okay, so at least we don't have to waste time deciding between the different methods.
🎧 Yeah, that's right.
🎧 Oh, and the other requirement is the number of interviewees.
🎧 Not too many, I hope. Ten? Twenty?
🎧 Well, we have to do two groups, remember,
🎧 and it looks like we have to interview fifteen for each group.
🎧 That's thirty altogether then.
🎧 It's going to take ages.
🎧 Yes, but remember we're working on this together,
🎧 so we'll only have to do fifteen each.
🎧 Okay, so those are all the requirements?
🎧 Yes, looks like it.
🎧 So, first, which area are we going to choose?
🎧 My preference would be cinema, since that's where I spend most of my money.
🎧 Hmm, I don't think that's such a good idea.
🎧 I don't think there are huge differences in the market there.
🎧 I mean, you get young and old, male and female, rich and poor...
🎧 all going to the same movies.
🎧 Yeah, maybe you're right.
🎧 Let's make it music then.
🎧 Right.
🎧 So, what two groups will we compare and contrast?
🎧 Male and female?
🎧 No.
🎧 Most of my female friends like the same music as me.
🎧 Different age groups would be much more likely to show up differences, I think.
🎧 Yeah, I suppose you're right again.
🎧 I'll take some notes, shall I?
🎧 So... Age Groups.
🎧 What do you think?
🎧 Maybe 25 or under for one group, and 45 or over for the other group?
🎧 That should show up differences.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Okay. Next.
🎧 How about the kind of music they like? Let's give them some choices and then we can just tick boxes.
🎧 Okay. Let's have pop, jazz, folk, easy listening...
🎧 What else?
🎧 Well, we should include classical.
🎧 Some people like it, you know.
🎧 Okay.
🎧 And then we should have how they listen to music.
🎧 The medium. Right. Let's include radio, CD...
🎧 and then I guess there's TV.
🎧 What about concerts? You know, in pubs and halls.
🎧 Oh yeah, we should include live music of course.
🎧 Okay, we're on a roll now!
🎧 Next point could be about where they actually get their music.
🎧 You mean like, do they buy it in music shops, or department stores?
🎧 Yes, or download it from the Internet.
🎧 Right. That could be for recorded music.
🎧 Then we need another section for live music.
🎧 Where do they go for that?
🎧 Okay. Let's say disco, pub, club, concert hall...
🎧 Or opera house!
🎧 And I guess we should include karaoke bars.
🎧 Not many of them in this city!
🎧 Okay. We'll leave that out then.
🎧 So, what's left to do?
🎧 That's it.
🎧 Well, now we can make a time-scale for doing it.

[060] Cam6 - Test 3 - Part 4

🎧 Good morning everyone.
🎧 Last week we were looking at the hunter-gatherers in Ireland,
🎧 across the Irish Sea from England.
🎧 Today, we're going to move on to the period between 4 and 6000 years ago,
🎧 known as the Neolithic period,
🎧 which is when a total farming economy was introduced in Ireland.
🎧 Now, there are several hypotheses about the origins of the first Neolithic settlers in Ireland,
🎧 but most of these contain problems.
🎧 For instance, there are considerable archaeological difficulties about the theory that they came from England.
🎧 The evidence doesn't really add up.
🎧 But there are even greater practical problems about the theory that they came directly from continental Europe.
🎧 For one thing, it's not clear just how sufficient numbers of men and women could have been transported to Ireland
🎧 to establish a viable population.
🎧 As you know, the hunter-gatherer economy which existed beforehand was based on small scattered groups.
🎧 The farming economy would almost certainly have required much larger communities
🎧 to do all the work needed to plant and tend sufficient crops to sustain them through the year.
🎧 The early farmers kept various animals, including cattle and sheep.
🎧 There's also evidence of pigs,
🎧 but it is possible that these could have been descended from the native wild species.
🎧 Now, we know from modern farming that if the level of breeding stock falls below about 300 females,
🎧 the future of the species locally is at risk.
🎧 So we must assume that from the beginnings of Neolithic farming,
🎧 the number of breeding sheep would have considerably exceeded 300,
🎧 and the national cattle herd must have been of a similar size.
🎧 The question is how these were brought to the area and where they came from.
🎧 It's usually suggested that the Neolithic settlers used skin-covered boats to transport livestock.
🎧 But this method would have severely restricted the range of the colonising fleets.
🎧 The sheer volume of animal transport necessary
🎧 means it's unlikely that this livestock could have been brought from anywhere further than England.
🎧 What about crops?
🎧 Well, two main cereal crops were introduced to Ireland during this time:
🎧 wheat and barley, both in several varieties.
🎧 The main evidence for their presence consists of impressions on pottery,
🎧 where a cereal grain accidentally became embedded in the surface of a pot before it was fired.
🎧 The grain itself was destroyed by the firing,
🎧 but it left an impression on the pot
🎧 which could be studied and identified by botanists.
🎧 Let's turn our attention now to the farming technology available at that time.
🎧 Before the cereal crops could be planted,
🎧 it would have been necessary to clear the forest and to break the ground by ploughing.
🎧 The stone blade of a plough has been discovered during excavation in County Mayo in western Ireland.
🎧 The body of the plough would have been of wood
🎧 and could have been drawn by people,
🎧 but it's also likely that cattle were used.
🎧 Now, the cultivation of crops and the husbandry of livestock brought about changes in people's lifestyle
🎧 such as the type of shelters they made.
🎧 For one thing, instead of moving from place to place
🎧 they needed permanent dwellings.
🎧 The stone axes used to chop down trees to make these dwellings
🎧 were far superior to any that the Stone Age hunter-gatherers used.
🎧 To make the axes, sources of suitable stone had to be found and systematically exploited.
🎧 These so-called 'axe factories' were really quarries rather than factories,
🎧 as the manufacture of the axes wasn't regularly performed on the quarry site.
🎧 However, after the axe had been chipped into shape,
🎧 they needed water and sand for grinding and polishing,
🎧 so a high mountainside wouldn't have been an appropriate place for this.
🎧 So this final stage of the manufacture must have been carried out close to water
🎧 and sure enough, there's ample evidence of this at coastal sites.
🎧 Now it's clear that these Neolithic axes were transported all over Ireland,
🎧 as well as to Scotland and the south of England.
🎧 It's not really surprising that axes from 'axe factories' in England have also been found in Ireland.
🎧 At the very least, this indicates that there was a link between the two islands during that period.
🎧 One of the most useful innovations of the colonisers was pottery making,
🎧 which was quite unknown to Irish hunter-gatherers.
🎧 The pottery was probably made by shaping clay into a ball with the hand,
🎧 and then hollowing it until the walls were the right thickness.
🎧 After firing, the outside was often polished.
🎧 This would have helped the pots to retain water, as they weren't glazed.
🎧 Now we know that the clay used usually came from local sources,
🎧 which suggests that manufacture was on a fairly small scale,
🎧 even though thousands of fragments are usually found at Neolithic sites.
🎧 In the course of time decoration began to appear.
🎧 At first this looked like a series of stitches and was just around the tops of the pots.
🎧 This could have been an imitation of earlier vessels which were made of leather sewn onto wood.
🎧 Then eventually pots with decoration...
