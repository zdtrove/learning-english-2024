🎧 Good morning. You're through to the tourist information office.
🎧 Tim speaking. How can I help you?
🎧 Oh hello.
🎧 Could you give me some information about next month's festival, please?
🎧 My family and I will be staying in the town that week.
🎧 Of course.
🎧 Well, it starts with a concert on the afternoon of the 17th.
🎧 Oh I heard about that.
🎧 The orchestra and singers come from the USA, don't they?
🎧 They're from Canada.
🎧 They're very popular over there.
🎧 They're going to perform a number of well-known pieces that will appeal to children as well as adults.
🎧 That sounds good.
🎧 My whole family are interested in music.
🎧 The next day, the 18th,
🎧 there's a performance by a ballet company called Eustatis.
🎧 Sorry?
🎧 The name is spelt E-U-S-T-A-T-I-S.
🎧 They appeared in last year's festival, and went down very well.
🎧 Again, their programme is designed for all ages.
🎧 Good.
🎧 I expect we'll go to that.
🎧 I hope there's going to be a play during the festival, a comedy, ideally.
🎧 You're in luck!
🎧 On the 19th and 20th a local amateur group are performing one written by a member of the group.
🎧 It's called Jemima.
🎧 That'll be on in the town hall.
🎧 They've already performed it two or three times.
🎧 I haven't seen it myself,
🎧 but the review in the local paper was very good.
🎧 And is it suitable for children?
🎧 Yes, in fact it's aimed more at children than at adults,
🎧 so both performances are in the afternoon.
🎧 And what about dance?
🎧 Will there be any performances?
🎧 Yes, also on the 20th, but in the evening.
🎧 A professional company is putting on a show of modern pieces,
🎧 with electronic music by young composers.
🎧 Uh-huh.
🎧 The show is about how people communicate, or fail to communicate, with each other,
🎧 so it's got the rather strange name, Chat.
🎧 I suppose that's because that's something we do both face to face and online.
🎧 That's right.
🎧 Now there are also some workshops and other activities.
🎧 They'll all take place at least once every day,
🎧 so everyone who wants to take part will have a chance.
🎧 Good.
🎧 We're particularly interested in cookery -
🎧 you don't happen to have a cookery workshop, do you?
🎧 We certainly do.
🎧 It's going to focus on how to make food part of a healthy lifestyle,
🎧 and it'll show that even sweet things like cakes can contain much less sugar than they usually do.
🎧 That might be worth going to.
🎧 We're trying to encourage our children to cook.
🎧 Another workshop is just for children,
🎧 and that's on creating posters to reflect the history of the town.
🎧 The aim is to make children aware of how both the town and people's lives have changed over the centuries.
🎧 The results will be exhibited in the community centre.
🎧 Then the other workshop is in toy-making,
🎧 and that's for adults only.
🎧 Oh, why's that?
🎧 Because it involves carpentry -
🎧 participants will be making toys out of wood,
🎧 so there'll be a lot of sharp chisels and other tools around.
🎧 It makes sense to keep children away from it.
🎧 Exactly.
🎧 Now let me tell you about some of the outdoor activities.
🎧 There'll be supervised wild swimming…
🎧 Wild swimming?
🎧 What's that?
🎧 It just means swimming in natural waters, rather than a swimming pool.
🎧 Oh OK.
🎧 In a lake, for instance.
🎧 Yes, there's a beautiful one just outside the town,
🎧 and that'll be the venue for the swimming.
🎧 There'll be lifeguards on duty, so it's suitable for all ages.
🎧 And finally, there'll be a walk in some nearby woods every day.
🎧 The leader is an expert on insects.
🎧 He'll show some that live in the woods, and how important they are for the environment.
🎧 So there are going to be all sorts of different things to do during the festival.
🎧 There certainly are.
🎧 If you'd like to read about how the preparations for the festival are going,
🎧 the festival organizer is keeping a blog.
🎧 Just search online for the festival website, and you'll find it.
🎧 Well, thank you very much for all the information.
🎧 You're welcome.
🎧 Goodbye.
🎧 Goodbye.
🎧 
🎧 I'm very pleased to welcome this evening's guest speaker, Mark Logan,
🎧 who's going to tell us about the recent transformation of Minster Park.
🎧 Over to you, Mark.
🎧 Thank you.
🎧 I'm sure you're all familiar with Minster Park.
🎧 It's been a feature of the city for well over a century,
🎧 and has been the responsibility of the city council for most of that time.
🎧 What perhaps isn't so well known is the origin of the park:
🎧 unlike many public parks that started in private ownership,
🎧 as the garden of a large house, for instance,
🎧 Minster was some waste land,
🎧 which people living nearby started planting with flowers in 1892.
🎧 It was unclear who actually owned the land,
🎧 and this wasn't settled until 20 years later,
🎧 when the council took possession of it.
🎧 You may have noticed the statue near one of the entrances.
🎧 It's of Diane Gosforth,
🎧 who played a key role in the history of the park.
🎧 Once the council had become the legal owner,
🎧 it planned to sell the land for housing.
🎧 Many local people wanted it to remain a place that everyone could go to,
🎧 to enjoy the fresh air and natural environment -
🎧 remember, the park is in a densely populated residential area.
🎧 Diane Gosforth was one of those people,
🎧 and she organised petitions and demonstrations,
🎧 which eventually made the council change its mind about the future of the land.
🎧 Soon after this the First World War broke out, in 1914,
🎧 and most of the park was dug up and planted with vegetables,
🎧 which were sold locally.
🎧 At one stage, the army considered taking it over for troop exercises
🎧 and got as far as contacting the city council,
🎧 then decided the park was too small to be of use.
🎧 There were occasional public meetings during the war,
🎧 in an area that had been retained as grass.
🎧 After the war, the park was turned back more or less to how it had been before 1914,
🎧 and continued almost unchanged until recently.
🎧 Plans for transforming it were drawn up at various times,
🎧 most recently in 2013,
🎧 though they were revised in 2015,
🎧 before any work had started.
🎧 The changes finally got going in 2016,
🎧 and were finished on schedule last year.
🎧 OK, let me tell you about some of the changes that have been made
🎧 and some things that have been retained.
🎧 If you look at this map,
🎧 you'll see the familiar outline of the park,
🎧 with the river forming the northern boundary,
🎧 and a gate in each of the other three walls.
🎧 The statue of Diane Gosforth has been moved:
🎧 it used to be close to the south gate,
🎧 but it's now immediately to the north of the lily pond,
🎧 almost in the centre of the park, which makes it much more visible.
🎧 There's a new area of wooden sculptures, which are on the river bank,
🎧 where the path from the east gate makes a sharp bend.
🎧 There are two areas that are particularly intended for children.
🎧 The playground has been enlarged and improved,
🎧 and that's between the river and the path that leads from the pond to the river.
🎧 Then there's a new maze, a circular series of paths, separated by low hedges.
🎧 That's near the west gate -
🎧 you go north from there towards the river and then turn left to reach it.
🎧 There have been tennis courts in the park for many years,
🎧 and they've been doubled, from four to eight.
🎧 They're still in the south-west corner of the park,
🎧 where there's a right-angle bend in the path.
🎧 Something else I'd like to mention is the new fitness area.
🎧 This is right next to the lily pond on the same side as the west gate.
🎧 Now, as you're all gardeners,
🎧 I'm sure you'll like to hear about the plants that have been chosen for the park.
🎧 
🎧 OK, Graham, so let's check we both know what we're supposed to be doing.
🎧 OK.
🎧 So, for the university's open day,
🎧 we have to plan a display on British life and literature in the mid-19th century.
🎧 That's right.
🎧 But we'll have some people to help us find the materials and set it up, remember.
🎧 For the moment, we just need to plan it.
🎧 Good.
🎧 So have you gathered who's expected to come and see the display?
🎧 Is it for the people studying English, or students from other departments?
🎧 I'm not clear about it.
🎧 Nor me.
🎧 That was how it used to be,
🎧 but it didn't attract many people, so this year it's going to be part of an open day,
🎧 to raise the university's profile.
🎧 It'll be publicised in the city, to encourage people to come and find out something of what goes on here.
🎧 And it's included in the information that's sent to people who are considering applying to study here next year.
🎧 Presumably some current students and lecturers will come?
🎧 I would imagine so,
🎧 but we've been told to concentrate on the other categories of people.
🎧 Right.
🎧 We don't have to cover the whole range of 19th-century literature, do we?
🎧 No, it's entirely up to us.
🎧 I suggest just using Charles Dickens.
🎧 That's a good idea.
🎧 Most people have heard of him, and have probably read some of his novels,
🎧 or seen films based on them,
🎧 so that's a good lead-in to life in his time.
🎧 Exactly.
🎧 And his novels show the awful conditions that most people had to live in, don't they:
🎧 he wanted to shock people into doing something about it.
🎧 Did he do any campaigning, other than writing?
🎧 Yes, he campaigned for education and other social reforms, and gave talks,
🎧 but I'm inclined to ignore that and focus on the novels.
🎧 Yes, I agree.
🎧 OK, so now shall we think about a topic linked to each novel?
🎧 Yes. I've printed out a list of Dickens's novels in the order they were published,
🎧 in the hope you'd agree to focus on him!
🎧 You're lucky I did agree!
🎧 Let's have a look.
🎧 OK, the first was The Pickwick Papers, published in 1836.
🎧 It was very successful when it came out, wasn't it,
🎧 and was adapted for the theatre straight away.
🎧 There's an interesting point, though,
🎧 that there's a character who keeps falling asleep,
🎧 and that medical condition was named after the book - Pickwickian Syndrome.
🎧 So why don't we use that as the topic,
🎧 and include some quotations from the novel?
🎧 Right, Next is Oliver Twist.
🎧 There's a lot in the novel about poverty.
🎧 But maybe something less obvious…
🎧 Well Oliver is taught how to steal, isn't he?
🎧 We could use that to illustrate the fact that very few children went to school,
🎧 particularly not poor children, so they learnt in other ways.
🎧 Good idea.
🎧 What's next?
🎧 Maybe Nicholas Nickleby.
🎧 Actually he taught in a really cruel school, didn't he?
🎧 That's right.
🎧 But there's also the company of touring actors that Nicholas joins.
🎧 We could do something on theatres and other amusements of the time.
🎧 We don't want only the bad things, do we?
🎧 OK.
🎧 What about Martin Chuzzlewit?
🎧 He goes to the USA, doesn't he?
🎧 Yes, and Dickens himself had been there a year before,
🎧 and drew on his experience there in the novel.
🎧 I wonder, though…
🎧 The main theme is selfishness,
🎧 so we could do something on social justice?
🎧 Hmm... No, too general, let's keep to your idea.
🎧 I think it would work well.
🎧 He wrote Bleak House next - that's my favourite of his novels.
🎧 It's mine too.
🎧 His satire of the legal system is pretty powerful.
🎧 That's true, but think about Esther, the heroine.
🎧 As a child she lives with someone she doesn't know is her aunt,
🎧 who treats her very badly.
🎧 Then she's very happy living with her guardian,
🎧 and he puts her in charge of the household.
🎧 And at the end she gets married and her guardian gives her and her husband a house,
🎧 where of course they're very happy.
🎧 Yes, I like that.
🎧 What shall we take next?
🎧 Little Dorrit?
🎧 Old Mr Dorrit has been in a debtors' prison for years…
🎧 So was Dickens's father, wasn't he?
🎧 That's right.
🎧 What about focusing on the part when Mr Dorrit inherits a fortune,
🎧 and he starts pretending he's always been rich?
🎧 Good idea.
🎧 So, next, we need to think about what materials we want to illustrate each issue.
🎧 That's going to be quite hard.
🎧 
🎧 I'm going to report on a case study of a programme
🎧 which has been set up to help rural populations in Mozambique,
🎧 a largely agricultural country in South-East Africa.
🎧 The programme worked with three communities in Chicualacuala district,
🎧 near the Limpopo River.
🎧 This is a dry and arid region, with unpredictable rainfall.
🎧 Because of this, people in the area were unable to support themselves through agriculture
🎧 and instead they used the forest as a means of providing themselves with an income,
🎧 mainly by selling charcoal.
🎧 However, this was not a sustainable way of living in the long term,
🎧 as they were rapidly using up this resource.
🎧 To support agriculture in this dry region,
🎧 the programme focused primarily on making use of existing water resources from the Limpopo River
🎧 by setting up systems of irrigation,
🎧 which would provide a dependable water supply for crops and animals.
🎧 The programme worked closely with the district government in order to find the best way of implementing this.
🎧 The region already had one farmers' association,
🎧 and it was decided to set up two more of these.
🎧 These associations planned and carried out activities including water management,
🎧 livestock breeding and agriculture,
🎧 and it was notable that in general, women formed the majority of the workforce.
🎧 It was decided that in order to keep the crops safe from animals, both wild and domestic,
🎧 special areas should be fenced off where the crops could be grown.
🎧 The community was responsible for creating these fences,
🎧 but the programme provided the necessary wire for making them.
🎧 Once the area had been fenced off, it could be cultivated.
🎧 The land was dug, so that vegetables and cereals appropriate to the climate could be grown,
🎧 and the programme provided the necessary seeds for this.
🎧 The programme also provided pumps so that water could be brought from the river in pipes to the fields.
🎧 However, the labour was all provided by local people,
🎧 and they also provided and put up the posts that supported the fences around the fields.
🎧 Once the programme had been set up,
🎧 its development was monitored carefully.
🎧 The farmers were able to grow enough produce
🎧 not just for their own needs, but also to sell.
🎧 However, getting the produce to places where it could be marketed was sometimes a problem,
🎧 as the farmers did not have access to transport,
🎧 and this resulted in large amounts of produce,
🎧 especially vegetables, being spoiled.
🎧 This problem was discussed with the farmers' associations
🎧 and it was decided that in order to prevent food from being spoiled,
🎧 the farmers needed to learn techniques for its preservation.
🎧 There was also an additional initiative that had not been originally planned,
🎧 but which became a central feature of the programme.
🎧 This was when farmers started to dig holes for tanks in the fenced-off areas
🎧 and to fill these with water and use them for breeding fish -
🎧 an important source of protein.
🎧 After a time, another suggestion was made by local people
🎧 which hadn't been part of the programme's original proposal,
🎧 but which was also adopted later on.
🎧 They decided to try setting up colonies of bees,
🎧 which would provide honey both for their own consumption and to sell.
🎧 So what lessons can be learned from this programme?
🎧 First of all, it tells us that in dry, arid regions,
🎧 if there is access to a reliable source of water,
🎧 there is great potential for the development of agriculture.
🎧 In Chicualacuala, there was a marked improvement in agricultural production,
🎧 which improved food security
🎧 and benefited local people by providing them with both food and income.
🎧 However, it's important to set realistic timelines for each phase of the programme,
🎧 especially for its design,
🎧 as mistakes made at this stage may be hard to correct later on.
🎧 The programme demonstrates that sustainable development is possible in areas where…
