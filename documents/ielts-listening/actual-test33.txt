🎧 Good afternoon and welcome to Habitat Hunters.
🎧 You must be Joseph?
🎧 Yes, that's right. You said on the phone that I could come by at 2 o'clock.
🎧 Sorry, I'm a little early.
🎧 No, no problem at all.
🎧 In Calgary's market, you have to move fast if you want a good apartment!
🎧 Actually, I'd settle for almost anything.
🎧 I've been here ten days and the hotel is ruining me.
🎧 My father has me on a strict budget.
🎧 Sit right down here now, sir.
🎧 Let's talk a little about the places before we go have a look.
🎧 Now, we have 4 apartments available.
🎧 OK, could you tell me more about those 4 apartments?
🎧 Sure. The first one is on Beatle Road, just a block off campus.
🎧 It's a 3-bedroom with a bathroom and a living room and a great Italian restaurant right next to it.
🎧 How much?
🎧 Well, it's $435 a month, including Internet and utilities.
🎧 Okay, that sounds reasonable.
🎧 Any drawbacks to the house?
🎧 There's a really big garden, but it hasn't been taken care of over the years and
🎧 is just too big to clean up nicely.
🎧 Hmm. That sounds okay.
🎧 Tell me about the next option.
🎧 The other 3-bedroom apartment is on Oakington Avenue on campus.
🎧 It is right near the building where you have classes,
🎧 and the kitchen and living room are newly furnished.
🎧 Wow, that sounds like a pretty good option.
🎧 Well, it is a cool apartment,
🎧 but since it's a dormitory, the living room, bathroom, kitchen, and washing machine are all shared.
🎧 It would be nice not to have to buy living room furniture, though.
🎧 And how much is this one?
🎧 $400 per month for a bedroom with an air conditioner.
🎧 For a bedroom without an air conditioner, you would pay less,
🎧 $340 for it.
🎧 Yikes, even with the air conditioner, it sounds really inconvenient to have to share facilities.
🎧 I'll never cook if I have to walk down the hall to use the kitchen.
🎧 Yeah, that's true.
🎧 Anyway, the next place is a 2-bedroom on Mead Street.
🎧 Oh, I like Mead Street - that's off campus, right?
🎧 Yep. It's pretty cool, but it only has 2 bedrooms, plus a living room and a study.
🎧 But I want to live together with my 2 friends.
🎧 So you could make the study into a small bedroom if you end up living with them.
🎧 Also, we guys want a TV and DVD player since we're all so much into movies.
🎧 Well, this place has a great TV and VCR, but no DVD player.
🎧 No DVD? That's so weird.
🎧 Are any other facilities provided?
🎧 As you said, weird enough, it also comes with a washbasin.
🎧 Is there a washing machine?
🎧 I think we need that more than just a washbasin.
🎧 I'm afraid there's no washing machine in the apartment.
🎧 Wow, that's so old-fashioned!
🎧 Maybe it's not the best choice for 3 college guys.
🎧 How much is it?
🎧 Well, it's $600 per month,
🎧 but of course it would be cheaper if you made it into 3 bedrooms instead of 2.
🎧 Where is the apartment located?
🎧 It's 2500 Mead Street, where there are a lot of bars.
🎧 It would be affordable, but it would get pretty noisy.
🎧 And that sounds really expensive for an old place in a noisy area.
🎧 How about the last place?
🎧 This one's on-campus in the Devon Close complex.
🎧 It's a one-bedroom so it will be a little quieter than the Mead Street place.
🎧 One bedroom huh? That could be good for focusing on my studies.
🎧 What else does it have?
🎧 It comes with a living room and a study,
🎧 and includes a really nice lamp in the study that has a bunch of different settings.
🎧 You know what else is cool?
🎧 There's a dining hall downstairs so all evening meals are free.
🎧 You can purchase breakfast and lunch, but meals after 6 p.m. are free.
🎧 Wow, this place sounds too good to be true.
🎧 Is it really expensive?
🎧 It's alright - $500 per month, but there's no bathroom.
🎧 What? No bathroom?
🎧 Well, there's no bathroom in the apartment, but there's one at the end of the hall.
🎧 Hmm. Thanks, I think now I just have to decide whether I want to live alone or not.
🎧 Yeah, which one do you prefer?
🎧 I think I'd choose either this apartment or the one on Beatle Road.
🎧 OK. You'd better think about it, and then you can contact me ASAP
🎧 Fine, thanks for your help!
🎧 
🎧 Hi folks, my name is Loretta Johnston,
🎧 and I'm here from the Baltimore Department of Public Waste.
🎧 Thank you for coming out to our community meeting tonight.
🎧 I've got a few words to say about the waste collection here in Baltimore.
🎧 First, there's the sorted collection bins themselves.
🎧 They're made of sturdy, solid material,
🎧 so none of your trash can seep out or puncture the bin.
🎧 Also, since these things sit out on the curb overnight rain or shine,
🎧 they have to be waterproof.
🎧 We can't have water getting up in it and filling up the bin.
🎧 Remember to pay attention to which bin is which,
🎧 and sort your waste accordingly.
🎧 You should have a blue or green bin for recyclable garbage,
🎧 a yellow bin for unrecyclable garbage,
🎧 and a red bin for toxic waste.
🎧 Our citywide waste management is divided into 2 services.
🎧 The first is commercial waste collection, or trash collection from buildings.
🎧 The majority of building waste is paper, which goes in the blue or green bins.
🎧 You'll notice in your office buildings there are signs that warn you not to overfill these bins.
🎧 All that paper adds up,
🎧 and an overflowing bin is infinitely harder for collectors to carry to the truck and empty.
🎧 Aside from paper, another large source of building waste is metals.
🎧 Metals such as tin and aluminium can be put in the yellow recycle bins,
🎧 but metals like lead and copper should be disposed of in the red bins.
🎧 These heavy metals are harmful to the environment
🎧 and exacerbate our city's existing pollution problem.
🎧 That's about all the information you need for building waste.
🎧 Moving on to the second service,
🎧 household waste collection is probably what you primarily think of when you think of what we do here...
🎧 Many of the same guidelines apply - the sorting is the same, et cetera.
🎧 Please remember to keep garbage like kitchen waste in a plastic bag.
🎧 It makes collection easier and lessens the abominable rotten-trash smell.
🎧 So after we take your trash away, what happens to it?
🎧 We take all the garbage to one of a number of garbage disposal plants,
🎧 each of which is located in the middle of an open space of some sort.
🎧 No one wants to have their home or office right next door to a waste disposal plant, right?
🎧 Waste is collected and then disposed of once every four weeks.
🎧 A lot of trash can build up in that time,
🎧 so we're in the process of developing a plan to fund collection more frequently.
🎧 Ideally it would be collected weekly,
🎧 but we will likely have to settle for biweekly.
🎧 The garbage trucks make their rounds to clear the bins at night in order to avoid traffic.
🎧 I'm sure you've seen how much waste your own household produces in a given week.
🎧 Now imagine all the trash produced by all the households in Baltimore.
🎧 It's a lot, right?
🎧 It may surprise you that this amount is only marginal compared to commercial waste.
🎧 Yep, the main waste producers are actually businesses, industrial facilities, retail, and offices.
🎧 Hard to believe humans produce that much waste, right?
🎧 No wonder we have pollution problems!
🎧 Anyway, after all incoming waste is sorted,
🎧 recyclables are sent to a recycling plant,
🎧 while garbage and toxic waste are transported to their respective areas of the plant for treatment.
🎧 Items such as stones, which should not be disposed of in our bins,
🎧 are separated out and discarded.
🎧 Once the trash has undergone the treatment process,
🎧 it is compacted and disposed of with all the other trash
🎧 and finally, when the landfill space is full,
🎧 it is buried deep underground and in time something new is built on the land.
🎧 That's everything about waste collection.
🎧 Thank you for listening.
🎧 Are there any questions?
🎧 
🎧 Hi, Julie, it's Ricky.
🎧 Hi, Ricky, how are you?
🎧 I noticed you weren't in Psychology today.
🎧 I'm feeling sick, so I didn't go to school today.
🎧 Would you mind telling me what I missed in class?
🎧 Sure thing. I'm sorry you're not feeling well!
🎧 Anyway, we spent most of the class talking about a new essay that Professor Johnson assigned.
🎧 You need to choose one of the bold headings from the note system and research it.
🎧 Wow, I picked the wrong day to miss class, huh?
🎧 You sure did.
🎧 Could you tell me the specific requirements of this paper?
🎧 Sure.
🎧 You need to find scientific research that supports your claim as one of your references.
🎧 It can be from some of the case studies we discussed in class, or you can find your own.
🎧 Or even better, you can conduct your own research!
🎧 I'm sure that would get you an A.
🎧 Have you decided what you're going to do yet?
🎧 Also, where are you getting your references?
🎧 Yeah, I'm gonna research facial recognition by infants.
🎧 I've already found a few experiments in scientific journals.
🎧 That would probably be a good start for you - there are tons of journals in the library.
🎧 Great idea, thanks.
🎧 I'm considering writing my essay on the effects of one of the psychotropic drugs we talked about in class.
🎧 I'm sure there is lots of stuff about it on the Internet.
🎧 Are we allowed to use information from the Internet?
🎧 Sure, you can use that as long as it's not your main source for information.
🎧 You'll probably want to cite some of the experiments we went over.
🎧 Good idea, thanks.
🎧 I'm gonna try to find some information from a bunch of different sources.
🎧 Are there any specifications on how the essay should be written?
🎧 Yeah, Professor Johnson wants it double-spaced.
🎧 It should be between 6 to 10 pages long.
🎧 6 to 10 pages? That's so much!
🎧 Ah, it's gonna take forever.
🎧 I know. The whole class groaned when he said that.
🎧 Anyway, you also need to put the title in italics...
🎧 Wait, each section heading, or just the main heading?
🎧 Only the main heading should be in italics.
🎧 I think section titles are supposed to be in the same format, but maybe in bold.
🎧 You'll have to check that in class next time.
🎧 Oh okay.
🎧 So I take it that the report has to be typed since there are so many requirements.
🎧 What are the other formatting requirements?
🎧 Yep, it's got to be typed.
🎧 Aside from that, there are still a few more specifications.
🎧 You should number each page.
🎧 Make sure it goes up in the top right corner.
🎧 Okay, I'll make sure to write that down.
🎧 I always forget to number the pages.
🎧 Do we need to title and date each page, too?
🎧 You need the shortened title on every page, but no need to include the date.
🎧 That should just be on the cover page.
🎧 Okay, thanks.
🎧 No problem.
🎧 Also, make sure the margins are 3.25 pixels wide.
🎧 What?
🎧 I'm not even sure how to do that.
🎧 Oh, it's okay, I can show you. It's really easy.
🎧 I think that's all the directions he gave us.
🎧 A lot of formatting requirements,
🎧 but we have the freedom to research many things that we like, so that's good.
🎧 Oh, I almost forgot,
🎧 remember to put down your ID number on your report.
🎧 Thanks so much for your help.
🎧 I'll see you in class Monday!
🎧 No problem, glad I could help. See you later.
🎧 
🎧 Good morning and welcome to yet another lecture in Environmental Science.
🎧 I don't think I'm telling you a secret when I mention that water is a big worry here in Australia.
🎧 The stuff is scarce.
🎧 Perhaps that's why we drink so much beer, eh?
🎧 Seriously, though, a safe and reliable source of water is one of the great concerns of people everywhere.
🎧 Moreover, as the world population grows,
🎧 the pressure on existing water supplies grows greater and greater.
🎧 Think about it.
🎧 Our economic system demands that there be more and more consumers.
🎧 The growing number of people has been tied to climate change, including droughts.
🎧 So more people means less water.
🎧 But our economic system demands a high birth rate.
🎧 Forget about oil. Soon enough you will see wars for water.
🎧 Mark my words.
🎧 But today, I'm going to confine my remarks to Australia.
🎧 As noted already, here down under, the water supply is extremely scarce.
🎧 The only drier continent is Antarctica
🎧 and remember, no one really lives there anyway.
🎧 Moreover, in recent years, the wind patterns have changed.
🎧 Rain that used to fall on the country now falls out to sea hundreds of miles to the south.
🎧 Now, when I speak of people needing water, most of you probably think of drinking.
🎧 Certainly everyone needs water for drinking.
🎧 But surprising as it may sound,
🎧 drinking is not anywhere near being the main use for water.
🎧 Most water is actually used for washing.
🎧 When you take a shower, you probably use well over a hundred litres of water.
🎧 Every time you flush your toilet, that's about 8 litres.
🎧 But most people drink no more than two litres or so per day.
🎧 So, where to get water?
🎧 It could be obtained from rainwater,
🎧 but often rainfall consists of other harmful pollutants that evaporated with the water.
🎧 In fact, acid rain, an intense example of this,
🎧 causes harmful effects on the wildlife of the habitat on which it falls.
🎧 Water from underground could also be used,
🎧 though it is more difficult to contain
🎧 and often must go through an extensive cleansing process.
🎧 The purest water is found in rivers, creeks, lakes, and dams.
🎧 And, sad to say, Australia has precious few of these.
🎧 Really, how many of your home towns have rivers?
🎧 Year-round rivers, I mean.
🎧 The soil tends to be sandy, so water soaks into the ground.
🎧 Many places are rocky too,
🎧 so 87% of the rainfall is lost to evaporation.
🎧 That's almost twice the evaporation rate in my native Canada!
🎧 Speaking of rain, we already heard how rainfall is diminishing here in Oceania.
🎧 The quantity itself isn't the only problem, either.
🎧 Going back to the problems with obtaining rainwater,
🎧 a further problem is that rain is a useful source of water only if air pollution is fairly mild.
🎧 Again, you're in a situation where you can't win.
🎧 You need water where most people live.
🎧 People tend to build cities where rainfall is adequate.
🎧 But then modern cities tend to feature polluted air
🎧 which renders the rain far less easily usable.
🎧 OK, let's take a look at the table here,
🎧 you'll see it showing the relative pollution of rainfall in the world's cities.
🎧 The more people, the dirtier the rain.
🎧 This is becoming a huge concern for people in the West,
🎧 who want their water to be pure and safe.
🎧 Though reliable drinking water is important everywhere,
🎧 the concern in the West is reflected in all the government regulations and political campaigns aimed at solving this problem.
🎧 In contrast, there are not as many demands made on the governments in Asian and African cultures to improve the water,
🎧 as their focus is on other issues.
🎧 Now, whatever the source of water,
🎧 we can never afford to forget that all water is highly vulnerable to contamination.
🎧 Whether we're getting it from the ground, from bodies of water, or rainfall,
🎧 it is susceptible to a variety of toxins.
🎧 In fact, that's why we clean it before using it:
🎧 water carries with it filth and dirt.
🎧 This problem shows up in a number of different ways.
🎧 As humans and all other animals need water to survive,
🎧 it's no surprise to us that one of the most important domestic uses of water is for drinking.
🎧 Yet if you have old-fashioned lead pipes,
🎧 you may slowly be poisoning yourself by drinking that nice clear water.
🎧 The industrial pollution, farm chemicals, and leaky landfills
🎧 are well-known sources of contaminants as well.
🎧 So what is being done to ensure we Australians a safe and steady supply of drinking water?
🎧 There are a lot of initiatives that make admirable efforts to remedy this issue.
🎧 We'll be talking about this when we meet again on Thursday.
🎧 But, as a preview,
🎧 I can tell you that so far the amount of real solutions that have been produced is not nearly adequate.
🎧 Traditionally, we've been very free in this country.
🎧 That means that every person and every province tend to go its own way.
🎧 So the mechanisms for water management are, in a word, insufficient.
🎧 To begin seeing how this is so, I want you to read something before our next class.
🎧 Though a lot of previous data on water usage and water management are inconclusive
🎧 and have thus caused quite a concern,
🎧 we can learn a lot from the contents of reports written on the subject.
🎧 The basis for the government's water policy is the 1989 White Paper
🎧 reporting on "Water Use: Present and Future".
🎧 If you compare the numbers offered in the paper with those in the text,
🎧 you'll find that the report is rather untrustworthy.
🎧 Truth being told, I'm being too kind when I say that!
