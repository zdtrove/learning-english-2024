🎧 Good morning. I've been looking at your holidays to Australia in your brochure.
🎧 I'm thinking of going during the second half of next month.
🎧 Good morning. As you can see from our brochure,
🎧 we offer a wide variety of packages to various destinations in Australia.
🎧 Is there anything in particular that interests you?
🎧 Yes, my husband and I are very interested in the holidays in the Outback.
🎧 These holidays are becoming increasingly popular.
🎧 Would you like to arrange flights and accommodation with us, or just accommodation?
🎧 Can you arrange flights from Sydney?
🎧 Certainly.
🎧 OK, flights and accommodation then.
🎧 Right. You said that you wanted to travel next month.
🎧 Which date would you prefer?
🎧 I should point out that there are no daily flights available,
🎧 so if you have a flexible itinerary, that's better.
🎧 Well, we arrive in Sydney on the 15th of April
🎧 and we were thinking of travelling to the Outback on the 18th of August, er... I mean April.
🎧 OK. There's only one flight from Sydney to Alice Springs on the 18th, so I'll book you on that.
🎧 It leaves at 10 in the morning, which is quite convenient.
🎧 Shall I book two seats for you?
🎧 Yes, please.
🎧 As for your stay in the Outback,
🎧 you can see from the brochure that we offer three packages:
🎧 budget, standard, and luxury.
🎧 The budget package is about 500 Australian dollars.
🎧 The standard package is about 700 and the luxury one is approximately 1,000,
🎧 though it does depend on exactly what you would like regarding extras.
🎧 Which one would you prefer?
🎧 Well, we can't decide between the budget and standard options.
🎧 Ah, well, actually, just looking at my computer here,
🎧 on the date that you want to fly into Alice Springs,
🎧 there is no standard accommodation available. It's fully booked, I'm afraid.
🎧 That's OK.
🎧 We think that the cheapest one should be fine for us.
🎧 We don't mind roughing it for a few days and we don't expect to be spending much time at our accommodations.
🎧 We prefer the outdoors.
🎧 Right. Let's look at the room options.
🎧 First of all, would you prefer a non-smoking room?
🎧 Yes. Neither of us smokes.
🎧 OK.
🎧 Oh, before I forget,
🎧 could you book everything in my husband's name, please?
🎧 Yes, of course. Are you paying by credit card?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 In that case, I'll need your husband's name exactly as it appears on the card.
🎧 Of course. It's John A. Smyth.
🎧 That's Smyth with a "Y".
🎧 John... middle initial "A"...
🎧 surname Smyth, S-M-Y-T-H.
🎧 Is that correct?
🎧 Correct.
🎧 Thank you. I'll just check the price.
🎧 The room will cost $100 a night plus $10 tax,
🎧 so $110 per night in total.
🎧 Is that OK?
🎧 Yes, that's fine. Book us for three nights, please.
🎧 Most of the guests like to participate in some special activities and trips while they're staying in the Outback.
🎧 Is there anything that interests you and your husband?
🎧 Yes, there are several things we'd like to see and do.
🎧 We'd definitely like to visit the Cultural Centre.
🎧 Yes, that's very popular.
🎧 It's within walking distance of the accommodation and it's free.
🎧 It's also a great place to pick up souvenirs of your trip.
🎧 We were thinking about visiting one of the nearby farms.
🎧 There are two farms nearby - a sheep farm and a kangaroo farm.
🎧 There is also an opportunity to ride camels in the desert.
🎧 Have you ridden a camel before?
🎧 No, but it sounds like fun.
🎧 Could you give me some more details about the kangaroo farm and the camel ride?
🎧 Certainly.
🎧 The kangaroo farm includes information on how the animals are raised
🎧 whilst the camel ride provides information on desert flora and fauna.
🎧 Which would you prefer?
🎧 You can arrange to see the kangaroos in the wild if you like, rather than on a farm.
🎧 That sounds perfect.
🎧 OK, we'll go on the camel ride and see the kangaroos in their natural habitat.
🎧 OK. I'll arrange that for you.
🎧 I forgot to mention that the journey also includes a stop at a place of aboriginal artwork.
🎧 It's a place well-known for its stone carvings of animals and mythical creatures.
🎧 That sounds great!
🎧 Are the carvings in the desert?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 Wonderful!
🎧 Well, that's perfect then. I'm sure you'll have a lovely trip,
🎧 but remember that you need to take care in the sun.
🎧 Yes. We're really looking forward to our trip.
🎧 We really want to try to experience the Dreamtime under the stars.
🎧 Of course. That's what a trip to the Outback is really all about.
🎧 Yes.
🎧 Now, how about the cost...
🎧 
🎧 Continuing our broadcast of public service announcements,
🎧 Worldwide Helpers announces upcoming vacancies for a number of volunteer worker positions.
🎧 All applicants must meet the following requirements.
🎧 First of all, applicants must be over 18 years of age.
🎧 The company apologises, but there can be no exceptions to this rule.
🎧 Second, persons interested in these positions may not have police records.
🎧 Minor traffic offences like a parking ticket are, of course, no problem.
🎧 But, and I quote, "past and present drug users and sex offenders" need not apply.
🎧 The employer will, of course, check with the police to verify your clean record.
🎧 In addition, applicants must supply references from past or present employers or teachers along with their recent CV.
🎧 These references must testify as to the applicant's work habits and/or character.
🎧 Remember, these are references from employers or teachers.
🎧 A note from your dear old Mum won't do.
🎧 Worldwide Helpers assures me that they will contact these references to confirm they are genuine.
🎧 Although all positions are volunteer, the employer will reimburse some of your expenses.
🎧 For example, they will pay for transportation to and from the job site.
🎧 Aside from that, the cost of phone calls is covered.
🎧 As for the positions themselves, there are three types.
🎧 The first involves assisting persons confined to wheelchairs.
🎧 For this position, volunteers must be physically fit and in excellent health.
🎧 They must be able to lift at least 150 pounds.
🎧 They should also have a current First Aid certificate from the Red Cross.
🎧 But the most important requirement is that the volunteer must have his own car.
🎧 On Tuesday afternoons, the volunteers take their clients to various scenic spots around the city to experience and enjoy nature.
🎧 If you don't drive, but you'd still like to get involved,
🎧 the centre has a number of openings for people to read to the blind.
🎧 Readers must, of course, read English clearly.
🎧 Persons with no foreign accent are preferred.
🎧 For these positions, you must be available on Monday mornings.
🎧 Oh, wait, I see a note here.
🎧 There is one opening for someone who can read Urdu.
🎧 Apparently, there is a Pakistani blind person who'd like to hear his or her native language.
🎧 But the other positions are all in English.
🎧 And finally, there are a limited number of volunteers needed to care for disabled children.
🎧 I'm sorry, but the information I've been given does not say how many children or what disabilities they have.
🎧 In any case, you are needed to care for the children for one week in August.
🎧 Apparently, this will be at the close of the summer holiday.
🎧 I would guess this involves helping them with the routine chores of daily life.
🎧 Again, volunteers for this position must know basic First Aid,
🎧 be in good health, and be able to lift up to 75 pounds.
🎧 All applications for this position have to be submitted no later than Monday, August 8th.
🎧 Applications may be made either by a regular postal service - the "snail mail" - or by e-mail.
🎧 The mailing address is Worldwide Helpers, Post Office Box 651,
🎧 East Surrey BY8 99C.
🎧 Please write "ATTENTION: Mary Smith" on the envelope.
🎧 Or you can send e-mail to
🎧 acrawfor@worldwidehelpers.org.
🎧 That's A-C-R-A-W-F-O-R
🎧 @worldwidehelpers.org
🎧 So get out there and do something good!
🎧 OK, our next announcement is looking for someone to "facilitate" tiger breeding at the London Zoo.
🎧 And, get this, it's a "strictly volunteer" position.
🎧 That means you don't get paid!
🎧 Oh my God...
🎧 I'm sorry ladies and gentlemen, but I just have to laugh...
🎧 
🎧 Are you just leaving the library now?
🎧 I saw you get there at 8 am!
🎧 Yeah, I've been there all day.
🎧 What for?
🎧 They hired a cute new librarian or something?
🎧 I wish.
🎧 No, it's the presentation that I will give in Environmental Science the day after tomorrow.
🎧 What's it about?
🎧 I heard you were really excited about the class.
🎧 And Dr Schnee also calls you for the “arcane" questions, as he calls them.
🎧 It's about environmental damage in the Yucatan.
🎧 Excuse me, what?
🎧 Or is that where?
🎧 Yucatan.
🎧 It's a state in Southeast Mexico.
🎧 So what's happening there?
🎧 Agriculture is having a really adverse impact on the environment.
🎧 There are too many farmers doing too much farming.
🎧 It's really destroying the forests and ruining the soil.
🎧 Deforestation is a major problem there now.
🎧 How did you learn about this?
🎧 I don't recall Dr Schnee saying anything about it in lecture.
🎧 Yes, but my brother went there last month,
🎧 you know, to look at the old cities like the Mayan Indians built.
🎧 That's what first got me interested.
🎧 Your brother Tom?
🎧 No, Dick, Harry's twin.
🎧 Anyway, he told me how few trees there were now and how much empty ground that grows almost nothing.
🎧 He said the place looked more like the desert than jungle in some parts.
🎧 It brought environmental damage.
🎧 So I started looking for materials in the library.
🎧 Here, look at this magazine.
🎧 What's in it?
🎧 It's an old issue of "National Geographic".
🎧 It includes interviews with tourists who've been there in the past few years.
🎧 It's pretty bad. See the photos?
🎧 I see the photos, but one or two photos don't prove anything.
🎧 Then read what the article says. Right there.
🎧 The first thing it points out is how soil samples show it's hard for anything to grow there.
🎧 It says how an area of 21,000 square kilometres has lost most of its forest in the past ten years.
🎧 See, there are graphs.
🎧 As the number of farmers increases, the acres of forest have decreased.
🎧 It's an inverse relation.
🎧 So how big is that state?
🎧 I'm sorry, but I've never really learned the metric system.
🎧 It's bigger than the state of Massachusetts!
🎧 That's shocking!
🎧 Anything else?
🎧 There's lots of else.
🎧 Scientists say there's a "growing area" of about 10.5 square kilometres where nothing can grow at all.
🎧 It's like the beginning of a desert.
🎧 Oh yes.
🎧 What Dr Schnee called "desertification".
🎧 But, why can't anything grow there?
🎧 I've never really studied soil chemistry.
🎧 I'm just starting to look into that subject,
🎧 but my sister Marie is a geologist
🎧 and she says the problem is that the soil has too much saline,
🎧 with no plants helping to adjust the chemistry.
🎧 Apparently, that's a common problem with soil types throughout the areas with rainforest.
🎧 Once you lose the plant cover, it's difficult to bring it back.
🎧 Reforestation is almost impossible, even if the land is not being used for other purposes.
🎧 Wait a minute. What is "saline"?
🎧 Saline is salt dissolved in water.
🎧 Scientists who've gone there have taken measurements.
🎧 They do this by gathering a sample of the soil and running a simple test that shows the ionisation of the solution.
🎧 The Geology Department in our own university has reviewed the soil at the site, too.
🎧 They're right. It looks pretty bad.
🎧 The level of salinity is going up.
🎧 But the plants that would solve that problem can't be planted in soil like that.
🎧 There is a narrow spectrum of salinity in which the plants will grow.
🎧 And once you pass the threshold, there is no way to put the problem right?
🎧 Exactly. It's possible that no one can do anything to stop the trend now.
🎧 All because of human greed!
🎧 Wait a second.
🎧 How do you know these "scientists" can be trusted?
🎧 What kind of reputation do they have?
🎧 Are they reliable?
🎧 Oh they're definitely reliable.
🎧 They include four members of the faculty from the Geology Department right here at MIT.
🎧 Here, study these photographs and check the damage yourself.
🎧 That's what Dr Horst who wrote the book here did.
🎧 He's newly appointed, but Dr Schnee says that he's brilliant.
🎧 So, where are you going now?
🎧 I'm headed over to the Geography Department to borrow a map for my presentation.
🎧 You know, this whole problem could have been avoided!
🎧 The farmers there in the Yucatan...
🎧 Uh, Pete??
🎧 What?
🎧 Go take a break! Leave some studying for the rest of us.
🎧 
🎧 Good afternoon, and welcome to Insect Biology 101.
🎧 I'd like to begin this course with a few remarks about good insects and bad ones.
🎧 Bugs are all around us and that's both a benefit and an annoyance,
🎧 sometimes maybe even serious harm.
🎧 First, let's talk about the good things that insects do for us.
🎧 Probably the most important insect for humans, and maybe for all other life, is the bee.
🎧 Bees help plants in the process of pollination,
🎧 and thus are necessary to most flowers and fruit-producing trees.
🎧 That is, they carry pollen from "male" flowers to "female".
🎧 If it weren't for bees, we'd have very few food plants and no fruit either.
🎧 In fact, there would be no "we".
🎧 No less a thinker than Albert Einstein pointed out that,
🎧 without bees, humanity would be dead within a year or less.
🎧 We'd starve. It's that simple.
🎧 That should maybe make us just a little humble.
🎧 A little less dramatic is the fact that bees also make the honey we eat.
🎧 Moreover, they produce beeswax, which is useful in candles
🎧 and it's also used as a first-rate furniture polish.
🎧 Sure, these may not be vital to our lives,
🎧 but they can serve as reminders of how important bees are.
🎧 That's a point I keep coming back to in this course.
🎧 Though, in all fairness, I should point out that butterflies aid in pollination as well as bees.
🎧 Now, here in Michigan, what's the worst part of summer?
🎧 Yep, that's right - mosquitoes.
🎧 But I'm talking about helpful insects, right?
🎧 So let's look at the dragonfly first.
🎧 If there were no dragonflies, there would be even more mosquitoes!
🎧 Dragonflies mainly eat mosquitoes and also a few other insects.
🎧 Yes, that's right.
🎧 They don't just fly around, and they also help to eliminate harmful insects.
🎧 So, the next time you see a dragonfly, don't you dare kill it!
🎧 Now let's talk a little about those harmful insects.
🎧 Take the mosquitoes I just mentioned as an example.
🎧 Not so many years ago, mosquitoes here in America weren't just annoying.
🎧 Some were even deadly.
🎧 They carried malaria and yellow fever.
🎧 My own ancestor, the Confederate General John Bell Hood,
🎧 lived through the worst battles of Civil War only to die at age 38 from yellow fever.
🎧 A pest, not a bullet!
🎧 Well, besides the mosquitoes, in summer there is also a kind of insect that never seems tired.
🎧 Right, that is the fly.
🎧 Before I go on talking, I must mention an African fly called the Tsetse fly,
🎧 which feeds on blood and can cause serious diseases in the people and animals that it bites.
🎧 Besides, it is still a bearer of sleeping sickness,
🎧 which affects around 300,000 people every year in Africa
🎧 and can be treated only with toxic drugs that are hard to administer.
🎧 Worse still, the drugs sometimes don't work.
🎧 Other insects, of course, destroy food crops.
🎧 In China, for instance, locusts continue to be a danger to the harvest in some areas.
🎧 Less important, but still annoying, moths eat people's clothes and dust mites slowly destroy carpets.
🎧 Worse, but still in the home, termites or "white ants" eat wood - the wood of your house.
🎧 If they are not stopped, they can eventually destroy the whole building.
🎧 Usually they seriously damage a building before anyone even notices them.
🎧 So, as we all know, insects can be a real trouble.
🎧 So, what to do?
🎧 You can go ahead and start killing harmful insects.
🎧 In the early decades after the communist revolution in China,
🎧 Chairman Mao encouraged the people to swat every fly they could see.
🎧 Slogans on the walls of buildings called them "Little Capitalists".
🎧 But flies reproduced too quickly for this to be a long-term solution.
🎧 For some decades in the West, to kill insects with chemicals seemed a good remedy.
🎧 Unfortunately, chemicals can only be used in a limited area for a limited time.
🎧 It's a small-scale solution.
🎧 The insects come back.
🎧 Worse still, some of the poisons used like DDT were found harmful to the environment.
🎧 Many kinds of wildlife, like hawks, were harmed.
🎧 And people in chemical-using rural areas have one of the highest rates of liver cancer in the world.
🎧 It's no secret that chemicals remain harmful to humans.
🎧 Like all species, insects adapt to their changing environments at an amazing rate.
🎧 When a new chemical is introduced to their habitat,
🎧 the insects that survive are generally the ones with some way of resisting the harmful effects.
🎧 They then breed with the other survivors,
🎧 and just like that insects become resistant to most poison in a few generations.
🎧 An insect generation, remember, is a couple of months at most!
🎧 So, again we have to ask: what to do?
🎧 Well, there are biological solutions.
🎧 Some of these are pretty simple.
🎧 One is destroying the insects' habitat.
🎧 You take away their home or food.
🎧 Cleaning your kitchen is the best way to prevent roaches.
🎧 No garbage: no food.
🎧 Getting rid of marshes and swamps eliminates mosquitoes.
🎧 Other solutions might include bringing in dragonflies or bats in areas where mosquitoes are many.
🎧 This is a cheaper alternative to chemicals.
🎧 Biological methods like this also bring no extra pollution to the environment.
🎧 But you have to be careful.
🎧 If you change the environment too much, you might be hurting other forms of life accidentally.
🎧 One recent method of controlling insect populations involves interrupting their breeding cycle.
🎧 What does that mean?
🎧 It means "birth control for bugs".
🎧 Insects are provided with food that makes them unable to reproduce.
🎧 Since they can't have babies, the population disappears, or nearly so.
🎧 And since no young are born,
🎧 resistance is not a problem with no young insects developing increased resistance.
🎧 Interrupt the life cycle, eliminate the bug!
🎧 It's clear that we must have an understanding of the life cycle of the insect.
🎧 At least, that's the plan.
🎧 We'll go into more detail as the course goes along.
🎧 Now I will stop here to see whether you have any questions or not.
