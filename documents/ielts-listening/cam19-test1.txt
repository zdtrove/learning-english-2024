🎧 Okay. What would you like to know?
🎧 Well, I'm new to this area,
🎧 so perhaps you could tell me something about the park first, please.
🎧 Of course.
🎧 Altogether the park covers 170 acres,
🎧 that's 69 hectares.
🎧 There are three main types of habitat:
🎧 wetland, grassland and woodland.
🎧 The woods are well established and varied,
🎧 with an oak plantation, and other areas of mixed species.
🎧 Right.
🎧 The wetland is quite varied, too.
🎧 The original farmland was dug up around 40 years ago to extract gravel.
🎧 Once this work was completed,
🎧 the gravel pits filled with water, forming the two large lakes.
🎧 There are also several smaller ones, ponds and a stream that flows through the park.
🎧 Okay, so I suppose with these different habitats there's quite a variety of wildlife.
🎧 There certainly is.
🎧 A lot of different species of birds and insects,
🎧 and also animals like deer and rabbits.
🎧 And I understand you organise educational visits for school parties.
🎧 That's right.
🎧 We can organise a wide range of activities and adapt them to suit all ages.
🎧 Can you give me some examples of the activities?
🎧 Well, one focus is on science,
🎧 where we help children to discover and study plants, trees and insects.
🎧 They also collect and analyse data about the things they see.
🎧 Another focus is on geography.
🎧 The park is a great environment to learn and practise reading a map
🎧 and using a compass to navigate around the park.
🎧 Do you do anything connected with history?
🎧 Yes, we do.
🎧 For instance, the children can explore how the use of the land has changed over time.
🎧 Then there's leisure and tourism.
🎧 That focuses on your visitors, I would imagine.
🎧 Yes, mostly.
🎧 The children find out about them,
🎧 their requirements, the problems they may cause and how we manage these.
🎧 And another subject we cover is music:
🎧 here the children experiment with natural materials to create sounds
🎧 and explore rhythm and tempo.
🎧 That must be fun!
🎧 Most children really enjoy it.
🎧 And of course, all the activities are educational, too.
🎧 Learning outside the classroom encourages children to be creative,
🎧 and to explore and discover for themselves.
🎧 I would imagine they get a sense of freedom that might not be a normal part of their lives.
🎧 That's right.
🎧 And very often the children discover that they can do things they didn't know they could do,
🎧 and they develop new skills.
🎧 This gives them greater self-confidence.
🎧 It sounds great.
🎧 So, what about the practical side of it?
🎧 How much does it cost for a full-day visit?
🎧 We would expect to bring between 30 and 40 children.
🎧 If there are over 30,
🎧 it costs £4.95 for each child who attends on the day.
🎧 We invoice you afterwards,
🎧 so you don't pay for children who can't come because of sickness, for example.
🎧 There's no charge for leaders and other adults - as many as you want to bring.
🎧 That sounds very fair.
🎧 Well, thanks for all the information.
🎧 I'll need to discuss it with my colleagues,
🎧 and I hope to get back to you soon to make a booking.
🎧 We'll look forward to hearing from you.
🎧 Goodbye.
🎧 Goodbye, and thank you.
🎧 
🎧 It's great to see so many members of the Twinning Association here tonight.
🎧 Since the twinning link between our two towns, Stanthorpe here in England and Malatte in France, was established,
🎧 the relationship between the towns has gone from strength to strength.
🎧 Last month, 25 members of the association from Stanthorpe spent a weekend in Malatte.
🎧 Our hosts had arranged a great programme.
🎧 We learned how cheese is produced in the region
🎧 and had the chance to taste the products.
🎧 The theme park trip had to be cancelled,
🎧 but we all had a great time on the final boat trip down the river,
🎧 that was the real highlight.
🎧 This is a special year for the Association
🎧 because it's 25 years since we were founded.
🎧 In Malatte, they're planning to mark this by building a footbridge in the municipal park.
🎧 We've been discussing what to do here
🎧 and we've decided to plant a poplar tree in the museum gardens.
🎧 We considered buying a garden seat to put there,
🎧 but the authorities weren't happy with that idea.
🎧 In terms of fundraising to support our activities,
🎧 we've done very well.
🎧 Our pancake evening was well attended and made record profits.
🎧 And everyone enjoyed the demonstration of French cookery,
🎧 which was nearly as successful.
🎧 Numbers for our film show were limited because of the venue
🎧 so we're looking for somewhere bigger next year.
🎧 We're looking forward to welcoming our French visitors here next week,
🎧 and I know that many of you here will be hosting individuals or families.
🎧 The coach from France will arrive at 5 pm on Friday.
🎧 Don't try to do too much that first evening as they'll be tired,
🎧 so have dinner in the house or garden rather than eating out.
🎧 The weather looks as if it'll be okay
🎧 so you might like to plan a barbecue.
🎧 Then the next morning's market day in town,
🎧 and that's always a good place to stroll round.
🎧 On Saturday evening, we'll all meet up at the football club,
🎧 where once again we'll have Toby Sharp and his band
🎧 performing English and Scottish country songs.
🎧 Toby will already be well known to many of you
🎧 as last year he organised our special quiz night and presented the prizes.
🎧 Now on Sunday, we'll be taking our visitors to Farley House.
🎧 You may not all be familiar with it, so here's a map to help you.
🎧 You can see the car park at the bottom of the map.
🎧 There's an excellent farm shop in the grounds where our visitors can buy local produce,
🎧 it's in the old stables, which is the first building you come to.
🎧 They're built round a courtyard, and the shop's in the far corner on the left.
🎧 There's also a small café on the right as you go in.
🎧 I know that one or two of our visitors may not be all that mobile.
🎧 The main entrance to the house has a lot of steps
🎧 so you might want to use the disabled entry.
🎧 This is on the far side of the house from the car park.
🎧 Children will probably be most interested in the adventure playground.
🎧 That's at the northern end of the larger lake,
🎧 in a bend on the path that leads to the lake.
🎧 There's lots for children to do there.
🎧 There are a number of lovely gardens near the house.
🎧 The kitchen gardens are rectangular and surrounded by a wall.
🎧 They're to the north-east of the house, quite near the smaller lake.
🎧 They're still in use and have a great collection of fruit and vegetables.
🎧 The Temple of the Four Winds is a bit more of a walk,
🎧 but it's worth it.
🎧 Take the path from the car park
🎧 and go past the western sides of the stables and the house.
🎧 Then when the path forks, take the right-hand path.
🎧 Go up there with the woods on your left and the temple is right at the end.
🎧 There are great views over the whole area.
🎧 
🎧 I haven't seen you for a bit, Marie.
🎧 No. I've been busy with my project.
🎧 You're making a vegan alternative to eggs, aren't you?
🎧 Something that doesn't use animal products?
🎧 Yes. I'm using chickpeas.
🎧 I had two main aims when I first started looking for an alternative to eggs,
🎧 but actually I've found chickpeas have got more advantages.
🎧 But how about your project on reusing waste food?
🎧 You were looking at bread, weren't you?
🎧 Yes. It's been hard work, but I've enjoyed it.
🎧 The basic process was quite straightforward:
🎧 breaking the stale bread down to a paste then reforming it.
🎧 But you were using 3-D printing, weren't you, to make the paste into biscuits?
🎧 Yeah, I'd used that before,
🎧 but in this project, I had time to play around with different patterns for the biscuits
🎧 and finding how I could add fruit and vegetables to make them a more appetising colour,
🎧 and I was really pleased with what I managed to produce.
🎧 It must've been a great feeling to make something appetising out of bits of old bread that would've been thrown away otherwise.
🎧 It was.
🎧 And I'm hoping that some of the restaurants in town will be interested in the biscuits.
🎧 I'm going to send them some samples.
🎧 I came across something on the internet yesterday that might interest you.
🎧 It was a company that's developed touch-sensitive sensors for food labels.
🎧 It's a special sort of label on the food package.
🎧 When the label's smooth, the food is fresh
🎧 and then when you can feel bumps on the label,
🎧 that means the food's gone bad.
🎧 It started off as a project to help visually impaired people know whether food was fit to eat or not.
🎧 Interesting.
🎧 So just solid food?
🎧 No, things like milk and juice as well.
🎧 But actually, I thought it might be really good for drug storage in hospitals and pharmacies.
🎧 Right.
🎧 And coming back to food,
🎧 maybe it'd be possible to use it for other things besides freshness.
🎧 Like how many kilograms a joint of meat is, for example.
🎧 Yes, there's all sorts of possibilities.
🎧 I was reading an article about food trends
🎧 predicting how eating habits might change in the next few years.
🎧 Oh... things like more focus on local products?
🎧 That seems so obvious, but the shops are still full of imported foods.
🎧 Yes, they need to be more proactive to address that.
🎧 And somehow motivate consumers to change, yes.
🎧 One thing everyone's aware of is the need for a reduction in unnecessary packaging
🎧 but just about everything you buy in supermarkets is still covered in plastic.
🎧 The government needs to do something about it.
🎧 Absolutely. It's got to change.
🎧 Do you think there'll be more interest in gluten- and lactose-free food?
🎧 For people with allergies or food intolerances?
🎧 I don't know.
🎧 Lots of people I know have been buying that type of food for years now.
🎧 Yes, even if they haven't been diagnosed with an allergy.
🎧 That's right.
🎧 One thing I've noticed is the number of branded products related to celebrity chefs.
🎧 People watch them cooking on TV
🎧 and then buy things like spice mixes or frozen foods with the chef's name on...
🎧 I bought something like that once, but I won't again.
🎧 Yeah I bought a ready-made spice mix for chicken
🎧 which was supposed to be used by a chef I'd seen on television,
🎧 and it didn't actually taste of anything.
🎧 Did the article mention 'ghost kitchens' used to produce takeaway food?
🎧 No. What are they?
🎧 Well, they might have the name of a restaurant,
🎧 but actually they're a cooking facility just for delivery meals.
🎧 The public don't ever go there.
🎧 But people aren't aware of that.
🎧 It's all kept very quiet.
🎧 So people don't realise the food's not actually from the restaurant?
🎧 Right.
🎧 Did you know more and more people are using all sorts of different mushrooms now,
🎧 to treat different health concerns?
🎧 Things like heart problems?
🎧 Hmm. They might be taking a big risk there.
🎧 Yes, it's hard to know which varieties are safe to eat.
🎧 Anyway...
🎧 
🎧 For my presentation today, I'm going to talk about the Ceide Fields in the northwest of Ireland,
🎧 one of the largest Neolithic sites in the world.
🎧 I recently visited this site
🎧 and observed the work that is currently being done by a team of archaeologists there.
🎧 The site was first discovered in the 1930s
🎧 by a local teacher, Patrick Caulfield.
🎧 He noticed that when local people were digging in the bog,
🎧 they were constantly hitting against what seemed to be rows of stones.
🎧 He realised that these must be walls
🎧 and that they must be thousands of years old for them to predate the bog which subsequently grew over them.
🎧 He wrote to the National Museum in Dublin to ask them to investigate,
🎧 but no one took him seriously.
🎧 It wasn't until 40 years later,
🎧 when Patrick Caulfield's son Seamus, who had become an archaeologist by then, began to explore further.
🎧 He inserted iron probes into the bog to map the formation of the stones,
🎧 a traditional method which local people had always used for finding fuel buried in the bog for thousands of years.
🎧 Carbon dating later proved that the site was over 5,000 years old
🎧 and was the largest Neolithic site in Ireland.
🎧 Thanks to the bog which covers the area,
🎧 the remains of the settlement at Ceide Fields, which is over 5,000 years old,
🎧 are extremely well-preserved.
🎧 A bog is 90% water;
🎧 its soil is so saturated that when the grasses and heathers that grow on its surface die,
🎧 they don't fully decay but accumulate in layers.
🎧 Objects remain so well preserved in these conditions
🎧 because of the acidity of the peat and the deficiency of oxygen.
🎧 At least 175 days of rain a year are required for this to happen;
🎧 this part of Ireland gets an average of 225 days.
🎧 The Neolithic farmers at Ceide would have enjoyed several centuries of relative peace and stability.
🎧 Neolithic farmers generally lived in larger communities than their predecessors,
🎧 with a number of houses built around a community building.
🎧 As they lived in permanent settlements,
🎧 Neolithic farmers were able to build bigger houses.
🎧 These weren't round as people often assume,
🎧 but rectangular with a small hole in the roof that allowed smoke to escape.
🎧 This is one of many innovations
🎧 and indicates that the Neolithic farmers were the first people to cook indoors.
🎧 Another new technology that Neolithic settlers brought to Ireland was pottery.
🎧 Fragments of Neolithic pots have been found in Ceide and elsewhere in Ireland.
🎧 The pots were used for many things;
🎧 as well as for storing food,
🎧 pots were filled with a small amount of fat
🎧 and when this was set alight, they served as lamps.
🎧 It's thought that the Ceide Fields were mainly used as paddocks for animals to graze in.
🎧 Evidence from the Ceide Fields suggests that each plot of land was of a suitable size to sustain an extended family.
🎧 They may have used a system of rotational grazing
🎧 in order to prevent over-grazing
🎧 and to allow for plant recovery and regrowth.
🎧 This must've been a year-round activity
🎧 as no structures have been found which would have been used to shelter animals in the winter.
🎧 However, archaeologists believe that this way of life at Ceide ceased abruptly.
🎧 Why was this?
🎧 Well, several factors may have contributed to the changing circumstances.
🎧 The soil would have become less productive and led to the abandonment of farming.
🎧 The crop rotation system was partly responsible for this
🎧 as it would have been very intensive and was not sustainable.
🎧 But there were also climatic pressures too.
🎧 The farmers at Ceide would have enjoyed a relatively dry period,
🎧 but this began to change
🎧 and the conditions became wetter as there was a lot more rain.
🎧 It was these conditions that encouraged the bog to form over the area which survives today.
🎧 So now I'd like to show you...
