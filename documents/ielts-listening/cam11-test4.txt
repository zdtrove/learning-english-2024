[141] Cam11 - Test 4 - Part 1

🎧 Good morning. Stretton Festival box office. How can I help you?
🎧 Oh, hello.
🎧 My family and I are on holiday in the area,
🎧 and we've seen some posters about the festival this week.
🎧 Could you tell me about some of the events, please?
🎧 Of course.
🎧 First of all, are there still tickets available for the jazz band on Saturday?
🎧 There are, but only £15.
🎧 The £12 seats have all been sold.
🎧 OK. And the venue is the school, isn't it?
🎧 Yes, that's right, the secondary school.
🎧 Make sure you don't go to the primary school by mistake!
🎧 And there's an additional performer who isn't mentioned on the posters -
🎧 Carolyn Hart is going to play with the band.
🎧 Oh, I think I've heard her on the radio.
🎧 Doesn't she play the oboe, or flute or something?
🎧 Yes the flute.
🎧 She usually plays with symphony orchestras,
🎧 and apparently this is her first time with a jazz band.
🎧 Well, I'd certainly like to hear her.
🎧 Then the next thing I want to ask about is the duck races -
🎧 I saw a poster beside a river. What are they, exactly?
🎧 Well, you buy a yellow plastic duck - or as many as you like - they're a pound each.
🎧 And you write your name on each one.
🎧 There'll be several races, depending on the number of ducks taking part.
🎧 And John Stevens, a champion swimmer who lives locally, is going to start the races.
🎧 All the ducks will be launched into the river at the back of the cinema,
🎧 then they'll float along the river for 500 metres, as far as the railway bridge.
🎧 And are there any prizes?
🎧 Yes, the first duck in each race to arrive at the finishing line wins its owner free tickets for the concert on the last night of the festival.
🎧 You said you can buy a duck?
🎧 I'm sure my children will both want one.
🎧 They're on sale at a stall in the market.
🎧 You can't miss it -
🎧 it's got an enormous sign showing a couple of ducks.
🎧 OK. I'll go there this afternoon.
🎧 I remember walking past there yesterday.
🎧 Now could you tell me something about the flower show, please?
🎧 Well, admission is free,
🎧 and the show is being held in Bythwaite Hall.
🎧 Sorry, how do you spell that?
🎧 B-Y-T-H-W-A-I-T-E.
🎧 Bythwaite.
🎧 Is it easy to find?
🎧 I'm not very familiar with the town yet.
🎧 Oh, you won't have any problem.
🎧 It's right in the centre of Stretton.
🎧 It's the only old building in the town, so it's easy to recognise.
🎧 I know it.
🎧 I presume it's open all day.
🎧 Yes, but if you'd like to see the prizes being awarded for the best flowers,
🎧 you'll need to be there at 5 o'clock.
🎧 The prizes are being given by a famous actor, Kevin Shapless.
🎧 He lives nearby and gets involved in a lot of community events.
🎧 Gosh, I've seen him on TV.
🎧 I'll definitely go to the prize-giving.
🎧 Right.
🎧 I've seen a list of plays that are being performed this week,
🎧 and I'd like to know which are suitable for my children,
🎧 and which ones my husband and I might go to.
🎧 How old are your children?
🎧 Five and seven.
🎧 What about 'The Mystery of Muldoon'?
🎧 That's aimed at five to ten-year-olds.
🎧 So if I take my children, I can expect them to enjoy it more than I do?
🎧 I think so.
🎧 If you'd like something for yourself and your husband and leave your children with a babysitter,
🎧 you might like to see 'Fire and Flood' -
🎧 it's about events that really happened in Stretton 200 years ago,
🎧 and children might find it rather frightening.
🎧 Oh, thanks for the warning.
🎧 And finally, what about 'Silly Sailor'?
🎧 That's a comedy, and it's for young and old.
🎧 In fact, it won an award in the Stretton Drama Festival a couple of months ago.
🎧 OK.
🎧 Well, goodbye, and thanks for all the information.
🎧 I'm looking forward to the festival!
🎧 Goodbye.

[142] Cam11 - Test 4 - Part 2

🎧 Good morning, and welcome to the museum -
🎧 one with a remarkable range of exhibits, which I'm sure you'll enjoy.
🎧 My name's Greg, and I'll tell you about the various collections as we go around.
🎧 But before we go, let me just give you a taste of what we have here.
🎧 Well, for one thing, we have a fine collection of twentieth and twenty-first century paintings,
🎧 many by very well-known artists.
🎧 I'm sure you'll recognise several of the paintings.
🎧 This is the gallery that attracts the largest number of visitors,
🎧 so it's best to go in early in the day, before the crowds arrive.
🎧 Then there are the nineteenth century paintings.
🎧 The museum was opened in the middle of that century,
🎧 and several of the artists each donated one work - to get the museum started, as it were.
🎧 So they're of special interest to us -
🎧 we feel closer to them than to other works.
🎧 The sculpture gallery has a number of fine exhibits,
🎧 but I'm afraid it's currently closed for refurbishment.
🎧 You'll need to come back next year to see it properly,
🎧 but a number of the sculptures have been moved to other parts of the museum.
🎧 'Around the world' is a temporary exhibition -
🎧 you've probably seen something about it on TV or in the newspapers.
🎧 It's created a great deal of interest, because it presents objects from every continent and many countries,
🎧 and provides information about their social context - why they were made, who for, and so on.
🎧 Then there's the collection of coins.
🎧 This is what you might call a focused, specialist collection,
🎧 because all the coins come from this country,
🎧 and were produced between two thousand and a thousand years ago.
🎧 And many of them were discovered by ordinary people digging their gardens and donated to the museum!
🎧 All our porcelain and glass was left to the museum by its founder, when he died in 1878.
🎧 And in the terms of his will, we're not allowed to add anything to that collection:
🎧 he believed it was perfect in itself, and we don't see any reason to disagree!
🎧 OK, that was something about the collections,
🎧 and now here's some more practical information, in case you need it.
🎧 Most of the museum facilities are downstairs, in the basement,
🎧 so you go down the stairs here.
🎧 When you reach the bottom of the stairs, you'll find yourself in a sitting area,
🎧 with comfortable chairs and sofas
🎧 where you can have a rest before continuing your exploration of the museum.
🎧 We have a very good restaurant, which serves excellent food all day, in a relaxing atmosphere.
🎧 To reach it, when you get to the bottom of the stairs, go straight ahead to the far side of the sitting area,
🎧 then turn right into the corridor.
🎧 You'll see the door of the restaurant facing you.
🎧 If you just want a snack, or if you'd like to eat somewhere with facilities for children,
🎧 we also have a café.
🎧 When you reach the bottom of the stairs, you'll need to go straight ahead,
🎧 turn right into the corridor, and the café is immediately on the right.
🎧 And talking about children, there are baby-changing facilities downstairs:
🎧 cross the sitting area, continue straight ahead along the corridor on the left
🎧 and you and your baby will find the facilities on the left-hand side.
🎧 The cloakroom where you should leave coats, umbrellas and any large bags,
🎧 is on the left hand side of the sitting area.
🎧 It's through the last door before you come to the corridor.
🎧 There are toilets on every floor,
🎧 but in the basement they're the first rooms on the left when you get down there.
🎧 OK, now if you've got anything to leave in the cloakroom,
🎧 please do that now, and then we'll start our tour.

[143] Cam11 - Test 4 - Part 3

🎧 Hi, Joanna, good to meet you.
🎧 Now, before we discuss your new research project.
🎧 I'd like to hear something about the psychology study you did last year for your Master's degree.
🎧 So how did you choose your subjects for that?
🎧 Well, I had six subjects, all professional musicians, and all female.
🎧 Three were violinists
🎧 and there was also a cello player and a pianist and a flute player.
🎧 They were all very highly regarded in the music world
🎧 and they'd done quite extensive tours in different continents,
🎧 and quite a few had won prizes in competitions as well.
🎧 And they were quite young, weren't they?
🎧 Yes, between 25 and 29 -
🎧 the mean was 27.8.
🎧 I wasn't specifically looking for artists who'd produced recordings but...
🎧 this is something that's just taken for granted these days, and they all had.
🎧 Right.
🎧 Now you collected your data through telephone interviews, didn't you?
🎧 Yes.
🎧 I realised if I was going to interview leading musicians, it'd only be possible over the phone because they're so busy.
🎧 I recorded them using a telephone recording adaptor.
🎧 I'd been worried about the quality, but it worked out all right.
🎧 I managed at least a 30-minute interview with each subject, sometimes longer.
🎧 Did doing it on the phone make it more stressful?
🎧 I'd thought it might…
🎧 it was all quite informal though and in fact they seemed very keen to talk.
🎧 And I don't think using the phone meant I got less rich data rather the opposite in fact.
🎧 Interesting.
🎧 And you were looking at how performers dress for concert performances?
🎧 That's right.
🎧 My research investigated the way players see their role as a musician
🎧 and how this is linked to the type of clothing they decide to wear.
🎧 But that focus didn't emerge immediately.
🎧 When I started I was more interested in trying to investigate the impact of what was worn on those listening,
🎧 and also whether someone like a violinist might adopt a different style of clothing from, say, someone playing the flute or the trumpet.
🎧 It's interesting that the choice of dress is up to the individual, isn't it?
🎧 Yes, you'd expect there to be rules about it in orchestras, but that's quite rare.
🎧 You only had women performers in your study.
🎧 Was that because male musicians are less worried about fashion?
🎧 I think a lot of the men are very much influenced by fashion,
🎧 but in social terms the choices they have are more limited…
🎧 they'd really upset audiences if they strayed away from quite narrow boundaries.
🎧 Now, popular music has quite different expectations.
🎧 Did you read Mike Frost's article about the dress of women performers in popular music...
🎧 No.
🎧 where he points out that a lot of female singers and musicians in popular music tend to dress down in performances,
🎧 and wear less feminine clothes, erm, like jeans instead of skirts,
🎧 and he suggests this is because otherwise they'd just be discounted as trivial.
🎧 But you could argue they're just wearing what's practical…
🎧 I mean, a pop-music concert is usually a pretty energetic affair.
🎧 Yes, he doesn't make that point, but I think you're probably right.
🎧 I was interested by the effect of the audience at a musical performance when it came to the choice of dress.
🎧 The subjects I interviewed felt this was really important.
🎧 It's all to do with what we understand by performance as a public event.
🎧 They believed the audience had certain expectations
🎧 and it was up to them as performers to fulfill these expectations to show a kind of esteem…
🎧 they weren't afraid of looking as if they'd made an effort to look good.
🎧 I think in the past the audience would have had those expectations of one another too,
🎧 but that's not really the case now, not in the UK anyway.
🎧 No.
🎧 And I also got interested in what sports scientists are doing too, with regard to clothing.
🎧 Musicians are quite vulnerable physically, aren't they, because...
🎧 the movements they carry out are very intensive and repetitive, so...
🎧 I'd imagine some features of sports clothing could safeguard the players from the potentially dangerous effects of this sort of thing.
🎧 Yes, but musicians don't really consider it.
🎧 They avoid clothing that obviously restricts their movements, but that's as far as they go.
🎧 Anyway, coming back to your own research, do you have any idea where you're going from here?
🎧 I was thinking of doing a study using an audience...

[144] Cam11 - Test 4 - Part 4

🎧 As we saw in the last lecture,
🎧 a major cause of climate change is the rapid rise in the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere over the last century.
🎧 If we could reduce the amount of CO2,
🎧 perhaps the rate of climate change could also be slowed down.
🎧 One potential method involves enhancing the role of the soil that plants grow in,
🎧 with regard to absorbing CO2.
🎧 Rattan Lal, a soil scientist from Ohio State University, in the USA,
🎧 claims that the world's agricultural soils could potentially absorb 13% of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere -
🎧 the equivalent of the amount released in the last 30 years.
🎧 And research is going on into how this might be achieved.
🎧 Lal first came to the idea that soil might be valuable in this way not through an interest in climate change,
🎧 but rather out of concern for the land itself and the people dependent on it.
🎧 Carbon-rich soil is dark, crumbly and fertile, and retains some water.
🎧 But erosion can occur if soil is dry,
🎧 which is a likely effect if it contains inadequate amounts of carbon.
🎧 Erosion is of course bad for people trying to grow crops or breed animals on that terrain.
🎧 In the 1970s and '80s,
🎧 Lal was studying soils in Africa so devoid of organic matter
🎧 that the ground had become extremely hard, like cement.
🎧 There he met a pioneer in the study of global warming,
🎧 who suggested that carbon from the soil had moved into the atmosphere.
🎧 This is now looking increasingly likely.
🎧 Let me explain.
🎧 For millions of years, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have been regulated, in part,
🎧 by a natural partnership between plants and microbes - tiny organisms in the soil.
🎧 Plants absorb CO2 from the air
🎧 and transform it into sugars and other carbon-based substances.
🎧 While a proportion of these carbon products remain in the plant,
🎧 some transfer from the roots to fungi and soil microbes,
🎧 which store the carbon in the soil.
🎧 The invention of agriculture some 10,000 years ago
🎧 disrupted these ancient soil-building processes
🎧 and led to the loss of carbon from the soil.
🎧 When humans started draining the natural topsoil, and ploughing it up for planting,
🎧 they exposed the buried carbon to oxygen.
🎧 This created carbon dioxide and released it into the air.
🎧 And in some places,
🎧 grazing by domesticated animals has removed all vegetation, releasing carbon into the air.
🎧 Tons of carbon have been stripped from the world's soils - where it's needed -
🎧 and pumped into the atmosphere.
🎧 So what can be done?
🎧 Researchers are now coming up with evidence that even modest changes to farming
🎧 can significantly help to reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere.
🎧 Some growers have already started using an approach known as regenerative agriculture.
🎧 This aims to boost the fertility of soil and keep it moist through established practices.
🎧 These include keeping fields planted all year round,
🎧 and increasing the variety of plants being grown.
🎧 Strategies like these can significantly increase the amount of carbon stored in the soil,
🎧 so agricultural researchers are now building a case for their use in combating climate change.
🎧 One American investigation into the potential for storing CO2 on agricultural lands is taking place in California.
🎧 Soil scientist Whendee Silver of the University of California, Berkeley,
🎧 is conducting a first-of-its-kind study on a large cattle farm in the state.
🎧 She and her students are testing the effects on carbon storage of the compost that is created from waste -
🎧 both agricultural, including manure and cornstalks,
🎧 and waste produced in gardens, such as leaves, branches, and lawn trimmings.
🎧 In Australia, soil ecologist Christine Jones is testing another promising soil-enrichment strategy.
🎧 Jones and 12 farmers are working to build up soil carbon by cultivating grasses that stay green all year round.
🎧 Like composting, the approach has already been proved experimentally;
🎧 Jones now hopes to show that it can be applied on working farms
🎧 and that the resulting carbon capture can be accurately measured.
🎧 It's hoped in the future that projects such as these
🎧 will demonstrate the role that farmers and other land managers can play in reducing the harmful effects of greenhouse gases.
🎧 For example, in countries like the United States,
🎧 where most farming operations use large applications of fertiliser,
🎧 changing such long-standing habits will require a change of system.
🎧 Rattan Lal argues that farmers should receive payment not just for the corn or beef they produce
🎧 but also for the carbon they can store in their soil.
🎧 Another study being..
