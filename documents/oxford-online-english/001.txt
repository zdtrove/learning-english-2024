🎧 Hello, I'm Oli.
🎧 Welcome to Oxford Online English!
🎧 In this lesson, you can learn about how to talk about your free time and hobbies in English.
🎧 What do you like doing in your free time?
🎧 Do you have any interesting hobbies?
🎧 Talking about your free time is a great way to start a conversation in English, or to find things in common when you're speaking to somebody.
🎧 By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to speak clearly and naturally about your free time and your hobbies in English.
🎧 Part one: free time and hobbies vocabulary.
🎧 What words do you know for free time activities in English?
🎧 Some people prefer things you can do at home, like watching TV, reading, or cooking.
🎧 Other people like sports, like playing football, playing basketball, playing tennis, going swimming, going jogging, or going climbing, or maybe doing boxing, doing judo, or doing yoga.
🎧 Of course, many people prefer more social activities, for example, hanging out with your friends, relaxing with your family, or going shopping.
🎧 Or maybe you like to do something more creative, like taking photos, painting, or writing stories or writing a blog.
🎧 What about you?
🎧 What kind of free time activities do you prefer?
🎧 Let's look at how you can talk about free time activities and hobbies which you like.
🎧 Part two: what do you like doing?
🎧 In my free time, I like . . . What could you say here?
🎧 In my free time, I like playing basketball.
🎧 In my free time, I like relaxing with my family.
🎧 In my free time, I like reading books.
🎧 Can you see a pattern here?
🎧 In every sentence, after 'like,' we use a verb plus -ing.
🎧 Can you make a sentence?
🎧 What do you like doing in your free time?
🎧 But just using 'like' can be repetitive and boring.
🎧 So what other verbs can you use?
🎧 Well, you could use verbs like 'love', 'enjoy', or 'hate'.
🎧 For example: I love going swimming.
🎧 I enjoy watching TV.
🎧 I hate going shopping.
🎧 Can you see the same pattern?
🎧 After all of these verbs, you need to use a verb with -ing.
🎧 You can also add words like 'really', 'sometimes', or 'absolutely', to make your meaning stronger or weaker.
🎧 For example: I really like taking photos.
🎧 Sometimes I enjoy going jogging.
🎧 I absolutely hate playing football.
🎧 Now it's your turn.
🎧 What can you say?
🎧 Can you make your own sentences?
🎧 OK, so now you can say something about what you like or don't like doing.
🎧 Let's look at how you can add more details to your ideas.
🎧 First, let's say how often you do your free time activity.
🎧 For example: I like playing sport.
🎧 I play football every Tuesday evening.
🎧 I absolutely hate going shopping.
🎧 I only go shopping once or twice a year.
🎧 I really like taking photos, but I don't get the chance to do it often.
🎧 What about you?
🎧 How often do you do your hobbies?
🎧 You can use these phrases to help you talk.
🎧 'Every . . .' For example: 'every weekend', 'every Saturday afternoon', 'every day'.
🎧 'Once or twice a . . .', for example: 'once a week', 'twice a month', 'three times a year', and so on.
🎧 Can you make some sentences like this about your free time and hobbies?
🎧 How often do you do your hobbies?
🎧 Next, let's add some details about where you do your hobby or free time activity.
🎧 For example: I like playing sport.
🎧 I play football every Tuesday evening at the park near my house.
🎧 I enjoy having coffee with my friends.
🎧 We go to a cafe in the city center once or twice a week.
🎧 I really like taking wildlife photos in the forest, but I don't get the chance to do it often.
🎧 You can see that our answers are getting more detailed.
🎧 When you speak, you should always try to add some details to your ideas, like this.
🎧 It will make your English sound more interesting and more natural.
🎧 What about you? Can you add some details like these to your sentences?
🎧 Pause the video. Practice. Try to make some sentences. Say them out loud. Practice a little bit.
🎧 OK. Next, let's look at giving background information, especially if you have an interesting or an unusual hobby.
🎧 You can talk about when and why you started doing it.
🎧 For example, I started playing tennis when I was 10.
🎧 I've been learning to paint for six months now.
🎧 I decided to do yoga because I wanted to be healthy.
🎧 My French friend got me into climbing.
🎧 In the last sentence, the phrase, My friend got me into something, means that your friend introduced this activity to you, and now you like it.
🎧 What can you say about your hobby?
🎧 Can you use some of these phrases to talk about yourself?
🎧 For example, I started climbing when I was living in Russia.
🎧 I've been climbing for about eight years.
🎧 I also recently decided to do yoga because I wanted to be more flexible.
🎧 When I was younger, my dad got me into photography.
🎧 What about you? What are your examples?
🎧 Finally, let's look at how you can add some descriptive words to say why you do or don't enjoy something.
🎧 For example, I like climbing because it's really exciting.
🎧 I love doing yoga because it's so relaxing.
🎧 I really like writing stories because it's creative, and I like using my imagination.
🎧 You can also use negative adjectives to talk about things you don't like.
🎧 For example, I don't like going jogging because it's tiring.
🎧 I hate watching TV because I find it boring.
🎧 I've been trying to learn to paint, but it's too hard.
🎧 Why do you like your hobbies?
🎧 What are some activities you don't like doing?
🎧 Can you say why you don't like them?
🎧 Try to make some sentences and practice using this language.
🎧 OK, now it's your turn to speak.
🎧 Let's try using everything we've looked at to make a longer answer.
🎧 For example, I really like playing tennis.
🎧 I play every weekend at the park near my house.
🎧 Sometimes I play with my brother, or sometimes with a friend.
🎧 My brother got me into it because he loves sports, and he needed someone to play with.
🎧 I didn't like it at first because it was hard, and I lost all the time.
🎧 But now, I enjoy it, especially when I beat my brother.
🎧 OK, let's do one more sample answer.
🎧 I love taking photos.
🎧 Once or twice a month, I go to different areas of the city and look for interesting pictures to take.
🎧 I've been interested in photography since I was young, when my dad got me a camera for my birthday.
🎧 I like it because it's creative, and I can express myself through my pictures.
🎧 Anyone can use a camera, but you need to use your imagination to find good pictures.
🎧 Now, can you talk about your free time?
🎧 What do you like doing?
🎧 Where do you go, and how often?
🎧 When did you start doing this hobby, and why?
🎧 And, why do you like or, perhaps, dislike this activity?
🎧 Try to talk for at least 30 seconds.
🎧 Give lots of details.
🎧 Add details to make your answer more interesting.
🎧 OK, that's the end of the lesson.
