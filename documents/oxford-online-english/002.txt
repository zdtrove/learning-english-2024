🎧 Hi, I'm Gina. Welcome to Oxford Online English!
🎧 Where do you live? Do you live in a small town, a big city, or a remote village?
🎧 What's it like?
🎧 In this lesson, you can learn how to describe your hometown in English.
🎧 Let's start with some basic English vocabulary You can use to talk about your hometown.
🎧 Part one: introducing your hometown.
🎧 Let's start with a simple sentence.
🎧 I live in a ________.
🎧 What could you say? You could say something like:
🎧 I live in a city; I live in a town; I live in a village.
🎧 That's a good start, but it's very basic. Let's add a bit more detail.
🎧 What's it called? How big is it?
🎧 I live in Paris. It's the capital city; I live in Shanghai. It's a huge city;
🎧 I live in a small town. It's called Banbury; I live in Manarola, which is a tiny village by the sea.
🎧 Better! You should always try to add more details when you speak.
🎧 What about you? Where do you live? Can you make one or two sentences like this?
🎧 Pause the video and practice!
🎧 Okay, let's move on. We need to make ouranswers more detailed and interesting.
🎧 Adding Background Details
🎧 Part two: adding background and details.
🎧 Think about these questions:
🎧 What's your hometown famous for? Can you think of some words you could use to describe your hometown?
🎧 How long have you lived there?
🎧 Add these ideas to your answer to make it longer and more detailed. For example:
🎧 I live in Paris, the capital city. It's famous for its landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower,
🎧 Notre Dame Cathedral or the Louvre. It's also well-known for its food, of course!
🎧 I live in Shanghai. It's a huge, bustling, international city.
🎧 People from all over the world live and work there.
🎧 I live in a small town called Banbury. I've been living there for about five years,
🎧 since I finished university.
🎧 It's a pretty sleepy place, to be honest.
🎧 Let's look at some useful vocabulary from these examples: Which you can use when you speak.
🎧 Vocabulary
🎧 We said:
🎧 Paris is famous for its landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower.
🎧 Landmarks are famous places or buildings, like the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the Sydney
🎧 Opera House or Christ the Redeemer in Rio.
🎧 Does your hometown have any famous landmarks? What are they called in English?
🎧 Next, we said:
🎧 Shanghai is a bustling city.
🎧 Do you know what this means?
🎧 It means there's a lot of activity.
🎧 There are lots of people, lots of traffic, lots of life and energy.
🎧 Is your city bustling or sleepy? If a town is sleepy there's not much activity and things are quiet.
🎧 What about your hometown. Look at our questions again:
🎧 What's your hometown famous for? Can you think of some words you could use to describe your hometown?
🎧 How long have you lived there?
🎧 What could you say about your hometown? Pause the video and try to make 2-3 sentences.
🎧 Okay? Let's look at our next point.
🎧 Saying What You Like
🎧 Part three: Saying what you like about your hometown.
🎧 What's good about your hometown? What do you like most about it?
🎧 Different people like different things in a city or town.
🎧 Let's look at some example sentences which express positive feelings:
🎧 I love living in Paris. It's got such a rich culture and there's always something interesting going on.
🎧 Shanghai's a great place to live. It's a real 24-hour city and you can meet people from all over the world.
🎧 Living in Banbury suits me. It's a quiet place
🎧 and it's small enough that you can get to know your neighbours and have a sense of community.
🎧 What's important for you?
🎧 Whats Important For You
🎧 Do you want to live somewhere with a rich culture and a sense of history,
🎧 or do you prefer more modern, international cities?
🎧 Would you rather live somewhere larger and more energetic, or somewhere smaller and more peaceful?
🎧 Think about these ideas. You'll need them in a minute!
🎧 Let's look at some useful language from our examples:
🎧 I love living in _______; _______'s a great place to live; Living in _______ suits me.
🎧 Of course, you can change these to say what you want to:
🎧 I quite like living in _______; I really like living in ________;
🎧 I suppose I don't mind living in ________.
🎧 We also saw some useful phrases in our examples:
🎧 It's got such a rich culture; There's always something interesting going on;
🎧 It's a real 24-hour city; You can meet people from all over the world;
🎧 It's small enough that you can get to know your neighbours and have a sense of community
🎧 What does that last phrase mean?
🎧 If you have a sense of community, it means people know their neighbours and feel like they belong to a wider community.
🎧 Smaller towns and villages often have a better sense of community, perhaps because people have more time to talk to each other and do things together.
🎧 What about your hometown? Could you use any of these phrases to describe where you live?
🎧 Next, what if you don't like something about your hometown?
🎧 Saying What You Dislike
🎧 Part four: saying what you dislike.
🎧 Let's look at some examples which express negative feelings:
🎧 Paris is great, but the cost of living is really high. That can be quite stressful because you're always thinking about money and how to make ends meet.
🎧 Shanghai's an exciting place, but it's really crowded and it can be exhausting to live there.
🎧 Air quality can be an issue, particularly in the summer.
🎧 Banbury's nice, but sometimes I find it a bit boring.
🎧 There's not much nightlife and sometimes it feels a bit cut off from the wider world.
🎧 When talking about things you don't like about your hometown.
🎧 You can use adjectives like, 'stressful', 'crowded', 'boring'.
🎧 You can make your answer more interesting by using phrases.
🎧 We saw some useful ones in our examples:
🎧 The cost of living is really high; 
🎧 You're always thinking about how to make ends meet.
🎧 Meaning: you're always thinking about how to pay for your basic living costs.
🎧 It can be exhausting to live there;
🎧 Air quality can be an issue; 
🎧 There's not much nightlife; 
🎧 It feels a bit cut off from the wider world.
🎧 Meaning: you feel like you're far away from people, culture and activity.
🎧 Could you use any of these phrases to describe your hometown?
🎧 Remember that you can also change the phrases to fit your ideas. For example:
🎧 Traffic can be an issue;
🎧 There's not much for young people to do;
🎧 It can be very stressful to live here.
🎧 Talking About Changes
🎧 Okay, what about you? Try to make 3-4 sentences. Say what you like and dislike about your hometown.
🎧 Use the key words and phrases from parts 3 and 4.
🎧 Go on, pause the video and practice!
🎧 Okay? We have one more thing to do:
🎧 Part five: describing how it's changed over time.
🎧 What was your hometown like ten, twenty or fifty years ago?
🎧 How has it changed?
🎧 How has it changed over time?
🎧 Some places change very fast; other places never seem to change at all!
🎧 Talking about changes can add interesting and useful information to your description.
🎧 Let's look:
🎧 Paris has changed a lot in the last twenty years.
🎧 It's much more international and much more expensive than it used to be.
🎧 However, the soul of the city is still there.
🎧 Paris will always be Paris!
🎧 Shanghai is almost unrecognisable compared to twenty or thirty years ago.
🎧 The city has expanded so much, both physically and economically.
🎧 It's amazing when you see old photos of the city; things are so different now!
🎧 Banbury hasn't changed much as a place in the last twenty years,
🎧 but the mix of people is a bit different nowadays.
🎧 The population used to be older and mostly English, whereas now there are more young people living here, including many people from other parts of Europe.
🎧 Again, these examples contain a lot of useful language you can use to talk about your hometown.
🎧 For example:
🎧 ________ has changed a lot in the last twenty years;
🎧 ________ is almost unrecognisable compared to twenty years ago
🎧 ; ________ hasn't changed much as a place in the last twenty years.
🎧 Which of these sentences is true for your hometown? Can you add details to explain why?
🎧 For example:
🎧 It's much more ________ than it used to be; The city has ________ so much; 
🎧 The________ is a bit different nowadays.
🎧 Review
🎧 Now, you've seen a lot of useful language you can use to talk about your hometown.
🎧 Let's put everything together and practice making a longer answer.
🎧 Part six: review.
🎧 Do you remember all the points we talked about? We covered:
🎧 Introducing your hometown, adding background and details, talking about what you like or dislike about it, talking about how it's changed over time.
🎧 Follow these points and you can make a long, detailed answer to describe your hometown.
🎧 For example:
🎧 I live in St Petersburg.
🎧 It's the second largest city in Russia, and it's a beautiful place to live.
🎧 I've lived here all my life and I can't imagine living anywhere else!
🎧 It has such a rich culture,
🎧 I think partly because the city's history is a mix of European and Russian influences.
🎧 I think that's why I like it here—it's a unique place.
🎧 Traffic can be an issue in the city centre, but public transport is very good.
🎧 The city hasn't changed much in the last twenty years, although there are certainly more and more tourists these days!
🎧 Could you make an answer like this?
🎧 Let's do one more example first.
🎧 I'll tell you about my hometown:
🎧 I'm from Denver, the capital of Colorado.
🎧 It's near the Rocky Mountains, so the surrounding area is quite beautiful.
🎧 I've been living here for about three years.
🎧 I really like Denver because it's a young city with lots of energy, but if you need a break it's easy to drive to the mountains and find a quiet place to relax.
🎧 The only real disadvantage is that winter can be seriously cold!
🎧 Denver's changed quite a lot in the last twenty years
🎧 Many people are moving here to work.
🎧 Unfortunately, the cost of living has also gone up quite a lot.
🎧 Okay, now it's definitely your turn! Talk about your hometown. Make a longer answer like these ones.
🎧 If you want, you can post your answer in the video comments. We'll give you feedback on your English.
🎧 That's the end of the lesson. I hope you learned something useful!
