🎧 HI, I'm Michael. Welcome to Oxford Online English.
🎧 In this lesson, you can learn how to describe a picture in English.
🎧 Describing a picture is useful in many English exams; you need to describe a picture in English for exams like FCE, TOEIC or PTE.
🎧 It's also a good way to practise your general English skills.
🎧 Take an interesting picture, and try to describe it in English.
🎧 You can practise your speaking and learn some new English vocabulary!
🎧 In this lesson, you can learn how to describe a picture in English in clear, detailed language.
🎧 We'll show you how to build an answer step-by-step.
🎧 Summary
🎧 What's the best way to start your description?
🎧 Start with a summary, giving a general description of what's in the picture and what you can see.
🎧 It's useful to imagine that the person you're talking to can't see the picture.
🎧 Think: what does the other person need to know?
🎧 What do you need to say so that other people can understand what's in the picture?
🎧 Let's do an example.
🎧 You want to summarize what you see in one or two simple sentences.
🎧 How could you do that?
🎧 You could say:
🎧 There are several small boats next to a beach.
🎧 Or, The picture shows a beach, with many small boats in the water nearby.
🎧 Simple summaries like this make it easy to understand the general contents of the picture.
🎧 Let's do one more: What could you say here?
🎧 Here are some possible answers:
🎧 There are three people cooking in a kitchen.
🎧 Or, The picture shows three young friends cooking together.
🎧 Okay, now it's your turn.
🎧 Here's another picture: You need to make a summary of what you see.
🎧 You can use these phrases:
🎧 There is… or, There are…
🎧 The picture shows…
🎧 Pause the video, and make one or two sentences.
🎧 You can write down your answers if you want.
🎧 Okay, after your summary, you can start giving more detail about what you see in the picture.
🎧 Detail
🎧 To start giving detail, you can talk about where things are in the picture.
🎧 Here's some useful language to help you do this:
🎧 Let's do an example.
🎧 You could say:
🎧 On the left, there's a girl with dark, curly hair.
🎧 She's holding half a cauliflower.
🎧 In the middle, there's a man who's chopping vegetables.
🎧 At the bottom, we can see a counter with many different vegetables on it.
🎧 When talking about photos, you might also need the phrases:
🎧 In the background…
🎧 In the foreground…
🎧 For example: In the foreground, there's a sandy beach with three metal anchors on it.
🎧 In the middle, there are several small boats, which are close to the beach.
🎧 In the background, we can see the blue sea stretching to the horizon.
🎧 Let's put all of this language together in another example:
🎧 Think first: what could you say about this picture?
🎧 Okay, let's look at what you could say:
🎧 On the left, there's a cat sitting on a table.
🎧 On the right, there's a man standing, though we can't see his face.
🎧 In the background, we can see blue sky and snowy mountains.
🎧 Now it's your turn!
🎧 Here's a picture:
🎧 Pause the video, and make at least three sentences.
🎧 Use the useful language you saw in this section.
🎧 Again, you can write your sentences down if you want to!
🎧 Okay? What's next?
🎧 Now, the person you're talking to should have a good general idea about what's in the picture you're describing, and where things are.
🎧 Next, you should start describing your picture in more detail.
🎧 Let's look at a picture you've seen before: When adding detail, don't try to describe everything in the picture.
🎧 It's not necessary or useful.
🎧 You should add details to the most important parts of the picture.
🎧 So, for this picture, what do you think the most important parts are?
🎧 Probably, the person who took this photo took it because of the people.
🎧 So, you should focus your description on the two people.
🎧 Think: what do they look like, and what are they doing?
🎧 You could say:
🎧 The two people both look unhappy or irritated.
🎧 They're sitting at the kitchen table together, but they aren't talking to each other.
🎧 The man is staring down at the table, while the woman is stirring her tea with a spoon.
🎧 That's just three sentences, but they add a lot of detail to your description.
🎧 Let's try one more: In this picture, what do you think you should focus on in your description?
🎧 Fairly obviously, you should talk about the horses.
🎧 Let's try:
🎧 The horses are running through the grass.
🎧 Two of them are black, but the one in the middle is white and grey.
🎧 They don't have saddles or anything, so they could be wild horses.
🎧 Again, you can see that you can do a lot with just a few sentences.
🎧 Alright, now it's your turn!
🎧 Let's take a picture you've already seen: Pause the video and make at least three sentences to describe the picture in detail.
🎧 Try to include as much information as you can.
🎧 How was that?
🎧 If you want more practice, you can do the same exercise with other pictures from this lesson, or you could use your own pictures!
🎧 At this point, you've described the picture in detail.
🎧 So, what else can you do?
🎧 Speculating
🎧 What does that mean?
🎧 Speculating means talking about possibilities.
🎧 For example, look at this picture: Think about some questions:
🎧 Why are the umbrellas there?
🎧 Who put them there?
🎧 By trying to answer questions like this, you are speculating; you're talking about possibilities and giving your opinion about the picture.
🎧 Speculating can help you to make a longer, more detailed answer when talking about a picture.
🎧 Let's do an example:
🎧 I suppose it might be some kind of art project.
🎧 Maybe one person put an umbrella up there as a joke, and then other people started doing it, too.
🎧 Let's look at one more picture:
🎧 Think, if you wanted to speculate about this picture, what could you say?
🎧 Another way to think about it: what questions could you ask yourself about this picture?
🎧 Possible ideas are: who made the footprints, and why?
🎧 Where were they going?
🎧 Where is the person who made the footprints now?
🎧 There are other possibilities, of course, so feel free to use your own ideas, too!
🎧 Okay, so what could you say to speculate about this picture?
🎧 Here are some examples:
🎧 The footprints must have been made by a climber or a mountaineer.
🎧 The person who made the footprints might be standing on top of the mountain now.
🎧 In our examples, you've seen some useful language which you can use to speculate about a picture.
🎧 Do you remember?
🎧 You can use language like:
🎧 I suppose…
🎧 Maybe…
🎧 It must…
🎧 He might…
🎧 Let's practise using these once more with another picture:
🎧 Could you make four sentences, using the useful language we just saw?
🎧 Let's do an example together:
🎧 I suppose the guy is a climber, or he's on an adventure holiday.
🎧 Maybe he climbed something, and now he's on the way down.
🎧 He must have a lot of experience, because his body language is quite relaxed.
🎧 He might be focusing on what he's doing, but he might just be enjoying the view!
🎧 Okay, now it's your turn.
🎧 Can you make four sentences to speculate about this picture, using the language you've learned in this section?
🎧 Pause the video and think about your answers!
🎧 Now, you have one more thing to do.
🎧 Speculation
🎧 When you speculate, you can speculate about what you can see in the picture.
🎧 However, you can—and you should—speculate about what you can't see, too.
🎧 How's this possible?
🎧 Well, think about this picture: You can think about questions like: where and when was the picture taken?
🎧 Who took the picture?
🎧 What was the photographer doing there?
🎧 For example:
🎧 I think this could be in the USA, or maybe Russia.
🎧 It's a good photo, so perhaps it was taken by a professional nature photographer.
🎧 You see?
🎧 Talking about what you can't see in the picture can be very useful, and can help to add details to your answer.
🎧 Let's do one more example: What could you say about this picture?
🎧 Let's do this one together.
🎧 You could say:
🎧 This must be somewhere tropical, like the Caribbean or the Maldives.
🎧 Perhaps it was taken by a tourist who came to the beach on one of those boats.
🎧 Okay, one more.
🎧 This time, you have to do it yourself!
🎧 Here's your picture: Make at least two sentences to speculate about the context of the picture.
🎧 Think about where and when it was taken, who took it, and what the photographer was doing there.
🎧 How was that?
🎧 Hopefully you feel more confident describing pictures in English now.
🎧 Let's put everything you've learned together and practise making longer, fluent descriptions.
🎧 When you describe a picture, you should:
🎧 Give a summary of what you see.
🎧 Talk about where things are in the picture.
🎧 Add details.
🎧 Speculate about what's in the picture.
🎧 And, Speculate about the context of the picture.
🎧 Let's make a longer answer together.
🎧 We'll start with a picture we've used already:
🎧 Here's a possible longer answer:
🎧 In the picture, there are two people sitting at a table, looking unhappy.
🎧 There's a woman on the left and a man on the right.
🎧 In the middle of the picture, we can see some things on the table, like cups of tea, biscuits, milk and so on.
🎧 The two people look sad or irritated, and they aren't speaking to each other.
🎧 They're both looking down at the table.
🎧 I suppose they had a fight and now they aren't talking to each other, or they might just be bored and not have anything to talk about.
🎧 I guess it's a stock photo because otherwise, why would the photographer be in the kitchen with them?
🎧 Do you think you could make an answer like this?
🎧 Remember, all the language you need is in this lesson.
🎧 You just need to take the things you practised in each part, and then put them together.
🎧 Let's do one more example together:
🎧 The picture shows umbrellas hanging in the air.
🎧 In the foreground, we can see a streetlight, and the umbrellas fill the picture from left to right.
🎧 The umbrellas are of many different colours, mostly bright colours like pink, yellow or green.
🎧 They're hanging from wires.
🎧 I can see at least four lines of umbrellas hanging down in this way, but there could be even more.
🎧 Maybe this is some sort of art project.
🎧 It might also be a festival or tradition, that people decorate the street with colourful umbrellas like this.
🎧 I suppose the picture was taken in a city or town, though I can't tell where exactly.
🎧 Perhaps the photographer was a tourist, and was just walking around the city when he saw this amazing and strange scene.
🎧 Alright, now it's your turn.
🎧 We'll give you a new picture:
🎧 Pause the video and try to make a longer answer, like we just did.
🎧 Follow the same structure.
🎧 Finished?
🎧 I don't think so!
🎧 You should practise as much as you can.
🎧 Take the other pictures from the lesson, and make longer answers about them, too.
🎧 Practise your answers several times, until you can do it fluently and comfortably.
🎧 If you want, you can leave one of your answers in the comments and we'll give you feedback on your English.
