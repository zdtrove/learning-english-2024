🎧 Hi, I'm Mike and welcome to Oxford Online English!
🎧 In this lesson, you can learn how to talk about your job in English.
🎧 Where do you work?
🎧 What do you have to do in your job?
🎧 What kind of company do you work for?
🎧 In this class, you can learn how to answer questions like this in clear, detailed English.
🎧 Ready? Let's start!
🎧 Part one: introducing your job.
🎧 I'm a ________: I work in ________; I work for _________.
🎧 How would you complete these sentences?
🎧 You could say something like:
🎧 I'm a writer.
🎧 I work in online education.
🎧 I work for a publishing company.
🎧 'I work in...' is used with a field, meaning a type of work.
🎧 So, you can say things like:
🎧 I work in finance.
🎧 I work in digital marketing.
🎧 You can also use 'work in' with a place or a department of a company.
🎧 For example:
🎧 I work in the HR department of a financial firm.
🎧 I work in a school, teaching modern languages.
🎧 Confused?
🎧 You can see that if you use 'work in' to talk about the type of work you do, you don't use an article like 'a' or 'the'.
🎧 If you use an article 'a' or 'the' after 'work in', it means you're talking about the place or department where you work.
🎧 'I work for…' is used with a company.
🎧 So, you could say:
🎧 I'm a salesman.
🎧 I work for a mobile phone company.
🎧 I work for a law firm based in Frankfurt.
🎧 Or even: I run my own business, so I work for myself.
🎧 What can you say?
🎧 Can you make sentences like this to say something about your job?
🎧 Pause the video and try to make a sentence.
🎧 Say it aloud!
🎧 Part 2 Describe your company
🎧 Next, let's add more details to your answer.
🎧 Part two: describing your company.
🎧 I work for a _________ company which __________
🎧 Look at this sentence.
🎧 We need one adjective, and the end of the sentence after 'which'.
🎧 Any ideas?
🎧 For the adjectives, think about these ideas: is your company big or small?
🎧 Local or multinational?
🎧 For the part after 'which', ask yourself: what does your company do?
🎧 Does it make things, sell things, organise things?
🎧 Does it provide products, services, or both?
🎧 So, you could say:
🎧 I work for an international electronics company which makes tablet computers.
🎧 I work for a German company which does market research for other companies.
🎧 What if you don't work for a company?
🎧 Here are some things you could say:
🎧 I'm a freelancer.
🎧 Meaning: I work independently, for different people and companies.
🎧 I'm self-employed.
🎧 Meaning: I work for myself, either freelance or I have my own business.
🎧 I'm a business owner.
🎧 If you don't work, and people ask you what you do, what can you say?
🎧 Here are some useful phrases:
🎧 I'm between jobs at the moment.
🎧 Meaning: I've left one job, and haven't found another yet.
🎧 This sounds nicer than saying, “I'm unemployed.”
🎧 I'm taking some time out to…(travel, spend time with my kids, write a book, recover from an illness, etc.)
🎧 Meaning: I'm not working at the moment because I want to focus on something else.
🎧 I'm retired.
🎧 What about you?
🎧 Do you work for a company?
🎧 What can you say about it?
🎧 If you don't work for a company, how would you describe your work situation?
🎧 Part 3 Describe your job in detail
🎧 Part three: how to describe your job in more detail.
🎧 So what do you actually do all day?
🎧 Let's see how you can describe your job in more detail.
🎧 Look at these sentences:
🎧 I have to _________; I'm responsible for _________; Most of my time is spent
🎧 _________.
🎧 Let's do some examples together.
🎧 We'll start with a simple example.
🎧 I'm a nurse.
🎧 I have to look after patients, give them medicine and make sure they're comfortable.
🎧 I'm responsible for about 20-30 patients.
🎧 Most of my time is spent talking to patients and checking that everything is okay.
🎧 Next, let's do a more detailed example.
🎧 I have to design websites to the client's specifications.
🎧 I'm responsible for the whole design process, so I have to take the client's ideas and turn them into a finished product.
🎧 Most of my time is spent experimenting with different designs and ideas and seeing what looks good, because attention to detail is important in this kind of work.
🎧 Can you say something like this about your job and what you do?
🎧 Try to add details if you can.
🎧 Part 4 How to describe your job
🎧 Part four: saying how you feel about your job.
🎧 Now, you can hopefully say something about your job and where you work.
🎧 But here's another question: do you like your job?
🎧 Why or why not?
🎧 Hopefully, you enjoy your job!
🎧 How could you describe a job which you like?
🎧 Of course, you could use general adjectives like 'good' or 'interesting', but here are some specific adjectives you could use:
🎧 Stimulating :something which is stimulating is exciting and gives you energy.
🎧 Satisfying: means that your job gives you a sense of achievement.
🎧 Creative: you can use your imagination when you work.
🎧 Rewarding: this means your job gives you very positive feelings.
🎧 It's often used to talk about jobs in which you help other people.
🎧 For example, teachers or nurses might describe their jobs as rewarding.
🎧 Challenging: challenging can be positive or negative, but if you use it to talk about your job, it would have a positive meaning.
🎧 It means that your job is difficult, but in an interesting way which makes you think and learn.
🎧 What if you don't like your job?
🎧 Again, you can use general words like 'boring' or 'difficult', which are fine but very basic.
🎧 If you want to be more creative with your vocabulary, here are some things you could say:
🎧 Exhausting: describes work which makes you feel very tired, either physically or mentally.
🎧 Thankless:if your work is thankless, no one notices or appreciates what you do.
🎧 Mind-numbing: extremely boring.
🎧 Dead-end: describes a job which has no prospects for the future.
🎧 If you have a dead-end job, you will never get promoted and the job will always be the same.
🎧 Soul-destroying: describes a job which is extremely unpleasant and boring, and which you really, really hate.
🎧 Part 5 How to make a longer answer
🎧 Part five: how to make a longer answer.
🎧 At this point, you should be able to introduce your work, say where you work, give details about what you do and say how you feel about your work.
🎧 Let's make some longer sample answers together.
🎧 First one:
🎧 I'm a pharmacist.
🎧 I started my own small pharmacy, so I'm also a business owner.
🎧 I have to work as a pharmacist, of course, giving advice to patients and making sure they have the right medicine.
🎧 However, I'm also responsible for the pharmacy, so I have to manage my staff, do the accounts, and so on.
🎧 It's stimulating work because I have to do many different things every day, so I never get bored.
🎧 Clear?
🎧 Could you make an answer like this?
🎧 Let's do one more:
🎧 I'm a writer.
🎧 I work in online education.
🎧 I work for a big publishing company, which produces different educational materials that are used all around the world.
🎧 I have to write lesson plans and materials for teachers to use in the classroom.
🎧 I spend most of my time thinking about how I can make different things fit together into a lesson.
🎧 It's very challenging work and it can be exhausting, but it's also very creative and satisfying, because I know people all around the world are using lessons which I wrote.
🎧 Okay, now it's your turn!
🎧 Try to make a longer answer like this talking about your job.
🎧 Use the vocabulary and structure from this lesson to help you.
🎧 If you want, you can post your answer in the video comments on YouTube.
🎧 We'll give you some feedback on your answer.
🎧 That's the end of the lesson.
🎧 I hope you learned some new ways to talk about your job and what you do.
🎧 Thanks very much for watching. See you next time!
