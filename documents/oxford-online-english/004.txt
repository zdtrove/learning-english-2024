🎧 Hello, I'm Oli. Welcome to Oxford Online English!
🎧 In this lesson, you can learn about how to talk about your home in English.
🎧 Where do you live?
🎧 What's your home like?
🎧 What about your neighbourhood?
🎧 Talking about where you live is a common conversation topic in English.
🎧 So it's good to have some things to say.
🎧 Part one: introducing where you live and talking about types of home.
🎧 Let's start with a simple sentence.
🎧 I live in a... what could you put there?
🎧 You could say, I live in a house, I live in an apartment.
🎧 In Britain, people sometimes say, Flat.
🎧 'Flat' and 'apartment' have the same meaning.
🎧 Next, let's add a bit more detail.
🎧 What kind of house or apartment is it?
🎧 For example, I live in a small, two-stoery house in the suburbs.
🎧 When we say how many floors a building has, we usually use the word storey, so you can say a two-storey house, a four-storey apartment building and so on.
🎧 I live in an apartment on the third floor of a four-storey building.
🎧 There are many different kinds of house and apartment.
🎧 For example, do you live in a terraced house, a semi-detached house, or a detached house?
🎧 Terraced houses have other houses on both sides, a semi-detached house has another house just on one side, and a detached house stands by itself.
🎧 Detached houses are usually larger and more expensive.
🎧 Terraced houses are usually smaller and cheaper.
🎧 What kinds of houses are more common in your country?
🎧 What about apartments?
🎧 Many apartments are in apartment buildings.
🎧 Easy enough, right?
🎧 If you live in a very tall apartment building with many floors, you can say you live in a high-rise in American English or a tower block in British English.
🎧 Sometimes a house is divided into apartments, these are called converted apartments.
🎧 Apartments come in many different sizes, if an apartment just has one room which is a bedroom and living room together, it's called a studio.
🎧 Of course, you can also have bigger apartments, a two-bedroom apartment, a three-bedroom apartment and so on.
🎧 Large apartments might be duplex apartments, this means the apartment has more than one floor.
🎧 What about you? Where do you live?
🎧 Do you live in a house or an apartment?
🎧 Could you make a sentence using the vocabulary from this section?
🎧 For example, I live in a two-story terraced house.
🎧 I live in an apartment on the 28th floor of a high-rise building.
🎧 I live in a converted studio apartment.
🎧 Next, let's see how you can describe the inside of your home in more detail.
🎧 If you want to describe your home, what can you talk about?
🎧 Well, you could start by saying what rooms it has.
🎧 For example, My house has two bedrooms, a kitchen, a living room, and a garden.
🎧 It's always better to add adjectives or details to make your speaking more interesting.
🎧 Let's try: My house has two small bedrooms, a kitchen with a dining table, a living room with big windows, and a small garden.
🎧 What other rooms might you have in your home?
🎧 You could have a dining room for people to eat together.
🎧 Maybe you have an office or a study where you can work, if you live in a warmer country, you might have a balcony or a terrace where you can sit outside in warmer weather.
🎧 What about your home? What does it have?
🎧 Does your home have a garden, a balcony, or another outdoor area?
🎧 Try to make a sentence describing your home.
🎧 For example, I live in a two-bedroom apartment.
🎧 The bedrooms are quite small, but there's a big living room with a dining area, a modern kitchen, and also a small balcony where we can sit outside in the summer.
🎧 What can you say about your home?
🎧 Okay, next, saying what you like or dislike.
🎧 So now you can hopefully describe your home a little bit, but what about your opinion?
🎧 What do you like about your home, and what would you change if you could?
🎧 Positive words you could use to describe your home include 'spacious', meaning large with lots of room; 'cosy' which means comfortable in a warm welcoming way; 'light' describes a home which gets lot of natural light.
🎧 You can say your home is 'warm' or 'cool', meaning that it's comfortable in winter or in summer.
🎧 Finally, you can describe your home as 'convenient', meaning it's close to your job, it's close to the shops, it's close to your children's school and so on.
🎧 You can use 'convenient' plus 'for.'
🎧 For example, it's convenient for the subway, or it's convenient for my office.
🎧 Could you use any of these words to describe your home?
🎧 Okay, but what if you don't like your home?
🎧 Well, here are some words you could use: 'cramped' means your home is too small, so you don't have enough space.
🎧 'Dark' means your home doesn't get enough light, so that even when it's sunny outside, it's still dark inside.
🎧 'Drafty' means cold air comes inside through the windows or through the doors in the winter.
🎧 'Stuffy' means there's not enough air so it's very uncomfortable in hot weather.
🎧 You could say your home is 'noisy', for example if you live near a main road, your home might be noisy even at night.
🎧 Can you make a sentence about your home using some of these words?
🎧 For example, My home is light and spacious, but it can get very drafty in the winter.
🎧 I like my apartment because it's cosy, although it can be noisy because there's a restaurant just downstairs.
🎧 Okay, so now you can talk about your home and what you think of it.
🎧 What else can you say on this topic?
🎧 Let's look, part four: saying who you live with.
🎧 Who do you live with?
🎧 Do live with your parents, your husband or wife, with your family?
🎧 Do you live by yourself or do you live with flatmates (people who you share a rented flat with)?
🎧 Maybe you live with friends.
🎧 Let's look at examples of what you could say here.
🎧 I live with my parents.
🎧 I live in a shared house; I have four flatmates.
🎧 I live by myself.
🎧 What about you?
🎧 Okay, that was easy.
🎧 Let's look at one more topic you can talk about.
🎧 Part five: talking about your neighbourhood.
🎧 First, be careful with the word 'neighbourhood'.
🎧 A neighbourhood is not a person; it's the area near your home.
🎧 So where is your home?
🎧 Is it in the city centre, the suburbs, or outside the city?
🎧 If you live outside the city, do you live on the outskirts of the city, in a village, or in the middle of nowhere?
🎧 How could you describe your neighbourhood?
🎧 Is it quiet or lively?
🎧 Trendy or boring?
🎧 Are there many shops, cafes, bars, restaurants?
🎧 Are there parks or sports facilities?
🎧 For example, you could say, I live in a very lively area just south of the city center.
🎧 There are many cafes, shops, and places to go.
🎧 Or, I live in a quiet area in the suburbs, in the north of the city.
🎧 It's a nice area and it's quiet, but it's a bit boring.
🎧 There isn't really anything to do.
🎧 What about you?
🎧 Can you say something about your neighborhood?
🎧 Okay, finally let's put everything together.
🎧 If you can use everything we've looked at in this lesson, you should be able to speak very clearly and with lots of details about your home and where you live.
🎧 For example, I live in a two-story terraced house.
🎧 It has two bedrooms, a living room, a small kitchen, and a garden.
🎧 It's cosy and convenient for getting to work, but it's a bit cramped, especially when we have guests.
🎧 I live with my wife and daughter.
🎧 Our house is near the city centre in a quiet neighborhood.
🎧 There isn't much to do, but there are some small shops and a park where we go if the weather's nice.
🎧 Here's one more sample answer: I live by myself in a studio apartment.
🎧 It just has one main room with a tiny kitchen.
🎧 It's very warm in winter, but it can get a bit stuffy in summer.
🎧 I live in the city center, very close to everything.
🎧 It's very lively, with lots of bars and restaurants.
🎧 It's a good place for young people to live, but not many families choose to live here.
🎧 What about you? Can you make an answer like this talking about where you live?
🎧 Try to use as much language from the lesson as you can.
🎧 Okay, that's the end of the lesson.
🎧 Thanks very much for watching.
