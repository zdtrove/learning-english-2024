🎧 Good morning, Jack.
🎧 Can you do me a favor and photocopy these documents for me, please?
🎧 I need them for the staff meeting tomorrow morning.
🎧 There will be fifteen attendees.
🎧 Hi, Grace.
🎧 Unfortunately, the copy machine is out of order.
🎧 The repairman is supposed to come this afternoon to take a look,
🎧 but this is the second time it's broken down in the past two weeks,
🎧 so it might not be fixable.
🎧 Oh no. I need the copies by 7:30 AM to prepare the folders for the meeting.
🎧 Could you run over to our branch in Marple?
🎧 It's only a 10-minute drive.
🎧 I just need to make sure I'm prepared for this meeting.
🎧 Yeah, I can do that.
🎧 I actually did my training at the Marple office, so I'm familiar with it.
🎧 I can leave right now.
🎧 Are these all the documents you need?

🎧 Have you checked your email?
🎧 It looks like Antonio Garks is going to take over as production manager at our factory in Vietnam
🎧 while Susan Carter is out on maternity leave.
🎧 The post lasts six months.
🎧 Wow, I haven't seen that email yet.
🎧 Did the email say when he was flying out?
🎧 Not for a few months, at the beginning of January.
🎧 Well the project in Southampton won't be finished by January.
🎧 I wonder who will fill his position there.
🎧 The email didn't say, so I'm assuming they haven't made that decision.
🎧 I personally think that Jesse Key would excel in that position.
🎧 I agree.
🎧 She is very good at jumping in a situation and making it her own.
🎧 It would be a great test, as she hasn't worked on a project of this size before.
🎧 She has done a great job,
🎧 but I am not sure if she is quite ready for this challenge.
🎧 I guess we will see how things progress.
🎧 The email also said upper management will be holding a meeting about this subject tomorrow,
🎧 and they ask you to RSVP, so be sure to respond.

🎧 Hi, I'm Demi Geard.
🎧 Is Mrs. Hayley in?
🎧 I'm one of her clients.
🎧 Mrs. Hayley is traveling abroad until the end of next week.
🎧 Is it urgent?
🎧 I can try to reach her at the resort.
🎧 No need for that.
🎧 I just came by to drop off these documents she asked me to sign.
🎧 Can I leave them with you?
🎧 Sure, no problem!
🎧 I'll let her know you dropped them off and give them to her when she returns.
🎧 Here's a post-it, can you write down what it's about so she knows?
🎧 Sure, I'll do that.

🎧 Hi, I'm calling to get an update on a claim I filed.
🎧 It's for an emergency dental surgery I had while on vacation.
🎧 Sure, I can help with that.
🎧 Do you remember when you submitted the claim?
🎧 I filed it on December 27th, so about a month ago.
🎧 I see.
🎧 Normally, it takes about six weeks to resolve,
🎧 but because of the holidays, it might take up to eight weeks.
🎧 Can you give me the 8-digit reference number?
🎧 I'll get back to you within 72 hours with an update.

🎧 Good afternoon, this is Harry Stills.
🎧 I'm calling regarding a delivery I was expecting.
🎧 I placed an order for a computer yesterday and paid for the expedited shipping.
🎧 It was supposed to be here by noon,
🎧 but here we are, two hours later, and I am still waiting.
🎧 I'm sorry about that.
🎧 The delivery crew actually just called us to let us know he had a flat tire
🎧 and was running behind on his deliveries.
🎧 He is back on the road and should arrive in the next thirty minutes.
🎧 Are you sure?
🎧 I have to leave in forty minutes for an appointment,
🎧 so I need to make sure I have it before then.
🎧 I understand.
🎧 I will call him right now and ask him to make sure you are the first stop he makes in the neighborhood.
🎧 I want to apologize for the delay.

[006]

🎧 Whoa, check out that line!
🎧 Only one person working at the check-in counter,
🎧 and it's going to take ages to get our luggage sorted.
🎧 They're definitely understaffed.
🎧 We should get priority boarding, or we might miss the flight.
🎧 Sounds like a plan, but I don't carry cash anymore.
🎧 Do you think they take traveler's checks?
🎧 No worries, I got my credit card with me,
🎧 it should work fine.

🎧 I just got the invitation to the workshop on Monday.
🎧 It seems very interesting,
🎧 the topic is "Designing for the minimalist".
🎧 Do you think you will go?
🎧 Oh, that does sound very interesting.
🎧 I'm seeing a trend in minimalism design with my clients.
🎧 I haven't checked my email,
🎧 what time is the workshop?
🎧 I have a presentation on Tuesday, so I am pretty busy until then.
🎧 It starts at 9 A.M.
🎧 And is scheduled to last for an hour.
🎧 The email also mentioned free coffee and donuts.
🎧 Luckily, it is a small workshop,
🎧 so will be held in the meeting room next to your office.
🎧 They said there will be a few hands-on events.
🎧 Can I do anything to help you out with your presentation?
🎧 Well, if it is only an hour, I should be able to attend.
🎧 It is a good way to start my busy day!
🎧 Thanks for letting me know.

🎧 Hello, this is Tom Barron.
🎧 I have an appointment with Dr. Coleman at 4 PM tomorrow,
🎧 but my head has been pounding since yesterday.
🎧 Could you schedule me for this afternoon instead?
🎧 I'm sorry, but Dr. Coleman is out of town for personal reasons.
🎧 The earliest we can schedule you is 8 AM tomorrow.
🎧 I don't think I can wait until tomorrow.
🎧 That's why I called in the first place.
🎧 If you don't mind, Dr. Roberto is available.
🎧 He's our on-call doctor and can see patients.
🎧 There's an opening at 2 PM today.
🎧 Would you like to see him?

🎧 Hi, this is Christina.
🎧 I bought a pair of dress shoes from your online store,
🎧 but they're too tight because I got narrow width instead of medium.
🎧 What can I do?
🎧 Sorry about that.
🎧 Shoes do stretch with wear,
🎧 but you can return them by mail or at one of our outlets.
🎧 Driving across town is too much hassle for me.
🎧 How do I return them by mail?
🎧 Just fill out the exchange form on the packing slip,
🎧 attach a shipping label,
🎧 and mail them back in the original packaging.

🎧 Hello, this is Julie Burton.
🎧 I rented a car from your shop.
🎧 However, I just found a tear in the driver's seat.
🎧 I didn't notice it when I picked up the rental vehicle this morning.
🎧 So I'm a bit concerned about whether I might have to pay for any repairs.
🎧 Well, not to worry, Mrs. Burton.
🎧 According to our database,
🎧 your insurance package covers any damage to the vehicle,
🎧 so it will reimburse the expenses if needed.
🎧 That's great news.
🎧 One quick question, though,
🎧 do I need to top off the tank when I return the car tomorrow?
🎧 Yes, please.
🎧 By the way, there will be some paperwork to get through,
🎧 so please give yourself enough time.
